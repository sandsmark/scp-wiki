**Item #:'** SCP-302

**Object Class**: Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-302 is to kept in site [REDACTED], under Safe-3 Protocols. Artifact should be handled with gloves at all times, and utmost precautions should be taken to ensure that the artfifact does not make skin contact with unauthorized personnel. Any personnel not scheduled for testing that start showing signs of SCP-302's effects may apply for termination. All subjects suffering from SCP-302's affliction should be terminated after no longer than a eight (8) days.

**Description:** SCP-302 is a small tin sculpture with a bronze/patina finish depicting two ants carrying a leaf. Direct skin contact by a human with SCP-302 causes the start of an 'affliction' cycle. Once an affliction cycle has been started, there has been no known way to halt it except through the death of the subject. 

The affliction cycles proceed in predictable patterns. First, usually within two (2) hours of initial contact with the artifact, the subject will find a single small, relatively harmless ant on their person. This ant is of any several very small ant species, and rarely causes much alarm. It is of note that in all recorded cases, subjects have always distinctly noticed this first ant.

Thereafter, the subject will continue to find exponentially increasing numbers of ants on their person on a daily basis. On the second day, twenty-four hour (24) to forty-eight (48) hours after exposure, normally three (3) to five (5) ants have been recorded appearing on the subject throughout the day. Subjects normally are not alarmed at this stage, and only casually notice the ants before removing them from their person.

On the third day, nine (9) to twenty-five (25) have been reported appearing on subject throughout the day. Ant species are still very small and relatively harmless, but ants will often bite or sting the subject to mild annoyance and irritation. Subjects by this time usually become concerned with the continued appearance of ants on their person, and by the fourth day, almost all subjects are aware that something is highly amiss.

Infection continues at in this pattern, with the number of ants appearing on the subject throughout the day being generally in the range of 3^X and 5^X, where X is the number of days since initial contact with SCP-302. As time progresses, not only does the number of ants increase, but the species of ants seem to change, with smaller, harmless species appearing at first, later changing to larger species or species with more painful stings or bites.

The majority of subjects do not live past the fifth day, when 729 to 15,625 of any of several tropical fire ant species will typically swarm the subject throughout the day. 

Test subjects whose survival has been aided by the foundation until a full week have seen the emergence of 2187 to 78,125 //paraponera clavata//, or bullet ants, on their person. 

Test subjects lasting longer than nine days have [DATA EXPUNGED].
