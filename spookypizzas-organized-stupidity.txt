**Item #:** SpookyPizza

**Object Class:** ???

**Special Containment Procedures:** SpookyPizza is to be confined in his apartment (It's not like I'm going to leave it or anything) and must be supplied a daily amount of spicy memes. Articles posted by SpookyPizza must be downvoted immediately (please don't do that actually) before he actually thinks he is a competent writer. Refer him by Spooks or SpookyPizza there, and not SpookyBee. --I will murder you in your sleep if you do this.--

**Description:** SpookyPizza is a 20anything old French (I can feel the patriotism coursing through my veins) man who """"""regularly"""""" writes articles for the SCP Foundation website. He's also part of Translation Archive. If you want to know what SpookyPizza looks like, picture Bob Ross shaven and with glasses.

He's mostly active on #Site19, he'll often shitpost there and repeatedly spam his sandbox pages. (Would work for crit.) He's a pretty chill dude and he can give you crit if you ask him. (Although my crit isn't really the best, I mostly point out tonal issues, plot-holes, and grammatical errors)

He can also draw stuff if you ask him requests. He's pretty okay at making art, he'll often draw environments, objects, creatures, and sometimes people if he's really in the mood for making art. (Drawing people is a nightmare, the human anatomy is just... hard to draw.) Here's his silly artwork thread: http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-2256503/spookypizza-s-artsy-stuff-in-general-not-broad-at-all#post-2807378

He often plays indie or Valve games on Steam, his favorite games are the Binding of Isaac Rebirth, Team Fortress 2, Portal 1 and 2, and Kerbal Space Program. If you want his Steam ID, ask him politely and he'll friend you. (I'm horrible at video-games tho.)

He likes to browse the internet in the quest of well, not being bored. Despite this, he'll still often be late on the latest news because most of his input is on KnowYourMeme and Youtube. He severely despises sites such as 9gag or FaceBook, if you tell him that you tolerate these sites, well don't expect to live another day.

He's also active on #Site43-ooc and on http://scp-foundation-rp.wikidot.com, the RP alternative to SCP-RP-Origins. Kinda inactive at moment, but will come back during the summer (I hope it comes back, I'll stay optimistic).

And that's basically it.

//What if bees were SpookyPizza?//

//What is SpookyPizza was --SpookyBee?--// No.

//What is SpookyBee was --SpookyPizza?--// I said no.

> This is the first article I posted on the SCP wiki, it got a lot of attention and to my surprise, a shit ton of love. It took me six months to post that article (ModernFoundation RP took a lot of my time away) and I'm still surprised on how it turned out. Thanks to everyone who gave me feedback while writing this, you are true heroes.

> Oh boy! This is my artwork page! A lot of people like my drawings apparently, great! After SunnyClockwork's Series IV artwork page got released and Roget posted his drawings on the mainsite, I wanted to keep the Art Train going so I posted my artwork page in the same week as they did.

__[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3277 SCP-3722]:__

> This one didn't get as much attention as I expected, mainly because like a complete impatient idiot, I posted it before most people on the site had finals, basically dooming the article from the start. This article has also taught me to get more feedback before posting although now that I have cut so many corners after its release that it metaphorically resembles a circle. BTW: I don't truly know why I changed the layout of SCPSYSTEM although to be honest it looks a bit neater in that format.
