**Item #:** SpookyPizza

**Object Class:** ???

**Special Containment Procedures:** SpookyPizza is to be confined in her apartment (It's not like I'm going to leave it or anything) and must be supplied a daily amount of spicy memes. Articles posted by SpookyPizza must be downvoted immediately (please don't do that actually) before she actually thinks she is a competent writer. Refer her by Spooks or SpookyPizza there, and not SpookyBee. --I will murder your mother in your sleep if you do this.--

**Description:** SpookyPizza is a 20anything old French (I can feel the patriotism coursing through my veins) woman who """"""regularly"""""" writes articles for the SCP Foundation website. She's also part of Translation Archive. If you want to know what SpookyPizza looks like, picture Bob Ross shaven and with glasses.

She's mostly active on #Site19, she'll often shitpost there and repeatedly spam her sandbox pages. (Would work for crit.) She's a pretty chill gril and she can give you crit if you ask her. (Although my crit isn't really the best, I mostly point out tonal issues, plot-holes, and grammatical errors)

She can also draw stuff if you ask her requests. She's pretty okay at making art, she'll often draw environments, objects, creatures, and sometimes people if she's really in the mood for making art. (Drawing people is a nightmare, the human anatomy is just... hard to draw.) Here's her silly artwork thread: http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-2256503/spookypizza-s-artsy-stuff-in-general-not-broad-at-all#post-2807378

She often plays indie or Valve games on Steam, her favorite games are the Binding of Isaac Rebirth, Team Fortress 2, Portal 1 and 2, and Kerbal Space Program. If you want her Steam ID, ask her politely and she'll friend you. (Fuck I need to update this. I guess Hearts of Iron IV and Team Fortress 2 now?)

She likes to browse the internet in the quest of well, not being bored. Despite this, she'll still often be late on the latest news because most of her input is on KnowYourMeme (That dark era is far behind me. Reddit and Discord are now- Well It's not much better in honesty...) and Youtube. She severely despises sites such as 9gag, IFunny, or FaceBook, if you tell her that you tolerate these sites, well don't expect to live another day.

And that's basically it.

//What if SpookyPizza was bees?//

//What if bees were SpookyPizza?//

//What is SpookyPizza was --SpookyBee?--// No.

//What is SpookyBee was --SpookyPizza?--// I said no.

**I'm making a comeback (or maybe I won't), this time as a gril.(how did this happen, I don't know!)**

[[tab My Articles]]

+++ Those are all the articles I wrote! I hope you enjoy them. Read the paragraphs below the links for further author commentary.

__[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3463 SCP-3463]:__

> This is the first article I posted on the SCP wiki, it got a lot of attention and to my surprise, a shit ton of love. It took me six months to post that article (ModernFoundation RP took a lot of my time away) and I'm still surprised on how it turned out. Thanks to everyone who gave me feedback while writing this, you are true heroes.

__[http://www.scp-wiki.net/spookypizza-s-art-stash SpookyPizza's Art Stash]:__

> Oh boy! This is my artwork page! A lot of people like my drawings apparently, great! After SunnyClockwork's Series IV artwork page got released and Roget posted his drawings on the mainsite, I wanted to keep the Art Train going so I posted my artwork page in the same week as they did.

__[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-7789-J SCP-7789-J]:__

> Hey look! //It's my first joke SCP!// A lot of people liked this, I never knew I was this funny. Most people laugh at me and not many laugh at my jokes. It's refreshing to know how many upvotes it got. I mainly made this joke SCP to point how stupid and ridiculous some airplane regulations are. //Does it disrupt radio signals? No. So why do they keep telling us that shit?// Thanks to everyone who gave this feedback.

__[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-8851-J SCP-8851-J]:__

> //Hey! Another joke SCP! Is SpookyPizza running out of ideas? Is he desperately trying to resemble Daveyoufool? Is she cracking more jokes because her current life is an absolute nightmare? All of these questions can be answered by yes! Maybe.// No seriously, I like making joke SCPs even if they're one of the hardest type of articles to write. This one is basically one of these clickbait 'TRY NOT TO LAUGH CHALLENGE 5645757" videos, it's a series of gags I thought in my mind. There's no real structure, just humor.

__[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3666 SCP-3666]:__

> //Finally! After a long **long** hiatus, SpookyPizza finally posted a non-joke SCP article.// SCP-3666 is probably one of the most ambitious SCPs I've written. I got more than 17 people to review it and I'm pretty proud of it. Plus, I took the 3666 slot to stop the endless stream of satanic coldposts. (I'm so so sorry Flawed, take the 3667 slot instead. ;-;) Anyway, a lot of people liked this one. I wish it was less long tho, but it's still the best article I've written (alongside SCP-3463), you should all check it out.
