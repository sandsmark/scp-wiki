**Item #:** SCP-299

**Object Class:** Keter


**Special Containment Procedures:** A small forest (roughly 200 metre in diameter) of SCP-299 is to be contained in an underground biodome in Area-299 in the [REDACTED] desert. Any other specimen encountered are to be incinerated. No plant life is to come into contact with SCP-299 outside of controlled testing under any circumstances. Areas infested by SCP-299 should be considered class-8 (Chance of death higher than 95%) hazard zones, and any area in which SCP-299 infestation has been confirmed is to be firebombed immediately and monitored for four (4) weeks. Any further infestation is to be incinerated, as well as all wildlife present on the site.

**Description:** SCP-299 appears to be a species of tree, characterised by branches which end in sharp points and very dark wood. Closer inspection reveals that SCP-299 occurs in networks, each "tree" being connected to neighbouring trees.  An instance of SCP-299 will spread it's roots, and a tree of any species which is touched by the roots of SCP-299 will be converted into another instance of SCP-299. SCP-299 appears to be incapable of reproducing in any way other than by spreading its infection thusly.


After a few minutes, a tree which has been infected by SCP-299 will begin to lose its leaves.  Over the next two (2) to five (5) hours, the branches of the infected tree will begin to shift.  Most low branches will shift downward to a height of anywhere from 30 to 100 centimetres, and taper to a point.

**Addendum 299-1:** Microscopic analysis of low lying branches has revealed that these points are incredibly sharp, tapering fractally to the atomic level.  Direct contact with the point of a branch from SCP-299 is unadvised, as the tip could become lodged and [DATA EXPUNGED]

 --SCP-299 all branches less than roughly 5 metres from ground level will begin to shift downward to a height of roughly 1 metre from the ground plus or minus 18 cm, where they will stick out from the trunk at angles of 78 to 102 degrees, with their length often greatly reduced and their ends noticeably sharpened. All branches more than 5 metres from ground level will shift upwards, coming to rest at approximately 7 metres above the ground.  These branches will connect with neighbouring trees, spreading the infestation and eventually creating a thick web 7 metres above the ground. The tops

The tree's roots will begin to shift upwards to about 8 centimetres below the surface, and large structures that resemble leaves will begin to grow from them, settling horizontally until they cover most of the surface. These leaves are, on average, 32 cm long and 26 cm wide. Each leaf is covered with black tendrils resembling the legs of very large insects. During this process the tree's wood will blacken considerably.--

Specimens of SCP-299-2 will release chemicals that cause heightened paranoia and aggression in most animals, including humans. The effect of this chemical often causes groups to split up and wander around in the forest alone, where they will likely pass through an infested area. When an organic object comes into contact with a leaf from SCP-299-2 the tendrils on the leaf will hold on to the object tightly and and move it to an infested tree. If the object is large enough it will be impaled on one of the branches, where it will be slowly consumed by a root-like structure sprouting from the branch.  Objects too small for this will be gradually pressed into the bark and incorporated into the tree.

**Addendum 299-2:** Those with sufficient clearance may request access to[REDACTED] for details on the weaponisation of SCP-299
