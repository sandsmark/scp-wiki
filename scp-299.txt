**Item #:** SCP-299

**Object Class:** Keter


**Special Containment Procedures:** A small forest (roughly 200 metre in diameter) of SCP-299 is to be contained in an underground biodome in Area-299 in the [REDACTED] desert. Any other specimen encountered are to be incinerated. No plant life is to come into contact with SCP-299-1 outside of controlled testing under any circumstances. Areas infested by SCP-299-2 should be considered class-8 (Chance of death higher than 95%) hazard zones. Any area in which SCP-299-1 infestation has been confirmed is to be firebombed immediately and monitored for four (4) weeks. Any further infestation is to be incinerated, as well as all wildlife present on the site.

**Description:** SCP-299-1 is a species of organism resembling hedgehogs, that appear to be composed of dark wood and covered with sharp spines. They are capable of these spines at velocities sufficient to penetrate several centimetres of wood. (Exact depth varies depending on species of plant). The organisms do not appear to require food and cannot reproduce. Any tree penetrated by a spine from SCP-299-1 will undergo a radical change by means of an unknown mechanism, eventually becoming a specimen of SCP-299-2. Members of SCP-299-1 will actively try to spread this infestation, and will launch their spines at anything they perceive as a threat.

After a few minutes, a tree which has been exposed to a spine from SCP-299-1 will begin to lose its leaves.  Over the next two (2) to five (5) hours, all branches less than roughly 5 metres from ground level will begin to shift downward to a height of roughly 1 metre from the ground plus or minus 18 cm, where they will stick out from the trunk at angles of 78 to 102 degrees, with their length often greatly reduced and their ends noticeably sharpened. All branches more than 5 metres from ground level will shift upwards, coming to rest at approximately 7 metres above the ground.  These branches will connect with neighbouring trees, spreading the infestation and eventually creating a thick web 7 metres above the ground. The tree's roots will begin to shift upwards to about 8 centimetres below the surface, and large structures that resemble leaves will begin to grow from them, settling horizontally until they cover most of the surface. These leaves are, on average, 32 cm long and 26 cm wide. Each leaf is covered with black tendrils resembling the legs of very large insects. During this process the tree's wood will blacken considerably.

Specimens of SCP-299-2 will release chemicals that cause heightened paranoia and aggression in most animals, including humans. The effect of this chemical often causes groups to split up and wander around in the forest alone, where they will likely pass through an infested area. When an organic object comes into contact with a leaf from SCP-299-2 the tendrils on the leaf will hold on to the object tightly and and move it to an infested tree. If the object is large enough it will be impaled on one of the branches, where it will be slowly consumed by a root-like structure sprouting from the branch.  Objects too small for this will be gradually pressed into the bark and incorporated into the tree.  In 35% of cases the resulting tumescence will burst open to reveal new specimens of SCP-299-1.
