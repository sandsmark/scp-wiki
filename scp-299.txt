**Item #:** SCP-299

**Object Class:** Keter


**Special Containment Procedures:** A small forest (roughly 200 metre in diameter) of SCP-299 is to be contained in an underground biodome in Area-299 in the [REDACTED] desert. Any other specimen encountered are to be incinerated. No plant life is to come into contact with SCP-299 outside of controlled testing under any circumstances. Areas infested by SCP-299 should be considered class-8 (Chance of death higher than 95%) hazard zones, and any area in which SCP-299 infestation has been confirmed is to be firebombed immediately and monitored for four (4) weeks. Any further infestation is to be incinerated, as well as all wildlife present on the site.

**Description:** SCP-299 appears to be a species of tree, characterised by branches which end in sharp points and very dark wood. Closer inspection reveals that SCP-299 occurs in networks, each "tree" being connected to neighbouring trees.  An instance of SCP-299 will spread it's roots, and a tree of any species which comes into prolonged contact with the roots of SCP-299 will be converted into another instance of SCP-299. SCP-299 appears to be incapable of reproducing in any way other than by spreading its infection.

**Addendum 299-1:** SCP-299 infection will result from prolonged contact with any material from SCP-299.


After a few minutes, a tree which has been infected by SCP-299 will begin to lose its leaves.  Over the next two (2) to five (5) hours, the branches of the infected tree will begin to shift.  Most low branches will shift downward to a height of anywhere from 30 to 100 centimetres, and taper to a point.

**Addendum 299-2:** Microscopic analysis of low lying branches has revealed that these points are incredibly sharp, composed of a substance similar to human bone, and taper fractally to the atomic level.  Direct contact with the point of a branch from SCP-299 is unadvised, as the tip could [DATA EXPUNGED].

Higher-laying branches will retain their leaves, and shift toward the top of the tree, forming a dense canopy.  From overhead, an infestation of SCP-299 will not appear to have changed the forest.

Vine-like tendrils will grow upward from the roots of SCP-299, reaching heights of up to 2 m. These tendrils appear to be prehensile and elastic, as organic objects coming within close proximity to these tendrils will be violently seized by them, and impaled upon the lower branches.  Impaled objects will gradually be converted on the molecular level and incorporated into the tree.

Specimens of SCP-299 will release chemicals that cause heightened paranoia and aggression in most animals, including humans. The effect of this chemical often causes groups to split up and wander around in the forest alone, where they will likely pass through an infested area.

**Addendum 299-3:** Examination of material harvested from SCP-299 reveals that the "wood" is similar in composition to [DATA EXPUNGED].  A single cell from SCP-299 will retain its infectious nature, and is capable of reconfiguring an entire organism upon introduction.
