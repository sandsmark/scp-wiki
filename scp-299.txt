**Item #:** SCP-299

**Object Class:** Keter


**Special Containment Procedures:** A small forest (roughly 200 meter in diameter) of SCP-299 is to be contained in an underground biodome in Area-299 in the [REDACTED] desert. Any other specimen encountered are to be incinerated. No plant life  is to come into contact with SCP-299-1 outside of controlled testing under any circumstances. Areas infested by SCP-299-2 should be considered class-8 (Chance of death higher than 95%) hazard zones. Any area in which SCP-299-1 infestation has been confirmed is to be firebombed immediately and monitored for four (4) weeks. Any further infestation is to be incinerated, as well as all wildlife present on the site.

**Description:** SCP-299-1 is an species of organisms of unknown origin resembling hedgehogs made out of dark wood. The hedgehogs are capable of launching some of their spikes at sufficiently high velocity to penetrate through several centimeters of living wood (Exact depth varies depending on species of plant). The organisms do not appear to need food and cannot replicate normally. Any tree penetrated by a spike of SCP-299-1 will start to radically change by an unknown mechanism, eventually becoming a specimen of SCP-299-2. Members of SCP-299-1 will actively try to spread this infestation, and are capable of launching their spikes at anything they perceive as a threat, but are otherwise harmless on their own.

Once a tree has been infested by SCP-299-1, it will drop all leaves over a period of two (2) to five (5) hours. After approximately 94% of the leaves have been dropped, all branches less than roughly 5 meters from ground level will start shifting downward to height of roughly 1 meter from the ground plus or minus 18 cm, where they will stick out from the trunk at angles of 78 to 102 degrees, with their length often greatly reduced and their ends noticeably sharpened. All branches more than roughly 5 meters from ground level will shift to either the top of the tree or to a level of about 7 meters, whichever is lower. Half of branches at that height will stick upwards and the other half will connect with neighboring trees, spreading the infestation and eventually creating a thick web 7 meters above the ground. During this process the tree's wood will blacken considerably. 

The tree's root system will then start shifting upwards to about 8 cm under the surface, and large leaf-like structures will grow towards the surface from them, where they will settle horizontally until they cover most of the surface. These leaves are, on average, 32 cm long and 26 cm wide. Each leaf is covered with black tendrils resembling the legs of very large insects. At this point the transformation into SCP-299-2 is complete.

All specimens SCP-299-2 will release chemicals that cause heightened paranoia and aggression in most animals, including humans. Often causing groups to split up and wander around in the forest alone, where they will likely pass through an infested area. Whenever an organic object comes into contact with a leaf of SCP-299-2 the tendrils on the leaf will hold on to the object tightly and and move it to an infested tree. If the object is large enough it will be impaled on one of the branches, where it will be slowly consumed by root-like structure sprouting from the branch.  Objects too small for this well be gradually pressed into the bark until it is roughly halfway absorbed, and will then be incorporated into the tree. 4 out of every 11 of these objects will eventually burst open to reveal a new specimen of SCP-299-1. 

**Addendum 299-1:** Those with sufficient clearance may request access to document-299-1 for details on the retrieval of SCP-299.

**Addendum 299-2:** Those with sufficient clearance may request access to[REDACTED] for details on the weaponisation of SCP-299
