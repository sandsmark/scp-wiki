**Item #:** SCP-299

**Object Class:** Keter


**Special Containment Procedures:** A small forest (roughly 200 metre in diameter) of SCP-299 is to be contained in an underground biodome in Area-299 in the [REDACTED] desert. Any other specimen encountered are to be incinerated. No plant life is to come into contact with SCP-299 outside of controlled testing under any circumstances. Areas infested by SCP-299 should be considered class-8 (Chance of death higher than 95%) hazard zones, and any area in which SCP-299 infestation has been confirmed is to be firebombed immediately and monitored for four (4) weeks. Any further infestation is to be incinerated, as well as all wildlife present on the site.

**Description:** SCP-299 appears to be a species of tree, characterised by branches which end in sharp points and very dark wood. Closer inspection reveals that SCP-299 occurs in networks, each "tree" being connected to neighbouring trees.  An instance of SCP-299 will spread it's roots, and a tree of any species which comes into prolonged contact with the roots of SCP-299 will be converted into another instance of SCP-299. SCP-299 appears to be incapable of reproducing in any way other than by spreading its infection.

**Addendum 299-1:** SCP-299 infection will result from prolonged contact with any material from SCP-299.


The time taken for the transformation varies depending on the size of the organism. After a few minutes, a tree which has been infected by SCP-299 will begin to lose its leaves, the branches of the infected tree will begin to shift.  Most low branches will shift downward to a height of anywhere from 30 to 100 centimetres, and taper to a point.

**Addendum 299-2:** Microscopic analysis of low lying branches has revealed that these points are incredibly sharp, composed of a substance similar to human bone, and taper fractally to the atomic level.  Direct contact with the point of a branch from SCP-299 is unadvised.

Higher-laying branches will retain their leaves, and shift toward the top of the tree, forming a dense canopy.  From overhead, an infestation of SCP-299 will not appear to have changed the forest.

Vine-like tendrils will grow upward from the roots of SCP-299, reaching heights of up to 2 m. These tendrils appear to be prehensile and elastic, as organic objects coming within close proximity to these tendrils will be violently seized by them, and impaled upon the lower branches.  Impaled objects will gradually be converted on the molecular level and incorporated into the tree.

Specimens of SCP-299 will release chemicals that cause heightened paranoia and aggression in most animals, including humans. The effect of this chemical often causes groups to split up and wander around in the forest alone, where they will likely pass through an infested area.

**Addendum 299-3:** Examination of material harvested from SCP-299 reveals that the "wood" is very brittle, and similar in composition to [DATA EXPUNGED].  A single cell from SCP-299 will retain its infectious nature, and is capable of reconfiguring an entire organism upon introduction.

**Experiment Log-299-1**


**Item:** Maple seedling //(Acer saccharum)// (x1)
**Researcher:** Dr. ██████████
**Test Record:** 
A sample of matter from SCP-299 is introduced to seedling.  Over the next 45 minutes, the seedling is completely converted into a specimen of SCP-299, retaining its height and approximate size.  Seedling was incinerated.



**Item:** Oak tree //(Quercus alba)// (x1)
**Researcher:** Dr. ██████████
**Test Record**
Oak tree transplanted into containment area of SCP-299.  Over the next 3 hours, the tree is completely converted into a specimen of SCP-299, retaining its height and approximate size.   Matter taken from new specimen is consistent with matter from neighbouring specimens.


**Item:** Sunflower //(Helianthus annuus)// (x1)
**Researcher:** Dr. ██████████
**Test Record:**
A sample of matter from SCP-299 is introduced to sunflower.  Over the next 10 minutes, the plant is completely converted into a specimen of SCP-299, retaining its height and size.  The flower petals have blackened and tapered into spikes, consistent with SCP-299 spike branches.  Tendrils are frail and incapable of grasping large objects.  Specimen's trunk snapped upon introduction of researcher's foot.  Remains incinerated.



**Item:** European Grape Vine //(Vitis vinifera)//, confined to pot and growing up along a trellace. (x1)
**Researcher**: Dr. ██████████
**Test Record:**
Sample of matter from SCP-299 introduced to grape vine.  Subject converted over the next 30 minutes.  Subject detaches from trellace and adopts prehensile nature of SCP-299 tendrils.  Spike protrudes from rooted area.



**Item:** Results of previous experiment, pig //(Sus domestica)// (x1)
**Researcher**: Dr. ██████████
**Test Record:**
Pig introduced to testing area.  Subject showed signs of agitation.  Upon investigation of SCP-299, subject was violently seized and constricted, eventually suffocating, before impalement upon spike.  Specimen was left in containment and observed for 3 days.  Over that time, the mass of pig and tendril tissues was converted into the trunk of SCP-299, and spikes grew from its base; the roots extended heavily, and tendrils grew from them; and branches grew from the top of the tree, sprouting buds and leaves.  Specimen was incinerated.

//Notes://
SCP-299 appears not to be limited to trees, and infected plants seem to react slightly differently, depending on their unique biology.  All specimens, however, seem to eventually become SCP-299 "trees", if given time to grow and change form.



**Item:** Venus Flytrap //(Dionaea muscipula)// (x1)
**Researcher:** Dr. ██████████
**Test Record** 
[DATA EXPUNGED]


**Addendum 299-4**
**O5 Command has requested that researchers refrain from experimentation with carnivorous plants.**


 
**Item:** Pig //(Sus domestica)// (x1)
**Researcher:** Dr. ██████████
**Test Record** 
Matter from SCP-299 injected into pig.  Pig began squealing and running around uncontrollably, until it fell to the ground and seized, twitching.  Upon expiration, fine rootlike hairs were observed to grow from the bottom (in terms of orientation) of the pig, and the flesh of the pig began to undergo change to SCP-299 starting from point of injection.  After 2 hours, the pig was observed to have become another instance of SCP-299, complete with tendrils and leaves.
