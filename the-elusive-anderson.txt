++ Series Overview:
The individual or group known as Anderson has long been a very minor, if not very annoying, thorn in the Foundation’s side. Primarily dealers of anomalous robotics and biomechanics, they have consistently avoided capture through both the nimbleness offered by the small size of their operation and an apparently vast network of connections with other groups and individuals of interest. 

Following the acquisition of promising information from a former patron of Anderson, MTF Gamma-13 “Asimov's Lawbringers”, prepares to launch the largest sting against Anderson to date at great risk to not only their own credibility, but to several months of meticulous planning. However, the task force soon learns that with great risk often comes great reward…
