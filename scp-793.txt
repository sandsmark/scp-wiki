**Item #:** SCP-793

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Zone of Denial (Current):** 43.952 feet (11.396 meters)

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-793 is to be marked with stakes marking vertices of the SCP-793's "Zone of Denial" (any important vertices of a //43.952 feet// (//11.396 meters//) hypothetical extrusion of the architecture, then a second set of stakes (the same as the "Zone of Denial", except of a //150 feet// (//45.72 meters//) architecture extrusion, to be regarded as the "Restricted Zone"). The stakes are to have signs emplaced on them to not enter this area without Level 2 SCP authorization in English, French, Swahili, Luba-Kasai, Kinkogo, and Luganda. Class D SCP authorization required to Restricted Zone enterance. Future installment of security cameras placed on the hospital may be of consideration.

**Description:** SCP-793 (//"The Ghost Sickness"//) is described as a hyper-reproductive paranormal variation of Human Congo trypanosomiasis (a parasitic protozoa also known as the //"African Sleeping Sickness"//) inhabiting the abandonded ████████ ██████ Medicinal Center located in [DATA EXPUNGED] (Built by ███████ missionaries in 18██). SCP-793's first documentation was recorded in 19██. The hospital was subsequently relinquished █ years afterwards due to exponential augmentation of SCP-793, but was never demolished out of superstition from the prominent █████ and ████████ tribes (that still exist today) who generally were the most populous peoples in the area. As of 19██, the hospital has been secured by the Foundation. SCP-793, passively, does not appear to exist unless a suitable host (i.e. a human) has entered the Zone of Denial (designated under same name in above Containment procedures), which is (currently) regarded as //43.952 feet// (//13.396 meters//) from any architecture of the hospital. 

SCP-793 does not exist (or at least appear to) When a human enters the zone of denial, the trypanosomiasis will appear spontaneously inside the human's circulatory system (much unlike the trypanosomiasis' original with limited reproductive capability. The reproductive capability is enhanced on a human's increased proximity to the hospital architecture. On enterance to the zone of denial, very few trypanosomiasis cells will appear and reproduce at ≈5% the speed of Human Congo trypanosomiasis, but inside the architecture (where reproductive capability is at a constant), they will reproduce at ≈370% the speed of their cousin.

Symptoms appear to be similar to normal Congo trypanosomiasis, with a notable increase in hysteria and swelling of the lymph nodes. To be noted is the absolute opposite occurs when leaving the zone of denial. The reproductive rate decreases, and parasites will spontaneously dissapear (no signs of cell death are visible), and somatic cells whose deaths can be attributed to SCP-793 will appear impromptu (whose origination suddenly occurs, not as of the result of general somatic mitosis). The symptoms fade to earlier stages, (from the neurological phase going to the haemolypmathic stage, etc.) and there are no signs of the virus existing once a human victim exits the zone of denial.

A final notation about possible human death as the result of SCP-793's actions - the "reversal effects" do reverse victim death, in totality. Once  a dead victim is rescued from the maximum reproductive zone, somatic cells appear immediatly and remaining parisites are removed from existence. Upon so-called //"undeath"//, individuals recall extreme pain in their bodily reconstruction (mostly regarded as something along the lines //"thousands of knives peircing his/her body"//) and no recollection of ever entering the zone of denial or any knowledge of SCP-793.

SCP-793's reversal effects only regard any damage only it creates to a human. Bodies whose deaths are attributed to other causes (such as normal Human Congo trypanosomiasis), will not be affected. SCP-793 --does not seem to appear on anything that is not a living human body entering the zone of denial-- does not appear on anything that is not living human tissue. Appearance of SCP-793 does occur on partial entrance of a human to the zone of denial and is limited to the fraction of the human that is in the zone of denial.

Items brought out of the Hospital have no unique effect attached to them.

**Addendum SCP-793:XOJ1:** __**REGARDING SITE DEMOLITION OF SCP-793 VIA ███ ████████**__
^^As suggested by Dr. William Hunt and Chong Meng, Ph. D.^^
^^Date/Time: [DATA EXPUNGED]^^

> The ████████ ██████ Medicinal Center, otherwise known as the residence of the infamous SCP-793 specimen, has had been subject to the possibility that we will exterminate it (proposals generally suggest a wide variety of explosive  materials, typically ███-based compounds. Controversy over the expungement of Euclid-class SCP specimens has always been a topic of discussion with Foundation personnel ever since the SCP's foundation, SCP-793 being one such example. The general consensus about Euclid-class expungement appears to regard SCP-793 as "Not to be demolished", and we agree, albeit there has been still some controversy over the topic. A summary of our reasoning for our anti-793 expungement 'opinion' follows: 
>
> ------
>
> **A)** SCP-793 really poses no real threat. No permanent death has occurred from the actions of the ghost trypanosomiasis.
> **B)** The hospital's architectural structure appears to be continually sturdy and shows no signs of serious decay, suggesting structural invulnerability. We don't think this should be tested, though! ;)
> **C)** As reference to the consensus, we have no knowledge of what would happen on attempted destruction of the hospital.
> **D)** Angering of the close-by tribes in the area.
>
> ------
>
> We also would like to talk about possible de-elevation of SCP-793 from "Euclid" to "Safe", if that's possible.

**Addendum SCP-793:OR51:** __**REGARDING ZONE OF DENIAL FLUCTUATION**__
^^Reported by Mark Fulu via E-Mail, Adapted for better understanding[[footnote]]Mark Fulu has limited capability of speaking English, so his messages had to be adapted to be more understandable (somewhat)[[/footnote]]^^

> [It] seems [that] a few of the test[s into Zone of Denial] have found that [the] bound[a]ry is far [further away] th[a]n what it was [used to be], not know what do??? [I don't know what to do about this?]
^^Date/Time: [DATA TEMPORARILY EXPUNGED UNTIL INVESTIGATION]^^

> [H]elp [I] not know what [to] do, the thing [the Zone of Denial keeps] changing.
^^Date/Time: [DATA TEMPORARILY EXPUNGED UNTIL INVESTIGATION]^^

> [P]le[a]se help, it [the Zone of Denial] is growing bigger and bigger and bigger now!!!
^^Date/Time: [DATA TEMPORARILY EXPUNGED UNTIL INVESTIGATION]^^


Repeated similar messages from Mark Fulu and other personell stationed in the area has brought intrigued investigation by SCP Authority in North America. SCP-793 is now pending for confirmation of Zone of Denial distance fluctuation.
