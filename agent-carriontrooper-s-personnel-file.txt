**Notes about Subject:**
Agent Carrion Trooper was found walking around Site-██ while wearing a flak jacket and civilian clothes. When subject is about to be terminated, he managed to disable some of our security personnel, while all the time muttering that this was a mistake. Eventually we were able to negotiate with him and discover what his intentions are. His reason of breaking in Site-██ was because he 'could not find the receptionist, and besides, it's an effective way to show you what I got to offer'. He is in complete support of the organization, and is found to have no connections with forbidden or highly dangerous organizations. After assessing his skills, we decided that he should be assigned to undercover duty in his hometown of █████████, Indonesia. So far he has located some SCPs with aid from his intelligence sources, and proved to be a useful agent on the field. From time to time we will contact him for field duty. 

**ADDITIONAL NOTE(S):**

-It seems that Agent Carrion Trooper has a mutated strain of SCP-008 in his blood. How it got there is unknown, and when informed of this, he just shrugs it off. "I don't know how it got there either, but it's best this way... it doen't do any harm, does it?" Agent Carrion Trooper afterwords decided on his codename. Some research may be done in regards on using the mutated SCP-008 strain as a counter agent to SCP-008 (//approval pending//).

**SCPs Acquired:**
[[[SCP-494]]]
[[[SCP-684]]]
[[[SCP-741]]]

**Note:** That's the cover story anyways. In reality, ''Carrion Trooper' is Ed Bates, Site 17 janitor. Thanks to a bet between Bright and Kondraki, he is being reconditioned to believe this about himself. The officially stated reason is that 'it'll have to be good for something, somewhere down the line.'

**Note:** Further background checks reveal that there is no personnel named 'Ed Bates' in Site 17. We are absolutely in the dark about this. Document has been checked for corruption involving SCP-███, but after extensive testing there is no evidence of corruption.
