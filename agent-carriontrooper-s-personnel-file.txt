**Personal history:**
Subject was born on [DATA EXPUNGED], and became a [DATA EXPUNGED] while still in college. After finishing college, he was [DATA EXPUNGED].
Subject was recruited by the Foundation after subject gave information that lead to the acquirement of SCP-494 by discreet means. Subject has since operated under the Asian Branch of the foundation and irregularly submits possible SCP information. Since the subject had shown abberant behavior prior to his recruitment, subject was implanted with an experimental agression inhibitor by Dr. ████████ (approved by O5-█). It is also noted that subject had only recently recovered from a memetic condition caused by accidental contact with SCP-███, leading him to believe that he was infected with a strain of SCP-008, and causing significant annoyance to fellow Foundation employees. It is unclear whether this recovery was caused by his recent disciplinary sentence (assigned as a nursemaid to SCP-590) or by any other factors.

**SCPs Acquired:**
[[[SCP-494]]]
[[[SCP-684]]]
[[[SCP-741]]]

**Personal note:**
//Guys, I'm terribly sorry about what had happened before... I hope that nothing of value was lost during my reckless rampage. I will still serve the Foundation loyally (and any sentences they gave me... that 590 guy took my sickness away). I hope I'm not as annoying as before, but that could be a little hard... For starters, who wants BBQ?//
