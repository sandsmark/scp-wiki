**Notes about Subject:**
Agent CarrionTrooper was found walking around Site-██ while wearing a flak jacket and civilian clothes. When subject is about to be terminated, he managed to disable some of our security personnel, while all the time muttering that this was a mistake. Eventually we were able to negotiate with him and discover what his intentions are. His reason of breaking in Site-██ was because he 'could not find the receptionist, and besides, it's an effective way to show you what I got to offer'. He is in complete support of the organization, and is found to have no connections with forbidden or highly dangerous organizations. After assessing his skills, we decided that he should be assigned to undercover duty in his hometown of █████████, Indonesia. So far he has located some SCPs with aid from his intelligence sources, and proved to be a useful agent on the field. From time to time we will contact him for field duty. 

**ADDITIONAL NOTE(S):**


**SCPs Acquired:**
SCP-494
