+++ __**History**__
{{Dr. MacWarren was drafted in by the Foundation after the publication of his work involving dimensional abstractions and spacetime supersymmetry and its general applications to the development of emerging technologies. Initially hesitant, Dr. MacWarren eventually warmed up to the idea of the Foundation recruitment drive as a recognition of his abilities and intelligence.}}

{{While under the Foundation, Dr. MacWarren was host to an anomalous entity that followed him at all times and wherever he went. While most staff feared and were disturbed by the being's presence, Dr. MacWarren did not pay much attention to the entity and did not appear to be concerned by it.}}

{{A former marine, Dr. MacWarren retired early to focus on his studies as the Marine Corps. was quote "very mean to me."}}

[[include :scp-sandbox-3:image-blur name=Mochi.JPG|caption={{Viewer discretion is advised.}}|width=300px|align=right]]
{{While the entity was initially deemed a danger to Foundation personnel, Dr. MacWarren elected to confront the anomaly by himself; figuring that the entity wanted something from him as it kept on following him around.}}

{{Eventually, the entity was later captured by Dr. MacWarren himself and used as his personal assistant in matters concerning his work.}}
