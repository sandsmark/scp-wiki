**Item #:** SCP-2590

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment of SCP-2590 itself is not currently possible. SCP-2590 has remained within the city limits of Birmingham, Alabama since it has been under Foundation surveillance. SCP-2590 is fitted with a tracking beacon pinging its location to onboard computers operated by operatives of MTF Gamma-133 "Steet Sweepers".

Public knowledge of SCP-2590's existence is to be contained by confiscation of video footage and photographs, and administration of Class-A amnestics to eyewitnesses. Two plainclothed members of Mobile Task Force Gamma-133 "Street Sweepers" are to trail SCP-2590 in a Foundation-provided civilian vehicle at all times, exchanging shifts with another pair of operators every 4 hours. Vehicles are to be equipped with dashboard video cameras, which are to be recording at all times.

In the event SCP-2590 comes to a stop, the pursuing operatives are to park directly behind SCP-2590 with a full view of the trailer door and notify the active situation room commander of MTF Gamma-133 "Street Sweepers" immediately. The operative occupying the passenger's side of the vehicle is to take written notes of his/her observations. 

**Description:** SCP-2590 is a semi-trailer truck of an unknown make, with an attached trailer. It lacks a license plate on either the front or rear bumper. Observation of the driver's cabin shows a humanoid figure in the driver's seat, designated SCP-2590-1. SCP-2590-1's appearance is that of a shadow or silhouette, lacking any identifying physical features. SCP-2590-1's significance to the function of SCP-2590 is currently unknown, as it has ignored all attempts at communication from Foundation agents. SCP-2590 selectively interacts with tangible matter, allowing it to 'pass through' physical matter.

At times determined by unknown variables[[footnote]]The shortest observed time between instances was 37 seconds, while the longest was 4 months, 8 days, 3 hours, 14 minutes and 45 seconds.[[/footnote]], SCP-2590 will park itself at the side of the road or in a parking lot, and the trailer door will open of its own accord for exactly sixty seconds before closing again. During the time the door is open, the interior will be occupied by a single object. The object within the trailer is different each time the door closes and opens again. Each instance is unique, and no object has ever been observed twice. 

It is not clear if any of the objects shown inside SCP-2590's trailer are creations of SCP-2590, or simply visual illusions. Attempts at entry into SCP-2590 while the trailer is open have been met with failure, as an invisible barrier prevents entry.

Presented in chronological order are objects observed inside SCP-2590 since it came under Foundation surveillance:

|| #1 || Chocolate candy bar, Kit Kat Chunky brand. ||
|| #2 || Small cardboard box, labelled "Jim's Colectibles"[sic] with black marker.||
|| #3 || Blank polaroid photograph. ||
|| #4 || VHS tape, unlabelled. ||
|| #5 || Smartphone, iPhone 4 model. ||
|| #6 || Human male, approximately 30 years of age. During observation the subject showed considerable distress, attempting several times to escape SCP-2590. Attempts at communication with the on duty agents were reported by them to be inaudible. All escape attempts failed due to the unseen barrier, and the door closed before further measures could be taken.||
|| #7 || Red apple. ||
|| #8 || Large silver sphere, with no features or identifying marks. The object hovered approximately 0.5 metres above the floor of the trailer through unknown means. ||
|| #9 || Lit lightbulb. There was no visible power source inside the trailer, and it is unknown how the object was able to function. ||
|| #10 || Human male of approximately 11 years of age. Subject appeared to be stricken with panic. Attempts at communication were unsuccessful. Subject was reported to have not attempted escape from SCP-2590, with Agent Orpik stating in his report that the subject was 'paralyzed with fear'. ||
|| #11 || Human female of approximately 40 years of age. Subject recognized Agent Inglis, who identified the subject as her sister. Agent Inglis was said by her partner, Agent Schultz, to be in considerable distress. Efforts to recover subject from SCP-2590 failed. Soon after, Agent Inglis' sister was found at home, unharmed, and said that she had been cleaning at the time of the incident. She denied that she had been anywhere else during that time. ||
|| #12 || Human male, identified as Agent Moore. Of note is that Agent Moore was on duty with Agent Hall at the time of this instance. Moore was said by his partner to be 'puzzled and shocked'. Subject inside SCP-2590 also appeared to recognize his duplicate outside of the instance. Attempts to extract the subject once again failed. ||
|| #13 'Incident 2590-1' || Eyeball of an unknown species, measuring approximately 2 metres in diameter. Agents Killorn and Hayes were on duty at the time, and video footage shows the object rotate 180 degrees to view them. Both agents reported a feeling of intense uneasiness and nausea, followed by sharp abdominal pain once SCP-2590's door closed. Following their shift, the agents were sent for medical evaluation, where X-Ray examinations revealed potentially malignant tumors growing inside the agent's large intestines. Surgery was successful in removing these growths, and both agents have since made full recoveries. ||
|| #14 || Human female identified using dashboard camera footage as Dr. █████. Subject attempted an unsuccessful escape through the open doorway. Subject tried to communicate with on duty agents Hall and Orpik, without success. Subject tried to converse using sign language, but neither agent could understand her due to lack of training. The real Dr. █████ was found to be in the break room in Site-██ at the time of this instance. ||
|| #15 || Human male identified as O5-██. [DATA EXPUNGED] ||
|| #16 'Incident 2590-2' || Large steel slab, the front face of which appeared to fit the dimensions of the doorway perfectly as to eliminate visibility of the interior of SCP-2590. The slab displayed the logo of the Foundation. 16 seconds into the instance, copious amounts of blood began to drip downward from the top of the object. It continued to pour until the slab was no longer visible, with liquid welling up at the unseen barrier. At 0:52 of the instance, the slab and an immense amount of blood (almost the entire volume of the trailer) launched out of SCP-2590. The object travelled toward observing agents Inglis and Schultz at a speed of approximately 190 kilometers per hour. Six members of MTF Gamma-133 "Street Sweepers" were deployed to the scene to investigate and initiate cleanup efforts. Inglis and Schultz were pronounced dead at the scene. A two kilometre perimeter in every direction was estabilished, and Class-A amnestics were administered to every individual within it. ||

**Addendum A:** 
> Subsequent DNA tests on the blood ejected from SCP-2590 have indicated it to be roughly 50% Inglis' and 50% Schultz's. The steel slab, which was undamaged from the collision with the agents' vehicle, has been taken into Foundation custody for lab analysis.
