<br>
You're very lucky to get this.<br />
I can think of a dozen who are better but you were selected. You're special now.<br />
Are you ready to go?<br />
<br>
<br>
    <div id="secondCollapsible"><a href="#" onClick="showHide('secondText');">>Yes</a></div>
    <div id="secondText" style="display: none;">
<br>
<br>
Here's a jacket. It's going to be a long drive, and I don't have any control of the air in my car.<br />
Actually, before we go, can you help me?.<br />
I've hurt my back, and I can't lift things like I used to.<br />
A toolbox has to come out of the trunk, if the car breaks down I can keep it on for repair.<br />
Grab it for me.<br />
Please? <br /> 
<br>
<br>
    <div id="thirdCollapsible"><a href="#" onClick="showHide('thirdText');">>Yes</a></div>
    <div id="thirdText" style="display: none;">
<br>
<br>
I'm sorry.<br />
Trust me when I say that it's better for you this way.<br />
If you had to sit here and watch things, then you would have a very bad time.<br />
That's not something you need to worry about now.<br />
Soon it's all going to be old hat anyways.<br />
It's all going to grow on you. Can you feel it?<br />
<br>
<br>
<div id="fourthCollapsible"><a href="#" onClick="showHide('fourthText');">>Yes</a></div>
    <div id="fourthText" style="display: none;">
<br>
<br>
You were ready for us, weren't you.<br />
The Factory can make up for everything. You're going to be learning all over again, as we train your body and mind. You weren't going in a good direction in your life. We know when people are dead end drivers. We make them special. Nobody is going to miss you.<br />
You don't believe me? They never do. But then once nobody comes for you...<br />
Do you still think you're special?<br />
<br>
<br>
<div id="fifthCollapsible"><a href="#" onClick="showHide('fifthText');">>Yes</a></div>
    <div id="fifthText" style="display: none;">
<br>
<br>
You're learning now.<br />
It's time to get out. We're going inside. It's going to get hot, I'm sorry.<br />
Don't be mad, but I didn't tell you something. You're going to have to crawl further to get out.<br />
Tighter now. Straight on and keep going down.<br />
Aren't you going to do it?<br />
<br>
<br>
<div id="sixthCollapsible"><a href="#" onClick="showHide('sixthText');">>Yes</a></div>
    <div id="sixthText" style="display: none;">
<br>
<br>
Sweating. Get used to it. We like to keep things running hot around the clock.
<br />
Watch yourself, follow the sound of my voice. I can tell you're getting close.<br />
<br />
Keep crawling. Just breathe. It's okay if you have to let it out. You won't be soiled or drowned. Just get everything out.<br />
That's it.<br />
You can rest for awhile. Life isn't easy but you're doing ever so well.<br />
I'm proud of you<br />
Are you feeling better?<br />
<br>
<br>
<div id="seventhCollapsible"><a href="#" onClick="showHide('seventhText');">>Yes</a></div>
    <div id="seventhText" style="display: none;">
<br>
<br>
Welcome. You've made it.<br />
Your trials have only begun, my friend. But we're happy to have you on board<br />
Standing by yourself feels good, I agree. And you've grown so much since I last saw you, it's very impressive.<br />
I take back what I said before. I can see why you made it over the rest.<br />
We're ready to take you down to the production floor, so you'll have to walk again. Don't feel self-conscious, we're all like this.<br />
It's just one of the many things we have in common.<br />
We all have too many of our father's tendencies.<br />
Can you walk with us now?<br />
<br>
<br>
<div id="eighthCollapsible"><a href="#" onClick="showHide('eighthText');">>Yes</a></div>
    <div id="eighthText" style="display: none;">
<br>
<br>
Watch your step.<br />
I can tell that you can see it now. Your eyes are seeing distance for the first time. We're really making it all. They need us to keep it coming. Churning time around its clock to keep the production schedules on time.<br />
We take on traits, going back and forth. Some parts are old, some parts can stay young or get younger.<br />
Sometimes it's fixes but we can always get more broken.<br />
They'll find a way to get you to work.<br />
You're going to be able to do anything you want if you work hard and keep it up.<br />
Do you want to stay?<br />
<br>
<br>
<div id="ninthCollapsible"><a href="#" onClick="showHide('ninthText');">>Yes</a></div>
    <div id="ninthText" style="display: none;">
<br>
<br>
I'm impressed.<br />
Machinery seems to come naturally to you.<br />
Congratulations, that means it's no longer just watching.<br />
The Factory sees something inside of you.<br />
Will you let it in?<br />
<br>
<br>
<div id="10Collapsible"><a href="#" onClick="showHide('10Text');">>Yes</a></div>
    <div id="10Text" style="display: none;">
<br>
<br>
That's right. This is a natural thing, we can open your mouth and scream.<br />
Will you be getting more like you?<br />
<br>
<br>
<div id="11Collapsible"><a href="#" onClick="showHide('11Text');">>Yes</a></div>
    <div id="11Text" style="display: none;">
<br>
<br>
Conformity and monotony have great benefits.<br />
When we all work together, we can support each other. We have made so much out of you. More than that, you have done so much with your self. Unbound, you live in the pieces among the whirling gears and presses.<br />
You're making more than you ever did before.<br />
All of the living pieces of you are depending on that work to stay in place.<br />
You don't want to slide down into the deep hurting.<br />
Coming back?<br />
<br>
<br>
<div id="12Collapsible"><a href="#" onClick="showHide('12Text');">>No</a></div>
    <div id="12Text" style="display: none;">
<br>
<br>
<div style="border-style: solid; background-color: #e6e6e6; font-size:20; border-width: medium; border-color: red; padding: 10px;">

Don't lie to me. When you make your bed, you lay in it. You're going nowhere soon.
