**Item #:** SCP-912

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** 

SCP-912 is to be kept at Research Unit ██ in a standard containment cell. The cell door must have a damage resistance rating of 3A or above. Direct physical handling of SCP-912 causes a potentially dangerous reaction and should be avoided except as part of an authorised testing protocol.

All researchers involved in SCP-912 must receive briefing SCP-912-001A (“Safe Handling of SCP-912”) and SCP-912-001B (“Dealing with ‘Arrest’ Behaviour by SCP-912”).  In the event of “arrest” by SCP-912, researchers are to offer minimal resistance and await rescue by an associate wearing the uniform of the ██PD.

Experiments that involve the use of firearms or the CQ firing range require authorisation from Dr ███████ at least 24hrs in advance in order to permit route clearance and schedule deconfliction.

**Description:** 

SCP-912 refers to a collection of police-issue body armour, clothing and equipment that has developed the capacity for independent movement and action. The means by which this ability has been acquired or the method by which it is achieved has yet to be identified. SCP-912 conforms to the standards of uniform worn by the ██PD SWAT. Uniform elements float in mid-air as though worn by a man or woman around 6'1" in height, but no such presence can be detected. SCP-912 does not directly respond to communication attempts, but will follow simple orders in English given by personnel wearing the uniform of an officer of the ██PD.

SCP-912 consists of the following:

* One dark gray ██PD ballistic helmet with transparent face-protecting visor.
* One black Nomex®  tactical balaclava from unknown manufacturer.
* One set navy blue ██PD ████████ Tactical Body Armor from ███████ Armor, Ltd. SWAT insignia printed upon front and back.
 * Includes several ammo/grenade/storage pouches (all apparently empty, though SCP-912 resists inspection).
 * One pouch contains "PlastiCuff" restraints. Supply seems to remain constant regardless of "arrests" made.
* One pair of black knee pads from ██████ Armor Ltd.
* One pair of black elbow pads from ██████ Armor Ltd.
* One pair of █████-███ steel toe-capped combat boots from unknown manufacturer.
* One pair of black combat gloves by ███ Armor Ltd.
* Closed and fastened pistol holster suitable for a mid-sized sidearm.
* One 21" telescopic steel baton. Handle is apparently made from hardened plastic with a textured grip.

Upon detection of an armed individual NOT wearing the uniform of the ██PD , SCP-912 will commence “arrest” behaviour. SCP-912 will attempt to disarm and secure the armed subject, and any other non-uniformed personnel in the vicinity. Once it has commenced, the verbal command “STAND DOWN” given in a firm tone of voice by personnel wearing a ██PD uniform is the only way to interrupt "arrest" behavior. SCP-912 only permits an individual it has "arrested" to be removed from its presence by a person wearing this uniform. An individual wearing the appropriate uniform is ignored by SCP-912 regardless of armament.

Force used by SCP-912 during arrest behaviour will increase in proportion to resistance. Injury often occurs in the process of arrest, as SCP-912 shows unawareness or indifference to the mechanical limitations of human joints. Armed attack upon SCP-912 or an unarmed subject in the vicinity will be met with potentially force using the telescopic baton. This response occurs whether or not uniform is worn.

Attempting to restrain SCP-912 or impinge upon the empty space enclosed within SCP-912 will provoke assault using the telescopic baton and should only be carried out by expendable personnel.

Testing of the performance of SCP-912 in a SWAT style tactical environment is ongoing. Agents  █████,  ██████████ and ████ have prior SWAT team experience and are preparing appropriate scenarios on behalf of Dr  ███████.
