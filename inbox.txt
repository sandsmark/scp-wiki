Gabriel, 

Sorry this took so long. New position left me pretty swamped. Archiving is already enough of a pain in the ass, now imagine doing so for sites that are underfunded and understaffed. The amount of information that gets lost or altered would make your head spin. Still, I managed to find the articles you requested. Well at least some. I couldn't find the very first iteration but I did manage to get as far back as 2005. Even plugged them through our new revision highlighter for you. It completely omits repeated information, thing's great. 

After skimming myself, I understand why these aren't immediately available. Had to jump a few hoops, probably shouldn't have read them to be honest. 

Good luck on your research, be careful though. Reality bending can rot your brain.

Bryan

**Item:** SCP-4704

**Object Class:** ##Blue|Euclid##

**Special Containment Procedure:** ##Blue|All SCP-4704 instances are to be transported to storage containment hangar 92-Δ of Area-92 located in Talamanca, Costa Rica. All personnel currently associated to SCP-4704 research team are now assigned to Area-92. HDD [[footnote]] Hume Discrepancy Detection ; see E&TS manual: //Reality Anchors, Reality Benders, And YOU!// [[/footnote]] monitors remain active within these buildings at all times. If a fluctuation in Hume level is detected, agents are to pin-point instances responsible and remove them for examination.## 


**Description:** 


##Blue|When several instances are simultaneously activated, designated a cluster-activation [[footnote]]See //Addendum 4704.01: Test Log-064//[[/footnote]], combined frequencies emitted will increase in strength. Cluster-activations produce significant hume field discrepancies, and the resulting modifications are severe, affecting a radius of up to 4000 meters. Recorded alterations include:##

* ##Blue|Rapid growth of vegetation native to the South American region including many species of flora, trees, and foliage.##
* ##Blue|Terrain deformation and seismic activity of a maximum magnitude of 7-8.##
* ##Blue|Violent atmospheric disturbance and inconsistent meteorological shifts, usually resulting in tropical storms.##
* ##Blue|Atmospheric and sedimentary purification.##
* ##Blue|Gradual accumulation of anomalously manifested fresh water into a large singular body.##

##Blue|Changes persist despite the cease of sonorous stimulation and are non reversible via standard methods.##


**##Blue|Addendum 4704.01:##** Test Log-064


The following is the first successfully recorded cluster-activation. After an extensive operation to publicly conceal incident, containment of SCP-4704 has been adjusted, including the construction of subterranean specialized containment area designated Area-92 to house all known instances of SCP-4704, and function as hub for SCP-4704 research team.

**Item #:** SCP-4704

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedure:**  

##Blue|SCP-4704-ö̀ is to be kept in standard containment chamber of Area-42 also outfitted with a single SRA.[[footnote]]See //Addendum 4704.01: Incident Report 4704-ö̀// [[/footnote]]. SCP-4704-ö̀ does not require sustenance. In the event of SCP-4704-ö̀ breaching from chamber, security personnel are to record all actions of the subject, but make no aggressive response. If SCP-4704-ö̀ makes contact with SCP-4704 instances, security are not to respond with hostility and to prepare facility evacuation procedures. When conversing with SCP-4704-ö̀, information involving the Foundation is considered classified and not to be disclosed despite the subject's persistence.## 

>  ##Blue|**Researcher Note:**## Pardon my frankness, but I feel this should be said directly. This, if anything, can be considered an unorthodox method of containment, but an effective one. The anchors are mostly for show. Yes, they have some effect on SCP-4704-ö̀, but its understanding of hume field manipulation far exceeds our own. It is difficult to compete with an entity for which the bending of reality it seems is almost like a hobby. If SCP-4704-ö̀ wished to leave the site, there is very little we can do to prevent it at this time. The only real leverage we have over this entity is its apparent fascination with aspects of human society, and to a greater degree, of us. Humor it, answer its questions, be polite, take notes. If we play our roles correctly, then we may just learn a thing or two.
> 
> Besides, as long as we have the stones, we have the monkey.
> 
> - //Dr. Rodolfo, Lead Researcher// 

**Description:** 

##Blue|SCP-4704-ö̀ is a sentient organic entity capable of altering the cellular composition of itself to an undocumented maximum degree and which currently resembles a male //Cebus capucinus//  [[footnote]] white-headed capuchin [[/footnote]]. This entity demonstrates a high level of intelligence and is able to communicate through speech, despite the psychical limitations of its corporeal form. Additionally, SCP-4704-ö̀ demonstrates a resistance to the effects of hume field manipulation, capable of altering itself in spite of the presence of SRAs. It is currently theorized this is due to SCP-4704-ö̀'s form maintaining its own hume field which it manipulates freely without affecting surrounding hume fields. All these prior factors have made effectively containing SCP-4704-ö̀ untenable. However, SCP-4704-ö̀ has been cooperative with the Foundation and has agreed to refrain from causing public disturbance. In return, SCP-4704-ö̀ has requested frequent conversations with personnel, as well as access to SCP-4704 instances for the purpose of demonstrations.##

[[include component:image-block

]]

##Blue|SCP-4704-ö̀ has extensive knowledge of the nature of SCP-4704, claiming to be their source of origin. Though the foundation has no method of validating this claim, historical information offered by SCP-4704-ö̀ as well as its skill in the utilization of SCP-4704 suggest the claim is legitimate. [[footnote]] See Addendum 4704.02: Findings Report [[/footnote]] SCP-4704-ö̀ will often ask questions concerning history, recent events, economic or social status of individuals, and details of the Foundation's purpose.##

##Blue|SCP-4704-ö̀ frequently preforms demonstrations of SCP-4704's capabilities, claiming that it wishes to educate the Research Personnel. Since SCP-4704-ö̀'s arrival SCP-4704 instances have been recorded to produce the following additional effects:##

* ##Blue|Rapid generation of foliage with no limitation of global region## 
* ##Blue|Atmospheric temperature alteration of no known maximum degree (decrease or increase)##
* ##Blue|Alteration of surrounding surface area to the form of dried out soil, fertile soil, obsidian, coral, marble, solid ice, glass, concrete, wood, steel, an unknown sponge like substance, etc.##  
* ##Blue|Generation of self-originated fire, volcanic rock, sterile water, salt water, mist, dust particles, static electricity, and plasma##
* ##Blue|Creation and rapid development of single cell organisms (hypothesized that if activation is indefinitely sustained ████ ██████ ███████ █████████)##
* ##Blue|████████████ within inorganic and organic subjects inside area of effect##
* ##Blue|Complete ██████████████ ██ █████████ ███ ███████ inside area of effect##

,,##Blue|For in-depth record and analysis of spacial positioning and tones utilized by
SCP-4704-ö̀ in order to produce the prior effects, please refer to the //"4704-Position to Tone Relation Guide Volume 02"//##,,  


##Blue|**Addendum 4704.01:**## Incident Report SCP-4704-ö̀ 

SCP-4704-ö̀ first came to the attention of the Foundation by his own accord on 11/03/11. SCP-4704-ö̀ entered Area-92, anomalously manifesting into storage containment hangar 92-Δ, triggering HDD monitors and notifying personnel of intrusion. SCP-4704-ö̀ began to interact with SCP-4704 instances until arrival of security personnel. Though firearms appeared to have no effect on SCP-4704-ö̀, the entity calmly obeyed instructions, speaking in an indiscernible language. SCP-4704-ö̀ was then held in an improvised containment chamber, as none were originally necessary in Area-92. 

##Blue|**Addendum 4704.02:**## Following the prior incident, it was soon discovered that SCP-4704-ö̀ speaks a tonal SOV language of the Chibchan family, spoken by some tribes of the indigenous Costa Rican population. Upon this discovery, a translator of said language was brought on site from the Foundation's Linguistic Division. The following interview was conducted by said researcher upon his arrival. 

> **Interviewed:** SCP-4704-ö̀
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Muñoz
> 
> **Foreword:** Transcription translated to English. 
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Dr. Muñoz:** Hello
> 
> //Subject does not respond. Appears to be inspecting a small object.//
> 
> **Dr. Muñoz:** Hello?
> 
> **SCP-4704-ö̀:** Ah, sorry. You speak Bribri?
> 
> **Dr. Rodolfo:** Yes. What is that?
> 
> **SCP-4704-ö̀:** Don't know. You should. In your weapons. 
> 
> **Dr. Rodolfo:** A bullet?
> 
> **SCP-4704-ö̀:** <Bulit>? Small, but hurts.  
> 
> **Dr. Muñoz:** Yes, I apologize-
> 
>  //Subject smiles.// 
> 
> **SCP-4704-ö̀:** Don't. Don't. I like new. There is much new, for me. I've been gone. Long time.
> 
> **Dr. Muñoz:** Gone? Gone where?
> 
> **SCP-4704-ö̀:** Too long, but returned now. Thank you. 
> 
> **Dr. Muñoz:** I don't understand. 
> 
> **SCP-4704-ö̀:** You use stones, yes?
>  
> **Dr. Muñoz:** I believe we did. You know what they are then?
> 
> **SCP-4704-ö̀:** Yes, yes, my stones. Bring me back. Yes. Glad to be back. 
> 
> **Dr. Rodolfo:** You claim them?
> 
> **SCP-4704-ö̀:** I made them, so they are mine. My stones. I am Sibú. Yes, that's me. Creator of stones.
>  
> **Dr. Muñoz:** Wait you- you are-
> 
> **SCP-4704-ö̀:** Yes, yes, Sibú. Creator of man. Creator of Earth. That's me. I'm back. Your use, eh no, worship, your worship of my stones returned me. 
> 
> //Dr. Muñoz pauses//
> 
> **Dr. Muñoz:** I don't- I'm sorry. Sibú was a man, no? 
> 
> **SCP-4704-ö̀:** Disguise. Needed disguise. Weak, also. Both. Disguised and weak. Weak without worship. 
> 
> **Dr. Muñoz:** I see. So, our music, that was worship to you?
> 
> //Subject appears thoughtful. Subject then laughs and tilts head.// 
> 
> **SCP-4704-ö̀:** Yes! Music! Music... Yes. Need music for the worship, do my miracles through stone. You worship me, keep worshiping me, I help you more. More miracles.  
>  
> **Dr. Muñoz:** Well, we'll have to consider that. We are not in a position to promise more, um, worship.   
> 
> **SCP-4704-ö̀:** Grateful anyways! You, [ //Subject points to Dr. Rodolfo, who had been watching the proceedings.// ] you remember where you come from. You remember, so I show you how to worship. Do many things. Do anything. You already saw. 
>  
>  
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** Behavior of SCP-4704-ö̀ during interview leaves researches uncertain of its sincerity. Despite this, request to continue testing with assistance of SCP-4704-ö̀ was authorized by O5 council, which lead to discovery of numerous additional effects.   


##Blue|**Addendum 4704.02:**## Findings Report

The following is a report on research carried out by lead researcher Dr. Rodolfo into the origin and possible nature of SCP-4704-ö̀.

]]

> **__Analysis of Costa Rican Historical Context in Relation to SCP-4704__**
> L. Rodolfo, Lead Researcher, Area-92
> 
> I find it pertinent to note that following my assignment to SCP-4704, I performed independent research into the the local Mesoamerican tribes of the Diquis Delta province. During this research I stumbled upon the name Sibú in context to a hero and creation deity figure. However, I did not initially find this information relevant to our studies of SCP-4704 effects. With the appearance of a reality bending entity claiming to be said deity, I have decided preform an in depth investigation of this legend with the assistance of The Folklore/Mythology Unit (FMU) of the Field Research Department.
>  
> This subject was said to be a member of an ancient demon race, titled the Sòrburu, which ruled the Earth prior to man. Sibú confronted and defeated his own people, taking reign over the Earth and becoming the principal deity of this mythology. Sibú then began to shape the planet itself, giving it a new form to his liking. There is the presence of objects titled "magical rocks" throughout this legend and it carries thematic similarities to SCP-4704's anomalous nature.
> 
> I believe this story and the newly arrived entity to, at the very least, speak some notion of the truth. The relationship between SCP-4704-ö̀ and the ancient civilizations is as of yet unclear, but we can be certain SCP-4704 are of its creation.

Gabriel, 

You have a problem. While looking for this, it became quickly apparent to me that I'm wading into waters well above my pay grade. This is all I could really get you. Everything else about the project has been scorched from what I can tell. Even this got me nearly detained. I'm fine, but that's about it for favors. Look, I get the interest, considering your department. Even I'm shocked this was going on in our backyard. But whatever happened, they're not bringing this program back, new stones or no new stones.

I'd leave it alone, and don't be surprised if you get called in soon.

Gabe, if you're reading this, Isaac managed to get the drive to you. I trust him, I hope you do too. They obviously screen everything that gets sent. I considered just giving it to you in person, too risky. Burn the note after you read it, I'd rather not be terminated due to idiotic curiosity and stubbornness. I hate you for turning me on to this, but I owe it to you enough to share what I found. 

I'm not sure what to believe anymore.

> **Dr. Rodolfo:** ...Why reveal this to me? We know now your existence depends on us. Your power. So why tell us so?

> **SCP-4704-ö̀:** That's how I used to see it too, but, recently, I realized it isn't so simple.

> 
> **SCP-4704-ö̀:** I'm a reality bender now Fito. I'm capable of anything, as long as you believe it. And now you can't help but to believe it. 
> 
> //SCP-4704-ö̀ levitates itself and Dr. Rodolfo.//
> 
>  **Dr. Rodolfo:** Wha- How are you-
> 
> **SCP-4704-ö̀:** I mean, you can't just stop believing I can do these things. You know that I can. At best you could forget.

>  **Dr. Rodolfo:** Stop this! Stop this Sibú!

Tropical forest overtakes surroundings. There is degeneration of clothing and technology developed after the pre-Columbian Mesoamerica period.//

> **SCP-4704-ö̀:** As a god I had competition, and I could do what? Change my shape? Control the weather? Mold the Earth? Now I can mold the universe! Thank you, truly, thank you! 
> 
> **Dr. Rodolfo:** If you don't stop we'll forget! We can! We can force everyone, even ourselves!
> 
> **SCP-4704-ö̀:** Honestly, my friend, why should you?  My gifts will help you do many things! They'll help you do anything! You already saw!

> **Notation:** //We gave it this power, so it's our responsibility to diminish it. We tried to maintain a lie with the Neutralized article, but the stones are very much still active, and they require only a thought to cause discrepancies now. We cannot allow ourselves to be bribed by these "gifts". Destroy them, amnesticize everyone, even the O5. Stop the belief at its roots. - Dr. Rodolfo//
