**Object Class:** --Safe-- Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** As SCP-4584 was destroyed during Incident-4584-1R, it is considered to be neutralized.

**Archived Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4584 is to be kept in a standard lockable trombone case. SCP-4584 is stored in research cell 174-C until testing concludes. Any researchers entering 174-C are to be accompanied by at least one guard for the entirety of the experiment, and must first gain approval from two or more Level-4 Researchers within the site.

**Description:** SCP-4584 is an H. N. White King-branded trombone composed of brass and silver, consistent with those manufactured from 1912-1916 by the H. N. White Company. 

SCP-4584's unique properties manifest when any mass (aside from human saliva) enters the entity from its 'bell' or mouthpiece side. If the mouthpiece of SCP-4584 is blown into by a human being, SCP-4584 will expel different materials varying in both speed and composition. Currently, the materials expelled seem to follow patterns depending on the input SCP-4584 receives, usually resulting in a spherical object which closely relates to the input. Most outputs are non-anomalous in structure, only processing anomalously high speeds when being expelled.

SCP-4584 may also be used non-anomalously as a regular trombone if the only input is human saliva.

**Initial Discovery:** SCP-4584 was found during an anomalous musical concert in  ████████ County, ███████ that was disrupted by MTF Eta-11 ("Savage Beasts"). The original case SCP-4584 was found with included a small letter, describing the anomaly. The letter, presumed to be written by the manufacturer, labelled SCP-4584 as “A weapon that surpasses its use as art or war. Not to be used by the inexperienced, for their safety.” 

**Testing Log-4584:**

||~ Inserted Mass ||~ Expelled Object ||~ Additional Notes  ||
|| 200 mg of soap mixed in water  || 20 mg of the same material, emitted through bubbles || Initially discovered when attempting to clean the interior of SCP-4584. ||
|| 1 kg of wool  || 3 kg of coloured yarn string, spooled into a ball || First instance of a complete change in colour and arrangement. ||
|| 5 kgs of brass || A standard 4-key french horn made of brass and nickel silver || First instance of an object being expelled with additional materials. ||
|| 5 kgs of gunpowder || A 400 kg cast-iron cannonball || Object expelled not only shot at a significantly higher velocity but was considerably warmer as well.  ||
|| A 4x4 cm piece of glass || A 20 kg glass ball || Object immediately shattered on the floor when expelled. Purple dust was observed to escape the gas before disappearing. Researcher █████ exhibited a decrease in memory recollection after the test of a short period of time. ||
|| A packet of pumpkin seeds and an estimated 3 kgs of granulated sugar || SCP-4584-1 (see Incident Report 4584-1R) || Testing postponed indefinitely. See Incident Report 4584-1E for details. ||

**Incident Report 4584-1R:**
On 11/11/2016, Researcher █████ requested testing access to SCP-4584. The request was accepted, though they failed to notify staff of the contents of their lunch that day. As █████ was in good standing within the Foundation, it is believed that they had simply misremembered what they had consumed that day. Researcher █████ had ingested a particularly high-sugar drink that day, forgetting to wash their mouth. Summarily, when SCP-4584 was blown into during the test, a small anomalous paper card became the output (henceforth designated as SCP-4584-1). The card proceeded to anomalously explode sometime later, killing Researcher █████ and destroying SCP-4584. The explosion is believed to have been triggered by a trigger word, presumably the ending phrase on SCP-4584-1. The only writing that is known to be on SCP-4584-1 was spoken aloud by █████ moments before detonation. It is transcribed below.
