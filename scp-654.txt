**Item #:** SCP-654

**Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** A habitat has been constructed for SCP-654 in Sub-Level 12 of Sector-28. The chamber is to be kept at a temperature of approximately -5 °C, and saltwater is to be circulated throughout the aquatic enclosure. Chamber walls outside of the aquatic enclosure have been plated with insulating ceramic composite.

A staff of handlers, composed of security clearance level 1 personnel and headed by staff marine biologist Dr. Earles, works in shifts of three in eight hour rotations to maintain feeding and medical examination schedules.

Cleaning of the habitat is assigned to standard sub-level custodial staff, to whom personal plexiglass shielding is allotted in case of incident.

    
**Description:** SCP-654, colloquially referred to as “Thunderhorn” by its handlers, is a male narwhal (Monodon Monoceros), visually disparate from others of its species only in that its characteristic spiral tusk has grown in a clockwise helix from the jaw, rather than the counterclockwise helix found in all other examined narwhals to date.

The other, notably more significant unique quality of SCP-654 is its ability to emit sudden bursts of electrostatic discharge from the apex of its tusk. The discharge is reminiscent of lightning, and is accompanied by a loud crack of sound. While not particularly accurate, the tusk can be used to direct the discharge, and SCP-654 had previously been observed in the wild making use of this ability: the mechanism, heretofore referred to as the “Stephens effect,” after it’s discoverer, SCP marine researcher Dr. █████ Stephens, had been adapted for use in hunting harp seals, SCP-654 being so bold as to uncharacteristically attack adults of the species, and having developed a taste for the cooked flesh.

Discovered by the northern shore of Hudson Bay in late 1982, SCP-654 had apparently been separated from its pod by clashing ice floes. Current speculation is that, unable to escape through Hudson Strait, it had become frustrated, and tried to clear a path through the closed passage. Conservation officers operating in Polar Bear Provincial Park had documented an “Unseasonal lightning strike,” and had been sent to quash a possible forest fire. Having found only a large amount of strangely melted ice, and the charred remains three polar bears, an incident report was filed, triggering an investigation by Sector-28 Northern operatives upon submission.

A full sweep of the bay was ordered, until SCP-654 was discovered. After a short corralling, it was sedated, placed into a porpoise stretcher, and airlifted to a park landing strip. From there, it was transported by privately-rented jet, sedated for the duration of the flight, to Sector-28, where it was held in the Sub-Level 13 flooded cavern until its habitat could be constructed.
