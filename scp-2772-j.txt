> 
> **Agent Spago:** Hi, Gary. It took me seven hours to walk all the way back here from Brighton High, all because Donahue didn't have the sense to pick me up afterwards. 
> 
> **Dr. Gleason:** Man, it looks like you needed some reliable transportation! Wait till you see this!
> 
> **Agent Spago:** That's nice, but I just want a coffee and some vacation pay right n-

> //Dr. Gleason drags Agent Spago to the Site-56 parking lot without Agent Spago's consent, and stops in front of SCP-2772-J.//
> 
> **Dr. Gleason:** Look at this bad boy! It's got air conditioning, and exclusive trim-
> 
> **Agent Spago:** Gary, I don't want to buy your Explorer. I already have a car.
> 
> **Dr. Gleason:** But with //this//, you could've driven back instead of walking!

> **Agent Spago:** //<in a rage state>// Well, it's too late now!

> **Dr. Gleason:** //<meekly>// Vicky, could I speak with you for a second?
> 
> **Dr. Vomac:** Yeah, sure, what do ya need?
> 
> **Dr. Gleason:** I heard you're looking for a car to buy, so I thought that-
> 
> **Dr. Vomac:** Oh [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-343|343]]], not this again.
> 
> **Dr. Gleason:** Yes, this again! My SUV is perfect for your family, and it holds more cargo than that minivan you're wanting to buy.
> 
> **Dr. Vomac:** Gleason, we've already been over this. I'm not buying your car.
> 
> **Dr. Gleason:** So what?! You're just gonna sink 30 grand in a mommy-mobile, when you can get my Eddie Bauer for a tenth of that?
> 
> **Dr. Vomac:** Get out of my office.
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** Dr. Vomac's refusal to get a great deal must be the result of some sort of infohazard. I will have to look into this. -Dr. Gleason

> 
> **Researcher Tassajara:** Is this about the Ford you're trying to sell?
> 
> **Dr. Gleason:** No, it's- actually, yeah, it's about that. How did you know?
> 
> **Researcher Tassajara:** Everyone warned me about this. And just to get this out of the way, I'm not buying SCP-2772-J.

//Director's Note: Dr. Gleason, the creation of an SCP entry just to sell your SUV is unacceptable. See me in my office.//

> **Director Palermo:** //<confused>// Wha... what? No, we need to talk about "2772-J". And it's //Director// Palermo to you.
> 
> **Dr. Gleason:** Oh yes, my SUV. If you want, I'm willing to cut a hundred dollars off the price.
> 
> **Director Palermo:** This is ridiculous! You cannot write an SCP entry just to advertise your damn car! You need to delete it, or I'm gonna get you terminated.
> 
> **Dr. Gleason:** Oh, I see. You're affected by the infohazard, too.
> 
> **Director Palermo:** //<confused out of his mind>// Wha... what??
> 
> **Dr. Gleason:** There's a infohazard going around causing people to react with hostility towards SCP-2772-J. Don't worry, I'm trying to find a cure.
> 
> **Director Palermo:** No, no! This isn't a infohazard, it's just that no one wants your car!!
> 
> **Dr. Gleason:** It's okay, Director Palermo. Your viewpoint isn't natural, you're just a victim of a infoha-

//Director's Note: It seems that the only way to get rid of Dr. Gleason's pleas is to just buy "SCP-2772-J" from him. So, who's gonna take one for the team? It's only 1900 bucks now.//
