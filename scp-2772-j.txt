> **Dr. Gleason:** Hey, Caesar, you're back! 
> 
> **Agent Spago:** Hi, Gary. It took me five weeks to walk all the way back here from [REDACTED], all because Donahue didn't have the sense to park the truck a few blocks away. 
> 
> **Dr. Gleason:** Man, it looks like you needed some reliable transportation! Wait till you see this!
> 
> **Agent Spago:** That's nice, but I just want a coffee and some vacation pay right n-

> **Dr. Gleason:** Look at this bad boy! It's got air conditioning, and exclusive trim-
> 
> **Agent Spago:** Gary, I don't want to buy your Explorer. I already have a car.

> **Dr. Gleason:** But with //this//, you could've driven back instead of walking!

> 
> **Dr. Vomac:** Oh [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-343|343]]], not this again.
> 
> **Dr. Gleason:** Yes, this again! My SUV is perfect for your family, and it holds more cargo than that minivan you're wanting to buy.
> 
> **Dr. Vomac:** Gleason, we've already been over this. I'm not buying your car.
> 
> **Dr. Gleason:** So what?! You're just gonna sink 30 grand in a mommy-mobile, when you can get my Eddie Bauer for a tenth of that?

> **Dr. Vomac:** Get out of my office.
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** [Dr. Vomac's refusal to get a great deal must be the result of some sort of cognitohazard. I will have to look into this. -Dr. Gleason]

> **Dr. Gleason:** No, it's- actually, yeah, it's about that. How did you know?

//Director's Note: Dr. Gleason, the creation of an SCP entry just to sell your SUV is unacceptable. See me in my office.//

> **Director Palermo:** //<confused>// Wha... what? No, we need to talk about "2772-J". And it's //Director// Palermo to you.
> 
> **Dr. Gleason:** Oh yes, my SUV. If you want, I'm willing to cut a hundred dollars off the price.
> 
> **Director Palermo:** This is ridiculous! You cannot write an SCP entry just to advertise your damn car! You need to delete it, or I'm gonna get you terminated.
> 
> **Dr. Gleason:** Oh, I see. You're affected by the cognitohazard, too.
> 
> **Director Palermo:** //<confused out of his mind>// Wha... what??
> 
> **Dr. Gleason:** There's a cognitohazard going around causing people to react with hostility towards SCP-2772-J. Don't worry, I'm trying to find a cure.
> 
> **Director Palermo:** No, no! This isn't a cognitohazard, it's just that no one wants your car!!
> 
> **Dr. Gleason:** It's okay, Director Palermo. Your viewpoint isn't natural, you're just a victim of a cognitoha-

> **Director Palermo:** //<in a rage state>// GET OUT OF MY OFFICE!!
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** [The Director does not seem to be immune to the cognitohazard. I should investigate whether the cognitohazard affects civilians. -Dr. Gleason]

//Director's Note: It seems that the only way to get rid of Dr. Gleason's pleas is to just buy "SCP-2772-J" from him. So, who's gonna take one for the team? It's only 1900 bucks now.//
