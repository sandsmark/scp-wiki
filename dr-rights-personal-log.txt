I am home, and I am going to bed and to my love now. I feel so content sometimes, I almost regret knowing that I'll wake up and be ready to throw my life into the world of SCPs and danger again.

Tomorrow is Thanksgiving, and for the first time in my life I think I may not be home to share the meal with my family. A mildly depressing thought, but I do plan to go home early in order to spend Thanksgiving evening with friends and family. However, the festivities will NOT be quelled! After successfully raising a large Terror Bird via [[[SCP-561]]], I believe that it may be able to feed quite a large amount of the SCP Faculty I intend to invite. Cooking is commencing. I need to find someone to bring a vegetable dish, though, and no nuts. I don't like nuts, there's a risk of allergies, and all that jazz.

██████ asks about work a little more than usual, lately. I think he sees the stress of it getting to me, and wonders why I'm gone so many nights. I spend a lot of daytime that I'm at home sleeping, or trying to sleep, and getting less sleep than usual...which really isn't saying much, considering that the majority of my sleep (75%, give or take) occurs during transport. I nap on copters, planes, in cars...basically whenever I'm being moved. Although I have been caught napping in my office every so often, now. I actually learned that the tiredness I get in moving objects is a form of motion sickness. My brain isn't very fond of motion, so it shuts down. At least I don't get it while driving, that would be bad.

Mom wants me and ██████ to get married and pop out grandkids. I've never even thought of the implication of having kids in this job. They're probably be crazy mutant spider-babies, if not worse. I know that some male researches have wives and kids at home, but they didn't have to come to work pregnant. I don't think I could do the dangerous shit I do if I had another life to worry about.

Well, lets not think about that now.

Kain wants to use [[[SCP-291]]] to get human eyes. I'll ask him his thoughts on informing me of the results. I'm thinking of taking some time to look around [[[SCP-561]]] as well.

I should go feed Pterry.

I'm tired and hungry. That's my status update.
