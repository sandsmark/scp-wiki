Tomorrow is Thanksgiving, and for the first time in my life I think I may not be home to share the meal with my family. A mildly depressing thought, but I do plan to go home early in order to spend Thanksgiving evening with friends and family. However, the festivities will NOT be quelled! After successfully raising a large Terror Bird via [[[SCP-561]]], I believe that it may be able to feed quite a large amount of the SCP Faculty I intend to invite. Cooking is commencing. I need to find someone to bring a vegetable dish, though, and no nuts. I don't like nuts, there's a risk of allergies, and all that jazz.

██████ asks about work a little more than usual, lately. I think he sees the stress of it getting to me, and wonders why I'm gone so many nights. I spend a lot of daytime that I'm at home sleeping, although less sleep than usual...
