title:Dr. Rights' Personal Log
**Dr. Agatha Rights was encouraged to start this personal journal, so that she would not create a public "Blog" in order to express her concerns and thoughts. Some information has been selectively edited for security reasons.**

**Valentine's Say, 2009**
I came into work this morning to find several boxes of chocolates, two human hearts (one still beating), a dead dove that had been shot through with an arrow, and a few cars on my desk.

...I'm going home early.

**VACAYTIME**
brb, goin' on vacation, suckers!

> Dear Dr. Rights,
> I am aware you are still somewhat recovering from your recent search-and-recovery dispatch, however I wish to log a request. Let me first assure you that it is not that you remand "Tubby" to Site Security. It has been decided that, while it is a SCP-derived item, the danger is low enough that it will be issued to your custody, under the condition that it remains on site and will not be used off-site unless approved by Site Security. Dr. Kondraki's recent promotion, and your timely gift of pie and other baked goods to the review board may have created a bias, but I stand behind the board's decision.
> My request is in regards to a termination test preformed on SCP-682. It was proposed to use SCP-053 to terminate SCP-682, despite SCP-053 never before having any affect on any non-human biological life form. SCP-682 reacted in a way wholly counter to all previously recorded behavior, appearing relaxed and making no serious attempts to escape. Please refer to Experiment Log T-98816-OC108/682 for detailed records.
> While observation recordings have not yet been released to the public, several members of staff have requested images from this test, many of them using terms such as "Super-cute!!!" and "BAWWWW!!". I am aware of your artistic inclination, and in the interest of shortening a already excessive back-log of paperwork, would like for you to provide a artistic rendering of the event, if at all possible. This will satisfy many of the pending requests with a minimum amount of inter-staff friction.
> Thank you for your attention,
> Dr. Gears

I just remembered why I went to art school. Also, Tubby!

My car needed a new battery, long story short.

I probably shouldn't do this since Kondraki's kinda been promoted (thought they were trying to kill him?) but hell, this job is all about risks.

I almost forgot to mention, Thanksgiving went swimmingly. Cooking was a blast (literally, considering how we used [[[SCP-295]]]. So it was basically cooking with napalm) and I had a very interesting conversation with Kain. I'm looking forwards to seeing how that turns out, and have been submitting ideas as they come to me. I don't have the heart to reveal that most of them are out of my old GURPS: Bio-Tech roleplaying guidebook.
Also, apparently taking a day off to decorate the house is sufficient cause for you to be investigated to residual effects of [[[SCP-288]]]. I'd like to think that I am allowed to be domestic on my own, you know.
Well, off to actually do my paperwork. I'm looking forwards to the Christmas season, and to making gifts for everybody. I already knit Kain a sweater after his work with [[[SCP-291]]], so maybe booties for him. Besides, knitting gives me something to do when I can't focus on other things. It's a good trade for insomnia.

I am home, and I am going to bed and to my love now. I feel so content sometimes, I almost regret knowing that I'll wake up and be ready to throw my life into the world of SCPs and danger again.

**Wednesday, November 26, 2008, 4:55 PM-5:26 PM**
Tomorrow is Thanksgiving, and for the first time in my life I think I may not be home to share the meal with my family. A mildly depressing thought, but I do plan to go home early in order to spend Thanksgiving evening with friends and family. However, the festivities will NOT be quelled! After successfully raising a large Terror Bird via [[[SCP-561]]], I believe that it may be able to feed quite a large amount of the SCP Faculty I intend to invite. Cooking is commencing. I need to find someone to bring a vegetable dish, though, and no nuts. I don't like nuts, there's a risk of allergies, and all that jazz.

██████ asks about work a little more than usual, lately. I think he sees the stress of it getting to me, and wonders why I'm gone so many nights. I spend a lot of daytime that I'm at home sleeping, or trying to sleep, and getting less sleep than usual...which really isn't saying much, considering that the majority of my sleep (75%, give or take) occurs during transport. I nap on copters, planes, in cars...basically whenever I'm being moved. Although I have been caught napping in my office every so often, now. I actually learned that the tiredness I get in moving objects is a form of motion sickness. My brain isn't very fond of motion, so it shuts down. At least I don't get it while driving, that would be bad.

Mom wants me and ██████ to get married and pop out grandkids. I've never even thought of the implication of having kids in this job. They're probably be crazy mutant spider-babies, if not worse. I know that some male researches have wives and kids at home, but they didn't have to come to work pregnant. I don't think I could do the dangerous shit I do if I had another life to worry about.

Well, lets not think about that now.

Kain wants to use [[[SCP-291]]] to get human eyes. I'll ask him his thoughts on informing me of the results. I'm thinking of taking some time to look around [[[SCP-561]]] as well.

I should go feed Pterry.

I'm tired and hungry. That's my status update.
