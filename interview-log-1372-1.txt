**Interview Log 1372-1**
//Chief L███ is the appointed elder of the native tribe inhabiting ███████. This island is the only landmass located inside of Zone-1372-Alpha. All inhabitants are aware of the effects of SCP-1372. While the natives do not speak English, the language is similar enough to that of other South Pacific islands that an interpreter was able to communicate.//

Dr. R███████: Thank you for speaking with us, Elder.

Chief L███: I am to understand you wish to "contain" this place. The "edge". (//L███ gestures out towards SCP-1372.//) If that is the case, then I will need to impart you with my knowledge of this... what did you call it?

R██████: An anomalous region. You aren't going to resist our efforts here?

L███: We are simple people who have trouble enough with one ship. You are representative of an entire nation. I certainly wish for things to continue as they are, but what would resisting accomplish? You would simply take what you desire regardless, and then you would be without my knowledge.

R██████: I understand. Please, tell me what you know about the anomaly.

L███: (//pauses for breath//) Our people still recall the stories of that group whose log brought you here. A shame what happened to their captain. As you no doubt learned from the log, our maps do not show anything west of us. You know of course why that is now. (//L███ looks out to the ocean and towards SCP-1372 again.//) We can all see it, of course. But still, from time to time some of the young men band together and set out on a ship. They want to see what lies beyond the edge of the map. Aren't your people the same way, Doctor?

R██████: Curiosity is one thing, but the anomaly, well...

L███: (//laughs//) Yes, well. You didn't fly in from the east. As for what lies beyond the edge, I have no more idea than you. All I can tell you is what returns.

R██████: You've come into contact with SCP-1372-1, then?

L███: If that is your term for the ships that return from the edge, then yes, I have seen a few. We learned very early on, Doctor, that while they look just like our own ships, and our own people, they are no longer ours. Their nature is not something I understand, but whatever lies beyond that edge does not lie on this Earth. Those who make contact... you saw that yourself the other day. Firsthand, I believe? (//Note: L███ appears here to be referring to Incident 1372-1, which had occurred 3 days beforehand.//) They are made like them. Part of the... crew, if you can call it that, of those plague ships.

R██████: A plague? Elder, we performed an autopsy on several of the crew of the unknown ship. There were no signs of any form of biological infection, and they proved genetically similar to...

L███: (//interrupting//) Perhaps it is not a plague as you or I understand it, Doctor, but it is a plague nonetheless. It is not a plague of the body, but of the mind, and it is one not carried by blood or a sneeze, but in the words of the infected, the knowledge they bring back with them from beyond the edge of the Earth. Do you understand?

R██████: We... have a word for what I believe you are talking about, yes.

L███: That is why my people use fire against it, as that logbook you found surely tells. If I am to trust you with safeguarding the edge, then you must understand that. It is a plague, and it cannot be allowed to leave these waters. When it was just my people and their simple longboats, it was easy. Even when that man's entire fleet emerged, one by one, we somehow managed to subdue each ship in turn. But now, you have machines that fly through the air, and ships that dwarf the mighty sharks of the deep. If something like that passes the edge, and returns, my people cannot put the flame to it. And out in the open air of our world, I am far from sure your Foundation can contain or protect from what the plague ships carry.

R██████: That's what we do, Elder.

L███: That is what you desire to do, Doctor. I entrust this island to your keeping. And I entrust the edge to you to guard. Fail, and the plague ships will come. Do not betray us.

(//Following this interview, all inhabitants were administered Class A amnesiacs and relocated to an uninhabited atoll in the Marshall Islands. All remaining documentation regarding the island and SCP-1372 has been destroyed by order of O5 Command, with the exception of Document-1372-1.//)
