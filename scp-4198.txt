**Special Containment Procedures:** The area surrounding SCP-4198 is to be protected by a chainlink fence and signage warning of both a condemned building and hazardous waste.  Foundation personnel posing as building security are to be stationed outside this perimeter to repel visitors and respond to breaches.

In the event of a containment breach, respondents are to be equipped with chemical spray hoses containing a solution of 5M sodium hydroxide or other industrial grade alkaline solution in order to neutralize instances of SCP-4198-1.

**Description:** SCP-4198 is the collective designation for the objects contained at an industrial complex near Newark, New Jersey, USA.  This is the former site of 'Parson's Periwigs & Manufactury' and was purchased in 2006 after the death of three local teenagers was flagged by Foundation analysts.  The primary resident of the industrial complex is a collection of sapient wigs composed of human hair, nylon, and other materials endemic to the wig making process.

Instances of SCP-4198-1 are composed of masses which vary in height from 1 to 2 meters.  Each object is composed of individually styled and colored hairs that are formed into pseudopods analogous to arms and legs.  These appendages surround a central density of invariably auburn hair which, other than size, appears to be devoid of other distinguishing features.  Although these objects appear to lack sensory organs, instances of SCP-4198-1 are capable of crude vocalizations produced via unknown means.  This level of communication is used to execute rudimentary coordination in their day to day behaviors.

While not actively hostile, instances of SCP-4198-1 do demonstrate territorial aggression and respond with coordinated defense.

**Discovery Log 4198.1**
**Synopsis:** //Resources at Site-28 were notified by a Foundation plant in the Essex County Sheriff's Department regarding a number of missing person reports in the Newark area.  Several 'urban explorers' had been reported missing over the course of years but their disappearances were not correlated until the discovery of a body near the abandoned site of Parson's Periwigs.  The following video log was recorded by the team sent to evaluate the site.//

> 
> //Footage begins with the team walking up an overgrown gravel drive and past a dilapidated gatehouse.  The industrial complex is visible in the distance; the whole property appears to be in a state of substantial disrepair.//
> 
> //The team falls into formation and enters the facility through an open door in a loading bay.  The cameras adjust to the change in ambient light to reveal a spacious but extremely dirty interior.  A thick cake of dust has accumulated near the baseboards and the walls have peeled and degraded beyond recognition from their original state.  There are footpaths in the middle of each room, however, which are largely devoid of both dust and debris.//
> 
> //The team proceeds further into the facility and enters an interior room with minimal lighting.  The camera jerks sharply to the right as all three members of the reconnaissance team momentarily freeze before training their weapons in the same direction.//
> 
> **<Granger>:** "Did you get that, chief?  Something just fucking moved over there.  Looked...fuzzy?"
> 
> **<Kemnits:>** "Copy.  Possibly animal; there's a good chance local wildlife has moved in here."
> 
> **<Granger>:** "Keep on your toes.  Doubt it's going to wind up being a raccoon."
> 
> //The crew proceeds deeper into the complex when one of the weapon-mounted flashlight trains onto a shaggy mound of hair on the other side of the room, later designated as an instance of SCP-4198-1.  The object appears to freeze when the light is trained on its position.//
> 
> **<Flores>:** "What the fuck is that?"
> 
> **<Kemnits:>** "Can you understand us?  Are you capable of communication?"
> 
> //The object makes a low chittering noise and begins to shake.//
> 
> **<Flores>:** "Oh shit, chief, it's going to fucking freak out.  It's freaking, ah jeez."
> 
> **<Kemnits:>** "Calm down, this is contact!  Lower your weapon, Flores.  //Now.//"
> 
> //After hesitation, Flores lowers his weapon.  Agent Kemnitz takes two large steps forward while lowering his own firearm."//
> 
> **<Kemnits:>** "Can you understand me?  If you are capable of communicating, please give me some sign."
> 
> **<Granger>:** //muttering// "Is that... Is that all...hair?"
> 
> //The instance of SCP-4198-1 ceases shaking and retreats through the doorway it was standing in and out of sight.  The reconnaissance team pursues under high-alert but halts again inside the next room.  The camera slowly pans around the room as multiple instances of SCP-4198-1 skitter up the walls, through crawl spaces, and into ventilation ducts scattered around the room.//
> 
> **<Flores>:** "God, there must be dozens of them.  What are they?"
> 
> **<Kemnits:>** "Not sure but I don't like this.  Some kind of infestation.  It smells funny in here, like...greasy or oily?"
> 
> **<Kemnits:>** "Flag it for follow-up and let's clear."
> 
> **<Granger>:** "Chief, I can hear an awful lot of commotion down that hall."
> 
> **<Flores>:** "All the more reason to get the hell out."
> 
> **<Kemnits:>** "Quick peak and we're gone.  Let's just get it on video."
> 
> //After a momentary pause, the team continues across the room and deeper into the facility.  They come to a stop next to a set of double doors which have been badly dirtied.//
> 
> **<Flores>:** "See that? There's a light on in there."
> 
> //The camera pans down to show a faint light leaking through the gap between the door and the concrete floor.  Agent Flores places his hand on the door and pushes into the room.  The other two agents follow closely behind and begin to sweep the room with their flashlights.  Dozens of instances of SCP-4198-1 retreat from the door and crowd the middle of the warehouse floor.  More still skitter out from ventilation ducts near the ceiling and climb down to join the central mass.  A handful of overhead directional lamps provide faint and intermittent illumination for the room, however, most of the overhead lights are nonfunctional.//
> 
> //As the camera slowly pans from left to right, several instances of SCP-4198-1 can be seen surrounding storage shelves on the warehouse floor which appear to contain mounted mannequin heads.  All of the visible heads appear to be badly desiccated and discolored.  The camera stops and fixates on a bright white mannequin head adorned with a disproportionately large bouffant-style wig.  Utilizing two similarly large bangs, the white mannequin head raises itself up several meters above the pack of SCP-4198-1.//
> 
> **<Flores>:** "Creepy as hell."
> 
> **<Granger>:** "Are they protecting it?"
> 
> //Six instances of SCP-4198-1 break off from the central horde and approach the reconnaissance team.  Each instance steps rapidly toward the team and then backs up while hissing.  Instances of SCP-4198-1 continue to posture in this manner as the team trains their weapons.//
> 
> **<Granger>:** "What's the call, chief?"
> 
> **<Kemnits:>** "We back up, slowly."
> 
> //The agents begin backing up toward the door until Agent Flores appears to collide with the door frame.  The sudden impact jolts him and he reflexively discharges his firearm in a semi-automatic burst.  An instance of SCP-4198-1 is struck and staggers backward as tufts of hair explode out.  Communal chitters bellow from the rest of the room as Agent Kemnitz shouts for a full retreat.//
> 
> //As the three agents run down the hallway, Agent Granger is seen dropping out of the frame and crashing to the ground.  From several meters further along the camera turns back to Granger's position and observes an instance of SCP-4198-1 wrapping and constricting the agent's legs.  Agent Granger fires several rounds in the direction of pursuing objects, but it is unclear if they are hit.  A second instance climbs on top of the Granger and similarly binds his arms as he attempts to further discharge his weapon.//
> 
> //Agent Flores raises his firearm and aims at the objects assaulting Granger.//
> 
> **<Kemnits:>** "No!  You'll hit him!" //Agent Kemnitz puts a hand atop Flores' gun and directs it downward.//
> 
> //Additional instances of SCP-4198-1 pile onto Agent Granger.  As he lets out a cry, a pseudopod of hair is jammed into his mouth and down his throat and the screams end.  Tendrils of hair are seen exiting through Agent Granger's nose as he is pulled inside a large mass of hair and carried him away.  The camera turns and the remaining agents flee the facility.//

> **Researcher's Update:**
> Following the events of Discovery Log 4198.1, the entity with the bouffant has been designated as SCP-4198-α and is presently assumed to be either a communal/pack leader, an originator, or an object of reverence.  Any additional communication should be attempted through this entity if such a gesture can be made at all.

**Exploration Log 4198.2**
**Synopsis:** //An unmanned Foundation tactical recon drone was deployed to the site of 'Parson's Periwigs & Manufactury' in order to locate the body of Agent Granger for recovery.  This mission was initiated two days after the events of Discovery Log 4198.1//

> //Extraneous audio and video are cut as Foundation personnel operating in an equipment truck perform final checks.//
> 
> //Footage begins with the drone circling the perimeter of the complex from an elevation of ten meters.  Multiple instances of SCP-4198-1 are intermittently visible on camera on various sections of the building include the roof and HVAC apparatus.  The drone moves down to an open cargo bay door and enters the facility.  Onboard lighting is activated.//
> 
> //Identifying an interior source of light, the drone passes through an empty window frame and enters into a large room believed to be a warehouse or shipping/receiving facility.  The perimeter of the room is full of shelving units that hold cardboard boxes in various states of decay.  Several instances of SCP-4198-1 are visible on camera climbing over and on these boxes.//
> 
> //As the drone approaches the middle of the room, instances of SCP-4198-1 appear to regard the camera or otherwise become aware of its presence.  Multiple instances skitter up the shelving units and seek apparent shelter within the cardboard boxed, however several remain on the ground.//
> 
> //Visible now on an elevated assembly of desks and boxes are both SCP-4198-α and Agent Granger.  They are surrounded by several dozen instances of SCP-4198-1.  Agent Granger appears to be incapacitated as several thick ropes of braided hair are bound around his appendages and torso, securing him to a desk.  His helmet has been removed and he appears to be unconscious.//
> 
> //The drone is instructed to hover over Granger and catalog his well-being.  The camera indicates several streaks of a dry, discolored substance on his face and around his mouth.  It is unknown if this material originally belonged to Agent Granger or was introduced by other means.//
> 
> //At this time the articulating arms of the drone are activated and Foundation Operations has elected to attempt to free Agent Granger from his restraints.  As the drone lowers further several instances of SCP-4198-1, as well as SCP-4198-α, withdraw from the immediate vicinity.//
> 
> //The miniature saw-blade equipped appendage of the drone spins to life and begins to cut through the largest restraint around the torso.  As it does so, Agent Granger's eyes flutter open and he appears to regain consciousness.  A cacophonous noise fills the warehouse, originating from off-screen, and Agent Granger visibly winces.//
> 
> //Briefly visible, a large pseudopod of hair is seen colliding with the tactical drone.  The visage of SCP-4198-α is on camera and the drone tumbles onto the floor.  The connection with Operations is lost.//
> 
> //Several minutes elapse before the camera begins transmitting again.  Foundation Operations attempt to re-engage flight controls but commands are non-responsive.  Diagnostic checks indicate all rotary assemblies have been damaged as well as the utility arm.  The drone is several meters further back from Agent Granger than its last reported position.  Agent Granger appears to be awake and struggling against his restraints.//
> 
> **<Granger>** "C-Can you hear me?  They just keep stroking my head, or my hair, or something.  The big one.  They... it has other heads here.  I-I don't know what it wants.  Please just-" //An instance of SCP-4198-1 inserts a pseudopod of hair into Agent Granger's mouth.  Coughing and choking are heard until Agent Granger appears to pass out.//
> 
> //The drone continues transmitting for more than 50 minutes.  During this time, SCP-4198-α approaches Agent Granger several times while carrying secondary mannequin heads.  These objects appear to vary in size and shape although it is unclear if this is due to intended design or a byproduct of degradation with time.//
> 
> //SCP-4198-α places the secondary head next to Agent Granger and conducts some sort of comparison or evaluation.  After six different selections are tested, a mannequin head is placed on the table next to Agent Granger and SCP-4198-α ceases this behavior.//
> 
> //The battery is depleted and the drone ceases communication.//

**Addendum 4198.3**
> The body of Agent Granger was discovered by Site-28 personnel 16 days after the events of Exploration Log 4198.2.  The autopsy provided the cause of death as complications due to starvation, as examination suggests the subject would have survived other apparent injuries if in an otherwise healthy state.
> 
> Subject died with substantial muscular atrophy, apparent cardiac arrhythmia, dramatically reduced liver function, and dramatically reduced kidney function.  The brain was found to be significantly reduced in volume due to dehydration and malnutrition.  The contents of the stomach and large intestines were found to be large quantities of undigested human hair, modacrylic, polyester, and commercial hair dye.  The recovered hair was not a match to that of the victim.
> 
> The victim's scalp was removed postmortem via unknown means and was not retrieved with the body.  Its whereabouts are presently unknown.
> 
> Agent Granger's remains were cremated and interred.
