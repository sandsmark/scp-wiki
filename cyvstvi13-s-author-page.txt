**Specific Containment Procedures**: Hypothetically, Cyvstvi13 does not exist, has never existed, nor will it ever exist. Any information contrary to the prior statement is to be disregarded and dismissed as facetious.

**Description**: If the assumed Cyvstvi13 doesn't exist, can they even be contained?

This question was the primary matter of this article: A way to contain a potential Cyvstvi13 and their, seemingly, endless knowledge on almost all subject matter but solely in a trivial capacity.

Steps were taken to nullify this paradoxical (and frankly ridiculous) conundrum. This was via the prior Specific Containment Procedures; to contain a presumed Cyvstvi13, one only needs to ignore the bloody bugger. [[footnote]]//How rude.//[[/footnote]]
