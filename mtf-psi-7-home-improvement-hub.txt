Equipped with a high capacity drum magazine, fires in semi-automatic fashion. ||
|| Flamethrower FLW70 || [DATA REDACTED] || Various nozzles |||| The Flamethrower FLW70 is being produced by the Foundation in Germany. Can be used with gaseous, liquid and pasty fuels.

By the use of several combinable lenses, resonators, energy storages, grips and attachments, the weapon can be adapted to every situation. The standard variant is only the size of a submachine gun with an extendable shaft. Because of the missing terminal ballistics, it is only partly usable against organic targets. It is also available mounted weapon for assault rifles, vehicle armament and as secondary weapon in line with the FLW70.||
