[[include component:pataphysics-theme]]

> Quick little announcement: I likely won't write anything or be on the site in general for the next... 3-ish Months? My internet's currently borking like mad so I can't access chat, and once school holidays start I'm gonna stay away from the site to spend more time with family and such over christmas. I will write again eventually though, just gonna take a break over summer (Or winter if you're in the northern hemisphere). Anyway, peace.

[[size 150%]]**Researcher Kimba Laslow**[[/size]]
The lone pataphysicist of Site-87, Kimba (Her parents were weird, blame them for the name) is passionate and energetic about her work, dealing with any fictional issues facing Sloth's Pit.

**Personality:** Ambivert, enjoying quiet chatter with company most of the time, but when she's lost in a good book or feeling down she prefers to be left alone by most people. Can come off as strange, likes to go on tangents and often loses herself in thought. Very focused when it comes to work, but she's often very tired the rest of the time as a result.

**Likes (Not a full list):** Chill music, Hugs, The smell of libraries, Soup, Magic, Fantasy movies, Fluffy things, Well bound books, Waffles, Cold weather and Cardigans.

**Dislikes:** Summer, Minimalism, Loud noises, Silence, Clocks ("They sound like a bomb's about to go off!"), Romance novels, Tomatoes (She likes the soup and sauce though), Taking chances (usually), Short shorts and Badly worn books.

**Relationships:** She has a girlfriend, who happens to be a werewolf. She's good with computers, you'll meet her soon. She's also friends with Dr. Sinclair. Not overly close so far - it's more of a work friendship - but enjoys hearing about thaumaturgy, and all the myths, legends and gods behind them.

**Other Notes:** Kimba has passing interests in magic and other anomalous phenomena, but her primary allegiance will always be to her realms of fiction. She's taken holidays in Jane Austen, participated in the Hunger Games, been to books within books, and some say she's working on a method to create a new system of book-driven magic. But then it's just a rumor.

When writing a story with Kimba in it (if you want to), remember that the rules in her tales are based off the pataphysical logic and rules of the Thursday Next series, and Kimba herself has a bit of Thursday in her. She also takes a small bit of inspiration from The Doctor's style of speaking, but otherwise she's largely her own character. From a writing perspective, play with the 4th wall as much or as little as you want. Change font, text size, text alignment, make references to other books and just have fun. She's not an overly serious character, but then again she's not comic relief. Treat her kindly.

More characters on the way...

And that's all I've wrote. So far anyway. I have [http://firedawnfolder.wikidot.com/blaskobox A sandbox] where all my ideas are, you can jump in and have a look at what I'm up to, just don't expect a beautifully curated list of golden ideas.

Well anyway, I'll see you around in the site19 chatroom (I lurk a TON), maybe I'll offer some crit, maybe something else. Until then!

Now stop fawning over me and go write, you goose!
