**Item #:** SCP-5988

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The trapdoor leading to the entrance of SCP-5988 is to be sealed with a new padlock and hidden under a new set of floorboards. Exploration within SCP-5988 is currently suspended until further notice.

**Description:** SCP-5988 refers to a massive facility located underneath a hut inland of Princess Elizabeth Land, Antarctica. The hut appeared to have been abandoned for a considerable amount of time. The interior of the hut appears normal with three rooms: a bathroom, a bedroom with two beds, and a kitchen. A wooden trapdoor is hidden underneath a bearskin carpet in the bedroom. During its initial discovery, the trapdoor appeared to have been sealed with a rusted padlock; however, the padlock's shackle appears to be broken apart. Further inspection of the lock's body indicate scratch marks, implying a tool was used to break it open.

Opening the trapdoor reveals a shaft with a ladder built into it. The shaft extends for over a hundred meters down and leads to an open room. The contents of this room consists of a control panel with a large glass viewport and a metal placard on the viewport's left side reading "Dreamscape Facility". Above that appears to be a heavily damaged placard; with the only readable portion being [[[SCP-3790|"Abnormalities"]]].

On top of the control panel lies a headset visor with cables running to a computer terminal which has been recently left active. Beside this panel are large tanks with pipelines connecting to the chamber filled with pentobarbitals, benzodiazepines, and other liquid sedatives.

Beyond the viewport is a dark, spacious chamber with a ceiling spotlight serving as the only source of illumination on the entity inside.

Inside the chamber is a humanoid entity covered entirely in bandages and suspended eight feet off the ground by six chains[[footnote]]These chains are held to the figure's arms, feet, waist, and neck.[[/footnote]] with cables and tubes attached to the entity's spine and the back of its head. Attached to the entity's face is a headset and visor similar in appearance to the headset outside the chamber.

When the visor is worn, viewers will experience a period of darkness before losing consciousness and falling into rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Seconds later, the screen on the computer terminal will change from standby to reflect the perspective of the viewer. Individuals will find themselves sitting in a steel chair inside an oneiric environment resembling a Foundation interrogation room, in front of a table along with another vacant chair at the opposite end. Viewers will often find themselves "waking up" upon being materialized into this room.

The layout of the area is separated into a single room and a hallway. The hallway hosts --seven-- six locked rooms[[footnote]]All the rooms have destroyed placards consistent with the damaged area found at the facility's main viewport.[[/footnote]] with short notes attached to some of them and are located on the left wall. The final room; however, located at the very end of the hallway, lacks a note.

Despite being locked, subjects are capable of perceiving the contents of these rooms by holding the doorknobs. Upon tactile contact, subjects are given a "mental picture" depicting what is inside the room itself.

Individuals can only exit this space by a second party deactivating the terminal connected to the headset; instantly waking up the exiting individuals.

Individuals are also capable of bringing over objects upon leaving this oneiric space and vice-versa. This manifests in the form of the chosen items spontaneously appearing in the hands of the viewers in the physical plane.

**Video Transcript**

**Location:** Princess Elizabeth Land, Antarctica

**Recovery Information:** The following transcript was recovered as a video file uploaded to the computer terminal's main server. This, along with a single image file, was also recovered from the terminal.

Closer inspection of the terminal reveals that the computer had all of its stored data completely wiped from its memory. All that remained was the following videotape file labeled "celebration".
-----
//The video begins with a shot of the same room located in the terminal; the camera appears to capture a diagonal angle of the table. An entity [[footnote]]Subject A.[[/footnote]]wearing a light-brown greatcoat and a grey fedora appears in the frame and sits down in the chair facing away from the camera; crossing his legs.//

//Five minutes later, an unidentified male[[footnote]]Subject B.[[/footnote]], wearing a black hat and business suit, emerges out of frame behind Subject A. He sits down on the other chair.//

**Subject A:** How did it go?

**Subject B:** You mean the "interview"?

**Subject A:** Yeah, that one.

**Subject B:** Tried to help them. You know what they did? They put a file on me and they're blaming me for everything that happens to them. Apparently, it's my fault for trying to help[[footnote]]Although not heard distinctly due to Subject B muttering under his breath, the words //"should've been Thaumiel instead"// can be discerned from repeated listens in the recording.[[/footnote]].

**Subject A:** They've always been a glass half empty kind of people. //(Subject A laughs as he brings out a bottle of whisky and a drinking glass.)//

**Subject B:** I can't tell if they're too paranoid or genuinely stupid. Give me some of that. //(Subject B gestures to Subject A.)// I need a drink.

//A third appendage emerges from within Subject A's coat with another drinking glass as he pours the bottle into both glasses. He puts the bottle on the table and pushes one of the glasses towards Subject B.//

**Subject B:** Thank you, Mister [INAUDIBLE][[footnote]]The following audio is distorted and garbled. This appears to have been purposely censored.[[/footnote]].

**Subject A:** Please, this isn't work. We've both earned this. Call me Fred.

**Subject B:** Alright. //(Subject B takes a sip of his drink.)// Whatever you say, "Fred".

**Subject A:** No problem, "Tony".

//Both subjects laugh for a while before falling silent. Subject A takes out a cigarette and gestures to Subject B but declines. Subject A then pulls out a lighter with his third appendage as he lights the cigarette and begins smoking.//

**Subject A:** You think they understood?

**Subject B:** About what? //(Subject B drinks his share and proceeds to pour another into the glass.)//

**Subject A:** You know... **her**.

**Subject B:** I told them what they needed to know. Besides-

//Subject B tilts his head to glance down the hallway.//

**Subject B:** She won't be a problem for a while.

**Subject A:** You know what needs to be done once they hit one billion, right?

**Subject B:** I do. Christ, I just hope it never comes to that. I don't think I can deal with [INAUDIBLE] again.

**Subject A:** You have to. She'll come back. Reborn anew. //(Subject drinks from his glass.)//

**Subject B:** Hmm... you think they figured it out?

**Subject A:** Figure what out?

**Subject B:** About all of this.

**Subject A:** I doubt it. Even if they do, I've left this place... all of this in very capable hands of associates I trust. They'll dispel anything that could tie us to this. This place right here? This is a secure place where nobody knows. Where no one needs to know.

**Subject B:** But what if they do?

//Subject A pauses.//

**Subject A:** It doesn't matter. We don't have to find a solution to a problem that doesn't even exist.

//Subject A clears his throat and looks at his watch.//

**Subject A:** Well, I believe that's all the time we have for now. I'll be on my way. I've got some work to do.

**Subject B:** Sure. Thanks for the drink.

**Subject A:** No need to thank me. You've earned it.

//Subject A grabs the glasses and the bottle and puts it inside his coat. Before Subject A walks off-camera, he stops and turns around.//

**Subject A:** Oh, by the way?

**Subject B:** Yes?

**Subject A:** Ah... before you go, don't forget to lock up before you leave. Lock the windows, doors, and uh... yeah, that's it.

**Subject B:** //(Subject B nods.)// Will do.

//Subject A walks out of frame as his steps steadily grow silent. Subject B looks around the room as he puts his hands together and locks his fingers.//

**Subject B:** Yeah, I still don't miss this body.

//Video footage ends.//

[[collapsible show="+ Access Addendum" hide="- Credentials Accepted"]]

> __**First Room**__
> **Description:** A small, rotating pyramid hovers upside-down over a pedestal. The object glows with a golden hue. The interior of the room along with the pedestal itself possesses Escherian geometry with increasingly complex fractal shapes that emerge when the object is observed from different angles.
> **Note:** //"can't let the architect or the craftsman near it."//

> __**Second Room**__
> **Description:** Image captures a large ruined book resting on a pedestal from the top down. The book expands and contracts as if it breathes.
> **Note:** The handwriting on the note is illegible and cannot be understood.

> __**Third Room**__
> **Description:** A fixed view of a white crib that lies in the back wall. A quiet wailing noise can be heard from the crib. The room does not appear to have a ceiling.
> **Note:** N/A

> __**Fourth Room**__
> **Description:** The room is perceived to be full of water and lacks any walls, floors, or ceiling while an indistinct outline of an unidentified aquatic entity remains stationary in front of the viewer. Subjects that look too long at the entity develop an aversion to water and a sense of being watched. These effects dissipate shortly after letting go of the knob.
> **Note:** N/A

> __**Fifth Room**__
> **Description:** Room is depicted as a dark red hue. Individuals report hearing soft whispering, light knocking, and scratching that slowly increases in loudness and intensity until the noises begin overlapping one another; eventually culminating into visual static.
> **Note:** N/A

> __**Sixth Room**__
> **Description:** Unlike the other rooms, the door's lock and knob has been destroyed. Inside, the room is empty save for the pedestal at the center. Broken glass and two bullet casings are scattered around the chamber. Touching the doorknob does not register an image.
> **Note:** //"no touching. use for contingencies only."//

At the end of the hallway is a large door with an [[[SCP-4099|altered Foundation insignia]]] engraved at the center. The door's padlock displays damage such as scratch marks and deformities consistent with terminal ballistics. Despite the disfigurement, the lock still holds and the door cannot be opened. Three bullet casings can be found lying in front of the door. Holding the doorknob does not give a mental picture on what lies inside.

Analysis of the door's makeup has revealed it to be composed of beryllium copper that's been lined with an unknown alloy that causes [[[SCP-148|migraines and speech impediment]]] when exposed in the vicinity of human beings. A closer analysis of the material warrants further investigation.
