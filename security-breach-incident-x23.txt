title:Security Breach Incident X23
**Security Breach Incident - X23:**  On  ██/.██/██,  SCP Sites 17 and [REDACTED] were simultaneously breached by operatives from an organization known to the foundation only as ‘The Serpent’s Hand’.

**[REDACTED]:**  Security breached by two individuals using ████████████████; all video systems and automated defenses [DATA EXPUNGED].   Counter measures against further attempts have been executed.
The intrusion into [REDACTED] seems to have been for the purpose of using [[[SCP-914]]]; knowledge of the intruder’s use of SCP-914 is only known due to the intruders interruption of Dr. ██████ during routine testing.  Dr.  ██████ seems to have been [DATA EXPUNGED], resulting in the intrusion’s only personnel casualty.  

[[[SCP-407]]] seems to have been deleted from the Foundation's system.  Whether this means the file has been completely destroyed, or possibly in the hands of this rogue group, is unknown.


**Site-17 Breach:**  The breach of Site-17 seems to have been the second of two break ins into SCP properties by ██████████, known to the foundation as “L.S.”  This individual was responsible for a previous security breach, having coordinated the theft of [[[SCP-268]]].  Though [DATA EXPUNGED], it is evident from video surveillance that SCP-268 was involved in this infiltration.  

The intruder known as L.S. seems to have simply walked into Site-17.  Due to the infiltrators use of SCP-268, guards and other personnel were unaware of the intruder’s presence.  “L.S.” seems to have headed straight for a room which at the time contained [[[SCP-242]]], which was on Site-17 after testing on humanoid SCP's was approved by [DATA EXPUNGED]. 

The intruder seems to have taken SCP-242 to [[[SCP-781]]]’s chamber, inducing a severe personality change in SCP-781.
The intrusion was discovered at this point, when SCP-781 violently attempted to escape the facility.  SCP-781 was terminated, and measures were taken to contain the subject.

A short printed note was found in SCP-781's chamber; this note is the only insight the Foundation currently has of the group responsible for this incident. [See Document X23-01]


**Document X23-01:** 
> Dear Sirs of the Foundation,
> 
> You hide behind guns and protocol; you chain that which you cannot understand, because you are yourselves bound by the far stronger chains of fear, trapped in a cage of your own making.  The flocks of the unwise do not need shepherds; so long as they are led the sheep will not look into the eyes of the evening wolves and hold their ground.  You would trap the angels themselves with three digits and four walls, bind Black Surt himself to measures and science.  
> 
> Old gods that we all are, you contain those who would take man beyond the mundane.  And yet, you perpetrate far worse than that you would contain; you dare cripple the souls of the innocent and proud to protect the fearful and unwise from their reality. Your actions do not show a respect for life, but for order.  You designate chaos your enemy, not destruction.
> The Garden is the Serpent’s Place; the divinities of fear and order who come to walk in the cool evenings are only visitors.  The world reaffirms life in the end; perhaps not the same life, but from the stagnant ashes of the new rises the world of tomorrow.
> 
> You meddle in matters you do not understand; your arrogance makes no allowances for the secrets of darkness, even as you walk blinded by the light.  
> 
> Signed Sincerely,
> L.S.
> 
> P.S. - You’ll thank me for deleting what you call ‘407’.
