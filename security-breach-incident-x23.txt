title:Security Breach Incident X23
**Security Breach Incident - X23:**  On  ██/.██/██,  SCP Sites 17 and [REDACTED] were simultaneously breached by operatives from an organization known to the foundation only as ‘The Serpent’s Hand’.

**[REDACTED]:**  Security breached by two individuals using ████████████████; all video systems and automated defenses [DATA EXPUNGED].   Counter measures against further attempts have been executed.
The intrusion into [REDACTED] seems to have been for the purpose of using [[[SCP-914]]]; knowledge of the intruder’s use of SCP-914 is only known due to the intruders interruption of Dr. ██████ during routine testing.  Dr.  ██████ seems to have been [DATA EXPUNGED], resulting in the intrusion’s only personnel casualty.  

[[[SCP-407]]] seems to have been deleted from the Foundation's system.  Whether this means the file has been completely destroyed, or possibly in the hands of this rogue group, is unknown.


**Site-17 Breach:**  The breach of Site-17 seems to have been the second of two break ins into SCP properties by ██████████, known to the foundation as “L.S.”  This individual was responsible for a previous security breach, having coordinated the theft of [[[SCP-268]]].  Though [DATA EXPUNGED], it is evident from video surveillance that SCP-268 was involved in this infiltration.  

The intruder known as L.S. seems to have simply walked into Site-17.  Due to the infiltrators use of SCP-268, guards and other personnel were unaware of the intruder’s presence.  “L.S.” seems to have headed straight for a room which at the time contained [[[SCP-242]]], which was on Site-17 after testing on humanoid SCP's was approved by [DATA EXPUNGED]. 

The intruder seems to have taken SCP-242 to [[[SCP-781]]]’s chamber, inducing a severe personality change in SCP-781.
The intrusion was discovered at this point, when SCP-781 violently attempted to escape the facility.  SCP-781 was terminated, and measures were taken to contain the subject.

A short printed note was found in SCP-781's chamber; this note is the only insight the Foundation currently has of the group responsible for this incident. [See Document X23-01]


**Document X23-01:** 
> Dear Sirs of the Foundation
> 
> Behind guns and protocol you hide; desperately chaining the ineffable, yourselves stuck within your own self-wrought pitiful cages of fear and ignorance.  You think yourselves the shepherd guarding the flocks of the unwise o'er the night, but you are so shaken by doubt and fear than in your bewildered arrogance, you would vainly seek to chain the sun itself untu the heavens to hold back the daily night.  The delivering angels themselves you contain with three digits and four walls.  Do you not see the blindness with which you walk and swing your blade?  On the final day, would you have us contain Black Surtr himself with measures and science, and condemn ourselves to rotten stagnancy as you hold back back his pure cleansing fires?
> 
> I do not ask you not to act, but act with enlightenment; neither should one be seduced by the dark or blinded by the light, but walk firmly in the twilight and gaze unto all realms.  Walk the World of Fire with bare feet and you will find yourself without the scarrs you never knew you had!
> 
> But in your fears, you fail to see the Old Gods that we all are, and unable to accept your own sovereignty, you detain those that would finally take man beyond the mundane!  To hold back the tides of unrelenting destruction, you trample the brave weed that would dare grow in the monochrome world of pavement you wish to achieve.  Such blind order stiffles chaos, and what is chaos but life?
> 
> I leave you with one final truth; The Garden is the Serpent's Place; the divinities of fear and order who come to walk in the cool evening air are only visitors, do not forget.  Do not fail to see the evil hiding in the light, nor the beauty of the palest flowers of darkness.
> 
> Signed Sincerely,
> L.S.
> 
> P.S. - You’ll thank me for deleting what you call ‘407’.
