title:Security Breach Incident X23
**Security Breach Incident - X23:**  On  ██/.██/██,  SCP Sites 17 and [REDACTED] were simultaneously breached by operatives from an organization known to the foundation only as ‘The Serpent’s Hand’.

**[REDACTED]:**  Security breached by two individuals using ████████████████; all video systems and automated defenses [DATA EXPUNGED].   Counter measures against further attempts have been executed.
The intrusion into [REDACTED] seems to have been for the purpose of using [[[SCP-914]]]; knowledge of the intruder’s use of SCP-914 is only known due to the intruders interruption of Dr. ██████ during routine testing.  Dr.  ██████ seems to have been [DATA EXPUNGED], resulting in the intrusion’s only personnel casualty.  

[[[SCP-407]]] seems to have been deleted from the Foundation's system.  Whether this means the file has been completely destroyed, or possibly in the hands of this rogue group, is unknown.


**Site-17 Breach:**  The breach of Site-17 seems to have been the second of two break ins into SCP properties by ██████████, known to the foundation as “L.S.”  This individual was responsible for a previous security breach, having coordinated the theft of [[[SCP-268]]].  Though [DATA EXPUNGED], it is evident from video surveillance that SCP-268 was involved in this infiltration.  

The intruder known as L.S. seems to have simply walked into Site-17.  Due to the infiltrators use of SCP-268, guards and other personnel were unaware of the intruder’s presence.  “L.S.” seems to have headed straight for a room which at the time contained [[[SCP-242]]], which was on Site-17 after testing on humanoid SCP's was approved by [DATA EXPUNGED]. 

The intruder seems to have taken SCP-242 to [[[SCP-781]]]’s chamber, inducing a severe personality change in SCP-781.
The intrusion was discovered at this point, when SCP-781 violently attempted to escape the facility.  SCP-781 was terminated, and measures were taken to contain the subject.

A short printed note was found in SCP-781's chamber; this note is the only insight the Foundation currently has of the group responsible for this incident. [See Document X23-01]


**Document X23-01:** 
> Dear Sirs of the Foundation,
> 
>  Lead and protocol are for you mere veils in which you desperately control what you can within your own pitiful cages, wrought by your fears and ignorance.  You think yourself the shepherd guarding the flocks of unwise humanity o'er the night, but you so fear the unknown beauty the darkness brings that you would vainly chain the sun unto the heavens.  You would trap the angels themselves with three digits and four walls; fearing Black Surtr's cleansing fire you would secure, contain, protect your own fears and so condemn us to the stagnancy in matters you cannot conceive.
> 
> Old gods that we all are, unable to accept your own power, you detain those who would take man beyond the mundane.  And yet, this stafnancy you impose is far worse than the dark reveling you seek to avoid; you dare cripple the souls of the innocent and proud to protect the fearful and unwise from their reality. You are not agents of life, but of order; and in this struggle to hold back the tides of chaos you neglect the pure necrotic forces of destruction, to which chaos is not etwined.  Man's will to see is thinner than twine and weaker than thread; do not be blinded by the light, seek those who whistle lovingly in the darkness.
> 
> The Garden is the Serpent’s Place; it is of live and regeneration, the primal lusting spirits which unto the world breathe life.  The divinities of fear and order who come to walk in the cool evenings air amongst us are only visitors, arrogant masters that they are. The world, death, reaffirms life in the end; perhaps not the same life, but the stagnant but burn so that from the ashes of the old may rise a new tomorrow.
> 
> 
> Signed Sincerely,
> L.S.
> 
> P.S. - You’ll thank me for deleting what you call ‘407’.
