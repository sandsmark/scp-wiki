**Item #:** SCP-2001-J

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Samples of SCP-2001-J are to be thoroughly destroyed after testing.

**Description:** SCP-2001-J is a species of mammalian gut flora which is a variant of //Lactobacillus reuteri//. Upon consumption of foodstuff contaminated by SCP-2001-J, a mammal's native population of //Lactobacillus reuteri// will be replaced by SCP-2001-J. This process occurs over a period of two to three days, and typically goes unnoticed by the host organism.

When a coherent population of SCP-2001-J is agitated, as may occur due to gastrointestinal stresses, they adhere to one another, a process which is facilitated by rapid generation of cobalamin. SCP-2001-J bacteria will align along the common axis of cobalamin generation. This process causes a thin, unicellular sheet of SCP-2001-J to form. When agitation ceases, SCP-2001-J will coherently bioluminesce along the axis perpendicular to the sheet. The degree of luminescence involved is in the order of 3 watts per SCP-2001-J bacterium, however, the luminescence will typically cease after approximately 50 milliseconds. This results in a directed, coherent light source similar to that of a multiple kilowatt laser, projected from the posterior of the infectee.

**Addendum 1:** Research into weaponising SCP-2001-J is ongoing.

**Addendum 2:** The first MTF team equipped exclusively with SCP-2001-J infections, "Laser Butt Squad", has been created to combat the spread of [[[SCP-789-J]]].
