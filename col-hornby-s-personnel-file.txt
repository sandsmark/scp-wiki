[[tab Psychological Evaluation]]

+ **Psychological Evaluation**

Col. Hornby suffers from major depressive disorder and displays symptoms of paranoid personality disorder. He has proven capable of setting aside his psychological difficulties when in crisis situations and when presented with situations he considers mentally challenging. After the conclusion of crises, however, Hornby tends to struggle with his depression, and has expressed thoughts of suicide on multiple occasions.

The depression is manageable with regular counseling and medication. Col. Hornby refuses treatment for his paranoia, crediting it with his continued survival.

> **Addendum:** Col. Hornby is no longer permitted to check out M18A1 Claymore antipersonnel mines from the armory “for personnel use”. //Hornby, you have six locks on your door already. You don’t need to booby-trap it. – O5-█//
