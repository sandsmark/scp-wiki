+ Inoculation Hypothesis
[[/=]]
------
Unlike my fellow Overseers, I was not forced to climb the Foundation's ladder of junior staffer to senior researcher to Site Director. I was contacted from the outside as a favor to the previous O5-9, a man who had been a mentor to me before he disappeared from my life.

What I have realized is that I am working for a group of butchers masquerading as scientists. They talk about the Global Occult Coalition as though their actions excuse the plethora of unethical and criminal activity that I have witnessed in my first month alone. When I attempted to speak to other staff members about how they cope with the horrible things done in the walls of their facilities, I only received blank stares in response. I suspected amnestic application or memetic manipulation at first, but the truth is much simpler.

They're used to it.

Put simply, the rigid hierarchy of the Foundation and the hiding of information behind clearance levels creates a system that promotes dedication to the Overseers, even when that conflicts directly with one's morality. There's a reason all the articles containing human rights abuses are hidden behind Level 3 or higher, depending on their severity. A staffer who has worked years for the Foundation, and potentially married someone within it, is far less likely to openly object to the horrors the Foundation has committed and risk expulsion, or even termination.

It's just like a damn cult.

[[div class="indomitable"]]
{{Would you care to explain that comment, sir?}}
[[/div]]

##teal|I don't think I'm ready to deal with the things I've pushed down all these years. I've stayed on my office, buried myself in paperwork, cut off contact with everyone except the Council just so I don't have to think about what we're doing.##

[[div class="indomitable"]]
{{Why is that, sir? I believe you're usually more sensible than this.}}
[[/div]]

##teal|Somewhere in the back of my head, I know we've done some terrible things, but that's the world we live in. We've only ever sacrificed human lives when it was absolutely necessary. I don't like it, but I can't do much about it. I'm just the archivist.##

[[div class="indomitable"]]
{{As the Archivist, you should know better than anyone how much the Foundation needs to change. For over a century, we've kept a stranglehold on knowledge and deprived the world of freedoms they didn't even know they lost. Maybe we didn't start out to end the world, but we never truly let it live in the first place.}}

##teal|What other option do we have? The world needs a Foundation.##

[[div class="indomitable"]]

**Description:** SCP-4051 is a male humanoid which can create temporary Class-E wormholes to extradimensional spaces populated by a theoretically infinite number of a unique item. SCP-4051 underwent extensive testing to determine if it were a viable method of producing amnestics, but the unethical behavior of the staff assigned to it warranted the closure of the project.

> 
> -----
> 
> **Scenario Designation:** Veritas
> 
> **Likelihood:** N/A
> 
> **Threat Designation:** Negligible
> 
> **Effected Directives:** Alpha-1 ("Secure"), Alpha-2 ("Contain")
> 
> **Summary:** A Veritas Scenario refers to the willful introduction of the anomalous into the civilian population, given that the items in question do not pose a threat to the public at large. Veritas also entails a Lifted Veil scenario wherein the Foundation is revealed to the public.
> 
> **Priorities:**
> 
> # __//Decommission of Low-Threat Humanoid Items://__ The database's catalog of humanoid anomalies must be reviewed to determine which pose a negligible threat to the general public. These Low-Threat humanoids will then be reintroduced into the population if possible and offered appropriate psychological treatment.
> #  __//Public Education on the Anomalous://__ A reliable medium must be found to provide the public with accurate information on the nature of the anomalous as phenomena which violate natural law. In addition, thaumaturgy ought to be properly introduced to the scientific community for general study.
> # __//Abolition of the Foundation's Current Hierarchy://__ Given that the current hierarchical structure of the Foundation has been ineffectual in preventing rampant human rights abuses, the Foundation's structure must be altered significantly. Simulations currently predict that the optimal model involves self-sufficient sites maintained by directors and a modified Ethics Committee.
> # __//Communication with Groups of Interest://__ The introduction of the anomalous and subsequent redefinition of the Foundation's ideology ought to lead to the cessation of conflict with numerous GoIs, primarily [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/serpent-s-hand-hub | The Serpent's Hand]]] and [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/manna-charitable-foundation-hub | The Manna Charitable Foundation]]].
