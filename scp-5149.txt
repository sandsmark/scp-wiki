**Special Containment Procedures:** Efforts to trace the source of SCP-5149 are ongoing.

**Description:** SCP-5149 is a radio signal of unknown origin being received by Lunar Site-35 every 24 hours. Attempts to locate the source of SCP-5149 have been inconclusive, though it has been ascertained that the signal is coming from outside the Solar System.

SCP-5149 consists of a short repeating message in UTF-8. The message is constructed of a series of forty-four dots laid out in a complex position pattern, interspersed with empty space in certain locations. Due to the extrasolar nature of SCP-5149's origin, this is believed to be an extraterrestrial communication or language system. At the moment, decryption of SCP-5149 is considered a Class-A priority; a team of cryptographers, linguists, and radio technicians are stations at Lunar Site-34 for this purpose.

**Attempt Log:**

||~ Attempt # ||~ Date ||~ Comment ||~ Output ||
|| 1 || 1.30.14 || Ran it through all modern language translation systems for similarities. A formality. || ##red|**Translation Failed.**## ||
|| 2 || 2.03.14 || Ran it against dot-based ancient languages --  no distinct similarities. ||  ##red|**Translation Failed.**## ||
|| 3 || 2.07.14 || Ran a new task on the analysis computers -- attempting to discern the complexity of a dot-based language. ||  ##red|**Translation Failed.**## ||
||||||||= [145 lines ommitted ]||
|| 149 || 5.29.14 || New analysis computers arrived, broke them in by trying to simulate all possible divisions of the message.|| ##red|**Translation Failed.**## ||
|| 150 || 6.30.14 || Manipulated base through flips, rotations, reflections, and several stretches and compressions before putting it through previous suite of analyses.||  ##red|**Translation Failed.**## ||
||||||||= [96 lines ommitted ]||
|| 247 || 10.01.14 || Not message at all? Maybe art? Compare for logical consistencies or repetitions of symbols to confirm if even language. || ##red|**Translation Failed.**## ||
|| 248 || 10.13.14 || Connect the dots? Worth a try. || ##red|**Translation Failed.**## ||
|| 249 || 10.20.14 || Greenhorn suggested we run it through nonverbal languages screener -- poor guy thinks it'll really be that easy. || ##green|**Translation Success!**##||

Within .5 seconds of the scanning, screener had produced an English translation of SCP-5149. It was realized that no individual on the project had recognized the transmission as a form of Braille. Disciplinary consequences are current pending.
