//Did you know that birds have their own gods? Well, "gods" is kind of a term we're not meant to use. We're supposed to use "Apex-tier Pluripotent Entity", but nobody around's gonna enforce that, so why bother?//

//Anyway, one day, we did something to piss off one of the gods. He got so angry that he came down from his high-and-mighty throne in who-knows-where and tried to wipe the human population off the face of the Earth by giving them bird minds. It worked, and now I think we're all screwed.//

//Who are we? We're MTF-Eta-4, otherwise known as "Begone Thoth". I swear to Medila, I'm going to track down and peck whoever decided on that name. I digress. It's our job to uphold the mission of the Old Foundation. Seventy-five birds against seven billion humans, a god, and Medila-knows how many anomalies (some of them from Thoth himself). The odds are bleak, I know. But we've got brains, determination, and a whole lotta bird-power. If we pull this off right, we can stop this apocalypse.//

//Medila help us all.//

- Dr. Frederick Hoygull, Avian Division Head
