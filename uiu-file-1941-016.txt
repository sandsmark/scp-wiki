[[size 120%]] **UIU File 1941-016:** Chicago Revenant[[/size]]
Summary: A series of murders (currently numbering six) of victims associated with the anomalous criminal organization [[[chicago-spirit|"Chicago Spirit"]]]. All victims have been found dead, mostly by varying supernatural methods.

Each death was reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigations via an anonymous tip, by an individual identifying as "Mr. Night". These tips were investigated by the Unusual Incidents Unit, as a result of their usage of certain phrases.

Evidence suggests that all murders were committed by this same, currently unidentified individual. This suspect may have been a member or leader of the now-defunct criminal syndicate, the Chicago Spirit.

[[tab Suspect Description/Capabilities]]

**Name:** Mr. Night

**Irregularity Cross-reference:** Human, Gangster, Chicago Spirit, Fugitive

**Physical Description:** 

||~ Sex ||~ Height ||~ Weight/Build ||~ Race ||~ Hair ||~ Eyes ||~ Identifying Attributes ||
|| Male || Unknown || Unknown/Slender || Polish (unconfirmed) || Black || Unknown || Frequently associated with being "disheveled" or [[[SCP-982|"unwashed"]]] ||
//(Note: Identification of Mr. Night as Polish comes from a remark assigning him an Polish accent.)//

**Capabilities:** Suspect possesses numerous, unidentified anomalous abilities. As the suspect has never been directly observed, and only the aftermath of actions, exact identification of its capabilities is not possible.

The suspect has been responsible for the anomalous murder of five victims, in addition to the non-anomalous murder of one more victim. The nature of these murders has varied between each victim, which each being obviously anomalous. A full record of the nature of these methods may be found under the Evidence associated with the case file.

As the suspect was believed to have been associated with the Chicago Spirit, he likely possesses additional, unknown anomalous capabilities.

**Purpose/Motive:** Based on the limited evidence available to the Unusual Incidents Unit, it appears that the suspect is attempting to obscure all information concerning the Chicago Spirit. It appears that the suspect is prioritizing individuals who were closely involved with the anomalous aspects of the crime syndicate.

**Modus Operandi:** The suspect is completing its agenda by eliminating all remaining individuals with a connection to the Chicago Spirit, and murdering them in varying ways. After finishing each murder, the suspect has evidently delivered an anonymous tip to the local FBI department, reporting the most recent murder. The suspect has evidently warned one victim prior to murdering them; it is unknown if any of the others were given an advance indication.

**Behavior:** Suspect has not been directly observed while eliminating former members of the Chicago Spirit, and has apparently taken care to prevent any trace of his involvement with the deaths. The suspect has varied the nature of all anomalous murders committed, for a currently unknown reason. The suspect appears to be unafraid of being captured by the Unusual Incidents Unit, indicated by its self-reporting of the murders.

[[tab Evidence]]
[[include component:image-block name=UIU.JPG|caption=The corpse of Julius McGallan, shortly after discovery. Victim had been deceased for no more than two hours.]]

**A: Riley O'Callahan** On October 17th, 1941, Riley O'Callahan was discovered dismembered in his personal residence in Chicago. Each of the victim's bones had been removed and neatly arranged next to the rest of his body.

Riley O'Callahan had previously worked as the manager of the largest speakeasy controlled by the Chicago Spirit. Evidence suggests that Riley O'Callahan had been highly involved with the upper management of the Chicago Spirit.

**B: Julius "Sawteeth" McGallan** On October 31st, 1941 Julius McGallan was discovered in a state of advanced mummification. Forensic evidence suggested that the victim had been deceased for an extended period of time, likely ten years or more. However, the victim had been seen entering his residence two hours earlier.

The only unidentified individual in the area was a "dirty Pole, probably a drunkard" seen in the area approximately six hours before the murder by a neighbour of Julius McGallan.

Julius McGallan had been a member of the primary leadership of the Chicago Spirit, having joined the outfit in 1899 after being discovered by the founder, Richard Chappell. Julius McGallan had avoided being apprehended by the UIU following the dissolution of the group, as had all leaders. For more information, see the file UIU file on the Chicago Spirit.

**C: Al Seward** On November 20th, 1941, Al Seward was discovered in a hotel, having been had all bodily organs anomalously inverted. Crime scene analysis suggests that Al Seward may have remained alive in this state for as long as twenty minutes following this event.

Al Seward had been employed as a bodyguard of Richard Chappell, the leader of the Chicago Spirit. Mr. Seward was also suspected of having orchestrated several assassinations on the behalf of Mr. Chappell.

**D: Vasily Sokolov** On December 24th, 1941, Vasily Sokolov entered Trinity Hospital, █████████, Florida. At the time, Vasily displayed symptoms of hypothermia, despite outside temperatures measuring approximately 65° F. Hospital staff were unprepared to treat hypothermia and Vasily died later that day.

Vasily Sokolov had previously acted as an intermediate between the Chicago Spirit and the Russian Mafia.

**E: Jack Pillston** On January 8th, 1942, the body of Jack Pillston was recovered in his personal residence. Cause of death was nonanomalous, having been shot once between the eyes. Jack Pillston had worked as an accountant within the Chicago Spirit, prior to it's dissolution in 1938.

One unidentified individual was recorded as having entered the apartment building in which Jack Pillston lived, and exiting five minutes later. This suspect was described as being disheveled, and apparently homeless.

**F: Unidentified Communication** The following letter was discovered clenched in the fist of Jack Pillston's dead body at the time of discovery by the Unusual Incidents Unit.

Jack, 

I just want you to know that you were always one of my favorites from those days back in the Spirit. Did what you were told, didn't ask too many questions. Exactly what I look for in my subordinates. Almost makes me wish I could give you a second chance, but I've set my mind.

I'm just doing some cleaning, with regard to the Spirit. You're smart enough to get what I mean by that.

I thought I'd give you some time to get your things in order before the end. I liked you, kid. Not enough for me to leave you off the list, but enough for a little kindness before the end. I'll be around in two days, so do whatever you gotta do before then.

For you, I promise it'll be quick.

**G: Anthony Dorfman** On February 14th, 1942, Anthony Dorfman, a former Chicago Spirit bootlegger, disappeared from UIU custody. An unidentified dead body was discovered within his holding cell. No cause of death could be determined for the body.

No individuals were observed leaving or entering the holding cell prior to the disappearance of Anthony Dorfman, although one guard reported seeing a "strange Polish man" outside the building ten minutes earlier.

Check out the basement.

Sawteeth was a good partner, but his time came up. Surprised he managed to remain free for so long, but the past catches back up to all of us.

I remember how the Russian used to boast that he was never bothered by the Chicago winters. I always hated how smug he was about it.

I was sorry about this one. Jack was a good kid, but he knew too much. Shame, really.

**28/1/1942:** Four remaining Chicago Spirit members voluntarily turn themselves over into UIU custody, citing rumors concerning the previous murders committed. These individuals enter a plea deal, agreeing to cooperate with the UIU in exchange for protection.

**14/2/1942:** Anthony Dorfman, one of the four Chicago Spirit members who entered UIU custody on 28/1/1942, disappears from UIU custody and is replaced by a dead body. (Evidence G). A tip is received from Mr. Night, which is included below.
[[div style="border:dashed 1px #999999; background: #ffffff; margin-left: 3px; margin-right: 3px; padding: 4px; margin-top: 10px; "]]
You should already know something happened to Dorfman. The UIU isn't __that__ useless, after all. 

Sorry for the mess this is causing you folks, but I've got to wrap up some loose ends.
 
If you're still going to try and find me, well, good luck with that. Chappell tried for years and never did.
