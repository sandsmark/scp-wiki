So this is probably where I'd add an inspirational quote, but I'm not that smart. Or inspirational for that matter. Any-who: Welcome to HunterDog's totally original page, this is 100% (of 0%) the first article ever made (it definitely isn't) and is completely the first like this. I don't have a character or whatever, I make up my own, as Dr. Dog just isn't it, so it's not like a personnel page or anything.
Anyway, I like food, so I'm probably just gonna stick some pictures of food I like:

Anyway that concludes my presentation about food. Man I love food. I rate it all food/food. (Except for the Zebra, which was pretty fuckin' cute.)

Hey! I made some stuff (surprisingly.)
@@ @@
[[[SCP-5450]]] - Fintastic Soup, figures. It's food, but when eaten. You become shark-ized. Maybe Sharkinator-9000 would have been a better name. Yeah, probably not. Made it in seven hours for Jam-Con 2020.

[[[SCP-5750]]] - Can't say no to cookies! Man I crave some thin mints now. Seriously though they are delicious. Made this in six hours for Jam-Con 2020.

[[[SCP-5950]]] - Bow for Beginners. Self explanatory, nothing wrong in this article at all. Just a totally normal bow, but for beginners. Made this in two hours for Jam-Con 2020.

[[[SCP-5250]]] - Carla, Your New Best Friend!~ - Stop trying to sell me damn cookies, I already crave them enough. Made this in eight hours for Jam-Con 2020.

[[[critter-profile-potoooooooo|Critter Profile: Potoooooooo]]] - Even if I made him, I still love him. My first article! Made this in a day for Jam-Con 2020.

[[tab About Me]]
So now I gotta make a page about myself? Who's idea was this. Anyway I'm HunterDog, or Dog. I love articles with a comedic, sad, or wholesome tone. Comedy articles are foremost my favorite, wholesome being next. Sad is the other emotion. I'm not the most emotional person, so good, sad pieces can spark something.

Seriously. Who's idea was this, it means I gotta write more. Yeesh.
So more things about me:
I love Wilsons Articles. Seriously, I love all the critters.
I don't really read any other GoI's other than wilsons.
I love silly ideas over serious ideas. While serious ideas are good for important pieces, I tend to actually prefer sillier articles.
I love food. Send me food articles. (Not Ambrose though.)
My favorite PoI is dado. Simple, makes sense if you get to know me. Send me dado SCPS.
I love the occasional long article. If it's kept me through, I don't mind the length.

Things I dislike:
Ambrose, just doesn't do it for me.
Prometheus Labs, similarly.
Horrible Comedy. Please, I love to laugh/smile.
Thaumiels (It must be an exceptional Thaumiel for me to like it.)

Seriously, why am I here. Oh yeah, the same reason everyone else is: stories!
Capture me, and I'll be a supporter.
