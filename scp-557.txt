**Item #:** SCP-557

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** As there is currently no way to move SCP-557, Research Facility ██ has been constructed atop it, placing Building ███ directly above the entrance to SCP-557.  Building ███ is to remained locked at all times.  Any requests to enter SCP-557 are to be submitted for O5 approval.

Any civilian approaching Research Facility ██ are to be given a Class-A Amnesiac and deposited 20-25 kilometers away from Research Facility ██.

No sapient SCP may be housed at Research Facility ██.  Additionally, following incident 557-1-166, all personnel entering SCP-557 are to travel in pairs.  Room 166 must remain locked at all times.  In addition, two motion-activated cameras attached to turrets are to be installed and remain operational.  No person is allowed access to room 166 for any reason.

**Description:** SCP-557 is an underground bunker constructed almost entirely of sandstone and mud bricks, and is comprised of five descending stories, of which roughly 1.25 km^^2^^ have been studied and documented. The floor of SCP-557 is littered with remains of long-dead individuals, which researchers have identified as belonging exclusively to males above sixteen years of age, many of which were outfitted in armor and carrying weapons. So far over █████ such remains have been found, leading researchers to believe that SCP-557 was intended and used as a military complex.  This hypothesis is supported by the presence of what appear to be defensive features, although the actual function of these features is uncertain, as some seem to face inward instead of outward.

The interior of SCP-557 shows signs of being renovated several times throughout its history, although the ground level, which consists of a single temple-like building of Mesopotamian design, has not been modified or redesigned.  The foundation of SCP-557, as well as all of its exterior and some interior walls, are comprised of sandstone bricks roughly 23 m^^3^^.  Interior partitions have been constructed in some of the larget chambers, primarily of mud brick; some sections of these partitions show signs of repeated repair and/or alteration.  To date, 173 chambers and ████ rooms have been found within SCP-557, ranging in size from roughly 3 m^^2^^ to ██ m^^2^^.  Room 166 has remained unmeasured, though it has been estimated to be over ████ m^^2^^ (See Addendum 557-1-166).

Many of the sandstone walls bear inscriptions in several ancient languages, including [DATA EXPUNGED].  Those portions which Foundation archaeologists have been able to decipher indicate that these inscriptions are in fact copies of the same information translated into a variety of languages.  The writings themselves describe what appear to be a variety of ritual practices and devices, some of the latter matching devices found within the complex (see below).  Instructions are provided for performance of these rituals, and the maintenance and operation of devices, with the stated purpose of restricting the abilities of an entity referred to only as "the prisoner".  As of Incident 557-1-166, the deciphering of the inscriptions has been deemed a top priority for Research Facility ██.

Several chambers on the fourth and fifth subterranean levels contain complex devices of unknown purpose and function, constructed of sandstone, fired pottery, lead, copper, bronze, iron, silver, gold, [REDACTED], human bone, [DATA EXPUNGED].  The techniques for producing some of these components were not present in the region until over ████ years after SCP-557 appears to have been constructed.  Many of the devices appear to have been driven by waterwheels powered by water diverted from a nearby aquifer.  The majority of these devices are no longer functional due to the decay of key components, though █ are still in operation.  In light of the events of Incident 557-1-166, any tampering or experimentation with any still-intact devices is strictly forbidden without authorization from Dr. J███.

In addition to stone stairwells, SCP-557 possesses what could best be described as a primitive elevator.  Two large sandstone cylinders, each two meters in radius and at least 17 m in height, are located in adjacent shafts that open onto each floor of the complex, and each cylinder carries [DATA EXPUNGED] which apparently controls the movement of the "platforms", with one platform rising when the other descends.  Neither platform will move if either is carrying more than █████ kg.  No power source has yet been determined for this system, and investigation of its mechanism has thus far been inconclusive.  SCP-557 also contains a number of other noteworthy features, including what appear to be drop-down blast doors, a variety of traps including pitfalls, deadfalls, wooden spears fired from concealed holes, [DATA EXPUNGED] many of which were inadvertently triggered before and during the Foundation's initial investigation of the site.  As with the elevator system, many of these systems utilize unknown and/or anachronistic mechanisms.

**Addendum 557-█:**  SCP-557 was found on 05-11-19██ near the southern coast of █████ during an archeological dig.  Due to the odd location of SCP-557 and the fact that no known Mesopotamian ruins are within several hundred kilometers of this location, the Foundation investigated.  At first thought to be an undiscovered Mesopotamian temple, SCP-557's nature was discovered when, during incident 557-F (See Addendum 557-F-5), the doors to SCP-557 were destroyed, revealing the subterranean portion of the structure.

**Incident 557-1-166:**
On ██-██-████, Agent O'Neil was monitoring Agent Messmer's progress through SCP-557 as part of the exploration of the site.  Agent Messmer was investigating and mapping the lowest level of SCP-557 at the time of the incident.  Below is a transcript of the recording which took place between Agent Messmer and Agent O'Neil during Incident 557-1-166:

>  Agent Messmer: Finally almost done with this corridor.   I should be o- [Agent Messmer's voice is cut off by the sound of the door to room 166 opening, followed by Agent Messmer's muffled gasp].  Ho..ly..
>  **Agent O'Neil:** Agent Messmer, what is it?  What are you seeing?
>  [Roughly two minutes of silence elapses here, interrupted only by the sound of Agent Messmer's footfalls and Agent O'Neil's requests for a response.]
>  **Agent Messmer:**  [Whispering] This is the most incredible thing I've seen...
>  **Agent O'Neil:**  Steven! What the hell is going on in there?  Respond!
>  At this point what sounds like numerous human voices speaking in unison is heard, using what Foundation linguists have identified as being a form of Sumerian.
>  **[Translation]:** [UNDECIPHERABLE]...cannot contain me forever.
>  **Agent Messmer:** What the fuck!  This thing... You're alive?
>  **[Translation]:** Human.  You have come unprepared.
>  **Agent Messmer:** What the fuck langua... [Agent Messmer begins screaming at this point, continuing to do so for 1 minute and 13 seconds, after which the transmission cuts to static.]
