**Item #:** SCP-896

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Physical containment of SCP-896 is impossible due to widespread public knowledge.  However, the anomalous properties of SCP-896 have been largely neutralized through Foundation efforts and the cooperation of ████ █████, the publishing and hosting company of SCP-896.  

Mobile Task Force Mu-4 (aka “Debuggers”) is assigned to monitor for any instances of any emulation (“emu”) servers running SCP-896’s original code.  All instances of SCP-896’s original code, in any media, are to be destroyed via incineration at any Foundation approved disposal site.  All users of the emu server must be quarantined and placed under observation for one week to determine if they have suffered the effects of SCP-896.  If any abnormalities are observed, the MTF field officer has the discretion to determine the appropriate action to ensure continued containment.  

The server cluster hosting SCP-896’s original code is to be housed at Site-15.  Five standard desktop computers are to be directly connected to the server with SCP-896-1 installed on each one.  SCP-896 may never be connected to the internet or any of Site-15’s networks, but may be regularly patched as needed by use of physical media.  

--Any personnel wishing to use SCP-896 must obtain permission from two Level 4 administrators.--  Foundation personnel may not use SCP-896 until further notice.  No personnel level 4 or above may use SCP-896 due to potential loss of valuable Foundation data.  Any class-D personnel used in testing of SCP-896 must be routinely monitored for the effects of SCP-896 and containment procedures must be tailored individually to ensure no security breaches occur.  


**Description:** SCP-896 is known to the public as ████ █ ████, a popular online role playing game.  The version of SCP-896 that the public uses has no anomalous effects.  However, the original code developed by ███ ████ exhibits effects that warrant ████ █ ████’s classification as an SCP.

SCP-896 functions as any normal online role playing game.  Users connect through a local client, SCP-896-1, and access a centralized server containing their character’s data.  Users interact socially and participate in combat oriented activities through the centralized server.  The primary goal of the game is to increase the user’s character’s power through gaining experience points (“leveling”) and statistical increase of attributes which mirror physical aspects (“stats”).  Users must create a character which functions as their online persona.  The user chooses the physical characteristics of their avatar as well as a name.  The character data is stored in SCP-896’s main server cluster.  

SCP-896’s abnormal behavior only manifests when a user creates an avatar which shares the exact first and last name of the user.  Once this occurs, the user is “imprinted” upon the avatar.  The imprinting only occurs if the user creates the avatar himself.  The imprinting will not occur if an individual attempts to create an avatar for another person.  Once imprinted, any changes to the avatar’s statistics and experience level will have a direct effect upon the user.  How this occurs is not well understood.  The current hypothesis is SCP-896 allows the user to exhibit a powerful “mind over matter” control over their body and surroundings.

There are six stats that directly affect the abilities of the user.  Raising the stats in game causes a corresponding increase in the physical or mental characteristics of the user.  The stats and their link to real physical abilities are described below.

__Strength (STR)__:  Self explanatory; as an avatar’s strength increase, so does the user’s.  
__Agility (AGI)__:  Highly agile users note a high accuracy of movement and control over their body.  This grace allows for a great speed of movement with no sacrifice of skill or accuracy of the desired action.
__Stamina (STA)__:  Increased stamina results in the ability to go longer without food or sleep, enhanced physical endurance, and even resistance to disease and physical damage.  
__Charisma (CHR)__:  Charisma is the statistic that most intrigues Command.  The more charisma a user accumulates, the more likeable a person becomes.  Although no mental compulsion or psychic activity has been detected; the user, through various forms of communication, is able to influence, if not directly control, the actions of other individuals.
__Intelligence (INT)__:  Higher intelligence leads to an increase in the information retention and problem solving capabilities of the user.
__Wisdom (WIS)__:  One of the strangest stats, Wisdom increases the ability of a user to apply one’s knowledge and understanding to present situations.  This ability is often called “common sense” or “street smarts.”  

Users increase their stats via the two main goals of the game, leveling and obtaining magical items.  Leveling is the safest way to increase one’s statistics, but the statistical gains are lower and the time required gain stats are greater.  Obtaining magical items is more difficult, but results in very high statistical gains.  Magic items are gained by adventuring in dangerous areas of SCP-896 in groups of three or more.  

Please note, avatars that perish in SCP-896 lose experience points.  Users with imprinted avatars will randomly lose a corresponding amount of their memory.  

**Recovery Log:** SCP-896’s effects were first noted during the beta test.  MTF Mu-4’s routine monitoring intercepted intra-office e-mails detailing the effects, and quickly moved in to secure SCP-896.  SCP-896 was already highly anticipated by the general public, so simply burying the project was not an option.  SCP-896 was released to the general public with significant code alterations to ensure SCP-896 would not exhibit anomalous behavior.  The old beta code was quickly patched, and SCP-896 was effectively contained.  

**Test Log SCP-896-A:**
Twenty groups of five class-D personnel were selected for testing, based upon their knowledge of computer gaming, compliance with Foundation instruction, and below average physical and mental characteristics.  Each class-D was assigned a role within the group designed to test one specific statistic.   What follows is a log of the testing on the only cohort who's characters did not die so many times as to render the testing ineffective.  For ease of reading, D-896-a through D-896-e are referred to by an alias describing their role, as follows:

__D-896-a__:  Knight - character focus on stamina.
__D-896-b__:  Berserker – character focus on strength.
__D-896-c__:  Cleric – character focus on wisdom.
__D-896-d__:  Warlock – character focus on intelligence.
__D-896-f__:  Bard – character focus on charisma.
  
**Test Log SCP-896-A3892:** 
**Testing Notes:**  All five class-D are imprinted upon their avatars.  The subjects proceeded to play for █ hours.  No abnormal behavior or abilities were displayed.  
**Character Statistics** [REDACTED]
**Results:**  All subjects underwent control tests to determine their baseline abilities.  After today’s session all subjects did not display any gains that were statistically relevant to our data set.    However, at low character experience statistic gains are minimal. 

**Test Log SCP-896-A3927:** 
**Testing Notes:**  The subjects have been playing for three days. 
**Character Statistics** [REDACTED]
**Results:**  Again, no progress has been demonstrated by any of the test subjects.   

**Test Log SCP-896-A3933:** 
**Testing Notes:**  The subjects have been playing for one week.  The subjects work well together and have begun searching more dangerous areas of SCP-896 for magical items.  
**Character Statistics** [REDACTED]
**Results:**  Subjects Knight and Berserker are showing improvement. Knight has been able to maintain a full sprint on the treadmill for two minutes longer, and displays an increased pain tolerance.  Berserker has begun to develop a more muscular physique and can lift █% more than control tests.  Bard’s abilities are hard to quantify, as expected.  Distressingly, Cleric and Warlock do not seem to be displaying increased abilities despite increased stats.

**Test Log SCP-896-A3935:** 
**Testing Notes:**  Dr. ███ has proposed the hypothesis that Cleric and Warlock require outside stimulation to showcase their abilities.  They most likely have increased mental abilities but lack a course of education required facilitate development of memory recall and problem solving capabilities.  We will begin providing them with literature to stimulate their intellectual abilities.

**Test Log SCP-896-A3939:** 
**Testing Notes:**  The subjects have been playing for two week.  Berserker broke his keyboard and mouse by gripping them.  Subject has been provided a custom made keyboard and mouse made of steel.  All subjects have begun to differ to Bard’s judgment of any situation and begun providing him all magical items, regardless of Bard’s actual need or use of the item.  
**Character Statistics** [REDACTED]
**Results:**  Berserker has been instructed to being to increase his agility statistic so he can better control his vastly improved strength.  Bard has been forbidden from speaking during testing to prevent self aggrandizement at the cost of the other test subjects’ focus.  Warlock and Cleric have begun to show marked improvement in intelligence and highly increased IQs.  Warlock is approaching savant level intelligence in all areas he is exposed too.  Cleric has begun conducting highly organized and logical debates with researchers regarding the ethics and purpose of SCP/human testing.  

**Test Log SCP-896-A3945:** 
**Testing Notes:**  Berserker and Knight quibbled over who should receive a magic item, and the argument turned violent.  Berserker was able to throw Knight into a containment wall before being subdued by security.  Knight was unharmed despite causing significant damage to the concrete wall.  
**Character Statistics** [REDACTED]
**Results:**  Berserker was easily subdued with the use of a taser.  Although he is physically very strong, he possesses no additional toughness or endurance.  The converse is true with Knight.  Although highly resistant to damage and physical pain, he is no stronger than his control test.  Berserker has been fitted with a standard Foundation shock collar to ensure compliance.  Cleric ceased debating with researchers, and has reached the conclusion that Foundation tests are necessary to ensure the continued survival of humanity.

 **Test Log SCP-896-A3947:** 
**Testing Notes:** Knight perished in game today, and lost █%  of his experience points.  Knight can no longer remember basic arithmetic or understand any numerical system.  Testing suspended until Knight relearns basic number comprehension.  Monthly Termination of all test subjects is also temporarily suspended.
**Character Statistics** [REDACTED]
**Results:**  During the test, Cleric realized he was running out of magical power to keep Knight alive during combat.  Cleric announced that it would be better that Knight perish while the rest of the group flee to avoid unnecessary loss of experience.  Although Knight objected, all remaining subjects fled and Knight died.  Cleric has requested researchers allow him to invest in intelligence statistics as well to increase his magical power.  His request is tentatively approved.  Berserker has seemingly reached a plateau of his physical abilities.  He claims he is no longer experiencing any increase of strength or agility despite continued gain in SCP-896.  Requesting additional security measures be considered in case he is falsifying his results.  

**Test Log SCP-896-A3955:** 
**Testing Notes:**  Bard was terminated today.  Foundation researcher █████ has elected to play Bard’s avatar to allow testing to continue.  
**Character Statistics** [REDACTED]
**Notes:**  Bard breached containment when the guard assigned to his containment cell released the lock.  Security footage shows that Bard merely smiled at the guard, and this prompted his release.  Bard walk to the cafeteria and made Foundation personnel make him steak and strawberry ice cream.  Upon completing his meal, he returned to his cell to sleep.  Command determined the threat presented by Bard’s continually developing abilities outweighed any further potential insights into SCP-896, and ordered his termination.  It is theorized that Bard only returned to his cell because the thought of escape from Foundation custody had not even crossed his mind.  His ability for mental suggestion did nothing to increase his below average intelligence.

**Test Log SCP-896-A3990:** 
**Testing Notes:**  Total containment breach of Knight, Berserker, and Warlock.  All three subjects terminated.  Testing discontinued.  
**Character Statistics** [REDACTED]
**Notes:**  The containment breach was engineered by Warlock.  Warlock had managed to develop a coded language by which he could communicate with Knight and Berserker through the chat system used in SCP-896.  While Berserker, Knight, and Warlock were led back to their containment cells by Foundation security, Berserker managed to remove his shock collar and kill █ guards.  His strength and speed were much higher than anticipated.  Berserker proceeded to free Warlock and Knight.  Warlock and Berserker made their way back to SCP-896’s containment cell.  Knight remained and resisted Foundation personnel attempting to re-establish containment.  Knight held off █ foundation personnel for ten minutes.  Standard issue firearms could not harm Knight.  Knight was eventually forced into a containment cell and terminated via asphyxiation, which took approximately twenty minutes.  No autopsy was performed on Knight due examiner’s inability to pierce his skin with medical instruments.  

Upon reaching SCP-896’s containment cell, Warlock told Berserker to open the cell.  Berserker was able to rip the Foundation security door off its hinges before dying.  Autopsies indicate the force required to remove the Foundation security door shattered █ bones in his body, and snapped his spine in three places.  Although Berserker was able generate enough force to accomplish this feat, his body could not handle the door’s weight or the effect of Newton’s third law.  

Warlock entered SCP-896’s containment and proceeded to access the game.  It took approximately seven minutes for him to decipher SCP-896’s source code and edit the hexadecimal code containing his character’s statistics.  Upon editing his stats to the maximum value allowed, Warlock vanished from containment.  To this date, Warlock or his remains have not been found.  Upon reviewing Warlock’s account information contained on SCP-896, researchers discovered a customer service notation simply stating “User has been banned for hacking.”

Cleric has successfully petitioned Command to suspend his termination.  Command has reviewed Cleric’s arguments and has determined he could potentially be a valuable asset to Foundation projects; based upon his heightened mental and logical abilities and his newfound commitment to our goals.  Cleric has been permanently assigned the designation SCP-896-3.  Research heads may request SCP-896-3’s assistance on any Safe level SCP’s.  


**Test Log SCP-896-B:** 
**Testing Notes:**  Testing has been requested involving using SCP-896 to create “blank” test subjects.  D-896-g is a 44 year old Caucasian male of average intelligence and health.  D-896-g will be repeatedly killed in SCP-896 to determine the viability of creating subjects with no memory, but otherwise perfect health.   
**Notes:**  D-896-g imprinted on his character.  D-896-g instructed to walk his character into a pit of lava.  D-896-g compiled.  D-896-g seized briefly then returns to consciousness.  EEG readings showed a massive spike of activity in random areas of D-896-g’s brain upon ‘death,’ but then ceased to register any electrical activity in that region afterwards, indicating permanent brain damage.  

D-896-f instructed to walk into the lava again.  Each time D-896-g lost more and more of his memory.  When instructed to die for the fifth time, D-896-g began to weep and stated he does not wish to forget anything else.  D-896-g is reminded he will be immediately terminated if he fails to comply.  D-896-g walked into the lava for the fifth time.  At this point D-896-g ceased to be able to effectively communicate.  It is also noticed that D-896-g could no longer blink.  Dr. ████ instructed D-896-g to walk into the lava again, but D-896-g could no longer understand commands issued to him.  Researcher ████ walked D-896-g’s avatar into the lava.  D-896-g collapsed.  Physicians determined that D-896-g has lost voluntary muscle control.  Dr. ████ decided to terminate the experiment and instructed Researcher ████ to walk D-896-g’s avatar into the lava.  D-896-g's cause of death was determined to be a combination of asphyxiation and cardiac arrest.


SCP-896 is not a viable way to create subjects without memory.  The loss of memory extends to muscle memory and involuntary actions with no effective border between loss of simple memory and loss of bodily function.  

**Addendum** Dr. ████, a level 3 researcher, was conservatively using SCP-896 to augment his mental abilities with the approval of command.  Dr. ████ was 53 years old and in good health.  Dr. ████ had been using the leveling method to increase his statistics to avoid potential death.  Dr. ████ decided to have a “game-a-thon” over Thanksgiving weekend in 20██, in which he played SCP-896 for an estimated █ hours straight before he expired.  Autopsies revealed evidence of severe arthritis, early onset Alzheimer’s, cataract, and development of several tumors.  The medical examiner could only conclude that Dr. ████ had died of old age.  Further use of SCP-896 by Foundation personnel has been suspended until the direct correlation between the aging effects brought on by leveling is understood.
