[[[class-omega | Class Omega]]] What happens when you're given the latest (and strongest) Foundation amnesiac.

[[collapsible show="+ show some notes on my SCPs" hide="- Hide notes"]]

[[[SCP-052]]]: I lived in NYC and used this station frequently -- and they are always screwing around with the train service at night.  I was standing there, waiting for a train, and thinking "What if there were a more sinister reason than 'track maintenance' for the A train not running?"

[[[SCP-157]]]: I wanted to make "water bears" into an SCP, since they are close to indestructible in real life.  I had just watched the 1988 version of //The Blob// and thought:  The Blob was big, fast, chased people around, and instantly dissolved them into glop.  What if a blob was little, slow, and needed hours to kill someone? How would it manage to do it?  Also, there was a flurry of "killer creatures that pose as ordinary items" (I think there was a soda can, and a bottle of bubble bath, for example)  and I thought "Why would there be all these different critters that each pose as one very specialized thing?"

[[[SCP-259]]]: This was based on an idea found in the background of some of Charles Stross's books; that implementing advanced mathematics can open gateways, summon unwanted things, etc.  I went with the concept (found in relatively few SCPs) that the Foundation doesn't really have this under control...it's being used by terrorists and we're hoping to track it down before the next incident.

[[[SCP-456]]]: Bedbugs are creepy (although not actually dangerous), and there is a bedbug epidemic in NYC.  We're constantly being reminded of this (with pictures) in the papers, on the news, in ads for mattress protectors.  So I came up with something realistic that they could do to make them into an SCP.

[[[SCP-506]]]: I had a dream about instant-growing plants taking over the world.  No joke.  I like the idea of making mundane things (like zucchini) scary.   I'm chuffed when someone makes the comment "How the hell did you make _______ scary?" So: Instant-growing attack zucchini!

[[[SCP-557]]]: This was a rewrite of an SCP from Leicontis who in turn had rewritten Gabriel Jade's original.  I thought it was a good idea, even though it was sitting at -3, and asked to rewrite it.  I was right that a slightly different take on the idea would turn it around.  I'm still waiting for someone to notice the Lovecraft reference in this one.

[[[SCP-699]]]: This was my first, and folks mostly liked it, in spite of it being "Stuff from da future!" I wanted to do something a little different than a regular object, and focus on no one being quite sure what the thing actually IS, and also the idea that other timelines might dump their scary stuff on us for one reason or another.  I used a different take on this item in some Game Day tales.  There, it's an infiltration device, and the thing inside can let itself out whenever it wants.  The documentation that came with it, and the observable effects are all red herrings so the Foundation keeps it around but can't mess around with it.

[[[SCP-795]]]: This was written for a challenge Bright made -- to randomly "roll up" two cliches from the Big List of Cliches and combine them.  So:  Reality-Bending Cat -- a horrible concept that EVERYONE would tell you not to write if you asked in chat.  Yes, *I* would tell you not to write this SCP.  Somewhat to my surprise, it lived, and is not even my lowest-rated SCP.

[[[SCP-911]]]: I had an idea for a cult ("The Collective") that believes that God is formed from the union of the minds of all the sentient beings in the universe, and worked up this SCP based on that idea.  

[[[SCP-944]]]:  Nothing special here; I just think mirror mazes are creepy, and thought "What if you could walk through the mirrors and things happened to you?"

[[[SCP-1961]]]:  There was an awful SCP about a Transformation Mirror; it got down to -76 I think.  I'd seen this idea done (badly) before that.  The thing is, I always thought it was a workable idea if handled decently (and written by someone who can actually write in English).  While thinking the item out, I went off on a tangent a bit, and ended up with this.  Once again, I thought I had worked in an somewhat obvious Lovecraft reference that no one has ever mentioned.
