**Item #:** SCP-2732

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2732 is to be kept at [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-701 Storage Site-██] in a standard large object containment chamber. SCP-2732-1 is to be stored separately in a security safe with controlled heat and humidity, due to its delicate nature. SCP-2732-2-D instances are to be kept in a cold storage chamber.

**Description:** SCP-2732 is a wooden Beijing Opera stage, constructed within the last century. SCP-2732 lacks a back stage area or stairs. SCP-2732-1 is a Ming Dynasty Era booklet containing seven entries, all different accounts of the same event. 

When a human subject reads out a whole entry directly from SCP-2732-1 while standing within a 60 meters radius of SCP-2732, SCP-2732-2 instances, along with stage props required, will manifest on the stage. SCP-2732-2 instances are autonomous, mostly wooden mannequins with no facial features wearing Beijing Opera costumes and facial makeup. SCP-2732-2 instances will engage in a performance[[footnote]]Note that the performance do not match the common practice of Beijing Opera, as costumes and facial makeup assigned are often unrelated to SCP-2732-2's roles.[[/footnote]] that seems to be corresponding to the entry read, accompanied by music with no apparent source. See Addendum for specifics and exceptions.

When a human being enters SCP-2732, the performance will halt, with SCP-2732-2 instances ceasing all motions. SCP-2732-2 instances and stage props removed at this time will behave like ordinary objects. The performance will resume after all objects taken from SCP-2732 are returned and all human subjects have left the stage. After the performace, SCP-2732-2 instances and stage props will disappear, except for the instance generated by Entry 7. See Addendum for more information.

**Addendum:** The following is the content of SCP-2732-1, and the specifics of SCP-2732-2's performance corresponding to each entry.

The king hence used the servant as a sacrifice. The Dragon said: "Good." The king then hanged himself with white silk. The whole country celebrated.

**Note:** Ink was spilled onto the page, rendering the rest of the paragraph illegible. However, reading the legible part is enough to trigger the effect.

**Performance Log:** SCP-2732-2-D only appears in this entry, and unlike other instances, doesn't disappear afterwards. The instance is a roughly humanoid figure, lacking limbs, and wrapped in black silk.

> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> SCP-2732-2-D appears in the middle of the stage.
> 
> The instance remains mostly still, but turns its head to always face the human subject who initiated the performance.
> 
> //[No background music is present.]//
> 
> **<End Log>**

**Note:** Examination shows that under the black silk, SCP-2732-2-D is composed of animal meat similar to that which would appear in Entry 6's performance. Embedded within the instance's face, a pair of human eyeballs can be found. Currently, all 5 pairs collected have identical DNA, indicating a male of Han ethnicity.
