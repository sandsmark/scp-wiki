> **O5-12:** Why are we even doing this again?
> **Dr. Rivera:** Dash 1 wants me to make you a psychological evaluation. So, how are you feeling today?
> **O5-12:** Tired. As always. Jesus Christ, who thought this was a good idea? This is probably a breach of goddamn overseer secrecy! 
> **Dr. Rivera:** Relax, they're going to amnestisize me afterwards. They always do. So, could you //please//  cooperate for once? Thank you. Now, next question: How do you feel about your sudden promotion to a member of the Overseer Council?
> **O5-12:** I hate it. Wait... what are you doing with your hands? Is that... Is that a fucking drawing?! Have you been drawing me this whole time?!
> **Dr. Rivera:** Wait... what are you doing?!
> **O5-12:** Give... me.... that!
> //Gunshots can be heard.//
> **<End Log>**
> **Closing Statement:** Doctor Jessie Rivera has not been seen since. The search for her is still ongoing[[footnote]] Spoiler: They are not going to find her. [[/footnote]].
