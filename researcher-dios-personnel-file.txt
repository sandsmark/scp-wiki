A few notes on my limited SCP contributions

[[collapsible show="+SCP-1048" hide="-SCP-1048"]]
[[size 90%]]My first article. One of those "new author inexplicably writes popular SCP on first try" sorta things. Kind of a bummer because I know I'll likely never do better than this, but I can't really complain. People have made pictures of SCP-1048, SCP-1048-A, and SCP-1048-B. People have done readings of the article on Youtube. It's supposedly going to be in an SCP game if that guy ever stops dicking around with all his stupid updates and actually makes the game (seriously, who gives a shit what the //hallway// looks like that SCP-1048 is going to appear in?). I have a lot to feel good about. I also don't have anything to say about the creation of this. I don't remember how I came up with it. I don't remember why "ears". Aborted baby because squicky. Jagged metal jumping through people because of [http://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/4/48/RotF_Reedman_Still.jpg Reedman] from the awful Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. There's not much else to say.[[/size]]

[[collapsible show="+SCP-1439" hide="-SCP-1439"]]
[[size 90%]]I feel so bad for this SCP. I love the concept, and I love that it has two possible "A-ha!" moments. It unfortunately had some bad expungement that I improved upon (not enough for everyone), but the damage was done. It had a stagnant rating of +36 for quite awhile, which isn't terrible, but I wish I was a good enough writer to be able to bring the reader to both of those "A-ha!" moments without shoving it down their throats.[[/size]] 

[[size 90%]]SPOILERS: 7 out of the 8 stickers share names with Thomas the Tank Engine characters, and those 7 stickers share the same colors as those characters. The exception is Albert, who is gray. All 8 stickers are the names of various serial killers: Albert Fish, Gordon Northcott, Ed(ward) Gein, Harvey Glatman, Henry Lee Lucas, Charles Ng, Thomas Dillon, and James Swann. The stickers are meant to be put on a human's face, causing their personality to be taken over by the serial killer's. They don't work particularly well though, as they cause the person's face to be come gray, bulbous, and swollen, while enlarging their eyes. This makes them look like a Thomas the Tank Engine character.[[/size]]

[[collapsible show="+SCP-1562" hide="-SCP-1562"]]
[[size 90%]]This SCP was inspired by one of my greatest fears. I actually wrote an entire story for r/nosleep on Reddit based around it, but it went mostly unnoticed. You can read it [http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zsao1/sandpaper/ here], if you're interested. The thing that really caught me by surprise was just how many people thought this SCP was temporal in nature, when in my head that was never the case. I never said anything in the discussion because I worried that everyone else's interpretation was better than my own. In my head, the SCP transports you to a nearly endless tunnel filled with a chain of dead bodies; all of them lying on their stomachs, face down, at about a 35 degree angle. The very first person who entered the tunnel died from panic/stroke/heart attack/shock/whatever. When the next person slid down, the "audio" of the first person's death was played for them. It acts as a sort of countdown, where shortly after the "audio" ends, the next person dies from the same thing that killed the first person. Subsequent persons each hear the final words/screams/cries of the previous person before dying. Seems pretty lame when stripped down, which is why I never bothered to explain in the discussion.[[/size]]

[[size 90%]]I also want to add that I did think up some backstory to this, though I'm not sure I want to add anything to the article about it. The idea was that some wacky company (not Dr. Wondertainment, but something like that I guess), made the slide anomalous on purpose. It was supposed to be a portal that would basically send you into a super long tunnel slide, but eventually you'd reappear at the bottom of the SCP to end the ride. The idea being that slides are fun for kids, but they're just such a short ride, so why not make it longer? During the tunnel part of the slide you would hear the replay of the previous child's laughter and excitement. Of course, the tunnel part of it was never finished, and the company went under. Somehow the slide found itself donated to some random playground, which was later abandoned. I may work this into to the SCP article eventually, but not sure how to go about it.[[/size]]

[[collapsible show="+SCP-2041" hide="-SCP-2041"]]
[[size 90%]]I decided to continue with the playground equipment theme, with this having a connection to SCP-1562 in my head. I'm still figuring it all out, but I imagine this will remain mostly my own personal backstory for these items, as I have no interest in trying to force a new GOI or anything of that nature. I've spelled out what this does in the discussion page for this SCP, so I'm not sure if I need to expand on anything too much. This item had good intentions from the creator, but it was made from the perspective of an overprotective adult, so it misses its mark a bit. The kids end up being overly traumatized, though the creator might argue that it's better than the alternative...[[/size]]

[[collapsible show="+SCP-2224" hide="-SCP-2224"]]
[[size 90%]]Endeavoring to continue the decline of my average article rating, I introduced the third entry in my playground equipment series. Further allusions to the overall story arc I have in my head for this series have been introduced, and I've explained the purpose of this SCP in the discussion pages for it. I plan on doing one more playground scip, then if ambition strikes me I want to write a series of tales that tie them together, in the context of a much bigger, more expansive story. [[/size]]

[[collapsible show="+SCP-2483" hide="-SCP-2483"]]
[[size 90%]]The final skip in my playground series. I used my own recent, personal struggle with anxiety, depression, and medication (much less dramatic than it sounds) as a way to give some real world feelings to this one. This SCP is what remains of the creator of the other 3 playground pieces. He lost everything dear to him, including his own self. I plan on exploring his story with the tale series previously mentioned.[[/size]]
