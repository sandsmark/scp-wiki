**Item #:** SCP-2755

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2755 is to be stored in a standard biological item vault outfitted with a drain for excess fluids.

**Description:** SCP-2755 is the corpse of Finnegan █████, a comedy writer noted for a family-friendly series of joke books, [REDACTED]. The corpse itself is effectively affixed to the couch supporting it. Of particular note is its position; its right hand holds a shot glass under SCP-2755's mouth. Discharging from the mouth at 0.5 mL/hour is isopropyl alcohol, which drips into the shot glass. When overfilled, and the alcohol reaches a suitable material, most additional alcohol evaporates. The remaining alcohol proceeds to cover the material's surface and etches a random pun from one of the writer's books, as well as a typically cynical addition. See Addendum for transcripts.
