**Item #:** SCP-301

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-301 is to kept in a secure, electromagnetically sealed bunker buried under at least ten meters of earth to conceal its location. The bunker is to be staffed by no less than four level three security personnel at all times in order to secure the site and to maintain automated security measures. The perimeter of the bunker is be lined with a chain link fence with official warnings to deter intruders. Due to the remote location SCP-301 was found in, additional security is not required.

In the event of a containment breach, on-site personnel with the proper security clearance are authorized to implement Containment Protocol 301. All possible entrances to the bunker will automatically seal themselves and remain sealed indefinitely. Containment Protocol 301 can only be countermanded by an O5 level command.

**Description:** SCP-301 is an energy anomaly roughly three meters in diameter located in the middle of ██████████ National Park. Whenever physical matter enters SCP-301, it temporarily disappears from existence. The duration of this stage is subjective, and can last from anywhere between several minutes to several days. However, once after a certain passage of time, the matter that had entered SCP-301 will appear in another location on the planet. The exact destination appears to be completely random, but all of the known destination points lie exactly on the ██ degree North Latitude line, with a deviation between ██ and ██ degrees.  It should be noted that SCP-301 lies on the exact same latitude line.

Though the exact nature of this phenomenon is unknown, the prevailing hypothesis is that SCP-301 is some kind of space-time rift. Subjects that enter it experience a sort of suspended animation. The apparent teleportation is merely a side effect of this suspended state, since while suspended, the Earth's rotation about its axis literally moves the ground from under the organism. SCP-301 itself does not seem to be affected by the Earth's rotation, however, and remains firmly rooted in its intial position. For further details, please refer to Experiment Log 301A. SCP-301 is cannot be seen in the visible light spectrum, but is detectable through other spectrums. SCP-301 also passively emits electromagnetic energy. While not harmful to living organisms, it does interfere with improperly shielded electronics, and may explain why the native fuana does not venture near SCP-301.

SCP-301 was discovered when there was a spike in mysterious disappearances of hikers and tourists in ██████████ National Park, only for a number of them to be rediscovered in completely different areas. While some were merely found on the other side of the park, near a local town, or in some cases the neighboring state, the Foundation did not act until it recieved reports of one of the missing hikers being found in ████, France. While searching for unusal activity, Agents █████ and ████ accidentally entered SCP-301. They disappeared for approximately ██ minutes until the signal from their locator beacons was reacquired ████ miles from their last recorded position. SCP-301 was found to be located on a regularly used hiking trail. The Foundation rerouted the hiking trail and built the current facility containing SCP-301.

**Experiment Log 301A**

//Through our experiments, we have determined that the time period the subject disappears directly corresponds with their final destination point. By correlating the time the the subject disappears with the distance it travels, it is almost a perfect match with the velocity of the Earth's rotational motion about its axis. Based from witness testimony, as well as data provided D-Class personnel, time spent inside SCP-301 is relative. While time outside SCP-301 passes normally, the subject inside percieves no passage of time at all. Mechanical and digital timers sent into SCP-301 can still function, but show the noticeable time discrepancy between initial entrance and reappearance.// -Dr. ████

**Experiment Log 301B**

//We've found that bombarding SCP-301 with pulses of electromagnetic energy has a noticeable effect on how it functions. Perhaps with this method we can actually be able to operate SCP-301 with precision. We have begun "mapping" these energy pulses in hopes that we may be able to glean practical applications.// -Dr. ████

[DATA EXPUNGED]

**Administrative Note**

//As of ██/██/20██, the use of D-class personnel has been suspended following Incident 301-1 where [DATA EXPUNGED]. However, live animal testing is still permitted.// -O5-██

**Note**

//Just as a reminder, what happened in Incident 301-1 was a complete and unfortunate accident. The chances of a catastrophic teleportation mishap like that are less than being struck by lightning. Please do not let that discourage you from continuing your work on SCP-301.// -Dr. ████
