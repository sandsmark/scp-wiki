> 'Twas the night before Christmas, When all through the Site,
> Not a single man stirred, Not during that night.
> The chambers were locked and sealed with great care,
> In hopes that their contents would stay just right there.
> 
> The crews sat at home and sung with great joy,
> Content with their work, though a little annoyed.
> And director at desk, and I with the T,
> Had just settled our brains into a dreamworld's sea.
> 
> When throughout the whole site there arose a great clatter,
> And in my sleepy daze, I ran to see what was the matter.
> Away to the muster point I flew in a dash,
> Away from the sirens, I ran like the Flash.
> 
> The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
> Did nothing to illuminate the terror below.
> As I ran and I ran from impending disaster,
> I could do nought but think of moving much faster.
> 
> But try as I might, I only made it so far,
> Before falling concrete gave me a lethal scar.
> Dying beneath stone, St Nick beyond my sight,
> I wondered what had unleashed this terrible blight.
> 
> Little did I know, there were those who went home,
> When they were needed to stay here, in this zone.
> Without them to stop the escaping disaster,
> It easily broke free, its own sole master.
> 
> As my soul left me, bleeding and hollow,
> I knew only fragments of what was to follow.
> Unkillables, warlords, concepts most vague,
> Upon the earth would wander these plagues.
> 
> Destruction, terror, anarchy and pain,
> Suffering, loneliness, no hope to gain.
> One by one, all across the globe,
> Many unspeakable horrors took hold.
> 
> 'Twas the night before Christmas, When all 'cross the world,
> Every single man stirred, watching an end unfurl.
> There were no Christmas miracles to save them that night;
> The only miracle? It never reached my sight.
