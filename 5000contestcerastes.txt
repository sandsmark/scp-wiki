**Object Class:** Euclid

[[include :scp-sandbox-3:image-zoom name=mary|caption=SCP-5000 upon initial discovery.|width=300px|align=right]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** Provisional Outpost-5000 has been constructed around SCP-5000, and should be staffed only by those with strong atheistic beliefs who have not previously expressed religious faith. Any changes observed in 5000's condition should be reported to the Department of Tactical Theology immediately.

**Description:** SCP-5000 is a desiccated corpse frozen in a kneeling position 26 kilometres south of the North Pole. The corpse, which was covered by a thick blanket upon discovery, resembles a human, but with several physical abnormalities displayed (six fingers on each hand, three eyes, bone protrusions emerging from its back). SCP-5000 has not decayed since discovery.
[[size 0%]]This world of ancient horrors and distortions in reality is broken. And there's only so much you can attempt to warp it before it collapses into a unrecognizable mess.[[/size]]
Disturbance of the corpse results in the formation of Type-I Empyrean entities[[footnote]]Also known as Ophanim[[/footnote]]. While instances appear to last only minutes before dissipating, they are hostile to any personnel within sight. Instances will attempt to move SCP-5000 away, but are unable to do so before their cessation.
[[size 0%]]I gave you rules to protect yourselves. Commandments to follow to keep your minds and souls pure. I wanted nothing but to protect you.[[/size]]
The area around SCP-5000 has an akiva radiation level of 626 akivas, the highest radiation levels found anywhere on Earth. Religious personnel attempting to approach the area are subject to nausea, vomiting, and intense feelings of guilt, sorrow, or anger.
[[size 0%]]But you chafed against those restrictions. To you, freedom was better than servitude, even if freedom would lead to your possible destruction. What was that quote? Better to rule in hell than to serve in heaven. I never was a fan of Milton.[[/size]]
Those who are currently non-religious, but have been so in the past will typically experience a religious reawakening, professing their return to their faith. Religious personnel transported forcefully to SCP-5000's near proximity will experience seizures and remain incoherent until removed.
[[size 0%]]I could not see what your flawed eyes , those beautiful eyes, those eyes I gave up, could at the time. I ignored them and declared my punishments for those who would defy me. I had sought to save you from yourselves by any means necessary.[[/size]]
SCP-5000-1 is a gravemarker comprised of piled stones stacked on top of one another directly in front of the corpse. The gravestone is devoid of any names and dates, bearing instead the following line in English.

[[size 0%]]I see what you see now. I lost sight in my ascension. Perhaps the world would be better off with no masters or gods ruling over it, no matter their intentions. Humanity shall decide its own fate. Even if that leads to its destructionâ€¦.[[/size]]
**Discovery:** SCP-5000 was discovered by the Foundation in 1961, after calculations by the Department of Tactical Theology had revealed the decreasing effectiveness of various religion-aligned containment procedures. Researchers theorized that an Iscariot Event[[footnote]]The death or cessation of a religiously significant figure[[/footnote]] had occurred, and began monitoring global levels of akiva radiation.

In 1963, consistently high levels of ambient radiation around the North Pole drew suspicion, and concentrated searches of the area were undertaken, leading to the discovery of SCP-5000.

The following events have tentatively been proposed to have been affected by the 5000-Iscariot event.

* The Quiet Revolution in Quebec, Canada
* The Communist Party of China's promotion of atheism (as a result of the Cultural Revolution)
* A renewed interest in German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche's works, as well as the 'Death of God' philosophical movement in the 1960's
* Launch of //Vostok 1.//

**Addendum:** In 1989, the corpse of a Caucasian male in his early forties was found buried in a snowbank approximately fifty metres from SCP-5000. Identification in his pocket confirmed him as a member of GOI-182 ("//la Spada di Cristo//"), a Vatican-run member organization of the Global Occult Coalition.

The remnants of a crashed Piasecki H-21 Shawnee helicopter was found similarly buried a short distance away from SCP-5000. Analysis of the crash site concluded that the pilot had likely lost control of the aircraft after the fuel tank had exploded, though the cause of the explosion could not be determined.

A number of items were recovered, in various states of damage.

* An envelope with a letter enclosed, stamped by a seal. Illegible due to water damage.
* A gold cross on a chain. Warped by the heat of the crash.
* A personal calendar for the year of 1959. Ink damage is present extensively on most dates for the month of January, stopping at the 25th.[[footnote]]The second Vatican Council was announced by Pope John XXIII on this date, which ultimately resulted in wide-spanning church reforms.[[/footnote]]
* Remnants of a map, with ink damage present.

[[size 0%]]Did it know? Did anyone?[[/size]]
Both Under-Secretary al Fine and Pope John Paul II have refused to comment on any and all details surrounding SCP-5000.
