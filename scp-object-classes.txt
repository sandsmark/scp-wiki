title:SCP Object Classes
**Safe:** Any SCP object classed as Safe is usually little more than a curiosity to the research teams, but is still anomalous enough to warrant containment in some form or another. Any SCP object classified as Safe can be interacted with by any member of staff, regardless of security clearance. This is also the only class of SCP object that anyone of O5-x clearance is permitted access to, though even then only under controlled circumstances. Safe objects are objects which, if you follow containment procedures, will not harm you. Guns and nuclear weapons are safe.

**Euclid:** Euclid class objects behave in unpredictable ways, Euclid objects produce unexpected results from the same action and occasionally produce results from actions that had previously evoked no response. Because of this any containment procedures may or may not be inadequate to protect experimenters. Sometimes Euclid class objects are upgraded to safe when they are understood better.

**Keter:** The strictest object class, Keter-class objects can only be handled by Class D personnel (see [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/security-clearance-levels Security Clearance Levels]). Keter objects are naturally inimical to life and pose great difficulties in keeping them controlled, hence the use of Class D personnel in their maintenance. Keter objects fall into one of two categories: those that are of immense strategic value once controlled, or those that have been deemed impossible to destroy due to the nature of the artifact. In either case, the artifact is to be kept until its use has been ascertained and replicated in a more controlled environment, or until a method of ensuring the objects' permanent destruction is determined. 

**Neutralized:** Any object that has since been destroyed, or in some way has no odd, extra-dimensional, or adverse effects. Objects classified under this class should have a note stating what class it was while it was an active SCP.
