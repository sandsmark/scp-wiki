**Item#:** SCP-001

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-001 has two components.

SCP-001-A is to be kept locked along with all data pertaining to it inside the Primary Archival Vault on sublevel 1 of Site 10. The Vault is a custom-manufactured reinforced concrete and steel vertical octagonal prism (see Appendix U for full schematics) with a 2000kg 0.9m-thick timelocked access portal in the ceiling. The timelocking schedule should be classified and available only to the two highest-ranking Level 5 Foundation members. Access is conditional on three-factor authorisation (e.g. keycard+fingerprint+passphrase). SCP-001-A is among the safest artifacts in the Foundation's possession and these measures are primarily intended to prevent theft.

SCP-001-B is far beyond the capacity of the Foundation to contain. Public knowledge of SCP-001-B's existence, however, is not. Such knowledge should be considered dangerous and viral and is to be suppressed with the maximum possible severity. Foundation agents in the international astrophysics community are to monitor, suppress and misdirect scientific activity likely to uncover the existence of SCP-001-B. (Full list of identities and roles: see Appendix F.)

**Description:** SCP-001-A is smooth black ellipsoidal (~15.1cm x 15.4cm x 16.5cm) onyx gemstone with a thin white band. Wrapped around its exterior, encompassing its equator and both poles, is a complex and layered fractal filigree of gold metal. The gold is sculpted into quite broad strokes at what is now usually agreed to be the lower or "south" pole of the object, but with increasing "latitude" the pattern becomes progressively more intricate. Near the "north" pole, also called the "lock" or "singularity" (see acquisition report, below), the pattern complexity progresses beyond the capability of optical or electron-beam microscopes to resolve. Further investigation is pending advances in microscopy technology.

A piece of engraved text begins at or near the "lock" and runs on a polar orbit around the artifact's base and back to the pole again. The text is too small to read near the lock, becomes larger as it continues, is legible for the duration of a few dozen characters, then wraps back around to the pole and becomes too small to read again. Because of the compressed size, the text could theoretically extend forever both forwards and backwards.

The legible characters have been identified as Tertiary Sumerian Cuneiform and dated //circa// 3400 BCE. Naturally, only the visible part of this text can be translated and even then only partially:

> with loss and ????? we/I ?????? [a noun] //Apakht// [probably a proper noun] on this ending/finality ?????????? joy + permanence [possibly 'protection']

SCP-001-A is totally inert, opaque to all forms of electromagnetic and hard radiation, and, so far, indestructible (see log for Project Pluto, below). Its onyx/gold composition is guessed from visual inspection, since the taking of samples for chemical analysis has proven impossible. The mass of SCP-001-A is approximately 0.199kg less than would be expected for a solid object of its volume and composition, suggesting that it is partially hollow.

SCP-001-B is a faint fractal pattern which was uncovered by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe between 2001 and 2006. The pattern is encoded in the form of minute variations in the cosmic microwave background, which is the thermal "afterglow" or "echo" from the Big Bang which began our universe. To the degree of accuracy that the probe can resolve, this pattern is exactly identical to that enclosing SCP-001-A.

**Project Pluto Master Log**

The following experiments have failed to open SCP-001-A:

* conventional lockpicking
* brute force assault with hammer, chisel, sledgehammer, bolt-cutters, welding torch, bandsaw, etc.
* sustained heating to 5000 degrees Centigrade in industrial furnace (artifact reflected all thermal energy, did not increase in temperature)
* direct application of industrial cutting laser (~160kW/cm^2 concentrated on the "lock") (artifact reflected all energy)
* compression in vice, car crusher, hydraulic diamond-face press (all destroyed)
* application of corrosive acids and other highly oxidising compounds (no reaction)
* detonation of plastic and solid explosives up to 0.5kt/TNT-equivalent at point blank range (no effect)
* detonation of a 15kt/TNT-equivalent atomic warhead at point blank range [authorization granted retroactively by Dr. Mirski] (no effect)

> Project Pluto has been reinstated and is ongoing with the full support of Foundation resources. - Dr Mirski

**SCP-001-A Acquisition Report**

SCP-001-A was discovered on public display at the Scottish National Museum, Edinburgh by a vacationing Foundation staff member in 1980. It was purchased by a Foundation front organisation and transferred to Site 10 where Drs Q. G. Hack and Y. Mirski performed initial routine analysis. Research continues under the auspices of Dr Mirski, Dr Hack having recently left the Foundation.

The earliest record of SCP-001-A is in the handwritten journal of the minor Scottish aristocrat Sir Edwin Young, 3rd Baronet (1611-1677). As was customary at the time, Young kept a "Cabinet of Curiosities", a small room of artifacts of undetermined providence such as sculptures, preserved creatures and trinkets. Young's journal includes references to his acquisition in 1654 of "a locked jewel box of onyx and filigree gold, of fineness beyond rational statement" while travelling in the darkest African jungle. The journal also includes several detailed sketches of SCP-001-A. In one of the sketches a large metal object resembling a key is fitted into the north pole of SCP-001-A.

SCP-001-A was stolen from Young's residence the year after he died. The key has not yet been recovered.
