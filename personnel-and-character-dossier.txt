[[size 130%]]The Foundation is made up of numerous personnel, each one bringing individual skills and abilities to the fore. Outside of the Foundation, there are thousands of people living in and around anomalous communities. Anartists, magic users and extradimensional beings are but a few instances of what the Foundation has encountered.

[[tab Foundation Doctors and Researchers]]



**Dr. Jack Bright:** [[[an-evening-with-bright| Director of Foundation Personnel]]]. [[[the-best-and-the-wisest| Somewhat amoral]]]. [[[Unfinished Business|Extremely loyal to the Foundation]]]. May or may not be [[[the-things-dr-bright-is-not-allowed-to-do-at-the-foundation| friendly and/or terrifying]]]; is certainly [[[we-re-off-to-be-the-lizard| blunt]]]. Attached to [[[SCP-963]]], and is therefore immortal, using the body of whatever 963 has last touched. 

[[collapsible show="I've been with the company for a long time." hide="I am not the damned monkey."]]
His relatives and siblings have been associated with the Foundation since time immemorial. His younger brother is [[[SCP-590]]] (which a few know); [[[SCP-321]]] is a sister (which almost no one knows). At least two other relatives work for the Foundation at a high level. Several of Bright's discarded bodies -- still possessing his personality and knowledge at time of separation from 963 -- have been put to work on secret Foundation projects. Bright possesses a desire to permanently die that he may not be conscious of; ironic, for he only became part of 963 because he was //not// trying to die.

**Dr. Alto Clef:** A highly [[[timeandrelativedimensionsincontainmentprotocols| adaptable]]], clever [[[father-of-lies| liar]]]. Former GOC operative, [[[termination-order| specializing in reality benders]]]. Also [[[contingency| former file clerk]]]. Undergone anomalous alterations that provide resistance to reality shifts and prevent his face from being photographed. Has a long and checkered history, and a somewhat hidden streak of self-hatred. Reformed misogynist. Most rumors about him are exaggerated or off-point. [[[poopstick-mcgee-and-the-flying-walruses| Don't call him genre-savvy or enigmatic.]]]

[[collapsible show="They'll say anything about me." hide="Except the truth."]]
GOC codename Agent Ukelele prior to defection. May or may not have had a child with a nature goddess as a teenage boy; the goddess was killed by the GOC, but the daughter became a (current) SCP object -- if this even happened at all. Involved in a number of CK-class reality restructuring events (and may be able to remember them). (Is) (Is not) a manifestation of the being popularly known as the Devil, despite claims to the contrary.

**Dr. Kain "Pathos" Crow:** [[[olympia| Cross-disciplinary]]] //wunderkind// researcher, specializing particularly in [[[dr-cog-and-the-plastic-fantastic| biochemistry]]] and [[[new-tricks| robotics]]]. Rarely, if ever, seen in public. May or may not have been permanently transformed into a dog-like body as the result of a particular anomalous event.

[[collapsible show="I'm so tired these days." hide=" I don't even want to work on the walker..."]]

Ran a number of highly classified cross-testing experiments with the aim of creating useful objects of anomalous origin, notably Project Olympia. Nearly terminated several times. Difficulties in the canine body and an unclear lifespan have resulted in a considerable drop in productivity. Many of his side projects have become dormant.

[[include component:image-block name=http://img07.deviantart.net/da66/i/2014/282/b/2/kain_pathos_crow_by_sunnyparallax-d825swb.jpg|caption=Professor Crow]]

**Dr. Chelsea "Photosynthetic" Elliott:** Plant specialist, both anomalous and non-anomalous. Dedicated, friendly, prone to tunnel vision. Often in the field; excessively 'hands-on' in her lab and field research, leading to a number of injuries. Scars cover her hands and arms.

[[collapsible show="We're at the cusp of something here." hide="..."]]
Possible anomalous capability due to exposure to an anomalous item (a "sun of unknown provenance"). This is unknown to her, and investigation is ongoing. Possible security risk due to strong personal desire to advance worldwide scientific knowledge in her chosen field; she's possibly a little //too// excited about the marvels she has studied.

[[include component:image-block name=http://img09.deviantart.net/a8e7/i/2015/077/4/2/dr__photosynthetic_by_sunnyparallax-d8m6iid.jpg|caption=Dr. Photosynthetic]]


[[/collapsible]]

**Dr. Jeremiah Cimmerian:** [[[lending-a-hand| An ethics committee liaison that takes his job only somewhat seriously]]]. He never thought his doctorate in English Literature or his minor in philosophy would actually help him stay employed, but the former got him recruited into the Foundation as a researcher and the latter secured his employment in the long term. Has an unusual interest in puns and the ethical treatment of humanoids.

**Dr. Everett King:** One of the Foundation's most experienced mathematicians, Doctor King's reputation has nevertheless been overtaken by his [[[scp-216| testing record]]] involving unusual results. Despite this, he regularly contributes to internal Foundation intellectual periodicals.

[[collapsible show="I don't want any more goddamn apples." hide="And I've never gotten any..."]]

Dr. King's testing must be heavily supervised, due to the presence of apple seeds that seem to be increasing exponentially in intensity. [[[long-live-the-king| Intensive observation indicates Dr. King is irritated by his seemingly inherit effect]]].

[[/collapsible]]

**Researcher Jacob Conwell:** Anomalous Materials Analyst. Masters Degree in Analytical Chemistry. Current head of the Site-64 AMat Lab. Frequently called upon, Conwell has made a name for himself in the Foundation as a hard worker.

[[collapsible show="I'm doing so much these days." hide="..."]]

Initially over eager to please Foundation superiors, promotion to primary investigator positions has resulted in multiple depressive episodes and insomnia, though these have improved following Conwell's transfer to Site-64 and marriage. Routine psychological evaluations are ongoing.

[[/collapsible]]


**Dr. Thaddeus Xyank:** [[[audio-transcript-2400-2700-anborough-xyank| Presently low-level but extremely significant Foundation researcher]]]. [[[iteration-0| Specializes in temporal anomalies]]]. Somewhat arrogant and long-winded, but considered an up-and-coming genius.

[[collapsible show="Where is he? Where isn't he?" hide="..."]]

Extensive involvement in major Thaumiel projects, notably [[[SCP-2000]]].

[[/collapsible]]

**Dr. Charles Gears ("COG"):** [[[epitaph| A man strangely lacking in emotional response]]] (to the point of lacking a startle response) and possessing unusual levels of [[[lullaby| logic and intellect]]]. Former Euclid-class object specialist before having his area of study expanded. Has been deeply involved with research regarding a truly shocking number of SCP objects both major and minor. [[[in-his-own-image| A figure of great influence]]] in recent Foundation history. 

[[collapsible show="It is not acceptable to inquire that." hide="I do what is required."]]
Records claim he was recruited shortly after the founding of the Foundation... despite his age and personal history not quite matching up to that timeline. A personal fact that few know: He //does// feel emotion, when it's significant. He simply does not react to it or show it. Because he cannot. Why? If there is a reason, few know. Possibly the father of [[[pawn-to-e4|Alison Chao]]], the woman calling herself the "Black Queen".

[[/collapsible]]

**Dr. Simon Glass:** Head of Psychology. [[[Routine Psychological Evaluations By Dr Glass| Trusted with performing psychological evaluations of highly ranked Foundation personnel]]]. Very empathetic. Sometimes considered "soft" -- and that's true, for a Foundation researcher, but he's still well-trusted. In the course of [[[oneirocritic| his interviews]]], he has gained knowledge of more and more terrible secrets, yet still holds on to both his sanity and empathy.

[[collapsible show="I talk to everyone, I know everyone..." hide="... Of course I'm loyal."]]
Associates linked to a number of groups of interest, including the Chaos Insurgency (via a relative) and the Serpent's Hand. Feels self-conscious about how higher-ups view him because of this.

[[/collapsible]]


**Dr. Sophia Light:** Biologist, surgeon and Site Director with [[[maria-jones-this-is-your-life| far, far too many secrets]]]. A likeable yet frightening person. Blunt, determined, calculating; good under pressure. Putting effort into remaining friendly and open (and emotionally stable). Bears minor facial scarring, and an old injury in her left hand sometimes impairs its functionality. Somewhat traumatic childhood; caretakers forced her to learn outdoor survival by leaving her stranded in the African wilderness for days on end. Joined the Foundation after a classified anomalous incident that killed eleven people, including her then-fiancee. Currently or formerly romantically linked with Troy Lament.

[[collapsible show="It's not my fault they want another meeting." hide="..."]]
The rumors that persist of Dr. Light's strangely close involvement with O5 Command are accurate. Seems to have been involved in a number of highly classified reality shifts -- including some initiated by the Foundation itself. A centrally important figure to the Foundation for a number of extremely secret reasons, some of which she doesn't know (or does not still remember) herself.

**Technical Researcher David Rosen:** [[[new-technical-issues| Technical Advisor]]] and Researcher. [[[Technical-Orientation| Responsible for ensuring the continued functionality of Site-19's technical infrastructure]]]. Known for being acerbic and marginally accident-prone, he also manages the facilities technical department very well and is widely see as a thrifty leader.

[[collapsible show="You want me to what?" hide="Uhh..."]]

[[[the-swift-rise-and-fall-of-technical-researcher-david-rosen| Rosen actually knows very little about some of the more modern systems he's maintaining]]], but has been able to bluff his way past that by delegating individuals more qualified than he to work on them.

[[/collapsible]]

**Dr. Everett Mann:** [[[the-hatbot-chronicles| Unconventional medical researcher]]] with few scruples and a specialty in unusual forms of surgery. Jokingly referred to as a "mad scientist". [[[ecceperago| Sometimes not-so-jokingly]]]. (He objects to the term "mad scientist", claiming that "mad doctor" would be more accurate, and further that the difference should be plain to anyone with a proper academic background to speak of.) [[[the-gate-opens| Easily willing to do monstrous things in the name of research]]]. Possesses a dramatic mustache. Due to his upbringing, [[[Be a Dali and Help a Mann Out, or The Lamentable State of Modern Art| his cultural and popular knowledges are woefully out of date]]], leading to anachronistic and ridiculous situations. 

[[collapsible show="Yes, I wanted to show you what I've been working on." hide="It's dreadfully fascinating."]]
Came to Foundation attention via the uncle who raised him, a person of interest to the Foundation due to anomalous research. Considered a potential danger to the Foundation under certain predicted future circumstances.

[[/collapsible]]


**Dr. Tilda D. Moose:** Current Site Director of Site-19 and Co-Director of Site-17, having inherited the positions from a string of previous Directors (and Acting Directors). Stern, anxious, mildly obsessive. Can become suddenly fiery once something gets her going. Known for nervous habits. Relative newcomer compared to others in administration; has outsized degree of influence given her length of tenure with the organization. (The "D" is for "David", despite her gender.)

[[collapsible show="You don't need to worry about me. I'm not biting off more than I can chew this time." hide="..."]]
Among other things, a K-Class scenario researcher. Closely associated with Agent Troy Lament on a number of classified projects, much to Lament's chagrin. Nearly terminated by O5 order on multiple separate occasions. Considered possible future risk factor due to association with the Serpent's Hand, past history, and the stresses of her positions.
[[/collapsible]]

**Dr. Johannes Sorts:** Memetic specialist and field researcher, with a doctorate in art history.  Caucasian, late 30s, unshaven with greying brown hair.  Slightly overweight, usually wears a grey cap. [[[that-goddamn-thing| Obsessive, cowardly and paranoid in mundane situations, but solid and focused when presented with memetic or information based hazards]]].  Multiple disciplinary reports due to poor choice of action under pressure, including the shooting of a guard while under my influence.  Currently under psychiatric evaluation and restricted to safer projects.

[[collapsible show="The fucking Foundation and that fucking toaster." hide="..."]]
Influenced far, far more of the Foundation's fundamental doctrines than anyone is willing to admit.  Under constant supervision due to several attempts to breach internal security on objects outside of his jurisdiction.
[[/collapsible]]

**Dr. Django Bridge:** [[[conclusions-red-173-2263-incident| Foundation Archivist]]]. Quiet but influential, with a touch of both melancholy and whimsy. Extraordinary memory. [[[a-site-19-christmas-carol| Known to be on a first-name basis with Dr. Bright, and has frequently acted as an informal assistant for him.]]]

**Dr. Frederick Heiden:** Neurology specialist. Anxious, uncertain, empathic, focused on logic. Involved in a number of highly classified projects, despite initially being barred from any non-Safe-classed objects.
[[collapsible show="Shhhhhh." hide="..."]]
May be secretly under Dr. Bright's wing. There are... "plans" for Heiden. Or... were. Perhaps. Heiden may or may not have been killed and brought back to life; he may or may not in fact be dead, though he is listed as active staff and appears to be playing some kind of role within the Foundation regardless.##white|^^1^^##
##white|^^1^^he's just heiden'##
[[/collapsible]]

**Dr. Zyn Kiryu:** Highly prolific researcher. Involved in a number of classified Foundation projects. Obsessive, driven, often not eating or sleeping in favor of finishing tasks. Joined the Foundation before finishing her schooling; finished through an accelerated Foundation program. Initially closed-off and withdrawn, but opened up due to a latent ambitious streak. She often volunteers to handle new Foundation member intake, hoping to give new members a positive introduction to an often deeply horrifying organization. Has a private flair for poetry. Has accidentally inherited the absent Dr. Kondraki's affiliation with anomalous butterflies, including [[[SCP-408]]] after Kondraki's disappearance.

[[collapsible show="I didn't ask for this." hide="You know that's from a game, right?"]]
Has a brother, Mark Kiryu, a higher-ranked researcher. O5 Command has its eye fixed on Zyn Kiryu for unknown reasons, having dismissed her higher-ranked brother as ultimately irrelevant. She is being watched and investigated by the Red Right Hand -- whether positively or negatively is unknown.

[[tab Foundation Agents]]

**Agent Troy Lament:** Containment and recovery specialist. [[[in-his-own-image| Protege of Dr. Gears after Iceberg's suicide]]]. Deeply scarred due to his experiences at the Foundation. Currently or formerly romantically linked with Sophia Light.

[[collapsible show="Yeah, what's up?" hide="..."]]
One of the best-kept secrets in the Foundation is Lament's high status within the organization. Haunted by his experience, plagued by doubt, and possessing scant desire for power, Lament is happy to keep his secret a secret. He plays his role unwillingly and with great reluctance. Occasionally his status has been used to get him closer to targets who do not realize he is anything more than Gears' assistant.
[[/collapsible]]

**Agent Sasha Merlo:** [[[the-elusive-anderson| Cyber Operations Specialist]]]. Current commander of MTF Gamma-13 (Asimov's Lawbringers). Cheerful, if rather dry and sarcastic. Several disciplinary reports for reckless actions during MTF field operations. [[[finding-anderson| Current support from Site-64's Director Holman suggest potential for eventual promotion to administrative duties in the future.]]]

**Agent Navarro:** [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/fragment:three-farewells-navarro| Originally captured as a Person of Interest in Portland, Oregon in mid-2004]]], and acted as a double agent for the Foundation until he was officially employed in late-2005. Called in as a specialist in cases of anomalous art, also acts as liaison between the Foundation and various anartists. Friendly and easy-going to the point of bordering fault. Easily recognized by his perma-stubble. 

[[collapsible show="I'm being serious guys." hide="No I don't have a damn scar."]]

Is a self-described "wizard" and is capable of using anomalous phenomena ("magic"), though is not himself anomalous. Has received multiple infractions for the unapproved use of anomalous items and phenomena.
[[/collapsible]]

**Agent Dmitri Arkadeyevich "Waxx" Strelnikov:** [[[oldmenyoungmen| Former Site Security Director, most famously former acting Site Director of Site-19]]]. Former leader of now-disbanded [[[reddawn| MTF Red Dawn]]]. Russian in origin, operated extensively in Eastern Europe. [[[elder-baconator| Strange sense of humor]]]; subject of numerous infamous practical jokes. Now happily retired with a large pension.
[[collapsible show="The only thing worse than killing an innocent girl" hide="is getting a medal for doing so."]]

[[tab Foundation Administrators]]


**Director Maria Jones:** Director of Records and Information Security Administration ([[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2998-1| RAISA]]]). Powerful and isolated, Director Jones ultimately controls much of the ebb and flow of information across the Foundation, both inside and between facilities. She has few friends, but is loyal to those few she has. Everyone knows her name as a matter of course, but few people know //her//.


**Director Shirley Gillespie** and **Dr. Ralph Roget:** [[[boss-of-me| Director Shirley Gillespie is a part of the oldest guard in the Foundation]]] -- holding a directorship in [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-77| Site-77]]], a storage facility now disguised as an Amazon.com shipping center, for over fifty years. [[[I Was Not Magnificent| Although constantly rumored to be retiring]]], she still exerts influence, sometimes through her grandson, Dr. Ralph Roget. 

[[collapsible show="Don't worry, you're going to blow them all away." hide="..."]]

Dr. Roget was relegated to clerical work for the better part of a decade before proving himself to his grandmother. Through her influence -- unbeknownst to him -- he was placed at the center of an classified team assigned to research a large number of lower-priority SCP objects, a position in which he was particularly effective. Through this and through his connection to Director Gillespie, Dr. Roget has gained a significant degree of influence in the years following, despite a reputation for childishness, and has almost accidentally become a controversial figure.

[[include component:image-block name=http://img08.deviantart.net/3962/i/2015/077/9/a/shirley_gillespie_and_ralph_roget_by_sunnyparallax-d8m6ie4.jpg

[[tab Persons of Interest]]

**Alison Chao, "The Black Queen":** [[[the-black-queen| Highly intelligent, highly driven, and possesses extensive knowledge of Foundation structure, activities, and contained items]]]. Sometimes said to be highly malevolent, murderous, and destructive; sometimes said to be more benevolent, even assisting //some// Foundation endeavors in secret. Involved with many major GOIs and world governments. Seems to be aiming to take down the Foundation. Maybe. For more information on the Black Queen, see the [[[black-queen-hub| GOI entry]]].

[[collapsible show="Dad?" hide="..."]]

[[[castling-by-hand| Possibly daughter of Dr. Charles Gears and Leanne Zhu Chao prior to Gears' abandonment of the family and recruitment by the SCP Foundation.]]] Possibly L.S. of the Serpent's Hand. Possibly in contact with a number of parallel universe versions of herself, cooperating to the point of collaborating on a cross-universal database, though rarely interfering in each others' universes except in special circumstances. Or perhaps this is all invention; smoke and mirrors to further the Black Queen's legend. Perhaps.

[[/collapsible]]

**Lord Blackwood:** See [[[SCP-1867]]].

[[collapsible show="I dare say there must be more to it than that!" hide="...."]]

Though his exploits are almost certainly false and do not match recorded history, they have been corroborated to some extent by a startling number of sources.

[[/collapsible]]

**L.S.:** One of the more radical leaders of the Serpent's Hand, known for never being seen. L.S.'s followers receive letters, books, artifacts, and other gifts from their mysterious leader, but no one can quite remember what L.S. looks like - though some swear they have met "him" or "her" or "them". Possesses a talent for seriously breaching Foundation security; has never been witnessed or captured.

[[collapsible show="I'm not anything like you expected" hide="Trust me."]]

"He" may be fictional, but a code-word used by Hand members to identify friendlies, standing for "Lease Signatory". If not fictional, certainly under the effects of [[[SCP-268]]]. May or may not be Alison Chao, aka the Black Queen, and the letters may stand for Little Sister. Other reports claim both are true. Other reported possibilities for the meaning of L.S. include "Lonely Serpent", "Last Saint", "Lost Sinner", and "Loki Scar-lip". Either way, L.S. is definitely only one well-respected "leader" among many in the Hand; L.S. is, however, unique in their focus on targeting the SCP Foundation. (Other Hand leaders tend to primarily target the Global Occult Coalition as their first priority, with the Foundation coming second.)

[[/collapsible]]

**Midnight:** Sapient female cat, well-regarded member of the Serpent's Hand. Known to have some anomalous abilities due to thaumaturgical training, or "magic". Expert on "Ways". (See files on the Wanderer's Library.)

[[collapsible show="Are you expecting me to meow?" hide="meow."]]

Former research project by Global Occult Coalition scholar; a "familiar" for a retired Magus. Master died under unusual circumstances, research suppressed by unknown parties.

[[/collapsible]]

**Mr. Marshall, Mr. Carter, and Mr./Ms. Dark:** The leaders of Marshall, Carter and Dark. Little information is known on any of the members. Reports on Marshall and Carter have been wildly inconsistent. A number of reports characterize Carter as wheelchair-bound, and presenting Marshall as younger; these reports are contradicted completely by other sources saying exactly the opposite.  For more information on Marshall, Carter, and Dark, see the [[[marshall-carter-and-dark-hub|GOI entry]]].

[[collapsible show="The esteemed Misters Marshall, Carter..." hide="... and Dark."]]

The reports on Carter that claim he is wheelchair-bound also claim that he is using anomalous life extension -- apparently feeding off a bagged and drugged (but still aware) human attached to the back of his wheelchair. This may or may not be a lurid rumor.

[[[poi-dark| Reports on Dark fall into three categories]]]. The first category presents Dark as being a role filled by multiple people (of all genders, but possibly originally and currently male) over the last few centuries. The second category presents Dark as a single semi-immortal sapient entity, humanoid in nature if not always in form, able to change bodies and gender to suit current purposes. A third category presents both as true. 

It seems that Marshall and Carter do not themselves fully understand Dark either, and while they handle most operations, Dark has more ultimate control over MC&D than they do. Regardless, it is certain that Dark predates Marshall and Carter significantly.

Curiously, it seems that Dark may be less malevolent than MC&D itself -- whoever they are, their morality seems highly situational, though they are extremely capable of monstrous acts above and beyond the capabilities of their organization.

[[/collapsible]]

**"Nobody":** An individual who appears to be under anomalous effects partially stripping them of their identity in exchange for anomalous ability. May or may not be multiple people (but only one at a time).  Usually reported as an unidentifiable European man dressed in a grey suit and fedora (with the notable exception of an equally unidentifiable woman in a grey suit, fedora, and purple tie). For more information on Nobody, see the [[[nobody-hub|GOI entry]]].

[[collapsible show="Nobody knows." hide="Nobody's here."]]

No one in the Foundation seems to know if Nobody is working for or against the Foundation; if reports are to be believed, the answer is "both". However, many doubt 'his' existence. It is almost certain that many incidents associated with "Nobody" actually had nothing to do with that figure.

[[/collapsible]]

**Saturn Deer:** [[[letters-to-a-prophet| Saturn Deer is a serial reincarnator and oftentimes false prophet.]]] Possesses vaguely understood abilities to control written texts, abilities which are directly connected to his hugely overblown ego. [[[letters-to-a-prophet-2-scry-harder| His motivation is either to scam someone, to humiliate someone, or both.]]]

**The Serpent's Nest:** [[[serpent-s-hand-hub|A small group of Serpent's Hand leaders]]]. No names have been discovered, but figures that have repeatedly been reported include a bipedal female bull moose, a patchwork man, a satyr, and "the silver woman", always accompanied by a varying cast of other Hand members.

**Baron Löwen Silberescher:** A wealthy Lithuanian baron who has been extremely helpful to local Foundation assets. Instrumental in retrieving a number of significant SCP items, including a number located continents away.

[[collapsible show="It's so hard for me to hear them these days" show="Are you listening?"]]
The Baron has been accidentally exposed to a large number of anomalies, and has therefore become psychologically unstable. Foundation personnel are instructed to indulge him to ensure continued cooperation.
[[/collapsible]]

**Dr. S. Vang:** [[[Why Change| Specializes in memetics]]], and by all accounts was an an excellent researcher, [[[Leisure Time| despite a poor memory and poor social skills]]]. [[[Where Your Eyes Don't Go| Defected from the Foundation and is currently considered missing and dangerous.]]]

**Isabel Wondertainment:** [[[adventures-in-capitalism-hub| May or may not exist.]]] If they exist, it is almost certain that they either are or in some way related to the head of the GOI "Dr. Wondertainment." [[[a-funeral-on-mars| Possesses an imagination that is unlimited and manufacturing capacity to match.]]]

Also known for being associated with the "Little Mister" humanoid anomalies, which have claimed variously to be manufactured human beings, mutants, persons made through Frankenstein-esque methodology, and androids. These individuals have been found abandoned all over the world.

**Vincent Anderson:** [[[anderson-robotics-hub| Highly intelligent, cybernetically augmented, and a skilled thaumaturgist, Vincent Anderson is the Founder and CEO of the Anderson Robotics Group of Interest.]]] Most of Anderson's interactions with the Foundation [[[no-good-deed| have been in retaliation to Foundation efforts to contain his operation, including multiple security breaches, and impersonation of Foundation personnel by Saker Androids]]]. Anderson currently maintains strong business ties with MC&D and has numerous supporters within the Maxwellist Church.

[[tab Former Personnel]]

= //In retirement or death, no rank distinction is made.//

**General ██████ Bowe, ████:** More than anyone, the man who represents the old sins of the Foundation. Promoted after the death of his father, General Stan Bowe, by the effects of [[[SCP-935]]]. As his father's protege, he was assigned as the head of the Bowe Commission, which began for murky still-classified reasons and expanded in scope under the younger Bowe, ending with a nearly sole focus on weaponizing SCP objects before its dissolution. Has since left the Foundation.

[[collapsible show="ACCesDend" hide="dsdffdsfvd"]]
Under the younger Bowe, the Bowe Commission shifted the Foundation's paramilitary focus from defense to offense. The Bowe Commission was responsible for the creation of "Project Able" and Mobile Task Force Omega-7 ("Pandora's Box"), given permission for the project after a number of successful operations against several dangerous groups of interest. Bowe was personally responsible for much of the worst excesses of the project; he allowed [[[SCP-076]]]-2 to take a leadership role and have say in which SCP items were allowed to join, and he personally ordered the project to continue after an incident in which 076-2 killed a number of researchers. When 076-2 disabled its restraints and slaughtered most of the other Mobile Task Force members and caused the destruction of Containment Area-25, Bowe was assigned primary blame. MTF Omega-7 was dissolved, as was the Bowe Commission. As a result of this, and the [[[SCP-935]]] incidents, Much of the Foundation's paramilitary arm was censured or defected after this, and many of the Bowe Commission's supporters defected to the Chaos Insurgency or the Global Occult Coalition.

[[/collapsible]]

**Agent Jack "PoorYoric" Dawkins:** Generally referred to as Yoric. Known for his murky past and harsh, incisive attitude. Former protege of Dr. Bright. Now vanished.

[[collapsible show="Don't worry guys, I'm still around." hide="..."]]
May or may not have been executed by the Foundation; may simply working under deep cover. After his disappearance, a rumor spread that he had been a spy for the Serpent's Hand, outed to the Foundation after a falling out with his compatriots. This rumor has never been confirmed.

**Mr. David Eskobar:** Former head researcher for GOI Alexylva University. Missing and presumed killed during a Site-38 containment breach.

**Dr. "Iceberg":** Egotistical, narcissistic [[[epitaph|former protege]]] of Dr. Gears. Eventually [[[in-his-own-image| committed suicide]]] due to the stress of working under Gears; replaced by Agent Lament.

**Agent Bantay Masipag:** Former Site-19 Security Director. She is the agent who originally retrieved [[[SCP-148]]] ("Telekill") from Prometheus Labs. Now retired.

**Dr. Agatha Rights:** [[[rights-birthday-party| Developed a remarkable reputation as a researcher-analyst and became an influential Site Director before disappearing under murky circumstances.]]] Known for being extremely empathetic towards Foundation personnel and anomalous humanoids.

**Dr. Snorlison:** {{%//DATABASE ERROR//%}}

[[collapsible show="This researcher does not officially exist." hide="Access Denied"]]
Wiped from Foundation records and collective memory by O5 Command. Perhaps temporarily. Perhaps not. Those who carefully search may find out why.
"I see a future where SCPs walk up to our doors and hope for a chance to turn themselves over to us. I see a future where every child dreams of being an SCP.
"I see a future where we've harnessed their inherent preternatural power the way we harnessed the electron and the atom.
"It would be glorious."

**[[[doctor-ronald-stimson-s-personnel-file | Dr. Ronald Stimson]]]:** Vanished.

**Agent Max Lombardi:** [[[the-lombardi-tales|Gruff, plain-speaking, down-to-earth veteran "agent's agent". Now deceased.]]]

[[collapsible show="But..." hide="..."]]

//Yet some agents say in many parts of the Foundation that Agent Lombardi is not dead, but had by the will of our lords the O5 Council into another place; and men say that he shall come again, and he shall win the Thaumiel Crown. I will not say it shall be so, but rather I will say, here in this world he changed his life. But many men say that there is written upon his tomb this verse: Here Lies Lombardi, Once and Future Agent.//

**Dr. Kondraki:** Former Site Director of Site-17. Extremely controversial figure who vanished from the Foundation some time ago. Ambitious, artistic, chaotic, paranoid, anti-social, spiteful; seen by many as an archetypal anti-hero. [[[incident-239-b-clef-kondraki| Known to run roughshod over others; reprimanded for abuse of lower-ranked or newer Foundation employees]]]. A strong flair for the dramatic. An excellent photographer. Formerly associated with [[[SCP-408]]] to a possibly inappropriate degree. Grew rivals on trees; most famously former rival of Dr. Alto Clef.

[[collapsible show="I only followed orders!" hide="They just happened to be orders from me."]]

Extensively researched SCP weaponization for now-shuttered programs. Likely gone on the run from the Foundation. Possibly dead. May have been executed by O5 order by Dr. Gears. (Rumors of execution by Dr. Clef per O5 order are certainly untrue. Almost certainly.) May still be alive and working for the Foundation under deep cover.

[[tab O5 Command and The Administrator]]

**O5 Command:** 13 people who have ultimate control over the Foundation. Unusual personalities with way too much power. They do not and cannot come into contact with any anomalous entities. Most everyone is afraid of them. They know absolutely everything there is to know about the Foundation and its activities. They rarely intervene in the containment of SCPs... but sometimes, sometimes they do, with reasons known only to them. They have their own Mobile Task Force, the Red Right Hand, who alternately act as the researcher's best friend and an outright medieval inquisition, complete with 'disappearing' people who the O5s disfavor. O5 Command are the masters of the Foundation, and not everyone even knows they exist.

[[collapsible show="Nothing is certain." hide="Especially not us. God no."]]

...//Maybe.// Maybe there are 13, maybe they are people. They're not //supposed// to come into contact with anomalous entities, but in secret, sometimes they do. Who are they? Where did they come from? What secret goals are they striving towards? Either way, O5 Command is necessary -- the cornerstone of the Foundation. At the very least, they have the Foundation's best interests at heart. ...Maybe.

**"The Administrator":** Figure of little-known nature playing a role best understood by O5 Command. Possibly anomalous, possibly multiple people. Once represented the Foundation in meetings with major world government figures; has since relinquished this role.

[[collapsible show="It's not supposed to have that many arms." hide="Nothing is."]]

Masculine. Descent/origin unknown. Head appears 30+. Unkempt hair. Wears thick-lensed glasses. Wears. SCP-262 (Coat of Many Arms). Nonhuman body.

Apparently a human hybrid, or nonhuman entirely. Remarkable in appearance: A mostly human head, albeit with orange eyes. Body is completely nonhuman and hardly even bipedal, made of a twisted, weathered charcoal-like material, with atrophied natural limbs. A steel mesh covering holds the body inside the Coat of Many arms, and some of the many arms keep it in place. Other arms make up his "arms" and "legs", giving him either a generally humanoid look or a rather spidery look depending on how subtle he's attempting to be.

Apparently associated with the SCP Foundation since its inception, though always in a supporting role, not at the top of the power structure. Possibly owns the land Site-19 is built on. Only a few personnel outside of O5 Command have ever seen him.

References in reports claim this Administrator originates from "The Plane Where Eyes Cannot Follow."
