[[size 130%]]The Foundation is made up of numerous personnel, each one bringing individual skills and abilities to the fore. Outside of the Foundation, there are thousands of people living in and around anomalous communities. Anartists, magic users and extradimensional beings are but a few instances of what the Foundation has encountered.

[[tab Foundation Doctors and Researchers]]

**Dr. Lakshmi Agarwal:** A [[[Whoa, Here She Comes |withdrawn and uptight specialist in animal behavior]]] with a [[[Show You What All That Howl Is For |mysterious connection]]] to a dangerous Keter class entity. Loyalties to the Foundation are [[[The Beast You've Made Of Me |questionable]]], romantic entanglement with her subject is [[[I Keep The Wolf From The Door |likely]]], involvement with the Serpent's Hand is [[[I Slip, I'm Still An Animal |suspected.]]]

----

**Dr. Charles Anborough:** Director of Sites 59 and 117, Keter containment specialist. Curious and crippled, a nuclear physicist [[[Exit History|who can't seem to stay away]]] from [[[SCP-2400|cataclysmic threats.]]] Fortunately, through an absurd combination of [[[Too Insane to Fail|improvisation and miracles]]], he seems to be the best man for the job. [[[Footsteps|His sad smile and dry humor]]] belie the confused past of a man always [[[SCP-1649|searching for answers.]]]

[[collapsible show="I fucking hate you!" hide="I just...I miss you...dad."]]

He walks in the shadow of a great man, throughout his whole life and to this day, and he is none the wiser. Keeping several ends of the world in check, stopping XK, YK and ZK events, none of it will ever be enough to satiate his envy, his hatred...his great emptiness from which the tears will never run dry. He will never stop searching for answers, and, for the sake of humanity, it is imperative that he finds one.

[[/collapsible]]

----

**Dr. Django Bridge:** [[[conclusions-red-173-2263-incident| Foundation Archivist]]]. Quiet but influential, with a touch of both melancholy and whimsy. Extraordinary memory. [[[a-site-19-christmas-carol| Known to be on a first-name basis with Dr. Bright, and has frequently acted as an informal assistant for him.]]]

----

**Dr. Jack Bright:** [[[an-evening-with-bright| Director of Foundation Personnel]]]. [[[the-best-and-the-wisest| Somewhat amoral]]]. [[[Unfinished Business|Extremely loyal to the Foundation]]]. May or may not be [[[the-things-dr-bright-is-not-allowed-to-do-at-the-foundation| friendly and/or terrifying]]]; is certainly [[[we-re-off-to-be-the-lizard| blunt]]]. Attached to [[[SCP-963]]], and is therefore immortal, using the body of whatever 963 has last touched. 

[[collapsible show="I've been with the company for a long time." hide="I am not the damned monkey."]]
His relatives and siblings have been associated with the Foundation since time immemorial. His younger brother is [[[SCP-590]]] (which a few know); [[[SCP-321]]] is a sister (which almost no one knows). At least two other relatives work for the Foundation at a high level. Several of Bright's discarded bodies -- still possessing his personality and knowledge at time of separation from 963 -- have been put to work on secret Foundation projects. Bright possesses a desire to permanently die that he may not be conscious of; ironic, for he only became part of 963 because he was //not// trying to die.

----

**Dr. Jeremiah Cimmerian:** [[[lending-a-hand| An ethics committee liaison that takes his job only somewhat seriously]]]. He never thought his doctorate in English Literature or his minor in philosophy would actually help him stay employed, but the former got him recruited into the Foundation as a researcher and the latter secured his employment in the long term. Has an unusual interest in puns and the ethical treatment of humanoids.

----

**Dr. Alto Clef:** A highly [[[timeandrelativedimensionsincontainmentprotocols| adaptable]]], clever [[[father-of-lies| liar]]]. Former GOC operative, [[[termination-order| specializing in reality benders]]]. Also [[[contingency| former file clerk]]]. Undergone anomalous alterations that provide resistance to reality shifts and prevent his face from being photographed. Has a long and checkered history, and a somewhat hidden streak of self-hatred. Reformed misogynist. Most rumors about him are exaggerated or off-point. [[[poopstick-mcgee-and-the-flying-walruses| Don't call him genre-savvy or enigmatic.]]]

[[collapsible show="They'll say anything about me." hide="Except the truth."]]
GOC codename Agent Ukelele prior to defection. May or may not have had a child with a nature goddess as a teenage boy; the goddess was killed by the GOC, but the daughter became a (current) SCP object -- if this even happened at all. Involved in a number of CK-class reality restructuring events (and may be able to remember them). (Is) (Is not) a manifestation of the being popularly known as the Devil, despite claims to the contrary. 

[[/collapsible]]

----

**Researcher Jacob Conwell:** Anomalous Materials Analyst. Masters Degree in Analytical Chemistry. Current head of the [[[All Hallows|Site-64 AMat Lab]]]. Frequently called upon, Conwell has made a name for himself in the Foundation as a hard worker.

[[collapsible show="I'm doing so much these days." hide="..."]]

Initially over eager to please Foundation superiors, promotion to primary investigator positions has resulted in [[[Peregrine|multiple depressive episodes]]] and insomnia, though these have improved following Conwell's transfer to Site-64 and marriage. Routine psychological evaluations are ongoing.

[[/collapsible]]

----

**Dr. Kain "Pathos" Crow:** [[[olympia| Cross-disciplinary]]] //wunderkind// researcher, specializing particularly in [[[dr-cog-and-the-plastic-fantastic| biochemistry]]] and [[[new-tricks| robotics]]]. Rarely, if ever, seen in public. May or may not have been permanently transformed into a dog-like body as the result of a particular anomalous event.

[[collapsible show="I'm so tired these days." hide=" I don't even want to work on the walker..."]]

Ran a number of highly classified cross-testing experiments with the aim of creating useful objects of anomalous origin, notably Project Olympia. Nearly terminated several times. Difficulties in the canine body and an unclear lifespan have resulted in a considerable drop in productivity. Many of his side projects have become dormant.

[[/collapsible]]

----

**Dr. Michael Edison:** Level-3 Researcher, current head of the Site-19 Metafiction department, as well as its only member. Dr. Edison has received disciplinary action on multiple occasions due to a repeated pattern of [[[scp-foundation-the-movie | unsanctioned]]] and [[[game-day-1-die-hardest|ill-conceived]]] behavior. These behaviors have resulted in temporary reassignment to the Site-██ antarctic base. His current assignment at Site 19 is contingent on approval from his assigned therapist.

[[collapsible show="My legends begins in the 12th century..." hide="FOOL!"]]

Though quiet and reserved most of the time, Dr. Edison secretly dreams of being a badass like Dr. Clef (or at least the image most staffers have of Dr. Clef). While respected as a researcher, his attempts at more outrageous endeavors are most often met with derision. Has a petty, but long-standing grudge against Delivery Agent Roadrunner. [[[bargain-bin-of-direct-to-forum-sequels| Is known to]]] [[[dr-ikari-i-presume|sometimes write]]] [[[scp-foundation-the-movie-2| terrible fanfiction.]]]

[[/collapsible]]

----
**Dr. Chelsea "Photosynthetic" Elliott:** Plant specialist, both anomalous and non-anomalous. Dedicated, friendly, prone to tunnel vision. Often in the field; excessively 'hands-on' in her lab and field research, leading to a number of injuries. Scars cover her hands and arms.

[[collapsible show="We're at the cusp of something here." hide="..."]]

Possible anomalous capability due to exposure to an anomalous item (a "sun of unknown provenance"). This is unknown to her, and investigation is ongoing. Possible security risk due to strong personal desire to advance worldwide scientific knowledge in her chosen field; she's possibly a little //too// excited about the marvels she has studied.

[[/collapsible]]

----

**Dr. Charles Gears ("COG"):** [[[epitaph| A man strangely lacking in emotional response]]] (to the point of lacking a startle response) and possessing unusual levels of [[[lullaby| logic and intellect]]]. Former Euclid-class object specialist before having his area of study expanded. Has been deeply involved with research regarding a truly shocking number of SCP objects both major and minor. [[[in-his-own-image| A figure of great influence]]] in recent Foundation history. 

[[collapsible show="It is not acceptable to inquire that." hide="I do what is required."]]
Records claim he was recruited shortly after the founding of the Foundation... despite his age and personal history not quite matching up to that timeline. A personal fact that few know: He //does// feel emotion, when it's significant. He simply does not react to it or show it. Because he cannot. Why? If there is a reason, few know. Possibly the father of [[[pawn-to-e4|Alison Chao]]], the woman calling herself the "Black Queen".

[[/collapsible]]

----

**Dr. Simon Glass:** Head of Psychology. [[[Routine Psychological Evaluations By Dr Glass| Trusted with performing psychological evaluations of highly ranked Foundation personnel]]]. Very empathetic. Sometimes considered "soft" -- and that's true, for a Foundation researcher, but he's still well-trusted. In the course of [[[oneirocritic| his interviews]]], he has gained knowledge of more and more terrible secrets, yet still holds on to both his sanity and empathy.

[[collapsible show="I talk to everyone, I know everyone..." hide="... Of course I'm loyal."]]
Associates linked to a number of groups of interest, including the Chaos Insurgency (via a relative) and the Serpent's Hand. Feels self-conscious about how higher-ups view him because of this.

[[/collapsible]]

----

**Dr. Frederick Heiden:** Neurology specialist. Anxious, uncertain, empathic, focused on logic. Involved in a number of highly classified projects, despite initially being barred from any non-Safe-classed objects.
[[collapsible show="Shhhhhh." hide="..."]]
May be secretly under Dr. Bright's wing. There are... "plans" for Heiden. Or... were. Perhaps. Heiden may or may not have been killed and brought back to life; he may or may not in fact be dead, though he is listed as active staff and appears to be playing some kind of role within the Foundation regardless.##white|^^1^^##
##white|^^1^^he's just heiden'##
[[/collapsible]]

----

**Dr. Everett King:** One of the Foundation's most experienced mathematicians, Doctor King's reputation has nevertheless been overtaken by his [[[scp-216| testing record]]] involving unusual results. Despite this, he regularly contributes to internal Foundation intellectual periodicals.

[[collapsible show="I don't want any more goddamn apples." hide="And I've never gotten any..."]]

Dr. King's testing must be heavily supervised, due to the presence of apple seeds that seem to be increasing exponentially in intensity. [[[long-live-the-king| Intensive observation indicates Dr. King is irritated by his seemingly inherit effect]]].


[[/collapsible]]

----

**Dr. Zyn Kiryu:** Highly prolific researcher. Involved in a number of [[[lucky dinosaur | classified]]] Foundation projects. Obsessive, driven, often not eating or sleeping in favor of finishing tasks. Joined the Foundation before finishing her schooling; finished through [[[snakes and ladders | an accelerated Foundation program]]]. Initially closed-off and withdrawn, but opened up due to a latent ambitious streak. She often volunteers to handle new Foundation member intake, hoping to give new members a positive introduction to an often deeply horrifying organization. Has a private flair for poetry. Has accidentally inherited the absent Dr. Kondraki's affiliation with anomalous butterflies, including [[[SCP-408]]] after Kondraki's disappearance.

[[collapsible show="I didn't ask for this." hide="You know that's from a game, right?"]]
Has a brother, Mark Kiryu, a higher-ranked researcher. O5 Command has its eye fixed on Zyn Kiryu for unknown reasons, having dismissed her higher-ranked brother as ultimately irrelevant. She is being watched and investigated by the Red Right Hand -- whether positively or negatively is unknown.
[[/collapsible]]

----

**Dr. Mark Kiryu:** Senior researcher and director of an anomalous items [[[kiryu labs hub | processing lab]]]. Upon initial recruitment, had a successful career as a therapist (licensed psychologist). Worked extensively with [[[SCP-1457]]] in his first years with the Foundation but doesn't talk about that, and has spearheaded several projects involving sapient SCP entities. Cheery attitude and a good listener; looks out for his coworkers and interns like a bit of a mother hen sometimes. Has a ceramic seahorse and potted bamboo on his desk.

----

**Dr. Adam Leeward:** [[[baby-s-first-guide-to-keter-class-anomalies-and-other-questi|Emotionally confused]]] and [[[too-old-to-lie-too-cold-to-love|ethically conflicted]]] humanoid containment specialist from Site-11 and living in Site-81. May or may not have made a few mistakes, may or may not have cleaned up a few mistakes. Not without the standard degree of coldness in personality traits, but with a few (sometimes painful) soft spots.

[[collapsible show="There's something off about you, Lee." hide="- Of course, there always was."]]

Under watch for abnormal behavior. Well-intentioned, but not without flaws. Of course, in this field, flaws like these can get you in deeper than you ever [[[scp-2708|expected.]]]

[[/collapsible]]

----

**Dr. Sophia Light:** Biologist, surgeon and Site Director with [[[maria-jones-this-is-your-life| far, far too many secrets]]]. A likeable yet frightening person. Blunt, determined, calculating; good under pressure. Putting effort into remaining friendly and open (and emotionally stable). Bears minor facial scarring, and an old injury in her left hand sometimes impairs its functionality. Somewhat traumatic childhood; caretakers forced her to learn outdoor survival by leaving her stranded in the African wilderness for days on end. Joined the Foundation after a classified anomalous incident that killed eleven people, including her then-fiancee. Currently or formerly romantically linked with Troy Lament.

[[collapsible show="It's not my fault they want another meeting." hide="..."]]
The rumors that persist of Dr. Light's strangely close involvement with O5 Command are accurate. Seems to have been involved in a number of highly classified reality shifts -- including some initiated by the Foundation itself. A centrally important figure to the Foundation for a number of extremely secret reasons, some of which she doesn't know (or does not still remember) herself.

[[/collapsible]]

----

**Dr. Everett Mann:** [[[the-hatbot-chronicles| Unconventional medical researcher]]] with few scruples and a specialty in unusual forms of surgery. Jokingly referred to as a "mad scientist". [[[ecceperago| Sometimes not-so-jokingly]]]. (He objects to the term "mad scientist", claiming that "mad doctor" would be more accurate, and further that the difference should be plain to anyone with a proper academic background to speak of.) [[[the-gate-opens| Easily willing to do monstrous things in the name of research]]]. Possesses a dramatic mustache. Due to his upbringing, [[[Be a Dali and Help a Mann Out, or The Lamentable State of Modern Art| his cultural and popular knowledges are woefully out of date]]], leading to anachronistic and ridiculous situations. 

[[collapsible show="Yes, I wanted to show you what I've been working on." hide="It's dreadfully fascinating."]]
Came to Foundation attention via the uncle who raised him, a person of interest to the Foundation due to anomalous research. Considered a potential danger to the Foundation under certain predicted future circumstances.

[[/collapsible]]

----

**Dr. Jaime Marlowe:** Average researcher, specializing in [[[SCP-2021| space-time]]], [[[SCP-2093| extra-dimensional]]], and [[[SCP-922| visual, spatial]]], and [[[SCP-2981| cognitohazardous]]] anomalies.  Previously described as "painfully, painfully, painfully average", notable more for minor interpersonal incidents and inappropriate outbursts when under stress.  Marlowe's profile has slightly increased due to apparent [[[scp-2084-email-correspondence| unexplained connections]]] to unrelated anomalous events which only appear to have [[[SCP-1934| increased]]] in frequency.

----

**Dr. Riven Mercer:** Veterinary-focused researcher, the second-in-command of Kiryu Labs. Handles personnel allocation for incoming [[[reality check | anomalous item]]] caches, and often goes on [[[remember you | outside assignments]]]. Good with animals, and owns a grumpy bearded dragon lizard who lives in the lab.

----

**Technical Researcher David Rosen:** [[[new-technical-issues| Technical Advisor]]] and Researcher. [[[Technical-Orientation| Responsible for ensuring the continued functionality of Site-19's technical infrastructure]]]. Known for being acerbic and marginally accident-prone, he also manages the facilities technical department very well and is widely see as a thrifty leader.

[[collapsible show="You want me to what?" hide="Uhh..."]]

[[[the-swift-rise-and-fall-of-technical-researcher-david-rosen| Rosen actually knows very little about some of the more modern systems he's maintaining]]], but has been able to bluff his way past that by delegating individuals more qualified than he to work on them.

[[/collapsible]]

----

**Dr. Katherine Sinclair:** Acting head- and one of only two members- of the Occult Studies and Thaumatology division at [[[the-s-c-plastics-hub | Site-87]]] in Sloth's Pit, Wisconsin. Has been involved in numerous incidents, including [http://www.scp-wiki.net/satyr-s-reign the assault on Sloth's Pit by the now defunct Group of Interest Satyr's Reign], and the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/holy-crap-this-is-a-long-christmas-tale the 2014 Christmas Incident]. Has burn scarring on her forearms from a [http://www.scp-wiki.net/playing-with-flames botched flame ritual].

[[collapsible show="It's not thaumaturgy, it's magic!" hide="..."]]

Dr. Sinclair performed her first spell at the age of 17, accidentally setting fire to her notebook by drawing a Hermetic Circle and infusing it with some latent magical talent she possessed. In college, she got involved with a more violent sect of the Serpent's Hand, and after seeing they were willing to sacrifice humans -- which could lead to very violent thaumaturgical consequences -- she practically ran to the Foundation. Any rumors about her hobbies and personal life are lies and slander.

[[/collapsible]]

----
**Dr. Johannes Sorts:** Memetic specialist and field researcher, with a doctorate in art history.  Caucasian, late 30s, unshaven with greying brown hair.  Slightly overweight, usually wears a grey cap. [[[that-goddamn-thing| Obsessive, cowardly and paranoid in mundane situations, but solid and focused when presented with memetic or information based hazards]]].  Multiple disciplinary reports due to poor choice of action under pressure, including the shooting of a guard while under my influence.  Currently under psychiatric evaluation and restricted to safer projects.

[[collapsible show="The fucking Foundation and that fucking toaster." hide="..."]]
Influenced far, far more of the Foundation's fundamental doctrines than anyone is willing to admit.  Under constant supervision due to several attempts to breach internal security on objects outside of his jurisdiction.
[[/collapsible]]

----

**Dr. Thaddeus Xyank:** [[[audio-transcript-2400-2700-anborough-xyank| Presently low-level but extremely significant Foundation researcher]]]. [[[iteration-0| Specializes in temporal anomalies]]]. Somewhat arrogant and long-winded, but considered an up-and-coming genius.

[[collapsible show="Where is he? Where isn't he?" hide="..."]]

Extensive involvement in major Thaumiel projects, notably [[[SCP-2000]]].

[[tab Foundation Agents]]

**Agent Green:** Real name classified.  Originally a GOC operative responsible for the assassination of reality benders.  [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2162 |Became involved]]] with a reality bender creating anomalous art, [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/figure-and-ground |working with]]] Agent Navarro.  Has since become an [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/it-just-shattered |anart specialist]]], leading investigations and acting [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/permanent-waves |as an advisor]]] to other teams.  [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/detained |Good with interrogations]]], and likes to be in charge.  Never seen without a cigarette.

------

**Agent Troy Lament:** Containment and recovery specialist. [[[in-his-own-image| Protege of Dr. Gears after Iceberg's suicide]]]. Deeply scarred due to his experiences at the Foundation. Currently or formerly romantically linked with Sophia Light.

[[collapsible show="Yeah, what's up?" hide="..."]]
One of the best-kept secrets in the Foundation is Lament's high status within the organization. Haunted by his experience, plagued by doubt, and possessing scant desire for power, Lament is happy to keep his secret a secret. He plays his role unwillingly and with great reluctance. Occasionally his status has been used to get him closer to targets who do not realize he is anything more than Gears' former assistant.
[[/collapsible]]

----

**Agent Sasha Merlo:** [[[the-elusive-anderson| Cyber Operations Specialist]]]. Current commander of [[[Austringers|MTF Gamma-13]]] (Asimov's Lawbringers). Cheerful, if rather dry and sarcastic. Several disciplinary reports for reckless actions during MTF field operations. Current support from Site-64's Director Holman suggest potential for [[[Decisions We Make|eventual promotion]]] to administrative duties in the future.

----

**Agent Navarro:** [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/fragment:three-farewells-navarro| Originally captured as a Person of Interest in Portland, Oregon in mid-2004]]], and acted as a double agent for the Foundation until he was officially employed in late-2005. Called in as a specialist in cases of anomalous art, also acts as liaison between the Foundation and various anartists. Friendly and easy-going to the point of bordering fault. Easily recognized by his perma-stubble. 

[[collapsible show="I'm being serious guys." hide="No I don't have a damn scar."]]

Is a self-described "wizard" and is capable of using anomalous phenomena ("magic"), though is not himself anomalous. Has received multiple infractions for the unapproved use of anomalous items and phenomena.
[[/collapsible]]

----

**Agent Dmitri Arkadeyevich "Waxx" Strelnikov:** [[[oldmenyoungmen| Former Site Security Director, most famously former acting Site Director of Site-19]]]. Former leader of now-disbanded [[[reddawn| MTF Red Dawn]]]. Russian in origin, operated extensively in Eastern Europe. [[[elder-baconator| Strange sense of humor]]]; subject of numerous infamous practical jokes. Now happily retired with a large pension.

[[tab Foundation Administrators]]

**Director Jean Karlyle Aktus:** Director of [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-81| Site-81]]] and a seemingly impossibly old man, known for his analytic approach to containment leading to thorough and successful containment procedures. Aktus serves as the head of the Foundation's Classification Committee, and is also involved with several exotic mobile task forces, including [[[integrity-project| Alpha-9]]] and [[[hello-world| Kappa-10]]]. 

[[collapsible show="Won't you spare me over ‘til a another year?" hide="..."]]

They say he died when he was in his thirties. Complications from leukemia, something he picked up shortly after the way. I've heard that an Overseer reached in and pulled his soul out from the void, pushed it back into his body and set him in motion again. "Too much work to do, Karlyle," they told him. "Death can't have you yet."

He'll disappear for weeks at a time, always coming back looking a little less like himself. Medicine, I'm sure. Something they're pumping in him to keep him alive. Keep him working. Only a matter of time before his body gives out, right? A man can't live forever, right?

Or maybe he can.

//Won't you spare me over ‘til a another year?//
[[/collapsible]]

----

**Director Shirley Gillespie** and **Dr. Ralph Roget:** [[[boss-of-me| Director Shirley Gillespie is a part of the oldest guard in the Foundation]]] -- holding a directorship in [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-77| Site-77]]], a storage facility now disguised as an Amazon.com shipping center, for over fifty years. [[[I Was Not Magnificent| Although constantly rumored to be retiring]]], she still exerts influence, sometimes through her grandson, Dr. Ralph Roget. 

[[collapsible show="Don't worry, you're going to blow them all away." hide="..."]]

Dr. Roget was relegated to clerical work for the better part of a decade before proving himself to his grandmother. Through her influence -- unbeknownst to him -- he was placed at the center of an classified team assigned to research a large number of lower-priority SCP objects, a position in which he was particularly effective. Through this and through his connection to Director Gillespie, Dr. Roget has gained a significant degree of influence in the years following, despite a reputation for childishness, and has almost accidentally become a controversial figure.

[[/collapsible]]


----


**Director Maria Jones:** Director of Records and Information Security Administration ([[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2998-1| RAISA]]]). Powerful and isolated, Director Jones ultimately controls much of the ebb and flow of information across the Foundation, both inside and between facilities. She has few friends, but is loyal to those few she has. Everyone knows her name as a matter of course, but few people know //her//.

----

**Dr. Tilda D. Moose:** [[[cat-s-in-the-cradle|Current Site]]] Director of Site-19 and Co-Director of Site-17, having inherited the positions from a string of previous Directors. Stern, anxious, mildly obsessive. [[[another-goddamn-magic-system|Can become overly passionate once something gets her going]]]. Considered to have an outsized degree of influence given relatively short official length of tenure with the Foundation (under a decade). Some of Site-19's bureaucracy sees her as a figurehead, whether accurately or not.

[[collapsible show="You don't need to worry about me. I'm not biting off more than I can chew this time." hide="..."]]
[[[SCP-1985|Specialist on K-Class scenario research]]]. Advises on thaumotological anomalies. [[[the-high-court-with-the-magic-army|"Type Blue" status]]] kept largely secret to stave off controversy. Considered risk factor due to past association with the Serpent's Hand, self-inflicted brain damage (non-amnestic memory alteration), and stresses of current positions. Subject to active O5 monitoring, and associated with Agent Troy Lament on a number of classified projects -- much to Lament's chagrin.

**Director Ruslav Diaghilev:** [[[finding-balance| Director Diaghilev has been involved with the Foundation for an unknown period of time]]], but currently heads the Alchemy Department from Site-127.  Director Diaghilev is the resident expert on Alchemical phenomena and has assisted in the containment of [[[scp-3714 | several alchemic SCP objects]]].  Additionally any and all alchemic creatures fall under [[[lepidoptraetheia | his purview]]], though outside consultants may be required from time to time.

Director Diaghilev is the primary contact and educator for Foundation Alchemists on staff.  Any and all requests for consultation can be directed to his office.  Additionally, Director Diaghilev is assigned a personal MTF for [[[an-alchemist-goes-to-war | the assistance in recovery of significant alchemic objects.]]]

[[collapsible show="Alchemy is all around us, and flows through us, constantly striving for balance." hide="..."]]

Director Diaghilev has special dispensation for the classification and redaction of alchemic objects.  Requests for the [[[restoring-harmony | full details of Director Diaghilev's personnel file]]] are restricted to A-6 clearance, only.  Information will be granted on a need-to-know basis.  Any and all rumors of Director Diaghilev's involvement in SCP-001 are grossly exaggerated, and spreading of these rumors will constitute disciplinary action.

[[tab Persons of Interest]]


**Vincent Anderson:** [[[anderson-robotics-hub| Highly intelligent, cybernetically augmented, and a skilled thaumaturgist, Vincent Anderson is the Founder and CEO of the Anderson Robotics Group of Interest.]]] Most of Anderson's interactions with the Foundation [[[no-good-deed| have been in retaliation to Foundation efforts to contain his operation, including multiple security breaches, and impersonation of Foundation personnel by Saker Androids]]]. Anderson currently maintains strong business ties with MC&D and has numerous supporters within the Maxwellist Church.

----

**Adrian Baudin:** A solitary anomalous artist of [[[SCP-2985 | minor repute]]]. Baudin's status is unknown [[[loss-and-nostalgia#adrian | following the events of the Greenwich Incident]]], with which he was tangentially involved. Currently believed to be [[[what-happened-at-greenwich | in hiding]]], [[[who-are-the-cool-kids | detained]]], or deceased.

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/system:page-tags/tag/adrian-baudin#pages Regardless, Baudin is not believed to pose a threat to Foundation interests.]

----

**Alexei Belitrov, "Father Anvil," "Roach":** Contained at Site-17 as [[[SCP-2273]]] in most observed reality constructs. Classified as a Type-C Sapient Anomaly, Alexei Belitrov has been compliant and cooperative with the Foundation in Baseline reality and most observed derivatives. He is fluent in Russian and German and has excelled in his English lessons. Alexei is believed to be of extra-universal origins and claims to have a [[[War is Child's Play|military background]]]. Mr. Belitrov has a general [[[scp-2273-f|aversion to violence]]]. However, if his claims of combat experience and memory retention are to be believed, it is likely that Alexei Belitrov remains capable of acts of armed violence.

Of note is that, in Reality Construct MM15JS, an entity resembling [[[SCP-2117]]] manifested momentarily in Alexei Belitrov's quarters on [[[retired extremely dangerous|22 March 2015]]]. Upon de-manifesting, Alexei Belitrov was no longer present in the cell. This event coincided with a [[[let the games begin|mass]]] [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-1150543/ containment breach] within this reality construct. Contact with this reality construct was lost soon after. Both the significance of this event and Alexei Belitrov's status within this reality construct are currently unknown.

Additionally, in Reality Construct FZ27GO, [[[Heroic Spirit Alexei Belitrov|multiple persons resembling Alexei Belitrov spontaneously manifested]]], and were frequently sighted fighting at nighttime. In most occasions, these iterations of Alexei Belitrov are accompanied by a unidentified human with a red tattoo on one of their hands.

**Alison Chao, "The Black Queen":** [[[the-black-queen| Highly intelligent, highly driven, and possesses extensive knowledge of Foundation structure, activities, and contained items]]]. Sometimes said to be highly malevolent, murderous, and destructive; sometimes said to be more benevolent, even assisting //some// Foundation endeavors in secret. Involved with many major GOIs and world governments. Seems to be aiming to take down the Foundation. Maybe. For more information on the Black Queen, see the [[[black-queen-hub| GOI entry]]].

Or perhaps this is all invention; smoke and mirrors to further the Black Queen's legend. Perhaps.

**L.S.:** One [[[scp-407| of]]] the more [[[queen-s-gambit| radical leaders of the Serpent's Hand, known for never being seen]]]. [[[family| L.S.'s followers]]] receive letters, books, artifacts, and other gifts from their mysterious leader, but no one can [[[prisoners| quite remember]]] what L.S. looks like - though some swear they have met "him" or "her" or "them". Possesses a talent for seriously breaching Foundation security; has never been witnessed or captured.

[[collapsible show="I'm not anything like you expected" hide="Trust me."]]

"He" may be fictional, but a code-word used by Hand members to identify friendlies, standing for "Lease Signatory". If not fictional, certainly under the effects of [[[SCP-268]]]. May or may not be Alison Chao, aka the Black Queen, and the letters may stand for Little Sister. Other reports claim both are true. [[[the-reassembled-one| Other reported possibilities]]] for the meaning of L.S. include "Lonely Serpent", "Last Saint", "Lost Sinner", and "Loki Scar-lip". Either way, L.S. is definitely only one well-respected "leader" among many in the Hand; L.S. is, however, unique in their focus on targeting the SCP Foundation. (Other Hand leaders tend to primarily target the Global Occult Coalition as their first priority, with the Foundation coming second.)

**[[[skitter-marshall| Mr. Marshall]]], [[[robert-carter| Mr. Carter]]], and [[[poi-dark| Mr./Ms. Dark]]]:** [[[acquisitions1| The leaders of Marshall, Carter and Dark]]]. [[[interlude-excerpt-from-an-auction-catalog-marshall-carter-an| Little information is known on any of the members]]]. [[[acquisitions2| Reports on Marshall and Carter have been wildly inconsistent]]]. A number of reports characterize Carter as wheelchair-bound, and presenting Marshall as younger; [[[acquisitions3| these reports are contradicted completely by other sources saying exactly the opposite]]].  For more information on Marshall, Carter, and Dark, see the [[[marshall-carter-and-dark-hub|GOI entry]]].

[[collapsible show="The esteemed Misters Marshall, Carter..." hide="... and Dark."]]

The reports on Carter that claim he is wheelchair-bound also claim that he is using anomalous life extension -- apparently feeding off a bagged and drugged (but still aware) human attached to the back of his wheelchair. [[[from-vagrants-to-gentlemen| This may or may not be a lurid rumor.]]]

[[[mc-d-agent-orientation| Reports on Dark fall into three categories]]]. The first category presents Dark as being a role filled by multiple people (of all genders, but possibly originally and currently male) over the last few centuries. The second category presents Dark as a single semi-immortal sapient entity, humanoid in nature if not always in form, able to change bodies and gender to suit current purposes. A third category presents both as true. 

It seems that Marshall and Carter do not themselves fully understand Dark either, and while they handle most operations, Dark has more ultimate control over MC&D than they do. [[[a-question-of-commerce| Regardless, it is certain that Dark predates Marshall and Carter significantly]]].

Curiously, it seems that Dark may be less malevolent than MC&D itself -- whoever they are, their morality seems highly situational, though they are extremely capable of monstrous acts above and beyond the capabilities of their organization.

**"Nobody":** An [[[a-poem-for-nobody| individual]]] who [[[nobody-knows| appears]]] to be under anomalous effects partially [[[nobody-dies| stripping]]] them of their identity in exchange for anomalous ability. May or may not be multiple people [[[note-a-part-of-nobody| (but only one at a time)]]].  Usually reported as an unidentifiable European man [[[happy-birthday-from-nobody| dressed]]] in a grey suit and fedora (with the notable exception of an equally [[[they-call-him-he-who-cannot-see-his-reflection| unidentifiable]]] woman in a grey suit, fedora, and purple tie). For more information on Nobody, see the [[[nobody-hub|GOI entry]]].

[[collapsible show="Nobody knows." hide="Nobody's here."]]

No one in the Foundation seems to know if Nobody is working [[[killing-knowledge| for or against]]] the Foundation; if reports are to be believed, the answer is "both". However, many doubt 'his' [[[library-lifeline| existence]]]. It is almost certain that many incidents associated with "Nobody" actually had nothing to do with that figure.

**Kenneth Spencer & Robin Thorne:** A pair of UIU agents assigned to [[[three-portlands-hub| Three Portlands]]]. Both agents and [[[unusual-investigations| their investigations]]] are of continuing interest to the Foundation. They have collaborated with the Foundation on [[[permanent-waves| several occasions]]], including playing an instrumental role in [[[the-blackbird-and-the-falcon| the joint Foundation/UIU raid]]] of Anderson Robotics World Headquarters. Additionally, both agents are members of Joint Task Force Delta-3 ("Organic Free Trade"), with Agent Spencer assuming command of the task force during operations in Three Portlands.
 
Agent Thorne is a natural thaumaturge of moderate ability with extensive occult training; Agent Spencer is believed to be non-anomalous, but has significant experience in paranormal affairs. Both agents make extensive use of paratechnology and occult devices in the field, employing a number of custom items in addition to their standard issue UIU equipment. They should both be considered roughly equal to a Foundation agent in terms of capability and effectiveness.

Supposedly he has died, but this information is conflicting as well. His remains were found at Site-███ following the [[[SCP-1504| activation of its onsite nuclear device]]]. But he was also confirmed to have been executed due to his role in [[[SCP-3002|starting an MK-Class Scenario]]]. Additionally, the body of a researcher from early in the Foundation's history shares the name and DNA of modern records of Loyd. Little else is currently known about this figure.

**General ██████ Bowe, ████:** More than anyone, the man who represents the old sins of the Foundation. Promoted after the death of his father, General Stan Bowe, by the effects of [[[SCP-935]]]. As his father's protege, he was assigned as the head of the Bowe Commission, which began for murky still-classified reasons and expanded in scope under the younger Bowe, ending with a nearly sole focus on weaponizing SCP objects before its dissolution. Has since left the Foundation.

[[collapsible show="ACCesDend" hide="dsdffdsfvd"]]
Under the younger Bowe, the Bowe Commission shifted the Foundation's paramilitary focus from defense to offense. The Bowe Commission was responsible for the creation of "Project Able" and Mobile Task Force Omega-7 ("Pandora's Box"), given permission for the project after a number of successful operations against several dangerous groups of interest. Bowe was personally responsible for much of the worst excesses of the project; he allowed [[[SCP-076]]]-2 to take a leadership role and have say in which SCP items were allowed to join, and he personally ordered the project to continue after an incident in which 076-2 killed a number of researchers. When 076-2 disabled its restraints and slaughtered most of the other Mobile Task Force members and caused the destruction of Containment Area-25, Bowe was assigned primary blame. MTF Omega-7 was dissolved, as was the Bowe Commission. As a result of this, and the [[[SCP-935]]] incidents, Much of the Foundation's paramilitary arm was censured or defected after this, and many of the Bowe Commission's supporters defected to the Chaos Insurgency or the Global Occult Coalition.

**Dr. Kondraki:** Former Site Director of Site-17. Extremely controversial figure who vanished from the Foundation some time ago. Ambitious, artistic, chaotic, paranoid, anti-social, spiteful; seen by many as an archetypal anti-hero.

Extensively researched SCP weaponization for now-shuttered programs. Likely gone on the run from the Foundation. Possibly dead. May have been executed by O5 order by Dr. Gears.

We are even still uncertain if Talloran is James Martin or [[[let-us-get-murdered|Jessie Ari]]]. they are a blur, a toughness unmatched by even the best of us, an enigma and a fighter. They cannot and will always die in the dark, surrounded by light.

[[tab O5 Command and The Administrator]]

**O5 Command:** 13 people who have ultimate control over the Foundation. Unusual personalities with way too much power. They do not and cannot come into contact with any anomalous entities. Mostly everyone is afraid of them. They know absolutely everything there is to know about the Foundation and its activities. They rarely intervene in the containment of SCPs... except when they do. They have their own Mobile Task Force, the Red Right Hand. O5 Command are the masters of the Foundation, and not everyone know they exist.

[[collapsible show="Nothing is certain." hide="Especially not us. God no."]]

...//Maybe.// Maybe there are 13, maybe they are people. They're not //supposed// to come into contact with anomalous entities, but in secret, sometimes they do. Who are they? Where did they come from? What secret goals are they striving towards? Either way, O5 Command is the cornerstone of the Foundation. At the very least, they have the Foundation's best interests at heart... Maybe.

**"The Administrator":** Figure of little-known nature playing a role best understood by O5 Command. Possibly anomalous, possibly multiple people. Once represented the Foundation in meetings with major world government figures; has since relinquished this role.

[[collapsible show="Why?" hide="Maybe you're asking the wrong questions."]]

It's an open secret amongst the upper echelons of the Foundation that  "The Administrator" (as popularly known) never at any point existed, but was a clever fiction created by another person or persons (or... something else) within the Foundation for the purposes of unifying of a fractious organization. As for what should be made of that, no one agrees.
