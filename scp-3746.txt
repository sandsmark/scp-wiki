**Item #:** SCP-3746

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** All affected subjects are to be given Class-C amnestics and employed at Foundation front companies for further analysis. Should they attempt to contact their family, a higher level of amnestic therapy is to be administered and the subject is to placed under Foundation psychiatric care.

**Description:**  SCP-3746 is a phenomenon affecting adult male humans residing within the continental United States who are living with their maternal parent.

Affected subjects will perceive their mother as deceased upon waking up. There is no known specific trigger for SCP-3746's effect, although a statistically significant portion of affected subjects have reported experiencing night terrors, erotic, lucid or other extreme dream states prior to SCP-3746’s manifestation.

There is no known pattern in the causes of the deaths perceived by those affected by SCP-3746; most frequently it is natural causes. Whilst the subject cannot perceive their mother as alive and will not respond to their stimuli, they will react to objects moved by their mothers once said object has been stationary and left their line of sight before being viewed again. --No corresponding effect has been found to affect any mother.--

If the affected subject's mother remains stationary long enough to leave and return to the affected subjects line of sight the affected subject will perceive a fresh corpse and attempt to bury them immediately. Subjects will frequently fail to utilize obvious tools in favor of their hands. This behavior will only cease if the two are separated, if the mother perishes, or if the attempt is successful.

SCP-3746 was initially discovered after Foundation I/Os picked up on imageboards popular in the United States which had postings about the phenomenon. As of 2017/05/05, 67 cases have been documented and contained by the Foundation.

**Case 29:** On 2017/04/02, Benjamin Miller phoned 911 after claiming to have found his 68-year-old mother collapsed and bleeding in their home. A transcript of the 911 call is attached.

**Addendum 3746.1:** It has been discovered that in approximately 4% of cases, affected individuals will instead perceive their mother as dying and will attempt to provide first aid. These attempts consistently end in the death of the mother.

Whether this is intentional or not is unknown.
