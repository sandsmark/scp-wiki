In front of Nic stood a house, cold and hollow. A layer of dirt and dust blocked the little light within the windows. Debris spread across the porch and the stench of rot rose from the garden.

Nic's hand lifted up the knocker before letting slamming onto the door. Yowls arose from within Nic’s jacket and out climbed out the cat onto his shoulders while he let the knocker drop again. A light went off on in one of the lower floors rooms before more began to appear. Footsteps approached the door and a series of clicks played. 

Out swung the door and the inside light spread across the porch. 

“Nic!” Arms wrapped around Nic and squeezed tightly before a volley of yowls launched out of Tiger. 

“Awwww poor Tiger. Has your owner forgotten to pet you?”

“Psh no, he’s just an ass who can never have enough,”

“Aww you poor wittle guy, is your owner an asshole who doesn’t give you enough pets?” Inside her arms, Tiger curled up letting out a mighty purr.

“Oh, of course, he likes you,”

Ari’s giggles filled the sky before guiding Nic inside. The house reeked of rot and death. Floorboards creaked as they walked along. Books, that at one point sat lined up on the shelf, were now strewn across the room with dog-eared and ripped pages. 

At last, they entered the kitchen where pancakes laid on plates already made.

“Thought you said you teach me?” Nic questioned

“You were too late so I made em myself,” she replied. It was only ten minutes... maybe she just needed something to do.

“Oh, maybe later could you teach me?”

“Course.”

Nic, halfway through his breakfast feast glanced up and saw Ari's glassy eyes and redish nose.

"Ari?" He said. She looked up and about as if she had been pulled away from space, before giving a weak smile.

"Yeah,"

"You okay?"

"I mean, I'm going." The words were followed by a series of half-hearted chuckles

"Ari, I'm sorry."

"It's okay Nic, it isn't your fault."

"I just want you to not be in this slump. I mean look around you. There's books everywhere, your house is a mess, and you just have been doing nothing. I get it, she was important to you. But, you can't live like this forever." 

Ari stopped and thought before shaking her head and taking a sip of tea.

"That mess, on the porch, I was working on the garden, and the books I was reorganizing. I'll get to it  cleaning it soon."

"I can help with that if you would want me to,"

"Nah, I'm all good." 

"You sure?"

"Of course Nic,"

Nic shrugged his shoulder, it would take her some time to heal from her dog's death. Later on, in the pancake feast, he excused himself for a bathroom break. He walked down the never-ending hallway when he paused, noticing the small unmistakeable figure, that was Tiger. Within its mouth was a strange little thing dangling and dripping off sludge. Walking closer Nic could better see the outlines of the elaborate fur matted up into a ball. Bending his knees he reached out toward his cat extending his hand out making quick clicks with his tongue. 

Slowly Tiger approached him. Watching Nic with fierce eyes. Nic shot back horrified as to what was dangling within his mouth. Nic backed into wall staring towards his cat.

"What the fuck?" the words spilled from his mouth as he noticed a small figure behind his cat. Perched watching him with rotting eyes. Its jaw tumbled from off the top of the bed slamming into the floor with a slop. His feet stumbled back and the stench of rot and death filled his body and mind. It laid watching him with a lifeless socket and a tar-filled pit.

The door slid open slowly mocking the little strength Ari had left. Hollowness flowed within her body and into the tips of her fingers leaving everything cold. She stumbled forward off of the steps and into the grass. A deep breath in then out as her body jerked toward the shed in a puppet like fashion. The door opened with little resistance and the shovel fell off of its hook with a clank. It settled on her shoulder with almost no weight. 

Step by step. She moved out of the shed.

Step by step. She moved across the yard

Step by step. She approached a patch of young grass.

A Pause. 

The shovel swang off her shoulder and into the ground, impaling it with a single strike. The dirt flew and onto the flower patch. Soon enough the yard was covered in brown and grey. The shovel fell from her hands and kneeled down before stretching out them and stroking Pinto’s still soft patch of fur. Pinto’s head moved up and her socket met her owner's eye. She wanted to be with Ari... and Ari wished to be with her. Hands reached down and picked Pinto up. Black sludge poured from the grave as Ari brought her close. Snapping and sloshing filled their ears as the body slowly slipped away from the little, fluffy face. The corners of Aris' mouth stretched upright and coos left her lips,

“You’re a good dog. Yes, you are.” Pinto’s head tilted back and diamond-like eyes watched Ari with joy. 

Black liquid splattered across the hole and a headless body lay still. Ari watched her dog with pride and joy before taking her inside. There she laid dog onto her bed; in Pinto’s favorite sleeping spot so she could get some rest after having played outside this entire time.

Ari watched her dog with adoring eyes when her stomach began to growl. Time for breakfast.
