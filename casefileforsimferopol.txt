{{On Thurs. 18 March, unidentified forces approached the Ukrainian Army 13th Photogrammatry Center and SITE-991 at approx 15:00 local time in two (2) unmarked URAL-4320 trucks flying Russian Federation flags. Fifteen (15) masked gunmen disembarked from the vehicles and approached the gate to the facility, demanding entrance. Ukrainian servicemen denied the gunmen entrance to the compound and demanded identification.}}

{{The gunmen identified themselves as self-defense forces of the Republic of Crimea and demanded full surrender of the base and the persons therein. The Ukrainian servicemen again declined to admit the individuals into the compound; both parties, respectively, assumed threatening postures.}}

{{███████, ██████, self-defense militiaman, began scaling the perimeter fence. Ukrainian servicemen stated and re-iterated that trespassers on military premises would be shot. ███████ continued to scale the fence. █████, ████████, stationed on a watchtower overlooking the fence, opened fire with an automatic rifle, to fatal injury. █████ was then shot (also fatally).}}

{{Both parties began to allege the responsibility of the other for the incident. Ukrainian servicemen -- while monitoring the militiamen closely -- withdrew, barricading themselves within the installation. The militiamen scaled the fence, opened the gate, and took up firing positions in the construction site opposite the installation.}}

{{AGENTS ██████, ███, & ████████, having heard gunfire, proceeded to contact FOUNDATION OPERATIONAL CONTROL EASTERN EUROPE (FOCEE) via phone-line, and, under FOCEE recommendation, quit SITE-991 and began negotiations with the militiamen. Identifying themselves as Ukrainian servicemen (in accordance with Foundation security protocol), the respective agents surrendered their sidearms and granted the militamen access to SITE-991. The agents stressed de-escalation.}}
