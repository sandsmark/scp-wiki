Leaving the snow marked.
A trail for them to follow. 
I tripped to the ground.

Sigils of defeat.
I’m laying in my own blood.
Waiting for rescue. 

If only they came.
I no longer feel my legs.
A flow of crimson.

The shifting of leaves.
Movement in the frozen trees.
Sharp claws on cold wood.

Raising a firearm.
Dazed from the previous wounds.
Trying to keep still.

Spotting more movement
Ignition of gunpowder.
Several loud shots.






Shame, none hit their mark.
A young girl walked into view.
Wrapped in a fur coat.

Eyes, glowing bright green.
A command to drop the gun.
Instant compliance.

A smile, cold as ice.
Her eyes an emerald sheen.
She was my new friend.

The blink of an eye.
More crimson flows, stained the snow.
Turning pink by now.

Upon arrival.
Witness to a frozen corpse.
Its liver missing.

Bloody prints, a trail.
Into the forest, they go.
