# **Ouroboric Mozarella Stick** -- A single battered and deep fried stick of creamy buffalo mozarella.  Once tasted the cheese will not stop flowing.  Literally.  Served with a side of marinara sauce.
# **Beetlemania** -- Served with a red wine tomato sauce, the juiciest specimens are harvested from between the scaled plates of adolescent drakes.  Crunchy and toothsome, you will crave a dragon's horde of these little buggers.
# **Just-Like-Mom's Duck Onigiri** -- Flavorful rice surrounding succulent duck braised in a spiced thaumaturgical wine.  This dish will transport you back to your fondest childhood memories and still have you back in time for the main course.  Tied together with temporally anchored nori.

# **Cioppino** -- Our signature dish.  This flavorful blend all completes a world tour in a classic Italian style.  Featuring Mediterranean gorgon,  Cyprian eel, Trojan mussels, and giant calamari from the foot of the Symplegades.  As is our policy, if you can subdue this dish yourself, it's on the house!
# **Veal You** -- Freshly harvested from you thirty minutes ago, this hearty dish is pounded thin, battered, and lightly fried to perfection.  Served with a white wine lemon-caper sauce and a side of fettuccine.  Consuming this dish is a net caloric zero.
# **Eight Senses Linguine, Redux** -- A total sensory experience and beyond.  Words, thoughts, sights, sounds will become impossible as your consciousness rises to the level necessary to comprehend this dish.  Patrons ordering this dish are not recommended to operate heavy machinery for 4-6 hours after consumption.

# **Coconuts On The Mind** -- Harvested from the dreams of a long-dead sea dragon, these rich and creamy eggs are conceptually identical to coconut gelee.  Your mouth won't be able to tell the difference!
# **Cold Pot** -- Harvested from the deepest and furthest reaches of space, this fruity foam checks in at slightly above absolute zero.  Served with a compote of raspberry, blueberry, and pomegranate your tastebuds will savor the essence of the cosmos.  Please let your server know if as early as possible if you intend to order this dish.

> I was transported back to my mum's kitchen in the house we grew up.  I could smell the freshly baked bread, practically taste cobbler she used to make for me.  I hugged her, told her how much I miss her and love her.  It's been so hard since we lost her but there she was, right in front of me.
