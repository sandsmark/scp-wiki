**Special Containment Procedures:**
SCP-5731 is kept in Containment Locker 56 at Site 64 when not being tested. Request to gain access to the item is to be submitted to Dr. Green.

**Description:**
SCP-5731 is a square music box which is 6 cm in length, 5 cm in width, and 3 cm in height. Its top is made from clear plastic, allowing the interior to be viewed. When its anomaly is not in effect, it plays a rendition of “Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah” when cranked. When in the vicinity of a non-sapient biological entity, its anomalous effect is triggered. If cranked nearby one of these entities, SCP-5731 will instead play English human speech. This is believed to be the broadcasting or “translation” of the non-sapient entity’s thoughts. The voice from the music box is always that of a young female, despite the sex of the effected entity. Tests discovered wildly varying personalities in the music box between test subjects used. It is not believed the female voice is its own consciousness, rather a projection of the ones surrounding it.

**Discovery:**
SCP-5731 was purchased by Researcher Pret’s wife from a yard sale at some point during the summer of 2013. Researcher Pret was not aware of SCP-5731’s effects until 8/17/2018 when his daughter wound it in proximity to the family cat, which triggered SCP-5731’s effects. Researcher Pret surrendered the object to the Foundation for testing.

**Testing:**

[[collapsible show="+Tests" hide="- Access granted"]]
**Testing is currently overseen by Dr. Green. She is to be contacted for further testing logs.**

||= **Test** ||= **Subject** ||= **Result**||
||= #1 ||= Researcher Pret's cat "Missy" ||= SCP-5731 complained of being "too cold". A blanket was provided to the cat, and the complaints ceased.||
||= #4 ||= D-8113 ||= SCP-5731 played "Zip-a-Dee-Do-Dah."||
||= #13 ||= SCP-███ ||= SCP-5731 played "Zip-a-Dee-Do-Dah." SCP-5731 has not had any other results for any sapient entity, anomalous or not.||
||= #24 ||= Dr. Reed's dog "Duke"||= SCP-5731 remarked how "funny this place smells".||
||= #39 ||= A raccoon retrieved from the forest surrounding Site 64 ||= SCP-5731 cursed something called the "tall things" repeatedly.||
||= #53 ||= A female orangutan "Peaches"||= See log below||
||= #65 ||= [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-529|SCP-529]]] ||= SCP-5731 requested cheese. The request was denied.||
||= #101 ||= [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-096|SCP-096]]] ||= During SCP-096's calm state, SCP-5731 repeated the phrases "so sad" and "ugly, ugly". Permission denied to deliberately trigger SCP-096 for testing purposes. **Addendum  07/ 23/2020 :** During an unrelated termination attempt, 096 was triggered and its thoughts transcribed through SCP-5731. It recited complicated equations of aerodynamics and physics. These are thought to be SCP-096 'calculating' how best to reach its target.||
||= #106 ||= [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2845|SCP-2845]]] ||= The music box played "Zip-a-Dee-Do-Dah", suggesting that SCP-2845 is sapient and has not been able or willing to speak to date.||

Normally being with humans is so much fun, but not today, not today. Do you hear the words I’m thinking? Well, listen to these words: Put that thing back in the place you found it!

> **Interviewed: Judy T████**

> **<Begin interview log>**
> 
> **Interviewer:** Good evening, Judy. I have a couple of questions for you.
> 
> **Judy T████:** About the music box, I bet.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Yes, of course. How did it come into your possession?
> 
> **Judy:** If I answer the questions you’ll give it back to me, right?
> 
> **Interviewer:** Certainly.
> 
> **Judy:** Alright, I got it as a gift when I was little. From my aunt.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Do you know where she got it?
> 
> **Judy:** No.
> 
> **Interviewer**: What’s her name?
> 
> **Judy:** What, are you gonna go after her family too? I already know you’re mad enough at me for knowing about… all this… the weird stuff out there.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Tell us her name, please.
> 
> **Judy:** Ugh, it’s █████ ██████. But don’t bother. She’s been dead for 6 years now.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Thank you. How did you find out about “all this”?
> 
> **Judy:** Well, it started with the music box. One thing kinda led to another and… I guess I just never stopped believing in magic as a kid, you know?
> 
> **Interviewer:** And about the Foundation?
> 
> **Judy:** Came across it in my search for the music box.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Could you elaborate?
> 
> **Judy:** How do I elaborate? I don’t remember exactly when I found out about it. At that point I’d already known about the supernatural stuff for years, so a place that collects that stuff ain’t so hard to imagine. And I figured a place that collects magic stuff might have ‘collected’ something that was mine.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Hm, what was your aunt like, then? Do you know if she was aware of the anomalous?
> 
> **Judy:** She definitely knew what the music box could do. That’s why she gave it to me. My best friend even back then was Sparky, and I really wanted nothing more than to talk to him. I don’t know what else she knew about anomalies. What, do you think she was a witch?
> 
> **Interviewer:** Ha, well that’s not entirely out of the realm of possibility. How exactly did you lose the music box?
> 
> **Judy:** I didn’t lose it. It got sold at a yard sale. I like to think that it accidentally got swept up with the other things that were getting sold, but my mom may have just gotten rid of it on purpose.
> 
> **Interviewer**: Your mother was aware of it, then?
> 
> **Judy:** Yeah. She didn’t like the music box //or// my aunt. She wasn’t real fond of magic, and she always said that I needed to make actual friends, cause a dog wasn’t good enough or something.
> 
> **Interviewer:** I see. Do you have any more information?
> 
> **Judy:** Nah. Can I have the music box back now?
> 
> **Interviewer:** I’ll see what I can do.
> 
> **Judy:** Hey now, you just said ‘Certainly’ at the beginning of our chat, and now it’s ‘I’ll see what I can do’?
> 
> **Interviewer:** I will try my be-
> 
> **Judy:** No! //No,// that’s not good enough.
> 
> //Judy stands up from her seat.//
> 
> **Judy:** //Swear// to me you’ll get it back.
> 
> **Interviewer:** I d-
> 
> **Judy:** Do it! Please... [//Judy's voice falters//]
> 
> **Interviewer:** Please remain calm, Judy.
> 
> **Judy:** That thing is mine, and I’m running out of time. Swear you’ll give it back.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Cross my heart! Please Judy, sit back down.
> 
> //Judy sits and breathes deeply.//
> 
> **Judy:** Stand by your word, or I’ll be back on your doorstep tomorrow- I swear it.
> 
> **<End Interview Log>**

> **Closing statement**: Judy T████ provided no further useful information. She received amnestics to remove all memory of SCP-5731 and the Foundation, and was released from Foundation custody.

##white| Why didn't they let her say goodbye? What is one person on the outside knowing about us? No no, amnestize everything away. She remembers nothing about her best friend. To her, he was nothing but a dog. Why? Because we're the Foundation, and //we're cold.//##
