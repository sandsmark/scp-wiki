**Item #:**  SCP-249

**Object Class:**  Euclid

**Special Containment Procedure:**  SCP-249 is affixed to a wall within Site-██. Access to this SCP is unrestricted, though an accurate log of destinations must be kept and submitted to a level 4 supervisor every four (4) weeks. No dangerous or keter class SCPs may be kept within one thousand (1000) yards of SCP-249.

**Description:**  SCP-249 appears to be a windowless door, covered in a faded white paint. It was first found in a house located within the small town of ██████. When opened, SCP-249 does not lead to the other side of the doorway, but to any random door within eight hundred and fifty (850) yards. Going through SCP-249 will teleport anything to that door, regardless of what may be between the door and SCP-249. When seen from the opposite side of exit door, it appears to open on its own accord, and whomever went through SCP-249 appears in thin air. When opened, SCP-249 takes on the appearance of the door it is connected to. When shut, SCP-249 is no longer connected to that door, and connects to another random one.

However, roughly every five hundred (500) uses, SCP-249 does not connect to a door within its range, but teleports to a random location. Where it leads to is not another door, but anywhere in the world. There are cases where it has lead to areas where there are not doors-or buildings- within thousands of miles. When the 500-use mark approaches, common use of this SCP is stopped and tests are done to record its exit location. Since it's discovery, a log has been kept documenting these cases (See Addendum 249-001).

**Document 249-A**
In accordance to 05-██, all restrooms have been moved away from SCP-249s range.
