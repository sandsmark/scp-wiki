**Item #:** SCP-1401-EX

**Object Class:** --Pending-- Explained

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1401-EX instances are to be kept on file at Site-19 and are available on request.  Investigations into the whereabouts of PoI-6922 is currently ongoing within the state of Illinois.

**Description:** SCP-1401-EX is the collective designation for a group of 22 printed images. These images were previously found printed and stapled onto telephone poles around Illinois, USA. SCP-1401-EX instances take the form of a warning poster, informing the viewer as to various health problems that could result in a miscarriage. The stylization of these posters is similar to numerous internet memes and have their information organized to form various shapes and figures. These stylizations are consistent throughout instances, and consist of the following:
* Information organized into a single figure near the top left section of the poster
* Information organized into two figures in the top right section of the poster, with the rightmost character being significantly shorter than the leftmost
* Information organized into two figures in the bottom left section of the poster, with both figures being of equal height
* Information organized into two figures in the bottom right section of the poster, with the rightmost figure being rotated 90° to lie laterally 

The exact reason for this method of information organization is currently unknown. 

**History:** SCP-1401-EX was first reported on 07/03/2020 when instances of SCP-1401-EX were discovered within local hospitals. An embedded Agent was able to interview a number of hospital employees, all of which showed no prior knowledge of the posters. MTF Eta-10 (“See No Evil”) was deployed to contain the anomaly, which was originally thought to be cognitohazardous. Nine instances were discovered and were given to the Site-19 cognitohazardous research facility. After extensive testing, it was determined that SCP-1401-EX possessed no anomalous properties. 

During post recovery analysis, SCP-1401-EX was mentioned in several chat rooms associated with GoI-5869 (“Gamers Against Weed”). The following are chat logs discussing SCP-1401-EX’s initial distribution.
