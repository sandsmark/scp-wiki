**Item #:** SCP-2256

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Information about SCP-2256 is subject to a gradual antimemetic corrosion effect. Corrosion occurs at differing rates depending on the level of detail/accuracy in the information and the physical complexity of the storage medium. In-depth academic papers, photographs, and information stored electronically decay rapidly; broad descriptions, pencil sketches and paperwork decay slowly.

Therefore, this electronic database entry should describe SCP-2256 only in broad terms. Detailed information about SCP-2256's appearance, theorised evolutionary ancestry, biology, diet, behaviour, vocalisations, lifecycle, intelligence, ecological role and cultural significance should be stored in hard copy at Site 19, vault 1-053. The rate of corrosion in both data sources should be monitored carefully, although at present no technique is known for halting or undoing such corrosion.

Although these antimemetic effects linger and rate Euclid classification, SCP-2256 itself is extinct and requires no special containment procedures.

**Description:** SCP-2256 (//Cryptomorpha gigantes//) is a species of gigafauna which was endemic to the South Pacific Ocean around the islands of Polynesia. SCP-2256 was one of the very few recorded species known to have developed rudimentary perceptual/"antimemetic" camouflage, rendering them nearly impossible for other sentient beings to perceive or remember. It is commonly agreed that this adaptation arose in order to elude predators.

SCP-2256 was by several orders of magnitude the largest species ever to have lived on Earth. Resembling spindly, vertically elongated giraffes or brachiosaurs, adults of the species grew to more than 1,000 metres in height. They weighed no more than 4 tonnes, with most of their mass being "camouflaged" by a very similar adaptation. With their broad, dish-shaped feet, they were able to walk directly on the surface of the ocean without sinking.

SCP-2256 roamed the ocean on foot alone ██ in groups of 2 to as many as 2,000 individuals. They were reluctant to approach land, especially inhabited islands, usually staying more than 30 kilometres offshore. Thanks to their enormous height, they were still clearly visible on the horizon at this distance.

**Acquisition:** Polynesian natives of the island of Maikiti used a substance called //teùkoka// for recreational and religious purposes. As well as being a moderate psychedelic, this drug had amnestic properties, suppressing antimemetic effects and making entities camouflaged in this way easier to see and remember. Thus, the Maikitians were for hundreds of years the only people able to see SCP-2256. They believed SCP-2256 to be wandering spirits whom the gods had charged with maintaining the horizon, to ensure that the sky and the water never mixed. They believed SCP-2256 were well-meaning and friendly, but unintelligent and often deficient in their duties, resulting in storms and typhoons. They called SCP-2256 //polo'ongakau//, "the ones who walk very slowly".

In 1991 an internal biochemistry study revealed that //teùkoka// bore a strong chemical resemblance to the Foundation's own class-W amnestic. A Foundation anthropologist was assigned to follow up ██ the Maikitian legend, and became the first outsider to observe ███-2256. An observation ██████ was quickly ███████████ on the island to study the creatures. Routine containment analysis found that SCP-2256 was Safe and required no special containment procedures, or even particular attention ██ secrecy.

**History:** SCP-████ immediately proved to be impossible to capture photographically. Photographic negatives of the species faded into transparency over the ██████ ██ a few minutes. Similar decay ███████ affected videotape, audio tape, celluloid film, digital and electronic scans, //███.//. The observation team soon returned most of their equipment to inventory and proceeded using pencils and █████. At the time, it ███ believed that such recordings would be effectively permanent.

SCP-2256's population declined slightly in 1992 and 1993, then dropped sharply from 1994 onwards. A combination of contributing factors were observed: illness, infertility and an ██████████ rate of stillbirths.

In 2002 a field generator was developed which could penetrate and neutralise SCP-2256's antimemetic ██████████, allowing for conventional photography. The first and only close-up photograph of one of the creatures instantly killed it. It was swiftly concluded that direct observation of SCP-2256 is injurious to ████. This adaptation is believed to have arisen as a means of detecting predators, just as SCP-2256's antimemetic camouflage protected them from those same predators. Use of ███ █████ generator was immediately curtailed.

It was subsequently hypothesised that the even the Foundation's ongoing passive observation of the species was intense enough to have harmful effects on SCP-2256, and that ████ was what was driving the species ████ extinction. Opinions differed sharply over the ████████ of this hypothesis, ████ how thoroughly it should be tested, and over what should be ████ if it proved to be true. Several ███████ options were ██████████, including ██████████ exterminating SCP-████ to preserve the data, and completely expunging the data to preserve ███-2256. No firm conclusions were █████.

In 2003 the SCP-2256 observation program was scaled back significantly, and the ██████████ switched █████ from █████████ new data to analysing ████████ data. However, SCP-2256's population continued to ███████. The last individual died near Tokelau ██ October 30, 2006.

In 2010 it was discovered ████ the antimemetic camouflage ██████, also characterised as "decay" or "corrosion", was spreading through paper records of ███-████. As ██ ████, ████ ████ 60% of █████ documents are ██████████, even with a strong mnestic dose. The effect is even reaching into ████ SCP entry itself, despite all the shielding and redundancy in ████ ██████.

Since SCP-████ ██ extinct, ██ ███ data █████ it can be generated. It is █████████ that ████ contamination ████ █████ ██████ three to eight years.
