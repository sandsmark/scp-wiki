**Item #:** SCP-2096

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2096 is to be held in an MSHA[[footnote]]Medical, Standard, Humanoid, Active[[/footnote]] containment cell at Area 26. Following Event 08/29/2001-2, the subject has remained in a comatose state. A minimum of one Medical Department personnel and one Research Department personnel are to monitor SCP-2096 at all times. In the event of SCP-2096 regaining consciousness, Containment Subterfuge Protocol 002 ("Conventional Medical Facility") is to be initiated until current containment protocols are reestablished.

To maintain containment in the case of an SCP-2096 event, autonomous redundancy protocols have been put into effect. Personnel monitoring the subject are required to send messages to personnel at Site 19 no less frequently than three times an hour. If no messages are received for thirty minutes, automated lockdown of Area 26 will initiate. Because of the potential variance in duration for an SCP-2096 event, this lockdown will be maintained until reestablishment of containment protocols has been verified.

**Special Containment Procedures //(05/28/2001 - 08/30/2001)//:** SCP-2096 is to be held in an MSHA containment cell at Area 26. Containment Subterfuge Protocol 002 ("Conventional Medical Facility") is to be maintained. A minimum of two Medical Department personnel are to monitor SCP-2096 at all times. If warning signs for an SCP-2096 event begin to manifest, immediate sedation of the subject is to be enacted.

--Requests made by SCP-2096 are to be forwarded to Provisional Committee 2096 for review.-- Due to increasing disorientation and frequent paraphasia, requests made by SCP-2096 are no longer being taken under consideration.

**Description:** SCP-2096 is a Caucasian female, eighty-one years of age. The subject, given name █████ ███████, is within average parameters of physical health for an individual of their age. SCP-2096 has been designated a Class 3U reality bender.[[footnote]]Subtype designation 'U' is the classification for reality benders whose facets are considered to be Uncontrolled or Unintentional; see //Reality Benders: Classifications and Presumed Threat Levels// for an unabridged definition of this classification.[[/footnote]] SCP-2096 events are triggered by the subject's level of emotional distress and increase in intensity in proportion to the same vector.

According to medical records acquired from the family of SCP-2096 upon containment, the subject began to present symptoms of Alzheimer's disease in August of 1998. These symptoms were first documented following hospitalization for injuries suffered after a fall in the home; the accident has since been theorized to be an acute representation of the onset of truncal ataxia. Formal diagnosis of Alzheimer's was made in December of 1998 following continued symptomatic behaviors. Prior to the onset of Alzheimer's in SCP-2096, no anomalous events had been recorded by the family or any medical institution. It is as of yet unclear whether the subject's facets as a reality bender had been latent prior to neurological degeneration or if all SCP-2096 events prior to the condition were comprehensive enough in their reality restructuring as to leave no evidence of previous consensus realities.[[footnote]]Theories on the latter scenario suggest a reclassification of SCP-2096 to either Class 4 or Class 5. A review of subtypes is ongoing to determine an accurate designation for reality benders whose facets have been altered by physical or mental illness.[[/footnote]] 

Recorded SCP-2096 events have to date always been preceded by the subject experiencing cognitive or physical impairment attributable to their dementia. When the subject is faced with a situation where their cognitive or physical functions are noticeably diminished, the ensuing temporary reality restructuring event[[footnote]]Durations of such events have been recorded to last between three seconds (with sedation of SCP-2096 ceasing the effects) and approximately seven hours (with gradual relief of emotional distress being causal for cessation).[[/footnote]] alters the cognitive functions of individuals within the effect vicinity[[footnote]]Measured radially. Effect vicinity scales with severity of SCP-2096's distress; a baseline of 2m has been observed for all events. The largest effect vicinity recorded to date was approximately 1.2 km; refer to the //SCP-2096 Event Log//, Event 08/29/2001-2.[[/footnote]] to replicate the impairments being experienced by SCP-2096. Most often this results in individuals involuntarily undergoing analogues to SCP-2096's current memory loss; common examples have included confusion regarding their current location, the inability to identify others on sight, and the inability to remember the procedures for fine motor skill activities.

**Discovery:** SCP-2096 was voluntarily remanded into Foundation custody by family members on 5/27/2001 following a temporary reality restructuring event which resulted in a multi-vehicle accident and the hospitalization of the subject and several others. Foundation liaisons in place at the medical facility were alerted to the potentially anomalous nature of the subject by familial testimony of prior events. 

**Addendum 08/31/2001:** Following Event 08/29/2001-2, the Palmer Protocol[[footnote]]The Palmer Protocol permits the incapacitation of humanoid subjects by one of several unconventional, non-fatal methods as a temporary containment procedure. The Palmer Protocol is most commonly invoked during the initial containment phase of new subjects to allow for easier transport and placement in permanent containment facilities. For a more thorough understanding of the permitted durations and an unabridged list of approved methods under this designation, refer to //The Palmer Protocol: Primary and Secondary Functions//.[[/footnote]] has been invoked by approval of SCP-2096 Lead Researcher Emsworth. SCP-2096 has been chemically induced into a comatose state as of 08/30/2001. The duration of this containment protocol is, currently, unspecified; weekly evaluations of the subject's state of physical health and potential revisions to the primary containment procedures are scheduled. Details regarding Event 08/29/2001-2 have been restricted to Level 3 Security Clearance or higher by SCP-2096 Lead Researcher Emsworth. Reclassification of SCP-2096's Object Class to Neutralized is pending approval.

> **Personnel Note 09/07/2001:** //Notification of the filing of a formal complaint and appeal of the aforementioned casefile review. No evidence has been given to validate these "suspected violations," nor has the accuser stepped forward to reveal themselves. I see no reason for me or my team to be subjected to additional scrutiny on what's already a highly delicate and stressful assignment.//

> **Personnel Note 09/22/2001:** //Investigation into the management of SCP-2096 has been closed. The tribunal responsible for the review has determined that ethical improprieties were enacted during Event 08/29/2001-2 and the subsequent containment protocol revisions. While SCP-2096 may fairly be considered a problematic assignment, no evidence has been presented to validate the decision to invoke the Palmer Protocol. An unabridged version of the Ethics Committee report is available but I will say this here: We are the Foundation. We have dedicated our lives to three simple tenets being carried out in complex ways. We will fail, eventually; this is all but guaranteed. Until then, it's within our purview to respect the lives of all those within our realm of influence. It is our job to do what we can, not only for the population at large but also those individuals unfortunate enough to be designated for containment.//
