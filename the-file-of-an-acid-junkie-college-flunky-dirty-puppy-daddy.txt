Zachary (Maxwell to his friends) does a whole lot of nothing around here. However, he is a [https://medium.com/@leilamariebloom/end-of-life-plans-154c849b8a9b prize-winning writer] and [https://i.imgur.com/qmvguyt.jpg photographer] who is happy to devote as much time as he can helping people with their drafts. At the time of writing, don't expect the most prompt of responses.

When not critiquing or generally being awesome, he writes. Here are some things he wrote.

__[http://www.scp-wiki.net/kit-s-home-hub-of-happening The Kit Series]__

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/and-then-kit-slept And Then, Kit Slept.]

//[[size smaller]]'Wait. He hadn’t smoked in nearly five years. He had just flicked his vaporizer into the void. Fuck, not again.'[[/size]]//

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/kit-s-bloomin-adventure Kit's Bloomin' Adventure.]

//[[size smaller]]'"Lick my iliac crest," he found himself begging, his hands still digging into the spongy form that was the being.'[[/size]]//

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/kit-s-brotherhood Kit's Brotherhood.]

//[[size smaller]]'“We should close the window,”[[/size]]//

//[[size smaller]]“Why?”[[/size]]// 

//[[size smaller]]“Because I don’t want to jump out of it.”'[[/size]]//

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-duvet-queen The Duvet Queen.]

//[[size smaller]]'Faintly, he remembered writing something about someone, but, as always, had decided against posting it.'[[/size]]//

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/kit-s-horror-hospital-of-horror Kit's Horror Hospital of Horror.]

//[[size smaller]]'He was used to insane shit. But he was mainly used to dealing with that insane shit in person.'[[/size]]//

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/that-one-time-kit-tried-to-kill-himself That One Time Kit Tried to Kill Himself.]

//[[size smaller]]'Kit is never Knowingly Violent.'[[/size]]//

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/kit-s-fate Loskon in the Making.]

//[[size smaller]]'He thought of the amnestic in Kit's tea. He thought of the mission he was supposed to complete. He thought of the time Kit pretended to be dead. He thought that maybe he had done the right thing.'[[/size]]//

__The Kit Christmas Mini Saga__

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/kit-s-christmas-miracle-pt-1 One Kit and an (Anomalous) Baby Pt. 1]

//[[size smaller]]'Laying in the box, the baby's face went red, and she grunted, and a godawful smell flooded the air. Kit reflexively put his free hand over his nose, other arm cradling the box. "…Shit." He muttered. "…Literally."'[[/size]]//

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/one-kit-and-an-anomalous-baby-pt-2 One Kit and an (Anomalous) Baby Pt. 2]

//[[size smaller]]'Kit tasted a spoonful of the lumpy porridge, then instantly regretted it. "This stuff is disgusting, if you don't mind me saying."'[[/size]]//

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/one-kit-and-an-anomalous-baby-pt-3 One Kit and an (Anomalous) Baby - The Penultimate Chapter]

//[[size smaller]]''You went home to your own monster, love in your heart, and tried to tell him. Your monster called you a weirdo and a queer, and he clawed your face so hard that you were off school two days to hide the marks.''[[/size]]//

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/one-kit-and-an-anomalous-baby-the-finale One Kit and an (Anomalous) Baby - The Finale]

//[[size smaller]]'Something dark snapped within him. Something that came from his father. Something that he remembered well from his own childhood.'[[/size]]//


__Maxwell's Creepypasta One-Shots__

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/of-all-sad-words-of-tongue-or-pen-the-saddest-are-these-it-m It Might Have Been.]

//[[size smaller]]'Linked hand in hand, mother and child both knew as soon as they hit the threshold, Katie would disappear.'[[/size]]//

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/you-never-visit-anymore You Never Visit Me Anymore.]

//[[size smaller]]'Her grave was simple. “Memento Mori”, it said, because that’s all that could be read clearly on her arm in red Sharpie at the beauty spot.'[[/size]]//

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/two-ships-passing-in-the-night Two Ships, Passing in the Night.]

//[[size smaller]]'It was as if all the painful and joyous events had never happened. And no one needed the corpses of empty houses to remind them, so something bigger than nature dismissed the buildings as useless.'[[/size]]//

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-price-of-beauty The Price of Beauty.]

//[[size smaller]]'You can get everything rebuilt these days. Your tits, your arse, your face…'[[/size]]//

__What'cha Up To, Maxwell?__

He's not working on things right now. At least not in the public eye. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
