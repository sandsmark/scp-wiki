Zachary (Maxwell to his friends) does a whole lot of nothing around here. 

Here are some things he wrote.

__The Kit Series__

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/kit-s-home-hub-of-happening The Hub.]

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/and-then-kit-slept 'Wait. He hadn’t smoked in nearly five years. He had just flicked his vaporizer into the void. Fuck, not again.']

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/kit-s-bloomin-adventure '"Lick my iliac crest," he found himself begging, his hands still digging into the spongy form that was the being.']

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/kit-s-brotherhood '“We should close the window,” “Why?” “Because I don’t want to jump out of it.”']

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-duvet-queen 'Faintly, he remembered writing something about someone, but, as always, had decided against posting it.']

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/kit-s-horror-hospital-of-horror 'He was used to insane shit. But he was mainly used to dealing with that insane shit in person.']

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/that-one-time-kit-tried-to-kill-himself 'Kit is never Knowingly Violent.']

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/kit-s-fate 'He thought of the amnestic in Kit's tea. He thought of the mission he was supposed to complete. He thought of the time Kit pretended to be dead. He thought that maybe he had done the right thing.']


__Maxwell's Creepypasta One-Shots__


__Other Things Maxwell Has Given Minimal Input To___

Sometimes, he writes --bizarre-- fantastic, --weird-- arousing [http://www.scp-wiki.net/kit-s-bloomin-adventure Eldritch pornography.] 

Other times he writes about [http://www.scp-wiki.net/of-all-sad-words-of-tongue-or-pen-the-saddest-are-these-it-m what might have been.]

He enjoys slipping other staff members into [http://www.scp-wiki.net/and-then-kit-slept stories about confused drug addicts] and oftentimes they don't even realise it.

Recently he wrote a story about how [http://www.scp-wiki.net/kit-s-brotherhood brotherhood is damn hard work,] then wrote a poem about [http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-duvet-queen The Duvet Queen] which he pretended was written by a fictional character to hide the fact that poetry isn't really his thing.

Kit recently found himself [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-4099042/kit-s-horror-hospital-of-horror in hospital,] where [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1471 an unknown entity] stalks the dark corridors.

Zachary has only been helpful to the site once when he kinda sorta helped with a [http://www.scp-wiki.net/crosslinks-guide crosslink guide.]

--He's still working on things, and wants to let you know that something big respectably medium-sized is [http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/zacharymaxwell2 coming soon.]-- He's not working on things right now. At least not in the public eye. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
