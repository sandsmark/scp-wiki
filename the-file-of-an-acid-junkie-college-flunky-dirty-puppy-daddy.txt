It is much appreciated if you even read my work, let alone want to support a (sometimes literally) starving artist. This is not a requirement, and becoming a Patron is not guaranteed to speed up my work, which I would never promise anyway. I will always write for the fun of it first, but any help you can offer if my Tales have entertained you is much appreciated.

Zachary (Maxwell to his friends) does a whole lot of nothing around here. However, he is a [https://medium.com/@leilamariebloom/end-of-life-plans-154c849b8a9b prize-winning writer] and [https://i.imgur.com/qmvguyt.jpg photographer] who is happy to devote as much time as he can helping people with their drafts. At the time of writing, don't expect the most prompt of responses.

When not critiquing or generally being awesome, he writes. Here are some things he wrote.
