It is much appreciated if you even read my work, let alone want to support a (sometimes literally) starving artist. This is not a requirement, and becoming a Pateron is not guaranteed to speed up my work, which I would never promise anyway. I will always write for the fun of it first, but any help you can offer if my Tales have entertained you is much appreciated.
