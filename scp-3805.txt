**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the progress of gestation, SCP-3805 cannot be contained indefinitely. Until alternative methods of containment can be devised, Protocol UN2-Maker must be enacted at every equinox. Expedition attempts into SCP-3805 via SCP-3805-1A are to be prevented, with the exception of parties attempting Protocol UN2-Maker. Any personnel or entity  returning from SCP-3805-1A not identified as part of MTF Orion-19 (Rift Keepers) is to be terminated immediately. No contact with any returning personnel is to be initiated by those without full access to Protocol UN2-Maker. Protocol UN2-Maker must be initiated from Site 21/SCP-3805-1A. All information related to Protocol UN2-Maker is restricted to the Site 21 Director, Protocol initiators, MTF Orion-19 and Level 5 personnel. 

The 3805 Misinformation Campaign must continue to track all developments and account for any possible discovery of SCP-3805. All attempts by a civilian body or GOI to access any geological layer beneath the lithosphere, regardless of intent or method, is to be halted by any means necessary. Any intrusive attempts to breach the lithosphere are to be halted by MTF Orion-19.  

Any temporary instance of SCP-3085-1 must be isolated until dispersion. Any new permanent SCP-3805-1 instances are to be catalogued and reported to MTF Orion-19. SCP-3805-1B is to remain monitored by Observation and Research Post (ORP) 5303. Any attempts to access or neutralise SCP-3805 are to be halted by MTF Orion-19, with lethal force if necessary.

**Description:** SCP-3805 is a gestating embryonic entity located at the core of what were considered the geological layers of the Earth. The lithosphere is considered a "shell" and outer membrane, while the asthenosphere and mantle are hypothesised to act in a similar manner to albumen in avian eggs (egg white). The outer core is known to be a network of gelatinous tunnel structures, partially linked to SCP-3805-1, while the inner core is recognised as the embryo itself. All layers below the lithosphere are recognised as organic in nature. How SCP-3805 is related to Earth's geological functions, magnetic field and similar items is unknown. 

Drilling, excavation and similar activities into the lithosphere does not affect SCP-3805 or its gestation process, however intrusive actions to layers below the asthenosphere are liable to activate instances of SCP-3805-1. While SCP-3805 does not currently possess any form of advanced consciousness, it is still able to spawn cases of SCP-3805-1 as a reaction to external stimuli. Further investigation into the generation of SCP-3805-1 instances is ongoing. 

SCP-3805-1 are dimensional rifts of varying size created by SCP-3805, activated as a response to external stimuli. Visually these rifts are often tinged a dark purple, and what appear to be stars and purple nebula are visible on the other side. The majority of these rifts are both of moderate size and temporarily active, dispersing when the cause of external stimuli is neutralised. The method of neutralisation varies depending on the nature of the threat, but reports indicate SCP-3805-1 contains unclassified entities that are utilised as defensive mechanisms. (See Addendum 3805-1RO4). These entities are known to be tied to SCP-3805-1, and as such cannot spread beyond the reach of the rift.

There are currently two known SCP-3805-1 surface instances that have remained active over an extended period, with no known method of dispersal available. Both SCP-3805-1A and SCP-3805-1B are tied to physical archways, while standard SCP-3805-1 instances are not. These archways are constructed entirely of stone. SCP-3805-1A is located at Site 21 and is currently the only "stable" rift. This rift is directly linked to SCP-3805 and allows entry by both humans and artificial constructs (--See Exploration Log 3805-1A--[DATA EXPUNGED BY ORDER OF O5-██]). SCP-3805-1A allows direct access to the organic layers of SCP-3805, with the rift's exit being located 15 kilometres beneath the "outer core". As a result SCP-3805-1A is the only location where Protocol UN2-Maker can be enacted. How human access is possible considering the immense temperatures and pressure at that depth is uncertain.

> //As scientists, we have always attempted to assign even the strangest anomalies in our charge with some rational explanation. In order to understand something, we have to make it relate to our laws of reality as best we can, no matter how alien it is. This requirement is what makes study of SCP-3805 impossible.// 
> 
> //The only reason we know SCP-3805 is organic is because of SCP-3805-1A. Because we physically stepped through a dimensional rift and stood in the core of the world. Yes, we had some success with non-intrusive measures, but we never would've known the full extent of SCP-3805's nature if it wasn't for that portal. The only reason we can even say a -1 instance is a "dimensional rift" is because what's on the other side is complete anathema to our standard of reality. We are witnessing something utterly alien, and trying to explain it with the laws bound to our own planet.//

> //So for the love of whichever god you pray to, stop trying to understand this thing. Our position is already tenuous, risking our ground with tests and experiments is foolish at best. Focus on keeping the situation stable and 3805 contained. We're not here to satisfy your curiosity.//

 SCP-3805-1B is located underneath a mansion in ████, France. SCP-3805-1B is currently inert and has been sealed by unknown means, however the occupants of the SCP-3805-1B estate are known to be responsible. It is hypothesised SCP-3805-1B served a similar function to SCP-3805-1A, with recovered items of interest supporting this hypothesis (See Addendum 3805-1B/RI).   

**Addendum 3805/R1**:
Due to an attempt at sabotage by Agent ██████, Agent ████, Site Director ████ and Doctor ██, application of Procedure UN2-Maker was only partially successful. As of  ██/██/████, the O-5 Council will maintain full control over the procedure. Site Director ████ was assigned to Procedure UN2-Maker along with Doctor ██. Both Agents were terminated upon reassignment failure.  

**Addendum 3805-1RO4:**
||~ Stimuli ||~ Entity Description ||~ Entity Reaction  ||
|| One drilling jumbo, positioned near SCP-3805-1A. || Three large, vaguely cephalopod tentacles. || Entity disables jumbo, before dragging it into the rift. No personnel were lost. ||
|| Work crew (Attempt to seal SCP-3805-1A) || Entity is approx. 5 metres tall, consisting entirely of a dark blue liquid, similar to oil. || Work crew is "absorbed" by entity, visibly attempting to escape or call for help while inside it. Entity exits upon absorbing all personnel. ||
|| Submarine drilling operation in the Marianas Trench || Entity resembles a large, obese goat with no hind legs. Both front legs are elongated and appear triple jointed. Actiniaria-like (Sea anemone) growths are present in both eye sockets and inside the mouth. || Entity propelled itself by unknown means and destroyed all relevant machinery. Both the machinery and overseeing submersible were caught by the Actiniaria growths, which extended from the eyes, and crushed.||
|| Detonation of subterranean nuclear warheads during Site ███ containment breach. || Entity was not visible on the visual spectrum, further data pending. || Site was removed from our dimension, no traces of Site ███ remain. Pieces of debris with Foundation markings were visible in SCP-3805-1A upon a later investigation. All SCP items assigned to Site ███ are unaccounted for.||
|| Oil derrick with modified anomalous drilling system. || Survivors state the entity was "a kraken". Cephalopod traits were noted. No further evidence could be collected. || Derrick was destroyed prior to activation. This may suggest SCP-3805 is now able to perceive threats prior to any physical stimuli.||
|| A 15m wide comet. || [REDACTED BY ORDER OF O5-██ AND O5-██] || [REDACTED] ||

> //These entities generated from the -1 instances seem to act as antibodies. This align with our current theory; that SCP-3805 does not act on a conscious level or possess any degree of full sentience.//

**Addendum 3805-1B/RF:**
Following the discovery of SCP-3805-1B, the estate above the sealed anomaly was searched. Among multiple items of interest were the notes of Sir ████ ████████, the final owner of the estate. Most of these notes are files related to experimentation and research into the background of SCP-3805-1B. These notes also delve into SCP-3805, its possible origins, SCP-3805-1 and further tangents. Of note are the final pages of ████████'s journal, which detail an expedition into SCP-3805-1B. The body of ████████ was also found, with a gunshot wound to the skull. The final page has been translated from French.

We had trekked through a profusion of flesh and hideous starlight to stop the spread of that unnatural-

**Item #:** SCP-3805

**Object Class:** --Keter-- Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** In addition to standard document:

In order for SCP-3805's continued viable use, the entity must maintain its current state of gestation. All attempts at growth from SCP-3805 are to be prevented by means of Procedure UN2-Maker. To provide suitable candidates, target persons are to be fed specific information regarding SCP-3805 and SCP-3805-1. These files include a completed journal by the deceased found at SCP-3805-1B and detailed documentation on fully developed versions of SCP-3805. Conditions of Procedure UN2-Maker are designed to replicate the events documented by persons involved in the expedition through SCP-3805-1B. 

Procedure UN2-Maker requires the following: 
* At least four individuals fully aware of SCP-3805's nature and "impossible" containment. All individuals must have reached a sufficient level of emotional distress/trauma. (These individuals are hereby referred to as "batch")
* Item 3805 Alpha (An elongated knife made of an unidentified metallic substance, origin is extradimensional).
* The delivery of batch to the centre of SCP-3805, containing the "heart" (known to be a physical avatar for SCP-3805). 
* The provocation of the "heart".  
* The termination of all personnel by the "heart".   
* The termination of the "heart" with the use of Item 3805 Alpha. 
* The marking of the "heart" with Item 305 Alpha with a runic cognitohazard.
* Exfiltration of surviving MTF units. 

Any personnel exiting SCP-3805-1A must be terminated immediately. MTF Orion-19 (Rift Keepers) are responsible for the implementation and success of Procedure UN2-Maker. 

**Description:** In addition to standard document: 

SCP-3805 has the capacity, at its current stage in development, to counter extraterrestrial threats that would otherwise significantly damage or destroy it. Due to this, multiple XK Class end-of-the-world scenarios have been avoided. SCP-3805 appears to respond to both anomalous and non-anomalous threats, with no current priority towards one or the other. There is currently no usable means of target prioritisation. SCP-3805 appears to respond against threats in a similar manner as it would any terrestrial attack, generating a dimensional rift/entity to destroy or otherwise remove the instance. 

Exploration of SCP-3805-1 has revealed that some objects, both anomalous and otherwise, remain within SCP-3805-1. There is no known way, with the exception of SCP-3805-1A, for any of these items to exit the dimension. All anomalous objects are currently recognised as contained. Currently, no object lost to SCP-3805-1 can be recovered.  SCP-3805 does not seem to be able to engage with any threats that are either not on a direct course to Earth or beyond a certain range. As a result, SCP-3805 is to be supplemented by Foundation defence assets and cannot be relied upon to counter any threats in deep space. 

As SCP-3805's growth cannot be reversed without a loss of its current defensive capacity, no methods of degenerating SCP-3805 or retarding its growth are under research. To this end, every possible action must be taken to ensure Procedure UN2-Maker is maintained. Failure to implement Procedure UN2-Maker will result in an XK Class end-of-the-world scenario and complete planetary destruction.
