**Item #:** SCP-247

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP-247 is kept in a concrete enclosure of at least ███ by ███ feet, furnished based on the plans provided by the [REDACTED] Zoo.  SCP-247 is to be fed ██ pounds of fresh meat on a tri-weekly basis.  Feeding occurs in a separate enclosure.  Cleaning staff should enter the enclosure only during designated feeding times.  No other access to the enclosure is allowed.  The footage resulting from any violation of this order is to be archived for use in training the cleaning and monitoring staff of SCP-247.  In the unlikely event that there are any survivors of a containment breach, they will be demoted to D-class.

In case of a containment breach, the entire wing must be evacuated and all live footage of the incident heavily censored.  The area SCP-247 occupies will be sealed off and gassed, followed by the return of SCP-247 to containment.  If for any reason this should become impossible, a special team of D-class personnel, designations D-247r1-12, will be sent in armed with heavy tranquilizer rifles and armoured with SCP-148.  D-247r have been selected for high reflexes, excellent marksmanship, and sadistic tendencies toward small animals.

**Description:**

To the human eye, SCP-247 appears to be a young house cat with an orange and black striped coat resembling that of a tiger.  Remote feeds and even still photos also show this illusion, although it is unknown whether the photo itself is affected or merely the observer.

Based on weight, water-displacement, dietary requirements and behavior, we have determined (with a 0.██ margin of error) that SCP-247 is actually a fully grown Bengal Tiger.  It is unknown exactly how the SCP generates this illusion.  There are two components to the illusion: first, a memetic effect that changes the perceived image of SCP-247 to that of a kitten, and second a psychic component which radiates outward from the SCP (diminishing according to the inverse square law and reaching half strength at █ meters.)  Any sentient being within this field comes under the impression that SCP-247 is completely harmless, regardless of prior knowledge or experience.  Individuals in this field also show extreme reluctance to harm or allow others to harm SCP-247, even while [DATA EXPUNGED].  This psychic field can be blocked with SCP-148 or avoided by striking from well outside its effective range.  The memetic affect is not blocked by SCP-148 and as of yet nobody has been able to see SCP-247 as anything but a small striped cat.

Typically when a human approaches SCP-247, it will begin to purr or mew.  The victim will remark that this is adorable and approach to pet the SCP (this has been observed even in subjects who strongly dislike cats.)  SCP-247 has been known to accept affection from its victims for upwards of seven minutes before disemboweling and devouring them.

Genetic analysis shows slight deviation from a typical Bengal Tiger's genotype, indicating possible contamination [DATA EXPUNGED] all further breeding experiments require O-5 level approval.
