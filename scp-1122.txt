**Item #:** SCP-1122

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All roads leading to SCP-1122 are to be sealed off, with two armed guards to stand outside SCP-1122 at all times to prevent unauthorized access. Class-A amnesiacs are to be administered to any civilian that catches sight of the facility. No objects (with the exception of any recording technology, which must be worn discreetly) can be carried into SCP-1122 without administrator approval. All test subjects must be searched by the guards before entry to prevent the introduction of an unauthorized item into SCP-1122’s environment.

**Description:** SCP-1122 is an abandoned tourist attraction, originally constructed in 19██ as a “house of the future” to demonstrate what life may be like in the coming decades, located on the outskirts of ███████████, ██. No evidence exists of SCP-1122 displaying any anomalous properties prior to its abandonment.

SCP-1122’s interior is unusually well-maintained, and filled with devices that existed at neither the time of the building’s construction nor the present. The house’s kitchen is stocked with food pills that change into full-course meals after hydration, miniature robots travel throughout the house performing cleaning and other chores, and a car capable of flight can be seen in the garage. Smuggling these items has revealed that they refuse to function outside of SCP-1122. Although SCP-1122 is more advanced than modern technology in some respects, it is less advanced than others. There is no personal computer (or even a calculator) on the premises, and the house’s television is of a considerably lower picture quality than its modern counterparts.

The house is also populated by a Caucasian family of four, consisting of a man (SCP-1122-1) and a woman (SCP-1122-2), approximately 3█ years of age, a daughter (SCP-1122-3) approximately 1█ years of age, and a song (SCP-1122-4) approximately █ years of age. Although test subjects have occasionally witnessed the family members entering and leaving the house, they have never been seen outside of the building. All four residents of SCP-1122 are docile and, at the time of their original discovery, perpetually cheerful, and have usually been willing to answer whatever question they’re asked.

When asked for today’s date, all four residents will state it to be exactly ten years after the current date. (The Foundation originally believed SCP-1122 to be prophetic, though this has since proven false.) Their knowledge of history prior to the year 195█ is relatively accurate, though afterwards they reference fictitious persons and events such as the creation of a lunar colony, while failing to recognize real ones such as Martin Luther King Jr.

SCP-1122’s most unusual property was demonstrated on ██/██/199█, when Dr. ██████’s mobile phone rang while conducting an interview with the family. During ██████’s next visit, he noticed SCP-1122-2 talking on a mobile phone of identical build to his own, which the family has used ever since. Upon interrogation, SCP-1122-1 denied the phone being a new addition, claiming they had always owned it. SCP-1122-3 and SCP-1122-4 then complained to Dr. ██████ that their mother is too occupied with talking on the phone to pay attention to them, the first time any residents of SCP-1122 had displayed unhappiness.

If a device that did not exist or see widespread use prior to 195█ is seen by the residents of SCP-1122, the device in question will be integrated into the house from that point onward, oftentimes replacing an original item. (Food pills disappeared from SCP-1122 after introducing a microwave oven, for example.) Each new item has, without fail, had a negative effect on the house’s inhabitants. SCP-1122-1 has frequently been seen drinking, lamenting how “things should be better,” while SCP-1122-3 and SCP-1122-4 have become more introverted, rarely being seen outside their rooms.

**Addendum:** //Testing on SCP-1122 has been suspended until further notice. Although Dr. ██████████ should be reprimanded for even thinking of giving them crack cocaine, we feel the// [DATA EXPUNGED] //is punishment enough.//
