**Item #:** SCP-1111-J

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1111-J is to be stored in a purpose built room in Site 26 with several plug sockets for it and testing equipment. It is not to be connected to other computers except under strict testing conditions. When testing is complete all computers that were connected to SCP-1111-J are to be tested for anomalous efficiency levels. If they are shown to be unusually workable then they are to be stored as a possible duplicate of SCP-1111-J. Otherwise they must be destroyed. It is not to be connected to the internet under any circumstances and Site 26 is forbidden to maintain any more than one (landline) connection to the internet. In the event of SCP-1111-J becoming connected to the internet, Site 26 is to detonate hidden C4 charges at various points along its landline connection and contact Command by radio for further orders.

**Description:** SCP-1111-J is a [BRAND REDACTED] computer which has never experienced a recorded fault of any sort and maintains the actual computing power it was advertised as having. It was discovered when computers in a Foundation office were being updated. Every computer froze at least once, and several overheated to the point of melting their casing or catching fire, except SCP-1111-J. At that time it was discovered that no errors were recorded on the machine. It will run any viable program without fail.
It is unknown how SCP-1111-J maintains its remarkable computing power. No such machine has been shown to have similar qualities and no unusual parts, unknown programs, remarkable power usage, ectoplasm, unusual religious atmosphere, miraculous events, crying statues, healing events, ghosts, technovampires, entities of pure energy or mysterious voices have been detected near SCP-1111-J despite daily sweeps of its room and careful monitoring of all known variables.
It has been proven capable of doing so even while connected to a normal computer of the same brand which was infected with several viruses. Due to this, it is theorised that if SCP-1111-J were to maintain a connection with the internet for even a short amount of time the world's networks could become dangerously efficient.

//We need to find out what makes this machine tick, if we had but twenty of these our clerical costs would go down by 67%. Testing should be re-opened. - Dr. Smallwood.
Fine, but you will be held personally responsible for any incidents incurred by testing. - 05-11.//

**SCP-1111-J Test Log**
Chief Researcher: Dr. Smallwood 

> **Test 1**
> Note that SCP-1111-J is currently running its default operating system at default settings.
> Dr. Smallwood installed a word processor known to break down frequently and typed up several documents without error.
> 
> **Test 2**
> Dr. Smallwood typed out a text document with several deliberate errors and activated the spellcheck function. The spellcheck caught all grammatical and spelling errors and did not create any new errors in solving them. No errors noted.
> //Amazing! If they all worked like this no one would ever be told to "consult an alchemist" again!"// - Dr. Smallwood
> 
> **Test 3**
> Dr. Smallwood left a word processor with a finished but unsaved document alone while he left to have a cup of tea and do a crossword. Upon his return no errors had occured nor did any occur as he saved the file and exited the program.
> 
> **Test 4**
> Dr. Smallwood attempted to disable the stylised "helpful mascot" on the word processor. When he exited the program and entered again it did not pop up nor did it re-appear unexpectedly after restarting the machine and opening the program. He repeated this several times and it still did not reappear.
> 
> **Test 5**
> Dr. Smallwood attempted to exit a word processor with an open unsaved file. The word processor prompted him to save before exiting and he did so. The program did not freeze while saving or prompting. No errors noted.
> 
> **Test 6**
> Upon realising that new updates were available for [OS REDACTED] Dr. Smallwood saved them to a small specialised network, created a program to inform SCP-1111-J of the updates and connected SCP-1111-J to the network. SCP-1111-J prompted Dr. Smallwood to allow it to complete updates, allowed him to postpone them and restarted without incident when the update was complete.
> 
> **Test 7**
> Dr. Smallwood installed an antivirus program onto SCP-1111-J before infecting it with a basic computer virus. The virus was immediately caught, quarantined and deleted. No errors occured.
> 
> **Test 8**
> Dr. Smallwood installed an additional antivirus program before testing for conflicts. When no conflicts were found he added another and repeated the test. After thirteen programs were added with no conflicts he ceased testing for the day.
> //Seriously, what// - Dr. Smallwood
> 
> **Test 9**
> Dr. Smallwood connected SCP-1111-J to a virtual network and opened a commonly used email client, upon which he had placed a full contact list including some contacts marked with notes like "boss," "potential client" and "wife." He wrote a short offensive e-mail and used the "send to many" function to send it to several contacts, not including those with notes. The e-mail was sent to the intended addresses and //not// to the addresses marked with notes.
