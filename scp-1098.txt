**Item #:** SCP-1098

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All written instances of SCP-1098 are to be burned, painted over, or otherwise obliterated. A single recorded instance is kept on a standard audiocasette for study. Under no circumstances should this recording be digitized.

All instances of SCP-1098-1 are to be contained in converted class-D barracks. They are to be provided food from the site cafeteria at regular mealtimes. Under no circumstances may they be given writing implements or recording media. A television and puzzles and games are to be provided for SCP-1098-1s entertainment. The barracks must be soundproofed to STC 60+.

Two guards are to be posted at the door of the SCP-1098-1 barracks. All guards are to wear full-ear headphones equipped with active filters designed to scramble human speech. 

**Description:** SCP-1098 is a â–ˆ-syllable word, with a phoneme pattern consistent with origin among modern speakers of American English. It appears to have no effect on non-English speakers. Persons reading or hearing SCP-1098 in context report that is euphonious and somewhat humorous. Exposure to SCP-1098 out of context appears to be safe but this has not been conclusively established.

Each exposure to SCP-1098 has an approximately 20% chance of infection. Infected individuals (hereafter known as SCP-1098-1) will begin to use SCP-1098 preferentially as a placeholder name (similarly to "whatchamacallit", "thingamajig" or "whatshisname") and respond positively to its use by others. 

Example usage:
> "Hey Ray, can you hand me that [REDACTED]? No, not that one, the frickin' [REDACTED] over there."

Within 2-3 weeks of exposure, SCP-1098-1 will begin substituting SCP-1098 for other parts of speech with increasing frequency. Initially it is possible to communicate with SCP-1098-1 by inferring the intended meaning of SCP-1098 from context, but soon the prevalence of SCP-1088 in speech becomes so high that only other instances of SCP-1098-1 are able to comprehend it. In the final stages of infection, every utterance of SCP-1098-1 becomes a string of variously-inflected instances of SCP-1098.

Instances of SCP-1098-1 are generally cooperative, but express panic, anxiety, or depression upon discovering that they cannot be understood. When speaking with other instances of SCP-1098-1, they display expressions of relief. Standardized testing confirms that they have no cognitive impairment other than their muddled speech.
