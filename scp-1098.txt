**Item #:** SCP-XXX

**Object Class:**Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**
All written instances of SCP-XXX are to be burned, painted over, or otherwise obliterated. A single recorded instance is kept on a standard audiocasette for study. Under no circumstances should this recording be digitized.

All instances of SCP-XXX-1 are to be contained in converted class-D barracks. They are to be provided food from the site cafeteria at regular mealtimes. Under no circumstances may they be given writing implements or recording media. A television and puzzles and games are to be provided for SCP-XXX-1s entertainment. The barracks must be soundproofed to STC 60+.

Two guards are to be posted at the door of the SCP-XXX-1 barracks, chosen preferentially for dyslexia and/or poor hearing. Regardless of disability, all guards are to wear earplugs and noise-cancelling headphones at all times. 

**Description:**
SCP-XXX is a "placeholder name", with a phoneme pattern consistent with origin among modern speakers of American English. It appears to have no effect on non-English speakers. Persons reading or hearing SCP-XXX in context report that is euphonious and somewhat humorous. Exposure to SCP-XXX out of context appears to be safe but this has not been conclusively established.

Instances of SCP-XXX-1are generally cooperative, but express panic, anxiety, or depression upon discovering that they cannot be understood. Standardized testing confirms that they have no cognitive impairment other than their muddled speech. When speaking with other instances of SCP-XXX-1, they display expressions of relief.

Each exposure to SCP-XXX has an approximately 20% chance of infection. Infected individuals (hereafter known as SCP-XXX-1) will begin to use SCP-XXX preferentially as a placeholder name and respond positively to its use by others. Within 2-3 weeks of exposure, SCP-XXX-1 will begin substituting SCP-XXX for other parts of speech with increasing frequency. Initially it is possible to communicate with SCP-XXX-1 by inferring the intended meaning of SCP-XXX by context, but soon its prevalence becomes so high that only other instances of SCP-XXX-1 are able to comprehend it. In the final stages of infection, every utterance of SCP-XXX-1 becomes a string of variously-inflected instances of SCP-XXX.
