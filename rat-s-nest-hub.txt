In Alaska, something like a woman balances on something resembling a tree.
The sky above it is wispy with feathers of birds migrating to nowhere,
and down by the lake their heads become temporarily dislodged.

The horizon is shaded in static purple, and I can see it all. Everything is real and original. 
Everything has gone to hell, and this rock seems to be my faraday cage. I don't even know what I am anymore.

My thoughts are coherent at least.

Am I the only one still capable of being afraid?
I think I'm the only one waiting for a universal singularity. Everything else is indifferent.
The rats have been multiplying for a long time, and it shouldn't be long now.
I wait for my pleasant existential failure.

The year is 3053, and I've seen it all.
Let's begin at the end.

The Rat's Nest canon covers the effects of the destruction of [http://goc.wikidot.com/lte-0913-exmachina LTE 0913 Ex Machina] and the events following. The results are the creation and increasing occurrence of SCP objects, and a very gradual reality failure. There is no linear narrative, and these should be made to be read in any order - things are mixed up, and timelines are screwed due to last-ditch efforts to set things right. 

These should be arranged by how early on in a timeline they are, and just how close the world is to its absolute end. If your tale happens to be both, use your discretion. 

The Information Age: The last dominant Age of Humanity.
The Last Era: The in-between age where humans are struggling just to exist.
The Age of Rot: A time where humans are the minority, and extranormal creatures, Changed humans, and objects are the norm.
The Rat's Nest: Complete chaos, an abortion of the universe.
