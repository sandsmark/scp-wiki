In Alaska, something like a woman balances on something resembling a tree.
The sky above it is wispy with feathers of birds migrating to nowhere,
and down by the lake their heads become temporarily dislodged.

The horizon is shaded in static purple, and I can see it all. Everything is real and original. 
Everything has gone to hell, and this rock seems to be my faraday cage. I don't even know what I am anymore.

My thoughts are coherent at least.

Am I the only one still capable of being afraid?
I think I'm the only one waiting for a universal singularity. Everything else is indifferent.
The rats have been multiplying for a long time, and it shouldn't be long now.
I wait for my pleasant existential failure.

The year is 3053, and I've seen it all.
Let's begin at the end.

The Rat's Nest canon covers the effects of the destruction of [[[goc-supplemental-threat-entities|LTE 0913 Ex Machina]]] and the events following. The results are the creation and increasing occurrence of SCP objects, and a very gradual reality failure.

There are a few different aspects about this universe that are different from typical Foundation canon. This is more or less the "Dreadlords" canon that is often joked about:

# The GOC are responsible for anomalies as a result of their killing of God. They are aware of this and desperately want to fix things.
# The Administrator and individuals in the Foundation's top level leadership are anomalies themselves and not on the side of normalcy as //we// know it. They gather anomalous objects and are loathe to destroy them.
# The Chaos Insurgency (aptly named) is a splinter group due to the 2nd point listed. Due to the Foundation's influence they are demonized and hunted.

------

**Ancient History:** This part of the timeline should primarily explore the destruction of [[[goc-supplemental-threat-entities|LTE 0913 Ex Machina]]], the nature of it, reasons for its destruction, and the ancient origins of the GOC in respect to the Rat's Nest canon.

**The Information Age:** The last dominant age of humanity before the anomalies multiplied out of control.

**The Last Era:** The in-between age where humans are struggling just to exist. Some pockets of civilization are still relatively habitable, while others are quite chaotic. Think Fallout.

**The Age of Rot:** A time where mundane humans, flora, and fauna are extremely rare. Extranormal creatures and objects are the norm. 

**The Rat's Nest:** Complete chaos, an abortion of the universe.
