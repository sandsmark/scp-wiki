In Alaska, something like a woman balances on something resembling a tree.
The sky above it is wispy with feathers of birds migrating to nowhere.
Down by the lake their heads become temporarily dislodged.

The horizon is shaded in static purple, and I can see it all. Everything is real and original. 
Everything has gone to hell, and this rock seems to be my faraday cage. I don't even know what I am anymore.

My thoughts are coherent at least.

Am I the only one still capable of being afraid?
I think I'm the only one waiting for a universal singularity. Everything else is indifferent.
The rats have been multiplying for a long time, and it shouldn't be long now.
I wait for my pleasant existential failure.

The year is 3053, and I've seen it all.
But let's begin at the end.

The Rat's Nest canon covers the effects of the destruction of [http://goc.wikidot.com/lte-0913-exmachina LTE 0913 Ex Machina] and the events following. The results are the creation and increasing occurrence of SCP objects, and a very gradual reality failure. There is no linear narrative, but these should be arranged by the date they take place.
