**Item #:** SCP-2875

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** A perimeter is to be established 2km from the center of Marengo, WI, and no non-Foundation personnel are to pass this limit. Mobile Task Force Lamba-2 "Chain Gang" is to oversee containment of SCP-2875.

**Updated Containment Procedures:** Due to recent findings, only MTF Î›-2 approved equipment is considered acceptable to dispatch SCP-2875-A instances. Under no circumstances are any personnel to attempt to dispatch an instance of SCP-2875-A with a firearm, incendiary device, or other unauthorized implement. 

**Description:** SCP-2875 is a phenomenon occurring only in the town of Marengo, Wisconsin. At noon every three days, between 50-100 fully grown adult //Ursus arctos horribilis// (mainland grizzly bear) will appear throughout the town. These instances do not appear to be anomalously strong or fast, or anomalously hostile, and will generally act like any other member of their species given the situation.

The phenomenon appears to be cumulative; the instances (SCP-2875-A) will linger around the town center for a short time before dispersing, and more instances will appear three days later. Due to the potential scaling issues of the bear population growth, it has become imperative to dispatch the new instances as quickly as possible.

Currently the only feasible means to dispatch SCP-2875-A instances is by using a cutting instrument of some kind to decapitate them, as killing any of the instances using a firearm or incendiary device results in two new instances appearing next to the corpse of the deceased instance. As such, only Foundation standard motorized link-chain saws have been permitted for use against the instances, with other bladed weapons being permitted per MTF leader instruction.

**Discovery:** SCP-2875 was discovered by Foundation containment teams sent to investigate the sudden disappearance of an entire town of people. Upon arriving at Marengo, the situation quickly became apparently when the town was observed as being flooded with SCP-2875-A instances. Initially the containment teams had prepared to move all of the instances to other habitats outside of Marengo, but when the recurring nature of SCP-2875 was discovered, the current containment procedures were established.
