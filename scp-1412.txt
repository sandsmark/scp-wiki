title:SCP-1412
**Item #:** SCP-1412

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1412  are kept in 2 m x 2 m x 6 m terrariums filled partially with aired soil. The rooms are to be filtered for humidity and supplied with typical ventilation for oxygen and carbon dioxide.

**Description:** The pair comprising SCP-1412 closely resemble //Cryptomeria// ‘Japanese cedar’ trees,  standing 4.45 m in height and 1.21 m in diameter at the base. The pair has a similar biological profile and varies only slightly in appearance.  Dendrochronological surveys of the trees are inconclusive due to a lack of annual rings inside of the trunks. Radiocarbon dating returns various results ranging from two (2) months to ██ ×109 years. 

SCP-1412 achieves mobility through growth. Frontal maws located underneath the bases of the trees digest plant and animal matter, which is then processed at an irregular rate, producing more bark for propulsion, effectively pushing them forward. Feeding in this manner does not seem to be crucial to the existence of SCP-1412, although in most cases either have been shown to move given an opportunity. The pair seems to prefer traveling at a relatively close distance. Top speeds for either instance of SCP-1412 clock at 8 knots.

Introduction to small amounts of water (1 l) cause the bark of SCP-1412 to combust. Damaged sections of the trees do not appear to heal, but this does not result in reduced mobility or any abnormal behavior. Fire on the bark shows a faint purple, burning at roughly 200 °C. Further study into the mechanism eliciting this process is underway. The pair seems to be immune to fire up to temperatures of 1,300 °C.

SCP-1412 was discovered in Tenryū-Okumikawa Park by a group of civilians hiking in the area. The group was interviewed and administered with amnesiacs while a concurrent expedition was undertaken by Agent Breen and Researcher Sanders. The team reported following a trail of twisting, horizontal trunks through 23 ha of dense forest. The area surrounding the then dead bark was barren, although this range was reported to have only stretched roughly 1 m on either side of the husks. SCP-1412 was eventually discovered near Atera Seven Falls after two-days tracking. See Containment Report 1412 for further details.

**Containment Report:** 1412

> Sanders and I reached Atera Seven Falls after following the husks for roughly two days. We found the pair comprising SCP-1412 near the overhang of Atera Seven, each of ‘em was leaning forward on the overhang. Sanders got in a bit closer to check the things out, she didn’t find anything unusual aside from the faint purple glow near the bottom of the trunks. The things were a bit warm too. Didn’t seem to be moving at all. I had Sanders page the evac unit.

Note: //The trees were very close to falling into the river. Excavation revealed a large rock underneath the banks obstructing the trajectory.//
