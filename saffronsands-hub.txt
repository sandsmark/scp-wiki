> In Saffron Sands is intended to show, as a series, the anomalous experience in India - a place of economic turmoil, rampant speculation and superstition, and some of the richest mythos on the planet itself.
> 
> In Saffron Sands functions as a series intended to showcase what exactly there is to offer once horizons are broadened. The world of I.S.S. is a completely godless one; in which rampant factions attempt to corral power and support to fulfill what roles have been opened, and one fellow (and his occasionally assholish snake demon) attempt to nix a plot long running behind the scenes. 
> 
> The Foundation's role here is a passive one; new to the landscape of India, they mainly rely on such groups as The House of the Naga to provide major intel. As such, they're often late to the party, gambling on large scale control rather than preventative measures. Most developing problems are met with force by the House -- psychokinetic fiends that do whatever the hell they want, as long as it's for the good of India.
> 
> Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Samanee Samaj is quite against this. A splinter from the House, they attempt to enforce normalcy via any means necessary; whether that be poisoning the force that House members manipulate, effectively killing them, or destroying the minor deities that foolishly roam the area.
> 
> India is a place of conflict, where the House has retreated into the shadows, the Foundation is lost, the BSS reigns, and the anomalous is not discussed. Despite this, a number of minor deities decide to make their move once more...
> 
> ----
> 
> In Saffron Sands is intended to discuss important topics; stuff like xenophobia, homophobia, poverty, and the like. Despite this, expect some comedy too; it is what the gods do best, and in the words of The Devil; "Unpleasantness is the worst kind of pleasantness. Humor is needed to make the drab worth getting through."
