[[tab Introduction]]
Welcome to my author page.  Not an in-universe document, I'm afraid - I'm not sure I have sufficient inspiration in that line to create an engaging variation on the theme.  And this will be plenty self-indulgent enough without making up an author insert.
 
But yeah, drop by again some time - I'll update as I remember more narcissistic things to add!  And maybe I'll even fix the formatting to make it more readable.
 
So here's what I've done on the site so far:
 
[[module ListPages created_by="psul" order="rating desc" separate="no" tags="scp" perPage="250" prependLine="||~ SCP Number ||~ Rating ||~ Comments ||~ Created ||"]]

I have also contributed a poem (on 9/9/2015) to the [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2673-containment-maintenance-log |collaborative log]]] for [[[SCP-2673]]].

Here's my sandbox, so you can see what might be coming up next: [http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/psul psul's sandbox]
 
**General thoughts**
 
* My submissions to the site tend to be meta, format screws or both.
* That is because I tend to create with a very formulaic methodology - my ideas are unlikely to be completely out of the blue, and more likely to be derivative of something already on the site.  The good ones tend to develop in a different direction than where they start.
* I first came across the site via a reference to the Hanged King's Tragedy ([[[SCP-701]]]) in a comments section somewhere else on the interwebs.  That is a pretty good place to start on this site, I would suggest.

**Spoilers and trivia**
 
|| **"Office furniture"** || [[[SCP-2130]]] || The second SCP idea I had after I joined the site, and one that has thoroughly divided readers. ||
@@ @@
[[collapsible show="+ SCP-2130 Spoilers etc" hide="- collapse"]]
* Spoiler - this was written solely for the purpose of providing an in-universe justification for LolFoundation tropes.  The aim was to go from jokey tone to serious undercurrent - someone is sabotaging the Foundation in an incredibly effective way - and then to an ominous payoff.  Looks like it didn't work for lots of readers.
 
* The biggest criticism was of kappa radiation - a "phlebotinum" way of explaining how the Foundation could know the mechanism of the anomaly (so that it can test for it) but make testing difficult by having background levels of K-rays (so that the skip has some menace to it).  I understand why people objected - I was probably trying to do too much world-building here, and it is kinda reminiscent of Scranton anchors - but I'm not sure whether removing it is the solution, or whether it was just a lightning rod for people who would downvote anyway.  I might try re-writing it to remove the concept at some stage.
 
* The other thing readers objected to was the idea of O5 being compromised.  Again, fair enough, but without that I think the skip doesn't have enough of a sting in the tail.  At least I didn't go with the original ending, which was a further addendum showing that far from being compromised by SCP-2130, the O5 council had in fact deliberately introduced it to Foundation sites as a way to push forward research into anomalies, even at the cost of Foundation lives.  That will not be coming back in any future re-write.
 
* This one dipped pretty quickly to -7, and was looking like being deleted.  I made a few (fairly minor) edits, particularly to the Site Director's note, and that seems to have saved it.  It sat at -1 and 0 net votes for absolutely ages, but will hopefully continue to live in the positives.  That is not a challenge.
 
* I really like the idea of Site-73 - a place with very few living SCPs, so it's like the world's deadliest stationery company - less outlandish and more relatable than other sites.  I will try to set more SCPs there if I can.

* Spoiler - yes, this is just me writing an "Explained" "Joke" SCP about explaining jokes.  Yes, that makes me very annoying, and I should stop.
 
* Apart from the punchline of the article, the levels of meta involved were not deliberate, but I definitely enjoyed reading people explain it to one another in the comments.
 
* The other "jokes" referred to in the test logs are of course:
  * "A duck walks into a bar, and says 'Put it on my bill'" - or one of the variations on that set-up.
  * "Knock knock" ... "Don't cry, it's only a ghost."
  * Pick your favourite racist stereotype.
  * Not a joke per se, but the standard "anecdote falls flat without hilarious drunken context".
  * "To get to the other side."

|| **"An utterly driven researcher"** || [[[SCP-2136]]] || My most upvoted article so far.  An attempt to write "straightforward horror" that ended up in a format screw, of course. ||
@@ @@
[[collapsible show="+ SCP-2136 Spoilers etc" hide="- collapse"]]
* Spoiler - the pathogen takes over its hosts and can then manipulate their bodies.  By the end of the diary, it has taken over both of the surviving researchers.  It then needs to cover its tracks, but it doesn't yet have the motor control to type clearly, or to input complex passwords - that's the reason for the format screw at the outset.
 
* Headcanon - I like to think that the infection first arrived on the Sentinel Islands because they were looking up at the light from the stars.  I really like the corruption of that usually rather innocent and peaceful activity - I just couldn't work out a way to add it to the diary without it seeming forced. 

* The idea for this one was literally "what would happen if you reversed the effect of [[[SCP-173]]]?"  Leaving aside that [[[SCP-096]]] arguably already does that, it was a pretty stupid idea.  Even once I realised it would work better as an invisible pathogen, I was still thinking about having researcher notes suggesting cross-testing with 173, to see if it could be made immobile both when it was watched and when it was not.  //And// a supervisor's note saying how bad an idea it was, as it might have "precisely the opposite effect".  I'm thankful I didn't go down that path.
 
* The idea to use a diary was the key to unlocking this one.  It allowed me to create a character, who can act as a reader surrogate (note that Dr Heidke's sex/gender is not specified) and can add emotion.  Putting the diary in tabs, rather than drop-downs, was also important, I think, as it kept everything on the same page and kept the reading speed high.
 
* Keeping up a high pace is important for the skip to work (as several people commented), as otherwise suspension of disbelief is liable to collapse here.  I have been very surprised that no-one has called me on any of the following:
  * Can Eta-10 really capture the Indian agents without anyone ever looking at them, or any native Sentinelese?
  * How have the three scientists always managed to stay in visual range of one another for three days?
  * If they are all under quarantine, how does Dr Heidke get access to a new D Class, mirrors etc?
  * Is Dr Fletcher really so unprofessional that he didn't disclose the fact of his having seen inside the containment cell?
  * Does the Foundation not have any ability to communicate with those inside quarantine, so that the message about the breach etc could be sent electronically?  Cognitohazards are a thing, but still!
 
* Once I decided to write this as horror, I was quite methodical about it.  I knew that things needed to escalate, so I needed an incident of graphic violence, then the narrator's experience of freezing (and realisation of the containment breach), then the death of another researcher, then the realisation of being taken over (worse than death).  Things like the personalised horror trope of "when I was nine I almost drowned" felt very artificial to write, as did "LOOOK", but they seem to have (mostly) worked for readers.
 
* One thing I do like about this skip, however, is the fact that the reader can //genuinely// afford to ignore what the strike-through text says.  It doesn't add anything that isn't obvious through the rest of the article - it's the presence of the struck through text that is important.  
 
* Another small thing I like is the way the Foundation captures two government agents of a nuclear power, and has classified them as //D Class// within three days.  That is cold.
 
* One last bit of trivia - to try for verisimilitude in the 0555 entry on Day 5, I typed it with my knuckles.

|| **"Blank space"** || [[[SCP-2161]]] || My entry to the Short Works Contest 2015. ||
@@ @@
[[collapsible show="+ SCP-2161 Spoilers etc" hide="- collapse"]]
* When I first read about the contest (500 word maximum), I didn't have any ideas ready for it.  I decided to take my own advice to newbies, and think about the effect that I wanted to create.  The feeling that I wanted to try to evoke was the existential horror of an empty universe.  I didn't get there, but I would settle for loneliness.  
 
* As it turned out, the ending is rather more hopeful sounding than I originally wrote.  The note started by ending "WE ARE ALONE".  In the forums, it was suggested that was somewhat narmy (a word I had to look up), so I produced about 8 different drafts of the final note.  In the end, I rewrote it again with 30 minutes to go before I entered the contest.  I like the sound of "I will search on" from a purely aesthetic perspective, which was what clinched it.  It probably detracts from the original plan of loneliness (although I think that interpretation is still open), but I also don't mind the idea of human fortitude in the face of impossible odds.  Ah well, the people who thought it was narmy still do, by the sounds of the comments.
 
* The second half of this idea came from a deliberate attempt to mimic ophite's "semantic whiplash" - the idea (to paraphrase ophite) of starting with something normal, then contradicting it, and then pile on increasingly insane facts.  To be honest, I didn't even get the first part right (I should have written something like "a collection of sheets of A4 paper, numbering approximately 85 million, which are self-replicating"), but I wanted a bizarre item made up of the everyday, and once the idea for self-replicating blank paper arrived it was too appropriate to the contest not to use it.
 
* Once I had those two ideas (blank paper that increases, the horror of an empty universe) the rest of the SCP almost writes itself.  I needed a connection between the paper and space travel, and eventually just decided to have the skip turn on a dime, with basically no justification, and see if readers would come along for the ride.  
 
* A number of people have commented that the format-screw of having the document itself affected by increasing space is unnecessary.  I disagree.  With the format-screw, the skip illustrates the feeling of isolation that it is intended to describe, adding to the effect.  In particular, the final note gains more power because the visual effect makes it easier to accept the weaker writing.  And of course it is a slight meta-joke that the length of this skip is increased, without rendering it ineligible for the contest on word-count rules (although the separate letters in the final note each count as one word).
 
* Again, a lot of the writing is very deliberate.  Apart from the attempts at disorienting the reader noted above:
  * I have again left Dr Harper's sex/gender unspecified
  * Dr Harper is both a physicist and author, to justify the final note, as well as the space-travel
  * Dr Harper's home is "former" and "abandoned", suggesting that there is no significant other there - again looking to push the theme of loneliness
  * Dr Harper is from Adelaide because I am Australian but not South Australian, and therefore consider Adelaide to be the likely birthplace of the kind of odd dreamer that would create space travel from paper
 
* This was a pain in the neck to write (and especially to amend the final note) - so many spaces to count, and so many @ symbols to stop them being parsed automatically back to single spacing.  Thanks to Crayne for reminding me how to do it.

|| **"Secrets, secrets are no fun..."** || [[[SCP-2138]]] || My very first SCP idea - one that took a while to come into focus. ||
@@ @@
[[collapsible show="+ SCP-2138 Spoilers etc" hide="- collapse"]]
* I put my first draft of this on the forums 5 days after joining the site.  I got one piece of feedback at that stage, but I was lucky, because it was from Eskobar ([[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-1213692 |for the record]]]).  Eskobar pulled no punches, and while I had expected direct critique, it was a shock - and probably the best thing that could have happened to me as a first-time writer.  Mostly because Eskobar was right about everything.

* After that, it took a long time to redraft.  My initial aim was to write something that hid the human story behind the technical format, but there was too much information to get across purely in notes, and one intermediate draft ended up with dozens and dozens of bullet points, and looked very ugly.

* Finally, I gave in and wrote the central discussion as a transcript.  The effect was to reduce the theme of hidden human drama, but it allowed a new theme to develop - the fact that everyone in this situation has something they want to tell someone else, as well as things they want to hide from others, and both communication and lack of communication causes problems.  This is illustrated with relationships between low and high ranking staff (D-13962 and Dr Isaacs), high and high (Dr Isaacs and Site Director Garcia) and low and low (D-13962 and D-4435).  Not totally deliberate, but I like the symmetry.

* As usual, I tried to choose names that didn't make the sex of the various characters obvious, meaning that the interpretation of the various relationships is up to the reader.

* The initial idea came from reading the guides, and a reference to Keter class objects being those that have the highest risk of either human life or Foundation secrecy if they breached containment. 

* For those following along at home, you'll have noticed that this was another Site-73 article.

* [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/sirpudding-s-author-page |sirpudding's]]] poetry skip, 2673, was one of the first things I reviewed on the forums, and definitely opened my eyes to the possibilities in format screws.

* It wasn't until re-reading the skip when sirpudding launched an author page (linked above) and seeing the other contributions, that I remembered how much I wanted to try SCPoetry.

* Even more with poetry than other writing, I find it easiest to work with formal restrictions.  Sonnets are good for this, and other forms of poetry are even better, although I soon realised that I wasn't going to be able to use a standard sonnet rhyme scheme.

* I decided that I really liked the idea of subverting SRAs (found in [[[SCP-2000]]], [[[SCP-2343]]] and [[[SCP-1451]]]) by turning them from a scientific handwave into an anomaly with a horrible backstory.  It also felt like the only thing shown to control reality in the SCPverse is reality benders, so SRAs had to work on a similar basis.  

* This was a slightly quixotic project - I expected a lot of downvotes due to head-canon clashes, and there was a 100+ post discussion in the Drafts forum running through the pros and cons.  What I hadn't expected was the concern that turning a piece of site lore into a mainlist article would stifle creativity of future writers.  I understand that on one level, but I think that it is an objection that can be overcome if the writing is good enough - [[[SCP-748]]] is a recent example.

* Unfortunately in my case the writing wasn't good enough.  Once it was finally posted, it immediately went negative, and spent most of its short life between -7 and -9 before finally tipping into oblivion.  Sample comments:
 * (sirpudding) This still has the (I believe intractable) problems with a general purpose technology used as element in fiction that is supposed to be about special procedures.  Even with a limited supply of SRAs, why are seven active and 14 (!) backup units used on SCP-2343 and not on something that is actually a K-Class waiting to happen? If all of those K-Class Keters have such high Hume differentials that SRAs can't work on them then how is SCP-2000 shielded from them?
 * (Crayne) Can't speak for anyone else, but the reason for my downvote is that I fundamentally believe solidifying elements that should be used to support articles into articles of their own is detrimental to the wiki. "There is no canon is fine" as a throwaway line, but the fact of the matter is that once something like this is written, people will grasp at it to downvote other articles that don't conform to it.
 * (dankaar) There's a reason that the Foundation historically locked them up and never used them (except for that one time). Now you're telling me that the Foundation is putting them in control of an object that amplifies their abilities, and hoping that their treatments won't be overridden because the bender could always simply and easily reverse the surgery. All it takes is one reality-bender to seal part of their mind away so as to not be affected by any fuckery with their brain, and then the Foundation has the largest catastrophe they have ever engineered.
 * (Petrograd) I'm downvoting because this doesn't need to exist, and in its current form does nothing to justify itself in my eyes. It comes across as a takedown or deconstruction of SRAs, and I don't see them being powered by Type Greens with anime-style head sockets as any particular improvement.  Similar to the comments above, you're cementing anomalous mojo to something that exists to be a handwave for Science! that we as readers don't understand. That's removing a central characteristic from a story, and the opposite of interesting to me.

[[[SCP-087]]] - I thought the novel "House of Leaves" was great, and this has much of the best of that book, in a simple, well-delivered package.
@@@@
[[[SCP-1193]]] - a perfect exercise in the uncanny, from someone who not only understands how to do it, but can explain it in a way that I can comprehend.
@@@@
[[[SCP-1893]]] - if you're going to do a format screw, go all the way.  Write 5 different tales, all quite different in general tone, despite having the same dialogue.  Make them all disturbing, to different degrees, but with a consistent throughline.  I got the iterations in order BDECA - I think that might be the perfect way to read this.
@@@@
[[[SCP-1981]]] - pleasantly unsettling.  I don't like re-reading this, which must be a good sign, right?
@@@@
[[[SCP-2188]]] - shows the potential of the form.  Nothing scary here, but more depths of emotion than any other 6 skips put together.
