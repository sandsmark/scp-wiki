[[tab Introduction]]
Welcome to my author page.  Not an in-universe document, I'm afraid - I'm not sure I have sufficient inspiration in that line to create an engaging variation on the theme.  And this will be plenty self-indulgent enough without making up an author insert.
 
But yeah, drop by again some time - I'll update as I remember more narcissistic things to add!  And maybe I'll even fix the formatting to make it more readable.
 
So here's what I've done on the site so far:

I have also contributed a few poems (on 9/9/2015 and 24/12/2015) to the [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2673-containment-maintenance-log |collaborative log]]] for [[[SCP-2673]]].

Here's my sandbox, so you can see what might be coming up next: [http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/psul psul's sandbox]
 
**General thoughts**
 
* I tend to create with a very formulaic methodology.  My ideas are often derivative of something already on the site, and I am also inspired by thinking about in-universe explanations for things that appear on the wiki.
* As a result, my submissions to the site are often meta, format screws or both. The good ones tend to develop in a different direction than where they start.
* Otherwise, I tend to work best by rubbing two ideas together to see if they throw off any sparks.
* I first came across the site via a reference to the Hanged King's Tragedy ([[[SCP-701]]]) in a comments section somewhere else on the interwebs.  That is a pretty good place to start on this site, I would suggest.

**Writing mechanics, spoilers and trivia**
 
In chronological order of posting:

|| **[[[SCP-2130]]]** || **"Office furniture"** || The second SCP idea I had after I joined the site, and one that has thoroughly divided readers. ||
[[collapsible show="+ SCP-2130 Spoilers etc" hide="- collapse"]]
* Update - Drewbear made [[[http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/secretsanta2014 |a recording of the final note]]] from this skip for the Christmas Gift Exchange.  Thanks, Drewbear!

* Spoiler - this was written solely for the purpose of providing an in-universe justification for LolFoundation tropes.  The aim was to go from jokey tone to serious undercurrent - someone is sabotaging the Foundation in an incredibly effective way - and then to an ominous payoff.  Looks like it didn't work for lots of readers.
 
* The biggest criticism was of kappa radiation - a "phlebotinum" way of explaining how the Foundation could know the mechanism of the anomaly (so that it can test for it) but make testing difficult by having background levels of K-rays (so that the skip has some menace to it).  I understand why people objected - I was probably trying to do too much world-building here, and it is kinda reminiscent of Scranton anchors - but I'm not sure whether removing it is the solution, or whether it was just a lightning rod for people who would downvote anyway.  I might try re-writing it to remove the concept at some stage.
 
* The other thing readers objected to was the idea of O5 being compromised.  Again, fair enough, but without that I think the skip doesn't have enough of a sting in the tail.  At least I didn't go with the original ending, which was a further addendum showing that far from being compromised by SCP-2130, the O5 council had in fact deliberately introduced it to Foundation sites as a way to push forward research into anomalies, even at the cost of Foundation lives.  That will not be coming back in any future re-write.
 
* This one dipped pretty quickly to -7, and was looking like being deleted.  I made a few (fairly minor) edits, particularly to the Site Director's note, and that seems to have saved it.  It sat at -1 and 0 net votes for absolutely ages, but will hopefully continue to live in the positives.  That is not a challenge.
 
* I really like the idea of Site-73 - a place with very few living SCPs, so it's like the world's deadliest stationery company - less outlandish and more relatable than other sites.  I will try to set more SCPs there if I can.

|| **[[[SCP-005-J-EX]]]** || **"No, because she thinks he's talking about the…"** || A -J article written as a palate-cleanser, and because the joke was so dumb that I couldn't believe no-one else had done it. ||
[[collapsible show="+ SCP-005-J-EX Spoilers etc" hide="- collapse"]]
* Spoiler - yes, this is just me writing an explanation of an "Explained" "Joke" SCP about explaining jokes.  Yes, that makes me very annoying, and I should stop.
 
* Apart from the punchline of the article, the levels of meta involved were not deliberate, but I definitely enjoyed reading people explain it to one another in the comments.
 
* The other "jokes" referred to in the test logs are of course:
  * "A duck walks into a bar, and says 'Put it on my bill'" - or one of the variations on that set-up.
  * "Knock knock" ... "Don't cry, it's only a ghost."
  * Pick your favourite racist stereotype.
  * Not a joke per se, but the standard "anecdote falls flat without hilarious drunken context".
  * "To get to the other side."

|| **[[[SCP-2136]]]** || **"An utterly driven researcher"** || My most upvoted article so far.  An attempt to write "straightforward horror" that ended up in a format screw, of course. ||
[[collapsible show="+ SCP-2136 Spoilers etc" hide="- collapse"]]
* Spoiler - the pathogen takes over its hosts and can then manipulate their bodies.  By the end of the diary, it has taken over both of the surviving researchers.  It then needs to cover its tracks, but it doesn't yet have the motor control to type clearly, or to input complex passwords - that's the reason for the format screw at the outset.
 
* Headcanon - I like to think that the infection first arrived on the Sentinel Islands because they were looking up at the light from the stars.  I really like the corruption of that usually rather innocent and peaceful activity - I just couldn't work out a way to add it to the diary without it seeming forced. 

* The idea for this one was literally "what would happen if you reversed the effect of [[[SCP-173]]]?"  Leaving aside that [[[SCP-096]]] arguably already does that, it was a pretty stupid idea.  Even once I realised it would work better as an invisible pathogen, I was still thinking about having researcher notes suggesting cross-testing with 173, to see if it could be made immobile both when it was watched and when it was not.  //And// a supervisor's note saying how bad an idea it was, as it might have "precisely the opposite effect".  I'm thankful I didn't go down that path.
 
* The idea to use a diary was the key to unlocking this one.  It allowed me to create a character, who can act as a reader surrogate (note that Dr Heidke's sex/gender is not specified) and can add emotion.  Putting the diary in tabs, rather than drop-downs, was also important, I think, as it kept everything on the same page and kept the reading speed high.
 
* Keeping up a high pace is important for the skip to work (as several people commented), as otherwise suspension of disbelief is liable to collapse here.  I have been very surprised that no-one has called me on any of the following:
  * Can Eta-10 really capture the Indian agents without anyone ever looking at them, or any native Sentinelese?
  * How have the three scientists always managed to stay in visual range of one another for three days?
  * If they are all under quarantine, how does Dr Heidke get access to a new D Class, mirrors etc?
  * Is Dr Fletcher really so unprofessional that he didn't disclose the fact of his having seen inside the containment cell?
  * Does the Foundation not have any ability to communicate with those inside quarantine, so that the message about the breach etc could be sent electronically?  Cognitohazards are a thing, but still!
 
* Once I decided to write this as horror, I was quite methodical about it.  I knew that things needed to escalate, so I needed an incident of graphic violence, then the narrator's experience of freezing (and realisation of the containment breach), then the death of another researcher, then the realisation of being taken over (worse than death).  Things like the personalised horror trope of "when I was nine I almost drowned" felt very artificial to write, as did "LOOOK", but they seem to have (mostly) worked for readers.
 
* One thing I do like about this skip, however, is the fact that the reader can //genuinely// afford to ignore what the strike-through text says.  It doesn't add anything that isn't obvious through the rest of the article - it's the presence of the struck through text that is important.  
 
* Another small thing I like is the way the Foundation captures two government agents of a nuclear power, and has classified them as //D Class// within three days.  That is cold.
 
* One last bit of trivia - to try for verisimilitude in the 0555 entry on Day 5, I typed it with my knuckles.

* Since writing this, I have reflected somewhat on comments that I should have ditched the format screw.  I had those comments throughout the drafting process, and eventually **increased** the obviousness of the screw, rather than removing it.  The reason for having it is this: if the Foundation knows that the pathogen takes over bodies, that would have to be included in the Description, and it spoils the big reveal in the diary.  But the diary contains that reveal, so if the pathogen can edit it out of the Description, it would have to edit the diary as well.  The only way to walk the line and maintain the suspense is for the reader to see this article at that liminal moment between one version and the other - that makes the format screw necessary.  I think that it also helps (a) provide the early hook that incentivises people to keep reading; and (b) add tension and suspense, because the pathogen is neither contained, nor escaped, but is //__just on the verge of escape__//.  That is the point of highest tension in the story.

|| **[[[SCP-2161]]]** || **"Blank space"** || My entry to the Short Works Contest 2015. ||
[[collapsible show="+ SCP-2161 Spoilers etc" hide="- collapse"]]
* The Chinese site has a [[[http://scpfoundation.123ubb.com/t5873-topic |translation of this]]].

* When I first read about the contest (500 word maximum), I didn't have any ideas ready for it.  I decided to take my own advice to newbies, and think about the effect that I wanted to create.  The feeling that I wanted to try to evoke was the existential horror of an empty universe.  I didn't get there, but I would settle for loneliness.  
 
* As it turned out, the ending is rather more hopeful sounding than I originally wrote.  The note started by ending "WE ARE ALONE".  In the forums, it was suggested that was somewhat narmy (a word I had to look up), so I produced about 8 different drafts of the final note.  In the end, I rewrote it again with 30 minutes to go before I entered the contest.  I like the sound of "I will search on" from a purely aesthetic perspective, which was what clinched it.  It probably detracts from the original plan of loneliness (although I think that interpretation is still open), but I also don't mind the idea of human fortitude in the face of impossible odds.  Ah well, the people who thought it was narmy still do, by the sounds of the comments.
 
* I was also inspired (although I wasn't conscious of this until much later) by a comment on the contest discussion thread, asking whether an entry written with no spaces would count as 1 word for contest purposes.  As usual, my brain took that thought and reversed it, thinking about what would happen to the wordcount with *lots* of spaces.

* The second half of this idea came from a deliberate attempt to mimic ophite's "semantic whiplash" - the idea (to paraphrase ophite) of starting with something normal, then contradicting it, and then pile on increasingly insane facts.  To be honest, I didn't even get the first part right (I should have written something like "a collection of sheets of A4 paper, numbering approximately 85 million, which are self-replicating"), but I wanted a bizarre item made up of the everyday, and once the idea for self-replicating blank paper arrived it was too appropriate to the contest not to use it.
 
* Once I had those two ideas (blank paper that increases, the horror of an empty universe) the rest of the SCP almost writes itself.  I needed a connection between the paper and space travel, and eventually just decided to have the skip turn on a dime, with basically no justification, and see if readers would come along for the ride.  
 
* A number of people have commented that the format-screw of having the document itself affected by increasing space is unnecessary.  I disagree.  With the format-screw, the skip illustrates the feeling of isolation that it is intended to describe, adding to the effect.  In particular, the final note gains more power because the visual effect makes it easier to accept the weaker writing.  And of course it is a slight meta-joke that the length of this skip is increased, without rendering it ineligible for the contest on word-count rules (although the separate letters in the final note each count as one word).
 
* Again, a lot of the writing is very deliberate.  Apart from the attempts at disorienting the reader noted above:
  * I have again left Dr Harper's sex/gender unspecified
  * Dr Harper is both a physicist and author, to justify the final note, as well as the space-travel
  * Dr Harper's home is "former" and "abandoned", suggesting that there is no significant other there - again looking to push the theme of loneliness
  * Dr Harper is from Adelaide because I am Australian but not South Australian, and therefore consider Adelaide to be the likely birthplace of the kind of odd dreamer that would create space travel from paper
 
* This was a pain in the neck to write (and especially to amend the final note) - so many spaces to count, and so many @ symbols to stop them being parsed automatically back to single spacing.  Thanks to Crayne for reminding me how to do it.

|| **[[[SCP-2138]]]** || **"Secrets, secrets are no fun..."** || My very first SCP idea - one that took a while to come into focus. ||
[[collapsible show="+ SCP-2138 Spoilers etc" hide="- collapse"]]
* I put my first draft of this on the forums 5 days after joining the site.  I got one piece of feedback at that stage, but I was lucky, because it was from Eskobar ([[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-1213692 |for the record]]]).  Eskobar pulled no punches, and while I had expected direct critique, it was a shock - and probably the best thing that could have happened to me as a first-time writer.  Mostly because Eskobar was right about everything.

* After that, it took a long time to redraft.  My initial aim was to write something that hid the human story behind the technical format, but there was too much information to get across purely in notes, and one intermediate draft ended up with dozens and dozens of bullet points, and looked very ugly.

* Finally, I gave in and wrote the central discussion as a transcript.  The effect was to reduce the theme of hidden human drama (although you'll note that the transcript is a re-hash of the argument, not the argument itself), but it allowed a new theme to develop - the fact that everyone in this situation has something they want to tell someone else, as well as things they want to hide from others, and both communication and lack of communication causes problems.  This is illustrated with relationships between low and high ranking staff (D-13962 and Dr Isaacs), high and high (Dr Isaacs and Site Director Garcia) and low and low (D-13962 and D-4435).  Not totally deliberate, but I like the symmetry.

* As usual, I tried to choose names that didn't make the sex of the various characters obvious, meaning that the interpretation of the various relationships is up to the reader.

* The initial idea came from reading the guides, and a reference to Keter class objects being those that have the highest risk of either human life __or Foundation secrecy__ if they breached containment. 

* For those following along at home, you'll have noticed that this was another Site-73 article.

|| **[[[SCP-2673]]]** || **"Sonnet Containment Poem"** || A collaboration page contribution in the form of a poem or two. ||
[[collapsible show="+ Poem Spoilers etc" hide="- collapse"]]
* [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/sirpudding-s-author-page |sirpudding's]]] poetry skip, 2673, was one of the first things I reviewed on the forums, and definitely opened my eyes to the possibilities in format screws.

* It wasn't until re-reading the skip when sirpudding launched an author page (linked above) and seeing the other contributions, that I remembered how much I wanted to try SCPoetry.

* Even more with poetry than other writing, I find it easiest to work with formal restrictions.  Sonnets are good for this, although I soon realised that I wasn't going to be able to use a standard sonnet rhyme scheme, because other forms of poetry are even better.  

* Spoiler: the highlighted letters spell "two six seven three" - that wasn't deliberate, just something I realised might be possible after I saw the w, x and v there.  

* Spoiler: this is actually two poems, not one.  No-one has mentioned it, despite every comment I've made about the poem (as well as the first two lines of the poem itself) including at least some hint.  Impressively, the Chinese translation was the first place I saw that picked it up!

* The second poem I added was after seeing a few Christmas-related tales which referred to the famous Night Before Christmas poem (called "A Visit From St Nicholas").  I looked it up on wikipedia, and found that [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Visit_from_St._Nicholas#Authorship_controversy |its authorship is the subject of some controversy]]].  On reading the biographical details of the authors, I wondered whether writing SCP-2673 into the history of some famous poets could be a new angle for the containment log (as simply referring to the basics of containment had been covered well by the existing entries).

* Clearly this poem takes incredible liberties with the historical record, and I don't mean to suggest that their Livingston or Moore were anything like the way I've portrayed them.  But I was struck by how easily the symptoms of the Hunter's infection - impulsive statements, decadent urges, distrust of leaders - lined up with some of the biographical facts.  It was quite fun to write in that regard, although I'm not sure I quite captured the rhythm of the original.

|| **[[[A-fairy-tale]]]** || **"The Little Buck-Toothed Boy: A Fairy Tale"** || Here's one I prepared earlier... ||
[[collapsible show="+ Tale Spoilers etc" hide="- collapse"]]
* Wow, Randomini [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/advent-calendar-2015 |did a reading of this Tale]]] - see 5 December.  Thanks Randomini - that's awesome!

* I wrote this a long time before ever joining the site (probably around 2009 or so).  A friend wanted to set up a collaborative writing exercise by email between a group of her friends, and I was interested.  The first suggestion was to write a fairy tale - I think it needed to contain tulips, an old man and ... something else.  As far as I'm aware, I'm the only person who responded, and I think it's generally accepted that I ruined the exercise for everyone else.  I had been thinking that in the environment of group writing, there was likely to be a race to break down formalist structures, to push the boundaries etc - leading to a whole load of pointless one-upmanship.  So I figured I would do my best to destroy the fourth wall at the first time of asking, to circumvent that process.  What can I say, I was a smartarse.

* It wasn't until months after joining the site that I remembered writing this, and thought that the tone might fit, at least as a creepypasta.  I put it through a few rounds of edits, but the essentials are the same as the original.  I looked hard for a connection to an existing SCP to make this into a Tale, but couldn't see anything obvious.  The bear's speech about putting things in boxes feels like a connection, but was actually in the original!

|| **[[[SCP-2162]]]** and **[[[Figure and Ground]]]** || **"... as normal as blueberry pie"** / **"Figure and Ground"** || It's a long story... ||
[[collapsible show="+ SCP-2162 and Tale Spoilers etc" hide="- collapse"]]
* This is certainly my most ambitious attempt to date.  It's my first attempt at Keter-class.  It's my first use of a GoI.  It uses two existing characters, and refers obliquely to another SCP entry.  And it juggles five named characters with speaking roles, and a sixth (Rob Baker) who is arguably the protagonist despite not appearing in person.  I tried to take a long time over this, and in many ways it's the work I'm proudest of.

* Again, this came about from the intersection of two ideas:
 * I wanted to write a Keter, and I hadn't seen many of those that consisted of gases.  However, a gas is relatively easy to contain (just vaccuum it up!) so I realised what I wanted was a spatial volume that consisted of deadly gas, and mobile, so it's almost impossible to contain.
 * The second idea came from a forum post somewhere suggesting that GoIs must have interactions with each other, not just the Foundation.  I thought that Marshall, Carter & Dark must have members that want to commission anomalous art, and that MC&D must have approached Are We Cool Yet? on that basis.  I couldn't imagine AWCY? working for The Man, so wondered how this would play out, and decided that a kid wanting to make a mark would be a perfect mark for MC&D.
 * When I was looking for coloured gases that could form my anomaly, I realised that there aren't very many.  I had thought Bromine was an option, but it's not a gas at room temperature.  I had actually looked up "bromide" by accident, and that means something quite different - once I learned that, it linked in my brain to the lyrics "bromidic and bright" from the "South Pacific" musical, and I realised how weird a description that was.  I had always thought "bromidic" just meant "happy in a slightly dazed way".  
 * That's when the two halves of the idea clicked together - what if someone commissioned anart, wanting a "bromidic" smile, but instead asked for bromine.  Then the artist tried to make it, but bromine doesn't work as a gas, so used nitrogen instead.  The result - a giant, invisible smiley face, made of killer gas.

* The above is the reason for the title - the whole thing came about because of the MC&D client's love of "South Pacific".  And clearly Rob Baker's reality bending is somehow verbal/conceptual in nature, because his giant smile travelled straight to the South Pacific, and is now heading westwards to Denpasar (Bali-hai!).  My headcanon is that once it gets there, it will either stop or dissipate.

* I gave myself the challenge of writing this as a procedural - no explanatory notes, just investigation by the Foundation.  I also knew that the investigation couldn't produce Rob Baker at the end of it, because that might allow the anomaly to be neutralised.  I asked both [[*user Randomini]] and [[*user TwistedGears]] for permission to use their characters (each of whom had investigated anart in other stories) and was pleasantly surprised when they both gave me the okay.  I then couldn't decide on which character would work best, and ended up going with both.  [[*user Rioghail]] also gave me permission to use the name "Michael Cavendish" from [[[SCP-2071]]].

* As I wrote, I realised that I was attempting to tell the story of Rob Baker without him ever appearing.  It then hit me that this approach to writing was somewhat like Agent Green's approach to SCP-2162 - revealing the nature of something by colouring the negative space around it.  I looked for other ways to work that in - to be blatantly expository, the idea was to have Rob Baker's story as the ground and the procedural be the figure.

* One of the ways in which I feel I best achieved that figure/ground juxtaposition is in the nature of the story itself.  By the end of the supplements, the Agents are off the case, and an innocent girl is being held captive by the "bad guys".  Is that the end of the story (in which case this is //Chinatown//) or is it merely the end of the story that exists on the Foundation's records, and A-D Griffiths forcing the Agents off the case is just the end of Act II of a buddy-cop movie?  The reader's understanding of the story is based on how they interpret the context of the characters' actions, and how they interpret the characters themselves.  The final question - would no-one come? - is rhetorical in more than just the sense that June's asking it to herself. It is me as author asking it of the audience - what image do you see in this picture?

* Originally this was a single SCP article (without the bookend sections to what is now the supplement), but I was worried about its length earning downvotes.  Splitting it was a compromise decision, and the risk is that the reveal of the shape of the anomaly at the end of the SCP article is not enough to be considered a complete story on its own.  Reviews have been mixed on that - although at least one reviewer whose opinion I respect thought that the story as a whole still wasn't interesting enough for them.  So for now, it stays split.

* One final thought - no-one has commented that I threw in a reference to "aggressive-looking mobile knitwear" in the Field Diary.  It's the anti-[[[SCP-2991 |Scarf]]]!

@@@@
|| **[[[Exit Interview]]]** || **"Exit Interview"** || An attempt at a dialogue-driven tale.||
[[collapsible show="+ Tale Spoilers etc" hide="- collapse"]]
* This was written originally as a way to practice writing dialogue.  I wanted to see if I could write a dialogue-heavy tale with sufficiently realistic dialogue and still keep things interesting.

* The first thing that came to me was the opening paragraph.  "When they finally came for [x]" is a very commonly used phrase, but it is quite a good one.  And as an opening line, it pulls the reader in - it sets up all sorts of narrative and backstory immediately (who are they?  why did they come?).  Then I wondered why they had come, and my usual aim of justifying wiki-centric issues (the non-consecutive numbering) with in-universe solutions came to the fore.

* Then I realised that it was going to work as a job interview, with an introduction to a new department - a bit like an Orientation Tale, but instead of a monologue, it would be a dialogue (or perhaps more accurately two monologues intercut with each other).

* I wrote the whole thing out, and very little changed over the 5 months it took me to finalise it.  The sticking point was the ending - from the first draft I knew it wasn't right, but I couldn't work out the fix.
 * The first ending involved Dr. Parkes telling Agent Andrew O'Connor that he had gone too far, and killing him via infohazards in the walls.  But that felt like a let-down.
 * Chat feedback was that I should emphasise the meta element, so the second ending involved Agent Martin Stewart meekly compromising his ideals and accepting a job with the MRD under threat of death, with Dr. Parkes explicitly referring to his superiors having cast 3 votes for neutralisation, and Agent "Call me Marty" Stewart much more obviously a Marty-Stew character.  But that never really gelled, even once I toyed with making it Agent Mary Sue.
 * After leaving the idea alone for a few weeks, I did my usual trick of thinking about reversing the situation, and (what was in retrospect) an obvious ending suggested itself.  There had been so many reversals of the power balance in the interview, but Dr. Parkes had always been more-or-less in control.  So why doesn't the agent overturn that balance entirely?  And as soon as I realised that, I also had a snappy closing line ready-made.   I am quite pleased with the final form, and it justifies having left it for so long and not trying to push it to publication before it was ready - it became my most upvoted tale within 12 hours of posting.

* Key to this working is the sense of the shifting power balance, which keeps the reader moving forward through heavy exposition throughout.  In an attempt to assist that forward momentum, I tried to strip back the description and set the whole thing in an empty room, with just enough visuals to keep a mental picture alive.

|| **[[[Letters from Benares]]]** || **"Letters from Benares"** || A Merry Sarkic-Christmas Gift Tale.||
[[collapsible show="+ Tale Spoilers etc" hide="- collapse"]]
* This tale was my offering to the Christmas Gift Exchange 2015.  I recommend the exchange to anyone interested - it's a great way to make someone's day, and a good challenge in producing writing without having complete control over the topic.

* I was asked to write something for MrWrong, who had requested either something about one of his SCPs, or about Sarkicism.  Well, I knew that [[[SCP-2833]]] was MrWrong's article about Sarkicism, so that seemed like a good place to start.

* I had quite a lot of reading up to do on Sarkicism (and I'd not read [[[SCP-610]]] either) so I spent a few hours doing that first up.  I realised that I might not have the skill to pull off the full body horror of Sarkicism, so I decided on working by implication instead.  And the idea of a young innocent being slowly corrupted by a 2833 instance felt right.

* As MrWrong mentioned when he read it, the 2833 instance here seems much more logical than the unstable examples from the SCP article itself.  I'm going to rely on the time-jump for that - I figure there would be some left in Edwardian times that were convincingly human.  Although I note that the plan is pretty opportunistic, rather than long-term - the instance has simply found a trusting, naive set of hosts (unlike the suspicious locals) and immediately twisted them to the Flesh, regardless of the consequences.

* Finally, the character of Emily Cavanagh is one that I'd like to return to if possible.  I imagine her as being friendly, but hard as nails when required, and whatever actually happened on her church excursion to the South Downs, I don't think it was all tea and crumpets.

* I decided that I really liked the idea of subverting SRAs (found in [[[SCP-2000]]], [[[SCP-2343]]] and [[[SCP-1451]]], as well as [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/and-this-one-explains-humes |these]]] [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/an-faq-part-two-or-your-hume-questions-answered |tales]]]) by turning them from a scientific handwave into an anomaly with a horrible backstory.  It also felt like the only thing shown to control reality in the SCPverse is reality benders, so SRAs had to work on a similar basis.  

* This was a slightly quixotic project - I expected a lot of downvotes due to head-canon clashes, and there was a 100+ post discussion in the Drafts forum running through the pros and cons.  What I hadn't expected was the concern that turning a piece of site lore into a mainlist article would stifle creativity of future writers.  I understand that on one level, but I think that it is an objection that can be overcome if the writing is good enough - [[[SCP-748]]] is a recent example.

* Unfortunately in my case the writing wasn't good enough.  Once it was finally posted, it immediately went negative, and spent most of its short life between -7 and -9 before finally tipping into oblivion.  Sample comments:
 * [[*user sirpudding]]: This still has the (I believe intractable) problems with a general purpose technology used as element in fiction that is supposed to be about special procedures.  Even with a limited supply of SRAs, why are seven active and 14 (!) backup units used on SCP-2343 and not on something that is actually a K-Class waiting to happen? If all of those K-Class Keters have such high Hume differentials that SRAs can't work on them then how is SCP-2000 shielded from them?
 * [[*user Crayne]]: Can't speak for anyone else, but the reason for my downvote is that I fundamentally believe solidifying elements that should be used to support articles into articles of their own is detrimental to the wiki. "There is no canon is fine" as a throwaway line, but the fact of the matter is that once something like this is written, people will grasp at it to downvote other articles that don't conform to it.
 * [[*user dankaar]]: There's a reason that the Foundation historically locked them up and never used them (except for that one time). Now you're telling me that the Foundation is putting them in control of an object that amplifies their abilities, and hoping that their treatments won't be overridden because the bender could always simply and easily reverse the surgery. All it takes is one reality-bender to seal part of their mind away so as to not be affected by any fuckery with their brain, and then the Foundation has the largest catastrophe they have ever engineered.
 * [[*user Petrograd]]: I'm downvoting because this doesn't need to exist, and in its current form does nothing to justify itself in my eyes. It comes across as a takedown or deconstruction of SRAs, and I don't see them being powered by Type Greens with anime-style head sockets as any particular improvement.  Similar to the comments above, you're cementing anomalous mojo to something that exists to be a handwave for Science! that we as readers don't understand. That's removing a central characteristic from a story, and the opposite of interesting to me.

* The image I used was a cross section of a theodolite - drawn for consistency with the (since-deleted) Short Works Contest SCP that illustrated SRAs with a theodolite.  Possibly in a fit of defiance, or possibly just because it was the only image to hand when I finally got sick of that smiley, I have adopted this SRA image as my user avatar.

**A very short list of other authors' SCPs that I particularly enjoy**
 
[[[SCP-087]]] - I thought the novel "House of Leaves" was great, and this has much of the best of that book, in a simple, well-delivered package.
@@@@
[[[SCP-1193]]] - a perfect exercise in the uncanny, from someone who not only understands how to do it, but can explain how to do it in a way that I can comprehend.
@@@@
[[[SCP-1893]]] - if you're going to do a format screw, go all the way.  Write 5 different tales, all quite different in general tone, despite having the same dialogue.  Make them all disturbing, to different degrees, but with a consistent throughline.  I got the iterations in order BDECA - I think that might be the perfect way to read this.
@@@@
[[[SCP-1981]]] - pleasantly unsettling.  I don't like re-reading this, which must be a good sign, right?
@@@@
[[[SCP-2188]]] - shows the potential of the form.  Nothing scary here, but more depths of emotion than any other 6 skips put together.
@@@@
[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/unforgettable-that-s-what-you-are |Unforgettable, That's What You Are]]] - qntm's Antimemetics tales constitute one of the best-realised series on the site.  You should really start at the beginning, but this one is the best of the lot.  Beautiful prose, in the service of a clever, thrilling narrative.  Absolutely inspiring.
