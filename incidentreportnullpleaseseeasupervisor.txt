> **Incident 2770-C**
> 
> With approval from O5-█, Operation Kiddie Pool was authorized on ██/██/████ with the express purpose of containing SCP-2770 indefinitely. This operation was designed by Dr. ████ and Agent ████████, as they theorized that from observations made of SCP-2770-1, divorcing it from any notable source of water would both render SCP-2770-2 incapable of manifesting, and remove SCP-2770-1's ability to retreat back into the water.
> 
> The operation was divided into three parts:
> 
> # Gamma-6 would locate and then lift SCP-2770-1 from the water via a modified Mi-26 (operating name: "Lifeguard") equipped with a hooking device created specifically for the operation.
> # With SCP-2770-1 hooked, Lifeguard would then transport SCP-2770-1 to Site ██, a secure location in the hyper-arid ████████ Desert.
> # Once arrived, Gamma-6 personnel would take custody of SCP-2770-1, well isolated from any possible source of water.
> 
> On █/█/████, Operation Kiddie Pool commenced at ████ hours. At the time of the operation, SCP-2770-1 was being tracked off the coast of Iceland, and was intercepted by Lifeguard thirty minutes, twelve seconds after the commencement of the operation. SCP-2770-1 was attached to the hook without any difficulties and lifted out of the water with no appearance by SCP-2770-2.
> 
> Six hours, seventeen minutes later, Lifeguard arrived at Site ██, delivering SCP-2770-1 into its custody. SCP-2770-1 surrendered itself with no struggle, and SCP-2770-2 failed to manifest. Operation Kiddie Pool was deemed a success.
> 
> 
> 
> An interrogation was conducted one week later. SCP-2770-1 had not escaped custody with its previously recorded anomalous abilities, and had been generally cooperative with staff at Site ██. Transcript of video will now follow:
> 
> [SCP-2770-1 is escorted into the room by two Gamma-6 personnel and sits down to a chair across from Agent ████████]
> 
> **Agent ████████:** Hello, SCP-2770-1.
> 
> **SCP-2770-1:** Hello, sir. Once again, I cannot tell you how grateful I am for the rescue with your crazy hoverin' plane. I've been stranded out there for...I don't know how long.
> 
> **Agent ████████:** We're always glad to help. So, SCP-2770-1, do you have a name?
> 
> **SCP-2770-1:** I do, sir. Lieutenant Edward Rowling, British Royal Navy.
> 
> **Agent ████████:**  I see. What year do you think this is? Your uniform is quite out of date.
> 
> **SCP-2770-1:** [rubs neck] I...don't rightly know. Truth be told, the months and years just started to meld together after a while. And apologies about my uniform, I'll admit it's seen better days.
> 
> **Agent ████████:** About your days melding together. What can you tell me about SCP-2770-2?
> 
> **SCP-2770-1:** Come again?
> 
> **Agent ████████:** The submarine. We have records of you being rescued by ships, only for them to be attacked by a broken-down sub that shouldn't even be able to move. 
> 
> **SCP-2770-1:** Oh. //That thing.//
> 
> [SCP-2770-1 leans in]
> 
> **SCP-2770-1:** Well.
> 
> **SCP-2770-1:** I think...
> 
> **Agent ████████:** You think what?
> 
> **SCP-2770-1:** I think you forgot about the water table, you fucking idiot.
> 
> [What appears to be a conning tower of SCP-2770-2 erupts in the middle of the interrogation room. The hatch immediately opens, followed by a total loss of communication with Site ██.]
> 
> **END TRANSCRIPT**

> MTF dispatched to Site ██ finds the facility missing. Orbital assets confirm that at the time of communication loss, Site ██ was pulled in its entirety under the sand. Recovery teams present detect no traces of Site ██ with subterranean imaging, and all staff are presumed KIA.
> 
> After this event, SCP-2770-1 did not appear for another █ years.
> 
> Foundation secure site protocols now in full review. 
> 
> SCP-2770 reclassification to Keter pending.
> 
> **END INCIDENT REPORT**
