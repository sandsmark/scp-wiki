------

**Player:** Dr. Lindquist
**Statement:** "Sunday night football."
**Result:** SCP-1459-1 remained unharmed for four (4) days, during which time it was provided with food and water. At 8:30 PM CDT the following evening, SCP-1459 produced a football cleat attached to a hydraulic kicking mechanism which knocked SCP-1459 into the front window at high speed. 

**Player:** Dr. Lindquist
**Statement:** "Matricide."
**Result:** Despite being a juvenile, SCP-1459-1 displayed behavior consistent with a mature canine going into labor. Half an hour later, three (3) unidentified creatures resembling crustaceans emerged from SCP-1459's vagina and proceeded to pull apart and consume the SCP-1459 instance.

**Player:** Dr. Reich
**Statement:** "Mutiny at sea."
**Result:** SCP-1459's chamber was  partially flooded with water, and a small wooden raft was produced with two additional instances of SCP-1459-1. The original instance of SCP-1459-1 was provided with a small tri-cornered cap, and began to bark aggressively at the other two instances. Both instances appeared to nod towards each other before pouncing on the original instance and forcing it underwater. The raft then capsized, causing the additional instances to drown after 8 minutes.

**Player:** Dr. Iqbal
**Statement:** "Assassination."
**Result:** Robotic arm descends from SCP-1459's hatch and places a stovepipe hat scaled to fit a juvenile canine upon SCP-1459-1's head. Several other robotic arms then emerge armed with a variety of implements and weaponry, and proceed to stab SCP-1459-1 multiple times, bludgeon it, and orally administer at least thirteen different substances in a forcible manner (one of which confirmed by laboratory equipment as polonium-210). While SCP-1459-1 appears to be deceased immediately following this activity, a single robotic arm lowers from hatch three minutes later carrying a rifle, which is then used to shoot SCP-1459-1 in the cranial area. Despite the presence of a single firearm and only one documented shot fired, a second bullet hole in SCP-1459-1's head spontaneously appears during this time.


**Player:** Dr. Nark
**Statement:** “My 1337 skills.”
**Result:** An empty television frame attached to a robotic arm descended from SCP-1459’s hatch alongside SCP-1459-1. SCP-1459-1 was placed behind the television frame from the perspective of Dr. Nark. A second robotic arm carrying a Type-95 assault rifle descended in front of the television frame. SCP-1459-1 was fired at through the television frame until expiration.
