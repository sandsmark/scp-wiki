------

**Player:** Dr. Lindquist
**Statement:** "Sunday night football."
**Result:** SCP-1459-1 remained unharmed for four (4) days, during which time it was provided with food and water. At 8:30 PM CDT the following evening, SCP-1459 produced a football cleat attached to a hydraulic kicking mechanism which knocked SCP-1459 into the front window at high speed. 

**Player:** Dr. Lindquist
**Statement:** "Matricide."
**Result:** Despite being a juvenile, SCP-1459-1 displayed behavior consistent with a mature canine going into labor. Half an hour later, three (3) unidentified creatures resembling crustaceans emerged from SCP-1459's vagina and proceeded to pull apart and consume the SCP-1459 instance.

**Player:** Dr. Reich
**Statement:** "Mutiny at sea."
**Result:** SCP-1459's chamber was partially flooded with water, and a small wooden raft was produced with two additional instances of SCP-1459-1. The original instance of SCP-1459-1 was provided with a small tri-cornered cap, and began to bark aggressively at the other two instances. Both instances appeared to nod towards each other before pouncing on the original instance and forcing it underwater. The raft then capsized, causing the additional instances to drown after 8 minutes.

**Player:** Dr. Iqbal
**Statement:** "Assassination."
**Result:** A robotic arm descended from SCP-1459's hatch and placed a stovepipe hat scaled to fit a juvenile canine upon SCP-1459-1's head. Several other robotic arms then emerged armed with a variety of implements and weaponry, and proceeded to stab SCP-1459-1 multiple times, bludgeon it, and orally administer at least thirteen different substances in a forcible manner (one of which confirmed by laboratory equipment as polonium-210). While SCP-1459-1 appeared to be deceased immediately following this activity, a single robotic arm lowered from hatch three minutes later carrying a rifle, which was then used to shoot SCP-1459-1 in the cranial area. Despite the presence of a single firearm and only one documented shot fired, a second bullet hole in SCP-1459-1's head spontaneously appeared during this time.

**Player:** Dr. Nark
**Statement:** “My 1337 skills.”
**Result:** An empty television frame attached to a robotic arm descended from SCP-1459’s hatch alongside SCP-1459-1. SCP-1459-1 was placed behind the television frame from the perspective of Dr. Nark. A second robotic arm carrying a Type-95 assault rifle descended in front of the television frame. SCP-1459-1 was fired at through the television frame until expiration.

**Player:** Dr. Damm
**Statement:** "Dog fighting."
**Result:** A miniature airplane was lowered into SCP-1459 by a robotic arm. The airplane was a single-seat open-cockpit biplane with miniaturized machine guns mounted to the wings, and the side of the plane was adorned with the French flag; the plane was scaled down so that its cockpit was properly sized for an pre-adolescent canine. The robotic arm then placed SCP-1459-1 into the plane's cockpit, after which the plane began to fly around the interior chamber. After one minute, SCP-1459's hatch opened and a second miniature airplane, piloted by a second instance of SCP-1459-1, flew into the chamber. This airplane was identical to the first, except it displayed the flag of the German Empire rather than the French flag. The two airplanes circled around each other for three minutes. After several near-collisions, the French airplane opened fire on the German airplane, damaging one of its wings. The German airplane fired back at the French airplane, shooting the plane down and killing the first SCP-1459-1 instance in the process. The German airplane then crashed, presumably due to the damage it had sustained, killing the second SCP-1459-1 instance.

**Player:** Dr. Talan
**Statement:** "Surprise me."
**Result:** SCP-1459 remained inactive for approximately 15 minutes. During the period of inactivity, SCP-1459-1 began moving in an agitated manner within SCP-1459. The instance was observed to look repeatedly towards the hatch in SCP-1459's ceiling. At the end of the 15 minute inactive period, the SCP-1459's hatch opened. SCP-1459-1 stopped all movement and sat down, staring fixedly at the hatch. Dr. Talan was observed to step closer to the observation windows, also staring at the hatch. After another five minutes of inactivity, a series of loud noises, bright lights, and frightening images typical of 'screamer' viruses and images emanated from the hatch in rapid succession. SCP-1459-1 jumped approximately 30 cm into the air before collapsing. Dr. Talan clutched his chest above his heart before collapsing and going into cardiac arrest. After 30 seconds of inactivity, one robotic arm was lowered into SCP-1459. It then prodded the instance of SCP-1459-1 twice before the instance fell through the trapdoor in the floor.
**Notes:** //Dr. Talan is expected to make a full recovery. Additionally, SCP-1459 dispensed two tablets determined to be B████ brand aspirin rather than a cookie.//

**Player:** Dr. Edison
**Statement:** "Immortality."
**Result:** A mechanical arm pulled SCP-1459-1 into the ceiling hatch. Pained vocalizations were heard from SCP-1459-1 for approximately thirty minutes, followed by another thirty minutes of silence. The hatch opened a second time and SCP-1459-1 was lowered back into the chamber, preserved through taxidermy and displayed on a stand with a small plaque reading "Our Hero".

**Player:** Dr. King
**Statement:** "Zero Gravity"
**Result:** SCP-1459-1 was suffocated under a tremendous pile of appleseeds.
//Why did I expect anything different to happen?// -Dr. King

**Player:** Dr. Edison
**Statement:** "Are We Cool Yet?"
**Result:** [DATA EXPUNGED] leaving the corpse of the SCP-1459-1 instance suspended in mid-air, orbiting the singing head of Abraham Lincoln. 

**Player:** Jr. Researcher Kitterman
**Statement:** "Firing Squad."
**Result:** German Shepherd instance of SCP-1459-1 emerged tied to a post. A blind fold was affixed and a cigarette inserted into the corner of its mouth and lit. Five additional Pit Bull Terrier SCP-1459-1 instances emerged in uniforms consistent with those use by American Expeditionary Forces in WWI, carrying miniature rifles. One instance barked three times (presumably to indicate "ready, aim, fire") as the remaining four fired at the restrained instance, killing it.
**Note:** //Taps// was played over the normal closing statement during clean up.

**Player:** Dr. Laries
**Statement:** “Complete knowledge of the Universe.”
**Result:** A small bucket labeled "B█████ ██ █████" was lowered into SCP-1459. SCP-1459-1 walked over to the bucket, looked inside, and began to whine and cry. It then ran away from the bucket while still whining, smashing headfirst into one of SCP-1459's observation windows, resulting in its death.

**Player:** Dr. Harper
**Statement:** "Poker."
**Result:** Five additional instances of SCP-1459-1 were dispensed, along with a miniature poker table and chips. Each instance gathered around the table and proceeded to play a game of poker. Instances that lost all their chips were promptly beaten to death with a fireplace poker. After the game, the winner was given a treat and promptly beaten to death with a gold-painted fireplace poker.
**Note:** SCP-1459 dispensed 6 cigars rather than a cookie.

**Player**: Dr. Deed
**Statement**: “A previously used method”
**Result**: A 1958 General Electric television set fell on SCP-1459-1. The set then powered on and replayed the event.
**Note**: Only half a cookie was dispensed.

**Player**: Dr. Deed
**Statement**: “A previously used method” (second try)
**Result**: SCP-1459 played a sound effect indicating the method of extermination had been previously used.
**Note**: SCP-1459 played a pre-recorded message asking for its half a cookie back.

**Player**: Researcher Prescott
**Statement**: “Absolute Zero”
**Result**: Two robotic arms came out of the hatch carrying a table with a digital thermometer securely placed on top of it. Soon afterwards, the chamber’s temperature started to drop quickly. One hour after reaching 0.01 K without further changes, SCP-1459-1 was bludgeoned and shattered into many pieces.
**Note**: No cookie was dispensed.

**Player**: Researcher Wu
**Statement**: “Nothing”
**Result**: SCP-1459-1 exhibited symptoms similar to explosive decompression and expired.

**Player**: Dr. M.
**Statement**: “This is gold!”
**Result**: SCP-1459-1 began to convulse and slowly turned to pure gold.
**Note**: A vanilla cookie was dispensed, trace amounts of copper within.
