------

**Player:** Dr. Lindquist
**Statement:** "Sunday night football."
**Result:** SCP-1459-1 remained unharmed for four (4) days, during which time it was provided with food and water. At 8:30 PM CDT the following evening, SCP-1459 produced a football cleat attached to a hydraulic kicking mechanism which knocked SCP-1459 into the front window at high speed. 

**Player:** Dr. Lindquist
**Statement:** "Matricide."
**Result:** Despite being a juvenile, SCP-1459-1 displayed behavior consistent with a mature canine going into labor. Half an hour later, three (3) unidentified creatures resembling crustaceans emerged from SCP-1459's vagina and proceeded to pull apart and consume the SCP-1459 instance.

**Player:** Dr. Reich
**Statement:** "Mutiny at sea."
**Result:** SCP-1459's chamber was  partially flooded with water, and a small wooden raft was produced with two additional instances of SCP-1459-1. The original instance of SCP-1459-1 was provided with a small tri-cornered cap, and began to bark aggressively at the other two instances. Both instances appeared to nod towards each other before pouncing on the original instance and forcing it underwater. The raft then capsized, causing the additional instances to drown after 8 minutes.

**Player:** Dr. Iqbal
**Statement:** "Assassination."
**Result:** Robotic arm descends from SCP-1459's hatch and places a stovepipe hat scaled to fit a juvenile canine upon SCP-1459-1's head. Several other robotic arms then emerge armed with a variety of implements and weaponry, and proceed to stab SCP-1459-1 multiple times, bludgeon it, and orally administer at least thirteen different substances in a forcible manner (one of which confirmed by laboratory equipment as polonium-210). While SCP-1459-1 appears to be deceased immediately following this activity, a single robotic arm lowers from hatch three minutes later carrying a rifle, which is then used to shoot SCP-1459-1 in the cranial area. Despite the presence of a single firearm and only one documented shot fired, a second bullet hole in SCP-1459-1's head spontaneously appears during this time.

**Player:** Dr. Nark
**Statement:** “My 1337 skills.”
**Result:** An empty television frame attached to a robotic arm descended from SCP-1459’s hatch alongside SCP-1459-1. SCP-1459-1 was placed behind the television frame from the perspective of Dr. Nark. A second robotic arm carrying a Type-95 assault rifle descended in front of the television frame. SCP-1459-1 was fired at through the television frame until expiration.

**Player:** Dr. Damm
**Statement:** "Dog fighting."
**Result:** A miniature airplane is lowered into SCP-1459 by a robotic arm. The airplane is a single-seat open-cockpit biplane with miniaturized machine guns mounted to the wings, and the side of the plane is adorned with the French flag; the plane is scaled down so that its cockpit is properly sized for an pre-adolescent canine. The robotic arm then places SCP-1459-1 into the plane's cockpit, after which the plane takes off and begins flying around SCP-1459. After one minute, SCP-1459's hatch opens and a second miniature airplane, piloted by a second instance of SCP-1459-1, flies into the chamber. This airplane is identical to the first, but displays the flag of the German Empire rather than the French flag. The two airplanes circle around each other for three minutes. After several near-collisions, the French airplane opens fire on the German airplane, damaging one of its wings. The German airplane fires back at the French airplane, shooting the plane down and killing the first SCP-1459-1 instance in the process. The German airplane then crashes, presumably due to the damage it had sustained, killing the second SCP-1459-1 instance.

**Player:** Dr. Talan
**Statement:** "Surprise me."
**Result:** SCP-1459 remains inactive for approximately 15 minutes. During the period of inactivity, SCP-1459-1 begins moving in an agitated manner within SCP-1459. The instance is observed to look repeatedly towards the hatch in SCP-1459's ceiling. At the end of the 15 minute inactive period, the SCP-1459's hatch opens. SCP-1459-1 stops all movement and sits down, staring fixedly at the hatch. Dr. Talan is observed to step closer to the observation windows, also staring at the hatch. After another five minutes of inactivity, a series of loud noises, bright lights, and frightening images typical of 'screamer' viruses and images emanates from the hatch in rapid succession. SCP-1459-1 is observed to jump approximately 30 cm into the air before collapsing. Dr. Talan is observed to clutch his chest above his heart before collapsing and going into cardiac arrest. After 30 seconds of inactivity, one robotic arm is lowered into SCP-1459. It then pokes the instance of SCP-1459-1 twice before the instance falls through the trapdoor in the floor.
**Notes:** //Dr. Talan is expected to make a full recovery. Additionally, SCP-1459 dispensed two tablets determined to be B████ brand asprin rather than a cookie.//

**Player:** Dr. Edison
**Statement:** "Immortality."
**Result:** Mechanical arm pulls SCP-1459-1 into the ceiling hatch. Pained vocalizations are heard from SCP-1459-1 for approximately thirty minutes, followed by another thirty minutes of silence. Hatch opens a second time, and arm lowers SCP-1459-1, now preserved through taxidermy and displayed on a stand with a little plaque that says "Our Hero".

**Player:** Dr. King
**Statement:** "Zero Gravity"
**Result:** Ceiling hatch opens, and SCP-1459-1 is suffocated under a tremendous pile of appleseeds.
//Why did I expect anything different to happen?// -Dr. King

**Player:** Dr. Edison
**Statement:** "Are We Cool Yet?"
**Result:** [DATA EXPUNGED] leaving the corpse of the SCP-1459-1 instance suspended in mid-air, orbiting the singing head of Abraham Lincon. 

**Player:** Jr. Researcher Kitterman
**Statement:** "Firing Squad."
**Result:** German Shepherd instance of SCP-1459-1 emerges tied to a post. A blind fold is affixed and a cigarette is inserted into the corner of its mouth and lit. Five additional Pit Bull Terrier SCP-1459-1 instances emerge in uniforms consistent with those use by American Expeditionary Forces in WWI, carrying miniature rifles. One instance barks to indicate "ready, aim, fire" as the remaining four fire at the restrained instance, killing it.
**Note:** //Taps// is played over the normal closing statement during clean up.

**Player:** Dr. Laries
**Statement:** “Complete knowledge of the Universe.”
**Result:** A small bucket labeled "B█████ ██ █████" is lowered into SCP-1459. SCP-1459-1 walks over to the bucket, looks inside, and begins to whine and cry. It then runs away from the bucket while still whining, and smashes headfirst into one of SCP-1459's observation windows, resulting in its death.
