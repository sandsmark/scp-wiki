------

**Player:** Dr. Lindquist
**Statement:** "Sunday night football."
**Result:** SCP-1459-1 remained unharmed for four (4) days, during which time it was provided with food and water. At 8:30 PM CDT the following evening, SCP-1459 produced a football cleat attached to a hydraulic kicking mechanism which knocked SCP-1459-1 into the front window at high speed. 

**Player:** Dr. Lindquist
**Statement:** "Matricide."
**Result:** Despite being a juvenile, SCP-1459-1 displayed behavior consistent with a mature canine going into labor. Half an hour later, three (3) unidentified creatures resembling crustaceans emerged from SCP-1459-1's vagina and proceeded to pull apart and consume the SCP-1459-1 instance.

**Player:** Dr. Reich
**Statement:** "Mutiny at sea."
**Result:** SCP-1459's chamber was partially flooded with water, and a small wooden raft was produced with two additional instances of SCP-1459-1. The original instance of SCP-1459-1 was provided with a small tri-cornered cap, and began to bark aggressively at the other two instances. Both instances appeared to nod towards each other before pouncing on the original instance and forcing it underwater. The raft then capsized, causing the additional instances to drown after 8 minutes.

**Player:** Dr. Iqbal
**Statement:** "Assassination."
**Result:** A robotic arm descended from SCP-1459's hatch and placed a stovepipe hat scaled to fit a juvenile canine upon SCP-1459-1's head. Several other robotic arms then emerged armed with a variety of implements and weaponry, and proceeded to stab SCP-1459-1 multiple times, bludgeon it, and orally administer at least thirteen different substances in a forcible manner. While SCP-1459-1 appeared to be deceased immediately following this activity, a single robotic arm lowered from hatch three minutes later carrying a rifle, which was then used to shoot SCP-1459-1 in the cranial area. Despite the presence of a single firearm and only one documented shot fired, a second bullet hole in SCP-1459-1's head spontaneously appeared during this time.

**Player:** Dr. Nark
**Statement:** “My 'leet' skills.”
**Result:** An empty television frame attached to a robotic arm descended from SCP-1459’s hatch alongside SCP-1459-1. SCP-1459-1 was placed behind the television frame from the perspective of Dr. Nark. A second robotic arm carrying a Type-95 assault rifle descended in front of the television frame. SCP-1459-1 was fired at through the television frame until expiration.

**Player:** Dr. Damm
**Statement:** "Dog fighting."
**Result:** A miniature airplane was lowered into SCP-1459 by a robotic arm. The airplane was a single-seat open-cockpit biplane with miniaturized machine guns mounted to the wings, and the side of the plane was adorned with the French flag; the plane was scaled down so that its cockpit was properly sized for an pre-adolescent canine. The robotic arm then placed SCP-1459-1 into the plane's cockpit, after which the plane began to fly around the interior chamber. After one minute, SCP-1459's hatch opened and a second miniature airplane, piloted by a second instance of SCP-1459-1, flew into the chamber. This airplane was identical to the first, except it displayed the flag of the German Empire rather than the French flag. The two airplanes circled around each other for three minutes. After several near-collisions, the French airplane opened fire on the German airplane, damaging one of its wings. The German airplane fired back at the French airplane, shooting the plane down and killing the first SCP-1459-1 instance in the process. The German airplane then crashed, presumably due to the damage it had sustained, killing the second SCP-1459-1 instance.

**Player:** Dr. Talan
**Statement:** "Surprise me."
**Result:** SCP-1459 remained inactive for approximately 15 minutes. During the period of inactivity, SCP-1459-1 began moving in an agitated manner within SCP-1459. The instance was observed to look repeatedly towards the hatch in SCP-1459's ceiling. At the end of the 15 minute inactive period, the SCP-1459's hatch opened. SCP-1459-1 stopped all movement and sat down, staring fixedly at the hatch. Dr. Talan was observed to step closer to the observation windows, also staring at the hatch. After another five minutes of inactivity, a series of loud noises, bright lights, and frightening images typical of 'screamer' viruses and images emanated from the hatch in rapid succession. SCP-1459-1 jumped approximately 30 cm into the air before collapsing. Dr. Talan clutched his chest above his heart before collapsing and going into cardiac arrest. After 30 seconds of inactivity, one robotic arm was lowered into SCP-1459. It then prodded the instance of SCP-1459-1 twice before the instance fell through the trapdoor in the floor.
**Notes:** //Dr. Talan is expected to make a full recovery. Additionally, SCP-1459 dispensed two tablets determined to be B████ brand aspirin rather than a cookie.//

**Player:** Dr. Edison
**Statement:** "Immortality."
**Result:** A mechanical arm pulled SCP-1459-1 into the ceiling hatch. Pained vocalizations were heard from SCP-1459-1 for approximately thirty minutes, followed by another thirty minutes of silence. The hatch opened a second time and SCP-1459-1 was lowered back into the chamber, preserved through taxidermy and displayed on a stand with a small plaque reading "Our Hero".

**Player:** Dr. King
**Statement:** "Zero Gravity"
**Result:** SCP-1459-1 was suffocated under a tremendous pile of appleseeds.
//Why did I expect anything different to happen?// -Dr. King

**Player:** Dr. Edison
**Statement:** "Are We Cool Yet?"
**Result:** [DATA EXPUNGED] leaving the corpse of the SCP-1459-1 instance suspended in mid-air, orbiting the singing head of Abraham Lincoln. 

**Player:** Jr. Researcher Kitterman
**Statement:** "Firing Squad."
**Result:** German Shepherd instance of SCP-1459-1 emerged tied to a post. A blind fold was affixed and a cigarette inserted into the corner of its mouth and lit. Five additional Pit Bull Terrier SCP-1459-1 instances emerged in uniforms consistent with those use by American Expeditionary Forces in WWI, carrying miniature rifles. One instance barked three times (presumably to indicate "ready, aim, fire") as the remaining four fired at the restrained instance, killing it.
**Note:** //Taps// was played over the normal closing statement during clean up.

**Player:** Dr. Laries
**Statement:** “Complete knowledge of the Universe.”
**Result:** A small bucket labeled "B█████ ██ █████" was lowered into SCP-1459. SCP-1459-1 walked over to the bucket, looked inside, and began to whine and cry. It then ran away from the bucket while still whining, smashing headfirst into one of SCP-1459's observation windows, resulting in its death.

**Player:** Dr. Harper
**Statement:** "Poker."
**Result:** Five additional instances of SCP-1459-1 were dispensed, along with a miniature poker table and chips. Each instance gathered around the table and proceeded to play a game of poker. Instances that lost all their chips were promptly beaten to death with a fireplace poker. After the game, the winner was given a treat and promptly beaten to death with a gold-painted fireplace poker.
**Note:** SCP-1459 dispensed 6 cigars rather than a cookie.

**Player**: Researcher Prescott
**Statement**: “Absolute Zero”
**Result**: Two robotic arms came out of the hatch carrying a table with a digital thermometer securely placed on top of it. Soon afterwards, the chamber’s temperature started to drop quickly. One hour after reaching 0.01 K without further changes, SCP-1459-1 was struck with a hammer and shattered.

**Player:** Dr. Reed
**Statement** "Beer"
**Result:** Three tubes extended from the top hatch of SCP-1459 and was inserted into the mouth and nostrils of SCP-1459-1. A yellow liquid (assumed to be beer) then flowed through the tubes. SCP-1459-1 displayed behavior exhibited by canines drowning for three (3) minutes and forty-one (41) seconds.

**Player:** Dr. Nepale
**Statement:** "Wrapped in a net."
**Result:** Four robotic arms came out of the hatch, one of which was holding a large flexible mesh of thin metal wire. The arms stretched out the mesh on each of its corners over SCP-1459-1 until all the gaps were congruent with each other. Afterwards, the arms brought the mesh down instantaneously under SCP-1459-1. The subject stood still for three seconds, after which all of its flesh and blood collapsed abruptly. The arms then wrapped the pile with the mesh and brought it into the hatch.
**Note:** The cookie was dispensed in four perfectly cut pieces.

**Player:** Dr. Sterling
**Statement:** "Cannon."
**Result:** Four robotic arms extended from the top hatch of SCP-1459. Two proceeded to pick up SCP-1459-1, while a third holding what appeared to be a cannon and a fourth holding a █████ brand lighter. SCP-1459-1 was then forced into the cannon. The cannon was aimed at the front of SCP-1459 and the fuse lit by the lighter. After around 30 seconds, the cannon fired SCP-1459-1 directly towards the front panel of SCP-1459.

**Player:** Dr. Sterling
**Statement:** "Forcible ejection from SCP-1459."
**Result:** SCP-1459 appeared to ignore this statement, as if unaware of its classification as SCP-1459. Second test performed with SCP-1459 referred to as "Win A Cookie Crane Machine" resulted in same outcome. Reason hypothesized to be due to the impenetrable nature of SCP-1459.

**Player:** Dr. Sterling
**Statement:** "Freedom."
**Result:** A sound played from SCP-1459 indicating that this method had already been attempted.

**Player:** Dr. Sterling
**Statement:** "All previous methods simultaneously."
**Result:** A sound played from SCP-1459 indicating that this method had already been attempted, and continued playing for 4 hours 25 minutes.

**Player:** Dr. █████████
**Statement:** "Methamphetamine."
**Result:** A nozzle extends from the top hatch, and begins exuding pale grey smoke in copious amounts. SCP-1459-1 begins appearing agitated at around the five minute mark, also seems to have difficulty breathing. As the smoke fills the chamber completely, SCP-1459-1 displays signs of distress and pain, before suffering a seizure roughly ten minutes into the test. At roughly fifteen minutes, visibility within SCP-1459 is reduced, though SCP-1459-1 is still visible, wandering the interior of SCP-1459 in an irregular circle. Two minutes later with visibility near zero, a dull thud is heard and SCP-1459 begins self cleaning procedure. Cause of death hypothesized to be either stroke or heart failure, based on known overdose symptoms.
**Note:** Cookie contained clear blue shards of an unknown material testing later showed to simply be blue raspberry rock candy.

**Player:** Dr. Ford
**Statement:** Volcano
**Result:** The top hatch opens. After about 5 minutes molten lava is dispensed and falls onto SCP-1459-1, burying it completely. After a few seconds of sizzling the lava is dumped into the bottom chute. 
**Note:** Cookie was chocolate with hot fudge filling.

**Player:** Dr. Trend
**Statement:** "Professional Wrestling." 
**Result:** Another instance of SCP-1459-1, wearing a tight-fitting outfit, was dispensed. The second SCP-1459-1 instance proceeded to grab the original SCP-1459-1 instance and toss the instance head-first on to the ground, in a similar fashion to a "suplex" technique, presumably snapping the neck of the SCP-1479-1 instance. The second instance was terminated via the default bludgeoning method.

**Player:** Dr. Skial
**Statement:** "Digested."
**Result:** Another, larger instance of SCP-1459-1 was dispensed. It proceeded to pick up the original SCP-1459-1 and swallow it. After about 30 minutes the second instance excreted waste, which had bone fragments lining the surface. The second instance was terminated via the default bludgeoning method.
**Note:** Cookie was double chocolate flavored.

**Player:** Dr. █████
**Statement:** "Irony"
**Result:** The top hatch opens.  After 15 minutes, a  metallic tray, approximately .5m x .75m x .01m in dimension, holding one dozen chocolate chip cookies is lowered and set before SCP-1459-1 by two arms.  After an additional 3 minutes, instance of SCP-1459-1 proceeds to ingest cookies vigorously.  SCP-1459-1 ingests five cookies within 2 minutes, then [REDACTED]. SCP-1459-1 proceeded combust and was rapidly incinerated. Deceased SCP-1459-1, remaining three cookies, tray and [REDACTED].  
**Note:**  Awarded cookie was chocolate chip.  Extensive testing of cookie found no anomalous or aberrant toxins or substances except ██mg more magnesium than typical of chocolate chip cookies dispensed by SCP-1459.

**Player:** Dr. Black
**Statement:** "The "WIN A COOKIE" Machine"
**Result:** A miniature replica of SCP-1459 falls from the top hatch, crushing the SCP-1459-1 instance. A replica of the SCP-1459-1 instance is placed within the SCP-1459 replica via a metal arm. A miniature replica of the replica of SCP-1459 falls from the top hatch of the SCP-1459 replica, crushing the SCP-1459-1 replica. This process is repeated for an indefinite number of times, until the SCP-1459 replicas become too small to observe with a microscope.
**Note:** Cookie was dispensed after 35 days.

**Player:** Dr. Walker
**Statement:** "Retroactive Cessation of Existence"
**Result:** A sound played from SCP-1459 indicating that this method had already been attempted.
**Note:** Despite the indication that this method had already been attempted, SCP-1459 proceeded to dispense a plain cookie.

**Player:** Dr. Milosevic
**Statement:** "Euthanasia roller coaster"
**Result:** Standard roller coaster track similar in appearance to the original roller coaster experiment, but of slightly larger width, constructed leading 45° upwards into the ceiling trap door. Approximately ninety minutes later, the ceiling hole expanded. Track at a near-horizontal, slightly downward-sloping angle, facing the opposite direction as the original, was constructed leading directly into the front viewing window, presumably somehow contiguous with the initial portion. SCP-1459-1 instance picked up and deposited into a roller coaster car, which immediately began to ascend along the track at a steady pace into the ceiling hole. Twelve minutes later, the cart and SCP-1459-1 were observed to coast back down the other visible track portion and gently bump into the window, halting the cart. SCP-1459-1 retrieved by a robotic arm, deceased.
**Notes:** Cleaning skipped; message played as usual.

**Player:** Dr. Milosevic
**Statement:** "Supernova"
**Result:** Glass on the windows appears tinted to a near-opaque black color. SCP-1459-1 deposited as usual. Black tinting suddenly becomes fully opaque and remains so for approximately ten minutes. Upon completion, glass returned to normal and no traces of SCP-1459-1 seen inside of the container. Cleaning routine skipped.
**Notes:** Dispensed cookie was apparently freshly baked and very warm. --Cleaning ritual skipped.-- There was an hour of apparent inactivity after this experiment, with a marquee on a display on the machine's interior stating "//Sorry for the wait! Think of some even more hard-to-clean ones next time! =)//"
> //"I wore protective sunglasses, but in hindsight that probably would have not been adequate, had there not been tinted glass... hey, how does light escape but not heat, anyways?"//  -Dr. Milosevic


**Player:** Dr. Villmow
**Statement:** "Not a dog; bludgeoning"
**Result:** Juvenile domestic cat //Felis cattus// deposited, and bludgeoned with the standard termination routine. Single oyster cracker rewarded, with a similar text display as the previous experiment: "//No more freebies!!//"
