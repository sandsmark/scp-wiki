[insert copypasta here]

This is just going to be a list of articles I make, and also fun little tidbits about them that you might've not known or wanted to know or thought to even not know.

I kind of helped make Gamers Against Weed, or GAW. I think I set the tone for them, but Scans thought up the group. Bluntfiend is my OC Don't Steal. I think he's very funny, and I hope things go well for him.

I helped write [[[SCP-2721]]]!

[[[SCP-1390]]] "A Dead Language" - This is my first article. It came to me when I was simply stressed out of my mind about the language requirement for my English major. I remember staying up all night studying Latin, a dead-ass language. And right around that time, I stumbled on the SCP Wiki. And from then on, I kinda stopped studying Latin. Don't worry, though. I totally got my degree. So yeah, basically, this is an undergrad's anxieties about their English major and other languages coalescing into a pretty "okay" piece about dudes turning into angels or some shit.

And yes, I did mean for them to be literally turning into angels. This article posits that humans have something inside of them, maybe another step of human evolution, that is unlocked by a certain pattern of thoughts best expressed through writing and speech. And boom, you get wings made out of light and all your old friends are shooting you.

Fun Easter Egg: Site Director Cavoli is named after my high school Latin teacher. He, indeed, spoke about ten languages, and he was a genius. I love him dearly.

[[[SCP-2852]]] "Cousin Johnny" - This one is my attempt at making something, well, more attuned to the site's creepypasta roots. I found the picture used in the article in my basement one day when I was doing some, I don't know, basement shit. The picture struck me in how weird it looked. Originally, I was going to have the little girl in the front of the picture be the SCP (btw, she's my godmother) but I felt weird about it, so my dad gave me permission to have him "be the monster." So yeah, it's totally my dad. My dad is an SCP. His name is John, also.

This SCP is basically just riffing on the weirdness of Roman Catholicism (a religion to which I was born) and the family parties that surrounded it. Originally, I was going to include First Communion in here, but I felt like three felt better than four. A funny thing is that I actually intended to write this for about, well, two years. And when I finally did, all the cicada stuff just poured out from me. It wasn't intended to be in the piece, but I think it was the strongest part of it. Bugs are fucking gross.

I have no idea what Cousin Johnny's deal is.

Fun Easter Egg: I think it's so fucking funny to call Roman Catholicism and Anglicanism the same thing, so I threw it into the article.

[[[SCP-2420]]] "A Good Dog" - Mattie is my dog in real life. I love dogs. I don't want Mattie to ever die, but she is getting old. I wrote this for her, even though she can't read. I also wanted to be able to say that my dad AND my dog were both SCPs.

I chose the number, because I wanted to take #420 and have it not be about weed.

Fun Easter Egg: The blanket Mattie is laying on in the article is the one SCP-2420 buries her in.

[[[SCP-2690]]] "Angel's Tongue" - This piece came to me, pretty literally, in a half-dream state brought on by Xanax, marijuana, and a lot of exhaustion. I couldn't get "Object Class: Beautiful" out of my head, and the rest kind of followed. I thought it'd be fun to fit this into the Short Works contest, because, as you can see, I have a habit of never shutting up.

The SCP itself is a corpse. The corpse is the ruler mentioned in SCP-1390. The SCP-2690-A's are becoming a kind of bastardized SCP-1390-2 subjects. The corpse has gone beyond the third stage. His words are his flesh and vice versa. They're not really supposed to get wings, if infected properly, but he's kind of brute forcing their bodies apart.

SERAPHIM-1390 is supposed to hint at the link between the two. PROCEDURE ICARUS-2690 is probably as simple as dropping a couple of nuclear bombs on the ancient tomb and hoping shit goes okay.

Fun Easter Egg: I would've expunged what SCP-2690-A were even if it weren't for the short work contest, but goddamn if that didn't help.

[[[SCP-2612]]] "--The Weight of The World-- A Donkey and Its Cart" - This piece uses this creepy lawn ornament that's been in my backyard since we moved here. I don't know if it was ever used. Sometimes I feel bad for it, when I stare at it while I mow the lawn. So I wrote this scip for it.

The idea here is that the SCP-2612, the one that carries The Load, comes to Director Garcia, sees him thinking of it as a jackass with a cart, and doesn't understand that it's a joke. Luckily, Garcia wasn't about to explain it. The scip, then, comes to Garcia wondering if that's what it is, if it can always have been that. Garcia tells it yes it can. And thus a keter scip is Mostly neutralized, and everyone's happy at the end.

Fun Easter Egg: This isn't an easter egg, but a lot of people seem to think this is another sad scip. IMO, this is nothing but triumphant.

[[[SCP-2721]]] "Eli and Lyris" - Hahahaha. So if any piece I was involved with could be called contested, it's probably this one. It comes pretty naturally from my life. Lyris resembles a lot of bloggers I've known, and Eli is a lot like some friends I've had. I thought something like a weird love story between two genderweird alien things could be interesting. Originally, I posted this article myself. And Dolphinslugchugger came to me asking if she could rewrite it. I thought it would be more fun for us to kind of collab, and I think it turned out really well.

All the moon stuff, that's all DSG. Lyris's section is also pretty much one hundred percent her, also. Eli's posts were the only thing really untouched. I'm still enormously proud of this one. Even though a lot of people seem to hate it and get all riled up about it, I think it's filling in a niche that should be filled in this wiki. I think weird sci-fi writing has plenty of room for weird trans internet shit next to all the other weird internet shit.

Fun Easter Egg: Pretty much, uh, the whole thing?

[[[SCP-2959]]] "What We Did, What We Were" - This piece stands pretty much on its own, I think? It's my entry to the D-Class contest. I always thought, if we were being honest with ourselves, the D-Class system doesn't gel with any assumption of the Foundation being "good." So I decided to try to work out why a good Foundation would have an evil thing and kind of moved from that premise.

My idea with the interview is that there's a small percentage of the D-Class population that can be viewed as factory mistakes? When they realize they're not being tested on or anything, they kind of turn off. I figured a cool way to show conserving power would be to have her start talking while garbling up things the interviewer had said. I think Scans might have given me that idea also. I can't remember. It's probably that.

Fun Easter Egg: The only reason I named the D-Class Selina was because I was watching Veep while writing the interview.

[[[SCP-2396]]] "Ms. Sweetie" - This is my first GoI SCP which is pretty weird considering Dr. W isn't even in my top three. But still, the Little Misters have always been a fun series of articles, and seeing that Ms. Sweetie wasn't taken made me, well, want to. I was worried Sweetie could get chosen by someone with weird sensibilities or something. I didn't want her to turn into another weird naked girl that has to drink cum and all dudes wanna bang.

Suffice to say, Sweetie went through a shitload of different ideas. The goal, through its entirety, was to try to make sure Sweetie didn't read as some weird fetish shit. And you'd be amazed at how many innocent ideas I pitched to people who told me I just described some DeviantArt shit. And I really do think I succeeded there.

Fun Easter Egg: There's two here. Dr. O'Herlihy is named after the actor who plays the head of the Shamrock Corp. in Halloween 3. I just did it, because hey, halloween. Also, with regards to her height, I was totally initially mistaken and thought 2.5 meters was more like seven feet, but when I found it that it was more like 8.2 I decided to stick with it. I kind of think it lends to her otherness.

[[[SCP-2293]]] "An Inside Joke" - This, unsurprisingly, is based on someone trolling me for my Stephen King love in a discord chat. Yes, that was the exact line used, and yes I thought it was a line actually used in the movie they were claiming it was in. I am gaycopmp4. You may think I am bluntfiend, but I am the easily owned whiner.

I really like this scip, and I hope more people write things like this within the GAW canon. I love the Misters Against Weed, but I would absolutely love, love, love to see more pranks as scps.

Fun Easter Egg: jockjamsvol6 has enormously good luck. Think of him like the kid from gunnerkrigg court. hetcopogg has no real abilities, but she's there because gaycopmp4 is real moody. gaycopmp4 is an amazing hacker. harmpit is a magic version of a script kiddy. polaricecraps is young and may be magic (think bluntfiend). lesbian_gengar can make cognitohazards.

[[[Different Kinds of Nihilism]]] - This is my first tale. It comes from a more heartfelt place than where you'd guess most GAW articles come from. I wanted to capture Gamers Against Weed as a deeply political group but also one with a conscience. I wanted to make sure that GAW didn't go down the AWCY path of incomprehensibility and masturbation.

I hope it holds.

Fun Easter Egg: I like to think that Eli is the mod of every single GAW chat. Bones is the official mod of every GAW group, because it is a very good, very impartial mod. I bet people think Bones is like a weird hacker with some autoresponder (like Lil Hal). Cuz like how else could he always, always be active in so many chats at once? I think it's funny that the GAW people are so used to magic and weird shit but don't take Bones at face value about being a satellite.

[[[What Passes as Normal in the Digital Age]]] - I didn't want Bluntfiend to overshadow all the GAW stuff, so I thought the best way was to focus this tale on the only non-anomalous member that I've introduced so far. I think telling a trans story on the wiki is good, and it is worthwhile. I'm glad the reception has been pretty positive.

Fun Ester Egg: Polaricecraps was mocked mercilessly and will continue to be mocked mercilessly for thinking that Dahlia wanted a giant fucking trans symbol on her laptop.

[[[SCP-2542]]] "Grinds Exceeding Small" - Sometimes I like to turn the heat up to get myself a little nervous. I always think better when I'm nervous.

Fun Easter Egg: Tayn't is a character I made up on my blog as, like, a joke, but I always thought with some tweaks he'd work as an SCP. Imo, he does.
