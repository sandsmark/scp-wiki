title:Kinchtheknifeblade's Author Page
Hi! This isn't an in-universe document, because I find that to be a little masturbatory And I do enough of that in my spare time. Hoo Hoo Hoo.

This is just going to be a list of articles I make, and also fun little tidbits about them that you might've not known! Or wanted to know! Like for instance, I'm gay AND a communist! Wowzers. Such interesting information about the author.

[[[SCP-1390]]] "A Dead Language" - This one is my most popular article, but that's simply because it was made first, I think. It came to me when I was simply stressed out of my mind about the language requirement for my English major. I remember staying up all night studying Latin, a dead-ass language. And right around that time, I stumbled on the SCP Wiki. And from then on, I kinda stopped studying Latin. Don't worry, though. I totally got my degree. So yeah, basically, this is an undergrad's anxieties about their English major and other languages coalescing into a pretty "okay" piece about dudes turning into angels or some shit.

And yes, I did mean for them to be literally turning into angels. This article posits that humans have something inside of them, maybe another step of human evolution, that is unlocked by a certain pattern of thoughts best expressed through writing and speech. And boom, you get wings made out of light and all your old friends are shooting you.

Fun Easter Egg: Site Director Cavoli is named after my high school Latin teacher. He, indeed, spoke about ten languages, and he was a genius. I love him dearly.

[[[SCP-2852]]] "Cousin Johnny" - This one is my attempt at making something, well, more attuned to the site's creepypasta roots. I found the picture used in the article in my basement one day when I was doing some, I don't know, basement shit. The picture struck me in how weird it looked. Originally, I was going to have the little girl in the front of the picture be the SCP (btw, she's my godmother) but I felt weird about it, so my dad gave me permission to have him "be the monster." So yeah, it's totally my dad. My dad is an SCP. His name is John, also.

This SCP is basically just riffing on the weirdness of Roman Catholicism (a religion to which I was born) and the family parties that surrounded it. Originally, I was going to include First Communion in here, but I felt like three felt better than four. A funny thing is that I actually intended to write this for about, well, two years. And when I finally did, all the cicada stuff just poured out from me. It wasn't intended to be in the piece, but I think it was the strongest part of it. Bugs are fucking gross.

I have no idea what Cousin Johnny's deal is.

[[[SCP-2420]]] "A Good Dog" - Mattie is my dog in real life. I love dogs. I don't want Mattie to ever die, but she is getting old. I wrote this for her, even though she can't read. I also wanted to be able to say that my dad AND my dog were both SCPs.
