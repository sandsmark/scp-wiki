**Item #:** SCP-1063

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Object does not require standard containment procedures needed for most SCPs. Normal walls (preferably consisting of exposed wood), floors (also exposed wood), and door with deadbolt will be more than sufficient in containment of object. When entering object's containment chamber for testing, no more than 2 personnel may enter at any time and the door is to be re-locked behind them. 

**Description:** SCP-1063 is an extremely articulated automaton constructed entirely out of wood and various copper adornments. Object moves as fluidly as any normal human being thanks to 65 individual brass ball bearings of varying sizes that make up the automaton's joints. The largest of which being one at about 30cm in diameter in the object's midsection.

Object has the appearance of an 18th century gentleman wearing a suit and top hat consistent with the time period (also made of wood). Affixed to the object are several copper adornments consisting of 13 buttons, a watch chain (no watch), a hatband, and a medal of unknown meaning nailed to the left breast. All have rusted to a bright turquoise green and currently appear to serve no purpose other than decoration. While right hand is completely articulated like the rest of the object the left hand appears to be non-existent, instead a tumorous growth comes out of the end of the left arm and extends into a wooden ax the blade of which is severely splintered and stained with several layers of dried blood. The growth seems to be natural instead of hand carved like the rest of the object. 

Object is sentient and extremely hostile towards all humans but calms whenever in the presence of anything that either occurs naturally, made from something that occurs naturally, or lives in nature (i.e.: plants, animals, stone, wood, etc.). (see Document #1063-S3)

**Document #1063-J6: Notes on recovery of SCP-1063:** Several reports of disappearances came to the attention of the Foundation in 19██  when residents of ████████ Village in the Black Forest of Germany were quoted as saying: "Der Hölzerne Dämon hat sie genommen!" (The Wooden Demon took them!). All missing persons were experienced woodsmen so it was very unlikely that they simply got lost or were injured in the forest so the Foundation intervened and began a search for the 'Hölzerne Dämon'. Countless searches of the nearby woods turned up nothing, that is until one chilly night when one of the guides assisting the recovery team decided to cut down a sapling for firewood.

SCP-1063 was described as bursting out of the forest into the recovery team's campsite and raising what looked like an ax over it's head. [DATA EXPUNGED] guide's body was transported back to his home village. It took six agents but the 'Hölzerne Dämon' was finally secured and promptly transported to Site ██.

During the chaos after the brutal attack on the guide SCP-1063 was observed kneeling over what was left of the sapling used for firewood and collecting it in it's arms before placing it on top of the sapling's stump. There it sat until agents attempted to capture it. Three agents were severely injured while one was knocked out by the blunt end of the wooden ax.

**Document #1063-S3: Notes on SCP-1063's structural anomalies and behavior:** Both the appearance of the object and tests on the copper rust have proven it to be a little over 300 years old placing it's creation somewhere around 1710 or so. These test have also identified the wood making up SCP-1063 the be common birch wood showing no uncommon properties or characteristics. Further testing on the birch wood has been approved. 

X-rays have shown object to be completely hollow with no mechanism sentient or otherwise to explain it's locomotion. Further testing has been approved.

A potted plant (ficus), as suggested by Dr. Stanton, was presented to SCP-1063 who upon seeing the plant immediately calmed in it's restraints. As soon as it was released from it's restraints object knelt before the potted plant and began to caress it's leaves, then, proceeded to remove plant from it's plastic pot and place it in the center of the containment chamber patting down the dirt around it's roots. Plant has since been kept in chamber and will remain as a distraction from agents and researchers entering for testing. Plant does not wither or die even with the lack of water and sunlight.
