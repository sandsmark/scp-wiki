**Item #:** SCP-3347

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3347 is currently owned by the Foundation under the Alias of ████ ███████. At least one Foundation agent is to maintain residence of SCP-3347 at all times, as well as provide necessary maintenance. No personnel are to reside in SCP-3347-1 or SCP-3347-2 for extended periods of time unless authorized to do so for experimentation purposes. 

**Description:** SCP-3347 is a split level ranch style house located in a suburban neighborhood in ████████████, New Jersey. SCP-3347 is comprised of a living room, a recreational room, a kitchen, a dining room, two bedrooms, three bathrooms, and several closets. Most of these rooms within SCP-3347, including all of the major living quarters, bear no known anomalous properties, and are equipped with furniture and appliances typical of a contemporary home. 

The anomalous properties of SCP-3347 occur in relation to two bedrooms,  designated SCP-3347-1 and SCP-3347-2, located adjacent to each other on the third floor. SCP-3347-1 contains a queen-sized bed, two dressers, a closet, and a central light fixture. SCP-3347-2 is entirely empty when not in the process of a Transposition Event.

A Transposition Event is triggered whenever two fertile humans of opposite sex sleep in the bed located in SCP-3347-1. Humans of the same sex, sterilized or menopausal humans, and groups of more than two individuals have all failed to trigger a Transposition Event. During a Transposition Event, the contents of SCP-3347-2 will change instantaneously on a daily basis. These changes, referred to as Transposition Shifts, always occur at 12:00 AM EST. Changes within SCP-3347-2 during Transposition Shifts vary between Transposition Events, but usually involve the appearance of objects such as furniture, carpeting, books, clothes, toys, and wallpaper, as well as the disappearance and rearrangement of said objects. If allowed to proceed to fruition, Transposition Events will always continue for exactly 18 days, resulting in 18 Transposition Shifts. Any outside objects left within SCP-3347-2 will disappear during Transposition Shifts, making surveillance of the transposition process via security cameras impossible. At the conclusion of a Transposition Event, all objects within SCP-3347-2 will disappear, and SCP-3347-2 will return to its initial empty state. SCP-3347-2 will return to this state prematurely if one or both of the subjects stop sleeping in SCP-3347-1 on a nightly basis.

Subjects who have triggered Transposition Events have reported feeling a desire to spend time near or around SCP-3347-2 during the event, as well as an overwhelming sense of sadness and loss following the event’s conclusion. Psychiatric evaluation is considered unnecessary in most cases, as these feelings tend to subside within a few days. Subjects have also occasionally reported hearing sounds from within SCP-3347-2 during Transposition Events. Such reports have included the sound of laughter, crying, and muffled speech. All attempts to locate the source of these sounds have been unsuccessful.

**Addendum 3347.1:** //Experiment Logs//

The following Experiment Logs catalog three deliberately triggered Transposition Events, and include all furnishing alterations, object disappearances, and otherwise preternatural phenomena resulting from these events.

During each experiment, two subjects were instructed to remain within SCP-3347 until the Transposition Event was completed and to sleep together (platonically) within SCP-3347-1 every night. Two foundation agents were administered to the site in order to oversee the experiment and take daily observations of the objects within SCP-3347-2.

**Subjects:** D-4217 (Male) and D-9951 (Female)

**Information of Note:** Subject D-4217 and D-9951 were chosen deliberately due to their familiarity with each other, having both previously been assigned to experiment with SCP-███. It was believed that this familiarity would prevent interpersonal problems from arising due to the close proximity of the experiment.

> **Day 1:**

**Subjects:** D-7619 (Male) and D-3732 (Female)

**Information of Note:** Subject D-7691 has undergone multiple incarcerations prior to Foundation recruitment for crimes such as physical assault and domestic abuse.

[[collapsible show="+ Experiment 3347-C (Warning: Level 3 Clearance Required)" hide="- Close"]]

**Subjects:** Dr. ████ Lavinson (Male), Dr. ██████ Morris (Female)
**Information of Note:** In order to prevent research complications resulting from unprofessionalism, as seen in Experiment 3347-2, Dr. Lavinson volunteered to activate a Transposition Event for research purposes. Dr. Morris, assistant researcher of SCP-3347-B, agreed to partake in the process. 

> **Day 1:**
> **Object observations:** SCP-3347-2 became furnished with pink wallpaper and purple carpeting. A standard child’s crib appeared within SCP-3347-2, along with a dresser drawer and several stuffed animals, including a bear, a cat, and an elephant.
> **Miscellaneous observations:** The sound of crying from within SCP-3347-2 was observed by both Dr. Lavinson and Dr. Morris at around 2:30 am.
> 
> **Day 2:**
> **Object observations:** More stuffed animals appeared within SCP-3347-2, along with a bookshelf containing several children’s books.
> **Miscellaneous observations:** Crying was once again heard from within SCP-3347-2 at around 2:45 AM. Dr. Lavinson entered SCP-3347-2, causing the crying to cease. Dr. Lavinson did not exit SCP-3347-2 until around 5:00 AM.
> 
> **Day 3:**
> **Object observations:** The crib within SCP-3347-2 was replaced by a standard child-sized bed. A two-story dollhouse containing four plastic female dolls appeared in the front right corner of SCP-3347-2.
> **Miscellaneous observations:** No miscellaneous occurrences of note.
> 
> **Day 4:**
> **Object observations:** SCP-3347-2 underwent no furnishing alterations.
> **Miscellaneous observations:** Dr. Lavinson heard laughter emanating from SCP-3347-2 for most of the day. No anomalous auditory phenomena were detected by Dr. Morris or any other personnel.
> 
> **Day 5:**
> **Object observations:** A wooden rocking horse and a nightlight in the shape of a heart both appeared within SCP-3347-2.
> **Miscellaneous observations:** Dr. Lavinson spent the entirety of the day within SCP-3347-2. Dr. Morris entered SCP-3347-2 at around 10:30 PM and found Dr. Lavinson talking in a jovial manner to a nonexistent entity. Attempts to persuade Dr. Lavinson to leave SCP-3347-2 were unsuccessful. At 11:30 PM, security personnel entered SCP-3347-2 and attempted to remove Dr. Lavinson by force. Dr. Lavinson displayed uncharacteristically violent behavior, incapacitating one agent and forcefully removing the other from SCP-3347-2 before barricading the door (presumably with the bookshelf and the dresser drawer). Dr. Lavinson could be heard singing various lullabies up until 12:00 am, the time of the sixth Transposition Shift, at which time all noise from within SCP-3347-2 ceased.
> 
> **Day 6:**
> **Object observations:** The bookshelf and dresser drawer within SCP-3347-2 had returned to their original positioned. No other changes were observed.
> **Miscellaneous observations:** No signs of Dr. Lavinson were found within SCP-3347-2. The walls and windows of SCP-3347-2 were unbroken, making an escape through normal means impossible. Experimentation on SCP-3347 was permanently halted, and Dr. Morris was removed from the premises and promptly reassigned.

UPDATE: On █/█/20██ (10 days after Experiment 3347-C was concluded), Dr. Morris reported hearing the sounds of muffled speech and laughter at approximately 2:30 AM within her place of residence. The following morning, Dr. Morris found a note written on lined paper at the foot of her bed. The contents of said note are as follows:

> Hello, ██████.
> 
> Sorry to disturb you. It won’t happen again. She just wanted to see what you looked like. She never believed me when I told her how much she looked like you. I wish you were able to see her, she would have loved that so much, and I think you would have too.
