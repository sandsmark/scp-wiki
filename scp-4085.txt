**Item #:** SCP-4085

**Object Class:** Safe  (Presumed Neutralized)

**Special Containment Procedures:** The 11,000 square meter area surrounding SCP-4085 has been purchased by the Foundation and converted to Site-090. All civilian roads leading to or passing by Site-090 have been redirected.

No personnel are allowed to enter SCP-4085 without authorization from the Director of Site-090.

Any personnel entering SCP-4085 are to be given currency to purchase items within SCP-4085. Absence of currency, attempting to exit with items from SCP-4085 without purchasing, or attacking instances of SCP-4085-A may cause a Σ-Fenecep event. Any personnel who are involved in the causation of a Σ-Fenecep event are to be considered lost.

**Description:**  SCP-4085 resembles a standard size grocery store, branded as "Shaggy’s Playhouse". All attempts to damage the exterior of SCP-4085 have proven ineffective. When entered, SCP-4085 is observed to have standard grocery store stock, but upon closer inspection of the items, they resemble human features, such as in the following examples:

* Produce resembles human faces with wide open mouths.

* Non-ground meat products, excluding fish, resemble human limbs.

* The packaging of products such as chips or cookies appears normal, but when opened it can be observed that the contents are in the shape of human extremities such as fingers, noses, and tongues. 

Analysis of the meat products found in SCP-4085 shows that they are genetically identical to human. Analysis of packaged food products and produce inside SCP-4085 are normal, but when eaten, subjects claim they feel sadness. 



SCP-4085-A is the designation for the entities that exist inside SCP-4085. When observed from the exterior of SCP-4085, they appear to be non-anomalous humans. When observed from inside SCP-4085, they are humanoid in shape, but are 3 meters in height, have orange-tinted skin, and have elongated fingers that average 30 cm. Instances of SCP-4085-A have eyes with black pupils, and mouths have been observed to widen to 25 cm, showing elongated teeth similar to //Melanocetus johnsonii// [[footnote]]Humpback anglerfish[[/footnote]]. They are dressed in shirts with the "Shaggy's Playhouse " logo on them.  Instances of SCP-4085-A exhibit expected behaviors of a human grocery store employee, including staffing the checkout counters and organizing the shelves. 


If a subject causes a Σ-Fenecep event, the doors of SCP-4085 will lock. Instances of SCP-4085-A will then cease all activity and advance on the subject(s). SCP-4085-A instances will then physically assault and attempt to eviscerate the subject, mainly using their teeth. This will continue until the subject(s), who have not met the criteria, have been subdued. Details of what occurs after this point are unavailable, but information gathered has led to the belief that the subjects are converted into produce and meat products to be sold [See Investigation Log]. No remains of the subject will be found.


SCP-4085 was discovered when reports of humanoid entities with "horns" and "tails" with red skin were reported entering and exiting a grocery store that locals claimed they had never seen or entered before. Reports found that those who entered SCP-4085 did not exit SCP-4085. Locals claiming to see SCP-4085 and the beings entering and exiting SCP-4085 were given Class B amnestic with false memory implementation.

**Foreword:** D-1213 was equipped with a one head-mounted wireless camera and one standard Foundation field kit.

||Note: This investigation is the first recorded instance of a Σ-Fenecep event.||

**[BEGIN LOG]**

//D-1213 enters SCP-4085 and observes 4 checkout lines staffed by instances of SCP-4085-A.//

**D-1213:** Woah! //[Stumbling]// What the hell are those things?

**Dr. Kellogg:** These beings are the known residents of SCP-4085. Do not interfere with them and proceed. 


**D-1213:** //[Exhaling]// You know, if you told people what to expect beforehand these expeditions would go a whole lot smoother. 

//D-1213 proceeds forward and sees a basket of fruit. D-1213 picks up a piece of fruit and sees that it resembles a human face.//

**D-1213:** //[Breathing heavily]// Oh my god.. . You guys see this right? Right? It has a face. //A human face!//

**Dr. Kellogg:** Please place the item in your field kit and proceed forward. 

//D-1213 is moving forward and halts, observing a humanoid entity wearing a dog costume holding a sign advertising "Shaggy’s Dog Special Treats" and holding a platter containing cups filled with an unknown substance. This entity will be known as PoI-4590. D-1213 appears to be moving away from PoI-4590.// 

**Dr. Kellogg:**  Please approach the entity and attempt to gather information.

**D-1213:** I really don't want to do that.

**Dr. Kellogg:** If you do n—

**PoI-4590:** Excuse me, good sir! Would you like to sample some of our Spectacular Shaggy Dog Special Treats?

**D-1213:**Um... no, I don't want any //doggy treats//, but I do want to know what is thi—

**PoI-4590:** That just won't work good sir! You must try our Spectacular Shaggy
 Dog Special treats! I am sure, no I am certain you will not regret it!


**D-1213:** I already said no. What I really want to know is what the he—

**PoI-4590:** [Interrupted] Then let me take you to a product of your liking for you to purchase in our fine establishment!

**D-1213:** What? No, I'm not buying anything from this creepy place, all I want is-

**PoI-4590:** [In a lower tone and volume than before] Nay. Dammit, and I thought customers were coming back. Well orange man, you better buy something real soon, unless you want to end up like that.

//PoI-4590 is pointing to a bag of chips.//

**PoI-4590:** And, tell your friends outside to leave the area, please. I make fewer things for you people to deal with, but we can't do that if you keep scaring off my customers.


**Dr. Kellogg:** Ask him why do their products resemble human body parts.

**D-1213:** Um.. . Why do your products look like human faces and humans body parts? I mean, just in case I do buy something! 


**PoI-4590:** [Returning In higher tone and volume] We make our fine products by infusing and capturing the finest of lost human souls! The souls that can't move on, the souls that are bound by grief, rage, or vengeance! By using them, I not only put them out their misery, but I make the world cleaner! Less ghost for you people, and profits for me, a win-win see! Now, please select one of our spectacular products and take them to checkout line so one of the helpers can assist you!

**D-1213:** But, I don't have any money.

//There is silence for 5 seconds.// 


**PoI-4590:** [In lower tone and volume again] Well orange man, please excuse me. I don't really like viewing this part. 

//PoI-4590 is seen escaping into an alleyway. D-1213 gives chase, but sees no signs of PoI-4590.// 

**D-1213:** Oh my-. He's gone! He's fucking gone! What the hell!

//D-1213 turns around and sees four instances of SCP-4085-A that appear to be smiling.//

**D-1213:** Oh shit!

//D-1213 runs to the exit, but is unable to open it. He begins banging on the door and shouting.//

**D-1213:** Hey! Get me out of here now. I did what you want and I don't think these things are trying to help me anymore!

**Dr. Kellogg:** Please stay calm, we are trying to extract you at this very moment. May, you please describe what the entities are doing right now?

//Several instances of SCP-4085-A are approaching and beginning to surround D-1213.//

**D-1213:** //[Breathing heavily]// More of them are coming! And they're just standing there, smiling. This is so fucking creep- 

//An instance of SCP-4085-A lunges forward and bites D-1213's left ankle.//

**D-1213:** Ow! Fuck! Get off, get off!

//Video and audio feed at this point was malfunctioning and what was happening to D-1213 could not be determined.//

**Dr. Kellogg:** Stay calm, we are doing our best. Can you please des-

//Flames can be seen around D-1213.//

**D-1213:** //[Screaming]// Kill me! PLEASE!


//All exterior windows of SCP-4085 became opaque, rendering the team unable to see inside the building. All video and audio feeds were lost. D-1213's field bag was not recovered.//

[[tab Investigation Log.2]]
**Foreword:** Thirty hours after the disappearance of D-1213, D-1789 and D-303 were given each a  one-headed mounted wireless camera and one standard Foundation field kit. D-303 was given 50 USD dollars to purchase items inside SCP-4085 and was instructed to observed D-1789. D-1789 was instructed to try to obtain items inside SCP-4085 without purchasing.

**[BEGIN LOG]**

//D-1789 and D-303 both enter SCP-4085 and observes five checkout lines staffed by instances of SCP-4085-A.//

**D-1789:** What the fuck? I didn't think they were serious. This cant be real, this just- 

**D-303:** [Interrupted] Stop your crying. Damn, d-rags[[footnote]]D-rag is a term D-class personnel refer to other new D-class personnel.[[/footnote]]. It's real! Now, get your job done and you might survive till taco Tuesday. 

**D-1789:** How are you not freaked about this!?

**D-303:** Have you seen a statue snap someone's neck before? 

**D-1789:** A what!?

**D-303:** Yah didn't think so, live long enough and you'll see. Now let's go. This place gives me bad vibes. 

//D-303 and D-1783 proceed forward. D-303 halts and picks up two bags of chips and proceeds to the checkout line.//

**D-303:** //[Laughter]// These are some expensive chips. 45$ for 2 bags, you got to be kidding.

**D-1789:** And that's what you're surprised about? 

//D-303 purchase items and begins to follow D-1789. D-1789 goes to the meat section of SCP-4085.//

**D-1789:** So what do you guys want me to get. 

**Dr. Kellogg:** Acquire meat products that are grounded and the ones that look like arms, and 2 brands of cookies, please.

**D-1789:** Okay, you got it. And old man, you okay up there? Why are you following me?

**D-303:** I don't know why you're using old man as an insult. I was your age when I got here, so getting old doing this shit is a compliment. Ha! And mind your business, I got my job and you got yours. 

**D-1789:** Of all the people you assign me with, why him.

**Dr. Kellogg:** That is none o-

**D-1789:** That wasn't a question.

**D-303:** I can say the same thing for you too, d-rag!

//D-1789 proceeds to acquire all the items requested and-//

**D-1789:** [Whispering] I don't want to do this. I mean what if those things come after me, what then.

**Dr. Kellogg:** If you do not, you will be severely punished.

**D-1789:** Are you stupid or something, I might die here, asshole. Hey! Hey, you there!

**D-303:** No use in arguing, just do it. Look on the bright side if you die you won't be here doing this and I don't have to hear your stupid whining. But, if you do live, you get some tacos. 

**D-1789:** Fuck it.

//D-1789 swipes the products off the shelves and is observed to be stretching and gets into a running position.//

**D-303:** Finally!

//D-1789 is running towards the exit with D-303 running behind him.//

//D-1789 gets to the exit, but is unable to open it.//

**D-1789:** Open, open open open! Get me out!

**Dr. Kellogg:** Stay calm. We are doing our best to extract you.

**D-303:** Weird nothing is happe—Holy shit! 

//Several instances of SCP-4085-A are climbing on the roof and jumping on the shelves. Instances of SCP-4085-A are observed to be going towards D-1789.//

//At this point, exterior windows of SCP-4085 became opaque rendering the team unable to see inside the building.//

**D-1789:** Getaway, get off—

//Flames can be seen on the ground around D-1789 before all audio and video feed was lost.//

**D-303:** Bu—Bu—wha—.

//D-1789 can be seen being pulled into an aperture by instances of SCP-4085-A. After this D-303 audio and video feed was lost.//


//Ten minutes after all connections were lost from D-1789 and D-303, D-303 walked out of SCP-4085 unharmed. D-1789 and his field kit was not recovered.//

**Foreword:** Twenty-seven hours after the disappearance of D-1789, D-303 was equipped with a one-headed mounted wireless camera, one standard Foundation field kit, and 400 USD dollars to purchase items inside SCP-4085.

**[BEGIN LOG]**

//D-303 enters SCP-4085 and observes five empty checkout lines. The shelves are empty.//

**D-303:**  Nothing here, all the stuff is gone!

**Dr. Kellogg:** Please proceed forward to see if there is anything.

//D-303 proceeds forward and observes and goes into the meat section of  SCP-4085. Instances of  SCP-4085-A  can be observed stacking boxes onto carts. A voice matching PoI-4590 can be heard in the distance.//

**Dr. Kellogg:** Please find the source of the voice.

**D-303:** What do you think I'm doing!

//D-303 proceeds forward and halts, observing a blue humanoid entity dressed in formal attire, appeared to be an 18-year-old male and observed to be talking on a cellular device.//

**D-303:** Um.... Hello?

**PoI-4590:** Yah can you send someone to pick me up. I'm moving to my other stores. The Foundation assholes discovered my little experiment.

**PoI-4590:** [Pause] Nay! What do you mean it's going to cost me, you prick do you know how many times I help you out in the past?

**PoI-4590:** [Pause] Well, I told you already that I'm not going to be fighting in your damn conquest or whatever you call it okay. Nay, I don't fight, I do business. I can't get any profits from participating, so there's no point! Now if you have end game then we can talk.

**PoI-4590:** [Pause] Zechariah, this is how we lost the first time. Things have changed, mass armies and conquering and all that is no longer reliable. Magic has weakened and times have changed. So, go the business route like me, and maybe I don’t know, relax.

**PoI-4590:** [Pause] What do you know of pride. You talk like you were there, you couldn’t even walk when the first war happened. Tell me this have you seen a thousand leviathans before? See, this is the problem with you, you think you know.

**PoI-4590:** [Pause] I don’t need your help, I’ll just go on my own then. See you later.

//PoI-4590 hangs up the cellular device.//

**D-303:** Hello again.

**PoI-4590:** Nay. Oh, it's you, people, again. Well, you can't send anyone else here to die anymore or //investigate// as you like to call it. I'm leaving.

//PoI-4590 spontaneously appears in front of D-303.//

**PoI-4590:** Tell your people find someone else to screw with.

//PoI-4590 proceeds forward to an instance of SCP-4085-A that is picking up a box.//

**PoI-4590:** Nay. More carefully, okay reject. Money doesn't grow on trees in this region.

**Dr. Kellogg:** Try to obtain information from him.

**D-303:** Right, right. Wait, I got some questions for you can you answer some of them.

**PoI-4590:** Nay. I guess ok s-

//Celluar device is ringing and PoI-4590 begins talking on it.//

**PoI-4590:** Excuse me.

**PoI-4590:** [Pause] Hello, who is this? Nay. This is Hawkin Zion Perem, the 750th son of the House of Perem speaking.

**PoI-4590:** [Pause] Quarry, is that you. Listen I'm not fighting in some multi- [Exhales] Listen, please don't call this phone if isn't about no commas. And aren’t you supposed to be sleeping at this time?

**PoI-4590:** [Pause] I don’t care if you're promoted to lieutenant general, captain, or have 500 stars. Its time for you to sleep. Go to bed! Goodbye.

//Hangs up the cellular device and proceeds forward to D-303.//

**PoI-4590:** Family, am I right, well ask your questions I got time.

**D-303:** Um.. what are those things.

//D-303 is pointing at an instance of SCP-4085-A.//

**PoI-4590:** Nay. Leftover souls combined with fish meat. When trying to make workers just get human corpses. Or, you might get these useless rejects!

**D-303:** Where did you get souls?

**PoI-4590:** What do you mean? Ghost, spectators, and phantoms are everywhere. You guys are doing a bad job. But, your incompetence is making me money, so please keep up the good work. //[Laughter]//

**D-303:** So what about the huge ho-

**PoI-4590:** [Interrupted] Oh look at that, the rejects are done. Sorry, but I will be going outside you can leave too, don't worry you won't die.

//PoI-4590 proceeds forward to a crowd of SCP-4085-A and boxes.//

**PoI-4590:** Okay rejects, you served your purpose. Time to go, [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

//Instances of SCP-4085-A and boxes dematerialize.//

**D-303:** //[Under his breath]// What the fuck.

**PoI-4590:** I'll leave if I was you, this place is going to become unstable.

//PoI-4590 and D-303 exit SCP-4085.//

**PoI-4590:** What a beautiful day this is. Brings back som-

//PoI-4590 and D-303 were both subdued. PoI-4590 was later brought into questioning.//

> 
> **Dr. Lenatoid:** //[Writing notes]// Very interesting. So, Hawk, what exactly is the purpose of your store?
> 
> **PoI-4590:** It used to be a store catering to what you can consider demons. As a tourist place for demons and their spawns to see how humans get their food. Like how people make zoos. I would get ghosts and infuse them with regular products from stores.
> 
> **PoI-4590:** It was a huge success. The souls got them to hook like they were alcoholics and it was going well until people started coming in. I should have put a perception field over it, but it was too expensive to maintain. So, the people started coming in, not buying anything and shooting at the employees. So they got converted into merchandise. And that must be how you people got wind of it. Really should have put perception field over it, but you live and learn.
> 
> **Dr. Lenatoid:** Is that what happened to the people who went in there in the past few days.
> 
> **PoI-4590:** Yes, that's what happened to your little tools. They all got converted. Not my fault, that's just how the store functioned and I can't change it.
> 
> **Dr. Lenatoid:** But, Hawk I thought you own it.
> 
> **PoI-4590:** Nay. I do, but it's not like a regular store. It caters and turns incorporeal beings into corporeal ones. So there has to be rules to have something like that exist in this world. If I didn't follow them, then the store will crumble. That's how you cater to demons. An annoying group with annoying rules, but they pay good money. I'll give them that, yeah I'll give them that.

When people are born, there is this potential you have. This dictates how much magic you can use, you see. Most people are born with [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/another-goddamn-magic-system|zero potential]]], but this can be changed through hard work, and since magic nowadays is trash it takes a lot of hard work to build it up.

**Interviewer:** Dr. Kellogg

**Interviewed:** PoI-4590

**Foreword:** Interview was conducted two hours after the first one. This interview was conducted by Dr. Kellogg after Dr. Lenatoid expressed great concern over her safety. PoI-4590 was not to display any anomalous abilities unless asked. 

**[BEGIN LOG]**
> **Dr. Kellogg:** You can call me Dr. Kellogg, Hawk. Also, may I ask what you did in the last interview with Dr. Lenatoid?

> **PoI-4590:** You want to know where all of them are at? Sorry, can't help you with that, there are hundreds of us and some are in a different universe at the moment. But, I know 3 of their locations and I could let go of that information if we can make a deal. Let's say you gave me some of those pills you call SCP-500 and then I can see if we can talk.

> **Dr. Kellogg:** Wai—Wha—No, how did you get information about that?!
> 
> **PoI-4590:** Nay. The same thing I'm doing right now. I don't do violence, I do business. And if you have something somebody wants, you can get a lot more from destroying their cities then asking for what you want. Trust me, that's from experience.

**Closing Statement:** I don't know if this thing is telling the truth or [EXPLETIVE]. But, I advise transferring it to a more secure site, possibly Site-100 or Site-45. We don't know if it is magic, voodoo, or mind tricks, but the fact is, it knows too much. -Dr. Kellogg.
