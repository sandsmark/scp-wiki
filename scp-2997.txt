**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2997 is to be stored in a high value observation chamber. It is to be placed on a pedestal in the center of its chamber, and every surface is to have cameras installed as to monitor the activities of SCP-2997-2.

**Description:** SCP-2997 is an ornate urn constructed of smokey quartz[[footnote]] A variety of quartz whose coloration comes from free silicon formed by irradiation acting on silicon dioxide.

SCP-2997-1 is a pile of human ashes contained within SCP-2997. It constantly releases a varying amount of gamma radiation. The amount of radiation released at any given point has ranged from lethal to infinitesimal.

SCP-2997-2 is a collective designation for a group of two-dimensional figures that may be seen on any surface with a direct line of sight to SCP-2997. Instances of SCP-2997-2 resemble nuclear shadows[[footnote]] A phenomenon caused by an object or life form absorbing the radiation from a nuclear blast that would normally have a bleaching effect on a surface located behind it, resulting in a dark area ("shadow") wherever the object or life form blocked the radiation from bleaching.

SCP-2997 was found in the basement of The Church of St. Joseph in Omura, Japan where it was being used as a centerpiece in a shrine. The search was launched following multiple reports of an "Urn of Souls" in a church somewhere near Nagasaki, Japan. A squad from Mobile Task Force Chi-3 ("Exorcists") was dispatched to ascertain the existence of and retrieve it. Upon arrival at the Church of St. Joseph, MTF Chi-3 was attacked by a member of the congregation who was praying at the shrine containing SCP-2997 at the time. He was successfully sedated and all witnesses were questioned about SCP-2997 before receiving amnestics. The head priest at The Church of St. Joseph produced a burned piece of parchment from a safe and claimed that he found it and SCP-2997 resting on a piece of the altar from Urakami Cathedral[[footnote]] Urakami Cathedral was a Roman Catholic cathedral located 500m away from the epicenter of the nuclear explosion over Nagasaki. It was in mass at the time of the bombing and all inside were killed.[[/footnote]] under a small pile of rubble. A transcript of the document can be found in addendum 2997-02.
