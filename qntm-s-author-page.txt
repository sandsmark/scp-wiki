+ My head canon

I regard the Foundation as a principally scientific organisation.

Although the stated goal of the Foundation is "Secure, contain, protect", there are numerous extremely dangerous real phenomena in the world (atomic energy, venomous creatures, infectious diseases) in which the Foundation apparently has no interest. What's the difference between something the Foundation has an interest in, and something it has no interest in? Answer: anomaly. The Foundation only cares about anomalous things, not things which are scientifically "understood".

So I think the Foundation keeps SCPs in containment mainly in order to study them, learn from them, and ultimately understand them. Once understood, an SCP might get an EX classification and be released to the general public. (Joking aside, [[[SCP-001-EX-J]]] completely lines up with this idea.) This explains why, for the most part, the Foundation //doesn't// simply try to destroy all SCPs.

Obviously the Foundation engages in some pretty sinister behaviour not directly related to the pursuit of pure scientific research, and its ethics are a bad joke, but generally I think that science is the core of the thing, and the main differentiator from other [[[groups-of-interest|Groups Of Interest]]].

+ Antimemetics

At its most basic level an antimeme is something you don't want to know about, and/or something you //can't// know about even if you want to. In other words, an idea which, by its own nature, somehow //resists being spread//. Non-anomalous antimemes are real. Anomalous antimemes are worse.

++ Random ideas

* What exactly was Clay trying to do?
* Why did Grey target the Antimemetics division specifically? Or perhaps he didn't, and there are numerous beings like Grey, all over the world... but only the Antimemetics division was well-equipped enough to detect, confront and defeat it? Then, how many of him are there?
* Is there some organisation which is trying to destroy the Foundation, or the Antimemetics division? If so, why?
* What other entities are "haunting" the Foundation?
* If you took a drug which let you see //everything//, what would you see?
* What kind of predator could eat SCP-2256?
* Who says those predators don't also exist, except their antimemetic camouflage is //so// good that the Foundation never detected them?
* What other antimemetically camouflaged animals exist? For example, could it be that the whole world is covered in antimemetically camouflaged worms, but nobody realises it?
* How much of the world has nobody ever looked at while on mnestic drugs? How much of the universe, for that matter?
* Could there be an entire antimemetically camouflaged parallel ecosystem which nobody knows anything about? What phenomena could exist in this ecosystem?
* Is the phenomenon of redaction - the Foundation's insatiable urge to //hide or destroy information// - an antimemetic SCP of some kind? A fungal information-eating infection?
* What kind of antimemetic entities exist in space? How big could they be? Could the Solar System have extra planets which we can't detect? Are there extra stars?
* Is this a possible explanation (in the Foundation universe, anyway) for dark matter/dark energy?
* Could it be that the explanation for the Fermi paradox is that almost all of the observable universe has been swallowed up by titanic antimemetic entities? There used to be hundreds of inhabited planets near us, but now they've all been eaten and we don't remember them?
