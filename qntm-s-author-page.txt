+ My head canon

I regard the Foundation as a principally scientific organisation.

Although the stated goal of the Foundation is "Secure, contain, protect", there are numerous extremely dangerous real phenomena in the world (atomic energy, venomous creatures, infectious diseases) in which the Foundation apparently has no interest. What's the difference between something the Foundation has an interest in, and something it has no interest in? Answer: anomalies. The Foundation only cares about anomalous things, not things which are scientifically "understood".

So I think the Foundation keeps SCPs in containment mainly in order to study them, learn from them, and ultimately understand them. Once understood, an SCP might get an EX classification and be released to the general public. (Joking aside, [[[SCP-001-EX-J]]] completely lines up with this idea.) This explains why, for the most part, the Foundation //doesn't// simply try to destroy all SCPs.

Obviously the Foundation engages in some pretty sinister behaviour not directly related to the pursuit of pure scientific research, and its ethics are a bad joke, but generally I think that science is the core of the thing, and the main differentiator from other [[[groups-of-interest|Groups Of Interest]]].

+ Feedback

I will give you feedback on your draft. Contact me while I'm on IRC if you can find me. Here are some bullet points about how I work:

* I read fast... so if there is a cunning twist to your submission which most people will miss, most likely I will miss it! :D I will ask you afterwards if there is anything that I might have missed.
* I will try to give you my honest impression of (1) how I would vote on the submission and (2) how I think the general public will vote on the submission.
* I will give you suggestions for how to improve the impact of your submission.
* I focus on story, atmosphere, characters, worldbuilding, stuff like that. I will break your story concept down and suggest ways to rebuild it more effectively.
* A lot of the time, my suggestions will involve sweeping, high-effort edits. **I tend to ignore typographical errors and minor wording issues**. (Unless there are very few of them and I can call //all// of them out, or there are so many that it heavily detracts from the submission.) That kind of "proofreading" is not really my bag. If your submission is close to completion and you only want me to suggest minor wording changes, then my suggestions may not be helpful, or may set you back by a week for rewriting.
* I don't necessarily have any idea what I'm talking about.
* I won't review the same work-in-progress more than three times. This is because I will no longer be able to judge changes qualitatively, and the "spark" of first impressions will have gone by that time. After two or three reviews I will ask you to get a second opinion. In general terms, if you're asking me to review too many things in too small a space of time, I may ask you to ease off.
