+ My head canon

I regard the Foundation as a principally scientific organisation.

Although the stated goal of the Foundation is "Secure, contain, protect", there are numerous extremely dangerous real phenomena in the world (atomic energy, venomous creatures, infectious diseases) in which the Foundation apparently has no interest. What's the difference between something the Foundation has an interest in, and something it has no interest in? Answer: anomalies. The Foundation only cares about anomalous things, not things which are scientifically "understood".

So I think the Foundation keeps SCPs in containment mainly in order to study them, learn from them, and ultimately understand them. Once understood, an SCP might get an EX classification and be released to the general public. (Joking aside, [[[SCP-001-EX-J]]] completely lines up with this idea.) This explains why, for the most part, the Foundation //doesn't// simply try to destroy all SCPs.

Obviously the Foundation engages in some pretty sinister behaviour not directly related to the pursuit of pure scientific research, and its ethics are a bad joke, but generally I think that science is the core of the thing, and the main differentiator from other [[[groups-of-interest|Groups Of Interest]]].

+ Antimemetics

//**The story so far**//

//The Antimemetics division is at war with a powerful enemy who uses antimemetic techniques to cloak its activities. The same enemy wiped out [[[unforgettable-that-s-what-you-are|the original Unthinkables team]]], as well as every other competent antimemetics research effort in human history. [[[SCP-055]]], [[[we-need-to-talk-about-fifty-five|Clay]]] and [[[introductory-antimemetics|Grey]]] were all attacks, attempts to wipe the division out - and they all failed.//

//But how long can you fight without even knowing you're at war? How do you defeat an enemy which you aren't even aware exists?//

//And what happens when you lose?//

[!-- Ideas don't die. --]

[!-- There is no Antimemetics Division. --]

I am hoping to bring a major Antimemetics division arc to its conclusion by the end of 2015. If you feel like adding something here, give me a shout.
