+ FAQ

++ Do you intend to write up  or SCP-4739 (as seen in  [[[introductory-antimemetics|Introductory Antimemetics]]]) as a "proper" SCP entry?

No, I have no plans to do this. You may use this number for other things if you like.

There is a built-in mechanism in the Antimemetics Division stories which explains why the anomaly described in the story might not match up with the anomaly seen in the database. Also, there is no canon, so a contradiction would not be hugely problematic. Finally, note that this Tale does not link directly to this SCPs -- it is not considered to be part of the Antimemetics Division reading order. This is intentional, to avoid confusion.

++ Can I write up SCP-4739 based on what's in the Antimemetics Division stories?

Probably not a good idea. I originally started writing [[[introductory-antimemetics|Introductory Antimemetics]]] as an SCP entry and then changed it to a Tale because the Tale was a much more effective way to present the same concept. An SCP entry would be (1) less effective than the Tale and (2) redundant, because the Tale exists already.

++ What about SCP-4987 (as seen in [[[we-need-to-talk-about-fifty-five|We Need To Talk About Fifty-Five]]] and [[[where-have-you-been-all-my-life|Where Have You Been All My Life]]]) and SCP-4051 (as seen in [[[fresh-hell|Fresh Hell]]])?

[[[scp-4987|SCP-4987]]] and [[[scp-4051|SCP-4051]]] have both already been filled with unrelated SCPs.
