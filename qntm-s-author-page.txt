+ FAQ

++ Are you the qntm from [http://qntm.org qntm.org]?

Yes.

++ Hey, how come SCP-4987 as seen in [[[we-need-to-talk-about-fifty-five|We Need To Talk About Fifty-Five]]] and [[[where-have-you-been-all-my-life|Where Have You Been All My Life]]], SCP-4739 as seen in  [[[introductory-antimemetics|Introductory Antimemetics]]] and SCP-4051 as seen in [[[fresh-hell|Fresh Hell]]] are different from [[[SCP-4987]]], [[[SCP-4739]]] and [[[SCP-4051]]] respectively?

Those Tales were written before the SCP-4XXX series opened up (actually, even before the SCP-3XXX series had opened up). I deliberately picked numbers which were unavailable at the time, to avoid reader confusion between the anomalies demonstrated in the Tales and any real entries in the database.

I had little intention of writing these anomalies up as "real" SCP entries, for a variety of reasons. SCP-4987 could potentially have some interesting backstory, but it wasn't crucial to the Tales being told. SCP-4739 actually started out as an SCP concept, but I turned it into a Tale because I thought that was more effective. SCP-4051 is rather mundane by SCP Wiki standards and mainly exists to serve as a backdrop for the real story. And, of course, any of these SCP entries would run the risk of being straight-up redundant in light of the relevant Tale(s), and would need some creativity (i.e., work) to become worthwhile and stand on their own.

I expected that the SCP-4XXX series would remain unavailable for the forseeable future, so that this wouldn't become a problem. But then the SCP Wiki ramped up in popularity and now here we are.

After a few false starts, all three SCP entries are now filled with unrelated SCPs.

It's not a problem. There is no canon; in the Antimemetics Division continuity, those SCPs are different.

++ What about SCP-7381, as seen in [[[Your Last First Day]]], or SCP-9429, as seen in [[[Immemorial]]]?

Same deal. These are SCP concepts which are more intended to support their Tales than to serve as free-standing SCP entries. I don't have plans to write them up for real.

But hopefully it won't become a problem for at least a few years...

++ So what about [[[SCP-3125]]], as seen in [[[case-colourless-green|CASE COLOURLESS GREEN]]] and [[[your-last-first-day|Your Last First Day]]]?

Contrary to the above!

Those Tales were written before the SCP-3XXX series opened up, **but** I had full intention of filling SCP-3125 in myself when the time came. The SCP-3XXX series opened up much sooner than I expected, but I did follow through as planned. SCP-3125 //is// part of the Antimemetics Division continuity, and part of the reading order seen on the [[[antimemetics-division-hub|hub]]].
