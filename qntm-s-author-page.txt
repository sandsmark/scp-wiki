+ Antimemetics "canon"

I don't 100% know where I'm going with this, and I don't want it to snowball into a long-form piece of serialised fiction, if I can help it. But I have some ideas and theories.

++ Actual future things I intend to write

+++ "Giraffe shadows of Polynesia" (better title needed)

SCP-XXXX is an "invisible" (perception-filtered) species of tall, giraffe-like, brachiosaur-like creatures which live on the Pacific Ocean around Polynesia. By "on" I mean they walk on the water's surface, because they are so light and "thin" that they do not interact very much with gravity. By "tall" I mean that adults are more than a kilometre tall. They wander across the ocean in groups and spend most of their time staring at the sky. They have about four legs, but it is inordinately difficult to count.

These creatures are ancient, like sharks and crocodiles. The theory is that they evolved to be natural antimemes, as a defence mechanism. Since then, they have had most of the world to themselves and nobody has ever seen them before.

Acquisition log: certain Polynesian islanders took a drug which is similar to a chemical mnestic, and would observe these creatures walking across the horizon. A Foundation researcher takes the same drug, observes the same creatures and sets out to study them.

As observation logs continue, it becomes clear that the act of observing and recording the creatures is harmful to them, causing stillbirths, illness and infertility. In fact, the more closely they are recorded, the more damage is done - //the SCP entry itself is killing them//. The researcher who discovered them pleas for the entry to be scrapped, or at least redacted somehow, but to no avail. The creatures die out entirely and the species is declared extinct/safe. There are no containment procedures.

+++ The predecessors (actual title needed)

Somebody realises that if Grey in "Introductory Antimemetics" had successfully consumed the whole Antimemetics division, eventually a new unrelated division would have been founded. They then reason that possibly this happened once before.

Our heroes successfully summon back into existence the PREVIOUS Antimemetics division, which was wiped out and retroactively erased from history by a dangerous antimeme, back in the early 1970s. Maybe they even summon many earlier iterations of the organisation, potentially going back as far as ancient Sumerian times?

Of course, in doing this, they also summon whatever it is which wiped them out last time. But the modern !M people are smarter and are able to contain this thing, probably using the same technique Kim pioneered.

+++ !M (actual title needed)

Something gets loose. Marion Wheeler descends into the bowels of the site to find and activate the Antimemetics division's answer to the site nuclear warhead. This device was developed during the 1940s in an attempt to quickly and painlessly eradicate the //abstract concept of Nazism// from the world. When activated, the entire site and the entire division is erased from history, just like others before them. Marion trusts that some future generation will figure out what happened and resurrect them, just as before.

++ Other, less well-developed ideas

+++ More invisible stuff

+++ Greys

It seems weird that a phenomenon like Grey in "Introductory Antimemetics" would randomly target the Antimemetics division. Could it be that there are numerous other Greys around the world, consuming many other people and organisations, but only the Antimemetics division was in a position to realise what was happening?

Alternatively, was the division targeted deliberately by some powerful external agent? Was Grey some kind of weapon, or warhead? Then who? And what about Clay, from "We Need To Talk About Fifty-Five"?

I feel as if the Foundation in general, and the Antimemetics division in particular, has enemies. Whether these enemies are completely abstract (//are// antimemes) or they just use antimemetic weaponry, I haven't worked out yet.

+++ Fermi

Most people take mnestic drugs under controlled conditions. How many take them outside, on a clear night, while looking at the sky?

A suggested resolution to the Fermi paradox. Could it be that the reason the universe is apparently completely dark and empty of intelligent life is that almost all of it has been swallowed up by titanic antimemetic entities? Does our solar system have fifteen planets, seven of which have been eaten?
