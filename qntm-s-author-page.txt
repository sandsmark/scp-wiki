+ FAQ

++ Are you the qntm from [http://qntm.org qntm.org]?

Yes.

++ Hey, how come SCP-4987 as seen in [[[we-need-to-talk-about-fifty-five|We Need To Talk About Fifty-Five]]] and [[[where-have-you-been-all-my-life|Where Have You Been All My Life]]], SCP-4739 as seen in  [[[introductory-antimemetics|Introductory Antimemetics]]] and SCP-4051 as seen in [[[fresh-hell|Fresh Hell]]] are different from [[[SCP-4987]]], [[[SCP-4739]]] and [[[SCP-4051]]] respectively?

Those Tales were written before the SCP-4XXX series opened up (actually, even before the SCP-3XXX series had opened up). I deliberately picked numbers which were unavailable at the time, to avoid reader confusion between the anomalies demonstrated in the Tales and any real entries in the database.

I had little intention of writing these anomalies up as "real" SCP entries, for a variety of reasons. SCP-4987 could potentially have some interesting backstory, but it wasn't crucial to the Tales being told. SCP-4739 actually started out as an SCP concept, but I turned it into a Tale because I thought that was more effective. SCP-4051 is rather mundane by SCP Wiki standards and mainly exists to serve as a backdrop for the real story. And, of course, any of these SCP entries would run the risk of being straight-up redundant in light of the relevant Tale(s), and would need some creativity (i.e., work) to become worthwhile and stand on their own.

I expected that the SCP-4XXX series would remain unavailable for the forseeable future, so that this wouldn't become a problem. But then the SCP Wiki ramped up in popularity and now here we are.

After a few false starts, all three SCP entries are now filled with unrelated SCPs.

It's not a problem. There is no canon; in the Antimemetics Division continuity, these SCPs are different.
