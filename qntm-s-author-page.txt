+ My head canon

I regard the Foundation as a principally scientific organisation.

Although the stated goal of the Foundation is "Secure, contain, protect", there are numerous extremely dangerous real phenomena in the world (atomic energy, venomous creatures, infectious diseases) in which the Foundation apparently has no interest. What's the difference between something the Foundation has an interest in, and something it has no interest in? Answer: anomalies. The Foundation only cares about anomalous things, not things which are scientifically "understood".

So I think the Foundation keeps SCPs in containment mainly in order to study them, learn from them, and ultimately understand them. Once understood, an SCP might get an EX classification and be released to the general public. (Joking aside, [[[SCP-001-EX-J]]] completely lines up with this idea.) This explains why, for the most part, the Foundation //doesn't// simply try to destroy all SCPs.

Obviously the Foundation engages in some pretty sinister behaviour not directly related to the pursuit of pure scientific research, and its ethics are a bad joke, but generally I think that science is the core of the thing, and the main differentiator from other [[[groups-of-interest|Groups Of Interest]]].

+ Antimemetics

At its most basic level an antimeme is something you don't want to know about, and/or something you //can't// know about even if you want to. In other words, an idea which, by its own nature, somehow //resists being spread//. Non-anomalous antimemes are real. Anomalous antimemes are worse.

++ Random ideas

* Symbol for antimemetics: "!i", with the "!" meaning "anti" and "i" standing for "information". Or "!M".
* What do Class-X, Class-Y and Class-Z mnestics do?
* What "unforgettable" SCPs are there and how do they tie into the mnestics hierarchy?
* What happens when memetic and antimemetic entities meet?
* Is the phenomenon of redaction - the Foundation's insatiable urge to //hide or destroy information// - an antimemetic SCP of some kind? A fungal information-eating infection?

* What exactly was [[[we-need-to-talk-about-fifty-five|Clay]]] trying to do?
* Why did [[[introductory-antimemetics|Grey]]] target the Antimemetics division specifically? Or perhaps he didn't, and there are numerous beings like Grey, all over the world... but only the Antimemetics division was well-equipped enough to detect, confront and defeat it? Then, how many of him are there?
* Is there some organisation which is trying to destroy the Foundation, or the Antimemetics division? If so, why?
* What other entities are "haunting" the Foundation?
* Ideas don't die.

* When was the Antimemetics division founded?
* Is this the first Antimemetics division? What if there was another Antimemetics division before this one, which nobody remembers?
* What happened to them? Could it happen to the new division too?
* How long has this been going on? Could it be that antimemetic entities have been studied since the 19th century? Or since the Middle Ages? Or even prehistory?

* Is there an antimemetic equivalent to a nuclear bomb?
* What if, during the Manhattan Project, there was a parallel project to develop an antimemetic nuke? A device, say, which could destroy the very //idea// of Nazism. What happened to that project? Did it succeed? How could you even test such a machine?

* What kind of predator could eat [[[SCP-2256]]]?
* Who says those predators don't also exist, except their antimemetic camouflage is //so// good that the Foundation never detected them?
* What other antimemetically camouflaged animals exist? For example, could it be that the whole world is covered in antimemetically camouflaged worms, but nobody realises it?
* Could there be an entire antimemetically camouflaged parallel ecosystem which nobody knows anything about? What phenomena could exist in this ecosystem?
* How much of the world has nobody ever looked at while on mnestic drugs?
* SCP-????-J, "What if, like, there's an SCP that nobody knows about and nobody has ever seen and because it's so impossible to perceive that we don't even have containment procedures for it, and also it doesn't really exist in reality, at all? Shouldn't we have an entry for that?"

* How much of the universe, for that matter?
* If you took a drug which let you see //everything//, what would you see?
* What kind of antimemetic entities exist in space? How big could they be? Could the Solar System have extra planets which we can't detect? Are there extra stars?
* Is this a possible explanation (in the Foundation universe, anyway) for dark matter/dark energy?
* Could it be that the explanation for the Fermi paradox is that almost all of the observable universe has been swallowed up by titanic antimemetic entities? Could it be that there used to be hundreds of inhabited planets near us, but now they've all been eaten and we don't remember them?
* "The sky used to be filled with stars. We're losing."
* Are those entities coming for us too?
* How could they be defeated? Answer: some kind of unforgettable object like [[[SCP-609]]]
* Dr. Wondertainment's Ontological H-Bomb

++ Future plans

* Tale exploring the use of Class-X mnestics to restore forgotten things, including the previous Antimemetics division which existed from ~1940 to ~1975.
* "Oubliette", a Tale about an Antimemetics employee trapped inside an asynchronous research loop.
* "Unforgettable", a Tale in which Marion detonates the site infonuke, retroactively erasing the present-day Antimemetics division until such time as a future division is formed and restores them.
* Some other story where we kill the titanic antimemetic guys

+ Feedback

I will give you feedback on your draft. Contact me while I'm on IRC if you can find me. Here are some bullet points about how I work:

* I don't necessarily have any idea what I'm talking about. My suggestions will make your work more like mine. This is not necessarily a desirable endgame.
* I read fast... so if there is a cunning twist to your submission which most people will miss, most likely I will miss it! :D I will ask you afterwards if there is anything that I might have missed.
* I will try to give you my honest impression of (1) how I would vote on the submission and (2) how I think the general public will vote on the submission.
* I will give you advice which I think will improve your score. BUT:
* I don't necessarily have the faintest idea how the general public votes. AND:
* I am famously out of touch, so I don't necessarily know much about the SCP "mythos". You may need to educate me or give me some background reading!
* I won't review the same work-in-progress more than three times. This is because I will just no longer be able to judge changes qualitatively, and the "spark" of first impressions will have gone by that time. After two or three reviews I will ask you to get a second opinion. In general terms, if you're asking me to review too many things in too small a space of time, I may ask you to ease off.
* I focus on story, atmosphere, characters, worldbuilding, stuff like that. **I tend to ignore typographical errors and minor wording issues**... //unless// there are very few of them and I can call //all// of them out, //or// there are so many that it heavily detracts from the submission. That kind of "proofreading" is not really my bag.
* A lot of the time, my suggestions will involve sweeping, high-effort edits. I will break your story concept down and suggest ways to rebuild it more effectively. If your submission is close to completion and you only want me to suggest minor wording changes, then my suggestions may not be helpful, or may set you back by a week for rewriting.
* A lot of the time my feedback will just turn out to be a stream of consciousness of new ideas for new directions to explore. I expect you to ignore 90% of these suggestions because if you obeyed all of them you would essentially be writing //my// submission instead of yours. Feel free to ignore me or shout me down if you think I have the wrong idea.
