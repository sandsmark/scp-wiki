||To:||	Director of MTFs||
||From:||	Dr. Ahmed Faisal, Site-19||
||Subject:||	Application to form MTF Rho-87 ("All Chewed Up")||

There are multiple GoIs currently that produce anomalous items for public use. MC&D, Wondertainment, The Factory, etc. All of these GoIs have produced edible anomalies of some kind, but in generally small and exclusive amounts.

We are, unfortunately, now aware of a small GoI operating somewhere in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, with a particular spotlight on Seattle, Boise, and multiple small towns throughout the region. This GoI has, so far, only produced a single SCP - [[[SCP-2867|SCP-2867]]], a strain of anomalous cheese that currently constitutes a Class III memetic hazard, a Class V security breach, and a Class VII biohazard - it is self-replicating, compulsive, infectious, and, unfortunately, available for public consumption. It has appeared in cheese shops, supermarkets, and delicatessens throughout the regions, appearing as various recognised and unrecognised brands of gorgonzola, mozzarella, and most recently, cheddar and monterey jack cheeses. They are chemically and visually indistinguishable from normal cheese, and containment has been left to individual tracking and destruction of infected individuals. What we need, however, is to find and destroy the source.

Enter Jack Terrence and Terrence Farms, the former being an unknown PoI and the latter being the assumed producer of SCP-2867. From physical evidence and witness statements, we have determined Jack Terrence to be the original creator of SCP-2867, and Terrence Farms to be his, or her, business. Jack Terrence's identity, location, and motive are all unknown, and we know just as little information about The Farms as we do about him.

A small statistic you won't find in the listed document: SCP-2867 has killed over 220 people, including one agent, two foundation assets in the Seattle PD, and my former colleague, Dr. Pradesh. We have destroyed over 970kgs of captured product; this is about 1/10 of the assumed amount present. We've spent over 32 million dollars on containment; amnestics and situational blanketing alone have set us back 5 million. SCP-2867 is a Keter-class SCP; and it deserves such treatment. 

My request is simple. If I could have access to a small and decently-funded MTF, we could most likely neutralise the threat before it gains national or international footing. This MTF would require very little; our entire requisitions form can be found on the next page. By extension, if my MTF can prove itself in this endeavour, which I'm sure it will, we can extend to a fully-fledged MTF.

I hope you take my request into consideration.

With regards,

Dr. Ahmed Faisal, Site-19

**Request to form a provisionary MTF**

**Designation:** Mobile Task Force Rho-87 ("All Chewed Up")

**Classification:** --(check one)-- Provisionary Regional Task Force

|| [**X**] M (Combat) || [**X**] C (Containment) || [ ] G (Engineering) ||
|| [ ] E (Esoteric) || [**X**] T (Tracking) || [ ] U (Undercover) ||

**Mission Statement:**

> Provisionary Regional Mobile Task Force Rho-87 ("All Chewed Up") will monitor cases of unexplained disappearances and other phenomena relating to possible SCP-2867 infection. Operatives will conduct in operations to destroy sources of SCP-2867 and ultimately capture POI-17357 (Jack Terrence) and the GoI Terrence Farms.

**Task Force Organisation:**

**Operations**

> A group of retired agents and operatives from multiple arms of the Foundation. Ops will be responsible for boots-on-the-ground intelligence gathering, neutralisation, and investigation. Ops will be armed with civilian and military-grade munitions, and will be responsible for the purchase of most of their own equipment. Operations personnel will be participating in live combat and operations that are uncleared by local law enforcement. A complete operations personnel list can be found on the personnel page of this dossier.

**Research**

> A selection of doctors specialising in memetics, biohazards, and food-based anomalies from multiple arms of the Foundation, all having worked under Dr. Faisal at one time or another. Research will be responsible for all technological research and conceptual development.
