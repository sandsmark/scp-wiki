**Personal History:** 
After Foundation meddling there are very few records of Dr. Wood’s life previous to his involvement with the foundation. One thing that becomes very clear after reading the reports is that Dr. Wood is over-enthusiastic, very security conscious and always helpful with a scalpel and a blowtorch.
Despite popular gossip his obsession with Nazi UFOs is not a result of prolonged exposure to SCP-███
