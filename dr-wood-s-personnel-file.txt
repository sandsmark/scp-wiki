**Personal History:** 
After Foundation meddling there are very few records of Dr. Wood’s life previous to his involvement with the foundation. One thing that becomes very clear after reading the reports is that Dr. Wood is over-enthusiastic, very security conscious and always helpful with a scalpel and a blowtorch.
Despite popular gossip his obsession with Nazi UFOs is not a result of prolonged exposure to SCP-███. Never, ever mention the GOC to him in ordinary speech. The frothing at the mouth is bad enough when he isn't gibbering to match. Also never mention Dave Grohl or any member of the band known as 'Foo Fighters'
