++++ NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION EXTRADIMENSIONAL ANOMALY DIVISION

On 12/13/17, a secure flash drive containing the following document emerged from [[[SCP-1437]]], accompanied by a human corpse wearing unidentifiable military fatigues. Following analysis, the document was identified as an internal record from the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/unusual-incidents-unit-hub Unusual Incidents Unit Division] of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It is currently unknown how a UIU document was sent through SCP-1437, as all documents emerging from the anomaly to date have consisted of Foundation analogue records.

Additionally, at the time of this document’s emergence from SCP-1437, all four [http://www.scp-wiki.net/and-this-one-explains-humes Kant detectors] located around the anomaly failed simultaneously. Later analysis of their failure states revealed that all four devices recorded a negative Hume level at the time of emergence, leading to a failed assertion check for each device. The reasoning behind this improper reading is currently unknown.

[[size 120%]] **UIU File 2017-003:** Codename: Skipper Bait[[/size]]

**Summary:** An anomalous individual believed to be affiliated with the anomalous terrorist organization known as the Foundation. Demonstrated possible teleportation/materialization abilities at moment of capture, though it has not exhibited them since.

[[/div]]
[[/tab]]
[[tab Suspect Description/Capabilities]]

**Name:** Unknown, offered codename of “Agent Dumah.”

**Irregularity Cross-reference:** Human, Foundation, Teleportation, Terrorist

**Physical Description:**

||~ Sex ||~ Height ||~ Weight/Build ||~ Race ||~ Hair ||~ Eyes ||~ Identifying Attributes ||
||Male||67 in||175, medium||Levantine||Black||Brown||Currently none, wore Foundation-issue fatigues at time of arrest||

**Capabilities:** Suspect’s sudden appearance at Ft. Hoover suggests that it possesses the ability to either teleport or to otherwise achieve instant materialization. Since then, the suspect has not demonstrated this ability, though it is unknown if it this is due to inability or unwillingness to do so. Suspect’s implied affiliation with the Foundation as a field operative suggests a competent standard of training with regards to anomalous object interaction/capture, as well as basic combat training, evidenced by his resistance during initial arrest.

**Purpose/Motive:** Unclear from interrogation. However, given his affiliation with the Foundation, he is assumed to support said organization’s goals, though these are also currently unclear. Due to the Foundation’s denial of his existence (see History Log, Item 2), it is believed that the suspect may be a clandestine operative, though officially disavowed.

**Modus Operandi:** Unclear from interrogation. Exact Foundation operating procedures are still unknown, though active espionage efforts continue. Although it was initially hoped that interrogation of “Agent Dumah” could yield valuable intelligence concerning this area, the suspect has thus far proven to be highly resistant to all forms of interrogation. Current working theories are that the suspect is a member of a special operations team that the Foundation deploys to identify/capture high priority anomalies.

**Behavior:** Suspect is cooperative with most requests, excluding any pertaining to origin and mission. Interrogation has thus far proved ineffective with the suspect, indicating a high degree of anti-interrogation training. Suspect seems to be especially resistant to threats of punishment or withholding of future inmate privileges, for reasons unknown.

[[tab Evidence]]

**A: Foundation-Issue Fatigues:** Suspect was wearing this set of Foundation-issue military fatigues when he was captured. Patches and insignias on the fatigues do not match the design of any known Foundation division, though the overall style remains similar to those worn by other captured suspects.

**B: Box of Dirt:** During initial detainment, “Agent Dumah” was carrying a cardboard package. When opened, the package was found to be filled with dirt. Later testing has failed to establish any kind of additional anomalous properties for said dirt, and the suspect has refused to reveal the significance of this package.

[[tab Bureau Record]]

**Current Status:** In UIU custody at Camp Mueller.

**Crimes:** Violation of 173 U.S.C. § 12 A,[[footnote]]Commonly known as the Anomalous Possession and Experimentation Act (APEA)[[/footnote]], Violation of 174 U.S.C. § 1B, [[footnote]]Commonly known as the Anomalous Individual Existence Act (AIEA)[[/footnote]], domestic terrorism, resisting arrest, illegal trespassing and 4 counts of assaulting a law enforcement officer.

**Sentencing:** Indefinite Detention

**History of UIU Action:** 

//02/03/2017:// Suspect initially materializes in the middle of Ft. Hoover’s barracks. UIU agents in the barracks were not prepared for a sudden incursion; as a result, 4 agents were left in critical condition during the suspect’s attempt to escape the facility. Since this incident, the suspect has demonstrated no open hostility, and has not contested the charges that he is accused of.

//03/06/2017:// Following a temporary halting in hostilities during Operation Heavenfall, suspect was offered as part of a potential hostage exchange, but was rejected on the grounds of Foundation denial of his existence. Both diplomatic and intelligence cables were not able to determine the suspect’s exact role within the Foundation at this time.

//06/15/2017:// Ft. Hoover was attacked by Foundation Mobile Task Forces Beta-6, Tau-3, and  Epsilon-4 during a counter-offensive to reclaim Ft. Hoover following the failure of Operation Heavenfall to encircle Foundation forces in the midwest. Foundation elements managed to free numerous captured operatives before eventual relief was provided by elements of the UIU 3rd Division and the US Army’s 15th Infantry Regiment. Surveillance tapes show operatives from MTF Beta-6 liberating several captured personnel from the secure wing that suspect Dumah is housed in, but no attempt was made to free him, despite ample time remaining to do so.

//06/18/2017:// Suspect was transferred from Ft. Hoover to Camp Mueller to undergo processing as an anomalous POW, as it was deemed unsafe to continue housing the suspect in a former Foundation base and proven military target.

Is this thing recording? Fuck, okay.

My name’s 2nd Lieutenant James Finch, Technical Officer, 1st Grade, UIU Corps. Assigned to Case “Skipper-Bait,” UIU File 2017-003, stationed at Camp Mueller. Primary duty is monitoring anomalous capabilities of the suspect, known as “Agent Dumah.”

I’m making this report on here because no one else seems to give a shit anywhere else, so I might as well stick it here so that some higher up sees it eventually, if only because it triggers some error on their system. I get it, post-Boston incident, everyone has way too much to handle to take a look at some old can terrorist, but this has been bothering the hell out of me, until today.

See, it never made any sense to me how the Foundation treated this guy before they went belly up. Even after we went full terrorist designation, we were still working the backchannels to get some exchanges going, and yet, not once did they try to get this dude back, or even confirm that he existed. When they hit Ft. Hoover, not one of their special forces teams tried to break him out. It didn’t make any sense, until our intel boys cracked the latest data dump we recovered.

You wanna know why the Foundation never recovered him? Because according to their records, Yehuda Mizrachi, or “Dumah” died 4 years ago. KIA. Killed by some anomaly gone rogue in their base. We’ve been trying to ransom a dead man back to the organization that watched him die.

The obvious question is, “Then who the fuck do we have locked up in Cell 13B?” Beats the hell outta me, but I can’t get a hold of anyone else who might have something to do with that question. I guess when cans start leveling entire cities, people care a lot less about anything that happened before that point.

I’m gonna try to do some more digging. Maybe it’s some super deep black ops shit, and they needed to wipe his record. Maybe not. Maybe this rabbit hole has an ending. If not, who gives a shit, at least I’m gonna be doing something when the world ends, not sitting around with my thumb up my ass.

I think we fucked up.

Part of the reason Mizrachi’s here and not getting quietly disposed of like so many other Foundation agents is because we thought he was a can man, and might pull some weird anomalo-shit on us.

But I’m pretty sure he’s not actually a can man at all.

I tried running some of the refurbished Foundation-tech on him, and none of it registers on their scale. Either he’s so strong that he can trick this sensor (in which case I’m fucked, so it doesn’t matter anyway), or he’s not actually a can man. Since one of those options involves me not being //totally// screwed, I’m going with that as my working hypothesis. Of course, if that shitshow in Asia gets any more widespread, it might be a moot point. Hell, it's hard to get anything done nowadays, since security is getting tighter and tighter. Feels pretty Hoover-ish up in here, honestly.

Anyway, this still doesn’t tell me exactly why he’s here, or what’s actually going on with him. At this point, I doubt he's a covert op, because I'm pretty sure that the Foundation would've done //something// at this point, if only just to tie up loose ends. But like I said, I'm pretty sure he's not a can man either. If he’s not a can man though, then how the hell is a dead man sitting in our cells?

I’ve got some ideas. Let’s see if there’s any proof behind them.

“Ah, Officer. Come for another round? You look like you're anticipating something. Will it be the hot irons and rack this time?”

“I have something to show you.”

“I’ve already told you, I do not recognize any-”

“This one’s different. Indulge me. Take a look at this.”

“...Where did you get this?”

“It’s yours, isn’t it? Or, not quite yours. But this ID belongs to someone very much like you.”

//No response.//

“Mr. Yehuda Mizrachi, born May 6, 1985, in Kibbutz Ma’agan Michael, graduated from Tel Aviv-”

“Look, I get it! I get it. What of it?”

“I thought I just explained, didn't I, Mizrah?”

“Very coy, Officer. Since I see no armed guards or anomalous capture police, I take it that you haven’t shared this to anyone else yet.”

“Smart cookie. I see why the Foundation snatched you up. No, I haven’t told anyone yet, but that might change depending on what you do.”

“And what exactly would that be?”

“Tell me who you really are. Where you came from. Why you’re here. Everything.”

“That doesn't sound very much like me at all.”

“If you don't, I’ll run off and spill the secret behind Camp Mueller’s most infamous mystery resident. That he’s not so special after all. That you have no further use to us here, meaning that all your special privileges get revoked. I get a promotion, and you get the death sentence thanks to the good ol’ AIEA.”

//Sound of laughter.//

“What’s so funny, Mizrachi?”

“Your threats are meaningless to me. I gave myself up for a dead man the moment I got trapped here in your world. Do what you want. My job is finished, my home is safe. I've held up the bargain."

“What job? What bargain?”

“Even if I told you, you wouldn't get it.”

“Why don't you just try?”

“I've added another stake to the Palisade.”

“What is the Palisade?”

//No response.//

“We don't have to kill you, you know. I could make your life comfortable here. Or I could make it much more uncomfortable.”

“You already know I'm not very susceptible to torture. I'm sure you could eventually break me, even with my training. Maybe I'd babble anything to get you to stop. But how would you ever know which was the truth?”

“If you believe you're dead anyway, why not just tell me?”

“Maybe I don't want to.”

“Why? Are you afraid?”

“No.”

“Guilty?”

“No. Never. Never. Do you know why I told you and your fellow agents that my name is Dumah?”

“Enlighten me.”

“In classical Aramaic, Dumah is the word for silence. Accordingly, in my faith, Dumah is the angel of silence, an aspect of death. Dumah is the voice whispering in your ear when the end is near. Dumah is the voice telling you that it will all be over in a flash. He brings an end to suffering.”

“Poetic. What’s the point?”

“You want to know why I won't tell you the truth? Because no matter what, you cannot stop what has already been set into motion. There is nothing more that can be done for you or I. So with the end so near, it is better to be silent, I think. That way, we may accept the end with as little pain as possible. Much like Dumah, it is the only mercy that I can offer you."

It’s the box, it’s the //fucking// box. I don’t know what exactly he did, or how this goddamn box fits in, but it does.

Half the Eastern seaboard just disappeared last week. One moment it was there, and the next, it was gone, like someone just pressed delete in Photoshop. No cities, no people, not even enough time for anyone to react. Just gone. Some bright-eyed tech who was picking up the pieces of what was left got the brilliant idea of testing the air where Philadelphia used to be, and got a hit for traces of extradimensional shit permeating the entire area.

We ran an analysis here using our new Foundation-tech on a whim, just to see if anything we had in our storage had any matches. Maybe whatever happened there is related to something that we have going on here, you know?

And I got a 100 per-fucking-cent match that whatever’s in the air where the East coast used to be is from the exact same reality that his fucking box of dirt is from.

I don’t know what’s happening. I don’t know why the world is ending, or what Mizrachi did to us. And when I went to see him today, all I found was a dead body. Strangled himself in his own cell, and god knows how he managed to do it. So I've got no answers. No leads. No time.

Someone has to know. Someone has to figure out where this is all coming from.

Please, someone save us.
