> **Incident Report ID #:** 07a8
> 
> **Summary:** Incident 07a8 began with Site 31 entering a state of complete lockdown. No reason for this lockdown was given, and all communication channels to and from Site 31 were blocked. As per standard lockdown protocol, Foundation forces surrounded Site 31 to prevent escape of potential anomalous threats, but no incursions into Site 31 were made.
> 
> After 3 months with no cessation of lockdown nor any communication from inside of the site, a contingent of armed personnel overrode the lockdown and entered the site. Several cadavers belonging to Site 31's personnel team were discovered. Autopsies later confirmed that all had died two months prior to discovery, and had all died from a bullet wound to the heart. No bullets were recovered from these cadavers.
> 
> The cadaver of Researcher Jacob Dylan was found curled up inside of a cabinet in one of the facility's break rooms. Researcher Dylan held an MP5 machine gun and a Zeta-9-Class Audio Recording Unit. Cause of death was determined to be sudden brain trauma.
> 
> Of note is a file on Site 31's mainframe, titled "SCP-4785," created by Researcher Dylan, detailing an event where a cognitohazard of some kind affected the entirety of Site 31. In addition, although many of the files on Researcher Dylan's audio recorder were corrupted, a version of TSATPWTCOTTTADC.aic, the site's local artificial intelligence, was stored on the recorder's hard drive, although in a corrupted state.
> 
> Foundation technical personnel were able to restore this clone of TSATPWTCOTTADC.aic to partial functionality. Personnel with appropriate clearance may see Interview Log 07a8 for more information.
> 
> It is currently under debate whether to posthumously award Researcher Dylan with the Foundation Star or to dishonourably discharge them from the Foundation.
