17.  [[[SCP-517]]] - Grammie Knows
* Of course she knows, dearie. Come and let Grammie put your mind to rest…

16. [[[SCP-5555-J]]] - The Chibinator
* Be afraid. Be very, very afraid.

15. [[[SCP-597]]] - The Mother of the All
* Happy Mother's Day!

14. [[[SCP-003]]] - Biological Motherboard
* Pulsing veins carry data, while the strange, chitinous surface flexes and moves almost imperceptibly, as if stretching to find a more comfortable position.

13. [[[SCP-149]]] - The Blood Flies
* Feel that itching? The one that started at the small, red bump on your arm and slowly worked its way up? That heavy, stuffy feeling in your nose? It's not allergies.

12.  [[[SCP-165]]] - Creeping Hungry Sands of Tule
* One of the oldest articles on the site, and has some of the best images. Will make you think twice about that sand box.

11. [[[SCP-611]]] - Parasitic Toothpick
* Nature's oral fixation deterrent.

10. [[[SCP-455]]] - Cargo Ship
* SCP-455 sits in the water, the waves pounding out a dull thudding against it's rusted hull.

9. [[[SCP-882]]] - A Machine
* A monstrous heap of moving metal, you soon discover that it is no purposeless pile of junk. As you listen to its grinding, wheezing, clicking, and whirring, you begin to hear a message; it is the voice of God, gently whispering for you to heed its call, and help it realize its enigmatic machinations.

8. [[[SCP-055]]] - [unknown]
* The self-keeping secret. Nobody knows what it is, nobody knows what it does. Anyone who sees it forgets about it entirely in the space of minutes. It may have killed hundreds of people, or it may have been placed by an outside force to invisibly monitor the Foundation or humanity…. and nobody would know.

7. [[[SCP-2558-J]]] - Puffer Kittens
* No, wait, what? Really? Woah.

6. [[[SCP-093]]] - Red Sea Object
* A red stone disc with unknown engravings that is attracted to mirror surfaces. However, when held by a test subject, the stone allows the user to move //through// the mirror. It quickly becomes apparent though that whatever is on the other side isn't your reflection...
 
5. [[[SCP-804]]] - World without Man
* A beautiful globe, built by an artist group...that causes the rapid decay and disintegration of every nearby man made object...and Man itself, for that matter.  What's more, this is no accidental device, or a strange twist of time and space...//it is doing exactly what the builder wants it to do.// 

5. [[[SCP-002]]] - The "Living" Room
* A huge ball of tissue, like a massive tumor, with a heavy hatch door, leading in to... a small, crappy apartment.  A bit of a let down... until testing shows that everything inside is made from human beings.  Woven hair, sculpted bone, and other, less pleasant, materials make up the furniture...//and SCP-002 is always looking to grow.//


4. [[[SCP-914]]] - The Clockworks
* A device capable of taking the simplest things, and changing them at their basest level to something else, though what it produces can vary greatly. Most often, the returned items in question can be related to the original, but other times.... //The results are unique.// 

3. [[[SCP-294]]] - The Coffee Machine
* An example of how something as seemingly ordinary as a vending machine has the potential to horrifically bend the universe to a mechanically cold will. Make your selection with a great deal of care.

2. [[[SCP-184]]] - The Architect
* While not a strange item by itself, its effect can create things far outside human understanding.  This item shows that a SCP does not always need to be horribly dangerous to be interesting and creepy.

1. [[[SCP-173]]] - The Sculpture
* Perhaps the first SCP ever created, no one really remembers. It stands a a shining example as to why the Foundation exists.
