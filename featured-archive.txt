5. [[[SCP-002]]] - The "Living" Room
 * A huge ball of tissue, like a massive tumor, with a heavy hatch door, leading in to...a small, crappy apartment.  A bit of a let down...until testing shows that everything inside is made from human beings.  Woven hair, sculpted bone, and other less pleasant materials make up the furniture...//and SCP-002 is always looking to grow.//


4. [[[SCP-914]]] - The Clockworks
 * A device capable of taking the simplest things, and changing them at their basest level to something else, though what it produces can vary greatly. Most often, the returned items in question can be related to the original, but other times.... //The results are unique.// 

3. [[[SCP-294]]] - The Coffee Machine
* An example of how something as seemingly ordinary as a vending machine, has the potential to horrifically bend the universe to a mechanically cold will. Make your selection with a great deal of care.

2. [[[SCP-184]]] - The Architect
* While not a strange item by itself, it's effect can create things far outside human understanding.  This item shows that a SCP does not always need to be horribly dangerous to be interesting and creepy.

1. [[[SCP-173]]] - The Sculpture
* Perhaps the first SCP ever created, no one really remembers. It stands a a shining example as to why the Foundation exists.
