+ Dr. Light's Introduction to Not Being Kickbanned on the Chat

#Site19 is our chatroom, and hopefully the place where you'll begin your fantastic journey with the SCP Foundation, before you're even a member of the site. That said, we'd like you to follow a few guidelines to maintain order, prevent entropy, facilitate constructive conversation, and ensure everyone has a good time:
* **Don't Spam:** This should be obvious- don't post excessive amounts of links, pictures, random words, etcetera, and especially don't continue if you've been asked to stop, or you're setting yourself up for a kickban.
* **Play Nice:** Again, should be obvious, but anything excessively derogatory, racist, sexist, homophobic, etcetera, will get you kickbanned. 
* **Have a little self-respect:** This is a community of writers, and as you can imagine, our levels of respect for you will increase exponentially if you can capitalize, punctuate, avoid chat acronyms, use grammar, and all of that fun stuff. 
* **Maturity:** There's no quick and easy definition for this, so here it is: We expect some modicum of maturity amoung new users. If you act like you are twelve, expect no love from us, and for god's sake, if you are twelve, you should probably get out of here while your sanity is intact.
* **Know your place:** While we respect and want to encourage your opinions- okay, some of us, some of your opinions- keep in mind that this site works in specific ways, and may not understand these ways yet. It's fine to disagree with an article or have suggestions, but if you show up on the doorstep of the chat with a million things to correct, nits to pick, and ways to make the site “better”, you'll come across as full of yourself- just lay low for a bit and earn your respect.
* **If you have a problem:** Tell a mod. Believe it or not, new as you may be, you do have some rights. If you think you're being treated unfairly, antagonized, or insulted, go ahead and PM a Mod or Admin, and enlist their help. 
* **Expect a little abuse:** Fine, expect to get treated unfairly, antagonized, and insulted maybe a little. Getting kicked is also for fun, it's not the same as a ban. Don't take us too seriously.
* **Know your chat:** /me is for emotes, as in “/me armwrestles 173”. /nick changes your name, as in “/nick Doctor_Light”. God help you if you decide to use colored text.
* **Mark your NSFW links:** And don't hold us liable for anything you may find therewithin.
* **We do talk about things other than SCP there:** although if we are talking about something else and you want to talk about something in the Foundation, you will usually find some willing people.
* **If you have questions, ask:** We want to help you and share ideas.
* **Do not click any link that Ecks posts:** Do not click on any link that Ecks posts. Ever.
