title:Chat Guide
+ Dr. Light's Introduction to Not Being Kickbanned on the Chat
//With Commentary By Dr. Bright//

#Site19 is our chatroom, and hopefully the place where you'll begin your fantastic journey with the SCP Foundation, before you're even a member of the site. That said, we'd like you to follow a few guidelines to maintain order, prevent entropy, facilitate constructive conversation, and ensure everyone has a good time:
* **Don't Spam:** This should be obvious- don't post excessive amounts of links, pictures, random words, etcetera, and especially don't continue if you've been asked to stop, or you're setting yourself up for a kickban. //Also, anyone caught linking to malicious or illegal content will be kickbanned without warning.//
* **Play Nice:** Again, should be obvious, but anything excessively derogatory, racist, sexist, homophobic, etcetera, will get you kickbanned. //Excessively. A little of such things rarely, not so much a problem. But I take antisemitism poorly.//
* **Have a little self-respect:** This is a community of writers, and as you can imagine, our levels of respect for you will increase exponentially if you can capitalize, punctuate, avoid chat acronyms, use grammar, and all of that fun stuff. //Chatspeak is a kickable offense, repeatedly and until you get the point.//
* **Maturity:** There's no quick and easy definition for this, so here it is: We expect some modicum of maturity amoung new users. If you act like you are twelve, expect no love from us, and for god's sake, if you are twelve, you should probably get out of here while your sanity is intact. //Along those lines, while we do goof around a lot, time and a place. Someone talking about the death of their father is not the time to launch into porn and knock knock jokes.//
* **Know your place:** While we respect and want to encourage your opinions- okay, some of us, some of your opinions- keep in mind that this site works in specific ways, and may not understand these ways yet. It's fine to disagree with an article or have suggestions, but if you show up on the doorstep of the chat with a million things to correct, nits to pick, and ways to make the site “better”, you'll come across as full of yourself- just lay low for a bit and earn your respect. //And, chances are, we've heard it all before. The site HAS been around for a while now. If we haven't enacted the idea yet, there's probably a reason.//
* **If you have a problem:** Tell a mod. Believe it or not, new as you may be, you do have some rights. If you think you're being treated unfairly, antagonized, or insulted, go ahead and PM a Mod or Admin, and enlist their help. //Along those lines? Know who your mods and Admins are. Over in the [[[guide-to-newbies]]] there is a wonderful section detailing us. Use it, love it, live it.//
* **Expect a little abuse:** Fine, expect to get treated unfairly, antagonized, and insulted maybe a little. Getting kicked is also for fun, it's not the same as a ban. Don't take us too seriously. //Heh heh heh.//
* **Know your chat:** /me is for emotes, as in “/me armwrestles 173”. /nick changes your name, as in “/nick Doctor_Light”. God help you if you decide to use colored text. //Ask around for anything else, we're helpful.//
* **Mark your NSFW links:** And don't hold us liable for anything you may find therewithin. //Although why you're chatting with us at work, is beyond me.//
* **We do talk about things other than SCP there:** although if we are talking about something else and you want to talk about something in the Foundation, you will usually find some willing people. //But don't be a douche about it. If it feels like people are ignoring you, they probably are. They're allowed to.//
* **If you have questions, ask:** We want to help you and share ideas. //Anyone with a little symbol next to their name (changes based on chat program) is a good place to start.//
* **Do not click any link that Ecks posts:** Do not click on any link that Ecks posts. Ever. //Well, maybe just once, so you know.//
* //One of my personal requests: Please use a chat name close to that of the one you use on the Wiki. It makes things a whole lot easier.//

__**A Few Words**__

Hello there, my fine chum. I'm A Fat Ghost, and I'm in charge of the channel. I'm usually lurking around in there, and you're probably going to run into me eventually, eh. There are a few things you should know so that we can get along, and so that you'll have tonnes of fun in channel:

-I call everyone son, all the time. Even pregnant women. If this bothers you, I apologise, but you'll have to live with it.

-If a mod is giving you an unreasonably hard time, toss me a PM. Try to get some evidence to back up your claim if at all possible, though.

-On the opposite side of that coin, if you complain to me about being kicked (unless it's excessive and unwarranted/unfunny), you'll probably be asked to chill out.

-Excessive capslock is not one of my favourite things, and can result in tempban.

-If you pitch an idea/draft for an article in channel, myself and the other senior staff may seem to be be antagonising you, but we're really just trying to help. Don't turn it into a fight; we can't force you to do diddly-runk to your draft.

-Oh, and since most new kids tend not to check the topic line, we do have a place for article drafts, and long concepts. It's [http://scp-eval.pastebin.com/a pastebin site] at: scp-eval.pastebin.com

-No zalgo. //Jesus H CHRIST thank you. -- Fish//

Now come on in and join the fun, eh. There's a night and a day shift, so there should be at least one kid who knows all this stuff in there.
