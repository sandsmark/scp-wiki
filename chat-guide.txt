* Talking about SCPs.

[[tab Connecting]]
++ Chat Connection

Our chat rooms are IRC channels on the SynIRC IRC network. If you don't know anything about IRC, [http://www.ircbeginner.com/ircinfo/ircc-commands.html this link (click!)] is a good place to start.

Our general chat channel is #site19. Our help channel is [http://05command.wikidot.com/chat #site17].

++ Registration

We require you to register your nickname before joining chat. Here's how:

# Type the following: /msg NickServ register PASSWORD EMAIL - Substitute the stuff in caps with your desired password and email. Do not leave a space before the / and do not type anything else in the same message.
# Once this is done, you should get a confirmation email. Be sure to check your spam folder if you have trouble finding it. Follow the directions in the email. Once that's all taken care of, you simply type "/msg nickserv identify [password]" (without the quotes) in your client. You have now registered!

[!--  FOR WHEN +R IS DOWN:

We highly recommend that you register your nickname upon joining chat. Here's how to do that.

Type the following: /msg NickServ register [password] [email]

Substitute the stuff in brackets with your desired password and email. (And remember to //not// leave in the brackets!) 

Once this is done, you should get a confirmation email. Follow the directions in the email. Once that's all taken care of, you simply type "/msg nickserv identify [password]" (without the quotes) in your client. You have now registered!

Sometimes (for instance, when dealing with trolls), we put +R on the chat. This means only people with registered nicks join. Register your nick now, so you won't be left out in the cold if that happens!

[[tab Guidelines]]

+ Chat Guidelines

* **Age:** You must be 15 years of age or older. If you act the same as an underaged person, you may be banned.
* **Topics:** Discussion about SCP ideas and drafts take priority. Any NSFW (Not Safe For Work) links must be tagged as NSFW (check below for examples). No illegal activity is permitted, period. 
* **Reporting:** If you need a chat operator, you can often get our attention by saying "ops" or sending an operator a private message.

++ Behavior 

It is the responsibility of each chat user to know what is or is not acceptable behavior.

The following are some specific things to avoid. This doesn't include every possible offense.

* **Trolling**: Acting deliberately inflammatory. If you're doing it, you know you're doing it. If ops believe you're trolling and you don't think so, then you need to rethink your behavior. This includes targeting people or a group of people based on their gender, sexuality, race, etc.
* **Harassment**: Asking for pictures, pressuring discussion of sex lives, etc. PMing or repeatedly talking to a user who has asked you to stop talking to them.
* **Creepiness**: Making others uncomfortable by behaving in a way that would be socially inappropriate if done in public.
* **Almost anything involving rape.**
* **Spamming.**
* **Brigades**: Do not use #Site19 as a base for bothering people on other sites. No one cares. Do not use #Site19 to get an SCP you hate downvoted. You'll be banned.
* **Being Annoying/Disruptive:** If an OP says you're being annoying, //listen// and try to improve. Being annoying isn't entirely against the rules, //but you can still be banned for it// if it gets bad enough. This could be derailing chat, over-proselytizing your opinions, being incoherent, antagonizing others, roleplaying, backseat modding, etc.
* **Pronounbot-fuckery:** Adding joke pronouns to Secretary_Helen is one of the quickest ways to earn a one-week ban. See the "Chatbots" tab for more information.

++ NSFW

Tag all these kinds of images.

# **Porn, nudity, and other sexual images.** Tag "NSFW".
# **Extreme violence and gore.** Tag "NSFW".
# **Jump scares, screamers, flashing lights.** For these, **you must always identify what they are when you link them**. This is because we have members with epilepsy, and this can trigger seizures.

++ Discipline & Banning

Channel operators (ops) have the authority to dictate the course of conversation. Operator orders are to be followed at all times. 

Operators have the authority to warn and ban users. Minor or accidental offenses may result in multiple warnings or several shorter bans. Especially bad offenses may result in a ban of any length.

Respect chat operator decisions, even if you disagree with them. If you feel that a decision was in error, you may protest the action in the Help Channel, [http://05command.wikidot.com/chat #Site17] or in a private message to chat operator. Generally, you should discuss the situation with a different chat operator, especially if you were the one warned or banned.

The final authorities on disciplinary matters or rule disputes are the Chat Administrators (listed in the "Chat OPs") tab. Please report any serious misuses of authority to them.

[[collapsible show="Standard Ban Escalation For Operator Reference"]]
Operators may decide to follow or ignore this at their discretion. It's only listed here for reference.
* Warning. A warning may involve asking a person officially to stop doing something, or it may be a kick, or it may be an immediate 'warning ban' of any length between 5 minutes and 2 days.
* Week Ban.
* Month Ban.
* Year Ban.
* Permanent Ban.

[[tab Chatbots]]

+ Jarvis

Jarvis is #site19's primary bot. Jarvis is maintained by [[*user anqxyr]]. When in #site19, you may use Jarvis as a reference and general tool for a variety of purposes. The commands can be found [http://scp-stats.wikidot.com/jarvis here]. 

If you want to check multiple pages at once, always use a PM to Jarvis. Do not flood the bot, even in PMs, as this can cause crashing.

**Do not bring any of your own bots into this chat without permission. Do not invite our bot into your own channel without permission.**


+ Helen

Helen is a secondary bot whose primary function is to remember the pronouns that chat members use and/or accept. You may add your own pronouns to the bot, or use a command to check the pronouns of other members. Helen is maintained by [[*user DrMagnus]]. A list of Helen's commands can be found [http://home.helenbot.com/usage.html here].


Inputting joke pronouns ('helicopter', 'meme', etc.) is a tempbannable offense, usually 1 (one) week to start. Don't screw with the pronoun bot: it's offensive to many and irritating to most. This is a very firmly enforced rule.
