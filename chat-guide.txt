[[tab Welcome - IRC Basics]]

+ **{{<+Reverend> IRC is just multiplayer notepad.}}**

**If you're already a well-versed IRC user,** then point the client of your choice to **{{irc.synirc.net}}** (Ports 6660-6669 are available, as well as 6697 and 7001 for SSL) and join us in #site19 (you will need to register and identify before joining). Please proceed to the 'Rules and Guidelines' tab.

**If none of that makes a bit of sense to you,** please read these basics in their entirety before  attempting to chat, because it probably will not work otherwise.

IRC (Internet Relay Chat) allows for discussions across multiple **channels**, which are prefixed with a **{{#}}**. For example, **{{#football}}**, **{{#cats}}**, and **{{#techsupport}}** would be topical channels people might congregate in. You can also have private, 1-on-1 conversations with people, and even create your own channels to discuss whatever you'd like. 

On the "Click Here To Chat" tab, you'll see something that looks like this:

[[image chat01.png]]

If you have never registered a synIRC account (which is entirely separate from Wikidot accounts), you will be required to do so before you can join our main channel. This is easy. Go ahead and hit Login, you'll see something like this:

[[image chat02.png]]

I've highlighted some relevant areas.

1.) **Status Bar.** All channels and private messages will show up here, and there are options and the leave/quit button on the right-hand side. The "Status" link is clickable and shows server information.
2.) **User List.** Some users have a prefix in front of them, they indicate a user's rank in the channel. They are **{{~}}** (owner), **{{&}}** (admin), **{{@}}** (op), **{{%}}** (half-op), and **{{+}}** (voice). Different channels use these ranks differently. In **{{#site19}}** and **{{#site17}}**, all users with a rank except **{{+}}** are chat staff (or bots that assist in performing channel duties). Users with the rank of **{{+}}** in #site17 are not staff, but are trusted non-staff users that can reliably give good information on basic questions.
3.) **Chat window.** The screenshot above shows what a channel will normally look like on joining, showing the topic, then a list of users.
4.) **Input box.** This is where you type your messages, as well as commands like **{{/register}}** and **{{/identify}}**.

+ Registration

You'll also notice that when you joined, if you don't have a registered account, you didn't join **{{#site19}}** even though it's in the list, because we require **registration** to join that channel. Let's take care of that now. Click Status at the top to switch to the server window, then type in:

**{{/register PASSWORD EMAIL}}**

This will be the password you use to log on to the chat in the future, so make sure it's something you will remember. When you're ready, hit Enter.

Example:

[[image chat03.png]]

If you did everything right, you'll see a message appear from NickServ (Nickname Services) that reads, **{{A passcode has been sent to (email), please type /msg NickServ confirm <passcode> to complete registration}}**. This can take a couple of minutes to arrive, and has been known to end up in junk mail occasionally, so please take a look there as well. When you find it and confirm the passcode as instructed, you are registered! Please note registrations expire after 35 days with no activity.

Now that you've registered, you simply need to **identify**. This logs you in, and allows you to join registered-only channels. This is done by entering:

**{{/identify PASSWORD}}**

Enter that the same way you put in your registration. Now, going forward, you can put that password in the password field highlighted above in red //before// you get connected, and it'll take care of identifying for you.

+ Channels

We make use of three primary channels here.

* **{{#site19}}** - For general discussion.
* **{{#site17}}** - For getting help from staff.
* **{{#thecritters}}** - For giving and receiving critique on drafts and ideas.

There are also official channels for staff teams:
* **{{#site11}}** - Technical Staff
* **{{#site34}}** - Licensing Team
* **{{#site81}}** - Community Outreach
* **{{#workshop}}** - Staff and community-led seminars and workshops.
* **{{#millennium-ooc}}** - Hub for [*http://scp.bz/origins SCP Horizons] roleplaying channel.

To join a new channel, it's as simple as **{{/join [channel]}}** (this can be entered in any chat window). E.g., **{{/join #thecritters}}** will take you to **{{#thecritters}}**. (This can also be shortened to **{{/j #thecritters}}**. You can leave a channel with **{{/part #channel}}** in any window, or **{{/part}}** from the window of the channel you want to part.

You can double-click a name in the user list to begin a private message conversation with that person, and all your channels and conversations are available in the status bar.

[[tab Rules and Guidelines]]

+ Chat Guidelines

* **Age:** You must be 18 years of age or have parental consent to be on the synIRC network, and must be 15 regardless of consent to chat in official SCP channels. If you act the same as an underage person, you will be banned.
* **Topics:** Discussion about SCP ideas and drafts take priority. Any NSFW (Not Safe For Work) links must be tagged as NSFW (check below for examples). No illegal activity is permitted, period. 
* **Reporting:** If you need a chat operator urgently, you can often get our attention by saying **{{ops}}** and we will be notified. Abusing this ping will result in disciplinary action.

++ Behavior 

It is the responsibility of each chat user to know what is or is not acceptable behavior.

The following are some specific things to avoid. This doesn't include every possible offense and if you're not sure whether you're about to break a rule, ask rather than finding out the hard way.

* **Trolling**: Acting deliberately inflammatory. If you're doing it, you know you're doing it. If ops believe you're trolling and you don't think so, then you need to rethink your behavior. This includes targeting people or a group of people based on their gender, sexuality, race, etc.
* **Harassment**: Asking for pictures, pressuring discussion of sex lives, etc. PMing or repeatedly talking to a user who has asked you to stop talking to them. You can be banned from the synIRC network altogether for this.
* **Creepiness**: Making others uncomfortable by behaving in a way that would be socially inappropriate if done in public.
* **Almost anything involving rape.**
* **Spamming.** You can be banned from the synIRC network altogether for this.
* **Brigades**: Do not use #Site19 as a base for bothering people on other sites. No one cares. Do not use #Site19 to get an SCP you hate downvoted. You'll be banned.
* **Being Annoying/Disruptive:** If an OP says you're being annoying, //listen// and try to improve. Being annoying isn't entirely against the rules, //but you can still be banned for it// if it gets bad enough. Example offenses here include (but are not limited to) derailing chat, over-proselytizing your opinions, being incoherent, antagonizing others, roleplaying, backseat modding, and the use of slurs. This includes racist, sexist, and sexual-oriented slurs, as well as slurs targeting the mentally disabled or differently abled such as //retard// or //spaz//.
* **Pronounbot-fuckery:** Adding joke pronouns to Secretary_Helen is one of the quickest ways to earn a one-week ban. See the "Chatbots" tab for more information.

++ NSFW

Tag all these kinds of images.

# **Porn, nudity, and other sexual images.** Tag "NSFW".
# **Extreme violence and gore.** Tag "NSFW".
# **Jump scares, screamers, flashing lights.** For these, **you must always identify what they are when you link them**. This is because we have members with epilepsy, and this can trigger seizures.

++ Discipline & Banning

Channel operators (ops) have the authority to dictate the course of conversation. //**Operator orders are to be followed at all times.**//

Operators have the authority to warn and ban users. Minor or accidental offenses may result in multiple warnings or several shorter bans. Especially bad offenses may result in a ban of any length.

Respect chat operator decisions, even if you disagree with them. If you feel that a decision was in error, you may protest the action in the Help Channel, [http://05command.wikidot.com/chat #Site17] or in a private message to a chat operator. Generally, you should discuss the situation with a different chat operator, especially if you were the one warned or banned.

The final authorities on disciplinary matters or rule disputes are the Chat Administrators (listed in the "Chat OPs") tab. Please report any serious misuses of authority to them.

[[collapsible show="Standard Ban Escalation For Operator Reference"]]
Operators may decide to follow or ignore this at their discretion. It's only listed here for reference.
* Warning. A warning may involve asking a person officially to stop doing something, or it may be a kick, or it may be an immediate 'warning ban' of any length between 5 minutes and 2 days.
* Week Ban.
* Month Ban.
* Year Ban.
* Permanent Ban.
[[/collapsible]]

Bans will generally appear in the [*http://05command.wikidot.com/chat-ban-page Chat Ban Page] with a link to an O5 thread.

[[tab Chatbots]]

+ Secretary_Helen

Secretary_Helen is #site19's primary bot. Helen is maintained by [[*user DrMagnus]]. When in #site19, you may use Helen as a reference and general tool for a variety of purposes. Additionally, Helen can remember the pronouns that chat members use and/or accept. You may add your own pronouns to the bot, or use a command to check the pronouns of other members. A list of Helen's commands can be found [http://home.helenbot.com/usage.html here].

Inputting joke pronouns ('helicopter', 'meme', etc.) is a tempbannable offense, usually 1 (one) week to start. Don't screw with the pronoun bot: it's offensive to many and irritating to most. This is a very firmly enforced rule.

If you want to check multiple pages at once, always use a PM to Helen. Do not flood the bot, even in PMs, as this can cause crashing.

**Do not bring any of your own bots into this chat without permission. Do not invite our bot into your own channel without permission.**
