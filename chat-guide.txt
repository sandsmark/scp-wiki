+ New And Improved Guide to #site19

Hello kids! Today we're going to talk about #site19, and the rules and expectations therein! #site19 is an IRC channel in the Serenia irc network. If you don't know what anything I just said means, Google is a lovely and welcoming friend. 

#site19 is open to all: you don't have to be a site member to join. It's a great place to talk about SCPs, get advice about your article, and the like. It's an even better place to socialize with members of the site from around the world, including some of our oldest and most involved members. The chat, like the wiki, has a variety of rules that you will be expected to follow. Claiming ignorance of a rule is never a proper defense, so let's go over them quickly.


++ General Guidelines

* **Don't Spam:** This should be obvious- don't post excessive amounts of links, pictures, random words, et cetera, and especially don't continue if you've been asked to stop, or you're setting yourself up for a kickban.

* **Be Respectful:** Again, should be obvious, but anything excessively derogatory, racist, sexist, homophobic, et cetera, will get you kickbanned. Now, this being the internet, we do expect people to play around, but expect no mercy if we think you're serious. Furthermore, know that linking to malicious or illegal content is a great offense and you will be kickbanned without warning.

* **Type properly:** This is a community of writers, and as you can imagine, our levels of respect for you will increase exponentially if you can capitalize, punctuate, avoid chat acronyms, use proper English grammar, and all of that fun stuff. You will likely be warned quickly about this. Little things like not capitalizing the word 'I' may be ignored, but expect no mercy if you use 'u' as a word. Also, do not under any circumstance use colored font. Just, don't.

* **Nicknames:** Names with unnecessary numbers or alternative characters in them are discouraged though not strictly prohibited. This is a community that encourages originality through proper writing. For example, 'Gnosis24' is okay if for some reason you really hold an attachment to that 24. xXxGnOsIs_SePhIrOtH_69420xXx will get you banned so quickly that you won't know what happened.

* **Maturity:** There's no quick and easy definition for this, but let it suffice to say that we expect some modicum of maturity among all of our users. While no topic is taboo in #site19, we expect everyone to handle all topics with grace. We do goof around a lot, but everything has a time. Someone talking about the death of their father is not the time to launch into porn and knock knock jokes. We have an informal rule that everyone in #site19 should be 15 or over. However, if we have an idiotic 26 year old, and an eloquent and mature 14 year old, it is not the latter who will be kickbanned.

* **Have a little patience:** While we respect and want to encourage your opinions- okay, some of us, some of your opinions- keep in mind that this site works in specific ways, and you may not understand these ways yet. It's fine to disagree with an article or have suggestions, but if you show up on the doorstep of the chat with a million things to correct, nits to pick, and ways to make the site “better”, you'll come across as full of yourself. Now, by all means, do share these ideas if you have them, but do it in a respectful manner.

* **If a mod tell you to drop it, you drop it:** Regardless how important a topic seems to you, when a mod says it's time to talk about something else, do it. Not drop it after you get the last word - not ignore it - you drop it, immediately, no questions. If you must continue discussion, take it to PMs or to another channel.  We don't do this to be nazis, but it's easier to stop arguments before they get too heated.

* **If you have a problem:** Tell an Admin. Believe it or not, new as you may be, you do have some rights. If you think you're being treated unfairly, antagonized, or insulted, go ahead and PM a Mod or Admin, and enlist their help. //Along those lines? Know who your mods and Admins are. Over in the [[[Guide to Newbies]]] there is a wonderful section detailing us. Use it, love it, live it.//

* **Expect a little abuse:** Fine, expect to get treated unfairly, antagonized, and insulted maybe a little. Also: **__Getting kicked is for fun.__** It's not the same as a ban. Don't take us too seriously. We're pretty lighthearted a lot of the time, and someone that can take a joke is much more well liked than someone that can't.

* **Know your chat:** /me is for emotes, as in “/me armwrestles 173”. /nick changes your name, as in “/nick Doctor_Light”. God help you if you decide to use colored text. Ask around for anything else, we're helpful

* **Mark your NSFW links:** And don't hold us liable for anything you may find therein. But seriously, this is the closest thing we have to a hard and fast rule, so MARK THE DAMN LINKS. **NO**, the fact that it should be obvious in context is not an excuse. The fact that the link is to DickLickingSlags.com is no excuse either. If a link is NSFW, I want it marked no matter what.

* **No Role Playing:** Trying to act 'in-character' in #site19 will get you banned so fast you don't know what happened. 

++ Chat Suggestions

* Avoid discussing decomming 682. We're tired of this conversation.

* This should be obvious, but, don't try to force-feed something down people's throats. We do not care about your webcomic. Or your blog. Or anything else you desperately want attention for. If the topic comes up, sure, you can share it. But dropping a link every five minutes, or any time a new person comes in, is frowned upon. This goes double for your cool SCP idea.

* Many people have chat software that pings them when their names are mentioned in chat. This can get troublesome when someone's name is a common enough word. It gets worse when people deliberately abuse this feature to annoy others. Courtesy is a good thing. You should be sure to check your language, and try to avoid pinging someone accidentally. Especially when that someone you think is funny to ping is Break, because I'm pretty sure she's started to reach the point where she will rain down bans upon those who take her name in vain. Hushed tones, people. Hushed tones. Also, the word 'contradiction' is a lovely alternative to 'paradox'.

++ Bots!
There are a number of bots that join us on the channel. They are entertaining, they are helpful, and they do //not// like to be abused. The channel is closed to new bots. If you'd like a new feature to be implemented, by all means ask, but know that it's likely not going to be coded.

* Nala provides a variety of features within the chat, including SCP lookup (SCP-173 alone, or !SCP-173 within text), tag search (!tag keter), main list search (!search cat), dice rolling (!roll 2d6), and reporting the last time someone said or did something in the channel (!seen Clef). Nala is maintained by Mackenzie (Aelanna in chat).

* Hatbot is, well, a chatbot that uses Markov chains to learn to converse with the rest of the chat. He is frequently a source of simultaneous headache and hilarity. Hatbot is maintained by seisatsu. **WARNING**: Don't try to force-feed hatbot lines. Paradox is very unamused by these attempts, and will not take kindly to it. Also, abusing hatbot in a way that makes the chat completely degenerate and become everyone spouting random nonsense is just going to get the bot kickbanned (again) and everyone reprimanded, so don't go there.

* Alanna, formerly known as the Magic-8_Ball, provided several features in the channel, many of which have been picked up by Nala in Alanna's absence. Alanna was maintained by Fifthman.
