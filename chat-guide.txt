+ Newer and Even More Improved Guide to #Site19

Hello kids! Today we're going to talk about #site19, and the rules and expectations therein! #site19 is an IRC channel in the SynIRC irc network. If you don't know what anything I just said means, Google is a lovely and welcoming friend. 

#site19 is open to all: you don't have to be a site member to join. It's a great place to talk about SCPs, get advice about your article, and the like. It's an even better place to socialize with members of the site from around the world, including some of our oldest and most involved members. The chat, like the wiki, has a variety of rules that you will be expected to follow. Claiming ignorance of a rule is never a proper defense, so let's go over them quickly.

++ General Principles

* **When in doubt, apply Wheaton's Law:** Wheaton's law states, quite simply, "Don't be a dick." So if you're doing something, and it makes you a dick? Don't do it. That covers 90% of everything in the rules below.

* **These rules are by no means exhaustive:** No set of rules can cover every possible situation. That doesn't mean that just because something is left out in these rules, it's not important. Where there is any doubt, the decision of the mod is final.

++ Chat Behavior

* **Be Civil:** Anything excessively derogatory, racist, sexist, homophobic, et cetera, will not be tolerated. This being the internet, we do expect people to play around, even disagree with each other, but flaming and nasty behavior is strictly discouraged. 

* **Leave your baggage at the door:** Disagreements outside the chat should stay outside the chat. This is not Facebook. We're not interested in your personal drama. 

* **Be Understandable:** This is a writing community. The primary language is English. We expect you to use the language properly so we can understand you. This also applies to your chat nickname: Names with unnecessary numbers or alternative characters in them are discouraged though not strictly prohibited. Don't use colored text in chat. Don't spam. Don't use excessive formatting. 

* **Maturity:** The SCP Foundation is a creepypasta wiki that covers some fairly mature subject matter. We expect chat users to be able to handle the same level of mature subject matter. For this reason, young children under the age of 14 are strictly forbidden from entering the chat.
 * However, any NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content MUST be tagged as such. This applies even if you think it's obvious from the link name: tag ALL NSFW content.

* **Respect the Mods and Admins:** The mods and admins in #site19 are, for the most part, not evil. They're there to keep the chat moving smoothly and to deal with any problems as they come up. Don't make their life harder. If a mod tells you to drop a subject, drop it immediately: don't get in the last word, don't say one more thing, just stop and move on.
 * If, however, you think a mod or admin is abusing their power, tell someone. The final authority in the chat is Clef, the Chat Owner: report any serious breaches of behavior to him.

++ Discussion Suggestions.

The following subjects have been done to death, and we're sick and tired of hearing about it:
* Decommissioning anything.
* Killing SCP-682
* Saving SCP-231
* Putting X into SCP-914
* Quoting Shakespeare around pooryoric

The following memes and subjects are not appreciated here. Don't bring them up. If you don't know what these are, don't ask in the chat, PM someone, or google it.
* Zalgo

In addition, several prominent site users left under inauspicious circumstances. We're not interested in talking badly about people behind their backs, so please don't ask what happened to them. If you must know, PM someone instead of bringing it up in public.

One last note: #site19 is a strictly out of character environment. No roleplaying is to be done here. If you must roleplay, we have a variety of wonderful roleplaying chatrooms to participate in: ask an Admin or Mod for more details. 

++ Bots
Aside from the two following, do not bring any bots into this chat.

* Grapewhistle is the latest in chatbot technology and has subsumed Nala's functions. Grapewhistle performs lookup-by-number (SCP-173, or !SCP-173 when embedded in text), search-by-title (!search cat), dice-rolling (!roll 2d6: do not abuse), reporting the last time someone said something in chat (!seen Clef), and a multitude of other helpful and unhelpful functions for which there is not space here. Grapewhistle is maintained by Gnosis.

* Nala provided a variety of features within the chat, many of which were previously performed by Magic-8_Ball, AKA Alanna, and many of which are now performed by Grapewhistle, AKA Grapewhistle. Nala was maintained by Mackenzie (Aelanna in chat), and is kept in reserve for when Grapewhistle goes down.

The following bots are no longer active in this chatroom.

* Hatbot was a chatbot that uses Markov chains to learn to converse with the rest of the chat. He was frequently a source of simultaneous headache and hilarity, but soon proved to be overly disruptive, as chat users would spend their time feeding him lines, often times overriding other users with actual questions and concerns. For that reason, hatbot has been taken offline for the time being. Hatbot was maintained by seisatsu.

* Alanna, formerly known as the Magic_8-Ball, provided several features in the channel, many of which have been picked up by Nala in Alanna's absence. Alanna was maintained by Fifthman, and is no longer active.
