title:Chat Guide
+ Introduction to Not Being Kickbanned on the Chat
//By Dr. Light, with Commentary by Dr. Bright, A Fat Ghost, Snorlison, and Paradox//

#Site19 is our chatroom, and hopefully the place where you'll begin your fantastic journey with the SCP Foundation, before you're even a member of the site. That said, we'd like you to follow a few guidelines to maintain order, prevent entropy, facilitate constructive conversation, and ensure everyone has a good time:

* **Don't Spam:** This should be obvious- don't post excessive amounts of links, pictures, random words, etcetera, and especially don't continue if you've been asked to stop, or you're setting yourself up for a kickban. //Also, anyone caught linking to malicious or illegal content will be kickbanned without warning.//
* **Play Nice:** Again, should be obvious, but anything excessively derogatory, racist, sexist, homophobic, etcetera, will get you kickbanned. Now, this being the internet, we do expect people to play around, but expect no mercy if we think you're serious. //Excessively. A little of such things rarely, not so much a problem. But I take antisemitism poorly.//
* **Have a little self-respect:** This is a community of writers, and as you can imagine, our levels of respect for you will increase exponentially if you can capitalize, punctuate, avoid chat acronyms, use grammar, and all of that fun stuff. //Chatspeak is a --kickable-- --banable-- SUPERGODZILLAKICKABLE offense, repeatedly and until you get the point.//
* **Maturity:** There's no quick and easy definition for this, so here it is: We expect some modicum of maturity among new users. If you act like you are twelve, expect no love from us, and for god's sake, if you are twelve, you should probably get out of here while your sanity is intact. //Along those lines, while we do goof around a lot, time and a place. Someone talking about the death of their father is not the time to launch into porn and knock knock jokes.//
* **Know your place:** While we respect and want to encourage your opinions- okay, some of us, some of your opinions- keep in mind that this site works in specific ways, and may not understand these ways yet. It's fine to disagree with an article or have suggestions, but if you show up on the doorstep of the chat with a million things to correct, nits to pick, and ways to make the site “better”, you'll come across as full of yourself- just lay low for a bit and earn your respect. I mean, don't be afraid to share ideas for improvements by any means, just do it with a bit of humility. //And, chances are, we've heard it all before. The site HAS been around for a while now. If we haven't enacted the idea yet, there's probably a reason.//
* **If you have a problem:** Tell a mod. Believe it or not, new as you may be, you do have some rights. If you think you're being treated unfairly, antagonized, or insulted, go ahead and PM a Mod or Admin, and enlist their help. //Along those lines? Know who your mods and Admins are. Over in the [[[guide-to-newbies]]] there is a wonderful section detailing us. Use it, love it, live it.//
* **Expect a little abuse:** Fine, expect to get treated unfairly, antagonized, and insulted maybe a little. Also: **__Getting kicked is for fun.__** It's not the same as a ban. Don't take us too seriously. //Heh heh heh.//
* **Know your chat:** /me is for emotes, as in “/me armwrestles 173”. /nick changes your name, as in “/nick Doctor_Light”. God help you if you decide to use colored text. //Ask around for anything else, we're helpful.//
* **Mark your NSFW links:** And don't hold us liable for anything you may find therewithin. But seriously, this is the closest thing we have to a hard and fast rule, so MARK THE DAMN LINKS. **NO**, the fact that it should be obvious in context is not an excuse. The fact that the link is to DickLickingSlags.com is no excuse either. If a link is NSFW, I want it marked no matter what. //Although why you're chatting with us at work, is beyond me.//
* **We do talk about things other than SCP there:** although if we are talking about something else and you want to talk about something in the Foundation, you will usually find some willing people. //But don't be a douche about it. If it feels like people are ignoring you, they probably are. They're allowed to.//
* **If you have questions, ask:** We want to help you and share ideas. //Anyone with a little symbol next to their name (changes based on chat program) is a good place to start.//
* **Do not click any link that Ecks posts:** Do not click on any link that Ecks posts. Ever. If you value your sanity, anyway. //Well, maybe just once, so you know.//
* //One of my personal requests: Please use a chat name close to that of the one you use on the Wiki. It makes things a whole lot easier.//
* //NO ROLEPLAYING IN THE MAIN CHANNEL. THIS IS A TEMPBAN-WORTHY OFFENSE// 

++ __**A Few Words From Our Chat Administrators**__

__**Paradox's Golden Rule**__ 
* Don't Suck. Pretty much all the rules boil down to this. In case you're not aware on how to do this, let me explain. "Not sucking" is actually very easy, and all it means is that you have to have the basic human decencies of respect, consideration, and maturity. Without these things, you can't very well interact amiably with other people, and I expect you to be amiable in my chat. If you bring a bad attitude, don't expect us to put up with it.  If you're about to say something, make sure it's to contribute to the the conversation and to the enjoyment and fulfillment of all. If you're just flapping your gums (fingers?) to draw attention or put others down, I'm going to kick you pretty quickly. If you can manage this most of the time, you probably won't have too many issues.


__**Some words from the Ghost**__ 

Hello there, my fine chum. I'm A Fat Ghost, and I'm an admin in the channel. I'm usually lurking around in there, and you're probably going to run into me eventually, eh. There are a few things you should know so that we can get along, and so that you'll have tonnes of fun in channel:

* I call everyone son, all the time. Even pregnant women. If this bothers you, I apologise, but you'll have to live with it.

* If a mod is giving you an unreasonably hard time, toss me or another admin a PM. Try to get some evidence to back up your claim if at all possible, though.

* On the opposite side of that coin, if you complain to me about being kicked (unless it's excessive and unwarranted/unfunny), you'll probably be asked to chill out.

* Excessive capslock is not one of my favourite things, and can result in tempban.

* If you pitch an idea/draft for an article in channel, myself and the other senior staff may seem to be be antagonising you, but we're really just trying to help. Don't turn it into a fight; we can't force you to do diddly-runk to your draft.

* Oh, and since most new kids tend not to check the topic line, we do have a place for article drafts, and long concepts. It's a pastebin site right [http://scp-eval.pastebin.com here].

* No zalgo.
     * //Jesus H CHRIST thank you Ghost because I am SO VERY VERY SICK OF THIS. -- Fish//

Now come on in and join the fun, eh. There's a night and a day shift, so there should be at least one kid who knows all this stuff in there.

__**snorlison's pleas**__ 

* Please avoid discussing decomming 682. Such discussions tend to annoy the old-timers who've seen the same conversation happen a few times already. Sure, that method you just thought up probably seems really original, and innovative, and a sure-bet -- the problem is we've probably heard it before. We remain unmoved by it. So here's a compromise, and a way you can actually contribute to the wiki. Instead of just decomming 682, really challenge yourself. Think of the most impressive way you can to off 682, and then //subvert// that method. Figure out how 682 survives what you just did to it. What we really want you to tell us is the story of what 682 is, not how it died. //Actually, most of us have heard plenty about 682, 076, Montauk, and would prefer if you just shut up.//

* References to media that you enjoy are okay, but they seem to be often misused. A reference you need to trumpet at the top of your lungs isn't a good reference. References are something that should be shared as a quiet and subtle mark of shared interest, not the equivalent of geek territory marking.
-//On that note: We do not care about your webcomic. Or your blog. Or anything else you desperately want attention for. If the topic comes up, sure, you can share it. But dropping a link every five minutes, or any time a new person comes in, is frowned upon. This goes double for your cool SCP idea.// -Bright

* Speaking of references, you know that really clever one you were about to drop on pooryoric? The one involving Shakespeare? Yeah, we've heard it. He's heard it. I've heard it. Here's some advice -- resist the temptation to utter any sentence involving the phrase "I knew him well" and the words "pooryoric" and "alas" in any possible permutation.



++__**Bots!**__ 
There are a number of bots that join us on the channel. They are entertaining, they are helpful, and they do //not// like to be abused. The channel is closed to new bots. If you'd like a new feature to be implemented, by all means ask, but know that it's likely not going to be coded.
* Messily coded in Ruby on top of Jonathan Drain's excellent [http://www.d20source.com/roleplaying-tools/dicebot Bones IRC Dicebot], Alanna, formerly known as the Magic-8_Ball, provides some additional features that you may find helpful. Current features include links to Wolfram (!wolfram <query>), Google (!google <search terms>), and SCP lookup (SCP-XXX or !SCP-XXX). A more detailed command list may be obtained by PMing !help to Alanna. Alanna is maintained by Fifthman.
* Hatbot is, well, a chatbot that uses Markov chains to learn to converse with the rest of the chat. He is frequently a source of simultaneous headache and hilarity. Hatbot is maintained by seisatsu. **WARNING**: Don't try to force-feed hatbot lines. Paradox is very unamused by these attempts, and will not take kindly to it. Also, abusing hatbot in a way that makes the chat completely degenerate and become everyone spouting random nonsense is just going to get the bot kicked and everyone reprimanded, so don't go there.
* Nala supplements Alanna with her own dice and page lookup commands. Nala is maintained by Mackenzie.
