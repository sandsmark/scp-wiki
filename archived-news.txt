* **April 30, 2012**  --  I'll be honest. I've been around a //while//. Not many things impress my cold, jaded soul anymore. And then... This: **[http://scpcb.wordpress.com/ SCP-Containment Breach]**. I cannot easily express in words how amazingly awesome something like this is.  And this is just the bare bones of it. I think I speak for both the featured authors and the members of the wiki itself when I say: //We are both extremely grateful and awestruck that someone would like to craft something like this from something we helped create. Thank you and keep up the good work//.

* **February 24, 2012**  --  Sad times, all.  There's been a lot of excitement over the recent fan developed game of [[[SCP-087]]] (including a lot from the staff here and at [http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/02/21/the-neverending-stairway-scp-087/ other places]), but recent reports in the [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/realtime-chat site chat] (and forum threads such as [http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?s=e052a108f9ed5d4e3cda6aa549a82629&t=2564311 these]) have led us to suggest that users avoid downloading this game from untrustworthy sources.  Make sure you scan these files for viruses before you run them.

* **January 31, 2012**  --  First it was the [http://scp-ru.wikidot.com/ Russians], and now... The Chinese? Yes, folks, that's right. **There is a group of people translating SCPs into Chinese!  Check them out [http://scpfoundation.123ubb.com/ here] and see what pages have been translated.** Currently, this is pretty embryonic (just a message board with posted translations), but tell me it doesn't make you proud that something you're working with has been translated into four languages, three scripts, and is read across the globe. Enjoy!
