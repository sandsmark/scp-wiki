[[collapsible show="Show Interview Log" hide="Hide Interview Log"]]

> **Foreword:** Interview conducted by Dr. Hannibal Romero, a psychology specialist.
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Dr. Romero:** This is Dr. Hannibal Romero, beginning interview with —
> 
> **:** Do not give it a title.
> 
> **Dr. Romero:** I'm... I'm sorry?
> 
> **:** Do not give it a title. It does not need a title.
> 
> **Dr. Romero:** What do you mean by "it"?
> 
> **:** It has no need for identity. An identity gives it form. It is clean.
> 
> **Dr. Romero:** Are you referring to yourself? Are //you// it?
> 
> // is silent.//
> 
> **Dr. Romero:** Okay... I'll just assume that's a yes, then. Can you tell me about yourself? Were you ever a part of a person before?
> 
> **:** It was not part of a person, it is.
> 
> **Dr. Romero:** It is what?
> 
> // is silent.//
> 
> **Dr. Romero:** Fine, be difficult. Can you explain anything more about yourself? Do you know what caused your anomalous properties to manifest?
> 
> **:** It wanted to be clean. It is not clean yet, but it will be clean of addiction in time.
> 
> **Dr. Romero:** Addiction?
> 
> **:** It was addicted to... It was addicted to attachment.
> 
> **Dr. Romero:** Attachment? Could you explain more?
> 
> **:** When a person is addicted to attachment, they fear death. It feared death. It was addicted to attachment, as others are addicted to alcohol, cigarettes or heroin. It needed life to live... but it soon learned that was not true. It does not need life to live. It needs to be clean.
> 
> **Dr. Romero:** What do you mean "clean"? How does one become "clean"?
> 
> **:** How does one become clean of any addiction? Less over time. It realized it could be clean by eating less, feeling less, having less form. It broke its addiction to nutrition first, one of the most useless ideas most humans believe is a requirement. Eventually, it learned to stop feeling pain, which aided in it removing its form.
>  
> **Dr. Romero:** That's... That's disgusting...
> 
> **:** But it is not clean yet. It is almost clean, but it is not clean yet.
> 
> **Dr. Romero:** What? What would happen if you would become totally clean?
> 
> **:** I would be free of addiction. Free of life, unable to die. I would be perfect.
> 
> **Dr. Romero:** You would be... Wait, you just referred to yourself as "I".
> 
> // is silent.//
> 
> **Dr. Romero:** , are you familiar with Bai Zhào? Bai went missing ██ years ago after being released from a rehab center, and you just so happen to be a genetic match.
> 
> // is silent.//
> 
> **Dr. Romero:** Are you Bai Zhào?
> 
> **:** It should thank you. Containment and lack of social interaction was all it needed to become clean.
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statements:** The subject refused to answer any further questions. Interview was terminated soon after.

> On 9/28/2017, Dr. Romero opened 's containment unit to retrieve it for an interview. Upon opening, 's lungs were no longer observed to be breathing, and began to rapidly decay. It is unknown if  has breached containment or simply ceased to exist.

> **NOTE FROM THE DESK OF HANNIBAL ROMERO**
> 
> If you're wondering why I changed the containment procedures and locked the page, I can explain. 
> 
> It's not dead. I don't think it's dead. It might be dead, but I believe that it's not. If what it told me is true, then it could potentially be more dangerous than any of us ever expected, because it literally has cracked the code to existence. If something can literally will themselves into un-existence... then who's to say what can be willed into existence? The only way to contain something like this, is to believe that it exists at all, but if this even works, then God knows what else could be created like this. We have to test this theory whether we like it or not; we all need to believe that  still exists. If it makes it easier for people, we need to believe it's still alive, too. I don't care what it'll take to get people to believe this, but it needs to be believed in.
> 
> I could just be seeing things where there's only empty space, but... considering we're dealing with non-existence, that's exactly what I should be seeing.
