Anomalous item KY-2018-DW was neutralized on 08/27/18. Embedded Foundation agents with the Lexington, Kentucky police department intercepted a call from Diane Wharton, who reported "a strange man in a black uniform" exiting her home through a hole in the wall of her finished basement. The containment team positively identified the individual as Foundation personnel from an alternate reality, and cooperated with their counterpart in ensuring the aperture was sealed. A request to establish operational communications is pending review with both Foundations.

The video embedded below was uploaded to YouTube on 12/23/2018. Analysis determined that its creator (Delphinia Wharton, 16) had prolonged, previously unrecorded contact with KY-2018-DW. The item facilitated interaction between Ms. Wharton and a human inhabitant of the alternate reality. Due to the lengthy and otherwise unexceptional nature of this contact, de-realization of the affected memories is considered to be sufficient. Foundation agents generated a false report of a medical problem which required brief inpatient treatment, and administered [http://www.scp-wiki.net/updated-amnestics-guide class G amnestics] to Ms. Wharton during her hospital stay.
