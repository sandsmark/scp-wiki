title:The Great Short Story Contest
++ The Great Short Story Contest of February '10

* __**What is this?**__
 * Boys, Girls, tentacled beasts from the Marianas Trench, this is the first of what will hopefully be more writing exercises to come.

* __**The Challenge**__
 * To write a short story based off a simple SCP-related concept. Stories will be voted upon once submissions are over, and the winner will get...something. I don't know. We're working on it.

* __**So what do you need to do?**__
 * Write me a story. Submissions will be open on February 1st, and end on February 20th, after which will come voting. Voting may be opened sooner if no more submissions are added or coming after a certain point.
 * **NEW** - Multiple entries are allowed, of up to **three** entries per person. See Winning section for details.

* __**Voting?**__
 * Anyways, when all the submissions are in (and I'll ask when they're all in) we'll start doing the actual contest voting. Every individual will get three votes to place for any story or mix of stories they wish. I'll set up tabs on the story pages, and you'll actually edit the page to add in your vote **Don't cheat or I will find out.**
 * Voting is **Not open yet** but feel free to rate the stories as you see fit

* __**Winning?!**__
 * So, there will be a first, third, and second place awards. If you have submitted multiple entries, you can only win ONE place, meaning that you can't win both first and third or second and third. Instead we will go with the next highest bidder. Working on prizes.
