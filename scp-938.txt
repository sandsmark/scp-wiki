**Item #:** SCP-938

**Object Class:** Keter 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-938 is to be kept within Capacitor Bank Zero in Storage Warehouse Zero, dimensions 34m x 24m x 8m, at --Bio-Research and Containment Site-06-- Bio-Research and Containment Site-07 (see **Addendum 09-20-1991**). The floor, walls, and ceiling of Storage Warehouse Zero are to be constructed of unreinforced high-strength concrete lined with 5cm of insulating PVC.

Capacitor Bank Zero should consist of twenty-seven thousand (27000) high energy density capacitors, each capable of storing 19kJ. Capacitor storage racks are to be positioned over the warehouse's built-in floor drains. Capacitors should be oriented on these racks to prevent fluids dripping onto capacitors below.

Capacitors containing SCP-938 appear to seep a dark red fluid, identified as [REDACTED] blood, in a manner visually similar to condensation. This is normal, and not a sign that SCP-938 containment has been breached. This phenomenon may be ignored, provided Storage Warehouse Zero's floor drains remain unobstructed and precautions are taken to ensure this blood does not interfere with capacitors positioned below. Should this phenomenon cease, site command is to be immediately informed of a potential breach of containment.

Lighting within Storage Warehouse Zero is to be provided by fiber-optic cables routed underground from adjacent structures; neither the cables nor their cladding may be electrically conductive. Personnel tasked to SCP-938 are to carry secondary chemical light sources in case of total power and lighting failure. Storage Warehouse Zero must be devoid of any electrical lines in or out and be a minimum of fifty meters from any adjacent structures. 

Both the structure and Capacitor Bank Zero should be inspected by four (4) Class D personnel supervised by two (2) Clearance Level Two research personnel and at least one (1) Clearance Level Three security officer weekly or immediately following any electrical storm occurring within twenty (20) kilometers. No electronic devices are to be brought into Storage Warehouse Zero without prior authorization of Level 4 research staff. Personnel implanted with pacemakers or metallic implants are denied access to the facility.

**Description:** SCP-938 is a predatory electrical entity. The entity may be regarded as having three distinct states: free, dormant, and active. In the free state, SCP-938 appears to exist as electrical potential of intensity similar to that which accompanies a moderate electrical storm; SCP-938 frequently travels with such storms.

SCP-938 enters electrical grids through lightning strikes, often causing a temporary loss of power. This entry into electrical systems represents the transition to its dormant state: upon infiltrating an electrical grid, SCP-938 typically selects a single occupied structure to monitor. During this phase, the only known indication of SCP-938's presence are anomalous readings by devices sensitive to electromagnetic fields (see below).

SCP-938 will enter its active state upon an electrical storm entering within approximately five kilometers of its current location. Its behavior in this state is characterized by interference with the function of electrical devices (see below), apparently to attract the attention of individuals within the building. Individuals which attempt to interact with affected devices are electrocuted; in all but two recorded instances, this has resulted in the immediate cessation of all neural impulses. In the aforementioned two instances, only the victims' hearts were stopped; both were successfully resuscitated, and both experienced long-term deleterious effects attributable to SCP-938's assault. See **Addendum 11-16-1987** for further information.

SCP-938's active state concludes when it returns to the atmosphere as lightning, rapidly dissociating to electrical potential and returning to its free state. SCP-938 has on at least one occasion vacated an occupied structure without attempting to attract the attention of its residents or visitors, and twice after (successful) efforts which appeared aimed at attracting the attention of singular individuals.

Analysis of high-precision electromagnetic field readings indicate anomalous, highly localized intensity fluctuations consistent with human neural activity in the vicinity of SCP-938. Conservative estimates place the lower bound of distinct neural patterns at approximately 100,000. Of the twelve successfully isolated, five indicate average levels of conscious thought, four indicate levels of activity above the norm, consistent with elevated stress levels, and three are consistent with stage N3 NREM sleep.

Periodically, SCP-938 will fixate on an individual; these individuals are designated SCP-938-A. Prior to feasibility of containment, SCP-938 was documented pursuing a single target for thirty-six (36) years, eleven (11) months, and six (6) days until the target died of natural causes (see **Addendum 12-19-1986**). The exact traits which prompt SCP-938 to fixate on an individual are unknown. In twelve of nineteen recorded instances, SCP-938-A were documented to suffer from a number of disorders relating to stress or paranoia, including post-traumatic stress disorder, paranoid schizophrenia, and a number of severe phobias; these disorders are likely the result of extended proximity to SCP-938 and not a criterion by which it bases target selection (see **Addendum 04-13-1979**).

**Addendum 03-06-1943:** In light of the tremendous electrical energy which constitutes SCP-938 and the inability of current technology to contain it, a different approach to the mitigation of its threat is necessary. Efforts should instead focus on understanding and predicting SCP-938's behavior to mitigate its threat until containment becomes feasible.

**Addendum 09-29-1944:** The electrical phenomenon commonly known as St. Elmo's Fire provides SCP-938 with a route of attack while in its free state. SCP-938-A [REDACTED] SCP-938. A Foundation personal security detail [REDACTED] suffered acute UV burns and permanent blindness; █ died of resultant infections.

**Addendum 01-13-1950:** SCP-938-A has been located and is in Foundation protective custody.

**Addendum 07-03-1969:** Security operatives responsible for ensuring the safety of SCP-938-A and researchers assigned to study SCP-938 have been folded into MTF Theta-9, "Bad Moon Rising." MTF Theta-9 will assume responsibility for ensuring the safety of SCP-938-A candidates and study of SCP-938 as circumstances allow.

**Addendum 04-13-1979:** Several members of MTF Theta-9 have reported subtle hallucinations and a vague sense of unease while in the vicinity of SCP-938. The most frequently reported hallucination has been irregular clusters of iridescent red eyes watching from poorly illuminated areas, including the shadows of personnel, foliage, and in a handful of reports, the night sky; Agent ███████ remarked he once mistook the phenomenon for stars. It is not believed to be a cause for concern at this time.
* **Note 02-22-1990:** Personnel responsible for the routine inspection and maintenance of SCP-938 containment have witnessed similar hallucinations in the vicinity of Capacitor Bank Zero despite no knowledge of MTF Theta-9's reports. Maintenance personnel most often report these clusters of eyes in the spaces between capacitors.

**Addendum 12-19-1986:** SCP-938-A has died of a heart attack. Ten minutes prior to SCP-938-A's death, an ambulance arrived at Safe House ██-█. No MTF Theta-9 operatives claimed to have requested emergency services and SCP-938-A denied responsibility. The ambulance was dismissed as a probable prank 911 call. Following SCP-938-A's heart attack, an attempt was made to contact emergency services. By the time assistance arrived, SCP-938-A had expired. Further investigation revealed the local emergency dispatch center received no initial call requesting assistance to Safe House ██-█. An emergency dispatcher on duty claimed his terminal indicated an unanswered request for emergency services at the address.

Reevaluation of feasibility of containment is underway.

**Addendum 03-11-1987:** Statistical observation of weather patterns within three thousand (3000) kilometers of SCP-938's confirmed locations, aimed at determining if SCP-938 is capable of altering local weather patterns, has proven inconclusive.

**Addendum 11-16-1987:** The deleterious effects suffered by both known SCP-938 survivors are the erasure of significant stretches of memory and drastic alteration of both individuals' mannerisms and personalities. During subsequent evaluation, both professed to experience persistent feelings of depersonalization and derealization. Medical and psychological evaluation results are available to research personnel on request.

**Addendum 06-02-1989:** Containment of SCP-938, while likely to require a substantial expenditure of resources, is believed to be potentially feasible. Additionally, a likely SCP-938-A candidate has been located. Upon construction of the necessary containment facilities, SCP-938-A will be used to lure SCP-938 into containment.

**Addendum 10-01-1989:** SCP-938 has been successfully captured. It will henceforth be housed within --Bio-Research and Containment Site-06-- Bio-Research and Containment Site-07. No testing or observation which would require or potentially allow SCP-938 to be removed from or escape containment within Capacitor Bank Zero is permissible.

**Addendum 09-20-1991:** Containment of SCP-938 has been compromised following a "Silent Night" breach scenario at Bio-Research and Containment Site-06. Site-06 infrastructure is not expected to be salvageable. New containment facilities must be constructed before SCP-938 may be recaptured.

**Addendum 12-21-2005:** On 12-19-2005, Dr. ██████ entered Storage Warehouse Zero to assist with inspection of SCP-938 containment carrying a flash drive on his person. After realizing his error the next day, Dr. ██████ reported the accidental breach of protocol and relinquished the flash drive for study, stating it was completely overwritten with meaningless data. This drive is available to research personnel for examination on request.
