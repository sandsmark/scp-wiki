Thornton was born and raised in █████, Illinois. During his studies (Master's degrees in Plant science with a minor in geography), he collaborated with the Foundation in eliminating various instances of anomalous data and suppress rumors on campus, and was subsequently recruited as his background as a member of the U.S. Army Reserve made him a valuable assets.

This one was the only one that stuck.

Agent Thornton and his friend, Agent Damian Hunter, have taken a liking to [[SCP-261]] and will experiment with it given even the slightest chance. Following an incident, Agent Thornton's natural hair color has permanently changed from a pale brown to sky blue.
