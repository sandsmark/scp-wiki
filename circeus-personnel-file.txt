Hunter was born and raised in █████, Illinois. During his studies (Master's degrees in Plant science with a minor in geography), he collaborated with the Foundation in eliminating various instances of anomalous data and suppress rumors on campus, and was subsequently recruited as his background as a member of the U.S. Army Reserve made him a valuable assets.

This one was the only one that stuck.

Agent Hunter and his friend, Agent Damian Thornton, have taken a liking to [[[SCP-261]]] and will experiment with it given even the slightest chance. Following an incident, Agent Hunter's natural body hair color has permanently changed from a pale brown to sky blue.
