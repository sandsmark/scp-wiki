[[/>]]

**Foreword:**  The SCP Foundation has discovered a substantial number of items which are simply too useless to merit further attention. This is a log of these items, many of which have been destroyed to avoid drawing interest and to save storage space. Others have been taken for personal use by the research staff. This log should be used as a resource, should knowledge of these items become useful or necessary in the future.
