title:Log Of Anomalous Items
**Forward:**  The SCP Foundation has discovered a substantial number of items which are simply too useless to merit futher attention. This is a log of these items, many of which have been destroyed to avoid drawing interest and to save storage space. Others have been taken for personal use by the research staff. This log should be used as a resource, should knowledge of these items become useful or necessary in the future. 
 – Doctor Sophia Light

Item Description: An unbreakable lamp
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ████████, ████
Record of Destruction: Not destroyed, in the possession of Doctor Rights.
Notes: This was the item that made me aware of the so-called “Non-SCP’s”. I attempted to borrow the item for research and testing, although I underestimated the lengths Rights will go to in order to protect her possessions. 

Item Description: A penny which, when flipped, will always land “Heads up”
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ████, ███████
Record of Destruction: Melted down
Notes: I can’t believe that none of the researchers kept this to win cheap bets with. I suppose that working with Bright is rubbing off on me.

Item Description: An ordinary brand ███████ number 2 pencil, which will balance easily on its tip for hours at a time.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ███████, ████████
Record of Destruction: Incinerated. 
Notes: I’m not even sure why this is considered an anomaly. Maybe it just had a very flat tip.

Item Description: A paperclip which induces mild nausea in most children within a .5-meter radius.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: █████, ████████
Record of Destruction: Melted down. The residue was tested to lack the effects of the original product.
Notes: I don’t want to know how they found out about this one.

Item Description: Extremely efficient gardening shears, brand unknown.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ███████, ██████
Record of Destruction: Not destroyed. In possesion of the roof gardening team.
Notes: They are, in fact, remarkably well-functioning.

Item Description: A large stone which generates mild internal heat, slightly warm to the touch. Otherwise not unusual.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ███████, ███████
Record of Destruction: Not destroyed. Placed in the core of Mt. ██████, an active volcano. Stone may or may not have been destroyed by heat.

Item Description: A bouquet of roses and other assorted flowers which are resistant to wilting, crushing, and burning. 
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ██████, ████████
Record of Destruction: Not destroyed.
Notes: I understand these once sat on Break’s desk while she was a secretary, but now that she is in training as a field agent, I’m not sure what’s happened to them.

Item Description: A painting (possibly a landscape, records are unclear) that gave a mild case of diaphramic spasms, or hiccups, to anyone who saw it.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ███████, ███████
Record of Destruction: Incinerated.
Notes: I understand that this would become a pain to deal with. But didn’t they at least try to see how it works?

Item Description: Normal garden slugs, whose trail has the exact same chemical composition and taste of commercial-brand ranch dressing. They also appear to reproduce by binary fission every week.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery:████, ███████
Record of Destruction: Salted, remains incinerated

Item Description: Hammer which will consistently miss the nail intended as its target when used by humans. Use of machinery or robots to guide the hammer results in normal function.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery:██████, ██████
Record of Destruction: Disassembled, pieces incinerated or melted down where appropriate.

Item Description: A parrot which, although not otherwise anomalous, seems to have memorized the entire works of Shakespeare.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ████████████, ███████
Record of Destruction: Not destroyed.
Notes: Luckily I was able to rescue this prior to its destruction, and I must say, it certainly does have an encyclopedic knowledge of the Bard’s works. Currently searching for an agent, researcher, or other party interested in keeping it.
//Interested. I'll fill out the necessary forms later. -Agent Yoric//
//Note: The parrot is now in the possession of Agent Yoric.//

Item Description: A small rock that emits a bright white light from an unknown source. Otherwise unremarkable.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ██████, ███████
Record of Destruction: Not destroyed. Currently in the possession of Doctor Light.
Notes: No radiation, no life signs, nothing. I plan to keep it as a reminder of the inexplicable nature of the universe. I also believe it will make a rather nice flashlight.

Item Description: A broken jian (Chinese sword) made of Telekill Alloy, crafted by Dr. Clef during the SCP-239 Clef-Kondraki incident.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: Site 19
Record of Destruction: Disassembled and melted back into component parts. Telekill Alloy was recovered for other use.
Notes: In the end, this just wasn't interesting enough to keep around.

Item Description: A 1964 Smith & Wesson .41 Magnum Revolver.  When any ammunition is fired from the third chamber, an unidentified male voice will shout "Nice shot!"
Date of Recovery: 09-03-████
Location of Recovery: Wichita, Kansas, USA
Record of Destruction: Not destroyed.
Note: Perfectly serviceable and well-maintained aside from the anomaly.  Secured in Site 19's vintage weapons depository.
Note: Accuracy or even proficiency with the firearm is not required for the anomaly to function.  Voice sounds whether or not the shot is, in fact, "nice".

Item Description: A wire clothes hanger.  Only long-sleeve, blue, men's dress shirts with collar sizes between 15.5" and 16.5" can successfully be hung upon it. All other clothing articles simply drop off to the floor when hanger is employed.
Date of Recovery: 09-15-████
Location of Recovery: Halifax, Nova Scotia, CA
Record of Destruction: Melted down.  Resultant slag shows no anomalous properties.

Item Description: One tetherball.  When employed as intended in a tetherball match, item shows a 5.9kg total increase in mass when moving counter-clockwise about the pole.  Weight returns to normal when moving clockwise.
Date of Recovery: 9-29-████
Location of Recovery: Bratislava, Bratislava Kraj, SK
Record of Destruction: Not destroyed.
Note: After thorough internal and external analysis, no harmful extradimensional properties were detected.
Note: Currently set up for play at Site 17, outdoor recreation zone ██, pole █.  

Item Description: An carton of  thirty (30) 60W incandescent bulbs
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ████████, ████
Record of Destruction: Destroyed, waste remanded to storage
Notes: 10 minutes preceding burn out of a light bulb, human subjects in the vicinity would become aware of an itching sensation. 

Item Description: High fidelity credenza mounted record player.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-1975
Location of Recovery: Tucson, Arizona
Record of Destruction: Not destroyed.  Housed in Site-64's recreation room.
Notes:  Musical records played in the device always produce a reproduction of a "live" performance of the piece, even if there was never such a performance made.

Item description: A flowering dogwood tree.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-20██
Location of Recovery: West Vancouver, BC
Record of Destruction: Not destroyed. Transplanted to TAF-1, Sector-28.
Notes: The tree appears to grow shoes. The growths are actually made of wood and bark. They are only clearly visible when the tree has shed its leaves.

Item description: A nuclear snowglobe.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: Sokrovenno, Russia
Record of Destruction: Not destroyed.
Notes: When shaken, instead of falling snow it shows a miniature-scale nuclear explosion. It emits no radiation, sound or force, and the explosion pattern changes every shake. Aftereffects such as radioactive snow and black rain have been observed. At random intervals the snowglobe would contain a small shed, car or truck, which react to the explosion.

Item description: The Metronome of the Endless Dance (formerly Keter-class SCP-███), which caused all people who heard or felt its rhythmic clicking to dance until they died from exhaustion.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ██████████, Texas
Record of destuction: Destroyed remotely with high-explosives; metal pieces were and collected melted into slag, while remaining pieces were collected and incinerated.
Notes: The costs to contain it outweighed any potential research or tactical benefit the Foundation could get.

Item description: The "Barf-larch tree".
Date of Recovery: 25-12-20██
Location of Recovery: ██████, California, USA
Record of Destruction: Destroyed by multiple shells from SCPS //Guardian//'s 57mm cannon during NSFS practice.
Notes: This appears to be a normal larch tree, but anyone who approaches too closely (3-4 meters) is overcome with nausea and begins to vomit. Analysis after the fact shows traces of apomorphine in the subject's blood. Item was deemed useless and too annoying to contain. Consequently, the target coordinates for //Guardian//'s next NSFS shoot were altered to those of the tree. It splintered and burned nicely; the ashes and splinters do not demonstrate the nauseating properties of the entire tree.

Item Description: A squirrel which constantly moved much slower then normal, even when jumping or falling, similar to "slow-motion" video footage.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ███████ Family Campgrounds, ███████
Record of Destruction: Shot with pistol. Corpse shown to have no unusual properties.

Pending further additions.
