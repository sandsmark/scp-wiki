**Foreword:**  The SCP Foundation has discovered a substantial number of items which are simply too useless to merit further attention. This is a log of these items, many of which have been destroyed to avoid drawing interest and to save storage space. Others have been taken for personal use by the research staff. This log should be used as a resource, should knowledge of these items become useful or necessary in the future. 
 – Doctor Sophia Light

Item Description: An unbreakable lamp.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ████████, ████
Record of Destruction: Not destroyed, in the possession of Doctor Rights.
Notes: This was the item that made me aware of the so-called "non-SCPs". I attempted to borrow the item for research and testing, although I underestimated the lengths Rights will go to in order to protect her possessions. 

Item Description: A penny which, when flipped, will always land "heads up".
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ████, ███████
Record of Destruction: Melted down.
Notes: I can’t believe that none of the researchers kept this to win cheap bets with. I suppose that working with Bright is rubbing off on me.

Item Description: An ordinary brand ███████ number 2 pencil, which will balance easily on its tip for hours at a time.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ███████, ████████
Record of Destruction: Incinerated. 
Notes: I’m not even sure why this is considered an anomaly. Maybe it just had a very flat tip.

Item Description: A paperclip which induces mild nausea in most children within a 0.5 meter radius.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████

Item Description: Extremely efficient gardening shears, brand unknown.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ███████, ██████
Record of Destruction: Not destroyed. In possession of the roof gardening team.

Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ███████, ███████
Record of Destruction: Not destroyed. Placed in the core of Mt. ██████, an active volcano. Stone may or may not have been destroyed by heat.

Item Description: A bouquet of roses and other assorted flowers which are resistant to wilting, crushing, and burning. 
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ██████, ████████
Record of Destruction: Not destroyed.
Notes: I understand these once sat on Break’s desk while she was a secretary, but now that she is in training as a field agent, I’m not sure what’s happened to them.

Item Description: A painting (possibly a landscape, records are unclear) that gave a mild case of diaphragmatic spasms, or hiccups, to anyone who saw it.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ███████, ███████
Record of Destruction: Incinerated.
Notes: I understand that this would become a pain to deal with. But didn’t they at least try to see how it works?

Item Description: Normal garden slugs, whose trail has the exact same chemical composition and taste as commercial-brand ranch dressing. They also appear to reproduce by binary fission every week.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery:████, ███████

Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ████████████, ███████
Record of Destruction: Not destroyed.
Notes: Luckily I was able to rescue this prior to its destruction, and I must say, it certainly does have an encyclopedic knowledge of the Bard’s works. Currently searching for an agent, researcher, or other party interested in keeping it.
//Interested. I'll fill out the necessary forms later. -Agent Yoric//
//Note: The parrot is now in the possession of Agent Yoric.//

Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ██████, ███████
Record of Destruction: Not destroyed. Currently in the possession of Doctor Light.
Notes: No radiation, no life signs, nothing. I plan to keep it as a reminder of the inexplicable nature of the universe. I also believe it will make a rather nice flashlight.

Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: Site-19

Item description: A nuclear snowglobe.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████

Record of Destruction: Not destroyed.
Notes: When shaken, instead of falling snow, it shows a miniature-scale nuclear explosion. It emits no radiation, sound, or force, and the explosion pattern changes every shake. Aftereffects such as radioactive snow and black rain have been observed. At random intervals, the snowglobe will contain a small shed, car, or truck, which reacts to the explosion.
//If nobody minds, I'd like this for my desk. -- Director Peters//

Item description: The "Barf-larch tree".
Date of Recovery: 25-12-20██
Location of Recovery: ██████, California, USA
Record of Destruction: Destroyed by multiple shells from SCPS //Guardian//'s 76mm cannon during NSFS practice.
Notes: This appears to be a normal larch tree, but anyone who approaches too closely (3-4 centimeters) is overcome with nausea and begins to vomit. Analysis after the fact shows traces of apomorphine in the subject's blood. Item was deemed useless and too annoying to contain. 
Note: The target coordinates for //Guardian//'s next NSFS shoot were altered to those of the tree. The ashes and splinters did not demonstrate the nauseating properties of the entire tree.
