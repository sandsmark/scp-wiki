[[/>]]

**Foreword:**  The SCP Foundation has discovered a substantial number of items which are simply too useless to merit further attention. This is a log of these items, many of which have been destroyed to avoid drawing interest and to save storage space. Others have been taken for personal use by the research staff. This log should be used as a resource, should knowledge of these items become useful or necessary in the future.

Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ████████, ████

Item description: Appears to be a normal larch tree, but anyone who approaches too closely (3-4 centimeters) is overcome with nausea and begins to vomit. Analysis after the fact shows traces of apomorphine in the subject's blood. Item was deemed useless and too annoying to contain.
