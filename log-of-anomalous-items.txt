title:Log Of Anomalous Items
**Forward:**  The SCP Foundation has discovered a substantial number of items which are simply too useless to merit futher attention. This is a log of these items, many of which have been detroyed to avoid drawing interest and to save storage space. Others have been taken for personal use by the research staff. This log should be used as a resource, should knowledge of these items become useful or necessary in the future. 
 – Doctor Sophia Light

Item Description: An unbreakable lamp
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ████████, ████
Record of Destruction: Not destroyed, in the possession of Doctor Rights.
Notes: This was the item that made me aware of the so-called “Non-SCP’s”. I attempted to borrow the item for research and testing, although I underestimated the lengths Rights will go to in order to protect her possessions. 

Item Description: A penny which, when flipped, will always land “Heads up”
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ████, ███████
Record of Destruction: Melted down
Notes: I can’t believe that none of the researchers kept this to win cheap bets with. I suppose that working with Bright is rubbing off on me.

Item Description: An ordinary brand ███████ number 2 pencil, which will balance easily on its tip for hours at a time.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ███████, ████████
Record of Destruction: Incinerated. 
Notes: I’m not even sure why this is considered an anomaly. Maybe it just had a very flat tip.

Item Description: A paperclip which induces mild nausea in most children within a .5-meter radius.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: █████, ████████
Record of Destruction: Melted down. The residue was tested to lack the effects of the original product.
Notes: I don’t want to know how they found out about this one.

Item Description: Extremely efficient gardening shears, brand unknown.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ███████, ██████
Record of Destruction: Not destroyed. In possesion of the roof gardening team.
Notes: They are, in fact, remarkably well-functioning.

Item Description: A large stone which generates mild internal heat, slightly warm to the touch. Otherwise not unusual.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ███████, ███████
Record of Destruction: Not destroyed. Placed in the core of Mt. ██████, an active volcano. Stone may or may not have been destroyed by heat.

Item Description: A bouquet of roses and other assorted flowers which are resistant to wilting, crushing, and burning. 
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ██████, ████████
Record of Destruction: Not destroyed.
Notes: I understand these once sat on Break’s desk while she was a secretary, but now that she is in training as a field agent, I’m not sure what’s happened to them.

Item Description: A painting (possibly a landscape, records are unclear) that gave a mild case of diaphramic spasms, or hiccups, to anyone who saw it.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ███████, ███████
Record of Destruction: Incinerated.
Notes: I understand that this would become a pain to deal with. But didn’t they at least try to see how it works?

Item Description: Normal garden slugs, whose trail has the exact same chemical composition and taste of commercial-brand ranch dressing. They also appear to reproduce by binary fission every week.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery:████, ███████
Record of Destruction: Salted, remains incinerated

Item Description: Hammer which will consistently miss the nail intended as its target when used by humans. Use of machinery or robots to guide the hammer results in normal function.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery:██████, ██████
Record of Destruction: Disassembled, pieces incinerated or melted down where appropriate.

Item Description: A parrot which, although not otherwise anomalous, seems to have memorized the entire works of Shakespeare.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ████████████, ███████
Record of Destruction: Not destroyed.
Notes: Luckily I was able to rescue this prior to its destruction, and I must say, it certainly does have an encyclopedic knowledge of the Bard’s works. Currently searching for an agent, researcher, or other party interested in keeping it.

//See me after class :p -Agent Yoric//

Item Description: A small rock that emits a bright white light from an unknown source. Otherwise unremarkable.
Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
Location of Recovery: ██████, ███████
Record of Destruction: Not destroyed. Currently in the possession of Doctor Light.
Notes: No radiation, no life signs, nothing. I plan to keep it as a reminder of the inexplicable nature of the universe. I also believe it will make a rather nice flashlight.

Pending further additions.
