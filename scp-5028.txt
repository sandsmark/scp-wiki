**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5028 has been implanted with a tracking chip and is currently residing in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site 77. Due to good behavior and cooperation with Foundation personnel, SCP-5028 is allowed access to basic Foundation facilities and amenities with the condition that he be accompanied by atleast one Foundation personnel. However, access to anything that would result in a breach of safety or classified protocol is prohibited. In the case of SCP-5028 turning on the Foundation and attempting escape, the staff accompanying SCP-5028 are equipped with tranquilizers containing diazepam. Should SCP-5028 use any magicks without proper authorization, these tranquilizers are to be used immediately.

**Description:** SCP-5028 is the designation given to a Type Blue sapient //Procyon lotor grinnelli//, colloquially referred to as a "Baja California Raccoon."  SCP-5028 appeared via a spontaneous dimensional gateway into Site-77's cafeteria on 01/02/20 at 12:00 p.m. Site 77's emergency protocols immediately went into effect, closing off all exits and windows. Foundation personnel then attempted capture of SCP-5028 and quickly came under fire from explosion magicks performed by SCP-5028 via usage of a small wooden staff. Although there were no casualties, over twenty personnel received 2nd degree burns, lacerations, and bruising from the explosions produced by SCP-5028 before it's subsequent capture.

On it's person, the following items were catalogued and placed into Foundation storage: 

1. Set of robes, made of out common wool and cloth. 
2. One wooden staff made out of a sturdy unknown type of wood.
3. One set of manacles that SCP-XXX was wearing.
4. One note that read as follows: 

> Greetings, dwellers of another world! If you perchance found this note,  you most likely are already acquainted with the individual with whom it came with. By order of His Grace, Emperor Henrik V of Empria, Farlo Hilldark has been expelled from this reality after being convicted of high treason and inciting rebellion. You are free to do whatever you wish with him, so long as it does not include his return. 
> 
>Have a merry day!
> 
> - Darvo Selivar, Councillor to His Highness.

Shortly after it's detainment, it became apparent that SCP-5028 was fully sapient and capable of rational thinking. This being the case, a interview was conducted with SCP-5028 a day later. 

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-5028 Interview 5028.1" hide="- Close Addendum"]]
> **Interviewed:** SCP-4258-1
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Shaw
> 
> **Foreword:** SCP-5028 was restrained for this interview in case of any unknown dangers.
> ----
> 
> **Dr. Shaw:** Says on this note here that your name is Farlo Hilldark. Is that correct?
> 
> **SCP-5028:** Yea, that's right! You're talking to a proud member of the Teban Mystics! Who in eight hells are you?!
> 
> **Dr. Shaw:** My name is Dr. Preston Shaw. What i'd like to talk about though is you. Can you elaborate on who the Teban Mystics are?
> 
> **SCP-5028:** We're a group that doesn't take kindly to our home being in Elrich hands, ya get me? 
> 
> **Dr. Shaw:** I'm not sure I follow. Where is Elrich, exactly?
> 
> **SCP-5028:** You don't know where Elrich is?! It's on the border of Dolton and Gamenia. Everyone knows that!
> 
> **Dr. Shaw:** Well, this might come as a bit of a shock to you, but it seems that you've been excommunicated from your reality. None of the places you mentioned exist here. 
> 
> **SCP-5028:** What?! You've gotta be [EXPLETIVE] kidding me! Send me back, send me back right [EXPLETIVE] now!
> 
> **Dr. Shaw:** Unfortunately, that doesn't seem possible. However, if you agree to cooperate with us, I can promise that your stay here will be comfortable. 
> 
> **SCP-5028:** Don't really got a choice, do I? Fine, what do you want?
> 
> **Dr. Shaw:** Mostly information on your home-world, your system of magic, and a few tests here and there. 
> 
> **SCP-5028:** Doesn't seem so bad, I guess. Alright, start asking. 
> 
> **Dr. Shaw:** Great! So, what's your home like? Is it populated with more of your kind?
> 
> **SCP-5028:** Not exactly, we're kinda rare. Most people look like you and the other guys here. Y'know, two legged humes. I'm from Empria, but there's a whole butt-ton of other places. Not that I know of any of their names besides Elrich. 
> 
> **Dr. Shaw:** I noticed you have some hostility towards Elrich. What's the reason for that?
> 
> **SCP-5028:** It's because they're taking our land. Hell, they already //took// our land! Can't trust anyone from Elrich! 
> 
> **Dr. Shaw:** Seems like diplomacy between your two countries are tense to say the least. What about your magic? We know you're capable of making explosions, but what else?
> 
> **SCP-5028:** Promise not to laugh.
> 
> **Dr. Shaw:** I assure you, I will not.
> 
> **SCP-5028:** I never bothered to learn any other kind of magic. 
> 
> **Dr. Shaw:** .....Why did you only ever learn explosion magic?
> 
> **SCP-5028:** Because explosions are the [EXPLETIVE] best! C'mon, there's gotta be somebody here who gets it! Speaking of, when are you going to give me my staff back?! I can't cast without it!
> 
> **Dr. Shaw:** It may be returned if we deem that you aren't a security threat. Until then, it'll be in our possession. We don't want you blowing up the facility, after all.
> 
> **SCP-5028:** Yea, guess that makes sense. Sorry about earlier, by the way. One minute I think I'm about to get executed and the next I'm surrounded by humes eating, so I got kind of spooked. Anybody dead?
> 
> **Dr. Shaw:** Fortunately not. I'll pass on your apologies to the other staff. 
> 
> **SCP-5028:** Yea, thanks. What else did ya want to ask? 
> 
> **Dr. Shaw:** Think that should be good for now. I'll speak with the higher-ups about returning your belongings to you.
> 
> **SCP-5028:** Alright. Can I get some berries or fish too while you're at it? The food here taste like garbage, and not the good kind.
> 
> ----
> 
> **Closing Statement:** A proposal has been put forth by Dr. Shaw to re-equip SCP-5028 with it's belongings and test it's abilities in a controlled environment. The proposal has been accepted and a testing session has been scheduled for 01/04/20. SCP-5028's request for food more aligned with it's diet has also been accepted.

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-5028 Test Logs" hide="- Close Addendum"]]

> **Test 5028.1**
> **Target:** One wooden crate
> **Range:** 20 meters
> **Outcome:** SCP-5028 chanted in a unknown language while waving his staff above his head. Within a few moments, a fireball roughly the size of a basketball appeared at the tip of his staff and was sent rapidly hurtling towards the crate. Upon impact, the crate combusted and its pieces consumed in the flames.
> **Note:** That was to be expected. The facilities in the cafeteria sustained heavy damage during our first encounter with him after all.
> ----
> **Test 5028.2**
> **Target:** Ten cinder-blocks
> **Range:** 30 meters
> **Outcome:** SCP-5028 once again chanted in the unknown language, the fireball this time being around twice the size of it's predecessor. Upon impact, all cinderblocks were destroyed. Shrapnel narrowly missed SCP-5028, causing him to subsequently let loose a string of expletives.
> **Note:** New safety measures have been put in place and a larger blast shield has been made for SCP-5028 during testing sessions. 
> ----
> **Test 5028.3**
> **Target:** One decommissioned ████ brand pickup truck
> **Range:** 40 meters
> **Outcome:** SCP-5028's chant was roughly thirty seconds longer than before, the fireball it produced being a blue hue instead of the original coloring. Upon impact, the vehicle immediately combusted and subsequently exploded.
> **Note:** SCP-5028 seemed exceptionally happy about this test, remarking, "Thought I might up the ante a little bit. Impressive, right?" 
> ----
> **Test 5028.4**
> **Target:** Abandoned house
> **Range:** 90 meters
> **Outcome:** SCP-5028 was instructed to use it's strongest spell on the farmhouse. However, it informed Foundation personnel that it's strongest spell would require the range to be increased to up to 100 meters. The chant produced by SCP-5028 lasted eight minutes, a stark contrast to the previous tests, which had chants that lasted roughly two to three minutes. The fireball produced was bright enough to temporarily blinded all personnel within the vicinity. The entirety of the house, down to its basement level, was completely destroyed in the blast. 
> **Note:** A proposal to employ SCP-5028 in MTF Psi-7 "Home Improvement"on a trial run basis is currently pending with the O5 Council. SCP-5028 has already been notified of the proposal and has promised to work diligently alongside Foundation personnel under the condition that any knowledge pertaining to it's reality be relayed back to it. Using the firepower demonstrated by SCP-5028, it is a possibility there will be less casualties in the future when conducting missions regarding detonating anomalous locations.

**Addendum 5028.1:** MTF Psi-7 Trial Run

The proposal for SCP-5028 to participate on a series of missions with MTF Psi-7 was accepted by the 0-5 Council with a 11-2 vote. The first mission SCP-5028 is scheduled to take part in will be on 1-25-20. 

**Addendum 5028.2:** MTF Psi-7 Employment

To date, SCP-5028 has conducted ten missions alongside MTF Psi-7. Not only have casualties on missions including MTF Psi-7 heavily decreased, but performance has increased due to the added firepower of SCP-5028. By order of the O5 Council with a 13-0 vote, SCP-5028 has been made a fully fledged member of MTF Psi-7 and assigned the code-name, "Azeban." With this change in status, SCP-5028 is allowed usage of more Foundation amenities and facilities.
