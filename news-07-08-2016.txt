++++ Event-Featured Articles

+++++ July:

* July 3rd was Last Day of Shark Week! Part man, part fish, all business, the [[[scp-7475-j|Turbo Shark Pulverizer 6000]]] will stop at nothing to punch sharks. Because he can only punch sharks. He's not that impressive otherwise. [[*user Gargus]] brings us this unholy beast. For shark-punching!
* July 29th was International Tiger Day! Don't be fooled; this may just look like an ordinary kitten, but it's actually a vicious tiger. Oh, and it looks hungry. So much for that [[[scp-247|harmless kitten]]] look after all. Thanks, [[*user Alias Pseudonym]], for instilling that seed of doubt in our heads.
* July 30th was International Day of Friendship! Friendships build bridges between people, whether you see their faces often or not often at all. Take a moment to think of your friends, both old and new, and visit [[[SCP-1252]]] (A Half-Formed Idea) by [[*user SoullessSingularity]].

+++++ August:

* August 15th was Happy National Relaxation Day! A chance to take a moment today to breathe deeply, reflect on what makes you happy, and maybe share a cup of tea on a tropical island with [[[SCP-2255]]] ("The Most Interesting Rainstorm in the World") by [[*user Zyn]].
* August 21st was World Fashion Day! Celebrate the art of fashion today! [[[SCP-2353]]] ("The Mannequin That Will No Longer Put Up With This Shit, Honestly") by [[*user SoullessSingularity]] certainly has a few things to say about the topic.
* August 22nd was National Eat a Peach Day! For those of us saying goodbye to those fleeting days of summer, take a moment to appreciate the sunshine. Perhaps have a peach or two... just not one from [[[SCP-891 | this California Field]]], [[*user Chubert]] tells us.

++++ Rest of the News

* Let's give a warm welcome and hearty congratulations to the brand new [http://scp-wiki-de.wikidot.com/ German SCP Wiki]! [[*user Dr_Grom]] and [[*user ThePencilWriter]] have put in a ton of hard work, and it shows! Also check out their [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBkhbPp2tpZDjU9lXjvPUSA official YouTube channel] and [http://scp-wiki-de.wikidot.com/top-rated-pages Top Rated Pages]!
* Check out the results of the [[[2016-survey-results|2016 SCP Community Survey]]]! [[*user LurkD]]'s done a really great job compiling all kinds of statistics on our fair wiki, from the languages people access the site in to all the ways you, the users, think we can improve our community!

Thanks for tuning in again, folks! If you write an article and it sticks, //please// send Decibelle, A Random Day, or rumetzen a blurb for your article. We may or may not use it (if we can think of something more attention-getting, though we can try to stick with one you give us) but we'd really would just like them in order to make the process easier for making these. In addition, this is a community thing, and I want authors to give their blurbs to sell these articles much easier. It reduces the workload I and the people helping me have to do, and helps the news come out that much earlier!

Thank you ARD and rumetzen for helping me out! I did the first half (plus intro + outro + fandom stuff), they did the second half.

Furthermore, I'd still like to know if anyone is interested in an art contest! I did get some good feedback last time, but would like more just to see if it's sustainable and viable. Thank you all for continuing to be an excellent community <3
