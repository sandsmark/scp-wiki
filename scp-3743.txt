**Description**: SCP-3743 is a school located in a small town in Southern Japan. SCP-3743 resembles a typical Japanese school, which has been modified to contain extra wide corridors and doors, a barracks and a shooting range. The sign at the front gates of SCP-3743 reads 'Tank School: A School for Tanks'. Residing within SCP-3743 are 7 tanks of varying makes designated SCP-3743-A to G. 
SCP-3743-A to G appear to go through a typical school day, attending classes, having lunch in the cafeteria, and returning to the barracks at night. The objects are able to maneuver without the need of a driver and are fully capable of human speech, despite lack of an oral cavity and vocal chords needed to do so. The objects are not hostile and enjoy conversing with members of staff and each appear to have their own distinct personalities.
