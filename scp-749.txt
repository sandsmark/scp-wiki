**Item #:** SCP-749

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-749 is to be contained in a sealed Live Containment Vault with a minimum of three armed guards at all times.  The walls of the vault are to be sloped in order to inhibit SCP-749's attempts to crawl up them. All guards posted are to be equipped with chemical dispersal units loaded with insecticides at all times. To feed SCP-749, the fire sprinklers are to be turned on and a mammal of no less than 150 lbs. sent into the room. The sprinklers are to remain on for at least an hour.  Feeding is to take place every five days, and no additional personnel are permitted within the room while feeding takes place. 

**Description:** SCP-749 is an apex predator superficially resembling members of the subphylum //Myriapoda//, approximately eight to nine feet long, with forcipules that secrete a powerful acidic compound with a measured pH of 0.3. SCP-749 demonstrates a predilection for hunting during rainstorms, and appears to be familiar with urban settings. Its preferred hunting methods consist of climbing up the walls of domiciles, using its forcipules to gain entry (usually by boring a hole through a wall or window), then feeding upon sleeping individuals within. SCP-749 appears to avoid detection prior to these attacks due to the unique pattern of walking and form of legs possessed by the creature, causing it to emulate and therefore blend in with the sound of raindrops impacting hard surfaces. Current research is focused on the nature of this aural camouflage and its potential for replication.
