||~ Sex ||~ Height ||~ Weight/Build ||~ Race ||~ Hair ||~ Eyes ||~ Identifying Attributes ||
|| Male || 67 in. || 153 lbs, medium || White || Brown || Grey || Dresses well. ||

**Capabilities:** The suspect is a younger white man capable of affecting situations to produce a favorable outcome for said suspect. It appears that this ability is unconsciously triggered, as he has not displayed any voluntary capability to use this irregular characteristic, and in fact has been unable to use his ability at certain points when he attempted to do so forcefully.

**Purpose/Motive:** Suspect primarily uses his ability for the purpose of wealth and fame. Notably, the suspect organizes large scale bank robberies in order to accrue wealth, doing so in a manner that has led to widespread admiration and interest from the general public.

**Modus Operandi:** Dillinger generally operates with a set of close individuals in a gang to organize bank robberies, as well as relying on his paranormal luck to successfully 

**Behavior:** Suspect is noted to be extremely charming and intelligent. Dillinger is well-read, and is also noted to possess an extremely low respect for authority and danger, going so far as openly talking to police officers, and asking them for help solving minor crimes. This is believed to be a result of Dillinger’s irregular ability, which has made him somewhat arrogant. Agents looking to apprehend Dillinger should capitalize on this arrogance.

**Wooden gun:** Dillinger allegedly used a wooden carving of a gun to escape Crown Point prison on March 3, 1934. In the process, Dillinger managed to capture and hold captive 20 assorted guards, prison personnel, and police officers, in a clear manifestation of his paranormal powers.

**History of UIU Action:**

10/12/33: Initial registration of Dillinger as an irregular suspect. While normal processing for Dillinger as a regular suspect occurred, Dillinger managed to distract guards for a period of 2 hours while fellow gang members smuggled guns and other equipment into Lima County Prison. A UIU agent attached to the local police force noted the extreme irregularity of Dillinger’s luck, and began a casefile on the suspect. UIU resources for investigation were approved 4 days later.

11/20/33: While responding to the robbery of the American Bank and Trust Co, Racine, Wisconson, 3 UIU agents opened fire on Dillinger and his gang. Despite firing over 50 shots, not a single one of the robbers was seen to take an injury. When later tested on their shooting skills, all 3 agents scored very highly on the standard UIU marksmanship test.

1/15/34: During the suspect’s robbery of the First National Bank, East Chicago, Indiana, 4 UIU agents responded to the robbery in progress. Of note is that no agents seemed to notice the seemingly obvious escape vehicle that the gang used, which was conspicuously parked on the wrong side of the road, and featured a known Dillinger gang member at the wheel. During the ensuing firefight when Dillinger and his gang escaped with hostages, one agent was killed. Of particular note is that none of the suspects were shot until Dillinger himself proclaimed that he would, “get that son of a bitch,” referring to the one agent that was shortly thereafter killed by Dillinger. However, after this point, Dillinger himself was shot in the hand, and forced to drop his weapon before escaping.

3/3/34: Following an arrest by regular police personnel, the suspect was escorted to Crown Point Prison in Lake County, Indiana. Although the events of the day are not entirely clear due to the delay in transferring appropriate UIU personnel to the prison, what is known is that Dillinger managed to fashion a facsimile of a gun using a wooden shelf, and escape the jail (well known for its rigorous monitoring of prisoners) while taking 20 hostages in the process.

5/8/34: While in his habit of approaching and talking to police officers, Dillinger chanced upon a UIU agent, and began to boast of his supposed “infallible luck.” The suspect attempted to predict the outcome of a coin toss several times, but failed to do so beyond what would be expected from unaltered probability. It was of particular note that the suspect appeared quite frustrated when unable to accurately predict the outcome of the coin toss.

[[collapsible show="Update: 6/23/34" hide="Suspect confirmed: Deceased:"]]

Yesterday, on 6/22/34, Dillinger was tracked by UIU agents to a movie showing at the Biograph Theater, Chicago, Illinois. When Dillinger exited the theater, he noted the presence of the UIU agents despite attempts at camouflage from the agents. Following confirmation of a “shoot-first” policy from Director J. Edgar Hoover, agents moved to surround Dillinger while the suspect himself fled his companions at the movie theater, and went into a closed-off alleyway.

While agents closed in on Dillinger’s position, he declared that he was “the luckiest man in the world,” and drew his gun, defying an order to surrender. Three agents immediately opened fire and killed the suspect immediately.
