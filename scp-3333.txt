**Item #:** SCP-3333

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The trapdoor leading to SCP-3333 is to remain shut and locked at all times. At least one operative is to remain posted under SCP-3333 at all times to prevent entry or exit. The door to SCP-3333 is to be examined for signs of damage daily.

MTF Lambda-1 ("Maxwell's Demons") has been created and deployed to assist in the containment of SCP-3333.

//Containment procedures revised 2039/04/02.//

**Description:** SCP-3333 is a spatial anomaly located within the Fremont fire lookout, located in Mt. Ranier National Park, Washington State, United States of America.

SCP-3333 is accessible via a ladder and trapdoor on the ceiling of the Fremont lookout. Climbing the ladder leads to an identical copy of the Fremont fire lookout, including the walkway and railing that surrounds the back half of the lookout. This identical copy has an identical ladder and trapdoor pair, which leads to further copies of the Fremont lookout.

The topology surrounding SCP-3333 is identical to that surrounding the Fremont lookout. However, no plant, animal, or human life has been observed.

Successive SCP-3333 iterations are higher relative to the original lookout. The stairs leading up to the walkway on these SCP-3333 iterations are extended by a proportional amount to allow access to the ground.

SCP-3333 was first discovered after restoration of the Fremont lookout following volcanic activity near Mount Rainier. SCP-3333's origins are not known: no members of the parks service involved in the restoration of the lookout were responsible for construction of the entrance to SCP-3333.

At the time of discovery, the trapdoor to SCP-3333 was padlocked. In order to access SCP-3333, the trapdoor was forced open. No key has been found.

**Mission Parameters:** Initial reconnaissance of SCP-3333.

**Personnel:** D-4f68a

**Additional Information:** D-4f68a was equipped with standard-issue audiovisual exploration recorders. The exploration was supervised by Doctor Williams and a support team located in a temporary observation outpost inside the Fremont fire lookout.

[LOG BEGINS]

**Doctor Williams:** Test, test. Can you hear me?

**D-4f68a:** Yes? Hello? [Brief pause] Doctor?

**Williams:** Excellent. Please proceed into SCP-3333.

//There is a brief moment of audio feedback due to the proximity between Dr. Williams and D-4f68a. D-4f68a climbs up the ladder into SCP-3333.//

**Williams:** Please report what you see.

**D-4f68a:** It's—well—I just came from here, but—but wait, it's empty, and how did it—

**Williams:** Excellent. Thank you. [Brief pause] Please stop talking.

//Pause//

**Williams:** Thank you. Please continue climbing.

//D-4f68a ascends SCP-3333 for approximately an hour.//

**Williams:** Alright, I want to test something. D-4f68a, if you don't mind, could you try opening the door and going outside?

**D-4f68a:** Ok, Doctor.

//D-4f68a opens the door. Strong wind immediately blasts into the room, throwing D-4f68a back against the far wall and moving the furniture. D-4f68a struggles to get across the room, and eventually manages to close the door. He reflexively pulls his hand away from the door handle.//

**D-4f68a:** [Out of breath] Oh my //god//, what was that? Why was it so hot? 

**Williams:** [Coughs] It is probably best if you stay inside for now.

**D-4f68a:** I—I see. Yeah, ok.

//D-4f68a continues to ascend SCP-3333. Wind is audible. There is no change in the interior of SCP-3333. D-4f68a continues for approximately three hours. D-4f68a takes a simple multiplication-based cognition test every ten iterations of SCP-3333. No change from baseline detected.//

//Several hours later, D-4f68a rests and eats some rations. During this time, analysis of video footage shows D-4f68a has climbed through 184 instances of SCP-3333.//

**D-4f68a:** Doctor Williams, look. Do you see this?

**Williams:** What is it?

**D-4f68a:** Looks like- well, it looks like animal fur. It's longer, though, but rough. Sort of abrasive. This stuff is white and, uh- white and orange. There's not a lot, just a few little clumps over here. [Pauses] Jesus, how did any animal get all the way up here?

**Williams:** That's a great question. [Pauses] Now seems as good a time as any. I'd like you to take that test again, D-4f68a.

**D-4f68a:** Alright, Doctor.

//D-4f68a self-administers the cognition test. No change from baseline detected. D-4f68a has climbed through 184 iterations of SCP-3333, corresponding to approximately 673 meters of vertical gain. While some subtle elevation difference is observable, it is far less than expected.//

**D-4f68a:** Doctor?

**Williams:** Yes?

**D-4f68a:** ...what is this for?

**Williams:** The test? [Pause] Well, I guess it can't hurt. It's to test—it's to test how thin the air is.

**D-4f68a:** How?

**Williams:** As the air gets thinner, your—[sigh]—well, your brain slows down, basically.

**D-4f68a:** Uh- ok. Is- this going to hurt me?

**Williams:** No, no. The test results are the same as they were down here. You're not going up as much as you should.

**D-4f68a:** Oh. Thanks, Doctor.

**Williams:** No problem. [Pause, cough] Please continue climbing, D-4f68a.

//D-4f68a continues climbing for four more hours. The sun sets, and D-4f68a makes camp and sleeps.//

//The following morning, D-4f68a continues ascending SCP-3333.//

**D-4f68a:** Doctor! Do—do you see that?

**Williams:** What?

**D-4f68a:** Over there—on that peak—are there people up there?

//On a ridge southwest of SCP-3333, two small, vaguely humanoid figures can be seen. They are standing motionless. These figures can only be seen from D-4f68a's perspective; they are not visible from base camp.//

**D-4f68a:** Are there any binoculars in here? I need to see—

**Williams:** Give us a good look with the camera too—we need to zoom in—

**D-4f68a:** I found it!

//D-4f68a looks through the binoculars at the figures. Base camp attempts to zoom in on the figures with D-4f68a's camera; however, the resolution is too low, and nothing can be made out.//

**D-4f68a:** I can't see them—they're just out of focus—oh god!

//The figures turn around and go behind the ridge. They appear to have more limbs than a human.//

**D-4f68a:** They saw the reflection of the binoculars.

**Williams:** Are you sure?

**D-4f68a:** They—they looked right at me. [Pause] I think one of them pointed.

**Williams:** I see.

**D-4f68a:** What were they looking for? I couldn't see that- [Pauses] Hey. More of that animal fur here, on the window sill. [Pauses] That's really weird. [Shivers]

**Williams:** Are you alright, D-4f68a?

**D-4f68a:** Yeah, just got a chill all of a sudden.

//D-4f68a is instructed to continue climbing SCP-3333. Deliberations are held at base camp about the figures and the fur. No consensus is reached.//

//D-4f68a continues climbing to the 345th iteration of SCP-3333. No other figures are spotted. D-4f68a camps until morning.//

//The next day, D-4f68a forgets to turn his camera and microphone on until reminded. Shortly afterwards, D-4f68a expresses feelings of anxiety and unease.//

**D-4f68a:** You've gotta let me come down, Doc. Somethin's not right here.

**Williams:** Something concrete?

**D-4f68a:** I don't know! But—but something's not right. All this writing on the walls, and—

**Williams:** There is no writing on the walls.

**D-4f68a:** Well, I see somethin' Doc. I don't know what it says, but it's there, there for sure. I think- [Breathing deeply] -I think there's something in here within me.

**Williams:** I see. We have no reason to believe that, D-4f68a. You've made it this far. Please keep going.

//D-4f68a continues ascending SCP-3333, occasionally requesting to be allowed to return to base. All requests are denied. Video footage is analyzed for writing or memetic agents; none are found.//

//On the 527th level, the topology of SCP-3333 drastically changes. Multiple copies of the Fremont fire lookout are connected to each other in a grid pattern, accessible through the lookout doorway. There is no natural light, and no sign of sky or ground. It is completely dark. No lookout has a trapdoor or ladder.//

**D-4f68a:** This—this isn't right, Doc! You've gotta let me down! I can't see!

**Williams:** Calm down, //please.// You have an emergency head lamp and flashlight in your backpack. Please use them.

//D-4f68a attempts to switch on the lights. They do not turn on. D-4f68a is instructed to check the battery compartments; they are empty. D-4f68a is instructed to use the backup batteries in the backpack. D-4f68a is unable to locate them.//

**D-4f68a:** There's nothing in here! Nothing's right! Let me down, please!

**Williams:** No! Please proceed!

**D-4f68a:** Wait—I think—I see somethin'! I see somethin', Doc!

**Williams:** What? What is it?

//Nothing is visible on D-4f68a's camera. A faint rustling sound is picked up on the microphone, but neither Dr. Williams or the subject notice this.//

**D-4f68a:** I—I don't know! It's not right!

//D-4f68a begins to panic.//

**D-4f68a:** Let me come down, Doc! I've got to get out of here!

**Williams:** We absolutely cannot allow that. What is it you see?

//There is a faint chattering sound, and then D-4f68a's camera and microphone cut out simultaneously.//

**Williams:** What? D-4f68a? D-4f68a! What just happened? Did he turn his recorders off? What happened?

[END LOG]

-----

//Analysis of D-4f68a's video footage is unable to reveal cause of communication blackout. Equipment error is ruled unlikely. Due to the circumstances surrounding D-4f68a's disappearance, and the possibility of an unknown anomalous object or entity in the upper portion of SCP-3333, another expedition is proposed and approved.//

**Mission Parameters:** Determine the reason behind the disappearance of D-4f68a, locate any anomalous objects located by D-4f68a, and identify any anomalous entities present within SCP-3333.

**Personnel:** MTF Mod-0 ("Characteristic Eigenspaces")

**Additional Information:** All members of MTF Mod-0 were equipped with standard-issue survival gear and recording equipment. No special items were deemed necessary. All batteries and backups were triple-checked. Doctor Williams supervised from base camp.

[LOG BEGIN]

**Mod-1:** Mod-1, check.

**Mod-2:** Mod-2, check.

**Mod-3:** Mod-3, check.

**Mod-4:** Mod-4, check.

**Mod-5:** Mod-5, check.

**Mod-1:** Ok, everyone. Standard-issue tower approach. Two ahead, one in the middle, two behind. Let's go.

//All team members begin to ascend SCP-3333. No figures are visible on nearby ridges. The sky is overcast, and the wind is audible. As the MTF climbs, the wind dies down.//

//After several hours of climbing, Mod-4 and Mod-2 encounter the room where D-4f68a attempted to exit SCP-3333. The furniture is still in a state of disarray, and nothing appears to have been moved.//

**Mod-1:** Here seems as good a place as any.

//The members of Mod-0 gather and attempt to mount an expedition outside of SCP-3333. Mod-2 is attached to a rope and exits SCP-3333. There is no strong wind, and Mod-2 is easily able to leave.//

**Mod-2:** There's nothing here. Doctor?

**Williams:** That's strange. I suppose it died down. Keep explor-

**Mod-2:** Hang on. [Pauses] Gouges on the wall here, by the door. Scratch marks. They're not very big, but- [Inspects more closely] -Jesus, they're pretty deep.

**Williams:** Copy that. Keep exploring.

**Mod-1:** Roger.

//The members of the MTF exit SCP-3333 and begin to explore. The topology around SCP-3333 is identical to that surrounding the Fremont lookout. No plant or animal life is visible. No humanoids can be seen. The members of the MTF explore for several hours, then reconvene at SCP-3333.//

**Mod-3:** There's nothing here.

**Mod-4:** No plant life, though. That's strange. 

**Williams:** If this pattern holds across the world here, that could account for the stronger wind patterns. Not sure where the oxygen would come from, though. 

**Mod-5:** You know what's weird, now that I'm thinking about it? Do you smell that?

**Williams:** What do you mean?

**Mod-5:** There's this real faint smell, like hot metal or- or burning hair, or something. Anyone else smell that?

**Mod-3:** [Pauses] Yeah. That's really bizarre. It's just barely there. [Walks around] I don't know where it's coming from.

**Williams:** Yes, that is strange. [Pauses] Let's move on. 

**Mod-1:** Roger.

//The MTF ascends for several more hours and camps for the night. Their pace is slower than that of D-4f68a; they ascend SCP-3333 for several more days with no notable encounters. No auditory or visual hallucinations are noted. On the fourth day, they arrive at the apex of SCP-3333.//

**Mod-1:** Flashlights out, everyone.

//Members of the MTF equip their lanterns and flashlights. All are fully equipped with batteries, and backup batteries are double-checked. Apart from that made by the MTF, there is no sound and no light.//

**Mod-1:** Alright. Two one two again. Arbitrary direction...oh, let's go that way.

//Mod-1 points at a random direction, and the MTF proceeds in that direction. Reflector markers are left for navigation.//

//The SCP-3333 iterations are connected horizontally, through their external walkway. There is no stairway down, and the railings have been removed such that the walkways can be pressed up and joined with each other. There is no sign of seam between the walkways, and no trace of manmade workmanship.//

//Mod-2 pulls up a board at random from the walkway. There is nothing but blackness below. Mod-2 drops a glowstick into the hole; no bottom is visible. Mod-3 fires a signal flare into the air; no ceiling is visible. No sound or light appears.//

**Williams:** Do you notice anything strange?

**Mod-4:** Such as?

**Williams:** Any of the hallucinations reported by D-4f68a; anything that could indicate what he was talking about near the end.

**Mod-1:** No. No sign of the body or equipment either. Do you want us to prioritize that?

**Williams:** I think it would be somewhat helpful if you could. There doesn't appear to be a pattern or purpose to these rooms, anyways.

**Mod-1:** Roger.

//The MTF splits up and begins a radial search pattern from the origin. This continues for approximately an hour. Intermittently a light, echoing chattering sound is picked up by all four microphones, but none of the task force members seem to hear it.//

**Mod-3:** I found something!

**Mod-4:** What?

**Mod-2:** What is it?

**Mod-1:** Coming.

//Members of the MTF gather. En route, Mod-5's flashlight cuts out.//

**Williams:** What is it?

**Mod-3:** It's his backpack. Completely empty. It hasn't been torn or anything though, just sort of... singed? It's hot.

**Mod-4:** No sign of a struggle. [Inspects more closely] There's hair all over this thing. Orange and-

**Mod-2:** Was it propped up against the table when you got here?

**Mod-3:** Yes. I haven't touched it.

**Mod-1:** Good; let's not. [Pause] Where's Graham? [Pause] Graham? Everyone, check in!

**Mod-2:** Mod-2.

**Mod-3:** Mod-3.

**Mod-4:** Mod-4.

**Mod-1:** We're missing Graham. Do you have a feed on his camera, Doctor?

**Williams:** N-no. His flashlight's out. I can't see anything. [Hesitates] Do you hear that?

**Mod-1:** Hear what? 

**Williams:** Your mics are picking up a sound. [Pauses] I can barely make it out.

**Mod-1:** Roger. Two by two. I'll go with Horace. Radial pattern out from here.

**Mod-2:** Right.

**Mod-3:** Okay.

**Mod-4:** Yes.

//Mod-1 and Mod-3 pair up. Mod-2 and Mod-4 pair up. They begin a radial search pattern. There is still no sound. Doctor Williams plays back Mod-5's camera footage prior to loss of communication; there is no sign of distress. The camera is transmitting, but is completely black.//

//Mod-2 and Mod-4 fall over. There are two loud sounds, presumably their bodies hitting the floor. A faint crackling sound can be heard, as well as the aforementioned chattering. Microphones and cameras on both cut out near-simultaneously. Mod-5's camera and microphone shut off.//

**Williams:** Hello? Hello! We've lost feed on Mod-2 and Mod-4!

//There is another thud. Mod-3's microphone and camera cut out.//

**Williams:** Hello? Mod-1?

**Mod-1:** What—what just happened—

**Williams:** I don't—where's Mod-3?

**Mod-1:** I turned away for a second, and now there's—he's—

//Mod-1's headlamp rapidly scans the surrounding area. No sign of the rest of Mod-0 can be found.//

**Mod-1:** [Into the darkness] Hello? [Pause] [Whispering] I—I think there's something in here—with me—

**Williams:** What? What is it? Do you see words?

**Mod-1:** No, I don't see anything—

//All four cameras and microphones reactivate. This is not simultaneous; it is consistent with the equipment manually being activated.//

**Mod-5:** Hello? Hello?

**Williams:** The equipment's on—what the hell happened?

**Mod-3:** I dunno, Doc. There was something on the ground, and I tripped, and—

**Mod-1:** Where are all of you? Check in!

**Mod-2:** Mod-3.

**Mod-3:** Mod-5.

**Mod-4:** Mod-2.

**Mod-5:** Mod-4.

**Mod-1:** Th—

//Mod-1's microphone and camera suddenly cut out. A light rustling sound is audible over the other microphones. A similar light crackling sound is heard shortly afterwards.//

**Mod-2:** Mod-1? Hello?

//Mod-1's camera and microphone reactivate.//

**Mod-1:** I—I saw it too—

**Mod-3:** Yes—

**Williams:** What? Saw what?

**Mod-4:** I don't know—it's spectral, like floaters—lights in the sky— 

**Mod-5:** Something here isn't right.

**Mod-2:** No. We need—

**Mod-4:** It isn't safe here—

**Williams:** What are you talking about?

//Nothing besides the Fremont fire lookout is visible on any camera.//

**Williams:** Is there anything with you?

**Mod-1:** N-no—it's not that, Doc—

**Mod-4:** There! Do you see it, Doc?

//Nothing is visible.//

**Williams:** No! What is it?

**Mod-3:** W-we're not safe here.

**Mod-2:** Something's not right.

**Mod-1:** [Breathing rapidly] It's—it's there!

**Williams:** What //is// it?

**Mod-1:** It's—it looks like a—

[Pause]

//Nothing is visible through any MTF feeds.//

**Mod-1:** It's like—uh—

**Mod-3:** It looks like a castle—or no! A mountain!

**Mod-4:** A mountain! A ghostly mountain! But—but it isn't—

**Mod-5:** It's—a flaming mountain, conjured of smoke and air. A tower of smoke and ash—

**Mod-3:** I see it! There's flames everywhere! There's something in the fire!

**Mod-1:** I see it too! Everything is on fire! I'm burning! Oh God, oh God! I'm burning!

**Mod-5:** We need to go! Retreat, everyone!

**__0__:** LEAVING BASE NOW

**Williams:** Let us know if you need anything.

**__0__:** YES

//Specialist __0__ begins to ascend SCP-3333.//

**Mod-5:** [To Williams] I don't like this—

**Williams:** If it was frightening enough to make your //crack// team turn tail and flee, it is certainly worth calling in Annette.

//Mod-5 does not respond. Specialist __0__ continues to ascend.//

**__0__:** ROOM DIFF. MESSY. FIGHT?

**Williams:** No, that was us.

**__0__:** OK. [Pause] SOMETHING MOVING. SMALL. HOT. [Pause] GONE NOW. 

//A few hours pass.//

**__0__:** SOMEONE OUTSIDE. WATCHING.

**Williams:** They were encountered earlier. If you keep going up—

**__0__:** AM. STILL FOLLOWING. WAS WRONG. NOT WATCHING. SOMETHING ELSE.

**Williams:** What do you mean?

**__0__:** DON'T KNOW.

//Specialist __0__ continues climbing for several more hours. At this point, Specialist __0__ has been climbing for over 12 hours.//

**Williams:** Don't you need to rest?

**__0__:** SOMETHING STILL THERE. NOT SAFE. WILL USE AMPH.

//Specialist __0__ consumes 100 milligrams of amphetamine and continues to ascend.//

**__0__:** OUTSIDE. CAN YOU SEE?

**Williams:** No, I can't—

//There is a flicker of motion on the edge of the camera. Something looking through the windows ducks down as soon as the camera is turned in its direction. The wind is strong; there is no chance of going outside. The same light chattering sound from previous explorations is heard inside the room.//

**Williams:** There's—

**__0__:** IT KNOWS.

//Specialist __0__ begins to rapidly climb upwards. Flickers of motion are occasionally visible outside SCP-3333. Small rustling sounds can occasionally be heard over the wind. High pitched laughter is distinctly audible on Specialist __0__'s microphone.//

**Mod-5:** Retreat, specialist!

**__0__:** NO

//Specialist __0__ continues rapidly climbing. After approximately an hour, they arrive at the apex of SCP-3333.//

**__0__:** BLOOD. NO LIGHT. HOT.

//Specialist __0__ starts walking. They do not turn their flashlight on. Nothing is visible on the camera; only Specialist __0__'s footsteps are audible on the microphone. A loud slam is audible in the distance.//

**__0__:** HERE.

[Pause]

**__0__:** NO HAZARDS?

//Specialist __0__ begins walking faster, then stops suddenly. Several small rustlings and chatterings can be heard; they quickly cease.//

**__0__:** BODY.

//There is a sound of shifting clothing as Specialist __0__ bends down. The sounds can be heard again, louder and closer.//

**Mod-5:** Get out of there, Specialist!

**Williams:** Annette!

//Several crackling sounds can be heard. An animalistic bark is heard. Something laughs.//

**__0__:** BODY. BLOOD. [Pause] INTERNAL ORGANS. MUSCLES. HARD. BURNED. [PAUSE] FUR. HAIR. 

//The rustlings grow in size, getting closer and closer. They surround Specialist __0__ and overlap, turning into one continuous drone.//

**Mod-5:** Get out, Specialist! Leave it! Go!

**__0__:** METAL. WORDS. HOT.

**Williams:** ANNETTE!

**__0__:** THERE IS A DEMON ON THE MOUNTAIN. I NEED TO COME DOWN. WHERE IS THE LIGHT?

**Williams:** Annette...

//Specialist __0__'s flashlight turns on. Specialist __0__ is laying on the ground. The light illuminates a smoldering pile of burned muscles, organs, and bones nearby. A warped metal dog tag is visible clutched in Specialist __0__'s hand. It reads "MTF Mod-5: Graham Purcell."//

[[tab MESSAGE RECEIVED 2039/04/02]]
**Addendum 4.I:**
Following the events of Exploration III, the entities inside SCP-3333 (hereafter designated SCP-3333-1) killed or impersonated all members present at Temporary Observation Post 3333. No distress signal was sent, and Exploration III was not forwarded before its conclusion. SCP-3333-1 entities maintained the facade of observation and exploration of SCP-3333, and continually requested manpower and equipment for a period of over one month. The ruse was only discovered when a supply assistant managed to send an emergency message before being killed or impersonated. Recontainment teams arriving at SCP-3333 found it completely abandoned. Over 50 personnel were lost.

The single-purpose task force Lambda-1 ("Maxwell's Demons") has been created for the purpose of neutralizing any SCP-3333-1 instances that emerge from within SCP-3333. These instances often mimic the appearance of lost personnel and are considered extremely dangerous.

**Addendum 4.II:**

[LOG BEGIN]

//The footage begins, slightly after the end of Exploration III. Doctor Williams is climbing upwards through SCP-3333, camera attached to her side. She is breathing heavily, and appears to be running from something. Gunshots can be heard down below. A constant chattering sound is audible around her.//

//Doctor Williams climbs upwards for approximately ten minutes, then stops to rest. She sets the camera up against a table and blocks off the lower trapdoor with a chair. She sits down.//

//She is covered in ash and blood, is visibly panicked, and is carrying a handgun. Pieces of white animal fur are matted in the blood on her arms and face. She looks at the camera, begins to speak, then starts crying. She continues crying for approximately a minute, then stops.//

**Williams:** It got us. It was wonderfully done. Just the right amount of vagueness, and who would dare argue with a seasoned MTF deciding to turn tail and run? And of course I didn't know any of them closely, so who was I to say if there was anything wrong, but then their skin...

//There is a rattling sound. Someone is attempting to get through the trapdoor. Williams grabs the gun and points it at the door.//

**Voice:** Doctor Williams? Doctor Williams! This is MTF Alpha-3! We received a distress call from this outpost! We were attacked by the personnel assigned here! What's going on here, Doctor? [Pounding] Let us in, Doctor!

**Williams:** [Panicked] St— [Coughs] Stay back! I—I'm not falling for it!

**Alpha-3:** Doctor Williams! Please! We will treat you as an enemy agent if you do not let us in!

**Williams:** [Screaming] Stay back!

//Several fingers emerge through the trapdoor and begin to lift it up. Williams runs over and stamps on the fingers. There is a crunching sound, and the fingers go completely flat, still trapped in the door. There is a crackling sound as they begin to disintegrate, as if they are composed of cinders. The edges of the fingers burn slightly and smoke for a moment before going out. Williams fires two shots through the top of the door, grabs the camera, and begins climbing again.//

//Doctor Williams climbs for approximately a minute and a half, blocking off more trapdoors as she goes, then stops to vomit and cry for about ten minutes.//

//Following this, Williams continues to climb nonstop for over twelve hours before collapsing. She remains unconscious for around two hours, then wakes up screaming.//

**Williams:** [Screaming subsides] I—am still here. [Pause] I'm thirsty. [Pause] I wish I had grabbed a kit. God it's fucking hot.

//It begins to rain outside SCP-3333. Williams starts laughing.//

**Williams:** I bet you love that, you bastard. Bet you love the rain. Came a little late, huh?

//Williams props up the camera, then goes outside and attempts to drink. After a short period of time, she spits and comes back inside.//

**Williams:** Same ashy shit as earlier.

//Williams continues to climb for an hour. As she climbs, she comes across the corpse of an unrecognizable entity. It is vaguely insect-like, with large black tattered wings and a barbed stinger protruding from somewhere in the center of its mass. The entity is unmoving, and is thoroughly burned. Williams touches it with her shoe, and the creature collapses into cinders. Williams watches the entity for a moment more, and then continues climbing.//

//Another hour later, there is a knock on the door of SCP-3333.//

//Williams immediately stops and pulls out her gun. She is breathing heavily, and her hands are shaking.//

//There is another knock, this time on the other side of SCP-3333.//

//Williams turns around. D-4f68a is standing at the door. He is extremely emaciated, and is leaning against the door. His skin is dry, cracked and burned. Falling off in places, and heavily charred. He attempts to open the door. There is a simple knob lock on the door; he cannot open it.//

**D-4f68a:** [Rasping] Let me in, Doc!

//The chattering sound can be heard again.//

**Williams:** Get back!

//Williams backs away from the door and points her gun at D-4f68a. He continues rattling at the door.//

**D-4f68a:** Please Doc, let me in! There's no water out here!

**Williams:** It's not—you're not—he never called me Doc! Not once!

//There is silence.//

//D-4f68a's face goes completely slack.//

**D-4f68a:** There's a voice calling—from the fire. Can't you— [Pauses and coughs, as embers are expelled from its throat]

//D-4f68a breaks one of the door's panes with his fist. There is no blood, but the edges of his hand begin to smoke. He reaches in and turns the knob. Williams begins firing. D-4f68a opens the door and begins running at Doctor Williams. Williams fires at D-4f68a five times. One bullet strikes him in the shoulder, and embers can be seen through the open wound. Smoke begins to roll out of his eyes as D-4f68a approached Doctor Williams, who fires again, striking D-4f68a in the chest. He stumbles, coughing violently as embers are expelled from his mouth. He collapses to the ground, still moving towards Doctor Williams as more of his skin flakes off, revealing charred flesh and ash underneath. He comes within a few paces of Doctor Williams, who lifts her foot and stamps it into D-4f68a's face, which collapses with a distinct crack and an expulsion of embers and soot. Orange and white animal hair can be seen inside the collapsed skull of the entity on the ground.//

**Williams:** It—it's— [Pause]

//Doctor Williams attempts to throw up again. However, she is only able to retch for several seconds.//

**Williams:** [Rapidly and quietly] There is a fetish among humans at the deepest level about enlightenment and height, about ignorance and depth. Here we are, on a castle in the sky, on a mountain in the air; the God Pillar, a recursive stack, and here at the top we find nothing, a dead world, an unfulfilled promise... but we didn't find it first. Something was here. Something got in- [Pause] I just want—I want to go home...

//Williams proceeds to climb for several minutes, blocking each trapdoor as she goes. She stops for a moment. She begins to laugh.//

**Williams:** I finally did it though, Annette! I'm here...Annette...

//Williams begins to cry.//

//Several minutes later, Williams composes herself and resumes climbing. Approximately half an hour later, she arrives at the apex of SCP-3333.//

//Doctor Williams turns on the flashlight. It illuminates the Fremont fire lookout; nothing else is visible. There is no sound or external light.//

**Williams:** Hello? [Pause] [Shouting] HELLO?

//A pause. Williams voice does not echo. There is no reply.//

**Williams:** There's nothing up here. There never was. Floating words, a ghostly mountain...pah. [Pause] I had still hoped, though. I think.

//Williams walks around SCP-3333's apex for a few minutes.//

**Williams:** There's just nothing here. Nothing at all.

//Doctor Williams sits down and props up the camera on a table.//

**Williams:** I wish I could drink. It's so goddamn hot.

//The pattering of small footsteps can be heard in the distance.//

**Williams:** [Whispered] Oh //shit...//

//The footsteps get closer. They are light, and accompanied by an indistinct chattering mixed with high pitched laughter. Occasionally they stop, and there is a wet thunk as the person hits furniture or a wall.//

**Williams:** [Quietly] No, no...

//The body of Specialist __0__ floats into view. The flesh is blackened and charred, with the light of embers burning under the skin illuminating the area around them. The body shakes slightly, and then opens its eyes. Behind the carbonized eyelids is fire, and when the body opens its mouth only smoke and coals fall out. It reaches to clutch its throat, gasping for air, before falling out of the air. As it hits the ground, its legs disintegrate into a cloud of ash. The body rolls over and faces Doctor Williams. Animal hair is flung from the interior of Specialist __0__'s body.//

**Williams:** [Screaming] ANNETTE!

//The entity on the ground begins dragging itself towards Doctor Williams. The chattering and laughter increases. Doctor Williams is seen wiping sweat off of her brow as the temperature within SCP-3333 grows considerably hotter. She pulls out her weapon and points it at the entity on the ground, which retches fire and smoke. Something indistinct moves quickly in the darkness behind it. The ground beneath the entity begins to smoke and catch fire, and suddenly the floor around them is burning.//

**Williams:** [Screaming] **//ANNETTE//**!

//Williams begins sobbing. The entity in front of her raises into the air as if suspended from behind, pieces of its skin and meat dripping onto the ground like melted wax. One hand moves erratically, as if signing something, but the exact movements cannot be made out. Williams pulls the trigger on her firearm, which clicks. The weapon is empty. Williams still attempts to shoot. The gun clicks. Williams continues sobbing. The gun continues to click. Williams drops to her knees and drops the gun. The entity gets closer. Something behind it moves closer to the scene, barely illuminated now by the fire around them. The entity floating in front of her opens its mouth again, and a groaning, wretched scream fills the air around them.//

**Williams:** [Weeping] I'm sorry.

//The chattering stops suddenly, and the body of Specialist __0__ collapses onto the ground in front of her, throwing out embers and smoke as it dissolves into dust. Williams collapses over it, weeping, her hands digging frantically in the pile of embers. She slams her fists into it, throwing ash into the air.//

//Something appears from out of the darkness in front of her. It is charred, misshapen, and badly burned, but is very clearly the corpse of a fox. The creature stumbles towards her, hobbling on blackened limbs. It does not appear to have eyes, instead only exposed, burned out holes sit where its eyes should. The creature stops right in front of Williams, unmoving. Multiple tails protrude from the back of the corpse, each of them unusually long and disappearing into the darkness beyond. The creature opens its mouth, and chattering fills the room. The sound of high pitched laughter accompanies it.//

//Williams screams, and reaches out to strike the creature. Her hand passes through it, and the creature dissipates as if made of smoke. The chattering stops for a moment, and Williams looks around frantically. Suddenly, the creature re-materializes, hovering now several feet in the air. Pieces of its body drop onto the ground, which catches fire. It twists its head sideways and opens its mouth. The chattering resumes. Williams screams. The creature cackles.//

//The interior of SCP-3333 begins to change drastically. Fire spreads across the ground, which becomes charred earth, and burned out trees appear in the distance. Williams is standing on top of the Fremont fire lookout, and all around her is burning forest. Smoke obscures the camera, and Williams picks it up and brushes ash off the lens. On the ridge below, two vaguely humanoid figures can be seen momentarily, both of them pointing to a location somewhere behind the fire lookout. Williams tries to scream, but chokes on the smoke and collapses. She turns towards the direction the figures are pointing and gasps.//

//In the distance is a mountain made of smoke and fire that stretches into the dark cloud of soot above. The forest around it burns. The skies above are choked with dust and ash. Williams crawls forwards towards a railing. She coughs and drops the camera, which settles on the ground behind her. Williams comes back into frame, desperately holding onto the railing as strong winds and embers rip around her.//
[[include component:image-block name=fire.jpg|caption=Image received from Dr. Williams' mobile phone.]]
//Something comes into view. A massive, blackened, skeletal fox, its skin blistered and barely clinging to its scorched bones, appears above the mountain. It is enormous, completely filling the background of the frame and eclipsing the top of the mountain, and its six dark eyes are seemingly filled with fire. It has six legs, and it crosses over the mountain as if it were a minor impediment. Behind it, nine immeasurably long, flaming tails whip violently across the sky, sending fire cascading down onto the mountainside like rain. The creature opens its mouth, and a cacophonous chattering fills the air. Williams screams.//

//The fox takes another step forward, then stops to look towards the Fremont fire lookout, as if noticing it for the first time. Laughter mixes with the chattering, and the next step is towards the fire lookout. Williams holds tightly to the railing, which glows bright red and blisters her skin as the creature approaches. The ground beneath them begins to flake away from the heat. The image becomes distorted as the lens begins to melt. Williams is seen holding one charred hand up as if to cover her eyes while the creature takes another step towards her. It opens its mouth again, and Williams bursts into flame and ash.// 

//A frame later, the camera is destroyed.//
