**Item #:** SCP-1691

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1691 is installed in 5 x 5 x 5m containment cell. The room is to be observed at all times by a camera, and any unanticipated activity is to be reported immediately. --No personnel should enter SCP-1691 at any time unless authorised for testing.-- In light of the events of Incident-1691-1, entry to SCP-1691 is absolutely forbidden. Two armed guards are placed outside the containment chamber at all times, and should be equipped with hand-held transceivers, only to be used in the event of unanticipated activity from inside the cell. Pressure plates are installed inside the cell to provide an early warning system.

**Description:** SCP-1691 is a revolving door. Its framework is made from steel, but the glass that would usually be seen in the wings of such a revolving door has been replaced with large silver glass mirrors. SCP-1691 has four wings and each has two mirrors, placed back to back so as to always provide a reflection. The images provided by the mirrors are clear and undistorted, barring the one mirror which has been cracked. Despite the severity of this damage, all attempts to remove distinct shards of the glass from the door have failed.

When a subject walks through the door to the other side, it will at first appear that they have somehow walked a full circle and returned to the original room. However, it will become apparent that this is not the case. One of the most obvious indications of this is in writing, which will be mirrored (writing brought back to this side of the doors have retained this property) but otherwise no different to the writing present on this side of the door, in terms of location, font, size, etc. Everything else will also be mirrored. Right handed people will become left handed, profiles on coins will face the opposite way, cars will drive on the opposite side of the road as would be expected of the country, etc. All people (hereafter referred to as instances of SCP-1691-1), locations and --history-- (see Incident-1691-1) are identical to ours, differing only in appearance. It has been noted, contrary to hypotheses, that the spoken word is identical to our own and suffers no distortion.
   
The world and people inhabiting it act in total accord to their doppelgänger, as far as it can be seen. Unfortunately, any testing using test subjects also results in a mirrored doppelgänger entering into our world. As such beings are technically SCP-1691-1 instances, there was initially complete resistance to letting the instance of SCP-1691-1 outside of the test chamber. Upon realising that returning SCP-1691-1 also returned the test subject with very little data acquired, this was revised. One supervised trip outside of the facility was allowed before Incident-1691-1. Due to the events that occurred as a result of this, testing has been discontinued and full security procedures have been put in place. 



**Incident-1691-1**

**SCP involved:** SCP-1691, SCP-1691-1 instance
**Personnel involved:** D-9237, Dr. ████████
**Date:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ████ ██, █████████ █████

**Description:** On ██/██/████, a supervised trip of D-9237's SCP-1691-1 copy was authorised, under the conditions that settlements such as towns or cities were not approached. The SCP-1691-1 was to be provided with any photos (unaltered) that it asked for, and any information not related to the SCP Foundation or other sensitive topics. The instance of SCP-1691-1 appeared as D-9237 entered SCP-1691. After being searched, the SCP-1691-1 was blindfolded, gagged, restrained and earplugs applied to before being taken off-site, and remained restrained for the entirety of the time it was outside of the containment cell. (Sedation was suggested, but due to a lack of understanding of chemistry inside SCP-1691 - i.e, whether molecules were their chiral opposites or not – researchers decided that they did not know what effect normal tranquilisers would have on the instance of SCP-1691-1. As such attempts were made instead to suppress sensory and motor abilities as much as was otherwise possible.) Requests for information or images were noted and the results of those that were granted were intended to be given to the SCP-1691-1 shortly before being returned to SCP-1691. After being removed from the site, the copy of D-9237 was driven █ kilometres ████. Upon awakening, it was allowed to examine various examples of flora and fauna native to the area whilst handcuffed at the wrists and ankles, and to request photographs of these specimens. Several armed guards surrounded the SCP-1691-1 throughout. Return to the site was uneventful.

However, when being transported back to SCP-1691's containment cell, a minor security breach of SCP-████ occurred. While this was resolved with minimal casualties, the SCP-1691-1 was killed. 

Assuming that the same had also befallen D-9237, the information the instance of SCP-1691-1 had requested was assembled and placed with the corpse of SCP-1691-1 in SCP-1691, which was then turned.

Contrary to expectations, D-9237 returned alive and with mirrored copies of the information provided by the Foundation. Aware that this may be viewed as an act of hostility against the version of the Foundation within SCP-1691, a negotiator, Dr. ████████, was sent through with minimum delay. 

No instance of SCP-1691-1 was seen coming through SCP-1691 at this time.

Directly after the negotiator was dispatched it became apparent from the information recovered by D-9237 that the world inside SCP-1691 was not actually a perfect (if mirrored) copy. The differences as far as they could be documented are relatively subtle. The major alteration appeared to be a far more violent culture, wherein 'an eye for an eye' was viewed as an acceptable form of vigilantism, gaining positions of power involved the death of the prior holder through set rules, and so on. 

This became clear when Dr. ████████'s corpse was returned through SCP-1691. The cause of death was three bullet wounds aimed at the chest, one of which was through the heart. The other two missed this, being slightly too far to the right. It is theorised that these two shots were fired first, but aimed for the position of the heart as it would be on the instances of SCP-1691-1. That is, it is assumed that internal anatomy in instances of SCP-1691-1 is reversed (such as in individuals with situs inversus). One of the bullets completely passed through Dr. ████████ and hit the revolving door, cracking one of the mirrors.

Fearing further retaliation, more stringent security measures were introduced. 

It is unknown at which point or due to what cause that the contents of SCP-1691 began to fall out of synch with our own. Now that it has, SCP-1691 has become unpredictable. The believed aggression of its inhabitants in particular is particularly worrying. In the worst case scenario, the inhabitants of SCP-1691 could wage war on this planet. The site would likely fall against the force of an army, even if they were forced to come single file through a revolving door. To prevent provocation, all testing has been stopped. 

Research has begun into the decommissioning of SCP-1691.
