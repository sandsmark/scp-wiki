The Mages Academy is a group with locations in several European countries, with its headquarters in Germany, who are dedicated to research the safe study and use of anomalous abilities in form of "magic". While the Foundation essentially sees anomalies as a threat and tries to control them at all costs, the Academy sees them as a natural part of the world and tries to reach a harmonic coexistence by mostly non-violent and scientific dealings.

Although they have existed since ancient times in one form or another, they have thus far managed to hide from the Foundation. Recent events have awoken some interest from the Foundation, but they have not yet listed the Academy as a Group of Interest, and the organization does not seem to have any need to investigate further.

In most bigger Foundation facilities located in Germany, Austria, and other locations in Europe, the Academy has covert agents monitoring the Foundation and taking influence here and there, as well as coordinating secret support or countermeasures by the Academy.

One might think, the students of the Academy run around in Gandalf-esque flowing robes and pointy hats, or would dwell in anomalous castles where gifted children are taught in a Harry-Potter-like parallel society-

Far from it. Most academies are disguised as technical or scientific universities, at which the student learn both "magic" and academic skills, and are even awarded a technical degree in the Sciences. Nobody there wears robes and pointy hats; there is no dress code.

+++ Writing a Mages Academy article

Everybody from all branches can write an SCP or a tale with or about the Mages Academy, in accordance to the following:


* The Mages Academy hides from the Foundation.
 * At the moment, the Foundation does not know of its existence or at least doesn't consider them relevant.
 * The Academy considers the Foundation necessary, though because of different ethics they also see them as threat.

* The Academy has covert agents in nearly every Foundation Site in Germany, most often in positions of Security Level 3 or even 4.
 * This agents behave like normal personnel of the Foundation, though observe and report to the Academy if they uncover something important.
 * They all are advanced mages, but are only using their powers if it would be unavoidable for their mission. Especially higher-rank Foundation agents possess a certain level of immunity to memetic and reality-bending influences.
 * The Academy sometimes tries to secretly support the Foundation, e.g. by blocking interfering forces, removing hazards and the like.

* The locations of the Academy are almost exclusively private schools, universities and other educational institutions where next to the normal lessons, magic is also taught. The goal of the students is, next to acquiring an academic title, is acquiring the title of "Adept of Magic" (which equals a Bachelor's degree).
 * The academic titles of the mages are as follows:
  * Apprentice (equal to Secondary graduation)
  * Adept (equals a Bachelor's degree)
  * Master (equals a Master's degree)
  * Grandmaster (equals a Doctorate)
* Most professors are Grandmasters, general instructors teaching Apprentices are usually Masters.
* After acquiring the title of Adept, mages are free to continue their training, to research, to become an agent in the Foundation, or to live a civilian life.

* The Academy's organization is decentralized, and historically seen a union of several academies.
* Every location is lead by an Archmagister, who is counseled by a council of Docents and Agents. The exact structure varies from location to location.
* The Archmagisters form the Magistrate, and elect a chairman from their midst, who organizes the gatherings of the Magistrate and who calls arguing Archmagisters to order.
* Like the structure, curricula, central themes, and how much each location focuses on education- research, or covert operations, vary from location to location.

* The Academy knows, through a defector, of the existence of 4R and their goals. They do not know much more than the Foundation. Laboratories of which the defector knew had already been deserted.
 * They cannot measure up Rass, neither his strengths nor his possibilities. Black magic, demonology and occultism do not exist as areas of study of the Academy.
 * In case of an encounter between the Academy and Rass' creations and acolytes, they will do the following:
  * Daemonic and Undead creations, be it entities or objects, are being banished/exorcised/destroyed.
  * Non-Daemonic or Undead creations are either destroyed or reported to the Foundation through covert agents or anonymously, depending on the responsible Magister.
  * They will avoid Acolytes and leave them to the Foundation, should it come to confrontation they will kill the Acolyte, in a way so Rass can not revive them.
  * A direct confrontation with the Academy would be fatal for Rass. With the currently low count of followers.
