**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the difficulty of containing SCP-579, it has been contained at Site-579, which has been built specifically for the purpose of containing SCP-579. All staff at Site-579 are to be rotated out biweekly for psychological, physical, and spiritual examinations. In addition, staff assigned to SCP-579 are to score 100 points or higher on the Milgram Obedience Examination.

SCP-579 is to be contained in a 2km x 2km x 1km containment cell lined with steel, lead, titanium, [[[SCP-148|telekill alloy]]] and [UNLOCK EXTREMELY TOUGH MATERIAL DLC FOR ONLY 1000 TELEKILL]. The walls of this containment cell are to be outfitted with lethal visual cognitohazards. SCP-579 is to be suspended at the exact center of this containment chamber by steel chains blessed by a priest of the Islamic church, inside of a spherical secondary cell 12 meters in diameter. The secondary containment cell is to be flooded with gamma radiation once every two hours. Any attempts to breach this secondary containment cell are to be responded to by an automated system, capable of flushing the entire containment cell with sedatives.

In the event that SCP-579 breaches containment and manages to subdue on-site MTF forces, several Foundation satellites located above Site-579 will [UNLOCK THE EXTRANEOUS CONTAINMENT MEASURES DLC FOR ONLY 1000 TELEKILL] All active MTF forces located at the nearby Site-99 are to be deployed to Site-579 to search for the remains of SCP-579.

In the event of an XK-Class "Salted Earth" scenario, Harken-Grey Matter Transporters (HGMT) located at Site-579 will transport SCP-579 and its containment systems to an isolated cavern system located 200 km below surface level. Should the XK-Class scenario make further containment on Earth unfeasible, SCP-579 will instead be transported to the third planet from the star [UNLOCK EXTRATERRESTRIAL DLC FOR ONLY 1000 TELEKILL TODAY]
