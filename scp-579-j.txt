**Item #:** SCP-579

**Object Class:** Keter

**Threat Level:** Black

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the difficulty of containing SCP-579, it has been contained at Site-579, which has been built specifically for the purpose of containing SCP-579. All staff at Site-579 are to be rotated out biweekly for psychological, physical, and spiritual examinations. In addition, staff assigned to SCP-579 are to score 100 points or higher on the Milgram Obedience Examination.

SCP-579 is to be contained in a 2km x 2km x 1km containment cell lined with steel, lead, titanium, and telekill alloy. The walls of this containment cell are to be outfitted with lethal visual cognitohazards. SCP-579 is to be suspended at the exact center of this containment chamber by steel chains blessed by a priest of the Islamic church, inside of a spherical secondary cell 12 meters in diameter. The secondary containment cell is to be flooded with gamma radiation once every two hours. Any attempts to breach this secondary containment cell are to be responded to by an automated system, capable of flushing the entire containment cell with sedatives.

In addition to these measures, the bottom of SCP-579's primary containment cell is to be coated with a three meter thick layer of magma. This magma is to be rotated out every two weeks. The ceiling of the primary containment cell has been equipped with automated sentry turrets capable of firing two hundred .45 bullets a second, should SCP-579 breach containment.

Scranton Reality Anchors (SRA) are to be placed every 3 centimeters across the surface of SCP-579's secondary containment cell. However, SCP-579 itself is not to be directly exposed to SRA's, nor any other device capable of affecting the local Hume level. To meet this purpose, each SRA has been equipped with a self-destruct mechanism that will activate if SCP-579 breaches its secondary containment cell.

MTF Eta-19 ("Avaritia") is to respond to any breaches made by SCP-579 despite these measures. MTF Eta-19 is to be housed at Site-579 for the purposes of the containment of SCP-579. MTF Eta-19 has been equipped with high-energy laser weapons for the purposes of subduing SCP-579. Under no circumstances is SCP-579 to be referred to as "Grandpapi Aligo," especially by members of MTF Eta-19.

In the event that SCP-579 breaches containment and manages to subdue MTF Eta-19, several Foundation satellites located above Site-579 will nuke SCP-579 from orbit. All active MTF forces located at the nearby Site-99 are to be deployed to Site-579 to search for the remains of SCP-579. Once SCP-579 is recovered, it is to be held in containment until Site-579 is rebuilt.

In the event of an SK-Class "Dominance Shift" scenario, Foundation biologists stationed at Site-579 will bombard SCP-579 with alpha waves, with the intent of mutating it into an unrecognizable state. Should this become impossible due to the impending SK-Class scenario, artificial intelligence systems contained on-site at Site-579 will fulfill this purpose.

In the event of an XK-Class "Salted Earth" scenario, Harken-Grey Matter Transporters (HGMT) located at Site-579 will transport SCP-579 and its containment systems to an isolated cavern system located 200 km below surface level. Should the XK-Class scenario make further containment on Earth unfeasible, SCP-579 will instead be transported to the third planet from the star GHY-448645792, located in the Andromeda galaxy. This planet has been sterilized by MTF Eta-19 to prevent the formation of life, and a location has been pre-prepared for SCP-579;

In the event of a ZK-Class "End of Reality" scenario, SCP-579 and its containment systems are to be transported to an alternate reality. A pocket universe (known as Gamma-Kappa-12) has been created by the Foundation Multi-U department for this purpose. Should transport to Gamma-Kappa-12 become unfeasible, SCP-579 may be transported to any alternate reality with a Foundation analogue.
