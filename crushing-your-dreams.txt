+ As Fifth Disaster Hits Xiupania, Officials Assess Damages
++ Things aren't looking very good for the isolated area.
[[size 1.2em]]
Several devastating unnatural disasters have recently struck the area of Xiupania, a locale that has been hit particularly hard by the destruction affecting the Oneiroi Collective. This is following an unexpected expansion of Xiupania in 2030 after Jason Graham's induction into the Fifth Church, and the subsequent disappearance of Qi Shao. 

We reached out to officers within Xiupania, and the official statement of Xiupania disaster response is as follows:

//As of now, we have a very incomplete picture of the issue. However, we can say for certain that we have plans in place for massive repairs and restructuring to Xiupania, to amend current disasters and prepare for future ones. Our plan of action at the moment is discussing the issue with administrators and moderators of the Oneiroi West dreamspace, as the disasters seem to be hitting their areas as well. We do not have enough knowledge at the moment to determine if these are intentional or targeted attacks.//

For now, if you can, evacuate the area of Xiupania and consider logging off of Oneiroi West. And for corporeals... we suggest a heavy dose of coffee.

+ A Guide To The Apocalypse
++ Frequently asked questions.
[[size 1.2em]]
Ever since tornados, earthquakes, and sea creature kaijus have started attacking Xiupania, as well as a large amount of suspicious constellation themed accounts wreaking havoc on Oneiroi West, dreamers and pures alike have been wondering how to survive the onslaught. We've heard your questions, and we're here now to answer them.

Q: What happens to me if I die in my dreams?

A: Several studies have been conducted concluding that dream death simply leads the dreamer to the waking world. However, it has recently been found that many of these studies were financed by DreamSmart, an organization notoriously suspected of anti-pure sentiments and currently being investigated for fraud against its followers. New research suggests that in the event of death, corporeals are disconnected from their bodies for a variable amount of time before waking. It is unknown if pures are capable of truly dying within dreamspace.

Q: Where can I go to avoid the disasters?

A: The Id is a great place, if you don't mind your inner demons. For those of us who would prefer not to confront their own flaws, the Fifth Church is offering refuge in its dreamspace wings. Try not to lose your head.

Q: Is this an intentional attack?

A: Citizens suspect that this is a Fifthist machination, as many of the disasters have been associated with large entities containing pentaradial symmetry (a motif heavily emphasized in Fifthist religious doctrine). However, Fifth Church representatives would like to remind everyone that starfishes do not have singular brains. Rather, a starfish has a nerve ring around their mouth and a radial nerve that runs along the ambulacral region of each arm.

There is no need for fear. 

I was like you too, once. Unable to see around me, see what joys past the damp and airless cages danced carefree. It is not too late for you. But if I am to humbly offer you my advice, then please, heed these words; open your eyes, your ears, to the stars beyond your walls, and they will greet you themselves in turn.

++++++ WORLD NEWS

+ Disaster Cleanup Efforts Moving Along As Expected, Officials Say
++ With the help of PSYCHE, the effects of the disasters have been majorly mitigated.
[[size 1.2em]]
The disasters of 2030 have finally come to a close, with the reported cause being a meatspace fifthist meme (probably). Efforts to stop the nightmares topside were perpetuated by several normalcy enforcement agencies, most particularly the Global Occult Coalition. There has been strong controversy about the nature of this aid, however, so we have reached out to several sides for commentary on the issue.
[[/size]]

//i'm still not cool with it. we've let them back into dreamspace and it's only a matter of time until they decide that the pures don't matter and throw some horrific nightmares at us again. if you want my opinion on your "new and improved policy," whichever GOC schmuck is reading this, it's that you should fuck off and stay out.// - ##darkred|exkavatore##, Oneiroi West citizen

//There have been concerns raised about our dealings in the Oneiroi Collective. We would like to formally apologize on the behalf of previous Coalition administration. Looking forward, we are hoping to build more trust with communities recognized by humanity as anomalous, starting with the disaster repair efforts from our PSYCHE division.// - ##indigo|gamma-ochre##, GOC representative account

//my stance? be grateful that no more people have had to die from this. you really hate the GOC so much, go shut down fifthists on their own territory if you can. there are worse things to worry about than a corporeal's helping hand.// - ##orange|jackaljudiciary##, newly appointed Oneiroi West moderator
