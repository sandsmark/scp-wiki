**Description:** 

SCP-500 is a small plastic can which at the time of writing contains fifty-nine red pills. One pill, when taken orally, effectively cures the subject of all diseases within two hours, exact time depending on the severity and amount of the subject's conditions. Despite extensive trials, all attempts at synthesizing more of what is thought to be the active ingredient of SCP-500 have been unsuccessful.

**Note From Dr. Klein:**
SCP personal below Level 3 are now banned from handling SCP-500. This is not to be used to cure a hangover. Get AIDS and then ask permission.

**Request 500-1862-b**
Dr.Gears has requested the use of one SCP-500 pill for testing in [[[SCP-914]]].  Request is pending approval.

**Addendum 500-1:**As a result of conducting a series of tests on Class D subjects infected with [[[SCP-008]]], it appears that even in the most advanced stages of the disease one whole pill will accomplish full recovery. - Dr. [500-0021D]

**Addendum 500-2:**Pills were tested on Subject 409-D5 who was exposed to the effects of [[[SCP-409]]]. Complete recovery accomplished. See Addendum 409-1. Number of pills are fifty-eight by the time of writing. - Dr. [500-0021D]

**Addendum 500-3:**Testing the ability of [[[SCP-038]]] to duplicate SCP-500 has been suggested. - Dr. [500-0022F]

**Addendum 500-4:** Attempt was made to test SCP-500's effectiveness on [[[SCP-107]]]. Personnel D-4█████ was exposed to [[[SCP-107]]], then to SCP-500 (after reaching comatose state, to test full effectiveness). Subject immediately stopped "hearing" [[[SCP-107]]]. Subject was re-exposed to former host body of [[[SCP-107]]]. No results. [[[SCP-107]]] reclassified as Neutralized.

**Addendum 500-5:** [[[SCP-038]]] can duplicate SCP-500. However, success rate are low, and generally leave the victim with lingering effects if death is averted. However, for all personnel dosing with SCP-038 cloned pills is recommended, as supply of SCP-500 remains extremely limited.
