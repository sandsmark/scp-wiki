------

**History:** Dr. Gibbons, PhD in Criminalistic Science, was a Forensic Investigator working for the Argentinian's Scientific Police, before gaining attention from the Foundation at the age of ██, when he discovered SCP-[DATA EXPUNGED] inside the body of a murder-suicide victim. The notable work that Gibbons did at documentation, handling and testing of the SCP (Named by Gibbons "Unusual Object-Alfa-00") gained him the Foundation's expectations in order to join as a researcher.

**Profile:** 

* Although serious when the situation needs it, Gibbons has proved to be a calmed and ocassionally funny person, happy with his current job.

* Gibbons has also proved dexterity with weaponry assembly and handling.
* Generally sociable.
* Has shown slight symptoms of multiple personality disorder, --Tourette's Syndrome-- and Dyslexia. //After a neurological evaluation it has been confirmed that Dr. Gibbons has all the characteristic symptoms of Tourette's Syndrome.

* Uses glasses due to a terrible eyesight.
* Interests include: Sharpshooting, writing, programming, reading, and "A metric fuckton of other stuff".

* Enjoys executing and watching practical jokes.
