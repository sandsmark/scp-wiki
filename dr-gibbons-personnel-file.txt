**History:** Dr. Gibbons, PhD in Criminalistic Science, was a Forensic Investigator working for the Argentinian's Scientific Police, before gaining attention from the Foundation at the age of ██, when he discovered SCP-[DATA EXPUNGED] inside the body of a murder-suicide victim. The notable work that Gibbons did at documentation, handling and testing of the SCP (Named by Gibbons "Unusual Object-Alfa-00") gained him the Foundation's expectations in order to join as a low-level researcher, instead of standard termination.
