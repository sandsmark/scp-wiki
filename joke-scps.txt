title:Joke SCPs
This is an index of all the "joke" articles on the SCP Wiki. If you are interested in contributing a Joke SCP, keep the following in mind:

* **Joke SCPs must be funny.** Site members will generally downvote Jokes that they don't find funny.
* **Pop culture and video game references don't work when done straight.** Just as with main series SCPs about mythology or folklore, it generally won't work unless you add a healthy dose of Foundation-flavored twist to it. Evangelions and portal guns simply won't cut it.
* **The Joke index is not a dump box for ideas that didn't make the cut for the main series.** Joke SCPs are generally considered harder to write than main-series SCPs and are one of the top three most difficult things for new authors to write about (along with Humanoids and Keter-class objects).
