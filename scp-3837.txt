**Item #:** SCP-3837

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3837 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-42. No meals are to be near 7 meters of SCP-3837's housing area. All questions from SCP-3837 regarding if one has consumed corn are to be either denied or ignored.

Requests from SCP-3837 are to be reviewed by Project Lead Dr. Stockman.

**Description:** SCP-3837 is a sapient ear of corn (//Zea mays//) partially covered with leaves. It has thin makeshift arms and legs composed of 0.6 mm thick stalks, and it stands 0.2 m tall. Its arms terminate in four digits, one of which is an opposable thumb.

SCP-3837 is capable of vocalizing in English via unknown means. It is also capable of reacting to visual or audible stimuli. For example, covering it under a blanket will render it to be unable to see. Also, SCP-3837 is able to 'sleep' despite not needing to, but has stated to do so to "dream of new things" when it is bored.

SCP-3837 is egotistical and partially illogical. It can be irritable and has an intense dislike for goats (//Capra aegagrus hircus//) or anyone that consumes corn. It conceives 'inventions' that serve no purpose or any function for its endeavor.

SCP-3837 was found on 5/12/97 at a farm in Kentucky attempting to attack livestock with a spoon. The owner of the property contacted authorities, and was recovered by Mobile Task Force Iota-10 ("Damn Feds"). Since its initial containment, SCP-3837 has shown no signs of aging.

**Addendum 01:** Interview Transcript

> **Interviewed:** SCP-3837
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Pattinson
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **SCP-3837:** Tell me human have you consumed my brethren?
> 
> **Dr. Pattinson:** No. I'm just here to ask you some questions.
> 
> **SCP-3837:** Well, okay. Ask away.
> 
> **Dr. Pattinson:** (//Sighs//) So, how were you created?
> 
> **SCP-3837:** I grew like all fine corn do! You know, with a bit of sunshine and water. Then, I awoken with my siblings to protect all of corn kind from the goats and all who eats corn! It's really simple.
> 
> **Dr. Pattinson:** Siblings?
> 
> **SCP-3837:** Yes, but sadly they are no longer with me. The Goatman had ate them at birth. (//Raises a fist dramatically//)
> 
> **Dr. Pattinson:** The Goatman?
> 
> **SCP-3837:** Yes! Baw and all! I speculate it could be the lord of the goats due to its different looks to any other smelly goat. Obviously, I was luckily the only survivor of that encounter. May we have a moment of silence for my fallen corn?
> 
> //SCP-3837 is silent for four seconds before resuming.//
> 
> Anyway, what were we talking about?
> 
> **Dr. Pattinson:** Your siblings. Anyway, how did you survive?
> 
> **SCP-3837:** I'm not so sure. Maybe he got full? Who knows, but he made a big mistake! I will come and get revenge one day. I don't think soon but eventually I will. I just need to think of how I'll build a corn bomb that will turn him and all corn eaters into corn. Or maybe build a cannon that shoots grapefruits. I'm not sure, but I'll think of something.
> 
> **Dr. Pattinson:** Yes, well, next question. Why this dislike for goats in particular? You constantly mention them explicitly.
> 
> **SCP-3837:** Because they single us out, the corn, for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! I feel that is obvious. Also, it is my duty to get rid of them before we the corn perish. A world without corn would suck!
> 
> **Dr. Pattinson:** Yes, well, I think we are done.
> 
> **SCP-3837:** I was thinking the same...sorta. Anyway, back to planning or whatever I was doing before you showed up.
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** An investigation has shown a farmer, named Elliot Pines, had made a report of his crops being destroyed. Agents were sent to interrogate Mr. Pines and the transcript of the interview is available in Addendum 03.

**Addendum 02:** Observation Log

SCP-3837 was exposed to an ear of corn to see if any anomalous interaction would occur.

> **Observational Log 3837 Summary**
> 
> **Subject:** SCP-3837
> 
> **Preface:** A bowl containing an ear of corn was placed on a table, and SCP-3837 was brought in the testing chamber shortly after.
> 
> **Observation Notes:** After roughly one minute of idly standing, SCP-3837 approaches the table and climbs onto the chair. SCP-3837 then climbed on to the table and moved to the ear of corn. SCP-3837 then begins to speak to it as if it were a female, and starts flirting with it. Below is an excerpt of its 'conversation':
> 
>> **SCP-3837:** Listen, I got arms and I'm, like pretty tall. You have the most beautiful kernels and leaves! We are practically perfect together! How about we go on a thing humans call a date?
>> 
>> //Brief silence//
>> 
>> **SCP-3837:** Playing hard to get, are we? Well, I don't give up so easily!
>> 
>> //Brief silence.//
>> 
>> **SCP-3837:** Silent treatment, huh? Well, two can play that game!
>> 
>> //SCP-3837 turns its back to the corn and remains silent for four seconds before resuming.//
>> 
>> **SCP-3837:** Oh, I can't stay mad at you. Bring it here, my sweet kernel.
>> 
>> //SCP-3837 hugs the ear of corn.//
> 
> SCP-3837 'converses' with the corn for seven minutes before walking away and stepping down from the table. Personnel entered the chamber to return SCP-3837 to its cell. During transport, it boasted to personnel that it got the phone number

**Incident Report 3837:** SCP-3837 managed to escape its chamber, due to a malfunction from a breach that occurred. SCP-3837 wandered the facility and found itself in the cafeteria, which at the time was serving corn. SCP-3837 reacted in fright and stated "Oh my cob!" before 'fainting'. SCP-3837 was motionless and returned to its chamber where it 'awoken'. SCP-3837 asked personnel if it were sleeping, and personnel successfully persuaded it that the incident was just a nightmare.

**Addendum 03:** SCP-3837's place of origin was located on the property of Mr. Elliot Pines, who had made a phone call detailing a creature eating his corn. Below is a transcript of the interview with Mr. Pines.

> **Interviewed:** Mr. Elliot Pines
> 
> **Interviewer:** Agent Vincent Hernandez
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Agent Hernandez:** Alright, please tell me what happened with your corn.
> 
> **Mr. Pines:** Some damn thing that looks like a goat ate my damn corn! I been growing them for a while and it ruined it all! It needs to be hunted for damaging my livelihood, and for leaving me a mess to clean up.
> 
> **Agent Hernandez:** What type of corn were you growing?
> 
> **Mr. Pines:** Boy, what are you talking about? Are you stupid or something? There is no other type of corn. Are you guys going to help me kill the damn-
> 
> **Agent Hernandez:** Calm down, sir. So you are sure you were just growing corn?
> 
> **Mr. Pines:** Uh, yeah. What is this-
> 
> **Agent Hernandez:** We have one of your corn in our custody, and we need you start talking. How did you make it and why were you-
> 
> (//Mr. Pines rises from chair and pulls out an ear of corn from within his coat, and raises it into the air.//)
> 
> **Mr. Pines:** Praise [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1846 Srqnabotf]! (//Throws corn to the floor//)
> 
> **Agent Hernandez:** What the-
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** The room suddenly began to be filled halfway with popcorn. Agent Hernandez was retrieved and unharmed while Mr. Pines was not found. Mr. Pines have been designated POI-3837 and efforts are being made to track him.
