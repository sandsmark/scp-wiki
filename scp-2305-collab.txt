> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** A double album from Tupac Shakur, titled "██ ████ Can't Fuck With Me" and billed as a compilation of unreleased tracks, is shipped to record stores worldwide for sale on 09/13/20██ from an unidentifiable source. All 25 tracks feature bands and individuals Tupac Shakur has never performed with, such as Gorillaz, Talking Heads, Merzbow, and SCP-████. Every track explicitly details various aspects about the Foundation's history, members, site locations, and procedures, as well as revealing the existence of anomalies and possible methods for creating them. Multiple Foundation resources are put into stopping the production of the double album, as well as destroying all copies, but 15 million copies are sold worldwide in three weeks, as well as multiple reviews in various publications. One month after release, the masquerade is considered lost. Global support for the United Nation's Global Occult Coalition is elevated worldwide, and the Foundation loses funding and downsizes its operations by 90%.
