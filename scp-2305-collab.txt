> **Item #:** [[[SCP-139]]]
> 
> **Object Class:** Keter
> 
> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Incineration of SCP-139.
> 
> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** Incineration chamber is destroyed, killing personnel tending to the chamber. A humanoid entity (dubbed SCP-139-A) composed of fire and metal pieces appears, with SCP-139 as its head. It claims to be "Sepid the White", a high-ranking Daevite general. Changes are noted in SCP-140, addressing SCP-139-A's revival and the return of the Daevite heralded by SCP-139-A. Activity is detected in Daevite sites worldwide, unleashing entities believed to be the Daevite. Human civilisation in Africa, Europe and Asia is destroyed, replaced with the Renewed Daevite Empire. Humans residing in those regions are enslaved wholesale by the Daevites. A resistance movement called "Rebirth of Adytum" is found in Greece, the Saharan, Northwestern India and the Urals, led by an individual named "Grand Karcist Ion". Humanity is centred in the Holy Pacific Coalition, a dictatorship controlled by the Global Occult Coalition and an escaped SCP-2131. Foundation personnel are actively hunted down by either the Renewed Daevite Empire, Holy Pacific Coalition, or Rebirth of Adytum.

> **Item #:** [[[SCP-1775]]]
> 
> **Object Class:** Euclid
> 
> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Destruction of SCP-1775 via controlled demolition
> 
> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** SCP-1775-X instances break containment, fleeing SCP-1775 shortly after its destruction and attacking nearby Foundation forces. SCP-1775-X prove to be extraordinarily powerful, and the Foundation suffers numerous casualties in their attempt to neutralize them.

> **Item #:** [[[SCP-1909]]]
> 
> **Object Class:** Euclid
> 
> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Removing all historically valuable items from SCP-1909 and filling it with wet cement. 
> 
> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** Immediately after SCP-1909 is sealed off, the corpse of Alexander the Great (hereafter SCP-1909-A) becomes active, and exhibits Type Green ("Greatest Concern") reality bending capabilities. After escaping confinement, SCP-1909-A produces a hypnotic effect on all citizens of the country of Greece, as well as all human beings with the given name "Alexander" or some variant of it. SCP-1909-A creates widespread global unrest via its actions, and proclaims its desire to conquer the world.

> **Item #:** [[[SCP-2123]]]
> 
> **Object Class:** Keter
> 
> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Cut all power to the supercollider and destroy the electromagnets with conventional explosives.
> 
> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** SCP-2123 undergoes an excursion event 5 ms before electromagnetic destruction, causing an aborted, incomplete excursion event. Immediate effects include an explosive gamma ray burst from [[[SCP-2131]]], causing complete destruction of the containment site, but no other casualties are reported. Gamma ray bursts become more prevalent throughout the universe, indicating high levels of matter/antimatter annihilation. Two days later, [[[SCP-1548]]] accelerates to 0.98c and transmits, "Now you've done it!" before undergoing a supernova and creating a relativistic bow shock that collapses the Crab Nebula. Three days later, [[[SCP-736]]] redirects Iapetus towards Saturn, causing the ejection of Titan towards the Earth. Two weeks later, [[[SCP-2631]]] enters an active state and emits multiple waves of nanites, but Operation 99-Tripurantaka is successful in disrupting communication with the Kuiper Belt, preventing the release, apparently with a 0.1% of the mass involved in the explosions being anti-matter, igniting the upper atmosphere of the Earth in the process of destroying the satellites. Gamma radiation in the upper atmosphere seen to increase. 37 hours later, a relativistic payload enters the inner solar system and, apparently due to the misaligned communications and antimatter collisions, enters the opposite side of Earth's orbit and collides with [[[SCP-2092]]] instead, vaporizing both. Final communication detected from SCP-2092 states that despite the correct answer, Earth must still wait 2 more millennia. Two months later, [[[SCP-2399]]] starts repairs at a greatly accelerated level, successfully launching from the Great Red Spot and accelerating towards the Earth. Twelve hours later, extreme levels of gamma ray bursts are detected throughout the Triangulum Galaxy. The launch of SCP-2399 causes [[[SCP-2722]]] to activate and autonomously engage to intercept. On approach to the Earth, SCP-2399 collides with Titan, and the resulting explosion annihilates 37% of Titan's mass, and diverts the surviving portion into the Moon. [[[SCP-2460]]] is gravitationally separated from the Earth and collides with the Titan-Moon conglomeration, just as SCP-2722 fires planet-busting weapons at the lunar mass. The Titan-Moon conglomeration undergoes quantum spin annihilation, and the weapons fire passes harmlessly through the lunar mass to impact the Earth, causing its destruction. [[[SCP-319]]]-2 is released, and the universe undergoes energy state reduction, but is reversed by the sudden activation of [[[SCP-2700]]], causing the universe to remake itself at the Earth.

> **Item #:** [[[SCP-2137]]]
> 
> **Object Class:** Keter
> 
> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Damaging SCP-2137 in such a way as to render track 7 unplayable
> 
> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** A double album from Tupac Shakur, titled "██ ████ Can't Fuck With Me" and billed as a compilation of unreleased tracks, is shipped to record stores worldwide for sale on 09/13/20██ from an unidentifiable source. All 25 tracks feature bands and individuals Tupac Shakur has never performed with, such as Gorillaz, Talking Heads, Merzbow, and SCP-████. Every track explicitly details various aspects about the Foundation's history, members, site locations, and procedures, as well as revealing the existence of anomalies and possible methods for creating them. Multiple Foundation resources are put into stopping the production of the double album, as well as destroying all copies, but 15 million copies are sold worldwide in three weeks, as well as multiple reviews in various publications. One month after release, the masquerade is considered lost. Support for the United Nation's Global Occult Coalition is elevated worldwide, and the Foundation loses funding and downsizes its operations by 90%.

> **Item #:** [[[SCP-2144]]]
> 
> **Object Class:** Euclid
> 
> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Lock SCP-2144 in a hermetically-sealed container. SCP-2144 expires via asystole. 
> 
> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** On the night after successful neutralization, all personnel involved in neutralization attempt claim to have been visited by an entity known as SCP-2144-1 (referring to itself as "Mel") in their respective dreams. SCP-2144-1 accuses said personnel of murder [of SCP-2144] and that they "will pay dearly". Over the course of the next 9 months, targeted personnel had expired via cyanide poisoning. Instances of SCP-2144 have been found with the corpses of each personnel, albeit these instances appear to be heavily disfigured or malformed.

> **Item #:** [[[SCP-2282]]]
> 
> **Object Class:** Euclid
> 
> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Euthanize it as it approaches the end of its natural lifespan.
> 
> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:**  SCP-2282 undergoes sudden spatial distortion upon expiry, its non-Euclidean digestive tract expanding to fill Euclidean space. There are extensive descriptions of the effects of the spatial distortions on the attending doctors, along with a calculation of lost productivity and distraught family members. The smell of 16 million kg of decaying goat entrails is described in detail. A Foundation-wide barbecue is recommended.

> **"The moral of the story:"** Oops, you already tried this. Lol.

> **Item #:** [[[SCP-2513]]]
> 
> **Object Class:** Euclid
> 
> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Destruction of the bridge via timed C4 explosive charges. 
> 
> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** SCP-2513's anomalous effect spreads to every bridge located within the territory of the Republic of Italy. Massive public anti-Carthage hysteria ensues, and before the attempted cover up could be completed, Italy declares war on Tunisia, resulting in widespread geopolitical turmoil.

> **"The moral of the story:"** //Et tu, Foundation?//

> **Item #:** [[[SCP-2516]]]
> 
> **Object Class:** Euclid
> 
> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Send SCP-2516-1 (which is still alive) through SCP-2516-2, followed by destruction of SCP-2516-2 via explosives.
> 
> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** Three months following the destruction of SCP-2516-2, individuals from SCP-2516-1's universe enter baseline reality and begin attacking all civilians sighted. Apparently, SCP-2516-1 informed members of its reality of baseline reality and the Foundation. Due to the Foundation's "illegal" detainment of SCP-2516-1, war is declared on baseline reality. Western Europe is then engulfed by an invasion from the Elohimite Latin Pontiffate, a supra-national political entity in which Taured is apparently a leading member state of.

> **Item #:** [[[SCP-2707]]]
> 
> **Object Class:** Euclid
> 
> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Termination of SCP-2707 via injection of hydrogen cyanide, followed by cremation of its carcass. 
> 
> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** No observable side-effects are detected until 20 years following the termination of SCP-2707. A magnitude 8.4 earthquake occurs on Iceland, triggering volcanic activity in the island. Simultaneously, a Category 5 cyclone occurs in the Indonesian Archipelago and devastates the nation of Greater Indonesia. In addition, an unknown venomous liquid is detected in the waters of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, causing the extinction of over 90% known species of marine animals and plants. About 90% of the world's water is deemed unfit for drinking.

> **Item #:** [[[SCP-682]]]
> 
> **Object Class:** Keter
> 
> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Detonation of "A million, billion, quadrillion nuculer [sic] bombs" detonated at point-blank range inside of SCP-████.
> 
> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** "Permanent destruction of SCP-682 with no negative side effects. For realsies." [sic]
> 
> **"The moral of the story:"** Come on, you know you've always wanted to try this! ;D
> 
> //As tempting as this sounds, please keep in mind that there are only about ██,███ nuclear weapons in the world (of which the Foundation directly controls █,███), while "a million, billion, quadrillion" could mean anything from 10^^15^^ to 10^^30^^. Even if we could somehow produce that many warheads in anything resembling a reasonable timeframe, AND transport them into SCP-████ without incident, there's no proof that this would actually work. And that's not even getting into the question of wether "nuculer" is just a typo, or if it's actually a reference to something else entirely.// -Dr. Edison
