Parasport drag racing is a form of motorsport wherein specially designed motor vehicles compete to cross a predetermined finish line first; unlike regular drag racing motor vehicles, however, parasport drag racing vehicles extensively utilise anomalous enhancements, thaumaturgic alterations and/or paratechnology to increase their performance far beyond any feasibly normal bounds.

Officially discovered by the Foundation in 2011, the parasport finds its (earliest known) origins in an incident at a race event in 1999. Competitor John Whyte was (retroactively) discovered to have been using paratechnological enhancements in their motorcycle during the event; during the second semi-final Top Fuel Motorbike match, John Whyte's motorcycle suffered a catastrophic anti-karmic shockwave, believed to have been caused by an unintended interaction between an active U-Space gateway used for retrocausal deployment of the braking system and Type-A ectomorphs present in the vehicle's nitromethane supply.

While John Whyte (and multiple nearby spectators) were killed in the immediate aftermath,[[footnote]]John Whyte's motorcycle, however, survived the event. (See: SCP-████.)[[/footnote]] the event nonetheless inspired other thaumaturgy-aware competitors to begin (or unofficially continue) augmenting their vehicles with paratechnology.

The Australian Paranormal Drag Racing Association (APDRA, unofficially codenamed 'Snapdragon') is the only P.D.R. organisation recognised as compliant to the Foundation. Established in the months following the 1999 John Whyte incident, the APDRA is recognised by most P.D.R. Groups of Interest as the progenitor of the parasport, and is frequently cited as a motivating factor or catalyst in the formation of other P.D.R. G.O.I..

Following frequent interference due to Operation GLEIPNIR, diplomatic negotiations with the Foundation were initiated in March of 2013 by the APDRA. These negotiations culminated in the establishment of the Snapdragon Treaty, which allows for the APDRA to continue functioning unimpeded (and, under some circumstances, protected) by the Foundation, as long as strict guidelines are followed and extensive monitoring by Foundation personnel is allowed. To date, these terms have been upheld.

-----
++ Snapdragon Treaty (Abridged)
[[collapsible show="Show File" hide="Hide File"]]
As outlined in the Snapdragon Treaty, the APDRA is authorised to operate uncontested by the Foundation as long as:

> * The APDRA, and all members of it, prioritise the preservation of the Veil above all; 
> * All locations used by the APDRA are reported and registered with the Foundation;
> * All events held by the APDRA are reported and registered with the Foundation at least two months prior to their commencement;
> * All members of APDRA, and all competitors in APDRA-sanctioned events, are reported and registered with the Foundation;
> * All registrations with the Foundation are renewed annually (registrations twelve months or older are considered null and void; registrations must be updated within one week if the information is rendered incorrect by a change in circumstances);
> * All paratechnology used during registered APDRA events is not used outside of these circumstances;
> * All APDRA members provide detailed and accurate logbooks (Details of owner, details of crew members, details and source of enhancements, etc.) of their vehicles when requested;
> * All Foundation personnel functioning in an official regulatory capacity are granted unrestricted, universal free admittance to all events; such personnel can only be ejected and/or banned from events if their official regulatory capacity is rescinded by Foundation liaisons (Foundation personnel not functioning in a regulatory capacity at any time during an event can be charged and/or banned at the behest of the APDRA);
> * Personnel involved with containing SCP-████ are allowed to utilise it in, at minimum, a single demonstratory race at each APDRA event despite the use of banned paratechnology, as long as containment personnel do not add further banned technology to SCP-████;
> * That all bans on paratechnology imposed by the Foundation are strictly and immediately enforced by APDRA officials (with penalties including: vehicle impoundment, disassembly and/or destruction; indefinite registration revocation, apprehension, and/or amnestisation of the owner; and/or termination of Foundation-APDRA relationships and the Snapdragon Treaty).

++ Registered Locations (Abridged)
[[collapsible show="Show File" hide="Hide File"]]
The following is a list of several significant and/or repeatedly used locations registered by the APDRA.

> **Location Name:** 9 & 6/4ths.
> 
> **Entry Location:** Hidden Valley Raceway, Darwin, Northern Territory. 
> 
> **Method of Access:** Accessed via a camouflaged extradimensional manifold covering the supporting wall of Pit Bay 10. (Note: This manifold is only accessible from Pit Bay 10. Entrance from Pit Bay 11 is not possible.) When not in use, the manifold is blocked using an installed bulkhead; the locking mechanism, a double-cylinder vertical deadbolt, is composed entirely of beryllium bronze to prevent anomalous tampering. 
> 
> **Description:** Identical replica of --the Hidden Valley Raceway--.[[footnote]]Exploration beyond the boundaries of 9 & 6/4ths has confirmed that the location is an uninhabited replica of the entire Darwin City region as it was on an indeterminate past date; a replica of the satellite city Palmerston has also been located to the south. Further exploration has been impeded by a complete absence of functional communication infrastructure.[[/footnote]] Entrants emerge from a manifold on the supporting wall of Pit Bay 11.

> **Location Name:** Two Blackbutts. 
> 
> **Entry Location:** Blackbutt, Queensland; Blackbutt, Wollongong, New South Wales. 
> 
> **Method of Access: (Accessing Two Blackbutts is currently not advised. See Description.)** Accessible by burning a ring of Eucalyptus patens, Eucalyptus pilularis and Eucalyptus todtiana; all objects and entities within this circle will be transported to Two Blackbutts. 
> 
> **Description:** Location is an immense region of dense Eucalyptus bushland. Entrants spontaneously appear within an artificial clearing, a short distance from the main facilities. **As of May 27th, 2013, Two Blackbutts has been designated a high-hazard location due to an alleged hostile enclave of //Joogabinna//[[footnote]]Also referred to as //Jurrawarra//; commonly known as the [[[SCP-1000 | Yowie or Yahoo]]].[[/footnote]] taking residence at the location — no personnel entering Two Blackbutts following this date have returned from the location.**

> **Location Name:** Lake Gairdner Salt Flats. 
> 
> **Entry Location:** Lake Gairdner, South Australia. 
> 
> **Method of Access:** Located 440km north of Adelaide, South Australia. Accessed via normal means. 
> 
> **Description:** Location is an irregularly-shaped salt lake with a maximum length and width of 160 kilometres and 48 kilometres, respectively. Due to the isolation of Lake Gardner and the low population surrounding it — the two closest locations, Yardea Station and the town of Glendambo, having a collective population of less than 100 citizen — scheduled use of the location by the APDRA is not considered a threat to secrecy.

> **Location Name:** 1881. 
> 
> **Entry Location:** Perth, Western Australia. 
> 
> **Method of Access:** Accessible via the 'Eternity' Einstein-Rosen Bridge Generator currently stored at Provisional Facility 2439-ARC-EX. Both the Generator and Provisional Facility 2439-ARC-EX will be decommissioned following the conclusion of the December 30, 1881 racing event. Current predicted year of decommissioning: **{{2366}}**. 
> 
> **Description:** Location is the interior of the ‘impassable dome’ (as recorded by Foundation agents) that encompassed the entire city of Perth, Australia during the year 1881 (See: SCP-2439-ARC-EX). Each successive racing event at the location is held on each successive day of the year 1881, and never takes longer than twenty-four successive hours (starting from midnight); because of these precautions, attendees do not encounter past or future versions of themselves, and residents do not inadvertently create temporal paradoxes by surveying information that attendees would not know at their (relative) point in time.
> 
> While these precautions necessarily limit the number of uses of the location to the number of days in the year 1881, the location has yet to be used more than once each year. **(Note: Foundation personnel have already attended the location during December 31, 1881, executing a mass-amnestisation and memory implantation operation upon all residents of the city at that time; this was conducted in order to ensure such residents emerged from SCP-2439-ARC-EX as described in documentation.)**

> **Location Name:** Castlereagh Dragstrip. 
> 
> **Entry Location:** Castlereagh, Sydney, New South Wales. 
> 
> **Method of Access:** Accessed by a topographically anomalous road splitting from Sheredan Road half-way between the Jolly Street and Hinxman Road intersections;[[footnote]]The exact positioning of this road varies, but is universally located at whatever location an observer deems to be half-way between the two mentioned intersections.[[/footnote]] the road can only be located when approached from the south, and travels north-west for one kilometre between residential fencing.[[footnote]]This road cannot be located from within residential properties; all properties within the area are bordered by singular, unbroken fences.[[/footnote]] 
>  
> **Description:** Location appears to be the Castlereagh Dragstrip (formerly Aerodrome) prior to its closure in April of 1984, and the subsequent development of Castlereigh, Sydney, New South Wales on top of it.[[footnote]]Of note is that most, if not all, attendees of events at the location — including events hosted or managed by other P.D.R. G.O.I. — wear black armbands while present, and all flags at the location are kept at half-mast.[[/footnote]]

> **Location Name:** Lovecraft's Locker. 
> 
> **Entry Location:** Unknown/None. 
> 
> **Method of Access:** Accessible via any functional U-space gateway. 
> 
> **Description:** Location contains all facilities required for drag racing events constructed and styled in a close-packed minimalist fashion, and nothing else; objects dropped beyond the edges of the location fall until observation is impossible. No forms of natural lighting are present; for all intents and purposes, the location exists within a featureless, otherwise empty void.

++ Banned Paratechnology (Abridged)
[[collapsible show="Show File" hide="Hide File"]]
+++ Foundation Banned
> * Runcible technology;
> * Retrocausal technology;
> * Ectomorphs (of any type) from unlicensed suppliers (The Foundation does not license suppliers stocking Class-A or -B ectomorphs);
> * Memetic, Info- and Cognito-hazards;
> * Alkahest;
> * Naked, contained and/or uncontained singularities;

+++ APDRA Banned
++++ Pre-Snapdragon Treaty
> * Spatial displacement/replacement/compression technology;
> * Retrocausal technology;
> * GT-type temporal dilation technology;[[footnote]]GT-type (‘Greater Than’) temporal dilation decelerates the flow of time relative to the user, causing them to significantly speed up relative to observers. Other types of temporal dilation include:
> **ET-Type (‘Equal To’):** Alters the flow of time in a manner that causes all observers and users to perceive the same relative flow of time. All such technology falls under one of two sub-classifications:
>> **Greater Geared:** All observers experience time at a slower rate to the norm, without themselves being excluded from the effect.
>> **Lesser Geared:** All observers experience time at a faster rate to the norm; this frequently results in observer actions becoming over-exaggerated, due to their consciousness becoming incapable of reacting at the same rate as their physical body.
> **LT-Type (‘Lesser Than’):** Accelerates the flow of time relative to the user, causing them to slow down relative to observers.[[/footnote]]
> * Memetic, Info- and Cognito-hazards;
> * Uncontained singularities;

++++ Post-Snapdragon Treaty
> * All paratechnology banned by the Foundation;
> * Spatial displacement/replacement/compression technology;
> * GT-type and Lesser Geared ET-type temporal dilation technology;

[[/=]]
[[/div]]
-----
Operation GLEIPNIR denotes all past and ongoing operations focused upon the management, disruption and/or disbandment of P.D.R. G.O.I.. To date, over 300 successful (official) operations have been performed, disrupting the operation of multiple known G.O.I. and preventing the formation of more.

Since its initiation in October of 2011 following the discovery of Parasport Drag Racing, the mission statement of Operation GLEIPNIR has been altered twice: in March of 2013 the APDRA was officially excluded as a target in Operation GLEIPNIR, as per the terms of the Snapdragon Treaty; and in July of 2016 the Global Occult Coalition was officially included as cooperative faction following the dissolution of La Fédération Française Paranormale en Courses Automobiles.

While under normal circumstances the Foundation would adopt a stance of universal confiscation in regards to paratechnology, the willingness for the APDRA to submit to monitoring presented a rare opportunity; by enabling the APDRA to continue functioning as long as information is provided regarding who, what, when and where all paratechnology is obtained from, the APDRA willingly functions as an invaluable source of information about paratechnology supply routes and production sources. In addition the disruption of all other P.D.R. G.O.I. functions as an incentive for P.D.R. persons of interest to join the APDRA, further expanding the scope of the information source; furthermore, in the event that action must be taken to permanently end all P.D.R. activities, the Foundation would already have extensive information about an immense portion of P.D.R. P.O.I. and would be significantly more effective in such actions.

As per the second amendment of the Operation GLEIPNIR mission statement, Foundation agents and assets are authorised to be used by the G.O.C. to disrupt or disband P.D.R. G.O.I., as long as such assets are not misused and the G.O.C. takes no actions (direct or indirect) against the APDRA. To date, these terms have been upheld — however, it is suspected that the G.O.C. has disbanded or destroyed in excess of 40 active P.D.R. G.O.I. without officially informing the Foundation of such.
