> **DATE:** 15/12/2005
> **FROM:** Site Director August <august@scp.foundation>
> **TO:** O5-5 Secretary <o55sec@scp.foundation>
> **SUBJECT:** Re: Containment Breach
> -----
> I'm still not quite sure what just happened.
> 
> Yesterday, our bots picked up unauthorized changes to documents on our internal servers. Two minutes later, all on-site personnel -- including myself -- blacked out for three hours. Every camera ceased to function during this period.
> 
> When we woke up, we all had headaches, the entire site smelled like cigarettes and cheap alcohol, two of my guards were injured, three bullets were lodged in my desk, and somebody had shot SCP-3043.  The only clue we've got regarding those three hours is SCP-3043's old documentation, which has been... well, 'updated' is one way to put it. I've included it with this email, along with the revised documentation for SCP-3043.
> 
> We've got no clue who this 'Murphy Law' character is. I'm recommending we immediately assign him an SCP identification and start investigating. All the evidence we've got so far indicates that he and SCP-3043 are unrelated anomalies. Also, none of us actually remember him -- despite some of us being 'featured' in... whatever the hell this was.
> 
> The short of it is this: Either he saved us from the mother of all containment breaches... or he just wanted us to think that he did. Regardless of which, we need to know who he is and what the hell he's capable of.

**{{INT. MURPHY LAW DETECTIVE AGENCY - NIGHT}}**

**{{A light-skinned man leans back at his desk, feet up, reading a newspaper. He is clad in a white-collared shirt, with his trademark trilby hat tossed thoughtlessly atop of his desk. We can see his shoulder-strapped holster; it carries a .44 magnum. A bent cigarette rests between his lips. }}**

**{{His name is MURPHY, and he is ready to give anyone a bit of the business. He is hard and handsome -- with the sort of face you could use to smash up concrete, then dust off and still take home to show your ma.}}**

**{{He is also our NARRATOR. His voice is a harsh growl; as if he just swallowed a fistful of spent cigarette butts and followed it down with a sulfuric acid chaser.}}**

= **{{__NARRATOR__}}**
> **{{You see a lot of ugly in this line of work. Good people with bellies full of lead, left to bleed out in rain-soaked alleyways. Love ruined -- turned inside out -- until it just becomes an angry, festering sore. Statues that'll kill you as fast as you blink.}}**

**{{The door to the office flies open. A dark-skinned woman dressed in a white lab-coat bursts in; she is in her 40s, and has a fierce, vibrant beauty. This is the RESEARCHER, and although she might need MURPHY's help, that doesn't mean she's going to like it.}}**

> 
> **{{You're Professor Michelle Lewis.}}**

**{{The RESEARCHER looks down at her name-badge, as if noticing it for the first time. She appears shocked; her eyes rise back up to stare at MURPHY. She now knows her name. It is DR. LEWIS.}}**

**{{MURPHY scowls, but nods his head, moving to open a drawer in his desk.}}**

= **{{__NARRATOR__}}**
> **{{But me? I'm not the sort of man who stays away from trouble.}}**

**{{MURPHY pulls out two shot-glasses, along with a bottle of half-finished whiskey. He sets them atop of his desk, focusing his icy stare on DR. LEWIS.}}**

**{{INT. MURPHY'S CAR - NIGHT}}**

**{{MURPHY drives; DR. LEWIS stares out the window in the passenger seat. City lights wash through the car, casting both of them in a metallic tangerine glow. DR. LEWIS is wearing her seat-belt; MURPHY isn't.}}**

= **{{__NARRATOR__}}**

**{{MURPHY shifts the car in park; DR. LEWIS turns to look at him. MURPHY moves to open the door.}}**

= **{{__NARRATOR__}}**

**{{INT. SITE DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - MORNING}}**

**{{The office is expensively furnished, with framed-glass windows on three of its four walls; outside, a lush garden grows on all of its sides. Morning light streams in through the windows, casting the room in a warm glow.}}**

**{{Standing behind the desk -- facing the rising sun -- is a man. He is short, with russet-brown skin, a shaved head, and a face full of piercings. He wears an exceptionally fine black suit. This is Site Director AUGUST: A hard, brilliant man with a heart of steel.}}**

**{{As MURPHY enters through the door, he's flanked by two men in sharp suits. They are silent, but armed; ready to do violence at a snap of AUGUST's fingers. As MURPHY shrugs himself out of their grip, they station themselves on either side of him.}}**

= **{{__NARRATOR__}}**
> **{{When dealing with Site Director August, you didn't try to bluff. You just kept your cards close and hoped to God the man didn't have a better hand.}}**

= **{{__AUGUST__}}**

= **{{__AUGUST__}}**
> **{{How would you know that? And we care about classifying //all// anomalies, Mr. Law.}}**

= **{{__MURPHY__}}**
> **{{So I've been told. But a little birdy tells me you might have classified one of them wrong. 3043 ain't Safe. It's Keter.}}**

> **{{(smiling)}}**

> **{{You've been speaking to Dr. Lewis, I presume. Where is she?}}**

= **{{__NARRATOR__}}**

= **{{__MURPHY__}}**
> **{{Safe. Unlike 3043. What is it?}}**

**{{AUGUST narrows his eyes. He gives the slightest nod.}}**

= **{{__NARRATOR__}}**

**{{The two men on MURPHY's left and right instantly reach for their sidearms.}}**

= **{{__NARRATOR__}}**
> **{{Lucky for me, I was packing three of a kind.}}**

**{{MURPHY slams his left elbow into one man's stomach; he uses his right hand to draw his magnum .44. As the second man pulls his piece, MURPHY pistol whips him in the temple -- he goes down. MURPHY spins and opens fire -- three shots slam into AUGUST's desk.}}**

**{{AUGUST freezes, but shows no fear. His eyes narrow.}}**

= **{{__NARRATOR__}}**
> **{{It was time to cash out.}}**

= **{{__MURPHY__}}**
> **{{3043. Last chance. What is it?}}**

> **{{3043 was going to make me take the heat for whatever it did to the Professor. It had me wrapped up nice and tight -- even got me to present myself to the Foundation in a pretty little bow.}}**

**{{MURPHY kicks down the door, clad in his trilby -- .44 magnum in hand. The interior of the lab looks like an office; bookshelves stuffed full of science journals, several desks, paperwork scattered everywhere... and DR. LEWIS' chair. The chair's tall back obscures whoever is sitting in it.}}**

**Item #:** SCP-3043

**Object Class:** Neutralized (formerly Safe)

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3043 is to be kept in a secure locker on-site. Access requires Level-3 clearance.

**Description:** SCP-3043 is a 1937 Olympia Elite typewriter. Two .44 caliber bullets are lodged in its casing. Before it was neutralized, SCP-3043 exhibited the ability to rewrite any physical document within its immediate vicinity to match whatever was typed into it. It was neutralized before any additional properties could be confirmed.

On 14-12-2005, a containment breach occurred at Site-95. During this breach, an unknown anomalous event prevented all outside contact for approximately 3 hours. All entities affected by this anomaly have no recollection of the events that occurred during these 3 hours; furthermore, all recording devices within Site-95 appear to have malfunctioned during this period. 

Shortly after this event concluded, Site-95 reported all SCPs were now contained with the exception of SCP-3043. SCP-3043 was found in Dr. Lewis' office in its current state. Dr. Lewis also discovered that all copies of SCP-3043's documentation were now replaced with an 'updated' version (see attached files).
