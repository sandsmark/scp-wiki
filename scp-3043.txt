> **DATE:** 15/12/2005
> **FROM:** Site Director August <august@scp.fo>
> **TO:** O5-5 Secretary <o55sec@scp.fo>
> **SUBJECT:** Re: Containment Breach
> -----
> I'm still not quite sure what just happened.
> 
> Yesterday, our bots picked up unauthorized changes to documents on our internal servers. Two minutes later, all on-site personnel -- including myself -- blacked out for three hours. Every camera ceased to function during this period.
> 
> When we woke up, we all had headaches, the entire site smelled like cigarettes and cheap alcohol, and somebody had shot SCP-3043. The only clue we've got regarding those three hours is SCP-3043's old documentation, which has been... well, 'updated' is one way to put it. I've included it with this email, along with the revised documentation for SCP-3043.
> 
> We've got no clue who this 'Murphy Law' character is. I'm recommending we immediately assign him an SCP identification and start investigating. He claimed to have 'history' with SCP-3043, but nothing we have confirms this; all the evidence we've got so far indicates they're unrelated anomalies. Also, none of us actually remember him -- despite being 'featured' in... whatever the hell this was.
> 
> The short of is this: Either he saved us from the mother of all containment breaches... or he just wanted us to think that he did. Regardless of which, we need to know who he is and what the hell he's capable of.

{{INT. MURPHY LAW DETECTIVE AGENCY - NIGHT}}

{{A light-skinned man leans back at his desk, feet up, reading a newspaper. He is clad in a white-collared shirt, with his trademark trilby hat tossed thoughtlessly atop of his desk. We can see his shoulder-strapped holster; it carries a .44 magnum. A bent cigarette rests between his lips. }}

{{His name is MURPHY, and he is ready to give anyone a bit of the business. He is hard and handsome -- with the sort of face you could use to smash up concrete, then dust off and still take home to show your ma.}}

{{He is also our NARRATOR. His voice is a harsh growl; as if he just swallowed a fistful of spent cigarette butts and followed it down with a sulfuric acid chaser.}}

= {{**NARRATOR**}}
> {{You see a lot of ugly in this line of work. Good people with bellies full of lead, left to bleed out in rain-soaked alleyways. Love ruined -- turned inside out -- until it just becomes an angry, festering sore. Statues that'll kill you as fast as you blink.}}

{{The door to the office flies open. A dark-skinned woman dressed in red bursts in; she is in her 40s, and has a fierce, vibrant beauty. This is DR. LEWIS, and although she might need MURPHY's help, that doesn't mean she's going to like it.}}

= {{**NARRATOR**}}

{{MURPHY slides his feet off the desk and rises to stand. He folds his arms over his chest and watches her.}}

> {{How can I help?}}

= {{**DR. LEWIS**}}
> {{(hesitant)}}

> {{I don't... I don't know how I got here. I don't even know what 'here' is. I was updating the documentation for SCP-3043, when I heard it start typing in the other room, and suddenly...}}

> {{The Foundation. A bunch of pencil-pushing geeks trying to figure out where the magicians were hiding all those rabbits they pulled out of their hats. I should have turned her away right then; when the Foundation's involved, you know it ain't gonna be nothing but trouble.}}

{{MURPHY scowls, but nods his head, moving to open a drawer in his desk.}}

= {{**NARRATOR**}}
> {{But me and SCP-3043... we've got history. Besides, I'm not the sort who stays away from trouble.}}

{{MURPHY pulls a case-file out of the drawer, throwing it on his desk. The case-file is labeled SCP-3043. Half a dozen photographs of SCP-3043 taken from a distance spill out into view, including SCP-3043 posing with several important politicians and businessmen.}}

{{INT. MURPHY'S CAR - NIGHT}}

{{MURPHY drives; DR. LEWIS stares out the window in the passenger seat. City lights wash through the car, casting both of them in a metallic tangerine glow. DR. LEWIS is wearing her seat-belt; MURPHY isn't.}}

= {{**NARRATOR**}}
> {{If Site-95 was the rotting corpse, SCP-3043 was the worms wriggling inside of its core. Bribery, extortion, blackmail -- it had its dirty paws in the pocket of every two-bit researcher, agent, and D-Class from Level 9 down to Sub-Level 7. If we were going to stop it, we needed to know how deep this went. We needed to know just how hard SCP-3043 was to contain.}}

= {{**MURPHY**}}
> {{Alright, Professor. Talk to me: What do you know about SCP-3043?}}

= {{**DR. LEWIS**}}
> {{(startled)}}
> 
> {{How did we... when did we get inside of this--}}

= {{**NARRATOR**}}
> {{She was smart. But that was part of the problem: She was //too// smart. Always thinking too much.  Sometimes, you just gotta go along with the ride.}}

= {{**MURPHY**}}
> {{Focus on the problem. SCP-3043: What do we know?}}

= {{**DR. LEWIS**}}
> {{(frowning, but thinking)}}
> 
> {{...right. It's a typewriter. Classified as Safe. An anomalous typewriter that, when you use it to type something, rewrites any physical document in its vicinity to match what you've typed...}}

= {{**NARRATOR**}}
> {{Yeah, that's what the eggheads thought, because that's what SCP-3043 wanted them to think. But I knew better. And the Professor was smart enough to know better, too.}}

= {{**DR. LEWIS**}}
> {{But I noticed something... it doesn't just rewrite physical documents. It can rewrite any type of information -- digital, electronic... even information inside your head.}}

= {{**MURPHY**}}
> {{You said you were trying to update the documentation.}}

= {{**DR. LEWIS**}}
> {{(growing excited)}}
> 
> {{Yes! I was about to update the documentation. But that's when I heard the tapping -- it was typing on its own. I think... I think it might be sapient. I think it might have been trying to stop me by rewriting its own documentation, or even the words in my head. I remember...}}

{{DR. LEWIS shakes her head, lifting her hands up to her temples.}}

{{INT. SITE-95 INTERROGATION ROOM}}

{{The walls are made of concrete; the table is steel. Across it, a large document has been unrolled. Two figures hover over this document, studying it closely -- like vultures biding their time.}}

{{DR. LEWIS is one of them. Next to her, there's a short, slender man with russet-brown skin, a shaved head, and a face full of piercings. This is Site Director AUGUST.}}

= {{**NARRATOR**}}

= {{**AUGUST**}}

= {{**DR. LEWIS**}}
> {{Which means that even thinking about it makes you vulnerable to it.}}

= {{**AUGUST**}}
> {{So, if we even think about it, it can rewrite what we're thinking?}}

= {{**DR. LEWIS**}}

= {{**AUGUST**}}
> {{Fuck. This whole time, it might have just been pretending to be 'Safe', hiding its sapience...}}

= {{**DR. LEWIS**}}

{{DR. LEWIS glances back at MURPHY, looking him up and down with a skeptical -- but hopeful -- eye.}}

> {{How do we know he's not part of SCP-3043?}}

= {{**NARRATOR**}}

= {{**AUGUST**}}
> {{(scowling)}}

> {{Do we really have much of a choice?}}

= {{**MURPHY**}}
> {{Nope.}}

{{AUGUST and DR. LEWIS exchange looks, standing in silence. Finally, AUGUST turns and nods.}}

= {{**AUGUST**}}

**Item #:** SCP-3043

**Object Class:** Neutralized (formerly Safe)

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3043 is to be kept in a secure locker on-site. Access requires Level-3 clearance.

**Description:** SCP-3043 is a 1937 Olympia Elite typewriter. Two .44 caliber bullets are lodged in its casing. Before it was neutralized, SCP-3043 exhibited the ability to rewrite physical documents within its immediate vicinity.

On 14-12-2005, a containment breach occurred at Site-95. During this breach, an unknown anomalous event prevented all outside contact for approximately 3 hours. All entities affected by this anomaly have no recollection of the events that occurred during these 3 hours; furthermore, all recording devices within Site-95 appear to have malfunctioned during this period. 

Shortly after this event concluded, Site-95 reported all SCPs were now contained with the exception of SCP-3043. SCP-3043 was found in Dr. Lewis' office in its current state. Dr. Lewis also discovered that all copies of SCP-3043's documentation were now replaced with an 'updated' version (see attached files).
