**Item #:** SCP-3173

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Civilians should not be allowed on the island of SCP-3173.  In a 2km radius around the island, civilian boats are to be redirected under the guise of a warning of jagged rocks directly under the water’s surface.  An agreement with the United Nations and Russian government has been reached to block satellite footage and the airspace over the island.

The island is to patrolled by no less than 65 armed personnel, who must not approach the 4-meter concrete wall around the forest.  The personnel must regularly undergo psychological screening to ensure they have no intentions of attempting to enter SCP-3173.  Cameras are lined every 110-meters and are to be constantly monitored.  The singular gate on the wall is welded shut, and to never be opened.

No exploration attempts are allowed, and no living object is to be passed through the barrier.  Birds that might fly nearby are to be killed before reaching the barrier, and no fauna are to be allowed on the island.  If any living objects enter the barrier, they are to be shot and killed instantly.  Civilians that see the island or approach the forest are to be given Class-C amnestics, and redirected.

**Description:** SCP-3173 is a 4 km x 4 km rainforest on a small island off the north shore of Russia, comprised of flora that do not match any known species, encased by a wholly transparent intangible barrier that extends up for about 400 meters, and is an inch thick.  A thick fog is present in the forest due to an unusually high humidity and heat, and the fact that gaseous matter cannot move through the barrier, despite solid and liquid matter moving through with no resistance.  In addition to the separate gaseous atmospheres, heat does not transfer through the barrier, causing a drastic difference in temperature inside and outside the forest; the inside averaging 39 degrees celsius and the outside averaging negative 11 degrees celsius.  The internal atmosphere seems to blend with the outside one at the top of the 400-meter barrier in a gradient fashion.  

SCP-3173 appeared suddenly on 10/12/20██, causing most of the island to be instantly terraformed into the forest it is now.  The few inhabitants of the island were never found.  The Russian government notified the Foundation a few hours later after a boat attempting to return to the island called the local police.  Class-A amnestics were given to anyone who lived on the island, or had relatives there, and Class-B were given to the police who responded to the call.

> 
> **Dr. ██████:** Don’t call me that D-65440. [pause] Please move into SCP-3173
> 
> //Both D-Class proceed into SCP-3173.  They each hold a flashlight which illuminates the forest in front of them.  They are told to move further into 3173, and continue onwards//
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** D-33847, could you collect a sample from the grass and a separate one from a tree for analysis.
> 
> **D-33847:** Sure thing doc.  65, I need to get the sampling gear out of my pack, keep watch
> 
> **D-65440:** Alright. [pause] Wait what am I looking out for exactly we’re totally alone
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** We don’t know what could be in here, just watch D-65440.
> 
> //D-33847’s mounted camera comes off with the pack, and the feed records over his shoulder as he searches for the necessary materials.  D-65440’s camera moves frequently, and he fidgets often.  Eventually he sits down.  Nothing notable happens for about 7 minutes, and the camera on the ground captures D-33847 taking a sample from the grass and leaves of the trees.  D-33847 is placing the samples in his pack when D-65440 jumps to his feet suddenly//
> 
> **D-65440:** Sh-Shit, doc did you see that?
> 
> //D-65440 is pointing to a spot in the trees.  Upon review of the footage, slow movement can be seen for a few frames where he is pointing//
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** No, what did you see?
> 
> **D-65440:** Something moved over there
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** Do you have the samples?
> 
> **D-33847:** Yes.  Yes I have it
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** Alright, you’re clear to return.
> 
> **D-65440:** [panicked] Fuck what is THAT?
> 
> //Nothing appears to be seen on the camera footage, but both D-Class apparently see something there.  After later reanalysis of the video, there is a slight distortion approximately 5 meters away from D-65440.//
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** Where is it, what do you see?
> 
> //D-33847 returns his pack to his shoulders and they back away from where D-65440 was pointing, before turning around and jogging.  The two are about 70 meters from the barrier when D-65440 falls as if his ankle is locked in place.  D-33847 responds quickly, grabbing his hands and pulling.  Later review of the video footage shows that the same distorted air was moving along D-65440’s legs before he was pulled away by D-33847.  The two D-Class breach the barrier, and sit there panting for a few moments before the feed cuts//

> **Dr. Nelson:** Explain what you saw in detail D-33847.
> 
> **D-33847:** It was, I don’t know doc.  You know how the air above a barbeque is thicker than the air around it?  It was like that but it was moving towards us.  It was clearly after us, but it wasn’t hostile I don’t think
> 
> **Dr. Nelson:** Oh?
> 
> **D-33847:** Yah, it was strong.  It wanted to do something with █████████ but it didn’t want to kill him.  It could have pulled him back and crushed him with how strong it was.  No, it just wanted to catch up.  Like it had something to say.
> 
> **Dr. Nelson:** Do you have anything else for the record D-33847?
> 
> //Note: The initial files received by the foundation did not include anything beyond this point.  The rest of the file was recovered later//
> 
> **D-33847:** Yah, actually.  I got to thinking about something Doc ██████ said after the exploration.  Air can’t get through the barrier right?  Could it be that whatever that thing was is trapped in there?

> **Dr. Nelson:** I heard some interesting things from D-33847 about the exploration.  You were the one who was, quote “attacked”, correct?
> 
> **D-65440:** Yah.
> 
> **Dr. Nelson:** Is there something on your mind D-65440?
> 
> **D-65440:** No, just thought this would be a safe thing to volunteer for.  Explore a jungle; seemed perfectly safe.
> 
> **Dr. Nelson:** I see.  Well, could you describe SCP-3173-1 as well as the incident to me?
> 
> **D-65440:** Ain’t much to say you can’t find on the video.  Some massive fart came out of the trees and grabbed me when we ran.  It was strong for a fart but we got away from it.
> 
> **Dr. Nelson:** I see.  Well your colleague described the incident, as “not hostile” saying that it seemed like the entity only wanted to catch up.  Would you agree?

> **D-65440:** I don’t know, all I know is it grabbed my ankle, and I’m never going back into that jungle.  I got nothing else to say.

> 
> **Dr. Nelson:** Yes, I am receiving all 5 video feeds

> **W8-5:** Alright, let's go check out this “angry fart”
> 
> **Dr. Nelson:** This isn’t to be taken as a joke W8-5, we don’t know what 3173-1 is capable of.  Now; proceed into the barrier with caution.
> 
> **W8-1:** Alright, guys let’s move.  Oh, and happy new year Doc.
> 
> **Dr. Nelson:** Thank you…  As you move in make sure you keep your eyes open.  3173-1 is difficult to see.
> 
> //W-8 passes through the barrier.  The hold their rifles down, having been informed that the entity is not likely to be damaged by bullet fire.  They are there to investigate as they are more reliable than D-Class//
> 
> **W8-1:** Anyone got eyes yet?
> 
> **W8-2:** Nothing yet.  The fog is limiting vision to about 4 meters.
> 
> **W8-4:** Thermal isn’t picking anything up either.  It seems to have the same body temperature as the surrounding air
> 
> **W8-3:** Assuming it’s still here.
> 
> **Dr. Nelson:** We have no reason to believe it left.  I’m almost certain it’s still there.
> 
> //13 minutes of extraneous dialogue and footage have been cut from the log//
> 
> //W8-4 walks into a clearing, stopping suddenly//
> 
> **W8-4:** [quietly] Hey doc, I found your fart.
> 
> **Dr. Nelson:** Are you sure?  I can’t make anything out.
> 
> **W8-4:** It’s just like the D Boy described it.  Like the air above a fire.
> 
> **W8-1:** Alright Librarians, report to W8-4’s location.
> 
> **W8-4:** It’s in a clearing ahead of me.  Don’t go into the clearing; it seems to not know we are here.
> 
> //W8-4’s camera picks up the clearing with no movement, save for a shimmer in the air directly in the center.  The thick fog obstructs vision of the opposite end of the open area.  After 2 minutes, the rest of W-8 arrives at W8-4’s location.//
> 
> **Dr. Nelson:** I still don’t have vision of 3173-1.  I believe the fog is interfering too much with line of sight.  See if you can get closer without alerting it.
> 
> **W8-4:** Alright, I’ll see.
> 
> //W8-4 moves out of the forested area.  She moves forwards for about 7 seconds before a sudden movement can be seen directly ahead of the camera.  The fog disperses, and briefly, 3173-1 can be seen.  It appears shapeless, and is only distinct from the air around it by its aforementioned shimmer, and the way it moves.  It moves forwards towards W8-4 before she turns around and runs back towards W-8//
> 
> **W8-4:** Shit!  Here it comes!
> 
> **W8-1:** Everyone, away from it!
> 
> //W8-1 fires his rifle at the entity, after which it shoots downwards and isn’t visible on the camera feed//
> 
> **W8-5:** Haha!  Scared that fart straight!
> 
> **W8-1:** Doc, 3173-1 appears to have vanished into the shrubbery.
> 
> **Dr. Nelson:** Keep your eyes out and cameras moving, it has to still be nearby.
> 
> **W8-4:** I can’t see it Doc.
> 
> **Dr. Nelson:** He has to be around here somewhere, keep looking.
> 
> //2 minutes pass without anyone saying anything, scanning the area for 3173-1//
> 
> **W8-2:** Alright, we can’t find it.  Must have frightened it.
> 
> **Dr. Nelson:** Ok, return to camp and we can review the footage.
> 
> //The 5 MTF units move in a singular direction until they begin to approach the border of the forest.  As they get near the edge of the forest, W8-1 signals his team to stop.//
> 
> **W8-1:** Wait, hold up Librarians
> 
> //W-8 stops moving suddenly and looks at their leader.//
> 
> **Dr. Nelson:** What’s the issue Whiskey One?
> 
> **W8-1:** Gas can’t move outside of the barrier, correct?
> 
> **Dr. Nelson:** What are you suggesting?
> 
> **W8-1:** But we don’t lose our breath when entering 3173.  Or leaving.
>
> //There is a slight pause as W-8 begins to think about what W8-1 said.  After a moment, W8-4 runs towards the barrier.  W8-4 makes it 6 meters from the barrier before W8-1 fires 4 rounds into her legs//
> 
> **Dr. Nelson:** What are you doing! 
> 
> **W8-1:** SCP-3173-1 vanished suddenly.  I assumed he entered the respiratory system of one of our troops.
> 
> **W8-4:** Close.
> 
> **Dr. Nelson:** Wait.. that’s incredible, SCP-3173-1 appears to be capable of taking over the functions of a host through the respiratory system.
> 
> **W8-1:** Gawk later Doc, we can’t let 3173-1 get out of the barrier.  We have to stop a potential breach from happening.
> 
> **W8-4:** Breach.
> 
> //W8-4 continues to crawl towards the barrier, despite her legs being disabled.  W8-1 warns her multiple times to stop, threatening to shoot her.  She comes within 2 meters of the barrier, and W8-1 shoots her in the head, presumably killing her instantly.  The rest of W-8 looks away.  There is a short pause in radio chatter.//  
> 
> **Dr. Nelson:** You did what you had to W8-1.  Now get out of there.
> 
> **W8-3:** I don’t think that’ll be easy.  3173-1 is still there.
> 
> **W8-2:** It’s 4 or 5 meters ahead
> 
> **W8-1:** Don’t let it near you, we don’t know how long it takes to-- shit it moved!
> 
> //W-8 backs up from the location of W8-4’s corpse.  There is another momentary pause where nothing is heard//
> 
> **W8-2:** Fuck, d’ya think it’s still there?
> 
> **W8-1:** Doubtlessly, it could have already possessed one of us.
> 
> **W8-5:** Don’t think that fart touched me.
> 
> **W8-3:** And me makes 4, we can all talk as normal.
> 
> **W8-5:** Alright are we clear to go?
> 
> **W8-1:** No, I don’t trust that, I’m sure one of us is possessed.  3173-1 wouldn’t just vanish, I’m sure of that.  It displayed some level of sapiance, and it has us fenced off.  
> 
> **Dr. Nelson:** I’m going to contact command, see what they can do
> 
> **W8-1:** It’s not worth our time, if 3173-1 can simulate our speech it can use a gun
> 
> **W8-3:** What are you saying One?  It doesn’t make logical sense.  How could 3173-1 learn how we function so fast
> 
> **Dr. Nelson:** It learned how to control W8-4’s motor functions in a matter of seconds.  I’m sure it has some kind of ability to connect to the brain.  The respiratory system sends oxygen into the blood and all over the body.  It would only take a few moments to reach the brain with how high your heart rates are right now.
> 
> **W8-1:** It could have access to our memories by now.
> 
> **W8-5:** Hey, no farts touched me, I smelt nothing
> 
> **W8-2:** Why’d’ya keep calling it a fart man?  That’ll only piss it off, and it already seems angry
> 
> //W8-5 raises his rifle up to W8-2, who raises his hands.//
> 
> **W8-1:** Calm down, put the fucking rifle down Five.
> 
> **W8-5:** He’s defending the damn thing, it’s gotta be him.  My gut’s telling me that I can’t trust that.
> 
> **W8-1:** And by shooting first, if you are innocent, you just thin out our numbers and play into his hands.  We don’t know how the Skip thinks.  For all we know it’s W8-3 because he’s been too quiet so put the fucking rifle down.
> 
> **W8-5:** Alright, fine, I just think tha-
> 
> //W8-2 suddenly raises his rifle and shoots W8-5 in the forehead.  He falls backwards and stops moving, presumably died instantly.  He turns to shoot W8-1, who already has his rifle aimed back.  W8-1 fires first, firing a total of 5 rounds into W8-2.  W8-2 crumples to the ground, and curtly the distorted air synonymous with SCP-3173-1 rises from the corpse.//
> 
> **W8-1:** Run.
> 
> //The two remaining MTF units sprint towards the wall, as away from 3173-1 as they can.  The entity is much slower than the two MTF, and fails to catch them.  They reach the wall.  The mic inputs for 3 minutes is exclusively heavy breathing.  Afterwards, W8-1 begins to cry.//

> **Site-██, Light Containment**
> **7:22 PM:** Dr. Nelson walks past Dr. G████,  the two stagger for a second.  Dr. Nelson then proceeds to leave the building.
> **7:56 PM:** Dr. G████ enters the observation deck for SCP-████ at Site-██.  He sits down in an empty chair.  After a few moments, the head researcher, Dr, H█████ nearly falls over.  The other observers attempt to interact with him afterwards but he waves them down
> **11:03 PM:** Shortly after the finished observation of SCP-████, Dr H█████, instead of retiring to his quarters, simply retrieves his Keycard and heads back into the facility.
> **11:58 PM:** Dr. H█████ uses his keycard to enter the on site generator room.

> //11/5/20██.//
> //SCP-3173-1 is imprisoned behind that barrier.  I don’t know what put him back there, but I need to do more research.  I thought this SCP assignment would be boring and pointless, but I may have found a way to get back at the foundation.  Secure Contain Protect my ass, the people who run this place are the real monsters that we contain, and I need to make sure the whole world knows it.  I need another exploration though, to see what this thing can do.//
> 
> //1/1/20██.//
> //It appears that SCP-3173-1 not only imprisoned as I previously speculated, but sapient.  My theories that --he--the entity wants to be free from the forest are totally true as well.  As far as I know, we did not imprison it, but, we are its current captors.  The area it is in is clearly designed to hold it, as there is no other feasible reason it would be in there.  It knows how to escape, and I know how to let it out, but I had to send the exploration logs to command.  It would have been hard enough to get away with holding that information since 3 MTF Units died but I could have done it, but W8-1 refusing the amnestics means there is a witness besides myself to the incident.  I’ll have to wait until the commotion dies down.  I understand the pain of the creature, and I can set it free.  We can both get what we want.  I simply have to wait until their attention is off of him.  From there, it’ll be easy//
> 
> //1/13/20██//
> //They are forcing my hand.  Command decided that I’m not fit to handle this SCP, since it could be dangerous.  If it were to possess someone within the foundation, the damage it could do would be irreparable, and since I was only assigned here because they were hoping to categorize this thing as Safe, they’re moving me.  3173-1 needs to be let out now, and I intend to let him out.  Equipped with my memories, he should be able to destroy the foundation undetected.  I will be terminated, but it will well worth it in the end.  I speculate that SCP-3173-1 gains the knowledge and traits of everyone he possesses, meaning that if I allow him to enter a scientist with 04-access, he’ll be able to cause havoc.  I’m going to be the one to set him on that path.//

> //I understand that some of you are wondering how SCP-3173-1 breached containment in the first place.  For anyone who understands the situation surrounding the SCP, you understand that someone most likely intentionally let it out.  This is true.  The foundation took an excessive amount of time to work out the kinks in the leadership of the team investigating SCP-3173, and it allowed a vengeful scientist who had been demoted to Level-2 clearance for questioning and acting against the wishes of command to access something dangerous.  What we as a foundation have learned is that the slack surrounding the paperwork for this SCP almost caused an immense breach, and it’s due to a series of coincidences that we avoided catastrophe.  We are working with the file keeping department to streamline such essential actions, to avoid something like this happening again.//
