* [[[SCP-011-J]]] ("The Baby") - Where's the anomaly... there he is! Where's the anomaly... there he is! [[*user DomeAcolyte]] is currently busy playing peek-a-boo with the anomaly.

++++ Tales

Written by [[*user rumetzen]].

++++ Author Pages

* [[[j-cooper-s-personnel-file|The Personnel File of Joseph Cooper]]] - [[*user Choiwel]]'s author page! Joseph Cooper is an extremely lucky man, if you ask me.

+++ Week of March 8th

Not too many articles this week, but a good haul nonetheless. Hopefully you'll be entertained, for WAN.

++++ SCPs

* [[[SCP-2246]]] ("You Set the Scene") - A writer sits in their nothingness, toiling away at story after story. An activity once done for a friend is now subject to strangers, and that's more terrifying than any other possibility. Written by [[*user Decibelles]].

++++ Tales

* [[[Basic Observations]]] - As many continue to die as a result of forces unknown, a council meets and deliberates on how to best take action. But even amongst the Church, there's no sure answer. Trouble may be brewing... Written by [[*user SunnyClockwork]].

* [[[univine-s-author-page|Univine's Author Page]]] - [[*user Univine]]'s author page! It only occurred to me now that this guy really likes writing good history skips. And on a side-note, collegiate quizbowl sounds fun as heck.

++++ Misc.

* [[[Sarkicism Hub]]] - Ultimately, it is feared that the Foundation and GOC know only a fraction of what Sarkicism entails and what its followers intend. Based on available information, the speculated goals of Sarkic cults nevertheless represent an SK-class dominance shift, including the possibility of an XK-class end-of-the-word scenario. Compiled, at last, by [[*user Metaphysician]].

+++ Week of March 15th

I heard that The Broken God and the Reverse Cyborg were making out. It was pretty sickly sweet, and gross.

++++ SCPs

* [[[twistedgears-kaktus-proposal|SCP-001]]] ("The Broken God") - Lo, and I saw there upon the hills the wrath of the MEKHANE, the machine that will devour the world. The earth beneath our feet was torn asunder by its fists, the skies, the skies were blackened by its breath, and our ears were filled with the echo of its hate. He who was Broken has been undone, and the universe shall be reforged in his image. Brought to life by [[*user TwistedGears]] and [[*user djkaktus]].
* [[[SCP-1595-J]]] ("Sweethearts") - God, what disgustingly sweet romantic partners. This is gross. Who even says things like "It's like the mosquito of passion that buzzes in my ear!"! Written by [[*user TimmyTim]].

* [[[keter-cleanup-duty|...Keter: Cleanup Duty]]] - It's a very long day for Thackery. Between a messy [DATA EXPUNGED], a secret meeting, and a robotic blank avatar, there's no catching a break. Written by [[*user Jekeled]].

+++ Fandom Stuff

What's been going on in the community aside from our site? Well...

* Over in Japan, a company known as Roll&Role Books has made an RPG book based on our work! It's currently being sold, and the licensing checks out fine. You can check it out [http://www.shinkigensha.co.jp/book/978-4-7753-1410-4/ here].
* [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc9laXXW8wVp5nH5zo0DOvg TheHauntedReader] has done a pretty good job reading [[[Experiment Log 455]]], capturing both the creepiness and the occasional bits of humor relief that come through in the article. You can listen [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpcq0l5HeTI here]! This guy, in general, has done a lot of good SCP readings, which I highly recommend.
* [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWMybbiNZwNOhCXEzROahtw Tats TopVideos] has done a number of solid Top Lists videos, including a couple on the Foundation itself. And now they've done a new video on the Foundation! Check out their take on the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2cvmkyS2iI Top 18 Building SCPs]; there may even be a few ones you haven't discovered before.

++++ Fanart

* What better way to kick off this fanart section than with one of the most awe-inspiring works of SCP-682 that I've seen yet? [http://otkman1995.deviantart.com/ OTKMan1995] brings us [http://otkman1995.deviantart.com/art/They-were-disgusting-594797126 this art] of 682 in all of its disgusting, huge, monstrous glory. No wonder its so hard to contain!
* Let's diverge into silliness, with [http://dewery2539.deviantart.com/ dewery2539]'s fanart of SCP-105 and [http://scp-th.wikidot.com/scp-777-th-j SCP-777-TH-J], a pretty good joke article on one of the other branches! The fanart is [http://dewery2539.deviantart.com/art/SCP-777-TH-J-SCP-105-599259606 here]. I just hope neither of them are getting DUIs.
* Speaking of silly, [https://twitter.com/TORI_UMA505 TORIギョーザ] brings us this [https://twitter.com/TORI_UMA505/status/709357703676567552 nice drawing] of Dr. Roget, Dr. Django Bridge, and Research Assistant Corbette in their downtime on the job. All the goofballs together in one shot.
* Quickly diverging over to PIXIV, [http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=6463194 華氏４５１] has a [http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=56031289 photo album][[footnote]]NSFW for blood/injuries and partial nudity.[[/footnote]] chock full of neat drawings! Some highlights include: a wounded Dr. Gerald with [http://ja.scp-wiki.net/scp-040-jp SCP-040-JP], Clef and 173 [[[date-night|staring into each other's eyes]]], and a super-suave 049.
* [http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=281414 雨見鶏] brings us an image absolutely filled of various SCPs [http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=56112209 hanging out] in a room together! Can you guess all the SCPs without clicking the read more?
* To round out March's fanart section, let's look at [http://alishmcmalish.deviantart.com/ AlishmcMalish]'s playing cards! Cards seem to be a popular fit with SCP, wouldn't you agree? The works highlighted in particular (since I couldn't just pick one) are of [http://alishmcmalish.deviantart.com/art/SCP-1440-599870845 SCP-1440] as the king and [http://alishmcmalish.deviantart.com/art/SCP-085-600041111 SCP-085] as the queen. Pretty fitting if you ask me :)

------

Thanks for tuning in again, folks! I tried something a bit different since this is the first edition with an ongoing tale series for that month (and March had two!). Let me know if this approach works, or if it should be formatted differently for ease of reading.

As a side-note, I won't be around to do April's edition, so if you wish to send blurbs for your articles that month, send a PM to [[*user rumetzen]]. Thank you all for continuing to be an excellent community <3
