**Item #:** SCP-454

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-454 should be kept in a plastic bag, with a thin piece of cardstock. It is important for this cardstock to be acid free. It can then be contained with standard procedures. Seeing a photograph of the item will not be enough for a subject to attempt to obtain it, and it has not expressed any levels of physiological effects in the needs of “wanting” to be read, provided the subject has not seen the interior. There will be a mild desire to read the item, but it is suppressed through normal human psychological response, and is no greater than wanting to see any other interesting item. 

**Description:** SCP-454 is a comic book, with the title, “The Crypt of Terror!” The front cover has the picture of a female, nervously looking around, with a shadowy figure some distance behind her. The price is listed as ten cents, and the issue number is seventeen. There is slight damage from age and normal wear, but it is not extensive. Although the cover mentions a werewolf, there is no reference to that inside. 

The interior story of the comic is about, as far as researchers are able to deduce, a story of a woman being stalked by a mysterious force. Her name is Julia and the force only is referred to as “Him” by Julia in the comic. After a long trial of trying to escape “Him”, Julia finally believes to have bested it, only for it to [DATA EXPUNGED]. There are also a number of advertisements on the first and last page. These are normal for comics of the era, the 1950s, and seem to have no effect on subjects. 

If a subject who shows normal levels of empathy begins to read the comic, they will become more and more interested in it, expressing fear, relief and finally horror when the story ends. Their psychological state has been described as excessive denial and depression once it ends. After reading the comic, the subjects will begin to think and talk about how they need to save Julia from “Him”. Given time alone, with materials, the subjects will begin to write or draw continuations of the story, in an effort to provide a continuation where Julia will survive. Each of these efforts will end with Julia dead as before, however, and in the event that a subject should make Julia survive, if though Deus ex Machina or similar efforts, will cause them to throw away their effort, saying that it doesn’t fit into the story. 

These efforts will continue, and take up more of the subject’s time and effort. Their psychological state will continue to decline, until one of two events occurs.  They self-terminate out of depression, and an apparent sense of having failed Julia, which is implied from the notes left behind, which all allude to the sense of failure. 

The second event that may occur will be that the subject will write themselves into the story, and, from the notes and scraps left behind, they claimed to have found the perfect way, which they themselves could save Julia. The subjects that claim this have been found [DATA EXPUNGED]. This will occur in approximately 20% of subjects. 

In the case that the subject has a lack of empathy or a psychological hatred of women, there will be no effect on their psychology and will show no interest in the comic or the characters after reading.  


**Addendum:** In an experiment involving a D-Class with normal levels of empathy, they were instructed read the comic and was placed in isolation. After ██ attempts, one subject claimed to have found a way to save Julia. He was found dead with [DATA EXPUNGED]. The camera watching his room suffered from electrical disturbances during the event, in which a figure was seen briefly standing in the room. No signs of entry were seen. the security team was placed on probation.
