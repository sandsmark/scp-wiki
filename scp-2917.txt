**Item #:** SCP-2917

**Object Class:** --Safe-- Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Because SCP-2917 cannot be moved, Site-37 has been constructed around it. Any personnel found to have accidentally traveled through SCP-2917 are not to be followed under any circumstances, and any attempts at communication with such personnel must be through radio or other indirect means.

After relocation event 2917-315, no fewer than three armed security guards are to be kept onsite.


**Description:** SCP-2917 is a phenomenon affecting a spherical area with a radius of two meters, at a fixed location in [REDACTED], roughly 1.5 meters above the ground. Light or any solid objects making contact with the edge of the anomaly will be transported to a celestial body --devoid of life--[[footnote]]Description amended after relocation event 2917-315.[[/footnote]] outside of our Solar System. Gases and liquids cannot traverse the boundary unassisted[[footnote]]Fluids can be carried across the SCP-2917 boundary within a container. See tests E and F for details.[[/footnote]], ensuring constant atmospheric pressure on both connected planets. Exploration is made difficult by the tendency of SCP-2917 to relocate - once every four hours, the anomaly closes, and reopens 0.1 seconds later to a different planet. Relocation events are also triggered when two objects traverse its borders within this four-hour interval.
Functionally, SCP-2917 resembles a traversable Einstein-Rosen Bridge, or wormhole, although the properties that decide where in the galaxy the anomaly manifests, as well as how it maintains it's continued presence on Earth, are currently unknown.
Since its discovery, SCP-2917 has connected with ███ different celestial bodies across the Milky Way Galaxy, with the furthest being nearly 3000LY away and the nearest being roughly 50LY from Earth. Furthermore, SCP-2917 has never connected to a single body more than once.

**Addendum:** SCP-2917 Test Log
//Some tests have been omitted from this file for brevity. The full list can be found within file #2917-E, where all further testing will be recorded.//

**Test A - 06/24/19██**
> **Subject:** One (1)  Class D, D-4672, equipped with a standard Environmental Protection suit.
> **Destination:** A grey, rocky moon without an atmosphere, orbiting a maroon gas giant visible in the sky. Analysis of stars suggests a location 50LY from Earth. 
> **Log:** D-4672 crosses the SCP-2917 boundary uneventfully, and walks several hundred meters into the distance. D-4672 is ordered to return to Earth, and complies. His crossing the boundary on the return trip triggers a relocation event (Event 2917-12), and SCP-2917 closes.
> **Analysis:** The exact criteria for triggering a relocation event is currently under investigation.

**Test B - 06/25/19██**
> **Subject:** Two (2)  Class D personnel, D-4672 and D-9823, equipped with a standard Environmental Protection suit, in order to determine the cause of relocation events.
> **Destination:** This planet's surface consists of a large, flat expanse of igneous rock, pockmarked with pale yellow, roughly circular patches. Atmosphere consists mostly of a thick, yellow fog with little visibility. No stellar analysis is possible due to the density of this atmosphere.
> **Log:** D-4672 crosses the SCP-2917 boundary uneventfully. Shortly thereafter, D-9823 is ordered to follow D-4672 through the anomaly. A relocation event is triggered (Event 2917-21), and contact is lost with both personnel.
> **Analysis:** Expeditions not related to testing the trigger for a relocation event are to be limited to single individuals. Containment procedures have been amended.

**Test C - 06/25/19██**
> **Subject:** Two (2)  Class D personnel, D-3612 and D-6524, equipped with a standard Environmental Protection suit. To further establish the causes of relocation events, the two D-Class are connected by a tether.
> **Destination:** A dark sky and landscape with no stars visible. It is thought that this planet is situated within a dark nebula, such as the Coalsack Nebula.
> **Log:** D-6524 is able to cross the boundary successfully, but the anomaly closes around D-3612's end of the tether before he is able to cross, in relocation event 2917-32. Contact with D-6524 is lost.
> **Analysis:** The tether was considered to be a second object. Further testing is recommended.

**Test D - 06/26/19██**
> **Subject:** A sealed 30cm container, with a 10cm rubber ball contained within.
> **Destination:** An icy world, with a frozen surface crisscrossed by deep-blue canyons. Two suns are seen in the pale orange sky. No stellar analysis possible due to time of day.
> **Log:** The container is launched through SCP-2917. Upon crossing its barrier, no relocation event was triggered. A second rubber ball was then launched through the anomaly to trigger relocation event 2917-33, readying SCP-2917 for another test.
> **Analysis:** Testing implies that objects in containers only count as single objects for the purposes of creating relocation events.

**Test E - 06/26/19██**
> **Subject:** A stream of water aimed at the anomaly to observe its response to liquid substances.
> **Destination:** A jagged, blood-red landscape, with no atmosphere. A red giant star looms in the sky, occupying 10 degrees in angular size. Stellar analysis places this planet at roughly 400LY from Earth, near the Pleiades nebula.
> **Log:** The hose is activated and a jet of water is fired at SCP-2917. Rather than passing through its surface, the water is deflected by the anomaly as though it had made contact with a solid sphere.
> **Analysis:** Liquids do not seem to pass through SCP-2917. Further testing is recommended.

**Test F - 06/26/19██**
> **Subject:** A sealed 30cm container, with 50mL of water contained within.
> **Destination:** As no relocation event was triggered in the previous test, and no solid objects crossed the SCP-2917 barrier, the destination is unchanged.
> **Log:** The container is successfully launched through SCP-2917. Upon crossing its barrier, no relocation event was triggered.
> **Analysis:** Liquids can pass through SCP-2917 without incident if contained within a solid envelope.

**Test M - 8/12/19██**
> **Subject:** One (1)  Class D, D-9572, equipped with a standard Environmental Protection suit.
> **Destination:** Unlike the barren surface of all previous locations, this world sustains life - the anomaly opens to a forest filled with 20-30m blue and orange bioluminescent organisms superficially resembling trees. It is nighttime, and Barnard's Loop is visible in the sky, with an angular diameter of ~30 degrees. 
> **Log:** D-9572 is ordered to move through SCP-2917, and complies with some hesitation. D-9572 begins moving between the "trees" with orders to locate high ground and survey the area. After ~30 minutes of travel, with no noticeable change in elevation or terrain grade, D-9572 is ordered to climb one of the "trees" that surround him. Upon reaching the highest stable point he can reach, D-9572 reports that there is no noticable variation in terrain, or change in elevation, for the entire distance to the horizon. It is at this point that researchers on Earth notice a disturbance in the forest - followed shortly by the arrival of five cephalopod-like organisms. The organisms approached SCP-2917, and appeared to charge at the researchers visible through it. A single creature traveled through the anomaly, triggering relocation event 2917-315. D-9572 is left behind, and contact is lost.
> **Analysis:** The animal that penetrated SCP-2917 was incapable of breathing air on Earth, and quickly asphyxiated. Its dissection revealed similar body chemistry and organ structures to reptilian lifeforms, rather than the cephalopods it superficially resembled. Given the potential for a breach were a larger or more dangerous animal to exit the anomaly, containment procedures have been amended, and SCP-2917 has been upgraded to Euclid status.
