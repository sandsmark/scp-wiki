**Secure Containment Procedures**: Physical evidence supporting the existence of the events of SCP-5135 are to be secured and archived. People claiming to remember any events associated with SCP-5135 are to be administered Amnestics and, pending brief psychological review, released without further incident.

The area containing SCP-5135-1 is to be secured with a 1 km radius exclusion area inside the Golden Gate National Recreation Area marked with physical security, fencing, and security personnel. SCP-5135-1 itself is to be sealed inside a 10m x 10m sarcophagus with cement walls no less than .5m in thickness There is to be no door into the container. //Note:// This sarcophagus is meant to protect SCP-XXX-1 from exterior forces; it will offer no mitigation of destructive impact in the event of detonation.

**Description**: SCP-5135 is a global-scale armed conflict which did not occur between 2009 and 2017, for which evidence exists that it did. This evidence, which consists of documents, radio signals, photographs, and fragments of digital data such as images and communications, has been recovered intermittently since 2011. It is theorized that this evidence is an anomalous manifestation of an alternate, parallel timeline (See Addendum Z)

While very little exists about the details of SCP-5135, some general information about the cause, context, and impact of the conflict has been learned through examination of the recovered data:


* SCP-5135 involves at least 4 global superpowers, of which two are The United States and People's Republic of China.
* SCP-5135 utilizes a high level of espionage and cyber warfare.
* The first physical military engagement on U.S. Soil occurred in 2010 and have occurred several times since then, as late as 2014.
* Widespread misinformation campaigns are integral to the strategies of at least the U.S. and one other belligerent.
* The conflict has included nuclear engagements since at least 2016.
* The Foundation may be involved.

SCP-5135-1 is an undetonated nuclear device. It is of a size and payload similar to The Soviet RDS-202 hydrogen bomb ("Tsar Bomba") tested on October 30, 1961. The casing is inscribed (See below). Its estimated yield is approximately 97 megatons.

> //Kau'ai, HI - 12/24/2012//
> //[indistinguishable], NC - 3/12/2016//
> //This one's for you//

SCP-5135-1 is locked in a temporal stasis field, and presently hovers 104.6cm above the ground. The source of this field is unknown, but is suspected to be caused by Foundation personnel or an equivalent in the SCP-5135 timeline. Measurements suggest that despite appearing still, SCP-5135-1 retains its momentum and kinetic energy; as such, any physical interaction with it may cause instant detonation.

[[Collapsible show="Addendum 1: Theorized timeline" hide="Close" hideLocation="both"]]

The following is a possible timeline of events for SCP-5135:

* **2008:** The United States sends Emergency relief supplies in response to the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Some of these supplies are contaminated with biological agents that cause a biological outbreak resulting in an unknown number of casualties.
* **Early 2009:** Chinese agents operating in the U.S. uncover that this contamination was intentional. China launches a military strike against the United States. Details and U.S. response unknown.
* **November 2009:** After escalated military engagements over the year, another nation joins the engagement with a military operation against China. The United States denies affiliation or alliance with this third nation.
* **2010:** Military troops arrive on the East Coast of the United States from another unknown nation. 
* **2011:** In a closed-door summit, members of the European Union express a desire for this conflict to end.
* **Summer 2012:** Military forces attack Hawaii, and set up a military installation on Kauaʻi. The U.S. Begins their siege of this installation.
* **December 24, 2012:** The United States bombs the installation on Kauaʻi, killing hundreds of military and civilians. The U.S. Considers this operation a success.
* **Early 2013:** The National Security Agency begins a disinformation campaign to quell growing US concerns after the bombing of U.S. Civilians.
* **March 2016:** a nuclear strike occurs on U.S. soil.
* **June 2016:** an aircraft with a nuclear payload in shot down over Italy by unknown aggressors, resulting in catastrophic loss of civilian life.

No evidence has been recovered regarding any events after this occurred. It is unclear if the war ended after this point, or the world devolved into a self-destructive nuclear conflict.
