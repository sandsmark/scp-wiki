I joined the SCP community back in August of 2014. I learned about it from a [[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOnB2fWQz0w |youtube video listing popular creepypastas]]]. I've wondered if I ever would have discovered the Foundation if not for that one video. The internet is vast, after all.

**First Attempts:**
Like most newbies, my first post was a failure. It was an SCP called the Polyocculus. It was a short scrawny humanoid whose skin was filled with holes like that of a Surinam Toad's. It would steal people's eyes and shove them into the holes because it was terrified of going blind. I was going for a little trypophobia and taking a common fear, fear of disability, and ramping it up to insane levels. It got deleted for being a horror movie monster.

Next was a little Fairy Statue that I called the Mneumonic Device that prevented amnestics from working within a mile. It got deleted as well. I had a few more ideas over the next couple of years that I at least had drafts for or got feedback on but never posted. There was a stupid tale about 096 that involved idiotic cross testing, a lolfoundation termination log for 096, and an anomalous copy of Nobody Poops But You that caused anyone who read it to believe exactly that, which was too silly for the mainlist but not silly enough for a -J.  

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/new-job |New Job:]]]**
I did not have a successful article until June of 2016, when I posted New Job. Honestly, this is just a silly headcanon I had and I'm surprised it's as highly rated as it is. It is currently my highest rated article (though it is neck and neck with [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3717 |SCP-3717]]] at the moment), but it has the benefit of being nine months older than anything else I've posted, so I wouldn't call it my best. I actually completely agree with most of the negative criticism the article has received. But as my first post, it was proof that I could create successful articles.

This now has a reading by TheeSherm, which you can find [[[https://youtu.be/o-ucpc59wtc |here]]].  

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/crunch-is-a-beautiful-sound |Crunch is a Beautiful Sound:]]]**
When I saw there was a 173 contest, I immediately wrote down my headcanon about it inside of a bare-bones framing device and cold posted it. Crunch is a Beautiful Sound was the result. I believe this is my most divisive article, since as of the time of this writing it has 42 votes and an aggregate score of 16.

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/osteotronic-cubes-vxy33-f7rq3-9xad1 |Osteotronic Cubes:]]]**
This was inspired by the tale [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/iris-dark |Iris Dark]]]. I just started wondering what happened after this tale, so I wrote an MC&D format piece about it. I was pleasantly surprised by how well this did.  

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-dark-web-dke79-o2rg5-4jlw6 |The Dark Web:]]]**
"What are you doing?" 
"A sequel."
"... I don't understand."
"Yeah me neither, but we pretty much nailed it the first time."

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/micky-d-s |Micky D's:]]]**
"Yeah, I'd like to get a 10-piece McNugget and a bunch of the Szechuan sauce. Like, as much as you're allowed to give me." In all seriousness, this was actually inspired by me seeing the letters McD on a McDonald's cup. 

**[[[Text Message in a Bottle | Text Message in a Bottle:]]]**
"It’s a bad phone. Chuck it. I downgraded to a clamshell for emergencies only." 
My piece for the [[[siabhub | dickbottle canon]]].

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/kaiju-caviar-ocn39-t5fg6-7hjl2 |Kaiju Caviar:]]]**
My MC&D format for Stormbreath's War on all Front's Canon.

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3903 |SCP-3903, Fata Morgana:]]]**
This is my first successful non-Herman Fuller SCP, and that was pretty much my motivation for writing it. I just thought that the Fata Morgana mirage was ripe for skipification, and the story developed from there.

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/document-3477-2 |Supplement SCP-3477-2:]]]**
This is my first and only supplement at the moment. I really loved stormbreath's scip [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/SCP-3477|SCP-3477]]], and I started compiling a list of all the different ways someone could live forever whenever I happened to think of them. When I had enough for all 34 instances of SCP-3477, I e-mailed stormbreath and asked if they'd be interested in a supplement page.

**[[[SCP-3806 |SCP-3806, I AM AWAITED IN VALHALLA!:]]]**
Inspired by the opening line of CGP Grey video, and named after a battlecry from Fury Road. 

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/habil-and-qabil |Habil and Qabil:]]]**
Just a weird idea I let sit around for over a year, and finally decided to post when DrMagnus posted an SCP/MLP crossover. That's right.

**[[[Utter Depravity | Utter Depravity:]]]**
A short mystery tale I made up on the fly for Jamcon2018. Gave me a chance to expand on the Utterly Bazaar a little bit and set up a D&C tale. First appearance of Ed of  Ed and Al's, as well as one of Metaphysicians's Aristocrats, which I love.

**[[[A Foul Storm in a Fair Land | A Foul Storm in a Fair Land:]]]**
Another Jamcon2018 entry. Like the first one, it probably never would have existed if not for the contest. I set it in the War on All Fronts Canon, detailing the final moments of Hy-brasil's King. I enjoy writting about the Fair Folk, and may produce other such works in the future.

**[[[SCP-3189 | SCP-3189, For The Man Who Has Everything:]]]**
Don't have much to say about this one. Basically, it's a wishing machine built by a sad wizard that Darke screwed over. 

**[[[Updated Amnestics Guide | Updated Amnestics Guide:]]]**
Exactly what it says on the tin. I never really like the original guide, so I wrote my own and decided to post it as an alternative head-canon. There's a tacked on narrative at the end because I felt obligated to do so, but I agree that the story's not the best. 

**[[[SCP-3277 | SCP-3277, Speak Softly And Carry A Big Stick:]]]**
Inspired by a walking stick I own, I decided to make an SCP about wizard staffs that are kind of crappy, and how MC&D could still make a buck off them.

**[[[The Kaiju Sea | The Kaiju Sea:]]]**
My First Serpent's Hand Format, written for Doomcon2018 as part of Team Mikasa.

**[[[SCP-3549 | SCP-3549, Sweet Medieval Bitcoin:]]]**
Another SCP based on my version of MC&D, and inspired by 049-J, or at least the image djkaktus links too in the author post. 

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/dread-circuses-hub |Dread & Circuses:]]]**
But of course, what I'm best known for is Dread & Circuses. I explain on the hub page why I started that series, so I don't think I'll repeat myself here. The first entry in this series was only my second successful post on this wiki, but over a relatively short time span I've generated a surprising number of successful chapters. I'm very grateful to PeppersGhost for creating Herman Fuller's Circus of the Disquieting, otherwise I may never have found such a niche.

[[include component:hf-book-right chapter=The Dread Behemoth |content="Who could forget the night that Dread Behemoth rose forth from the sea to wreak havoc on the fair and free city of Three Portlands? The dastardly Geo Sea had driven the beast there, happy to sacrifice a town of marvels to preserve their precious veil of normalcy. They probably figured the beast would do some of their own dirty work for them. Oh, it riles me up just thinking about it!

Never mind them now though. That's not what you came here to hear about. You want to know about the Dread Behemoth.

Let me tell you, the behemoth was a sight to behold, truly titanic in size. A hundred stories tall if it was a foot! It towered over the city, its foul shadow falling upon everything, eclipsing the sky and blocking out the stars themselves! Every stride it took caused earthquakes and tsunamis, its gargantuan feet leaving craters where they struck ground! The mere force of its wails was enough to topple skyscrapers!  

Men, women and children all wept and fled in mass pandemonium. The swift trampled the slow, cramming themselves into the Ways out of the city. Some succame to madness and took their own lives while others tried to swim out to sea, as though that could offer any refuge from such a menace. All had abandoned hope, for what force on Earth would dare oppose the nightmare that was the Dread Behemoth?

Herman Fuller! That's who! 

It was sheer chance I was there that day, I had an appointment with my haberdasher about expanding the storage capacity in my top hat, but what good fortune it was! I wasn't about to turn tail and run when so many innocent people were at risk of losing life and livelihood, hearth and home! If no one else was going to stop this beast, then I'd have to do it myself.  

Doing what I could to drum up my courage, I sized up my foe. He had a pound or two on me, it's true, it's true, but I had my wits! I knew I was no good getting stomped under its feet, so I made for higher ground. I climbed a fire escape to the top of the tallest building I could get to, and by then that was the last building left standing. 

From atop that lonely citadel, I gazed down the Dread Behemoth, and I swear to you friends he looked at me not with mere animal hunger but with contempt! Who was I to stand my ground against him when all others had fled? I would pay for my insolence dearly, I surely would. 

Or so he thought! One good look into his eyes was all I needed to know his true nature, and in those deep wells of cosmic time I saw that it was only his heart that was truly immortal, and without it, he would perish. It was then obvious what needed to be done; separate the beast from its heart. An impossible task you say? Herman Fuller doesn't know the meaning of the word impossible!

Drawing forth my twenty-foot harpoon, which I always carry on me for just such occasions, I aimed true and thrust it directly into the Behemoth's chest. Fortunately, my knowledge of Eldritch anatomy was spot on and I pierced the beast's undying heart. With a mighty pull, I freed the heart from the monster's ribcage, and it was immortal no longer.

The Behemoth was dead before it hit the ground, but at the very least it left a magnificent corpse. I, however, had no use for a megaton of squid meat, so I left it be. I kept only the Heart of the Ocean as my trophy, which I proudly present to you today as proof of my extraordinary heroism." 

~ Yeah, literally none of that's true. We were nowhere near Three Portlands that day, and believe me, if we were Herman would have apportated us out in a heartbeat. The Heart of the Ocean is just a whale's heart he keeps pumping with a little granola sarkicism. It's kind of boring actually.

**Item #:** SCP-4000

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** In the event that SCP-4000 is encountered by Foundation field personnel in the southern forest of Nexus 0018, they are not to interact with it unless ordered to do so by Site-87 Command. Expedition teams sent to study SCP-4000 should consist of a minimum of four agents, with no individual being left alone for any prolonged period of time. Personnel sent to investigate SCP-4000 should be rated at a minimum of 72 on the Memetic Resistance Index.

Foundation staff within Nexus 0018 are to avoid any non-essential conversation regarding SCP-4000, as SCP-4000 is believed to draw power from human narratives. Civilian residents of Nexus 0018 are also to be cautioned against creating or circulating narratives surrounding SCP-4000.

**Description:** SCP-4000 is a sinkhole of indeterminate depth located within Sloth's Forest of [[[the s c plastics hub | Sloth's Pit, Wisconsin]]] //(Nexus 0018)//. It has been measured to be 30.48 meters wide[[footnote]]Confirming local folklore that the pit is exactly 100 feet across.[[/footnote]], and possesses a single wooden step in front of it[[footnote]]In all known encounters, individuals have discovered SCP-4000 from an orientation where the step was directly in front of them. [[/footnote]]. SCP-4000's precise location is not known, but it has yet to be determined if this is because it actually translocates or is merely a pretermemetic effect of the anomaly. According to the folklore of Nx-18, the same person can never find it twice. This has been substantiated by Foundation expeditions into Sloth's Forest. None of the agents who discovered SCP-4000 were able to do so again upon subsequent visits, nor were they able to call additional personnel to their location. GPS signals and radio tracking were unable to provide precise locations, and nearby personnel were unable to hone in on the discoverer's voice, claiming it seemed to come from all directions. As Nx-18's primary anomaly is manifesting narratives circulated within its area of effect[[footnote]] Primarily by altering the laws of probability to conform to narrative norms and generating thoughtform entities.[[/footnote]], the folklore surrounding SCP-4000 is believed to be a significant factor in the Foundation's inability to locate it.

Drone exploration of SCP-4000 has proven infeasible, as radio signals fail to travel more than 30 meters into the sinkhole, and fully automated drones have failed to return. Estimating the depth of SCP-4000 with laser rangefinders, as well as with less sophisticated methods, has also proved inconclusive. Folklore regarding UAE Chapman-341 (The Goatman) claims that it was once led into SCP-4000 in an attempt to neutralize it, but climbed back out after two days. Even if this is true, it is most likely a pataphysical manifestation of Sloth's Pit folklore, and does not necessarily apply to any entity other than UAE Chapman-341.

Both Foundation personnel and Nexus 0018 residents who have encountered SCP-4000 have reported the ambient sound dropping to near zero with barely audible whispers emanating from the sinkhole, as well as a noticeable sense of derealization, typically described as feeling like 'they're in a scene from a horror movie'. Viewing SCP-4000 from the sides will reveal nothing but darkness. However, viewing it from the front step has produced a variety of results (see exploration log).

According to historical records, SCP-4000 was formed on Christmas Day, 1890, beneath the mansion of Jackson Sloth[[footnote]] Founder of Sloth's Pit, originally named by him as New Toronto. [[/footnote]]. The dwelling was completely consumed, along with Jackson Sloth, his wife Imogen, and their son Jasper. In addition to being the first major anomaly to occur in Sloth's Pit, the onset of anomalous phenomena that eventually led to the town being classified as Nexus 0018 was observed to begin immediately after SCP-4000 first manifested. It has thus been speculated that SCP-4000 may be an epicenter of pataphysical effects responsible for transforming Sloth's Pit into a Nexus.

**Addendum, Exploration Logs:**

> **Agent Tofflemire:** "In this land of ours, there are many great pits, but none more bottomless than the bottomless pit, which as you can see here is bottomless."
> 
> **Carol:** Dude, quote cartoons on your own time. This is serious.
> 
> **Tofflemire**: I actually think this is more of a working vacation, but if you want to suck all the fun out of it just to please the Overseers, that's your hang up.
> 
> **Carol:** Ugh. For the record, we are Agents Alison Carol and Robert Tofflemire of Mobile Task Force Sigma 10 -
> 
> **Tofflemire:** We're the Alice and Bob that get mentioned so often in thought experiments.
> 
> **Carol:** - And we have successfully discovered SCP-4000.
> 
> **Tofflemire:** This is actually Sloth's Pit! The town of Sloth's Pit was named after this hole!
> 
> **Carol:** As with previous encounters with this anomaly, neither our GPS or comm units can give us a location any more specific than Sloth's Forest. Robert tried shouting at the top of his lungs for a few minutes, but we got no response from the rest of our squad.
> 
> //(Note: Squad members present in the area at the time did report hearing Agent Tofflemire's shouts. He did not respond to their shouts back, however)//
> 
> **Tofflemire:** Yeah, this whole place got eerily quiet as soon as we saw the pit. No birds, insects, leaves rustling, nothing.
> 
> //(Note: The camera records typical ambient noise for a wooded location, including the distant shouting of Sigma-10 squad members)//
> 
> **Carol:** That's consistent with previous encounters. Also consistent with previous encounters is how surreal all this feels. I feel a bit like I'm having a lucid dream, or that I'm in a story.
> 
> **Tofflemire:** Which officially makes us forth wall breakers. We're the SCP Foundation's version of Deadpool.
> 
> **Carol:** Robert, if you don't start acting like we're standing right in front of an uncontained Keter I'll have you shining hodag eggs for the next month! //(clears throat)// We have been equipped with basic camping gear and supplies, with enough food to last a couple weeks. Our primary mission is to stakeout SCP-4000 and see if it translocates while we're still here. We will be sleeping in shifts, and will not be leaving visible range of SCP-4000 for the next two weeks.

> **Tofflemire:** Come over here so they can get a good view into the pit.
> 
> //(Agent Carol walks to the edge of SCP-4000, and points the camera downwards. It appears to be a naturally occurring shaft in the earth of indeterminable depth, with no obvious abnormalities)//
> 
> **Carol:** Not much to see, unless you guys are seeing something different than we are, but from here it just looks like a big pit.
> 
> **Tofflemire:** I hear kind of an echoey whisper sound coming out of it too. Do you hear that Alice?
> 
> **Carol:** I do. It kind of sounds like there's a wind down there, and the wind is trying to speak.
> 
> //(Note: The camera's audio does not pick up anything)//
> 
> **Tofflemire:** Do you want to try looking from the front step? The townfolk say you'll see your worst nightmare.
> 
> **Carol:** We might as well. You go first.
> 
> //(Agent Tofflemire stands upon the step and stares into SCP-4000. His face pales noticeably)//
> 
> **Carol:** See anything?
> 
> **Tofflemire**: Yeah. A buddy of mine got dragged into the Old Man's lair about six years ago. He's still alive in there.
> 
> **Carol:** Robert, step away now.
> 
> //(Agent Tofflemire complies)//
> 
> **Carol:** I'm sure that wasn't real. How would it know, anyway?
> 
> **Tofflemire:** Yeah, yeah. Ah, do you still want to...
> 
> **Carol:** I think I should.
> 
> //(Agent Carol stands onto the step and stares into SCP-4000. The camera does not record anything unusual)//
> 
> **Tofflemire:** What do you see Alice?
> 
> **Carol:** I see every cryptid and thoughtform in Sloth's Pit driven mad and tearing up the whole town, like [[[black autumn hub | last Halloween]]] but a thousand times worse. It's because of us, because of our attempts at containing SCP-4000. We just made things worse, like we always do. God, did I say that?
> 
> //(Agent Carol steps away from SCP-4000)//
> 
> **Carol:** I don't think there's anymore useful information to be gained by standing on that step.
> 
> **Tofflemire:** Agreed. Do you want to set up camp first or the perimeter?
> 
> **Carol:** The perimeter, right. Ah, to those watching this, in addition to our stakeout mission, we were also to install a small perimeter fence around SCP-4000 embedded with various transponders and whatnot, so that we can see if its still there the next time SCP-4000 is found.
> 
> **Tofflemire:** And I made a warning sign to go with it.
> 
> //(Agent Toffelmire holds up a small wood sign which reads 'Bottomless Pit (and topless dancers)')//
> 
> **Carol:** We're not putting that up.
> 
> **Tofflemire:** Why not? It's kitschy, like all the other crap they sell at the tourist traps in town.
> 
> **Carol:** It's not sanctioned by command, plus it's stupid and sexist.
> 
> **Tofflemire:** Okay, I can fix the last part actually.
> 
> //(Agent Tofflemire takes out a sharpie pen to edit the sign. It now reads 'Bottomless Pit (and top--less--free dancers)')//
> 
> **Tofflemire:** There, that's the preferred politically correct term, I think, though it doesn't go as well with 'Bottomless Pit'. Do you think I should change Bottomless to Bottomfree?
> 
> **Carol:** You're an idiot.

> **<Begin Log>**
>  
> **Agent Carol:** This is Agent Carol, at the end of our first day of the SCP-4000 stakeout. I just wanted to do a quick talking head before I turn in. Tofflemire is taking the first shift. There's been no change in our situation. The forest is still abnormally quiet and we both still have this odd sense of unreality about what's going on. It's hard to explain, aside from saying that what's happening right now just doesn't feel real. The voices, or whatever it is, coming from the hole have neither abated nor intensified. We did get the fence up around SCP-4000, and I ended up letting Robert put the stupid sign up too. We repeated the usual SCP-4000 tests: radio drone, automated drone, laser rangefinders and a fishing line with a weight on it. We lost both drones, and both depth measurements were inconclusive, just as with previous tests. We got the camp set up, including a campfire. We need light for the stakeout, and fire's good at keeping away predators, scavengers and cryptids -
> 
> **Agent Tofflemire:** //(shouting from off camera)// Also we made s'mores!
> 
> **Carol:** ...Yeah, so we're settled in pretty good here. Our walkies and sat phones are useless, but the rest of the equipment is functional. The Kant Counters say the Hume level is normal, or normal for Sloth's Pit anyway. The VERITAS hasn't picked up any unusual EVE emissions from SCP-4000 either, and the Minkowski Spacetime Monitors aren't detecting up any spacetime distortions. Scintillation counters and EMF meters are all normal, and a sweep with the multispectral imager found nothing out of the ordinary. I wrote all the exact readings down in the forms. Honestly, if it weren't for the fact this thing doesn't stay put and we can't confirm that it's not actually bottomless, we wouldn't have any reason to think it's anomalous. We'll keep doing environmental checks a few times a day for as long as we're here. Maybe Tofflemire's right, and this will just be uneventful camping trip by a bottomless pit in a haunted forest.

> **Carol:** And why didn't you try to run when that thing came up?
> 
> **Tofflemire:** Because... we needed to fall down SCP-4000 to move the plot forward.
> 
> **Carol:** What? I think maybe you being alone in front of it without anyone else to keep you grounded led to an exaggeration of its derealization effect. To whoever is watching this video, I would advise sending the next SCP-4000 sweep in teams of four, so that guard shifts can be taken in pairs.  
> 
> **Tofflemire:** Alice, nothing but the Goatman has ever come back out of this pit. No one's going to see that tape.
> 
> **Carol:** If the frickin' Goatman can get out of here, then so can we! On your feet agent! We need to assess our surroundings.
> 
> **Tofflemire:** We're at the bottom of a bottomless pit. Roll Credits.
> 
> **Carol:** There's no light other than the camera's little LED, but I don't see any sign of whatever it was that tossed us in here. The ground appears to be ordinary dirt, so I honestly have no idea how we're still breathing. We were actually falling for half an hour, and assuming we were falling at terminal velocity that means we're roughly a hundred kilometers underground.
> 
> **Tofflemire:** I guess that means the Goatman can climb at about 2 kilometers an hour. I doubt we can climb that fast, and his body doesn't need food or rest. We'd die of thirst before we'd reach the top, and we'd probably fall from exhaustion long before then. We're stuck here Alice.
> 
> **Carol:** Robert, this isn't just a pit, it's an anomaly. For all we know... wait, do you hear that?
> 
> //(The sounds of a person digging with a shovel, along with breathing and grunts of exertion, can be heard in distance)//
> 
> **Tofflemire:** Holy crap, there's someone else down here! Hello!
> 
> **Carol:** Hello!
> 
> //(Agent Carol and Tofflemire head towards the source of the noise. Roughly a minute later a man in a soiled white dress shirt and suspenders comes into view. This entity is designated SCP-4000-01. Without ceasing digging, it looks up at the agents)//
> 
> **SCP-4000-01:** Mornin'.
> 
> **Carol:**...Good morning. I'm Alice, and this is Robert. We're with the S&C Plastics company -
> 
> **SCP-4000-01:** I know what S&C Plastics is, agent.
> 
> **Carol:** Lots of people around here do. I'm not going insult your intelligence by telling you a bunch of hogwash. Could you tell us who you are, and what you're doing here?
> 
> **SCP-4000-01:** You mean you don't recognize me? That's disappointing.
> 
> **Tofflemire:** I recognize you sir. I've seen your statue in the unforbidden dog park. You're Jackson Sloth.
> 
> **SCP-4000-01:** That's right sonny. I'm Sloth, and this is my Pit.
> 
> **Carol:** You're //the// Jackson Sloth, founder of Sloth's Pit? You've been down here for 130 years?
> 
> **SCP-4000-01:** What's the date?
> 
> **Tofflemire:** July 1st, Canada Day. 2018.
> 
> **SCP-4000-01:** Then no. I've been down here 127 years, six months and six days.
> 
> **Carol:** Digging a pit?
> 
> **SCP-4000-01:** //(briefly stops digging and looks up)// It's a metaphor //(resumes digging)//.
> 
> **Carol:** How are you still alive?
> 
> **SCP-4000-01:** I'm imaginary, just like this pit and all the monsters in this town.
> 
> **Carol:** Sir, you're not imaginary. We can both see you, and you're showing up on the camera.
> 
> **Tofflemire:** Sir, do you know this pit isn't just a hole in the ground? It's impossibly deep, no one can find it twice, it messes with people's sense of reality -
> 
> **SCP-4000-01:** I know exactly what this place is son. Grab a shovel, the both of you, and I'll tell you a bit of history.
> 
> //(Agents Carol and Tofflemire turn their attention to two previously unnoticed shovels propped up against the pit wall. Carol sets the camera down where it can record them, and both agents assist SCP-4000-01 in digging)//
> 
> **SCP-4000-01:** Since I was a young boy, I've always had a very intuitive sense of how the imaginary was real. The stories we're told and tell, the things we dream and fear, all of that effects our thoughts and feelings, and thus our actions. Reality is affected by the imaginary, and thus the imaginary cannot be said to unreal. Do you follow me?
> 
> **Carol:** We call that pataphysics.
> 
> **SCP-4000-01:** Well, I had a gift at crafting narratives that would shape reality in the way I wanted. Nothing impossible, or even all that fantastical, but I could none the less create narrative seeds that would germinated in the minds of all who heard or read them. Not every seed would sprout, and not every narrative would grow the way I had intended, but through trial and error I got better at creating successful seeds and more influential narratives. That's how I got so many people to follow me out west to create a lumber town, and also how I convinced them to settle in Wisconsin once I realized just how far out Oregon was.
> 
> **Carol:** It kind of just sounds like you were a good orator.
> 
> **SCP-4000-01:** I might have said so too, until Christmas Day, 1890. I was in my study, scribbling away in my notebook, trying to conjure up a narrative for Caroline that would make up for having to spend Christmas in the hospital, when I crossed some invisible line that should not have been crossed. The collective force of all my narratives reached some sort of critical mass and collapsed in on themselves. My house, everything in it and most of the land beneath it became imaginary. The disappearance sparked a wave of rumours, all of which this place lapped up until it became the bottomless pit people said it was.
> 
> **Carol:** You're saying that the Bottomless Pit that swallowed your house is some kind of pataphysical singularity?
> 
> **SCP-4000-01:** I suppose I am. And just like a collapsed star still generates enough gravity to distort nearby space, so too does this pit generate enough narrative force to seriously effect reality in Sloth's Pit. It creates narratives so strong they can sustain hundreds of tulpas and violate the laws of physics with ease. Six impossible things before breakfast, eh Alice? If only I could have created narratives like that when I was still real!  
> 
> **Tofflemire:** What about that monster that pulled us in here? What was -
> 
> //(The pit shakes as an agonized groan reverberates from up above)//
> 
> **SCP-4000-01:** Don't speak of it. It's not real, not yet, but with enough story it will be. Best to just ignore it, and dig. But now that you're here, I might take a short rest if you don't mind.
> 
> //(SCP-4000-01 sits down on a nearby boulder, and wipes its forehead with a handkerchief)//
> 
> **Carol:** Sir, do you know if there's any way out of this pit. We know the Goatman climbed out once, but if this a place where imagination shapes reality -
> 
> **SCP-4000-01:** Not just imagination, stories. Stories shape reality. The Goatman climbed out because that made his story better, it showed everyone what a relentless beast he is. You climbing out of here though? That would break suspension of disbelief for most people.
> 
> **Tofflemire:** What would you suggest then sir?
> 
> **SCP-4000-01:** Oh I'd just keep digging if I were you. After all, you know what they say. If you dig deep enough...
> 
> //(The ground beneath Agents Carol and Tofflemire begins to crack. It breaks open and both agents, as well as the camera, fall straight down)//
> 
> **SCP-4000-01:** //(shouting from above//) ...You'll dig through to China!
> 
> **<End Log>**

Agents Alison Carol and Robert Tofflemire were later recovered in the Shunan Bamboo Forest, in China, after falling out of a newly opened sinkhole. Later attempts to locate this sinkhole were unsuccessful.

The fence Agents Carol and Tofflemire installed around SCP-4000 was not found upon subsequent encounters. However, the sign installed by Agent Tofflemire remains by the front step.  

Two controlled descents using Buckminster filament and an electrical winch by later expeditions into SCP-4000 have failed to discover a bottom to the pit, even after passing the 100 km point where Carol and Tofflemire logically would have landed. Later expeditions to SCP-4000 also failed to encounter SCP-4000-01 or the entity that pulled Agents Carol and Tofflemire into the pit. However, field personnel have reported that the previously indistinct whispering emanating from SCP-4000 has become coherent. They allege the voices repeat the following verse indefinitely:

> Words are not real, and yet you know how to write
>
> The Pit Sloth isn't real, but he'll still give you a fright!

No analysis of this development is to be made at this time.
