**Item #:** SCP-001

**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** A single grave must be dug each day within SCP-001. For ritualistic purposes, each grave must be at least 183 centimeters deep. Length and width must be adequate to accommodate most adult human cadavers, with 2.45 meters in length and 0.75 meters in width considered sufficient.

Each grave must be dug manually by willing non-D class personnel, and using only the equipment provided by SCP-001-A. SCP-001-A will also specify the location of each grave. Gravedigging that has not been authorized by SCP-001-A is not permitted under any circumstances. All personnel are to defer to any instructions given by SCP-001-A,  and allow it to function unimpeded. Failure to do so will result in immediate demotion and reassignment.

During the majority of 13-year cycles with only three leap years, one grave is to be left empty and covered with a marble slab designated for the purpose. A different grave must be used for each cycle.

No fewer than four assigned gravediggers are to reside outside SCP-001 at any given time. All gravediggers must be physically suitable for hard labour with no underlying health conditions, and otherwise meet Foundation standards for Level One personnel.
 
No terminations are permitted within SCP-001 for any reason.

Special Task Force Alpha-Zero ("Dead Right Hand") is to be housed outside of SCP-001 and fully prepared for a Grave Robber Event at all times. At all other times, STF Alpha-Zero members are to patrol SCP-001 and limit access to authorized personnel, with specialization in repelling Occult Thaumaturges and sects of the Serpent's Hand.

The Administrator is permitted unfettered access to SCP-001, and any flowers or other grave goods he leaves are to be left untouched.

**Description:** SCP-001 is a cemetery built on a nexus point of seven geothaumic currents[[footnote]] Commonly referred to as Ley lines in the anomalous community. Geothaumic currents are torrents of various anomalous forces, generated and maintained by a combination of human, natural, and anomalous activity. Intersections of multiple geothaumic currents are known for being havens of anomalous phenomena. [[/footnote]], which it uses to manipulate quantum probability on a global scale. This prevents the Earth from entering an [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_eigenstates | Eigenstate]]] incompatible with the continued survival and success of the Foundation, and by extension most of modern civilization. The consequence of this is the greatly reduced probability of global catastrophe from both anomalous and mundane sources, at the cost of a globally weakened Hume field[[footnote]] Increasing both the strength and frequency of anomalies. [[/footnote]] and an increased likelihood of improbable events, especially within other geothaumic nexuses.

There are 4749[[footnote]] One for each day in a 13-year cycle, allowing for a maximum of four leap years per cycle. [[/footnote]] gravestones of varying design and complexity within SCP-001, arranged in a complex spoke and wheel pattern around a central mausoleum. Both the tombstones and the mausoleum are made from marble, and are inscribed with runes of unknown meaning.

SCP-001-A is a mute human male approximately two meters in height with a soft grey pallor to its skin, long grey hair and heavy stubble, typically dressed in a grey scarf and coat regardless of climate. Though it appears roughly 70 years old, it has not been observed to age.  SCP-001-A does not know any form of sign language, but can understand spoken English and will typically communicate with simple gestures. It has, however, demonstrated the ability to write when required.

Medical examination has revealed that SCP-001-A has no pulse, but is otherwise in reasonable health.

SCP-001-A has resided within SCP-001 since before its discovery and generally functions as a grave keeper, performing any mundane or anomalous maintenance and repairs it deems necessary. It refuses, however, to dig fresh graves, instead insisting that this be performed by Foundation personnel. It has indicated that the daily digging of a grave by the Foundation is a ritual necessary for SCP-001's continued functionality, and that SCP-001-A ensures that the ritual is completed correctly.

Each night, between the local hours of 03:00 and 04:00, a human cadaver will manifest within the mausoleum of SCP-001, designated SCP-001-1. To date, each cadaver has always been a physically mature adult between 40 kg and 140 kg in weight and 150 cm to 200 cm in height. Otherwise, humans of all genders, ages, ethnic groups and medical conditions have been represented in SCP-001-1 manifestations.

Most cadavers will possess some form of Foundation issue identification, yet none have ever been successfully identified as Foundation personnel or any actual known individual.

SCP-001-A will remove the cadaver and place it within the most recently dug grave and bury it with a mixture of woodchips[[footnote]] This is not believed to be ritualistic but simply to facilitate composting. The woodchips are produced non-anomalously from trees within SCP-001. [[/footnote]], and a silver coin of unknown origin. After a 13-year period, a grave may be reused. However, it will bear no trace of the former body, including non-biodegradable possessions.

Though SCP-001-A will permit on-site examination of SCP-001-1 instances, it will non-fatally incapacitate any personnel attempting to remove them beyond the boundaries of SCP-001. The events of Grave Robber Event-1982 (see below) have indicated that the effects of even a single SCP-001-1 instance being removed from SCP-001 could result in a potential K-class scenario. The O5 Council has forbidden any testing that would involve removing any dead bodies from SCP-001.

Failure to bury an instance of SCP-001-1 before the next manifestation, exhuming a grave prematurely[[footnote]] Gravediggers accidentally digging up the wrong grave due to poor communication with SCP-001-A is the most common cause of Grave Robber events. SCP-001-A denies having ever mistakenly assigned a premature grave.[[/footnote]], or a human person dying within SCP-001 will trigger a Grave Robber Event.

At the onset of a Grave Robber Event, a multitude of humanoid entities will manifest at various points in SCP-001, henceforth designated SCP-001-B. These entities are typically equipped with shovels and are attired in long leather coats, boots, and headwear. What skin is visible appears saggy and grey, hands and feet possess only three digits, and in place of a face is a single orifice opening to an anomalously deep cranial cavity. During Grave Robber Events, SCP-001-A will attempt to secure any vulnerable SCP-001-1 instances within the mausoleum.

SCP-001-B 's primary goal appears to be recovering any exposed SCP-001-1 instances, as well as exhuming still-buried bodies. They will also attempt to terminate any humans present within SCP-001 when possible in order to manifest more SCP-001-B entities and prolong the Grave Robber Event. They are also extremely proficient at using their shovels for defensive purposes against STF Alpha-Zero.

Due to an apparent lack of blood and internal organs, firearms are ineffective against SCP-001-B.  STF Alpha-Zero therefore favours dismemberment via the use of machetes and war axes. Explosive devices work as well, but have an unacceptably high risk of collateral damage to SCP-001 itself.

Grave Robber Events are not considered concluded until all SCP-001-B instances are incapacitated. This typically requires thorough dismemberment of all SCP-001-B entities, but on occasion, some will demanifest on their own in an apparent retreat. SCP-001-A will dispose of SCP-001-B remains via cremation, but will not object to the Foundation taking SCP-001-B bodies for study or interrogation.

 **Interview SCP-001-B/01:**

[[div class="quote"]]

**Interviewer:** //Alpha-Zero Commander Olson Blackmoore//

**Interviewee:** //Recovered SCP-001-B instance.//

**Foreword:** //The SCP-001-B instance in question had been relieved of all limbs during combat, but remained alert and aware.//

**<Begin Log>**

**Commander Blackmoore:** Not so tough now without any arms and legs, now are you?

//SCP-001-B does not respond.//

**Blackmoore:** Don't pretend you can't talk. You were plenty chatty earlier when you were bashing in my buddies' skulls with a shovel. In fact, I'd say that you've got quite the mouth on you, figuratively speaking at least.

//SCP-001-B does not respond.//

**Blackmoore:** If you won't talk, I'm going to have to make you talk. You might be thinking that there's not much I can do to you, seeing you've already lost all your limbs and that you don't seem to mind being stabbed or shot, but the big hole where your face should be looks like it might be a sensitive orifice. I'm willing to bet you wouldn't much care for me shoving some stuff into it, and I've got all kinds of stuff just lying around ready to test that hypothesis. You understand me?

**SCP-001-B:** //(grunts, nods reluctantly)//

**Blackmoore:** Good. I only got three questions, so this'll be quick. I want to know why you and your grave robbing pals keep showing up, why you only show up when a corpse is exposed, and what the fuck we can do to make you stop.

**SCP-001- B:** We come for the dead. I'd've thought that would've been obvious.

**Blackmore:** I'm going need more than that. Why these bodies?

**SCP-001-B:** The dead that lie here differ from common corpses in one key aspect; they were never alive. Not from where we're sitting, anyway. Their lives have been forgotten by existence itself. An impossible thing, even in a world filled with impossible things. The corpses you keep hold enormous ontological potential, which you just let seep back into the cosmos. You haven't the slightest idea of what you squander.

**Blackmoore:** Nor do I care to.  What about my second question? If these bodies are so valuable to you, why do you only show up when a -1 is left out too long, or when someone dies the old fashioned way?

**SCP-001-B:** Not for lack of motivation, I assure you. The sorcerers who made this place knew well what they were doing. The spells that protect it are powerful, but delicate. A tiny break in the ritual - a missed burial, an extra body - and they weaken just enough to let us in. You really ought to be more faithful in your duties.    

**Blackmoore:** If you know so much about this place, then you must know what it's for. Why are you willing to risk taking out bodies when it could mean Armageddon?

**SCP-001-B:** //(laughs)// Do I look like I'm of your world? Entire realities are devoured to sate the lust of Elder Gods. Why should I be bothered with the destruction of a measly dimensional backwater like this?

//Commander Blackmoore picks up a cattle prod and tests it in front of SCP-001-B.//

**Blackmoore:** I think I might be able to persuade you that our Earth has its own little quaint charm that's worth protecting. Before I do though, I'm going to give you one last chance to die with a bit of dignity. Tell me what we can do to keep you hollow-skull fuckers out for good.

**SCP-001-B:** There is nothing you can do. It doesn't matter if it takes us a thousand attempts over a thousand years, we only need to succeed once, and you need only to fail once. We will get a body, and then it will all have been worth it, and you will be left helpless to the merciless vicissitudes of -

//SCP-001-B screams as Commander Blackmoore shoves the cattle prod into its facial orifice.//

**<End Log>**

**Notes:** //SCP-001-B did not provide any further useful information during the remaining three hours of the interview.//

//An autopsy revealed that its internal thoracic cavity was mostly hollow, filled only with peat moss, a viscous black hydrocarbon webbing, and a small satchel filled with the skulls of various Passerine birds.//

**Addendum:** Multiple Persons of Interests and Groups of Interests with knowledge of geothaumic currents and nexuses are aware of the location and thaumatological significance of SCP-001, though it is believed that only the Global Occult Coalition is aware of its exact purpose. The GOC has agreed to allow the Foundation to maintain control over SCP-001, on the condition that they be allowed to regularly audit the security of SCP-001 to determine that it's up to the Coalition's current standards. In exchange, they have provided STF Alpha-Zero with occult weapons, tactics and fortifications, as well as intelligence on GoI-019 "Serpents Hand".

Though Occultists attempting to gain entry to SCP-001, forcefully or otherwise, is a common occurrence, the only successful breaches have been by sects of GoI-019. Their most commonly cited motivation is to liberate such a powerful nexus from the control of the Foundation and return it to the anomalous community, though it is also common for them to simply attempt to conduct rituals within SCP-001. The largest ever such raid was on April 19th, 1982, a few months after the Foundation's [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/lessons-learned| failed invasion]]] of the Wanderer's Libary, believed to have been motivated by vengeance for the attempt and emboldened at the Foundation's failure.    

This consequently resulted in Grave Robbing Event-1982, the largest such event to date, with massive casualties for both STF Alpha-Zero and the Serpent's Hand. GRE-1982 is the only known containment breach of SCP-001, with one SCP-001-1 being successfully stolen by SCP-001-B.

For a brief but indeterminate amount of time, it is believed that the Earth existed in a superposition of approximately 20 000 mutually exclusive but equally probable Eigenstates, caused by an equal number of retrocausal ontological shifts. Without a way to collapse back into a single Eigenstate, the total ontological failure of Earth is considered the most likely outcome of such a scenario.

This was averted in GRE-1982 by an unknown party, possibly SCP-001-A, replacing the stolen corpse with another body and enabling SCP-001 to return the Earth to a single Eigenstate. Scans using ground penetrating radar have shown that the body is attired in STF Alpha-Zero combat gear, though no members of STF Alpha-Zero were unaccounted for after the event.

Scans have also indicated that the individual was most likely buried alive.

Following GRE-1982, raids by GoI-019 were much smaller and more infrequent, likely due to a desire to avoid a global ontological collapse.

**Unknown PoI Encounter**: On the evening of October 14th, 2009, a single female figure was seen standing by a grave. She vanished before she could be apprehended, but left a bouquet of flowers and the following note:

**Discovery:** SCP-001 was discovered on November 7th, 1942. The following is a transcript of a magnetic wire recording of a conversation between the Administrator and then O5-1, having met in SCP-001 to discuss recent personnel issues.
[[collapsible show="+ Please Submit Authorization for Access to O5 Council Records" hide="- Access Granted. Welcome Overseer."]]

@@ @@

[[div class="quote"]]
**< Begin Log>**

**O5-1:** You've picked an odd place for a briefing.

**Administrator:** Meet-ups in strange places is hardly uncommon in our line of work, and graveyards are usually pretty empty.  Besides, I like cemeteries. They're peaceful, quiet, and always so very lovely.

**O5-1:** If you don't mind the corpses six feet beneath you.

**Administrator**: That's also not uncommon in our line of work.  //(silence for approximately 8 seconds)// You, ah, wanted to talk to me about some staffing issues?

**O5-1:** Yes sir, more like a staffing crisis. We are now short several thousand personnel across all ranks, including two vacant seats on the O5 Council. There's no record of anyone ever holding these positions, nor does anyone have any memory of them. It's as if thousands of essential positions were left unfilled for years, decades in some cases, and we only now noticed. We've no idea what's happened, but it's possible the entire Foundation is the victim of some kind of amnestic attack.

**Administrator:** There's no need for wild speculation, old friend. I know exactly what's happened.

**O5-1:** You do?

**Administrator:**  I do.

**O5-1:** So where are all our missing people?

**Administrator:** Oh, around. //(chuckles)// Here, take a look through this. It might make things clearer.

//It is believed the Administrator handed O5-1 an Adder Stone, a small anomalous item used to perceive paranormal phenomenon. These were commonly used during this period.//

**O5-1:** My god, the gravestones! They're, they're all ... I don't even know, but this is necromancy, isn't it? These are made out of people!

**Administrator**: Our people, yes.

**O5-1:** You knew about this?

**Administrator:** I ordered it. Four thousand, seven hundred and forty-nine souls taken all at once as a down-payment.

**O5-1:** A down-payment for what?

**Adminstrator:** Look up. Through the stone.

**O5-1:** Those are... Ley lines?

**Adminstrator:** Seven of them. Strong ones too. All crisscrossing here. This is a naturally powerful nexus, and I paid to make it even more powerful. This place uses Quantum Thaumaturgy to stack the deck against Doomsday. I've just made our whole planet Doomsday-proof.

**O5-1:** Why?

**Administrator:** You know about the Manhattan Project, don't you?

**O5-1**: What does that have to do with -

**Administrator:** I wanted so badly for nuclear physics to be anomalous, so that we could keep the world safe from the horrors of atomic warfare. But it's not anomalous. It's perfectly normal, which means it's none of our business if the nations of the world eventually build up stockpiles of thousands of atomic bombs, ready to destroy the planet at a moment's notice.

**Administrator:** //(sighs)// I couldn't live with that. I couldn't live with the knowledge that I could save the world, but not, simply because it was outside my jurisdiction. That's why I made this place. Now, no matter how close we stare into that abyss, we will never fall in. We will always get lucky, and the world will keep spinning for another day.

**O5-1:** But why don't we remember the lost personnel?  

**Administrator:** Because they're not just dead; they never existed. A total, yet individualized, ontological failure to balance out the existential cost of preventing a global catastrophe. Thousands now to make this place, and one more each day, forever. Always from our own ranks. That was the deal I made, because it was all I had the authority to offer.

**O5-1:** Sir, with all due respect, you did not have the authority to do this. At the very least, the Council should have been able to vote on it.

**Administrator:** And if you want to discipline me, I won't fight you on that, but what's done is done. Thousands are gone now, and hundreds more will be lost each year, but they knew the risks when they signed up. They died - or rather, were never born - in the dark, so that we can live in the light. Promise me you won't let the rest of the Council decommission this place.

**O5-1:** Decommission an occult spellcasting array of this scale inside of a septimal nexus? No one on the Council is stupid enough to want to try that. I can hardly believe you didn't punch open a permanent portal to Hell just making this thing. We'll treat this place like it's made of glass.    

**Administrator:** Thank you. Here, take this file. Everything I know about this place is in there.  Do whatever you want.

//The sound of shuffling papers is heard.//

**O5-1:** Goddamn black magic. Looks like we're going to have to fill one of those vacant Council seats with a Thaumatolgist just to make sense of this. Who exactly is this Grave Keeper?

**Administrator:** Someone I trust with the fate of the world. That's all you need to know.

**O5-1:** For now, at least. If that ever changes, don't be surprise if I press the issue. Am I dismissed, sir?  

**Administrator:** There is one more thing. I've never been married, or had children, right?

**O5-1:** Not to my knowledge sir.

**Administrator:** You've known me a long time. Does that seem like me?

**O5-1:** I, ah... oh. I see. You think that they were part of your... down-payment?

**Administrator:** Every soul in here was a colleague. It seems many of them would have been friends. Some may have been more. To all of us.

**O5-1:** My condolences then, sir

**Administrator:** And mine to you.

**O5-1:** Promise me you won't stay here too long, okay sir?

**Administrator:** Only as long as I need to. You're dismissed, Overseer.

I joined the SCP community back in August of 2014. I learned about it from a [[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOnB2fWQz0w |youtube video listing popular creepypastas]]]. I've wondered if I ever would have discovered the Foundation if not for that one video. The internet is vast, after all.

      **First Attempts:**
Like most newbies, my first post was a failure. It was an SCP called the Polyocculus. It was a short scrawny humanoid whose skin was filled with holes like that of a Surinam Toad's. It would steal people's eyes and shove them into the holes because it was terrified of going blind. I was going for a little trypophobia and taking a common fear, fear of disability, and ramping it up to insane levels. It got deleted for being a horror movie monster.

Next was a little Fairy Statue that I called the Mneumonic Device that prevented amnestics from working within a mile. It got deleted as well. I had a few more ideas over the next couple of years that I at least had drafts for or got feedback on but never posted. There was a stupid tale about 096 that involved idiotic cross testing, a lolfoundation termination log for 096, and an anomalous copy of Nobody Poops But You that caused anyone who read it to believe exactly that, which was too silly for the mainlist but not silly enough for a -J.  

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/new-job |New Job:]]]**
I did not have a successful article until June of 2016, when I posted New Job. Honestly, this is just a silly headcanon I had and I'm surprised it's as highly rated as it is. It is currently my highest rated article (though it is neck and neck with [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3717 |SCP-3717]]] at the moment), but it has the benefit of being nine months older than anything else I've posted, so I wouldn't call it my best. I actually completely agree with most of the negative criticism the article has received. But as my first post, it was proof that I could create successful articles.

This now has a reading by TheeSherm, which you can find [[[https://youtu.be/o-ucpc59wtc |here]]].  

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/crunch-is-a-beautiful-sound |Crunch is a Beautiful Sound:]]]**
When I saw there was a 173 contest, I immediately wrote down my headcanon about it inside of a bare-bones framing device and cold posted it. Crunch is a Beautiful Sound was the result. I believe this is my most divisive article, since as of the time of this writing it has 42 votes and an aggregate score of 16.

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/osteotronic-cubes-vxy33-f7rq3-9xad1 |Osteotronic Cubes:]]]**
This was inspired by the tale [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/iris-dark |Iris Dark]]]. I just started wondering what happened after this tale, so I wrote an MC&D format piece about it. I was pleasantly surprised by how well this did.  

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-dark-web-dke79-o2rg5-4jlw6 |The Dark Web:]]]**
"What are you doing?" 
"A sequel."
"... I don't understand."
"Yeah me neither, but we pretty much nailed it the first time."

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/micky-d-s |Micky D's:]]]**
"Yeah, I'd like to get a 10-piece McNugget and a bunch of the Szechuan sauce. Like, as much as you're allowed to give me." In all seriousness, this was actually inspired by me seeing the letters McD on a McDonald's cup. 

**[[[Text Message in a Bottle | Text Message in a Bottle:]]]**
"It’s a bad phone. Chuck it. I downgraded to a clamshell for emergencies only." 
My piece for the [[[siabhub | dickbottle canon]]].

My MC&D format for Stormbreath's War on all Front's Canon.

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3903 |SCP-3903, Fata Morgana:]]]**
This is my first successful non-Herman Fuller SCP, and that was pretty much my motivation for writing it. I just thought that the Fata Morgana mirage was ripe for skipification, and the story developed from there.

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/document-3477-2 |Supplement SCP-3477-2:]]]**
This is my first and only supplement at the moment. I really loved stormbreath's scip [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/SCP-3477|SCP-3477]]], and I started compiling a list of all the different ways someone could live forever whenever I happened to think of them. When I had enough for all 34 instances of SCP-3477, I e-mailed stormbreath and asked if they'd be interested in a supplement page.

**[[[SCP-3806 |SCP-3806, I AM AWAITED IN VALHALLA!:]]]**
Inspired by the opening line of CGP Grey video, and named after a battlecry from Fury Road. 

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/habil-and-qabil |Habil and Qabil:]]]**
Just a weird idea I let sit around for over a year, and finally decided to post when DrMagnus posted an SCP/MLP crossover. That's right.

**[[[Utter Depravity | Utter Depravity:]]]**
A short mystery tale I made up on the fly for Jamcon2018. Gave me a chance to expand on the Utterly Bazaar a little bit and set up a D&C tale. First appearance of Ed of  Ed and Al's, as well as one of Metaphysicians's Aristocrats, which I love.

**[[[A Foul Storm in a Fair Land | A Foul Storm in a Fair Land:]]]**
Another Jamcon2018 entry. Like the first one, it probably never would have existed if not for the contest. I set it in the War on All Fronts Canon, detailing the final moments of Hy-brasil's King. I enjoy writting about the Fair Folk, and may produce other such works in the future.

**[[[SCP-3189 | SCP-3189, For The Man Who Has Everything:]]]**
Don't have much to say about this one. Basically, it's a wishing machine built by a sad wizard that Darke screwed over. 

**[[[Updated Amnestics Guide | Updated Amnestics Guide:]]]**
Exactly what it says on the tin. I never really like the original guide, so I wrote my own and decided to post it as an alternative head-canon. There's a tacked on narrative at the end because I felt obligated to do so, but I agree that the story's not the best. 

**[[[SCP-3277 | SCP-3277, Speak Softly And Carry A Big Stick:]]]**
Inspired by a walking stick I own, I decided to make an SCP about wizard staffs that are kind of crappy, and how MC&D could still make a buck off them.

**[[[The Kaiju Sea | The Kaiju Sea:]]]**
My First Serpent's Hand Format, written for Doomcon2018 as part of Team Mikasa.

**[[[SCP-3549 | SCP-3549, Sweet Medieval Bitcoin:]]]**
Another SCP based on my version of MC&D, and inspired by 049-J, or at least the image djkaktus links too in the author post. 

**[[[SCP-3619 | SCP-3619, You Spin Me Right Round, Baby, Right Round:]]]**
Since I write a lot from the perspective of a GoI that actively harbours anomalies from the Foundation, I decided to reverse that perspective and make a Freak who was happy he escaped from the Circus and ended up in Foundation custody.

**[[[mcd fidget winners | 'Fidget Winners' (FDG43/W1NR3/5SLA2):]]]**
I'm out of Rick and Morty quotes that would make sense for these. 

Ihp showed me a draft for these things, and I liked it so much I made an MC&D format to go with it. 

**[[[Over thinking the Rainbow | Over(thinking) the Rainbow:]]]**
Some people just want to forget the Pride Logo Fiasco. I won't let them. 

**[[[SCP-4040 | SCP-4040, At The Bottom of a Bottomless Pit:]]]**
My SCP-4000 contest entry came in at 15th place out of 70 or so entries at the time voting was closed, and is currently my highest rated article on the site. Considering my SCP-3000 entry was quickly voted to deletion, I call that progress.  

This was inspired by the ending of the first [[[Black Autumn hub| Black Autumn series]]], which I was the foremost beta reader on, and in turn inspired [[[rise of the pit sloth hub | Black Autumn II]]]. 

**[[[slice of life | Slice of Life:]]]**
This was an idea that just came to me, and I decided to write it mainly because it's unlike anything else I've done on this site and presents an interesting look at D-class. It does have a sequel, but that was just written for a contest. 

**[[[clef excerpts|Excerpts From "How To Survive When Reality Doesn't", by Alto Clef:]]]**
I mentioned this in the tale "A Circus Come to Not" and someone suggested I should make it its own thing.

**[[[somatic backups | 'Somatic Backups' (SOM64/B2DI5/3GYO7):]]]**
MC&D format I wrote to cap off Darkstuff's Vend-a-Friend series, which he was kind enough to tie into Dread & Circuses. 

**[[[SCP-4202 | SCP-4202, Sleepy Clappy Sleep Aid:]]]**
My attempt at a short, simple, Series I style magic object. 


**[[[SCP-4309 | SCP-4309, Huddle With Us:]]]**
Creepypasta monsters! 


**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/dread-circuses-hub |Dread & Circuses:]]]**
But of course, what I'm best known for is Dread & Circuses. I explain on the hub page why I started that series, so I don't think I'll repeat myself here. The first entry in this series was only my second successful post on this wiki, but over a relatively short time span I've generated a surprising number of successful chapters. I'm very grateful to PeppersGhost for creating Herman Fuller's Circus of the Disquieting, otherwise I may never have found such a niche.
