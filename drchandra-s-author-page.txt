I joined the SCP community back in August of 2014. I learned about it from a [[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOnB2fWQz0w |youtube video listing popular creepypastas]]]. I've wondered if I ever would have discovered the Foundation if not for that one video. The internet is vast, after all.

**First Attempts:**
Like most newbies, my first post was a failure. It was an SCP called the Polyocculus. It was a short scrawny humanoid whose skin was filled with holes like that of a Surinam Toad's. It would steal people's eyes and shove them into the holes because it was terrified of going blind. I was going for a little trypophobia and taking a common fear, fear of disability, and ramping it up to insane levels. It got deleted for being a horror movie monster.

Next was a little Fairy Statue that I called the Mneumonic Device that prevented amnestics from working within a mile. It got deleted as well. I had a few more ideas over the next couple of years that I at least had drafts for or got feedback on but never posted. There was a stupid tale about 096 that involved idiotic cross testing, a lolfoundation termination log for 096, and an anomalous copy of Nobody Poops But You that caused anyone who read it to believe exactly that, which was too silly for the mainlist but not silly enough for a -J.  

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/new-job |New Job:]]]**
I did not have a successful article until June of 2016, when I posted New Job. Honestly, this is just a silly headcanon I had and I'm surprised it's as highly rated as it is. It is currently my highest rated article (though it is neck and neck with [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3717 |SCP-3717]]] at the moment), but it has the benefit of being nine months older than anything else I've posted, so I wouldn't call it my best. I actually completely agree with most of the negative criticism the article has received. But as my first post, it was proof that I could create successful articles.

This now has a reading by TheeSherm, which you can find [[[https://youtu.be/o-ucpc59wtc |here]]].  

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/crunch-is-a-beautiful-sound |Crunch is a Beautiful Sound:]]]**
When I saw there was a 173 contest, I immediately wrote down my headcanon about it inside of a bare-bones framing device and cold posted it. Crunch is a Beautiful Sound was the result. I believe this is my most divisive article, since as of the time of this writing it has 42 votes and an aggregate score of 16.

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/osteotronic-cubes-vxy33-f7rq3-9xad1 |Osteotronic Cubes:]]]**
This was inspired by the tale [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/iris-dark |Iris Dark]]]. I just started wondering what happened after this tale, so I wrote an MC&D format piece about it. I was pleasantly surprised by how well this did.  

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-dark-web-dke79-o2rg5-4jlw6 |The Dark Web:]]]**
"What are you doing?" 
"A sequel."
"... I don't understand."
"Yeah me neither, but we pretty much nailed it the first time."

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/micky-d-s |Micky D's:]]]**
"Yeah, I'd like to get a 10-piece McNugget and a bunch of the Szechuan sauce. Like, as much as you're allowed to give me." In all seriousness, this was actually inspired by me seeing the letters McD on a McDonald's cup. 

**[[[Text Message in a Bottle | Text Message in a Bottle:]]]**
"It’s a bad phone. Chuck it. I downgraded to a clamshell for emergencies only." 
My piece for the [[[siabhub | dickbottle canon]]].

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/kaiju-caviar-ocn39-t5fg6-7hjl2 |Kaiju Caviar:]]]**
My MC&D format for Stormbreath's War on all Front's Canon.

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3903 |SCP-3903, Fata Morgana:]]]**
This is my first successful non-Herman Fuller SCP, and that was pretty much my motivation for writing it. I just thought that the Fata Morgana mirage was ripe for skipification, and the story developed from there.

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/document-3477-2 |Supplement SCP-3477-2:]]]**
This is my first and only supplement at the moment. I really loved stormbreath's scip [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/SCP-3477|SCP-3477]]], and I started compiling a list of all the different ways someone could live forever whenever I happened to think of them. When I had enough for all 34 instances of SCP-3477, I e-mailed stormbreath and asked if they'd be interested in a supplement page.

**[[[SCP-3806 |SCP-3806, I AM AWAITED IN VALHALLA!:]]]**
Inspired by the opening line of CGP Grey video, and named after a battlecry from Fury Road. 

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/habil-and-qabil |Habil and Qabil:]]]**
Just a weird idea I let sit around for over a year, and finally decided to post when DrMagnus posted an SCP/MLP crossover. That's right.

**[[[Utter Depravity | Utter Depravity:]]]**
A short mystery tale I made up on the fly for Jamcon2018. Gave me a chance to expand on the Utterly Bazaar a little bit and set up a D&C tale. First appearance of Ed of  Ed and Al's, as well as one of Metaphysicians's Aristocrats, which I love.

**[[[A Foul Storm in a Fair Land | A Foul Storm in a Fair Land:]]]**
Another Jamcon2018 entry. Like the first one, it probably never would have existed if not for the contest. I set it in the War on All Fronts Canon, detailing the final moments of Hy-brasil's King. I enjoy writting about the Fair Folk, and may produce other such works in the future.

**[[[SCP-3189 | SCP-3189, For The Man Who Has Everything:]]]**
Don't have much to say about this one. Basically, it's a wishing machine built by a sad wizard that Darke screwed over. 

**[[[Updated Amnestics Guide | Updated Amnestics Guide:]]]**
Exactly what it says on the tin. I never really like the original guide, so I wrote my own and decided to post it as an alternative head-canon. There's a tacked on narrative at the end because I felt obligated to do so, but I agree that the story's not the best. 

**[[[SCP-3277 | SCP-3277, Speak Softly And Carry A Big Stick:]]]**
Inspired by a walking stick I own, I decided to make an SCP about wizard staffs that are kind of crappy, and how MC&D could still make a buck off them.

**[[[The Kaiju Sea | The Kaiju Sea:]]]**
My First Serpent's Hand Format, written for Doomcon2018 as part of Team Mikasa.

**[[[SCP-3549 | SCP-3549, Sweet Medieval Bitcoin:]]]**
Another SCP based on my version of MC&D, and inspired by 049-J, or at least the image djkaktus links too in the author post. 

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/dread-circuses-hub |Dread & Circuses:]]]**
But of course, what I'm best known for is Dread & Circuses. I explain on the hub page why I started that series, so I don't think I'll repeat myself here. The first entry in this series was only my second successful post on this wiki, but over a relatively short time span I've generated a surprising number of successful chapters. I'm very grateful to PeppersGhost for creating Herman Fuller's Circus of the Disquieting, otherwise I may never have found such a niche.

Just some HF format I'm working on. The modules don't show up right in all browsers so I take a screenshot and post them as single images.

[[include component:hf-book-right chapter=The Dread Behemoth |content="Who could forget the night that Dread Behemoth rose forth from the sea to wreak havoc on the fair and free city of Three Portlands? The dastardly Geo Sea had driven the beast there, happy to sacrifice a town of marvels to preserve their precious veil of normalcy. They probably figured the beast would do some of their own dirty work for them. Oh, it riles me up just thinking about it!

Never mind them now though. That's not what you came here to hear about. You want to know about the Dread Behemoth.

Let me tell you, the behemoth was a sight to behold, truly titanic in size. A hundred stories tall if it was a foot! It towered over the city, its foul shadow falling upon everything, eclipsing the sky and blocking out the stars themselves! Every stride it took caused earthquakes and tsunamis, its gargantuan feet leaving craters where they struck ground! The mere force of its wails was enough to topple skyscrapers!  

Men, women and children all wept and fled in mass pandemonium. The swift trampled the slow, cramming themselves into the Ways out of the city. Some succame to madness and took their own lives while others tried to swim out to sea, as though that could offer any refuge from such a menace. All had abandoned hope, for what force on Earth would dare oppose the nightmare that was the Dread Behemoth?

Herman Fuller! That's who! 

It was sheer chance I was there that day, I had an appointment with my haberdasher about expanding the storage capacity in my top hat, but what good fortune it was! I wasn't about to turn tail and run when so many innocent people were at risk of losing life and livelihood, hearth and home! If no one else was going to stop this beast, then I'd have to do it myself.  

Doing what I could to drum up my courage, I sized up my foe. He had a pound or two on me, it's true, it's true, but I had my wits! I knew I was no good getting stomped under its feet, so I made for higher ground. I climbed a fire escape to the top of the tallest building I could get to, and by then that was the last building left standing. 

From atop that lonely citadel, I gazed down the Dread Behemoth, and I swear to you friends he looked at me not with mere animal hunger but with contempt! Who was I to stand my ground against him when all others had fled? I would pay for my insolence dearly, I surely would. 

Or so he thought! One good look into his eyes was all I needed to know his true nature, and in those deep wells of cosmic time I saw that it was only his heart that was truly immortal, and without it, he would perish. It was then obvious what needed to be done; separate the beast from its heart. An impossible task you say? Herman Fuller doesn't know the meaning of the word impossible!

Drawing forth my twenty-foot harpoon, which I always carry on me for just such occasions, I aimed true and thrust it directly into the Behemoth's chest. Fortunately, my knowledge of Eldritch anatomy was spot on and I pierced the beast's undying heart. With a mighty pull, I freed the heart from the monster's ribcage, and it was immortal no longer.

The Behemoth was dead before it hit the ground, but at the very least it left a magnificent corpse. I, however, had no use for a megaton of squid meat, so I left it be. I kept only the Heart of the Ocean as my trophy, which I proudly present to you today as proof of my extraordinary heroism." 

~ Yeah, literally none of that's true. We were nowhere near Three Portlands that day, and believe me, if we were Herman would have apportated us out in a heartbeat. The Heart of the Ocean is just a whale's heart he keeps pumping with a little granola sarkicism. It's kind of boring actually.

With Herman Fuller gone, the Freaks are running the Circus now. Flaunting the veil of normalcy and somehow always narrowly avoiding the clutches of the Essie P, Geo Sea and Insurgent Sea, The Circus of the Disquieting provides a sanctuary for anomalous humanoids while offering people a glimpse of what lies behind the Masquerade.

Ladies and Gentlemen, children of all ages, Herman Fuller's Circus of the Disquieting is proud to announce our new Master of Ceremonies. She started off as just another runaway, but through sheer talent and determination she's clawed her way up from magician, to Clown, to troupe leader and now to the Ringmaster of the Circus itself! I give you the beautiful, the astonishing, the magical Icky!
