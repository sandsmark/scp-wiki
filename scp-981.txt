**Item #:** SCP-981

**Object Class:**  Safe (Possible Euclid, awaiting further testing)

**Special Containment Procedures:**	Having shown no signs of its influence spreading further than the recorded distance, as long as SCP-981-2 remains within SCP-981-1 it is required only to be stored in a standard artifact room in a locked copper box of at least 1cm thickness. Access to the SCP is by application for level 3 and above only.

    If SCP-981-2 is to be removed from its case it must be in a room at least eight cubic feet in size containing no physical media of any kind, and care must be taken to ensure any travel distance and rooms above and below are also cleared. Any memory sticks carried by Foundation personnel should also be removed before entering the room as a precaution. Any media found to contain evidence of Keter-class SCPs must be quarantined at once.

**Description:**	SCP-981 comprises of two parts. SCP-981-2 is a steel film canister dating from the late 1920s, with signs of damage concurrent with its apparent age. It is labelled in Spanish as having been copied by the Buenos Aires Cinematographic Laboratory, with the handwritten title ‘236 - Metropolis’ Other writing on the label is too worn to read, but appears to be a name and a short note in a different handwriting. Inside the canister is a reel spooled with Kodak Panchromatic nitrate film, on which is a 16mm reduction negative of the 1927 Fritz Lang film //Metropolis//. The film and the canister it was found in show no unusual markings or indications that they are anything other than a mass-produced stock for distribution to cinemas in the late 1920s. 

    The canister was seized from the museum by two agents of the Foundation posing as officers of GSG-9, stating that the film’s contents were evidence. It was secured in its current site and carefully examined by comparing it to the 2008 restoration edition. The film’s ending featured an extra scene, approximately forty seconds long, which was cut between the robot Maria being burned at the stake and the final cathedral scene. It features Fröhlich’s character Freder walking through an alleyway and finding the end walled off with a plain white door. He experiences some surprise at the exit being blocked, but opens the door and walks through. Then follows a text plate reading ‘My Lord! I’m near the Cathedral!’ and the film then continues as normal. The door shows all of the properties of SCP-███.

    Due to this anomalous behaviour it was decided to perform testing using the film, removing it from the box and placing it in contact with another film. Qualitative testing showed that any time spent within 76” of the canister is required for effects to show on the test media. When removed from the canister only the film itself produces the anomaly.

    Both elements of the SCP were discovered on ██/██/██ by a Foundation employee at the //Deustsche Kinemathek// film museum in Berlin during a non-official visit. During a conversation with a curator regarding storage techniques it became apparent that the print was found in close proximity to the original site of SCP-███. The curator described it having been found on a shelf in a basement of a building previously used as a youth hostel, resting on top of a copy of the 1939 film //The Bad Sister//. This had not been retained by the museum as it was believed to be a modern hoax, as Bette Davis’ character was seen in the final reel of the film to violently assault the character played by Sidney Fox with at knifepoint.

>  Dr ██████: What did they do with it? 
>  
>   Agent █████: He said that they’d disposed of the last ten minutes and used the rest for restoration practice. I asked if they still had it but he said it had been burned. He’d said ‘It wasn’t worth keeping, disgusting filth like that.’ And suggested that it had been put there by youths staying at the hostel for a prank.
>  
>  Dr ██████: Did he describe what had been on the tape?
>  
>   Agent █████: He said it was the same as the original up until the point where Davis’ character is normally propositioned by her sister’s fiancé, instead she goes through a desk drawer until she finds a piece of black rock, sharpened at one end like a piece of flint, and is seen breaking into her sister’s room and making hundreds of tiny cuts all over her body whilst smothering her with a pillow. The next shot is of an unharmed Sidney Fox leaving the room and smiling at the camera as the screen fades to the credits.

**Experimental Test Logs:**

**Experiment 981-1A:**
**Date:** ██-██-████
**Media:** ‘//It’s a Wonderful Life//, (1946), celluloid film.
**Divergence time:** ██:██
**Details:** Instead of stating that ‘Every time a bell rings an angel gets their wings’ the character of Clarence pats Jimmy Stewart on the back and says ‘It’s only eight seconds, it’ll hardly hurt a bit.’ Instead of running back to Bedford Falls Stewart’s character enters what appears to be a chemical factory in some disrepair, grabs a white coat from a hook and runs over to a computer monitor. He mutters under his breath ‘one one thousand two one thousand…’ and as he gets to ‘eight one thousand’ three rounds of automatic fire hit him in the chest and he drops to the floor as the screen fades to end credits. Similarities to [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Experiment 981-1B:**
**Date:** ██-██-████
**Media:** ‘//Manos: The Hands of Fate//’, 1966, VHS.
**Divergence time:** ██:██
**Details:** During the denouement when The Master confronts Michael, instead of finding Michael and his family hiding in a room they are all [DATA EXPUNGED]. The Master begins mopping up the brown substance on the floor whilst staring intently at the corner of the room outside the purview of the camera, as the credits roll.

**Experiment 981-1C:**
**Date:** ██-██-████
**Media:** ‘//The Dark Knight//’, 2008, DVD.
**Divergence time:** ██:██ (Film runs ██ minutes shorter due to missing scenes)
**Details:** The scene where Heath Ledger’s Joker is hanging upside down having been caught by Batman runs as in the original theatrical edit, but at the end the Ledger looks directly at the camera and says ‘You don’t realise, do you? One thousand? You haven’t even started.’ He then pulls out a bright blue █████████ and a knife, runs the blade across his throat and dips the █████████ in his blood as Christian Bale’s closing speech originally used at the end of the film leads into new credits listing every cast and crew member's name as ‘//Youhaven’tevenstarted’//.

**Addendum:**	Aside from the clear danger that this SCP poses to the security of the Foundation’s records, it clearly has the ability to transfer evidence of clearly undiscovered SCPs. As a research tool its potential is great, and a qualitative system of testing must be established. The careful use of this and SCP-███ could be of great benefit to the Foundation is used with care. To reiterate: Any media found to contain evidence of recognised or potential Keter-class SCPs must be quarantined at once, and no contact with other media based SPCs should be attempted with highest level approval.
