**Item #:** SCP-4314

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-4314 is extremely well known and necessary for many mathematical operations, and therefore cannot be fully contained.  This is no cause for alarm, however, as its anomalous properties are not observable until the ██████████████████th digit.

MTF Pi-31 ("Number Crunchers") is dedicated to sabotaging any attempts by groups other than the Foundation to calculate the value of SCP-4314 beyond the ██████████████████th digit.  This sabotage is to be achieved by any means necessary, though termination is to be used only as a last resort to avoid suspicion.  Should any attempt to measure SCP-4314 beyond that point succeed, all evidence of such is to be confiscated and all witnesses given Class B amnestics.

--Foundation AI-4314 is currently dedicated to calculating SCP-4314's value as precisely as possible.--

No further attempts to calculate the value of SCP-4314 with a high degree of precision are to be made.

**Description:**  SCP-4314 is the irrational number defined as pi (π).  The first ██████████████████ digits of SCP-4314 exhibit no anomalous properties, and can be used in mathematical operations like any other number.  Beyond the ██████████████████th digit, all remaining digits are either ones (1) or zeroes (0).  When broken into intervals of 5, these numbers constitute a sequence of binary code that can be translated into English.  The translation process always produces complete words, which can occasionally be strung together to from coherent sentences.  These sentences appear to be messages from an unknown sentient being or group of beings, designated SCP-4314-A.

As of ██/██/████, Foundation AI-4314 has calculated SCP-4314 out to ██████████████████ digits.  The messages have yet to repeat.

**Addendum 4314-01:** On ██/██/████, the computer housing AI-4314 experienced a fatal malfunction, halting calculation at the ██████████████████th digit.

**Addendum 4314-02:** On ██/██/████, AI-4314-2 (an upgraded version of AI-4314) began calculating the value of SCP-4314.  To ensure that the results found by AI-4314 had not been affected by its malfunction, AI-4314-2 resumed calculation from the beginning.  Initially, the results of this calculation matched those found by AI-4314 and other attempts at calculating SCP-4314's value.  However, when AI-4314-2 reached the ██████████████████th digit, the results were found to differ from those obtained in the previous experiment.  This was initially assumed to be a result of AI-4314's malfunction.

**Addendum 4314-03:** On ██/██/████, a team of researchers at ███████ University calculated SCP-4314 to the ██████████████████th digit.  MTF Pi-31 ("Number Crunchers") prevented the team from announcing its findings, amnestized them, and seized their data.  Examination of the confiscated data showed that the results were once again different from those of previous calculations.

**Addendum 4314-04:** Further testing has shown that each attempt to calculate the value of SCP-4314 beyond the ██████████████████th digit yields a different result.  It is theorized that detailed measurement of SCP-4314 actually causes the value to change, indicating that the digits beyond the ██████████████████th exist in a quantum state.  The exact mechanics of this are unknown, as current mathematical models fail to accomodate such a possibility.

**Addendum 4314-05:** On ██/██/████, AI-4314-2 reached the furthest digit it was capable of calculating.  The process was re-started at the ██████████████████th digit, and yielded different results from the previous test as expected.

**Addendum 4314-06:**  On ██/██/████, the O5 council voted to restart AI-4314's calculations once a month, to increase the rate at which messages from SCP-4314-A are recorded.

**Addendum 4314-07:**  Included below is a sample of notable messages received from SCP-4314-A.

**Addendum 4314-08:** Upon restarting its calculation of SCP-4314 for the █th time, AI-4314-2 discovered that SCP-4314-A's messages had begun ██ digits earlier than before.  Each subsequent recalculation has detected the messages increasingly earlier.  Further recalculations of of SCP-4314 have been halted, as larger alterations to the value of SCP-4314 could potentially result in a VK-Class Reality Restructuring Event or a [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Addendum 4314-09:**

On ██/██/████, Foundation AI-4314-2 was brought back online and directed to calculate the value of //e// as precisely as possible.

**Addendum 4314-10:**
[[collapsible show="LEVEL 4 EYES ONLY" hide="hide addendum 4314-10"]]
When calculated beyond the ██████████████th digit, the number "e" was confirmed to have anomalous properties identical to those of SCP-4314.  Pi has been redesignated as SCP-4314-1, and //e// has been designated SCP-4314-2.  Further testing has confirmed that the square root of two (SCP-4314-3) and, presumably, all other irrational numbers exhibit these same properties.  From this point forward, all irrational numbers are considered instances of SCP-4314[[footnote]]It appears that the creators of [[[SCP-4500]]] may have been aware of SCP-4314 to some extent, due to their classification of irrational numbers as an anomaly.[[/footnote]].

The messages decoded from different instances of SCP-4314 appear to originate from different entities, based on small differences in phrasing.  Only one instance, designated SCP-4314-G, has referred to itself in the first person.  SCP-4314-G is the instance associated the square root of 7 (SCP-4314-7).  Unlike other recorded instances, it simply repeats the same message for as far as it has been measured.  The content of this message does not change, only the point at which it begins.

The message left by SCP-4314-G is as follows:
