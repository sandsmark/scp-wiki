**Item #:** SCP-2376

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2376-1 instances are to be watered using an automated irrigation system. They are to be fertilized and trimmed once every eight hours by medical staff. SCP-2376-1 instances are not to be made aware of the anomalous properties of SCP-2376. In order to allow communication between SCP-2376-1 instances and personnel, a text-based communicator suitable for use by persons with severely limited mobility should be provided to each instance of SCP-2376-1. Under no circumstances are patients to be removed from their lawns or cut down. Personnel treating SCP-2376-1 are to follow all instructions given to them without fail, and should be frequently reminded that they are treating a human being. All SCP-2376-1 instances, as well as samples of SCP-2376, are located at Site-234. [[[task-forces#beta-7|MTF Beta-7 (Hedgeclippers)]]] are to check for instances of SCP-2376-1 in gardens and public parks located in infected areas, and maintain their water and nutrient levels daily. Instances have been known to suffer rapid declines and perish overnight; Class-A amnestics should be carried when tending to publicly rooted subjects for this reason.

**Description:** SCP-2376 is a sub-strain of tetanus (//Clostridium tetani//) carried by robins, chickadees, crows, blue jays, finches, cardinals, and other common garden birds - see Document 2376-Gamma for a full list of carrier species. SCP-2376 is transmissible to humans - infected humans are designated instances of SCP-2376-1. The first stage of infection, lasting anywhere from 1 to 4 weeks, is characterized by the normal symptoms of tetanus[[footnote]]high fever, painful muscle spasms, and rapid loss of mobility[[/footnote]] as well as a severe skin rash, vertigo, and a painful cough. Instances of SCP-2376-1 in their first stage will often report a constant faint odor of freshly cut grass or boxwood, as well as describing all objects to have a smooth, leaf-like texture regardless of their composition. 

The second stage of the infection is when SCP-2376's anomalous properties manifest. All instances of SCP-2376-1 are perceived as a topiary sculpture by any human observers. The observers do not appear to be aware that the infected individual is missing, or that the plant has replaced it. Many will fabricate a false origin of the 2376-1 subject if asked. Any vocalization by the SCP-2376-1 instances will not be registered. Motion is not visible to observers, but if a person observing an SCP-2376-1 instance breaks visual contact while the instance is moving, the instance will appear to have uprooted itself and relocated. Motion detectors and audio recordings will function as normal. Photographs and other visual recordings of infected subjects, however, are still not perceived normally. 2376-1 instances are no longer capable of digesting normal food, however, and must be fed a mixture of potting soil and fertilizer along with the requisite amount of water needed to maintain a plant of that size.

The loss of mobility, fever, and other symptoms can be remedied with usual tetanus treatments, as well as many commonly used pesticides. The effect on perception, as of the time of writing, appears to remain even after other symptoms cease.

**Recovery Log:** 
Multiple corpses were discovered in the garbage disposal units of a hospital in the town of [REDACTED], Iowa. The hospital staff claimed they had disposed of hedge sculptures that had been uprooted from public gardens, left in the hospital wards and dressed in hospital scrubs as a prank.

The first instance of SCP-2376-1 is believed to be an 8 year-old boy named █████ █████ from the neighboring town of [REDACTED], who died a week before the discovery at the hospital. █████'s father was tried for murder and acquitted with an insanity defense when he called the police reporting that the topiary he had finished trimming three days prior had been replaced with the mutilated body of his son. █████ was determined to have died of blood loss due to multiple lacerations from garden shears, but autopsy revealed the presence of the SCP-2376 pathogen in his bloodstream, and his father described that he suffered symptoms similar to those seen in the infection's first stage. 

**Addendum:** A variant of SCP-2376 has been discovered in [REDACTED], Arizona, which is transmitted by tarantulas. It has similar symptoms to SCP-2376 and an identical anomalous effect, save for that the infected are perceived as cacti. Due to the demonstrated capacity for mutation, reclassification to Keter has been suggested.
