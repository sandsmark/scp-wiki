[[tab Author Commentary]]

These here are just some of my thoughts, musings, and memories on some of the stuff I've made on the site. Most of them are just me recounting the process for making some of these articles, but they were honestly very fun to make, each and every one of them.

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-4645" hide="- SCP-4645"]]

[[[SCP-4645]]] was my very first article, and was so amazing to work on. It was an exciting yet somewhat nerve-wracking experience, going through the process. I was so stoked to get my first greenlights on the idea, from gee0765 and DrChandra on [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-12451232/absurd-blackmailing-computer this thread here], and I quickly set out drafting. It didn't start out so great, but over time, and with some amazing crit from Pedantique, I was able to turn it around and make it into something decent.

Posting it was easily one of the scariest things I've ever done. I'd been working at it for a week or two, and while I was proud of what I'd made, I was still really scared to post it. At one point, I took it to my dad, who told me he was a big fan of the draft. The next day, I decided to take a leap of faith and post it.

The rest is history! I was so happy to see that it was well-received, and was astonished to see it reach +100 within a few weeks. To this day, it remains my highest-rated article on the site, and is very close to hitting +200!

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-4456-D" hide="- SCP-4456-D"]]

[[[SCP-4456|SCP-4456-D]]] was my third article posted to the site, and I consider it to be one of my claims to fame here. It was inspired by multiple discussions about the Decommissioned object class and how it was used back in the day. What piqued my interest was that while the Decommissioned class was primarily an out-of-universe tool, the tales about it, as well as how affected objects would be documented (SCP-XXX-D), implied that it had a definition in-universe, separate from the Neutralized object class.

I began asking around, doing research, seeing if I could get a definitive answer. However, its status as an outdated staff tool meant that an in-universe definition was never clearly defined, leaving it sort of open in a way. The best interpretation I could come up with was that it was an object that was deliberately neutralized by the Foundation or a member of senior staff, rather than one that was destroyed accidentally.

As I thought about it, I wondered how people would respond to another SCP that was, to some degree, Decommissioned. The practice was considered outdated, of course, but it would be neat to apply it to a modern SCP article [[footnote]]Not a tale or anything, mind you.[[/footnote]] and see if I could make it work. I already had an idea for an SCP article about an asexually reproducing warship[[footnote]]Long story. Actually, not really. I thought of it and it was weird.[[/footnote]], and decided incorporate the Decommissioned class into it.

My first hurdle was coming up with an object that would necessitate destruction, since the Foundation rarely destroys SCP objects, without being something dangerous and uncontainable to the point of being ridiculous. I thought it would be fun to explore reasons that the Foundation would destroy an object, beyond it just being something difficult to contain. I decided to throw in a couple of unorthodox wrenches here, so to speak. Obviously, it would have to be something difficult to contain and whatnot, but I also made it both expensive to keep contained, and include a situation where containing it might actually be illegal to some extent. I thought of some other reasons a generic object might be Decommissioned, and threw them all together into a neat little checklist-type form you can see on the article.

My second hurdle was a combination of both in- and out-of-universe justification. The Decommissioned class hadn't been used in an extremely long time, and I would need to be able to fit it in an article naturally, beyond just some lolFoundation thing. And thus the Decommissioning Department was born: a department[[footnote]]Or sub-department, depending on your headcanon.[[/footnote]] dedicated to determining which objects necessitated destruction, as well as finding a way to do so effectively. I put my author avatar, Dr. C. Bold, as head of the department, mostly so I could really cement credit for this particular piece of the site.

After a lot of drafting and revising, I posted the article, along with a short tale about the Decommissioning Department. Sadly, the tale didn't survive, but the main SCP article did, and it thrived! It was my second article to reach +100, and the entire thing is something I'm quite proud I was able to pull off. Someday though, I'm gonna get back to that tale. Just you wait.

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-3448-J" hide="- SCP-3448-J"]]

[[[SCP-3448-J]]] was probably the fastest article I've ever made, drafted and posted in under a day. There's not much to say about it, honestly. But there are a few quirks that I enjoy. For starters, this wasn't originally going to be a -J. You might look at the cross-link[[footnote]]I'm not gonna spoil it, you have to read it yourself.[[/footnote]] and wonder how it //couldn't// be a -J, but that wasn't originally there either. But after a few critters, a lot of them agreed that it seemed like a -J. TheMightyMcB in particular thought it would make a good -J, and was actually the one who suggested that I include the cross-link.

SCP-3448-J is also my first and only[[footnote]]So far.[[/footnote]] article to have a video dedicated to it, courtesy of TheeSherm! I was ecstatic to learn that someone had made a video about my article, and I couldn't have been more grateful. If you're interested, the video can be found [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W07o4U3LM6Y&feature=youtu.be here].

[[collapsible show="+ Jam Contest 2020 Entries" hide="- Jam Contest 2020 Entries"]]

JamCon 2020 was the very first contest I participated in[[footnote]]While I was around for the SCP-5000 Contest, real life issues at the time meant I was unable to participate.[[/footnote]], and it was most certainly a challenge! Three articles in six days was most certainly difficult for me, but they were some of the most fun six days I've ever had, and I'm really grateful for the experience. Below are some short commentaries on each entry.

**[[[I Am Become Death]]]:** This was originally intended to be an 001 proposal, believe it or not! Unfortunately, while I was able to complete a full 001 draft, many critters agreed that it would probably be best if I spent more time on it. However, I was still able to get in an entry for the explosions theme. I was using ListPages for the draft, and as it turns out, many folks agreed that the first offset would make a nice short tale. A few adjustments later, I was able to enter an article, in the nick of time.

**[[[SCP-5559]]]:** Yeah, this was nutty, to say the least. I spent hours straight writing up this one, and I'm proud to say that it ended up being something really awesome. Not only is it the longest contest entry, it's also my longest article to date[[footnote]]I'm not counting this author page because a) it's ever-growing, and b) it's technically two author pages smushed together.[[/footnote]]! Ambrose was a bit of an obvious choice for the "Delicious" theme, but it was also cool to have them team up with the Foundation. It was also a nice excuse to use one of the [[[Theme:Calibri Logos|joint Foundation/GoI logos]]] somewhere.

**[[[UIU File: 2001-023]]]:** My very first GoI format! Working with the UIU format was a neat experience, and in my opinion, it really wasn't a far cry from the SCP format. As for the article itself, it was a fun little piece to make. Plenty of dialogue, characterization, and development for me to play around with. The actual idea was inspired by Scordatura in chat, and is a play on words of the theme, "More Than Meets The Eye," and instead writing "Moore Then Meets The Eye". However, it also fits the actual intent of the theme, and the main character might just be more than meets the eye.

[[tab Former Author Page (Archived)]]

So this here is my old author page. The reason I decided to make a new one isn't because I didn't like the other one, I was actually quite proud of it! That's why I'm putting it here, so that it can remain on the site in some form, and because I know a lot of you were fans of the old author page as well!

The reason I did a rewrite was because the format I had for the old one didn't really give all the information I wanted to on it. All it did was show my articles, with a bit of in-universe commentary, and a long tale to go through. The commentary also made it a hassle to update, since I'd have to write a new blurb for every new article. Once JamCon came around, I realized how impractical that was, and decided it would be best to just have an automatically updating list, with commentary where I really wanted it. Plus, I could include some personal info, the leaderboard, fan art, and some actually insightful thoughts.

Anyway, this was still a fun thing to make, and I do hope you enjoy reading it!

You approach the door and read the two signs on it. The first is a plaque; not terribly large or ostentatious, but noticeable.

Beneath the plaque is a sheet of paper, taped to the door:

[[div class="page"]]
[[=]]
+ Hey there! I'm not here right now, but if you need to drop off something, or you need anything in my office, just walk right in! Oh, and feel free to take some candy corn!
[[/=]]
[[/div]]

You shrug your shoulders and walk in. You only need to drop off a proposal, and you won't need to stay long.

The office is large, and you might even say grand, if it isn't for the fact that the it's totally cluttered. The desk at the far end of the room is covered in papers, and the only other space is reserved for a hefty computer setup, a game of Monopoly, a small bust of what appears to be Morgan Freeman, and a stuffed frog.

The space around the desk is less messy, but still a bit of a hodgepodge. A couple of filing cabinets flanks the it, and an immense bulletin board, as covered as the desk, hangs on the wall to your right. A chair rests in the center of the room.

The walls of the rest of the office seem to be where its grandeur lies. Bookshelves stretch to the far end of the room, where a floor-to-ceiling window lets the sun illuminate the space. Behind the desk is a massive portrait, presumedly of Dr. Bold himself.

You set the paper on the desk. It doesn't seem to matter where, and if Dr. Bold wanted his papers somewhere specific, he would have either told someone who would have told you, or he would have made his desk look nicer.

As you turn to leave, you notice something else on the desk: a large bowl of candy corn. You remember the invitation on the door and decide to take one.

It's good; you feel like having another.

You turn to leave.

"Not even going to say hello?"

You stop in your tracks. You swear you just heard Morgan Freeman ask you to greet him.

You turn to the most obvious source of the sound - the bust - and shout, "Hello?"

"Look to your right," said the voice.

You turn to your right; you're staring at the bookshelf now.

"Not that far right."

You slowly start turning left, until you hear Morgan Freeman say "Stop right there." You can tell the voice is coming from somewhere near the desk, at least.

"Now tilt your head just a little bit downwards."

You lower your head slowly until your eyes rest on the stuffed frog. "Attaboy," says the voice, now obviously originating from the frog.

"Um... hello," you say nervously.

"Well?" the frog asks. His Morgan Freeman voice sounds a little impatient, but the toy itself (well, himself, you guess) hasn't budged at all since you entered the room. It didn't even have a mouth to open. The voice just emanated. After you remain silent, the frog continues, "I mean, you could have a seat. Introduce yourself."

You hesitate a moment, then pull up a chair and sit down. "Um... nice to meet you."

"A pleasure to meet you as well," says the frog, "My name is Floppy."

You can see where he got the name. Instead of being plumped and full to bursting, like most stuffed animals, Floppy looked a little saggy.

"You can take a look around, if you'd like," says Floppy, "Cal won't mind, he loves it when people check out the stuff he's done."

You have a break right now, and the office looks interesting, but you're hesitant. "Are you sure?"

"Yeah, he loves to show off a bit. Even the unlocked files are open to visitors. Go on."

You stand up and take a look around. There are a lot of interesting-looking things to explore in here, the only question is where to start.

+ Foundation Personnel File: Dr. C. Bold
----
[[<]]
**Name:** Dr. C. Bold

**Clearance Level:** █

**Department Assignments:** Scientific, Decommissioning

**History:** Grew up in the United States as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and graduated from [REDACTED] with doctorates in particle and applied physics. Was recruited by the Foundation shortly afterwards as a containment specialist, though quickly showed proficiency in anomaly research. Later advocated for the reinstatement of the Decommissioned class, and was moved into its department following its creation.

**Disciplinary Notes:**
* Performing unauthorized experiments on SCP objects in attempts to create "Minecraft 2".
* Sharing classified information in a [http://www.scp-wiki.net/its-beginning-to-look-a-lot-like-eldritch Foundation-themed parody Christmas album] distributed to various personnel.
* Through unauthorized tampering with SCP-████, creating an alternate universe made entirely of an infinite pillow fort.

**Medical Notes:**
* Self-Nomenclature Semantic Disassociation Disorder: his full first name is unknown, due to the fact that his full first name cannot be associated with himself. The first three letters ("Cal") are the only associable portions of his first name. All official documents may refer to him as "Dr. C. Bold" or "Dr. Cal. Bold". Research is underway to determine the remaining portion of Dr. C. Bold's name.
* [[[SCP-212]]] Alterations: Eyes are constructed of crystalline material, though still function identically to previous eyes. All non-skeletal cells of right arm and a portion of torso have been replaced with a transparent substance that fulfills the function of replaced cells. Respiratory system now requires small amounts of cyanide gas to function; is equipped with mask and other devices to ensure proper administration of gas when required.

"So //that's// why we only get the first initial!" you exclaim. You look at the other interesting document. "Oh, hey. This one's about you, Floppy."

"Yeah," says Floppy, "I'm not interesting enough to warrant an SCP designation, so they let me stay here. Cal made me a document anyway, mostly for fun, but I appreciate it. He's still trying to get me approved for designation, thinks I'd be great as an official thing, especially since I can help out."

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-{$ITEM-NUM} operates from Dr. C. Bold's office as a site member. For official purposes, SCP-{$ITEM-NUM} has level 3 clearance and has access to information appropriate to his level and position.

**Description:** SCP-{$ITEM-NUM} is a toy stuffed frog that identifies with the name "Floppy". It is sapient, and possesses the ability to emanate a voice identified as that of celebrity Morgan Freeman.

While SCP-{$ITEM-NUM} has been in Foundation custody for several years, it has passed all loyalty tests given to it, and is being considered for Foundation membership.

You turn back to Floppy. "Well, this has been fun, but I think I need to get going."

You hear the door open and turn around. Walking in is a tall man wearing a lab coat and a baseball cap. Underneath his arm is an old-style gas mask. What catches your attention, however, is what's on his face: a pair of diamonds, swirling and spinning in sockets where there would have normally been eyes.

"Oh!" exclaims Dr. Bold, "I didn't realize anyone was visiting!"

"I'm just dropping something off," you reply, "Nice office though."

He smiles warmly. "Thank you! Sorry about the mess by the way, I've been meaning to clean up. Did you meet Floppy?"

"Yeah, great frog," you say.

Dr. Bold looks over at Floppy who simply comments "Cool person."

"Well, a friend of Floppy's is a friend of mine," says Dr. Bold. He extends his right hand - what appears to be only bone - and says "Call me Cal. And who would you be?"

You grasp his hand. True to the literature, you can feel warm, albeit invisible, skin around the bone. "My name is %%title%%," you say. The two of you shake hands for a brief moment.

"Well then, %%title%%, I look forward to working with you," says Cal.

"As do I," you reply. You wave a goodbye as you close the door.

You look at your phone and curse. Your break is almost over, and you need to be back in the lab soon. You take off down the hallway, not looking back.
