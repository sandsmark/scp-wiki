[[tab Author Commentary]]

These here are just some of my thoughts, musings, and memories on some of the stuff I've made on the site. Most of them are just me recounting the process for making some of these articles, but they were honestly very fun to make, each and every one of them.

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-4645" hide="- SCP-4645"]]

[[[SCP-4645]]] was my very first article, and was so amazing to work on. It was an exciting yet somewhat nerve-wracking experience, going through the process. I was so stoked to get my first greenlights on the idea, from gee0765 and DrChandra on [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-12451232/absurd-blackmailing-computer this thread here], and I quickly set out drafting. It didn't start out so great, but over time, and with some amazing crit from Pedantique, I was able to turn it around and make it into something decent.

Posting it was easily one of the scariest things I've ever done. I'd been working at it for a week or two, and while I was proud of what I'd made, I was still really scared to post it. At one point, I took it to my dad, who told me he was a big fan of the draft. The next day, I decided to take a leap of faith and post it.

The rest is history! I was so happy to see that it was well-received, and was astonished to see it reach +100 within a few weeks. To this day, it remains my highest-rated article on the site, and is very close to hitting +200!

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-4456-D" hide="- SCP-4456-D"]]

[[[SCP-4456|SCP-4456-D]]] was my third article posted to the site, and I consider it to be one of my claims to fame here. It was inspired by multiple discussions about the Decommissioned object class and how it was used back in the day. What piqued my interest was that while the Decommissioned class was primarily an out-of-universe tool, the tales about it, as well as how affected objects would be documented (SCP-XXX-D), implied that it had a definition in-universe, separate from the Neutralized object class.

I began asking around, doing research, seeing if I could get a definitive answer. However, its status as an outdated staff tool meant that an in-universe definition was never clearly defined, leaving it sort of open in a way. The best interpretation I could come up with was that it was an object that was deliberately neutralized by the Foundation or a member of senior staff, rather than one that was destroyed accidentally.

As I thought about it, I wondered how people would respond to another SCP that was, to some degree, Decommissioned. The practice was considered outdated, of course, but it would be neat to apply it to a modern SCP article [[footnote]]Not a tale or anything, mind you.[[/footnote]] and see if I could make it work. I already had an idea for an SCP article about an asexually reproducing warship[[footnote]]Long story. Actually, not really. I thought of it and it was weird.[[/footnote]], and decided incorporate the Decommissioned class into it.

My first hurdle was coming up with an object that would necessitate destruction, since the Foundation rarely destroys SCP objects, without being something dangerous and uncontainable to the point of being ridiculous. I thought it would be fun to explore reasons that the Foundation would destroy an object, beyond it just being something difficult to contain. I decided to throw in a couple of unorthodox wrenches here, so to speak. Obviously, it would have to be something difficult to contain and whatnot, but I also made it both expensive to keep contained, and include a situation where containing it might actually be illegal to some extent. I thought of some other reasons a generic object might be Decommissioned, and threw them all together into a neat little checklist-type form you can see on the article.

My second hurdle was a combination of both in- and out-of-universe justification. The Decommissioned class hadn't been used in an extremely long time, and I would need to be able to fit it in an article naturally, beyond just some lolFoundation thing. And thus the Decommissioning Department was born: a department[[footnote]]Or sub-department, depending on your headcanon.[[/footnote]] dedicated to determining which objects necessitated destruction, as well as finding a way to do so effectively. I put my author avatar, Dr. C. Bold, as head of the department, mostly so I could really cement credit for this particular piece of the site.

After a lot of drafting and revising, I posted the article, along with a short tale about the Decommissioning Department. Sadly, the tale didn't survive, but the main SCP article did, and it thrived! It was my second article to reach +100, and the entire thing is something I'm quite proud I was able to pull off. Someday though, I'm gonna get back to that tale. Just you wait.

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-3448-J" hide="- SCP-3448-J"]]

[[[SCP-3448-J]]] was probably the fastest article I've ever made, drafted and posted in under a day. There's not much to say about it, honestly. But there are a few quirks that I enjoy. For starters, this wasn't originally going to be a -J. You might look at the cross-link[[footnote]]I'm not gonna spoil it, you have to read it yourself.[[/footnote]] and wonder how it //couldn't// be a -J, but that wasn't originally there either. But after a few critters, a lot of them agreed that it seemed like a -J. TheMightyMcB in particular thought it would make a good -J, and was actually the one who suggested that I include the cross-link.

SCP-3448-J was also my first  article to have a video dedicated to it, courtesy of TheeSherm! I was ecstatic to learn that someone had made a video about my article, and I couldn't have been more grateful. If you're interested, the video can be found [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W07o4U3LM6Y&feature=youtu.be here].

[[collapsible show="+ Jam Contest 2020 Entries" hide="- Jam Contest 2020 Entries"]]

JamCon 2020 was the very first contest I participated in[[footnote]]While I was around for the SCP-5000 Contest, real life issues at the time meant I was unable to participate.[[/footnote]], and it was most certainly a challenge! Three articles in six days was most certainly difficult for me, but they were some of the most fun six days I've ever had, and I'm really grateful for the experience. Below are some short commentaries on each entry.

**[[[I Am Become Death]]]:** This was originally intended to be an 001 proposal, believe it or not! Unfortunately, while I was able to complete a full 001 draft, many critters agreed that it would probably be best if I spent more time on it. However, I was still able to get in an entry for the explosions theme. I was using ListPages for the draft, and as it turns out, many folks agreed that the first offset would make a nice short tale. A few adjustments later, I was able to enter an article, in the nick of time.

**[[[SCP-5559]]]:** Yeah, this was nutty, to say the least. I spent hours straight writing up this one, and I'm proud to say that it ended up being something really awesome. Not only is it the longest contest entry, it's also my longest article to date[[footnote]]I'm not counting this author page because a) it's ever-growing, and b) it's technically two author pages smushed together.[[/footnote]]! Ambrose was a bit of an obvious choice for the "Delicious" theme, but it was also cool to have them team up with the Foundation. It was also a nice excuse to use one of the [[[Theme:Calibri Logos|joint Foundation/GoI logos]]] somewhere.

**[[[UIU File: 2001-023]]]:** My very first GoI format! Working with the UIU format was a neat experience, and in my opinion, it really wasn't a far cry from the SCP format. As for the article itself, it was a fun little piece to make. Plenty of dialogue, characterization, and development for me to play around with. The actual idea was inspired by Scordatura in chat, and is a play on words of the theme, "More Than Meets The Eye," and instead writing "Moore Then Meets The Eye". However, it also fits the actual intent of the theme, and the main character might just be more than meets the eye.

**Use of Original Work:** Any of my articles, characters, or other on-site work can be referenced in articles or used in merchandise, as long as they are properly attributed. However, I strongly request that they are not used or applied in any NSFW work or other context.

**Reclaiming Authorship:** You guys all know what I look like (if you need a reminder, my face is in the first tab). I can confirm my identity if needed, and various users have enough of my personal information that they can further confirm my legitimacy.

**Emergency Contacts:** If I am desperately needed and cannot be reached over IRC or Wikidot, [[*user BlueJones]] has my Discord information, [[*user Mew-ltiverse]] has my Instagram information, and [[*user KaraKatt]] has my phone number; they can reach out to me for you.

This tab is just for testing code or whatever that I can't test on a sandbox.
