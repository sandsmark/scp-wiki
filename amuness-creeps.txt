**Name:** Amuness Trovolock Creeps

**Alias:** The Creeps

**Clearance Level:** 2

**Location:** Site-48

**Occupation:** Dimension traveler 

**Species:** Scarlet Beholder-type

**Age:** ██

**Background:** Amuness Creeps was recovered by Dr. Bridge during an incident where Amuness flipped off the ocean and was attacked by a bunch of sea urchins. The sea urchins then charged after Amuness, and he nearly died.

[REDACTED] had planned to place Amuness Creeps on Keter Duty, however, since he's a reality bender, he killed the sea urchins by [DATA EXPUNGED] and made a rip in the fabric of space. He also apologized and everyone was happy once more. He built Site-48 around the rip so that he could plan to fix that one day. Amuness built Site-48 with his ##red|//**DAMN BARE HANDS!**//## 

Afterwards, he tried to go out on his own to get more SCPs in Site-48 so it doesn't become bankrupt. He failed. Amuness then accidentally spilled water on Researcher ████ and was demoted to Level 0.

Amuness lost SCP-001 in a space-time vortex [DATA EXPUNGED].

He then went AWOL and joined the Chaos Insurgency for not being given his daily dose of pretzels. The CI threw him out immediately and The Foundation accepted him because he joined and quit the Foundation so fast that they didn't notice.

Tried to join Are We Cool Yet? Wasn't cool enough. But he was told he was not so hot. He was happy about that.

His ideas glowed for Site-48; with the ideas brighter than Dr. Moon and his enthusiasm stronger //than those black paper clip holding things that you used to put on your finger as a kid and they fucking hurt.// He found [http://www.scp-wiki.net/personnel-file-for-dr-evan-walker Dr. Evan Walker] and asked him for help through a pay phone. Together they discovered and contained [[[SCP-2341]]]. He was promoted to Level 1 clearance for doing a good job. He also become good friends with Dr. Walker!

Afterwards, he was fucking around in his [http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/amuness-creeps insanity room], locating more anomalies so that he can become more helpful ,,i guess. guys is this seriously the script >_> like I don't mean to-- ok put the gun down I'll do it i'll do it //sheesh//,,

Amuness Creeps then found [http://www.scp-wiki.net/daveyoufool a drunk fool] and discovered an annoying alarm clock in his bed. He contained it and classified it as [[[SCP-2341-J]]]. The fool was happy since it was contained as it was very annoying. Amuness Creeps then went through an emotional state and collapsed...

...in exhaustion. [http://www.scp-wiki.net/researcher-voct-s-personnel-file Researcher Voct] discovered Amuness Creeps and [http://www.scp-wiki.net/hysteria Dr. Hysteria] trying to re-contain an out-of-control time loop called [[[SCP-694]]]. Voct cracked his fingers and re-contained dat shit **like a boss.**

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/agent-strelnikov-s-personnel-file Waxx] was impressed by Amuness Creeps's great work and had asked him if he would like to be his personal assistant in moving boxes 'n' stuff around. He agreed.

And that kids is How I Got to Memphis!

SCP-2341 is based off of the idea of my sister returning home from college. Or some of it at least. I really wanted a form of safe place for me to go to as a kid. That became this SCP. I had these day dreams as a kid (I think?) where I would rise out of the ocean and find my house sitting on the water. Literally. And when I entered everyone was happy to see me and I was safe from...who knows WHAT out there in the scary ocean. 

Fun fact: DreamwalkerFae created the term //Scarlet Beholder-type.// It's a form of reality bender that was used during the early stages of writing.

It's a collaboration I did with daveyoufool. --No seriously, I hate my alarm clock //so much// that it doesn't deserve commentary.-- I mean, we all have that one pet peeve: our alarm clock annoying that shit out of us. I know I do. //Ohhh that things I would do to that alarm clock~//

Daveyoufool really helped me out by recreating the article that it is now. And that project was rotting in my sandbox, let me tell you.

Originally, this SCP was //suppose// to be my 2^^nd^^ SCP. It was also suppose to be a Neutralized class SCP. A reality bender known as F.Q. was planned to be in it. But I don't really want to talk about that character since he is not being used anymore.

This SCP is one of the best I've made. It took a lot longer than any of other SCPs, so this was a big project. I really thank Voct for helping me with the article. He was an incredible help. Hysteria was really great to work with, even though he dropped out in the beta stages of the draft.

The idea for this SCP came out of nowhere. I was walking one day at camp and out of nowhere I got: "Eureka!" I always wanted to do a time loop that involved trying to get something you loved back. I remember happening to me as a kid. It scared me because I had a sense of hopelessness. That's //not// what the article aim towards, but //heeeey...//

[[tab Site-48]]

I know I said it [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-1373498/your-characters#post-2379977 here,] but might as well place it on my author page.

**Dr. Bennet Smith:** No one quite knows where he comes from, but he's a very depressed man and often quite lonely. He has black messy hair and looks like he didn't take a shower every other day of his life. He is strict and cold; not so much that he's being mean because he treats everyone fair. Even when someone is having trouble with an escaped Class-D he literally does it himself cause he's //very// passive aggressive.

**Researcher Andrew:** He's the head researcher at Site-48 and has a lot of knowledge on Reailty Benders (or Scarlet Beholder-types, as they're called that at Site-48.) He's smart, but sometimes ignorant to things or people around him. However, he means very well. He's tall, has kinda dirty blonde hair, and looks almost like to IRL deadlymoose (as I have mentally picture him). 

**Agent Saggio:** A very tough guy. Hispanic and commands all of the Zeta MTFs at Site-48. Doesn't like to be seen weak and has a fear of being weak or hopeless. Somewhat of a dull person. He protects anyone in immediate danger and is a soft guy on the inside.

**D-1169:** A joke character. D-1169 is used for all tests in Site-48 and dies in nearly all of them. But the gag about it is that he's still alive. I thought of this because every author differs from one another and may use the number "1169" in their SCP. So, that's why I makes him die so much because sometimes readers might not know it's my work and they say: "Wow. This guy keeps dying a lot."

**Other Characters:**

**Susan and Fitzgerald** Two mysterious people that Foundation do not know about...yet.

**Tattered Man:** a character that will appear in SCP-████ and SCP-███. He's a reality bender and helps Susan during The End of Times. 

**Alexander Lang and Philip Lang:** SCP-694-1 and SCP-694-2. No one knows who these people are and what they were doing in Vermont. The Foundation (mostly Dr. Smith) is curious to find out what Alexander is capable of. Too bad that won't happen since he's trapped in a time loop! Philip Lang is Alexander's son and is just as strange as his father.
