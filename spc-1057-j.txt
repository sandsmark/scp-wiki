**Item #:** SCP-1057-J

**Shark Punching Contingencies:** SCP-1057-J is to remain in the Lap Pool at Recreation Center 23 until a method of transfer to a smaller, private tank has been devised. In the interim, the Lap Pool is to be closed, and members redirected to Recreation Center 22 for aquatic training.

**Description:** SCP-1057-J refers to an animate empty space in the shape of a tiger shark. It has no solid physical components, but is capable of displacing water through an unknown mechanism. While no one has observed SCP-1057-J consuming food, early punching attempts show that it is capable of biting hands (See Acquisition Log). It is conjectured that SCP-1057-J is remarkably smug about this.

Despite a lack of selachian anatomy, the SCP Athletic Counsel has voted to designate SCP-1057-J as a standard selachian threat. The Counsel's comments are below:

> //While some may argue that SCP-1057-J is literally a lack of a shark, we have decided that this does fall in of line with the central mission of the SCP. It looks like a shark. It bites like a shark. Most surely it can be punched like a shark. We will continue our innovations in Fist Integrated Stimulation Technology until SCP-1057-J receives the right hook it deserves.//

**Aquisition:** SCP-1057-J was discovered within the Lap Pool at Recreation Center 23. Two SCP personnel were killed, and fourteen were injured during various attempts to punch SCP-1057-J. Unfortunately, all such attempts failed, due to the lack of physical shark within the pool. During further examination of the Recreation Center bulletin boards, Document 1057-S24 was located.
