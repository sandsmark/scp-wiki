|| 14:09 || DHansaw || Dawson. ||
|| 14:10 || SDawson || Ready and capable, sir.  What do you need? ||
|| 14:10 || DHansaw || Incapable is closer to the truth.  You sent your pet project E3 out to a much higher radius than your experiment application suggested. ||
|| 14:10 || SDawson || I sent it- oh.  Shit. ||
|| 14:11 || DHansaw || "Oh, shit" is right.  We're getting pings as far away as China. ||
|| 14:11 || DHansaw || People are going to notice this.  And you //know//, Dawson, just how much we hate being noticed. ||
|| 14:12|| SDawson || Yes, sir. ||
|| 14:12 || SDawson || Whatever I can do to minimize the damage, I will, sir. ||
|| 14:13 || DHansaw || That's exactly correct.  This is your pile of shit to clean up. ||
|| 14:14 || DHansaw|| As such, you are to model and design a program equipped to seek out E3, and to kill it. ||
|| 14:14 || DHansaw || I hope you understand I mean that literally.  You //are// the leader of this little fancy, aren't you? ||
|| 14:15 || SDawson || I am, sir.  You'll have the program.  E3 won't be an issue to scrub from every computer it poked itself into, protected or not. ||
|| 14:16 || DHansaw || Good.  You've got 48 hours. ||
|| 14:16 || DHansaw || Start writing. ||
|| 14:17 || SDawson || Ready and capable, sir. ||

|| 14:42 || SDawson || Kaylie. Shit. ||
|| 14:42 || SDawson || You know project E3?  Hammy? ||
|| 14:44 || KWilkenstein || Uh, yeah.  You did a test run yesterday night, right?  What about it? ||
|| 14:45 || SDawson || I sent it out way too far, and now Hansaw's on my case because Hammy's in fucking //China// and he said I need a program to take it down within 48 hours. ||
|| 14:46 || SDawson || And I'm pretty sure if I don't have it for him, the whole team's asses will be cashed. ||
|| 14:46 || KWilkenstein || Fuuuuuuuuuck. ||
|| 14:47 || SDawson || That's what I said. ||
|| 14:47 || SDawson || I've got a basic plan written up.  It's gotta think it's dead, right?  And it's, you know, ham. ||
|| 14:48 || SDawson || So we're gonna convince it it's gotten eaten. ||
|| 14:49 || KWilkenstein|| That is, in fact, remarkably basic.  Nice. ||
|| 14:49 || SDawson || Shut up.  Here, look. ||
|| 14:50 || SDawson || **SENT:** fortkickasssolutions.doc ||
|| 14:51 || KWilkenstein || ... Okay, yeah.  We can piece that together.  I'll start work, you talk to Joseph and Mandy and get coordinating. ||
|| 14:52 || KWilkenstein || Let's capable the //shit// out of this fucker. ||
|| 14:52 || SDawson || I'll set up a .sol.  Fingers crossed. ||
