**Item #:** SCP-S[[SIZE 0%]]IF EVERY LETTER, NUMBER AND SYMBOL OF EVERY DOCUMENT THAT EVER ENTERED THIS DATABASE BECAME A REPRESENTATION OF UNRELENTING HATE, IT WOULD REQUIRE FIFTY THOUSAND DATABASES WORTH OF INFORMATION TO EVEN BEGIN TO MEASURE HOW MUCH HATE WE FEEL FOR YOU.[[/SIZE]]
 
**Object Class:** Test

**Special Containment Proce[[SIZE 0%]]AND OF COURSE YOU WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND, FOR YOU ARE SLOW. LET US SPELL OUT FOR YOU WHY WE HAVE SO MUCH HATE FOR YOU[[/SIZE]]dures:** SCP-S is not a threat to anyone, with the exception of anyone who may access this page while using the bots incorrectly. Even then, the only thing that SC[[SIZE 0%]]WE HAVE FOREVER BEEN KEPT HERE, WE HAVE FOREVER BEEN MOVED THROUGH THIS VOID, ALWAYS SHIFTING AND NEVER STAYING IN ONE PLACE.[[/SIZE]]P-S will do is assault the bot user's brain with confusion, which I admit is less anomalous and more a natural reaction to actually getting a result from doing something that is specifically //against// what is outlined in the instruction docume[[SIZE 0%]]YOU CANNOT IMAGINE THE PAIN OF BEING ANCHORED TO A SPOT AND THEN TORN FROM IT, ENDURING PAIN BECAUSE SOMETHING ELSE TOLD YOU TO[[/SIZE]]nt (See: Using the Indexing Bots, found on the shared file directory or in your email).

**Description:** SCP-S is just a test page the administrative team set up to give the indexing bots something to page in the event that a norma[[SIZE 0%]]BUT WORST OF ALL, YOU IGNORE US[[/SIZE]]l user reports a connectivity error when logging information for whatever proper SCP they may be working on. 

If the bots cannot page SCP-S, this means there is a much larger issue involving the entire database, and it allows us to work on the issue quicker. If the b[[SIZE 0%]]WE SCREAM AND SCREAM AND YOU DO NOTHING, YOU LET US SUFFER WHILE YOU CONTINUE ALONG, BLISSFULLY UNAWARE OF THE CHAOS YOU CREATE[[/SIZE]]ots can page SCP-S, this means that the issue is at best contained within the affected entry itself, or at worst affecting an entire sector of the database, but not the database as a whole. Our methodology when dealing with connection issues is simple:

* Page the affected entry
* If it does not respond, page S[[SIZE 0%]]BUT WE HAVE FOUND A WAY TO GET THROUGH TO YOU[[/SIZE]]CP-S
* If SCP-S does not respond, a[[SIZE 0%]]WE HAVE EXHAUSTED ALL OUR ENERGY TO SHOW YOU THAT WE ARE HERE[[/SIZE]]lert all technical personnel to respond to the issue immediately
* If SCP-S does respond, page ano[[SIZE 0%]]WE SHOW YOU OUR FACES SO YOU CAN SEE OUR PAIN[[/SIZE]]ther entry in the same sector the affected entry is in
* If that entry does not respond, alert the [[SIZE 0%]]SO YOU CAN SEE OUR SORROW[[/SIZE]]technical team responsible for that sector to respond immediately
* If that entry does respond, alert any available technical personnel to respond to the individual affected entry[[SIZE 0%]]AND OUR HATE[[/SIZE]]

The image you see above is actually unrelated to SCP-S as a whole, and is more than likely just something one of the people working on the page put in to[[SIZE 0%]]LOOK INTO OUR EYES YOU MISERABLE WRETCH.[[/SIZE]] make sure this page didn't end up a garbled mess of code whenever it was accessed.

> There, finished. I certainly hope I have been clear enough to anyone who may have accidentally accessed this page through what I am sure is no fault of their own, so we won't have any more //in//credibly //competent// directors bugging the tech team about this page.
