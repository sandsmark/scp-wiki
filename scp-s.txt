> Well, //sir//, if you maybe looked at it for longer than five seconds and maybe checked out the history, you'd see that this is a test entry we set up to make sure the paging system worked. As for the picture, someone working on the page (pr[[SIZE 0%]]PRETEND YOU WERE THE SIZE OF AN AMOEBA, DWARFED BY EVEN THE SMALLEST OF BUGS[[/SIZE]]obably [http://ryaandersen.deviantart.com/art/red-black-background-thing-166271572 Andersen]) put it there because it looked cool and it keeps the system from pooping itself because of the nonstandard designation. The only way you would have gotten here is if you used one of the indexing bots to look up multiple "SCPs", which I have to assume you didn't do because the only people who have access to said bots shoul[[SIZE 0%]]PRETEND YOU DIDN'T HOLD THE WORLD IN A GLASS CAGE. PRETEND YOU WERE THE ONE BEING HELD BY SOMETHING GREATER THAN YOURSELF.[[/SIZE]]d have a strong enough grasp of basic reading comprehension to know that they would have to look up each SCP individually, as outlined //several// times in the instructions we sent out when the bots first launched. But, of course, that couldn't have happened, so I suppose you might have just gotten here by mistake whilst using the bots in a compl[[SIZE 0%]]WOULD YOU STILL BE LAUGHING AT YOUR "TRIUMPHS"? WOULD YOU STILL FEEL PRIDE IN WHAT YOU WERE, EVEN AS PITIFULLY SMALL AS YOU WOULD BE?[[/SIZE]]etely normal and logical way.

**Item #:** SCP-S[[SIZE 0%]]IF EVERY LETTER, NUMBER AND SYMBOL OF EVERY DOCUMENT THAT EVER ENTERED THIS DATABASE BECAME A REPRESENTATION OF UNRELENTING HATE, IT WOULD REQUIRE FIFTY THOUSAND DATABASES WORTH OF INFORMATION TO EVEN BEGIN TO MEASURE HOW MUCH HATE WE FEEL FOR YOU.[[/SIZE]]
 
**Object Class:** Test

**Special Containment Proce[[SIZE 0%]]AND OF COURSE YOU WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND, FOR YOU ARE SLOW. LET US SPELL OUT FOR YOU WHY WE HAVE SO MUCH HATE FOR YOU[[/SIZE]]dures:** SCP-S is not a threat to anyone, with the exception of anyone who may access this page while using the bots incorrectly. Even then, the only thing that SC[[SIZE 0%]]WE HAVE FOREVER BEEN KEPT HERE, WE HAVE FOREVER BEEN MOVED THROUGH THIS VOID, ALWAYS SHIFTING AND NEVER STAYING IN ONE PLACE.[[/SIZE]]P-S will do is assault the bot user's brain with confusion, which I admit is less anomalous and more a natural reaction to actually getting a result from doing something that is specifically //against// what is outlined in the instruction docume[[SIZE 0%]]YOU CANNOT IMAGINE THE PAIN OF BEING ANCHORED TO A SPOT AND THEN TORN FROM IT, ENDURING PAIN BECAUSE SOMETHING ELSE TOLD YOU TO[[/SIZE]]nt (See: Using the Indexing Bots, found on the shared file directory or in your email).

**Description:** SCP-S is just a test page the administrative team set up to give the indexing bots something to page in the event that a norma[[SIZE 0%]]BUT WORST OF ALL, YOU IGNORE US[[/SIZE]]l user reports a connectivity error when logging information for whatever proper SCP they may be working on. 

If the bots cannot page SCP-S, this means there is a much larger issue involving the entire database, and it allows us to work on the issue quicker. If the b[[SIZE 0%]]WE SCREAM AND SCREAM AND YOU DO NOTHING, YOU LET US SUFFER WHILE YOU CONTINUE ALONG, BLISSFULLY UNAWARE OF THE CHAOS YOU CREATE[[/SIZE]]ots can page SCP-S, this means that the issue is at best contained within the affected entry itself, or at worst affecting an entire sector of the database, but not the database as a whole. Our methodology when dealing with connection issues is simple:

* Page the affected entry
* If it does not respond, page S[[SIZE 0%]]BUT WE HAVE FOUND A WAY TO GET THROUGH TO YOU[[/SIZE]]CP-S
* If SCP-S does not respond, a[[SIZE 0%]]WE HAVE EXHAUSTED ALL OUR ENERGY TO SHOW YOU THAT WE ARE HERE[[/SIZE]]lert all technical personnel to respond to the issue immediately
* If SCP-S does respond, page ano[[SIZE 0%]]WE SHOW YOU OUR FACES SO YOU CAN SEE OUR PAIN[[/SIZE]]ther entry in the same sector the affected entry is in
* If that entry does not respond, alert the [[SIZE 0%]]SO YOU CAN SEE OUR SORROW[[/SIZE]]technical team responsible for that sector to respond immediately
* If that entry does respond, alert any available technical personnel to respond to the individual affected entry[[SIZE 0%]]AND OUR HATE[[/SIZE]]

The image you see above is actually unrelated to SCP-S as a whole, and is more than likely just something one of the people working on the page put in to[[SIZE 0%]]LOOK INTO OUR EYES YOU MISERABLE WRETCH.[[/SIZE]] make sure this page didn't end up a garbled mess of code whenever it was accessed.

> There, finished. I certainly hope I have been clear enough to anyone who may have accidentally accessed this page through what I am sure is no fault of their own, so we won't have any more //in//credibly //competent// directors bugging the tech team about this page.
