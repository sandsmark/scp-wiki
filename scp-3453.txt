**Item #:** SCP-3453

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-3453 is assigned a storage container in Site-11.--
Special Containment Procedures for SCP-3453 have yet to be finalized. Past containment attempts are detailed below. MTF Beta-7 ("Maz Hatters") is to focus on keeping SCP-3453 away from the public eye with an array of containment equipment developed by the SCP-3453 Research Team. 

**Description:** SCP-3453 is 250mL of orange juice that is in constant motion. While SCP-3453's movements are unpredictable it has always been observed as a continuous whole[[footnote]]In layman's terms, this means that SCP-3453 has not been observed separating into multiple distinct volumes of liquid.[[/footnote]]. 

SCP-3453 was first discovered at Bridgewater Elementary in Idaho Falls, Idaho, where SCP-3453 ejected itself out of its container through a straw and into a student's face. SCP-3453 then moved erratically for 2 hours before going down a sewer drain. 623 individuals were amnesticized with Class C amnestics and 15 video recordings of SCP-3453 were confiscated. SCP-3453 was later contained and transferred to Site-11, where it remained in its containment chamber for 1 month and 46 hours before breaching containment. 

Since then, SCP-3453 has consistently escaped every containment chamber that has been devised[[footnote]]As of 7/16/2018, SCP-3453 has escaped from 368 unique containment units[[/footnote]]. SCP-3453 will spend approximately 3 months, on average, in a given containment unit before breaching containment. Furthermore, SCP-3453 has a record of escaping from re-used containment chambers within a matter of hours. Tests into its sentience remain inconclusive.

> **Containment Strategy 3453.1:**
> 
> **Containment Procedure:**
> SCP-3453 was enclosed in a watertight containment unit capable of holding 500mL of liquid.
> 
> **Containment Time:** 
> 1 month and 46 hours
> 
> **Containment Breach Record:**
> Over the course of its containment SCP-3453 created and escaped through a 128nm crack in its container.

> **Containment Strategy 3453.2:**
> 
> **Containment Procedure:**
> SCP-3453 was enclosed in a watertight containment unit capable of holding 500mL of liquid, with 200cm thick walls.
> 
> **Containment Time:** 
> 2 months, 3 days, and 1 hour.
> 
> **Containment Breach Record:**
> SCP-3453 heated up to a sufficient temperature to cause its containment unit to explode.[[footnote]]The exact temperature could not be determined by thermal scans.[[/footnote]] SCP-3453 quickly cooled down to room temperature and proceeded to wander around Site-11. This event also resulted in the breaches of SCP-████ and SCP-████ as well as 2 casualties of Foundation personnel. All three objects were later re-contained without any additional issues.

> **Containment Strategy 3453.14:**
> 
> **Containment Procedure:**
> SCP-3453 was enclosed in a 300cm thick airtight containment unit with the highest melting point available on-site.
> 
> **Containment Time:** 
> 6 months, 2 weeks, 3 days, and 4 hours.
> 
> **Containment Breach Record:**
> SCP-3453 teleported 1.5 meters outside of its containment unit. This is the first time that SCP-3453 has been observed to teleport by the SCP-3453 Research Team.

> **Containment Strategy 3453.16:**
> 
> **Containment Procedure:**
> SCP-3453 was enclosed in a 300cm thick airtight containment unit with the highest melting point available on-site. This containment unit itself is enclosed in a blast resistant room with a Scrantron Reality Anchor, which could prevent teleportation from occurring. 
> 
> **Containment Time:**
> 6 months, 2 weeks, 3 days, and 5 hours.
> 
> **Containment Breach Record:**
> SCP-3453 teleported 1.5m outside of its containment unit. After 3 minutes of circling its containment unit at 10kph SCP-3453 teleported inside of the Scranton Reality Anchor, which proceeded to short-circuit and explode.

> //Notes: The Site Director has banned the use of SRAs for containment purposes. They also banned the use of cross-testing with other SCPs. Given the [[[scp-3127|morbidly interesting ways in which these tests have failed for other SCPs]]], I can't say I blame them. The SCP-3453 Research Team is going to take a more conservative approach from here on out. Specifically, we'll be focusing less on a permanent containment solution and more on minimizing the cost and impact of containment breaches.//

> **Containment Strategy 3453.20:**
> 
> **Containment Procedure:**
> SCP-3453 is to be transported to a different containment unit every 8 hours. 6 containment units have been created for this purpose. As a cost-saving measure, a containment unit will only be decommissioned and replaced when SCP-3453 has managed to escape it under 48 hours.
> 
> **Containment Time:** 
> 2 years, 3 months, 4 days, and 18 hours.
> 
> **Containment Breach Record:**
> SCP-3453 was contained successfully with an average of approximately 0.7 successful escape attempts per month. SCP-3453 has since then teleported outside of every containment unit devised in less than 48 hours.

> **Containment Strategy 3453.72:**
> 
> **Containment Procedure:**
> SCP-3453 is to be kept within Site-11 by MTF Beta-7 through an array of cost-effective and portable containment units and procedures. The SCP-3453 Research Team is to provide aid and support to MTF Beta-7. 
> 
> **Containment Time:** 
> 3 months, 4 days, and 18 hours.
> 
> **Containment Breach Record:**
> SCP-3453 eventually escaped Site-11 through a urinal in the men's restroom.
> 
> //Notes: As of writing this, SCP-3453 has been re-captured and brought back to Site-11 no less than 4 times. Each time that it has been brought back it appears to make a mad dash to the men's bathroom. Its last escape involved teleporting into the urinal. The bathroom has since been closed down, but that's really more of a temporary fix.//

> **Containment Strategy 3453.104:**
> 
> **Containment Procedure:**
> //ContAIner-3453//, a program dedicated to SCP-3453's containment, has been developed. //ContAIner-3453// is to assist in automatically producing self-driving containment units for the purpose of finding and capturing SCP-3453 in a safe and discreet manner. Since the artificial intelligence is a work in progress, MTF Beta-7 is expected to work with //ContAIner-3453// until it can be fully automated by the SCP-3453 Research Team.
> 
> This entry marks //ContAIner-3453//'s first successful containment attempt, which involved a derivative of Test 3453.14.
> 
> **Containment Time:** 
> 1 month, 1 week, and 2 hours.
> 
> **Containment Breach Record:**
> SCP-3453 teleported 2.4m outside of its containment unit. 

> **Containment Strategy 3453.368:**
> 
> **Containment Procedure:**
> The following note, copied verbatim, was written in a standard issue notebook:
> ------
> //I performed a statistical analysis of// ContAIner-3453's //containment efforts, and I'm seeing a slow but significant downward trend in average containment time. If my calculations are correct, I don't think that this program will last more than a decade at best. Eventually, this skip will just get bored of us all and leave The Foundation forever...//
> //I have an idea.//
> //Let the records show that SCP-3453's container is Reality. As long as SCP-3453 exists, it is contained.// 
> //~Junior Researcher Fine//
> ------
> 3 hours after this note was written SCP-3453 disappeared.
> 
> **Containment Time:** 
> N/A
> 
> **Containment Breach Record:**
> SCP-3453 could not be found for 4 months, 5 days, and 3 hours. SCP-3453's state of existence during this period could not be determined. SCP-3453 was discovered 534km from its place of disappearance by a group of 4 citizens in [REDACTED]. The group was amnesticized with Class C amnestics and their video recording was confiscated.
