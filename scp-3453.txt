**Item #:** SCP-3453

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- --Keter-- --Neutralized-- Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-3453 is assigned a storage container in Site-04.--
Special Containment Procedures for SCP-3453 have yet to be finalized. Past containment attempts are detailed below.

**Description:** SCP-3453 is 250mL of orange juice that is in constant motion. While SCP-3453's movements are unpredictable it has always been observed as a continuous whole[[footnote]]In laymen's terms, this means that SCP-3453 has not been observed separating into multiple distinct volumes of liquid.[[/footnote]]. Tests into its sentience remain inconclusive.

SCP-3453 was first discovered at █████████ Elementary in ██████, where SCP-3453 ejected itself out of its container through a straw and into a student's face. SCP-3453 then jumped up in the air, performed 3 loops, and moved erratically for 2 hours before going down a sewer drain. SCP-3453 was later contained and moved to Site-04. 623 individuals were amnesticized with Class C amnestics and 15 video recordings of SCP-3453 were expunged. Analysis of SCP-3453's original container has not shown any anomalous properties. 

**Addendum 3453.1:** 46 hours and 18 minutes after initial containment SCP-3453 escaped through a 128nm crack in its container. SCP-3453 then moved throughout Site-04, entering and exiting the containment chambers of SCP-███, SCP-████, SCP-████, and SCP-████ before leaving Site-04 through a urinal.

After being captured, SCP-3453 was placed in a 500cm thick watertight enclosure capable of holding 500mL of water and returned to its storage container. 

**Addendum 3453.2:** 52 hours and 8 minutes after its re-containment SCP-3453 heated up to a sufficient temperature to cause its containment unit to explode[[footnote]]The exact temperature could not be determined by thermal scans.[[/footnote]]. SCP-3453 quickly cooled down to room temperature and proceeded to wander around Site-04. This event also resulted in the breaches of SCP-████ and SCP-████ as well 2 casualties of Foundation personnel. All three SCPs were later re-contained without any additional issues.

//Perhaps SCP-3453 possesses the anomalous ability to know of its own containment. Why else would it heat up like that?// 
//~ Junior Research Assistant Fine//

After containment was re-established, SCP-3453 was moved to a 5m thick airtight containment unit with the highest melting point available on-site. Security staff in charge of SCP-3453 has been increased two-fold and have been provided with an assortment of temporary and easy to carry containers.

**Addendum 3453.3:** 47 days and 20 hours after its re-containment SCP-3453 teleported outside of its enclosure. It was re-contained after 13 minutes. 

As SCP-3453 appears to utilize previously unseen anomalous abilities when it has been contained for a sufficiently long period of time, a new form of containment has been devised. SCP-3453 is to be moved to a different containment unit every eight hours. There are currently six containment units created for this purpose. As a cost-saving measure, a containment unit will only be decommissioned and replaced when SCP-3453 has escaped it.

**Addendum 3453.4:** SCP-3453 was contained successfully for 3 months and 4 days with only 2 successful escapes. However, SCP-3453 has since then teleported outside of every containment unit devised in less than an hour, even those that it previously hasn't occupied. In addition, the temporary containment units utilized by security guards to capture SCP-3453 have become unusable for the same reason. SCP-3453 is currently uncontained but has so far stayed within Site-04. SCP-3453 has been reclassified as Keter. Doctors, researchers, and research assistants have been pulled from across Site-04 to brainstorm new containment strategies. 

**Addendum 3453.5:** During a brainstorm session, the following note was written:
//I have an idea. Let the records show that SCP-3453's container is Reality. As long as SCP-3453 exists, it is contained.// 
//~ Junior Research Assistant Fine//

42 hours after this note was written, SCP-3453 disappeared. SCP-3453 has been reclassified as Neutralized and Junior Research Assistant Fine has been reprimanded for his actions, which were taken without consultation.

**Addendum 3453.6:** 3 years, 5 months, 6 days, and 4 hours after SCP-3453's disappearance the Hubble Space Telescope recorded SCP-3453 appearing and moving around for 3 seconds, after which it disappeared. Foundation agents within NASA were able to expunge the video log and give non-Foundation observers Class C amnestics before it was released to the public. SCP-3453 has been reclassified as Keter.
