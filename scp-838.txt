**Item #:** SCP-838

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** To prevent SCP-838 from affecting civilians, Foundation agents are to be placed on the staff in charge of managing the classified ad section at major newspapers in the Chicago area. Alternatively, the cooperation of the newspaper may be obtained for similar purposes. No ads matching a form taken by SCP-838 are to be printed.

Members of SCP-838-1 are to be isolated for a period of no less than a week and during this time prevented from sleeping for more than 6 hours within any 24 hour period. At the end of this time, they are to be considered to have been released from the effects of SCP-838. The ad responsible is to be found and removed from any online or archived editions it is posted in. Civilians are then to be treated with Class A amnesiacs and released.

**Description:** SCP-838 is the collective term for a series of job ads appearing in newspapers in that print in the vicinity of Chicago and whatever agency is behind them. The nature of the job offered varies between instances, and have included accounting, management, and janitorial work, among others. These ads are entirely mundane unless responded to. Attempts to trace these classifieds have proven unsuccessful.

The next time a person who has responded to SCP-838 falls asleep, he or she immediately enters REM sleep. Upon awakening, the affected individuals report experiencing extremely vivid dreams of having had a job interview in a large windowless office building for the advertised job at a company called Pellus, Inc. Subjects deemed qualified are given a job. Anyone hired by Pellus, Inc. is to be considered part of SCP-838-1.

Thereafter, any time a member of SCP-838-1 sleeps, they report vivid dreams of working in what is believed to be the same building as the interview took place in. In these dreams, the workforce of Pellus seems to consist entirely of persons who have responded to SCP-838, with the possible exception of senior management, who correspond to no known individuals. Testing has shown that communication while asleep between members of SCP-838-1 is possible, indicating some degree of connectedness between the dreams.

The dreams caused by SCP-838 do not have the normal restorative effect sleep has. A "workday" for a member of SCP-838-1 seems to be 8 hours, resulting in an individual effectively receiving 8 fewer hours of rest. Consequently, if prevented from sleeping for more than 8 hours in a day for an extended period of time, a member of SCP-838-1 may be "fired", resulting in them no longer suffering the effects of SCP-838.

**Interview 838-5:**
> //Interview between Dr. Eisen and D-41157, who was an accountant before his conviction.
> **Dr. Eisen:** Hello, D-41157. Could you please state for how long you have been a member of SCP-838-1?
> **D-41157:** You had me read that damn ad three weeks ago.
> **Dr. Eisen:** What has been your experience when you sleep?
> **D-41157:** The dullest dreams I've ever had. In them, I'm an accountant for this Pellus company. And that's it. It's just like real life except I can't leave the building and there's no lunch.
> **Dr. Eisen:** What happens if you try to leave the building?
> **D-41157:** I just can't. There's no doors or windows. I'm not even sure if there's a first floor. No elevators.
> **Dr. Eisen:** And how do you feel, physically?
> **D-41157:** In my dreams, fine. Alert and energetic. But the rest of the time, I'm exhausted. Doctor, I'm sleeping thirteen hours a day and still waking up as tired as I've ever been. What's going on?
> **Dr. Eisen:** We are researching that. What kind of accounting work are you doing for them? What does Pellus do?
> **D-41157:** Funny thing, that. I don't know. As far as I can tell, Pellus does nothing besides employ people to keep it running. But that makes sense. It's not like they're real or anything. It's just a goddamn make-work hell!
