A phone rings somewhere in Wisconsin. They ready a room at the Hotel Pyramidion. Such a lovely place, such a lovely face, such a lovely feast. Martha's stewardship has ended, and clouds descend over a bucolic town. Sloth's Pit, Wisconsin is in danger.

Initiate the Subverted Mayberry Cadence.

A plague of straw men descend upon the town. Sloth's Pit is used to strangeness, but is not used to tragedy. They weep for forty days and forty nights for forty men and women, taken from this world. When you visit Rudy's, pour one out for the poor owner.

A witch, an alchemical consultant, and a vampire slayer take a walk in the woods. They have flame-broiled stakes with garlic and aqua regia. If only. Goats are omnivores, Goatmen even more so. Fear is a hell of a drug for any tulpa.

Not even the interior S & C Plastics is safe from the autumn leaves. The site is invaded by an unfair fairground. A picture is taken from the archives, and the archivist is taken out of the picture. Poor Isaiah Pickman. He never had a narrative chance.

Initiate the Cullen Culling program.

The Hubble Farm is a satellite in Sloth's Pit, but an important one. For generations, it's fed the Jack-o-Lantern and pie needs of the townsfolk. It's no Burnham orchard, but the Hubbles are friendly people, and have been for the past forty-eight years.

It's a pity their pumpkins are perverted by the 'pyre plague.

Four ghost hunters, traveling the country, in search of the paranormal. Much of it is faked or delusional, preying off of the beliefs of those the naive. Occasionally, they find something genuine. An actual medium is a rare find, but they have one. 

Now, they have found something far too genuine: Sloth's Pit, in the middle of a paranormal crisis.

More will come soon, sweetlings.
