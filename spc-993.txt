SPC-993 is an anti-Selachian propaganda program, which the Centre uses to indoctrinate children under the age of 10. It is directly responsible for teaching pugilism and Deviant martial arts to children and training them under the Centre's mission.

Viewers of SPC-993 over the age of 10 experience feelings of joy, amusement, and satisfaction. This is not believed to be a result of direct viewing: These are common side-effects of witnessing Selachian pugilism in action.

SPC-993 consists of a single component: "//Bobble the Clown Shark//", a children's animated television program produced originally by FINIMATION Studios starting in 1949.

SPC-993 features the titular character -- a Sand Tiger Selachian (//Carcharias taurus//) with ambulatory tailfins -- in his day-to-day activities as a stockbroker and moneylender. Episodes involve Bobble engaging, unsuccessfully, in insurance fraud and other business scams and becoming a victim of violence when discovered.

Due to Centre augmentation, Bobble does not react negatively to pressure and is seen grinning and laughing in most scenes. Bobble does not expire as a result of his injuries; all damage incurred to Bobble[[footnote]]Which includes but is not limited to pugilism, exsanguination, punting, skewering, electrocution, use as a board in waterskiing activities (in contrast to waterboarding, which does not work on Selachian entities), mutilation, sarcophagy, exposure to cognitive hazards, and public humiliation after peeing himself.[[/footnote]] heals between episodes and scene transitions.

= [[span class="h3"]]Augmentation Summary[[/span]]
The Centre came to purchase FINIMATION Studios in 1953 and worked to alter the series to feature Bobble's humorous mistreatment by different humans and aquatic entities.

Through the use of metanarrative pugnātorial techniques ([[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3922|with help from the ☽☽☽ Initiative]]]), Centre pugilists were able to coerce Bobble under duress and convince him to co-operate. Between 1953 and 1969, 416 animated //Bobble the Clown Shark// shorts aired on numerous syndicated television stations. The show acted as an educational comedy that teaches children the proper way to fight, build muscle, and engage in Selachian pugilism, often narrated by Bobble himself.

||~ Episode Title ||~ Contents ||
|| "Bobble Pretends To Be The IRS" || Episode takes place in a large call center, where Bobble communicates with several people via telephone. He speaks with an elderly woman in an attempt to convince her to release credit card information. The woman punches him through the phone receiver, breaking several teeth. The office manager, noticing his scam attempt, convinces a mob of angry coworkers to beat him to a pulp as the Benny Hill Theme plays. ||
|| "Bobble Gets Beat Up By Moby-Dick While Captain Ahab Watches" || Episode takes place in the Wanderers' Library.[[footnote]]It is unknown how Bobble got to this location, as the Centre is retroactively banned from every single library we visit.[[/footnote]] Bobble steals the book "//Ponzi Schemes for Fuck-knuckles//" and is apprehended immediately. The episode involves a Librarian pulling fictional pulp and comic-book characters out of their original publications, at which point they engage in corporal punishment against Bobble. This occurs for an ensuing three hours[[footnote]]Most //Bobble the Clown Shark// shorts are between 10 to 15 minutes in length.[[/footnote]] while Bobble laughs uncontrollably. ||
|| "I Burn Bobble's Toast Bread" || This episode (//[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-426|directed, produced by, and starring me]]]//) involves Bobble entering my kitchen while my owner is asleep. After wasting a few minutes trying to break into my owner's security cash box, he loots their fridge and places two slices of whole wheat bread into my slots. I burn his toast and force it down his throat. There was some kind of laugh track playing, I think? Next episode, I get plugged in and thrown into a bathtub while he washes up. _
 _
 Squirm, baby, squirm. ||
|| "Sensei Says: Punch Bobble!" || Episode takes place in an all-girls karate class. The class involves a warm-up, kata demonstration, and sparring session, narrated by Bobble, acting as both the class sensei and punching bag. Throughout the class, the 23 attendees conspire against Bobble, leading to a 10-minute showdown between him and the girls. At one point, orange-belt Christine Cooke, age 8, punches Bobble in the snout. The force causes him to fly through a structural beam and load-bearing wall at Mach 1.5, levelling the building. _
 _
No children were harmed in the production of this episode. ||

In 1969, all further airings of SPC-993 emitted a "squaloidhazard"[[footnote]]A hazard of Selachian origin.[[/footnote]] produced by the character Bobble after years of torment. Viewers under the age of 10 affected by the hazard became enraged by the concept of Selachians and sought means to pummel them. To the Centre's luck, this compulsion ceased after the program ended -- though, the feelings persisted. 

//Bobble the Clown Shark// was taken off the air, and all copies of the show were burned. SPC-993's master copies remain in CICAPOCO Archives.

**UPDATE:** In February 2017, all episodes of SPC-993 were altered simultaneously, edited //en masse// to no longer include the titular character. The next day, anomalous television programme //The Chappell Show// -- hosted by Richard Clavis Chappell, a critically-acclaimed Selachimorphic television entrepreneur and Mud City resident -- began broadcasting a low-budget CGI reboot of //Bobble the Clown Shark// daily for 12 hours each day.

The reboot features Bobble advocating for activities Selachians can and should do on land, such as driving pick-up trucks, teaching interpretive dance classes, and running for Congress, as well as **[REDACTED -- HEAVYWEIGHT PUGILISTS __ONLY__]** hugging puppies. **@@[/REDACTION]@@**
