title:Cotbg Bible Fragments
> Note:  The following are sections of text recovered from the body of what is assumed to be a member of “The Church of The Broken God.”  It is assumed they are part of a larger document or “Bible”, but due to the situation of its recovery, the bulk of this work has been lost.  No additional copies of this “bible” have been found on any “church” members captured by The Foundation, however it is safe to assume that these books were disposed of before or during capture, to prevent them from “falling into the hands of the infidel.”
> 
> The following texts were among the personal effects of one “Amanda ██████”, a 24 year old former college student.  Records show that she had very slight involvement with SCP-███, however this interaction was deemed insignificant, precluding the need for memory alteration beyond that of the basic “plane crash” cover story.  She withdrew from college several months later, and was listed as a “missing person” by her parents after three months of no contact.  It is assumed that, for the next two years, she remained with the “Church”.  On ███/██/██, a car filled with gasoline canisters and other incendiary devices crashed into “████████ Motors”, the public façade of Site ██.  Amanda ██████ was at the wheel, and died in the resulting explosion.
> 
> Site ██ suffered no damage from the initial attack, however five Agents and the entirety of “████████ Motors” were lost in the explosion.  The subsequent attack by “Church” members resulted in the total lockdown of Site ██ for eight hours, with minor security failures at the two major access points.  Investigation as to how the site’s location became known is ongoing.

…And behold, The Lord spoke unto me, in a voice both soft and terrible, but was silent to the unbeliever.  The Lord spoke “Come”, and I did, and I was afraid and fell to my knees, weeping.  I rose my hands, and asked “oh mighty Lord, what has become of thy body?  Why have you been undone?”  The Lord said unto me “Go, and restore me to glory, and I shall restore you in turn”.  The voice of God spoke to my heart, and I wept at both the Glory and the Shame of The Heart our Lord.  Thus I came…

…not afraid of The Lord, for He is as we are, broken and scattered.  As we restore the body of God, so we restore ourselves.  To join with the Lord is good.  As we give honor and worship to the Lord, so does He honor us.  To serve the Lord is good.  As we guard the Lord from harm, so does He…

…Holy, and do not speak of Him to The Unbeliever.  To do so is to profane God.  The Unbeliever trembles at the feet of The Lord, as we did in our ignorance, but will rise to shatter when we kneel to restore.  To allow…

…Not be consumed, as the Moth is to the Flame?  Without our bodies, how will we serve the Lord?”  I spoke unto him, holding to him a facet of the Spirit of God.  “The Lord consumes the Wicked, and brings the Holy to him.  To fear The Lord is to show the Wickedness of the heart.  To be Wicked under the will of God is to delay his Resurrection.  To delay His return is to join the Defilers in his eternal imprisonment.”  Daniel then wept and cried out, and tore at his flesh as the Spirit of God entered him, and ate from him his evil.  His Blasphemy was too great, and his wickedness too deep, and lo, The Lord did destroy all that he was, for all that he was Wicked.  His rotten shell was…

…very Body of The Lord, the home from which he was driven, the hollow shell to which the Broken God must be restored for his birth, as the seed is restored to the womb, and I cried out and wept with joy as I beheld the Glory.  I and the Acolytes of the Lord did go forward, and drove out the Wicked who had Imprisoned the Lord, and they did wail and weep at the retribution of God, and poured their blood in vain against the coming of God.  We tore down the wall that entombed the Lord, and found his flesh to be as that of a tomb, and called out for his direction and glory.  I walked in the body of the Lord, and was struck by his glory and greatness.  Great is the Broken God, and greater still will be his Restoration.  As we drew to the center of God, we found the remains of Him still soft and untainted, and did rejoice in it.  We worshiped in the Body of The Lord, and lo, His Spirit came to us and took from us three of our number and did consume them, and the others were afraid.  I spoke unto them: “Be not afraid of the Embrace of God, for He wishes only…
