**Item #:** SCP-3199

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** All live instances of SCP-3199 are to be contained on Site-114 within a Keter humanoid containment chamber, the walls of which should be coated in approximately 2 cm thick acid-resistant steel. Two meters of empty space are to be allocated between this cell and secondary containment.

Secondary containment consists of suspending all live instances of SCP-3199 inside a solid block of transparent substance (currently clear acrylic resin).

This block should be at a height of at least 3.1 meters, with one armed security guard stationed directly outside initial containment at all times. An eight-digit passcode can be obtained from the current Site-114 director in order to access the secondary containment and allow for close-up examination of SCP-3199's behaviour. CCTV equipment is, however, installed in one corner of the containment cell for remote observation.

The secondary containment block should be regularly examined for damages. Any sign of aggressive activity will be noted, and the current Site-114 Director informed at the earliest possible convenience.

Currently, recall protocol is undergoing evaluation, though a temporary procedure is detailed in Addendum 3199-03. Experiments involving the use of live SCP-3199 instances are strictly prohibited without approval from at least two personnel of Level-4 security clearance or above.
 
As of █/6/2017, there are four present and contained instances of SCP-3199.

**Description:** SCP-3199 is a sentient humanoid species of a currently unknown biological origin, though tissue samples suggest traces of domestic chicken (//Gallus gallus//) and chimpanzee (//Pan troglodytes//) DNA. Instances of SCP-3199 are hairless, stained with a thin layer of albumin, and stand at an average of 2.9 meters. Weight averages 780 kg for a matured instance, and 360 kg for a hatchling. The necks of SCP-3199 appear dislocated, and are capable of twisting approximately 340°, presumably due to the nature of SCP-3199's reproductive cycle. 

SCP-3199 are opportunistic hunters, engaging with live subjects --within a currently unidentified radius--  within a radius of roughly 0.6 kilometers around any young that have not yet reached full adolescence. Average speed is recorded at 25 km/h.  Upon contact with human or animal subjects, SCP-3199 will proceed to [REDACTED], liquefying internal organs and bone structure. The cadaver will be transported to the young and used as nourishment, accelerating their growth.

Instances of SCP-3199 have been observed producing large eggs of an off-white coloration and rubbery appearance. These eggs pass through the entity's stomach, esophagus and eventually out via the mouth, followed by a viscous red substance. (First thought to be some form of a placenta, chemical breakdown has determined it to be a highly corrosive material.) SCP-3199 shows extreme distress throughout the process, with personnel describing the sound as 'not dissimilar to a scream'. 

Presumably due to a biologically ingrained method of avoiding extinction, SCP-3199 produces its eggs to fill available space. This anomalous property currently has no known limit, and as a result may pose an LK-Class species transmutation scenario. Termination of SCP-3199 can be performed with relative ease. However, a complete eradication is currently --impossible-- difficult, as all instances of SCP-3199 (regardless of age) carry one egg inside their stomach, ensuring survival for a least one member of their species at all times.

Egg samples have proven to be very resilient, lacking visible signs of damage despite being subjected to:

⦁ Extreme blunt-force trauma.
⦁ Extensive pressure exceeding 180,000 psi.
⦁ High-precision blades. (Serrated and non-serrated)
⦁ Long-term acid exposure.

The use of point-blank explosives was suggested, but never fully tested. Heat exposure has been determined to accelerate hatch rates, and thus detonation may run the risk of a containment breach. (See Experiment Log 3199-A).
 
SCP-3199 was issued Keter classification on █/6/2017 following the events of a potential containment breach. SCP-3199's original water containment method was scrapped in favor of a solid, albeit more expensive resin solution.

**Addendum 3199-01:** On █/█/2017, O5-█ dispatched the following notice regarding SCP-3199: 
> //All experiments involving SCP-3199 egg samples are strictly prohibited until further notice. Hatching periods have proven too unreliable to warrant extensive research, and as the consequences of a containment breach become more and more apparent, the O5 Council have collectively decided to eliminate risks at the source and prevent testing until new information surfaces. We thank you for your cooperation.// 

SCP-3199 was discovered in ██████, Ireland after reports of an unidentified, 'bald' creature 'crying like a banshee' from inside a dense woodlands resulted in Recovery Team 114-6 being dispatched. Two personnel were lost in action, their internal organs and jaws having been almost entirely dissolved. During transportation, SCP-3199 produced two offspring, resulting in the deaths of a further six personnel. --It is entirely unknown how the first instance of SCP-3199 came into existence, and is suspected to be either the result of a genetic experiment or a form of extraterrestrial life. A thorough examination of the original capture site will be arranged at the earliest convenience.-- 
(See Addendum 3199-02).

[[collapsible show="+ Addendum 3199-02" hide="- Hide Addendum 3199-02"]]**Addendum 3199-02:** On █/█/2017, a thorough sweep of SCP-3199's Initial Recovery location was performed in an attempt to uncover any further information regarding their origin. Locals claimed that the small remote residence in question has been established in the woods for several years- though 'never caught enough interest for even the soddin' nosey teenagers to care about'. Surface team ████-029 recovered several objects of interest, including:
* One bag of assorted thread and needles, of various colors and sizes.
* Approximately thirteen chicken carcasses (based on the collective halves and quarters), with precise incisions located on the underbelly, neck, and thigh. Six of the carcasses had been plucked, with visible human teeth marks lining the bare areas seemingly at random.
* Crude containers, including discarded water bottles of no notable brand and Tupperware™ boxes, that held an unidentified watery paste. The paste is deep brown in color, and in the presence of oxygen became viscous and hardened. Substance is awaiting chemical breakdown.
* An A5 notebook, ████ brand, and heavily scratched with what was determined to be human fingernails. The words 'OPEN WHEN WE ARE PURE!!' are written on the front.
* Two chicken feather quills.

The notebook itself consisted of 24 pages of standard lined paper, written in non-anomalous black ink. 19 of these pages consisted of various cuboid patterns and crude, child-like illustrations resembling SCP-3199. On the remaining five pages, large lines of writing detail the diary of an unnamed individual. Most of what was written was found totally illegible. However, one extract in particular, dated ██/6/1973 was written with notably higher clarity:

> If you're reading this, then --luky-- lucky you! one millionth hour from not and it'll be fun fun fun, and the wonderful --vursatilli-- --vessa-- versatility of (INFERIOR) human DNA will give birth to a new era. A stronger ear. One where [ILLEGIBLE] and food and water will be nothing but things of the passed as we make and make and make more --until-- for the better future! [ILLEGIBLE]
> I REALLY HAVEN'T MUCH --TIM--
> TIME 
> THATS why i ENVY you so. you'll have all the time you need. time will be --a thing of the-- time will be on and on and death will be life. --life-- new life changes lives and brings the smiles like a freshness. new life will be a part of life from now on. (sic)

The final page consisted of several ink blots, thirteen instances of the word 'life' in various sizes, and two instances of the words 'didnt you want this?' (sic)[[/collapsible]]

**Addendum 3199-03:** //Protocol 34-22-B - 'Titanic'//

Regarding the re-containment of SCP-3199. The following procedure will occur in the event of a breach.
* On-site personnel with Level-1 security clearance or above assume standard lock-down procedure and immediately move to Site-113 unless instructed otherwise.
* Site-114 is to be filled entirely with distilled water, treated with Class A sedatives.
* Surface Team Tango-306-A will be notified and dispatched and instructed to retrieve any instances of SCP-3199's eggs.
* Any living instances of SCP-3199 will be terminated on sight, and their remaining eggs will be collected.
* All egg samples are to be transported to temporary off-site containment.
* Site-114 will then be drained, and janitorial staff dispatched to thoroughly clean the area. Personnel attempting to breach Site-114 before this inspection is complete will be apprehended and suspended accordingly.

**Note:** //Some personnel have displayed skepticism regarding the necessity of SCP-3199's current breach protocol. To elaborate, we have reason to believe that fluid is an excellent counter to SCP-3199's anomalous reproductive properties. It appears to enter an inert state in the presence of liquid, regardless of thickness or clarity. There are two theories regarding why this occurs:
 1. SCP-3199's need for survival demands all of its attention to focus on not drowning. It's possible we have found a loophole in its everlasting fight to thrive.
 2. SCP-3199 considers the liquid around is as 'full space', and as a result does not produce any young when submerged.
The former theory holds more water, as SCP-3199 appears to be totally inactive when submerged. For now, I believe I speak for all of Site-114 when I say it's a relief to at least have a consistent method of containment.

[[collapsible show="+ VIDEO LOG - INTERVIEW 3199-01" hide="- HIDE INTERVIEW 3199-01"]]**VIDEO LOG - INTERVIEW 3199-01:**
**Interviewer:** Dr. Ewing.
**Interviewed:** LCpl. ███████. Head of MTF ████ ██ 6-B, first to capture and detain SCP-3199 on Initial Recovery Mission 34-B. 
**Foreword:** Subject had undergone extensive psychiatric care prior to the interview, and while considered not responsible for the deaths of Pvt. ████ and Cpl. ████, admitted to having not performed the necessary precautions.
> 
> **LCpl. ███████:** Take a seat, right? 
> 
> **Dr. Ewing:** Please. If you would. 
> 
> [LCpl. ███████ clears his throat. White noise as he sits, visibly anxious.] 
> 
>**Dr. Ewing:** Could you explain your mission briefing? 
> 
> **LCpl. ███████:** The job was pretty simple. No auditory or visual triggers that the eggheads in Site-114 knew about. Seems to me as if they'd done a pretty top job scraping the area clean of anything we ought to know about. 
> 
> [LCpl. ███████ looks grave. He laughs dryly.] 
> 
> **LCpl. ███████:** Never is that easy though, huh ma'am? We landed around 2100 hours. Me and my crew had been told that if we couldn't catch the thing, the next best thing would be snapping a frame or two, so they- uh- they hooked us up with the best in night vision hardware.
> 
> [LCpl. ███████ shuffles uncomfortably in his seat.]
> 
> **LCpl. ███████:** ... and this is where you tell me, that... you already know about this, and you have the picture in question, right?
> 
> [Paper shuffling. Dr. Ewing looks grave.]
> 
> **Dr. Ewing:** You're under no obligation to view the recording.
> 
> **LCpl. ███████:** Nah, nah- I- I know that. Just shook me a little.
> 
> **Dr. Ewing:** Please. Go on.
> 
> **LCpl. ███████:** [Shivering.] We found something within the hour- almost like a shack, totally out of scrap metal and wood. Looked more like an over-sized chicken coop than anything else, but I don't think your new monster built it. Didn't look able to.
> 
> **Dr. Ewing:** Interesting, and I assume you-
> 
> **LCpl. ███████:** - entered ASAP? Of course, it was a late shift. Wanted this over as quick as possible. I'd like to say that's why I did what I did, but- uh- I can't bring myself to make excuses. 
> [A pause. LCpl. ███████ places his head in his hands and sighs.] I really- really fucked it, ma'am. Pardon my French.
> 
> **Dr. Ewing:** It's perfectly appropriate, all things considered. However, I'm going to have to ask you to continue explaining the procedure.
> 
> **LCpl. ███████:** Right, right, well- I had two of my men stationed at the back, or at least, what we guessed was the back. Pvt. ████ and Cpl. ████ insisted they take first charge. Fresh out of training, they were. Kids. I should be used to it by now, but-
> 
> [LCpl. ███████ chokes, leaning forward in his seat.]
> 
> **LCpl. ███████:** Never seen a smile get cut down so quick. It knew we were there, somehow. Jumped right at Pvt. ████ and [DATA EXPUNGED] the fuckin' teeth out of his head. I see it whenever I blink, ma'am. That's the shit that stays with you.
> 
> **Dr. Ewing:** I assure you, The Foundation will take every measure to ensure financial comfort for the families of your lost men. Could you elaborate on the other casualty?
> 
> [LCpl.  ███████ stares for a second or two, leaning back in his chair. A pause.]
> 
> **Dr. Ewing:** ███████? Please, I urge you to continue. The more we know, the more we can do to stop it from happening again.
> 
> **LCpl. ███████:** We barely had time to react before it started neckin' it down the corridor to the right. I guess the adrenaline had just about hit me, because I fired off enough rounds to blow a chunk out of its chest, just as it's ugly head was about to hit a corner. I saw-
> 
> [Another pause. LCpl. ███████ shows visible signs of distress.]
> 
> **LCpl. ███████:** I saw straight fuckin' moonlight on the other side. Bulls-eye. Thing let out the most awful scream. I have a beautiful little baby boy at home, doc. You know that?
> 
> **Dr. Ewing:** Irrelevant discussion of domestic life isn't necessary for this procedure, Lance Corporal. Could you please-
> 
> **LCpl. ███████:** [Raises voice, clearly agitated.] I have a beautiful baby boy who just loves wailin' when he gets a little food spilled on him, or when he's too cranky to sleep, and you know what? Every time he does, I think about that scream. See it poppin' into my head. Think what it did- and his pa gives him a look as if he's gonna bash his fuckin' head against the wall.
> 
> [LCpl. ███████, now standing, gradually sits back down. Trembling.]
> 
> **LCpl.** ███████: [Strained.] They were good men.
> 
> [LCpl. ███████ breathes deeply. A few seconds silence.]
> 
> **LCpl.** ███████: We're done here. Please, ████. Kill that monster. For me.
> 
> [White noise as LCpl. ███████ exits. Silence for the remainder of the recording.][[/collapsible]]

> //Note: I wish the very best to the families of those lost during SCP-3199’s Initial Recovery mission. Furthermore, I would like to formally request that LCpl. ███████ is administered one Class B amnestic at the earliest possible convenience. No excuses.

**SCP-3199 Experiment Logs**
 
[[collapsible show="+ 3199-A" hide="- Hide"]]**Experiment 3199-A - 'Intense Heat Exposure'** - █/█/2017

**Subject:** One egg sample from SCP-3199.

**Method:** Subject relocated to a secure containment cell. Inside temperature of the cell was gradually increased at an average rate of 7°C/minute.

**Results:** After approx. nine minutes, the egg ruptured violently and produced a single hatchling. On-site personnel reacted swiftly to re-contain the newborn instance. However, the excessive internal temperature impacted the physical growth of the young instance, and it reached adolescence at an accelerated rate of 40 seconds.

As a result, the (now adolescent) hatchling produced two more instances of SCP-3199. MTF Theta-██-██ responded quickly and efficiently, managing to detain all three instances. All future heat testing involving SCP-3199 egg samples has been forbidden until further notice.[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="+ 3199-B" hide="- Hide"]]**Experiment 3199-B - 'Liquid Nitrogen Bath'** - █/█/2017

**Subject:** One egg sample from SCP-3199.

**Method:** Subject submerged entirely in liquid nitrogen. MTF-Theta-██-██ remained on standby throughout the procedure after concern was raised regarding SCP-3199's eggs and heavy experimentation involving them.  After approximately 45 minutes of exposure, SCP-3199 had reached -190°C. After 2 hours of exposure, the egg sample was removed and placed under extreme pressure conditions.

**Results:** Hydraulic press peaked at pressures of around 9,000 psi. Cracks appeared 30 minutes into exposure before the sample shattered. Egg fragments were collected and furthermore pressed into a fine pulp. Incineration of these remains proved successful in eliminating any trace of SCP-3199's sample.

**Postscript:** //As Dr. Ewing once put so eloquently, let us not allow these small victories to distract from the larger picture- and whilst you may find the time to celebrate this discovery, we will not excuse apathy towards the entity itself.
-Dr. Watt//[[/collapsible]]
[[collapsible show="+ 3199-C" hide="- Hide"]]**Experiment 3199-C - 'Chemical Analysis of Shell'** - ██/█/2017

**Sample:** 10 grams of finely pressed eggshell pulp, taken from an SCP-3199 egg.

**Results:** Detailed chemical breakdown shows traces of nacre, enamel, and a currently unidentified carbon compound. Microscope analysis suggests that the shell itself is composed of tightly packed, organized crystals. Practical use of this material is currently undergoing consideration.[[/collapsible]]
