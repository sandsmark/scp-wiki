Research and Containment Team Δt is a transtemporal Foundation agency which was founded in 1998 to combat and correct a rising number of retrocausal, temporal, and counter historical anomalies which were appearing with alarming and increasing regularity.

In order to access historically accurate information on the recovery and containment history of various SCP objects, security clearance group “Δ” was created by Overwatch in response, and retroactively added to all Foundation clearance systems. In addition, past and future members of RCT-Δt were granted static access credentials in hopes that their continued ability to request that information across many Foundation epochs and managerial periods would further encourage trans-temporal Foundation cooperation. 

Unfortunately, this blanket permission and informational access has had the unpleasant side-effect of putting RCT-Δt, and by extension, the Temporal Anomalies Department, substantially outside of the normal Foundation command structure. And depending on the status of various other temporal threats, agents have still found themselves unrecognized as legitimate Foundation operatives, leading even those with clearance to know about the agency and its various departments to question the origin, purpose, and need for such an organization to exist. The discovery of several coherent and self-consistent causal sequences, or “strings” present within the baseline Foundation universe has further complicated this relationship.

It is unclear at this time whether the records contained under RCT-Δt’s temporal isolation protocols are genuine records of lost histories, or complete fabrications of an anomalous organization which has successfully infiltrated Foundation operations. Unfortunately, time will not, and //cannot// tell. It is, however, indisputable that RCT-Δt has made containment of several known temporal anomalies possible. The technology developed by this agency has proven indispensable to the preservation of normalcy, including, but not limited to, the development of the Constant Temporal Sink, and the subsequent discovery, containment, and maintenance of [[[SCP-2000]]].

Despite the controversy surrounding the agency’s existence, and the potential inclement information breaches it appears capable of causing, there are as yet no plans to terminate the RCT-Δt project.

Additional Δt information is available below.

[[tab Subdivisions]]

* **Temporal Intelligence Community (TIC)**: A group of Foundation assets in collaboration with other temporally active GOI’s for the purpose of identifying causal threats prior to their propagation.

* **Tactical Operations Command (TOC)**: MTF division of Δt, applies military tactics to contain, neutralize, or prevent such threats. Unit makes use of period appropriate weaponry and armor wherever possible.

* **Historical Continuity Division**: Field Agent operation using espionage tactics to ensure that key historical events remain consistent across Known Iterations (KI’s) of history. Often frustrated by activations of SCP-2000 and by the proliferation of causal strings which has accelerated since the mid 1970’s.

* **Applied Sciences Division**: Experimentation/Research division of RCT-Δt. Develops and refines temporal transit methods and containment strategies. Currently retains all known information on tachyon chromodynamics. Developed current and future causal isolation protocols, methods, and materials. Charged with holding all causally isolated documentation and materials.

* **Temporal Anomalies Department**: The forward-facing “umbrella” organization of RCT-Δt. The Department operates solely within the baseline causal string to contain temporal anomalies present therein. In truth, this is the smallest fraction of RCT-Δt, but serves as gatekeeper to the rest of the team's temporal operations in regards to recruitment of other Foundation professionals and procuring security clearances. In cases where Overwatch approval is required or advised, this is the organization to submit the request for it.

**Sex/Gender:** M/M

**D.O.B.:** 17/08/2415

**Height:** 1.90 m

**Weight:** 105 kg

**Age:** Unknown; Approx 90y (appears 40)

**Education:** PhD, Extradimensional Topology; PhD, Tachyon Chromodynamics; BS, Linguistics; BS, Cultural Anthropology; Foundation Self Defense/Deadly Force Certification.

**Personal History:** 
Born to Reginald and Agatha Xyank, status unknown. 

Educated at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), hired directly to Foundation Service at age 25 (Jun 2441) as a non-euclidean containment specialist. 

Promoted to [[[SCP-3109|Jr. Researcher]]] Dec 2451. 

Promoted to Sr. Researcher Mar 2458. Served as HMCL Supervisor for [[[SCP-5087]]] Mar 2485 - Dec 2458.

Temporally displaced from Dec 2458 to July 1978, along with [[[SCP-110]]], contained as SCP-110-1 until Jan 1992.

Reinstated to Foundation Service as Special Researcher with limited clearance. Served as HMCL Supervisor for [[[SCP-176]]] from Feb 1992 to May 1997. (See [[[Iteration 0|Breach Event 176-92-01]]])

Founded Temporal Anomalies Department Aug 1997 after demonstrating the Tachyon Field Model of causal relationships. (See [[[The Deep End|Extranormal Event 281/084-97-01]]])

Promoted to Sr. Researcher Aug 1997.

Oversaw invention first stable, reproducible bulk and personal temporal displacement methods, Dec 1997 (See [[[Erstwhile and Again|Experiment Log 281-9338-97]]]). Findings retroactively published in journal //Foundation//, Spring 1892 issue with co-author and inventor, Dr. Athena Anastasakos.

Advised primary containment and operating procedures of [[[SCP-2400]]] Apr 1998. Observed first known instance of stable ‘Grandfather Paradox’ as confirmed by Dr. Marcus Kitterman. (See [[[Exit History|Breach Report 2400-01-00]]])

Founded [[[Document 1780-WL|RCT-Δt]]], May 1998. Established first Permanent Causal Isolation Protocol, [[[SCP-1780|CIP-1780]]], pursuant to RCT-Δt Mission Statement.

Discovered and established primary containment of [[[SCP-4583]]] Aug 2003. Oversaw development of Compound 4583-L-Δ Sep 2003 - Jan 2004.

Finalized the design of the Xyank/Anastasakos Constant [[[The Kitchen Sink|Temporal Sink]]], Feb 2004. Device approved for [[[SCP-2000|retroactive service implementation]]].

**Psychological Profile:** 
Dr. Xyank exhibits a lot of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, and intense survivors guilt regarding the events surrounding his displacement and subsequent confinement. In our sessions, [[[Set Up Thine Altar Here|he has been vague on this point]]]. At times he appears comfortable with the 'sacrifices' he has made, and at others, it is difficult to imagine that he has ever slept a night in his life. But due to the nature of his work, I cannot be assured that I am seeing a linear representation of the man. It is difficult to determine if any progress is taking place at all. 

Furthermore, Thad suffers from a serious superiority complex. While he exhibits normal empathetic responses to situations, his sense of his own intellect makes it difficult for him to form lasting relationships with his peers. Shortly put, he believes that most people he interacts with are intellectually inferior, and that the Foundation as it currently operates is largely an obstacle to the expansion of human knowledge. The great irony is that, [[[20 GOTO 10|apart from some computational enhancements]]], he’s no smarter than most of the other researchers I work with. 

Overall, I’d say his mental health is about on par for other researchers at his clearance level. I don’t have any reservations clearing him for duty. Will check back once monthly, provided he can commit to seeing me //sequentially// from now on.

Flagged for Foundation Recruitment under Δ protocol. Hired Jun 1993 as Jr Researcher while completing PhD at Foundation front, Saratoga Carnegie/Pierce University.

Promoted to Researcher, May 1997.

Chosen for participation in [[[The Deep End|Experiment 281/084-97-1]]] in Aug 1997, confirming tachyon field model of temporality.

Credited as co-inventor of the [[[Erstwhile and Again|Constant Temporal Sink]]], Dec 1997. Findings published in //Foundation// with co-author Dr. Thaddeus Xyank, Spring 1892 issue.

Achieved PhD Quantum Electrodynamics/Tachyon Chromodynamics and promoted to Sr Researcher Jan 1998.

Participated in RCT-Δt [[[Publish or Perish|proof of concept]]] retrieval mission of [[[SCP-604]]], May 1998.

Completed final mass-production version of [[[The Kitchen Sink|XACTS]]] device Feb 2004. Device approved for [[[SCP-2000|retroactive service]]].

Completed final mass-production version of [[[Perseveration|XACTS Mk II]]], July 2005.

**Psychological Profile:** 

Athena uses professional rigor as a smokescreen for her emotions, which is somewhat troubling. And her recent deadly force certification doesn’t help to allay my concerns. It doesn’t make much sense; she has no contact, as far as I’m aware, with violent or dangerous anomalous phenomena. It leads me to conclude there’s some recent trauma which she has elected not to discuss during our sessions.

Prior to 1998, her background doesn’t indicate anything unusual. Non abusive household, lifelong financial security, no history of any sexual or physical assault. She shouldn’t be showing the subtle ticks she’s showing. Loud noises and unexpected physical contact have begun to trigger strong fight responses from her. It’s obviously connected to her brief foray into field work, but she either can’t or won’t discuss the details. Everyone in this organization seems at least a little scarred, mentally and emotionally. As to why she won’t talk? You’ll have to ask her. Lord knows I've tried.

Athena’s mind, however, is absolutely sharp and creative and remains so. She’s humble about her accomplishments, which is refreshing, but still proud of the work that she’s done with Δt and on the invention of the XACTS.  Foundation caught her when she was still quite young and idealistic and shoved her to the frontier of science and she has taken to it admirably well. This woman has a doctorate in a field of science she helped invent. Maybe that’s why professionalism remains so important to her, even through her darkest; she’d rather see the scientist when she looks in the mirror than the victim.

Born to Lamar and Ashley Kitterman, NY/NY

Undergrad at Brown in Nuclear Physics, first doctorate at Ithaca State University. Direct hire by Foundation in 1995 for general purpose research and theoretical work in physical anomalies. Hired as Jr. Researcher.

Flagged for participation in [[[The Deep End|Experiment 281/084-97-1]]] in Aug 1997, confirming tachyon field model of causal relationships.

Collaborative work on [[[Erstwhile and Again|Transit Boundary Condition]]] formulation for mechanical temporal displacement Aug 1997 - Dec 1998. Promoted to Sr. Researcher

Confirmed first known instance of “[[[Exit History|Grandfather Paradox]]]”, Apr 1998. 

Developed first Theory of [[[The Kitchen Sink|Predictive History]]], Jun 1999.

Promoted to RCT-Δt Field Operations Manager, Jun 1999.

Established permanent containment solution for [[[SCP-1297]]], assigned as HMCL Supervisor, Aug 1999.

Established permanent containment solution for [[[SCP-4583]]] Sept 2003, relinquished HMCL Supervisory duties to Dr. Raj Samra.

Formalized use-case for Compound 4583-L-Δ

**Psychological Profile:** 

Dr. Kitterman is overall a very well-adjusted individual. Mild post traumatic stress in the wake of EE-281/084-97-1, but nothing rising to the level of disorder. Also his mental state is marred by the guilt of assigning tactical and covert retrieval teams and agents on dangerous assignments at the behest of his superiors. Much of this was allayed by the discovery of 4583-T for reasons he will not elaborate upon.

Marcus is [[[SCP-5087|one of the brightest minds]]] I have the good fortune of working with, despite his historical tendencies toward unprofessionalism and self deprecation. Since the beginning of his tenure at the Foundation we’ve made a lot of progress in getting him to accept his own abilities. He tried explaining “Future Perfect” to me once in a session and I’ve never felt so lost in esoterica. It’s little wonder he manages to swim with the other big fish in Δt. Though his hands on experience with temporal displacement is minimal, his understanding of how causality is interwoven is vastly underappreciated.

I hope to god he doesn’t ever start hopping around with the rest of them. The department needs someone like Marcus as a grounding presence.

Trained additional RCT-Δt squad leaders in effective use of C-4583-L-Δ, Jan-Mar 2004.

Publicly declared intent to begin gender transition, Apr 2005. [[[Perseveration|Terminated romantic relationship with Sgt Martin Patterson]]].

**Psychological Profile:** 

Regina Watts is a textbook case of gender dysphoria disorder, as has been confirmed by her superiors who have, rather frustratingly, non-linear knowledge of her intent to transition due to future-dated operations in which she has been involved. She exhibits signs of a few standard comorbidities; generalized anxiety disorder, dissociative disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and some minor, well managed post-traumatic stress.

The most troubling thing about Ms. Watts is her comfort with physical violence and combat. Whether this is an acquired defense mechanism due to her involvement in US and Foundation military operations or a lingering side-effect of 571 exposure, I’m not sure. My professional opinion is that this has something to do with her neurology, and may be connected to her tendency to dissociate from her emotions in high stress situations. She doesn’t appear to actively enjoy violence, but consistently expresses her indifference to it, claiming that she experiences combat as mundane rather than a source of stress.

What amazes and confounds me is the enthusiasm with which she discusses anything to do with electrical systems, and her aptitude for instinctively understanding them. I suspect this is a hyper-focusing symptom of ADHD, but the connection is still unclear. Final conclusion? If she’s not fit for continued service, no one in this organization is.

Interviewed HCP-1-2400 (See [[[Exit History|Breach Report 2400-01-00]]]), aiding confirmation of first known Grandfather Paradox. Apr 1998

Founded Historical Continuity subdivision of [[[Document 1780-WL|RCT-Δt]]], May 1998.

Current duties include LKI historical continuity infiltration, United States, 1861 - 1865. Mission: Ensure Union Victory.

**Psychological Profile:** 
Agent Tomlin is pathologically incapable of taking psychoanalysis seriously. Honestly, it makes me wonder if anything he says can be taken seriously. One moment he’ll be describing the sacking of Atlanta, and the next he’ll be telling a vulgar joke. I get the impression that this is a defense mechanism for the stress of his work rather than an indication of malice toward my profession. Wouldn’t be the first time I had a patient stonewall me to stonewall themselves.

Most of the time our sessions are full of Burt openly griping about how cryptic and evasive his boss is. Never mind that he’s every bit as cryptic and evasive when I ask how he feels about not seeing his parents for the last 40 years running, it’s all Thad’s fault. I get the feeling he has gone back to see them, at least potentially. He’s one of the only Temporal assets who has officially logged positive displacement. 

And that’s the part about Agent Tomlin that bothers me. He’s an accomplished spy. Well constructed lies are literally his business. He breached a Foundation Site at age 22 and remained undetected for over 18 hours. I don’t think anyone will ever know anything about him or what he’s really up to unless he decides they should. And since all records of his education are future-dated, we can’t verify he ever even attended college, let alone found time for 4 degrees in the 4 years after graduating high school. How much of this is he just making up as he goes?

Discovered record of LKI history during archeological/anthropological survey in Egypt, Oct 1995. Contacted Lt. Colonel [REDACTED], deep cover Foundation Asset. Flagged for Foundation Recruitment under Δ protocol. Hired Nov 1995.

Served as after-action interrogator for incoming RCT-Δt agents prior to team founding. Promoted to Field Agent in newly formed TIC office, May 1998. 

Retrieval of 14 SCP objects including [DOCUMENTATION INFOHAZARD EXPUNGED].

[[[SCP-4583]]] Patient 0, Aug 2003. Released following amnestic therapy and returned to active duty.

**Psychological Profile:** 

Arthur isn’t exactly the kind of person you’d expect to be a spy. He looks like he’d be more at home in a history classroom, either at the lecturn or sitting in front of it taking notes. It wouldn’t matter. And that’s probably what makes him so effective. He’s a great journalist - or chronicler, take your pick - precisely because he’s so meticulous about getting the story right. In our sessions he’ll often stop mid sentence and think for a minute or five to make sure he’s not inventing or embellishing details.

As far as behavioral or neurotic issues, he seems to be managing very well. His anthropology background makes time travel even to other Known Iterations relatively easy for him psychologically. Arthur is very non-judgemental about cultures of which he’s not a part, but is still perfectly capable of blending into them and moving amongst them. I’ve noticed just about nothing in terms of serious mental illness. Some post traumatic stress here and there, for sure. Perhaps the worst is the quiet existential dread.

Arthur has seen worlds every bit as vibrant and full as ours which no longer exist, either in fact or in collective memory. Most of what we know about the world before the last activation of SCP-2000 he’s had to go watch and write down himself. And while that’s fulfilling I can’t but think it takes a toll on him in ways that perhaps aren’t always obvious. Perhaps he isn’t staring into the abyss, but he is actively seeking out and conversing with hundreds, maybe thousands of people who have walked directly into it. What concerns me is how certain he seems that our history isn’t done writing the 20th and 21st centuries over again yet.

[[tab Established Technology]]

++ 442//i// Perfect Time Watch

Reverse engineered from [[[SCP-442]]], this timepiece is standard issue to all RCT-Δt and Temporal Anomalies assets. The main timekeeping mechanism of the watch is a tachyon counter, which ensures the 442//i// will always keep perfect time in any coherent timeline where it exists. The watch is also capable of accurately displaying temporal dilation when crossing between reference frames, or tachyon[[footnote]]Tachyon: //n//, a temporally charged particle, the density and charge of which can alter the causal rate and direction of their surrounding area. Often modeled in macro scale as a field of effect.[[/footnote]]   flow reversal (most often observed in the presence of retro-causal anomalies) by running anti-clockwise.

Current 442//i// design features a hand-catch which engages automatically during temporal displacement, allowing the wearer to accurately track how far they have been displaced by releasing the hands and counting the watch's subsequent revolutions. Transit between causal strings can also be tracked by opposing revolutions after the bulk displacement display is complete. One opposing revolution of the hour hand denotes movement by one adjacent string[[footnote]] String: //n//, a coherent, self consistent historical progression.[[/footnote]] in the positive direction (string 5 to string 6, for example). One opposing revolution followed by another forward revolution is one adjacent string moved in the negative direction (string 5 to string 4).

A digital version of this device is currently under development to improve operational ease.

----
++ Temporal Expressions

While experimenting with new notation methods for describing temporal displacement, Dr. Xyank accidentally discovered a way to influence cognition at a conceptual level to exploit the tachyon flux naturally present in sentient minds to act as a vehicle for temporal displacement. The notation, dubbed "Temporal Expressions", consists of 12 ideograms and 36 diacritic modifiers arranged into phrases of 5 ideograms each, where each ideogram is also capable of accepting up to three diacritics. When read and understood, the user activates an infohazard which forces their mind to initiate temporal displacement. 

Although robust, the Temporal Expression notation does not appear to be a true language due to the limited available combinations of the elements, some of which are grammatically incoherent. As such, it is best to organize missions into large isochronous[[footnote]]Isochronous: //adj//, occupying equal time. In the context of transtemporal operations, when two timeframes (such as origin present and insertion present) are mapped to one another at 1s:1s ratio.[[/footnote]]  blocks except where necessary.

Personnel of Level 5/Δ clearance who are interested in volunteering for active field duty may see [[[Document 1780-WL]]] obverse for a primer on Temporal Expressions.

----
++ XACTS Devices

The Xyank Anastasakos Constant Temporal Sink[[footnote]]Temporal Sink: //n//, a tachyon emission control device capable of creating, nullifying, or displacing tachyon fields.[[/footnote]] is the cornerstone technology of RCT-Δt. Utilizing a room-temperature relativistic accelerator and a radio transmitter to control the temporal characteristics of its active area, the XACTS is equally at home sitting next to a Scranton Reality Anchor to maintain security as it is on board a space transport masquerading as a purpose designed warp drive. It is far and away the most valuable and most versatile tachyon technology to come out of RCT-Δt's Applied Sciences Division.

* **Mk I:** The Mark I is a rectangular object approximately 50 x 50 x 120 cm with a maximum power rating of 1.5 kW, and maximum effective range of 1 km (3.14 km^^2^^ active area) when connected to a 120v power source. It is the most common and easy to produce XACTS device, and is the model commonly used in temporal containment of room sized or building sized areas, or paired with a purpose built strongroom for service as a temporal displacement device, or "Transit Room". 
* **Mk II:** Developed for portability and personal protection, the Mk II XACTS is only the size of a large grapefruit with a power rating of 1.02 W and active radius of 2 m. It was designed to aid field agents in traversing rapid dilation anomalies and isolating or displacing small objects when working in tandem with two others. Despite these limitations, the Mk II is overwhelmingly favored by RCT-Δt field operatives for its easy deployment, concealability, and portability.
* **Mk III:** Functionally identical to the Mk I, the Mk III was designed as a lighter, smaller alternative replacement to Mk I models which are reaching the end of their service life. The Mk III XACTS is a full 20 kg lighter than the Mk I, with external dimensions of 30 x 30 x 75 cm. This version is most popular among space exploration teams where total mission weight is of primary concern.
* **Mk IV:** A planned update to the Mk II architecture which will raise maximum field strength by over 200%, granting users greater versatility for field deployment. Prototypes are still in development; a service-ready version is expected to release in late 2022.
* **Mk V:** The original design justification for this 400 MW behemoth is not well known. At maximum power, the Mk V XACTS is theoretically capable of causally isolating the greater part of the North American continental shelf. The only known completed MkV device is currently in use in the containment of [[[SCP-5087]]], providing seamless temporal stability between the object and the rest of Site-17, despite SCP-5087's tachyon nullifying primary effect.

++ Isochronous Communicator (IsoCom/Iso)

To facilitate information exchange between field agents and those stationed at home, a communications solution was necessary which would automatically account for temporal displacement. Using a tachyon counter similar to the 442//i// and a ULP (ultra-low-power) transmitter working in tandem with either a normal cellular phone or other radio was developed to allow 1s:1s communications between any two disparate time frames. Along with the encrypted communications signal, the IsoCom transmits temporal metadata to another capable IsoCom receiver, which automatically adjusts the temporal destination of the outgoing signal such that conversation between agents in different time periods on different strings can happen in real-time.

++ Compound 4583-L-Δ, "Loopy"

Following the discovery of [[[SCP-4583]]], Dr. Raj Samra (MD/PhD) of Applied Sciences oversaw the creation of a safe and effective temporal displacement drug which would mimic some of the virus's effects. Through a combination of subliminal causal isolation of the drug's container and pairing SCP-4583-T with a retrograde amnestic agent, his team was successful in creating a substance which would reverse the cognitive tachyon flow of a single user, allowing them to [[[Perseveration|displace themselves]]] into their own past to attempt to alter the course of their future. Though only 12 known TOC assets are certified to use it, the increased effectiveness of mission personnel observed by its use has been more than sufficient to justify its continued production.

[[tab Writing for RCT-Δt]]
++ Time to Lose

RCT-Δt exists in a world where time is thoroughly fucked. It always operates within one universe, but the timeline of Planet Earth within that universe has no default state. It's constantly in flux. The humans sitting in these various timelines are mostly unaware of this, except in those rare instances where an event so momentous occurs that the streams begin to merge. Large tragedies, great discoveries, influential social upheavals are all likely places where this might happen. RCT-Δt knows this, and will use it to its advantage. The organization also knows that in strange and unpredictable ways, these causal strings can effect one another. Reach too far back, to before two diverged, and you'll effect every history down-stream. Sometimes, that's what you want to happen. Sometimes, you need to do everything in your power to stop it from happening.

++ Psst! Hey kid! ... you like temporal anomalies?

I'm not going to lie to you. Time shit is hard. Really hard. That's probably why there's so much repetition in the genre in general. Once things start getting interesting, they get commensurately hard to follow. Stray too far from a simple positive/negative displacement, a stretchy/squishy dilation, or a repetitive/iterated loop, and suddenly your audience is confronted with having to think about causality in ways that are fundamentally different from what they're used to. For many of them, it may be their very first attempt at doing it. 

It's okay to be inventive, but do your best not to be //too// clever with how you present your anomalies. This is one area where burying the lead, even a little bit, can be disastrous for someone's ability to follow what you're writing about. Untangling the causal knot you've handed them is often mystery enough without having to wade through implications.

++ Characters

The main reason the dossiers are included in this file is to give a good overall view of how some of the major players in the Department operate. Things they've done and seen, priorities of theirs, personalities - it's all in there. You're free to fudge the numbers if you want, or tweak the circumstances, or re-invent these personalities as much as you like. There's no way to determine which timeline is original and correct, or if such a concept even applies. So if this cast isn't to your liking, go wild.

++ Notes on Xyank

Xyank in particular needs special mention. Originally he was created in the image of a newer, more serious Senior Staff character. He has cybernetic augmentations to his muscles, his thoracic and abdominal cavities, his ulnae and tibiae, even his cerebellum. He's a man WAY out of time. A screwed up experiment sent him into what is, to him, the ancient past, and he's had to deal with that ever since. The gulf is akin to one of us being thrown back to the 15th century. That leaves a mark. Especially when you're afraid you might be responsible for everything that happens after your arrival.

Thad is old. He's tired. He is dry and distant. He's smart, but not smart enough, and he's starting to notice. Assume he knows more about time and about the reason he's sending people to do things than they do. Assume that beneath that confidence, he's crossing his fingers and praying to gods he doesn't believe in that it doesn't make things worse. But despite the creeping horror and the guilt and the alcoholism, he's also a scientist; curious by nature, fascinated by the anomalous, deeply interested in picking apart every mystery he encounters until he can call them solved. It might take a person five perceptual years of working with him to see this side of him, but if they're patient and not too cocky, he'll warm up eventually.
