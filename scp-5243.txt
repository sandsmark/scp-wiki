**Special Containment Procedures:** As SCP-5243 is a recurrent catastrophic containment failure, it is "contained" through amelioration of its effects.

Every year, on the eighth day of September, the following actions must be taken at Site-43:

**Description:** SCP-5243 is an annual cascade containment breach/unstable time loop occurring in the Acroamatic Abatement, Applied Occultism, and Security and Containment Sections of Site-43. Dramatic local reality alterations will revive and subsequently terminate --seven-- eight deceased Foundation personnel and damage containment apparatus throughout the site.

The Security and Containment Section of Site-43 maintains custody of thirty-four objects or entities of a thaumaturgical nature. Their containment chambers are strategically located directly above the Applied Occultism Section, where esoteric substances produced by these subjects — and others like them at Foundation facilities worldwide — are studied. Applied Occultism is located directly above the Acroamatic Abatement Section, which converts said esoteric substances into less potent industrial effluence. The "stacking" of these facilities allows waste products from supernatural subjects to proceed vertically from their original sources, to study in Applied Occultism, to neutralization in Acroamatic Abatement. It also led to the events of 8 September 2002, detailed below.

**Summary:** At 18:21 hours, undetected emissions from an anomalous subject in the Security and Containment Section seeped into Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-D via Applied Occultism, triggering a catastrophic overload. Orphic outflow reached critical recondicity, and a materials containment breach occurred.[[footnote]] Orphic outflow is spectral material. Its recondicity variable describes the extent to which it has become too esoteric to be contained within Euclidean geometry. [[/footnote]] Refinement tanks and disposal conduits burst, and a chain reaction of thaumic events cascaded back up the line and throughout all three site sections. A brief torrent of supernatural activity followed, much of it counter-chronological in nature, with effects including but not limited to:
* The retroactive and asymmetrical erasure of the above-mentioned entity[[footnote]] The contours of this subject's existence can be traced in some Foundation documentation and historical records, but no hint of its nature or characteristics has survived save for cryptic references to a being known as "The Uncontained."[[/footnote]]
* Increases/decreases in the number of visible/tangible dimensions
* Transfiguration of equipment and personnel
* Colour spectrum shifts
* Dermal recession
* Non-linear progression of time
* Apparition of extra-dimensional beings
* Gravitational inversion
* Noogenesis in inanimate objects
* Synaesthesia, aphasia, glossolalia, xenolalia
* Linguistic reification
* Corporeal evaporation
* Apotheosis
* Xerostomia

**Detailed Report:** At 18:18 hours on 8 September 2002, Site-43 Director Dr. A. McInnis vacated his office to use his personal washroom. He therefore did not receive a telephone call directed to his redline receiver at 18:21 by Janitorial and Maintenance Section technician R. Ambrogi, requesting instructions for the handling of an emergent situation in AAF-D. (Established protocol calls for an immediate activation of the Site-43 Containment Breach Warning System in such a scenario. Technician Ambrogi was either improperly trained, or had forgotten his training.) Ambrogi then attempted to activate the alarm system, but was struck by a burst of orphic outflow and biologically inverted.

At 18:22, fourteen processing tanks ruptured in AAF-D. Dr. H. Blank heard the ruptures in his research laboratory, and remarked upon them. Associate researcher Dr. R. Wirth exited the laboratory in search of the origin of the disruption.

At this time, J&M technician D. Markey successfully activated the alarm system and telephoned Dr. McInnis for further instructions. Dr. McInnis returned from the washroom, received technician Markey's report, and telephoned the Site-43 Security and Containment Section to organize a response. S&C Chief D. Ibanez dispatched agents J. Gwilherm, A. Mukami and S. Radcliffe to AAF-D.

J&M Chief N. Nascimbeni, automatically paged by the alarm system, arrived at the airlock to AAF-D at 18:23 alongside researcher Wirth. Wirth was pulled into AAF-D by a translucent orange tentacle and disappeared. (Chief Nascimbeni cannot account for his actions over the succeeding sixty seconds.) At 18:24 he called out to any personnel still alive within AAF-D, simultaneous to the appearance of technician Markey at the end of the airlock approach hallway. For unknown reasons, upon hearing Chief Nascimbeni's voice technician Markey stopped running and turned around. A wave of steam passed over him and he collapsed, converting to coloured droplets as he fell. An inexplicable gust of air pulled these droplets deeper into the facility, from which screaming could now be heard.

At this time Dr. U. Okorie, in the Applied Occultism Section, exited a containment cell in the Applied Occultism Section and sealed it behind her. This action prevented serious damage to Applied Occultism during the cascade containment breach.

The three S&C agents were briefly delayed when they encountered Dr. W. Wettle in the passage leading to AAF-D and all four individuals fell to the ground. Dr. Wettle struck his head on the floor and became immobile. Following protocol, the agents left him where he lay and proceeded to AAF-D.

At 18:25 the three S&C agents reached the AAF-D airlock and conferred with Chief Nascimbeni. He instructed them to activate the thaumic overflow relief system at the end of the hallway, through the airlock. Just before they reached the controls, the automatic structural integrity alarm for AAF-D activated and Chief Nascimbeni sealed the airlock behind the agents.

The cascade containment breach damaged one containment cell in the Security and Containment Section at this time, before Dr. L. Lillihammer could activate the security seals. One subject in containment was obliterated. (It is now believed that this subject was itself responsible for the breach.)

At 18:26, the agents within AAF-D successfully activated the thaumic overflow relief system. Within two minutes the entire facility had been flushed of esoteric material, and further S&C personnel were dispatched to search the premises for survivors. J&M technician [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5056 P. Deering] was found alive and taken to Health and Pathology Section for treatment. All other personnel were found significantly altered and presumed dead. Their remains included:
* Technician Ambrogi's inside-out corpse
* A human form (in an S&C uniform) which could not be identified, as it had been transfigured into a specimen of //cladrastis lutea// (yellowood)
* A multi-coloured liquid matching Chief Nascimbeni's description of technician Markey's transformation, roughly 50% aerosolized and 50% coating the remains of the above subject
* A "rope" of wound biological material precisely two millimetres in diameter running the entire length of Facility AAF-D seventeen times over
* Five hundred and seventy-two life-sized, photorealistic, two-dimensional representations of agent Mukami frozen in a state of extreme distress
* An inescapable sense of "presence" in a third-floor washroom facility experienced by all searching personnel, which dissipated after twenty-four hours
Subsequent to this search, Dr. Bernabé Del Olmo was declared missing. He had last been seen interviewing the subject in the annihilated containment cell. At 21:14 new grouting was discovered between the tiles in the central control room of AAF-D. Analysis revealed a DNA match with Dr. Del Olmo.

Dr Wettle was collected after the breach by Health and Pathology Section staff and treated for a mild concussion.

Investigations are pending.

8 September every year features an exact reprise of these events. Facility AAF-D has been renovated, reconstructed, and completely reorganized multiple times in the succeeding years. Equipment has been updated, fittings have been refitted, and materials routing has been optimized to ensure safe operation at all times. The facility has even been decommissioned, and its functions transferred to AAF-B and AAF-C. Nevertheless, SCP-5243 continues to recur. For seven minutes each year, the entire facility reverts to its 2002 configuration. [[footnote]] Individuals within AAF-D when these transitions occur suffer no obvious ill effects, but should take care not to occupy space which is otherwise occupied by machinery or structural elements in either iteration of the facility. [[/footnote]]

Each of the seven personnel killed in 2002 (and one additional casualty from 2015) will be returned to life by SCP-5243 sixty seconds before the moments of their deaths. They are sapient human beings with physical forms and agency, and will behave as they did in 2002 so long as the appropriate contextual triggers are received. If they are interfered with, it is possible for them to miss their appointments with SCP-5243. They may survive, and containment will have failed.

------

**SITUATIONAL SECURITY CLEARANCE LEVEL 5243-5 REQUIRED FOR FURTHER REVIEW**

[[collapsible show=" » RE-CERTIFY CLEARANCE CREDENTIALS AND EXPAND" hide=" » CREDENTIALS CONFIRMED"]]

SCP-5243 produces two Amida-class disruption effects: the creation of unstable alternate timelines, and the de-containment of all subjects at Site-43.

The Special Containment Procedures for SCP-5243 ensure that each reprise is identical to the original breach, because each reprise is identical //with// the original breach. These are not re-enactments, but are rather re-occurrences of the actual historical event. Failing to adhere to the Special Containment Procedures will actually change the course of history: a Class-CK reality restructuring event will occur twenty-four hours after the end of SCP-5243, and baseline reality will be reorganized into an alternate timeline.

These alternate timelines are uniformly prejudicial to the survival of the Foundation, and by extension the human race and life on Earth. The seven personnel killed by SCP-5243 in 2002 have become retroactively infused with esoteric materials and the essence of the anomalous subject which precipitated the breach, and will demonstrate unusual and dangerous capabilities should they survive. (They are also unlikely to cooperate with future attempts to correctly contain SCP-5243, as this requires their deaths, and must therefore be terminated wherever possible.) This factor accounts for the drastic variance between baseline reality and each alternate timeline. As 09/08/2002 recedes further into the past, the potential for these new realities to diverge further from baseline increases exponentially.

The seven personnel who were not killed by SCP-5243 but directly participated in its original containment (Dr. H. Blank, Chief D. Ibanez, Dr. L. Lillihammer, Dr. A. McInnis, Chief N. Nascimbeni, Dr. U. Okorie and Dr. W. Wettle) have also become entangled with it. While all other sentient beings immediately become their alternate counterparts when the timeline shifts, these individuals instead replace them. They alone retain their memories of baseline reality, and are therefore capable of restoring it by correctly enacting the Special Containment Protocols for SCP-5243 when it next occurs twelve months later. For this purpose they have been organized into Provisional Task Force Sampi-5243 and given advanced survival training.

If they are successful, baseline reality will snap back into existence in a new Class-CK event. A year will still have passed, and after twenty-four hours the members of Sampi-5243 will forget the events of the alternate timeline and "remember" the year they would otherwise have experienced. Any objects brought back from an alternate timeline will disappear on the same schedule.

Simultaneous to each occurrence of SCP-5243 is an abrupt decline in the efficiency, efficacy, integrity or coherence of all containment apparatus at Site-43. To paraphrase: SCP-5243 partially de-contains all contained subjects at the site when it occurs. All equipment and facilities are damaged equally, on a percentage basis which increases annually. The damage done is doubled when containment of SCP-5243 fails; this deduction only occurs in baseline reality. (For example, a failed containment in 2020 will not result in eighteen such penalties retroactively having occurred in an alternate timeline, completely de-containing all subjects at Site-43 and making restoration of baseline impossible.)

This table shows the impact of each occurrence of SCP-5243 and each containment failure to date (FTD):

||~ **Year** ||~ **FTD** ||~ **Containment Loss** ||~ **Comments** ||
|| 2002 || 0 || 03.37% || Initial event (Incident AAFD-I-117 / 5243-I-A) ||
|| 2003 || 1 || 10.11% || First failed containment (Incident 5243-I-B) ||
|| 2004 || 1 || 13.51% || ||
|| 2005 || 1 || 16.84% || ||
|| 2006 || 1 || 20.23% || ||
|| 2007 || 2 || 27.04% || Second failed containment (Incident 5243-I-C) ||
|| 2008 || 2 || 30.59% || ||
|| 2009 || 2 || 33.77% || ||
|| 2010 || 2 || 36.44% || ||
|| 2011 || 3 || 43.90% || Third failed containment (Incident 5243-I-D) ||
|| 2012 || 3 || 47.25% || ||
|| 2013 || 3 || 50.67% || ||
|| 2014 || 3 || 54.61% || ||
|| 2015 || 3 || 57.18% || [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5109 Death of Dr. A. Zlatá] (Incident 5243-I-E) ||
|| 2016 || 4 || 64.35% || Fourth failed containment (Incident 5243-I-F) ||
|| 2017 || 5 || 71.17% || Fifth failed containment (Incident 5243-I-G) ||
|| 2018 || 5 || 74.45% || ||
|| 2019 || 5 || 77.83% || ||

If this trend progresses, SCP-5243 will negate all containment at Site-43 by 2026 at the latest. In anticipation of this, all vital apparati at the site have been double-reinforced to compensate, and all movable anomalies capable of Ekhi-class disruptions or higher have been transferred to other sites. As there remain eleven subjects which by their natures cannot be relocated or neutralized, four of them likely to precipitate K-Class scenarios if unleashed, permanently nullifying SCP-5243 (or at least resetting its decontainment quotient) is an area of top-priority research.

As of 09/08/2019 the efforts of PTF Sampi-5243 have resulted in the restoration to existence and re-containment of the entity responsible for SCP-5243. Further details, and debriefing reports for the five alternate timelines successfully reverted since 2003, are awaiting security classification and release.

**Summary:** Critical scheduling mishap. Hiring and Regulation Section system corruption resulted in the assignment of Dr. A. Zlatá to new quarters not in the Habitation and Sustenance Section, but in Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-D. Such quarters do not, of course, exist, and Dr. Zlatá wandered the facility until SCP-5243 occurred. At 18:25 hours he was struck by a bolt of light from a ruptured paraspectral grounding conduit and converted to forty-seven half-lemons with bright pink skin and light blue flesh. No timeline alterations occurred.

Sampi-5243 have our hands full dealing with the actual breach, and since we can't have random FNGs walking into our little anniversary party a bit of inter-Sectional cooperation would be a big help.

**Update [09/08/2019]:** All subsequent occurrences of SCP-5243 have included this event. Dr. Zlatá's remains, currently 235 half-lemons, are stored in a secure freezer at Site-43. Proposals to subject these remains to acroamatic abatement procedures are on hold pending executive approval.
