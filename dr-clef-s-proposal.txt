[[/div]]

**Item #:** SCP-001

**Object Class:** Euclid/Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Because of the nature of SCP-001, no containment procedures are necessary.  24/7 monitoring of SCP-001 is to take place from a safe (1km+) distance from Site 0. The location of Site 0 is known only to the current SCP administrator and the single Overseer-level Agent of Abrahamaic faith (O5-13) assigned to monitor SCP-001 from Site 0. Said Agent is authorized to take any action necessary should SCP-001 become active, and is required to immediately alert the Administrator and all other Overseer-level agents should SCP-001 show any change in behavior, as this may constitute the beginning of an XK-class end-of-the-world scenario.

**Description:** SCP-001 is a humanoid entity, approximately seven hundred (700) cubits in height, located in an undisclosed location near the intersection of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. The following features are known about the entity.

* A number of luminous winglike appendages emerging from the shoulders, back, temples, ankles, and wrists of the entity. Although an accurate count has never been established, most observers place the number of wings at anywhere from two (2) through one hundred and eight (108), with the mean number being four (4).
* A weapon, possibly a sword or knife. The weapon appears to emit flame at a temperature rivaling that of the sun, based on spectrographic analysis, although there appear to be no destructive effects from the intense heat on the surrounding area. Any entity that approaches within 100m of SCP-001 is immediately struck by the weapon and obliterated from existence. Any and all hostile actions taken towards SCP-001 have resulted in the annihilation of the attacker, regardless of range (see incident report re: Indian Ocean Submarine Missile Experiment, December 26, 2004)
* SCP-001 appears to be standing with its head bowed in a gesture of supplication, sword held in both hands point-downward in front of it. Since originally recorded by the Founder over [DATA REDACTED] years ago, SCP-001 has not deviated from this stance. 
* Human beings exposed to SCP-001 report hearing a voice in their heads, giving them a directive which the subject reports cannot be disobeyed. The most common directive is, "FORGET" which results in the subject walking away from SCP-001 with no memory of having encountered it. On rare occasions, however, other directives have been given: the most famous of these is the one given to the Founder ("PREPARE,") which he has claimed formed the impetus for founding [DATA REDACTED] to catalog and contain any and all supernatural and/or paranormal artifacts that represent a serious threat to the current existence of humanity. This is the organization now known as the SCP Foundation.
* Observers have reported that SCP-001 appears to be standing in front of a gate of immense proportions. Long-range photographs have occasionally detected what appears to be a pastoral grove within, containing numerous other entities of the same composition as SCP-001, as well as several fruit trees of unknown composition. Of particular note are two fruit trees of immense proportion near what appears to be the center of the grove: one, it is noted, appears to be an ordinary apple tree, although the other bears a fruit unknown on earth.

It is the avowed belief of the Founder that the gate which SCP-001 guards may be the gate to the Garden of Eden, based on correlations with ancient Babylonian texts and the Dead Sea Scrolls. In which case, one can deduce that the entity known as SCP-001 may be the "cherubim with flaming sword" spoken of in Genesis 3:24.

In order to prevent knowledge of SCP-001 from reaching the public, several false SCP-001 files are to be created to throw off anyone who tries to determine its nature. Other Foundation members will be informed of the veracity of one or more cover stories. Revealing the true nature of SCP-001 to the general public is cause for execution, except as required under Emergency Order Patmos-Omega, in the case of an XK-class end-of-the-world scenario.

**Addendum:** Because of the nature of the device, [[[SCP-076]]] and [[[SCP-073]]] are not to

Because of this event's confluence with the recent breach of [[[SCP-995]]], the opening of [[[SCP-616]]], and the activation of [[[SCP-098]]], the Foundation is required to immediately begin preparations for an XK-class end-of-the-world scenario. [[[SCP-076]]] and [[[SCP-073]]] are to be secured immediately. All personnel are to unlock and decode Emergency Order Patmos-Omega, and follow all orders within. Site 19 is to be secured, and all nonessential SCPs and personnel terminated and/or destroyed.
