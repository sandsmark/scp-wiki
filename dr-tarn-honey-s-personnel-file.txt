**Full Name**: Doctor Tarn Honey

**Security Class**: Two

**Duties**: Research and maintenance on low threat SCP's. Dr. Tarn Honey is currently stationed at [REDACTED], where he is proving an unwanted asset.

**Biography**: Dr. Tarn Honey first came to the attention of the Foundation when he reported to the police that a 'viking blood god' had invaded his home and 'ate his milk and cookies'. When Foundation Agents arrived at the scene, they discovered that Dr. Honey had in fact captured SCP-███, more commonly known as 'Santa Claus'. SCP-███ was released to spread Christmas cheer, and one of the Agents, having 'been at the eggnog', offered Dr. Honey a job. The rest is history, and the incident has proven to be the theme for Dr. Honey's general career. It is currently unknown how on earth he managed to get Level 2 security clearance.
