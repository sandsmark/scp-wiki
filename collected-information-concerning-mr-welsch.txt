Okey-dokey, that's enough of the semi-in-universe stuff. I'll keep the format, but leave out the lolFoundation.

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-2274 Commentary" hide="- SCP-2274 Commentary"]]
This was my first SCP, and is therefore currently my most popular one.

The idea came around on a Monday morning when I had to get up atrociously early for class, and I was dreaming when my alarm clock went off. I don’t remember what my dream was, but I woke up with the phrase “I must stand as he stands as he must” in the forefront of my mind, where it stayed for the rest of the day. The idea percolated and formed over the next eight hours, until I was able to sit down and write it all in one rush.

As an article, it’s not too flashy. It’s not too daring. It was a good idea to get my feet wet in the SCP universe (I wrote it about four days after I joined the site). It was enough that I could get used to the expectations for writing and the in-universe precautions needed, without being so far-reaching that I needed an extensive understanding of the universe.

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-2422/Re: Promotion Commentary" hide="- SCP-2422/Re: Promotion Commentary"]]
This was the third article I published, and the second to survive. Until the publishing of its companion tale, [http://www.scp-wiki.net/re-promotion Re: Promotion], it hovered in the teens. Both articles reached the mid-thirties just a few days after Re: Promotion was published. I wrote the tale because the skip wasn’t strong enough to stand on its own – it was a case where the backstory was required in full, not just in the vague details allowed by the SCP form.

Anyway, I happen to like this article a lot. I can’t decide if I feel like it’s more scary or sad for me. Either way, it manages to be more upsetting on its own than 2274.

I wrote this article because I’ve heard many, many stories in all kinds of formats that portray the darkness and emptiness hiding under the surface of suburbia, stemming from the depravity or deceitfulness of its occupants. Whether it’s actually there or not, I can’t tell you, but I like the idea of turning that popular theme on its head: having the darkness forced upon the people unwillingly, rather than coming from the peoples’ actions and emotions. I tried to imagine a situation where that would be the case, and that’s how 2422 was born.

I hope I get to use the Wandering Father character again in the future – I look forward to seeing what other twisted things he comes up with.

Katrina and Morgan and Little Miss Dotty Doo was written because one of my favorite skips (which became the titular Miss Dotty Doo) wasn’t a well-known article on the site, and I wanted to point it out to the extent that I could with a tale.

Also, I happen to love creepy children, be set on edge by the uncanny valley, and enjoy using repetition as a means of building suspense. I also wanted to write something with a more expected format and less talking, after the dialogue-heavy Re: Promotion.

Thus, my second (and second-most popular) tale. It didn’t make a splash, but I didn’t expect it to. It utilizes many, many cliches and the ending is pretty much spoiled if you know the skip. However, it was successful at being creepy, and added a new dimension to the source material (if you wish to add it to your headcannon).

And I like it. It’s a nice little piece, and one I’m rather proud of.
