**Item #:** SCP-3820

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** Any alleged or confirmed spontaneous manifestation events[[footnote]]Including but not limited to sudden, seemingly random appearances or the discovery of the subjects in unexpected locations.[[/footnote]] involving living, anomalous //Canis lupus familiaris// or //Felis catus// specimens are to be reported to SCP-3820 research personnel as potential SCP-3820-A manifestations. Specimens involved in such an event are to be designated SCP-3820-A and contained as standard anomalous animals. 

If an SCP-3820-A instance undergoes a spontaneous disappearance event while in containment, SCP-3820 researchers are to be notified immediately. The disappearance is not to be treated as a standard containment breach. 

**Description:** SCP-3820 is the collective designation for a phenomenon in which living, anomalous members of //Canis lupus familiaris// or //Felis catus//, referred to as SCP-3820-A, spontaneously appear and disappear on Earth. SCP-3820-A instances can manifest suddenly at any populated location around the world, with seemingly no pattern to where they appear.  

Video recordings of confirmed SCP-3820-A manifestations show the sudden appearance of a bright, blue-colored flash which lasts for about one second before subsiding, with at least one SCP-3820-A instance manifesting at the center of the flash. 

The known SCP-3820-A population consists of a wide variety of breeds, including currently unknown pedigrees or genetically engineered hybrids. Each SCP-3820-A instance has completely unique anomalous features of varying hazard levels and containment difficulty[[footnote]]For example, SCP-3820-A-456 is a fox terrier with fur-covered, octopus-like tentacles growing out of its back, and SCP-3820-A-3005 is a domestic short-hair capable of changing any human subject's cognition of color by rubbing against them.[[/footnote]]. 

Regardless of any anomalous features or unknown genetics, most SCP-3820-A instances biologically and visually resemble their non-anomalous counterparts. Most also behave in a docile or friendly manner towards human subjects, suggesting that they have been domesticated. 

While in containment, all SCP-3820-A instances will eventually undergo a spontaneous disappearance event. Security footage has shown the appearance of a bright, blue flash, similar to footage of the manifestation events, which lasts for approximately one second before subsiding and revealing the disappearance of the subject. 

Researchers have yet to determine the mechanism of both spontaneous appearance and disappearance events, or discover the source of the SCP-3820-A instances as well as their ultimate destination. Minute traces of Lawrence particles[[footnote]]Lawrence particles are unique matter found within inter-dimensional space. When a terrestrial portal into inter-dimensional space is formed, some Lawrence particles will often be emitted from the portal.[[/footnote]] were detected during the disappearance events, suggesting that the SCP-3820-A instances were of potential extra-dimensional origin. 

Since the first confirmed specimen was contained three years ago, there have been 3504 contained SCP-3820-A instances as of 31/07/2017, with only 101 currently in containment. An SCP-3820-A instance can spend anywhere from three days up to one year in Foundation containment, with the average period being about one month. 

Of the 3504 confirmed instances, 1750 have returned to Earth and back into Foundation containment at least once.

**Incident Log-3820-1:** On 08/08/2017, Site-19 administration staff Harvey Black received a phone call from an unknown Person of Interest[[footnote]]The Internal Investigation Department has failed to identify or trace the caller.[[/footnote]], concerning SCP-3820-A-3500[[footnote]]SCP-3820-A-3500 has been identified as the most likely subject of the phone call, as it was 'relinquished' from containment in Site-19 two hours before Incident-3820-1.[[/footnote]]. 

The following is a transcript of the conversation between the unknown caller and Black:

> **Black:** Department of Administration, this is Harvey Black ID number ██████ speaking. Please state your - 
> 
> **Caller:** Hello, my name is Calxochitli, and is this Site-19?
> 
> **Black:** Can you tell me your ID number please?
> 
> **Caller:** ID? Oh no, I'm not an employee. I'm just a concerned citizen, calling to let you know that your little scam is finished. 
> 
> **Black:** ...Scam? How did you get this number, ma'am? 
> 
> **Caller:** That's not important at the moment. What's important is that it's all over now, so I just need you to come clean with me, okay? It will make things a lot easier.
> 
> //Black activates a silent emergency alert, designating the call to be a potential Level-3 security breach.//
> 
> **Black:** Ma'am, I don't believe you're authorized to call this number, so you better tell me how - 
> 
> **Caller:** Do you mind not changing the topic here, please? I want to get this conversation over with as soon as possible.
> 
> //Black receives a directive from Site-19 Security, with orders to continue the conversation with the unknown caller and attempt to acquire as much information as possible.//
> 
> **Black:** I see, if you really don't want to talk about anything else, then do you mind explaining how exactly we 'scammed' you?
> 
> **Caller:** Are you serious right now - (//Sigh//) Fine, let me jog your memory a bit. Let's see, you promised that my little pupper Xolotl was going to get a luxury five-star pen, organic blood sacrifices, unlimited play times - I could go on forever.
> 
> **Black:** Ma'am, I have absolutely no clue what you're going on about.
> 
> **Caller:** Are you being legitimately ignorant, or just annoyingly stubborn? 
> 
> **Black:** What proof do you have that we're scamming you?
> 
> **Caller:** I'm glad you asked: I have video evidence of your scheme in action because you didn't bother to remove the hidden camera on his collar. So just admit it already.
> 
> **Black:** Look, nobody's admitting to anything until you start working with me here, understood? 
> 
> **Caller:** Hey, I'm the one making the demands here - (//Pause//) All right then, I'm not an unreasonable woman. So what do you want?
> 
> **Black:** Let me ask you one more time, how did you manage to get hold of this phone number?
> 
> **Caller:** You really want to know? Well, it's because your front company sold you out. Gave me your contact info so they won't be punished as hard as you're going to be.
> 
> **Black:** And just who is this 'front company' of ours? How did they know our number - 
> 
> **Caller:** Still trying to play dumb you lying sack of - (//Sigh//) Excuse me, that was rude of me. I'm assuming you're just a mere pawn in this conspiracy too, so how about you just give it up and tell me the truth? I'll promise not to drag you into the lawsuit if you cooperate.
> 
> **Black:** Is that your intention? Ma'am, I don't think suing us would be the wisest choice -
> 
> **Caller:** Oh for the love of Quetzalcoatl, I gave you a fucking chance didn't I? I'm not sure why I even tried to be civil with you.
> 
> **Black:** Now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure that 'front company' only sent you our way as a decoy while they -
> 
> **Caller:** If you're not going to be of any use to me then this conversation is over! My lawyer - no - //lawyers// will contact you soon, so - hey! Don't disturb me - what did you say? (//Pause//) I - we can't sue extra-dimensionals? Leave it to the police? Gods fucking damn it - 
> 
> //The caller disconnects.//

During the phone call, all currently contained SCP-3820-A instances simultaneously disappeared from their containment units. As of 01/11/2017, no new SCP-3820-A manifestations have been reported, and SCP-3820 is considered neutralized for now.
