SCP-4090-3 is a 32-centimeter bronze sculpture of a human hand. At the time of its retrieval, SCP-4090-3 was located inside SCP-4090-1's temple on a marble pedestal. When a human subject makes physical contact with the surface of SCP-4090-3, their biological father becomes the host of an infovorous construct that consumes sensory and mnemonic information about the subject. Affected individuals are unable to be perceived or remembered by the host of the construct. The construct evaporates after approximately two weeks but can be reapplied through additional contact with SCP-4090-3. Repeated contact tends to diminish the duration of the effect until a suitable amount of time (usually two to three weeks) has passed.

Efforts to contact POI-3055 "zazzbery" are ongoing.
