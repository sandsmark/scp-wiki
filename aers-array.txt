Hi, everyone! I'm Aers. I've written a few things.
@@ @@
I'm British, I'm studying Biomedical Science and I like playing video games. I think that's about everything, to be honest. Oh, wait, I like making puns too.
@@ @@ 
__What do you like in SCPs?__
That's a good question. I'm a huge fan of short SCPs, which is why I write them. I don't think I'd have the energy to write a long one, either. I like to develop my ideas through various proof-of-concept drafts and then picking the best one and expanding on it: it works really well with short SCPs. Not sure it'd work with a longer one, though.

I also adore concepts that are deep but not complex. Something that a reader can understand on their first reading, completely understand, and then the author explores the implications. Take Death Note, as an example. It's a notebook that kills people. You don't need a PhD in Memology to understand it, but the way the story unfolds shows that a simple thing can have serious effects.

I tend not to like horror mostly because I'm desensitized to it. I'm fairly sure most people are, at this point. I mainly stick to emotional skips, rather than the horrific ones.
@@ @@
__You're... British?__
Yep. I tend to use Americanisms in chat and in my SCPs just because I know my audience is largely American. I also have trouble sleeping sometimes, so when it's late for you it's probably //really late// for me.
@@ @@
__Videogames?__
I'm a filthy casual, I'm afraid. Mostly League of Legends and Hearthstone and I'm bad at both.
