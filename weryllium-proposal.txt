**Item #:** SCP-001-J

**Object Class:** Agape

**Special Containment Procedures:** Dr. Palanez, the current host of SCP-001-J, is no longer capable of containing it internally. SCP-001-J is to be transferred to Researcher Nogales upon completion of this document. 

**Description:** SCP-001-J is a metaphysical concept that manifests primarily via emotions. An instance of SCP-001-J currently exists within Dr. Palanez but is strongly theorized to exist in Researcher Nogales as well.

SCP-001-J has effected changes in the behavior and personality of its host, Dr. Palanez. These changes include but are not limited to:
* Elevated levels of endorphins
* Positive mood
* Improved outlook on life
* Irrationality
* Spontaneous and involuntary smiling
* Lachrymal discharge from eyes
* Increased empathy
* Optimism
* Formation of concrete future plans
* Extravagant purchases
* A tendency to share deep personal experiences with another SCP-001-J host
* Emotional and physical intimacy with another SCP-001-J host

The current SCP-001-J instances appear to have spontaneously manifested during a shared meal within the Site-119 Cafeteria. Informal research and rampant speculation by other Site-119 personnel support this hypothesis.

A large number of specific circumstances and behaviors have been confirmed to strengthen the effects of SCP-001-J ; this list has been compiled by Dr. Palanez.

* Researcher Nogales' smile
* Researcher Nogales' laugh
* The way Researcher Nogales' eyes widen a tiny bit when smiling
* Consumption of baked goods prepared by Researcher Nogales 
* Boarding of amusement park rides with Researcher Nogales (notably, SCP-001-J appears to counteract the usual acrophobia that would otherwise be exhibited by Dr. Palanez)
* Viewing and discussion of animated series with Researcher Nogales 
* Attempting to paint portraits of Researcher Nogales 
* Researcher Nogales' responses to said portraits
* Receiving emotional comfort from Researcher Nogales when Dr. Palanez's father passed away
* Walking through the Site-119 garden late at night with Researcher Nogales and prompting several attempts to serenade, poorly
* The way that simply looking into Researcher Nogales' eyes can make every dark day just a little bit brighter

SCP-001-J is theorized to possess a long gestation period, as it remained dormant in both its hosts for several years before exhibiting most of its symptoms. SCP-001-J is incurable, and its symptoms continue to grow in severity with time. 

**Addendum:** 
> **Dr. Palanez:** SCP-001-J cannot be contained. However, I have devised a new proposal to properly deal with its effects. Researcher Nogales, will you marry me?
> 
> **Researcher Nogales:** Proposal accepted, you dork.
