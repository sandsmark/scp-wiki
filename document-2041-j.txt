title:Document 2041-J
**Requisition Forms for Site ██**

------
**Date** ██-██-20██
**Researcher:** Dr.██████
**Object:** x1 (one) M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank, x1 D-Class personnel
**Reason for Requisition:** Required for testing of SCP 2041-J
**Status:** {{Accepted}}
**Reason for Rejection:** //n/a//

**Date** ██-██-20██
**Researcher:** Dr.████
**Object:** x3 (three) M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank(s), x3 (three) D-Class personnel, x30 (thirty) goose down pillow(s)
**Reason for Requisition:** Additional testing of SCP 2041-J
**Status:** {{Accepted}}
**Reason for Rejection:** //n/a//

**Date** ██-██-20██
**Researcher:** Dr.████████
**Object:** x5 (five) M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank(s), x5 (five) D-Class personnel, x100 (one hundred) goose down pillow(s), x30 (thirty) airbag(s).
**Reason for Requisition:** Additional testing of SCP 2041-J
**Status:** {{Accepted}}
**Reason for Rejection:** //Additional testing is unnecessary. Thanks to previous tests, the properties of SCP-2041-J are now well-documented: tanks fired by SCP-2041-J are damaged upon impact, as are the subjects inside. It has been calculated that no amount of protection can protect them from the inevitable injury.//

**Date** ██-██-20██
**Researcher:** Dr.████████
**Object:** x5 (five) M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank(s), x5 (five) D-Class personnel, x100 (one hundred) goose down pillow(s), x30 (thirty) airbag(s).
**Reason for Requisition:** Additional testing of SCP 2041-J
**Status:** {{Accepted}}
**Reason for Rejection:** //Once again, nothing further is to be proved by launching D-Class personnel with SCP 2041-J.//

**Date** ██-██-20██
**Researcher:** Dr.██████
**Object:** x12 (twelve) M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank(s), x5 D-Class personnel, 50 (twenty) kg C-4 Explosives.
**Reason for Requisition:** Additional testing of SCP 2041-J
**Status:** {{Denied}}
**Reason for Rejection:** //Ordinary artillery can propel explosives far further than SCP-2041-J's range, and is far less expensive to arm. Additionally, the waste of D-Class personnel is highly unprofessional, and serves no point whatsoever.//

**NOTE:** //After Dr.██████'s recent escapade with SCP-2041-J and ████████ Army Base, it is suspected that SCP-2041-J has some sort of memetic property. Until this can be cleared up, all further testing of SCP-2041-J is banned until further notice. All proposals for tanked vehiculs to Site ██ are to be sent directly to me in the meantime.//
