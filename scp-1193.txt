**Item #:** SCP-1193

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The borehole containing SCP-1193-01 is to be sealed with a tungsten steel cap containing a 2.5cm endoscopy aperture. At 48-hour intervals, the borehole is to be endoscopically inspected to a depth of 4km for further manifestations of SCP-1193-01. Seismographic monitoring devices are posted at 2, 7, and 11 kilometer depths alongside the SCP-1193-01 borehole. Seismic readings consistent with subterranean movement are to be reported immediately to Site Director Iqbal. In the event of subterranean containment breach, containment staff are to execute Protocol 473-SNIPEHUNT, severing SCP-1193-01 at the fifth elbow. 

The basement containing SCP-1193 is to be monitored at all times by a Foundation interrogator. SCP-1193-02 is to be answered on or before the third ring; interrogator should attempt to elicit self-directed responses from SCP-1193-01. Responses which implicate size, body plan, location, or further manifestations are to be recorded in Document SCP-1193-2-LTR.

**Description:** SCP-1193-01 is a genetically normal human arm, located in a drainage pipe inside the basement of a telephone switching station in Scottsdale, Arizona. Upon initial examination, the arm was discovered to extend through the drainage pipe to a depth of 35 meters. Subsequent liquid-cooled endoscopic investigation demonstrates that the arm extends to at least a depth of 71 kilometers, passing without apparent difficulty through the  Mohorovičić discontinuity and into the Earth's mantle, with regularly spaced elbows every four kilometers. Elbows below a depth of 26 kilometers are slightly retroflexed to accommodate a nine-degree bend in the drainage pipe. Due to practical difficulties in constructing a sufficiently heat-resistant endoscope, further investigation into the SCP-1193-01 borehole has been suspended. 

Communications //via// SCP-1193-02, mostly concerning SCP-1193-01's oven and refrigerator, indicate that SCP-1193-01 may lack conventional thermoreception, and that it is experiencing no substantial discomfort despite borehole temperatures in excess of 674 degrees . 

SCP-1193-02 is a GPO 746 telephone, topaz yellow, manufactured in 1971. While its rotary dial has been glued into a fixed position, it still produces a dialtone when the receiver is lifted. It is attached to a conventional twisted-pair line which descends into the drainage pipe containing SCP-1193-01. At between 0838 and 1034 hours Mountain Standard Time each weekday, the phone will ring five times. If the receiver is lifted, a voice will willingly engage in conversation. The voice on the other end of the line will claim to be a human being, and will invariably mistake the individual on the other end of the phone for an authority figure.  Notable parallels exist  between information elicited via SCP-1193-02 and demonstrable facts about SCP-1193-01. To date, anomalous information received via SCP-1193-02 has included:

* References to human features, but an anomalous body plan, consisting of at no more than nine, but at least five arms, at least three pairs of eyes, and no legs or lower trunk.
* References to insensitivity to heat or cold.
* References to 'a cousin' or other relative, who will soon arrive to 'pick him up.'
* References to discomfort and boredom at confinement.
* References to minor seismic events along the Little Chino fault system.
* References to discomfort at having a limb or other body part restrained, as by handcuffs, a jelly jar, a pipe, a cast, or in one instance, a gopher hole.

At present, data related to SCP-1193-01's size, physical form, and body plan beyond the parts visible through endoscopic investigation should be regarded as provisional.   For contingent protocols and physiological testing data, consult Document RTMR-Delta.

> **SCP-1193-01:** The cast. On my bottom arm. When does it come off?
> **Dr. Iqbal:** I'm to understand you've got... a cast... on your bottom arm? I don't understand. Which arm is that?
> **SCP-1193-01:** The bottom one. Can you take it off? I've already been in the hospital for three months. Seems like it should be about time.
> **Dr. Iqbal:** You say you're in a hospital now? 
> **SCP-1193-01:** You should know. You're the one who put me there.
> **Dr. Iqbal:** I think you must have me mistaken for someone else.
> **SCP-1193-01:** Look, if you can't help me, put someone who knows what he's talking about on the line.
> **Dr. Iqbal:** I'm afraid I'm the only one here.
> **SCP-1193-01**: Fine. Just tell me when someone competent gets to the phone.
