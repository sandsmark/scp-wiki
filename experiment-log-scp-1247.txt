__EXPERIMENT SCP-1247-E1-B-04__
Stimulus: Anatomically standard ant.
Perceived Result: Anatomically standard Shia LaBeouf. Shia LaBeouf mimics actual position and movement of ant. Front legs of ant correspond to arms of Shia LaBeouf. Back legs of ant correspond to legs of Shia LaBeouf. Middle legs of ant do not correspond to any part of Shia LaBeouf.

**__EXPERIMENT SCP-1247-E1-C__**

Purpose: To examine SCP-1247's primary effect in relation to subjects with atypical anatomy.
Researcher: Dr Huang.

__EXPERIMENT SCP-1247-E1-C-01__

__**EXPERIMENT SCP-1247-E1-D**__

Purpose: To determine whether SCP-1247's primary effect is psychological or truly affects senses.
Researcher: Dr Chen.

__EXPERIMENT SCP-1247-E1-D-01__
Stimulus: Horse stands with front legs on one mark, back legs on a second mark.
Perceived Result: Shia LaBeouf standing equidistant from each mark.

__EXPERIMENT SCP-1247-E1-D-02__
Stimulus: Message placed on wall behind horse, such that the horse's rear obscures the message from SCP-1247's line of sight.
Perceived Result: SCP-1247 is able to read the message, as the anatomy of the perceived Shia LaBeouf is insufficient to obscure it.

__EXPERIMENT SCP-1247-E1-D-03__
Stimulus: Low-intensity laser aimed at eye of SCP-1247. Path of laser then blocked by horse's rear. Laser activated.
Perceived Result: SCP-1247 reacts to laser. Researchers observe that laser is successfully blocked by horse.

__**EXPERIMENT SCP-1247-E1-E**__

Purpose: To examine SCP-1247's primary effect in relation to animals passing from direct line of sight, and to investigate the hypothesis outlined in Experiment SCP-1247-E1-C-06.
Researcher: Dr Chen.

__EXPERIMENT SCP-1247-E1-E-01__
Stimulus: Anatomically standard ant. Ant exits SCP-1247s line of sight. 
Perceived Result: Shia LaBeouf instantaneously disappears.

__EXPERIMENT SCP-1247-E1-E-02__
Stimulus: Ant placed within transparent container. Volume of container is 4 cm3.

**__Secondary Effect Testing__**

__**EXPERIMENT SCP-1247-E2-A**__

Purpose: To examine SCP-1247's secondary effect in relation to anatomy,
Researcher: Dr Chen.

__EXPERIMENT SCP-1247-E2-A-01__
Subject: Anatomically standard worm.
Test: SCP-1247 instructed to drag Shia LaBeouf across the room by his arm.
Result: SCP-1247 appears to take hold of an invisible arm located nearby the worm. The worm instantaneously moves, 'snapping' into position in SCP-1247's hand. SCP-1247 appears to mime dragging a body across the room. The task is accomplished with moderate difficulty.

__EXPERIMENT SCP-1247-E2-A-(02, 03, 04)__
Experiment SCP-1247-E2-A-01 is repeated, with the test subject replaced first by a human, then a cow, and then a chicken fillet. All tests had the same result. SCP-1247 reported that the weight of all four test subjects was identical. 

__**EXPERIMENT SCP-1247-E2-B**__

Purpose: To examine SCP-1247's secondary effect in relation to weight.
Researcher: Dr Chen

__EXPERIMENT SCP-1247-E2-B-(01, 03, 05, 07)__
Subjects: Common earthworm, human, cow, chicken fillet.
Test: SCP-1247 instructed to hold each test subject in a fireman's carry. 
Result: Even where the anatomy of the test subject would make this difficult or impossible, SCP-1247 accomplished the task with the same level of moderate difficulty. SCP-1247 reported that the weight of all four test subjects was identical.

__EXPERIMENT SCP-1247-E2-B-(02, 04, 06, 08)__
Subjects: Common earthworm, human, cow, chicken fillet.
Test: SCP-1247 instructed to hold test subject, then step onto scales.
Results:

Weight of SCP-1247: 82.409 kg

Weight of worm: 0.001 kg 
Total weight:  82.410 kg

Weight of human: 72.020 kg
Total weight: 154.429 kg

Weight of cow: 640.500 kg
Total weight: 722.909 kg

Weight of chicken fillet: 0.350 kg
Total weight: 82.759 kg

**__EXPERIMENT SCP-1247-E2-C__**

Purpose: To examine SCP-1247's secondary effect when applied indirectly.
Researcher: Dr Chen

__EXPERIMENT SCP-1247-E2-C-01__
Subject: Chicken fillet.
Task: SCP-1247 asked to place a mask over Shia LaBeouf's face without making direct contact.
Result: SCP-1247 was able to accomplish this task. After SCP-1247 released the mask, it remained in place, midair above the chicken fillet. When SCP-1247 ended observation, its second anomalous effect ceased to affect the chicken fillet and the mask fell to the floor.

__EXPERIMENT SCP-1247-E2-C-02__
Stimulus: A soft projectile was launched toward SCP-1247 such that it would be blocked by a horse's rear, but not by a perceived Shia LaBeouf.
Result: The projectile was blocked by the rear. SCP-1247 reports seeing Shia LaBeouf "snap" into position to block the projectile at the point of impact.

__EXPERIMENT SCP-1247-E2-C-03__
Stimulus: Two soft projectile were launched simultaneously, such that one would be blocked by a horse's rear, and the other by the same horse's neck, but neither would be blocked by a perceived Shia LaBeouf.
Result: Similar result to previous experiment. Shia LaBeouf reportedly moved nigh-instantaneously to block each projectile.

__EXPERIMENT SCP-1247-E2-C-04__
Stimulus: A wide spray of water was fired from a hose, such that it would be mostly blocked by the body of a horse, but would not be blocked by a perceived Shia LaBeouf.
Result: Shia LaBeouf remained in place, while the spray of water was blocked by an invisible barrier in the shape of a horse.

__**Tertiary Effect Testing**__

**__EXPERIMENT SCP-1247-E3-A__**

**Purpose:** To establish a basic understanding of SCP-1247's tertiary effect.
**Researcher:** Dr Zhang / Dr Chen

__DISCOVERY OF TERTIARY EFFECT__
SCP-1247's tertiary effect was discovered during a routine therapy session. SCP-1247 was shown a series of flashcards, printed with images of various animals and non-animal organisms. When shown an image of a morel mushroom, SCP-1247 perceived a blank card.

__EXPERIMENT SCP-1247-E3-A-01__
Stimulus: Live morel mushroom.
Perceived Result: SCP-1247 is unable to perceive the stimulus.

__EXPERIMENT SCP-1247-E3-A-02__
Stimulus: Live morel mushroom. Researchers divide the mushroom in half with a scalpel.
Perceived Result: SCP-1247 is unable to perceive the stimulus. SCP-1247 appears uncomfortable, and reports a minor headache.

__EXPERIMENT SCP-1247-E3-A-03__
Stimulus: Divided morel mushroom. Researchers attempt to ignite the mushroom.
Perceived Result: SCP-1247 exhibits great distress (screams). The mushroom is propelled away from the researchers by an unseen force. SCP-1247 loses consciousness and falls to the ground, hitting its head against a wall. SCP-1247 removed from testing room and scheduled for an MRI/CT scan.

__RESULTS OF MRI / CT SCAN__
SCP-1247 is uninjured. However, results of spectrometry reveal that the foreign fungal entity appears to have extended further into SCP-1247's brain. The fungal entity now occupies over ██% of SCP-1247's brain.

Testing of SCP-1247's tertiary effect has been indefinitely suspended. SCP-1247 is now required to wear a padded crash helmet at all times.
