**DeCIRO Catalogue Number:** SC-14/126-20/921

**Document Type:** Step Compilation

**Dates Received:** 08-03-2014 through 25-07-2017

**Operation Status:** Open

**Foreword:** The people of the Foundation suffer to little opponent, not violence or brutality, but fear. A fear, that sees no blood, hears no screams, insensitive to all. If no weapon can harm them, no blade pierce their shield, then let the stench of fear gas them out into the daylight, where all the world will converge upon them, and by the end of the feast nothing will be left but their bones.

**1. STEP 14/126**

Maintain exposure of agent to Subject 207 within Procedure Centre 28. Keep surgery to a minimum in prevention of shock. If subject continues to show unrest, administer amnestics prior and after every surgery procedure.

**2. STEP 14/248**

Begin Procedure 28 on Subject 207. Commence with chemical editing of the amygdala when possible.

**3. STEP 14/476**

Staff suffering from a psychological unrest when dealing with Subject 207 are to be removed from the program. I don't need people breaking-down in the middle of surgery procedures.

**4. STEP 14/886**

Begin Preparation Phase 01 on Subject 207. Sterilize the facility.

**5. STEP 14/895**

Begin Preparation Phase 02 on Subject 207.

**6. STEP 15/232**

Expected Foundation raid on Facility 14. Evacuate all required personnel attributed to Procedure 28. Burn all documentation on related material.

**7. STEP 15/524**

Begin testing of Procedure 29 on Subject 207. Remain cautious. Procedure 28 to be terminated. Gamma-class staff involved to take amnestic prescriptions. Subject 207 to be moved to Detention Centre 18 prior to movement to Experimentation Centre 05.

**8. STEP 15/884**

Authorised testing of Subject 207 on exposure to livestock.

Experimentation ceased after possible threat of injury to Subject 207. Cattle appear able to resist attacks and psychological trauma presented by Subject 207. Suggest further surgery.

**9. STEP 16/110**

Continue surgery and modifications on Subject 207. Transfer to Procedure Centre 28. Re-enact Procedure 30. Begin usage of steroid agents of Subject 207. End when seen adequate for safe, further testing.

**10. STEP 16/308**

Authorised further testing of Subject 207 on exposure to livestock.

Average survival time: 12.41 minutes. Suggest an increased focus on the maximum psychological trauma subject is able to inflict.

**11. STEP 16/441**

Further surgery on Subject 207 required. Increase exposure to agent by 11%. Transfer to Procedure Centre 28. Commence Semi-Procedure 30-1. Once complete, commence Semi-Procedure 30-2 involving steroids and hormone growth. Remove Medical Procedure Team 7 from program and replace with specialised team resistant to catatonia while performing procedures on 207. End when seen adequate for further testing.

**12. STEP 16/821**

Authorise further testing of Subject 207 on exposure to livestock. Introduce equine livestock. Remove poultry from experimentation.

Subject 207 has proven ability to resist retaliation. Killing method from releasing prey near death effective. Should be preserved. Suggest further infliction capabilities of psychological trauma.

**13. STEP 17/011**

Remove Dr. Foster from manager of Procedure-28. Suspected psychological unrest. Record incident on medical logs, and deny future access to unsettling procedures in future.

**14. STEP 17/045**

Move Subject 207 to Procedure Centre 31, and perform Procedure 31, involving skeletal/anatomical reconfiguration. Expect intense trauma from 207. Authorise further testing of Subject 207 on exposure to equine (group) livestock after surgery (allowing 3 days of recovery).

Experimental-Prey 02 (saltwater crocodile) withdrawn from experiment after both Subject 207 and prey suffered extensive injuries. Suggest waiting for Subject 207 to recover.

> **Summary Report:** 8/12 attempted retaliation. 1/12 died from shock upon viewing Subject 207. 3/12 attempted escape. Average survival time: 48.53 minutes. Suggest administering experimental prey with anterograde amnesia to test maximum potency of Subject 207. Results are extremely promising, however Subject 207 is becoming restless. Further suggest implementing a staff-rotation-cycle in prevention of further psychological unrest. Soon Experimentation Centre 05 will be unfit to hold Subject 207.

**19. STEP 17/421**

Staff suffering from psychological nervousness when experimenting with Subject 207 to be removed from program. Staff requesting amnestics to be granted permission. Commence Procedure 32 ASAP.

**20. STEP 17/488**

Authorise further testing of Subject 207 on exposure to humans (group) each administered with anterograde amnesia. Provide basic supplies. Move research of Subject 207 to Experimentation Centre 05. Design facility to imitate hospital environment.

Further research concludes that Communication Device 04 has been recovered by the Foundation, and were using the device to communicate with one member of experimental prey. Suggested

**[FURTHER DOCUMENTATION BURNT DURING FOUNDATION RAID ON FACILITY]**

**21. STEP 17/921**

Deploy 18 Alpha-Class personnel to recover Subject 207. Location unknown following Foundation raid on facility and subsequent escape of Subject 207. Foundation confirmed not to be in possession of Subject, but aware and also attempting recovery. Suspected to have entered a civilian population, heading Eastbound of facility. This is a maximum-class priority. Re-contain Subject 207 immediately.
