**Item #:** SCP-4273

**Special Containment Procedures:** All SCP-4273 entities are to be contained within a standard botanical containment cell. Each entity is to remain isolated outside of testing purposes.

**Description:** SCP-4273 refers to a collection currently consisting of three Japanese bonsai trees. Due to the entities' ability to alter their dimensions at will, it is impossible to determine an exact height. However, entities have not shown to exceed more than two meters in height following reconstruction. Whether this is because they are unable to sustain themselves beyond this point, or because they are unwilling to grow any further is unknown.

SCP-4273 entities demonstrate a competent level of mimicry when observing human behaviour. They have been recorded mimicking the actions of personnel both when in the presence of personnel and via video surveillance when unobserved. Entities are sentient, although their sapience is questionable. Following Incident SCP-4273, testing in regards to the entities' intelligence has been slow.

However, the entities have expressed concern in regards to self preservation, and the preservation of other plant life. They will not engage in activities that they perceive to be harmful to their well being or other plant life. In addition, they have demonstrated negative responses in relation to any perceived violence towards themselves or other plant life. Pejorative language directed toward the entities will also elicit a negative response. --Barring these stimuli however, SCP-4273 entities are generally docile when handled individually.--

//That last statement should be expunged from the document. They've begun to demonstrate increasingly aggressive behaviour in the presence of Dr.Allegre since the second week of January. She has since put in a formal reassignment request, which is currently under review. These things are dangerous, despite all appearances. Be careful when handling them.//

SCP-4273 entities possess the ability to communicate via alterations to their anatomy. They express emotion primarily by altering the pigmentation of their leaves. These changes are often accompanied by the restructuring of the trunk, repositioning of branches and growth of additional roots. Any alterations performed by an SCP-4273 entity are preceded by a series of disturbances in the soil that contains the entity. The amount of soil displaced correlates directly to the scale of alteration. Any branches or roots grown in this method will reassimilate into the main body of the SCP-4273 instance within one hour.

**1200:** Dr. Allegre enters SCP-4273's containment cell and attempts to remove the entity from its podium. The other SCP-4273 entities grow several dozen branches as their leaves change into a brilliant shade of red. 

**1201:** SCP-4273-2, -3 and -4 restrain Dr. Allegre completely. Although visibly distressed, the doctor does not call for help and attempts to remain calm. 

**1206:** Dr. Allegre is released by the entities and apologizes sincerely to them. She then proceeds to exit the containment cell.

//So we know now that they're protective of one another. Viciously. We have to separate them first before we can experiment further with them.//

**1436:** Dr. Allegre enters SCP-4273-1's containment cell and removes the entity from its podium.

**1437:** SCP-4273-1 grows several additional branches and attaches them to Dr. Allegre's arm. 

**1438** Dr. Allegre strokes the entity gently and whispers something that induces a calming effect. The entity reassimilates its branches and returns to a relaxed state. 

**1450:** Dr. Allegre switches on the television present within the cell and tunes into [REDACTED], which is showing footage of the ongoing fire in Australia. 

**1451:** SCP-4273-1 sheds all of its leaves and grows twenty three additional roots to turn itself away from the television. Dr. Allegre then switches off the television and soothes the entity by gently stroking its trunk. 

**1503:** Entity returns to a semi-relaxed state. The few leaves that have grown back are yellow. Dr. Allegre attempts to carry the entity back to its podium, but the entity flinches away from her. She slowly approaches SCP-4273-1 again, and returns it to the podium.

**1505:** Dr. Allegre proceeds to water the entity with the provided pail. No observable physical change occurs within SCP-4273-1.

//I wonder if they can discern between reality and the television screen. Perhaps they're afraid of being hurt themselves, that could prove sapience if we test further. I'll ask the site manager for a pair of sheers.//

[BEGIN LOG]

**1300:** Dr. Allegre enters SCP-4273-1's containment cell and approaches SCP-4273-1 with a pair of garden shears.

**1301:** SCP-4273-1's leaves gradually fluctuate between yellow and red. Entity restructures itself into a smaller form. 

**1302:** Dr. Allegre proceeds to groom SCP-4273-1 with the garden shears to the best of her ability. The entity's leaves turn a light green shade without any additional physical reconstruction.

**1312:** Dr. Allegre produces a notepad and pen from her pocket and lays them beside SCP-4273-1. She then proceeds to remove a branch from the entity using the garden shears. 

**1314:** Entity reconstructs itself into [REDACTED] times its original height. 

**1315:** Dr. Allegre recoils. SCP-4273-1 forcefully removes the garden shears out of Dr. Allegre's hand and throws them to the opposite side of the containment cell.

**1316:** Dr. Allegre begins to retreat towards the containment cell door. SCP-4273 grows several dozen additional branches which it then uses to restrain her.

**1317:** Dr. Allegre attempts to raise a containment breach alarm but is pulled away by SCP-4273. She then attempts to cut herself free and is unable to destroy SCP-4273's branches. The entity proceeds to strangle Dr. Allegre. 

**1319:** Dr. Allegre manages to knock SCP-4273-1's pot onto the ground, shattering it. All grown branches go limp, and SCP-4273's leaves gradually lose all colouration. Dr. Allegre rubs her neck and sprints out of the containment cell.
