**Item #:** SCP-1940

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**  Should an instance of SCP-1940 be found outside of containment, all products for sale at that time are to be bought. Funds expended in this manner can later be reclaimed using form CrayEx-D/1940-B. Products bought are to be destroyed immediately, and are not to be brought into Foundation premises. 

One instance of SCP-1940 is to be kept in a standard containment cell, and will be allowed to sell products provided for it. If SCP-1940-1 shows any sign of suspicion or distress due to none of its products (SCP-1940-2) being bought, one instance of SCP-1940-2 is to be purchased and disposed of appropriately. Due to SCP-1940 pricing scheme, all testing is to be performed in rooms with objects of low value present. D-class personnel used in testing are to be provided with enough funds to purchase all objects for sale.

As of █/██/19██, no doors purchased from SCP-1940 are to be taken in for facility usage, as this cause SCP-1940 to affect two rooms simultaneously. For more information, see Incident Report 1940-█.

**Description:** SCP-1940 is the designation given to an anomalous phenomenon where a commercial business manifests inside a room[[footnote]]Note: The term "room" is to be defined as an enclosed, indoor area that can be accessed through an opening of any form. This includes doors, cupboard doors, closet doors, etc.[[/footnote]]. It will sell all furnishings of the room, similar to products in a store, including items such as furniture, carpeting or tiling, and wallpaper. A number of shelves and displays sufficiently large enough to hold all products for sale will be present, as well as a counter and cash register. If the room in question is too small to fit these, its inner contents will appear to shrink to smaller proportions. However, this only affects SCP-1940-1, the counter and cash register, and the various shelves and displays holding products: the previous contents of the room do not change in size.

SCP-1940-1 is a humanoid entity that materializes inside a room affected by SCP-1940. Instances of SCP-1940-1 are of either gender, will be between the approximate ages of twenty and fifty, and have no set appearance. Upon engaging in conversation, SCP-1940-1 will claim that it is the current cashier of the establishment. It will try to avoid violence when confronted on its location, and will produce documents stating the store's property was owned by it for several years. SCP-1940-1 will also allow the purchase of all items for sale in SCP-1940 and will accept any local form of legal tender or valid credit and debit cards that would otherwise work in genuine stores within the area. 

SCP-1940-1 can be killed, causing another instance of SCP-1940-1 to materialize when not under observation, and will try to reason with its attacker. SCP-1940-1 will continue to materialize indefinitely, though will begin begging that its family needs the money.

An instance of SCP-1940 will cease to exist after all products of SCP-1940 are purchased. All products bought from SCP-1940 will hereby be referenced to as SCP-1940-2, due to their main anomalous effect: SCP-1940-2 will cause a new instance of SCP-1940 to develop 6 hours after being left in a room. This can cause SCP-1940 to spread quickly, due to various instances of SCP-1940-2 being brought into different rooms. Attempts of surveillance to observe how SCP-1940 develops has been met with failure, due to all surveillance equipment being taken as products in SCP-1940. Recorded data show SCP-1940-1 locating any equipment and shutting then off before converting them into SCP-1940-2, though it will deny doing so upon interview.

**Incident 1940-A:** Before SCP-1940-2's anomalous properties were discovered, Agent █████ had taken one product without authorization. An instance of SCP-1940 was found to have developed in Agent █████'s sock drawer. The following is an audio log of Dr. Mill questioning SCP-1940-1, with Agent █████ standing by:

> **Interviewed:** SCP-1940-1
>  
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Mill
>  
> **<Begin Log, █:██ pm>**
>  
> **Dr. Mill:** So, may I ask what you are doing in that sock drawer?
>  
> **SCP-1940-1:** [SCP-1940-1 smiles and waves] Good morning sir! Welcome to my humble store! Would you like to purchase some of these fine wares? I have several marvelous pairs of socks here... [due to SCP-1940-1's decreased size, it falls down after attempting to lift a sock.]
>  
> **Dr. Mill:** Those appear to be Agent █████'s socks, not yours.
> 
> **SCP-1940-1:** [SCP-1940-1 attempts to enticingly display a sock, by utilizing it as a sleeping bag.] Well, I do believe I was settled here first. Finders keepers, you know. [5 second pause]...Though I do have some documents if your unconvinced. [Appears to hold a minuscule piece of paper.]
> 
> **Dr. Mill:** Well, I'm afraid that you will have to leave the premises, because your products aren't-
> 
> **SCP-1940-2:** No, wait! Please, I have a wife and three kids! Each of them younger than five years! Do you even know what kind of hell I live in?! Look, uh, I don't just have socks! Here are some lovely used condoms, Agent █████'s specialty! I only have four in stock, so get them while you can!
> 
> **<End Log, [█:██ pm]>**
> 
> [Agent █████ was restrained following a violet outburst, causing him to knock over the drawer containing SCP-1940. SCP-1940-1 was found inside, uninjured due to the several socks acting as cushions. Neutralization was carried through without incident.]
