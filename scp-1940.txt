**Item #:** SCP-1940

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**  Should an instance of SCP-1940 be found outside of containment, all products for sale at that time are to be bought. Funds expended in this manner can later be reclaimed using form CrayEx-D/1940-B. Products bought are to be destroyed immediately, and are not to be brought into Foundation premises. 

One instance of SCP-1940 is to be kept in a standard containment cell, and will be allowed to sell products provided for it. If SCP-1940-1 shows any sign of suspicion or distress due to none of its products (SCP-1940-2) being bought, one instance of SCP-1940-2 is to be purchased and disposed of appropriately. Due to SCP-1940 pricing scheme, all testing is to be performed in rooms with objects of low value present. D-class personnel used in testing are to be provided with enough funds to purchase all objects for sale.

As of █/██/19██, no doors purchased from SCP-1940 are to be taken in for facility usage, as this will cause SCP-1940 to affect two rooms simultaneously. For more information, see Incident Report 1940-█.

**Description:** SCP-1940 is the designation given to an anomalous phenomenon where a commercial business manifests inside a room[[footnote]]Note: The term "room" is to be defined as an enclosed, indoor area that can be accessed through an opening of any form. This includes doors, cupboard doors, closet doors, etc.[[/footnote]]. It will sell all furnishings of the room, similar to products in a store, including items such as furniture, carpeting or tiling, and wallpaper, and a number of shelves and displays sufficiently large enough to hold all products for sale will also be present. If the room in question is too small to fit these items, its inner contents will appear to shrink to smaller proportions. However, this does not affect the previous contents of the room.

SCP-1940-1 is a humanoid entity that materializes inside a room affected by SCP-1940, and will appear to be standing behind a counter with a cash register. Instances of SCP-1940-1 are of any gender, will be between the approximate ages of twenty and fifty, and have no set appearance. Upon engaging in conversation, SCP-1940-1 will claim that it is the current cashier of the establishment. SCP-1940-1 will also allow the purchase of all items for sale in SCP-1940 and will accept any local form of legal tender or valid credit and debit cards that would otherwise work in genuine stores within the area. 

SCP-1940-1 will try to avoid violence when confronted on its location, and will produce documents stating the store's property was under ownership for several years, and was originally purchased by "Light Courier Enterprises". SCP-1940-1 can be killed, but doing so will cause another instance of SCP-1940-1 to materialize when not under observation, which will try to reason with its attacker. SCP-1940-1 will continue to materialize indefinitely, though it will begin to beg that its family requires money.

An instance of SCP-1940 will cease to exist after all products within SCP-1940 are purchased. All products bought from SCP-1940 will hereby be referenced to as SCP-1940-2, due to their main anomalous effect; SCP-1940-2 will cause a new instance of SCP-1940 to develop 6 hours after being left in a room. This can cause SCP-1940 to spread quickly, due to various instances of SCP-1940-2 being brought into different rooms. Attempts of surveillance to observe how SCP-1940 develops have met with failure, due to all surveillance equipment being taken as products in SCP-1940. Recorded data show SCP-1940-1 locating any equipment and shutting them off before converting them into SCP-1940-2, though it will deny doing so upon interview.

**Incident 1940-A:** Before SCP-1940-2's anomalous properties were discovered, Agent █████ had taken one product without authorization. An instance of SCP-1940 was found to have developed in Agent █████'s sock drawer. The following is an audio log of Dr. Mill questioning SCP-1940-1, with Agent █████ standing by:

> **Interviewed:** SCP-1940-1
>  
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Mill
>  
> **<Begin Log, █:██ pm>**
>  
> **Dr. Mill:** SCP-1940-1, how did you get in this sock drawer?
>  
> **SCP-1940-1:** [SCP-1940-1 smiles and waves] Good morning sir! Welcome to this humble little store, brought to you by Light Courier Enterprises! Would you like to purchase some of these fine wares? I have several marvelous pairs of socks here... [Due to SCP-1940-1's decreased size, it falls down after attempting to lift a sock.]
> 
> **Dr. Mill:** ...Light Courier Enterprises? 
> 
> **SCP-1940-1:** [Mutters to itself and gets up] Simply the world's greatest corporation, my friend! We sell anything that you could imagine, and I suggest you get a job here, too! $2.25 an hour isn't pay that comes easily in these times!
>  
> **Dr. Mill:** Those appear to be Agent █████'s socks, not yours.
> 
> **SCP-1940-1:** [SCP-1940-1 attempts to enticingly display a sock, by utilizing it as a sleeping bag.] Well, I do believe I was situated here first. Finders keepers, you know. [5 second pause] Though I do have some documents if you're unconvinced. [Appears to hold a minuscule piece of paper.]
> 
> **Dr. Mill:** Well, I'm afraid that your products aren't actually legitimate, so-
> 
> **SCP-1940-2:** No, wait! Please, I have a wife and three kids! Each of them younger than five years! Do you even know what kind of hell I live in?! Look, uh, I don't just have socks! Here are some lovely [DATA REDACTED], Agent █████'s specialty! I only have four in stock, so get them while you can!
> 
> **<End Log, [█:██ pm]>**
> 
> [Agent █████ was restrained following a violent outburst, causing him to knock over the drawer containing SCP-1940. SCP-1940-1 was found inside, uninjured due to the several socks acting as cushions. Neutralization was carried through without incident.]

**Addendum 1940-B:** Recent testing has revealed that administering Class-A amnestics on SCP-1940-1 allows removal  from SCP-1940 without struggle. Instances of SCP-1940 can then be neutralized without the purchasing of SCP-1940-2. SCP-1940-1 have appeared to be unable to materialize indefinitely, and have shown no anomalous effects. Current efforts are to be put into reinserting SCP-1940-1 instances into society with fabricated memories.
