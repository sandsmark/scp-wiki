[[/div]]
**Item #:** SCP-578

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-578 is to be contained within standard Safe-class anomalous liquids tanks. Any personnel excluding D-class under testing conditions are to wear class 3 bio-hazard suits while handling SCP-578. Extreme caution should be exercised in the handling to SCP-578 to ensure that it does not come into contact with any open wounds. All newly recovered instances of SCP-578-1 are to be cataloged and destroyed.
 
**Description:** SCP-578 is a solution of water, silicon, and a previously unknown and uncharacterized enzyme. SCP-578 has a viscosity of 0.910 cP at 25°C, its boiling point is 123°C at sea level, and its freezing point is 4°C. When SCP-578 comes into direct contact with human blood, it will spread throughout the blood by way of highly accelerated diffusion. The presence of SCP-578 in human blood triggers a clotting cascade. This has been determined to be a direct result of the enzyme in SCP-578.

After approximately 30 seconds of contact with human blood SCP-578 produces a chemical reaction resulting in the crystallization of the blood. The resultant compound is physically similar to opals, though it consists of nearly 40% water on average. As the crystalline structure of the new compound forms the blood cell clusters become trapped within. Tests confirm that an absence of clotted blood cells cause the resultant crystal to become extremely fragile. The crystallized blood is classified as an instance of SCP-578-1. Roughly 1.7mL of SCP-578 is required to convert 1L of human blood into SCP-578-1. Small quantities of SCP-578 can be introduced to the human cardiovascular system through open wounds, but this rarely results in the conversion more than a few milliliters of blood near the site of introduction. Approximately 413 liters of SCP-578 exist in containment as of this writing.

SCP-578-1 itself is not capable of converting more blood into SCP-578-1 and can be handled without protective gear. All living cells and other pathogens within SCP-578-1 usually expire within minutes of conversion. SCP-578-1 has a hardness of 6.8 on the Mohs scale and is bright red in color. The melting point of SCP-578-1 is roughly 1020°C. 

SCP-578 and several hundred instances of SCP-578-1 were initially discovered during a raid on a Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. facility. It was discovered that this facility had been used to create large quantities of SCP-578-1 and use it in the creation of jewelry and various other items[[footnote]] See Addendum 02. [[/footnote]]. At this time the exact process used by MC&D to produce SCP-578 is unknown. 

**Addendum 01: Excerpt from Recovered Document HKG-35.** 
> Here at Marshall Carter and Dark, we cater to only the most exclusive clientele, people of discriminating taste. We understand that those of your caliber demand only the finest, the pinnacle of quality in jewelry. That is why MC&D is proud to present the most incredible gems of all time; blood opals. Created from the very sap of men's veins, crafted by artisans into wondrous settings in a true marriage of art and jewelry, these one-of-a-kind pieces easily outclass any you have seen before. 
> 
> In ancient Greek mythology, the ichor of the gods' veins could grant to mortals agelessness or even immortality. Blood opals capture a similar effect, producing an aura of rejuvenation and regeneration. They add vigor to your limbs, taste to your food, and colour to your cheeks.
> 
> This holiday season, show that special someone you care. After all, what says "I love you" like a piece of life, a piece of you?
