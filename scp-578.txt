**Item #:** SCP-578

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-578 is to be contained inside a standard Safe anomalous liquids containment tank. Any personnel excluding D-class under testing conditions are to wear class 3 bio-hazard suits while handling SCP-578. Extreme caution should be exercised in the handling to SCP-578 to ensure that it does not come into contact with any open wounds. All recovered instances of SCP-578-1 are to be stored in standard Safe-Class security lockers. 

 
**Description:** SCP-578 is a solution of water, silicon, and a previously unknown and uncharacterized enzyme. SCP-578 has a viscosity of 0.910 cP at 25°C. Its boiling point is 123°C at sea level and its freezing point is 4°C. When SCP-578 comes into direct contact with human blood, it will spread throughout the blood by way of highly accelerated diffusion. The presence of SCP-578 in human blood triggers a clotting cascade.

After approximately 30 seconds of contact with human blood SCP-578 produces a chemical reaction resulting in the crystallization of the blood into a solid. The resultant compound is physically similar to opals, though it posses a significantly higher water content than non-anomalous opals, nearly 40% on average. As the crystalline structure of the new compound forms the blood cell clusters become trapped within the crystal structure. The crystallized blood is classified as an instance of SCP-578-1. Roughly 1.7mL of SCP-578 is required to convert 1L of human blood into SCP-578-1. Small quantities of SCP-578 can be introduced to the human cardiovascular system through open wounds, but this rarely results in more than a few milliliters of blood near the site of introduction being converted. With sufficient quantities of SCP-578 injected directly into a living human the entire volume of blood can be converted into SCP-578-1. Approximately 413 liters of SCP-578 exist in containment as of this writing.

SCP-578-1 itself is not capable of converting more blood into SCP-578-1 and can be handled without protective gear. All living cells and other pathogens within SCP-578-1 usually expire within minutes of conversion. SCP-578-1 has a hardness of 6.8 on the Mohs scale and is bright red in color. The melting point of SCP-578-1 is roughly 1020°C. 

SCP-578 and several hundred instances of SCP-578-1 were initially discovered during a raid on a Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. facility. It was discovered that this facility had been used to create large quantities of SCP-578-1 and use it in the creation of jewelry. Custom sculptures made of SCP-578-1 had also been created at this facility. It is unknown at this time how MC&D produces SCP-578. 

**Addendum 01: Excerpt from Recovered Document HKG-35.** 
> Emeralds, diamonds, rubies, sapphires, they're all common in comparison to blood opals. Blood opals are the most unique precious stones in existence, a treasure to valued by those with the finer taste. Marshall, Carter, & Dark offers a wide variety of settings and pieces featuring blood opals. Custom pieces are available upon request.
