**Item #:** SCP-4688

**Object Class:** Artifact 

**Containment Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Instances of SCP-4688 are to be stored in a standard anomalous item containment unit in Site-76. This container is to be reinforced with a Faraday cage to prevent possible interactions with internet-based devices. SCP-4688 may not be stored in the vicinity of electricity-based SCP objects, nor should it be allowed to come in contact with electrical wiring of any kind.

Testing of SCP-4688's suggestion effect may proceed with permission from Project Head/4688[[footnote]]Currently Dr. Westrin[[/footnote]]. Testing must be carried out in an electronically isolated testing chamber with no electronic devices. As of the cessation of Incident 4688-Omega, Testing of SCP-4688's interactions with electronic devices is forbidden. 

**Description:** SCP-4688 are a series of Bell-brand children's bike helmets. Although the design of SCP-4688 instances vary, the word "[[[SCP-066|ERIC]]][[footnote]]An anomalous person (or persons) capable of producing anomalous objects, such as SCP-066 and [[[SCP-168]]]. True identity unknown.[[/footnote]]" is always written in a child's handwriting with white marker on each helmet's inside.

Anomalous properties begin when SCP-4688 is worn by a sapient being capable of understanding language. The wearer of SCP-4688 will enter a trance state where several parts of the brain related to critical thought are either shut down or suppressed. Outwardly, subjects will experience slurred speech, impaired motor control, and susceptibility to suggestion. Subjects under the influence of SCP-4688 will not refuse any order given to them, except if it will obviously bring harm to the subject in question.

This suggestion effect appears to be the primary purpose of SCP-4688, given the fact that "MIND CONTROL HELMET" is also written inside of some instances of SCP-4688 alongside the aforementioned "ERIC". Notably, subjects will still retain personality while wearing SCP-4688 and, if left alone, will go about their routine without interference.

It is of note that some instances of SCP-4688 were recovered with rusted copper wiring attached to the frontal area and sides of the helmet. In accordance with the containment procedures developed in the wake of Incident 4688-Omega, this wiring has been removed.

**Addendum:** Abridged Testing Log

||~ **Subject** ||~ **Suggestion** ||~ **Result** ||
|| D-60193 || D-60193 was asked if he would mind baking Agent Wells some chocolate chip cookies. || D-60193 informed Agent Wells that he had no baking skill, but would be happy to follow a tutorial if given access in order to carry out the suggestion. ||
|| D-35556 || D-35556 was requested by Dr. Diamond to clean Researcher Crane’s office. ||D-35556 explained her appreciation for Dr. Diamond’s “act of selflessness”, quickly carrying out the request with no difficulties. ||
|| D-20091 || D-20091 was asked to eat escargot, previously established by D-20091 as his least favorite dish. || D-20091 explained that there was no reason he could not give the dish a second chance, and ate the entirety of the presented platter with no hesitation. ||

<h3>SCP-4688 Instances #29-32 Recovery Report</h3>
<p>Authored By: Agent Laster</p>
</center>
<div style="background:#f2f2f2; margin:36pt; padding:3%;text-align:left;">
<p>It turns out that the fellow who started the whole thing lived with his mother.</p>
<p>She was a nice old lady, couldn't be younger than 65. Actually offered me some chocolate chip cookies just for visiting (whatever deity made me allergic to chocolate is going to get my foot up its ass). We had a conversation. Apparently, her husband was an hedge fund manager, and left her a good sum of money. Explained why she was able to afford a flat in the middle of Cupertino.</p>
<p>Eventually, I guided the conversation over to why I came; the helmets, and her son. He was around 40, never left home. He'd gotten a comp-sci degree but never used it for anything much. Never could keep down a job, either for his social awkwardness or his tendency to babble about machines. Only ever came out of the basement for food and the occasional WiFi fix. Other than that, he was, and I quote, "a sweet boy".</p>
<p>I didn't have the heart to tell her he was a Maxwellist.</p>
<p>For those who haven't seen 'em yet, Maxwellism is like the Church of the Broken God, but instead of thinking that their God is all in the machines, they think it's all across the internet. For the most part, they're the same. Same augmented cultists, same machine worship, same shit all around. However, when your God's on the internet, you're obviously gonna spend a lot of time there searching for 'em. As you can probably tell, that attracts a certain demographic.</p>
<p>First, I asked her about bike helmets. She said she had some, but her son took them all down to the basement for some LARP-related reason. Then, I asked her to go to the basement, so I could meet him. She said sure, but he doesn't like being disturbed. She led me to the back of the house and opened up a cellar door; she gave it a good three-meter berth. I smelt three things: old food, piss, and— the real kicker— dead bodies. You can smell 'em from a mile away, once you've worked with <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-447" target="_top">four-four-seven</a> enough.</p>
<p>There were these shitty wooden steps leading down to the basement. Every time I took a step down, it made a creaking noise. I swear to God, the smell got worse every time I went down; I had to plug my nose by the fifth step, and not just because of the dead body smell. By the time I got to the door, the <i>stench</i> was so rancid, I was thinking about leaving and coming back with one of the air recyclers the breach specialists use to deal with toxic environments.</p>
<p>Then I opened the door, and I had to step back, I got hit with a fucking wave of death. I think my brain kinda blocked out the memory of the shebang, but from what I remember, there was a shit ton of food on the floor. Rotting, decaying food, with legitimate rats crawling all over them. There was shit on the floor; I'm not sure where it came from. The walls were smeared with some kind of fleshy crap; if you looked close enough, you could see the <i>Star Wars</i> posters underneath. They had a pretty nice computer, I remember that well enough. It's such a shame that three fucking cadavers were hooked up to it, and one of 'em had a big hole in his stomach from the rats making a nest there.</p>
<p>I'm no chicken, but I got out of there as fast as I could. I yanked the helmets off of all of 'em, turned tail and ran back up the stairs. Oh yeah, one more quick detail. The wires were burnt out, and they had the same fleshy shit all over. I got some of it on my hand, and I didn't notice 'til I got back to Site-34 and it set off a quarantine alarm.</p>

<p><b>Item #:</b> SCP-4688</p>
<p><b>Object Class:</b> Artifact/Online</p>
<p><b>Containment Class:</b> Euclid</p>
<p><b>Special Containment Procedures:</b> Instances of SCP-4688 are to be stored in a standard anomalous item containment unit in Site-76, reinforced with a Faraday cage.</p>
<p>When not undergoing testing, SCP-4688-1 are to be stored on separate airgapped servers physically stored out of the range of any wireless connection. A Foundation-maintained web scraper (I/O-AVIAN) is to scan popular internet sites and forums for evidence of SCP-4688-1. They are then to be lured into a controlled Foundation server and brought into containment.</p>
<p><b>Description:</b> SCP-4688 are a series of Bell-brand children's bike helmets. The Foundation currently possesses 12 instances of SCP-4688; however, it is confirmed that more exist outside of containment.</p>
<p>Anomalous phenomena begin when SCP-4688 is worn by a sapient being capable of understanding language. The wearer of SCP-4688 will enter a trance state where they experience slurred speech, impaired motor control, and susceptibility to suggestion. Subjects under the influence of SCP-4688 will not refuse any order given to them, except if it will obviously bring harm to the subject in question.</p>
<p>However, through a poorly understood process involving the connection of SCP-4688 to an internet-enabled computer, the wearer of SCP-4688 will instead become comatose. So far, no means known to the Foundation have been successful at awakening affected subjects from this coma, even after the removal of SCP-4688. Following this, an executable file (hereafter SCP-4688-1) will appear on the computer and run itself.</p>
<p>SCP-4688-1 do not have a true interface; however, it is able to bypass standard memory protections and access other software on the computer in significant manners. In addition, SCP-4688-1 can transfer itself across internet connections to access other computers. Interactions with SCP-4688-1 instances have revealed them to be sapient, and they will claim to be the subject who had previously become comatose from wearing SCP-4688. Decompilation of SCP-4688-1 instances has yet to yield any significant results.</p>

</div>
<p><b>Addendum 4688-1:</b> Discovery</p>
<p>SCP-4688 was originally found in the possession of a con artist, who had used it to steal several people's possessions under the cover of a street magician. See Recovery Log 4688-SCHOOL for a collection of recovery incidents pertaining to other SCP-4688 instances.</p>
<p>The existence of SCP-4688-1 was brought to the Foundation's attention after an instance modified the Google home page to feature surrealist artwork by Tinas van Doorn and a string of seemingly random text. This was addressed by Google cybersecurity teams within 5 minutes of the incident; however, images of the modified webpage began to circulate popular internet forums. Information was disseminated indicating that these images were hoaxes.</p>
<p>Although the string appears to be random, it is of note that the words "LAN" and "IO" occur multiple times.</p>
<p>Foundation web crawlers were fine tuned, revealing the presence of several more instances of SCP-4688-1 on popular servers that had remained hidden prior to the incident. It is unknown when the first instance of SCP-4688-1 was created, nor how many there are outside of Foundation containment.</p>

<p><b>Object Class:</b> Artifact/Online</p>
<p><b>Containment Class:</b> Keter</p>
<p><b>Special Containment Procedures:</b> Instances of SCP-4688-A are to be stored in a standard anomalous item containment unit in Site-76. This container is to be reinforced with a Faraday cage to prevent further interactions with internet-based devices.</p>
<p>Foundation medical journals are to fabricate a disease that causes sudden and irreversible comas, in order to cover the activity of SCP-4688-1. Security patches are to be distributed worldwide to prevent further incursions into servers of importance. SCP-4688-1 activity outside of the aforementioned are to be covered up by several Foundation-sponsored "hacktivist" groups.</p>
<p><b>Description:</b> SCP-4688 refers to a collection of anomalies originally used to produce SCP-4688-1 instances. SCP-4688-A are a collection of bike helmets that, when worn, induce suggestion. SCP-4688-B is an electronic construct that, when connected to SCP-4688-A and a computer, will create instances of SCP-4688-1. SCP-4688-B is currently not in the Foundation's possession.</p>

<p>In addition, humans exposed to SCP-4688-1-generated content (such as an infected web<span class="flicker">page</span>) also have a chance to become comatose and generate an instance of SCP-4688-1 without using SCP-4688. Combined with SCP-4688-1's ability to easily n<span class="flicker">a</span>vi<span class="flicker">ga</span>te internet connections, this has led to a rapid growth of SCP-4688-1 worldwide to approximately 4,000 total <span class="flicker">in</span>stances.</p>
<p>SCP-4688-1 were originally produced by GoI-004C ("Church of Maxwellism") <span class="flicker">i</span>n an <span class="flicker">a</span>tte<span class="flicker">m</span>pt to fur<span class="flicker">ther e</span>xplore the internet to find pieces of their god. The multiplicative effect of SCP-4688-1 is believed to be a side effect that was a result of the nature of SCP-4688 and the decrepit conditions it was in at the time of acquiring.</p>
<p><b>Addendum:</b> SCP-4688-B and several other components associated with SCP-4688 have been destroyed. It is believed that, as a consequence of this, SCP-4688-1 instances have vanished. Incident is awaiting declassification. Cleanup operations involving the retrieval of all instances of SCP-4688-A and possibly SCP-4688-B are underway. Reclassification will occur when it has been verified that <span class="flicker">SCP-4688-1 no longer exists.</span></p>
<p>Efforts to cover up the mass disappearance of those transformed into SCP-4688-1 is under way, as it is believed that SCP-4688-1 are no longer recoverable.</p>

<h3>SCP-4688 Instances #29-32 Recovery Report</h3>
<p>Authored By: <div style="color: blue;">a person that i hurt</div></p>
</center>
<div style="background:#f2f2f2; margin:36pt; padding:3%;text-align:left; color: blue;">
<p>It was cold when my consciousness returned to my body, like a spirit suddenly being snapped from astral projection back into the realm of flesh. Once you got used to being free in the internet, it was an awakening to be brought back into your rotting, decaying, paralyzed corpse of a body. If I looked too far to the left, I could see the corpse of George. A rat had made a nest in his stomach. Like the rest of us, he was still wearing the helmet.</p>
<p>After an eternity of being trapped, I heard footsteps. <i>Finally</i>, I thought, excited for the prospect of something, <i>anything</i>, to shift my current scenario. The door flew open, and I saw a man in business semiformal stagger through the door, obviously upset at the sight of our decaying bodies.</p>
<p>I don't know what I would've thought, but I wish I could've shouted, could've blinked, or even done anything to symbolize the fact that I was still alive in there. My consciousness didn't die on the internet. But I could not. As I threw myself against the bars of my fleshy prison, he walked in, took the helmets, and walked out as fast as he came. The stairsteps went up, up, up... and he disappeared forever, returning the life in the dull, grayed room to the status quo.</p>
<p>With my mind decaying into something beyond torture, my last thought to myself was, <i>is everybody else alright?</i> Or at least, that's what I suppose it would be.</p>

<p>SCP-4688</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Item #:</b> SCP-4688</p>
<p><b>Object Class:</b> Artifact/Online</p>
<p><b>Containment Class:</b> Euclid</p>
<p><b>Special Containment Procedures:</b> Instances of SCP-4688 are to be stored in a standard anomalous item containment unit in Site-76. This container is to be reinforced with a Faraday cage to prevent further interactions with inte<span style="color: blue;"><b>im so sorry any of this happened</b></span>rnet-based devices.</p>
<p>When not undergoing testing, SCP-4688-1 are to be stored on separate airgapped servers physically stored out of the ra<span style="color: blue;"><b>my name is Eric</b></span>nge of any wireless connection. A Foundation-maintained web scraper (I/O-AVIAN) is to scan popular internet sites and foru<span style="color: blue;"><b>i didnt make the helmets for those crazy guys</b></span>ms for evidence of SCP-4688-1. They are then to be lured into a controlled Foundation server and brought int<span style="color: blue;"><b>people were killed by them all because I wanted a toy</b></span>o containment.</p>
<p><b>Description:</b> SCP-4688 are a series of Be<span style="color: blue;"><b>i made two only to get my parents to buy me a new raygun</b></span>ll-brand children's bike helmets. The Fo<span style="color: blue;"><b>i thought it would make another good magic toy</b></span>undation currently possesses 12 inst<span style="color: blue;"><b>but it was too much they said</b></span>ances of SCP-4688; however, it is confirmed that more exist outside of containment.</p>
<p>Anomalous phenomena begin when SCP-4688 is worn by a sapient be<span style="color: blue;"><b>so I took some old bike helmets from the garage and made them magic</b></span>ing capable of understanding language. The wearer of SCP-4688 will enter a trance state where they experience slurred speech, impaired motor control, and susceptibility to suggestion. Subjects under the influence of SCP-4688 will not re<span style="color: blue;"><b>i got the raygun and I made that one magic too</b></span>fuse any order given to them, except if it will obviously bring harm to the subject in question.</p>
<p>However, through a poorly und<span style="color: blue;"><b>i dont know what happened or why more helmets exist</b></span>erstood process involving the connection of SCP-4688 to an internet-enabled computer, the wearer of SCP-4688 will instead become c<span style="color: blue;"><b>those creepy guys must of found them and copied them</b></span>omatose. So far, no means known to the Foundation have been successful at awakening affected subjects from this coma, even after the removal of SCP-4688. Following this, an executable file (hereafter SCP-4688-1) will appear on the computer and run itself.</p>
<p>SCP-4688-1 do not have a true int<span style="color: blue;"><b>those helmets were my invention, my magic toys</b></span>erface; however, it is able to bypass standard memory protections and access other software on the computer in significant manners. In addition, SCP-4688-1 can transfer itself across intern<span style="color: blue;"><b>and those creepy guys tricked me into letting them have the raygun after saying they liked the helmets</b></span>et connections to access other computers. In<span style="color: blue;"><b>meeting the guy was weird cause I didn’t really, he told me to put it in my mailbox and he’d get it, and he did, it was weird</b></span>teractions with SCP-4688-1 instances have revealed them to be sapient, and they will claim to be the subject who had previ<span style="color: blue;"><b>i want to take back what I did those toys weren’t meant to hurt people</b></span>ously become comatose from wearing SCP-4688. Decompilation of SCP-4688-1 instances has yet to yield any significant results.</p>

<p><b>Addendum 4688-1:</b> Discovery</p>
<p>SCP-4688 was originally found in the possession of a con artist, who had used it to steal several people's possessions un<span style="color: blue;"><b>i thought I was helping people</b></span>der the cover of a street magician. See Recovery Log 4688-SCHOOL for a collection of recovery incidents pertaining to other SCP-4688 instances.</p>
<p>The existence of SCP-4688-1 was brought t<span style="color: blue;"><b>but i wasnt</b></span>o the Foundation's attention after an instance modified the Google home page to feature surrealist artwork by Tinas van Doorn and a string of seemingly random text. This was addressed by Google cybersecurity teams within 5 minutes of the incident; however, images of the modified webpage began to circulate popular internet forums. Information was disseminated indicating that these images were hoaxes.</p>
<p>Although the string appears to be random, it is of note that the words "LAN" and "IO" occur multiple times.</p>
<p>Foundation web crawlers were fine tuned, revealing the presence of several more instances of SCP-4688-1 on popular servers that had remained hidden prior to the incident. It is unknown when the first instance of SCP-4688-1 was created, nor how many there are outside of Foundation containment.</p>

<h3>SCP-4688 - Revision 2017-11-05</h3>
</center>
<p><b>Item #:</b> SCP-4688</p>
<p><b>Object Class:</b> Artifact/Online</p>
<p><b>Containment Class:</b> Keter</p>
<p><b>Special Containment Procedures:</b> Instances of SCP-4688-A are to be stored in a standard anomalous item containment unit in Site-76. This container is to be reinforced with a Faraday cage to prevent further interactions with internet-based devices.</p>
<p>Foundation medical journals are to fabricate a disease that causes sudden and irreversible comas, in order to cover the activity of SCP-4688-1. Security patches are to be distributed worldwide to prevent further incursions into servers of importance. SCP-4688-1 activity outside of the aforementioned are to be covered up by several Foundation-sponsored "hacktivist" groups.</p>
<p><b>Description:</b> SCP-4688 refers to a collection of anomalies originally used to produce SCP-4688-1 instances. SCP-4688-A are a collection of bike helmets that, when worn, induce suggestion. SCP-4688-B is an electronic construct that, when connected to SCP-4688-A and a computer, will create instances of SCP-4688-1. SCP-4688-B is currently not in the Foundation's possession.</p>
<p>SCP-4688-1 are <span class="flicker">s</span>apient comput<span class="flicker">e</span>r programs produc<span class="flicker">e</span>d when a human is connected to SCP-4688 and an internet-enabled computer. SCP-4688-1 are able to interact with the operating system in several ways in order to communicate, and claim to be the human used to generate SCP-4688-1. It is of note humans connected to SCP-4688 will become permanently comatose after the operation.</p>
<p>In addition, humans exposed to SCP-4688-1-generated content (such as an infected webpage) also have a chance to become comatose and generate an instance of SCP-4688-1 without using SCP-4688. Combined with SCP-4688-1's ability to easily navigate internet connections, this has led to a rapid growth of SCP-4688-1 worldwide to approximately 4,000 total instances.</p>
<p>SCP-4688-1 were originally produced by GoI-004C ("Church of Maxwellism") in an attempt to further explore the internet to find pieces of their god. The multiplicative effect of SCP-4688-1 is believed to be a side effect that was a result of the nature of SCP-4688 and the decrepit conditions it was in at the time of acquiring.</p>
