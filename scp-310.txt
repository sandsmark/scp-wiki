**Item #:** SCP-310 - Eternal Flame

**Object Class:** Safe/Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**

[Containment procedure documentation pending]

**Description:**

SCP-310 is a 157mm tall white candle, composed of apparently standard tallow. SCP-310 is an unmarked 33mm diameter cylinder with tapered tip, out of which emerges a 7mm wick. When not immersed in an oxygen free medium, the wick produces a steady 24mm tall flame. This flame can be extinguished through most conventional means; removal of oxygen, immersion in non-flammable fluid, application of sudden intense airflow. However, on the removal of the inhibiting factor, the flame immediately reappears, behaving much like a standard "trick candle".

Only a small amount of tallow is liquefied at the base of the wick, and is not consumed by the flame. Even during the longest duration removed from containment (██ days from ██-██-████ to ██-██-████ as a result of the events of [DATA EXPUNGED]), at no time during those weeks was the tallow level nor the overall height of SCP-310 observed to decrease.
