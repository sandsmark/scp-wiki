**Item #:** SCP-310 - Eternal Flame

**Object Class:** Safe/Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**

When not used in experimentation SCP-310 is to be kept in a 0.3m x 0.3m x0.3m sealed vacuum case composed of flame retardant material. The research chamber the vacuum case resides in is similarly flame retardant and to be kept saturated with carbon dioxide, nitrogen or other fire extinguishing agent when testing is not taking place. Standard foundation protocols to prevent unauthorized access should be kept in place.

No flammable or semi-flammable substences are permitted within the research chamber, except small quantities for research purposes. Authorization is required for testing on live or otherwise self-propelling test subjects. Chamber is to be kept sealed during testing and emergency vacuum system is to remain active. All personnel are forbidden to wear loose clothing when in chamber. Long hair must be kept tied up. Flame retardant suits are recommended.

 

Any object which contacts SCP-310 is to remain in the chamber until fully consumed. 
**Description:**

SCP-310 is a 157mm tall white candle, composed of apparently standard tallow. SCP-310 is an unmarked 33mm diameter cylinder with tapered tip, out of which emerges 7mm of wick. When not immersed in an oxygen free medium, the wick produces a steady 24mm tall flame. This flame can be extinguished through most conventional means; removal of oxygen, immersion in non-flammable fluid, application of sudden intense airflow. However, on the removal of the inhibiting factor, the flame immediately reappears, behaving much like a standard "trick candle".

Only a small amount of tallow is liquefied at the base of the wick, and is not consumed by the flame. Even during the longest duration removed from containment (██ days from ██-██-████ to ██-██-████ as a result of the events of [DATA EXPUNGED]), at no time during those weeks was the tallow level nor the overall height of SCP-310 observed to decrease.

Other than its interaction with the flame of SCP-310, the tallow itself is not unusual in any respect. It is easily cut and as malleable as would be expected. It also melts and burns as normal when exposed to ordinary flame. Any tallow removed from SCP-310 is slowly replaced by unknown means. If SCP-310 is cut short, tallow will grow from the lit section until the original 157mm height and unblemished appearance is restored. In one experiment, SCP-310 was placed placed in a heat chamber, melting the entire volume of tallow so only the wick remained. The flame remained lit even without fuel and gradually exuded tallow until it's original state was restored.
