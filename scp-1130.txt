**Item #:** SCP-1130

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1130 is to be contained within a standard Safe-class protective storage locker at Site-38. Please be advised that D-Class personnel used in testing generally exhibit erratic and aggressive behavior when exiting SCP-1130-2. A team comprised of one Medical officer with Level 3 clearance and a minimum of two Level 2 security personnel is to be maintained at any test site to detain and if necessary sedate test subjects upon reemergence. Security personnel thus stationed are to carry Daninject Projector Rifles loaded with 3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate darts. To avoid public exposure, testing is to be scheduled between the hours of 02:00 and 05:00 and directions are to only be requested for suitably secluded destinations. Civilians witnessing any aspect of testing procedures are to be detained and administered class-A amnesiacs prior to relocation. Considering currently archived debriefing reports and exploration logs, SCP-1130-2 has been designated a Protean-class dimensional anomaly. Any research or security personnel assigned to SCP-1130 are expected to be familiar with relevant guidelines.

**Description:** SCP-1130 is an interactive kiosk providing free directions from a fixed position in ██████, ██ to any street address within city limits. Its outer structure measures 50 cm x 50 cm x 175 cm and is composed of unadorned sheet metal. Set at an angle into the front of the kiosk is a █████ brand LCD touchscreen, beneath which is a 25 cm x 2 cm slot from which directions are dispensed. A maintenance hatch set in the back panel provides access to the interior. No processing unit, power source or printing peripheral have been found inside and SCP-1130 appears to be fully functional without these components. A small tag in the upper right of the back panel identifies it as a model █████ Urban Wayfinding Unit, built by the ██████ corporation in 20██. Covert enquiries with the company have shown that, while it does indeed manufacture this model, no record exists of the object having been manufactured, assembled or distributed.

[[/div]]

SCP-1130's primary anomalous property manifests when directions have been requested and printed. Directions obtained from SCP-1130 will invariably instruct subjects to leave established routes and make use of a door described as 'Maintenance Portal 26-Sigma' (referred to as SCP-1130-1). It takes the form of a severely weathered arched metal door and has never been observed to be in the same location twice, even when the same route is requested multiple times. SCP-1130-1 does not exist in its prescribed location prior to the production of directions by SCP-1130. Multiple subjects following the same set of directions will be able to find and make use of the same door until it closes. At that point, SCP-1130-1 will vanish from sight and subjects left behind will be unable to follow the directions any further. If directions are photocopied, SCP-1130-1 will only appear when following the original specimen. SCP-1130-1 can be recorded by all present when encountered and visual reproductions will show SCP-1130-1 as encountered by subjects following directions.

Those subjects who successfully follow directions to their destination and remain suitable for debriefing report SCP-1130-1 vanishing behind them once inside. Additionally, subjects describe having to traverse a space composed of up to ██ kilometers of interconnected halls, rooms and tunnels (designated SCP-1130-2) before finding themselves before SCP-1130-1 again. After exiting through SCP-1130-1, subjects find themselves close to their destination. Subjects exhibit highly erratic and aggressive behavior upon emergence from SCP-1130-2, necessitating appropriate measures to ensure maximum test efficiency.

Test results indicate that on average 11-23 seconds lapse between subjects entering and exiting SCP-1130-2. However, this does not take into account the time subjects spend in SCP-1130-2 which may range from several hours to several weeks.

Communication of any kind with subjects in transit has proven to be impossible. GPS locator signals give test subjects' location upon entering SCP-1130-2 as [REDACTED]. This does not change until test subjects emerge from SCP-1130-2. Video and audio footage recovered from test subjects seems to indicate the laws of physics as currently understood functioning normally inside SCP-1130-2. Rooms and hallways encountered are always in a severe state of disrepair and do not seem to be linked in a logical fashion. One test subject reported stepping from what seemed to be an abandoned subway tunnel into the kitchen of a derelict ████████ fast food diner. Debriefings and post-event psychological evaluations reveal test subjects seem to developed a persistent sense of being pursued, growing stronger as the time spent in SCP-1130-2 increases. Extended exposure to SCP-1130-2 has been seen to cause a variety of psychological conditions to develop, such as paranoid delusions and claustrophobia. All subjects have described a consistent auditory phenomenon while in SCP-1130-2, but at this point in time its source is unclear. Further research into this phenomenon and its connection to psychological effects on test subjects is warranted.

**Addendum 1130-1:** SCP-1130 was retrieved from its location in ██████, ██ after a number of documented disappearances amongst tourists. Officials were only able to locate one missing individual, who was found wandering through a gated community seven kilometers from SCP-1130's location. On his person were the directions requested from SCP-1130 and what was later identified as a "Queen Elizabeth" M-17 steel helmet. The Foundation was alerted when details of the case triggered a dedicated monitoring station and a recovery team led by Agent ███████ moved to secure SCP-1130. The tourist was located and was administered class-A amnesiacs. SCP-1130 was removed from its position outside the ██████████ subway station by the recovery team posing as a municipal work crew.

> **Personnel involved in test:** Dr. ███████-█████, D-73299
> 
> **Summary:** The following is a partial video and audio transcript for log file 1130-T-14/73299. Before testing commenced, subject was given directions to ██ ███████ Street as provided by SCP-1130. Subject received MRE rations (including the necessary FRH packets) and enough water for seven days. He was then instructed to mark SCP-1130-1 with an 'X' using a white piece of chalk prior to entering SCP-1130-2. Head-mounted video and personal audio recording devices were checked and found functioning with expected parameters. Subject was instructed to follow the directions and provide a running commentary on his surroundings before being ushered into SCP-1130-2 by attached security staff. Time of entrance was marked as 07:03:06.

> //Sound of a door slamming shut. Subject is seen to turn around in panic. SCP-1130-1 is no longer visible. Subject can be heard muttering obscenities and seems to be feeling for SCP-1130-1. Subject switches on head-mounted LED light and looks around. This reveals what seems to be the interior of a WWII-era submarine. There is a sudden creaking sound and subject is visibly shaken.//

> "JESUS! What was that!?"
> 
> //Subject looks down at his feet. Shallow pools of murky water can be seen all along the deck. Subject raises his head again and surveys his surroundings in more detail. The left side of the small elongated space seems to be filled with a set of bunks. Moldy blankets lie here and there, half-covering the rusted metal cots. To the right is a long rusty metal wall sectioned off by bulkheads. In front of subject is a small door with a lock wheel. Water seems to be continuously dripping from the ceiling and walls.//

> "Okay...okay...okay...gotta breathe...gotta just... //inhales deeply// ...keep breathing. Well, thanks for that, doc. Where  am I? Looks like a boat or something."
> 
> //Subject suddenly looks over his left shoulder.//
> 
> "Did you hear that? Doc? Did you...wait, you're not listening in, are you? Goddamn, what IS that?"
> 
> //REMARK Dr. ███████-█████: Analysis of recovered audio does not indicate an audible sound at this point in the test.//
> 
> "Seems to be coming from behind me. Right behind me. Look, I'm not staying here. There's a door in front of me and I'm using it."
> 
> //Subject runs towards the door and attempts to turn the wheel. It takes some effort due to its state of disrepair. Subject can be heard grunting and swearing.//
> 
> //REMARK Dr. ███████-█████: At this point, a faint background audio signal is picked up. Analysis pending.//
> 
> "It sounds like...sounds like chattering..."
> 
> //The wheel is finally turning and subject glances back over his shoulder.//
> 
> [UNINTELLIGIBLE SCREAMING]
> 
> //Subject manages to open the door and slips through before hurriedly pulling it close behind him. Subject stands with his back to the door, panting and shaking. A room is dimly visible beyond the beam of the subject's LED light. Several hospital beds seem to be scattered around the room. The windows are boarded up tightly and the floor is filthy with unidentified fluids.//
> 
> "What the...? This makes no sense...no sense at all."
> 
> //Subject takes a few tentative steps before freezing.//
>
> No! I closed the door! I closed the fucking door! No! No! No! I closed it!"
> 
> //Subject breaks into a run towards the other end of the room, tripping over a fallen IV-stand. Sobbing can be heard.//

> D-73299 emerged from the side of a building close to his target destination at 07:03:21. Subject was in a state of confusion and panic, showing signs of severe malnutrition. Subject did not respond to instructions and attempted to leave the test site. He was subsequently brought down by security personnel and detained for debriefing. Post-event physical and psychological evaluation determined the amount of time spent in SCP-1130-2 to be between 2 and 4 weeks. In addition, subject appeared to have pulled all of his own teeth with a pair of pliers recovered from SCP-1130-2.
