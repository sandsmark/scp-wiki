[[/=]]

The cack hard cinematic universe is home to a bunch of dumb stupid stuff, mostly weird crack fiction. Cack fiction, if you will. This is a world where things always take a turn for the stupid, farcical, and idiotic. This isn't a canon, but simply a hub to host crackfiction too stupid for LolFoundation.

Hidden in this collapsible are the general 'rules' which we adhere to when writing within the cack hard cinematic universe. If for whatever reason you want to write crack.

[[collapsible]]
* No one is good at their job unless the plot demands it.
* Researcher Zyn Kiryu is the only person who is good at her job regardless of the situation.
* If anyone has to suffer, it's Mr. Fish.
* 049 and Spanko are best buds. No exceptions!
* 'Cack Hard' installments must be a movie of some sort. Continuity is for suckers!
* Bottledick is canon.
* The Foundation is less of a jail and more of a hotel.
* Bottledick is not canon.
* SCP-055 is a sphere.
* Dr. Cimmerian sent 650 million emails and crashed scipnet servers for a week.
* Site-19 has an on-site burger king.
* WWS is engaged in a bloody war with the Shark Punching Center.
* Dr. Hamm and SCP-049 are 049-J's fathers.
* fuck you.
* If you write in the cack hard cinematic universe, just set this page as your content's parent page.
* Mixing canons and doing things that don't make any logical sense is not only allowed but encouraged.
* have fun, damn it. **__//this is not a canon//__**, more like a loose continuity of crack fiction that is all about writing the stupidest crap you can think of.
