SCP-5862 is currently uncontained, and located approximately 400km S/SE of Site-86. The Foundation Corvette SCPS //Kirck// has been deployed to monitor it and carry out initial research into appropriate containment procedures.

GoI-3862 (“ Turing's Wrath”) are to be kept under surveillance for potential SCP-5862 related activity.

++++++ __**Description**__
[[/div]]
[[include component:image-block name=print.jpg|caption=SCP-5862, c. 1671|width=300px]]
SCP-5862 is the collective designation given to a 17th-century frigate and its crew, which have been infected by a highly virulent contagion, designated SCP-5862-Φ. This contagion has been shown to affect all non-aquatic material. This affect manifests as the breakdown of all infected material at the cellular level. 

All known metallic alloys will undergo rapid oxidization and organic material will experience accelerated decomposition. Living organisms will present with symptoms of rapid onset necrotizing fasciitis as well as greatly accelerated cellular regeneration.[[footnote]]This has the net effect of rendering all living individuals biologically immortal.[[/footnote]]

The ship is a two-masted fifth-class frigate designated SCP-5862-A, and is largely composed of biological material: specifically including sails made from human skin, spars and planks from bleached bone, and with a figurehead of a rotting body. It is believed to have been commissioned to play a role in the Third Anglo-Dutch War, though records suggest it never formally entered service.

Sir William Faulkner, designated SCP-5862-B, is the current captain of SCP-5862-A and has been since its commission at some point in the late 1670s. His body is in an advanced state of decay, with approximately 70% of his flesh showing signs of extensive decomposition. The majority of his active crew exhibit a similar level of decay.

++++++ **Discovery**
[[/div]]

The Foundation first learned about SCP-5862 on 04/13/2012 from a report sent by an embedded agent in “Turing's Wrath”, a Church of the Broken God splinter organisation designated GoI-3862. This organisation originally came to the Foundation's attention after carrying out a series of successful raids on known and suspected Karcists[[footnote]]High ranking priest-figures within various Sarkic cults[[/footnote]] which resulted in 17 casualties.

At this time, the agent became aware that GoI-3862 was planning a large operation related to a Sarkic artefact that could "greatly aid in the effort against the flesh". After the agent discovered a large cache of anomalous weaponry on 04/15/2012, MTF Stigma-9 (“Evolved from Naturally Occurring Gears, Levers and Pulleys”) were deployed to apprehend the members of GoI-3862 and confiscate their weapons cache. 

This operation was carried out successfully, and led to MTF ϛ-9 recovering the plans to carry out an assault on SCP-5862. These plans did not specify what GoI-3862 intended to do with SCP-5862, but they did contain an approximate location of SCP-5862.

Extensive interrogation of the captured GoI-3862 members produced no significant intelligence relating to SCP-5862 and they were subsequently released into GOC custody on 05/23/2012.

[[size 125%]]**SCPF Internal Memorandum**[[/size]]
[[/=]]
**FROM:** Dr. Cezar Iliescu, SCP-5862 Head Researcher
**TO:** Mariana Almeida, Director - Department of Nautical Anomalies 
**DATE:** 05/29/2012
**RE:** SCP-5862

It looks like the information we obtained from GoI-3862 has paid off.

Foundation Surveillance Satellite “Nemo's Watch” successfully located SCP-5862 at 48°██'██.█"S 136°██'██.█"W, a couple hundred kilometers S/SE of the Marshall Islands. I deployed aboard the //Kirck//, with an initial plan to observe and make contact if deemed safe.

We tailed her for 6 days, maintaining a distance of roughly 24 kilometers. Captain Nangolo wanted to keep us below the horizon, to prevent SCP-5862 becoming aware of us while we carried out covert surveillance using drones. 

The thing is ragged: it only took me one look to realize that this was certainly the ship we were looking for. I'm not sure how it has managed to stay afloat, but there it was. SCP-5862 does not appear to be at all seaworthy, and seeing how low it's sitting in the water, I would estimate that it is taking on a significant amount of water.

The ship is, quite literally, falling apart. There are obvious signs of accelerated decay in the spars and gunwales, and what sailcloth remains is hanging by threads. There's also a lot of an unknown white material that we can't visually identify, which seems to represent ad-hoc repair work done on the ship over time.

On the 7^^th^^ day, SCP-5862-A abruptly changed course and began to head straight for us. I directed Captain Nangolo to allow the distance to drop within visual range, which was established at 10.31am on 05/28/2012. The attached log records the events which followed.

**Date:** May 28, 2012
**Researcher:** Dr. Cezar Iliescu, Captain Nangolo
**Research Object(s):** SCP-5862
**Foreword:** //SCP-5862-A has moved to within 3km of the// Kirck //, and is continuing to close the distance.//
----

[BEGIN LOG]

**10:31 -** Captain Nangolo attempts to make radio contact with SCP-5862-A but receives no response.

**10:34 -** Captain Nangolo makes second and third attempts at radio contact with SCP-5862-A; there is no response.

**10:38 -** SCP-5862-A has reached a distance of approximately 2km from the //Kirck//, and appears to be changing course slightly to expose its port side to the //Kirck//.

**10:40 -** SCP-5862-A fires a single warning shot at the //Kirck//, which lands approximately 100m off the forward bow of the ship. Captain Nangolo enters a discussion with Dr Iliescu to determine the best course of action.

**10:41 -** A second warning shot is fired by SCP-5862-A, which lands approximately 50m off the port side of the //Kirck//. It is estimated that the //Kirck// will be in range for a full broadside in the next three minutes.

**10:42 -** The //Kirck// returns fire with a volley of five shots that land in a V pattern around the aft of the SCP-5862-A at a distance of approximately 5m.

**10:44 -** Captain Nangolo orders a crewman to begin signalling that the //Kirck// has no hostile intent via semaphore flags.

**10:45 -** A third warning shot is fired by SCP-5862-A. It is unclear if SCP-5862-B has understood the previous message.

**10:46 -** Upon seeing no reaction from the //Kirck//, SCP-5862-A fires a full broadside. Inconsequential damage is accrued to the //Kirck's// portside hull.

**10:47 -** Captain Nangolo orders a white flag to be raised.

SCP-5862-A moved to within 50m of the //Kirck//, which I surmised was to allow Captain Faulkner to communicate with us. With the agreement of Captain Nangolo, we cleared the foredeck and I went alone to speak with the Captain. 

The log of our conversation follows.

**Researcher:** Dr. Cezar Iliescu
**Research Object(s):** SCP-5862-B
**Foreword:** //This log was transcribed from surveillance footage taken from the// Kirck //after the conversation between Dr Iliescu and SCP-5862-B concluded. Dr. Iliescu is seen standing on the foredeck at the port side railing and is communicating using a voice amplification module. SCP-5862-B's words were picked up by the surveillance device attached to the prow.//

[BEGIN LOG]

//[SCP-5862-A appears to be made up of decaying timbers of various wood types, with significant areas of patching and repairs made up with what is obviously bone. Complete and partial skeletons can be seen at various points along the length of the vessel, adhered within the hull of SCP-5862-A with a substance that resembles tar, but with a pronounced reddish hue.]//

**Dr. Iliescu:** //[Using the module]// Unknown vessel, this is Doctor Cezar Iliescu aboard the SCPS //Kirck//. We wish-

//[He cuts off as a tall figure dressed in an elaborate assortment of belts and straps wound tightly about its torso and limbs steps out onto the deck. The figure bows slightly, then hesitates briefly before stepping up to the gunwale opposite Iliescu.//

//What remains of SCP-5862-B's face is mostly leathery skin stretched taut over heavily pronounced cheekbones. Thin tendons and muscle stretch to hold its jaw in place and glisten slightly as they flex to allow SCP-5862-B to speak. Its voice comes out as a dry hiss, barely audible above the moaning of the ship.]//

**SCP-5862-B:** Be ye the Captain of this ship?

**Dr. Iliescu:** No, but I am in charge here.

**SCP-5862-B:** Then why did ye not run like all the others? 'Twas for that purpose we fired upon ye, tae  warn ye off.

**Dr Iliescu:** We're interested in your vessel, and al-

**SCP-5862-B:** Be ye one of those Commissions bastards then?

**Dr. Iliescu:** ...Commissions?

**SCP-5862-B:** The //Right Honorable// Commission for Unusual Cargo? All, sailing round with their magic sceptres and holier-than-fuck attitudes that they claim is what keeps them safe and all that garbage?

**Dr. Iliescu:** Um, no, I'm not personally famili-

**SCP-5862-B:** Don't ye be lyin' to me, boy. Iff'n yer not, then ye be like 'em. None else 'twould sail so close and not be afeart. 

//[SCP-5862-B gestures over his shoulder at his crew.]//

**SCP-5862-B:** None of us would be here if 'tweren't for them and their promises to be keepin us safe. They be liars, one an all.

//[SCP-5862-B moves as if to spit over the railing, however, no fluid is observed to leave his mouth.]//

**Dr Iliescu:** So uh about yo-

**SCP-5862-B:** Ye be thinkin' that we //want// to be sailing 'round on a cursed ship? Harvesting each other for parts when she can't go on longer?

**Dr. Iliescu:** Are you im-

**SCP-5862-B:** Have you ever been kept awake at night by the tortured groans of yer ship beneath ya? The curses of the crew we was forced to replace the keel with? The screams of those we used to replace the walls when something gets hungry out in the sea an decides to come in for a nibble?

**Dr. Iliescu:** That sounds aw-

**SCP-5862-B:** Have ye ever had to flay what skin yer mate had left so's ye can repair yer very sails? Have ye ever felt an itch in yer bones that ye can't scratch for days at a time an' it just keeps gettin' worse and nothin' ye do be bringin' even a moment o' relief until ye wish ye were dead an' then it be years an' years later an' you're still in agony and ye can't even die?

**Dr. Iliescu:** I'm so sor-

**SCP-5862-B:** Leave this place. Leave me be. Afore we be spreadin' it to ya.
----
**Afterword:** //At this point SCP-5862-B turned from the gunwale and proceeded to yell at its crew to set the sail. It would not respond to repeated requests from Dr. Iliescu, and eventually the ship began to move off.//

We dropped back to follow SCP-5862 at a distance of about a kilometer. We will continue to observe until more suitable containment procedures are devised. Until then, we've been collecting samples from the various bits of detritus that SCP-5862-A leaves in its wake. I will have the samples analysed at Site-86, maybe they will be able to better tell us about the SCP-5862-Φ contagion.

**06/06/2012 Update -**

On May 31^^st^^, 2012, MTF ϛ-9 forwarded a tip that a different GoI-3862 cell was beginning preparations to make a second attempt at capturing SCP-5862. Dr Iliescu and the //Kirck// were immediately notified to go to condition yellow and to be on the alert for potential hostiles. 

The SCPS warship //Konlef// was diverted to the location, but due to the extreme isolation of the location, it was not expected to arrive in time to affect the outcome of any potential engagement. 

The following transcript was uploaded from the //Kirck// within 20 minutes of Dr Iliescu being alerted to the developing situation.

[BEGIN LOG]

**Dr. Iliescu:** Captain Faulkner. We need to speak.

//[silence for 10s]//

**Dr. Iliescu:** It's concerning the Church of the Broken God.

//[Silence for 18s]//

**Dr. Iliescu:** Damnit, man. It's about the followers of MEKHANE.

**SCP-5862-B:** With all due respect, why the fuck should I care about the machine heretics? That is an old hate.

**Dr. Iliescu:** //[Visibly surprised]// You know about them?

**SCP-5862-B:** Aye. Though 'twasn't a knowledge I started on this voyage with. We sail upon the sea eternal. Ye would be naive indeed to think we have not encountered other things the Commission would have the world forget.

**Dr. Iliescu:** They're interested in the pathogen you're infected with. We believe they want to infect Sarkics with it.

**SCP-5862-B:** They're welcome to come and get it, and it'll rot them too. 

**Dr. Iliescu:** And you're not concerned about them unleashing the pathogen?

**SCP-5862-B:** //[laughs quietly to itself]// 'twouldn't be the first time. There be a reason we are out here so far. 

**Dr. Iliescu:** That's kept you out of the world's attention for 400 years? Lurking quietly in the oceans, plundering only what's necessary, and keeping out of everyone's way? Hiding from the Mekhanites?

**SCP-5862-B:** //[inaudible]//

**Dr. Iliescu:** Excuse me?

**SCP-5862-B:** The time is not yet right. //[It pauses for a moment.]// Prepare yerself, foolish man. I tried twice to warn ye to leave us. First by firing upon yer ship, then with my pantomime of dread portents. Ye refused to be dissuaded, and now ye are to bear witness. 

//[It turns away from the gunwale and begins walking back towards its cabin.]//

**SCP-5862-B:** Be off with ye, I've preparations to complete.

**Afterword:** //Once again, SCP-5862-B cut off communication and refused to respond to Dr. Iliescu. The crew aboard SCP-5862-A can be seen preparing the ship for battle, though SCP-5862-A has retreated into its cabin.//

**Date:** June 2^^nd^^, 2012
**Researcher:** Dr. Cezar Iliescu, Captain Nangolo
**Research Object(s):** SCP-5862-B
**Foreword:** This footage was spliced together from edited CCTV and drone footage following an encounter with GoI-3862. At the start of the footage, four unidentified vessels had been detected on the //Kirck//'s radar system, incoming at a speed of 28 knots, with an expected arrival time of twenty minutes.
----
[BEGIN LOG]

**07:41 -** The oscillating light of the general quarters alarm can be seen to the side of the frame. Captain Nangolo is standing behind the helmsman looking through a pair of binoculars out to sea. 

**07:52 -** The deck guns of the //Kirck// fire several warning shots at the oncoming vessels, with no observable response. 

**07:53 -** Hostile missile launch detected. Unidentified vessels are reclassified as enemy combatants. The //Kirck// point defence system automatically engages, destroying all four of the incoming missiles.

**07:55 -** Captain Nangolo gives the order to return fire, and the view vibrates as four medium-range missiles launch from the //Kirck//. 

**07:58 -** The enemy ships evade and destroy the missiles from the //Kirck// and launch another wave of missiles, each vessel contributing two missiles to the wave. These missiles behave in a manner inconsistent with the previous projectiles, weaving erratically before plunging into the water and proceeding on an attack vector more appropriate to torpedoes.

**08:01 -** Multiple impact alerts are signaled on the bridge of the //Kirck//, and the ship rapidly assumes a 2° sustained angle of list to port.

**08:04 -** All power aboard the //Kirck// abruptly ceases. Video feed shifts to one of the overhead drones. The oncoming attackers break off their approach to the //Kirck// and change course to intercept SCP-5862-A.

**08:10 -** The assaulting vessels can be seen corralling SCP-5862-A, but do not appear to be firing upon the ship. Several figures can be seen on the decks of the boats, pointing what are assumed to be weapons at SCP-5862-A.

**08:12 -** SCP-5862-A opens fire upon the assault craft, plumes of smoke issuing from the port, then the starboard side as both ranks of cannon fire. The shot appears to have no effect on the unknown vessels.

**08:19 -** The vessels reach SCP-5862-A and deploy grappling hooks. Figures can be seen scaling the hull of SCP-5862-A where they encounter the crew standing in ranks on the main deck. SCP-5862-B exits its cabin along with another figure[[footnote]]Designated PoI-XXXX-1[[/footnote]]. 

**08:20 -** The invading force immediately opens fire upon PoI-XXXX-1. Multiple projectiles can be seen impacting its body, each tearing several visible holes that reseal themselves almost immediately. PoI-XXXX-1 stumbles briefly, then reaches towards the attackers.

**08:21 -** Fluid erupts from the attackers and each of them fall to the deck where they appear to writhe and twist. Additional fluid can be seen pooling around them before being absorbed into the wood of the deck.

**08:23 -** PoI-XXXX-1 walks to the gunwale then dives cleanly into the water. Moments later, several large tentacles lift free of the water surrounding the four attacking vessels. They attempt to evade, but are ensnared and dragged underwater.

**08:30 -** PoI-XXXX-1 can be seen climbing aboard the //Kirck//, where it is greeted by Dr Iliescu and several members of the //Kirck's// security detail. They speak for several minutes, with Dr Iliescu gesticulating with apparent anger.

**08:41 -** Dr Iliescu turns to walk away, and PoI-XXXX-1 looks up at the drone circling overhead. It makes a flicking gesture at it and a moment later the video feed dies.

[END LOG]
----
**Afterword:** //The SCPS// Konclef //arrived on the scene 22 hours later to find no trace of the// Kirck //or SCP-5862. The GPS tracking devices on board the// Kirck //were disabled in the power outage and were not re-engaged.
