**Item #:** SCP-2446

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Police, news, and civilian reports in the San Jose metropolitan area are to be monitored for SCP-2446. Reports are to be officially scrubbed from record, and persons involved in the discovery or documentation of SCP-2446 are to be administered class-B amnestics. All SCP-2446-1 retrieved are to be transported to Site-76 for containment and analysis.

Should any SCP-2446-1 manifest partially or entirely inside of a permanent structure, retrieval personnel are to be dispatched to remove the instance and repair affected structures. SCP-2446-1 are to be removed as quickly as possible to minimize chances of civilian discovery.

Members of Mobile Task Force Lambda-5 (“White Rabbits”) are not to be informed of the nature of SCP-2446-1 instances.

**Description:** SCP-2446 designates the occasional spontaneous manifestation of humanoid corpses (SCP-2446-1) in a roughly 12 kilometer area of San Jose, California. At least two instances have been directly observed manifesting, and have not demonstrated any limitations of time or location. Certain instances have been found partially or entirely inside of other matter. ██ SCP-2446-1 have been retrieved by Foundation personnel, however it is unknown how many may be unaccounted for underground or inside permanent infrastructure.

All SCP-2446-1 share physical and genetic profiles with members of Foundation personnel, typically agents involved with Mobile Task Force Lambda-5 (“White Rabbits”). Multiple such duplicates have appeared for single agents, however differences (namely in weight, build, tattoo patterns, etc.) have been cited between instances and related persons (See Addendum 1 for details). Most intact SCP-2446-1 manifest in an early state of putrefaction.

SCP-2446-1 tend to appear in dress similar to Foundation-issue Mobile Task Force combat gear. Style and composition of such dress (as well as worn equipment) vary with some frequency. SCP-2446-1 which do not manifest in MTF gear manifest in standard civilian clothes. Certain physical factors, like the weight of an instance, vary between duplicates, however genetic makeup never seriously differs. Clothes and gear retrieved from SCP-2446-1 also vary in style and construction.

**Addendum: Research Report 2446.21**
//Due in part to recent developments in reality-measuring technology, research and retrieval teams have initiated investigations into potential origins of SCP-2446. Although correlation between recorded Hume deficiencies and SCP-2446 have not been confirmed, certain reading fall outside of acceptable parameters for operation. Based on humological maps of the area, spatial disturbances most likely originate from an apartment complex located at 2525 N Waterworks St. Direct investigation is forthcoming.//
