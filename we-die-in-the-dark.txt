> Dear Ms. Jacobs,
> 
> It is with the deepest regret that I write to you today. Your son, Mickey, has been killed in action in the course of his duties under my command. The loss of a child is difficult for any parent. Yet you should know that Agent Mickey Jacobs was one of the finest men I ever commanded. 
> 
> Mick was kind and dutiful; with an easy smile. A smile he professed on several occasions, he got from you. The impact that his loss has had on us can only be a fraction of that which you must now be experiencing. 
> 
> His devotion to the principles of honor and self-sacrifice lived in every part of his life. And it was self-sacrifice of the highest order that led to his death. It is left to me, then, to provide my fullest devotion to the principle of honor, and it is that honor that demands from me a truthful retelling of the events which led to his passing.
> 
> First, in the interest of frankness: your son was not a security guard for a lumber company. Your son was a hero.
> 
> On August 18th of this year your son was stationed at one of our organization's facilities in South Alabama. A security breach occurred in one of our high risk sectors and your son was sent in as part of a team of individuals to stop the threat. Your son was at the front of a formation of 7 agents when an automated door sealed him inside the facility without his team.
> 
> With no support and with spotty communication, your son made his way towards danger, providing fire support for the site's security staff on one of the lower levels. He was then tasked by the site director to rescue several of our research staff from the monsters that now roamed the site.
> 
> He was killed during the final rescue of these staff. Today a dozen of our best minds are alive because of your son.
> 
> I cannot begin to understand the sorrow you must now feel, but know that your son's death was not in vain, and that he will be remembered by all those who knew him as a brave, dutiful, and honorable man.
> 
> Sincerely, and most remorsefully yours, Agent Jonathan Bradley
