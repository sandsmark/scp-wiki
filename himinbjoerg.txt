> **Abstract:** Contact was lost with Site-19 on 2 February 2087, following the initiation of a Category 5 (“Catastrophic”) Containment Breach Lockdown. Amalgamate Task Force 4 (“Götterdämmerung”) was dispatched to detonate the on-site warheads and recover survivors, as per the Lifthrasir Protocol. 
> 
> **< BEGIN LOG >**
> 
> **Sturluson:** Status check. We all good?
> 
> **Wagner:** Check.
> 
> **Lindow:** Yep.
> 
> **Byock:** Think so.
> 
> **Jarvis:** Correct.
> 
> **Sturluson:** Right. Let's get this done quick – Nineteen isn’t going to be as friendly as usual. 
> 
> **Jarvis:** The morale of Site Nineteen staff is not relevant to this mission.
> 
> **Lindow:** Just open the damn door, Jarvis.
> 
> //ATF 4 enter Site-19 via a side-entrance connected to the site cafeteria. The cafeteria shows signs of use from prior to the lockdown initiation. Jarvis closes and re-engages the lock behind them.//
> 
> **Lindow:** Great.
> 
> **Sturluson:** What?
> 
> **Lindow:** Spag’ and bol’. Every time there’s a chance for me to have spag’ and bol’, I’m busy with something.
> 
> **Wagner:** Probability anomaly. They’re common nowadays.
> 
> **Byock:** What, do you have one?
> 
> **Wagner:** I’ve had one for a long time.
> 
> **Lindow:** What is it?
> 
> **Wagner:** Women.
> 
> **Jarvis:** Incorrect. There are no records of Agent Wagner hosting any anomalous phenomena. Agent Lindow is also present.
> 
> **Sturluson:** Jarvis?
> 
> **Jarvis:** Yes, Agent Sturluson.
> 
> **Sturluson:** Humour.
> 
> //ATF 4 exit the cafeteria and navigate toward the Site-19 research wing, via the staff quarters.//
> 
> **Wagner:** The doors should be closed.
> 
> **Jarvis:** Containment breach lockdown procedures necessitates the manual closing and locking of all doorways to restrict movement of anomalous entities.
> 
> **Lindow:** Manual? Can’t the system close all the doors?
> 
> **Jarvis:** Site-19 does not feature a remote door control network. 
> 
> **Sturluson:** It’s because of the digital anomalies stored here, like [[[SCP-2522 | twenty-five twenty-two]]] and fifty-six seventy-nine. Can’t risk them getting control.
> 
> **Byock:** Is it safe for Jarvis to be with us? Couldn’t he go full Hatbot on us?
> 
> **Jarvis:** Incorrect. I have not interfaced with the Site-19 network and cannot be accessed without physical connection.
> 
> **Sturluson:** If we destroyed Hatbot and Penny Royal, would it –
> 
> **Wagner:** This door’s been forced.
> 
> **Lindow:** What?
> 
> //Agent Wagner points to a doorway. The bulkhead door has been crumpled to one side. A corpse is visible several metres ahead.//
> 
> **Lindow:** Her head is on backwards.
> 
> //Agent Wagner searches the corpse.//
> 
> **Wagner:** Her neck has been broken.
> 
> **Lindow:** No shit. She got ID?
> 
> **Wagner:** Donna Lystrae.
> 
> **Jarvis:** Doctor Donna Lystrae catalogued as deceased.
> 
> **Byock:** Lets uh, get moving before we’re next.
> 
> **Sturluson:** Lets. We’ll go to item storage first.
> 
> //ATF 4 navigates toward Site-19’s item storage wing. All doors are open, or are crumpled aside to allow access. Multiple corpses of on-site personnel are encountered, with varying causes of death. Agent Byock is forced to stop after encountering a D-class fused with an interior wall. Despite signs of containment breaches, no uncontained anomalies are encountered.//
> 
> **Lindow:** Hey, hold up. This door’s closed.
> 
> **Byock:** Isn’t this Shapey’s room?
> 
> **Wagner:** Yes. Looks like this door has been damaged to stop it from opening.
> 
> **Lindow:** Understandable. Shapey probably didn’t want anything getting at him.
> 
> **Wagner:** It’s been damaged from this side. Jarvis, can you open this door?
> 
> **Jarvis:** Yes.
> 
> //Jarvis forces the bulkhead to [[[SCP-1831]]]'s containment chamber to open. A dismembered D-class is scattered across the room; it is otherwise empty.//
> 
> **Byock:** Guess Shapey decided to bolt instead.
> 
> **Lindow:** D-class is, uh… number six-eight-four-three-nine.
> 
> **Jarvis:** SCP-1831 catalogued as uncontained. D-68439 catalogued as deceased.
> 
> **Sturluson:** Everyone knows what Shapey is, right?
> 
> **Wagner:** Higher-dimensional construct, part of the Little Misters.
> 
> **Sturluson:** Right, and everyone knew he could just leave any time he wanted, and there’d be nothing we could do to stop him.
> 
> **Lindow:** That’s a good point.
> 
> **Jarvis:** Query. What is the point?
> 
> **Sturluson:** Why would you stop Shapey from using the door, if you know he can just go around it? 
> 
> **Jarvis:** …
> 
> **Lindow:** I think you broke him.
> 
> **Jarvis:** Incorrect. I am fully functional.
> 
> **Byock:** Sure you are.
> 
> //ATF 4 navigate to the item storage wing. All containment chambers encountered en route have been damaged to prevent them from opening; all anomalies are accounted for.//
> 
> **Lindow:** This must be the work of an – stand up would you.
> 
> **Byock:** Sorry. Nerves.
> 
> **Sturluson:** Its fine. This really should be a Hammer Down job. 
> 
> **Wagner:** Why aren't they here?
> 
> **Sturluson:** Too understaffed, just like every other task force. Which ones are you four from?
> 
> **Lindow:** Zeta Nine, Mole Rats.
> 
> **Wagner:** Rho One, The Professors.
> 
> **Jarvis:** Mobile Task Force Kappa-10 “Skynet.”
> 
> **Byock:** … Rho Nine, Technical Support.
> 
> **Lindow:** I’m sorry, what? You’re from tech support?
> 
> **Sturluson:** Lindow.
> 
> **Lindow:** Why the hell is he here? Why – have you even been in the field before?
> 
> **Sturluson:** Gamma five.
> 
> **Lindow:** What?
> 
> **Sturluson:** I’m from Gamma Five. Red Herrings.
> 
> **Lindow:** Great. We’ve got a trained operative, a book head, a brick-headed robot, his pit crew, and we’re being led by a liar.
> 
> **Sturluson:** Watch it, Lindow.
> 
> **Lindow:** No. Why the fuck are you in charge? I’m the one –
> 
> **Jarvis:** Proximity alert!
> 
> //The door behind ATF 4 closes. An unseen force strikes it from the other side, indenting the door and preventing it from opening. ATF 4 run to the item storage wing, stopping upon arrival.//
> 
> **Wagner:** Jarvis, what was it?
> 
> **Jarvis:** Unknown, mobile entity. 
> 
> **Byock:** Had it been following us this whole damn time?
> 
> **Jarvis:** Unknown.
> 
> **Lindow:** Sounded like a machine gun – five seventy-seven?
> 
> **Jarvis:** Possible. Data insufficient for confirmation.
> 
> **Sturluson:** It’s nasty and fast, that’s all we need to know. Nineteen has internal sensors all over the place, right?
> 
> **Wagner:** Yes. 
> 
> **Sturluson:** Byock, will you be able to get into the sensor readings?
> 
> **Byock:** Well, yeah. Just need a terminal.
> 
> **Sturluson:** Right, and there should be one in the item containment wing.
> 
> //ATF 4 reach the item storage wing within three minutes. Four additional doors are closed and rendered inoperable during the time frame; the offending entity remains out of sight at all times.//
> 
> **Lindow:** For a catastrophic containment breach, it’s rather – oh boy.
> 
> **Sturluson:** Sweet easter. How many of them are there?
> 
> **Jarvis:** Thirty-five casualties catalogued.
> 
> **Byock:** Fuck…
> 
> **Sturluson:** Just find out if there’s anyone left. If there isn’t we’ll just hit the nukes and bolt. Wagner, what are you doing?
> 
> **Wagner:** Some of the skips stored here could be useful assets. I’m seeing what is supposed to be stored here.
> 
> **Lindow:** Leave them alone. They’re in containment, and the place is getting nuked for a reason. Or did you forget the whole reason we’re here? 
> 
> **Wagner:** To destroy all of the dangerous skips, yes. But the ones here in storage are mundane, if not beneficial. Example, [[[SCP-109 | one-oh-nine]]]; a bottle that provides and endless supply of beneficial… It’s gone.
> 
> **Jarvis:** SCP-109 catalogued as uncontained.
> 
> **Sturluson:** It might’ve been in testing when the breach happened. 
> 
> **Wagner:** A shame. It would have been useful.
> 
> **Byock:** I’m in.
> 
> **Sturluson:** Is there anyone else other than us?
> 
> **Byock:** One.
> 
> **Lindow:** Fuck.
> 
> **Sturluson:** Just one? Are you sure?
> 
> **Byock:** As sure as the system is; one human-shaped warmth spot that’s moving around.
> 
> **Wagner:** Do you know who it is?
> 
> **Byock:** No way of knowing. Could be a D-class, could be the site director – we have to check to find out.
> 
> **Lindow:** Screw them. We set the nuke up, and we get the hell out of here.
> 
> **Byock:** You're joking.
> 
> **Lindow:** No I'm not, screen boy. We're only supposed to rescue if we're able.
> 
> **Wagner:** There is no reason we cannot recover them. We are not constrained to any time limits, nor have we suffered any injuries. 
> 
> **Sturluson:** We get the survivor, then we rig the nuke.
> 
> **Lindow:** And what if we don't make it to the nuke, hmm? Fat lot of good saving one shmuck will do us when stuff like ninety-five seventy-three is running around because nobody blew it up first.
> 
> **Jarvis:** Agent Lindow is correct. Nuclear detonation is the primary objective of this mission, and must be ensured.
> 
> **Lindow:** Thank you, Jarvis.
> 
> **Sturluson:** Jarvis, do you know how to start the countdown?
> 
> **Jarvis:** Correct.
> 
> **Sturluson:** Fine then. You and Lindow can go set up the nuke — set it for an hour, then  leave. Me, Byock and Wagner will go fetch the survivor. Use your radio if you need us.
> 
> **Lindow:** Fine.
> 
> //Jarvis and Agent Lindow leave the remainder of the group.//
> 
> **Byock:** Isn't splitting up a bad idea?
> 
> **Sturluson:** It lets us multitask, and they weren't going to come with us anyway. Where's the survivor?
> 
> **Byock:** That's the odd part — they're inside a containment chamber.
> 
> **Wagner:** That mustn't be a survivor. It's a skip.
> 
> **Byock:** It's not. All the humanoid sips are accounted for; in their container, or dead. The containment chamber isn't registered for a humanoid either, so it's moved at minimum.
> 
> **Sturluson:** Fine, lead the way.
> 
> //Several minutes elapse as Agents Sturluson, Byock and Wagner navigate to Site-19's Euclid containment wing.//
> 
> **Lindow, Radio:** Sturluson, we got a problem.
> 
> **Sturluson:** What now.
> 
> **Lindow, Radio:** The nukes are buggered. Controls are smashed beyond repair, manual override is wrecked. Looks like our friend came through and disarmed them.
> 
> **Sturluson:** Fucking… is there anything Jarvis can do? Can he fix it?
> 
> //Agent Lindow does not respond.//
> 
> **Sturluson:** Lindow, can Jarvis fix it?
> 
> //Agent Lindow does not respond.//
> 
> **Sturluson:** Lindow, are you there?
> 
> **Byock:** If the interfaces are screwed, there’s nothing we can do. We’ll have to come back with a functional one.
> 
> **Sturluson:** Lindow, respond!
> 
> **Wagner:** She isn’t going to respond.
> 
> **Sturluson:** And how would you know that?
> 
> **Wagner:** Because Jarvis isn’t responding either. 
> 
> **Byock:** Look, we just… we just get the guy, get out of here, right? We, we tell the others that the consoles were destroyed, and they bring someone else in to clean up, right?
> 
> **Wagner:** I don’t think we have any other choices, excluding abandoning the survivor.
> 
> **Sturluson:** No. We said we were going to get them, and we’re going to get them.
> 
> **Byock:** Well we’d better bust a move before – fuck!
> 
> //[[[SCP-173]]] appears in front of Agent Byock. Agents Sturluson and Wagner maintain eye contact with SCP-173 while Agent Byock recovers.//
> 
> **Sturluson:** Get up Byock, we need to move.
> 
> **Wagner:** Blinking.
> 
> **Sturluson:** Shut the door.
> 
> **Byock:** Shut… yeah, shut the…
> 
> //Agent Byock closes a door, obstructing line-of-sight with SCP-173. The door is struck from the other side until a crack forms in the door.//
> 
> **Wagner:** It’s going to smash through.
> 
> //ATF 4 proceed to the Euclid containment wing at an accelerated pace. SCP-173 pursues the group, destroying obstructions while unobserved. On several occasions it utilises alternate routes in an attempt to outflank the group; the open doorways throughout the site enable it to traverse large distances unnoticed by the group. Agent Byock leads the group to the inhabited containment chamber.//
> 
> **Byock:** This… this is the one.
> 
> **Sturluson:** You’re joking.
> 
> **Wagner:** This is seventeen-three’s chamber.
> 
> **Byock:** And it’s got the guy in it. It’s not my fault he picked this one.
> 
> **Sturluson:** Fine just… just get the doors open. Wagner, watch that other door over there.
> 
> //Agent Byock opens the bulkhead doors; damage sustained prevents them from opening enough to allow access.//
> 
> **Byock:** It’s stuck!
> 
> **???:** Have you started the countdown?
> 
> //Agents Sturluson and Wagner leave their positions, attempting to  force the bulkhead doors open.//
> 
> **Sturluson:** No sir. The nukes have been destroyed.
> 
> **Wagner:** It’s not moving.
> 
> **Sturluson:** Keep trying. Byock, get over here!
> 
> **???:** No. You three, leave. The next group can fetch me.
> 
> **Sturluson:** Sir, you know –
> 
> //The lights in the main room flicker.//
> 
> **???:** It doesn’t bother me. Just go, now. 
> 
> //All lights in the main room turn off. The sound of a door being destroyed is heard, followed by three snaps in quick succession. SCP-173 appears at the gap in the bulkhead, illuminated by the containment chamber’s interior lighting and facing in.//
> 
> **???:** Fuck you. I'll get out eventually.
> 
> //SCP-173 disappears from view before the bulkhead doors are closed again.//
> 
> **< END LOG >**
