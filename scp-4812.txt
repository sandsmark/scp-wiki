**Designation Memorandum:** Due to the unique nature of SCP-4812-S, -E, and -K’s relationship, a single object designation is used to denote the three entities as a group. However, each are considered their own individual anomalies, and are described within this file as such.

**Classification Memorandum:** Due to the unique nature of of SCP-4812-S, -E, and -K, each entity has been assigned an individual containment class.

* **SCP-4812-S:** Safe[[footnote]]Pending further evaluation.[[/footnote]]
* **SCP-4812-E:** Euclid[[footnote]]As of 08/20/2003.[[/footnote]]
* **SCP-4812-K:** Keter[[footnote]]Pending evaluation, as SCP-4812-K is currently uncontained.[[/footnote]]
* **███-████-█:** SEE ADDENDUM 4812.4.

**Special Containment Procedures:**

* **SCP-4812-S:** SCP-4812-S is contained at its location of discovery. The entrance to the cave containing SCP-4812-S is to be sealed by three maximum-security vault doors. Entrance to SCP-4812-S’s site of containment is forbidden to any individuals without proper credentials. Under no circumstances should SCP-4812-S be exposed to any amount of light. SCP-4812-S is to be interacted with only by members of the fully-blind MTF Vestus-12 "Northern Star". 

[[span style="margin-left:40px"]]Under no circumstances should SCP-4812-S be exposed to either SCP-4812-E or SCP-4812-K.[[/span]]

* **SCP-4812-E:** SCP-4812-E is contained within a thermally controlled vault at Site-80. Due to the nature of SCP-4812-E’s anomalous capabilities, its containment chamber must be kept at a constant 1,400°C. SCP-4812-E itself is contained within a tank of molten iron. Direct maintenance of SCP-4812-E’s containment chamber must take place outside of the cell due to the intense heat within. Special remote drones equipped with hafnium-carbide exteriors are to be used in maintaining the interior of SCP-4812-E’s containment cell. A drop in internal temperature of more than 50°C must be considered a breach of containment. 

[[span style="margin-left:40px"]]Under no circumstances should SCP-4812-E be exposed to either SCP-4812-S or SCP-4812-K.[[/span]]

* **SCP-4812-K:** SCP-4812-K is currently uncontained. Due to the location and nature of SCP-4812-K, it is unlikely that its existence will be exposed, but caution must be taken in ensuring that any information pertaining to the entity is suppressed. Foundation information security assets are to monitor web traffic for any images, accounts, or recordings of SCP-4812-K. Further research into the nature of SCP-4812-K is required to prevent additional exposure should the entity present itself on Earth once again. 

[[span style="margin-left:40px"]]Under no circumstances should SCP-4812-K be exposed to SCP-4812-S and SCP-4812-E.[[/span]]

**Description:** SCP-4812 is the group designation for three anomalous entities, SCP-4812-S, -E, and -K, and a series of recovered documents (SCP-4812-1) that describe them.

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-4812-S" hide="- CLOSE DATA FILE"]]
**SCP-4812-S** is a large, amorphous entity located in a subterranean cavern near Alès, France. SCP-4812-S is attached to the walls of its cavern by a large number of long, adhesive-covered appendages that extend out of the main mass of the entity. Similar appendages cover SCP-4812-S’s entire body, though the majority are curled and tucked up to its central mass. Each of the appendages, and indeed SCP-4812-S’s entire body, is covered in fine, hydrophobic hair.

SCP-4812-S is a Class-XIII visual hazard. Any living being that perceives SCP-4812-S visually will experience a violent biological reaction that is invariably fatal. Direct visual perception of SCP-4812-S is akin to exposure of the eyes, brain, and nervous system to an extremely caustic acid. The effect of SCP-4812-S is immediate and cannot be avoided once exposed. Victims will experience severe pain, bleeding through the skin and orifices, paralysis, asphyxiation, and eventually, death. The effect persists across all visual media, as images and video recordings of SCP-4812 will carry the same effect, though slightly less immediate and violent.

Due to the nature of SCP-4812-S, it is unknown what the entity’s true appearance is. Individuals interacting with SCP-4812-S must do so in total darkness and wearing airtight suits, as even the minute and imperceptible amount of light naturally emitted by human beings is enough to trigger the effect of SCP-4812-S. It is unknown how light interacts with the surface of SCP-4812-S, as any individual who has looked at it for any amount of time has already died. Even the hairs on SCP-4812-S’s body, when shaved off and exposed to light, create a similar albeit lessened effect[[footnote]]Exposure to the hairs under light typically results in severe nausea, hallucinations, and swelling of the eyes and brain. While this is not necessarily fatal if exposure is limited and the subject is given immediate medical attention, this exposure is still extremely dangerous and nearly always results in death.[[/footnote]]  as the main body of the entity. SCP-4812-S’s ability is contained by darkness, as humans are capable of interacting with the entity if they cannot perceive it visually.

Beyond being an extreme anomalous visual hazard, SCP-4812-S is otherwise immobile and does not appear to react to touch or noise. SCP-4812-S’s body is composed of organic matter, though spectral analysis has not been possible due to the nature of SCP-4812-S’s anomalous makeup. It is believed that SCP-4812-S’s tendril-like appendages extend deep into the earth around the cavern in which it is contained, though proper analysis of this has been difficult.

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-4812-E" hide="- CLOSE DATA FILE"]]
**SCP-4812-E** is a large humanoid (~15m in height) entity composed primarily of platinum with traces of tungsten and other metallic compounds. SCP-4812-E’s features are vaguely skeletal in appearance, though when in containment they are not visible due to the effect of high temperature on its metallic body.

SCP-4812-E is a near-perfect heatsink; the temperature of its body when uncontained maintains a constant 0.0000000031K. SCP-4812-E does not experience thermal exchange; instead of acting in a way that would eventually reach thermal equilibrium, SCP-4812-E absorbs energy at a net loss to its surroundings. The rate at which this occurs is extremely rapid, and SCP-4812-E is capable of reducing a 10m x 10m x 10m containment cell at room temperature to near absolute zero in roughly sixteen seconds. Due to this, SCP-4812-E is continuously surrounded by an opaque field of frozen air and water and its true appearance is impossible to see unless exposed to high temperatures.

Exposure to SCP-4812-E is nearly invariably lethal; subjects that are exposed to SCP-4812-E usually succumb in seconds as the temperature of the air around them plummets and the water within their bodies freezes. Even heavily insulated protective suits will only allow the wearer moments of protection from the effects of exposure. SCP-4812-E’s effect may be mitigated, however, by exposure to extreme heat. While SCP-4812-E’s effect is rapid when uncontained, if exposed to extremely high temperatures SCP-4812-E’s effect weakens substantially. This has made SCP-4812-E containable, so long as the entity is contained under constant high temperatures.

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-4812-K" hide="- CLOSE DATA FILE"]]
**SCP-4812-K** is a massive, silver winged insectoid bearing similarities to both stag beetles and scorpions. SCP-4812-K is roughly 180m in length, with six appendages (the forward two leading to large pincers) and a long, segmented tail ending in a pointed, serrated barb. However, in place of insectoid mouth and eyes, SCP-4812-K has the face of a man no larger than that of a typical human male[[footnote]]As such, SCP-4812-K’s face is dwarfed by the rest of its body.[[/footnote]]. SCP-4812-K has four wings that extend out of its back, and its entire body is covered in a thick, highly reflective biological chitin. 

SCP-4812-K spends the overwhelming majority of its time in the upper stratosphere, where it rarely moves in any perceptible way except to flap its wings to maintain altitude. The existence of SCP-4812-K was not realized until the discovery of SCP-4812-1, due in part to SCP-4812-K’s near-invisibility[[footnote]]Due to the reflective silver chitin its body is composed of and the fact that SCP-4812-K produces no heat and does not reflect sound.[[/footnote]] and its high rate of speed as it travels. SCP-4812-K routinely reaches speeds in excess of 800 km/h. SCP-4812-K does not respond to attempts to communicate with it, and will engage vehicles that draw too close to it (within roughly 700m).

Several attempts have been made to secure SCP-4812-K in order to move it to a containment cell - however, all attempts have thus far failed. Fighter jets and remote assault drones have been able to keep pace with the entity, but are easily incapacitated by the entity’s raw physical strength and size. Additionally, no weaponry used on SCP-4812-K to date has been able to damage it in any perceptible way. On the contrary, anything that strikes the entity seemingly rebounds with the same kinetic energy as it did on approach, leading researchers to believe that SCP-4812-K is, in some way, a near-perfect reflector.

**Addendum 4812.1:** Contents of SCP-4812-1

SCP-4812-1 is a series of recovered documents and artifacts recovered from a collection of anomalous items previously held by Dutch collector Markus de Wees before his death. This collection, given the name “The Connington Set[[footnote]]Likely named after 18th century English archaeologist and occultist Winston J. Connington, whose research led Foundation agents to the discovery of SCP-2254, SCP-████, SCP-████, and SCP-████.[[/footnote]]”, contains the following items:

* Sixteen coins of various shapes and sizes, none of which account for any known denomination of currency,
* Five papyrus scrolls, Egyptian in origin, that appear to be ancient star maps. Analysis of these maps indicate that there were once notes written in the margins - however, these notes have been bleached out and are no longer decipherable.
* Three large tomes bound in leather-wrapped hardwood, penned in German, full of what appear to be archaic coordinates. One of the books also marks changes in temperature. These books were seemingly written over the course of many years.
* A brass spyglass with a cracked crystal lense. A piece of the cracked lense is missing. Looking through the spyglass, several small, ornate mechanisms are visible within. However, they appear to have been damaged in the past and are no longer functional.
* A thick burlap sack that apparently contains at least three more consecutive burlap sacks with a thick, gelatinous mass at its center. Looking at this sack tends to make subjects feel ill and suffer from a slight burning sensation behind the eyes.
* A pair of glasses with iron frames and solid iron lenses. One of the lenses is damaged. When worn by human subjects, a slight glow is visible through the iron lenses when looking at the burlap sack.
* A thin circlet made of gold and platinum. Has three prongs situated around the entire ring, two of which appear to have been broken off near the base. The third contains a small glass sphere that is warm to the touch.
* A journal written by Winston J. Connington. Contains depictions of all three SCP-4812 entities and the personal research of Dr. Connington himself.

Of the three tomes containing coordinates, the second has a short section written in Italian by, presumably, a different author than the rest of the tome[[footnote]]The second tome is believed to be the only tome that has a single author.[[/footnote]]. The beginning of the section is a list of names and dates, with an orthodox dating system; many of the dates are written with another number beside the year, such as "1343 [89]" listed next to the name "Tornold of Yire". After the list of names comes a section where the author appears to have been listing notes to include in the longer section that comes afterwards. The translated text of the longer section is available below:

Of all of those old kingdoms and empires whose names were lost to the passing of time or the cruel mechanisms of their enemies, perhaps none is greater or spoken with more respect than that of the great House of Apollyon, the Sky Kings of Old Europ. The first of those great kings, Harrian Von Apollyon I, is said to have descended from the blood of the King of Crimson Skies (often called Asem - the First Man), a legendary figure in the writings of the three Archmaesters of King Richard the Lionheart's court. The sky-

The text cuts off abruptly here, but continues in the next paragraph. A mark is made at the end of that line, as if to note it for revision.

The Sky Kings are said to have ruled Old Europ for a hundred generations. Though they faced opposition from the Daeva to the east and those faithful to the iron god in the south, their kingdom never faltered and their conquests were fruitful. It was the conquered foes of the House of Apollyon who first named the King Idus Von Apollyon "Sky King", for it was said his reach extended past the bounds of the earth and into the heavens above.

However, over time came also complacency. In the 890th year of their rule, the Sky King Sarrus Von Apollyon VIII is said to have grown bored with ruling and demanded a conquest of another, greater realm beyond their own. In his arrogance he looked past the lands of man and towards those across the sea, where the Fair Folk were said to live. The Sky King boarded his ships and with the largest army ever assembled, drove with fury across the waves towards the continent to the west. 

The Fair Folk, consumed with their own conflicts with the emergent power of the Children of the Moon to their south, did not expect the arrival of Apollyon and were consumed in a fortnight, their people scattered and their nobility stripped down and mutilated, in accordance with the customs of the conquerors. Only a single survivor of the brutality, a fae princess, was brought back in iron chains across the sea to suffer further horrors.

The princess, though, had no intentions of arriving on the far shores of Ole Europ. As the King's fleet passed the great Eye of the Sea, she cast a wicked and wild spell upon the House of Apollyon, and the Sky King in particular. As a storm came upon them and brought many men and ships to the bottom of the sea, the princess prayed to an old and nameless god for vengeance upon her captors. Legend says the princess' iron chains caught fire and burned the King's flagship to cinders, and that Sarrus VIII himself was dragged into the deep by those same chains as he tried to throw them overboard.

The fleet, however, did return to Old Europ, where the young Sarrus Von Apollyon IX now ruled his father's kingdom. As retribution for the curse the princess had cast upon his father, Sarrus IX threw the princess into a dungeon deep beneath the earth and buried it, leaving her to rot eternally in the darkness. Afterwards, as a bulwark against the dark magics of the Fair Folk that his father's conquest may have brought upon his house, Sarrus IX appointed four great knights to defend his kingdom. They were La Hire the Fierce, Lancelot the Cunning, Hector the Stalwart and Ogier the Faithful. 

But the princess

While many of the others items are generally unremarkable, of particular interest to researchers is the journal of Dr. Connington. The majority of the text in the journal is written in a cipher, with very few sections (usually small notes that are not relevant to the rest of the text) that are written in German. 

A few short sections have been translated, due to a section of the cipher being inscribed on the inside of one of the larger tomes. The text contained therein has been translated and is available below:

The archivist of that great house named the first of the great profanities in the "Sixth Chapters of the Reign of the King Sarrus Von Apollyon IX" when he wrote,

//Sorrowful was the Sky King Apollyon when the voice of the Enemy Beneath the Earth spoke to the souls of his knights, and he did banish them each. The long night settled over his kingdom and the winter winds came from the east - but Hector did not answer. Down from the far darkness came the Vinuvinex, what they called the Profane Restrictor, the first of the great profanities. The Vinuvinex cast a cold hand across the King's only daughter, and in her youth and weakness she did die.//

//The King took upon him the Godless Lance and came down to the Vinuvinex, and with nothing but the Mammoth's Hide between him and the infinite cold drove that sacred spear into the Vinuvinex and put it into the flaming heart of the Earth.//

The star maps vexed me, but tracing them in the sky and following the movement of the **star that cannot be seen** I caught but for a moment a glimpse of the face of the one that La Hire had called the //Profane Adamant//. The text does not name it but the Daeva to the east had a name for that star, what they called the Lamenellant, or "The King of Many Faces". Three accounts of the Orator Magister of the Daeva king describe the Lamenellant, the Profane Adamant in the tongue of the great house, appearing as if from a space beyond spaces to the kingdom's ruination.

He writes the following: "//The binders of blood made empty pacts with empty gods against the hollow Lamenellant, and they were cut down. The singers of songs had their voices pulled from their throats, and the legions of their twilight armies broke first their spears against the Lamenellant's hide, and then their bodies.//"

"//And when they had been ground into dust beneath the Profane Adamant's clattering steps, it took their faces and returned to the skies.//"

Of note - the author here sometimes writes the name "Lancelot" when it seems as if "Lamenellant" would be more appropriate. This may be a mistake or mistranslation.

The last of the profanities that lay upon the doom of the House of Apollyon was one with no depiction in any text, save for a black smear. This was the king of horrors, the //Profane Dark//, the one that festered in the Enemy's grave until it soaked through the earth and burst forth like a fetid tide. The curse on the Sky King's lips as it pulled him into the void called this great terror YASH, the last foe of man. Without La Hire's sword, Lancelot's mace, Hector's spear, or Ogier's faith, the full might of the sullen sorrow was brought to bear on Apollyon's broken heart, which shattered with his ruined kingdom. "//Wrath,//" he spoke. "//Wrath. Wrath. Wrath.//"

I have seen the face of the Lamenellant, though only for a moment, and know of the fiery chasm in which the Vinuvinex seethes. But I dare not seek out YASH, the Profane Dark. The last scroll of the "Writings of Caiman of Sicil" says, "//but the eyes of YASH offer no release into death, only the winding roads of torment that lead to the puller of eyes and sharpener of spines, where no man returns and no voices are heard. The Castle of Fire, the King of Crimson Skies, the Reaper of Dreams flee from the eyes of YASH, the last scream of the nameless folk beyond the sea. Men scream out and are silenced. The light of the sun invites order to the most fundamental nature of this world and the YASH abhors it.//"

**Addendum 4812.2:** Containment of SCP-4812 Entities

[[include component:image-block name=Lamenellant.png|caption=SCP-4812-K being engaged by Global Occult Coalition defense systems.]]

**SCP-4812-K** has been known to the Foundation since 1964, when it was confused for an experimental US air vehicle while crossing over the northern USSR. After being engaged by Soviet fighters over the Chukchi Sea, SCP-4812-K rapidly ascended to stratospheric heights and disappeared from sight entirely. Shortly thereafter, the entity re-engaged the fighters at high speeds, quickly destroying them.

Since then, SCP-4812-K has only been detected on a handful of occasions, usually while passing low enough to be detected visually due to distortions caused by light reflecting against its chitinous exterior. Notably, SCP-4812-K appears to follow a vague path, often passing over the containment sites of both SCP-4812-S and SCP-4812-E, as well as the ██████ ██████ █████████ ███████ ███████ in ██████, ███████████ [SEE ADDENDUM 4812.4]. The significance of this is --not known-- [SEE ADDENDUM 4812.4].

[[include component:image-block name=Vinuvinex.png|caption=SCP-4812-E's travel path shortly after discovery.|width=275px|align=left]]

**SCP-4812-E** was discovered shortly after the acquisition of SCP-4812-1, when a Foundation discovery team investigating a set of coordinates noted in the third tome discovered a thermal anomaly beneath a lake near ██████-███, ███████. Further investigation of this site disturbed the earth and opened a small fissure beneath the lake, which drained lakewater into the opening. Shortly afterwards, the site experienced a significant drop in temperature as SCP-4812-E, which had previously been trapped in a thermal vent beneath the lake, ascended to the surface. 

The discovery team immediately evacuated the site, and MTF Ark-11 "Light Em Up" was scrambled to the site to engage the SCP-4812-E entity. However, due to the rapidly falling temperatures and increasingly dangerous atmospheric conditions being generated at the site, MTF Ark-11 was forced to maintain distance and use long-range artillery weapons to impede the progress of SCP-4812-E as it marched towards the nearest population center.

After several hours of shelling over 8km of land, SCP-4812-E was finally contained when a controlled gas explosion was generated near the entity, followed by an immediate drop of molten slag over it by a remote carrier drone. The slag-covered SCP-4812-E was moved into a mobile electromagnetic kiln and transported to the thermal control DEEPWELL vault at Site-80.

**SCP-4812-S** was included in the notes of Foundation Administrator Frederick Williams as a location of interest, and has been at least vaguely understood since the formation of Foundation-precursor occult investigation groups. Prior to Foundation involvement, it was not known that SCP-4812-S was an entity at all - instead, many groups believed that the cave itself was hazardous to travelers, as none who entered were ever heard from again.

**Addendum 4812.3:** SCP-4812-K Hostile Activity

On June 9th, 2002, three months after the discovery and containment of SCP-4812-E, SCP-4812-K was observed diverting from its anticipated path towards an area in the North Sea. A Foundation carrier division was diverted to the area, where SCP-4812-K had engaged with a Global Occult Coalition transport ship. The entity, which was unfazed by the conventional weaponry on-board the GOC vessel, appeared to be attempting to breach the exterior of the ship. Of note - SCP-4812-K had not ever previously been observed making this sort of unprovoked hostile action, especially at such a low altitude.

The Foundation carrier group immediately engaged the entity, and after a short skirmish drove it away from the transport ship. The Foundation carrier group offered assistance to the GOC vessel, but this assistance was denied and the vessel continued on its course north. Satellite imagery showed the vessel docking in a previously undisclosed port in northern Norway. 

This incident corresponded with two other events involving SCP-4812-E and SCP-4812-S. Throughout the skirmish with SCP-4812-K, SCP-4812-E became increasingly active within its containment vessel, at one point necessitating the activation of previously untested technology to further increase the temperature within the DEEPWELL vault to stabilize the entity. At the same time, several tremors were felt near the SCP-4812-S site, and seismographs of the area revealed that a large portion of the cave system had collapsed. 

Later observation of the site indicates that SCP-4812-S has since moved upwards no less than 70m.

NOTICE:

By the authority of the United Nations Security Council and the Global Occult Coalition, you are hereby forbidden from further involvement into any supernatural activity involving three specific paranormal entities:

GC-92201 (CODENAME: MARS): a massive, winged, scorpioid entity with a metallic exterior. 

GC-92202 (CODENAME: PLUTO): a large, human-like entity that dramatically alters the total energy of the system directly surrounding it.

GC-92203 (CODENAME: EROS): a small, partially mummified, vaguely human-like entity currently in possession of GLOBAL OCCULT COALITION TASKFORCE OMNI-045.[[footnote]]The SCP-4812 research team does not believe that this is one of the three entities described in SCP-4812-1.[[/footnote]]

Based on information recovered by our agents, it is likely that you have the PLUTO entity in containment at one of your facilities. You are instructed to immediately make all efforts to destroy this entity beyond its ability to self-repair or regenerate. As directed by the SKY-KING DIRECTIVE, you are to also turn over any information you may have regarding this entity, and either of the other two entities described above.

I figure you're at least somewhat aware of the circumstances involved here. It's likely you were the ones who ran off with Connington's estate, so you have pieces that we don't have. Chances are that goes the other way too, since nobody has come asking for what we found in the Archduke's vault.

I think it's also probably likely that you were the ones who dug up PLUTO, and now you've got him stashed somewhere hot. That's good, but there are more steps we need to take now. I applaud you for staying ahead of the curve so far. From what we've read, PLUTO is a son-of-a-bitch. I wouldn't want to be the one to figure out how to fit him in a box.

Here's the long and short of it. The big flying guy, the one we call MARS - we all know the Russians were the first to find it when it knocked those birds out of the sky back in the sixties. What you might not know is that they managed to get a tracker around it, a communicator, and we've been able to watch where it's going for the last few years. //It's looking for something.// The way we figure, there are three of these things, right? They called them "profanities". You have one, now we have one, and MARS is the third. 

But the writings we recovered say it's looking for something else. It's looking for whoever cursed these things into existence. Now, it found PLUTO when you dug it out of the ground, so that's one. Our EROS[[footnote]]This entity, if it exists at all, is not SCP-4812-S, -E, or -K.[[/footnote]] it found when we accidentally unearthed it a few years ago as well, so there's two. It's the third, and now it's just looking for the boss. We've been keeping an eye on it for the last few months, and it seems to be favoring some place in France. If you don't have people searching under every rock out there to find this thing, you need to. We do. Our records say it's some sort of woman, somewhere underground. We thought it might've been EROS at first, but the thing we dug up is too small to be a human woman. The physiology is all wrong, too.

Anyway, we need to make sure that MARS doesn't find this control entity. We think we can hurt it if we kill EROS, and you might be able to do the same if you kill PLUTO. They're all connected, we figure - at least, that's what the literature implies. EROS really has been a bitch to try and kill though, so if you have any ideas there we're willing to listen. You should do the same with yours.

It's strange, though, isn't it? MARS coming down like that to get at EROS. I wonder why it never did that with PLUTO? And why does it keep circling those fields in France?

We've confirmed what we feared. They don't know it, but they've found her. 

We have teams currently en route to the SCP-4812-S site. We're going to dump fifty meters of lead and concrete on top of it - it's going to be your job to find a way to shoot that thing out of the sky.

Get to work.
