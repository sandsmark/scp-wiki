**Description:** {{PENDING}}

**Provenance:** Foundation agents were dispatched to Bingara, Australia on 27 June 2017 following reports of widespread panic and mass evacuation of the area. Questioning by attending agents was ineffective, as residents would not provide information explaining their panic or reason for evacuation; however, the agents were directed by civilians to several areas in and around the town.

After requesting for assistance, the attending agents cooperated with Mobile Task Force Epsilon-6 ("Village Idiots"); while inappropriate for the situation, the cooperation successfully minimised incurred injuries. MTF E-6 requested use of Containment Chamber #3942 (Approved), devising and initiating containment procedures upon arrival.

The surviving residents and ex-residents of Bingara were amnestised.

> Eleven minutes after entering Containment Chamber #3942, Subject utilises [[[SCP-028 | knowledge obtained from previous assignment]]] to generate a rudimentary kinetoglyph[[footnote]]From the [[[SCP-1730 | Site-13 research file]]] on 86243AR-001 “Malidramagiuan”, “//Kinetoglyphs, or kinetohazards, are mental and physical hazards that occur when an entity performs specific gestures and motions […]//.” For further information, see Footnote 3 of SCP-1730 documentation, and/or Addendum 1730.9.[[/footnote]] with their hands, blocking security personnel from entering Containment Chamber #3942. Security personnel report a containment breach in progress.
> 
> Subject demonstrates how to construct the components of an elaborate kinetoglyph with their hands. Security personnel begin to physically destroy the initial barrier; Subject focuses their attention on preserving it while the elaborate kinetoglyph is constructed. Upon completion, the second kinetoglyph generates a temporary space-time manifold to an unknown location. Subject utilises the manifold to breach containment.
> 
> Security personnel equipped with a portable Scranton Reality Anchor arrive, and immediately activate it. All kinetoglyphs within the area of influence immediately dissipate, along with their produced anomalous effects.
