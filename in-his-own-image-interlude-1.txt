//Lament's fingers slid over the chromium frame for a moment. It had been expensive, but the joke—which he knew wouldn't be laughed at—was worth it. His first failure for a final hurrah. He let a slight smirk slip over his lips, looking down at the picture, at the smile that looked almost abnormal, and laughed.//

//Lament wanted to think 'The look on his face...' or something similarly reflective, but he knew that it would be the same as it always was. Blank. Calculating.//

//He pulled out the wrapping paper, and slowly began folding it around the picture with a half smile, humming happy birthday.//
