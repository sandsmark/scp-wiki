Sympathy for SCP-3340 instances, along with personality changes is a distinguishing characteristic of SCP-3340 infection. Some instances are also capable of inducing sensation in the host such as causing various levels of hallucination, with one documented case of an SCP-3340 instance causing the host to feel pain. SCP-3340 instances have also been documented elevating dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin levels in those infected when aiding in SCP-3340 replication. <br><br>Communication with SCP-3340 instances can be established when its initial documentation is modified; post Incident-01, communication with SCP-3340 instances is to be established using iron filings over the documentation for ease of removal without damaging the media.

SCP-3340 behaviour has been correlated to the tone of the media that spawned them. <br><br>Classical conditioning techniques have been implemented to prevent negative behaviours should they arise; failing the classical conditioning, destruction of the instance’s parent information will prevent further memetic spreading of the instance. <br><br><b>Addendum A:</b> Incident-01<br><br>Following an unrelated study on the physical degradation of an SCP-3340 spawning document, it was discovered that dust collected around certain words and symbols more than others.
