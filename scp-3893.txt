**Item #**: SCP-3893

**Object Class**: Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures**: Containment Facility 3893-SVAROG will maintain continual manning, operation, and maintenance in accordance with both Foundation and Australian nuclear regulations. 

SCP-3893-01 is to be continually monitored for any movement or change in physiological state. In the event that SCP-3893-01 undergoes a flux surge event, all on-site turbogenerators will be brought online to divert excess power to established grounding shafts, and SCP-3893-01's shielding barriers will be scrammed. 

**Description**: SCP-3893 is the remains of a large machine, located 30 meters underground beneath an area of land approximately 120 kilometers east-northeast of Uluru. 

Excavated and partially reconstructed sections of the wreckage that comprises the majority of SCP-3893 have yielded structures resembling weapon barrels, armor plating, computer circuitry, and several continuous track assemblies, indicating that SCP-3893 may have been a form of land-based combat vehicle prior to its destruction. None of SCP-3893's components have shown to be made of inherently anomalous materials, save for its central power source, designated SCP-3893-01.

SCP-3893-01 is a male human corpse in an advanced state of desiccation and decomposition, which is connected via a series of implanted wires and electromechanical contacts to several operational SCP-3893 subsystems. SCP-3893-01 is highly radioactive, and was originally found placed within the primary vessel of SCP-3893's pressurized water reactor, serving as the reactor's fuel source. The amount of heat, radiation, and steam produced by several of SCP-3893's damaged coolant lines led to its initial discovery.

SCP-3893 was initially discovered routing its generated electricity into a ground load at a rate of over 500 megawatts per hour. As allowing this to continue would result in an eventual reactor meltdown, Containment Facility 3893-SVAROG was constructed above and around SCP-3893. This facility functions as a supplementary power generation plant, which converts the otherwise inordinate amount of energy produced by SCP-3893 into usable power for the surrounding region and provides adequate cooling to SCP-3893-01.

Near SCP-3893-01's core observation porthole is a CRT monitor, affixed to a wall. The information displayed on this screen has not been observed to change since SCP-3893's containment. Text follows.

SCP-3893-01 displays no signs of biological vitality, but has been seen to twitch or adjust position slightly in its tank. These movements coincide with massive releases of thermal energy and ionizing radiation, which 3893-SVAROG has thus far been able to successfully divert. However, these surges have increased in intensity over time since initial containment, and current projections estimate that without material upgrades or reinforcement, SCP-3893-01 will cause critical structural failure and containment breach within approximately ██ months.
