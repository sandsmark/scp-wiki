He lay in the bath tub, toes gently splashing along the water line in an absent minded way. The hot water comforted him as he reflected on the evening prior.

"Do tell?" An innocuous little thing of a question, to be sure. An afternoon at the club, as most days, had been a quiet affair. The exclusivity of Marshall, Carter and Dark Ltd. did not lend itself to idle talk. A leather chair to sit in and a small beverage to accompany him as he passed the time with a book from the club's library. Solitude in the company of peers, the unspoken social rule of the club; You do not chit chat.

"How are you today?" An odd question to have been asked by an old regular of the club. He had seen the gentlemen about, at various functions. They each worked within separate industries, so little reason to interact had ever arisen. The question had been out of place. Useless. Marshall, Carter and Dark Ltd. was many things, but a sanctuary for uselessness it was not. The gentlemen accepted a short, curt, answer and that had been that. He returned to his book, glancing up from the page occasionally.

"Anything new?" Another question from another member. Another thing out of place. A grunted response turned the fellow away.

His tub, as with his membership, had been inherited. Sitting in it, he used his toe to turn on the hot water. He thought back to all the times through the years that he had turned the hot water on with his toe. The steady stream of the tap keeping the tub a comfortable temperature had become a lifelong routine for him. Forty years prior he had lain in this same exact spot watching the water crest to the over flow drain, listening to the gargle of the water being drunk back down. It was a simple memory of a common practice of his. One he had taken for granted, much like the membership.

"How are you feeling today?" Gooseflesh crept along his spine, settling into the back of his neck.  An odd inquiry might have been an anomaly. The numerous questions he received throughout the evening were a pattern. A message. Talk occurred at the club, most certainly. Business was frequently discussed. Privacy was seldom intruded for the sake of friendly banter, however. There were other places than the club for things of that sort.

Places he frequented. On occasion.

"Do tell?" An insignificant little thing of a question, he had thought at the time. An opportunity to brag, perhaps. But places outside of the club are rarely outside of the reach of the club. The two concepts were mutually exclusive from each other.

He thought of the note he had written as way of apology, sitting on his desk in the study. He suspected it would not still be there come morning.

"Your bill, sir?" The hostess, too, came to him with a question not often heard. Membership, of course, carried obligations, monetary and otherwise. There were fundraisers, investments, tips for the staff. Members gave freely of themselves, in return the club gave freely of itself. Charges for drinks, like a common pub? Hardly. Only guests paid their way, not full members. She had placed the small leather bound pad on the arm of his chair. It had taken him a moment to register the action, so off guard was he. Opening it revealed a single slip of paper, with a hand written bill for his drink. Everyone had been looking at him.

"I'm sorry?" He had asked. The waitress had smiled in reply. That is to say, her lips turned up, but there was no warmth in the action. The imitation of a smile, too, was a message.

On the rim of the tub lay a small folded white towel, atop which lay his grandfather's straight razor. It had a beautiful pearl handle, one he had admired many times while watching his father shave and many more times while he had shaved with it. He reached out to it, a trembling finger brushing against the handle. The touch of it made him start and he pulled away, returning his hand to his submerged lap. 

"No reason to be sorry, sir." She had said to him, leaning in close. "You'll do the right thing, I'm sure." And then she had left him, to attend to her other duties. Around him, business deals resumed, gentlemen began reading their books and papers again. A woman ordered another beverage. He hadn't realized how quiet it had gotten until the muted routine of the club resumed. The hostess' statement was as much an answer as he was likely to get. You do not chit chat. Membership carried obligations. Broken obligations carried penalties. Marshall, Carter and Dark's penalties were rather ... severe.

He would do the right thing. If he was lucky, he would only have to do it the once. If he was very, very lucky, the earth would not be salted out of spite. He made himself look over to the towel again, and the razor upon it. He reached over and picked it up, unfolding the blade.

"Do tell?" An inconsequential little thing of a question, no longer. For him, it was the most important question of his life. Perhaps it was pride in having what others did not. But he had - //told//, that is.

He felt cold, no longer comforted by the hot embrace of his bath. He turned the hot water off, stopping the flow from the tap. He thought of all the times since his childhood that he had lain in this very tub, turning the water on and off with his toe. He thought of all the times that he would not get to do it.

For a solitary, blissful moment, not a thought passed through his mind. His eyes unfocused as he stared intently at nothing. The moment passed silently.

Taking in a breath, he lay back into the tub submerging himself. In his hand, below the surface, was still the razor. Holding it gave him a strange sort of comfort all at once. Things could always be worse.

He did the right thing.
