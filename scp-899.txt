    **Item #:** SCP-899

    **Object Class:** Safe

    **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-899 is contained in a rough patch of forest in Rocky Mountain National Park.  The SCP-899 phenomena has not been able to travel more than than five meters beyond a standing, living tree, thus the area has been isolated by creating a continuous fire-break around the affected region.  Four park service cabins are staffed by Foundation agents on the borders of the site for the purposes of preventing hikers and travelers from attempting to enter SCP-899.  Because of the remote location of the site from any trails or campgrounds it is not expected that members of the public will enter SCP-899, however agents are authorized to administer Class B and C amnesiacs to any trespassers.  Children who enter SCP-899 cannot be recovered, and containment must be maintained by removing those who have knowledge of the child's last whereabouts or by planting false evidence of death by natural causes elsewhere in the region.

Agents who come into physical contact with SCP-899 must undergo regular psychiatric evaluation.

    **Description:** SCP-899 is a psychic and telekinetic phenomenon that most commonly manifests as groups of young, hostile children.  Travelers in the area have reported being pursued and harassed by small shadowy figures that curse and throw rocks in an attempt to drive them out of the immediate area.  The figures tend to be featureless and it is usually difficult to determine if they possess any gender or even individual voices and behaviors.  Failure to leave the area will result in an increase of aggressive behavior culminating in a direct physical attack by the entities.  An adult who comes into physical contact with one of the entities will suffer the loss of all detailed memories prior to the onset of puberty.  General knowledge of family members and broad living conditions will remain, but persons who have been affected by this memory loss often display a significant change in personality.  The most common symptoms are a loss of impulsiveness and curiosity, and negative responses to attempts at humor.  Affected persons also tend to become highly impatient with children regardless of their prior behavior.

Pre-adolescent children who come into contact with the entities will physically disappear, after which some or all of the entities may take on parts of the lost child's appearance.  No attempt to communicate or find the whereabouts of a child lost in this way has yet been successful.  Adolescents who have not fully matured past puberty are [DATA EXPUNGED]

Although more detailed manifestations have been encountered within the area, no attempts to communicate with the entities within SCP-899 have resulted in anything but attacks on Foundation personnel.  Items made of iron or [[[SCP-148]]] are useful in warding off direct contact with the entities but as it is not necessary to confront the phenomenon in order to contain it no tools containing SCP-148 have been allocated to SCP-899.

Travel through the area is also hindered by a spacial anomaly that makes land navigation difficult.  Compasses and GPS navigation systems will give false directions and trails through the underbrush will change course.  Although there are occasional sounds of wildlife within the affected area, no wild animals or tracks have been observed within the range of SCP-899's effect.  Animals brought into the site are also subject to attacks by the entities, although they will not attempt to make physical contact.
