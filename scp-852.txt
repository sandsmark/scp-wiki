**Item #:** SCP-852

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-852 is presently housed in an underground hanger at site-██.  Artifact is not permitted to leave containment without O5 approval.  Testing of components requires level four oversight and one unit of Task Force Sigma-6 to be on hand.

**Description:**  SCP-852 is a steel and brass vehicle, strongly reminiscent of a bathyscaphe, with the name //Wings of Daedalus// in gold plated brass affixed to the lower hull.  The vehicle has a length of 21.3 meters, a beam of 4.1 meters, and a draft of 7.3 meters in total.  The upper section of the artifact has twelve 'masts' affixed to it with a length of 9.6 meters, set in a hexagonal pattern on the upper and lower portions of the section.  Each mast has a device on the end (SCP-852-3 through 14) that projects a "bubble" which warps space around it in a way that does not match current theories for space/time. 

The lower section of the vehicle appears to be designed for life support, with a fused quartz window for viewing, a control board with a robust chair, and storage areas behind with a variety of tools and provisions.  Power and oxygen are provided by reserves in the upper section, with quicklime used to absorb carbon dioxide in the ventilation system.

SCP-852-2 is a mummified human Caucasian male wearing a pressure suit of primitive manufacture, resembling a diving helmet and suit but with a supplementary air tank and ventilation to remove excess carbon dioxide.  The suit has hoses in its backpack to provide air and power, which match hoses connected to SCP-852 by its airlock.  The connecting hoses had been severed 12.46 meters from the backpack of the suit, with the cut area having a mirror like appearance.  The suit itself has two holes, with a similar finish to the hose cut.  A third hole is located in the air tank.

**Addendum:**  SCP-852 was originally located on Mare Imbrium approximately seven kilometers from the lunar outpost. Telescopic viewing of the area by satellite showed an anomalous formation, and Task Force Sigma-6 went to investigate.  The task force located SCP-852, its batteries drained and its airlock open to space, but otherwise undamaged.  Tracks from the airlock led to the location of SCP-852-2, approximately seventy meters from the airlock. 

Analysis of the scene showed that SCP-852-2 met with unknown hostiles, which first severed the hoses of the suit, then shot SCP-852-2 in the back while he fled, piercing the suit and killing him either by trauma or asphyxiation.  While the tracks made by SCP-852-2 are readily apparent, there are no tracks or any other evidence of the assailants.
