-----
**Personal History:** [DATA EXPUNGED] Minnesota, after which he moved to ████████ on a work visa from Prometheus Labs. Due to Dr. Vang's poor long-term memory, his exact responsibilities and projects at the facility are unknown. However, he is responsible for informing the Foundation of [[[SCP-868]]] and of the origin of [[[SCP-148]]].

In his 20██ paper titled "Mathematical Analysis of the Human Senses and Implications Regarding Societal Concerns" (published in the ██████ Journal of Neurology), Dr. Vang demonstrated an understanding of the mathematical tools and measurements used by Foundation scientists in understanding memes, along with the Fundamental Theorem of Memetics. 

While a paper of such scope would normally be considered groundbreaking, the Foundation moved quickly to excise the information and employ Dr. Vang as a researcher. After displaying high levels of competence and ingenuity, Dr. Vang was given a minor promotion.

**Employment History:**
The following is a list of SCP items that Dr. Vang has researched:
* [[[SCP-066]]] (Ascertained true nature of item)
* [[[SCP-148]]] (Ascertained true nature of item)
* [[[SCP-868]]]
* [[[SCP-984]]] 
* [[[SCP-1248]]]
* [[[SCP-1268]]]
* [[[SCP-1448]]]
* [[[SCP-1646]]]
* --SCP-1684--
* [[[Bees |SCP-████]]]
* [[[[Scantron's Proposal |DATA EXPUNGED]]]]

**Notable Flaws:**
* Refuses to research SCPs whose designation contains neither "6" nor "8". Is visibly uncomfortable while working with odd numbers.
* Agoraphobia, coulrophobia, nyctophobia, apiphobia, and arachnophobia.
* Will make highly inappropriate and/or inflammatory comments on occasion without notice. Dr. Vang claims not to know ahead of time that these comments are inappropriate.
* Completely unproductive in environments greater than 25° Celsius. Refuses to wear protective clothing in low temperatures.
* Prone to migraines and gastrointestinal problems.
* Refuses to learn in-depth information about computers and modern technology.
* Difficulty controlling temper in the presence of children.
//"Berserker Rage" is not an excuse for chasing five-year-olds with an axe. Dr. Vang is currently awaiting disciplinary measures.//- Director ███████
