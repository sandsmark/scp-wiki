**Personal History:** [DATA EXPUNGED] Minnesota, after which he moved to Vancouver on a work visa from ████████ Enterprises.

In his 20██ paper titled "Mathematical Analysis of the Human Brain and Implications Regarding Societal Concerns" (published in the Canadian Journal of Sociology), Dr. Vang demonstrated an understanding of the mathematical tools and measurements used by Foundation scientists in understanding memes, along with the Fundamental Theorem of Memetics.
