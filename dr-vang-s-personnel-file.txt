**Personal History:** [DATA EXPUNGED] Minnesota, after which he moved to ████████ on a work visa from Prometheus Labs. Due to Dr. Vang's poor long-term [[[SCP-868 |memory]]], his exact responsibilities and projects at the facility are unknown. He resigned from Prometheus Labs following --contract disputes.-- a third-place finish in the ████████ Telekill Poll behind Drs. Bachmann and Paul.

In his 20██ paper titled "Mathematical Analysis of the Human Senses and Memory" (published in the ██████ Journal of Neurology), Dr. Vang demonstrated an understanding of the mathematical tools and measurements used by Foundation scientists in understanding memes, along with the Fundamental Theorem of Memetics. 

While a paper of such scope would normally be considered groundbreaking, the Foundation moved quickly to excise the information and employ Dr. Vang as a researcher. After displaying high levels of competence and ingenuity, Dr. Vang was given a promotion. After subsequently displaying no [[[SCP-1606 |competence]]] whatsoever and --going batshit crazy-- exhibiting ingenuity unsuitable for the task at hand, he was then given another promotion to a position of no power or responsibility.

Recent intelligence reports indicate that Dr. Vang has a girlfriend. Further analyses indicate that said girlfriend is probably memetic or something. Reports of Dr. Vang being "dope on the floor and magic on the [[[SCP-1248 |mic]]]" are unconfirmed.

**Disciplinary/Complaint Log Vang-3:**

//You see this shit? This is the shit that I have to [[[SCP-1246 |clean up]]] after every fucking day.//- Director Vang

//Who told Dr. Vang that most of his projects had odd numbers in them? He's locked himself in the storage closet with some spreadsheets and hasn't said anything in two days except to ask for alcohol and ink. He refuses to use pens, what the hell is he using the ink for?//- Agent Banerjee
* //Fuck if I know. This isn't even strictly my problem. I should warn you, though, he's handsy when he's drunk.//- Director Vang

//'Berserker [[[SCP-1646| Rage]]]' is not an excuse for chasing [[[SCP-066 |five-year-olds]]] with an axe. I formally recommend that Dr. Vang face disciplinary measures.//- Dr. Valdemarsson

* //Approved; also, 'Ninja [[[SCP-984 |Rabies]]]' is not a valid excuse. Stop trying, ██████, nobody likes you.//- Director Vang

//Excuse me, would it be possible to keep Dr. Vang from forwarding all of his spam emails? I don't even know why anyone would do that.//- Dr. Kaczmarek

* //Granted. Dr. Vang may only contact other staff --verbally-- by [[[In other news, |classified ad]]].//- Director Vang

//Could someone get Dr. Vang off my back? He keeps telling people that I want to fuck their organs.//- Agent Sinada

* //I thought you weren't allowed to ask questions on this document?//- Director Vang

//Remind me again why we didn't mess with that prick's file for April Fool's Day? Maybe load it up with imperial [[[SCP-5280-J |measurements]]] or something.//- Dr. Jacobs

* //I lived with him for sixteen years; trust me when I say it wouldn't go over well. Also, you do realize that he's basically a walking AFD joke already, right?//- Director Vang

//Dr. Vang keeps messing with my Nuzlocke run! Can he be, like, not allowed to touch my stuff any more?//- Dr. Tan

* //Denied, report to Keter duty.//- Director Vang

**Addendum:** After incident TPAW-2, Dr. Vang is to be contained at Site 33's Infohazard Wing pending --classification as an SCP object.-- inauguration.
