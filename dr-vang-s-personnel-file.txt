**Personal History:** [DATA EXPUNGED] Minnesota, after which he moved to ████████ on a work visa from Prometheus Labs. Due to Dr. Vang's poor long-term memory, his exact responsibilities and projects at the facility are unknown. However, he is responsible for informing the Foundation of [[[SCP-868]]] and of the origin of [[[SCP-148]]].

In his 20██ paper titled "Mathematical Analysis of the Human Senses and Implications Regarding Societal Concerns" (published in the ██████ Journal of Neurology), Dr. Vang demonstrated an understanding of the mathematical tools and measurements used by Foundation scientists in understanding memes, along with the Fundamental Theorem of Memetics. 

While a paper of such scope would normally be considered groundbreaking, the Foundation moved quickly to excise the information and employ Dr. Vang as a researcher. After displaying high levels of competence and ingenuity, Dr. Vang was given a promotion.

* [[[SCP-066]]] (Ascertained true nature of item)
* [[[SCP-148]]] (Ascertained true nature of item)
* [[[SCP-868]]]
* [[[SCP-984]]] 
* [[[SCP-1248]]]
* [[[SCP-1268]]]
* [[[SCP-1448]]]

**Notable Flaws:**

Is visibly uncomfortable while working with odd numbers.[[footnote]]//Who told Dr. Vang that most of his projects had the number one in them? He's locked himself in the storage closet with some spreadsheets and hasn't said anything in three days except to ask for alcohol and ink.//- Dr. Vang's Assistant[[/footnote]]
* Agoraphobia, coulrophobia, nyctophobia, apiphobia, and arachnophobia.

* Prone to migraines and gastrointestinal problems.
* Refuses to learn in-depth information about computers and modern technology.
* [[[SCP-____-J |Procrastination.]]]

//"Berserker Rage" is not an excuse for chasing five-year-olds with an axe. Dr. Vang is currently awaiting disciplinary measures.//- Director ███████
