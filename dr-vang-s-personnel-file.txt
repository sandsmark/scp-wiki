**Name:** Dr. ██████ Vang, PhD

**Clearance:** Level --2-- 3

**Position:** --Memeticist-- Project Manager

**Education:** PhD in Neuroscience, Master's Degree in Information Science, Master's Degree in Mathematics

**Duties:** --Researching memetic and mind-affecting SCP items; essential R&D-- Project management.

//I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing.//- Dr. Vang.
-----
**Personal History:** [DATA EXPUNGED] Minnesota, after which he moved to ████████ on a work visa from Prometheus Labs. Due to Dr. Vang's poor long-term [[[SCP-868 |memory]]], his exact responsibilities and projects at the facility are unknown.

In his 20██ paper titled "Mathematical Analysis of the Human Senses and Memory" (published in the ██████ Journal of Neurology), Dr. Vang demonstrated an understanding of the mathematical tools and measurements used by Foundation scientists in understanding memes, along with the Fundamental Theorem of Memetics. 

While a paper of such scope would normally be considered groundbreaking, the Foundation moved quickly to excise the information and employ Dr. Vang as a researcher. After displaying high levels of competence and ingenuity, Dr. Vang was given a promotion.

Reports of Dr. Vang being "dope on the floor and magic on the [[[SCP-1248 |mic]]]" are unconfirmed.

//HOW DID THIS GET HERE I AM NOT GOOD WITH COMPUTER//- Dr. Vang

**Notable Flaws:**
* [[[SCP-1268 |Agoraphobia]]], coulrophobia, nyctophobia, [[[Bees |apiphobia]]], and arachnophobia.
* Will make highly inappropriate and/or inflammatory comments on occasion without notice. Dr. Vang claims not to [[[SCP-148 |know]]] ahead of time that these comments are inappropriate.
* Refuses to learn in-depth information about computers and modern technology.
* Refuses to wear additional [[[SCP-1626 |clothing]]] in colder conditions.
* [[[SCP-____-J |Procrastination.]]]
* Refuses to research SCPs whose designation contains neither "6" nor "8". Is visibly uncomfortable while working with [[[SCP-336 |odd]]] [[[Lumancer |numbers]]].
* Difficulty controlling temper in the presence of [[[SCP-066 |chil]]][[[SCP-1448 |dren]]].

**Disciplinary/Complaint Log Vang-3:**

//You see this shit? This is the shit that I have to clean up after every fucking day.//- Director Vang

//Who told Dr. Vang that most of his projects had odd numbers in them? He's locked himself in the storage closet with some spreadsheets and hasn't said anything in two days except to ask for alcohol and ink. He refuses to use pens, what the hell is he using the ink for?//- Agent Banerjee
* //Fuck if I know. This isn't even strictly my problem. I should warn you, though, he's handsy when he's drunk.//- Director Vang

//'Berserker [[[SCP-1646| Rage]]]' is not an excuse for chasing five-year-olds with an axe. I formally recommend that Dr. Vang face disciplinary measures.//- Dr. Valdemarsson

* //Approved; also, 'Ninja [[[SCP-984 |Rabies]]]' is not a valid excuse. Stop trying, ██████, nobody likes you.//- Director Vang

//Excuse me, would it be possible to keep Dr. Vang from forwarding all of his spam emails? I don't even know why anyone would do that.//- Dr. Kaczmarek

* //Granted. Dr. Vang may only contact other staff --verbally-- by carrier pigeon.//- Director Vang

//Could someone get Dr. Vang off my back? He keeps telling people that I want to fuck their organs.//- Agent Sinada

* //In all fairness, you kinda give off that vibe.//- Director Vang

//Remind me again why we didn't mess with that prick's file for April Fool's Day? Maybe load it up with imperial [[[SCP-5280-J |measurements]]] or something.//- Dr. Jacobs

* //I lived with him for sixteen years; trust me when I say it wouldn't go over well. Also, you do realize that he's basically a walking AFD joke already, right?//- Director Vang
