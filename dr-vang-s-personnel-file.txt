//I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing.//- Dr. Vang.
//Update: What the fuck am I supposed to be doing?//- Dr. Vang.
//Update: **T-PAW**//- Dr. Vang
-----
**Personal History:** [DATA EXPUNGED] Minnesota, after which he moved to ████████ on a work visa from Prometheus Labs. Due to Dr. Vang's poor long-term memory, his exact responsibilities and projects at the facility are unknown. He resigned from Prometheus Labs following --contract disputes.-- a third-place finish in the ████████ Telekill Poll behind Drs. Bachmann and Paul.

In his 19██ paper titled "Mathematical Analysis of the Human Senses and Memory" (published in the ██████ Journal of Neurology), Dr. Vang demonstrated an understanding of the mathematical tools and measurements used by Foundation scientists in understanding memes, along with the Fundamental Theorem of Memetics. 

While a paper of such scope would normally be considered groundbreaking, the Foundation moved quickly to excise the information and employ Dr. Vang as a researcher. After displaying high levels of competence and ingenuity, Dr. Vang was given a promotion. After subsequently displaying no competence whatsoever and --going batshit crazy-- exhibiting ingenuity unsuitable for the task at hand, he was then given another promotion to a position of no power or responsibility.

Recent intelligence reports indicate that Dr. Vang had a girlfriend. Further analyses indicate that said girlfriend was probably memetic or something. Reports of Dr. Vang being "dope on the floor and magic on the mic" are --unconfirmed-- exaggerated.

**Addendum:** After incident TPAW-2, Dr. Vang is to be contained at Site 33's Infohazard Wing pending --classification as an SCP object.-- inauguration.

//You see this shit? This is the shit that I have to clean up after every fucking day.//- Director Vang

//Who told Dr. Vang that most of his projects had odd numbers in them? He's locked himself in the storage closet with some spreadsheets and hasn't said anything in two days except to ask for alcohol and ink. He refuses to use pens, what the hell is he using the ink for?//- Agent Banerjee
* //Fuck if I know. This isn't even strictly my problem. I should warn you, though, he's handsy when he's drunk.//- Director Vang

[[tab Poetry]]
{{The following works are out-of-character.}}

**__One of a Kind__**
You say your love's unique - I disagree
Conceit this common just reveals to all
That blinded by romantic fantasy
It's not so easy for this thought to fall
This fantasy is easy to critique
When one sees how humanity has grown
Six billion hearts that feel themselves unique
Six billion souls that fear to be alone
You cannot say that love lacks value, though
To say as much would mock the earth and air
Generic love is special on its own
Just as important as what's always there
It's this emotion, love that never dims
Of which the poets rightf'lly sing their hymns

**__The Unorganized Ramblings of a Hypocrite__**
Fighting against me, this culture of fear
My values made clear in carnival mirrors
Are missing in action, a negative reaction
Defined as a contrast to my subconscious redaction
I see and I hate, and I'm avoiding debate
It's inexcusable for enlightenment to occur at this rate
I know when I sleep, my dreams are the same as before
And entropy means it's so easy to ignore
A coincidental hive mind deciding who's smartest
Literally thousands of interchangeable artists
And even when I know it, I'm one of 'em, fuck 'em
'Cause cultural inertia means I can't just unstuck 'em
I pledge allegiance to the economy and all it entails
By virtue of my patronage 'til all of it fails
Avalanches above from the business below
Yet ten billion likes won't unmelt any snow
It's my high-minded provincialism that finds it acceptable
To use the environment as mother and trash receptacle
Because I can't unburn a forest up from the ground
And my greatest efforts don't add up to an original sound
'Cause the undisputed masters of the English language
Are centuries past, and it causes me anguish
That my race for the future means forgetting the past
At least I can see why decay is so fast
I don't know what's important, and I speak as humanity
Or at least the portion responsible for all this insanity
And one nation unto debt is unrefundable
But I balance only the spreadsheets and that's irresponsible
My mast'ry of the tangible leaves my worth too infringible
And the status of my generation's rights is uncivil
I'm stuck and the mud and the mud is a poison
And what I say is uncomfortable 'cause I say I'm avoidin'
Hypocrisy, and in the end it's the same pile of crud
That lets me take a bath in this pile of mud
So if you move or you don't, it don't even matter
'Cause when it comes down to it, I'll end up the latter

**__Miscellaneous Haikus**__
A knock at the door
The syllable thief is here
Takes three, 

Neurosurgery
From your birth until you die
Socialization

Music, as you've seen
Only broadens the gap 'tween
You and the real world

Could inherit it
I'm reminded now and then
I'm probably fine

I need some money
To feel like I have money
that's what money's for

Grinding some lenses
I know we'll need quite a few
We're not objective

Screen glare hurts my eyes
But all illumination
Scorches just as much

It's a dictionary
Combine its contents just right
For every answer

A cure for baldness?
A disease that makes you wise
At least to others

drops them here

**__Mobility**__
The UPS man's at the door
To meet him, I go up one floor
He tells me what he needs me for:
My signature, and nothing more.

I smile, 'cause it's been six weeks past
Since I was an adult at last
The weather's bad — I take it fast
He drives away. The package, vast,

Contains a laptop, new and mine
I set it up and think it fine
That six weeks past that sacred line
That scribble is the only sign

I hop online and ask my friends
Will this be how my childhood ends?
The grown-up world and all it sends
Starts not with breaks — it starts with bends

**__Consumption**__
If eating comes from hunger,
I wonder why I eat —
My stomach is contented,
And yet I swallow meat.

I check the freezer daily
For things that I don't need.
In situations disp'rate
That same advice I heed

The angel and the devil
Upon our shoulders tell
Us different ways of living
That both lead us to hell

We sell our past and future
To get us things today
I'll prob'ly die by sixty
And that is how we'll pay

**__$3/lb.**__
Oh my! These pretzel sticks
of crystal, wheatish flour
and lustrous, brownish gloss
are stud with salty pearls.

Let's go! They foul the breath
and rob the mouth of wet
and fill our bellies up —
a bargain at this price.

**__Seclusion, Perspective, Disconnection**__
I rest my head on yours.
And hair that I can't feel,
A mind that isn't mine
A person I can't know

It yeilds, a pillow, both
We rest against ourselves
And see with separate eyes
Two images benign

I, moth, your mental flame
The moon I ever seek
Hurts not -- except in lack
Is drawn away by thoughts

And known, it sticks inside
At least three worlds apart
My nightmares I am not
I need to know you now.

**__Epitaph, Written In Advance**__
I want a girl -- let's say
I wed [insert wife here]
And if I don't regret it
Please call me held-her-near

We'll probably produce
Some kids [insert tots here]
And if they don't disown me
Please call me dad-of-year

If all goes well I'll have
A job: [insert work here]
And if I'm not too lazy
Please call me spinning-gear

Good odds I'll have some friends
Their names: [insert mates here]
And if I join their games
Please call me buys-the-beer

This grave is not for me --
I died [insert date here]
And if you miss my presence
Please say you shed a tear
