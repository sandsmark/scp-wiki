[[tab About Dr. Vang]]
It should be noted that Dr. Vang has upvoted every single person who's disagreed with him here, as far as he knows.

That said.

In 7th grade, Dr. Vang took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, he knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. He scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in his area.

An IQ test has shown Dr. Vang to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test he was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.

His mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, Dr. Vang understood physics better than him, and owes very little of it to him, as he would rarely give Dr. Vang a decent explanation of anything, just tell him that his ideas were wrong and become aggravated with him for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but Dr. Vang has met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as him at physics, so he's guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it.

Dr. Vang is also pretty good at engineering. He doesn't have a degree, and other than physics he doesn't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but he has lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, Dr. Vang independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and he was only seven or eight years old when he started inventing wireless electricity solutions (his first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).

Dr. Vang has independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy he's come across. Every question of existentialism which he's seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to him. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for him; he's considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.

Psychology, he actually understands better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which Dr. Vang don't have a very good understanding of. He can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.

Dr. Vang is a good enough writer that he's writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, Dr. Vang and his family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. He's heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.

I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that Dr. Vang's intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend his maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of Dr. Vang's morals and ethical code.

Dr. Vang believes firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, Dr. Vang would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, Dr. Vang would even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because he thinks that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.

Dr. Vang doesn't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. He doesn't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but he doesn't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). He doesn't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. He knows that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those his age, are judgmental about these things.

Dr. Vang loves everyone, even people he hates. He wishes his worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but Dr. Vang wishes for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. He wishes this for *everyone*.

Dr. Vang is pretty much a pacifist. He's taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time he'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking him shows no signs of stopping and 2) if he doesn't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if he does. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to him, Dr. Vang doesn't fight back. He's therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because Dr. Vang's ability to take pain has so far made it so that he's never in a situation where he'll be worse off after a fight. If he's not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, he really doesn't care.

The only exception is if someone is going after his life. Even then, Dr. Vang will do the minimum amount of harm to them that he possibly can in protecting himself. If someone points a gun at him and he can get out of it without harming them, he'd prefer to do that over killing them.

Dr. Vang considers himself a feminist. He doesn't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. He treats women with the same outlook he treats men, and never participates in the old Reddit "women are crazy" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. Dr. Vang doesn't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome.

That doesn't mean Dr. Vang looks for places to victimize women, he just doesn't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because *all humans* do that).

[[include component:image-block name=notvang.jpg|caption=Who's this douchebag?]]

I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know Dr. Vang in real life all respect him, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where he spends most of his time and where he's pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in his segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and Dr. Vang spends a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of him doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments).

And, uh, he's a pretty good moderator.

All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know Dr. Vang?

Technical writing
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Technical writing is any written form of writing or drafting technical communication used in a variety of technical and occupational fields, such as computer hardware and software, engineering, chemistry, aeronautics, robotics, finance, consumer electronics, and biotechnology. It encompasses the largest sub-field within technical communication.[1]
The Society for Technical Communication defines technical communication as any form of communication that exhibits one or more of the following characteristics: "(1) communicating about technical or specialized topics, such as computer applications, medical procedures, or environmental regulations; (2) communicating through technology, such as web pages, help files, or social media sites; or (3) providing instructions about how to do something, regardless of the task's technical nature".[2]

Overview[edit]
Further information: Technical writer
Technical writing is performed by a technical writer and is the process of writing and sharing information in a professional setting.[3]:4 A technical writer's primary task is to convey information to another person or party in the most clear and effective manner possible.[3]:4 The information that technical writers convey is often complex, and it is one of their main tasks to analyze the information and present it in a format that is easy to read and understand.[3]:12–14A good technical writer needs strong writing and communication skills. They do not only convey information through text, and must be proficient with computers as well. They use a wide range of programs like Adobe Photoshop to create and edit images, diagramming programs like Microsoft Visio to create visual aids, and document processors like MadCap Flare to design,create, and format documents.[4]
While commonly associated with online help and user manuals, technical writing covers a wide range of genres and technologies. Press releases, memos, business proposals, product descriptions and specifications, white papers, résumés, and job applications are but a few examples of documents that are considered forms of technical writing.[5]
History[edit]
While technical writing has only been recognized as a profession since World War II,[6]:2 its roots can be traced to classical antiquity.[7]:233 Critics cite the works of writers like Aristotle as the earliest forms of technical writing.[7]:234 Geoffrey Chaucer's work, Treatise on the Astrolabe, is an early example of a technical document and is considered to be the first technical document published in English.[8]
With the invention of the mechanical printing press, the onset of the Renaissance and the rise of the Age of Reason, the need to document findings became a necessity, and inventors and scientists like Isaac Newton and Leonardo da Vinci prepared documents that chronicled their inventions and findings.[6]:1 While never called technical documents during their period of publication, these documents played a crucial role in developing modern forms of technical communication and writing.[6]
The field of technical communication grew during the Industrial Revolution.[9]:3 This increased the need to instruct people how to use the more and more complex machines that were being invented and used.[9]:8 However, unlike the past, where skills were handed down through oral traditions, no one besides the inventors knew how to use these new devices. Writing thus became the fastest and most effective way to disseminate information, and writers who could document these devices were desired.[9]
During the 20th century, the need for technical writing skyrocketed, and the profession finally became officially recognized. The events of World War I and World War II led to advances in medicine, military hardware, computer technology, and aerospace technologies.[6]:2 This rapid growth, coupled with the urgency of war, created an immediate need for well-designed and written documents that chronicled the use of these technologies. Technical writing was in high demand during this time, and became an official job title during World War II.[6]:1
Following World War II, technological advances led to an increase in consumer goods and standards of living.[6]:3 During the post-war boom, public services like libraries and universities, as well as transport systems like buses and highways saw massive amounts of growth, and the need for writers to chronicle these processes increased.[6]:1 It was also during this period that computers started being used in large businesses and universities. Notably, in 1949, Joseph D. Chapline authored the first computational technical document, an instruction manual for the BINAC computer.[10]
The discovery of the transistor in 1947 allowed computers to be produced more cheaply than ever before.[6]:3 These cheaper prices meant that computers could now be purchased by individuals and small businesses.[6]:3 And as a result of the computer's growing prominence, the need for writers who could explain and document these devices grew.[6]:3 The profession of technical writing saw further expansion during the 1970s and 1980s as consumer electronics found their way into the homes of more and more people.[6]
In recent years, the prominence of computers in society has led to many advances in the field of digital communications, leading to many changes in the tools technical writers use.[6]:3 Hypertext, word processors, graphics editing programs, and page layout software have made the creation of technical documents faster and easier than ever before, and technical writers of today must be proficient in these programs.[3]:8–9
Techniques[edit]
Good technical writing is concise, focused, easy to understand, free of errors, and is audience-based.[11]:7 Technical writers focus on making their documents as clear as possible, avoiding overly technical phrases and stylistic choices like passive voice and nominalizations.[3]:236–245 Because technical documents are used in real-world situations, it should always be explicitly clear what the subject matter of a technical document is and what should be done with the presented information. It would be disastrous if, for example, a technical writer's instructions on how to use a high-powered X-ray machine were difficult to decipher.
Technical writing requires a writer to extensively examine his or her audience.[3]: 84–114 A technical writer needs to be aware of his or her audience's existing knowledge about the material he or she is discussing as the knowledge base of the writer's audience will determine the content and focus of a document.[3]: 84–114 For example, an evaluation report discussing a scientific study's findings that is written to a group of highly skilled scientists will be very differently constructed than one intended for the general public. Technical writers do not have to be subject-matter experts (SMEs) themselves and generally collaborate with SMEs to complete tasks that require more knowledge about a subject than they possess.[3]:51
Technical writing must be accurate. A technical writer, after analyzing his or her audience, knows what they are trying to communicate. The goal from there is to convey the message in an accurate and ethical manner. Physical, environmental, or financial repercussions could result if a writer does this incorrectly. Knowing the audience is important to accuracy because the language will be tailored according to what they understand about the subject at hand. For example, instructions on how to correctly and safely build a bookshelf are included when purchased. Those instructions are constructed so that anyone could follow along, including accurate details as to where each fastener goes. If those instructions were inaccurate, the bookshelf could be unstable and fail.[12]
Document design and layout are also very important components of technical writing.[3]:261–286 Technical writers spend large amounts of time ensuring their documents are readable, because a poorly designed document hampers a reader's comprehension. Technical document design stresses proper usage of document design choices like bullet points, font-size, and bold text.[13] Images, diagrams, and videos are also commonly employed by technical writers because these media can often convey complex information, like a company's annual earnings or a product's design features, far more efficiently than text.[3]:306–307
Technical documents[edit]
Technical writing covers many genres and writing styles depending on the information and audience.[3]:84–114 Technical documents are not solely produced by technical writers. Almost anyone who works in a professional setting produces technical documents of some variety. Some examples of technical writing include:
Instructions and procedures are documents that help either developers or end users operate or configure a device or program.[11]:226 Examples of instructional documents include user manuals and troubleshooting guides for computer programs, computer hardware, household products, medical equipment, mechanical products and automobiles.
Proposals. Most projects begin with a proposal—a document that describes the purpose of a project, the tasks that will be performed in the project, the methods used to complete the project, and finally the cost of the project.[11]:191 Proposals cover a wide range of subjects. For example, a technical writer may author a proposal that outlines how much it will cost to install a new computer system, a marketing professional may write a proposal with the product offerings and a teacher may write a proposal that outlines how a new biology class will be structured.
Emails, letters, and memoranda are some of the most frequently written documents in a business.[11]:117 Letters and emails can be constructed with a variety of goals—some are aimed at simply communicating information while others are designed to persuade the recipient to accomplish a certain task. While letters are usually written to people outside of a company, memoranda (memos) are documents written to other employees within the business.[11]:118
Press releases. When a company wants to publicly reveal a new product or service, they will have a technical writer author a press release, a document that describes the product's functions and value to the public.[14]
Specifications are design outlines that describe the structure, parts, packaging, and delivery of an object or process in enough detail that another party can reconstruct it.[15] For example, a technical writer might diagram and write the specifications for a smartphone or bicycle so that a manufacturer can produce the object.
Descriptions are shorter explanations of procedures and processes that help readers understand how something works.[3]:564 For example, a technical writer might author a document that shows the effects of greenhouse gases or demonstrates how the braking system on a bike functions.
Résumés and job applications are another example of technical documents.[11]:284–285 They are documents that are used in a professional setting to inform readers of the author's credentials.
Technical reports are written to provide readers with information, instructions, and analysis on tasks.[11]:141–143 Reports come in many forms. For example, a technical writer might evaluate a building that is for sale and produce a trip report that highlights his or her findings and whether or not he or she believes the building should be purchased. Another writer who works for a non-profit company may publish an evaluation report that shows the findings of the company's research into air pollution.
Case study is a published report about a person, group, or situation that has been studied over time; also : a situation in real life that can be looked at or studied to learn about something.[16] For example, an individual's challenging situation at his or her workplace and how he or she resolved it is a case study.
White papers are documents that are written for experts in a field and typically describe a solution to a technological or business challenge or problem.[11]:644 Examples of white papers include a piece that details how to make a business stand out in the market or a piece explaining how to prevent cyber-attacks on businesses.
Web sites. The advent of hypertext has changed the way documents are read, organized, and accessed. Technical writers of today are often responsible for authoring pages on websites like "About Us" pages or product pages and are expected to be proficient in web development tools.[17]:484–504
Tools[edit]
The following tools are used by technical writers to author and present documents:
Desktop publishing tools or word processors. Word processors such as Scrivener, Microsoft Word, Apple Pages, and LibreOffice Writer are used by technical writers to author, edit, design, and print documents. Since technical writing is as much about the page's layout as it is the written language, Desktop Publishing tools such as Adobe FrameMaker and LyX are also used by Technical Writers.[18] These programs function similarly to word processors but provide users with more options and features for the document's design and automate much of the formatting.[19]
Help authoring tools are used by technical writers to create the help systems that are packaged with software products, delivered through web browsers or provided as files users can view on their computers.[20] When writing instructional procedures for incredibly complex programs or systems, technical writers will use these tools to assist them and simplify the process. Adobe RoboHelp, MadCap Flare and HelpNDoc are a few examples of Help Authoring Tools.
Image editing software. Often, images and other visual elements can portray information better than paragraphs of texts.[3]:306–307 In these instances, image editing software like Adobe Photoshop and GIMP are used by technical writers to create and edit the visual aspects of documents like photos, icons, and diagrams.
Collaborative software programs. Because technical writing often involves communication between multiple individuals who work for different companies, it can be a collaborative affair.[3]:57 Thus, technical writers use Wiki Systems like MediaWiki , eXo Platform and Atlassian Confluence and shared document workspaces like Microsoft SharePoint and Google Docs to work with other writers and parties to construct technical documents.[3]:74
Web development tools. Technical writers' jobs are no longer limited to just producing documents. They must now also produce content for company's corporate and other professional web sites.[17]:485 Web Development Tools like Adobe Dreamweaver are standard tools in the industry that technical writers are expected to be proficient in.
Graphing software. In order to portray statistical information like the number of visits to a restaurant or the amount of money a university spends on its sporting programs, technical writers will use graphs and flowcharts.[3]:306–307 While programs like Microsoft Excel and Word can create basic graphs and charts, sometimes technical writers must produce incredibly complex and detailed graphs that require functions not available in these programs. In these instances, powerful graphing and diagramming tools like Microsoft Visio are used to effectively organize and design graphs and diagrams.[21]
Screen capture tools Technical writers commonly use Screen Capture Tools like Camtasia Studio and Snagit to capture their desktops.[22][23] When creating instructions for computer software, it's much easier for a technical writer to simply record themselves completing a task than it is to write a lengthy series of instructions that describe how the task must be performed. Screen capture tools are also used to take screenshots of programs and software running on user's computers and then to create accompanying diagrams.
