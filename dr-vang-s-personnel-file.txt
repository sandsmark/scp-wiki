**Clearance:** Level --2-- --3-- 4

**Position:** --Memeticist-- --Project Manager-- Senior Project Management Adviser

**Education:** PhD in Neuroscience, Master's Degree in Information Science, Master's Degree in Sociology

//I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing.//- Dr. Vang.
//Update: What the fuck am I supposed to be doing?//- Dr. Vang.
//Update: **T-PAW**//- Dr. Vang
-----
**Personal History:** [DATA EXPUNGED] Minnesota, after which he moved to ████████ on a work visa from Prometheus Labs. Due to Dr. Vang's poor long-term memory, his exact responsibilities and projects at the facility are unknown. He resigned from Prometheus Labs following --contract disputes.-- a third-place finish in the ████████ Telekill Poll behind Drs. Bachmann and Paul.

In his 19██ paper titled "Mathematical Analysis of the Human Senses and Memory" (published in the ██████ Journal of Neurology), Dr. Vang demonstrated an understanding of the mathematical tools and measurements used by Foundation scientists in understanding memes, along with the Fundamental Theorem of Memetics. 

While a paper of such scope would normally be considered groundbreaking, the Foundation moved quickly to excise the information and employ Dr. Vang as a researcher. After displaying high levels of competence and ingenuity, Dr. Vang was given a promotion. After subsequently displaying no competence whatsoever and --repeatedly fucking up-- exhibiting ingenuity unsuitable for the task at hand, he was then given another promotion to a position of no power or responsibility.

Recent intelligence reports indicate that Dr. Vang had a girlfriend. Further analyses indicate that said girlfriend was probably memetic or something. Reports of Dr. Vang being "dope on the floor and magic on the mic" are --unconfirmed-- exaggerated.

**Addendum:** After incident TPAW-2, Dr. Vang is to be contained at Site 33's Infohazard Wing pending --classification as an SCP object.-- inauguration.
