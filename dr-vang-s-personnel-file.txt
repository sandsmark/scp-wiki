**Name:** Dr. █████ Vang, PhD

**Clearance:** Level --2-- --3-- 4

**Position:** --Memeticist-- --Project Manager-- Senior Project Management Advisor

**Education:** PhD in Neuroscience, Master's Degree in Information Science, Master's Degree in Mathematics

**Duties:** --Researching memetic and mind-affecting SCP items; essential R&D-- --Project management-- Advisory duties regarding the management of several projects.

//I have [[[SCP-1902 | no idea]]] what the fuck I'm doing.//- Dr. Vang.
//Update: What the fuck am I supposed to be doing?//- Dr. Vang.
//Update: **T-PAW**//- Dr. Vang
-----
**Personal History:** [DATA EXPUNGED] Minnesota, after which he moved to ████████ on a work visa from Prometheus Labs. Due to Dr. Vang's poor long-term [[[SCP-868 | memory]]], his exact responsibilities and projects at the facility are unknown. He resigned from Prometheus Labs following --contract disputes.-- a third-place finish in the ████████ Telekill Poll behind Drs. Bachmann and Paul.

In his 19██ paper titled "Mathematical Analysis of the Human Senses and Memory" (published in the ██████ Journal of Neurology), Dr. Vang demonstrated an understanding of the mathematical [[[SCP-721 | tools]]] and measurements used by Foundation scientists in understanding memes, along with the Fundamental Theorem of Memetics. 

While a [[[SCP-824 | paper]]] of such scope would normally be considered groundbreaking, the Foundation moved quickly to excise the information and [[[SCP-1141 | employ]]] Dr. Vang as a researcher. After displaying high levels of competence and ingenuity, Dr. Vang was given a [[[Misnomer | promotion]]]. After subsequently displaying no [[[SCP-1606 | competence]]] whatsoever and --going batshit crazy-- exhibiting ingenuity unsuitable for the task at hand, he was then given another promotion to a position of no power or responsibility.

Recent intelligence reports indicate that Dr. Vang had a girlfriend. Further analyses indicate that said girlfriend was probably memetic or something. Reports of Dr. Vang being "dope on the floor and magic on the [[[SCP-1248 | mic]]]" are unconfirmed.

[[tab Poetry]]
{{The following works are out-of-character.}}

**__One of a Kind__**
You say your love's unique - I disagree
Conceit this common just reveals to all
That blinded by romantic fantasy
It's not so easy for this thought to fall
This fantasy is easy to critique
When one sees how humanity has grown
Six billion hearts that feel themselves unique
Six billion souls that fear to be alone
You cannot say that love lacks value, though
To say as much would mock the earth and air
Generic love is special on its own
Just as important as what's always there
It's this emotion, love that never dims
Of which the poets rightf'lly sing their hymns

**__The Unorganized Ramblings of a Hypocrite__**
Fighting against me, this culture of fear
My values made clear in carnival mirrors
Are missing in action, a negative reaction
Defined as a contrast to my subconscious redaction
I see and I hate, and I'm avoiding debate
It's inexcusable for enlightenment to occur at this rate
I know when I sleep, my dreams are the same as before
And entropy means it's so easy to ignore
A coincidental hive mind deciding who's smartest
Literally thousands of interchangeable artists
And even when I know it, I'm one of 'em, fuck 'em
'Cause cultural inertia means I can't just unstuck 'em
I pledge allegiance to the economy and all it entails
By virtue of my patronage 'til all of it fails
Avalanches above from the business below
Yet ten billion likes won't unmelt any snow
It's my high-minded provincialism that finds it acceptable
To use the environment as mother and trash receptacle
Because I can't unburn a forest up from the ground
And my greatest efforts don't add up to an original sound
'Cause the undisputed masters of the English language
Are centuries past, and it causes me anguish
That my race for the future means forgetting the past
At least I can see why decay is so fast
I don't know what's important, and I speak as humanity
Or at least the portion responsible for all this insanity
And one nation unto debt is unrefundable
But I balance only the spreadsheets and that's irresponsible
My mast'ry of the tangible leaves my worth too infringible
And the status of my generation's rights is uncivil
I'm stuck and the mud and the mud is a poison
And what I say is uncomfortable 'cause I say I'm avoidin'
Hypocrisy, and in the end it's the same pile of crud
That lets me take a bath in this pile of mud
So if you move or you don't, it don't even matter
'Cause when it comes down to it, I'll end up the latter
