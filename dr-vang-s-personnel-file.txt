**Personal History:** [DATA EXPUNGED] Minnesota, after which he moved to ████████ on a work visa from Prometheus Labs. Due to Dr. Vang's poor long-term [[[SCP-868 |memory]]], his exact responsibilities and projects at the facility are unknown.

In his 20██ paper titled "Mathematical Analysis of the Human Senses and Memory" (published in the ██████ Journal of Neurology), Dr. Vang demonstrated an understanding of the mathematical tools and measurements used by Foundation scientists in understanding memes, along with the Fundamental Theorem of Memetics. 

While a paper of such scope would normally be considered groundbreaking, the Foundation moved quickly to excise the information and employ Dr. Vang as a researcher. After displaying high levels of competence and ingenuity, Dr. Vang was given a promotion.

Reports of Dr. Vang being "dope on the floor and magic on the [[[SCP-1248 |mic]]]" are unconfirmed.

//HOW DID THIS GET HERE I AM NOT GOOD WITH COMPUTER//- Dr. Vang

**Notable Flaws:**
* [[[SCP-1268 |Agoraphobia]]], coulrophobia, nyctophobia, [[[Bees |apiphobia]]], and arachnophobia.
* Will make highly inappropriate and/or inflammatory comments on occasion without notice. Dr. Vang claims not to [[[SCP-148 |know]]] ahead of time that these comments are inappropriate.
* Refuses to learn in-depth information about computers and modern technology.
* Refuses to wear additional [[[SCP-1626 |clothing]]] in colder conditions.
* [[[SCP-____-J |Procrastination.]]]
* Refuses to research SCPs whose designation contains neither "6" nor "8". Is visibly uncomfortable while working with [[[SCP-336 |odd]]] [[[Lumancer |numbers]]].
* Difficulty controlling temper in the presence of [[[SCP-066 |chil]]][[[SCP-1448 |dren]]].

//Who told Dr. Vang that most of his projects had the number one in them? He's locked himself in the storage closet with some spreadsheets and hasn't said anything in two days except to ask for alcohol and ink. He refuses to use pens, what the hell is he using the ink for?//- Dr. Vang's Assistant

//"Berserker Rage" is not an excuse for chasing five-year-olds with an [[[SCP-1646 |axe]]]. Dr. Vang is currently awaiting disciplinary measures.//- Director ███████

//"Nor is "demon [[[SCP-984 |rabies]]]".//- Director ███████
