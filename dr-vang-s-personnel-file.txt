**Personal History:** [DATA EXPUNGED] Minnesota, after which he moved to ████████ on a work visa from Prometheus Labs. Due to Dr. Vang's poor long-term memory, his exact responsibilities and projects at the facility are unknown. However, he is responsible for informing the Foundation of [[[SCP-868]]] and of the origin of [[[SCP-148 | SCP-█48]]].

In his 20██ paper titled "Mathematical Analysis of the Human Senses and Memory" (published in the ██████ Journal of Neurology), Dr. Vang demonstrated an understanding of the mathematical tools and measurements used by Foundation scientists in understanding memes, along with the Fundamental Theorem of Memetics. 

While a paper of such scope would normally be considered groundbreaking, the Foundation moved quickly to excise the information and employ Dr. Vang as a researcher. After displaying high levels of competence and ingenuity, Dr. Vang was given a promotion.

Reports of Dr. Vang being "dope on the floor and magic on the mic" are unconfirmed.

//HOW DID THIS GET HERE I AM NOT GOOD WITH COMPUTER//- Dr. Vang

**Notable Flaws:**
* Refuses to research SCPs whose designation contains neither "6" nor "8". Is visibly uncomfortable while working with odd numbers.[[footnote]]//Who told Dr. Vang that most of his projects had the number one in them? He's locked himself in the storage closet with some spreadsheets and hasn't said anything in three days except to ask for alcohol and ink.//- Dr. Vang's Assistant

//Guise. Guise. Drunk budgeting. Am I right, or am I right?//- Dr. Vang[[/footnote]]
* Agoraphobia, coulrophobia, nyctophobia, apiphobia, and arachnophobia.
* Will make highly inappropriate and/or inflammatory comments on occasion without notice. Dr. Vang claims not to know ahead of time that these comments are inappropriate.
* Refuses to learn in-depth information about computers and modern technology.
* [[[SCP-____-J |Procrastination.]]]
* Difficulty controlling temper in the presence of children.
//"Berserker Rage" is not an excuse for chasing five-year-olds with an axe. Dr. Vang is currently awaiting disciplinary measures.//- Director ███████
