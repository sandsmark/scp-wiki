**Item #:** SCP-4370

**Object Class:** Safe

**Threat Level:** ##yellow|●## Yellow

**Special Containment Procedures:** All roads and pathways leading to SCP-4370 have been redirected. Barbed metal fencing has been constructed in a rectangular formation around SCP-4370 to ensure interaction is not possible. Area-92 has been constructed within an opposing hill to observe SCP-4370. Interaction of any kind with SCP-4370 is to be approved by Senior Researcher ███████. As of Exploration 4370-1, Permission to enter SCP-4370-1 is to be strictly reserved for the following task forces.

* Provisional Task Force Epsilon-72, "Treasure State"
* Mobile Task Force Lambda-5, "White Rabbits"

**Description:** SCP-4370 is a decommissioned playground slide located in Bitterroot National Forest, Ravalli County, Montana. SCP-4370 reaches a height of approximately 3.04 meters and a length of 9.14 meters.

SCP-4370 is entirely unpainted, with rust present on the majority of its surface. The words "fun slide" have been written in lowercase english on the sides of SCP-4370 with what has been identified as black permanent marker.[[footnote]]Said permanent marker was recovered 0.6 meters from SCP-4370. Marker was identified as belonging to the ██████ brand.[[/footnote]]

Following one minute of exposure to SCP-4370, adolescent or adult individuals will experience a lingering feeling akin to being watched or spoken to by a child. Following two minutes of exposure, individuals will report hearing multiple childlike voices, commonly under the age of seven, originating from unknown sources. The intensity and tone of these voices will progressively increase in hostility until the individual reaches ten minutes of exposure, where they will experience pain similar to being physically assaulted by multiple small children.[[footnote]]Kicking, hitting, slapping, punching, and biting have all been reported.[[/footnote]] This effect will continue until the individual has died. It is important to note that no children are present during any level of exposure.

Toddlers, infants, and prepubescent individuals will █████████ █████████ following five seconds of exposure to SCP-4370, resulting in immediate death. This effect will continue even if the individual is removed from SCP-4370's proximity.

If an individual decides to slide down SCP-4370, SCP-4370 will function as a non-anomalous playground slide until the individual reaches ground level, where they will enter SCP-4370-1 if the sliding process has not been interrupted by an outside force.

SCP-4370-1-B appears to be a carbon copy of the state of Montana in the year 2019, with the primary exception being that any and all matter within SCP-4370-1 fails to reflect any colored light on the visible spectrum, along with the fact that all sapient life has gone extinct. Vegetation exists and functions normally within SCP-4370-1, though no sign of sapient life has been observed as of exploration 4370-1. It is important to note that any matter outside of the state of Montana not exist within SCP-4370-1, and is instead replaced entirely by empty space.
