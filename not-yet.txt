Does she?
We ask trembling 
Gazing upon the void
A hole in the vast sea of stars 
Waiting

Can she?
The answer a
Notion in lore unknown
So much was forgotten Somewhere
In time

Should she?
None speak of this
Black thought born from despair 
Though sickened we refuse to heed
Her voice 

Will she?
We strive to still
The advent of the last
Moon after moon her anguished cry
Rings forth

Do we?
Truly fathom
The task undertaken
As we wait in dread for her childâ€™s
Howl
