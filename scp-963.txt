**Item #:** SCP-963

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-963 is given into the care of a current D level operative, as well as personnel classified as Dr. Bright's assistant. Assistant is to be chosen by O5 for loyalty to the Foundation. 

--SCP-963 is to be attached to the subject's forehead or the back of the subject's hand using a suitably strong epoxy.-- SCP-963 is now hung by a chain from subjects neck. 963 is not allowed to be hidden upon the subject's body. Any attempt to do so will be met with lethal force.

--If the current D-level subject exceeds a thirty day life span, they are to be executed and a new subject chosen to wear 963.-- To save on budget, any body SCP-963 is installed upon is given a stay of execution until it passes on of natural causes, or 963 is transferred to a new host.

--//**ATTENTION**:// As of 12/13/1978 963 is not allowed in proximity of any Euclid or Keter class humanoid SCPs. This directive is to be enforced lethally.-- Rescinded, O5-6, O5-8, O5-9

--//**ATTENTION**:// As of [[[incident-239-b-clef-kondraki |Incident-239-b Clef-Kondraki]]], SCP-963 is not allowed at Site 17 without the express permission of three O5's. Violations are to be met with lethal force.-- Rescinded, O5-6, O5-8, O5-9



**Description:** 

7/13/1977- Dr Jack Bright is hired in as a researcher. A leading mind of his time, our offers to give him something new to work with are incentive enough to entice him.

7/28/1977- SCP-963 is discovered in the personal effects of ██████ ███.  ██████ ███ had been found dead by apparent suicide, surrounded by a number of supernaturally related books. Our Agent in the area found that 963 was incapable of being damaged. Dr. Bright assigned responsibility of finding out what else 963 might be capable of.

9/13/1977- [[[scp-076 |SCP-076]]] breaks containment. Dr. Bright has the misfortune of being outside the containment cell when Abel escapes, and is the first person cut down by 076's rampage. Review of the tape shows Dr. Bright holding 963 at the moment of his death.

9/14/1977- D1-113, tasked in the cleaning up of Able's rampage, picks up 963. An immediate, noticeable change comes over D1-113. Interview follows.

Interview Log x████, Date: ██-█-████

████: Could you please tell me your name?

d1-113: It's Jack Bright, you damn well know it is!

████:I believe you are Tom Higly, working for us as part of your life sentence.

d1-113: Don't be ridiculous!  I couldn't possibly be- (SCP-963 is removed at this time from D1-113s possession. An further MRI shows that D1-113 ceases all higher brain functions. 963 is returned, upon which brain function returns.)

████:Dr. Bright?

d1-113:What?

████:We appear to have a problem.
----

After much experimentation, it has been discovered that when any human comes into direct skin contact with SCP-963, the mind of the subject is wiped, Dr. Bright is projected from 963 onto to the subject. It is known that memories native to Dr. Bright transfer from host to host. 

If a subject maintains contact for thirty days their brain functions become a duplicate of the late Dr. Bright's. If 963 is removed after this time period, the subject retains an independent copy of the consciousness of Jack Bright. Sanctions were put in place to prevent multiple instances of Dr. Bright from being created to prevent Dr. Bright from collaborating with himself, it was found this was not needed. It seems Dr. Bright cannot stand himself, and takes some glee in terminating duplicate cases of himself.

As of ██/██/████, Dr. Bright has been given permission to have four unique bodies kept in stasis for when he needs them, to lessen the rotating body count.

**NOTE:** //Yes, we all find it funny to stick Dr. Bright in female bodies, however, he has come to adapt to them rather too well, as proven by the happy birthday song he performed for Dr. Clef ala Marilyn Monroe. This adaptability is why we have a chimpanzee on hand for his next transfer.// -  Agent ███████

**NOTE:** //I'm still not sure what the big deal was about it actually being Dr. Bright inside that body. That D-Class was totally hot. Would I have still boned her if I'd known it was Dr. Bright in there? Next question. . .// - Dr. Clef

**NOTE:** //Which one of you thought it would be funny to stick SCP-963 in my desk? I need a body, stat.// -Dr. Inferno
