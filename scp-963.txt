7/13/1977- Dr Jack Bright is hired in as a researcher. A leading mind of his time, our offers to give him something new to work with are incentive enough to entice him.

7/28/1977- SCP-963 is discovered in the personal effects of ██████ ███.  ██████ ███ had been found dead by apparent suicide, surrounded by a number of supernaturally related books. Our Agent in the area found that 963 was incapable of being damaged. Dr. Bright assigned responsibility of finding out what else 963 might be capable of.

9/13/1977- [[[scp-076 |SCP-076]]] breaks containment. Dr. Bright has the misfortune of being outside the containment cell when Abel escapes, and is the first person cut down. Review of tape shows Dr. Bright holding 963 at the moment of his death.

9/14/1977- D1-113, tasked in the cleaning up of Abels rampage, picks up 963. An immediate change comes over him. Interview follows.

Interview Log x████, Date: ██-█-████

████: Could you please tell me your name?

d1-113: It's Jack bright, you damn well know it is!

████:I believe you are Tom Higly, working for us as part of your life sentence.

d1-113: Don't be ridiculous!  I couldn't possibly be- (SCP-963 is removed from d1-113s possession. d1-113 ceases all higher brain functions. 963 is returned, and function returns.)

████:Dr. Bright?

d1-113:What?

████:We appear to have a problem.
----

After much experimentation, it is discovered that when any human maintains skin contact with SCP-963, the mind of Dr. Bright takes over. Memories transfer from host to host. 

The only problem occurs if a subject maintains contact for thirty days, at which point, their brain functions become a duplicate of the late Dr. Brights. If 963 is removed after this time period, the subject becomes an independent Jack Bright, acting separately from the original. Although sanctions were put in place to prevent this from occuring to prevent Dr. Bright from collaborating with himself, it was found this was not needed. It seems Dr. Bright cannot stand himself, and takes some glee in terminating such cases.

//NOTE: Yes, we all find it funny to stick Dr. Bright in female bodies, however, he has come to adapt to them rather too well, as proven by the happy birthday song he performed for Dr. Clef, ala Marilyn Monroe. Which is why we have a chimpanzee on hand for his next ransfer.//
