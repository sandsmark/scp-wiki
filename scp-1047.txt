**Item#:** SCP-1047

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1047 is to be contained within a sealed chamber of volume greater than 50m^^3^^. The composition of the air within this chamber is to be continuously monitored with redundant systems, with oxygen to be pumped into the room when the carbon dioxide level rises above 500ppm, unless testing is being done. All furnishings within the room are to be bolted down, and the room is to include standard emergency exits on the walls and ceiling as well as the floor. All personnel who enter the room are to wear rebreathing gear to minimize risk of accidental activation.

**Description:** SCP-1047 is a "One Way" street sign that is made of painted steel. The main body of the sign is black, with a white arrow. When the words "One Way" inside the arrow are upright, the arrow points to the observer's right. The sign is extensively defaced with spray paint and bumper stickers, which are similar to gang tags used in the area.

When SCP-1047 is exposed to a carbon dioxide level of greater than 600ppm, it activates, and all gravity within the room will immediately and abruptly switch direction to point in the direction of the arrow on the One Way sign. If, during falling towards the new direction of gravity, the direction of the arrow is changed (i.e. because the sign spins in midair or encounters an object during freefall), the direction of gravity will then immediately point in the new direction of the arrow. These properties do not extend beyond the walls of the room in question, and can be interrupted by opening a door or window to promote gas exchange.

SCP-1047 was discovered on ██/██/19██ following Incident 1047-██, involving SCP-1047 being activated within an apartment building, after the sign was stolen from a telephone pole at the intersection of ███████ and 21st Street in █████, Oregon. The carbon dioxide from the breaths of two teenage boys in the same room as SCP-1047 resulted in [DATA EXPUNGED]. Deaths were explained as the result of a truck crashing into the building.

**Addendum 1047-02:** During testing, it was found that SCP-1047 can be activated by automobile exhaust as well as human exhalation. It is theorized that if SCP-1047 were to be activated in its original outdoors location due to automobile exhaust, [DATA EXPUNGED]
