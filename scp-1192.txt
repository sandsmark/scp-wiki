**Item #:** SCP-1192

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1192 is contained in a dedicated aviary and is to be provided a diet of fruit with protein and other dietary supplements, as it will refuse to consume seeds and insects that are normal to its diet. SCP-1192 is to be provided with several pencils and pages of paper to allow it to communicate.

In the case that SCP-1192 becomes beligerent, mild sedatives may be introduced into its food and water supply, but only under close veterinary supervision.

**Description:** SCP-1192 is a juvenile male Gang-gang Cockatoo (//Callocephalon fimbriatum//), approximately 33.5 cm in length and normally native to south-east Australia.

SCP-1192 appears to be sentient and sapient, with an intellect and common knowledge consistent with that of a human child between the ages of six (6) and eight (8). SCP-1192 is unusually disheveled, as it appears to be unable or unwilling to preen itself, and has difficulty flying despite being essentially healthy and uninjured. Close examinations have shown a slight, healed-over contusion on the back of SCP-1192's head, but no internal damage has been found.

SCP-1192 was discovered and brought into containment by Agent █████ on ██/██/██, who at the time was embedded as an undercover agent in the Newark Police Department in New Jersey. It is believed at this time that SCP-1192 accosted Agent █████ due to his being a perceived authority figure in police uniform. Agent █████ became suspicious due to SCP-1192's uncommon species and erratic behavior, and was able to restrain SCP-1192 and bring it to Site ██ for examination.

**Addendum 1192-01:** Experiment Log 1192-01

Shortly after initial containment, experimentation was performed in which SCP-1192 was introduced to a multitude of objects in a controlled environment in order to deduce its abilities. Upon being introduced to the testing chamber, SCP-1192 immediately gravitated to a pencil and paper and began to attempt to write crude sentences. At this point, Dr. █████████ was brought in in an attempt to communicate with SCP-1192.

> **Dr. █████████**: I am Dr. █████████. I'm here to speak with you. Who are you?
> 
> **SCP-1192**: (writes "timmi" [sic], followed by "wher am I" [sic])
> 
> **Dr. █████████**: You're at a medical center, Timmy. A hospital. Do you know what happened to you?
> 
> **SCP-1192**: (writes "no", then "i wana go hom" [sic])
> 
> **Dr. █████████**: Where do you live, Timmy?

After several minutes and with some difficulty, SCP-1192 managed to write down an address for a residential home in ██████████, Montana. Undercover agents sent to the specified location determined that the location was inhabited by one Mr. and Mrs. ███████, who had a son named Timmy ███████, age 7. Agents noted nothing out of the ordinary with the family.

**Addendum 1192-02:** Researcher Note

> As SCP-1192 is unable to manipulate objects with enough coordination to play with the video games it requested and it shows little interest in the other toys we have offered it, it has taken to scribbling and making crude drawings with the materials we provided. A list of notable materials are as follows:
> 
> * Several pages of unrelated words, presumed to be practice.
> * Several pages of crude drawings, including race cars, airplanes and fictional animals and monsters.
> * A single page with the words "wy am I a bird" [sic] as well as several more indecipherable sentences.
> * A drawing of what appears to be a small child holding the hands of two adults. The child is scratched out and the paper is ripped. The reserve side of the page has the words "i wan my mom" [sic].
> * A single page with 126 instances of the word "mom" and 76 instances of the word "home".
