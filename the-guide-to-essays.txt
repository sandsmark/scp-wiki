**A Guide to the Unofficial Essays about SCP Writing**

First, a few questions and answers:

**Q:** What is an Essay, as opposed to a Guide?
**A:**  Both Essays and Guides are documents written by site users to help others with SCP writing and use of the site in general.  Guides have been chosen by the Staff as either required reading for applicants, or useful enough to be on a short list of recommended reading.  Essays are all of the documents of this type that have not been chosen as Guides.

**Q:** Does that mean Essays are not as good or useful as Guides?
**A:** Not necessarily.  The list of required/recommended reading is intentionally kept manageably short, so there is lots of good information here that is not "official."

**Q:** Can anyone write an Essay?
**A:** Sure, but it will have a Rating Module on it, and is subject to the same voting rules as other pages.  If the membership doesn't like it, it will be deleted.

**Q:** What do I do if I think my Essay should really be a Guide?
**A:** Ask a member of the Senior Staff/Mods/Admins.  They will raise it for Staff discussion.

**Q:** So if these are the Essays, where are the Guides?
**A:**  Here: http://www.scp-wiki.net/guide-hub There are also some on the drop-down menu and the sidebar on all the site pages.
