------
**Profile:** Dr. Llewellyn is a highly trained researcher of the Foundation and self-described "polymath," notable for his numerous academic degrees. Easily entertained by the most sophomoric of comedy, his loyalty to the Foundation is matched only by his love of cider and gin.

Dr. Llewellyn was born and raised in San Francisco, California, and spent a period of his young adulthood in Albuquerque, [[[SCP-1912-J|New Mexico]]]. He settled in Vaduz, Liechtenstein for one week in October, 19██, mostly to reference his awareness of the principality on every resume.

He is a member of the local humanist association, and would be skeptical of anomalous entities as well, had [[[SCP-682]]] not eaten his favourite hat during a breach when Dr. Llewellyn was still a civilian. The Foundation's admiration of his credentials saw him recruited the following evening.

During his tenure at the Foundation, Dr. Llewellyn has documented numerous █ objects, none of them serious, and engaged in ██ extramarital affairs with other personnel, none of them serious. His favourite mottos are "If you can't convince them, confuse them," and "Why is the rum always gone?"

Dr. Llewellyn once swore loyalty to the King of Tonga during a drunken stupor, only to find himself on a barge destined for Kiribati the next morning. It was still more comfortable than the USCGC //Smilax//.
