**Item #:** SCP-4899

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** 
[[collapsible show="+ Show prior containment procedures" hide="-Hide prior containment procedures"]]
Dedicated Foundation satellites are to remain at the orbital coordinates RA 4h 57m 14s, Dec +17° 32’ 36”, with a no more than 1% deviation deemed acceptable from this designated position. Dedicated satellites are to remain in high Earth orbit, intercepting, recording, and scrambling any transmissions that come from SCP-4899 to resemble cosmic background radiation.

Foundation operatives embedded within radio-based observatories are to prevent the observation of SCP-4899, as well as the reception of any transmissions from the object. Amnestics (up to Class-C) may be administered if necessary.

Recorded transmissions from SCP-4899 may be beamed to Lunar Area-32 for decoding and storage.

**REVISION**
Following Incident 4899-R, SCP-4899 has been upgraded to Keter classification. SCP-4899 has since stopped broadcasting any transmissions. As of this time, no means exist to properly contain SCP-4899.

**Description:** SCP-4899 is a celestial object approximately 144 light-years from Earth. The object emits no visible light, instead broadcasting radio waves. Interestingly, Foundation observation via spacecraft augmented with temporal sinks has revealed that SCP-4899 is specifically broadcasting to Earth, with no other known areas of reception.

SCP-4899’s transmissions normally include footage of Earth, although the quality of these transmissions is abnormally high for such a distance. Furthermore, rather than being delayed by the speed of light, the object’s broadcasts take place in real time, indicating that SCP-4899, or its creators, have access to faster-than-light technology.

Since discovery, SCP-4899 has been transmitting increasingly more "aware" footage of Earth, switching from no recognizable pattern of locations to metropolitan areas in 18██, to national military bases in 19██, to the locations of various heads of state in 19██, and finally to Foundation areas and sites in 20██. How SCP-4899 has been able to identify Foundation areas based entirely on external observation is currently unknown. Some of SCP-4899’s transmissions can be found below.
