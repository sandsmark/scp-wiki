[[/div]]
**Item#:** SCP-241

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP-241 is to be kept at Site 19 using standard operating procedures for containing Safe-class book- and manuscript-type SCPs (see Document [DATA EXPUNGED]), with the following additional conditions: SCP-241 must be kept open on a flat surface, with restraints across opposing pages of the open book to keep it from closing accidentally. Containment devices must be checked at least once a week for structural integrity. Any anomalies must be reported immediately to [DATA EXPUNGED].

Access to SCP-241 is restricted by four guard armed with [DATA EXPUNGED]. Any and all usage of SCP-241 must be logged, including [DATA EXPUNGED]. Whenever possible, dishes prepared from SCP-241 should be cooked by ████ ███████ (Subject 241-F); any deviations from this policy must be logged as well. SCP-241 must be transported in an authorized bookstand such that it cannot accidentally be closed in transit. Anyone who opens SCP-241 outside of a testing environment must immediately report to the nearest infirmary as well as [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Description:**

SCP-241 appears as a normal book, 33 cm x 23 cm x 3.5 cm, entitled __Good Home Cooking__. The cover of SCP-241 is a red and white checkerboard pattern, with the title in simple black letters on the front and spine. When open, SCP-241 contains 99 recipes, sorted into typical sections of a cookbook. Many of these recipes include a picture of the dish that is invariably appetizing, and a small percentage will call for rare or exotic ingredients.

Whenever SCP-241 is opened by a subject (known as the Target) different from the one who last opened it (i.e. the previous Target), the recipes contained in the book change. Preliminary investigations concluded that if the Target eats a dish prepared from one of the recipes in SCP-241, that person soon dies from apparent anaphylactic shock. Others who eat the same dish are not similarly affected. Testing has been authorized to determine the exact nature of SCP-241’s effects.

SCP-241 appears to be impervious to getting dirty and to at least minor damage. For example, sauces splashed onto its pages disappear almost immediately, and torn pages and nicks on the cover are repaired within seconds. Testing on the limits of SCP-241’s durability are not authorized without approval from [DATA EXPUNGED] and [DATA EXPUNGED].

__**Directive 241-S06, ██/██/20██**__

In light of recent test results with SCP-241, no further testing of SCP-241 on personnel without pre-existing food allergies is authorized without Level 4 Security Clearance. Testing may continue on personnel with pre-existing food allergies as long as documentation of said allergies has been filed with [DATA EXPUNGED]. –O5-██.

__**Directive 241-S09, ██/██/20██**__

Reclassification of SCP-241 to Euclid class is denied. Honestly, the cookbook? Leave it in its room and everything’s fine. It’s no one else’s fault if you don’t know what you’re allergic to and don't bother to find out beforehand. Unless you’re cooking for your significant other, then you’d //better// know. –O5-██.


__**Directive 241-S11, ██/██/20██**__

Cross-testing SCP-241 with other SCPs will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Exposure to [[[SCP-682]]] has already been considered and denied. –O5-██.
