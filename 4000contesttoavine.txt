**Item #:** SCP-4000

**Object Class:** Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** As of July 11, 1979, SCP-4000 is to be considered Neutralized.

[[collapsible show="► View Outdated Special Containment Procedures" hide="▼ Opened"]]

SCP-4000 is to be discontinued from use. Publicly, a cover story involving failing solar arrays and a rapidly decaying orbit is to be circulated by NASA as the reason for the cessation of further missions. 

Observation of SCP-4000 is to be done with orbital satellite MIMIR-1. Information gathered is to be shared with NASA at the discretion of the O5 Council.  

Various scientific periodicals are to publish fictitious reports describing a recently discovered solar phenomenon in which artificial satellites are temporarily obscured from observation.

**Description:** SCP-4000 is the American space station Skylab, launched in 1973 by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for conducting manned experiments in Earth's orbit. SCP-4000 was designed to house up to three crew-members. 

SCP-4000 is host to a variety of anomalous activity with no apparent source. The anomalous activity serves as the onset for a Phase-Event, in which SCP-4000 will disappear from its orbit around the Earth. Phase-Events occur with no set timing, and typically last for several days to weeks. 

At the conclusion of a Phase-Event, SCP-4000 will return to its projected orbital path. In all cases, the crew on board will not be present upon its return. In the majority of cases, the reentry module or space capsule will also be missing. 

**Addendum**: Neutralization

Following the events of Incident_4000_10 [**See Below**], all planned missions to SCP-4000 were cancelled, and SCP-4000 was considered abandoned by NASA. 

Over the next few years SCP-4000 continued to experience Phase-Events, albeit with decreased frequency. In 1978, NASA confirmed that SCP-4000 had experienced rapid orbital decay beyond expected projections, and was slated to reenter Earth's atmosphere around July 11th, 1979. 

As predicted, SCP-4000 entered the Earth's atmosphere on July 11th, breaking up over the Pacific Ocean. A combined Foundation/NASA operation was able to secure 97% of the wreckage, which was deemed non-anomalous in nature. After observation, the remains of SCP-4000 were re-classified as Neutralized.

**May 30th, 1973**
 The crew of SCP-4000 reports a repetitive knocking sound on the door of the airlock module, as well as the observation window. A source is never identified. 

Knowledge of the incident is internally suppressed by various administrators within NASA. 
|
**June 1st, 1973**
During a routine spacewalk, crew-member John Wilkins reports a pushing sensation on his back before he is ejected from SCP-4000. In the half hour it takes for his crew-mates to retract his emergency tether, John is seemingly tugged around in multiple directions as if by force. 
|
**June 7th, 1973**
The Soviet Orion 2 space telescope experiences an almost total systems failure when its orbit approaches SCP-4000. The entire crew is reportedly killed when they attempt to evacuate. The incident is quickly covered up and covertly classified by the Soviet Union. 

Political repercussions are avoided by the intervention of both the Foundation and GRU Division "P". Soviet leadership is given heavily redacted information regarding SCP-4000, expressly without approval of NASA or the United States. 
|
**June 9th, 1973** 
The crew of SCP-4000 reports they are unable to visually perceive planet Earth. This lasts for 24 hours.
|
**June 13th, 1973**
NASA loses contact with SCP-4000 for approximately 4 hours. During the time before radio transmissions resume, all on-board cameras are rendered inoperable. 
|
**June 15th 1973**
Crew aboard SCP-4000 report the presence of a fourth crew-mate, but are unable to provide exact details regarding the individual. The unknown entity eventually opens the airlock module, steps inside, and is not reported again. 
|
**June 19th, 1973**
President Richard Nixon is briefed on SCP-4000 and expresses concern over the mental health of those aboard, as well as the danger posed by the anomalous activity. Due to events unrelated to SCP-4000, communications between the Foundation and the White House break down, and Nixon orders those aboard SCP-4000 back to Earth. 
|
**June 22nd, 1973**
The crew of SCP-4000 prepares for departure. When the Command/Service Module detaches for reentry procedure, SCP-4000 undergoes a Phase-Event which lasts for two and a half hours. When the Phase-Event ends the module fails to return with the rest of SCP-4000. The crew is considered MIA.

**Addendum**: Incident_4000_9

Following the loss of the original NASA astronaut crew, the Foundation drew up plans to conduct experiments with SCP-4000. Based on the assumption that the module had failed to return because it had been detached during the Phase-Event, the O5 Council voted in favor of conducting further manned missions. 

Tensions between the Foundation and President Richard Nixon reached their height in August of 1973, partly in response to Foundation activity both for and against the United States as well as the Soviet Union. 

On August 23rd, President Nixon authorized NASA to carry out it's second planned Skylab mission. Foundation requests for involvement were diplomatically ignored, and the mission commenced on August 25th with the launch of a Saturn IB rocket. 

Ten minutes into the docking procedure, SCP-4000 became partly intangible, causing the Command/Service Module to drift into the space it formerly occupied. Radio transmissions from the crew indicated no adverse effects as a result. Approximately an hour after the start of the incident a Phase-Event occurred, lasting 26 days. The crew as well as the Service/Command Module were missing upon the return of SCP-4000. 

Facing his own domestic political crisis, President Nixon allowed the Foundation to conduct cover-up operations, removing the record of the second Skylab mission from public knowledge. 

**Addendum**: Incident_4000_10

Due to the loss of two Command/Service Modules, NASA was unable to conduct further Skylab Missions. The Foundation reached out to the Soviet Union and made an agreement to reach SCP-4000 using a Russian Proton-K rocket in exchange for sharing any information gathered. 

Three D-Class with military history were selected and given brief astronaut training: 
* D-4K01
* D-4K02
* D-4K03

On November 16th, 1973, the Proton-K successfully reached SCP-4000. The crew was ordered to prepare themselves for a Phase-Event and set up a series of cameras and audio devices. 

Three days later, on November 19th, a Phase-Event occurred and contact with SCP-4000 was lost. The Phase-Event lasted for 39 days and resulted in further political turmoil between the Foundation, the White House, and the Soviet Union. 

Upon return, the crew of SCP-4000, as well as the Soyuz Descent Module, were reported missing. 

On January 1st, 1980, a series of video recordings were transmitted to NASA Mission Control, and quickly secured by the Foundation. They have been transcribed below.

**0:01:** The camera turns and points at what appears to be an abandoned shack. D-4K01 is heard arguing against entering, stating that it shouldn't be there. D-4K02 argues that they need shelter, while D-4K03 maintains a neutral opinion. Eventually D-4K01 sets off on his own, and the others go with him. 

**1:01:** The group approaches a shack identical to the one seen earlier. D-K401 begins to accuse D-4K02 of taking them in circles, but is reminded that he has been leading the group. D-4K03 notes the geography is slightly different around the building. The group decides to move onward. 

**2:01:** The group encounters the same shack as before. D-4K02 and D-4K03 argue that they should look inside, and D-4K01 relents. The camera shows D-4K02 approach the entrance, and then cuts off.

**0:34:** The camera is obscured by the floor, but vague yelling is heard. 

**0:36:** D-4K03 is observed running through the forest. He points the camera behind him, and the trees are observed closing in around him. 

**0:47:** The same shack is observed. D-4K03 is heard weeping. He turns the camera around, and the same shack is shown on his side. He repeats the gesture, with the shack always appearing in the direction he faces. 

**0:50:** The camera is placed on a table, and D-4K03 is seen laying on the floor in a fetal position. The walls of the shack begin to shake, and the floor is observed cracking. 

**1:00:** The floor splits open as a massive sinkhole emerges, swallowing D-4K03 and the building whole.  

**1:04:** The camera finally lands, and the lens cracks. The bodies of D-4K01 and D-4K02 can be observed lying in a heap. Next to them are several decaying spacesuits. Bones can be seen jutting out of several. A few of the suits are emblazoned with a gold hammer and sickle. 

**4:26:** The same scene is recorded for several hours. At one point movement is detected, but the camera runs out of film shortly after.
