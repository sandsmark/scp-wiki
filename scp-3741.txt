**Item #:** SCP-3741

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Currently, all known instances of SCP-3741 are being contained in separate salt water tanks at Site-77. The number of SCP-3741 instances in containment should not exceed fifty at any time. As such, surplus instances are to be incinerated. 

Should any wild instances be discovered, MTF Sigma-13 ("Food Fighters") will be deployed to recover them and return to Site-77. As such, MTF Sigma-13 agents embedded in various national food safety regulatory bodies[[footnote]]Specifically, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA), and the French Agency for Food, Environmental, and Occupational Safety (ANSES).[[/footnote]] will routinely visit oyster farms under their jurisdiction that are known to raise eastern oysters (//Crassostrea virginica//) and are to confiscate any instances of SCP-3741 that they find.

Under no circumstances should an instance of SCP-3741 be ingested. Should an instance be consumed, all responsible individuals are to be detained, interrogated, and amnesticized.

**Description:** SCP-3741 is a phenomenon that is currently exhibited by 29 eastern oysters, but may extend to a small quantity of wild oysters. Instances can be differentiated from non-anomalous oysters due to a variety of biological traits, including functional immortality[[footnote]]Instances are capable of dying, but, assuming they have access to sufficient nutrients, will not die of age[[/footnote]], dull pink meat, and physically identical dark shells. Despite demonstrating the inability to age, SCP-3741 instances are capable of sexual reproduction, and are hermaphroditic like non-anomalous eastern oysters, but can only reproduce with other instances of SCP-3741.

In addition to biological deviations from non-anomalous eastern oysters, instances of SCP-3741 are known to induce a memetic effect when consumed by a subject, hereafter designated as SCP-3741-A. Upon ingestion, SCP-3741-A will become immediately aware of an acquisition of extensive knowledge on a specific topic. The nature of this knowledge varies between instances, but is always related to the desires of the SCP-3741-A instance. See Addendum 3741-B for more information.

**Addendum 3741-A:** Discovery
SCP-3741 was discovered after Foundation agents embedded in the FDA were notified of an abnormal bloom of oysters at ███████ █████ Oyster Farm in ████████, Maine. In response, the agents visited the farm and confiscated the oysters, logging them as an Anomalous Object under the designation AO-697837. During routine testing, the secondary anomalous properties were discovered, thus warranting an upgrade to SCP-3741.

**Addendum 3741-B:** Test Log
The following is an abridged list of tests involving SCP-3741.

**Special Containment Procedures:** Currently, all known instances of SCP-3741 are being contained in separate salt water tanks at Site-77. The number of SCP-3741 instances in containment should not exceed fifty at any time. As such, surplus instances are to be incinerated. ##blue|Should the number of SCP-3741 instances in containment fall below ten, two instances are to be placed in a tank together for two weeks, allowing them to mate.##

As such, MTF Sigma-13 agents embedded in various national food safety regulatory bodies will routinely visit oyster farms under their jurisdiction that are known to raise eastern oysters (//Crassostrea virginica//) and are to confiscate any instances of SCP-3741 that they find.

--Under no circumstances should an instance of SCP-3741 be ingested.-- ##blue|Access to SCP-3741 is restricted by the O5 Council, and a majority vote is required for authorized usage.## Should an instance be consumed ##blue|without express permission of the O5 Council##, all responsible individuals are to be detained, interrogated, and --amnesticized-- ##blue|terminated##.

##blue|Any instances of SCP-3741-B that are not generated as a direct result of an O5 directive are to be amnesticized and issued a cover story to explain the effects of SCP-3741.##

**Description:** SCP-3741 is a phenomenon that is currently exhibited by 29 eastern oysters, but may extend to a small quantity of wild oysters. Instances can be differentiated from non-anomalous oysters due to a variety of biological traits, including functional immortality, dull pink meat, and physically identical dark shells.

Upon ingestion, SCP-3741-A will become immediately aware of an acquisition of extensive knowledge on a specific topic. The nature of this knowledge varies between instances, but is always related to the desires of the SCP-3741-A instance. See Addendum 3741-B for details.-- ##blue|upon two subjects when one of them ingests an instance. The person who ingested the SCP-3741 instance shall hereafter be referred to as SCP-3741-A, and the subsequent linked individual shall be referred to as SCP-3741-B.## 

##blue|Through a poorly understood mechanism, a metaphysical link between the consciousness of SCP-3741-A and SCP-3741-B is established upon consumption of an SCP-3741 instance. This cognitive link allows for the transfer of memories and experiences from SCP-3741-B to SCP-3741-A. The information that is transferred and the given instance of SCP-3741-B directly relate to the thoughts, desires and curiosities of SCP-3741-A at the time of ingestion, and as such, SCP-3741-A can exert a degree of control over the effects of the anomaly.##
