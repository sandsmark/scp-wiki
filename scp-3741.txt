**Special Containment Procedures:** Currently, all known instances of SCP-3741 are being contained in separate salt water tanks at Site-77. The number of SCP-3741 instances in containment should not exceed fifty at any time. As such, surplus instances are to be incinerated. 

Should any wild instances be discovered, MTF Sigma-13 ("Food Fighters") will be deployed to recover them and return to Site-77. As such, MTF Sigma-13 agents embedded in various national food safety regulatory bodies[[footnote]]Specifically, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA), and the French Agency for Food, Environmental, and Occupational Safety (ANSES).[[/footnote]] will routinely visit oyster farms under their jurisdiction that are known to raise eastern oysters (//Crassostrea virginica//) and are to confiscate any instances of SCP-3741 that they find.

Under no circumstances should an instance of SCP-3741 be ingested. Should an instance be consumed, all responsible individuals are to be detained, interrogated, and amnesticized.

**Description:** SCP-3741 is a phenomenon that is currently exhibited by 29 eastern oysters, but may extend to a small quantity of wild oysters. Instances can be differentiated from non-anomalous oysters due to a variety of biological traits, including functional immortality[[footnote]]Instances are capable of dying, but, assuming they have access to sufficient nutrients, will not die of age[[/footnote]], dull pink meat, and physically identical dark shells. Despite demonstrating the inability to age, SCP-3741 instances are capable of sexual reproduction, and are hermaphroditic like non-anomalous eastern oysters, but can only reproduce with other instances of SCP-3741.

In addition to biological deviations from non-anomalous eastern oysters, instances of SCP-3741 are known to induce a memetic effect when consumed by a subject, hereafter designated as SCP-3741-A. Upon ingestion, SCP-3741-A will become immediately aware of an acquisition of extensive knowledge on a specific topic. The nature of this knowledge varies between instances, but is always related to the desires of the SCP-3741-A instance. See Addendum 3741-B for more information.

**Addendum 3741-A:** Discovery
SCP-3741 was discovered after Foundation agents embedded in the FDA were notified of an abnormal bloom of oysters at Spat Shuckster's Oyster Farm in Kennebunkport, Maine. In response, the agents visited the farm and confiscated the oysters, logging them as an Anomalous Object under the designation AO-697837. During routine testing, the secondary anomalous properties were discovered, thus warranting an upgrade to SCP-3741.

**Addendum 3741-B:** Test Log
The following is an abridged list of tests involving SCP-3741.

As such, surplus instances are to be incinerated. ##blue|Should the number of SCP-3741 instances in containment fall below ten, two instances are to be placed in a tank together for two weeks, allowing them to mate.##

--Under no circumstances should an instance of SCP-3741 be ingested.-- ##blue|Access to SCP-3741 is restricted by the O5 Council, and a majority vote is required for authorized usage.## Should an instance be consumed ##blue|without express permission of the O5 Council##, all responsible individuals are to be detained, interrogated, and --amnesticized-- ##blue|terminated##.

##blue|Any instances of SCP-3741-B that are not generated as a direct result of an O5 directive are to be amnesticized and issued a cover story to explain the effects of SCP-3741.##

**Description:** SCP-3741 is a phenomenon that is currently exhibited by 29 eastern oysters, but may extend to a small quantity of wild oysters.

See Addendum 3741-B for details.-- ##blue|upon two subjects when one of them ingests an instance. The person who ingested the SCP-3741 instance shall hereafter be referred to as SCP-3741-A, and the subsequent linked individual shall be referred to as SCP-3741-B.## 

##blue|Through a poorly understood mechanism, a metaphysical link between the consciousness of SCP-3741-A and SCP-3741-B is established upon consumption of an SCP-3741 instance. This cognitive link allows for the transfer of memories and experiences from SCP-3741-B to SCP-3741-A. The information that is transferred and the given instance of SCP-3741-B directly relate to the thoughts, desires and curiosities of SCP-3741-A at the time of ingestion, and as such, SCP-3741-A can exert a degree of control over the effects of the anomaly.##

**Addendum 3741-A:** Discovery ##blue|and Uncontained Effects##
SCP-3741 was discovered after Foundation agents embedded in the FDA were notified of an abnormal bloom of oysters at Spat Shuckster's Oyster Farm in Kennebunkport, Maine.
