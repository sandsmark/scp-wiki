||~ Description||An anti-theft security system that stops theft and vandalism through its memetic abilities. Each security system is custom-fit to the vehicle, and provides a protective shield around the exterior to prevent damage to the vehicle. The vehicle's owner has full control over these abilities, and can authorize interactions with the vehicle to others.||

||||||||~ Initial Report||
||~ Author || Stanley Bernal ||~ Date || April 29, 2010||
||~ Interest||Medium||~ Identifier||Thalbrum Vehicle Security System||
||||||||The deal with Howard Thalbrum has been successful. I have personally looked over his blueprints, and I am convinced that his invention will make us a pretty penny. What kind of car owner doesn't worry about vandals and carjackers, after all? They will pay top dollar for this. _
 _
He already has a working prototype. I've seen it myself, it sends thoughts into potential thieves' minds that deter any attempts at stealing. I've met his son Daniel, too. Doesn't seem to have his father around a lot, actually. _
 _
Anyway, the blueprints should already be in our databases, and the prototype will be delivered to our branch in San Joaquin as soon as possible.||

||||||||~ Memo 02||
||||||||~ ZLQMK/6XY4R/V4D3R ||
||~ Sender || Amos Marshall ||~ Recipient || Stanley Bernal ||
||||||||I have received the news that Mr. Thalbrum has passed away, and left his son with the prototype. While the company still has the proper blueprints, our lab boys find it difficult to replicate the Thalbrum security system on their test cars. _
 _
Nevertheless, I've come into contact with the late Thalbrum's son, and he will transfer the prototype to us on July 24 in the parking lot of St. Everetts Memorial Hospital in Laurel Creek. Once we get our hands on this, we can finally make out some price point and demand for the security system. _
 _
Make sure the car makes it safely to us. Your job depends on it. _
 _
//-Amos Marshall// _

P.S. The Thalbrum son will join us as well, since he is now the legal owner.||

||||||||~ Incident Log 01||
||||||||~ ZLQMK/6XY4R/V4D3R||
||~ Author || Kaitlyn Cantara ||~ Date || July 24, 2010 ||
||||||||The transfer of the Thalbrum prototype did not go as planned. Operatives from the Foundation were able to intercept the meeting and take the prototype, as well as Mr. Thalbrum, to an unknown location. The agents involved wore MC&D uniforms in order to fool Mr. Thalbrum into turning over our prototype to the Foundation. _
 _
Stanley Bernal, the former project head, has been let go after this incident. ||

||||||||~ Memo 05 ||
||||||||~ ZLQMK/6XY4R/V4D3R ||
||~ Sender || Amos Marshall ||~ Recipient || William Innsbruck ||
||||||||Congratulations on your promotion, Mr. Innsbruck. While your accountant figures out how much of your bonus is taxable, I will remind you of your new duties. _
 _
The man in your position before you failed to perform a simple task: collect a prototype of a new vehicle security system. Now you must pick up where he left off, at great expense to me, the company, and the man before you, who can live off of food stamps for all I care. _
 _
The prototype is a vintage cream-tan Chevrolet sedan, accompanied by a man named Daniel Thalbrum. Both are in the custody of the Foundation, where the prototype will rot and be forgotten about, instead of turning into riches under the wheel of capitalism. Your task is to get that car back by any means necessary. You may ask me for additional resources, but keep in mind that I am an impatient man with immense political power. _
 _
Do not fail me, or you will join Bernal in the unemployment line. _

||||||||~ Memo 08 ||
||||||||~ ZLQMK/6XY4R/V4D3R ||
||~ Sender || William Innsbruck ||~ Recipient || Amos Marshall ||
||||||||I found it! I found where the Foundation is keeping our prototype! _
 _
It's at Site-48 in California. I've already sent the coordinates to you. Daniel is there too. We'll need to break him out as well, since he's the only one who can allow us to drive the prototype out of there. _
 _
I found out about this through a researcher I had to bribe, and I am happy to report that he has been successfully bought out. His name is Bradson Boudames, if you need to know. He's a great tool to find out the layout of the facility, and may have a direct line to Daniel as well. _
 _
I must admit that I'm not sure what to do next. We can sneak Daniel and the prototype out through Boudames, but by the way he describes the security, I'm not sure if that's possible without massive resources. If you'd like, I can reach out to some third-party operatives to get the job done. _
 _
Please respond quickly, Mr. Marshall. As you said, the prototype is rotting away as we speak. ||

||||||||~ Memo 09 ||
||||||||~ ZLQMK/6XY4R/V4D3R ||
||~ Sender || Amos Marshall ||~ Recipient || William Innsbruck ||
||||||||Your eagerness and sleuthing skills do not disappoint me. However, your generosity certainly does. Next time, start off with a smaller bribe amount. These costs add up quickly. _
 _
As for the retrieval, do not worry about it. I have forwarded the coordinates to a trusted organization with knowledge on the Foundation's day to day operations. With the right price, they'll retrieve anything, and with the right political leverage, we can even get a nice discount. _
 _
Once the prototype arrives, you will be in charge of it, as well as all market research. If something happens to that car, you can kiss your job goodbye. _

||||||||~ Incident Report 02||
||||||||~ ZLQMK/6XY4R/V4D3R ||
||~ Author || Bradson Boudames ||~ Date || September 02, 2010 ||
|||||||| The prototype has been successfully retrieved from the Foundation and into the possession of Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP. Formerly known as [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3763 SCP-3763], the Chevrolet Biscayne is currently with Daniel Thalbrum, and both are at the San Joaquin branch. Former Foundation doctor Bradson Boudames has also defected from the Foundation, and is offering his employment to Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP. _
 _
The operation resulted in zero casualties. Study of the item is to begin immediately.||

||||||||~ Memo 10 ||
||||||||~ ZLQMK/6XY4R/V4D3R ||
||~ Sender || Amos Marshall ||~ Recipient || Bradson Boudames ||
||||||||Welcome to your new career as a researcher for Marshall, Carter and Dark Limited Liability Partnership. My name is Amos Marshall, and I am your new boss. You will be allowed to converse with me through these memos regarding important updates and information. I understand if this is a culture shock to you, as the Foundation higher-ups do not seem to be as accessible to the average Researcher Joe. _
 _
While we appreciate your defection to our company, I must mention that your former affiliations with the Foundation will bring suspicion from your new coworkers. In order to gain our trust, you must demonstrate high levels of loyalty and gratitude to us whenever you perform research. While the use of Foundation research is a topic we cannot get into at this time, I will remind you that I have my eye on you, and so does Innsbruck. _
 _
Anyway, congratulations on your new job with us. We have a lot of work to do and a lot of money to make. _

P.S. I hope you saved your bribe money, because it will come out of your future paychecks. ||

I've been thinking of an invite-only customer base, where we'll mail letters to our long-time customers advertising this security system for their cars. However, if you have other plans, the marketing team and I will be more than happy to adopt them. ||

||||||||I received a complaint from one of our celebrity endorsers. She complained that she left her car, with our product installed on it, with some mechanics when she went on vacation. When she came back three weeks later, the mechanics didn't do any of the work because our security system prevented them from doing so. She thought that she gave them enough permission, but our security system didn't accept such an open statement as enough. _
 _
This complaint just got to me an hour ago, and I haven't responded. What should I say back, Mr. Marshall? I need an answer as soon as possible.||

||||||||Was it one of the Capistrellos that complained to you? I would expect no one else. _
 _
Simply reply back about how the complexity of the permission system is not a "flaw", it is a feature! Tell her how she can micromanage every single action and repair done with her car, therefore preventing mistakes and tampering. Our security system allows her to put more time and protection into her Mercedes G-wagon than ever before! Send her a message explaining all of this. _

||~ Sender || Bradson Boudames ||~ Recipient || William Innsbruck ||
||||||||To Innsbruck, _
 _
The recent market sabotage attempts from the Foundation prove that they still have an interest in our, um, "item". I know from previous experience that the Foundation __will__ release anomalies if they can figure out how they work. This is known as an "Explained" SCP. _
 _
I propose that we allow the Foundation to look at our item's schematics, so they can find out how it works. If they can understand the item enough to put the little "-EX" after the 3763, they will stop bothering us. _
 _
From Boudames _
 _
P.S: What should we do about Daniel Thalbrum? We don't need him or his car around, and it's always cheaper to let him fend for himself, instead of feeding him and keeping him entertained.||

------
||||||||~ Memo 29 ||
||||||||~ ZLQMK/6XY4R/V4D3R ||
||~ Sender || William Innsbruck ||~ Recipient || Amos Marshall ||
||||||||Mr. Marshall, I have bad news. _
 _
I just got a memo from Boudames suggesting that we should give up our blueprints to the Foundation. He rationalized this by talking about "explained SCPs", but I'm worried that giving up our sensitive documents to the Foundation will result in the schematics being leaked to the public. If this happens, we'll lose the market for sure. _
 _
I regret bribing him and letting him work with us. I should've known he would do something like this. _
 _
What should I do? I just got the memo, and I haven't made a response. Please answer soon.||
||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP ||
------
||||||||~ Memo 30 ||
||||||||~ ZLQMK/6XY4R/V4D3R ||
||~ Sender || Amos Marshall ||~ Recipient || William Innsbruck ||
||||||||Do not worry, Innsbruck. You were right to come to me for advice. _
 _
I looked over his memo myself, and I understand where he is coming from. While not as stubborn and ruthless as the Serpent's Hand, the Foundation will not give up on their quest for answers unless we provide them. That being said, I must agree that turning over the schematics is not the best option. It shouldn't even //be// an option. _
 _
I will deal with Bradson "Judas" Boudames. You just worry about the market. _
 _
//-Amos Marshall// _
 _
P.S. The Thalbrum son is indeed of no use to us anymore. Release him as soon as possible.||

I'm going back to the Foundation, and I'm taking Daniel with me. _
 _
It was wrong of me to defect the first time, so now I'm making it right. _

From Boudames _

P.S: The rest of the bribe money is in the San Joaquin P.O. box. I don't need it anymore.||

||~ Author || Kaitlyn Cantara ||~ Date || July 03, 2012 ||
||||||||The dead body of Daniel Thalbrum was discovered in a ditch by the side of Interstate 499. Police have ruled the cause of death as a suicide. His car was recovered in a junkyard, and contained a suicide note detailing alleged "betrayal" from Marshall, Carter and Dark. The note also mentioned a lack of any royalties for the "Thalbrum Vehicle Security System" from MC&D. _
 _
The news of his death resulted in outrage from the media, and sales of the item have dropped drastically.||

||||||||Hi everyone. My name is Kaitlyn Cantara, but you can call me Kate. I'm the new product manager for these items, personally appointed by Amos Marshall himself. _
 _
There will be a few changes to this project. First off, we will be rebranding this item from "Thalbrum Vehicle Security System" to the more fitting "MC&D Premium Vehicle Security System". This will allow us to distance ourselves from the death of Daniel Thalbrum, and hopefully see sales recover. _
 _
While you may be sad to see Innsbruck go, I must remind how necessary this move is for the health of our public relations. His lack of public empathy towards Thalbrum's death has caused a preventable PR disaster. To make up for this, we will be donating $500,000 to the Manna Charitable Foundation in Thalbrum's name. This donation must be announced publicly. _
 _
Anyway, I look forward to working side-to-side with you guys. As Marshall likes to say, we have a lot of work to do and a lot of money to make. _
 _
Sincerely, Kate Cantara||
