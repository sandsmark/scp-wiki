[[/>]]


All researchers working with [[[SCP-3636]]] should be aware of the current blacklist and take into consideration the lyrical content of any song they select. As SCP-3636 has shown the ability to select songs on its own, research is focused on gaining a better understanding of SCP-3636.

**Test Log Format:**
Experiments should be written in this form.

------


> **Test 13**
> **Song Selected:** "Have a Cigar" by Pink Floyd
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-71829 suddenly grows shoulder length hair and a thick mustache, his clothing also changes to a loosely fitting t-shirt and blue denim jeans. A yet to be identified man in a grey suit appearing to be in his mid-sixties offers D-71829 a cigar and a bottle of champagne. D-71829 accepts them and the two begin having an unheard conversation for the duration of the song. During the final notes of the song, the man in the grey suit turns into a black Fender Stratocaster commonly used by David Gilmour in live performances. 
> **Effects:** D-71829 immediately began playing the guitar. D-71829 previously displayed no musical talent or interest. D-71829 now speaks exclusively in a British accent despite being of Chilean origin.
> **Notes:** D-71829 has been held for further testing and is allowed usage of the guitar during daytime hours. D-71829 has repeatedly expressed concern that the Foundation will attempt to commercialize his music. 

> **Test 14**
> **Song Selected:** "Let Me Clear My Throat" by DJ Kool
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-94812 experiences a seemingly painful coughing fit for the entirety of the song, only stopping to cheer when the song asks the listener to "make some noise". At roughly two minutes into the song, a paper cone "party hat" materializes on D-94812's head and party balloons materialize from the ceiling. 
> **Effects:** All attempts to remove the party hat from D-94812 have failed, including surgical methods. D-94812 claims to feel incredibly healthy", and was confirmed to be in fine health after a standard checkup despite a previous checkup showing damage to several organs due to years of drug and alcohol abuse. D-94812 previously exhibited violent behavior and a rude and angry demeanor which has not been noted since the conclusion of the test. D-94812 began treating Foundation personnel with respect, and expressed a desire to "compile the ultimate party playlist" for future Foundation events.  
> **Notes:** Approval to create playlist granted. D-94812's termination has been suspended for further testing on possible long term psychological and medical benefits of SCP-3636.  

> **Test 15**
> **Song Selected:** "Regulate" by Warren G ft. Nate Dogg
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** A man appearing to be a young Warren G is seen being robbed by four African American men in modern day Long Beach, California. A man similar in appearance to Nate Dogg arrives and kills the four men. The two then find a group of women and enter a motel as the song ends.
> **Effects:** Four corpses were discovered on an abandoned lot in Long Beach. All four men were previously convicted for gang-related crimes. Women in the video were identified and remembered the events in the video. Class-B Amnestics are administered to the women involved.
> **Notes:** One woman who appeared in the video was confirmed to be pregnant, with DNA tests showing Nate Dogg as the father despite his death six years prior to the test. Warren G claimed no memory of the event after an interview.

> **Test 16** 
> **Song Selected:** "Deacon Blues" by Steely Dan
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** During the lyric "This is the day of the expanding man" D-19223 is transported into an open field outside of Malibu, California. D-19223 expands to the size of a football field. The University of Alabama Crimson Tide and a seemingly fictional team referred to as the Malibu University Deacon Blues appear on top of D-19223 and begin to play a game of football. The Crimson Tide win the game 34-7 and all players for the Deacon Blues disappear.
> **Effects:**  D-19223 died of multiple organ failure immediately after the song ended. University of Alabama team was found confused, searching for help 3 miles from D-19233's corpse.  
> **Notes:**  Amnestics distributed to all members of the University of Alabama football team as well as nearby residents who witnessed the event. D-19223's body was destroyed and a story about a brush fire used as a cover.

> **Test 17**
> **Song Selected:** "You Suffer" by Napalm Death
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** A close up of D-17891's face as they experience extreme pain immediately after selecting the song.
> **Effects:** D-17891 confirmed that she felt extreme pain for the song's full 1.316 second duration that immediately subsided afterwards. 
> **Notes:** No long term anomalous effects apparent after a standard Foundation medical examination of D-17891.   

> **Test 18**
> **Song Selected:** "Ladies Night" by Kool and the Gang
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** SCP-3636 disappears from containment at the same time as 4 female researchers at Site 17. 
> **Effects:** SCP-3636 found with the missing researchers in a pink 1979 Chrsyler Cordoba parked outside of a club in Jersey City, New Jersey. SCP-3636 was discovered in the driver's seat of the car wearing a long silver dress with mascara and lipstick applied to its touch screen. All 4 researchers were in similar attire and noticeably intoxicated. The researchers claimed to have "partied all night" with SCP-3636.
> **Notes:** SCP-3636 added song to favorites. Further research is suggested to see if SCP-3636 continues to treat itself as female in future tests.

> **Test 19**
> **Song Selected:** "Pisces" by Jinjer
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-1879 is turned into an adult Northern Pike in SCP-3636's containment cell, after briefly laying on the floor she appears in Ukraine's Dnieper river. She swims for the duration of the song before being caught by a fisherman who proceeds to cook and eat the fish during the final minute of the song.
> **Effects:** No traces of D-1879 could be found. Fisherman depicted in video was eventually located and displayed no anomalous effects. 
> **Notes:** Researchers have suggested that SCP-3636 may have difficulties understanding complex metaphors. 

> **Test 20**
> **Song Selected:** "The Camera Eye" by Rush
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-12281's eyes are transformed into camera lenses. D-12281's  veins and arteries temporarily become visible under her skin and are slowly replaced with what appear to be XLR cables. D-12281's fingers change in shape and coloration to appear similar to standard cardioid microphones. At roughly 3 minutes in the song, D-12281 appears in midtown Manhattan and begins to spy on citizens, apparently unseen. Later in the song, D-12281's location changes to a busy area of downtown London.   
> **Effects:** D-11281 was eventually located in London and returned to Foundation custody. Amnestics distributed to affected neighborhood as a cautionary measure. 
> **Notes:** Surgical analysis of D-11281 is pending.

> **Test 21**
> **Song Selected:** "Endless Forms Most Beautiful" by Nightwish
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** No effects independently observed. Video starts with a microscopic shot of what seems to be a colony of primordial organisms before quickly zooming out, and presumably accelerating time, to reveal a seabed populated by numerous species of arthropod-analogues, similar to those associated with Earth's Cambrian Period. View then zooms to many areas of an undocumented Earth-like planet, occasionally accelerating time to showcase the evolution of life on the world. Video ends showing a tribe of hominid-analogues, focusing on one which repeatedly strikes two rocks together, seemingly to observe the resultant sparks.
> **Effects:** No persistent effects can be observed at this time. However, the continued existence of the planet shown in the video or life on it cannot be ruled out. 
> **Notes:** "This one isn't quite blacklisted, but further testing with it will require O5 approval." -Dr. Sutherland

> **Test 22**
> **Song Selected:** "Song of Beren and Lúthien", by Aragorn, son of Arathorn. 
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** The "Live Music Video" banner did not appear. Video depicted an individual resembling actor Viggo Mortensen singing acapella as a serenade to an unknown, non-human individual, apparently female. The first individual is noted to have grey eyes and a more athletic build than Mortenson, and the female has pointed ears and is very pale. At the end of the video, the pair share a kiss.
> **Effects:** Following playback, search engines recorded a spike in searches for "Beren and Lúthien", and other terms related to //The Lord of the Rings// and J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth. Beyond this, no effects have been observed.

> **Test 23**
> **Song Selected:** "4'33", by John Cage
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** Screen displayed static for duration of the song.
> **Effects:** All sound within test chamber was nullified.
> **Notes:** So I guess it doesn't really qualify as instrumental? Maybe SCP-3636 "imagined" it being performed by a singer? -Dr. N█████

> **Test 24**
> **Song Selected:** "Devoured by Vermin", by Cannibal Corpse
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-27542 immediately disappeared from site, and reappeared on video in an undisclosed location. Various vermin is shown approaching him on ground, and various insects are shown approaching in the air. Subject appears to have the powers possesed by the current host of SCP-027. 33 seconds into the song, subject is completely covered by vermin, and is not seen for the rest of the video. More vermin continues to approach for the duration of the video.
> **Effects:** Subject found in V████, Liechtenstein 4 hours after the SCP-3636-1 event. Subject found completely covered in vermin. Subject terminated. 
> **Notes:** Song added to blacklist.

> **Test 25**
> **Song Selected:** "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-29234 vanishes, and is shown on video at the London underpass where a portion of the song's official video was filmed. He is dressed in Astley's outfit from that shoot- a tan longcoat over a black shirt and slacks. He sings the lyrics to a blonde woman standing next to him, while performing dance moves similar to Astley's. The woman responds positively to his affections, and at the end of the video, D-29234 sweeps her into his arms.
> **Effects:** D-29234 is found at the same underpass with his head in his hands, weeping openly and muttering "she looked just like her". The woman depicted in the video is found several blocks away. When interviewed by personnel, she reports that D-29234 broke down inconsolably at the exact moment the song finished. The woman and all other witnesses to the SCP-3636-1 event are given Class-A amnestics.
> **Notes:** D-29234 had a prior conviction for the murder of an ex-girlfriend, who was similar in appearance to the woman depicted in the SCP-3636-1 event. Based on its past behavior, it is believed that SCP-3636 was acting out of a terribly misguided sense of kindness.

> **Test 26**
> **Song Selected:** “Ode to a Superhero” by Weird Al Yankovic
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** The video appeared in the form of a montage depicting re-enactments of various events from the 2002 film adaptation of Spider-Man, as described in the song. While all extras and background characters were portrayed by actual, contemporary residents of New York City, all principal characters which appeared in the montage were portrayed by exact duplicates of their respective actors as they appeared during the time period that the movie was filmed in.
> **Effects:** Amnestics distributed to witnesses and non-anomalous participants. The Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, and Rosemary Harris duplicates (as well as the cadavers of the Cliff Robertson and Willem Dafoe duplicates) were located and taken into Foundation custody. Medical testing confirmed them to be genetically identical to the original actors, and interviews revealed that both individuals had memories corresponding to the character they portrayed (Mary Jane Watson and Harry Osborne, respectively) and believed themselves to be that character. A search for the individuals corresponding to the other principal characters is still ongoing, and it is not yet known if the duplicate of Tobey Maguire possesses the same anomalous abilities as his character.
> **Notes:** An accidental second selection of this song caused the duplicates to revert to the same physical states and locations as in the beginning of the first music video, after which they re-enacted all the same events exactly identically. The specimens within Foundation custody show no memory of having gone through these same events twice.
> //"It's only been, what, a few days? I'm sure he'll turn up soon enough. A real live Spiderman would be hard to miss." --Researcher Lee//

> **Test 27**
> **Song Selected:** “Woodpecker No.1” by Merzbow
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-21512 vanishes, and is seen in the video. The video consists of an abandoned, dirty room with windows and television displaying several flashing colors and bright and oversaturated imagery. D-21512 is seen in some of the imagery. 
> **Effects:** The room was found in [REDACTED], however D-21512 was never found. The television in the room was taken for investigation.

> **Test 28**
> **Song Selected:** "Call Me Maybe" by Carly Rae Jepsen
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** Assistant Researcher Thompson is showed dressed in similar clothing that Carly Rae Jepsen wore in the music video. Agent Hendricks was also present, and was assisting Assistant Researcher Thompson who was observing him from behind fanning herself nervously. They converse and Assistant Researcher Thompson hands a folded piece of paper to Agent Hendricks before quickly leaving.
> **Effects:** Interview with Assistant Researcher Thompson confirmed that she was attracted to Agent Hendricks, and wanted to be in communication with him but was anxious. Both have memories of the interaction, and Agent Hendricks had the folded paper in his pocket. On it was the personal phone number of Assistant Researcher Thompson.
> **Notes:** A second viewing showed a pair of different individuals, and they were depicted in similar circumstances. Both of the individuals were identified and recalled their interaction, though they initially thought it was a dream. SCP-3636 has also added the song into its favorites.

> **Test 29**
> **Song Selected:** "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" by Daft Punk
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** The creation process of members from Mobile Task Force Tau-5 ("Samsara") is displayed.
> **Effects:** The newly made clones had the most recent memories of Tau-5 and expressed confusion. It was reported that Tau-5 who was stationed at [REDACTED] collapsed and ceased all functions. Cause is currently unknown.

> **Test 30**
> **Song Selected:** “Flamingo” by Kero Kero Bonito
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-20357 disappeared for the duration of this test. The display showed her within the Site-17 cafeteria, sitting at a table. In front of her was a large bowl of raw shrimp, which she proceeded to eat in its entirety. Other personnel were present in the cafeteria at the time, but seemed to not notice D-20357. Over the course of the video, D-20357’s skin gradually becomes a bright pink hue. 
> **Effects:** D-20357’s skin remained the pink hue after the test ended. Analysis of her skin showed large amounts of carotenoids present. Despite this, D-20357 showed no negative effects from the large amount of shrimp consumed.

> **Test 31**
> **Song Selected:** “I’d Do Anything For Love (But I Won’t Do That)” by Meat Loaf with Patti Russo
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** Staff Sergeant Julia “Jinxie” Penlan, assigned to base security and not previously aware of SCP-3636’s anomalous properties, disappears from SCP-3636’s containment room. On SCP-3636’s screen, SSgt Penlan reappears in a hallway at Site-██ standing next to a similarly relocated Doctor Gerald.
> **Effects:** [DATA EXPUNGED]. Complete loss of Site-██ and all assigned personnel via massive containment breach of several Keter-class entities, requiring the last resort emergency detonation of Site-██’s nuclear warhead. Unusual in being one of the few SCP-3636-1 events to employ the interscene diegetic trope, where the events at Site-██ are interspersed with scenes of singers Meat Loaf and Patti Russo in a hitherto unreleased live studio recording session from 2013. 
> **Notes:** Staff Sergeant Penlan and Dr Gerald survived the mass containment breach and subsequent total loss of Site-██, having made their escape riding tandem on a motorcycle from the site’s motor pool and barely managing to clear the blast radius. Neither party was previously acquainted with the other, nor had they ever been assigned to or visited Site-██ prior to its destruction. Song has been recommended for blacklist.

> **Test 32**
> **Song Selected:** "Super Mario Bros. Theme (Ground)" by Koji Kondo
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** The video showed 80% of personnel at [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/secure-facility-dossier-site-77 |Site-77]]] dancing to the rhythm of the song, and then personnel heading to the site cafeteria and consuming their supply of mushrooms.
> **Effects:** Due to the lack of watch on several SCP items, there was a high-level breach at Site-77. All personnel below level 4 clearance were given amnestics.
> **Notes:** Song added to SCP-3636's blacklist, along with Site Director Gillespie issuing punishment for the personnel who played this on SCP-3636.

> **Test 33**
> **Song Selected:** "Act 1 Scene 1 - Regression" by Dream Theater 
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** After the introduction of the song, D-21928 vanishes and is shown in the music video lying in a therapy office, where he begins vocalizing the words in the song. After the song ends, the rest of the album begins playing with no way of stopping it. The video continues to portray the entire album in its original sequence.
> **Effects:** Just before the album finishes, D-21928 is killed by the same therapist from the beginning as he says "Open your eyes, Nicholas". SCP-3636's screen only shows static after the final song ends. D-21928 does not return, and the whereabouts of the location of his teleportation is unknown.
> **Notes:** Lyrical and story research on the full album that this song originated lines up with the scenes shown in the music video with D-21928. Any attempt to start the album from one of the tracks in the middle forces the first song to play.

> **Test 34**
> **Song Selected:** "PokéRap" by 4Kids Entertainment
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** Music video follows an identical format to the PokéRap's actual music video, however, all named Pokemon are replaced with SCP objects roughly equivalent to the creature in question. For example, #006 ("Charizard") shows SCP-1762, #052 ("Meowth") shows SCP-529, #97 ("Hypno") shows SCP-4666, #130 ("Gyarados") shows SCP-169 and #149 ("Dragonite") shows SCP-682. In the chorus, various staff members from Site-17 are shown attempting to "catch" (contain) the objects in question.
> **Effects:** A massive containment breach occurred as the music video was playing. Full containment re-established after 42 hours. 
> **Notes:** Song added to SCP-3636's blacklist.

> **Test 35**
> **Song Selected:** "Prayer of the Refugee" by Rise Against
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-38452 disappears and is shown in an unidentified superstore. D-38452 begins pacing down aisles, lip-syncing to the song, consistent to the original music video, while multiple customers and staff of Hispanic and Arabic descent are shown assuming a prayer position respective to their religions for the duration of the event.
> **Effects:** D-38452 was later discovered at a local Wal-Mart in ███████, ██ and was returned to Foundation custody. All customers and staff present during the event were questioned, amnestized, and released. All video surveillance footage of the event were taken by Foundation personnel and wiped from the store's records.
> **Notes:** During questioning, the individuals shown praying during the event were identified as legal immigrants who moved to America in search of employment.

> **Test 36**
> **Song Selected:** "Megalovania" by Toby Fox
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** The object's screen is black for 5 seconds before a female voice says "That song has been overplayed, choose again", before the screen returns to song selection.
> **Effects:** None
> **Notes:** This is the second time that SCP-3636 has denied playing a song, though this time indirectly. More testing is required.- Dr. F███████

> **Test 37**
> **Song Selected:** "Veteran of the Psychic Wars" by Blue Oyster Cult
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:**  An unidentified woman wearing a Foundation ID is shown standing in an elevator. The ID is smeared with blood and the name cannot be read. She is below average height and appears to be roughly 50 years in age. She is carrying what appears to be an energy weapon of unknown make or origin. The elevator opens to an empty, featureless corridor with what appears to be an airlock at the end of the corridor. At 2 minutes and 12 seconds into the song the woman enters the airlock. D-39338 and all observing researchers are unable to recount the events of the remaining 2 minutes and 38 seconds of the song.
> **Effects:** D-72338 and the observing researchers all show signs of having been affected by an unknown cognitohazard.
> **Notes:** No record of a woman matching the description of the woman observed in the first 2 minutes 12 seconds of the video could be found in Foundation personnel records. The elevator contained signage indicating that it was within Foundation Site 41, but no record of any such site could be found.

> **Test 38**
> **Song Selected:** "Promise" by Kohmi Hirose
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-72339 is shown re-enacting the events of the music video until the chorus at which point D-72339 is shown rapidly spinning. The spinning continues throughout the chorus, pausing briefly in the 3rd and 7th lines of the chorus where D-72339 sways their hips. After the chorus D-72339 resumes re enactment of the music video.
> **Effects** After the music stops D-72339 collapses and is taken to the infirmary where X-ray scans show breaks in most joints of D-72339.

> **Test 39**
> **Song Selected:** "Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)" by Journey
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-45383 is shown on a planet █████ in an 80's rock themed space suit, crying out for who can be assumed to be a previous lover.  As the video continues, D-45383 is shown to progressively age and show more and more signs of depression and by the outro is now old, nearing 90 years old and has given up on singing and has just simply been crying.  With the last two words being "No, no!" the now old man is shown screaming and crying into the sky.
> **Effects:** D-45383 is yet to be recovered nor was the disappearance shown on the cameras, as the cameras in his cell disconnected for 7 seconds.
> **Notes:** The cameras disconnecting had no long term effects on their performance.

> **Test 40**
> **Song Selected:** "The Entertainment's Here" by AJR
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-62884 disappears from the testing chamber and is shown in a bedroom. They are seen lying on the bed with their eyes closed, lip-syncing the lyrics of the song, with the viewer's perspective positioned approximately one foot above their face. A digital alarm clock on a nightstand next to the bed goes off, presumably playing the song. D-62884 leaves the bed and exits the bedroom, and is suddenly in an outdoor area, lying on the ground. When the chorus of the song hits, D-62884 jumps into a standing position and a crowd of people suddenly appear, some holding instruments and pretending to play them, mimicking the song, while others lip-sync the lyrics. At the next portion of the song, D-62884 is shown in a diner eating a cheeseburger and drinking a milkshake. D-62884 leaves the items on the counter and exits the diner, reappearing in Las Vegas, Nevada. D-62884 is holding an empty wallet, which they toss behind them. Moments later, D-62884's head bursts, and their headless corpse falls to the ground, staying there for the rest of the video. When the chorus starts for the second and final time, the same crowd from before, with a few additional members, reappear from outside of the now stationary viewpoint, performing the same actions as before. Balloons and confetti appear from above and fall upon the crowd slowly. When the video ends, all members of the crowd, except those from Las Vegas, leave the viewpoint and disappear.
> **Effects:** D-62884 and the remaining members of the crowd were found in Las Vegas, Nevada. D-62884 was still deceased. The remaining crowd members and all other known witnesses were given amnestics, and the blood, corpse, confetti, and balloons were cleaned up.
> **Notes:** SCP-3636 added song to favorites.

> **Test 41**
> **Song Selected:** "Two-Headed Boy" by Neutral Milk Hotel
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-59394 appeared to instantaneously age backwards to a pre-adolescent state, followed by the growth of a second head extending from his neck. D-59394 is shown dancing in a field of white roses with a young girl matching the appearance of Annelies Frank. Neutral Milk Hotel singer Jeff Mangum appears in several scenes throughout the video, playing guitar and singing beside D-59394 and the girl.
> **Effects:** D-59394 passed several vision, hearing, and psychological tests, despite possessing extraneous sensory organs. Personality now matches that of an average pre-adolescent, and scans seem to indicate that the subject's two brains function identically with no complications. Subject placed in containment for further study. The girl shown in the video has not been located.
> **Notes:** Jeff Mangum was found in the containment cell of SCP-3636, clutching his guitar and sobbing quietly. Following a week-long period of testing for anomalies, subject was amnesticized and released.

> **Test 42**
> **Song Selected:** "Whip A Tesla" by Yung Gravy & bbno$
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-68319 disappeared after the 3 second mark in the song. D-68319 immediately reappeared inside of a Tesla Model X, along with the 2 creators of the song. Many female D-class were observed getting out of the car.
> **Effects:** D-68319 began to call himself "Piper Johnny" and continues to call himself by the name. The 2 musicians had no memory of the event. D-68319 passed all physical and psychological tests.
> **Notes:** Further requests for the song result in SCP-3636 stating "Piper Johnny ain't pipin' no more."

> **Test 43**
> **Song Selected:** "Blinding Lights" by The Weeknd
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-78912 was instantly obliterated by highly bright lights. All staff within a 3 meter radius disintegrated immediately. At the end of the song, SCP-3636's cell appeared normal. 
> **Effects:** D-78912 and 13 staff perished in the event. Song added to blacklist.
> **Notes:** Never add songs with those kinds of titles again, you buffoons. - Dr. Crisento

> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** The item's screen stayed blank, after 5 seconds a female voice said "Now this is what I call music!" 40 foundation sites are effected. Look below for effects.
> **Effects:** 2,124 personnel are hospitalized due to the music cracking their bones, these bones flew at unaffected personnel. An event occurred in which broken bones from Site-91 flew an estimated 19202 kilometers, arriving a week later smashing all of Site-45's windows.
> **Notes:** Song added to blacklist.

> **Test 45**
> **Song Selected:** "People are Strange" by The Doors
> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** [DATA EXPUNGED]
> **Effects:** [DATA EXPUNGED]. See SCP-001 for details.
> **Notes:** Song added to blacklist by order of the 05 Council.
