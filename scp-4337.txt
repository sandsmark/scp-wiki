**Item #:** SCP-4337

**Object Class:** --Thaumiel-- Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4337 is to be stored in a standard containment locker at Site-59. Testing through Procedure 10-Inti may be carried out through an application to the site director, Dr. Lisle Naismith. Blank applications may be found at the Site-59 safe wing receptionist's desk. Test subjects may only be pulled from available D-class personnel that have been scheduled for termination.

**Description:** SCP-4337 is a fixed-blade combat knife, 38 cm in length. A sand-engraved decal of three crescent moons is present on either side of the blade.

Through Procedure 10-Inti, SCP-4337 can cause an e-mailed form letter to appear in the inbox of the surviving participant after two hours. Due to the triple-crescent motif being analogous to other objects in Foundation custody (including [[[SCP-3319]]] and [[[SCP-3922]]]), the message is believed to be extradimensional in origin.

**Recovery Log:** On 12/21/2018, the location of the original instance of SCP-4337 was relayed to the Foundation in an e-mail from [[[SCP-2578]]]-D, on the grounds that the object's original owners were "senile cultists" that had been "using the device to make libelous claims."

SCP-4337 was recovered by Foundation Agents in a house in ██████████, Missouri. All three residents had been shot from orbit by SCP-2578-D ten hours prior to discovery; their bodies had not yet been found by local authorities. Seven adult corpses were discovered in the basement; cause of death had been sharp force trauma to the heart.

Documents recovered alongside SCP-4337 led to the formation of Procedure 10-Inti:

# One D-class subject ("Participant") is to be given a question by a second party ("Celebrant")
# Immediately after, the celebrant is to stab the participant in the heart.

The resulting message will attempt to answer the question.
