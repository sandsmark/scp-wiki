++++ NOTICE FROM GOI-386 R&I LEAD
   
Hello! If you're reading this, it is because you've got a certain level of experience with the weirder things the Foundation deals with, know a thing or two about thaumaturgy, are knowledgeable on spatial anomalies, or Director Aktus doesn't like you.

Either way, welcome to the Dr. Wondertainment Research and Investigation Department! Please read through the following dossier, as it will teach you a lot about what you're in for. There is no quiz, but I do like having an informed team at my disposal. 

Enjoy your transfer!
- Dr. Everwood

**Location of Interest:** Wonder World 

**Group of Interest Number:** 386

**AKAs:** WW, "The Workshop"[[footnote]] As given by the Serpent's Hand. [[/footnote]], "Wonka's"[[footnote]] As given by the Global Occult Coalition. [[/footnote]], "Kiddyland"[[footnote]] As given by the Unusual Incidents Unit. [[/footnote]]

**Threat Level:** Orange 

**Assigned Task Force:** MTF Alpha-98 "Focus Testers"

**Location Description:** Wonder World is a vast spatial anomaly containing a city of the same name (Wonder World!™[[footnote]] Pronounced 'Wonder World, Tee Emm' [[/footnote]]), various industrial parks, research facilities, housing developments, schools, a university, and the headquarters of Dr. Wondertainment. 

Though the demographics of Wonder World are largely unknown, the current population is estimated at around 15,000 (c. 2014). Various testimonies, as well as evidence from captured subjects, suggest the anomalous properties of the area alter the appearance of its human residents over time. A baseline human will, over the course of their life, experience minor changes such as the pigment of the hair, skin, or eyes into non-natural colors, amplification in the size of the eyes, etc. These alterations appear to amplify over generations and will become more extreme, including mutations such as the growth of additional limbs, elongation of the neck, prehensile tails, etc.

The culture of Wonder World revolves around the concept of  "Wondermaking", the belief that one's goal in life is to seek fulfillment in 'making the world a Wonderful place.' Though its calendar system overlaps with major commercial holidays (Black Friday, Christmas, Boxing Day, etc.), and displays many similarities to the Gregorian system, the Wonder Calendar observes years in Wonder Years. The founding of the Dr. Wondertainment company is considered year 0 in this system.

Typical education curriculums involve the history of the Wondertainment brand and its lines of products, Economics[[footnote]] With a focus on capitalism. [[/footnote]], Marketing, Anart History, Thaumaturgy, Thaumatology, Psionics, Craftsmanship, and Studies of the Mundane. Though most citizens complete several years of internships and work studies before being hired by the Dr. Wondertainment Company, employment is not compulsory.

The Foundation has been aware of the existence of Wonder World since 1935 but were not able to reliably investigate the location until 2006.
