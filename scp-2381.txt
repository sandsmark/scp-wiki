**Item #:** SCP-2381

**Object Class:** Keter 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2381 is currently uncontained; reported outbreaks are to be quarantined immediately. Key security personnel in local and national governments are to be briefed on new outbreaks, as they have allotted resources and cooperation to Foundation containment teams.

All samples of SCP-2381 are to be stored in a hermetically sealed, BSL-4 cryoprotective freezer. Samples are to be cultured using YEPD[[footnote]]Yeast extract peptone dextrose, the standard culture medium for growth of //Saccharomyces cerevisiae//.[[/footnote]] medium. All work with the organism is to take place under BSL-4 conditions inside a single facility within Block-D of Site 234. Personnel are required to wear 2 layers of BSL-4 protective equipment, and 1 layer of protective undergarments including a biohazard air filter. Personnel exiting this facility are to undergo 4 screening checkpoints. These checkpoints are composed of the following measures:

* Multistep decontamination of the first layer of protective gear. 
* Removal of the first layer of protective gear, and multi-step decontamination of the secondary layer of protective gear. 
* Removal of second layer of protective gear, incineration of both first and second layers. Multi-step decontamination of distributed undergarments. 
* Removal and incineration of undergarments, followed by a multi-step sterilization cycle, a standard rinsing shower, and blood test screening. 

Personnel should completely avoid physical contact and aerosol exposure with the entity.

In the event of an accidental infection event, checkpoints are to be hermetically sealed, and individuals within the facility analyzed for stage 1 symptoms. Individuals exhibiting these symptoms are to be informed, and offered standard termination benefits.[[footnote]]Including standard life insurance and college tuition payment plans for any children under 23.[[/footnote]] Regardless of the response, termination should occur after diagnosis. At this time, there are no treatments for infection. Should a treatment be discovered; these procedures will be reviewed and modified as needed.

In the event of an outbreak, MTFs Chi-7 ("Plague tamers") and Beta-7 ("Maz Hatters") are to be deployed and establish standard quarantine procedures. Infected individuals should be terminated upon diagnosis. Affected areas are to undergo "salting"[[footnote]] Meaning that assigned MTF units are to spread large quantities of sodium-chloride on all surfaces.[[/footnote]] and SCP-2381-1 instances removed using slash and burn tactics. Quarantine operations are to be masked by disinformation units as outbreaks of well known non-anomalous pathogens. Media referring to or depicting an outbreak is to be intercepted, and altered, non-foundation personnel aware of the anomaly are to be treated with Class-B amnestics.

**Update SCP-2381-P-2** As of 6/28/2016, individuals in stages 1 and 2 of infection are to be  placed in an anechoic chamber with an interior lead lined wall, and administered Amphotericin B until infection is cleared. At this time, it is believed that SCP-2381-2 is responsible for the appearance and infections by SCP-2381 (See Addendum 1). Research into methods of neutralization for SCP-2381-2 are ongoing.

**Description:** SCP-2381 is a previously undiscovered strain of //Saccharomyces cerevisiae//. SCP-2381 is a BSL-4 human pathogen[[footnote]] This is in stark contrast to other strains of //Saccharomyces cerevisiae// which serves as a commensal organism in most humans.[[/footnote]] and is indistinguishable from non-anomalous strains until infection. The organism is extremely contagious, spreading through infected body fluids, direct physical contact, aerial spores, and aerosolized particles. A single cell is responsible for the initiation of infection, and does so when it comes into physical contact with skin or the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract. 

When the organism makes physical contact with a host, its morphology will shift from the rounded shape characteristic of yeasts to a series of multi-nucleated fibers.[[footnote]]Known as hyphae, this is atypical of most strains of commensal yeast. Some are capable of forming pseudo-hyphae, but most remain as single cells or loose multi-cellular associations.[[/footnote]] Once it has shifted morphology, it will exhibit behavior similar to that of the opportunistic pathogen //Candida albicans//. 

SCP-2381 grows at an accelerated rate, and does so by converting host cells around it into new fibers.[[footnote]] The hyphae strands do this by drilling into the host cells plasma membrane, penetrating small outbranches into the interior. Once inside, the branches will begin secreting a large number of enzymes and proteins of uknown function which completely convert the cell on both the genetic and physical levels into a new SCP-2381 cell. [[/footnote]] The organism will also double once every 30 minutes[[footnote]]Far faster than any other fungi[[/footnote]], amplifying the spread of infection over a short period of time. Because of its mechanism of disease, the immune system of the host is destroyed within the first 5 hours of infection.[[footnote]]Due to the need for direct physical contact with specific receptors to initiate a response.[[/footnote]]

SCP-2381 emits and receives a number of vibrational wavelengths commonly associated with radio transmissions, primarily at 900 mHz (See Addendum 1). Analysis of these transmissions has revealed a number of details about SCP-2381's origins and a possible person/entity of interest, hereby dubbed as SCP-2381-2, responsible for the creation and propagation of the pathogen.

All SCP-2381 infections occur in 5 stages, over the course of 12-48 hours. All 5 stages are described as being incredibly painful for the host.[[footnote]]Due to the cellular, tissue, and organ damage caused by the increasing network of hyphae flowing through their body[[/footnote]] All infections terminate with the emergence and full development of a "Toadstool"[[footnote]]Which is structurally analogous to a variety of fruiting bodies from members of //Basidiomycota//[[/footnote]] from the host's reproductive system. The resulting "Toadstool" ranges from 9-50 m in height, with a stalk 1-13 m in width, and a spore producing structure 3-20 m in diameter. These structures, hereby dubbed SCP-2381-1, emit aerial spores at a constant frequency consistent with most multi-cellular fungi, however; unlike other multicellular fungi, the fruiting body never rots and continues releasing spores for an indeterminate duration.  In addition to the fruiting body, at the end of stage 5 the former host's remaining extracellular protein matrices will dissolve, releasing a dense network of hyphae[[footnote]]Known as a mycelium.[[/footnote]] which will embed itself into the surface it falls on, regardless of composition.

**Stages**
++++++ Stage 1
Stage 1 of infection begins when an SCP-2381 cell makes contact with exposed skin, or a spore is inhaled. Initially, conversion events remain localized to a small area. Hyphae begin to spread outwards, and a visible lesion, usually 3-4 mm in diameter, will appear. This lesion is described as being hard and scaly, consistent with the chitinous walls of the fungal cells. At this time infected persons will begin experiencing sharp pains in the affected area as the infection begins converting sensory nerve cells within the tissue layer.

++++++ Stage 2

Stage 2 begins when infection penetrates beyond the initial layer of tissue, while still spreading outwards. For skin surface infections, this usually involves penetration into muscle or fat layers. For upper respiratory infections, this means penetration into epithelial tissue, including blood vessels. Stage 2 results in restricted muscle movements, loss of feeling in specific regions, decrease in respiratory ability, and may result in coughing spells with aersolized SCP-2381 fibers.

++++++ Stage 3

Stage 3 begins when the infection penetrates into the major organ systems, or the bones in infected limbs. At this point, an entire limb has usually been converted into hyphae filaments, with sensory nerves either partially or completely converted. Infected individuals will enter shock as infection progresses into major organs and other deep tissues. Infected individuals may begin screaming histyerically as well as exhibiting several common symptoms including vomiting, blood laced coughs, uncontrollable bowel movements, and loss of consciousness.

++++++ Stage 4

At the beginning of stage 4 infection has spread to all major organs on some level. 10-20% conversion of these tissues is common. Infection spreads across all epidermal tissues and mucous membranes, leaving the skin hard to the touch with a coat of excreted slime.[[footnote]]This slime is a mixture of protease's which break down the extracellular matrices that hold together cells in human tissues and organs.[[/footnote]] Infected hosts remain conscious and aware throughout this process, with a spike in awareness during the conversion of the eyes and tongue.

Near the end of stage 4, infected individuals possessing a penis and testes will experience painful swelling, bulging, and stretching of the appendage, as the glans penis and corona glandis blossom outwards taking on the shape of a "toadstool" from //Basidiomycota//. The urethral opening seals, and the blossoming structures begin developing infantile spore producing structures. This process is similar in individuals possessing a functional vagina-cervix-uterus, however the clitoral glans is forced to merge with the urethral and vaginal openings, as the fruiting body develops. 

++++++ Stage 5
Stage 5, compared to stage's 3 and 4, is short. Most major organs have been converted, with the exception of the brain, and infection is present in virtually all deep tissues. Stage 5 mostly concerns the development of the fruiting body as it continues to grow from the host's reproductive system, and the conversion of the host's remaining nervous tissue. Infected individuals are often conscious well into Stage 5, but are no longer able to vocalize. Individuals exhibit rapid memory loss and dementia as infection progresses. Ultimately, stage 5 ends with the full maturation of the fruiting body, and the dissolution of any remaining extracellular protein structures holding the mycelium into a human shape.

SCP-2381 was initially reported in the city of Lourdes, France, by an embedded member of MTF-Chi-7. The initial outbreak began when a well known local vineyard owner was brought into the district's medical center, showing signs now known to be consistent with Stage 1 of infection. The embedded agent alerted research personnel at Site-234 when the infection spread to the attending physicians. At this time, Site-234 directional staff notified MTF-Beta-7 and the O5 council of the developing situation, and Elements of MTF Beta-7 were deployed to establish large scale quarantine protocols given Lourdes status as a tourist/pilgrimage hotspot. By the time they arrived in the city, infection had spread to the resident and tourist populations. An estimated 50,000 individuals succumbed to infection, including the embedded agent. An estimated ███ persons who were exposed to aerial spores were not quarantined due to miscomunnications between MTF-Beta-7 operatives and the Quarantine Protocol Director present.  At the end of the outbreak, MTF Beta-7 noted the heavy concentration of SCP-2381-1 instances within the urban area, especially in the streets.[[footnote]]Described by Beta-7 operatives as "A literal forest of shrooms."[[/footnote]]

As of 12/15/2015, █ active outbreaks are currently under quarantine. Cases are all believed to be linked to the initial outbreak, with a number of small outbreaks still emerging in several regions. MTF-Beta-7's quarantine protocol director is to undergo internal review before the ethics committee for her failure to properly contain the anomaly during the initial outbreak.

**Addendum 1: SCP-2381-2**

On 6/28/2016, personnel from MTF-Beta-7 and MTF-Chi-7 maintaining an SCP-2381 quarantine zone, in █████████, China, notified requisition officers of faulty/malfunctioning radio equipment. Operatives complained of random interference, sudden and sometimes painful high pitched tones, in addition to nausea and unease.[[footnote]] Normal symptoms of exposed and extremely concentrated Electromagnetic fields emanating from electronic equipment.[[/footnote]] Investigation of the malfunctioning equipment away from the Quarantine zone concluded that the transceivers were functioning correctly, however; when returned to the mobile task force units, the previously described issues resumed. 

Foundation research personnel were subsequently deployed into the quarantine zone to locate the source of the interference, believing it to be caused by some undiscovered geographical anomaly. Researchers discovered, utilizing frequency scanning equipment, that SCP-2381-1 instances were in fact the source of the interference. The structures were characterized as emitting and receiving transmissions at a frequency of 900 mHz, interfering with the table top transmitters along the perimeter of the quarantine zones. Transmissions, as previously described, consisted of a series of extended high pitch tones occurring at 30 minute intervals. Inquiry by lingual and radio transmission experts were able to discern a series of communications in french between SCP-2381 and, at the time, an unknown entity, now known to be SCP-2381-2. Examples of these communications are recorded below.[[footnote]] Note, translations are based on a rough interpretation, as many words and sentences from the original slowed down recordings are random and have no logical connotation in human thought.[[/footnote]]

> SCP-2381-1 Instance: Mother! We do spread well! Many of the stalkless have sacrificed to fulfill your vision! 
> 
> Unknown: My spores, my fibers twitch in pride. Soon it will be stalks, and not the detritus of the floor that towers above the stalkless! Tell me, do you hear the call of your brothers and sisters who I first gave life to above?

Transmissions in the █████████ area ceased after this exchange.

On 8/2/2016 Foundation radio transmission experts were able to trace the origin point of the transmissions received by SCP-2381-1 instances, utilizing advanced Doppler readouts, to Lourdes, France, the origin point of the pathogen. Further investigation using seismic imaging technology identified an enormous subterranean fungal system covering more than 20 sq. Km underneath the town, and stretching beneath the Pyrenee mountains.
