**Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1000 is to be kept in a Level-4 Biosecure greenhouse at Site-██. All interactions with SCP-1000 are to be carried out by D-Class personnel, including feeding. Each specimen is to be fed three (3) large Norway rats (//Rattus norvegicus//) per week. As SCP-1000 is immobile, no further containment procedures have been deemed necessary. 

**Description:** SCP-1000 is a species of highly carnivorous tree, located primarily in high-precipitation areas between 10° north and 10° south. All known specimens range from 1 to 3 meters in height, and feature a number of vine-like tentacles used to capture prey. These tentacles are lined with a thick adhesive fluid as well as thorns of varying lengths. SCP-1000 exhibits a remarkable degree of control over these appendages, and has been known to capture small insects as well as its more common mammalian prey. In addition to this, SCP-1000 also possesses a rudimentary photosynthetic system, similar to that of cyanobacteria. However, the water required for this process is provided by prey, as SCP-1000 cannot absorb water through its root system.

When captured, prey items are drawn into a highly corrosive solution of hydrofluoric acid. This solution is contained by a structure similar to those found on //Nepenthaceae// (pitcher plants). Digestion is accomplished by standard enzymes and species of acidophillic bacteria. Following digestion of prey, the fluid in this structure is drawn back into the plant itself and broken down into HF and H2O. A small reserve of water is left to allow the formation of the acid once again. 

SCP-1000 exhibits a highly unusual root system, consisting of a primary taproot up to 100 meters in length and capable of penetrating rock. This root is used to anchor the surface structure, and is incapable of collecting water or nutrients. Multiple smaller roots grow off the primary, spreading up to █00 meters around the original specimen. These roots will commonly rise towards the surface and become new specimens. On occasion, they have also been known to extend into caverns and subterranean burrows, where they will act in a similar manner to the surface tendrils, seeking out prey. However, the root form does not produce digestive compounds, instead draining fluids directly from prey. Strangely, these secondary roots are able to absorb water and nutrients. 

SCP-1000 was first discovered in central Madagascar following a number of reports from European explorers regarding a "man-eating tree". Upon arrival, a Foundation research team discovered a number of grass dwellings inhabited by a tribe known locally as the Mkodo. Translation assets capable of translating the dialect spoken by these people told of a holy tree requiring human sacrifice. A containment force was subsequently dispatched. This team was unable to locate either the research group or the Mkodo village. However, the specimen was located, surrounded by 57 skulls. Further examination revealed these skulls as belonging to the Foundation research unit as well as an unknown racial group of Austronesian descent, thought to be the Mkodo.
