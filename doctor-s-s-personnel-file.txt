[[/div]]

**Legal Name:** ██████ █████ ██████

**Title:** Doctor S███████

**Known pseudonyms:** Soulless, Soul, Solace, Solis

**Profession:** General Researcher

**Comments:** Lack of general moral fiber somewhat disconcerting. Has a fascination with any SCP's considered 'creepy' or 'frightening'. Sometimes needs to be reminded not to be excessive.

Doctor S███████ has had at least fifty-seven failed attempts made on his life over a period of six months. Weapons used have included standard kitchen knives, a wide variety of firearms, several of Doctor S███████'s documented SCPs, fire, and an on-site nuclear device. Though no confirmed attacker has been found, extended hospitalization on his part, and several notes found in his office point to Researcher Gargus.

Additionally, Doctor S███████ has a large collection of cords scavenged from various places, each lovingly labeled with the date, month, hour, season, equatorial alignment, and humidity of the day of recovery. Doctor S███████ keeps the cords (being mostly of the extension, bungee, or spermatic variety) in his top left desk drawer.
