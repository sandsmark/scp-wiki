title:A Fat Ghost's Dossier
**Name:** Neil R. ██████

**Security Clearance:** Level 3

**Location:** Sector-28 (Vancouver Island Facility)

**Designation(s):** Safe-class SCP maintenance personnel, biological/sentient SCP caretaker, coastal retrieval director


__**Biography:**__

Discovered during pursuit of SCP-███, as it was about to enter the grounds of a local schoolyard. Mr. ██████ halted its progress, as well as that of the armed unit of SCP operatives hunting it under the guise of wildlife conservation officers, by offering it a piece of smoked salmon. He then reprimanded the operatives for “Scaring the hell out of the poor little guy.” Upon request, and careful consideration of the creature’s peaceful response to that point, Mr. ██████, or “Neil,” was allowed by the unit to guide SCP-███ to a proper containment vehicle, with further offerings of fish.

Given his curiosity for, and willingness to contribute to the Special Containment Procedures Foundation, and discernable effect in persuading a positive response from SCP-███, “Neil” was offered employment, and assigned to the nearest facility housing inanimate and safe SCP.


__**Notes:**__

-As a caretaker, he has prevented escapes and other hostile situations, while maintaining containment facilities and ensuring the survival and proper testing procedures of all SCP contained within Sector-28. Thusly, he has been promoted to Level 3 Security Clearance.

-It's entirely possible that "A Fat Ghost" is some kind of joke. Not important, but might as well make a note of it anyhow.
