title:A Fat Ghost's Dossier
**Name:** Neil R. ██████

**Security Clearance:** Level 3

**Location:** Sector-28 (Vancouver Island Facility)

**Designation(s):** Safe-class SCP maintenance personnel, biological/sentient SCP caretaker, coastal field operative and retrieval specialist


__**Biography:**__

Discovered during pursuit of SCP-███, as it was about to enter the grounds of a local schoolyard. Mr. ██████ halted its progress, as well as that of the armed unit of SCP operatives hunting it under the guise of wildlife conservation officers, by offering it a piece of smoked salmon. He then reprimanded the operatives for “Scaring the hell out of the poor little guy.” Upon request, and careful consideration of the creature’s peaceful response to that point, Mr. ██████, or “Neil,” was allowed by the unit to guide SCP-███ to a proper containment vehicle, by means of riding upon its back.

Given his willingness to contribute to the Special Containment Procedures effort, and discernable effect in persuading a positive response from SCP-███, “Neil” was spared from termination protocol, and assigned to the nearest facility housing animate and safe SCP. He has chosen the codename “A Fat Ghost” because it makes him feel “Much more like one of those secret-agent-looking guys.”


__**Notes:**__
