**Security Clearance:** Level 3

**Location:** Sector-28 (Vancouver Island Facility), oceanic Northern Hemisphere

**Designation(s):** Safe-class SCP Maintenance Personnel, Biological/Sentient SCP Caretaker, Coastal Retrieval Director


__**Biography:**__

Employed by the Special Containment Procedures Foundation as a member of the now-defunct Task Force Gamma-8, he was transferred to Sector-28 research staff. Having superceded Level 0 Security Clearance by field participation, he was given Level 1 status, and immediately allowed access to current, at that time, research facilities and materials.

Eventually displaying an affinity for biological studies, and, by extension, living phenomena, he was permitted to head field research teams with coastal jurisdiction. In producing significant research and report documents, he was promoted once again to Security Clearance Level 2, and given run of several sub-facilities, while being stationed at the central branch of Sector-28.

As a caretaker of living SCP, he has prevented several escape attempts and other hostile situations, while maintaining containment security and ensuring the survival of staff, and proper testing procedures of all SCP contained within Sector-28. This has recently earned him a promotion to Security Clearance Level 3, and the title of Coastal Retrieval Director.
