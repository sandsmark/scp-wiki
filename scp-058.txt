**Item #:** SCP-058


**Object Class:** Keter


**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-058 is to be kept in isolation in a 5 m by 5 m by 5 m containment chamber at all times. Walls are to be constructed of 3 m (10 ft) of reinforced heat-resistant steel, backed with a further 10 m (33 ft) of reinforced concrete. SCP-058 is to be fed a live cow every three days. Maintenance is to be conducted every sixty (60) minutes while SCP-058 is dormant and every fifteen (15) minutes when SCP-058 is active. Under no circumstances is SCP-058 to be allowed out of its containment area. SCP-058 is to be audio recorded at all times. No personnel are to listen to SCP-058 for more than thirty (30) minutes at a time. In case of escape, facility is to be considered compromised and detonation of on-site nuclear weaponry is to commence. 


**Description:** SCP-058 resembles a bovine heart, but is covered with razor-sharp spines, with four (4) crablike legs used primarily for movement and ten (10) tentacles of adjustable length around its mouth. These tentacles can be "whipped" to a distance of 12 m (40 ft) at speeds in excess of 320 km (200 mi) per hour. 

SCP-058 is capable of climbing walls much like a spider, using the claws on the ends of its legs to pierce the surface it is climbing to gain leverage and stability, and it will occasionally utilize its tentacles to pull itself to other surfaces at high speeds.

SCP-058 can secrete a substance similar to napalm, squirting it out at high speeds from a stinger on its rear side.

In addition to being extremely hostile, SCP-058 also speaks in a human voice, with vocal tone and accent of a British male in his late fifties, with a slight lisp and deep voice. SCP-058 talks constantly no matter what it is doing otherwise: even when attacking, SCP-058's voice and pace of speech are unchanged. SCP-058 appears to ramble about random topics with little to no correlation to previous topics or the situation at hand (see Transcript of Interview 058-04).

**Notes:**

SCP-058 was first encountered at Site ██ as it came out of the ███████. SCP-058 was extremely hostile and appeared to be very agitated. Initially SCP-058 attacked Site ██, which resulted in the death of all faculty and agents present. SCP-058 went on to attack the nearby town of ███████████, resulting in the death of over four thousand (4,000) citizens and the destruction of ninety percent (90%) of the surrounding buildings.

SCP-058 was finally contained after being crushed and incapacitated by a large amount of masonry, from a building that had collapsed on top of it. SCP-058 was then transported to Area 7 by agents who had arrived on the scene in response to the previous distress signals from Site ██. SCP-058 was contained at Area 7 for three weeks until it had fully recuperated, when it attacked seventeen (17) Class-D personnel and Agent █████, who were in the containment chamber at the time, killing them all in under five (5) seconds. SCP-058 went on to dismantle Area 7 and kill all remaining faculty and agents except for Agent ██████, who managed to subdue SCP-058 by running it over with an M1 Abrams Tank, pinning it beneath it, and then detonating over 2.3 kg (5 lbs) of C4 located in the cabin of the tank after she escaped. SCP-058 was then taken to Armed Bio-Containment Area 14, where it has been held since.

To date, SCP-058 has been responsible for the death of at least one hundred and forty-nine (149) Class-D personnel and fourteen (14) Agents at its current site.
