**Item #:** SCP-058


**Object Class**: Keter


**Special Containment Procedures**: SCP-058 is to be kept in isolation in a 50m^^2^^ containment chamber at all times. Walls are to be constructed of 3m (10ft) of reinforced heat resistant steel, backed with a further 10m (32.8ft) of reinforced concrete. SCP-058 is to be fed a live cow every three days. Maintenance is to be conducted every sixty (60) minutes while SCP-058 is dormant and every fifteen (15) minutes when SCP-058 is active. Under no circumstances is SCP-058 to be allowed out of containment area. SCP-058 is to be audio recorded at all times. No personnel are to listen to SCP-058 for more than thirty (30) minutes at a time. In case of escape, facility is to be considered compromised and detonation of on-site nuclear weaponry is to commence. 


**Description**: SCP-058 resembles a bovine heart, albeit with some serious differences, mainly being four (4) crablike legs used primarily for movement, and ten (10) tentacles of adjustable length, and covered with razor sharp spines. These appendages can be "whipped" to a distance of 12.19m (40ft) at a speeds of up to 321.87km (200mi) per hour. 

SCP-058 is capable of climbing walls much like a spider, using its claws to pierce the surface it is climbing to gain leverage and stability, and occasionally utilizing its other appendages to pull itself to other surfaces at high speeds.

Subject has been known to secrete a substance similar to napalm, squirting it out at high speeds from a stinger on its rear side.

SCP-058 was first encountered at Site ██ as it came out of the ███████. SCP-058 was extremely hostile and appeared to be very agitated. Initially SCP-058 attacked Site ██, which resulted in the deaths of all faculty and agents present. SCP-058 went on to attack the nearby town of ███████████ which resulted in the deaths of over four thousand (4,000) citizens and the destruction of ninety percent (90%) of the surrounding buildings.

SCP-058 was finally contained after being crushed by a large amount of masonry, from a building that had collapsed on top of it, incapacitating it. SCP-058 was then transported to Area 7, by agents who had arrived on the scene in response to the previous distress signals from Site ██. There it was contained for three weeks until it had fully recuperated, attacking the seventeen (17) Class-D personnel and Agent █████, who were in the containment chamber at the time, and killing them all in under five (5) seconds. SCP-058 went on to dismantle Area 7 and kill all remaining faculty and agents except for Agent ██████, who managed to subdue SCP-058 by running it over with a M1 Abrams Tank, pinning it beneath it, and then detonating over 2.27kg (5lbs) of C4 located in the cabin of the tank after she escaped. SCP-058 was then taken to Armed Bio-Containment Area-14 and is currently being held there.

**Notes**:

To date SCP-058 has been responsible for the deaths of over one hundred and forty nine (149) Class-D personnel and fourteen (14) Agents at current site.

In addition to being extremely hostile, SCP-058 has been noted to speak in a human voice, with vocal tone and accent of a British male in his late fifties, and speaks with a slight lisp and deep voice. SCP-058 constantly talks as it goes about its typical motions. Even when it is attacking its voice and pace of speech are unaffected. Subject appears to be rambling about random topics with no correlation to previous topics or the situation at hand.
