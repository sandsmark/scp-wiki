**Item #:** SCP-058


**Object Class:** Keter


**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-058 is to be kept in isolation in a 5 m by 5 m by 5 m containment chamber at all times. Walls are to be constructed of 3 m (10 ft) of reinforced heat-resistant steel, backed with a further 10 m (33 ft) of reinforced concrete. SCP-058 is to be fed a live cow every three days. Maintenance is to be conducted every sixty (60) minutes while SCP-058 is dormant and every fifteen (15) minutes when SCP-058 is active. Under no circumstances is SCP-058 to be allowed out of its containment area. SCP-058 is to be audio recorded at all times. No personnel are to listen to SCP-058 for more than thirty (30) minutes at a time. In case of escape, facility is to be considered compromised and detonation of on-site nuclear weaponry is to commence. 


**Description:** SCP-058 resembles a bovine heart, with four (4) crablike legs used primarily for movement, and ten (10) tentacles of adjustable length, covered with razor sharp spines. These tentacles can be "whipped" to a distance of 12.2 m (40 ft) at speeds in excess of 320 km (200 mi) per hour. 

SCP-058 is capable of climbing walls somewhat like a spider, using the claws on the ends of its legs to pierce the surface it is climbing to gain leverage and stability, and it will occasionally utilize its tentacles to pull itself to other surfaces at high speeds.

SCP-058 can secrete a substance similar to napalm, squirting it out at high speeds from a "stinger" on its rear side.  SCP-058 appears to make this substance in only limited amounts, and will exhaust it's supply after 2-3 applications, needing several hours to restore its supply.

In addition to being extremely hostile, SCP-058 also speaks in a human voice, with vocal tone and accent of a British male in his late fifties, with a slight lisp and deep voice. SCP-058 talks constantly, regardless of conditions: even when attacking, SCP-058's voice and pace of speech are unchanged. The speech of SCP-058 is totally random, with no detectable correlation to events or persons involved with SCP-058 (see Transcript of Interview 058-04).

**Notes:**

SCP-058 was first encountered at Site ██ as it came out of the ███████. SCP-058 was extremely hostile and appeared to be very agitated. Initially SCP-058 attacked Site ██, which resulted in the death of ██ faculty and ██ Agents. SCP-058 went on to attack the nearby town of ███████████, resulting in the death of over four thousand (4,000) citizens and the destruction of seventy percent (70%) of the surrounding buildings.

Post-Breach analysis determined a majority of the deaths are attributable to fire and fire-related injuries, resulting from a wide spread of "stinger fluid" by SCP-058 from a large structure.  This is also blamed for a majority of structural damage.  █████████ by SCP-058 accounts for only 8% of total deaths, with major evidence [DATA EXPUNGED]

SCP-058 was finally contained after being crushed and incapacitated by a large amount of masonry from a building that had collapsed on top of it. SCP-058 was then extracted and transported to ████████ by Agents and MTF teams.  SCP-058 was contained at ████████ for three weeks, during which it made minimal attempts to move, attributed both to physical damage and bloating from █████████ during the initial breach incident.  Testing during this period was limited, with SCP-058 still maintaining a high threat level even in its impaired state.

SCP-058 breached containment on ██/██/████ during a attempted transfer to a SCP Containment Site, causing multiple deaths and injuries.  SCP-058 was eventually incapacitated by Agent ██████, who managed to subdue SCP-058 by running it over with an M1 Abrams Tank, pinning it beneath it, and then detonating over 2.3 kg (5 lbs) of C4 located in the cabin of the tank after she escaped. SCP-058 was then taken to Armed Bio-Containment Area 14.

To date, SCP-058 has been responsible for the death of at least one hundred and forty-nine (149) Class-D personnel and fourteen (14) Agents at its current site.
