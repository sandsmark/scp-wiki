**Item #:** SCP-058


**Object Class:** Keter


**Special Containment Procedures:** 

SCP-058 is to be kept in isolation in a 5 m by 5 m by 5 m containment chamber at all times. Walls are to be constructed of 3 m (10 ft) of reinforced heat-resistant steel, backed with a further 10 m (33 ft) of reinforced concrete. SCP-058 is to be fed a live cow every three days. Maintenance is to be conducted every sixty (60) minutes while SCP-058 is dormant and every fifteen (15) minutes when SCP-058 is active. In case of escape, facility is to be considered compromised and detonation of on-site nuclear weaponry is to commence. 


**Description:** SCP-058 resembles a bovine heart, with four (4) crablike legs used primarily for movement, and ten (10) tentacles of adjustable length. Each of these tentacles possesses multiple conical spines with a three degree incline.  These tentacles can extend 12.2 m (40 ft) with tip velocity approximating 88m/s (293 feet/s). SCP-058 also excretes a high-concentration caustic venom from it's stinger, which has been demonstrated to be capable of liquefying 10 lbs of human tissue per minute. This venom can be extruded at velocities approaching 200 m/s.

SCP-058 can scale vertical, or near vertical surfaces with an overhang of up to 100 degrees. The mechanism by which this is accomplished is as yet unknown, as close study has proved impractical. SCP-058 has been observed performing short bursts of high incidence acceleration by use of it's tentacles. At maximum agitation it has exceeded the visual refresh rate of the average human retina.

SCP-058 has been observed mimicking speech with vocal tone and accent of a British male in his late fifties, with a slight lisp and deep voice. This mimicry is continuous, and shows no tone-shift or reaction to any attempts to communicate back, leading to the belief that SCP-058 is a non-sentient being that uses it's mimicry in a primitive attempt to lure, or confuse humans.

**Notes:**

SCP-058 was first encountered at Site ██ as it came out of the ███████. SCP-058 was extremely hostile and appeared to be very agitated. Initially SCP-058 attacked Site ██, which resulted in the death of all faculty and agents present. SCP-058 went on to attack the nearby town of ███████████, resulting in the death of over four thousand (4,000) citizens and the destruction of ninety percent (90%) of the surrounding buildings.

SCP-058 was finally contained after being crushed and incapacitated by a large amount of masonry, from a building that had collapsed on top of it. SCP-058 was then transported to Area 7 by agents who had arrived on the scene in response to the previous distress signals from Site ██. SCP-058 was contained at Area 7 for three weeks until it had fully recuperated, when it attacked seventeen (17) Class-D personnel and Agent █████, who were in the containment chamber at the time, killing them all in under five (5) seconds. SCP-058 went on to dismantle Area 7 and kill all remaining faculty and agents except for Agent ██████, who managed to subdue SCP-058 by running it over with an M1 Abrams Tank, pinning it beneath it, and then detonating over 2.3 kg (5 lbs) of C4 located in the cabin of the tank after she escaped. SCP-058 was then taken to Armed Bio-Containment Area 14, where it has been held since.

To date, SCP-058 has been responsible for the death of at least one hundred and forty-nine (149) Class-D personnel and fourteen (14) Agents at its current site.
