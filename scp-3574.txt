**Item #:** SCP-3574

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Known contact numbers for SCP-3574 are stored on file, and are restricted to Level-4 personnel.

Information pertaining to the contact numbers for SCP-3574 are to be confiscated whenever located and identified. Individuals possessing or acquiring this information are to be administered amnestic treatment, or interrogated if required. Phone calls of potential SCP-3574 clients are to be monitored for conversations with SCP-3574-C. If such conversations are identified, the transmission is to be terminated, and the client apprehended.

Instances of SCP-3574-A or B are to be contained when located and identified. Agents assigned to retrieve these instances are to exercise caution, as SCP-3574-A are potentially bio-hazardous or infectious. As such, SCP-3574-A are to be kept within humanoid containment cells with the ability to be hermetically sealed. SCP-3574-B are to be kept within a refrigerated BSL-2 storage unit, until the expiration of SCP-3574-A. When appropriate or necessary, the retrieval of the body of SCP-3574 may be facilitated.

Orders given by SCP-3574-C are to be recorded and submitted to Level-4 personnel. Investigations are ongoing to determine the identity and location of SCP-3574-C. Resources have been allocated to the containment of the individual.

**Description:** SCP-3574 is an anomalous service which offers to facilitate the termination, injury, illness, or loss of possessions of targeted humans of a client's choosing. These targeted subjects are henceforth referred to as SCP-3574-A. The monetary price of SCP-3574 varies, depending on the service requested.

SCP-3574 is accessible through telephone contact, after dialing one of several numbers. Contact numbers are delivered by letter to individuals with hostile or negative intentions. The source of these letters have not been determined, and assumed to be anomalous in nature. If contact is successful, an individual, designated SCP-3574-C will converse with the client. The voice of SCP-3574-C is modulated, however, a Hungarian accent is discernible. All attempts to identify this individual have been met with failure. Furthermore, attempts to trace the telephone call results in inconsistent and conflicting results.

Over the telephone call, the client is able to discuss the nature of the effects desired for SCP-3574-A. If the desired effects requested by the client are feasible, clients will be instructed to obtain one live sheep (//Ovis ariess//), terminate it, then remove a body part to be delivered to the target of their choosing, either directly or indirectly. The body part will henceforth be referred to as SCP-3574-B. SCP-3574-C will then instruct clients to remove the viscera of the animal, and insert a specified amount of cash into its abdominal cavity. The type of effect manifested on SCP-3574-A depends on the body part sent, as well as the specifications provided by the client. The effect of each body part is listed as follows:

* The head results in expiration, or unexplained disappearance.
* The tail results in an illness or disease described by the client[[footnote]]Anomalous illnesses, corresponding to no known disease, are also able to manifest.[[/footnote]].
* Hooves result in one or more injuries, ranging from fractures to disfigurement.
* The heart results in financial losses, or damage to the reputation of SCP-3574-A.

These effects occur spontaneously, through unknown means, after a period of time decided by the client. Illnesses and injuries are irreversible through conventional methods, and have not been observed to heal. After SCP-3574-A expires or is afflicted by the desired effect, the body of SCP-3574-B will vanish, along with the cash placed within. Any other object placed in the body, such as tracking or recording devices, will not vanish along with it. If a client attempts to extort SCP-3574-A, in order to regain the money lost to SCP-3574, he or she will experience the effects intended for SCP-3574-A, and the original target will subsequently be exempt from any detrimental effects.

Upon initial delivery of SCP-3574-B, SCP-3574-C will contact SCP-3574-A, informing the subject that he or she has committed a transgression, and will be "punished", unless specific orders are followed. Any attempts to dispose of SCP-3574-B will be met with failure, with the object reappearing in various locations within the place of residence of SCP-3574-A.

The effects of SCP-3574 can be neutralized if SCP-3574-A successfully follows the orders of SCP-3574-C. Recorded orders include termination of family members through specific methods[[footnote]]Known methods include, but are not limited to, strangulation, mutilation, exsanguination, and cannibalism.[[/footnote]], removal and incineration of the subject's non-vital organs, and self-amputation without sedatives. Alternatively, it has been determined that affixing SCP-3574-B to its body will inhibit the development of detrimental effects on SCP-3574-A, unless the subject had already expired. As such, clients will often conceal the body to prevent this from occurring.

**Document 3574-1:** The following text is an example of a letter, confiscated by a potential client of SCP-3574.

> We know you've been hurt, we know you've suffered injustice, we know how it feels.
> 
> We can make it go away, we can right the wrongs you have faced, we can deliver justice when others cannot.
> 
> We know you are interested; the oracle knows.
> 
> Contact [REDACTED] for further instructions.

The reverse side of all letters from SCP-3574 contain a message of unknown context, accompanied by images depicting four decapitated goat or sheep heads. The text is listed as follows.

> The oracle tells us all. These are its words.
> 
> "Oracles; there are more.
> Though thought to be three,
> In fact there are four,
> And the fourth one is me."

**Addendum:** On ██/██/2002, Agent Kershoff alerted researchers that he had received a letter from SCP-3574 at his place of residence. He was permitted to contact the number, for purposes of documentation. The audio log is available in the following document.

> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **SCP-3574-C:** Greetings, Mr. Kershoff.
> 
> **Kershoff:** How do you know my name?
> 
> **SCP-3574-C:** The oracles tell us many things. Sometimes the past. Sometimes the present. Sometimes the future. The fourth one, however, tells us that the future is not set in stone. You can trust us, rest assured. We know all that we need to know about you, Mr. Kershoff. You have nothing to fear. We know that you are thinking of someone. No. Thinking of quite a few people, I see. I am going to tell you that we can right the wrongs that have been committed, in almost any way you desire. Allow us to rid you of any doubts you may have about us.
> 
> **Kershoff:** Elaborate.
> 
> **SCP-3574-C:** Where to begin? How about your father?
> 
> **Kershoff:** What do-
> 
> **SCP-3574-C:** He was... murdered wasn't he? Yes, murdered by █████ ██████. The oracle has told us everything. The police, they let him get away. Unpunished. They said that there wasn't enough evidence... but we know better. Don't we? We know they were in on it. They let a murderer walk free, and your family suffered. Such suffering. What about the drug dealer that sold your brother the drugs, that resulted in his death? Your brother... never got over your father's death, did he? That's why he did it.
> 
> **Kershoff:** That's- How do you know about those events?
> 
> **SCP-3574-C:** Please, Mr. Kershoff, this conversation isn't about me. It's about you. And what you want. What about your wife? No, no, we know you don't want to hurt her. Never. But what about Mr. █████? She is staying with him behind your back. I'm sure you know.
> 
> **Kershoff:** I...
> 
> **SCP-3574-C:** Yes. It isn't your fault you are... busy. Very busy all the time. But she couldn't understand. We both know. You are... hurt over this. Yes? Even though you just want a better life for the both of- 
> 
> **Kershoff:** Stop. These matters are none of your concern. You are to answer my questions.
> 
> **SCP-3574-C:** Perhaps you would want him to disappear from your wife's life? The oracle can make it happen. We can take care of your problems. We can't bring back the people you love, but we can bring justice. We can give you peace. For a small price.
> 
> **Kershoff:** I said stop. I'm not interested. Answer my question. Tell me what I need to know.
> 
> **SCP-3574-C:** We both know the truth; the oracle tells us. You hesitated; you are interested. And we have already told you all you need to know. We can make your problems disappear. Or, if you are interested in slower, more painful solutions-
> 
> **Kershoff:** I'm not interested... Answer my question. What is the oracle?
> 
> **SCP-3574-C:** We both know that is not what you desire. But if giving you some insight will convince you to trust us, we can tell you what you need to know.
> 
> **Kershoff:** What is the oracle? Explain it to me in a way I can understand.
> 
> **SCP-3574-C:** Mr. Kershoff, you are a mystery. Most of our clients are happy just to know that we can address their problems in almost any way they desire. Your false quest for answers are taking up our precious time.
> 
> **Kershoff:** Explain the nature of the oracle.
> 
> **SCP-3574-C:** Very well, Mr. Kershoff, I will shed some light on the matter, but after this, no more. Our time is precious. The oracle has been in my family's possession for 6 generations; for many years my family kept it a secret from the outside world. All that time, it did not speak, until a few years back. It gave us the cryptic riddle included in the message. We know it is hungry. It needs to be fed. If not, terrible things would happen. To circumvent this, we offer people services, to fix the injustice they had suffered. In turn, the oracle feeds off the wicked people who step over others. It is for... the greater good. Yes? That is all I am willing to say. Now. Shall we discuss your desires?
> 
> **Kershoff:** I don't understand. Earlier you said, the "fourth one". Elaborate. What is the nature of the oracle?
> 
> **SCP-3574-C:** (sighs) Well, Mr. Kershoff, if you aren't interested now, we can continue... another time, perhaps. We are also busy, and have many clients. The oracle is often impatient and hungry. But we are always available, and you know how to contact us. We know you will.
