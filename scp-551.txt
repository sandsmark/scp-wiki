**Item #:** SCP-551

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-551 is to be contained in a simple cardboard box. It must be of an adequate size to carry all pieces of SCP-551. The box should be stored in a locker unit on Storage Site-23 and at least one (1) Level 1 staff member is to be notified in the event of its removal.

**Description:**  SCP-551 is a standard, five hundred and fifty (550) piece jigsaw puzzle, which should depict in it’s finished form the image of a solitary woman on a small row boat, surrounded by a stormy sea; but due to the nature of SCP-551’s abnormal qualities, some details of the scene are left incomplete, such as the woman’s face and [DATA EXPUNGED].

SCP-551 was found in the apartment of ███ ████ after other residents complained of an odor seeping out from under the door. The severely malnourished body of ███ ████ was discovered beside SCP-551, with several pieces still clutched in her hand. Roughly one third of SCP-551 was pieced together on her floor. 

Multiple subjects testing SCP-551 stated that a completion of the puzzle seems inconceivable. The mental reactions of subjects to SCP-551 was diverse, apparently depending less on the puzzle and more on the personality of the subject (see Addendums 551-1/2/3), though the effects of SCP-551 on the psychology of subjects should not be overlooked.

**Addendum 551-1**
Standard Class-D personnel is tasked with piecing together SCP-551. Subject spent two weeks in a single room, trying to finish the puzzle, and pausing only to sleep occasionally. Subject became increasingly frustrated with his progress on SCP-551, which failed to span past forty (40) connect pieces after all this time. Subject slept less during his last days working on the puzzle, and was permitted to stop when he [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Addendum 551-2**
Class-D personnel with a history of addictive behavior is tasked with piecing together SCP-551. Subject acted aloof about the assignment at first, but after connecting two pieces, she seemed to become alarmingly obsessed with SCP-551. Subject stayed beside it for days, sometimes screaming about her lack of progress. After a period of four weeks, subject lost consciousness from lack of sleep, and the test was ended. One hundred and two (102) pieces of SCP-551 had been connected.  

**Addendum 551-3 **
Dr. ██████, who scored above average on a standard IQ test, expresses skepticism about SCP-551 and is approved to test it. Dr. ██████ completed all but a couple of sections, specifically the woman’s facial features and [DATA EXPUNGED]. Despite this success, Dr. ██████ showed confusion over his remaining pieces and adopted a fatalist attitude toward the puzzle, finally refusing to complete it after four days.
