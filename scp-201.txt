**Item #:**  SCP-201

**Object Class:**  Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**
No personnel are to come within forty meters of SCP-201 at any time.  Any and all work done with SCP-201 is to be done via robot.  Any personnel entering the containment area must be accompanied by two members of security.  All personnel in containment area must wear a restraint harness with safety rope attached to the wall.  Rope will allow access to within five feet of the minimum safe area, exceeding this distance will result in physical removal from containment area and formal discipline.  

Those affected by SCP-201 are to have time and date of exposure, disappearance, and return, along with any and all personal information recorded in log ███████.  Subjects reaching the end of exposure are to be recovered as soon as possible by Agents, and debriefed immediately.

**Description:** 

SCP-201 appears to be a large, metal sphere with a badly battered and dented surface.  SCP-201 is three feet in diameter, and weighs 417 pounds.  The metal is very strong, and comprised of an alloy of unknown metals.  Attempts to take samples from or damage SCP-201 have thus far been unsuccessful.

Entering within thirty meters of SCP-201 can result in the subject being displaced into an alternate reality.  This effect is apparently random, with some subjects remaining totally unaffected after exposure.  Those effected will cease to exist in our reality between one and forty-eight hours after initial exposure.  Exposure times vary between a few hours and upwards of eight years.  Time spent in this alternate reality can very greatly from actual time elapsed in our reality.

This alternate world appears identical to our own, with these exceptions:

•	It is apparently in a state of constant twilight, with no sun or moon visible at any time.
•	Large banks of very dense grey fog travel very low to the ground.  These banks are unaffected by wind, and can make exposed skin feel very sticky and dirty.
•	There is no plant, animal, or insect life anywhere.  Major cities and any places of human habitation appear as if all life suddenly vanished in the same second.
•	Most, if not all, electrical systems appear to be broken or without power
•	The air will randomly take on a grey-brown tint, accompanied by strong wind.

Subjects exposed to this “alternate world” report initial surprise and curiosity, which is shortly replaced by very strong feelings of loneliness and fear.  The severity varies widely with individual subjects and with time of exposure.  Upon the end of exposure, subject will re-integrate from the “alternate world” to our own, which can cause a great deal of shock, especially in urban settings.

In addition, reports of [DATA EXPUNGED].  It is unclear if these are real [DATA EXPUNGED].  Testing will commence if viable samples can be recovered.
