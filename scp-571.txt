**Item #:** SCP-571

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** A single piece of paper containing an instance of SCP-571 is to be kept inside an opaque, sealed Class-VXI container, at the center of Containment Chamber Epsilon-34 at Auxiliary Site-X1043. All inbuilt incineration devices at Auxiliary Site-X1043 must be maintained and tested regularly.

Only one instance of SCP-571 should exist at any time, except during specially approved testing. Should the paper containing SCP-571 be destroyed, another copy may be printed from the encrypted backup file. No other recordings of SCP-571 are to exist.

SCP-571's containment chamber must be monitored at all times using infrared devices. Eight level 2 guards must be stationed outside of SCP-571's chamber at all times. Four of these guards are to wear infrared goggles at all times during shifts. Any persons attempting to enter the containment chamber without authorization are to be terminated immediately. Upon any successful unauthorized entry, the incineration devices in SCP-571's containment chamber are to be activated immediately.

All personnel leaving Site-143 are to be examined for potential SCP-571 contamination without visual contact as outlined by Protocol CD36-Alpha. Personnel attempting to bypass Site-143 security are to be terminated within Auxiliary Site-X1043's 10-mile perimeter.

In the case of an SCP-571 containment breach, affected personnel are to be summarily killed and incinerated. If Auxiliary Site-X1043 becomes significantly compromised, the network of auxiliary incineration devices should be activated as outlined by Protocol CD36-Zeta.

Due to potential for an AK-class end-of-the-world scenario, SCP-571 must never be accessible in any way from any location within 200km of any minor population center, or within 500km of any major population center.

**Description:** SCP-571 is a complex pattern of lines and scribbles with an anomalous memetic effect. Appearance was determined by cutting an image of 571 into sections and rearranging the sections, disabling the pattern's anomalous effect and allowing it to be safely viewed.

When any human looks at SCP-571 for any amount of time, they will immediately search for a piece of paper or other suitable stationery. The exposed human will then begin to copy SCP-571 onto the new paper, with any available drawing implement. Despite the particularly high complexity of the pattern, copying of SCP-571 by an exposed human will be successful approximately 96% of the time. 

Once SCP-571 has been copied (whether successfully or not), the affected person will seek out other humans, and attempt to coax or force them to view the copied pattern. Successfully infected victims will immediately attempt to copy the pattern, thus continuing the process. Attempts to talk to or reason with infected persons are met with failure. Carriers of SCP-571 will only talk or interact with others for the purpose of causing them to look at SCP-571. 

Carriers of SCP-571 who are unable to locate other uninfected humans will regularly coax one another to view and copy the pattern again. 28% of individuals exposed will, if not prompted otherwise, continue this cycle until undergoing death by thirst. The remainder of exposed individuals will eat and drink as needed, but will not tend to other non-vital bodily needs (such as using restrooms or sleeping in a bed voluntarily).

Exposure to Class-C amnesiacs may cause SCP-571 carriers to forget how to duplicate the SCP-571 pattern. However, carriers will continue to attempt to recreate the pattern and attempt to coax other individuals to view it. These depictions are never accurate depictions of SCP-571 (even in individuals with 'photographic' memory, as the pattern is too complex to be copied by non-anomalous means) and cannot be transmitted. There is no known means of completely curing individuals affected by SCP-571.

As carriers of SCP-571 are permanently unable to engage in any conscious activity unrelated to enticing another person to view SCP-571, containment breach may result in an AK-class end-of-the-world scenario if SCP-571 carriers are able to reach major urban population centers.

**Addendum: Incident X571-A**: [DATA EXPUNGED] Following these events, SCP-571 has been reclassified as Keter. Description and containment procedures updated accordingly.
