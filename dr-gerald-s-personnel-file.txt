**Security Clearance:** Level 2

**Duties:** Head Research Assistant 

**Location:** Currently works on a "where needed" basis. Most commonly found at Site-17

**History:** One of the newest additions to The Foundation, Dr. Gerald was chosen due to his work in the fields of neuroscience, physics, and quantum mechanics. However, due to his inexperience, he is currently assigned as a research assistant, aiding the higher ranking scientists in SCP research experimentation. 

As his duties often include the handling of dangerous SCPs, Dr. Gerald has had an alarming number of accidents during the tests and experiments he has been involved in. To date, Dr. Gerald has been hurt no less than 63 times. Some of the many injuries he as obtained are: caught on fire; trampled; falling several stories onto concrete; shot; run over by several vehicles; badly cut; getting amnesia; dragged through several kilometers of [DATA EXPUNGED]; eaten; blown up; frozen; asphyxiated; hit repeatedly with several blunt instruments; electrocuted; bitten; and in one incident, being mentally reconfigured, making him believe that he was a duck. When questioned about his thoughts on the matter, Dr. Gerald's only reply is "Shit happens. At least The Foundation has a really good insurance policy". All experiments in which Dr. Gerald is participating in are required to have at least one level 3 medical team present.

**Note:** //Any personnel found betting on Dr. Gerald's next injury are to be severely reprimanded.// -05-█
