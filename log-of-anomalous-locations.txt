**Foreword:** This page is to be devoted to the documentation of low threat anomalous locations which have been discovered by the SCP Foundation over the years. Although all locations listed in this document warrant securing and cover-up measures, none of them are closely enough tied to an underlying anomalous cause or considered a high enough containment or research priority to warrant full Special Containment Procedure documentation. This list may be used as a resource should knowledge of these locations become useful or necessary in the future.

**Location Description:** An area of approximately 27 square meters where fire cannot exist. Any existing fire will spontaneously extinguish when it enters the area, and no substances will ignite while in the area.
**Date of Containment:** █/██/████
**Location:** Yosemite National Park, California, USA.
**Security Protocol:** Foundation outpost constructed over area and disguised as a ranger station. Structure designated a non-smoking area.

**Location Description:** A spherical area 5 meters in diameter. Any human subjects located inside the sphere will experience visual hallucinations, viewing any space outside the sphere as a real-time view of the Martian sky and surface. All effects cease when the subject leaves the sphere.
**Date of Containment:** ██/██/████
**Location:** Cardiff, Wales.
**Security Protocol:** "Stars and Constellations Planetarium" front company constructed around the anomaly. Anomalous location contained in a "Staff Only" area.

**Location Description:** A street where any noise perceived by humans or electronic devices is followed exactly two seconds afterword by an exact copy of the sound. The echo effect does not extend to sounds caused by the echo effect.
**Date of Containment:** █/█/████
**Location:** ██████ ██, Surat, India.
**Security Protocol:** Road blocked off and removed from maps.

**Location Description:** An exact replica of the Disneyland USA theme park as it appeared on July 16, 1955, constructed entirely of steel.
**Date of Containment:** ██/█/████
**Location:** The Moon.
**Security Protocol:** All NASA images and public photographs containing the location edited. Internet activity to be continually monitored for information leaks.

**Location Description:** A 2.23 meter by 2.23 meter square area of ground. Once a human has stood on this area for 5 or more minutes, all humans encountering the subject for the next 120 hours will experience the olfactory hallucination that the subject smells of strawberries.
**Date of Containment:** ██/█/████
**Location:** Plant City, Florida
**Security Protocol:** A strawberry field is planted over the area and is sustained by the Foundation front company "Strawberry and Cantaloupe Plantations."

**Location Description:** A country ranch. All buildings on the ranch and all matter contained inside them are an undifferentiated blue. Despite the lack of shading, color, and opacity contrast, humans are fully capable of discerning shapes and form within the affected areas, occasionally to a greater extent than they can outside the anomaly.
**Date of Containment:** █/█/████
**Location:** Fallon, Nevada.
**Security Protocol:** Ranch purchased and closed to the public. Satellite images of the ranch edited.

**Location Description:** A circular area approximately 46 meters in diameter. Gravity in this area does not conform to regular laws or models, lessening and partially reversing at points.
**Date of Containment:** ██/█/1945
**Location:** Santa Cruz, California
**Security Protocol:** Due to public popularity at the time of the confirmation of anomalous activity, location permitted to continue operating as "The Mystery Spot", a local tourist attraction. Every several years, theories are to be leaked through the scientific community as to possible causes for the anomaly, such as optical illusions or geographical positioning.

**Location Description:** A storage warehouse. Any organisms possessing sex chromosomes will spontaneously convert to the opposite biological sex upon entering the warehouse. Effects will reverse immediately upon exiting the warehouse. Effects do not trigger or reverse for pregnant organisms.
**Date of Containment:** 14/2/2001
**Location:** █████, Michigan
**Security Protocol:** Warehouse bought and closed to the public.

**Location Description:** A sphere 5 meters in radius. All humans who are caught in the sphere spontaneously vocalize, in English, "boy, I wish I had a nice cold Pepsi right now" regardless of native language or knowledge of the Pepsi brand.
**Date of Containment:** 29/2/1968
**Location:** In interplanetary space, static relative to the Sun at approximately the same altitude and inclination as the Earth.
**Security Protocol:** Due to the difficulty of studying this area astronomically and the erratic nature of the affected locations, modeling software capable of predicting future affected locations is still in development. Currently, mentions of the above phrase are monitored on social media, with amnestics distributed at the discretion of security personnel.

**Location Description:** A housing estate measuring 50m x 35m, designed by Architect ███ █████ in 1986 but never inhabited. It is constructed in five spatial dimensions, explorations revealing paradoxical but consistent geometry.
**Date of Containment:** 02/06/1987
**Location:** ██████████, Scotland
**Security Protocol:** Purchased, and infrasonic repellants installed. Demolition request denied. ███ █████ now designated POI-5536.

**Location Description:** Kydatogorsk is a nonexistant town in the Ural mountains. ~10% of local maps show it, including geological and topographic, but satellite images show no settlement. ~15% of relevant encyclopedias, tourist brochures and travelogues describe the town, but inspection reveals no human habitation. Under questioning, the affected authors recall writing the descriptions, but not having researched or visited Kydatogorsk.
**Date of Containment:** Partial containment since 1976
**Location:** Documents of the region
**Security Protocol:** Agents placed in publishing companies. Anti-memetic strategies under consideration.

**Location Description:** An underground mine (about 1 mile deep) where it is constantly raining. The mine does not flood.
**Date of Containment:**█/█/████
**Locations:** ████ Arizona, through the edge of Utah.
**Security Protocol:** All entrances blocked off, signs that state "Dangerous! Mine Unstable!"

**Location Description:** An irregular area ~2.3km in diameter, from where two suns are visible in the sky.
**Date of Containment:** ██/██/1998
**Location:** Kharan Desert, Pakistan
**Security Protocol:** Cordoning of region, explained by nuclear testing.

**Location Description:** A hotel. Sounds generated in rooms repeat exactly 871 days later.
**Date of Containment:** 23/12/1956
**Location:** Rooms 331-338, Apex Hotel, Cairo
**Security Protocol:** Site purchased. Unaffected rooms used as accommodation for visiting agents.
