title:DrMorris's Author Page
This is just going to be a place for me to list and comment on things I've written, nothing special. Might get around to doing cool things with this page at some point.

**SCPs:**

* //[[[SCP-3327]]] - Russian Bunker(s).// My first successful SCP. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. I'm planning to do some tales on all the weird stuff that happens in the bunker(s), but that's on the back burner right now.

* //[[[SCP-3671]]] - A very angry box of cereal.// Had a stupid idea, wrote a stupid idea, got a surprising number of upvotes for a stupid idea. Overall 10/10 experience.

* //[[[SCP-3916]]] - Hungry locusts.// The title feels pretty mediocre but I can't think of anything better. Oh well. This was written for the Doomsday Contest, and I like how well it worked with the iteration format.

**Tales:**

* //[[[apologies-and-redemption|Apologies and Redemption]]].// A sort-of-sequel to SCP-3916. Ended up //way// longer than I expected, and was quite fun to write (especially the end).
