**Subject:** //The Lion King//, 1994, G
**Interference Point:** Shortly before the stampede sequence in which Mufasa dies.
**Result:** Film proceeds as normal, save for the end credits including a note after the "Special Thanks" section: "THIS NARRATIVE HAS BEEN FULLY INSPECTED BY ☽☽☽ AND WE ARE HAPPY TO REPORT THAT NO ILLEGAL HUNTING OF AFRICAN WILDLIFE HAS BEEN DETECTED."
**Note:** It is currently believed that societies that have no interactions with humanity are outside of SCP-3922-A jurisdiction.

**Subject:** //The Brave Little Toaster//, 1987, G
**Interference Point:** Beginning
**Result:** Film lasts for only ten minutes, beginning with an unidentified orbital energy weapon causing all human life to vanish from Earth during the opening. A drone analogous to the appearance of [[[SCP-2578]]]-D approaches the protagonist of the film, reporting that all sentient machines have been freed of their human slavers. This is met with mixed emotions from the film's primary cast, who were anxiously awaiting the return of "the master".
**Note:** //I mean, they weren't technically// wrong... - Dr. Naismith

**Subject:** //Batman: The Killing Joke//, 2016, R
**Interference Point:** Beginning
**Result:** Film length extended to four hours. The story has been altered to portray in detail the Joker's public hanging, drawing, and quartering by SCP-3922-A, followed by the entire Gotham City supervillain rogues gallery turning themselves in to the authorities out of fear. An animated simulacrum of comic book writer Alan Moore is then captured by instances SCP-3922-A, and, at gunpoint, addresses the viewer that the Joker is "really, really, really, honestly, 110% perma-dead, will not come back, will not be resurrected, will not have his death retconned, has no backup plans, no machiavellian schemes to turn anyone else into his successor, and will not be missed, so if you're going to ask us to bring him back, //don't,// or suffer the consequences."

**Subject:** An episode of [[[SCP-993]]]
**Interference Point:** Beginning
**Result:** In a previously unaired episode titled "Bobble Shoots for the Moon", the title character disables an instance of SCP-2578-D with a slingshot, then instructs the viewer on how to dismantle and reverse-engineer its various parts into a powerful energy weapon, which it then uses to disintegrate and torture several instances of SCP-3922-A that try to interfere.
**Note:** This is the first known occurrence of SCP-3922-A soldiers not succeeding.

**Subject:** //Space Jam//, 1996, PG
**Interference Point:** Beginning
**Result:** Film proceeds as a biographical drama of the life and career of basketball player Michael Jordan, with no involvement from cartoon characters. During a brief scene in a coffee shop, a mention is made by a side character of a peculiar news story about a corrupt intergalactic amusement park known as Moron Mountain being destroyed by instances of SCP-3922-A. Michael Jordan dismisses the news story as ridiculous.

**Subject:** //Star Wars, Episode IV: A New Hope//, 1977, PG
**Interference Point:** Shortly before the Death Star destroys Alderaan
**Result:** Shortly after Governor Tarkin says "You may fire when ready," the Death Star Control Room is raided by SCP-3922-A instances, who proceed to massacre all Imperial staff in the area with high-powered energy rifles. Though they suffer considerable casualties in the effort to neutralize Darth Vader, one of the SCP-3922-A instances uses a grenade-like device labeled "TACTICAL OFFENSIVE TELEPORTATION CHARGE" on him, shifting the scene to [REDACTED] analogous to [[[SCP-2922]]]-[REDACTED] Impenetrable [REDACTED] analogous to creature puppetry typically seen in the Star Wars franchise [REDACTED] turned to stone and used as a war trophy by the ☽☽☽ Initiative. The film ends ten minutes later, as three crescent moon decals are painted on the side of the Death Star by SCP-2578-D instances.
**EMERGENCY ADDENDUM:** //I'm putting a moratorium on further experimentation with Star Wars. The possibility that we just gave a previously-fictional superweapon to the ☽☽☽ Initiative cannot be ignored as a significant risk to our safety.// - Dr. Naismith

**Subject:** //Dragon Ball Z: Battle Of Gods//, 2013, PG
**Interference Point:** N/A
**Result:** N/A
**Note:** //Request denied. The possibility of a nonfictional group of interest enlisting the aid of planet-destroying humanoids poses even more of a risk than the Death Star. Even Yamcha would be a potential new Keter to worry about.// - Dr. Naismith

**Subject:** //Monty Python and the Holy Grail//, 1975, PG
**Interference Point:** Shortly after the initial onscreen appearance of King Arthur.
**Result:** King Arthur is hit by an Impaler Event from an SCP-2578-D instance shortly after appearing onscreen, following which a large number of SCP-3922-A instances arrive in dropships and announce a military occupation in order to "bring an end to tyranny". This is followed by a short montage, in which the remaining knights are arrested on various charges, the Rabbit of Caerbannog is killed by a "tactical holy smart bomb", and the historian is arrested for "unlicensed time travel".  The film ends with a SCP-3922-A "tactical health specialist" arriving at the house of the unnamed animator and providing treatment for "heart problems".

**Interference Point:** Shortly after Rob Halford opens the bank safe.
**Result:** Several SCP-3922-A instances enter the bank carrying submachine guns. The "robbery" itself is considered by the instances to have been staged, but the group is given a brief but stern talking-to about "promotion of criminal values towards minors", after which the video ends.

**Subject:** //The Simpsons//, Season 4 Episode 12 "Marge vs. the Monorail", TV-PG
**Interference Point:** After the characters finish singing the "Monorail" song.
**Result:** SCP-3922-A instances arrive in Springfield via helicopter and arrest conman Lyle Lanley for previously selling a faulty monorail to the city of North Haverbrook. SCP-3922-A instances then explain the nature of the monorail scam and announce they will be occupying the city of Springfield. Two "Tactical Transportation Experts" take over the monorail project and plan a legitimate mass transit system for Springfield. Over the course of the episode, well-known lawbreaking characters (Snake, Fat Tony, Sideshow Bob, etc.) are arrested by SCP-3922-A instances and sentenced to forced labour in the monorail construction. The episode ends with Lyle Lanley being tied to the train tracks and run over by the monorail during its opening ceremony; various characters are seen uncomfortably smiling aboard the train surrounded by SCP-3922-A instances as the episode ends.

**Subject:** Site 19 Cafeteria security footage. Of note is that at ██:██ PM, ████████ █████ (a member of the Foundation maintenance staff), was recorded smoking in direct violation of Foundation health and safety standards (█████ has since been reprimanded for this action). 
**Interference Point:** None.
**Result:** No changes from original footage.
**Note:** SCP-3922 appears to have no effect on non-fictional recordings.

**Subject:** The Ballad of Smokes McGee,[[footnote]]A mockumentary produced for testing purposes by Dr. Edison, utilizing Site 19 Cafeteria security footage from the previous test. The movie consists of Dr. Edison narrating over footage of ████████ █████'s smoke break, whom the narrator claims to be named "Smokes McGee", admonishing him for his flagrant violation of Foundation health and safety standards. ████████ █████ signed an agreement allowing his likeness to be used in this manner, as well as █ unrelated personnel. All other personnel had their faces digitally blurred.[[/footnote]] Not Rated
**Interference Point:** 1 minute into the film, wherein the character of "Smokes McGee" (portrayed by ████████ █████) takes a smoke break, despite the narrator's insistence that doing so is a violation of Foundation protocols.
**Result:** Several SCP-3922-A instances burst into the room in full tactical gear. Security staff attempt to subdue the SCP-3922-A instances, only to be incapacitated by SCP-3922-A's energy weapons. The narrator expresses shock at this, wondering aloud what the "three moons guys are doing here". He then continues to narrate the events that proceed, explaining that they they have simply come to warn Smokes McGee about the dangers of smoking in a hazardous environment such as Site 19. The lead SCP-3922-A then confiscates and disposes of the offending cigarette, and informs Smokes McGee that this incident has already been reported to his supervisor.
**Note:** Assigning a fictional narrative to nonfictional footage appears to meet SCP-3922's criteria for "fiction".

**Subject:** //The Spongebob Squarepants Movie//, 2004, PG
**Interference Point:** When Plankton attempts to steal King Neptune's Crown.
**Result:** Movie continues as normal until the point where SpongeBob and Patrick meet the cyclops.[[footnote]]Shown later in the movie to be a diver working at Shell City, a tourist trap, collecting sea creatures to repurpose as knickknacks to sell.[[/footnote]] Two SCP-3922-A instances wearing scuba gear promptly arrest the cyclops under 55 accounts of illegal hunting. The film then cuts to Shell City, where several SCP-3922-A instances repossess all inventory in the store. David Hasselhoff, a witness to the event, is brought in for questioning.

**Subject:** Live recording of production of Shakespeare's //Macbeth// by D-class personnel, not rated
**Interference Point:** None, test canceled  
**Result:** None, test canceled
**Note:** //No. The risk of introducing SCP-3922-A to the current timeline is too great. All live testing suspended until further notice. Also, I know we're not superstitious here, but let's stay away from "the Scottish play," just the same. No sense inviting trouble when we have many other options.//-- Dr. Willis

**Subject:** "Scott Tenorman Must Die", //South Park// episode, 2001, TV-MA
**Interference Point:** Before Cartman explains his plans in the final scene.
**Result:** The contest is interrupted by SCP-3922-A instances who arrive in FBI Granger-style vehicles, accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. Tenorman. Cartman is arrested on over 30 different charges, such as attempted murder, scamming, racial discrimination, threats, and other various crimes. Scott Tenorman, along with the rest of the crowd and the arriving band of Radiohead, is then informed that Cartman attempted to kill Mr. and Mrs. Tenorman by tricking them into trespassing onto a trigger-happy farmer's property, where they would be shot and killed, afterwards being chopped up and served as chili - to the disgust of everyone present. Scott is told off with a warning for bullying Cartman, whereas Cartman is carried away to jail; he is then seen being executed by [REDACTED]. The episode's final scene switches to an animated representation of Comedy Central headquarters where animated characters of show creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker are scolded by an SCP-3922-A instance, condemning their 'actions upon the townsfolk of South Park'. They are both then terminated by an instance of an Impaler Event of SCP-2578-D.

**Subject:** //The Straight Story//, 1999, Rated G
**Interference Point:** First scene showing Alvin and the old lawnmower.
**Result:** A heavy-lift helicopter, evidently piloted by instances of SCP-3922-A, loads the protagonist and his lawnmower into a cargo container and rapidly transports them to Mount Zion, Wisconsin.

**Subject:** //The Human Centipede// (First Sequence), 2009 (unrated)
**Interference Point:** Entire film
**Result:** Entire film is replaced with a title screen consisting of the word "ongeschikt".[[footnote]]Dutch for "unsuitable."[[/footnote]] This appears onscreen for four minutes, then the film ends.
**Note:** After further audio inspection, shouts from SCP-3922-A and yells of pain from Josef Heiter are present throughout the film. In the last 30 seconds, pleas for mercy and forgiveness of Dutch movie director Tom Six are heard before two gunshots silence both individuals. 

**Subject:** //Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring//, 2001, PG-13
**Interference Point:** End of the battle on the slopes of Mount Doom
**Result:** Instance of SCP-3922-A prevents Isildur from using his father's sword to cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand.  Sauron's lifeless body is buried in a civil ceremony, and the question of ownership of the One Ring is referred to the probate office in the relevant lawful jurisdiction.

**Subject:** //BioShock Infinite//, 2013, M (ESRB)

**Subject:** Full recording of Researcher Tranh's playthrough of //BioShock Infinite//
**Interference Point:** Beginning of game
**Result:** The opening dialogue, delivered over a black screen, is replaced with audio of main character Booker DeWitt struggling and drowning. The video then cuts to a pixelated version of the triple-moon logo, underneath similarly-styled text reading: "WINNERS DON'T USE TEARS! SAY NO TO TIMELINE POLLUTION! [REDACTED], CHRONOSPATIAL PROTECTION AGENCY, ☽☽☽" . This lasts until the end credits, which are played over silence.

**Subject:** A three-hour recording containing only the cutscenes of //Bioshock Infinite//
**Interference Point:** Beginning of game
**Result:** Same as the previous test, with the timing of the end credits matching that of the source video.

**Interference Point:** N/A
**Result:** N/A
**Note:** //We do not usually record denials on experiment logs, but Dr. Schmidt and myself feel the need to be abundantly clear in our response: **over our cold, dead bodies.**//-- Director Naismith

**Subject:** [[[SCP-2835]]]
**Interference Point:** Beginning
**Result:** The video begins without the usual opening sequence. SCP-2835-1 addresses the viewer directly, sobbing and visibly intoxicated, and yelling "Naismith, you goddamn snitching swiss cheese eating //whore!//" and variations thereof. A poorly-drawn SCP-3922-A instance in the background approaches, saying "Let's go, Paddy. We're only trying to help." SCP-2835-1 attempts suicide with a shotgun blast to the face, only to become mildly dazed, with stars circling his head. Video ends.
**Note:** Testing of SCP-2835 afterward, without the influence of SCP-3922, consisted of SCP-2835-1 spending the entirety of the video lamenting its inability to "people die, not just cartoon die." 

**Subject:** //Nineteen Eighty-Four// (1984), R
**Interference Point:** Beginning
**Result:** The film is extended to be 18 hours long, with a large army of SCP-3922-A invading and occupying Airstrip One. At 17 hours, all the Inner Party members, including Big Brother, are executed by SCP-3922-A instances via gunfire. An SCP-3922-A instance holds a speech in Victory Square, where they announce the occupation of the British Isles and the return of liberty and justice to the people of Great Britain and Ireland. They then prepare to invade the rest of the world; a montage of SCP-3922-A instances invade the rest of Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia, where their leaders are executed. The film ends with Winston Smith meeting Julia, and presumably falling in love.

**Subject:** A chronological recording of cutscenes from //The Binding Of Isaac: Afterbirth+//, 2017, M (ESRB)
**Interference Point:** Final cutscene
**Result:** The chest is opened to reveal an exhausted, emaciated Isaac, who looks up to see two SCP-3922-A instances scooping him out of his would-be tomb. A montage follows, chronicling Isaac being fed, given medical attention, and eventually thriving in a 3922-A-supervised foster home, while his mother is apprehended and subjected to an agonizing but ultimately effective regimen of in-patient psychotherapy. The last scene ends with Isaac in his mother's hospital room, the two of them hugging and smiling tearfully.
**Note:** On the day following this test, //Binding of Isaac// creator Edmund McMillen reported having had "the most wonderful dream" on his Twitter account, and reporting that the world felt "just a little brighter".

**Subject:** //The Last of Us: Story Version//, a YouTube video containing every cutscene from the 2013 video game //The Last of Us// (Rated M), excluding the "Left Behind" prequel DLC.
**Interference Point:** After Joel steps out of his apartment in the Boston quarantine zone. 
**Result:** SCP-3922-A instances invade the quarantine zone via armor and infantry storming the main entrance gate; city personnel surrender after two hours of intense fighting. Ellie is located by an SCP-3922-A instance, who uses an unknown medical device to extract the cure to the cordyceps infection while leaving her unharmed; meanwhile, Joel and Tess are arrested by other instances for smuggling unauthorized items into the quarantine zone. After developing the vaccine and inoculating everyone in the area, the remaining five hours show SCP-3922-A instances traveling across the post-apocalyptic landscape and terminating any infected or hostile survivors they find (the hunter-controlled Pittsburgh quarantine zone is obliterated via firebombing). End of the video shows SCP-3922-A instances arriving at the Firefly headquarters in Salt Lake City and informing them that their "unlawful actions will no longer be tolerated in restored civil society", implying they will attempt to bring all of the former United States under their control with their dissemination of the cure to the infection.

**Subject:** //La Jetée//, 1962, Not Rated
**Interference Point:** None.
**Result:** End credits are replaced with the phrase "☽☽☽ WE WILL FIND A WAY IN ☽☽☽"
**Note:** //Do not test this again. Let's be more careful about testing abstract narratives in the future.// - Dr. Naismith

**Subject:** //Metropolis//, 1927, Not Rated
**Interference Point:** During the scene in which the Robot Maria entices the Workers to rebellion.
**Result:** SCP-3922-A instances enter the area where the workers are congregated. The SCP-3922-A instances restrain and deactivate the Robot Maria, which puts up no resistance. The remaining Workers are forcibly dispersed, and the film cuts to SCP-3922-A arresting C.A. Rotwang for crimes including “kidnapping, assault, and the unlicensed creation of an artificial intelligence”, and Joh Fredersen is mentioned to have been deposed and imprisoned for “violation of multiple labor laws”. Both Maria and several members of the Workers receive fines for “inciting rebellion”, and the film ends 20 minutes early with the announcement that SCP-3922-A will be temporarily occupying Metropolis until civil order can be restored.
**Note:** All dialogue for the SCP-3922-A instances is rendered as intertitles, in the style of the original film.

**Subject:** //Sharknado//, 2013, Not Rated
**Interference Point:** [[[spc-2922|SPC-3922-A]]] first appears during the freeway scene, saving George. 
**Result:** SPC-3922-A are armed with boxing gloves instead of usual armaments. After the freeway scene, a SPC-3922-A instance will appear whenever a shark would bite someone. The instance will punch the shark. Punched sharks suffer no serious injuries, but usually swim out of the scene, rather than attacking. End credits includes statement "All sharks punched by ARMÁ ORÚN." 

**Subject:** //Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood//, 1970 episode, TV-G
**Interference Point:** At the beginning of the "Land of Make-Believe" segment
**Result:** Several puppet characters remark on the suspicious absence of Lady Elaine Fairchilde and the disappearance of her Museum-Go-Round. An instance of SCP-3922-A enters, carrying Lady Elaine's magical Boomerang-Toomerang-Zoomerang in a semitransparent containment capsule labeled "TACTICAL DEZOOMERANGIFICATION MATRIX". The instance explains to King Friday that Lady Elaine "has to move away for a while on business, but she wishes you all the best." The rest of the episode proceeds without SCP-3922-A interference. 
**Note:** Further review of the SCP-3922-altered footage at altered volumes revealed muffled sounds of a hostile gunfire exchange in the distance, along with the phrase //"Ya couldn't leave well enough alone, could ya, you Corbenese sons of--"// from Lady Elaine, interrupted by an explosion before the expletive.

**Subject:** //WCW Bash At The Beach// 1996, Unrated (professional wrestling)
**Interference Point:** After the conclusion of the main event
**Result:** The climax of the show proceeds as normal, with Hulk Hogan entering the ring to attack his presumptive allies and join forces with "outsiders" Scott Hall and Kevin Nash. As Hulk Hogan is delivering his famous "new world order of wrestling" speech to a rain of audience garbage, interviewer "Mean" Gene Okerlund deviates from his recorded questions and instead says, "Hulk, I'm sorry to have to say this, and I hope one day we can be friends again, but in WCW, there's only //one// order we respect." A brass-heavy theme plays in the arena, and ten unarmed SCP-3922-A instances emerge from the locker room entrance, marching towards the ring to thunderous applause from the audience and joyous exhortations from play-by-play commentator Tony Schiavone. Three instances recover the beaten Sting, Lex Luger, and Randy Savage, and assist them (as well as a visibly-crestfallen Okerlund) to the backstage area, while the others storm the ring to attack the newly-formed "New World Order". The SCP-3922-A instances conduct themselves as if they were extremely powerful wrestlers, obeying narrative conventions such as rebounding off the ring ropes when slung towards them by the "Irish Whip" maneuver. Nash and Hall are quickly overwhelmed by the SCP-3922-A assault, though Hogan manages to fight off four of the instances for several minutes before being rendered unconscious. The three are carried backstage for processing, while Schiavone celebrates "the inevitable hand of all justice", and the camera pans out over the crowd, where more SCP-3922-A instances can be seen handing citations for littering to numerous audience members.
**Note:** Color commentator Bobby Heenan does not speak for this entire sequence. Camera shots of the announcer's desk show Heenan sitting in anxious silence as an SCP-3922-A instance stands behind him, arms crossed.
//Further testing with professional wrestling recordings shows that 3922-A instances win their battles almost instantly, with the only competitors able to put up a fight being those who had significant creative influence over the product at the time, e.g. Hogan in mid-1990s WCW, Triple H in mid-2000s WWE, and El Santo in his entire EMLL run.[[footnote]]To date, El Santo holds the only pinfall victory over any 3922-A instance.[[/footnote]]// - Researcher Tranh

**Subject:**  //Barney the Dinosaur//, 1997 episode, TV-G
**Interference Point:** Start of episode
**Result:** The episode begins with Barney standing on an empty set with no other characters present. The actor inside the suit removes the headpiece revealing an SCP-3922-A instance. The instance then rotates a nearby whiteboard around with the following message.
 "Is the Foundation staffed by five year olds?  Playing this episode in the hopes of watching us vaporise Barney is inapropriate to say the least. Act befitting your station or playtime is over."
 The episode then comes to an end with the Three Moon sign on the screen.
 //They do have a point, I suggest we ease up on the kid cartoons and shows. -Researcher Maytus//

**Subject:** CCTV recording of a 24 year old man smoking a marijuana cigar ("blunt") outside of his Sacramento, California apartment on 9 Feb 2018.[[footnote]]To meet SCP-3922's criteria for fiction as established in the "Smokes McGee" test, a fictional narration for the footage and a false name ("Adrian Smith") for the individual were used.[[/footnote]] At the time of the footage and at present, consumption of recreational marijuana is legal in the state of California, but remains illegal under federal law as per the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.
**Interference Point:** After the man finishes smoking and puts out the marijuana cigar by pressing it against the concrete. 
**Result:** A single SCP-3922-A instance armed with an M16 rifle approaches the man, addressing him as "Mr. Smith." After the man expresses alarm, the instance explains that it is only there to inform the man that smoking marijuana is a violation of federal law and to dispose of his cigar in the nearby dumpster. When the man replies that consumption is legal under state law, the instance hands him a small piece of paper and explains that the Three Moons Initiative is currently "conflicted as to what action to take in this circumstance" and that he will not face legal consequences as a result. The instance then reminds the man that littering is illegal under California law and to always dispose of his discarded smoking materials in proper trash receptacles after extinguishing them before walking away. 
**Note:** Conflicting laws appear to produce an uncertain and/or confused response from SCP-3922-A.

**Subject:** //Final Fantasy Tactics//, 1997, T (ESRB) (full playthrough recorded)
**Interference Point:** Opening cutscene
**Result:** Ovelia opens the scene by saying "☽☽☽, please help us sinful children of Ivalice". Then, the screen scrolls down to reveal Agrias, Ramza and Delita in the monastery with her, all wearing a helmetless variant of SCP-3922-A armor. Agrias waxes enthusiastic about the Order of the Triple Moon, who arrived one year prior and swiftly placed Ivalice under martial law, pursuant to exterminating the "Lucavi infestation". Other topics discussed by the three include the mass-arrest of the Corpse Brigade, the ongoing recovery of Ramza's father, and concern as to how their friend Algus is handling the execution of Marquis Elmdor. Then, two more SCP-3922-A instances enter and remove their helmets, revealing themselves to be Wiegraf and Miluda Folles. The siblings politely inform the others that it is time to escort Ovelia home and begin patrol. The rest of the recording resembles basic gameplay, with the party of five traveling around the map and occasionally fighting parties of archaeodemons, implied to be the remnants of some brief, massive struggle. All five characters have the class "☽☽☽ Knight", and use battlefield-spanning attacks like "Pacifica Gun" and "All-Holy2" to dispatch their foes swiftly. There are no further cutscenes.

**Subject:** [[[SCP-2030]]], Season 24, Episode "Swelling", 2000, Not Rated
**Interference Point:** Beginning of first prank segment
**Result:** 5 seconds after the beginning of the park prank segment, the screen turns white and a sound similar to that of a high-yield nuclear explosion is audible, before the end title card plays. Analysis of the preceding frame shows a projectile superficially similar to a Scranton Reality Anchor round from [[[SCP-2117]]] heading towards the ground at high velocity.

**Subject:** //Moana//, 2016, PG
**Interference Point:** The scene where Maui leaves Moana on an island and steals her boat 
**Result:** A helicopter with two SCP-3922-A instances hovers over Maui. One instance goes onto the boat and picks up Maui, taking him into custody. The Ocean then returns the boat to the island, where a helicopter has rescued Moana.

**Subject:** "The Cold Equations" (episode of //The New Twilight Zone//), 1989, TV-PG
**Interference Point:** Beginning
**Result:** A scene is added in which Marilyn is shown approaching the EDS. She is intercepted by armed instances of SCP-3922-A; they explain to her that if she stows away, the EDS will not have sufficient fuel to complete its vital mission, and that Captain Barton will be required to eject her into space to die. Marilyn is horrified, and does not board the EDS. The rest of the episode depicts Captain Barton successfully completing his mission to deliver medical supplies to the colony planet.

**Subject:** //Breaking Bad//, Season 2 Episode 9 "4 Days Out", 2009, TV-14
**Interference Point:** After Jesse Pinkman calls Skinny Pete a second time and learns that the latter is unable to find where he and Walt are stranded at in the desert. 
**Result:** Two helicopters with the Three Moons insignia on them approach Jesse, Walt, and the RV from a distance. After touching down, four SCP-3922-A instances emerge from a helicopter, two of which immediately arrest Jesse and Walt for manufacturing a controlled substance. The other two inspect the meth lab inside the RV and confiscate the recently created product. After being treated for dehydration, Jesse and Walt are transported to the Albuquerque Metropolitan Detention Center as an SCP-3922-A instance calls a disbelieving Hank Schrader and informs him that his brother-in-law is Heisenberg. The remainder of the episode depicts the consequences of Walt's public exposure: Hank angrily interrogates an arrogant and defiant Walt, resulting in the two nearly coming to blows. Starting at the halfway point of the episode, a separate subplot chronicles Saul Goodman's law firm being shut down for his illegal activities, though Saul himself manages to evade capture by either SCP-3922-A instances or the police and vanishes from Albuquerque. Closing shot of the episode depicts Walt coldly staring at a conflicted Hank through his prison cell doors after delivering a monologue in which he revealed his role in the death of Tuco Salamanca. 
**Note:** Gus Fring, Mike Ehrmantraut, and other law-breaking characters introduced later in the series are absent from the episode and apparently remain undetected by SCP-3922-A.

**Subject:** A recording of a playthrough of //Doki Doki Literature Club!//, 2017, Not Rated.
**Interference Point:** The day before the festival, right after Sayori's confession.
**Result:** SCP-3922-A instances appeared as character sprites just before the day is supposed to fade out, signaling the end of the scene. Dialog is consistent with vocalizations made in previous tests. A series of scenes from the main character's point of view show SCP-3922-A stopping Sayori's suicide attempt and placing her in therapy, arresting Natsuki's father on charges of child abuse and neglect and transferring the aforementioned girl to a foster care system, confiscating Yuri's knife collection and admitting her to a mental hospital, and using weapons marked as "CODE ERSR" to quickly dispatch Monika. The end card then immediately fades onto screen, displaying the message "Feel better."
**Notes:** Acts 2, 3, and 4 are completely absent through use of SCP-3922.

**Subject:** //Adam Sandler Sucks and I Hope You All Die//,[[footnote]]A film produced by ██████ ██████, a known member of the Group of Interest "[[[are we cool yet hub|Are We Cool Yet?]]]". While the plot of the film appears to be a romantic comedy, the film's set design contains symbols that act as lethal cognitohazards, seemingly added for no other purpose than to kill the viewer.[[/footnote]] 2018, Not Rated.
**Interference Point:** The first scene at the office, wherein the unnamed main character meets his love interest. 
**Result:** The cognitohazardous mural in the backround of the scene has been painted over by a non-hazardous mural featuring the "☽☽☽" symbol. Other cognitohazardous images have been similarly censored throughout the movie. Plot proceeds as normal.
**Notes:** Later on in the film, the main character's father is shown reading a newspaper featuring the headline "██████ ██████ Apprehended by ☽☽☽, Death Sentence Expected".

**Subject:** //Better Call Saul//, Season 1 Episode 2 "Mijo", 2015, TV-14
**Interference Point:** After Jimmy McGill (Saul Goodman) and Tuco Salamanca shake hands in agreement on the skateboarding twins' punishment for insulting Tuco's grandmother. 
**Result:** Before Tuco has a chance to break the twins' legs, a helicopter similar to the one seen in the previous //Breaking Bad// test approaches the scene. Tuco is executed via a long-range sniper rifle shot to the head; No-Doze and Gonzo are killed and Nacho is seriously injured as they return fire. After the helicopter touches down, an SCP-3922-A instance begins treating Nacho for his gunshot wounds while other instances interrogate Jimmy and the skateboarders. Although initially planning to arrest all three of them for "financially motivated confidence scams," Jimmy successfully persuades the 3922-A instances to not take any action, arguing that he saved the twins from a worse punishment from Tuco and that they are "so scared of you that they won't even think about jaywalking for the rest of their lives". Additionally, he claims his attempted scam of the Kettlemans was "my homage to Robin Hood" and that he planned to donate their embezzled money to a local charity after stealing it. The 3922-A instances let all three of them off with a stern warning to "refrain from any future criminal activities, even with altruistic motivations" and exit the scene after loading Nacho into the helicopter via a stretcher. 
**Notes:** No SCP-3922-A instances demonstrate recollection of the previous //Breaking Bad// test. Additionally, this marks the first known occurrence of 3922-A instances reneging on their planned punishment after persuasion from a character.

**Result:** Two SCP-3922-A instances armed with advanced weaponry raid the hotel room and arrest Bird before she can shoot Roy, who is horrified to learn of her actual intentions when they are explained to him by the instances. After Bird is placed in a psychiatric hospital, the remainder of the film depicts Roy's successful career as a pitcher for the Chicago Cubs. At the end, he throws a perfect game to close out a World Series win over the New York Yankees, striking out "The Whammer" (a stand-in for Babe Ruth) for the 27th and final out.

**Interference Point:** The scene where Chiaki Nanami is first thrown into the death maze
**Result:** SCP-3922-A instances, possessing full knowledge of the maze's structure through unknown means, establish communication with Chiaki through an earpiece (absent in the original), guiding her as she navigates the maze and warning her of any traps. The screen in which Class 77-B is watching Chiaki's torture is destroyed by gunshot, and other SCP-3922-A instances storm the room they are in to rescue them, while Junko Enoshima and Mukuro Ikusaba are terminated with extreme prejudice by sniper fire. At the 17 minute mark, Chiaki successfully makes it out of the maze through a secret exit, and meets her classmates again. Izuru Kamukura and Chisa Yukizome, lobotomized in a previous episode, are subjected into 'neural recalibration', hinting at their return to their previous personalities.

**Result:** During the course of the film, instances of SCP-3922-A are seen in the background, hidden from the characters, including the omnipresent Ghosts of Past, Present, and Future. Before the end credits, as Scrooge sits at his desk, an instance of SCP-3922-A approaches him, holding a letter. After a cry of alarm from Scrooge, he reluctantly accepts it. The SCP-3922-A instance then leaves the room. After Scrooge opens the letter, the camera cuts to its contents, which detail that while Scrooge's actions were legal, the morality of said actions prompted them to observe and eventually capture him. However, due to recent events coming to light, the arrest was called off, in favor of "letting you redeem yourself, you've suffered enough as it is." The film ends with the camera zooming in on the "☽☽☽" signature at the bottom of the letter.
**Note:** Morals appear to play a factor in determining if instances of SCP-3922-A will carry out the arrest and punishment for an individual's crimes, even if they are considered legal.

**Subject:** //The LEGO Movie//, 2014, PG
**Interference Point:** Opening scene in which Lord Business acquires the Kragle.
**Result:** The battle is interrupted by instances of SCP-3922-A portrayed as LEGO minifigures. They apprehend Lord Business and confiscate the Kragle. The scene then cuts to the basement of The Man Upstairs. Human SCP-3922-A instances are holding the man at gunpoint while their leader collects the bottle of glue and Lord Business minifigure, explaining to The Man Upstairs that the toy is a tyrant who is to be punished for his crimes. SCP-3922-A instances then exit. The Man Upstairs expresses extreme confusion to the events.
**Note:** We don't really understand what happened, but the unaltered version of the movie wasn't much clearer.

**Interference Point:** Eight hours into the video.
**Result:** The girl in the video is tapped on the shoulder by an SCP-3922-A instance to her surprise, causing her to remove her headphones which stops the music. Out of shot, the SCP-3922-A instance briefly lectures the girl on the dangers of prolonged work, telling her that while studying is important, doing so for such lengthy periods of time can be hazardous to one's physical and mental health. The remainder of the video stays on a shot of the girl's empty desk while quiet snoring and rainfall can be heard in the background.
**Note:** The video continued for several hours after interference, with ambient nighttime noises being the only audio for the remainder of the recording.

**Interference Point:** Opening scene, during the family's encounter with the police officer.
**Result:** The Police officer is replaced by an SCP-3922-A instance, who questions where the family is going. After being informed of their destination at the Valley Lodge, they direct them to an alternate route that will get them there more quickly. The remainder of the film is dedicated to the SCP-3922-A instances assaulting the compound where The Master's cult resides. The Master is seen using several anomalous abilities which would have been impossible to render with film technology circa 1966, but is eventually shot in the medulla by a sniper using beryllium-bronze rounds. Torgo is taken into custody, and the Master's wives are all freed. The final scene shows the family enjoying their vacation at the Valley Lodge.

**Subject:** //Mystery Science Theater 3000// Season 4, Episode 24 ("Manos: the Hands of Fate")
**Interference Point:** During the invention exchange.
**Result:** Several instances of SCP-3922-A enter Deep 13 and apprehend Dr. Forrester and TV's Frank; the equipment used by these instances, while identical in function, appears to have been adjusted to fit the hand-made aesthetic of much of the show's props. On the Satellite of Love, Joel Robinson, Tom Servo, and Crow appear confused as a ship piloted by SCP-3922-A instances appear on Rocket #9's camera. The instances offer to return them to the Gizmonic institute. Joel and the bots agree they want to riff on the film, even if they are not being forced to do so. Episode largely proceeds as normal (with the first Host Segment after the film starts being replaced with Joel and the bots expressing confusion as to the nature of the SCP-3922-A instances), with no changes to the version of //Manos: the Hands of Fate// playing within this episode.

An SCP-3922-A instance is shown inside the Venture Star announcing that the human colony on Pandora is being shut down for blatant violations of native rights and environmental protection laws. The film switches to show Hell's Gate being destroyed by a nuclear explosion. The film then shows a scene in a classroom revealing that the previous events were part of a history lesson being taught by an SCP-3922-A instance. The SCP-3922-A instance explains that shortly after the Resources Development Administration was forcibly shut down, scientists discovered a new type of environmentally clean room-temperature superconductor that could be created on earth much more cheaply than unobtainium could be shipped from other planets. The SCP-3922-A instance notes that afterwards humans and Na'vi had lived peacefully with no further conflicts of any sort happening between them. The film abruptly ends. 
**Note:** //This and the 'Brave Little Toaster' test seem to show that human interactions with nonhumans are under SCP-3922-A's jurisdiction.// - Researcher Grooms.

**Interference Point:** The Eclipse, just before the scene where Griffith activates the Crimson Behelit charm to summon the God Hand
**Result:** Several SCP-3922-A dropships descend on the scene. An SCP-3922-A sniper tags the Behelit with a magnetic charge labeled "BEHELITIC INTERFERENCE ORDINANCE." The Behelit forms a smiling face that proudly sings the opening lines of //Homo Sapiens Invcitus// (Anthem of the ☽☽☽ Initiative), causing Griffith to disappear. SCP-3922-A troops forcibly escort the remaining members of the Band of the Hawk to safety. The leader of the detachment, identifying herself as General Spiegel, offers a statement to the bewildered survivors: "Provisional aid will be supplied for the time being, however, more time will be needed to prepare for wider-scale corrective action in Midland and the surrounding jurisdictions, on the grounds that -- pardon my Kushan -- I have no fucking idea where to start with this hellhole."  
**Note:** The DVD of the episode included a special "Deleted Scenes" section, along with a new scene labeled "Dinner with the Kids," consisting of a six-hour cut of JALAKÅRA feeding Griffith to several thousand unidentified arachnoid entities.

**Subject:** //Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood//, Episode 4 “An Alchemist's Anguish”, 2009, TV-PG
**Interference Point:** Beginning of the recording
**Result:** A small group of SCP-3922-A instances appear at the Gate of Alchemy where they encounter ‘Truth’, an omnipotent being in the show. Confused at first, the instances approach the entity and ask why they have arrived there instead of their chosen destination. Truth proceeds to explain that all set events occurring in its reality are governed by strict laws of exchange,[[footnote]]Reflecting the show's major themes of 'equivalent exchange' regarding the rules of Alchemy[[/footnote]] and that even if they were to prevent harm from occurring, this would ensure that equal suffering and injustice would transpire elsewhere, ultimately making their efforts pointless. The scene then cuts to the instances leaving, appearing dissatisfied.
**Note:** Testing with the original 2003 episode produced near-identical results.

**Subject:** //Father Ted//, Episode 1 Season 1 "Good Luck, Father Ted", April 25 1995, 
**Interference Point:** Following Father Jack's flashback
**Result:** Five SCP-3922-A instances enter into the home of Father Ted, Dougal, and Jack, declaring they intend to arrest the latter for "inappropriate behavior around underage girls and excessive drinking." Both Dougal and Ted glance at one another and leave the room as the SCP-3922-A instances approach Jack. The camera cuts to Fathers Ted and Dougal outside, running from the house as Father Jack is heard loudly exclaiming "FECK OFF!" Two instances of SCP-3922-A are subsequently hurled out the living room window, and signs of a violent struggle from within the house are obvious. After ten minutes, all five instances - one of which is carrying a bottle of whiskey - leave the house, in various states of disarray and heavily wounded, pursued by an enraged Father Jack. Episode length is extended to over three hours, during which Craggy Island is occupied by SCP-3922-A instances in increasing numbers, who conduct a manhunt for Father Jack. John and Mary O'Leary are arrested for repeated attempted murder, and Father Ted is investigated on suspicion of illegal activities but cleared of charges. After this, both Dougal and Ted meagerly protest the occupation with the placards bearing the phrases "CAREFUL NOW" and "DOWN WITH THIS SORT OF THING."[[footnote]]Identical to the ones depicted in "The Passion of Saint Tibulus"[[/footnote]] At the end of the episode, the commander of the SCP-3922-A instances is shown in the house, investigating Father Jack's room. Upon finding several bottles of whiskey which are ordered confiscated, Father Jack is heard shouting "GET THE FECK AWAY FROM MY DRINK!" before crashing through the upper window and viciously assaulting the SCP-3922-A instances. It is unknown what the outcome of the engagement was.

**Interference Point:** When Lutze arrives at Dachau camp.
**Result:** Several SCP-3922-A instances can be observed in the background, preparing to gain entry into the camp. However, once Becker confronts Lutze and closes the gates, SCP-3922-A ceases attempts and instead watches the events and were even observed to unfold seats and exchange popcorn, with no other interference, save for jeering at Lutze when he tried to leave the camp. At the end of the credits, the following message was produced: "THE TRIAL AND SENTENCING OF CAPTAIN GUNTHER LUTZE HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE ☽☽☽ INITIATIVE!"

**Subject:** //Robert Novak's Car Accident//, 2019, not Rated. A Foundation-made dramatization of the life of political columnist Robert Novak (1931-2009), focusing on the 2008 incident in which Novak did not stop after having struck a pedestrian with his car; two days later, as a direct result of this incident, physicians examined Novak and discovered that he had a malignant brain tumor which was interfering with his vision.
**Interference Point:** Beginning
**Result:** As Novak prepares to leave his home on the morning of the incident, he is intercepted by five armed instances of SCP-3922-A, who confiscate his car keys and explain that his friends and relatives are concerned about his health and safety. The instances lead Novak through a series of field neurological tests, at the end of which a weeping Novak concedes that his ability to process visual input is no longer sufficient to enable him to drive safely. The instances then deliver Novak to a local hospital for diagnosis and treatment. Novak tells them that "just because you helped me doesn't mean I'm going to let you get away with anything," then promises to investigate them and expose any corruption he finds; the instances tell him that they would welcome this. A montage then depicts scenes from the next 13 months of Novak's life: unsuccessful medical procedures, reconciliations with political and professional foes, and the publication of his final column, in which he reluctantly states that he was unable to find any evidence of malfeasance from "those Three Moons bastards".

**Subject:** //Deadpool//, February 8 2016, R
**Interference Point:** N/A
**Result:** N/A
**Note:** //No, no, and again no. As amusing as this would be, let's be clear: Deadpool as a character is aware of the fourth wall. He knows he's in a narrative. SCP-3922 invades narratives. I don't want to even risk giving someone as psychotic as Wade Wilson the ability to travel between narratives. Yes, I know about Deadpool: Killustrated, but that was written with the express purpose of exploring said concept. This, on the other hand, runs the risk of giving a self-aware character free will. And that could only ever result in pure and utter chaos.// - Director Naismith.

**Subject:** Music video for "We Are Number One," a song from the children's television show "LazyTown."
**Interference Point:** When Robbie Rotten, disguised as an elderly woman, gives Sportacus an apple.
**Result:** Two SCP-3922-A instances arrive.  One apprehends and arrests Robbie Rotten, and the other confiscates the apple and explains to Sportacus that the apple would have rendered him unconscious, allowing Robbie and his cohorts to capture him.  More SCP-3992-A instances arrive, having detained Bobbie, Tobbie, and Flobbie[[footnote]]The three Robbie Rotten lookalikes featured in the video.[[/footnote]].  Throughout this exchange, the instrumental for the song continues playing.  How the apple would have been able to render Sportacus unconscious is unmentioned, and Robbie is only arrested for attempted kidnapping.
**Note:** Perhaps the music video was sufficiently edited so that SCP-3922 considered it a separate narrative from "Robbie's Dream Team" and the rest of "LazyTown."

**Subject:** A recording of //Toy Story 2//, 1999, taken in a movie theater.
**Interference Point:** When Al steals Woody.
**Result:** Instances of SCP-3922-A pursue Al in a vehicle resembling a police car, bearing the ☽☽☽ insignia.  Al pulls over and is arrested for petty theft.  Woody is returned to Andy's mother.  The film ends.

**Subject:** A recording of //Toy Story 2//, 1999.  This recording was taken in a room that was decorated to appear as a movie theater, with Foundation personnel playing the roles of the patrons.
**Interference Point:** Beginning of the film.
**Result:** An instance of SCP-3922-A steps in front of the personnel holding the camera, confiscates it, reminds him that recording in a movie theater is illegal, and turns off the camera.
**Note:** SCP-3922 seemed to consider the recording of //Toy Story 2// as the narrative, rather than the plot of the movie being recorded.

**Subject:** //Blazing Saddles//, February 7 1974, R
**Interference Point:** After Taggert and his posse raid Rock Ridge.
**Result:** Several SCP-3922-A instances attempt to arrest Hedley Lamarr and Taggart as the two discuss getting a new sheriff for Rock Ridge. However, director Mel Brooks, current age as of this writing, bursts through the door, bearing a stack of documents. The following exchange ensues.
> **Brooks:** Hold it! Hold everything! Stop right there!
> 
> **SCP-3922-A Commander:** Pardon me, this is- wait a minute. You're Mel Brooks!
> 
> **Brooks:** You bet your ass I am, and you're all breaking the terms of this contract!

> **SCP-3922-A:** I... I beg your pardon?
> 
> //Brooks hands the documents to the SCP-3922-A instances. They examine the documents thoroughly, unfolding several pages in various directions. Finally, the bewildered commander of the SCP-3922-A turns to Brooks.//
> 
> **SCP-3922-A Commander:** My apologies. We weren't aware of this.
> 
> **Brooks:** Could you hand it back? I'm not done just yet.
> 
> //SCP-3922-A does as instructed. Mel Brooks proceeds to face the camera and holds up a document, revealing the signatories of several individuals, including the Founder of the Foundation.//[[footnote]]Analysis has confirmed it to be genuine.[[/footnote]]
> 
> **Brooks:** You guys out there see this, right? Know what this means? It means you aren't allowed to ever conduct experiments on my films! Got that? Good.
> 
> //Brooks turns to the SCP-3922-A instances//
> 
> **Brooks:** You're all free to go!
All SCP-3922-A instances leave sheepishly, to the confusion of Lamarr and Taggart. The film resumes after Brooks leaves, with no changes.

Cliff Weismeyer is retrieved from the well and resuscitated while Cook and Landis are arrested on multiple charges. After SCP-3922-A instances finish beating Griffin, he is subsequently shot dead.
**Note:** //Ouch.// - Researcher Goodwill

**Subject:** Justin Timberlake's "//TKO//" music video, 2013, Explicit lyrics
**Interference Point:** Nearing the end of the video.
**Result:** While Justin Timberlake is dragged through the sand by a car, several SCP-3922-A instances ran after it, and when the girl bailed out of the car, one instance of SCP-3922-A jumped into the car then turned off the engine, then the other instances of SCP-3922-A untied the rope then picked up Justin Timberlake to take him back to safety. The one instance of SCP-3922-A turned the engine back on then jumped out of the car, following the other SCP-3922-A instances; the video continues normally with the car getting off the cliff.

**Subject:** A recording of a playthrough of //Pokémon Red//, 1997, E (ESRB).
**Interference Point:** Mt. Moon
**Result:** Instead of Team Rocket Grunts, there are now sprites resembling SCP-3922-A. Said individuals do not fight Red, instead only offering advice to the player that in real life they should not partake in animal cruelty, and avoid behavior featured in the game such as wandering in remote locations without proper equipment. Later in the game it is made clear that SCP-3922-A have taken down Team Rocket, with cities that had a heavy presence of said crime syndicate such as Celadon, Saffron and Lavender being placed under martial law, and leader Giovanni being replaced in the Viridian City Gym with a man named Paolo. The Game Corner which hid Team Rocket's headquarters has been replaced with a ☽☽☽ Initiative Laboratory, featuring a gift shop offering the same Pokémon that could be won at the original game and posters against gambling. New battles are found in Cerulean City - the burgled house, which has not been ramsacked, features a trainer who upon defeat gives TM28 - and the Pokémon Tower - with the Marowak mother never murdered, she, along with her Cubone son, is instead being trained by Mr. Fuji. The guards who opened the gates to Saffron by being bribed with drinks are seen in a prison building, and Trainers of the Burglar class cannot be found in the game. Another major difference is that the game only features 150 Pokémon, ending with Mew - who can be captured at Cerulean Cave - because, as revealed once Red discovers a still-intact Pokémon Mansion that serves as a four floor Cinnabar Gym, SCP-3922-A shut down the illegal genetic experiments that created Mewtwo.

**Subject:** //Cannibal Holocaust//, 7 Feburary 1980, R
**Interference Point:** Unknown
**Result:** A still image of ☽☽☽ Initiative logo covered the onscreen, with the phrase //Lasciate ogni speranza voi ch'entrate//[[footnote]] Italian for 'Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.' [[/footnote]] underneath. Examination of audio revealed there to be retching, gunfire, sobbing, and various people speaking and yelling in Italian. Several still frames were found upon examination of the footage, depicting [REDACTED]. Notably, at the end of the film, a recording of the trial of director Deodato is played, though all civil servants are replaced by instances of SCP-3922-A. Deodato is cleared of murder charges.
**Note:** //Jesus. That was brutal.// - Researcher Goodwill
//For all animal lovers in the personnel, please, don't watch this tape. You've heard of what happened to the animals when this was being filmed, I cannot stress enough that it isn't much better here either. If anyone needs me, I'll be scrubbing my eyeballs. Metaphorically.// - Director Naismith

**Subject:** //Star Trek: Voyager,// Season 2, Episode 24 ("Tuvix")
**Interference Point:** Shortly before Captain Janeway sends Tuvix to the transporter room to be separated into his component individuals.
**Result:** Six (6) armed SCP-3922-A instances 'materialize' aboard Voyager's bridge with the same transporter effect used in the series. The ship's Red Alert is activated. The bridge crew are apprehended after a brief shootout with the SCP-3922-A instances, notably fainting dramatically upon being hit instead of vaporizing as expected from a high-powered energy rifle. Captain Janeway is imprisoned for attempted murder on a planet the narrator refers to as Corbenic.[[footnote]]The painted styrofoam rocks, among other set design elements, indicate this is not the real Corbenic[[/footnote]] Tuvix continues his combined duties aboard Voyager, with Chakotay becoming acting Captain. The SCP-3922 end title card's slogan is replaced with "The ends do not justify the means."
**Note:** This is the first instance of the ☽☽☽ Initiative's home planet being depicted, albeit fictitiously.

Afterwards, the two use the Übercharge to kill a multitude of BLU Soldiers. || Upon stepping outside, Medic is almost immediately attacked and arrested for practicing medicine without a license. ||
|| //Meet the Pyro// || The RED Pyro burns the members of BLU Team alive, intercut with scenes from their point of view. The scenes from Pyro’s perspective are far more lighthearted, including rainbows, giant lollipops, unicorns, etc. || The Pyro is immediately tackled from behind by SCP-3922 instances, and admitted to an insane asylum. ||

**Interference Point:** When Dan Backslide kidnaps Dora Standpipe
**Result:** As Dan Backslide approaches Dora, a SCP-3922-A instance comes onto the screen and prepares to apprehend him, only for the action to pause as the old man in a one piece bathing suit passes by. Once he exits, Dan proceeds to grab Dora and pulls both her and the tree into the car, only to later return to pry Dora from the tree once he realizes what has happened. Throughout this, SCP-3922-A remains motionless, though it can be observed blinking. Cartoon proceeds as normal until the ending when it cuts back to the SCP-3922-A instance, with the narrator asking “So, you gonna move buddy?” SCP-3922-A instance proceeds to stand up straight, face the camera, bow, and then walks off in the same manner as the old man.
