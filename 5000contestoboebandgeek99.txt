Our team just got put on the 5000 project. Seems pretty big. But maybe it just seems big to me because of the way that number is represented in our counting system. Still, something about it seems significant. And of course it might be renumbered later, so who knows. 
@@@@
Specifically, we're working on chronicling the destruction of Site-27 on the 19th and all that entails. Yeah, that whole mess. Ramsey said she wants me to take point on the documentation this time. If I had to guess why, I bet she's got like five projects that she's been asked to put on the back burner to focus on this and you know her, she doesn't like to leave things unfinished. Ramsey always says "start with that which you know to be certain" and we're still in the dark about a lot of this, so I'm starting with the Chao interview. It just happened, I was there, and I know Al slightly better than most. From there I'll probably go through the other GOI statements, figure out how we as a Foundation define it, etc. etc. Shouldn't be too hard.
@@@@
Daily Thoughts:
- How are SCPs numbered?
- What's so special about 5000? Is there anything special with 5000?

> **Addendum 5000.1:** Interview with Al Chao
> 
>> **Interviewed:** PoI-2149, "Al Chao"
>> 
>> **Interviewer:** Dr. Martina Ramsey
>> 
>> **Foreword:** Chao reached out to the Foundation following the events that occurred at Site-27 on 1/19/2037. Dr. Lupe De La Cruz was also present for this interview, having had prior experience with Chao.
>> 
>> **<Begin Log>**
>> 
>> **Dr. Ramsey:** Miss Alison Chao, thank you for-
>> 
>> **PoI-2149:** I'd prefer "Al," if you don't mind. And no mister, miss... bleh. None of that... whatever that is.
>> 
>> **Dr. Ramsey:** Very well then. Thank you for reaching out to us, Al. Your insight will no doubt prove valuable as we try to unravel the events of January 19th.
>> 
>> **PoI-2149:** Sure. Though I'm not sure just how valuable my testimony will actually be, I wasn't there for much of it. So what do you want to know?
>> 
>> **Dr. Ramsey:** Why don't you start with an account of what you witnessed, in your own words.
>> 
>> **PoI-2149:** So basically, I had just arrived on the scene, on that plateau overlooking your site. Site... twenty-nine?
>> 
>> **Dr. Ramsey:** Twenty-seven.
>> 
>> **PoI-2149:** Damn it, so close! In any case, from my vantage point I could see a bunch of people. You know, of course there were gocks, C-Is, some people who I can only assume were with the Hand. And of course, some of your guys were milling about outside. They were closest to the building.
>> 
>> **Dr. Ramsey:** Did you see how many?
>> 
>> **PoI-2149:** Of your people? I dunno, I didn't get a good headcount. Maybe about twenty? About ten researcher-looking-dudes and a few more of the scary agent guys. The, um, the task force guys. There were fewer of those guys though. Sorry, I'm not really sure.
>> 
>> **Dr. Ramsey:** That's alright. Please continue.
>> 
>> **PoI-2149:** Well, I had just gotten a quick look over everything and decided this was none of my business when it happened. The whole building just... @@[@@//They make a motion with both hands, rising and than going out.//@@]@@ Pwoof! Exploded. Let me tell ya, seeing an explosion in real life? So much different than in a movie. Or on TV, like, Mythbusters or some shit. It stays with you. After that... I mean, I dunno, I panicked. I got the fuck out of there, as fast as I possibly could. Probably not the best look. But yeah, that's basically what happened.
>> 
>> **Dr. Ramsey:** Can you tell me when all of this happened?
>> 
>> **PoI-2149:** I arrived at the plateau a few minutes after 7:00, maybe 7:10. So the actual explosion must've been around 7:15 I guess? Maybe a few minutes after?
>> 
>> **Dr. Ramsey:** Now, mis- Al, we have intel that you have some connection to the group known to us only as "The Black Queen."
>> 
>> **PoI-2149:** Come on, you know I'm not going to talk about that.
>> 
>> **Dr. Ramsey:** We're just wondering if The Black Queen knew this would happen. Why were you there in the first place?
>> 
>> **PoI-2149:** Are you implying I had something to do with the explosion? @@[@@//They turn to Dr. De La Cruz//@@]@@ Come on, Lupe, you know I wouldn't do anything like this.
>> 
>> **Dr. Ramsey:** Please, Al, we don't believe you had anything-
>> 
>> **PoI-2149:** I may not always agree with the Foundation, but I wouldn't do this!
>> 
>> **Dr. Ramsey:** Alright, Al, let me ask the question another way: what were you doing there? Why were you there right at the moment of destruction?
>> 
>> **PoI-2149:** @@[@@//They look around the room, then sigh.//@@]@@ Look, even if The Black Queen exists, which I can't confirm or deny, I'm not a part of them. And even if I was, I wouldn't have gotten information about that day from them. A bunch of anomaly-related groups converging on one spot is bound to draw attention from anybody who knows what to look for. I was just there to ensure the safety of one person.
>> 
>> **Dr. Ramsey:** ...And?
>> 
>> **PoI-2149:** He wasn't there. All good.
>> 
>> **Dr. Ramsey:** Alright. Before we end this interview, is there anything else you can tell us about that day?
>> 
>> **PoI-2149:** Let me think... Actually, yeah, there was one thing. I just remembered, there was somebody there with like, a large old-timey camera set up facing the building. I thought they were with the Hand at first, but come to think of it they weren't with the other Hand people. I don't know if that means anything, but...
>> 
>> **Dr. Ramsey:** We'll look into that. Thank you for coming in today, your insight is invaluable. Please, let us know if there's anything else you remember.
>> 
>> **<End Log>**
>> 
>> **Closing Statement:** Chao was released without incident. At this time, Chao has made no further attempts to reach out to the Foundation

@@@@
Al has given me a good baseline to work with. I feel bad about Ramsey ambushing them about the Black Queen stuff. Al is the only connection we have to the Black Queen, but it doesn't seem like they even know anything about her. Them. That group. Whatever.
@@@@
Moving on from that tangent, I've been given access to a GOC memo shared with the Foundation. Hopefully, this will begin to patch up the holes in Al's testimony. I'll add that to the article and be well on my way to finishing this thing.

Daily Thoughts:
- Which is more trustworthy, the eyewitness account of an individual who was there, or a memo from a large organization whose compiler was nowhere close to the incident?
- Which is more trustworthy, the testimony of a close friend who may wish to show themself in a certain light, or the account of an organization with a very specific agenda to push?

Awesome! We have a precise time now. Although it's a little weird that Al didn't mention the containment breach. In any case, thanks to the insight from the GOC, we have a more precise timeline. Still trying to get my hands on the camera. For now I'm gonna fill in details.

Well that throws a wrench in things. Implosion? Both Al and the GOC said that it was an explosion. It sounds like they're taking credit for something they know nothing about. But both Al and the GOC were also under the impression that they were there, so... what gives?
@@@@
We finally got our hand on the camera, and confirmation from two GOIs that one of the photos was taken at the exact time of destruction ("That Which Will Show The Truth"), so im- or ex-plosion, we should be able to figure this out soon enough.

Great news, by which I mean terrible news: the camera is anomalous. Figured as much when I finally saw the damn photos yesterday. We're trying to get in touch with Serpent's Hand, see if they'll be willing to explain what it does, because our experiments have yielded no useful results. Sometimes it changes the photo, sometimes it doesn't, and we only have one instance of it removing something from a photo. It usually just adds.

Whatever, I need to focus on the CI statement we got. Ramsey's been a bit more serious about me finishing this one lately. I can't tell why. Maybe with this statement can finally get an explanation as to what happened.

I definitely deserved that. I just need to finish this stupid document and be done. Ramsey and I are both looking haggard. We haven't even seen anyone in ages.

Daily Thoughts:
- Im a terrible friend
- I cant stop until I figure this out

> **Description:** SCP-5000 refers to the --destruction-- --disappearance-- loss of Site-27 on January 19th, 2038. The Foundation suffered --few-- --many-- --at least 13?-- an unknown number of casualties. Procuring and containing the information surrounding this event has proven difficult due to --the anomalous nature of-- --conflicting reports-- --a misunderstanding-- inconsistencies in the --event-- --testimonies-- --goddamned photo evidence-- understanding of the event.
> 
> SCP-5000-1 is a camera that produces anomalous photographs. --SCP-5000-1 shows the truth.-- --SCP-5000-1 only adds to images and does not take away, except for that time it redacted an image in the weirdest possible way.-- SCP-5000-1 was discovered --after-- --during-- in connection to the events comprising SCP-5000, and was --recovered-- --stolen?-- --given to us by?-- retrieved from the Serpent's Hand.
> 
> SCP-5000-2 is an as of yet unidentified anomaly that --escaped containment-- --was jailbroken by the SH?-- --never existed?-- breached Foundation custody --before-- --after-- around the time of the loss of Site-27
> 
> Site-27 is --in ruins-- --fine-- --exploded-- --imploded-- --both at once?-- --actually Site-01-- gone for now.

Ramsey and I haven't heard from the higher-ups in weeks. Does that mean we're off the hook?
@@@@
Daily Thoughts:
- If the overseer council is dead I can just go home and forget about all of this
- If the overseer council is dead who's been running the Foundation in the meantime?
- Are Ramsey and I the only ones left?
[[/div]]

> **Special Containment Procedures:** New information regarding SCP-5000 is to be forwarded to Researchers Martina Ramsey and Lupe De La Cruz as soon as possible. Previously gained information --does not matter-- --is contradictory-- is to be restricted to Level 4 clearance.
> 
> SCP-5000-1 is to be --destroyed-- kept in a standard storage locker.
> 
> SCP-5000-2 is --still at large-- --uncontained-- --seriously I can't find one scrap of evidence that this thing ever existed-- to be contained at earliest possible point.

[[div class="page"]]
Are we watching the dissolution of the Foundation?
@@@@
Daily Thoughts:
- Perhaps the overseers are dead
- Perhaps they never existed
- I haven't seen Ramsey in days
[[/div]]

> --**Object Class:** Neutralized?[[footnote]] No, because we're still feeling the anomalous ramifications [[/footnote]]--

> --**Object Class:** Safe[[footnote]] This thing certainly isn't easily contained [[/footnote]]--

> --**Object Class:** Apollyon[[footnote]] ...Am I watching the world end? [[/footnote]]--

I don't understand any of it anymore.
