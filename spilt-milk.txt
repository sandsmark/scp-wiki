Andy! Hey mate, it's Chaz!

So, I got the MC&D shareholders together for one final board meeting, right? And some were, well, still a tad skeptical of the whole thing. I'm telling you; I haven't had that much difficulty giving a pitch since cookery school, heh heh! I got a hold of a few Oneiric representatives who, luckily, were more than willing to spin their dreams into day for us. They'll be able to ease along our partnership with those secretive Moo... Those moo fellows. Can't recall their name, sorry!

We've been working on the insurance angle -- can't seem to get that sorted out yet, sadly -- but I'm telling you, we'll have this all set up within six, maybe twelve weeks, by the latest!

Andy? Twenty-twenty-five's our bloody year! That's right -- Ambrose is setting up shop in the Mindscapes, baby!

...

Oi Andy, it's Chaz. I'm calling because...

We've had some, er, growing pains, in a manner of speaking. No no, it's okay. It's cool. I totally get your vibe. Just, breathe for a sec.

... 

You good now? All right!

So anyway, like I said last time, I've just been having //the worst// headache lately. ... What's that? Oh, it's nothing. I spoke with my new shrink, Marcie, she says it's just my anxiety flaring up again. No ‚Äú[[[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5990|raving sub-mariner extrusion]]]‚Äù[[footnote]]In reference to SCP-5990.[[/footnote]] or whatever hysteria's struck the news again. Seriously, nothing to panic about.

Right! Now, we had the place up last week, over on the conceptual corner of Surreptitious and Scrumptious, buuut... We've had irate mindscapers from all over the thought-sphere pouring into our Head Office in Portland -- er, one of 'em -- the whole weekend. All protesting over dodgy business practices or //what have you.//

I spoke with this one thoughtform, through e-mail? Friendly l'il thing, just the cutest! We chatted for a bit; said xe attended my second-ever soft opening down in SanFran, y'know, before we took the brand out East. It warmed me right up! But xey //said// that xe took issue with the way Ambrose has been //presenting ourselves// lately. Said //I, personally,// am in with the wrong crowd. Seems not many are down to //marry the dairy// yet‚Äì

Oh, you wanna know what I said? Well I told 'em, you know, ‚Äúwe respect the anomalous //community//,‚Äù right, and ‚Äúthis is our way to //give back//,‚Äù and all that. It came from the heart, you know.

I... Think I ruffled a few feathers. Like, metaphorically-speaking. Er... 'pparently I've been using the wrong word? And ‚Äúparanatural‚Äù is what we use now? It's meant to inspire strength for a diversity of //beings//, and solidarity no matter //how mundane// -- that sort of thing. 

... 

Andy, do you know what ‚Äúok noomer‚Äù means?

Sorry, I'm rambling, but what I wanted to say was, I want this to be a fresh start. I want to put my best foot forward.

I want Ambrose to do important things this year. We'll make a few hundred thousand gees, I'm sure, but I want our customers to feel appreciated. For following us all these years.

Ayup! Thanks for hearing me out, then! All right. And er, Andy? Whatever you do, //don't// look on [[span style="font-weight: bold; color: blue;"]]Void[[/span]] for a couple days.

Take care now!
