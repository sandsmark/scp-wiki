                                <span class="clearfix"><b>Threat Level:</b> <span id="yellow">&bull;</span></span>

                                <p><b>Special Containment Procedures:</b> Due to the immaterial nature and relatively recent discovery of SCP-4205, no methods of containing SCP-4205 has been discovered. Sightings of SCP-4205 are to be immediately reported to the site supervisor as well as Junior Researcher Wade Dalitz. All video recordings of SCP-4205 can be saved to the specified archived on the Foundation Database <i>&lsqb;&lsqb;dbs-4205&rsqb;&rsqb;.</i></p>

                                <p><b>Description:</b> SCP-4205 is a pair of amber colored eyes, appearing primarily within the translucent or semi-translucent pane of any window-like structure. In most cases, when an affected individual views these eyes, brain death will occur quite swiftly. This has been observed in most cases with only one exception to date. An unusual aspect of the deceased victims is that usual postmortem brain activity ceases in a much more rapid manner than usually observed in a natural death.</p>

                                <p>SCP-4205 was discovered on December 11, 1992 by Junior Researcher Wade Dalitz when he observed SCP-4205 appearing within the reinforced glass between the observation room to interrogation room F99. He later requested the site supervisor, Dr. Mark Forsyth to review surveillance footage of the observation room in which SCP-4205 was observed within the video as well. After further reviews of surveillance footage over the past two years, six other occurrences of SCP-4205 were discovered. They are as follows:</p>

                                <p class="block notes">/&ast; Collect occurrence and place here &ast;/</p>

                                <p>Further research into SCP-4205 is required and has been approved by <span class="underline">Dr. Mark Forsyth</span> with <span>Junior Researcher Wade Dalitz</span> as the lead.</p>

                                <p class="block review"><span>Review Status: DENIED</span>
                                <b>Notes:</b> Dalitz, this is sloppy. Object Classes are based off the ease of containment, not danger. And what the hell is Threat Level? Did you make that up? There are so many errors here. I will come to your desk and assist in person. You are not in university anymore. You need to do better.</p>
                                <p>Also you left some part of a journal or something at the top of the file. I did not "get you hired." You proved you have potential. <i>Now live up to it.</i> &mdash;MF</p>

                                    <p>Hey Dad. Had a shit day at work today. To the surprise of no one.</p>

                                    <p>I get it. It's my first time documenting an SCP. Mistakes are expected, right? I don't know what's wrong with me, I knew inventing some 'threat level' bullshit was bullshit. I just wanted to try something new.</p> 

                                    <p>I should have known better.</p> 

                                    <p>I almost had a goddamned stroke when I nearly sent that second draft to Mark. I would be incredibly fired if I did. Even Mark wouldn't be able to forgive that. Years of college dealing with my garbage, if he's not fed up by now... he probably never will be. He'd probably just demote me to unpaid intern and have me usher around D-class until one of them stabs me.</p>

                                    <p>I'll just make a list here of the items he told me to edit... I'll fix them tomorrow:</p>
                                    
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Change to Keter</li>
                                        <li>Remove my idiotic bullshit Threat Level (my words, not his)</li>
                                        <li>Remove my name from containment procedures.</li> 
                                        <li>Add occurrences and never submit a draft without it being complete (his words, not mine)</li>
                                        <li>Correct overall tone</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>Nothing in University really prepared me for the Foundation. Analytical Chemistry never taught me to test for glowing eyes in glass that kill people...
                                    I don't even really know what I'm going to do next.</p> 

                                    <p>I have to figure it out, I can't disappoint Dr. Mark after all he's done for me.</p>

                                    <p>Talk to you tomorrow.</p>

All sightings of SCP-4205 are to be reported to Foundation Site lead immediately upon discovery. Any deceased victims must be taken to the site coroner in order to perform an autopsy. Until further notice, all rooms containing thin sheets of translucent material used to look between two distinct spaces are to keep an Experimental Lang-Scranton Stabilizer within in order to counter-act the anomaly.<span class="sub_footnote">1</span><span class="footnote">Footnote 1: Need to contact Dr. Scranton...

During autopsy, the bodily functions of victims appear to be completely unharmed. However, the brain is shown to have extensive nerve damage focused primarily on the amygdala, hippocampus, medial temporal lobe, and the occipital lobe. Though, all parts of the brain displayed some form of damage similar in some form to electrical shock or cranial trauma.</span></p>

The Holding Room has a single observation window on its northeastern wall. SCP-4205 was observed within the reflective glass of this one way window and appear to passively watch the Deputy Liaison for approximately eight minutes. During this time, the security tape shows mild electrical damage. The Deputy Liaison appears to aimlessly peer around the room when he observes SCP-4205 and falls out of his chair to his death.

                                    <p>Evening, Dad.</p>

                                    <p>I've been staring at this terminal for the past 7 hours. You know how I am when I focus on stuff. On top of that, my lamp is busted. So I'm just using the terminal's light. I can already feel my eyes drying out.</p>

                                    <p>...I need to eat something.</p>

                                    <p>Home is starting to feel like work. I just bring it with me. With my terminal here, oh so kindly given to me by the Foundation with the strict instructions that it is ONLY meant for Foundation work and nothing else. Granted, I have no idea if games would run on this thing. It doesn't look like an Apple or an IBM...</p>

                                    <p>Whatever.</p>

                                    <p>There's been a burning feeling in the back of my mind. </p>

                                    <p>I do not understand why I am still alive.<br /> 
                                    All the others died. <br />
                                    Six others... and me.</p>

                                    <p>Why me?</p> 

                                    <p>I'm not special.</p> 

                                    <p>Well, Ma said I was special, but she's my Ma, of course she did. You know how she is.</p>

                                    <p>Ever since seeing them, I can't think about anything else. I barely slept at all last night.<br />
                                    I'm going to try to sleep early today, maybe that will help. I can eat tomorrow.</p>

                                    <p>Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.</p>

The Holding Room has a single observation window on its northeastern wall. SCP-4205 was observed within the reflective glass of this one way window and appear to passively watch the Deputy Liaison for approximately eight minutes. During this time, the security tape shows mild electrical damage. The Deputy Liaison appears to aimlessly peer around the room when he observes SCP-4205 and falls out of his chair to his death. He was discovered approximately five minutes later by Dr. Bright's assistant.</p>

                                                <p class="clearfix">SCP-048-N's containment procedures made it particularly susceptible to SCP-4205. SCP-048-N was a humanoid being that appeared as an malnourished young (approximately 8-10 years old) girl of Middle Eastern origin, though claimed to be thousands of years old. SCP-048-N claimed to be the Canaaite god Yam, despite Yam generally being depicted as a male figure. SCP-048-N had the compulsive ability to fill any space it occupies with water as well as the ability to pass through any solid, opaque surface. An important part of SCP-048-N's containment procedures was to keep her within a glass cube at all times as SCP-048-N was not capable of traversing transparent substances. On November 20, 1990, Area 14 had an emergency drill for which the researchers within SCP-048-N's observation room existed. Within two minutes, SCP-4205 appears on all six panes of SCP-048-N's containment cube. SCP-048-N is declared neutralized upon confirmation of death by Area 14 Director Dr. Lire.</p>

                                                <p class="clearfix">Dr. Lire seemed very relieved when he was informed that SCP-048-N's neutralization was not a result of negligence. SCP-048 was considered a useful asset due to its nature as a possible deity, one of which is known to have an enemy deity of Baal.</p>

                                    <p>Quale. I know Quale. He's just around my age. Been at the foundation longer than me, though. Actually got through university in a respectable amount of time rather than having to have his pathetic ass saved after two years of failure. I bet he never had to struggle for ten hours just to write one line of a containment procedure as he tries to decide if he needs to use the scientific name for Plexiglass.</p>

                                    <p>Tomorrow. I will talk to him tomorrow.</p>

                                    <p>Also, I think I started to hallucinate. </p>

                                    <p>Last night, I was laying in bed, tossing and turning. I was trying everything. Even turned on the radio to listen to some shitty soft jazz, your favorite, there's really no better sleep aid than that garbage (no offense). I turned to my right side, looking towards the window of my bedroom and I saw them. Again. Same as the first time. I felt myself tense up, my body just seizing. I stared at it for what felt like an eternity.</p>

                                    <p>You know night terrors? I used to have them when I was a kid, it was before you were gone but I don't think I ever told you. Would wake up, stiff as a board and feel as something would pull at my toes and giggle with the same voice as the Wicked Witch from The Wizard of Oz. (That's your fault, by the way. You knew it freaked me out and you'd tease me with the voice anyway.) Eventually I'd be able to take a breath and scramble up in my bed only to see nothing.</p>

                                    <p>Not this time. This time being able to move seemed to come gradually, like stiff knots at my joints were coming unraveled one by one. And then I got up from my bed, but it was still there.</p>

                                    <p>Now stick with me here. Dr. Mark told me to think of some tests for 4205. Which, like, how the hell am I supposed to test something if I don't even know where it is? 

                                    <p>But this was my chance, I had to do something. And being the thick piece of shit I am, all I could think of was touching it. Like, next day I'm goddamned punching myself because there's dozens of other better experiments but all I could think of was <i>touching</i> it.</p>

                                    <p>Anyway, I, you know... touched it. Nothing really happened. I felt a weird sort of shiver over my whole body but that's it.</p>

                                    <p>I haven't told anyone. I haven't submitted any of my last two drafts. I just don't want to be taken off the project. This is my chance to prove myself to everyone. Fuck, I have to tell them though. There's something going on. This isn't normal. I'm going to call Mom and talk to her, even though I can't really share any of this with her. Fuck, I hate lying to her.</p>

                                    <p>I wish I had somebody. I don't even really have you...</p>

                                    <p>Ugh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. I'm just so fucking stressed. I'm sorry.</p>

                                    <p>Goodnight, Dad, I miss you.</p>

                                <p><b>Special Containment Procedures:</b> <i>No methods of containing SCP-4205 have been discovered. Containment is impossible. It has no weaknesses.</i> All sightings of SCP-4205 are to be reported to Foundation Site lead immediately upon discovery. Any deceased victims must be taken to the site coroner in order to perform an autopsy. Until further notice, all rooms containing thin sheets of translucent material used to look between two distinct spaces are to keep an Experimental Lang-Scranton Stabilizer within in order to counter-act the anomaly. <span class="sub_footnote">#</span><span class="footnote">Footnote #: Not like I'll ever get to ask him.</span> Additionally, all rooms must be occupied with no less than two individuals at all times.</p>
                                
                                <p>Any poor, unfortunate souls that see SCP-4205 and do not die should be immediately killed as well. SCP-4205 obviously just made a mistake.</p>

                                <p>During attempts to resuscitate victims, brain death was observed to cease in a much more rapid manner than usually observed in a natural death. During autopsy, the bodily functions of victims appear to be completely unharmed. However, blah blah blah blah some brain science bullshit that I don't actually understand and just copied from some coroner report. Who the fuck cares what it does to the brain?</p>

                                <p>Initial discovery of SCP-4205 occurred on December 11, 1992 when Junior Researcher Wade Dalitz licked the frozen flag pole of life and somehow didn't get stuck.</p>

                                <p>SCP-4205 has a form. It is as if it is not there. Or it is there, like a rip in space. Not a void. Like my eyes want to look at it, but my brain won't let it. Like when a CRT Monitor with bad tracking has a black line that just scrolls across the screen.</p>

                                <p>Occurrences of the lucky six that got to die are not going to be listed because who cares.</p>

                                    <p><i><b>WHATEVER. </b></i></p>
                                    <br/>
                                    <p>I don't CARE if they can see this.</p>

                                    <p>I'm not going to stop just because I know you bastards can read this.</p>

                                    <p>Yeah, hey, Dad.</p>

                                    <p>Turns out I've not just been talking to you. The Foundation has been watching the whole time.<br/>
                                    If I wave at the screen will they be able to see it? I fuckin hope so.</p>

                                    <p>Three hours.<br/>
                                    THREE.<br/>
                                    HOURS.<br/>
                                    Doctor of sucking-his-own-itty-bitty-dick Mark Forsyth berated me for Three. Hours.<br/>
                                    I'm unprofessional.<br/>
                                    I'm a child.<br/>
                                    I'm dense and idiotic.<br/>
                                    I should have never been allowed to graduate.<br/>
                                    He never should have helped me.<br/>
                                    What did he ever see in me.<br/>
                                    (All his words.)</p>

                                    <p>And my words. Who am I fuckin kidding, he's right. He's <i>right!</i> I know he is. He just finally said exactly what I've been telling myself for years. <br/>
                                    Sent me home. Took me off SCP-4205.<br/>
                                    I'm definitely fired.</p>

                                    <p>He told me I was going to be "watched." I'm not allowed to leave my house.<br/> 
                                    But I already am being watched.</p>

                                    <p>Hold on, let me say hello to my new friend.</p>

                                    <p>Nope, nothing.</p> 

                                    <p>Oh, right, I haven't told you yet.<br/>
                                    They're there all the time now. The eyes. They're everywhere.<br/>
                                    Bedroom window. Window in the front door. Window in the kitchen. Window in the living room.<br/>
                                    <span class="line glitch_3">Not the window in my front door, though... It doesn't like that window.</span><br/>
                                    I swear I even saw the bastard in my water glass earlier.</p>

                                    <p>I don't know what's going on. I'm too fucking pissed to be scared right now but...<br/>
                                    If I'm going to be stuck in here with this thing, I might as well test it. Not going to let this stop me.</p>

                                    <p>Oh, also, before being reamed like a stack of paper, I found Quale. He seemed... fine. Told me nothing had happened between seeing the eyes and today.<br/> Maybe I <i>am</i> just going crazy. I do wish I could've talked to him more, though. I've admired the guy since university. </p>

                                    <p>Too goddamned late now, though. Probably going to die of old age in this house while the Foundation pokes me with a stick.</p>

                                    <p>Just you, me, my glowing eye friend, and those BASTARDS reading this.

                                    and we watch the birds in the sky. like liquid in the blue. so many spots of black<br />
                                    why did they move like that?<br />
                                    it looks like that, outside of the glass<br />
                                    like so many many hundred of birds<br />
                                    like black liquid in the blue<br />
                                    chaos but control<br />
                                    what kind of bird was that, dad?</p>

                                <p><b>Special Containment Procedures:</b> SCP-4205 is currently uncontained. Its status is unknown and active research into effective methods of containment are ongoing. Any manifestations of SCP-4205 are to be reported immediately to the Site Director Jacob Yth. Video records of SCP-4205 must be analysed frame by frame for any visual abnormalities, and any electronic devices nearby at the time of the viewing event must be thoroughly monitored for any data corruption. Early testing has revealed that SCP-4205 appears to be negatively affected and/or repelled by lead glass.</p>

                                    Effective immediately, all panes of glass or glass-like material at all sites and areas within affected Foundation sites will be replaced with lead-impregnated glass or coated with lead glazing. An SCP-4205 specialist will be assigned to all affected sites to provide guidance and oversight. As a secondary precaution, it is highly advised that all personnel within affected sites requiring vision-assisting eyeglasses have them replaced with contact lenses or undergo laser-assisted //in situ// keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery.</p>

                                <p><b>Description:</b> SCP-4205 is a visually perceived, cognitohazardous anomaly presenting as two adjacent, amber-hued, luminous oculiform objects within a transparent medium. This medium must serve as a viewing window between two separate, enclosed spaces. So far SCP-4205 has appeared in:</p>
                                
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Tempered Glass</li>
                                    <li>Frosted Glass</li>
                                    <li>Float Glass</li>
                                    <li>Prototype Memetic Hazard Polymer Shielding</li>
                                    <li>Plexiglass</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p>Any sentient being directly viewing SCP-4205 will undergo immediate and irreversible brain death, with all measurable neurological activity ceasing within 500 milliseconds of exposure.Any digital video footage captured during an SCP-4205 viewing event invariably displays some level of distortion and corruption. Frame by frame analysis of these recordings demonstrate individual frames displaying various locations frequented by the affected individual. Analysis of this effect is ongoing.</p>

                                </p>

                                <p>In one instance, the Foundation terminal that an affected individual had been using during the viewing event was later found with severe textual and data corruption. According to network editing logs, in the two and a half hours between the viewing event and examination of the terminal the files 014205-AnomArch-52-57-44 through 134205-AnomArch-52-57-44 were sequentially inserted, archived, and given priority database positions for SCP-4205. Attempts at removal have been unsuccessful. </p>

                                <p>The discovery of the anomaly and its associated hazards, as well as unsuccessful attempts at containment, prompted the creation of Mobile Task Force Xi-6 “St. Elmo's Fire”, assigned to investigate SCP-4205. Following the death of Junior Researcher Wade Dalitz, a thorough examination of the anomalously archived files has been conducted by MTF Xi-6. While the experience conveyed through these files has revealed some information on its anomalous effects, it has thus far not been possible to confirm whether the experiences described therein are ubiquitous between all affected individuals.</p>

                                <p>Crystallographic analysis of all transparent materials at Junior Researcher Dalitz' home found that the windows installed into main entrance door to the premises was coated in a 34% lead oxide glaze. This lead to the implementation of Special Procedure 4205-&#x394;, leading to an 84% reduction in fatalities related to SCP-4205 over the following fifteen months.</p>

                                <p>Thirty-seven incidences of exposure corroborated by video evidence are recorded and zero subjects have survived. An archive of all affected individuals is being compiled by MTF Xi-6 and will placed in this file upon completion</p>

                                    <p><b>Special Note:</b> A search of the Foundation Personnel Database for a Dr. Theodore Quale did not result in any matches. Foundation agents later identified a Dr. Theodore Quale, former university classmate of the deceased Wade Dalitz, living in Fargo, ND. Questioning of this individual has thus far not been deemed necessary.</p>
