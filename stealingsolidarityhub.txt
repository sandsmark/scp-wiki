[[tab Boss (SCP-2085-A-1)]]

**Boss**
**Height:** 1.95 m (6 feet 4 ½ inches)
**Weight:** 83 kg (183lbs)
**Hair Color:** Calico
**DOB:** 04/15/05
**Known Aliases:** Major Motoko Kusanagi, Voyevoda, Sir Integra Helsing

Leader of the Black Rabbit Company by unanimous nomination, Boss is the lynchpin and stabilizing force of the operation. She cuts the deals, she keeps the books, and makes sure that everyone and everything is running smoothly. She’s everyone’s big sister, and the one looked to for support and guidance both on a personal and group level.

Boss was the driving force behind the original breakout – hardly the first to desire or attempt such an escape, but the first to organize and run a successful attempt.

Boss focuses on practicality, sensibility, and efficiency; she uses what she has available to the greatest extent she can. Running the group is her responsibility, and she’s the kind of person who would be utterly directionless without that responsibility giving her focus. While she is not particularly prone to expressing her emotions outwardly, this does not mean that she is distant from her sisters: Boss knows how to read her sisters, and vice versa. 

She has a special fondness for Wizard, and was instrumental in both his admission into the Company and the adoption of the Company charter – to this day, neither one of them can remember who came up with the spaceship idea. 

**Skillset:** Administration, hand-to-hand combat, swordsmanship, tactical command, fixer, staff therapist, herding cats
**Humor:** Balanced

[[tab Momoko (SCP-2085-A-2)]]

**Momoko**
**Height:** 2m (6 feet, 7 inches)
**Weight:** 95 kg (209.5 lbs)
**Hair Color:**Black bicolor
**DOB:** 04/15/05
**Known Aliases:** Milly Thompson, Rally Vincent, Alex Armstrong, Yoko Ritona

Momoko is the muscle of the Company, occasional second-in-command, and all around larger-than-life character. She’s loud, gregarious, easily excited, and fun-loving, fond of good friends, good food, and good drink in vast quantities: in short, a classical Epicurean. 

Her life is an action movie, and she loves every moment of it – and she can often get disappointed and frustrated things go the other way. Why do things the simple way when the ridiculous way is so much more fun? She’ll come around eventually, though not without some grumbling.

She is one half of the Gun-Husbando War, with her entrant being her rifle, Big Richard. Most of the other members of her Armory-Harem have similarly innuendo-laden names.

**Skillset:** Heavy weapons, cooking, gunsmithing, surfing, bar-fights, wing-womaning
**Humor:** Sanguine

[[/tab]]
[[tab Hana (SCP-2085-A-3)]]
**Hana**
**Height:** 1.92m (6 feet 3 ½ inches)
**Weight:** 79kg (174 lbs)
**Hair Color:** Tabby
**DOB:** 04/15/05
**Known Aliases:** Aisha Clan-Clan, Meryl Stryfe, Minnie May Hopkins

Hana is the ‘youngest’ of the sisters, and is generally a quiet and withdrawn individual. She has a tendency towards idealism and naiveté, though Foundation confinement lessened this trait. Oftentimes she serves as the moral compass of the group, a voice of reason and decency when things are starting to get out of hand. In the Company’s line of work, there is often a conflict between the actual circumstances and the outcome Hana wishes for, and she often has to wrestle with this. 

Hana’s skillset is more general than specialist, and so she will usually act as support crew for one of the other members of the company, usually Momoko.

**Skillset:** Pointman, field medic, reconnaissance, moral support, getaway driver, Dungeon Master
**Humor:** Melancholic

[[/tab]]
[[tab Nanami (SCP-2085-A-4)]]

**Nanami**
**Height:** 1.95 m (6 feet 4 ½ inches)
**Weight:** 76kg (167.5 lbs)
**Hair Color:** Red longhair
**DOB:** 04/15/05
**Known Aliases:** Asuka Langley Soryu, Tsarmina, Varvara, Radical Edward

Nanami is, in her own words, “the world’s only self-aware tsundere” – she’s abrasive, aggressive, angry, crass, crude, irascible, hot-blooded, vengeful and vulgar, and she’s okay with that. This behavior is as much done for her own personal enjoyment as it is a reaction to dealing with people – Nanami prefers solitude and the company of her sisters (plus Wizard), and the rest of the world can all go to hell and stop bothering her. She’ll occasionally make exceptions, for those who can deal with her attitude. For the rest, she’ll poke fun at herself when the opportunity arises, which is often.

Nanami’s frequent lapses into Russian folk songs and assorted bombastic nationalism (both tsarist and soviet) are done not out of any political affiliation, but purely because of theatrics. 

**Skillset:** Electronic warfare, cognitohazard / memetihazard development, information retrieval, classical piano and organ, Queen of Thailand (unofficial)
**Humor:** Choleric

[[/tab]]

[[tab Tomi (SCP-2085-A-5)]]

**Tomi**
**Height:**1.9m (6 feet 2 inches)
**Weight:** 70kg (154.3 lbs)
**Hair Color:** Silver-blue
**DOB:** 04/15/05
**Known Aliases:** Molly Millions, Rei Ayanami, Y.T., Elizabeth Hawkeye

Tomi is a woman of monosyllabic character: blunt, simple, unchanging, untethered, untroubled. She epitomizes marching to the tune of a personal drum, spaced out from the rest of the world. Even so, she has an uncanny perceptiveness for her surroundings: she overhears everything, she notices everything. The blank stare and monotone drawl are ignored at the observer’s peril.

Tomi’s relationship with her sisters is that she is there, equidistant from all of them. This is something of a great reassurance to the other members of the Company, despite Tomi’s often annoying personal habits (nasal spelunking, loud belching, talking in an exaggerated whisper for long periods of time, standing really close behind people without them noticing and waiting for them to turn around.) – she is reliable and ever-present, a passive force to counteract Boss’ active support.

Her primary entrants into the Gun-Husbando War against Momoko are her twin revolvers, Sam and Harry.

**Skillset:** Demolitions, sniper support & sharpshooting, investigation, dry wit
**Humor:** Phlegmatic

[[tab Wizard (SCP-2085)]]

**Wizard**
**Height:** 1.6 m (5 feet 6 in)
**Weight:**60.7 kg (134 lbs)
**Hair Color:** None
**DOB:** 10/09/72
**Known Aliases:** Rincewind, Simon the Red

A man with a dead past, Wizard’s in this for the adventure. The Company, and its eventual goal of getting to space, are his whole life. He’s taken the identity and run with it.

There are moments, however, when Wizard is confronted with moments of doubt. For all his noble intentions, he still ran away from the real world when faced with his mortality and constructed a new world to escape to. Here, Red gains a voice – the cancerous embryo of a growing Overseer feeds upon all of these worries and doubts, and the voice is so similar that there is no telling if the condemnation is Wizard’s, Red’s, or the two are the same. These episodes of communing are sporadic, but filled with frightening dreams and feelings of dread. For those writing after the events of //Stealing Solidarity//, however, Red is no longer an issue.

While all of this, when viewed in a certain light, would be less than a charitable evaluation, Wizard is, despite his flaws, a good man. 

Wizard lacks the technical and combative skills of the rest of the Company, and so acts as the face during operations – the image of the eccentric billionaire and his bodyguards is easily digested by targets, and leads to an exploitable sense of security in targets.

**Skillset:** Public relations, smooth-talking, inspirational speeches, damage control, team mascot
**Humor:** April O’Neil

+ Tips for Writing in this Canon

[[collapsible show="+ Show" hide="- Hide"]]

Imagine if the Guardians of the Galaxy were an anime that aired on Toonami during the late 90s.

This series is something of a black horse, in that it doesn’t really deal much with the Foundation, or any of the other major groups of the scipverse. Take this as an opportunity to do something new and exciting for yourself. Let loose a bit, have an adventure.

If you are looking for inspiration all of these are excellent places to start 
• Company shenanigans pre-containment by the Foundation
• Company shenanigans in space, after the events of //Stealing Solidarity//
• Shenanigans aboard the //Solidarity//, whether with the Company, Heironymus’ D-class tribe, or other, older groups.
• Foundation reactions during the breakout / after the masquerade gets blown to shit.
• What happens to Earth after the events of //Stealing Solidarity//.
• Something featuring the group that created the catgirls.
• Stuff from the POV of the Overseers.
• And so on and so forth.

+ Company Charter (Abridged)

[[collapsible show="+ Show" hide="- Hide"]]

**Article 1:** Boss is the boss. In circumstances when Boss is not able to be the boss, she might appoint another member of the Company as temporary boss.

**Article 2:** Loot gathered at the end of each run will be first applied to the company pool, with a baseline of 50% (modifiable as according to the current financial situation)

**Article 3:** Remaining loot is split equally between all members of the Company.

**Article 4:** Individual members of the Company are permitted personal loot hauls, on the grounds that personal loot is not of sufficient value or use to be added to the company pool. Conflicts are to be overseen by the group as a whole.

**Article 5:** Members of the Black Rabbit Company are held to the following ethical standards:
• To alleviate the criminal, the politician, and the corporation of the burden of their surplus wealth.
• To aid the lot of oppressed and enslaved peoples whenever possible.
• To strive always towards the betterment of mankind as a whole through the exploration of space and the exaltation of the human spirit.
• Never paying more than twenty dollars for a computer game.

All cases of misconduct by Company members will be reviewed by the group as a whole.

**Article 6:** Entry into the Black Rabbit Company is permitted within the framework of building additional squads as separate entities to the currently existing Black Rabbit Company. Article subject to further elaboration at such a point when the topic is broached.

**Article 7:** We’re family. No one goes hungry, no one gets left behind.
