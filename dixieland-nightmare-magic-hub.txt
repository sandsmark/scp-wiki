> //Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.//

> //The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none upright among men: [[span style="color:red"]]they all lie in wait for blood[[/span]]; they hunt every man his brother with a net.//

> //That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge asketh for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.//

> //The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge: [[span style="color:red"]]the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh[[/span]]; now shall be their perplexity.//
> 
> //Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.//
