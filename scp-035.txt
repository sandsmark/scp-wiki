**Item#:** SCP-035


**Object Class:** Keter


**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-035 is to be kept within a hermetically sealed glass case, no less than three inches (3') thick. This is to be contained within a steel, iron and lead shielded room at all times. Doors are to be locked at all times, with the exception of allowing entering and exiting personnel. No less than two (2) armed guards are to be posted at any time. Guards are not allowed within the room, and must remain outside at all times. A trained psychologist is to remain on site at all times. Research personnel are not to touch SCP-035 at any time. The SCP-035 must be moved to a new sealed case every two (2) weeks. The previous case must be disposed of via [[[SCP-101]]], as it shows no adverse reactions to SCP-035's “corruption”. Anyone who comes into contact with SCP-035 when it is in possession of a host, is to be given an immediate psychological evaluation.


**Description:** SCP-035 appears to be a white porcelain comedy mask, although at times, it will change to tragedy, and all previous visual records, such as photographs, video footage, even illustrations, of SCP-035 automatically change to reflect this.

Subjects within five to six (5-6) feet of SCP-035, or in visual contact with it, have experienced a strong urge to put it on.

A highly corrosive and degenerative viscous liquid constantly seeps from the eye and mouth holes of SCP-035. Anything coming into contact with this substance slowly decays over a period of time, depending on the material, until it has decayed completely into a pool of the original contaminant. Glass seems to react the slowest to the effects of the item, hence the construction choice of its immediate container. Living organisms that come into contact with the substance react much the same way, with no chance of recovery. Origin of the liquid is unknown. Liquid is only visible from the front, and does not emerge or is even visible from the other side.

When SCP-035 is placed on the face of an individual, an alternate brain wave pattern is found to overlap that of the original host, effectively snuffing it out and causing brain death to the subject. Subject then claims to be the consciousness contained within SCP-035. "Possessed" subject bodies decay at an alarming rate, eventually becoming little more than mummified corpses. Still, SCP-035 has demonstrated the ability to remain in cognitive control of a body even if it is faced with serious structural damage to the subject, even in the event the subject's body literally decays to the point where motion is not mechanically possible. No effect is found to be had when placed on the face of an animal.

Conversations with SCP-035 have proved to be informative. Researchers have learned various things about other SCP and about history in general, as SCP-035 claims to have been at many momentous events. SCP-035 displays a highly intelligent and charismatic personality, being both amiable and flattering to all those that speak with it. SCP-035 has received perfect scores on all intelligence tests administered to it, and appears to have a photographic memory.

However, psychological analysis has discovered SCP-035 to possess a highly manipulative nature, capable of forcing sudden and profound changes to interviewer's psychological state. SCP-035 has proven to be highly sadistic, prompting some to suicide (see [[[Interview 035]]]) and transforming others into near-mindless servants with linguistic persuasion alone. SCP-035 has stated that it has intimate knowledge of the workings of the human mind and implied that it could change anyone's views if given enough time.

**Additional:** SCP-035 was found in a sealed crypt in an abandoned house in Venice, in 18██.


**Addendum 035-01:** SCP-035 has been found to be able to possess anything that has a humanoid shape, including mannequins, corpses, even statues. SCP-035 has been able to motivate all into movement, which disregards the need for further expendable live subjects. Still, anything it possesses inevitably decays into motionlessness.


**Addendum 035-02:** SCP-035 has facilitated an escape attempt, convincing several of the research staff to aid it in its bid for freedom. Insurrection failed. All staff that have been in contact with SCP-035 have been terminated, and mandatory psyche evaluations has been instated for all personnel coming in contact with SCP-035.


**Addendum 035-03:** It has been revealed that SCP-035 is capable of telepathy, whether or not it possesses a host, even penetrating the to the subconscious of others, and using the knowledge it finds to its advantage. Extreme caution is advised when choosing subjects to converse with SCP-035.


**Addendum 035-04:** SCP-035 has expressed an interest in other SCPs, most notably [[[SCP-517]]] and [[[SCP-682]]]. Dr. ██████ has expressed worry that should SCP-035 bond with either, their regenerative qualities would negate its corruption and give it a permanent host.


**Addendum 035-05:** After several more escape attempts, and after reviewing SCP-035's ill intent, high command have ordered that it be permanently sealed within the facility and prohibited from being allowed any more hosts. Several personnel have protested against this, with some even into erupting into violence. As a direct result, all personnel that have come into contact with SCP-035 have been terminated. All personnel that deal with SCP-035 are to be rotated and contact is to be limited even to its dormant state to as little as possible.


**Addendum 035-06:** Personnel within forty feet of SCP-035, have recently reported feeling unease, stating that they can hear illegible whispering. Several others have suffered from severe migraines. Object has been monitored, but there is no change in its dormant behavior, and no sounds have been recorded.

The motion to reinstate SCP-035's host privileges has been brought up once more, if only on a temporary basis to discover these new changes in the objects behavior. //(Denied)//


**Addendum 035-07:** The walls of SCP-035's containment cell has been found to suddenly begin excreting a black substance. Tests on the substance has revealed it to be human blood, although highly contaminated with several foreign and unknown agents. Substance is corrosive, having a pH of four point five (4.5), and prolonged time on the walls has proven to be detrimental to their structural integrity.

More interestingly, is the fact that it seems to be forming patterns on the walls. Several segments seem to be paragraphs in various languages, including Italian, Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit. Translation is pending. Other segments appear to be diagrams depicting ritualistic sacrifice and mutilation, often for the arcane benefit of the person committing them. Several staff members have been shocked to note that all of the sacrifices bear an uncanny resemblance to various personnel and their loved ones, often in conflicting positions.

Researchers while in the room examining these newly formed patterns have complained of hearing loud whispering, and high pitched, unnerving laughter at irregular intervals.

Personnel in the section working daily near and around SCP-035's containment unit have suffered catastrophic morale damage, with a all time high in suicide rates in staff in that area, whether or not they have ever had contact with SCP-035.

The only change in SCP-035's dormant behavior is regarding its contained glass case. Degradation of the case has increased to a high degree, enough so that the glass will occasionally shatter, causing a wide dispersal of SCP-035's contaminant. This occurs quite often at the most inopportune times, resulting in the over six (6) casualties and three (3) fatalities of both research and cleanup staff.


**Addendum 035-08:** In light of the mass suicide/homicide of the members of the research team tasked with translating the passages garnered from SCP-035's containment cell, the morale damage in the area, and general loss of staff dealing with SCP-035 to either death or insanity, it has been decided to coat the inner and outer walls of its containment cell with [[[SCP-148]]], which has proved well in the containment of [[[SCP-132]]], (see Document 132-01) in order to hopefully block out the high levels of negativity being emitted by SCP-035.


**Addendum 035-09:** The use of SCP-148 has worked well, causing morale and suicide rates to steeply decline to pre-SCP-035 rates.

However, the material appears to facilitate the negativity within the cell, causing a veritable "Greenhouse Effect" inside. Personnel inside the cell have stated that they feel a heavy sense of dread, fear, anger and general depression, as well as hearing constant, near inaudible whispering upon immediate entry. A prolonged stay caused severe migraines, suicidal tendencies, heavy hemorrhaging of blood vessels around the eyes and inside the mouth and nose, general hostility to others, and for the whispering to increase to almost deafening volumes, intersected by a constant mocking laughter. Spending time over three (3) hours inevitably resulted in the subject falling into a deep psychosis, and attempting to harm either themselves or others. Most spoke in Latin or Greek, despite the fact that several did not previously know how to speak said languages beforehand.

The presence of blood in both word and diagram formations has increased disproportionately, the walls becoming cluttered, and the formations beginning to overlap each other. The substance has proven to be both difficult to clean, and even more corrosive than was originally recorded, dropping down the pH scale to roughly two point four (2.4). General estimation gives the current walls a life of two (2) months before they need replacement.

It is becoming gradually more and more difficult to contain SCP-035, and the debate to reinstate its host privileges has once again come up. //(Denied)//


**Addendum 035-10:** The walls, ceiling and floor of SCP-035's containment cell have now been completely saturated in blood. All personnel entering and guarding the area must wear full Hazmat protection suits. Constant cleaning efforts are being instated.


**Addendum 035-11:** The magnitude, intensity and recurrence of the phenomenon that occur within SCP-035's containment cell have increased to an alarming degree. The cell door has been know to become locked of its own accord whilst personnel are inside, and be unable to be opened for a period of time. Appendages have been noted to form out of the larger puddles of blood, and attempt to grab or harm personnel nearest them. Blurry apparitions have started appearing to staff. Electronic devices no longer work inside the cell, and the light refuses to work, despite there being no physical reason as to why not, forcing those entering to use non-electrical lanterns.

Cleaning measures are having no discernible effect on the cell, and the walls are degrading at a very high rate, forcing them to be replaced within a week at best, although the blood makes it near impossible to properly achieve this.

SCP-035 may have to be moved to a new cell entirely, the older one sealed off and disengaged from the rest of the facility.
