**Special Containment Procedures:** The object is not to be described or mentioned in physical print, nor appear in any visual media shot with film reel technology, under any circumstances. Vocalization and digital text are, at this time, regarded as the only safe methods of discussion. The object is otherwise to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell, and afforded all accommodations and amenities considered standard for humanoid habitation as defined by the Ethics Committee. All personnel that are assigned to SCP-5323 must be thoroughly vetted and approved by no fewer than three staff members with Level 4 Clearance or higher.

**Description:** SCP-5323 is a white humanoid lacking any visible hair, eyes, ears, or a nose, but is capable of functioning normally despite these abnormalities. SCP-5323 appears to be resistant to the effects of aging, having not changed in appearance since entering Foundation custody twenty years ago. The object prefers to be referred to as "Alan Smithee", and is generally cooperative with Foundation personnel if also abrasive in social interactions.

Apart from the aforementioned physical characteristics, the object is otherwise normal and exhibits no outwardly anomalous abilities //unless// it is described in physical print (either handwritten or typed using a typewriter or similar instrument), at which point **[DATA CORRUPTED]**

[FADE IN]

INT. ABANDONED  HOLLYWOOD OFFICE

We see a pale white humanoid lacking hair, eyes, ears, and a nose—though still sporting a mouth—wearing a garish white three-piece suit chomping on a hefty Cuban cigar; this is ALAN. He is sitting at the desk of a fairly typical office (albeit dilapidated from neglect) surrounded by file cabinets and a landline phone. Alan has his feet propped up on the desk, and is currently reading through a script titled "CATWOMAN (FIRST DRAFT)". He chuckles, then coughs loudly, knocking over the coffee mug on its side with his feet.
[[=]]
ALAN
Christ, this is awful.
[[/=]]
Alan reaches over and resets the coffee mug upright, then taps its side. The coffee mug fills up. The office door opens, and we see a young blonde lady peek through slowly, stopping at revealing her eyes through the door. This is ANNIE. She speaks with a raspy smoker's voice.
[[=]]
ANNIE
Um... Mr. Smithee?
[[/=]]
Alan looks up from the script and smiles.
[[=]]
ALAN
Annie!
(closes script and waves it)
I fuckin' hate this. Would you mind sending it back to whoever asked me to do it? Tell them even //I// don't stoop this low.

Alan flips his wrist and checks his watch, confused look on his face. He notices the watch isn't working.

ALAN
(muttering)
How long's it been 11am?
[[/=]]
He looks up at Annie and smiles again.
[[=]]
ALAN
Send 'em in.
[[/=]]
CUT TO: The same office, but two men in black suits with visible nametags are sitting across from Alan. Alan is sitting up straight, cigar doused in an ash tray though still billowing smoke. The man on the left is wearing a bowler cap and sunglasses—Agent BRANDO—while the man on the right is dark haired with no headwear—Agent BOGART. (Probably just codenames) A lengthy pause ensues.
[[=]]
ALAN
Who are you trying to impress, huh? With those names?

BRANDO
Mr. Smithee, we'd like to make you an offer you can't refuse.

ALAN
I'm listening.

BRANDO
We represent a major film producer whose identity will not be divulged per his request.

Uh-huh. What studio?

ALAN
So he sends you to //me?//

BRANDO
Is there a problem?

ALAN
With me? Nah. It's just... your boss might not know what he's getting into.

BOGART
Oh, he is well aware.
[[/=]]
An awkward pause fills the room. Alan taps his desk one finger after the next.
[[=]]
ALAN
Couldn't hurt, I guess.
[[/=]]
INT. ABANDONED HOLLYWOOD CUBICLE SPACE

We see the trio walking out of the office. The building Alan is working out of has mold on the walls, lights ripped out and dangling from the ceiling, chairs knocked upside down, and an unexplained skeleton with its jaws pressed against a dusty coffee mug in the background. We pan and see Annie is actually a floating disembodied head, cut cleanly at the neck. She is sitting at a typewriter, which is clacking away via unknown means.

The agents turn to stare at each other in confusion, then both look at Annie.
[[=]]
BOGART
Clear that, too. Mr. Smithee will be with us for the day.
[[/=]]
Alan turns around to look at the agents with a nasty frown. He begins walking towards them menacingly.
[[=]]
ALAN
Ey! You need me for the day, that's fine. But //nobody// fuckin' tells Annie what to do.

BRANDO
We didn't mean to offend, sir.
[[/=]]
Alan adjusts his suit collar.
[[=]]
ALAN
Let's be off, then. As you can tell, I'm a very busy man. I'll need to be back in action at the crack of dawn tomorrow, capisce?
[[/=]]
The two agents nod, then look at Annie and wave; she smiles back. The three walk out of the room.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD ALLEY - AFTERNOON

We see Alan walking down the dank alley with the agents close behind. As they round a dumpster, MTF agents rush the corner and surround Alan, who appears to be surprised.

MTF 1

[[/=]]
Alan grins from would-be ear to would-be ear.
[[=]]
ALAN
That's my line.
[[/=]]
Alan points finger guns at MTF 1, and the four of them open fire on Alan. He suddenly vanishes and appears on top of the dumpster, then mouths "pew pew pkow" noises as the MTF soldiers begin recoiling and falling over, shrieking in pained surprise. Alan then vanishes and reappears between the four MTF agents. Brando and Bogart appear both horrified and confused.
[[=]]
BOGART
Agents down? I think?
[[/=]]
Brando aims a pistol at Alan, who is blowing on the tips of his finger guns,
puffing a lit cigar that seemed to appear from nowhere.
[[=]]
ALAN
Quit pointing that thing at me.
[[/=]]
Alan holsters his "guns". Bogart rushes over to rip back the suit of one of the MTF agents, and finds no bullet holes or blood.
[[=]]
BOGART
Brando! No wounds on these soldiers.

BRANDO
So, what? They're just... acting?

MTF 2
Sure as fuck feels real!

ALAN (cont'd)
I tell ya, I've heard of method acting, but this is the first I've seen method //producing//. Never been shot at by extras before. Who do you work for, again?
[[/=]]
Bogart freezes, then turns to look at Brando while still crouched. Brando still has his gun out, but meets eyes with Bogart. Bogart shrugs, and Brando shoots Alan in the leg.

LIFE AIN'T FAIR
by Alan Smithee
[[/=]]

[FADE IN]

A pale man wearing a Foundation jumpsuit—ALAN—is sitting in a containment cell, head in hands. He rubs his face, then stares into the distance blankly, as if contemplating.
[[=]]
ALAN
How the fuck did I end up here?
[[/=]]
A loud scraping sound can be heard before a tray with sloppy food and a water bottle plop into the room at the door's base.
[[=]]
GUARD 1
Eat. Or don't. I'm not your mom.
[[/=]]
Alan is now playing "Pastures of Plenty" on harmonica. The harmonica materialized out of nowhere. We hear a banging on the cell door.
[[=]]
GUARD 1 (cont'd)
You know the rules! No music!
[[/=]]
We now see Alan smoking a cigar. A smoke detector in his room beeps loudly.
[[=]]
GUARD 2
Hey, shitbird! You gonna share?

ALAN
Come on in, I'll light you one.

GUARD 2
Ha, nice try.
[[/=]]
Alan throws the cigar against the door. He then sees writing on the wall next to the door: "YOU'RE IN CONTROL".

ALAN
Huh. That wasn't there before.

GUARD 1
Shut the fuck up. We're not opening the door.
[[/=]]
Alan counts down from three with his fingers, after which his cell door vanishes. As this is silent, the guards don't notice. He then grins, and counts down again. About five seconds pass before screams of sheer terror echo throughout the facility. Multiple loud and obnoxious alarms begin blaring with accompanying lights, and a voice on the INTERCOM buzzes on after a further ten seconds.
[[=]]
INTERCOM
Code Red. Repeat, Code Red. The site is experiencing a sudden catastrophic breach on all containment cells. Research personnel are to head for the nearest point of evacuation. Armed personnel are to attempt re-containment of medium-level threats as opportunity allows before heading for evacuation. Repeat, Code Red...
[[/=]]
The guards are now alert, and turn around before aiming their rifles at Alan.
[[=]]
GUARD 2
Don't fucking move.
[[/=]]
Alan holds his hands up, but the guards are then pounced on by a disgusting slimy salamander-esque creature with an insect's head. The guards are promptly devoured, blood and guts spraying out like a geyser.
[[=]]
ALAN
Better them than me.
[[/=]]
Alan exits his cell and begins running down the hall. He looks into various newly opened containment rooms, where he can see a researcher dissected and strung up by what appears to be an undead Norse shieldmaiden wielding a battleaxe. The shieldmaiden turns to Alan and points her finger at him.

Alan continues down the hall and in another room spots a guard being decapitated by coins, blood gushing out like a broken fire hydrant. We see a handsome thirty-something man holding hands up as if controlling even more floating coins nearby. The man turns to Alan and winks.[[footnote]]Anomaly theorized to be [[[SCP-4333|SCP-4333]]].[[/footnote]]
[[=]]
ALAN
Find me after all this is over. I need a new financial advisor.
[[/=]]
Upon encountering an intersection, Alan spins to survey his options for progression. Down the east hall he sees research staff backing into a corner away from a large towering monster made of pitch black goop before it looms over and envelops them. Down the west hall he sees facility guards marching his way. Down the north hall he sees ██████████████████████████████████████
██████████████████████████████████████
██████████████████████████████████████
██████.
[[=]]
ALAN
West it is.
[[/=]]
Alan is now wearing a cowboy hat, and his jumpsuit transforms into a dusty 1860s button up, alongside leather boots outfitted with spurs. The facility guards reach the intersection and spread into a formation to block entrance; one guard (GUARD 4) is noticeably older than the others. Alan is standing with one heel cocked back, hand on his hip, and looking down such that the rim of his hat is obscuring what would be his eyes if he possessed any.
[[=]]
GUARD 3
Don't move! We will shoot!

ALAN
World's all kinds 'a fucked up when y'all're apprehendin' the hero of this here land as the Shadow Beast of Farthington runs wild down yonder.
[[/=]]
Alan points a thumb towards the east hall, which is now caked in black goop with skeletons lining the walls. We hear an ear shattering otherworldly screech from around the corner down the hall.
[[=]]
GUARD 3
If you're the hero, why don't you go handle that thing?

Alan leans over and spits some chewing tobacco off to the side. He adjusts his hat.
[[=]]
ALAN
'Cause, fella... it ain't part of my tall tale.

GUARD 4
Let's just go. I'm not about to get cut in half on my last day before retirement.
[[/=]]
The three guards ease up and stand up straight. We then hear three loud slashing sounds in succession, and now a scimitar can be seen floating in mid-air. The three guards suddenly split in half, with the pieces falling to the ground seeping an endless supply of blood. A woman then materializes holding the blade. This is SANDY.[[footnote]]Anomaly theorized to be [[[SCP-3928|SCP-3928]]].[[/footnote]] Alan tips his hat.
[[=]]
ALAN
Good day to you, ma'am. I dare say you prolly done saved my hide.

SANDY
'Tis a pity I must cut you down next, gunslinger!

ALAN
Now hold on just a goshdarned minute—
[[/=]]
Sandy begins waving her scimitar around with skill and grace. Amidst the waving, she retrieves another from the sheathe at her hip. She then performs a very impressive sword dance (NOTE: hire choreographer for this part) and shrieks as she then rushes Alan down, but he sighs and draws his iron, shooting Sandy in the head. Alan walks up to the body, which doesn't have any bullet holes or blood, and he somberly reaches down to close the woman's eyes. Alan then notices blood pouring from his sleeves, with more blood in his chest region. He then coughs and falls to the floor, rolling into his back.
[[=]]
ALAN
Nothin' ever goes accordin' to plan, does it?
[[/=]]
On the ceiling above, Alan notices the words "WELL DONE" written in wet black ink, and a crude pentagram shape underneath. He then passes out with a whimper.

We see a woman, bespectacled, with red hair tied into a bun; this is DR. DEBRUIN. DeBruin is sitting at a table within a nondescript interrogation room; ALAN is sitting across from her, wrists bound and tied to the table.

DEBRUIN
Let the record state, this is Dr. Jennifer DeBruin of Site-55, interviewing SCP-5323.

--SCP-5323-- ALAN
Alan.

DEBRUIN
Hm?

ALAN
My name is Alan. Not SCP whatever the fuck.

DEBRUIN
As you please. We have a lot to discuss today, Alan. Where you come from. Your abilities. What you know of the breach in November. I will defer to you. Which line of questioning do you feel most comfortable starting with?

Please refrain from doing that. It's preferable that you simply //describe// your abilities. We will confirm them during controlled testing exercises.

DeBruin meets her hands and gently places them on the table, sits up straight, and looks at Alan with a sweet yet uneasy smile.
[[=]]
DEBRUIN
What do we already know, Alan?

ALAN
Reality as you know it is just a blank piece of paper to me. Anything I say, goes.

DEBRUIN
Records show that this isn't always the case. You only seem to have control if you are described in physical print—ie, in handwriting, or via a typewriter. Or if you're on physical film tape.

Alan now appears genuinely angry. He raises his voice to a shout.

DEBRUIN
I see. So, walk me through this. How did you become... you?

Alan is now smoking a cigar, leaning back. He props his feet up on the table.

Alan blows smoke towards DeBruin, who sits perfectly still with her eyes closed as the smoke travels around her.

They did a lot of sedating, so not really. It's all fuckin' fuzzy. I know they cut me up more than a few times. And my assistant at my office, Annie? She was there too. As was Bill, and Mikey, and Benny, and Lenny—

DEBRUIN
What happened to them?

ALAN
I don't know. Me and Annie, we got out. Ran out when there was an opening. Some old RKO buddies who got laid off came along to smuggle us back to town. I can't tell you why they risked their neck like that, I really can't. I'm just thankful. The luckiest of the unlucky.

McCarthy lost his footing. Plus, producers saw me as useful. I could produce special effects beyond their wildest dreams. Hollywood has pull with the government.

DEBRUIN
Then, later, they started using your name on disowned productions?

ALAN
I actually finished those productions. I was faster at wrapping up a movie than anyone else, since I could just do anything for the camera. But I did it from the shadows, so only the big wigs knew who I was. To everyone else, I was just a name.

DEBRUIN
Alan Smithee.

ALAN
Yeah.

Alan sighs heavily, smoke billowing out of his mouth. A long pause ensues before DeBruin looks up at a camera in the corner of the room and shrugs. We then hear a voice on the intercom chirp and buzz before it's revealed to be DR. MORGENSEN.
