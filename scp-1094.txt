**Item #:** SCP-1094

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1094 is kept within Site-██, a containment site disguised as an office building belonging to a private company. Attempts made by civilians to enter Site-██ should be deterred, with force should it be necessary. No personnel are to enter the established safe zone around SCP-1094. Personnel expressing interest in interacting with SCP-1094 are to be moved from the site immediately.

**Description:** SCP-1094 is a playground, located in [REDACTED]. The playground contains standard recreational equipment including see-saws, merry-go-rounds, slides, monkey bars and swingsets. The equipment is constructed out of wood, plastic and steel and display no unusual properties on their own. SCP-1094 appears to be inhabited by one or more immaterial entities that manipulate the equipment on a regular basis, as personnel have reported such things as swings move on their own or hearing sounds from the slide. The nature of these entities and their connection to SCP-1094 is not fully understood.

Human beings near SCP-1094 feel compelled to play within it. This effect appears to have a circular range of approximately 17 meters around SCP-1094 and is entirely psychological in nature. This urge is stronger depending on the age of the subject affected, with pre-adolescents reacting the most to exposure. Subjects past puberty can resist the urge with moderate difficulty, but the severity of the urge is increased if the subject directly views or hears another human interacting with SCP-1094. Playing within SCP-1094 induces a state of euphoria in the subject, causing them ignore any previous assignment or duty in favour of continuing to play with SCP-1094. 

Repeated and continuous exposure to SCP-1094 via physical contact with any of the recreational equipment available causes the subject interacting with it to disappear. In all of the █ cases this has been tested, the subject disappeared while they were already completely absent from sight, such as when they were using the slide or climbing through the tunnel connecting two parts of the larger structure. Any tracking device placed on the subject previous to their disappearance will be found in the structure the subject disappeared within.

**Addendum:**  On 19/5/19, writing was found on the inside of one of the walls containing SCP-1094. Camera footage show that no one entered the site at the time. The writing appears to have been done with a black marker pen. A transcript can be found below.
> why doesnt anyone notice me why doesnt anyone see that thing its right there watching them play their games
> it watches them and play forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever ever and ever and ever
Dr. R██████, a researcher assigned to SCP-1094 was found to be missing approximately twenty-two hours before the discovery of the writing. Security on SCP-1094 was severely increased following this event.
