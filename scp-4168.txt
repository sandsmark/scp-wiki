**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4168-1 and SCP-4168-2 are to be kept in a humanoid containment cell modified for the cohabitation of two individuals in Site-17. SCP-4168 is to remain in the care of SCP-4168-1, except for testing purposes.

SCP-4168-2 is to be put in a medically induced coma for two hours a day. During this time a researcher or agent of level 3 clearance or higher is to stay with SCP-4168-1. SCP-4168-1 is to see a site psychologist during this time once a week.

**Description:** SCP-4168 is a ring with a heart-shaped stone measuring 41.7mm across of rose quartz on a pyrite [[footnote]] Pyrite is a frequently used substitute for gold in lower cost jewelry.[[/footnote]]base measuring 13.26mm in diameter. SCP-4168's anomalous properties currently only manifest when worn by SCP-4168-1. SCP-4168-1 is a 23 year old woman named Marie Ang. SCP-4168-2 is a 24 year old man named Simon Langson.

SCP-4168-1 experiences decomposition of the body, starting with the heart if either SCP-4168-2 is not within two meters, if SCP-4168 is not worn or both.

During testing, SCP-4168-1 was separated from SCP-4168 and SCP-4168-2 for a period of five days (the longest such test conducted). At the end of this period, SCP-4168-1 had large abscesses covering approximately 70% of its skin. Additionally its heart, ribcage, and other internal organs were partially exposed due to advanced decomposition of surrounding tissue. SCP-4168-1 reported severe pain but was not otherwise impaired or in danger of death. Upon returning SCP-4168 and SCP-4168-2 to the presence of SCP-4168-1, these changes reverted sequentially in the reverse order that they appeared, and on a similar time frame.

> 
> **Dr.Dots:** Hello SCP-4168-2, how are you doing?
> 
> **SCP-4168-2:** Why does Marie have to be put out? I don't feel comfortable with that.
> 
> **Dr.Dots:** It is necessary because you two can not be separated without harming SCP-4168-1 or as you know her, Marie. We want to interview you separately so we can get your point of view alone.
> 
> **SCP-4168-2:** Oh, well I appreciate that I guess, it really hurts seeing Marie hurt like this.
> 
> **Dr.Dots:** Speaking of that, tell me what you know about the ring.
> 
> **SCP-4168-2:** That ring. That damned ring. I gave Marie a number to call to order it. I had already picked out the ring, but I thought it would be better if Marie ordered it herself.
> 
> **Dr.Dots:** What did you know about the store when you found it? 
> 
> **SCP-4168-2:** Well obviously I didn't know what it would do to my girlfriend. I was just trying to get a nice gift for her. I don't know why this is happening. I just found the store through a google search online. So I'm still kinda confused by who you guys are exactly but could you try to get to the bottom of this?
> 
> **Dr.Dots:** We're certainly doing what we can. All help from you and what you know is appreciated. The sooner we find out more, the sooner we can help you and Marie.
> 
> **SCP-4168-2:** Good! I'm really worried about Marie. To see her in so much pain..... it really hurts....I mean I practically feel it in my own heart. I-I...I know I've said it already but I suppose it's the only real thing I can think of. But I know I'll be there for Marie throughout all of this. She’s the most important thing in my life.

> **Dr.Dots:** Well Marie, I’d like to hear it from you.
> 
> **SCP-4168-1:** Why?
> 
> **Dr.Dots:** Oh um...Well, because it’s important to have both sides of this sort of thing. Helps us sort things out better.
> 
> **SCP-4168-1:** Oh...I mean Simon could just tell you everything, I’m not really worth much here but...I guess I can tell you...Simon gave me the number of this jewellery store to call...Crystal’s Jeweler’s I think...It was this woman’s voice over the phone. She said that Simon had previously called her about it and picked out the perfect ring for me...he was super happy when it arrived... 
> 
> **Dr.Dots:** Alright, thank you. So when did you first notice the anomalous effects of the ring he had picked for you?
> 
> **SCP-4168-1:** //(Silence for five seconds.)// Simon had been keeping me from going to my job because he said the world wasn’t as safe as he was, but I managed to get out once he had left the house for a day.  I wanted to surprise him by showing that the world wasn’t so dangerous and that I could face it. But when I was in the car, my whole body was hurting and felt weak. When I got to work, I couldn’t even stand up. Then I uh... I noticed that my body was rotting.
> 
> **Dr.Dots:** And what did Simon say when he reunited with you?
> 
> **SCP-4168-1:** Well he told me I should have listened to him. He said I needed to stay with him from now on. And then the police wanted interviews and such and then you guys were called once I explained my side.
> 
> **Dr.Dots:** It doesn’t sound like your experience with Simon has been pleasant for you.
> 
> **SCP-4168-1:** He...he just cares about me...he... this is a lot of questions you guys just don’t get it...Simon...he... //(SCP-4168-1 looks down at SCP-4168, then begins to hyperventilate, falling unconscious a short time after.)//

Hey Marie! Writing to yourself....I guess. Today, I’m tired. But also happy. I think. Today I ran into Simon again. We dated in high school. He was a grade above me. When he graduated, he told me he’d find me again. And today, he did! It’s only been what, two years since I graduated? Anyways, he was really excited to see me. He said that he’ll make sure we meet up again.

I went to Simon’s house for the fourth time. I saw he’s cleared out a room that just used to be storage. He mentioned its available if I ever want to go easier on myself financially. He said I could stay with him while I take classes and train at the hospital, and that I wouldn’t even have to pay rent. It’s a bit of a tempting offer.

That’s pretty sweet of him. He seems to really enjoy having me around. Sometimes he calls me angel, it’s sweet. I noticed he’s been putting up a lot of paintings of flowers. I love flowers.

It’s been a while. Something bad happened. There was an accident at the hospital. I got half my face burned off. There’s a giant ugly scar there now and I hate it so fucking much. It’s been a bit since it happened but....it still hurts. I don’t like it. I think it makes me look ugly. Simon says it makes me pretty and special.

Simon got mad again. I told him my boss, which is an older man, has been hitting on me. I suggested that maybe I should contact the higher-ups of the company so it can’t happen to anyone else. But Simon didn’t like that. He’s making me fake a sick leave for a little bit. He even forged official papers and stuff. I think it’s kind of messed up, but Simon said it’s alright because now no one can be confused as to who I belong to. He says I’m his perfect doll and his alone. It’s sweet he thinks of me that way.

**Addendum-4:** On 04/20/20██, the foundation recovered several files of interest from the personal computer of SCP-4168-2 back at its home. The files included the following:

• A folder of a voice that had been put through a voice modifier. The voice clip was shown to SCP-4168-1, who revealed it was the same dialogue it had heard when initially ordering SCP-4168 over the phone.

• An email account under the URL of crystalsjewelrshelp@███████████████.com with a programmed response system.

• A folder labelled ‘Contacts for Ring.’ The contents included several phone numbers and emails, all of which failed to open.

> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Dr. Dots:** Hello SCP-4168-2. We found some interesting things while going through your home yesterday. We were wondering if you could maybe give me your insight and explanation for it.
> 
> **SCP-4168-2:** //(Laughs.)// Eh, I knew this would be coming. Can’t guarantee I can give you what you want, but what do you want to know? And let’s please try to make this quick.
> 
> **Dr. Dots:** Well, we’re mostly we’re interested in your motive. When we first interviewed you, you acted as if you were unaware of all that was going on. But with our recent finds, we see that you were well aware of the effects of the ring and even played the part of the jewellery store. Why did you do all this?
> 
> **SCP-4168-2:** //(SCP-4168-2’s smile fades, a more serious expression replacing it.)// You don't understand. I had no choice. She made me do this. I tried everything but she wouldn't listen. I told her countless times to depend on me, to need me as I need her. But she kept going behind my back. I gave her everything she could need, and she threw it back in my face. It's for her own good. Its what’s best for her. It's what's best for us. This was my only option. 
> 
> **Dr. Dots:** Why do you feel that way? Did you try something else before?
> 
> **SCP-4168-2:** I’ve tried just talking to her. I’ve tried simply asking her. But she simply didn’t listen. Marie has never had it easy. She never had anyone that could just be there for her like me. No one that dedicated themselves to her! I mean this was all not easy you know. But the hard work and labour were going to be worth it, until again, you freaks got involved and started acting like you know shit. You don’t! I mean, please! Just let me do this for her! She needs me!
> 
> **Dr. Dots:** We’ve observed that your behaviours have only been causing Marie distress. Haven’t you-
> 
> **SCP-4168-2:** No! NO! Stop acting like you know what’s happening. Marie got half of her face burned off from a work accident when she was working as a trainee at the hospital, that’s why she doesn’t work there anymore! If she would have just listened to me and stopped trying to pursue shit, it wouldn’t have happened. Even her new job at the office was bad for her because her boss kept hitting on her! That wouldn’t have happened if she had just stayed at my house! I don’t want to see her hurt! What you guys are doing is hurting her! It’s a simple concept. She stays near me, and she doesn’t get hurt. She just needed a little motivation to get that. But she //needs// me.
> 
> **Dr. Dots:** Marie appears to think otherwise. Since having some time separate from you-
> 
> **SCP-4168-2:** You know,  I appreciate you keeping me in containment with her, though I know you don’t want to. I mean I was able to do what I wanted with her since she’s you know, mine, but then you guys started monitoring and stopped me from as much as trying to touch her. Fuck you honestly. She needs to know that I’m there for her and that I love her!
> 
> **Dr. Dots:** It seems to me you’re acting less like you’re there for her, and more like you own her.

For Christ’s sake, there’s a whole stack of board games that she says she plays with the doctors while I’m passed out. Pathetic really. //I’m// the one she should be doing stuff with. I’m the only one she needs! I mean one minute you’re watching her rot for five days and the next you’re acting like kids at a sleepover. Which is it huh? I’ll make it easy. She’s not your friend. She’s a test subject to you.  I’m going to say this again. You don’t understand!
