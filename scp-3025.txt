**Item #:** SCP-3025


**Object Class:** --Safe-- Euclid


**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3025 is to be stored in a standard Storage Locker at Site-██. Testing must take place in a sealed chamber. Test chambers must be cleared for use before testing. Clearance is given to test chambers that show no sign of leakage when under 0.5 megapascals of internal air pressure. Test chambers are to remain sealed until it can be confirmed that SCP-3025 has exited its active state. Recovered items and personnel are to be quarantined until investigation has confirmed that no anomalous properties are present. As of ██-██-20██, testing of SCP-3025 is prohibited. When in transit, SCP-3025 must remain inside a hermetically sealed container at all times. SCP-3025 is under review for reassignment to Keter class.


**Description:** SCP-3025 is a white feather, thought to be a primary feather from a black-billed magpie (//Pica hudsonia//). Under most circumstances, SCP-3025 is inert and presents no anomalous features. When completely submerged in any solution composed of more than 80% water, SCP-3025 enters its active state. When in the active state, any objects within the same enclosed space as SCP-3025 will seem to spontaneously combust, with the exception of SCP-3025 itself and the solution it is submerged in. An enclosed space is defined as a continuous region through which air molecules can travel unhindered. An "object" is defined as any solid or liquid matter not physically bonded to the boundaries of the enclosed space. No upper limit in the size of an enclosed space has been found. After spontaneous combustion, objects will leave no ashes or remains of any kind. 

Testing with GPS trackers has shown that radio contact is still maintained after combustion, and that there is no measurable change in position before and after active state is achieved. SCP-3025 will remain in its active state until 23 hours after it is removed from the solution. Any additional space added to the testing chamber while SCP-3025 is in its active state will be treated as a continuation of the enclosed space, and objects within the new space will be affected by SCP-3025. Further details from testing are listed in Addendum 3025-1.

It is hypothesized that objects affected by SCP-3025 continue to exist within an extradimensional space (SCP-3025-A). Video cameras and live subjects affected by SCP-3025 report a barren landscape, with few traces of life. Early exploratory missions have revealed the presence of silver and gold deposits near the surface. Further details from exploration missions are listed in Addendum 3025-2. 

Any objects affected by SCP-3025 will remain within SCP-3025-A for the duration of the active state, after which they will appear in the test chamber at the same locations they occupied at the beginning of the active state. Any changes in composition or structure sustained while SCP-3025 is in its active state will remain. Upon cessation of the SCP-3025 active state, there is a low probability that an anomalous entity will manifest within the test chamber. Any such entities are referred to as SCP-3025-B. Instances of SCP-3025-B have no unifying characteristics beyond their anomalous nature. A list of SCP-3025-B instances can be found in Addendum 3025-3.


**Addendum 3025-1**

[[collapsible show="+Show Test Logs" hide="- Hide log"]]

All tests are conducted in a cleared test chamber. Tested aqueous solutions are held in a steel container that is also affected by the SCP-3025 active state. The disappearance of the container is used as an indicator of active phase initialization, and automatically ends the submersion of SCP-3025. This ensures the end of the active phase 23 hours after initialization.

||~ Test Number ||~ Materials ||~ Test Description ||
|| 1 || 1 liter of distilled water || SCP-3025 enters the active state instantly. At the end of the active phase, the container is recovered. The D-personnel used to administer the test is found deceased. The body has suffered second degree burns across 90% of its surface area. Further testing is to make minimal use of personnel. ||
|| 2 || 1 liter of oceanic salt water || SCP-3025 enters the active state after a 3 millisecond pause. It is hypothesized that this pause is related to the percent water content of the solution. ||
|| 3 || 1 liter of orange juice || SCP-3025 enters the active state after a 10 second pause.  ||
|| 4 || 1 liter of pig blood || SCP-3025 does not enter the active state. Eight hours were allowed to pass to confirm that the active state would not begin.  ||
|| 5 ||1 liter of pig blood, diluted with 100 milliliters of distilled water || SCP-3025 enters the active state after a pause of 20 minutes. ||
|| 6 || 1 liter of distilled water, 1 GPS tracker, 1 wireless video camera || SCP-3025 enters the active state instantly. Both items combust. Both GPS tracker and video camera maintain contact with Foundation radio receivers. Feed from the video camera reveals SCP-3025-A. There is no vegetation. The surface is spotted with chemical fires. The sky appears dark, as if polluted with soot. Upon reappearance, the devices sustain minor damage, but are otherwise intact. An instance of SCP-3025-A is discovered following this test. ||
|| 7 || 1 liter of distilled water, 1 wireless video camera, 1 D-personnel (D-45180) equipped with standard rations for one day || SCP-3025 enters the active state instantly. All objects in the test chamber combust. D-45180 does not appear to be injured by spontaneous combustion, but begins to show signs of mild discomfort soon after appearing in SCP-3025-A. At 10 minutes after activation, D-45180 continues to express mounting discomfort. It becomes apparent that severe burns are being inflicted on D-45180. At 33 minutes after activation D-41580 moves out of frame. Upon reappearance, the video camera has sustained minor damaged. Autopsy reveals that D-41580 expired from inhalation of super-heated air at approximately 6 hours after activation. ||

2 D-personnel (D-379012, D-409914),were equipped to survive the SCP-3025 active state. Both had been exposed to SCP-3025-A in Expedition Beta. After the events of Expedition Gamma, it is deemed worthwhile to equip D-personnel with high-yield incendiaries. Stronger thermal shielding is also deemed necessary. Radar trackers and multi-spectral cameras are supplied. Objective is to determine the nature of the entity encountered during Expedition Gamma.

**Addendum 3025-3**

[[collapsible show="+Show SCP-3025-B catalog" hide="- Hide catalog"]]

||~ Instance Number ||~ Instance Description ||
|| 1 || Discovered after Test 6. SCP-3025-B1 was an incorporeal being capable of telepathic speech and observation. It was constrained by the enclosed spaces, and had no ability to alter the physical world on its own. SCP-3025-B1 was discovered after the test chamber was opened, when Junior Researcher ██████ heard a disembodied voice. The voice instructed her to “Stop, before they see you”. Junior Researcher ██████ quickly informed her superiors. Test complex was immediately quarantined, and sealed for three days. Junior Researcher ██████ did not receive any further communications from SCP-3025-B1, nor did any other exposed personnel. SCP-3025-B1 was declared neutralized on ██-██-20██. ||
|| 2 || Discovered after Expedition Gamma. SCP-3025-B2 is a hostile sentient entity. SCP-3025-B2 is entirely invisible in all electromagnetic wavelengths. Through unknown means, SCP-3025-B2 casts a shadow as any non-anomalous object would. Analysis of the shadows cast by SCP-3025-B2 indicate that the entity is a static human figure, possibly a statue, holding an unidentified object in the right hand. SCP-3025-B2 [DATA EXPUNGED] any human beings in its reach. SCP-3025-B2 has a top speed of ███ kilometers per hour, but cannot pass through solid material. SCP-3025-B2 is repelled by bright lights and concussive blasts. It is thought that this response may reflect a desire to remain concealed, or prevent damage to the entity itself. After Expedition Gamma, the test chamber remained sealed, and the remaining mission personnel were lost. After 2 days of observation, it was deemed safe to cut a small hole in the test chamber and insert 300 pounds of high incendiaries. After the blast, SCP-3025-B2 ceased motion, though its anomalous interaction with light persisted. SCP-3025-B2 was sealed in a standard containment locker, and has not shown any signs of activity. ||
|| 3 || Discovered after Incident 3025-1, an accidental activation of SCP-3025. As of ██-██-20██, SCP-3025-B3 is uncontained. SCP-3025-B3 is a large mechanical construct that is hostile toward human beings. Its main purpose is to activate SCP-3025. In the case that SCP-3025 is activated by SCP-3025-B3, the appearance of an SCP-3025-B instance is guaranteed. SCP-3025-B3 is slow moving, and can be deterred by gunfire or explosives. All containment vessels occupied by SCP-3025-B3 so far have been destroyed. The whereabouts of SCP-3025-B3 are unknown, and attempts to locate it are ongoing.  ||
|| 4 || Discovered after Incident 3025-2, a hostile activation of SCP-3025. SCP-3025-B4 was a human infant with an adult human brain.

If a human being comes into direct contact with SCP-3025-B5, [DATA EXPUNGED]. ||
