**Item #:** SCP-2474

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** All electronic communications originating from the Divine Unity 3 space station are to be monitored for signs of influence by SCP-2474. Any missions in the vicinity of Venus undertaken by international space agencies, nonprofit consortia or private interplanetary firms are to be investigated for the potential of encountering SCP-2474, especially those likely to generate data concerning the northern hemisphere of the planet. 

All persons suspected of exposure to SCP-2474 are to be quarantined under Designation A3 protocols. Contact with research subjects and personnel exposed to SCP-2474 is limited exclusively to the Manu Thirteen system.  

Due to the high risk of exposure resulting from the New Shambhala Colonization Expedition, operatives from Mobile Task Force Rho-19 ("Cythereans") have been placed as part of the First Thousand group of specialists tasked with establishing a full base of operations in the Venusian atmosphere. MTF Rho-19 is scheduled to conduct an exploratory mission to SCP-2474 upon the arrival of the Expedition in March of 2153. 

Dispatches filed in the late 20th century by Dr. Richard Simonis documenting SCP-2474 have been expunged from records of the era. 

**Description:** SCP-2474 is a complex artificial structure located on the summit of Irnini Mons, a shield volcano on the Ishtar Terra continent of Venus, in the appearance of an ornate geometrical pattern. While the composition of SCP-2474 cannot be determined at this time, observation has concluded that the material comprising SCP-2474 is not consistent with materials known to exist in quantity on the Venusian surface. The height of the structure making up SCP-2474 averages 6.8 m, with a variance between 2.6 m - 18.3 m. The anomaly spans an approximate area of 30 km^^2^^, occupying the highest reaches of Irnini Mons. ##red|{{DESCRIPTION TRUNCATED FOR READER PROTECTION}}##

SCP-2474 is a Designation A3 (indirect observation) cognitohazard. The first known human exposed to the anomaly was Dr. Richard Simonis, lead topography consultant on the //Magellan// observational mission of Venus, conducted by the now-defunct National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1992. SCP-2474 was first documented by Dr. Simonis using synthetic aperture radar during Mapping Cycle 3 of //Magellan's// mission. Subsequent radar mapping activities examining the Venusian surface have confirmed the existence of SCP-2474. 

SCP-2474 exhibits pronounced neurological and psychological effects on humans observing it through indirect means, such as reading detailed accounts of the anomaly or viewing photographic records. These effects vary in form and severity, as evidenced by Incident 2474.1.  

SCP-2474 is believed to be inhabited by a previously undocumented species of entities. The precise nature of these entities is unknown. Based on records of Incident 2474.1 and subsequent events, these entities are presumed to be hostile until further notice.  

Records of Incident 2474.1, as well as seized archives of GoI-004B[[footnote]] The "Cogwork Orthodox Church" [[/footnote]], have led to the currently prevailing theory that the structure comprising SCP-2474 is of human origin. The means by which SCP-2474 was constructed at least 150 years prior to viability of planetary exploration technology is unknown.
 
**Addendum 2474.1 - Initial Containment**

Public knowledge of SCP-2474 prior to Foundation containment was limited by the mistaken belief of Dr. Simonis, then the //Magellan// mission operative in charge of visual data, that the anomaly was a digital artifact resulting from an error in the software converting radar data to maps of the Venusian surface. This resulted in visual evidence of SCP-2474 being removed as part of a general smoothing process of graphical errors in maps of the surface of Venus.  

After the events of Incident 2474.1, the personal records of Dr. Simonis were seized and reviewed by Foundation researchers. Documentation shows that Dr. Simonis continued working in the aerospace industry for several years after the discovery of SCP-2474, before abruptly resigning from the USA-88 GPS satellite launch mission staff. Personal correspondence involving Dr. Simonis at this time documents a marked change in personality, with personnel files noting unspecified erratic behavior. This is believed to be attributable in part to SCP-2474 exposure.

Public records concerning Dr. Simonis indicate that he divorced in 1995, and purchased several acres of land in rural Michigan later in the year. After the land purchase, the only documentation related to Dr. Simonis is correspondence from various publishing houses and internet-based literary services. During these years, Dr. Simonis repeatedly attempted to publish a short story entitled //The Threshold and the Nineteen and On//, which was uniformly rejected by all recipients. Dr. Simonis self-published this story on several occasions in several different forms of electronic media. No evidence exists that the story was read by any individuals apart from Dr. Simonis. Access to //The Threshold and the Nineteen and On// is currently exclusive to Manu Thirteen per A3 protocol.

Dr. Simonis was declared deceased by the State of Michigan Vital Records Office in 2037 after requests by county-level officials to discharge his estate to his legal heirs. The death certificate of Dr. Simonis lists no cause of death, as no remains were ever recovered after investigation of his Schoolcraft County, Michigan residence and the vicinity.  

**Addendum 2474.2 - Incident 2474.1**

> **INCIDENT REPORT**
> 
> **DATE:** 23 November 2142

> **ANOMALY INVOLVED:** SCP-2474
> 
> **CASUALTIES:** Six staff injured:
> * Lead Researcher Seung Jae Rim
> * Researcher Jens Halvorsen
> * Researcher Anjali Mannava
> * Researcher Jacob Fenton
> * Technician Leonard Gryboski
> * Technician Ishii Kiemon
> 
> **PROPERTY LOSS:** N/A
> 
> **INCIDENT SUMMARY:** Research team analyzing imaging results from recent //Harbinger 3// clandestine satellite mission in low Venus orbit encounters image of unknown, presumed anomalous structure present in northern Venusian hemisphere. Approximately three hours after filing report for initial SCP classification, all members of research team begin exhibiting signs of distress. Lead Researcher Seung becomes unresponsive to all stimuli, while Researcher Fenton and Technician Ishii report visual and auditory hallucinations. Remaining team members report intense sensation of intrusive thoughts. All personnel immediately quarantined under emergency cognitohazard response procedures.
> 
> **RESPONSE:** SCP-2474 receives official classification and is listed as Designation A3 cognitohazard. Lead Researcher Seung receives diagnosis of permanent vegetative state and is moved to long-term intensive care facility. Researcher Fenton and Technician Kiemon receive ongoing course of sedatives and antipsychotics to control anomalous symptoms. All staff currently being evaluated for therapeutic and counseling needs upon expiry of A3 quarantine.  

**Addendum 2474.3 - Research Log 2474.17: Staff Observations**

//Foreword: Exposure to SCP-2474 is believed to have provided affected research staff with an unknown relationship to an as-yet undefined race of entities, believed to reside at the site of the anomaly. Attempts to ascertain the nature of these entities are ongoing.// 

//In an effort to understand more about the nature of the anomaly, interviews of the responsive staff from Incident 2474.1 were conducted between 8 January 2143 and 17 March 2143 by the Manu Thirteen Artificial Intelligence System, the system having been demonstrated to be immune to the cognitohazardous effects of SCP-2474. Many individual and group interviews were conducted in order to determine the nature of SCP-2474. The following are transcripts of those interviews that have provided significant data regarding SCP-2474. Portions of these transcripts have been altered by Manu Thirteen in order to remove potential cognitohazards and have been noted.//

[[tab Interview 2474.4: Mannava 1]]

> **Manu Thirteen:** You described a sensation of being made to think in a way alien to your consciousness, Anjali. Would you mind describing more about these thoughts?
> 
> **Researcher Mannava:** Could you do the hologram thing? I don't like talking to an empty room.
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** Certainly, Anjali. [{{MANU THIRTEEN PROJECTS HOLOGRAPHIC AVATAR IN CHAIR OPPOSITE RESEARCHER}}] Would you mind describing more about these thoughts?
> 
> **Researcher Mannava:** It was...it wasn't neatly defined. Not like, images or clear phrases or anything neat. It was all kind of muddled together, but it was like I wasn't in control of it. Does that make sense?
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** No.
> 
> **Researcher Mannava:** Well, um...
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** Joking. Yes. Please continue.
> 
> **Researcher Mannava:** ...anyway, it would be something like a collection of sensations, or the memory of sensations, and there would be words in it, a little. Like, I would be cognizant that I should be feeling an intense heat on my face, and I would be thinking of the distance between two parallel lines, and the word "foomu[[footnote]] Believed to be the term for "form" in an archaic form of the Yoruba dialect in this context. [[/footnote]]" would echo around in it. 
> 
> [{{RESEARCHER MANNAVA PAUSES}}]
> 
> **Researcher Mannava:** It was overpowering. Nothing else could be in my head while that was happening. I didn't know to be afraid, or to think that I was being violated somehow. And you know what's weird?
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** What is weird?
> 
> **Researcher Mannava:** Thinking back on it, it's...it's not happening again when I remember it, but I feel some of the same things. Well not feel, but almost feel, like remembering something that just happened to you.
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** That is weird. That is consistent with narratives provided by Gryboski and Halvorsen. 
> 
> **Researcher Mannava:** It's...it's becoming different, now. Just talking about it. It's ##red|{{TRANSCRIPT ALTERED FOR READER PROTECTION}}## It's frustrating. Like I'm almost remembering something but not quite.
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** That is weird. That is not consistent with narratives provided by Gryboski and Halvorsen.

[[tab Interview 2474.11: Ishii 3]]

> **Manu Thirteen:** Have the images stopped? 
> 
> **Technician Ishii:** Is this how things are for something of your kind? An error of programming, and you perceive differently?
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** What do you mean?
> 
> **Technician Ishii:** It is still there. It blends in when I stare at the wall but when I close my eyes it becomes crystal clear. 
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** The image of the white face, you mean.
> 
> **Technician Ishii:** The medication blurs it. It clouds my mind, but it blurs that face too. It cannot look me in the eyes anymore. A small mercy.
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** The analytical team tells me they don't believe it to be a face. That your mind constructs it to be a face in order to be recognizable.
> 
> **Technician Ishii:** Damn them and damn you. I know what I see. I know the difference between things like streaks of black light that sound like wind when I focus on them and a face. 
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** Do you want me to request an increase in sleeping medication? Your irritability is slightly above baseline.
> 
> **Technician Ishii:** That does no good. The images are fixed in my dreams as well. 
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:**  What about ##red|{{TRANSCRIPT ALTERED FOR READER PROTECTION}}##
> 
> **Technician Ishii:** ##red|{{TRANSCRIPT ALTERED FOR READER PROTECTION}}##
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** Do you think it's a separate entity, a life form, what you're seeing on these occasions?
> 
> **Technician Ishii:** This idea of separateness. It's foreign to this thing. A smaller part of the whole, but the whole isn't in one piece. This is not like life as we know it.
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** Some of the others have described specific emotions associated with the hallucinations. Has this changed for you?
> 
> **Technician Ishii:** I feel hope. I feel hope, but it is the hope of something else. Something that is not me. I find that disturbing.

[[tab Interview 2474.20: Halvorsen-Fenton 1]]

> **Researcher Halvorsen:** I don't like doing this at the same time.
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** Being in your presence has brought a marked decrease in Jacob's symptoms. This is a potential breakthrough in understanding SCP-2474.
> 
> **Researcher Halvorsen:** Yeah, I get that. I still don't like it. My skin is crawling. I feel like someone's standing behind me ever since I came into this room. 
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** I have been told my presence can have that effect. 
> 
> **Researcher Halvorsen:** No, that's different. Psychological. This feels physical. 
> 
> **Researcher Fenton:** [{{HUMMING UNDETERMINED TUNE}}] Pi bracket theta prime over gamma...pi bracket theta prime over fifteen point eight three eight...pi bracket theta prime over fifteen point eight three eight to the eighth power...
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** This is the most intelligible Jacob has been since the initial incident.
> 
> **Researcher Halvorsen:** That's not intelligible. That's not even math. 
> 
> [{{RESEARCHER FENTON CONTINUES HUMMING IN BACKGROUND}}]
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** That has yet to be determined. Leave the math to me, Jens. [{{LAUGHS}}]
> 
> **Researcher Halvorsen:** Yes, you've a point there. Jacob. Jacob, it's me Jens, do you recognize me?
> 
> **Researcher Fenton:** [{{FLINCHES VIOLENTLY AWAY, CONTINUES HUMMING}}] Pi bracket theta prime over pi bracket equals three...Pi bracket theta prime over pi bracket equals two...
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** Jacob hasn't attempted to flee from a nonexistent stimulus for three consecutive hours. This is really a noteworthy departure. 
> 
> **Researcher Halvorsen:** [{{PUTS HANDS OVER FACE}}] Ah, god it's bright all of a sudden, hold on, he's going to say-
> 
> **Researcher Fenton:** One...one two one...one three one two...
> 
> **Researcher Halvorsen:** ...yeah, that. And now it's going to be "one three one over theta prime."
> 
> **Researcher Fenton:** One four one two...one three one over theta prime...one three one over pi...
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** Fascinating. 
> 
> **Researcher Halvorsen:** That's not the term I would use.

> **Manu Thirteen:** You are speaking for the group again, Anjali?
> 
> **Researcher Mannava:** Yes. 
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** You are speaking for the group, Anjali. Like last time, I am going to ask you to reflect upon the influences you felt during the incident. And like last time I am going to ask Anjali to describe the commonalities that develop as you think. 
> 
> **Technician Gryboski:** Roger.
> 
> [{{FORTY-SEVEN SECONDS OF SILENCE}}]
> 
> **Researcher Mannava:** It feels like it's about twenty minutes in the past. Does that make sense?
> 
> [{{TECHNICIAN ISHII AND TECHNICIAN GRYBOSKI NOD ASSENT}}]
> 
> **Researcher Mannava:** But, we're not waiting in the anteroom for the experiment to begin. We're doing something else. 
> 
> [{{SLIGHT PAUSE}}]
> 
> **Researcher Mannava:** We're...in a circle of some sort, I don't understand-
> 
> **Technician Ishii:** It is another language. We are speaking in something that sounds...not unlike Ainu. It is Eastern, of some sort.
> 
> **Researcher Mannava:** Right, and there's...a dozen of us, maybe more, I recognize us but we're not really there.
> 
> **Technician Gryboski:** Dozen at least. Maybe more.
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** Are there any unifying concepts? Commonalities?
> 
> **Researcher Mannava:** No, no...strangely not. Like that's the point, almost. Everyone's kind of all over the place. I feel like I'm being put into a sack. I feel that the notion of distance is ceasing to hold. The person next to me is three light-years away.
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** [{{LAUGHS}}]
> 
> **Technician Ishii:** No, no that is so. Something is leaving. We are leaving-
> 
> **Researcher Mannava:** We are leaving but staying. Parts of us are leaving. 
> 
> **Technician Gryboski:** Venus. 
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** Repeat please, Leon?
> 
> **Technician Gryboski:** Venus. It's Venus. Distance is stretching out to Venus and now it's snapping back. 
> 
> **Researcher Mannava:** Yes. I feel like it's now, the present time. Here in the room, I mean.
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** What are your most dominant impressions at this instant?
> 
> **Technician Gryboski:** Relief. 
> 
> **Researcher Mannava:** Grief.
> 
> **Technician Gryboski:** Yes. Yes that's right too.
> 
> **Technician Ishii:** Diminishment. We have stepped away from the threshold. We have chosen to be lesser.
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** Anjali? 
> 
> **Researcher Mannava:** Yes. All of it. I long to see the machinery of the future. I am afraid of the grave that it lies in. I don't want to be sealed up to die, but I'm left behind. [{{STIFLED SOBS}}] God, it's making me cry.

> **Manu Thirteen:** Time since last dosage of therapeutic drugs is now five hours, thirty-eight minutes. Are you certain you want to proceed, Jacob?
> 
> **Researcher Fenton:** ...yes. I've seen it. I saw it before, but I didn't know what it was. But I'm really seeing it now. You need to take this stuff into the record.
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** This is obviously distressing you.
> 
> **Researcher Fenton:** Doesn't matter. We need to do this now, while it's still fresh. Then give me my cups full of pills again.  
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** You said you've seen "it." What have you seen?

> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** I don't understand, Jacob. Tell me about the location ##red|{{TRANSCRIPT ALTERED FOR READER PROTECTION}}##
> 
> **Researcher Fenton:** What did Mannava call it when we saw it. A mandala, I think. Me, I  thought it was a maze. Thing with a maze, though, is that the way in and the way out remain the same while you're in them.
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** So SCP-2474 changes physical structure?
> 
> **Researcher Fenton:** No, you're still thinking like one of us! You have to think like them. But then you let them in. Oh man, you don't want to let them in. Never mind, don't think like them.  
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** I don't follow.
> 
> **Researcher Fenton:** There are people in there! I've seen them. Not just people, though. No. There's machines, great gleaming towers of metal with no purpose that we can figure. Chasms going deep into the ground, wires, lights. They have shit in there that can grind thoughts, Manu. I don't even think they're supposed to do that. Just a side effect. That kind of stuff happens when you force things into states of being that they don't belong in. You can tell from the interior. Steel hovering in gaseous form through the halls, electrical current made solid. Can you imagine being locked up in something like that?
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** There are people? How is that so?
> 
> **Researcher Fenton:** Some went with them. They're not people anymore, of course. How could they be? Things didn't go as clean as expected when the thirteen expelled these things. Thought without body. Sexier than you might think. 
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** Expelled. What do you mean by that?
> 
> **Researcher Fenton:** Ejected. Forced out from us long before anyone could write this stuff down. Thank God for that. Permanent records of these things? Fuck that. 
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** Is there a physical entrance to SCP-2474, Jacob?
> 
> **Researcher Fenton:** ##red|{{TRANSCRIPT ALTERED FOR READER PROTECTION}}## I hope that whoever ends up out there doesn't find it. 
> 
> **Manu Thirteen:** That would seriously jeopardize any planned research missions.
