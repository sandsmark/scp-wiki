**Assigned Number:** D-69420

**Former Name:** ███████ █. ████

**Date of First File:** April 28, 2014

**Date of Apprehension:** October 20, 2015

**Provisionary Warnings:** Euclid in the streets, Keter in the sheets

**Recovery Information:** D-69420 was recovered from their shitty one-bedroom unit in ███ ████ Apartments, ██████████, North Carolina on ██.██.██, found doing absolutely nothing with their life and being a general nuisance to the public. Upon arrest by Foundation agents, they were quoted as saying "do it, fuckers, now I don't have to pay rent." Following this point, they have been cooperative with Foundation personnel regardless of their terrible, terrible morals and the fact that they all smell like they use Lysol as perfume.

Despite monthly amnesticization, D-69420 still seems to recall their legal name and even the results of the 2016 United States election, despite being unable to gain knowledge of the event from within Foundation imprisonment. On 11.09.16, they were reported by cell block guard Agent ██████ to have said "just keep me in here, come to think of it. Now the entire US government has worse ethical reasoning that even you guys, so I don't give a shit anymore."

With the exception of being unfathomably annoying at all times, D-69420 is compliant with testing procedures.

**Notes:**

> "Please just terminate that one already."
> -Agent ██████, 09.29.16

> "Why are they giving me bedroom eyes?"
> -SCP-████, ██.██.16

> "No one is going to convince me that that number actually got randomly generated. Get me Director Aktus, this is pissing me off."
> -[[[spookybee-s-author-page|Dr. Hollands]]], 10.02.16

> "They can't even dab properly, so how are they of any use to this organization?"
> -Agent ██████, 11.25.16

> "I'm calling the police"
> -Dr. ████████, 12.05.16

**About:**

The title of this page is a reference to a line from the //best movie in the world,// just so you know.

Hey, guess who did that amazing CSS? That'd be [[*user InitHello]]. Deets and licensing info [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-1623280/sexycontainmentprocedures#post-2723116 here.]

Anyway, I'm Cyan. My username means cyan and chartreuse. (It was originally just going to be Chartreuse, but that was taken on Wikidot. Ultimately I'm glad I went with this because "Char" would have been an odd nickname as opposed to Cyan.) Specifically #00ffff and #ceff00 when it comes to my graphic design stuff. Did you know that there are quite a few people who remember chartreuse as red or deep magenta rather than yellow-green, and that [http://mandelaeffect.com/chartreuse-red-or-green/ some believe] that and phenomena similar to it might potentially prove that alternate realities are more than science fiction?

So, I'm actually pretty boring. I just hide how boring I am with all this crap and just being a dumbass in general. I've been in the SCP fandom since early 2014 and it's one of my favorite things in the world. I support goofy Foundationverse canon and 2srs Foundationverse canon in equal parts, and it shows in my writing; there's room for all of our headcanons here on the site, and they can overlap in wonderful ways.

I work in the film industry as of late, which was a welcome change from my boring retail jobs. I legit used to sell dildos for a living at one of Adam & Eve's competitor retailers, I shit you not. That shit only paid 7.50 an hour and was totally not worth the customer interaction. Life's wild bro.

Anyway, please feel free to reach out to me about anything, particularly cosplay and graphic design (the stuff I'm actually good at, unlike literally anything else). I'm pretty chill and down to talk to anyone, no worries. I'm also junior staff on the licensing team, so please feel free to reach out to me if you need help!

,,Also, important note, I very recently (December 2016) came out as nonbinary after months of mental turmoil and questioning. I owe my thanks to [[*user thedeadlymoose]] for helping talk me through everything I was feeling and worrying about. Pronoun-wise, I really prefer 'they' but if you know me from before[[footnote]] Obviously I didn't bother changing some of the testimonials in this section and whatnot. [[/footnote]] I came out and you slip up //once// in a while, I won't chop yer head off.,,

[[[baby-s-first-guide-to-keter-class-anomalies-and-other-questi|“Baby’s First Guide to Keter-Class Anomalies” and Other Questionable Documents Recovered from the Hard Drive of Dr. ████ ███████]]] was written simply because I wanted [http://sexycontainmentprocedures.tumblr.com/post/132712054467/i-am-finished-with-the-book-i-talked-about-my this popular Tumblr post of mine] to be canon. The original book was created for my friend and her husband as a silly present for their baby shower in November 2015. Baby's Guide was my first article on the site under this account, and the canon I later built around it became integral to my reputation around these parts.

[[[Colors]]] was inspired by EldritchCyanide’s short writing challenge from October on the wiki’s official blog, for which my entry was [http://scp-wiki-official.tumblr.com/post/131009476633/nsfw-ish-i-dont-see-you-through-cameras-and this.] I decided that I really wanted to explore that idea further, especially for a skip that is so highly rated but gets so little attention, so I sat down and started writing.

[[[SCP-1471-J]]] is just as annoying as the real 1471’s app, but a little less sanity-threatening. It’s the mainsite version of [http://sexycontainmentprocedures.tumblr.com/post/135611225962/joshandpizza-sexycontainmentprocedures this post] - just like what happened with Baby's Guide - and it’s how I got away with saying “gonna put my Keter-class anomaly in your containment chamber” in an SCP article.

[[[breach-my-containment-baby|Love and Relative Dimensions in Fate]]] is literally about Clef sticking a reality anchor in the Doctor's butt, and somehow it still continues to get upvotes(???). WrongJohn seems to think it’s the Tenth Doctor, but I wrote it as the Eleventh (because bowties); however, I’m actually not even a Whovian in the first place, and I know next-to-nothing about the DW universe/canon, so whatever. I only picked this one because Orgy Five Counsel 9: XXXK End-of-Virginity Scenario was already taken when I looked at the contest page for the first time. (Written for the April Fool’s Day crackfic contest.) | Coldpost.

[[[colors-part-ii|Colors, Part II]]] is the sequel to the first Colors and it was completely unplanned. It spawned from a lack of drive to finish the SCP article in my sandbox by the end of the month to meet my personal deadline goal, and I didn’t intend to make Colors into a series, but I guess it could become one. | Coldpost.

[[[the-fine-print|And What Was a Soul to That Blank White World]]] was my entry for the [[[d-class-contest|D-class contest.]]] It explores my longstanding headcanon that, yes, the Foundation really is ethically confused enough to demote its own employees to D-class, and yes, some of said employees really are ethically confused enough to allow it to happen and even see the line of reasoning that led to it. | Coldpost? I think it was; I can't really remember.

[[[SCP-2708]]] is a sequel of sorts to Baby’s Guide, but it’s more intended to give context to the implications in Baby’s Guide. It’s also intended to just be one of those weird-ass sexual skips, and I’m surprised with how well-received it is. Fun fact: The cognitohazard in it is also a tattoo I'll be getting soon, albeit the unredacted version of it, of course. | Coldpost.

[[[too-old-to-lie-too-cold-to-love|Too Cold to Live, Too Young to Die]]] is the final, third installment in the Baby’s Guide/2708 mini-canon. It came to me at random that day and I spent seven hours writing it (it’s 4800 words), another hour editing, another 20 minutes Photoshopping the ‘scanned’ document you see (it was never actually scanned), and about three minutes deciding to go ahead and do another coldpost since I was on a streak of them anyway. It has some sexual content, but don’t get too excited. It’s just romantic drama with my typical sprinkle of ethically questionable characters and anti-Foundation narrative. | Coldpost.

[[[theres-no-place-like|Home for the Holidays]]] is my first second-person piece on the site, and it took me damn well long enough, given that second-person is my favorite perspective to write. It doesn't have a traditionally structured narrative arc, and is instead intended as a snapshot of a day in the life of an underappreciated job position. Throw in some self-loathing and seasonal depression and you've got the full picture. | Coldpost.

[[[SCP-2738]]] is, in my opinion, my "first SCP." I'm a tale person due to the way I process narratives, and thus, my other two skips were a -J and a tale-ish format screw. This, on the other hand, is just a straight-up skip. It was first written in July 2016, a long while back when I was a retail worker, but I had a few periods of rewriting and abandoning on repeat before I finally posted the final product.

[[[SCP-2758]]] is a lot of things. It's probably my favorite skip I've written. It's the issue with the entire notion of containment, I think; at what point will the Foundation say "enough is enough," if not even when the case in question is that the thing contained is literally triggered by containment itself? It's a loophole of logic and reasoning, and it's got the Foundation stumped. Of course, if they'd left well enough alone, maybe it wouldn't be so upset in the first place. Truly paradoxical, isn't it?[[footnote]] [[image message.gif]] [[/footnote]]

[[[the-fine-print-ii|A Billion Brilliant Colors and a Spirit Less Than Human]]] is the sequel to [[[the-fine-print|And What Was a Soul to That Blank White World.]]] It's about the same character... or is it? Maybe it's about you. All of us are just stored files in a database, after all. | Coldpost.
