**Item #:** SCP-2253

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The building exhibiting the SCP-2253 phenomenon has been converted to a Foundation research site. SCP-2253 is legally a brewery which is also a Foundation front organization, with the brewers being given Level 2 security clearance. An underground research laboratory has been constructed under SCP-2253 studying samples of alcoholic beverages previously created within SCP-2253. Any anomalous beverages produced by SCP-2253 are to be stored within Site-77.

**Description:** SCP-2253 is an anomalous brewery located in Springfield, NJ, USA. Whenever alcoholic beverages are brewed on the premises, they have a 5% chance being mixed with an protoplasmic substance. In addition, a spectral humanoid entity resides within SCP-2253 with limited ability to manipulate its surroundings.

This free-floating spectral humanoid(SCP-2253-1) identifies as Stephen Crane, an American politician who served as a delegate to the Continental Congress from 1774 to 1776.[[footnote]]Crane died in 1780 after being bayoneted by a British soldier.[[/footnote]] It is apparently in a perpetual state of intoxication. SCP-2253-1 is capable of exerting up to 20 kg of force and excreting various protoplasmic fluids. These excretions usually manifest as SCP-2253-1's sweat, vomit and other bodily excretions.

The alcoholic beverages containing SCP-2253 protoplasmic fluids are non-anomalous, with chemical analysis revealing that it is identical to Ethyl Hexanoate[[footnote]]which produces an apple-like aroma.[[/footnote]]. These, along with samples of SCP-2253-1's excretions being retained for research. Consumption of the beverages has shown enhanced taste and flavor, although testing has shown mild to severe abdominal discomfort when consumed after eating tea, fish and chips, and other British cuisine.

SCP-2253-1 is cooperative, and researchers are encourages to converse with it whenever possible in order to learn more about its origins and properties.

> 
> **Dr. Alford:** If you're feeling unwell, Mr. Chrane, I can reschedule this interview.
> 
> **SCP-2253-1:** Nah, what do you take me for, some sort of Molly[[footnote]]An effeminate man.[[/footnote]]? Have I seen you before? You're not the same bloody hoddy doddy[[footnote]]A short clumsy person.[[/footnote]] fellow they had last week... or the unlicked cub [[footnote]]Rude, uncouth lad.[[/footnote]] before that.
> 
> **Dr. Alford:** Well, there are many of us with great interest in your case. You're like a living record, a unique historical insight.
> 
> **SCP-2253-1:** Yeeeah! Upended the old order, with those old country fussocks[[footnote]]Slovenly women.[[/footnote]]! Walloped them right good, didn't we? Hell! Wish I'd been around to seen it.
> 
> **Dr. Alford:** Where did you go?
> 
> **SCP-2253-1:**: Don't change the subject! I wish to continue denigrating those bastard English. They thought we were milking the pigeon[[footnote]] Try and do the impossible.[[/footnote]] with our uprising, but we showed them! They're not going to be maneuvering the apostles[[footnote]]Robbing Peter to pay Paul.[[/footnote]] in America any longer.

> 
> **SCP-2253-1:**  After that, it got a bit less clear. This was great ages ago, mind. I remember I found my wife yoked[[footnote]]Married.[[/footnote]] to another. He was a real nickey ninny[[footnote]]Simpleton.[[/footnote]] too. Wish I could have framed him in a sheriff's picture frame[[footnote]]The gallows.[[/footnote]]. But I still found it satisfying to . Seeing them dance a goat's jig[[footnote]]A couple having enthusiastic sex.[[/footnote]], drove me to drink.
> 
> **Dr. Alford:** You didn't drink before then?
> 
> **SCP-2253-1:** No, don't let me give you that impression. It was a compulsion now, rather than a source of joy. The monarchists can't take that away from these new gentlemen. They've brought that joy back, haven't they, huh? A terrific change of events. I haven't felt this fluid in ages. 
> 
> **Dr. Alford:** Could you elaborate on that?

**History:** SCP-2253's properties were initially noted after being purchased by a craft brewing operation. It is unknown if SCP-2253 has its effects prior to this due to preexisting records being destroyed by Hurricane Diane. Initially, SCP-2253-1 attempted to frighten the new occupants out of SCP-2253 by creating noisy disturbances and projectile-related activity. However SCP-2162-1 ceased its harassment after learning that they intended to brew alcoholic beverages. Following this, protoplasmic substances began appearing in beverages created within SCP-2253.

Due to the name of the brewery,[[footnote]]"Stephen Crane's Pubbery"[[/footnote]] agents of Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. began investigating shortly after this initial opening, believing it to be a Foundation front. MC&D agents made several offers to purchase SCP-2253, all of which were refused by the owners. The refusal was partially motivated by SCP-2253-1's distaste towards a British corporation. MC&D, in turn, believed their business to be a front for the SCP Foundation to monitor their New England activities. 

MC&D attempted to seize SCP-2253 by force on ██/██/████. After initial success in securing the property and detaining all occupants, SCP-2162-1 became hostile and began using cooking utensils, brewing equipment benches and granite counter-tops as projectile weapons against the MC&D Agents. Local police began to respond to reports of an ongoing shootout, and brought Foundation office's attention the situation. Three MC&D agents were captured, and fifteen local police officers were administered Class-B amnestics. 

As of ██/██/████ SCP-2162 is classified as Safe.

**Addendum:** Investigation into SCP-2162-1's claims to be Stephen Crane has been ongoing, due to the entity making frequent incorrect or impossible statements about Mr. Crane's life. SCP-2162-1 has attributed this to its age and intoxication, but other theories about persons who have died on the property or could be considered candidates for other reasons.

* Samuel Chase - Signer of the declaration of independence. SCP-2162-1 has claimed to be a judge in the past, frequently when the owners of SCP-2162 were discussing legal procedures and taxes.
* Unknown youth - Obituaries from 1915 indicate that a youth attending college in the area struck his head on concrete and was killed at a costume party taking place in the area. Notably, the party was apparently put on by a local historical society.
