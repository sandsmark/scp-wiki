**Item #:** SCP-4875

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Persons theorized to be carriers for SCP-4875 are to be covertly tested on the Affective Neuroscience Personality Scale, and thereafter monitored if results rate them highly. Should subjects attempt to behave in a way consistent with SCP-4875, they are to be restrained and immobilized indefinitely or until amnesticized.

A Foundation-operated bot (ESTIBEN.aic) is to monitor internet traffic in Central and South America for conjunctive references to disappearances, missing persons, cameras and smartphones, deserts, nostalgia, depression, and cityscapes. ESTIBEN.aic is also to search video-sharing websites and social media for media containing depictions and/or recordings of SCP-4875-1. ESTIBEN.aic is to then notify Mobile Task Force Ni-13 ("Triskaidekaphobia"), who are authorized to amnesticize involved individuals and take physical evidence to [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3874 Facility-57] [[footnote]] 'Facilities' are the internal term for Foundation Sites in Hispanic countries under the authority of the Regional Council of Latin America [[/footnote]] for study.

No personnel assigned to either SCP-4875 or MTF Ni-13 are to originate or hold citizenship in the Republic of Chile, the Republic of Peru, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, or the Argentine Republic.
It is recommended that personnel assigned to these positions should not have spent any time in these nations prior to assignment.

**Update 12/13/2016:** As of the events on 9/13/2016, should a subject affected by SCP-4875 be found, MTF Ni-13 is authorized to terminate on sight, and to distribute Class-C amnestics to all individuals connected with the subject.

No personnel stationed at Facility-57 are to have spent any time in the affected nations, including nonessential Level 0 janitorial, clerical, or catering staff. No personnel are allowed to leave the campus of Facility-57, and are to blindfolded when traveling through the rest of the country. Due to their responsibilities entailing them leaving the site regularly, members of MTF Ni-13 are to undergo biweekly psychological evaluations and therapy designed to reduce feelings of connection to their surrounding environment, families, and colleagues, as well as a therapeutic regimen of low-grade Class-A amnestics.

**Description:** SCP-4875 is a theorized inactive compulsive effect residing within 13% of the population of Latin American countries. The country with the highest range of affected subjects is Chile, at 65% of cases originating there, with 25% originating from surrounding nations and the remaining 10% distributed throughout the rest of South, Central, and North America. SCP-4875 is activated through strong feelings of nostalgia, connection, and melancholy, with strong brain activity in the inferior frontal gyrus, substantia nigra, and cerebellum. All subjects rate highly on the Affective Neuroscience Personality Scale, which measures a person’s tendency towards sadness, even if previous applications of the test showed that they did not rate highly.

Once sufficient brain activity occurs, subjects affected by SCP-4875 experience a compulsion to walk away from their position toward an indeterminate central point, estimated by Foundation mathematicians to be located in the Atacama Desert. Subjects also experience several failures in the parts of the brain that deal with perception and fight-or-flight response, often speaking and reacting in a similar way to each other. After a minumum of thirty minutes of travel, the subject spontaneously enters SCP-4875-1, still affected by SCP-4875. Should affected individuals be unable to move, they will enter SCP-4875-1 after a similar thirty minute period. Subjects who are able to move but do not are unable to enter SCP-4875-1; all subjects must voluntarily move or be unable to.

SCP-4875-1 is an extra-dimensional location of indefinite size, with geology and weather patterns resembling that of the Atacama Desert. Radio, internet and satellite communication do not penetrate SCP-4875-1. It has variable characteristics, the most common being massive topographical anomalies, inconsistent geometry, a sky displaying both unknown constellations and light green hue, and a large number of worn-down buildings and structures constructed from a iron, steel, and an unknown metallic material. Some of these structures roughly match patterns of buildings in the Chilean city of Santiago. Individuals affected by SCP-4875 do not seem to be alarmed by these characteristics, save an attitude of docility and mild curiosity due to the perceptive failures. Direct footage of SCP-4875-1 has a moderate memetic effect, occasionally triggering more cases of SCP-4875. [REDACTED].

Between three minutes to two hours of travel within SCP-4875-1, all items present on the affected subject (e.g. phones, cameras, wallets, currency, etc.) will return to their last location prior entering SCP-4875-1, with the exception of clothing. All subjects affected by SCP-4875 are irrecoverable, and do not remanifest at any point.

SCP-4875-2 is an unknown hostile entity residing within SCP-4875-1. It is presumed to be sapient.

**Addendum 1 - Discovery:** SCP-4875 was discovered on 2011/08/31, following the disappearance of Argentinian high school student Luca █████████. A cellphone was recovered in a public park three miles away by his family containing a 5 minute, 33 second long recording of the interior of SCP-4875-1, transcribed below. The original video was uploaded by the subject’s family to YouTube, gaining 660,750 views and triggering approximately twelve more SCP-4875 cases.

**TRANSLATED FROM SPANISH:**

**[0:00]:** //(Camera shows a distant view of the park with benches and trees. The image bobs up and down, likely due to the subject walking.)//

**[0:10]:** //(Camera focuses on a distant view of several tall metallic structures protruding from sand dunes. They are in a state of bad disrepair. The view shudders and blurs briefly before stabilizing,)//

**[0:15]:** And...we're here. Very well.

**[0:20]:** Y'know? This reminds me of those times when I went with Valentín to school. There always was this wind, and a lot of dust between the school and us. It was fun. We talked lots and... //(Ten second pause. Camera blurs, and focuses down on some dust on the subject's shoes.)// What a pity he's not here anymore, right? What a goddamn shame. Ah, not a day goes by that I don't miss that asshole. Playing football, and gaming, and...

**[0:44]:** //(Camera looks up to the horizon again. A clearer view of the metallic structures can be seen. They are towers constructed from rusted steel with numerous windows. Several are clustered around each other, with the outermost appearing more heavily degraded than the central ones. They have a number of inscriptions and symbols engraved, some of which correspond with real world logos, some of which are unknown. Text seen consists of the “Lorem ipsum” placeholder text.)//

**[0:59]:** This collar I have, this... //(Camera points down around to show the chest of the subject, from which a necklace with a cross hangs. Notably, the left arm of the cross is broken.)// This was his.

**[1:13]:** //(The wind picks up, creating a small sandstorm.)// Now is when the van would come, the yellow Vitara. //(Subject stops. He holds out the necklace with his right hand in front of the camera.)// It’s because of the impact. It crashed hard, and he, uh, well, he got to be the cheese in the sandwich, so to say...heh.

**[1:51]:** //(Subject is close to a previously unseen [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3333|metal cabin]]], supported around five meters above ground by metal pillars. The pillars are encircled by metal stairs, ending at the door of the cabin.)//

**[1:56:]** I really don’t know why I’m thinking about these kinds of things.

**[2:17]:** //(Subject walks up the stairs, and the wind dies down. Throughout the ascension, the camera views thirteen structures similar to the stilted cabin in the distance, all on a large flat plain leading to the base of a mesa or butte. The wind picks up again. When the camera focuses again on the cabin, a sheet of metal can be seen detaching from it and being carried away by the wind. The subject observes the cabin silently for around a minute.)//

**[3:39]:** Solemnity... //(Subject hangs the necklace from a doorknob in the cabin's door. The wind pulls it, but it stays in place. The camera abruptly ducks, and turns around to observe the dunes and towers in the other direction.)// This place is nice. I could see myself living here, between the sand and metal. Between the ground and sword. Very nice. Valentín, very nice.

**[4:12]:** //(Camera moves slightly, and a bigger metal tower can be seen from afar. It is wider than the others, and has a more heavily rusted appearance except for the very top which seems to shine intensely.)//

**[4:20]:** //(Subject throws himself from the stairs to the ground, and there is a loud wet crunch.)//

**[4:22]:** //(The camera focuses on a break in the subject’s leg, initially zooming on the bone protuding through the wound before looking at the blood pooling in the dirt. There is no audible reaction. After ten seconds camera swings around towards the shining structure. Subject begins slowly pulling himself upwards, and begins slowly limp-crawling towards the structure)//

**[4:23]:** Gravedigger, gravedigger, release him from this earth, won’t you? Can I stay here for him? It would be a comfort.

**[7:50]:** //(Subject continues limp-crawling until recording ends.)//

**Date:** ██/██/2015

**Affected Subject:** D-4220

**Notes:** After being questioned for signs of SCP-ES-███ infection, SCP-4875 was triggered in D-4220, a native of Chile. Recognizing SCP-4875 activation, D-4220 was given a high definition camcorder to record the event, to which D-4220 consented. A 1 hour, 12 minute, 59 second log was recovered.

**TRANSLATED FROM SPANISH:**

**[0:00]:** //(The video begins at a point outside Facility-57, roughly a thirty minute walk from the entrance. D-4220 begins walking towards an open field.)//

**[0:08:** //(A flat, rocky desert. An artificial rectangular structure can be seen from afar. Due to the distance between the structure and D-4220, other details cannot be interpreted.)//

**[0:11]:** A cactus softens my fingertips with its skin. They have skin, yes?

**[0:34]:** //(D-4220 walks towards the structure. The wind intensifies slightly. The terrain begins to show a marked inclination downwards  towards the structure. This is believed to be a topographical anomaly. D-4220 begins descent.)//

**[12:45]:** And the dunes... //(D-4220 stops descending, and the recording focuses on the structure. Between it and the subject stand a number of dunes. There were no dunes present before.)//

**[23:55]:** //(As D-4220 summits a dune, a blurred figure can be seen. The recording zooms in on it, showing that it is humanoid, and covered in rags. The figure seems to be burying something. While D-4220 descends from the dune, the figure begins walking away at greater speed than D-4220. D-4220 begins to slowly chase it. After ten minutes of pursuit, the figure is too far away to be recorded by the camera. The structure is no longer visible.)//

**[46:25]:** What a shame, getting away so much... It's not good to raise a son like that, and even less when one's mother dies so soon in the morning. Tsk-tsk.

**[51:12]:** //(D-4220 summits another dune, and the structure is visible again. The recording then pans,  showing that D-4220 is in a huge crater. Around the crater, thirteen squat rusty towers stand, their their tops shining intensely. They are markedly identical to the one in the initial video. Surrounding them are a sea of sand dunes. There is no trace of the rocky, flat landscape.)//

**[52:27]:** Almost like home. Like when I brought Martín home and pushed him from the window. I always knew I did that because I missed mom and dad. They didn't hug me. //(D-4220 keeps walking towards the structure.)//

**[57:23]:** //(The structure, now recognizable as a derelict, rusted building resembling a factory, is only a few meters away.)//

**[57:50]:** Thirteeen monkeys dancing in the tree.

**[58:12]:** //(D-4220 enters the structure. It is dark, illuminated only through skylights in the roof. There is no machinery, although outlines in the ground show that something was recently removed. A rusted pillar can be seen about ten meters away.)//

**[59:22]:** Singing and praying, begging for rain, dying in thirst.

**[1:05:00]:** //(D-4220 reaches the pillar. A metal plaque is engraved at the height of the camera, reading "Bárbara Castillo," and a key hangs from a small hook on the plaque. D-4220 examines the pillar.)//

**[1:07:14]:** Each one singing, their hands in their ears, mouth and eyes, the childhood I lost... Yes, I accept the offer. Of course I do. What am I, a crazy person?

**[1:07:20]:** //(A distorted shriek can be heard somewhere below the camera.)//

**[1:12:57]:** And then when the lightning strikes the tree...!?

**[1:12:59]:** //(There is a bright light, and a crashing impact is heard, immediately followed by high-pitched child-like laughter, The recording ends.)//

**Date:** ██/██/2015

**Affected Subject:** Dr. Martín Quintana

**Notes:** Dr. Quintana became affected by SCP-4875 sometime after the death of his father, Iván Pérez. Pérez was a political dissident during the Pinochet regime and escaped death on multiple occasions. A 43 minute, 50 second video log was recovered from a cellphone in his house, two days after the incident took place.

**[0:00]:** //(The recording begins with a black screen, due to the camera being obstructed.)//

**[0:05]:** [in English] I’m oh so glad I have my wits about me to record today.

**[0:12]:** //(After twelve seconds from start, Dr. Quintana removes the obstruction, his hand, showing a desert plain. A large number of metal towers are dispersed throughout, mimicking the layout and architecture of the city center of Santiago. One in the distance appears to mimic the Torre Entel, a notable communications tower and landmark. A few buildings appears to have apparently broken in half. The towers show a number of windows, but the insides are too dark to observe.)//

**[0:17]:** Ah, my city, my city where I was born...

**[0:30]:** //(Subject walks between the towers. Some crevices and cracks can be seen in the ground, through which sand falls. Ten large cracks can be observed.)//

**[0:47]:** Although I wasn't really born here. I was born afar, but I died later and was born here later, too late to be a kid, too soon to be a man. Bad times. They threw them from helicopters, right?

**[1:13]:** //(The density of the buildings diminishes. The layout no longer resembles Santiago. Between two collapsed towers, a massive metal human hand of similar size to the buildings juts from the rock. It has thirteen fingers. It appears to be resting on top of a half-buried tower similar to those seen in the first recovered video. Dr. Quintana observes quietly for thirteen minutes.)//

**[13:21]:** A hand of thirteen fingers offers me something. I take its hand, and accept its offer.

**[13:30]:** //(The camera turns abruptly, and focuses on a particularly high building similar in construction to the Gran Torre Santiago skyscraper. After thirteen seconds, it collapses and crumbles, producing a massive cloud of dust. A large fissure opens in the ground as it falls. Half of the crumbled building remains on the sand, while the other half plunges into the fissure.)//

**[17:45]:** //(The voice of Dr. Quintana becomes agitated.)// No, this is not my home. It's a home made for me. //Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...// A home made for me. //(Dr. Quintana walks towards the collapsed tower.)//

**[23:12]:** //(As Dr. Quintana reaches the structure, a huddled humanoid figure can be seen beside it.)//

**[24:17]:** Mother why did you leave so soon? Couldn't you leave me my home? I would have built an altar for you to live. I know it wasn’t our choice, but...

**[25:30]:** //(Dr. Quintana kneels in front of the figure. Long, blonde hair covers the figure's face, and it is now distinguishable as female.)//

**[25:47]:** Perhaps...perhaps...perhaps... //(The recording enters a hole in the rubble of the collapsed tower. The interior is identical to that of a train, entirely metallic.)// There is no ten, all my ten is now dead.

**[26:00]:** //(Dr. Quintana enters the tower through a window, and walks straight for ten minutes. The interior displays impossible geometry and seems to have elongated.)//

**[36:34]:** Wait, what the fuck? My house, where's my house? My house! //(Dr. Quintana attempts to run in the opposite direction, towards the entrance.)// This is not my house! Where is this place?!

**[37:43]:** Deals cannot be undone.[[footnote]]Despite audio analysis showing this sentence as being in the voice of Dr. Quintana, it is significantly more high pitched and distorted.[[/footnote]]

**[38:00]:** //(Dr. Quintana briefly screams. There is a distorted, guttural scream from somewhere off camera. The camera falls to the ground. There is a brief liquid dribble followed by a wet snap.)//

Around the school are a number of collapsed buildings made of metal bricks. This is the only known instance of SCP-4875-1 that is not a desert, being instead akin to an abandoned city.)//
