**Exploration Log 2016**

> **Day 1**
> 
> **Findings:** First exploration of the tower. Agents are sent to map the structure. Five floors in total are counted, each with an area of approximately 360 sq. m. The tower is made of stone blocks, and contains minimal furnishings. Most of the interior space is occupied by the libraries and laboratories. Several potted plants are found throughout the floors. Samples of the plants, air and water are taken. Analysis shows no differences between samples and real world equivalents.

> **Day 2**
> 
> **Findings:** Further analysis of the libraries is made. Over 3400 books are counted. Most of them contain information about the anatomical workings of several animal species, including humans. Another frequent subject is the list of physical principles of electricity and how it functions in the nervous system. Most books display illustrations which can be found in several medieval textbooks, although books from the seventeenth to twentieth century were also found. A smaller portion of the books contain texts about the nature of the soul and the afterlife.

> **Day 3**
> 
> **Findings:** Analysis of the laboratories is made. Most of the equipment resembles chemistry apparatus from the nineteenth century, while others have yet to be identified. Several flasks containing amino acids and organ tissues from humans are scattered throughout the laboratories. Most of the equipment have no obvious function, while others seem to be replicating the Miller-Urey experiment. 

> **Day 4**
> 
> **Findings:** A hidden passage in the fourth floor is discovered. The passage leads to a living quarters with minimal furnishing and multiple family paintings and ash urns. In several of the paintings a figure similar to SCP-2016-1 and SCP-2016-2 can be seen. 

> **Day 5**
> 
> **Findings:** Another secret passage is found, this time in the first floor. The passage leads to a type of basement. Several coffins containing corpses in various states of decomposition are found. Each coffin is marked with a name, date and information about the corpse's health before death. None of the corpses show signs of violent death. 

> **Day 6**
> 
> **Findings:** Another secret passage is found, this time inside the tower's basement. The passage leads to a round, brightly lit, underground chamber containing several surgical tables. Each table has a preserved corpse in it, with several machines of unknown purpose attached via cables to the corpses. Several journals detailing experiments with the corpses are found. The machines and corpses are brought to a Foundation facility to be studied.

> **Day 10**
> 
> **Findings:** The purpose of the machines is discovered. After days of analysis, a corpse was reanimated by using one of the machines. The reanimated subject remembered all of his memories from when he was alive. The subject was kept under Foundation custody for further study. 

> **Day 12**
> 
> **Findings:** A journal was found in the tower's basement. Inside the journal were also found small paintings of an adult human female, a young girl and a figure resembling SCP-2016-1 and SCP-2016-2.  Said paintings had the phrase "I'll bring you back, I promise" written into them with black ink. Below are two notable excerpts from the journal. 

**Addendum 2016-Beta:**


> "Elizabeth died yesterday of a heart attack. Susan and I are the only ones left. I don't know what to do anymore. She is crying and afraid, and nothing I say comforts her. I can't blame her, she is only a child, going through all of this. I've already buried Elizabeth in the basement. Susan keeps asking me why this is happening, why God is letting it happen. I don't know what to say, but I keep telling her everything will be alright, even if I know it isn't true. I have to be strong for the both of us. She goes to sleep sobbing every night, and I try to tell her some of her favourite stories, but she doesn't want to listen to any of them. She just keeps saying she wants Mommy and the rest of her family back." 
> 
> "I've had an idea. It's crazy and inhumane, but I have to try it. It's the only option that remains. I used Elizabeth's knitting tools and what's left of our dream reagents to make some dolls. I can't leave the tower physically, so I will send them away to whoever is willing to use them. I hope none of the hunters find them. I'll bring anyone who uses the dolls here and teach them what I know. I need to buy some time for my research. May God forgive me for I am about to do."
