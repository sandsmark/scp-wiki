**Item #:** SCP-1343

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1343 is to be contained on location at the abandoned construction site in the northernmost tube of the ████████ Tunnel Complex.

Until removal plans for SCP-1343 are finalized, public use of the adjacent southern tunnel tubes will continue.  On-site staff are to monitor all tunnel tubes periodically, and to report unusual observations.

In the event of a SCP-1343-1 sighting, on-site staff will direct local authorities to redirect traffic before notifying Overwatch HQ.

**Description:** SCP-1343 is a sealed concrete 10 x 10 x 12 meter container that municipal construction workers discovered buried in a hillside in ██████ █████ County, California, in 19██.  The container's contents are not currently known to the Foundation.

Initial attempts to drill through SCP-1343 resulted in a series of severe traffic collisions in the active tunnel tube adjacent to the construction site.[[footnote]] SEE: Addendum-1: Excerpt from ██████ █████ Times, Police Reports - █████ █, 195█ [[/footnote]]  Construction of the northernmost tube stopped in 197█ when the project was formally halted due to budget shortfalls.  The Foundation took over the site in 1982, after local authorities recorded the first images of SCP-1343-1.[[footnote]] Egilsrud, P., Prevention and Control of Highway Tunnel Fires, FHWA report RD-083-32, 1983 [[/footnote]]

SCP-1343-1 appears to be a severely damaged 195█ Ford Thunderbird.  The vehicle has been sighted periodically in the active highway tunnels adjacent to SCP-1343.  It appears each year on █████ █ at approximately ██:██ hours, and it has appeared on other occasions after SCP-1343 has been disturbed.

In a typical sighting, SCP-1343-1 appears when a witness rounds a turn approximately ███ meters into the tunnel, at which point drivers have described the entity accelerating toward them while engulfed in flames.  Believing a head-on collision to be imminent, most witnesses react by swerving into the tunnel's walls or into oncoming traffic.

The Foundation estimates that SCP-1343-1 has resulted in approximately ██ civilian traffic accidents, with 93% involving driver and/or passenger fatalities.

> {{Saturday, 2:53 a.m. – An accident involving a gasoline truck in the north tube set off a fire in the ████████ Tunnel Complex. The accident caused major damage, and all tubes were closed to traffic while repairs were made. During the fire, the tunnels acted as a natural chimney venting the smoke, flames and heat toward the east side entrance to the tunnel.}} 
> 
> {{The accident and fire killed seven people. In all, two people died in the initial crashes, five were killed by the smoke and fire, and two were hospitalized for smoke inhalation. All others escaped unharmed.}}
> 
> {{Several survivors closest to the initial pileup each described an overturned Ford Thunderbird with an 8th driver trapped inside, who was last seen struggling to free himself from the burning vehicle. However, no driver or vehicle matching this description has been discovered among the pileup wreckage.}}
