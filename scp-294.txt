**Item #:** SCP-294

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** There are no standard special containment procedures on file for Item SCP-294. However, only personnel of security clearance level 2 or higher are allowed to interact with it (see document SCP-294a). SCP-294 is currently being stored in the 2nd floor personnel break room and is monitored by two guards of security clearance level 3 at all times.

**Description:** Item SCP-294 appears to be a standard coffee vending machine, the only noticeable difference being an entry touchpad with buttons corresponding to every alphanumeric character of the English language. Upon depositing fifty cents US currency into the coin slot, the user is prompted to enter the name of any liquid using the touchpad. Upon doing so, a standard 12-ounce paper drinking cup is placed and the liquid indicated is poured. Ninety-seven initial test runs were performed (including requests for water, coffee, beer, soda, and non-consumable liquids such as sulfuric acid, wiper fluid, and motor oil) and each one returned a success.

It is of note that after approximately fifty uses, the machine would not respond to further requests. After a period of approximately 90 minutes, the machine seemed to have restocked itself. It is also interesting to note that many caustic liquids that would have eaten through a normal paper cup seemed to have no effect on the cups dispensed by the machine.

Further testing is scheduled, especially for liquids of extreme temperatures such as molten metals and liquid nitrogen. As suggested, SCP-294 was moved to the 2nd floor personnel break room as a money-saving venture. Following incident 294-01, guards were stationed at the item and a security clearance became necessary to interact with it.

**Document SCP-294a (regarding incident 294-01):** On August 21, 2005, Agent Joseph ██████ attempted to utilize Item SCP-294 to obtain coffee during his alloted break time at 9:30 AM. At the request of Agent █████ █████████ "to see what it would do", ██████ requested "a cup of Joe" from the item. Moments after confirming the selection, Agent Joseph ██████ began to sweat profusely and complained of dizziness before collapsing. After being moved to the infirmary, the medical team recovered the contents of the cup dispensed by Item SCP-294; a foul-smelling combination of blood, bits of flesh, and other various bodily fluids. Most disturbingly, testing revealed the DNA sequence of the biological material dispensed by Item SCP-294 matched that of Agent ██████.

Agent ██████ made a complete recovery in the infirmary after four weeks of rest and intravenous hydration. X-rays and CAT scans showed no further signs of injury, and ██████ was released. Both agents were reprimanded. Recommend additional security placed in the area of Item SCP-294.

**Addendum [SCP-294f]:** After reviewing documentation on SCP-294, ███████████ suggested testing SCP-294's ability to 'retrieve' specific liquids from several distances. The theory [DATA EXPUNGED]. Included in ███████████ report was a suggestion of using SCP-294 as a method of assassination by draining a target's fluids. Use of SCP-294 in such a way is **highly** discouraged, primarily for the possibility of discovery.

**Addendum [SCP-294g]:** Attempts to use the paper cups delivered by SCP-294 to contain [[[SCP-075]]]'s acid excretion resulted in failure. Apparently, the paper cups can only contain the liquid last selected in SCP-294's touchpad. Further testing of this phenomenon is scheduled.

**Addendum [SCP-294h]:** With the overseeing of O5-[DATA EXPUNGED] "a cup of [[[SCP-075]]]'s acid" was used as input. The product was proven to be the requested liquid and the cup was successful to contain the material. However, the report for incident 075-07 was acknowledged 2 hours after the test(See Addendum [SCP-075m]).  A containment procedure breach had occurred exactly the same time the test of acid retrieval was taking place, waking the [[[SCP-075]]] to its active stage. It was able to produce an amount of acid equal to the capacity of a coffee cup before emergency containment procedure was applied and it was rendered passive. The liquid was not found in the post-incident investigation. Further testing of SCP-294 is suspended. Object Class changed to Euclid as of 17 April 2008, Keter suggested. **Requesting new containment procedure.**

**Addendum [SCP-294h] Response:** SCP-294 not qualified for Keter level, however guards are given instructions to kill all non-researchers requesting any liquid beyond scope of normal consumables. Testing is cleared to resume.

**Addendum [SCP-294i]:** Researcher punched in request for "cup of gold". The machine promptly dispensed a cup of molten gold. Researcher requested similar precious materials with the same result. While the possibility of material gain is very high, an advisory is in place to only do so once per 3 months to avoid arousing suspicion (see Addendum [SCP-294f])

**Addendum [SCP-294j]:** Researcher punched in (from a safe range) request for "cup of anti-water". The machine hummed briefly, then displayed "OUT OF RANGE" on entry pad. It is theorized that SCP-294 has a limited range of collection, and cannot reach into alternate universes/dimensions.

**Addendum [SCP-294k]:** Researcher punched in request for "diamond". SCP-294 again briefly hummed, then displayed "OUT OF RANGE" on entry pad. This is the result the machine gives for all solid substances. As diamond is a solid crystalline form of carbon, it appears the machine will not dispense liquid carbon, as this does not result in a "diamond". When "cup of carbon" was subsequently punched in, the machine promptly dispensed a cup of liquid carbon. The melted carbon took over an hour to cool down to a safe temperature. Again, SCP-294 appeared to be immune to the damaging effects of the dispensed liquid. Testing for gaseous substances at room temperature have been suggested.

**Addendum [SCP-294l]:** Upon reviewing surveillance tapes, it was discovered that a newly recruited technician punched in request for "cup of hydrogen", and liquid hydrogen was dispensed, which violently bubbled and evaporated. When researcher subsequently requested a "cup of carbon monoxide," a similar event happened, and technician █████ was found dead a few minutes later. Although it is fortunate that █████ was alone at the time, the lapse in security was noted.

**Addendum [SCP-294m]:** Teleportation testing for range of SCP-294's delivery has been initiated. A special novelty compound is currently being used, as there is a large unlikelihood of being replicated in nature, or for culture. It is a mixture of undisclosed ratios of ███████ brand bleach, █████ ██ ███ █ brand cola, MET-RX powder, and Garam masala. As this fluid is useless for any other purpose, we can control its manufacture and deployment. Dr █████ is the only person who knows its name and mixture ratio, but a contingency plan is in place in case of his demise.

**Addendum [SCP-294n-01]:** First test has been implemented. The fluid has been created, and placed in a sealed container  25 metres away from SCP 294. When asked for it, the fluid was dispensed successfully, and when the container was opened, the liquid was gone. Meetings are being held on what spacings should be used to test the range of SCP 294.

**Addendum [SCP-294o-01]:** Upon concerns of Keter qualities, Researcher ███ ██████, under observation of Level 4 clearance personal, keyed in a request of "The best drink I've ever had" and was dispensed a fluid similar in appearance to cola.  The researcher identified it as a mixed drink he recalls having at a bar during his bachelor party, and was convinced it was the "best drink".  It is important to note that ██████ did not know what ingredients were in the drink besides rum and cola.  Further tests are scheduled to ascertain how SCP-294 gathers information.  

**Addendum [SCP-294o-02]:** 2 subjects keyed "My favorite drink" consecutively.  A white fluid and a blue fluid were dispensed respectively. Upon consumption of their own "favorite", each subject were overcome by euphoria and began to display seizure-like behavior which lasted for approximately 12 minutes. After they calmed down, each subject tried the other's beverage. While extreme pleasure was observed for both, they insisted that their own drink was better. Far more shocking, however, was that analysis of the drinks identified 68 previously unknown substances, including 12 non-terrestrial elements. Upon these results, it is concluded that SCP-294 ability to gather information extends far beyond simple telepathy into a possibly omniscient ability to satisfy conditions. Motion to raise to Keter was denied, but all testing involving referential or descriptive statements has been forbidden under termination without authorization of O5 personal. Requests for testing inputs of "The greatest drink ever" and "A fluid that can kill [[[SCP-682]]]" have been taken under review.

**Addendum [SCP-294q-01]:** Subject keyed "the perfect drink." The machine dispensed a cup containing an odorless lavender liquid. After drinking the liquid, subject appeared to go into shock. Subject later committed suicide, leaving a note which read "I'm sorry, but at this point everything's just one big letdown." Requesting such a drink again is highly discouraged. None of the components of the drink have yet been identified.
