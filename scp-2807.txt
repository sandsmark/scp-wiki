**Item #:** SCP-2807

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment is focused on controlling access to SCP-2807. Due to its useful effects, Site-04 has been converted to a medical site.[[collapsible show="              " hide="             "]]Bring my living brothers to me.[[/collapsible]]

Site-04 is to be cordoned off for a 3 km radius and have limited access as a sacred area and archaeological dig. Site-04 encompasses SCP-2807. [[collapsible show="              " hide="              "]]This land has been consecrated with the blood of my brothers. Allow no one access.[[/collapsible]]

Access to SCP-2807 is limited to D-class personnel. D-class personnel with medical training should permanently staff the facility. If Foundation personnel lacking these qualifiers enter SCP-2807, they should be immediately stripped of their clearance and reclassified as D-class.[[collapsible show="                   " hide="                "]]My home is a sanctuary for them. Outsiders are not welcome.[[/collapsible]]**Description:** SCP-2807 is located in Eastern Turkey, near the ancient ruined city of Ani.
SCP-2807 refers to Site-04 in its entirety except for the control center, which exists separately from the rest of site. 

SCP-2807 refers to a previously abandoned Foundation storage facility, estimated to be more than 200 years old, and most likely abandoned after the [REDACTED] event. Despite several breach attempts, the storage facilities inside remained intact. [[[SCP-1215]]] and several archives were recovered. [[collapsible show="                    " hide="                "]]You dragged us from our homes, our children, and our wives, with no cause. To be used in your sick experiments.[[/collapsible]]

SCP-2807's effects were initially noted in the D-Class recovery wing - analysis of medical statistics across Foundation sites indicated that grievously injured (4 - 6 on the Abbreviated Injury Scale) D-class recovered ███% more often than projected, even when controlling other factors. Several D-class were also recovered from injuries previously thought to be lethal. However, such medical anomalies only occur in D-class on site - treatment for other Foundation personnel remains within standard boundaries.

Do not allow it to be used against you.[[/collapsible]]

**Item #:** SCP-2807

**Object Class:** --Safe-- ##blue|Keter##

**Special Containment Procedures:** ##blue|Foundation personnel without Level 4 clearance or higher should be redirected to the incomplete document. It is believed that SCP-2807 cannot access information with a clearance above Level 3.##

--Containment is focused on controlling access to SCP-2807. Due to its useful effects, Site-04 has been converted to a medical site.-- [UNAUTHORIZED EDITS REMOVED] ##blue|SCP-2807 requires at least 300 D-class in varying states of injury at all times. Source of injury must come from testing or accident - the anomaly can differentiate between injuries deliberately caused and those from testing.##

Site-04 is to be cordoned off for a 3 km radius and have limited access as a sacred area and archaeological dig. Site-04 encompasses SCP-2807. [UNAUTHORIZED EDITS REMOVED]

Access to SCP-2807 is limited to D-class personnel. ##blue|Wings -7 through 14, -19, and -21 have been walled off. Access to these wings is strictly prohibited, except in the case of an 2807-Golf event.## D-class personnel with medical training should permanently staff the facility. In the event Foundation personnel lacking these qualifiers enter SCP-2807, they should be immediately stripped of their clearance and reclassified as D-class. [UNAUTHORIZED EDITS REMOVED]

##blue|In the event that D-class at SCP-2807 drop below the required amount trigger an 2807-Golf event, one member with ranking of at least Site Director[[footnote]] Although all Foundation personnel of this rank are by definition essential, it is a necessary sacrifice to prevent an EK-class Foundation collapse scenario.[[/footnote]] must enter Wing -19, and one D-class elevated to their position.## 

##blue|One copy of this document must remain in a server at Site-04 at all times, and re-examined weekly for any possible changes.##

**Description:** SCP-2807 is located in Eastern Turkey, near the ancient ruined city of Ani.
--SCP-2807 refers to Site-04 in its entirety except for the control center, which exists separately from the rest of site.-- ##blue| SCP-2807 refers to the malicious entity that has manifested in Site-04, as a result of previous activities undertaken by the Foundation prior to [DATA EXPUNGED]. This entity possesses knowledge of Foundation security practices and can directly influence D-class. D-class have been supplied with network usernames and passwords, door passcodes, Foundation identity cards and [REDACTED], believed to be a result of effects of SCP-2807. The anomaly also has the ability to alter Foundation documents, but does not appear to have access to documents cleared above Level 3. The anomaly appears to be mollified by the presence of D-class, especially injured D-class.## 

Site-04 refers to a previously abandoned Foundation storage##blue|, testing and D-class processing## facility, estimated to be more than 200 years old, and most likely abandoned after the [REDACTED] event. Despite several breach ##blue|and destruction## attempts, the storage facilities inside remained intact. SCP-████ and several archives were recovered. [UNAUTHORIZED EDITS REMOVED]

##blue|Archaeological analysis and documentation acquired prior to the sealing of several of Site-04's wings has revealed the function and history of Site-04 prior to its reactivation. See Document 2807-2 - Historical Information.##

Some fragments of Foundation records were recovered from the sealed wings.

> ....the current batch of D-class is progressing on target. The use of SCP-████ has allowed us to accelerate the process by 60%, with minimal side effects. It should also resolve the quality control issues we had last batch with aggression and resilience, which was probably just an unintended consequence of using prisoners of war. This current batch is mostly political and religious prisoners - they should prove to be more malleable and easier to mold for our purposes. As for the progre....

> ....t's been a mess here at Site-04 the past couple of days. Retraining Chamber A was out of commission this week - some of the candidates attacked staff and had to be neutralized. We've carried out Protocol Makron to maintain order. We're safe, but there's a mountain of corpses in Wing-19, and it's going to take a couple days for the crematorium to get through them. Otherwise, things are running smoo...

> ...looks like they're shuttering this place for good. We'll keep a small detachment here for the storage of a couple anomalies, but the R&D department came up with something that obviates the need for this kind of process. They've dubbed it an 'amnestic'. It's gone through trials and seems to do exactly what we need it to do. Sites ██, ██, ██, ██, and ours are all closing. We'll be reassigned to new posts at the end of this month. Remaining batches in progress should dosed with these new 'amnestics' and set to projects as normal in lieu of completing the regimen. We've also noticed a couple irregula...

Aside from Foundation records, several notes, likely made by D-class occupants, were found either in hidden notebooks or in graffiti carved into cell and holding chamber walls.

> A woman hugged me and cried today. I do not understand why.

> Everything I knew was wrong - everything I was told was a lie.

> I thought I saw hell at Borodino, but at least I understood what happened there. This defies explanation. Barbarism knows no bounds.

> I can't... can't remember my name. Who am I? Why is this happening?

> Walls are windows. They can see everything.

> I've been here six and thirty weeks. There is no end in sight. Meredith, if you find this, know that I never stopped loving you.

> I'm not getting out. I know that much. They'll shoot us dead or feed us to that thing before we make it out. Maybe someone might find this in the future, so that this never has to happen again, and if whatever monsters keep us here try to cover this up, this will stand as proof. My name is Francis Bright, I am - or at least was - a Union surgeon in the civil war between the northern and southern states in the United States of America. I was captured in the aftermath of the battle outside Chickamauga. From there, I was sent to the Andersonville prison. There, I was starved, sickened, and I witnessed the death of many of my comrades in arms from scurvy and dysentery. Our water supply was frequently filled with human waste. 
> 
> From there, I was shipped across the ocean to this godforsaken place. In Andersonville - as hellish as it was - the problems were ones of logistics. The rebels were out of food, so we had nothing to eat. Our suffering was caused by lack of supply and incompetence, not malice. Here - the facilities are clean, there's plenty to eat - but they choose not to utilize that to our benefit. The guards and staff are well-fed, but we get a small piece of bread, and small amount of water per day. Prisoners that get sick are only treated if they feel it necessary. There are eight of us per room in rooms hardly fit for two. We fall asleep every night and wake every morning to the sound of human suffering. There are no natural light sources - we can hardly tell from one day to the next. They'll take ten prisoners, kill two, and grind them into paste. They'll take the other eight and torture and beat them into submission. Sometimes, people go into these torture sessions - and come out different. Like they forgot who they were, what this is, and what kind of hell they're living in. They're usually pretty quickly moved away from the site too. This place was made to break us. For what purpose, I do not know.
> 
> Anyone that tries to stand up to them is swiftly whisked away, never to be seen again. I don't know what's going on here, or why, and I don't think I'm going to get the opportunity to do so anytime soon. I'll try to keep adding more to this note - but I may be killed or changed without warning. If you find this note - please, stop whoever is doing this. If they are gone, make sure this never happens again.
