**Occupation:** Field researcher, minor anomalous item research, Librarian

**Profile:** A snarky self proclaimed narcoleptic, Dr. Tonne can often be found in his down time sleeping in his office or looking through the latest additions to the Foundations log of anomalous items, for objects he can claim which relate to his interests in western animation and modern folklore. Despite being one of the quieter and calm, Dr. Tonne's disconcerting bodily movements and intentionally grimaced smile often make his overall presence somewhat discomforting and baleful. Despite much evidence pointing towards this behaviour being simply an uncontrollable physical habit of his, many staff have insisted that Dr. Tonne appears to enjoy the sight of other researchers flinching in his presence a little too much, for him not to realise to some degree what he is doing. Not only this, but his occasional moments of complete panic and rage during intense situations such as emergency evacuations and containment breaches, tend to discredit his reputation as an experienced researcher.

One thing to note about Dr. Tonne is his relation to arachnids, having shown interest in multiple spider like anomalies in the past, expressing a hatred for the scent of conkers and by far the most ironic, the fact that he himself, is an arachnophobe. Dr. Tonnes tendency to just ‘accept the weird’ has led to his overly accepting attitude of anomalies. When questioned about this, Dr. Tonne has claimed keeping one foot in reality is often not enough to keep himself grounded in it, especially when the remaining seven aren’t.

Dr. Tonnes unnaturally quiet and unforeseeable nature has surprised staff on multiple occasion. Reaching a point where literal hours have passed before anyone even notices he is in the same room as them. One notable event being a during a discussion which included top secret information regarding SCP-████, which ended with Dr. Tonne being promoted to clearance level 3 by Dr. ██████, in-order to avoid them the embarrassment of explaining why no one noticed a level 2 researcher in the meeting room, and bothered to tell him to leave before discussing confidential information strictly for level 3 personnel and above. All Dr. Tonne has reported recalling from this meeting is ’Something about a pyramid that swears allot’ and ’Someone landing on a third moon’.

Dr. Tonne is currently stationed at Site-17 working under researcher Dr. Weppler.
