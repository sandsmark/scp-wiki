title:Dr. Tonne's personnel File
**Name:** Dr. Phillip N Tonne

**Security Clearance Level:** 3

**Occupation:** Field researcher, minor anomalous item research, Librarian 

**Profile:** A snarky self proclaimed narcoleptic, Dr. Tonne can often be found in his down time sleeping in his office, enjoying walks through Site-17 or looking through the latest additions to the Foundations log of anomalous items, for objects he can claim which relate to his interests in western animation and modern folklore. Dr. Tonnes tendency to doubt his own skills has often led to him relying on the help of others, being a person who has multiple people check his assigned work before completing it. 

Dr. Tonnes quiet and calm demeanour is somewhat ruined by the slightly baleful atmosphere that tends to follow wherever he goes, caused by his demented desire to make staff as uneasy and nervous around him as possible when he feels it need be, through his disconcerting bodily movements and a grimacing smile. Not only this, but his occasional moments of complete panic and rage during intense situations such as emergency evacuations and containment breaches tend to discredit his reputation as an experienced researcher slightly. 

One thing to note about Dr. Tonne is his relation to arachnids, having shown interest in multiple spider like anomalies in the past, the bizarre rumour of his own shadow casting multiple limbs and by far the most ironic, the fact that he himself, is an arachnophobe. Dr. Tonnes tendency to just ‘accept the weird’ has led to his overly accepting attitude of anomalies. When questioned about this, Dr. Tonne has claimed keeping one foot in reality is often not enough to keep himself grounded in it, especially when the remaining seven aren’t. 

Dr. Tonnes unnaturally quiet and unforeseeable nature has surprised staff on multiple occasion. Reaching a point where literal hours have passed before anyone even notices he is in the same room as them, much to their surprise. This has allowed Dr. Tonne to attend multiple scientific lectures and meetings in the past without any existing prerequisites, but he is often too distracted at the time to take in much valuable information. One of the most notable meetings being a discussion including top secret information regarding SCP-████, which resulted in him being promoted to clearance level 3 by Dr. ██████, in-order to avoid them the embarrassment of explaining why no one noticed a level 2 researcher in the meeting room, and bothered to tell him to leave before discussing top secret information strictly for level 3 personnel and above. All Dr. Tonne has reported recalling from this meeting is ’Something about a pyramid that swears allot’ and ’Someone landing on a third moon’.



Dr. Tonne is currently stationed at Site-17 working under researcher Dr. Weppler.
