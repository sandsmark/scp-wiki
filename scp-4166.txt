**Description:** SCP-4166-1 is a female human class-C reality bender responsible for the creation of SCP-4166-2 and SCP-4166-3. It displays numerous psychological ailments, including aversion to men, fear of sleeping, PTSD, and suicidality.
 
Medical analysis has discovered significant scarring on the palms, feet, and genital area. Additionally, SCP-4166 exhibits extreme cachexia if not administered 1 cc of human semen weekly.

Every seven days, or in times of increased distress, SCP-4166-1 manifests an instance of SCP-4166-2 (if one does not currently exist).
 
SCP-4166-2 is a mute shadow-like humanoid figure with no defining visual features which otherwise exhibits typical human characteristics. Upon manifestation, SCP-4166-2 enters the room containing SCP-4166-1 through the primary method of entry, regardless of barriers. It then attempts to approach SCP-4166-1.

If SCP-4166-1 retains the memory of containment of SCP-4166-2, SCP-4166-2 proceeds to take action to counteract previous methods of containment, up to and including manifesting with weaponry. 

Upon termination, SCP-4166-2 instances demanifest instantaneously.

SCP-4166-3 is a three phase mental illness affecting individuals who have observed an instance of SCP-4166-2, lasting for the duration of SCP-4166-2's manifestation.

SCP-4166-1 was raised in a Catholic orphanage twelve years prior to the hospitalization of Father █████ in an apparent case of spontaneous combustion. Six days afterwards, the first manifestation of SCP-4166-2 occurred on 07-24-2008. During this manifestation, a gunshot attracted the attention of the nuns. Upon entering the room, they found SCP-4166-1 alone, holding a pistol at the entrance to its room. Authorities were notified of the incident, leading to the retrieval of SCP-4166

> 
> **SCP-4166-1:** Yeah. I know. I //know//. I just. God. It's hard to say. It's impossible to say. I hoped it would be obvious what my damage is, you know? I guess not though. You already know a lot of my personality from asking the nuns.
> 
> **███:** Yes, they told me a lot about you. How hard working you were, how devout. Albeit fearful without reason at times. They really did --
> 
> **SCP-4166-1:** You, they didn't tell you about... About me? Shit, I mean, I, I was? I am? I am those things. Or was? I don't know anymore. God. Did they tell you anything about, about uh, that?

> **SCP-4166-1:** Fine. Fine then. Let me paint you a picture. Going out at night, not coming back for a few days. Fear. Constant panic attacks. Hypervigilance. Sleep troubles, eating issues? Any of this sound familiar?
> 
> **███:** I'm afraid those symptoms are shared by a lot of different illnesses. But, to me, it sounds like something traumatic happened to you.
> 
> **SCP-4166-1:** Yes. Something traumatic happened to me.

> **███:** Prior to the manifestation of SCP-4166-2?
> 
> **SCP-4166-1:** Things don't just appear. Things don't just come out of the dark for no reason. Yes. Prior to the manifestation.

> 
> **SCP-4166-1:** I... hated the church. I hated being there. I hated being there and feeling like I was sin. Like I was sin incarnate. They treated me like that, you know? I was five. They didn't know how to deal with me when I started being "symptomatic". //[SCP-4166-1 grimaces.]// They called it weakness of the flesh. When I'd cry, or say things I wasn't supposed to, or do, uh, things inappropriate for my age. I was hit. I was shunned. I was made to repent.
> 
> //[SCP-4166-1 pauses.]//
> 
> **SCP-4166-1:** I was worthless. I was a demon. And even though even //I// am obligated to reject him, I talked with the devil.
> 
> //[SCP-4166-1 begins to tear up.]//
> 
> **SCP-4166-1:** And eventually, after years and fucking years of being hit and being dirtied, I made a deal, you know? I made a deal to make it fucking stop. I made a deal to make him pay. To make him burn like I did, to //feel// like how he made me. But that was for a price, of course. I made the deal in exchange for having to seduce and sleep with a dude once a week. But I was, pardon my French, a fucking slut back then. Fucking //horrible//. Christ. Christ. So, so I didn't care. It was a fucking //upside// to me. God. God. Christ. Forgive me.
> 
> //[SCP-4166-1 clutches its temple with both hands, pressing into its eyes with its palms.]//
> 
> **SCP-4166-1:** For the first time in my fucking life I felt powerful. I felt in control. I got the power to kill him and I didn't even fucking do that right. I should've known demons don't die so easily.
> 
> //[SCP-4166-2 manifests.]//
> 
> **SCP-4166-1:** I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry for--
> 
> //[SCP-4166-2 begins approaching SCP-4166-1. Emergency containment protocol ECP-166 initiated.]// --losing it. I should've been better than that. I have to be. I'd like to, I'd like to stop for today.
