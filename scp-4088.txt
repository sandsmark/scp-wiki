**Item:** SCP-4088

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4088 is to be held in a standard secure storage facility sized appropriately for a grand piano to move freely. SCP-4088 is to be fed 1 sheep every week. Testing that involves additional feedings or different diet is to be approved of by at least 2 Level 3 Personnel. SCP-4088 is to consistently monitored for any changes in behavior. SCP-4088-1 is to be kept within a standard containment locker at least 30 meters away from SCP-4088-1's containment cell. Testing between SCP-4088 and SCP-4088-1 is to first be authorized by at least 1 Level 3 Personnel. Any music played by SCP-4088 is to be recorded and sent to Head Researcher Zarakolv

**Description:** SCP-4088 is a sentient black grand piano of unknown make or model. The lid and outer rim of the interior of SCP-4088 are covered in 3 rows of black teeth, appearing to be made of the same material as SCP-4088 itself. The interior of SCP-4088 is unknown, as all attempts at viewing it have shown a featureless black hole where its interior components should be. SCP-4088 is mobile, moving around by bending it's legs at the base of the piano as if there were joints. SCP-4088 is predatory, and attempts to mimic a normal grand piano with an open lid and remaining still to lure in prey. SCP-4088 then will wait wait until any large creature comes within 0.6 meters of it, then will lurch towards the prey and attempt to slam its lid shut on the prey. SCP-4088 will continue to do this until the prey is deceased, then it will drop the prey into its interior where the body will disappear. 

SCP-4088-1 is a 53 meter long rope composed of average nylon and polyester. At the end of the rope is a 1.6 meter long metal nail, found to be composed as a currently unknown metal. When tested alone, SCP-4088-1 has shown no anomalous properties. SCP-4088-1's anomalous properties only manifest when left in a closed room with SCP-4088 and not observed. Upon continuing observation, the nail of SCP-4088-1 is found driven into the ceiling of the room, with the rope of SCP-4088-1 wrapped around and suspending SCP-4088. The way that this occurs is currently unknown, as it only appears to occur when no humans are observing the room though any means. The way that SCP-4088-1 is able to support SCP-4088 is also unknown, as SCP-4088 is presumed to weight as much as an average grand piano, or about 362 kg. When any subject walks directly beneath SCP-4088, SCP-4088-1 will suddenly break and SCP-4088 will fall onto the subject. The subject that is standing under SCP-4088 when it is falling will not attempt to retreat, and only looks up at SCP-4088 with a terrified expression. SCP-4088 falling onto the subject almost always ends in death, with the cause of death being either blood loss or spinal shock from a broken neck. SCP-4088 doesn't appear to be damaged when it falls from SCP-4088-1, even from extremely high heights. After SCP-4088-1 is broken, it begins to regrow the length of its rope through unknown means, at a rate of 2 meters regrown an hour.

**Addendum:** While it its predatory state, SCP-4088 has been observed playing several well known classical songs. These songs have been generally described as "suspenseful" or "overwhelming" and a full list of songs SCP-4088-1 has played has been provided. It is unknown how SCP-4088 plays these songs, as its keys appear to depress themselves with no outside force.

||~ Song Played ||~ Amount of Times Played ||~ Reason for Song Played ||
|| Toccata and Fugue in D Minor || 87 || This appears to be the song SCP-4088 uses the most to draw in prey. ||
|| The Ride of the Valkyries || 5 || This song seems to be used by SCP-4088 to frighten predators, as SCP-4088 has only been observed playing it during other SCP breaches near SCP-4088’s containment chamber. ||
|| The Barber of Seville Overture || 18 || Unknown, as SCP-4088 has only been observed playing this song while alone in its containment chamber. || 
|| In The Hall of the Mountain King || 37 || This song seems to be used by SCP-4088 to attract prey while hanging from SCP-4088-1 ||
|| Night on Bald Mountain || 24 || This appears to be another song used by SCP-4088 to lure in prey. ||
|| Piano Man || 1 || SCP-4088 has only been observed playing this song once during a test to see how long SCP-4088 would remain in its dormant state without food. After a total of 406 hours, SCP-4088 began attempting to play the song repeatedly, but about 58 seconds into the song would falter and attempt to play the song correctly from the beginning. A live sheep was then sent into SCP-4088’s containment cell. Once the containment cell was opened, SCP-4088 immediately ceased its dormant state and breached the cell using previously unobserved speed. 8 personnel were killed in the containment breach, all of whom were eaten by SCP-4088. After eating the 8th personnel, SCP-4088 fell into its normal dormant state and was relocated back into its containment cell. ||
