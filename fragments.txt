AKA: Stuff You Will Never Use, But Wanted To Share

The point of this page is simple. Everyone has pieces of stories, or articles, inside their head. Bits that you yourself may never use, but would still like to share/let someone else use. So, that's what this page is for.

------

//On an SCP that erases the memories of whatever it is told from everyone but the teller://

Subject D-42 enter the enclosure, and told the SCP 'Two plus Two is Four.' There was no reaction for approximately five minutes, at which point D-42s head exploded.

------

//On an viral SCP that causes people to have sex with random strangers://

If this gets out, we could be looking at a XXXK event!

------

A business called Tonk and Revelstoke's.

-----

Fleet of solar powered drone planes, in the upper atmosphere. All go in the same direction.

------

A "tooth fairy"  SCP that rips teeth from people's heads and uses it to fuel itself.

------

Victims of a freeze ray.  Their outer molecule in stasis and cannot be damaged in anyway.  Their innards have long since rotted away, but without anywhere for the fluids to go, they... slosh...

-----

"As long as I live, the humiliation will color my perception with the tint of his arrogance!" (Now stay out of my head!)

------

"The lion shines and its roar blinds."

------

Just a group of a bunch of normal numbers that add up to different totals when you add them in a different order.  Like, maybe twenty or so three-digit numbers.

------

A cold- or flu-like disease that spreads my memetic vectors instead of the normal transfer of microorganisms.

(videotape recording of D-class sick with the Memetic Cold) "Achoo, man this cold is kicking my butt"
(previously healthy agent) "So what the heck is this?  You wanted me to watch securidy foodage of some guy with a head code? *phlegmy cough* how did I just ged sick?"
