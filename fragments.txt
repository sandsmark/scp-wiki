title:Fragments
AKA: Stuff You Will Never Use, But Wanted To Share

The point of this page is simple. Everyone has pieces of stories, or articles, inside their head. Bits that you yourself may never use, but would still like to share/let someone else use. So, that's what this page is for.

------

Orientation Tales for the other GOIs besides the Chaos Insurgency. All kinds of ideas here. The "welcome to class" speeches of the Alexylva University. Life, after just being hired by MC&D. Serpent's Hand welcomes for new members. A CotBG baptism in watchmaker's oil introducing new members into the faith.

------

A Tale about something that causes an 0-5 to face-palm.

------

A tale about SCP-097 before the foundation found it, from the point of view of one of the children it was luring in.

------

A tale about what happens when SCP-722 awakens. Poor, poor foundation....

------

A tale as written by an ordinary child who just got a new pet SCP-1550 about his/her new pet. Bonus if it gives the SCP-1550 pet an adorable name and/or makes the foundation out as the "bad men" trying to kidnap it.

------

A tale in which Serpent's Hand operatives having broken into a foundation containment site try to convince an apparently intelligent SCP to escape with them. Pity for them that the SCP they found is robo-dude™.
Meant to be humorous, with a mix of Serpent's Hand dramatic speeches about SCP freedom and "robo-dance™."

------

//On an SCP that erases the memories of whatever it is told from everyone but the teller://

Subject D-42 enter the enclosure, and told the SCP 'Two plus Two is Four.' There was no reaction for approximately five minutes, at which point D-42s head exploded.

------

//On an viral SCP that causes people to have sex with random strangers://

If this gets out, we could be looking at a XXXK event!

------

A foundation Tale in which SCP-507 Jumps into a new reality... ...the university. Sort of an excuse plot for us to see the university world from the inside.

------

A business called Tonk and Revelstoke's.

-----

A "tooth fairy"  SCP that rips teeth from people's heads and uses it to fuel itself.

------

Victims of a freeze ray.  Their outer molecule in stasis and cannot be damaged in anyway.  Their innards have long since rotted away, but without anywhere for the fluids to go, they... slosh...

-----

"As long as I live, the humiliation will color my perception with the tint of his arrogance!" (Now stay out of my head!)

------

"The lion shines and its roar blinds."

------

Just a group of a bunch of normal numbers that add up to different totals when you add them in a different order.  Like, maybe twenty or so three-digit numbers.

------

A cold- or flu-like disease that spreads by memetic vectors instead of the normal transfer of microorganisms.

(videotape recording of D-class sick with the Memetic Cold) "Achoo, man this cold is kicking my butt"
(previously healthy agent) "So what the heck is this?  You wanted me to watch securidy foodage of some guy with a head code? *phlegmy cough* how did I just ged sick?"

------

Those ads on the sides of the screen? The ones that have fun, cute little games you can play?  They're not really there.  No one ever programmed those in. Instead, the second that you click on one of them, you're a tool of an unknown force. Every click, every attempt to get the egg in the bucket or kick the donkey... goes to something.  Fuck knows what, but it's going somewhere.

-----

A set of five disguises made out of flesh, each one corresponding to a UN ambassador on the security council: USA, France, Great Britain, Russia, Taiwan (people's republic of china).  Found mid-'90s.

-----

Terrestrial life form. Has a thin membrane filled with lighter-than-air gas saturated with natural phosphorescent chemicals. Not particularly carnivorous but have been known to lure and share small prey like young deer. 'Deflate' in the daytime. Reside in Australia. The article's aim is 'interesting/cute', not 'scary'. Yes, it's an SCPification of [*http://www.theozfiles.com/min_min_lights.html this.]

----

A containment procedure in search of a chemical SCP:

[[collapsible show="Show Procedures" hide="Hide Procedures"]]
**Special Containment Procedures:** No samples of SCP-███ may be stored at any site except under experimental conditions. All samples of SCP-███ must be synthesized //ad hoc// using procedures in Document PR-███-01 (Level-4 clearance required to access and oversee synthetic process). No individual below Level-4 clearance may know about or perform more than three steps from Document PR-███-01.

When synthesized, SCP-███ must be handled as a strong, water-soluble narcotic. Excess or unused SCP-███ must be disposed of via methods outlined in Document PR-███-13.

Samples and synthetic procedures for SCP-███ still exist around the world. Foundation policy is to seize and/or suppress all items related to each SCP-███ event, including attempts to reverse-engineer SCP-███, [DATA EXPUNGED].

----

A song that causes the listener's heart to beat in tune with the music.  Speeding/slowing the beat of the song has obvious detrimental effects.  No one can quite recall what the tune was or how the song went.

----

An SCP that rearranges parts of things into other useful things for its own use. Maybe living organisms or something.

----

An electric mixer with no batteries or power cord: it runs on music.

----

A magnifying glass works only at night, and which can do with moonlight what any magnifier can do to an ant in sunlight.

----

A lock that, when locked, would stay stuck in the same place (although still moving with the Earth's rotation, etc.).

//A humanoid SCP, with the ability to alter the world simply by speaking. However, he isn't too smart, being in his mid teens. Containment protocol and an incident log://

**Containment Procedures:** --SCP-XXX has been fitted with an electronic voice modulation unit, to prevent him from accidentally using his powers. He is allowed freedom to roam the site at will. He has been set up in a regulation humanoid containment cell, with access to whatever material he might desire to keep him entertained. SCP-XXX is currently in daily training exercises with Dr Bright in order to aide his judgment.-- Following incident XXX-63, containment procedures have been altered. SCP-XXX is installed in a regulation humanoid containment cell. It is to remain strapped to its bed, and fed intravenously. While the removal of its tongue may have been enough to remove its powers, care is to be taken to ensure its lips remain sewn together. Should subject persist in attempting to speak, removal of vocal chords will be considered.

**Log Snippet:**
//Doctor Bright and SCP-XXX aka Tommy are seated at a table, Tommy's voice modulator behind Dr. Bright. They are speaking amiably, and have been for some time.//
Bright: Tommy, you really need to get this through your head. We're not trying to hurt you. We want you to be able to work WITH your powers. You can't just speak your mind. Imagine if you had had said the 'pants on fire' thing to Agent Smith WITHOUT your modulator. It would not have been funny.
Tommy: Might have been. You don't... //He pauses, looking for a word choice.// You haven't seen that.
//Dr. Bright leans back, sighing.//
Bright: All right Tommy. That's it for today. Time to get your Modulator back on. //Dr. Bright turns away.//
Tommy: //Muttering.// You Foundation guys are literally worse than Hitler. 
//Dr. Bright stops moving. He turns slowly back towards SCP-XXX, a glint in his eye. A quick movement causes his jacket to cover the camera. Then SCP-XXX begins screaming.  This goes on for thirty minutes, the screams becoming less articulate as it goes on, until the tape cuts off.//

-----

Something that is immune to bullets and projectiles of all types. Not a shield, some sort of creature. Preferably based off some mythological critter that is, itself, immune to projectiles. Point behind this is that the containment and retrieval stuff requires close combat.

-----

Forever here this door shall sit,
A rift in reason and in rhyme;
A pox on those who would commit
A treason 'gainst the flow of time.

------

Windmills - something that grinds up stuff creepily (though that would have to work hard to be a not-repeat of other SCPs), or something that would power something the Foundation really, really doesn't want powered. Or windmill//s// - a whole field of windmills that blow in conjunction with some other world's wind? Windmills that draw things to them? 

------

A shopping cart that acts like a dog: bonds with the person who touches it, likes to "play" - run fast, go around in circles, play chase - will bump you affectionately, chase off other things/people/carts it views as a threat to bonded subject, etc.

------

//SCP with the sole gimmick of being literally uncontainable.//

------

//SCP - A contract expiry announcement from a PR company. Any non human entity (Company, country, curch, store, event) who holds it will be repeatedly subjected to more and more PR and in-entity disasters (Like losing important files, accidents destroying essential property...)//

------

//SCP contained within a Timezone.//

------

//SCP whose containment involves reading it stories of murder. Fresh ones every time. Published fiction works best.//

------

Humanoid SCP with highly aggressive immune system, able to deal with infections before they enter the body

------

Children's fairy-tale book that, when read, causes the reader to regress chronologically, to something like six or seven. Reader hears voice of an elderly woman reading aloud, illegible writing on the inside of the book cover - only readable part says "Love, Granny" or something.

------

A story somehow incorporating SCP-ARCs and SCP-Ds together to restart a universe after an X#-Class Scenario deletes it.

------

A traffic cone which, when placed on a road, cannot be moved by motor vehicles. IE: Concrete traffic cone.

------

[[[SCP-169]]] is stated to be between 2000 and 8000 km long. This is a big descrepancy, so what if there are two of them each around 3000 km long? The Tale would be a diary of a survivor who watched the news of them coming ashore, devastating southern South America, shrugging off military might, breeding, and spreading across the Earth.

------

A Foundation Tale pertaining to Project Longshot entitled, "The Longest Shot." An alternate history, or perhaps set in the near future, in which the project is completed and the spacecraft launched. In the 104 or so years it takes the craft to reach Alpha Centari and transmit data back to earth, humanity has been wiped from the face of the planet. Somewhere, a radio might crackle to life and begin blaring odd static. A monitor or two may light up at NASA mission control, even though they rightfully shouldn't, gazed upon by many eager eyes, none belonging to anything capable of comprehending the information on the LCD panels before them.

It would contrast the success of the mission with how little it meant, making subtle implications as to why humanity is gone, when the race died out, and what may have changed.

------

A basis for a story: For a group (or race, planet, person, I don't know) with advanced technology, it would be easy to make something designed to be found by scientists. Just by making an object that's inexplicable //enough//, and leaving it somewhere, one stands a good chance that it will eventually end up in the hands of researchers. Say, the Foundation.

------

A pair of MTFs who work together to remove information from either the public eye or within the Foundation when members are promoted to certain positions- the Sin Eaters, who disappear people, and the Silverfish, who disappear information.

------

An anomalous original copy of the Declaration of Independence (or possibly the Constitution) held at the Foundation's branch in the National Archives.

------

A humanoid SCP whose anomalous properties were discovered during the routine examinations when s/he was brought the the Foundation as a D-Class.

------

"You don't understand! I'm trying to help you!"

------

It is said we are born in the infinite darkness, and to it we will return.
And those that would believe these words often cower behind them, using them to excuse themselves from bringing light to this world.
But should a star not shine simply because it is a difficult task?
Simply because they too must return to the void?
What would become of this world if our brethren, the stars, stopped giving their nurturing light?
The same that comes when we stop giving off ours.

------

Commercials I hear (U.S. based):
"[http://www.scjohnson.com SCP Johnson - a family company]!"

And then I think of [http://scp-inc.wikidot.com/ Soap From Corpses] and it all goes weird.

------

An SCP thats like a toy dog bone and when a dog buries it, it grows into a tree that has more toy bones coming off of it.
And then those toy bones can grow new trees propagating the cycle.

------

SCP-963 is a interesting place to mine for tale ideas. As an example, there is one (type of) individual that should be immune to it's effects - a Jack Bright that went past the 30 day mark. So if the Foundation wants an expert watching Bright, who better then a Bright to anticipate what he's up to?  And they've (sort of) given him what he wants:  //That version can live out a normal life and finally die.//

------

An -EX SCP; the original lay person explanation about  "Many Worlds Quantum" was that every decision, every coin toss generated a new universe.  Later, it's "Undetermined until observed, when it collapses the wave and resolves". So now, instead of creating universes we're destroying them. Not sure how/why but what if, like [[[skybluesky | SCP-8900-EX]]], //something changed. Something awful.// And now we have to live with it.

------

A Foundation Tale about an exploration into SCP-962.... ....from SCP-962's point of view. Implies that SCP-962 is sapient and has some form of senses of coarse...

------

A tale about the CotBG winning by reassembling their god, but rather than it taking over the world it simply ascends to a more clockwork plane of existence taking it's followers with it. Much Foundation faceplaming results at the realization that an enemy wining just got them permanently out of the Foundation's hair.

------

A tale in which we see what keeps wild SCP-831 from taking over the world.... .....they find SCP style items of their own and try to use them wiping out their hives as a result

------

An item which can only be described in insults regarding the item.

------

A tale in which YOU are an SCP

------

A sloth that is capable of passively absorbing nutrients and calories from the surrounding environment. On any other animal, it might not be a big deal, but with a maximum speed of less than 2 km/h, it can destroy large swaths of rainforest in a matter of days.

------

A tale about the Tothbrush resembling Satan for the CotBG.

------

A SCP which was formerly a foundation Agent who got captured by one of the GOIs and exposed to //something//. The foundation only found out who their new SCP once was by DNA tests. Not a useful change, more body horror and nightmare fuel that the Agent might still be self-aware under whatever was done to them.

------

A Tale of of the empire of SCP-1000 at its height.

------

An SCP that consists of a barrel of totem-shaped penises with the shafts being in the shape of various 'baramins' of animals. When touched by a female belonging to said 'baramin', the female will become pregnant.

The offspring will live to around just after reaching sexual maturity. Their birth will cause the mother to ignore all pre-existing offspring and their death will cause the mother to undergo severe depression. Usage of the SCP renders the female infertile except for subsequent uses of the SCP.

------

A "How To Draw Anime" book, which when in contact with a picture or video that contains humans, will turn all instances of that picture or video into a stylized, 'anime' version of whatever is depicted in the picture or video.

------
A Tale featuring two GoIs interacting without any interference from the Foundation (e.g. IRG and Are We Cool Yet?).
