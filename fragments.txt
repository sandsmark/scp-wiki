title:Fragments
AKA: Stuff You Will Never Use, But Wanted To Share

The point of this page is simple. Everyone has pieces of stories, or articles, inside their head. Bits that you yourself may never use, but would still like to share/let someone else use. So, that's what this page is for.

------

//On an SCP that erases the memories of whatever it is told from everyone but the teller://

Subject D-42 enter the enclosure, and told the SCP 'Two plus Two is Four.' There was no reaction for approximately five minutes, at which point D-42s head exploded.

------

//On an viral SCP that causes people to have sex with random strangers://

If this gets out, we could be looking at a XXXK event!

------

A business called Tonk and Revelstoke's.

-----

Fleet of solar powered drone planes, in the upper atmosphere. All go in the same direction.

------

A "tooth fairy"  SCP that rips teeth from people's heads and uses it to fuel itself.

------

Victims of a freeze ray.  Their outer molecule in stasis and cannot be damaged in anyway.  Their innards have long since rotted away, but without anywhere for the fluids to go, they... slosh...

-----

"As long as I live, the humiliation will color my perception with the tint of his arrogance!" (Now stay out of my head!)

------

"The lion shines and its roar blinds."

------

Just a group of a bunch of normal numbers that add up to different totals when you add them in a different order.  Like, maybe twenty or so three-digit numbers.

------

A cold- or flu-like disease that spreads by memetic vectors instead of the normal transfer of microorganisms.

(videotape recording of D-class sick with the Memetic Cold) "Achoo, man this cold is kicking my butt"
(previously healthy agent) "So what the heck is this?  You wanted me to watch securidy foodage of some guy with a head code? *phlegmy cough* how did I just ged sick?"

------

Those ads on the sides of the screen? The ones that have fun, cute little games you can play?  They're not really there.  No one ever programmed those in. Instead, the second that you click on one of them, you're a tool of an unknown force. Every click, every attempt to get the egg in the bucket or kick the donkey... goes to something.  Fuck knows what, but it's going somewhere.

-----

A set of five disguises made out of flesh, each one corresponding to a UN ambassador on the security council: USA, France, Great Britain, Russia, Taiwan (people's republic of china).  Found mid-'90s.

-----

Terrestrial life form. Has a thin membrane filled with lighter-than-air gas saturated with natural phosphorescent chemicals. Not particularly carnivorous but have been known to lure and share small prey like young deer. 'Deflate' in the daytime. Reside in Australia. The article's aim is 'interesting/cute', not 'scary'. Yes, it's an SCPification of [*http://www.theozfiles.com/min_min_lights.html this.]

A containment procedure in search of a chemical SCP:

[[collapsible show="Show Procedures" hide="Hide Procedures"]]
**Special Containment Procedures:** No samples of SCP-███ may be stored at any site except under experimental conditions. All samples of SCP-███ must be synthesized //ad hoc// using procedures in Document PR-███-01 (Level-4 clearance required to access and oversee synthetic process). No individual below Level-4 clearance may know about or perform more than three steps from Document PR-███-01.

When synthesized, SCP-███ must be handled as a strong, water-soluble narcotic. Excess or unused SCP-███ must be disposed of via methods outlined in Document PR-███-13.

Samples and synthetic procedures for SCP-███ still exist around the world. Foundation policy is to seize and/or suppress all items related to each SCP-███ event, including attempts to reverse-engineer SCP-███, [DATA EXPUNGED].

----

A song that causes the listener's heart to beat in tune with the music.  Speeding/slowing the beat of the song has obvious detrimental effects.  No one can quite recall what the tune was or how the song went.

----

An SCP that rearranges parts of things into other useful things for its own use. Maybe living organisms or something.

----

An electric mixer with no batteries or power cord: it runs on music.

----

A magnifying glass works only at night, and which can do with moonlight what any magnifier can do to an ant in sunlight.

----

A lock that, when locked, would stay stuck in the same place (although still moving with the Earth's rotation, etc.).
