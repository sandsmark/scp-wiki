title:Fragments
AKA: Stuff You Will Never Use, But Wanted To Share



The point of this page is simple. Everyone has pieces of stories, or articles, inside their head. Bits that you yourself may never use, but would still like to share/let someone else use. So, that's what this page is for.

------
An exploration log into SCP-962.

------
The Church of the Broken God comes across SCP-962. 
Both try to worship each other as their God/s.
Hilarity Ensues. 

------
A tale in which SCP-962 starts expanding the range it sends former animal "servitors" to work in. To the point where keeping the hoards of animals contorted by mechanical implants into crude mockeries of the human form killing any other animals they comes across and helping people out sort of like the "excessively helpful" humanoids mentioned at the bottom of this page out of public knowledge is impossible.

------
The back half of a broken plastic squirt-gun. Not abnormal as far as the foundation can tell, just highly radioactive and with....

**rtainment™**
**ega-Soaker™**

....printed on it. Found following a [DATA EXPUNGED] disaster of some sort.


------
A series of tales in which the Foundation is a public multinational government entity, the public knows about the paranormal.

------
A chain letter. Very specifically written, misspelled, the grammar is horrible but believable considering some stupid chain letters people fall for. Tells the person who gets it to copy it out and send it to ten more people or a "monster" will kill them complete with very specific description of the "monster." In event of the letter not being copied, misspellings and all, a creature resembling the "monster" will show up, attack and vanish. The process in event of foundation personal getting infected would be to have them tell ten class-D personal who would then be shot.

------
Some sort of drug which has two effects.
1. Cannabis-like mental weirdness.
2. Gives the person using it temporary reality-warper powers which last as long as the "trip" does.

Inspired by posts in the chat thread for SCP-1958.

------

A species of tree which will open small dimensional "oddities" near it causing abnormal things to happen at random. A single tree can't really do anything major but a grove of them is able to "puncture" reality spreading seeds between the many worlds of the foundation universes sort of like SCP-507's power. Also makes a great defense mechanism for the tree having herbivores moved out of the same dimension as it.

------

A toy car that will act like a real one. That is to say, it will move by itself to drive along roads, stop at gas stations and generally act like a normal car apart from being a toy and not having any driver.

------

A fragment of organic tissue, apparently part of an animal. DNA tests and simple appearance shows it to be of no known species. Maybe a gigantic severed leg ending in a single claw or a weird, nonhuman skull or something.

When touched by any living animal or person the part of the animal or person which made contact with it will "stick" being peeled off their body and incorporated into the tissue fragment. DNA tests of the part peeled off the victim will reveal it is changing to match tissue from the fragment, replacing bits of it. 

Whatever creature the fragment was part of is healing.....

------

A bunch of eggs, each about a quarter-meter long. Slightly warm indicating they are alive, and made out of something which has resisted all attempts at drilling into it for study. The foundation has no idea what they will hatch into, or when they hatch. Candling and other tests have proven inconclusive.

------

A Tale in which Lord Blackwood in his present slug form meets SCP-1227. Both proceed to have a very odd conversation, as each of them perceives themselves as normal whereas they are actually a sea slug and a gigantic squicky mass of body horror.

------

A biological organism that doesn't die. Instead it expires. Literal expiration date like on food products, at which point [REDACTED]

-----

A swarm of tiny flying creatures or micro-robots which look like snowflakes. Can "swarm" people, and the edges of their wings are //sharp//.

------

Wondertainment Face-paint - will change the coloration of any biological matter it is applied to, not like tattoos but like birthmarks. Brightly colored birthmarks. Can permanently blind if it gets on eyes by turning the eyes colored. Needless to say has a "keep away from eyes" note in typical wondertainment style.

------

Creature/s living on a beach which make nests that look like sandcastles. With moats, decorative sticks, ect.

------

A heartwarming Tale involving a wedding of two of the faithful in [http://www.scp-wiki.net/system:page-tags/tag/broken-god#pages church].

//"And now two are united in marriage as His Cogwheels and Gears shall reunite when He is made whole...."//

------

A migratory herd of toy trucks.

------

A plant, probably some kind of flower. When it grows in any kind of material, it will take on traits of said material. For example if you grew it in soil, you would get a carefully shaped pile of dirt, if by sticking a seed into a computer's casing some kind of robotic plant-thing, and if by making a Class-D swallow it [DATA EXPUNGED]

------

A horrific monster with the personality of a cute and cuddly puppy. The nightmare fuel comes from both the fact that it really doesn't know it's own strength leading to loads of deaths when it tries to play with people, and how the foundation treats it.

------

**Dr. Wondertainment's Mini-Cities™:** Just plant the city-seed™, water and be ready to govern your own little city of little people!

**Adventures of Lord Blackwood, explorer and gentleslug.**

**Lord Blackwood in [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1678 | UnLondon]]]**

**Lord Blackwood at Sea:** A voyage to capture a [[[SCP-879 | whale-like monster]]] preying upon shipping. Throw in pirates, storms, a rather [[[SCP-1014 | odd castaway]]], other adventures joining the hunt, [[[SCP-1260 | and his ship itself]]]  and this may be more of a threat to His Lordship than it seems....

**Lord Blackwood and the Sky-Discs:** His Lordship takes to the skies in an airship on the hunt for a flock of [[[SCP-994 | strange flying animals]]], unlike anything ever seen before. Add in the problems of a predatory [[[SCP-312  | flying jellyfish]]] pulling people from the airship and swarms of [[[SCP-1661 | airborne robots]]] eating the airship out from under its crew make this a rather odd trip.

**Lord Blackwood on the Dark Continent:** A thrilling expedition 'cross Darkest Africa for the rarest of beasts, the [[[SCP-131 | eye-pods]]].

**Lord Blackwood and the [[[SCP-962  | Tower]]]:**

------

//"This is the task you must do..." announced the Wonderful Wizard of Wondertainment. "KILL FOR ME 682!"//

//"In return, you Pesterbot will be granted the power to carry out your threats. You, Lord Blackwood will have your humanity restored. You, Able shall be granted a heart and the power to love.//

//Any you Dr. Chef will be allowed to return home to the SCP foundation. And take your pet Dragon-Snail with you.//

------

Orientation Tales for the other GOIs besides the Chaos Insurgency. All kinds of ideas here. The "welcome to class" speeches of the Alexylva University. Life, after just being hired by MC&D. Serpent's Hand welcomes for new members. A CotBG baptism in watchmaker's oil introducing new members into the faith.

------

A Tale about something that causes an 0-5 to face-palm.

------

A tale about SCP-097 before the foundation found it, from the point of view of one of the children it was luring in.

------

A tale about what happens when SCP-722 awakens. Poor, poor foundation....

------

A tale as written by an ordinary child who just got a new pet SCP-1550 about his/her new pet. Bonus if it gives the SCP-1550 pet an adorable name and/or makes the foundation out as the "bad men" trying to kidnap it.

------

A tale in which Serpent's Hand operatives having broken into a foundation containment site try to convince an apparently intelligent SCP to escape with them. Pity for them that the SCP they found is robo-dude™.
Meant to be humorous, with a mix of Serpent's Hand dramatic speeches about SCP freedom and "robo-dance™."

------

//On an SCP that erases the memories of whatever it is told from everyone but the teller://

Subject D-42 enter the enclosure, and told the SCP 'Two plus Two is Four.' There was no reaction for approximately five minutes, at which point D-42s head exploded.

------

//On an viral SCP that causes people to have sex with random strangers://

If this gets out, we could be looking at a XXXK event!

------

A foundation Tale in which SCP-507 Jumps into a new reality... ...the university. Sort of an excuse plot for us to see the university world from the inside.

------

A business called Tonk and Revelstoke's.

-----

A "tooth fairy"  SCP that rips teeth from people's heads and uses it to fuel itself.

------

Victims of a freeze ray.  Their outer molecule in stasis and cannot be damaged in anyway.  Their innards have long since rotted away, but without anywhere for the fluids to go, they... slosh...

-----

"As long as I live, the humiliation will color my perception with the tint of his arrogance!" (Now stay out of my head!)

------

"The lion shines and its roar blinds."

------

Just a group of a bunch of normal numbers that add up to different totals when you add them in a different order.  Like, maybe twenty or so three-digit numbers.

------

A cold- or flu-like disease that spreads by memetic vectors instead of the normal transfer of microorganisms.

(videotape recording of D-class sick with the Memetic Cold) "Achoo, man this cold is kicking my butt"
(previously healthy agent) "So what the heck is this?  You wanted me to watch securidy foodage of some guy with a head code? *phlegmy cough* how did I just ged sick?"

------

Those ads on the sides of the screen? The ones that have fun, cute little games you can play?  They're not really there.  No one ever programmed those in. Instead, the second that you click on one of them, you're a tool of an unknown force. Every click, every attempt to get the egg in the bucket or kick the donkey... goes to something.  Fuck knows what, but it's going somewhere.

-----

A set of five disguises made out of flesh, each one corresponding to a UN ambassador on the security council: USA, France, Great Britain, Russia, Taiwan (people's republic of china).  Found mid-'90s.

-----

Terrestrial life form. Has a thin membrane filled with lighter-than-air gas saturated with natural phosphorescent chemicals. Not particularly carnivorous but have been known to lure and share small prey like young deer. 'Deflate' in the daytime. Reside in Australia. The article's aim is 'interesting/cute', not 'scary'. Yes, it's an SCPification of [*http://www.theozfiles.com/min_min_lights.html this.]

----

A containment procedure in search of a chemical SCP:

[[collapsible show="Show Procedures" hide="Hide Procedures"]]
**Special Containment Procedures:** No samples of SCP-███ may be stored at any site except under experimental conditions. All samples of SCP-███ must be synthesized //ad hoc// using procedures in Document PR-███-01 (Level-4 clearance required to access and oversee synthetic process). No individual below Level-4 clearance may know about or perform more than three steps from Document PR-███-01.

When synthesized, SCP-███ must be handled as a strong, water-soluble narcotic. Excess or unused SCP-███ must be disposed of via methods outlined in Document PR-███-13.

Samples and synthetic procedures for SCP-███ still exist around the world. Foundation policy is to seize and/or suppress all items related to each SCP-███ event, including attempts to reverse-engineer SCP-███, [DATA EXPUNGED].
[[/collapsible]]

----

A song that causes the listener's heart to beat in tune with the music.  Speeding/slowing the beat of the song has obvious detrimental effects.  No one can quite recall what the tune was or how the song went.

----

An SCP that rearranges parts of things into other useful things for its own use. Maybe living organisms or something.

----

An electric mixer with no batteries or power cord: it runs on music.

----

A lock that, when locked, would stay stuck in the same place (although still moving with the Earth's rotation, etc.).

//A humanoid SCP, with the ability to alter the world simply by speaking. However, he isn't too smart, being in his mid teens. Containment protocol and an incident log://

**Containment Procedures:** --SCP-XXX has been fitted with an electronic voice modulation unit, to prevent him from accidentally using his powers. He is allowed freedom to roam the site at will. He has been set up in a regulation humanoid containment cell, with access to whatever material he might desire to keep him entertained. SCP-XXX is currently in daily training exercises with Dr Bright in order to aide his judgment.-- Following incident XXX-63, containment procedures have been altered. SCP-XXX is installed in a regulation humanoid containment cell. It is to remain strapped to its bed, and fed intravenously. While the removal of its tongue may have been enough to remove its powers, care is to be taken to ensure its lips remain sewn together. Should subject persist in attempting to speak, removal of vocal chords will be considered.

**Log Snippet:**
//Doctor Bright and SCP-XXX aka Tommy are seated at a table, Tommy's voice modulator behind Dr. Bright. They are speaking amiably, and have been for some time.//
Bright: Tommy, you really need to get this through your head. We're not trying to hurt you. We want you to be able to work WITH your powers. You can't just speak your mind. Imagine if you had had said the 'pants on fire' thing to Agent Smith WITHOUT your modulator. It would not have been funny.
Tommy: Might have been. You don't... //He pauses, looking for a word choice.// You haven't seen that.
//Dr. Bright leans back, sighing.//
Bright: All right Tommy. That's it for today. Time to get your Modulator back on. //Dr. Bright turns away.//
Tommy: //Muttering.// You Foundation guys are literally worse than Hitler. 
//Dr. Bright stops moving. He turns slowly back towards SCP-XXX, a glint in his eye. A quick movement causes his jacket to cover the camera. Then SCP-XXX begins screaming.  This goes on for thirty minutes, the screams becoming less articulate as it goes on, until the tape cuts off.//

-----

Something that is immune to bullets and projectiles of all types. Not a shield, some sort of creature. Preferably based off some mythological critter that is, itself, immune to projectiles. Point behind this is that the containment and retrieval stuff requires close combat.

-----

Forever here this door shall sit,
A rift in reason and in rhyme;
A pox on those who would commit
A treason 'gainst the flow of time.

------

Windmills - something that grinds up stuff creepily (though that would have to work hard to be a not-repeat of other SCPs), or something that would power something the Foundation really, really doesn't want powered. Or windmill//s// - a whole field of windmills that blow in conjunction with some other world's wind? Windmills that draw things to them? 

------

A shopping cart that acts like a dog: bonds with the person who touches it, likes to "play" - run fast, go around in circles, play chase - will bump you affectionately, chase off other things/people/carts it views as a threat to bonded subject, etc.

------

//SCP with the sole gimmick of being literally uncontainable.//

------

//SCP - A contract expiry announcement from a PR company. Any non human entity (Company, country, curch, store, event) who holds it will be repeatedly subjected to more and more PR and in-entity disasters (Like losing important files, accidents destroying essential property...)//

------

//SCP contained within a Timezone.//

------

//SCP whose containment involves reading it stories of murder. Fresh ones every time. Published fiction works best.//

------

Humanoid SCP with highly aggressive immune system, able to deal with infections before they enter the body

------

Children's fairy-tale book that, when read, causes the reader to regress chronologically, to something like six or seven. Reader hears voice of an elderly woman reading aloud, illegible writing on the inside of the book cover - only readable part says "Love, Granny" or something.

------

A story somehow incorporating SCP-ARCs and SCP-Ds together to restart a universe after an X#-Class Scenario deletes it.

------

A traffic cone which, when placed on a road, cannot be moved by motor vehicles. IE: Concrete traffic cone.

------

[[[SCP-169]]] is stated to be between 2000 and 8000 km long. This is a big descrepancy, so what if there are two of them each around 3000 km long? The Tale would be a diary of a survivor who watched the news of them coming ashore, devastating southern South America, shrugging off military might, breeding, and spreading across the Earth.

------

A Foundation Tale pertaining to Project Longshot entitled, "The Longest Shot." An alternate history, or perhaps set in the near future, in which the project is completed and the spacecraft launched. In the 104 or so years it takes the craft to reach Alpha Centari and transmit data back to earth, humanity has been wiped from the face of the planet. Somewhere, a radio might crackle to life and begin blaring odd static. A monitor or two may light up at NASA mission control, even though they rightfully shouldn't, gazed upon by many eager eyes, none belonging to anything capable of comprehending the information on the LCD panels before them.

It would contrast the success of the mission with how little it meant, making subtle implications as to why humanity is gone, when the race died out, and what may have changed.

------

A basis for a story: For a group (or race, planet, person, I don't know) with advanced technology, it would be easy to make something designed to be found by scientists. Just by making an object that's inexplicable //enough//, and leaving it somewhere, one stands a good chance that it will eventually end up in the hands of researchers. Say, the Foundation.

------

A pair of MTFs who work together to remove information from either the public eye or within the Foundation when members are promoted to certain positions- the Sin Eaters, who disappear people, and the Silverfish, who disappear information.

------

An anomalous original copy of the Declaration of Independence (or possibly the Constitution) held at the Foundation's branch in the National Archives.

------

A humanoid SCP whose anomalous properties were discovered during the routine examinations when s/he was brought the the Foundation as a D-Class.

------

"You don't understand! I'm trying to help you!"

------

It is said we are born in the infinite darkness, and to it we will return.
And those that would believe these words often cower behind them, using them to excuse themselves from bringing light to this world.
But should a star not shine simply because it is a difficult task?
Simply because they too must return to the void?
What would become of this world if our brethren, the stars, stopped giving their nurturing light?
The same that comes when we stop giving off ours.

------

Commercials I hear (U.S. based):
"[http://www.scjohnson.com SCP Johnson - a family company]!"

And then I think of [http://scp-inc.wikidot.com/ Soap From Corpses] and it all goes weird.

------

An SCP thats like a toy dog bone and when a dog buries it, it grows into a tree that has more toy bones coming off of it.
And then those toy bones can grow new trees propagating the cycle.

------

SCP-963 is a interesting place to mine for tale ideas. As an example, there is one (type of) individual that should be immune to it's effects - a Jack Bright that went past the 30 day mark. So if the Foundation wants an expert watching Bright, who better then a Bright to anticipate what he's up to?  And they've (sort of) given him what he wants:  //That version can live out a normal life and finally die.//

------

An -EX SCP; the original lay person explanation about  "Many Worlds Quantum" was that every decision, every coin toss generated a new universe.  Later, it's "Undetermined until observed, when it collapses the wave and resolves". So now, instead of creating universes we're destroying them. Not sure how/why but what if, like [[[SCP-8900-EX]]], //something changed. Something awful.// And now we have to live with it.

------

A Foundation Tale about an exploration into SCP-962.... ....from SCP-962's point of view. Implies that SCP-962 is sapient and has some form of senses of coarse...

------

A tale about the CotBG winning by reassembling their god, but rather than it taking over the world it simply ascends to a more clockwork plane of existence taking it's followers with it. Much Foundation faceplaming results at the realization that an enemy wining just got them permanently out of the Foundation's hair.

------

A tale in which we see what keeps wild SCP-831 from taking over the world.... .....they find SCP style items of their own and try to use them wiping out their hives as a result

------

An item which can only be described in insults regarding the item.

------

A tale in which YOU are an SCP

------

A sloth that is capable of passively absorbing nutrients and calories from the surrounding environment. On any other animal, it might not be a big deal, but with a maximum speed of less than 2 km/h, it can destroy large swaths of rainforest in a matter of days.

------

A tale about the Tothbrush resembling Satan for the CotBG.

------

A SCP which was formerly a foundation Agent who got captured by one of the GOIs and exposed to //something//. The foundation only found out who their new SCP once was by DNA tests. Not a useful change, more body horror and nightmare fuel that the Agent might still be self-aware under whatever was done to them.

------

A Tale of of the empire of SCP-1000 at its height.

------

An SCP that consists of a barrel of totem-shaped penises with the shafts being in the shape of various 'baramins' of animals. When touched by a female belonging to said 'baramin', the female will become pregnant.

The offspring will live to around just after reaching sexual maturity. Their birth will cause the mother to ignore all pre-existing offspring and their death will cause the mother to undergo severe depression. Usage of the SCP renders the female infertile except for subsequent uses of the SCP.

------

A "How To Draw Anime" book, which when in contact with a picture or video that contains humans, will turn all instances of that picture or video into a stylized, 'anime' version of whatever is depicted in the picture or video.

------
A Tale featuring two GoIs interacting without any interference from the Foundation (e.g. IRG and Are We Cool Yet?).

------

"Have you ever had one of those moments you just wished you could be a fly on the wall?
Wish granted.
Are We Cool Yet?"

------

An anomalous crime scenario involving a mass murder situation that always leaves only two suspects/witnesses remaining after the event with some sort of connection or relation that could make them accomplices. One or both of the suspects will either claim responsibility for the murders themselves or blame the other suspect, and will give an account of the crime that supports their claim, while the other will assert said account cannot be true, giving their own account of the event that conflicts with or contradicts the first. In any case, evidence recovered at the crime scene will be compatible with both accounts, but may be insufficient to give a clear picture of what happened. If the crime is not correctly "solved", i.e. authorities figured out exactly what happened during the event (who was responsible for which death, which details of either story are true, whose idea was it, etc.), within a certain amount of time, both suspects will self-terminate in a manner consistent between incidents, usually with a murder tactic or implement they or the other supposedly used during the crime, and the event will repeat itself some time later. 

Each instance of the crime will have some elements that denote it as an instance of the SCP, i.e. implements used or manner of death of at least one victim, but will otherwise create an entirely new scenario so study of previous instances does not provide any clues to subsequent ones. 

Not exactly sure how this would be contained, or even if it is contained, what makes it spread, how it would recognize having been "solved", how the Foundation finds out it needs to be solved, etc.

------

A small-scale replica/floor plan of [your choice of city here] made of dominoes. Formations collapse of their own accord when corresponding buildings in the real city are damaged or destroyed, and vice versa. Might possibly be connected to AWCY.

------

An anomalous Halloween decoration that either turns people into black cats or produces black cats with human intelligence at regular intervals.

------

SCP-J idea: "The [EXPLETIVE] You Button!^^tm^^" An "easy button"-esque device that, when pressed, emits the aforementioned phrase (sans censorship) and injures the person that pushed it, usually via a random object thrown from an indeterminate origin point.

------

A God that disguises itself in the costume of a fake God because it enjoys messing around with mortals.

------
A Project crossover Tale teaming up and/or pitting against each other axe cop and smokey
//RUNFUCKERRUNFUCKERRUNFUCKERRUNFUCKER//
**I'LL CHOP YOUR HEAD OFF**
with a possible twist reveal that it was a team-up of malachai and reasercher James with their next project being dinosaur soldier and the butt ghost teaming up.

------
A tale involving Eric playing with wondertainment products.
------

A tale consisting of entries in a diary the Foundation recovered from the home of a child who had heard or read a description of [[[SCP-1128]]]. Parents probably would think he was just overreacting from reading/hearing too many scary stories until it was too late, or maybe parents began showing symptoms of infection as well.

------
A scp involving the concept of ceremorphosis where an organism either hatches from a skull like an egg or eats the brain and mutates the body as part of its life cycle like a mind flayer or head crab.

------

A crashed vessel recovered from the crater in mexico.

------

a tale from the view of the broken god where his hands are 914 his heart is 882 his love is 217 and his mind created to learn new ways to proclaim his coming shattered and fallen graped onto the nearest thing he could find. a little sculpture of a robot.

------

A chick tract parody for the cotbg

------

SCP idea: A mummified corpse resembling a deformed human recovered from an MC&D auction. Included with it were several "tags" bearing writing in an ancient Chinese script. Corpse becomes animate when one or more of these tags is applied to the body, with each tag causing it to exhibit different behaviors, e.g. "serve", "attack", "guard", etc. Based somewhat on popular depictions of the Jiang-shi, a Chinese zombie-like creature.

------

A Project crossover Tale in which the foundation deploys Mobile Task Force Omega-Seven back when it had Able in it, in an attempt to contain a small town in which a bunch of animals had been turning up drained of blood.

A small town called Forks....

Also referred to as:

**Able and Dr. Clef working together to kick sparkly butt!**

------

A tale in which the leader of the Serpent's Hand (or a faction thereof) reaches out to a college student and has said student found AWCY? as a counterpart to the Serpent's Hand.

------

An SCP object made by AWCY... but what catches the Foundation's interest isn't the object itself so much as the vandalism done to it in response. Said vandalism is clearly done by someone other than AWCY, yet it seems to be creating its own anomalous effects which appear to be a mockery of/a response to/interfering with the intent of the original object. Over the "Are We Cool Yet?" logo would be graffiti reading something along the lines of "YES, UR F@(KING C00L NAO! 3NUF OF TH15 BU11$H17!" ("leetspeak" obfuscation not necessary)

------

A product/drug (possibly smoked) developed by MC&D-employed scientists. Modeled after something made and used by the Fifth Church that they stole that they heard about from a converted club member.

------

Someone or something that makes people do musical numbers. I don't mean like that -J curtain that made people do showtunes, I mean something that causes mass quantities of people to break out in choreographed song-and-dance routines, disregarding their safety or present situation.

------

Brain worms that lay eggs which look exactly like Q-tips. An unsuspecting victim decides to start cleaning his ears and suddenly realizes that what he was using disappeared from his hand. Months later, their barely breathing body trudges through drugstores, pulling pristine Q-tips out of its nose and inserting them into the appropriate packaging. Depending on the angle, could be either a real article or a -J.

Lord Blackwood meets Sherlock Holmes, with Mr.Deeds meeting Watson

------

A Tale involving the creation of a portal to the Library by placing SCP-1326 into SCP-826.

------

A humanoid SCP whose containment procedures require it to be inebriated at all times.

------
The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toynbee_tiles Toynbee Tiles] turning out to be an SCP; due to the relatively widespread knowledge of them and their public appearances, containment would focus on suppressing knowledge of it's anomalous effects.

------

A tale or series of tales about how someone finds out about the Foundation through independent investigation...if that's even feasible.

------

Due to a shortage of Amnesiacs of all classes (not just Class A) following a raid on a production plant by a GoI (CI, IRG, Serpents Hand, or GOC), The Foundation is forced to ration amnesiacs until further notice, leading to several suicides and deaths thanks to things that cannot be unseen or memes getting out of control.

------

A tour of a Wondertainment factory a la Roald Dahl.

------

A tale where [[[SCP-1440]]] and [[[SCP-920]]] run into each other and have a conversation about their respective situations.

(Damnit - I had ones for Bright and Kain...)

------

An SCP comprised of a large quantity of "excessively helpful" humanoid beings that follow a "target" around and provide him or her with courteous assistance in anything they attempt to do. And they are //everywhere//. Approaching a door? They open it for you from the other side. Shoe untied? One's already on it. Hungry? One of them already made you dinner somehow //while hiding inside your fridge//. Out of toilet paper? One comes out of the medicine cabinet with a fresh roll. They'll do anything for you to the best of their ability whether you want them to or not, and they don't take "no" for an answer.
