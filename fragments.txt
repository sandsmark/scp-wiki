AKA: Stuff You Will Never Use, But Wanted To Share

The point of this page is simple. Everyone has pieces of stories, or articles, inside their head. Bits that you yourself may never use, but would still like to share/let someone else use. So, that's what this page is for.

[[tab Concepts]]

[[collapsible show="Sapient SCP-1585"]]
A Tale in which SCP-1585 is sapient. Not the rapidly evolving ecosystem on it, the jellyfish itself. And is trying to make it's ecosystem into a death world with the intent of breeding a species of supersoldiers with a warrior race mentality.

SCP-1585 is a single organism, and it wants to reproduce. In layman's terms, it wants to conquer the universe.
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="SCP-967 Junkpeople"]]
The sixth tribe in SCP-967, a foundation analog. They work to keep the major junkmonsters and anomalies from wiping out the other tribes, and contain the knowledge of the abnormal by removing the memory-holding tape decks of junkcitizens who find out stuff. Like the outside world, which from their view is sort of a hellish alternate universe which kills anyone who enters it, and is inhabited by monsters unlike anything native to 967. They might not even be made of trash!

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="Serpent's HandLevitating the Pentagon"]]
A tale for the Broken Masquerade canon where the Serpent's Hand tries to levitate the US Pentagon like they tried to do in the 1960s- and succeeds. Bonus points if you include these phrases:

"The Serpent's Hand will return the color blue to the visual spectrum once our demands are met!"

"It's over, it's over, the Charade/Masquerade is broken. It's over. It's over. The Serpent's Hand has spoken."
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="Object Class: Toroidal"]]
Try to write a SCP that contains itself
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="Belleverse: Sky Gods"]]
A bellerverse Tale about a bunch of people who tend to SCP-1514-1A as a holy relic of their sky-god and in return anything that attacks them gets smote via xasers from orbit.
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="TK Signals"]]
An SCP that is a pair of telepathic "signals" that randomly attach themselves to people and do two things: the first signal tells everyone within a certain radius to acknowledge the person affected by the signal in some way, and the second one transmits all sorts of information about the subject. (Name, age, address, pet's names, whether or not they've been affected by Chron's disease, the number of living skin cells on their body, length of toenails, what movies they've seen in the past 24 hours, other useless statistics). Originally developed by someone or something as a medical first-alert system, but.. it didn't work out as planned.
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="Automatons"]]
A hoard of tiny, clockwork-looking, automated pieces of construction equipment. If left alone, they will create large buildings out of whatever, easy-to-transport local materials there are. Just lots of stone, or sand, or random junk quarried and placed into huge, ornate cathedral structures, which as far as the foundation can tell, have no abnormal properties. The buildings frequently have problems like lacking any way for the building machines inside to get out, or falling over due to being made entirely of rubbish. The builders are apparently capable of self-replicating as their population remains steady despite the foundation sometimes dissecting a few, or construction accidents, but nobody has seen them do so, or has any idea how they do it.

The SCP where recovered by a deep-sea submarine mission after radar showed an absolutely huge building they had created. Considering how slow they generally are, the foundation calculated it would have taken them ████ years to have completed it to the scale observed.

[[/collapsible]]
[[collapsible show="Bone Crystals"]]
A parasitic, body-horror inducing SCP which causes bones to split, branch out, and start growing into sort of a "bone fractal" structure. I'm not sure of a good twist for it, I just had a nightmare regarding such a thing.
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="Hair Weavers"]]
Have you ever noticed that the clump of hair that comes off when you use a comb looks sort of like a big, hairy spider? Well, sometimes it is. And it's one of the really poisonous ones. You might want to start burning your stray hairs, so they can't breed.

(See also the spiders that form when you remove the navel from an orange.)
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="Skeleton Club"]]
A nightclub (or similar social gathering place) staffed (and frequented by) friendly animate skeletons. Humans entering this place are met with warm welcomes and friendly greetings, accompanied by polite requests to "check your skin at the door". Subjects who do not immediately flee the place will discover they are in fact able to shed their skin and organs in a similar manner to a heavy overcoat, while still retaining all their former senses and mobility. Interviewed subjects usually describe it as feeling "liberating" or other such terms indicating that this absence of flesh is somewhat pleasant, akin to removing restricting clothes. Subjects also report feeling more "open"- both literally and metaphorically- and often find it easier to speak freely about themselves or their thoughts amongst other skeletal subjects. While there does not appear to be any compulsion from the grounds itself or its staff forcing goers to remain in the club until it closes, many of them do unless serious obligations (job, family etc.) would require otherwise, though some exceptions to this rule exist (usually where the subject is seriously displeased with said obligation, e.g. dead-end job or unfaithful spouse). In any case, subjects desiring to leave are prevented from doing so without first putting back on their skin and organs, which analysis suggests does not dry out or decay while in storage. Donning a skin is done just as easily as removing it was (seals around its corresponding bones only when applied properly) and does not appear to damage the skin in any way (though direct damage to a vital organ still affects its wearer when they attempt to put it back on). Skeletal subjects that manage to leave the grounds skinless immediately perish- even their skin hanging up in storage ceases to function once its "owner" collapses outside the club grounds.
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="Document"]]
A file that was kind of obviously written up by the foundation as propaganda against a particular group of interest. -Shrek
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="Bigfoot IN SPACE!"]]
[http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2008/1305.html This is an analysis of picture of a tiny rock on mars that has the shape of a bigfoot]. Now, the image itself might have a lot of evidences against it, but it does raise some interesting ideas. What if [[[SCP-1000]]] had managed to develop a space program and sent some bigfoot astronauts into space? There are quite a lot of possibilities with this one. Here are some ideas I came up:

* How will they react to having their homes taken away from them? For thousands of years?
* Do they have space bigfoot colonies? How do they hide them?
* How do their bio-ships work?
* What is the space-bigfoot's relationship with humans?

Et cetera.
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="Small Girl Who Wants Hugs"]]
A 10-year-old girl whose touch causes random mutations, 75% of which are fatal. She has a three-headed puppy named Muffles. All the rest of her family is dead.
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="Macuahuitl Mouth"]]
An individual who sought out the Foundation's help, as whenever this person eats their teeth fall out and are replaced by sharper teeth. At first it was only when they ate hard food, then any solid food, then any food at all. Their teeth are now as sharp as obsidian, and only intravenous feeding prevents the anomaly.
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="Mirror Hallways"]]
You know how when you put a mirror up to a mirror you see that creepy endless hallway? What if there were two mirror that, when you held them up to each other, there were things //wandering through// that hallway, and other hallways connected to it?
Or maybe there's just one creature, but every time you form the hallway it's //closer// . . .
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="Conflicted Circus Magician"]]

Circus all have magicians. Stage magicians that create illusions to make the audience experience seemingly impossible things.

But what about Herman Fuller's circus?

If you are a magician in a paranormal world, how will you work when everyone around you is doing impossible things?

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="Small-Town Office"]]

The Foundation listens to conspiracy radios, hears folk tales, investigates urban legends, and digs deep into internet myths in case they stumble upon an anomaly.

Imagine that you are the person responsible for it, and you have a small Foundation-established "paranormal detective agency" in the weird part of the city. Unaffected by the politics of GOIs and the world-ending anomalies, what will you see and hear in this small anomalous world?

//Any you Dr. Clef will be allowed to return home to the SCP foundation. And take your pet Dragon-Snail with you."//

------

I know. You've been so careful. 

You knew I was destined to kill you, and your death would involved poison. That translation of //Les Propheties// DID leave it up to interpretation, though. I've always suspected they're written that way deliberately; so either you can't subvert them or so when you try to match them to the event everyone says "Why it's obvious! The oracle knew the truth! We've just been too simple to understand it!"

No, dear fellow - you didn't get the //entire// translation. I managed to keep the part where the guilty go free and the innocent are punished. Yes, I'm afraid your poor nurse or doctor or whatever will be blamed for this and I'll be exonerated.

How? Oh, it's the cufflinks. They cure all poisons around them. Carved from the horn of a unicorn or some such. They're curing you of the poisons those pesky medical people have been giving you. In fact, when they gut you like a frog in your necropsy it will look like you haven't taken them in quite some time. Oh, wait - you didn't know that some poisons are called "medicine" and keep people alive!

Neither did the cufflinks...

[[tab Containment Procedures]]
[[collapsible show="Chemical SCP"]]
**Special Containment Procedures:** No samples of SCP-███ may be stored at any site except under experimental conditions. All samples of SCP-███ must be synthesized ad hoc using procedures in Document PR-███-01 (Level-4 clearance required to access and oversee synthetic process). No individual below Level-4 clearance may know about or perform more than three steps from Document PR-███-01.

When synthesized, SCP-███ must be handled as a strong, water-soluble narcotic. Excess or unused SCP-███ must be disposed of via methods outlined in Document PR-███-13.

Samples and synthetic procedures for SCP-███ still exist around the world. Foundation policy is to seize and/or suppress all items related to each SCP-███ event, including attempts to reverse-engineer SCP-███, [DATA EXPUNGED].

A creature consisting of basically a brain, a bunch of tentacles some of which have boney "scalpels" on them, spider-like spinnerets, an amazingly powerful immune system and external blood vessels. It works by stealing parts from prey, using the clawed tentacles to remove organs from prey, the spinnerets to stitch the parts Frankenstein-like onto itself, and the immune system to keep itself from falling apart. It lacks any sort of digestive or respiratory systems unless it steals them from another creature and links itself into the bloodstream of the stolen organs. It is highly hostile and frequently attempts to escape and/or assimilate people.

Who's to say that SCP-1585 has no effect on humans? Might be a good idea to make having a vasectomy mandatory for foundation personal on it.

A tale about the secret method by which the foundation gets Class-D personal.

Craigslist adds. 

Someone on craigslist probably has a statue-watching/cleaning blood/dung mixture fetish. That solves 173 for example.

Needless to say, intended as a parody/crackfic.

A hoard of tiny, clockwork-looking, automated [http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/from-the-desk-of-archivist-jensen/Steam-shovel.jpg pieces] [http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/from-the-desk-of-archivist-jensen/Bulldozer.jpg of] [http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/from-the-desk-of-archivist-jensen/Foreman.jpg construction] [http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/from-the-desk-of-archivist-jensen/Forklift.jpg equipment].

(I don't know what I was on when I wrote this. I'm thinking it could be incorporated into some kind of AWCY Dada rap or something.)
----
An SCP based on the concept "Loose Lips Sink Ships". Talking about a ship being sunk by the SCP will result in more ships sinking.
----
A device consisting of a large cage, a bunch of electronics which the foundation has absolutely no idea what's going on with, a dial, a switch and an electrical socket suitable for charging batteries. If a living animal or class-d is put in the cage, the dial will move to show an amount of voltage, apparently random, and if the switch is pulled, than the socket will proceed to charge any batteries placed in it with that amount of electricity. After being used once, the animal or class-d will, if placed back in the device never cause the dial to move again.

The twist is, it's harmless as far as the foundation can tell. The only effect of being drained is that you can't make the device create more electricity.

The foundation is tearing its hair out trying to find what the device is getting energy from.
----
A historic Wondertainment toy. Maybe a corn-husk doll, or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoop_rolling hoop rolling] game equipment. Not sure what the abnormal trait should be, I just think we need some Wondertainment stuff predating mass manufacturing.
----
A tiny, partially biological spaceprobe sort of like the plans for a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starwisp starwisp] of non-human creation. Apart from the biotechnological parts being impossible with present human technology, it seems to work off known scientific ideas for how a starship could be built. The damage to it seems to have been inflicted by a meteorite impact "stunning" it, then it drifting for a few million years off its intended course ending with it crashing into earth.

Inside, it has a bunch of chambers and equipment intended to work for genetic engineering and growth of living organic tissue, both for self-repair and expansion of biological parts and for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo_space_colonization the growth] of "SCP-xxxx-2" specimens. SCP-xxxx-2 specimens consist of simple "meat robots" creatures which lack digestive/reproductive/respiratory systems instead running off stored fat and oxygen, intended simply to gather biomatter, which then is then stuffed into a "stomach" aboard the main ship for "digestion" and metal which is [DATA EXPUNGED] since recovery the ship has expanded by █ meters.

Presumably the reader would think, this is so it can build up enough biological tissue and machine parts to build a specimen of whatever created it.... [[collapsible show=".....but really....." hide="Close"]] it is simply healing the meteorite damage, and fermenting the biomatter for methane, as rocket fuel. The expansions aren't armor, they consist of new rockets to get the "probe/creature" back into space. And the foundation is keeping it trapped on earth.

The goal would be a bit of a [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash Mood Whiplash] between thinking of it as a sort of sci-fi alien weapon, and feeling sorry for the poor [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochicken astrochicken] the foundation has been in essence torturing by keeping its wounds from healing.[[/collapsible]]

Von Neumann Golems. In essence, each specimen is an animated sculpture with an [EXPUNGED] displaying some resemblance to Hebrew writing symbol under the carapace of the forehead. Assembly consists of chewing up materials, either the hollow "gut" produces sticky mucus-like material or heats up to melt metal, regurgitating the resulting cement-like substance, shaping it into a new specimen then using [DATA EXPUNGED] extends from the lower jaw to carve the symbol into the forehead of their offspring. The offspring animates, pushes a layer of semi-hardened material over its forehead to seal it, then waits to harden/dry/cool. This idea was one I had in regards to alterations to an existing SCP, I'll take it down from here if the author chooses to use it. Also, a few pictures which could probably make good images for this.

A Tale in which SCP-106 is proven to be Mister Scary™ from Dr. Wondertainment's Little Misters™. Seems like it could be proven. If true, than "Mr. Scary, from Little Misters ® by Dr. Wondertainment" should be tattooed on SCP-106's left calf. Checking could be difficult however.

Also, SCP-076 could be Mr. Mad.

[[collapsible show="Blackwood Tale idea" hide="Close"]]
[http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-593061/worst-possible-plot-twist Idea crossposted from here.]
After the events of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/when-one-reaches-the-end this Tale], Lord Blackwood hits his [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon Despair Event Horizon] and makes a deal with [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-738 SCP-738] which he encountered on one of his travels. The terms of the deal.

**[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-738 SCP-738]**
• The creation of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1678 an "end-of-the-world" shelter based on British culture.]
• //Not// taking Lord Blackwood's soul.
• Not killing Lord Blackwood.

**Blackwood**
• Lord Blackwood's body, sort of like what happened [http://www.scp-wiki.net/caveat-emptor here].

Upon the deal being made, [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-738 SCP-738] creates [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1678 SCP-1678], takes Lord Blackwood's soul out, placing it in a sea slug his lordship had as a zoological specimen from his travels, and takes over Lord Blackwood's body, [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-106 altering it] based on [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-738 SCP-738]'s own warped sense of improvement, and proceeds to go on a rampage killing everyone besides Lord Blackwood within Blackwood manor, I.E. Lord Blackwood's entire family before the foundation of the time was able to catch it.

As now Lord Blackwood is still in his [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon Despair Event Horizon] after [http://www.scp-wiki.net/when-one-reaches-the-end this], just ended up having his entire family murdered, arguably his fault and is now [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream trapped, theoretically forever in the body of a sea slug] he is finally driven insane, retreating into his memories of still being a human adventure while ignoring the real world sort of like what happened with [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1227 SCP-1227].[[/collapsible]]

----
The [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1483 IIPES] report on their end of the dimensional gate and the primary SCP foundation world. 
----
A swarm of tiny Von Neumann machine [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochicken astrochicken-type] spacecrafts. Basically intended to land, set up a small factory and get to work on an industrial plant for creating more "ships." Not human-made, found after meteorite shower or something. Not very fast at replicating, little risk of their grey-gooing the planet. Mostly rely on the fast that //something// had to have made the first ones for creepiness.
----
A "living" snowstorm. That is to say; a small, unending snowstorm with the characteristic that any snowmen/snow sculptures at least partiality made from snow it produced will animate and endeavor to self-replicate. They appear to share a hivemind with the snowstorm cloud as the "queen." Highly hostile to foundation agents and citizens, not very effectively as they're snowmen. Presumably would have been found in the arctic or antarctic as otherwise it would melt each season.
----
Dr. Wondertainment's attempt at a toy spaceship. Looks like a stereotypical pulp science-fiction rocket, about ten feet tall and with a hollow cabin which can be closed with an airtight door. Inside has a child-sized chair and simple, video-game-style joystick controls for moving in three dimensions and acceleration. There is no fuel supply, apparent place to put fuel or need for fuel. Unforgettably for any would-be astronaut, Wondertainment has shown his/her/its normal disregard for safety, the rocket can at maximum acceleration turn its pilot into gory slime on the floor of its cabin, and while its cabin seems to be radiation-proof and somehow maintain a self-renewing supply of air there's no room for food supplies, no bathroom, and steering the thing in space to the extent of getting home alive is exactly as hard as you'd expect.

The foundation got it after it crash landed in ███████ carrying an unidentified child's corpse, starved to death or crushed by acceleration.
----
A Tale regarding a class-XK event triggered by someone asking SCP-662 to build a superior version of itself, then ask the superior version to build a superior version of //itself//, ect.

Cue a SCP-based Singularity.
----
Some kind of creature which has an instinctive ability to control and/or build complex mechanical stuff. For example, it might be sort of squidlike in form and basically mummify the dashboard, steering wheel and pedals of a car in tentacles to allow it to operate it. Clearly not naturally evolved. Not intelligent apart from its technical skills, for example a den it could make would have gas heating and automated sentry guns but it can't communicate or recognize itself in a mirror.
----
A radio which picks up signals from its equivalent location in different parallel realities depending on how the tuning is set.
----
A Tale in which foundation researchers in the world reached by SCP-1483 find the Factory or Wondertainment products, sold openly and the resulting issues. Ends with the foundation having to pay SCP-1483-world police bail to get their researchers out of jail, for robbing a small business in an attempt at "containment." Much O-5 facepalming ensues.
----
A horrific body-horror inducing plague which forces its victims into homicidal rampages against the uninfected. The twist, it doesn't affect humans. Rather, just some randomly selected by the author species of small animal. Think 610, only for squirrels for an example.
----
Werewolves as an SCP. Before you shoot me, these are not your typical werewolves. Firstly, this particular type of lycanthropy is a genetic condition that is only carried by females; the presence of a Y chromosome, for some reason, makes it inactive. Secondly, they do not change with the lunar cycle, but with their menstrual cycle, and gradually change from 100% human to 100% lupine over the course of the cycle. Thirdly, they never stop undergoing oogenesis (the act of creating eggs, which is supposed to stop at birth), meaning they never run out of eggs and therefore never go through menopause. They're also fatally allergic to silver, and can more easily be killed with it, but anything fatal to a human will kill them just as easily.
----
In SCP-111 there's this quote.
> By reading this document and incubating your Dragon-Snail™ eggs, you agree to all said terms and forfeit your rights to lawsuits, organized boycotts, protests, **honor duels**, etc.
This means, at least once //someone challenged Dr. Wondertainment to an honor duel over Dragon-Snails burning their house down. And considering the need for a note, apparently won//.

That needs to be a Tale.
----
A first-person-shooter videogame set in the middle of a few kilometer area in Alaska, at least ██ kilometers from civilization. Seems unfinished, the copy the foundation has lacks enemies, most of the sounds are defaults, ect. When turned on, in the part of Alaska where the game is set, a creature resembling the player character will appear. Said creature can be moved by the game controls, and on the game screen the player can see things as they actually are in the real word, although with graphics and health bars like the game. Attempting to move the player character to the edge of the game world will have it vanish and return to spawn point, the same happens when the foundation tries to take the creature out of the equivalent of the game world. Trying to harm the creature just leads to decreasing health for the player character, and a "you died - re-spawn?" message and the body vanishing making dissection and other such studies impossible.
----
A set of three chemicals developed by a failed project at Prometheus Labs. Chemical A grants superhuman strength, Chemical B grants telepathy and superhuman senses, and chemical C grants flight and superhuman speed. What's so bad about that? For one thing, once the chemicals enter your blood stream, they cannot be turned "off"; you'll always be super humanly strong and have to hear people's thoughts, for example. Secondly, real world physics apply; go too fast and your organs get liquefied, or you just catch on fire. Go too high up in the atmosphere with flight and you freeze to death, or run out of oxygen and fall to your doom. Shake someone's hand too hard with super strength, [DATA EXPUNGED]. The point here is to deconstruct superpowers, and why they would suck in the real world.

A DIY style computer including a human brain as the CPU as well as vital organs for life support. As a result has massive memory storage, effective functions. Does not appear to still be sapient. DNA of brain and organs matches matches ████████ supposedly kidnapped in █████. Apart from being very fast and having a lot of memory storage doesn't really show many abnormal traits for a computer in terms of software. Just a good-working homemade computer which happens to be made out of a kidnapped victim.
----
Some sort of monster made of high-tech equipment. Maybe sort of a robotic thing which assimilates any other form of electronics it gets its grippers on. In an attempt at stopping it from growing, containment procedures would basically consist of guards armed with longbows, and a few sticks of TNT as an emergency site self-destruct.
----
A project-crossover Tale. Star Trek is rife with missed opportunities and blindness regarding the application of the technology available. There usually end up being more rationalizations and justifications as to why something doesn't do something useful than techo-babble about how it works in the first place. The original series had an episode involving a plant that could cure any disease, and regrow severed limbs for an example. The plant was conveniently forgotten in all future episodes.

It's almost like some organization is still around, amnesiac-ing people who find it then locking the anomalous stuff up.....
----
Santa. Not as a -J but as an all-powerful reality bender just sitting around in the arctic, unable to be sneaked up on or captured. Not only that, but he knows what the foundation is, and he knows about the relatively harmless humanoids that hate being here. He knows about 110-Montauk. Guess who's on the naughty list?
----
A tale in which SCP-962 starts expanding the range it sends former animal "servitors" to work in. To the point where keeping the hoards of animals contorted by mechanical implants into crude mockeries of the human form killing any other animals they comes across and helping people out sort of like the "excessively helpful" humanoids mentioned at the bottom of this page out of public knowledge is impossible.
----
The back half of a broken plastic squirt-gun. Not abnormal as far as the foundation can tell, just highly radioactive and with....

----
A chain letter. Very specifically written, misspelled, the grammar is horrible but believable considering some stupid chain letters people fall for. Tells the person who gets it to copy it out and send it to ten more people or a "monster" will kill them complete with very specific description of the "monster." In event of the letter not being copied, misspellings and all, a creature resembling the "monster" will show up, attack and vanish. The process in event of foundation personal getting infected would be to have them tell ten class-D personal who would then be shot.
----
Some sort of drug which has two effects.
1. Cannabis-like mental weirdness.
2. Gives the person using it temporary reality-warper powers which last as long as the "trip" does.

Inspired by posts in the chat thread for SCP-1958.
----
A species of tree which will open small dimensional "oddities" near it causing abnormal things to happen at random. A single tree can't really do anything major but a grove of them is able to "puncture" reality spreading seeds between the many worlds of the foundation universes sort of like SCP-507's power. Also makes a great defense mechanism for the tree having herbivores moved out of the same dimension as it.

A toy car that will act like a real one. That is to say, it will move by itself to drive along roads, stop at gas stations and generally act like a normal car apart from being a toy and not having any driver.

A fragment of organic tissue, apparently part of an animal. DNA tests and simple appearance shows it to be of no known species. Maybe a gigantic severed leg ending in a single claw or a weird, nonhuman skull or something.

When touched by any living animal or person the part of the animal or person which made contact with it will "stick" being peeled off their body and incorporated into the tissue fragment. DNA tests of the part peeled off the victim will reveal it is changing to match tissue from the fragment, replacing bits of it. 

Whatever creature the fragment was part of is healing.....
----
A bunch of eggs, each about a quarter-meter long. Slightly warm indicating they are alive, and made out of something which has resisted all attempts at drilling into it for study.

A Dyson sphere found by non-foundation scientists who where later given amnesiacs. No radio signals coming from it or anything, just the whole fact that //something// out there exists. And is advanced enough to build a Dyson sphere.

//A humanoid SCP, with the ability to alter the world simply by speaking. However, he isn't too smart, being in his mid teens. Containment protocol and an incident log://

**Containment Procedures:** --SCP-XXX has been fitted with an electronic voice modulation unit, to prevent him from accidentally using his powers. He is allowed freedom to roam the site at will. He has been set up in a regulation humanoid containment cell, with access to whatever material he might desire to keep him entertained. SCP-XXX is currently in daily training exercises with Dr Bright in order to aide his judgment.-- Following incident XXX-63, containment procedures have been altered. SCP-XXX is installed in a regulation humanoid containment cell. It is to remain strapped to its bed, and fed intravenously. While the removal of its tongue may have been enough to remove its powers, care is to be taken to ensure its lips remain sewn together. Should subject persist in attempting to speak, removal of vocal chords will be considered.

**Log Snippet:**
//Doctor Bright and SCP-XXX aka Tommy are seated at a table, Tommy's voice modulator behind Dr. Bright. They are speaking amiably, and have been for some time.//
Bright: Tommy, you really need to get this through your head. We're not trying to hurt you. We want you to be able to work WITH your powers. You can't just speak your mind. Imagine if you had had said the 'pants on fire' thing to Agent Smith WITHOUT your modulator. It would not have been funny.
Tommy: Might have been. You don't... //He pauses, looking for a word choice.// You haven't seen that.
//Dr. Bright leans back, sighing.//
Bright: All right Tommy. That's it for today. Time to get your Modulator back on. //Dr. Bright turns away.//
Tommy: //Muttering.// You Foundation guys are literally worse than Hitler. 
//Dr. Bright stops moving. He turns slowly back towards SCP-XXX, a glint in his eye. A quick movement causes his jacket to cover the camera. Then SCP-XXX begins screaming.  This goes on for thirty minutes, the screams becoming less articulate as it goes on, until the tape cuts off.//

A Foundation Tale pertaining to Project Longshot entitled, "The Longest Shot." An alternate history, or perhaps set in the near future, in which the project is completed and the spacecraft launched. In the 104 or so years it takes the craft to reach Alpha Centari and transmit data back to earth, humanity has been wiped from the face of the planet. Somewhere, a radio might crackle to life and begin blaring odd static. A monitor or two may light up at NASA mission control, even though they rightfully shouldn't, gazed upon by many eager eyes, none belonging to anything capable of comprehending the information on the LCD panels before them.

It would contrast the success of the mission with how little it meant, making subtle implications as to why humanity is gone, when the race died out, and what may have changed.
----
A basis for a story: For a group (or race, planet, person, I don't know) with advanced technology, it would be easy to make something designed to be found by scientists. Just by making an object that's inexplicable //enough//, and leaving it somewhere, one stands a good chance that it will eventually end up in the hands of researchers. Say, the Foundation.

And those that would believe these words often cower behind them, using them to excuse themselves from bringing light to this world.

Simply because they too must return to the void?
What would become of this world if our brethren, the stars, stopped giving their nurturing light?
The same that comes when we stop giving off ours.

SCP-963 is a interesting place to mine for tale ideas. As an example, there is one (type of) individual that should be immune to its effects - a Jack Bright that went past the 30 day mark. So if the Foundation wants an expert watching Bright, who better then a Bright to anticipate what he's up to?  And they've (sort of) given him what he wants:  //That version can live out a normal life and finally die.//
----
An -EX SCP; the original lay person explanation about  "Many Worlds Quantum" was that every decision, every coin toss generated a new universe.  Later, it's "Undetermined until observed, when it collapses the wave and resolves".

A tale about the CotBG winning by reassembling their god, but rather than it taking over the world it simply ascends to a more clockwork plane of existence taking its followers with it.

A SCP which was formerly a foundation Agent who got captured by one of the GOIs and exposed to //something//. The foundation only found out who their new SCP once was by DNA tests. Not a useful change, more body horror and nightmare fuel that the Agent might still be self-aware under whatever was done to them.
----
An SCP that consists of a barrel of totem-shaped penises with the shafts being in the shape of various 'baramins' of animals. When touched by a female belonging to said 'baramin', the female will become pregnant.

The offspring will live to around just after reaching sexual maturity. Their birth will cause the mother to ignore all pre-existing offspring and their death will cause the mother to undergo severe depression. Usage of the SCP renders the female infertile except for subsequent uses of the SCP.

----
An anomalous crime scenario involving a mass murder situation that always leaves only two suspects/witnesses remaining after the event with some sort of connection or relation that could make them accomplices. One or both of the suspects will either claim responsibility for the murders themselves or blame the other suspect, and will give an account of the crime that supports their claim, while the other will assert said account cannot be true, giving their own account of the event that conflicts with or contradicts the first. In any case, evidence recovered at the crime scene will be compatible with both accounts, but may be insufficient to give a clear picture of what happened. If the crime is not correctly "solved", i.e. authorities figured out exactly what happened during the event (who was responsible for which death, which details of either story are true, whose idea was it, etc.), within a certain amount of time, both suspects will self-terminate in a manner consistent between incidents, usually with a murder tactic or implement they or the other supposedly used during the crime, and the event will repeat itself some time later. 

Each instance of the crime will have some elements that denote it as an instance of the SCP, i.e. implements used or manner of death of at least one victim, but will otherwise create an entirely new scenario so study of previous instances does not provide any clues to subsequent ones. 

Not exactly sure how this would be contained, or even if it is contained, what makes it spread, how it would recognize having been "solved", how the Foundation finds out it needs to be solved, etc.

An SCP object made by AWCY... but what catches the Foundation's interest isn't the object itself so much as the vandalism done to it in response. Said vandalism is clearly done by someone other than AWCY, yet it seems to be creating its own anomalous effects which appear to be a mockery of/a response to/interfering with the intent of the original object. Over the "Are We Cool Yet?" logo would be graffiti reading something along the lines of "YES, UR F@(KING C00L NAO! 3NUF OF TH15 BU11$H17!" ("leetspeak" obfuscation not necessary)

Variances include manifestations of humans, also moving at this speed, that the demon interacts with in ways well just use your imagination. We cannot physically interact with it, and it is not inherently dangerous. Hooks… the presence of D-Class subjects during iterations. Ideas… we're peaking through at another dimension, possibly a partition of some kind of Hell, and we see things move there at a much faster rate. What is this thing's purpose? Can it see us? What happens if we destroy the environment where it manifests? When it interacts with the manifested humans, does anything get left behind?

A collection of notes regarding television programming from widely known media sources that seem to hint at some higher force influencing the nature of television programs. Probably not good as a skip, probably better as a skip-as-tale.

Someone saw a face near the sun. It peaks out from behind the sun occasionally. Can everyone see it? Is it threatening?
----

On a mountain in X you can see four white humanoid figures at the peak, motionless. You have the feeling that you're making eye contact when you look up at them. They're not always there, and when you go up to find them they're the same distance away from you. They also seem to be present in a few photographs you have lying around. They look like they might be moving closer.

An SCP about a faucet that pours acid instead water, no matter where it is installed. The acid comes from another dimensions and is highly corrosive, capable of destroying absolutely anything - including diamonds. Keter-class?

Puppy dog eyes as an anomalous event that is a cognito hazard, where puppy dog eyes force whoever sees them to either forget any wrong a dog has done, or give them food or let them out.

Metaphors are traditionally understood as figurative constructs that link otherwise unrelated things together. This is arrogance. Our world is simply the set of things that serve to link metaphors together.

"In lieu of recent events" - it's thought to be a miswording in Dr. Bright's bio. But what if it's not? What if history was rewritten to stop an XK event, with Jack saving the world by being trapped for all eternity?

When Dr. Bright was initially killed and imprisoned in [[[SCP-963]]], it was during a containment breach of [[[SCP-076]]]-2.  What if ORIGINALLY he dropped it a half second before dying and //ABLE// became trapped in the amulet instead?

Skip Idea: A beaver that was reincarnated as a chainsaw. But it still remembers the dirty catholics that ate it as a hangover cure after Mardi-Gras (look it up), and seeks revenge to this day. Only then can it rest. Only then.

Something with a Texas take on it:

"The name's Dark. Carter N. Dark. //MARSHALL// Carter N. Dark" (Pulls out six shooter and fires at the camera.)

A wild west themed SCP.

A memetic contagion that is an internet meme.

Write a tale where a conspiracy theory magazine learns of the Foundation's existence.

----

A pharaoh with the head of a turtle. Maybe have the turtle head be detachable?

----

A skip based on the Roland TB-303 synthesizer and the 80's 'acid rave' culture it revolved around. Why was it so underground? Did people really get shitfaced on drugs? Why were the media and police so against it? And more importantly: Is the movement really dead?

Don't forget the yellow smiley faces.

SCP #### is a China doll of some sort. Whenever anyone touches SCP ####, scp reforms into the person who touched it but when they were a kid. This can be useful for finding the origin of various scps.

----

A "beware of dog" sign that turns dogs into hellish creatures.

Do some skip involving platypuses with human faces on their backs. It's a mated pair and two litters of baby platypuses. The runt of the second litter died. It had a gulper eel's face on its back. Gross.

some guy who's so boring it friggin' hurts. Gives off an aura that makes people so unbelievably bored that they can't stand it anymore. Thinks he's some accountant or some shit.  Holy hell, this guy is dull. If his routine is broken the boredom aura expands super fast and it sucks major balls. If you can make this better, then major props, bro

These are ideas I was thinking about. If any of you guys wanna put your spin on it I don't care! You don't even have to credit me!

1. Food that turn into corpses when they expire.
2. Cliche green goo that has a crisis when contained.
3. A dimension where everything is alive and it all screams.
4. --Dr. Wondertainement's BOOK OF LEARNING!-- [DISCONTINUED]
5. A theme park that is growing bigger and bigger and will not stop making rides out of other houses and structures.

A pen that animates whatever is drawn with it made out of the material it is drawn on. If drawn on a living thing, the living thing dies and whatever was drawn is created in the process. If what was drawn can't gather enough materials from what it is drawn on, it becomes horribly disfigured.
