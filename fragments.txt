AKA: Stuff You Will Never Use, But Wanted To Share

The point of this page is simple. Everyone has pieces of stories, or articles, inside their head. Bits that you yourself may never use, but would still like to share/let someone else use. So, that's what this page is for.

//On an viral SCP that causes people to have sex with random strangers://

If this gets out, we could be looking at a XXXK event!
