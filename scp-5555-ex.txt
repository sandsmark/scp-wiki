SCP-5555-EX cannot be properly contained.

Should any individuals affected by SCP-5555-EX spread the message of their anomalous properties, their believability is to be discredited. However, if any of such persons continue said activities, they are to be given the diagnosis of mental illnesses by Foundation personnel disguised as medical professionals. If the mentioned action does not stop said individuals, they are to be disposed of.

**Revised Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5555-EX cannot be properly contained. However, due to its nature, no such procedures are necessary.

The consensus definition of SCP-5555-EX being an unexplainable and natural phenomenon is to be maintained - however, should any non-Foundation research prove otherwise, all persons involved in such a study are to be immediately amnestisized. Work of said persons is to be catalogued and assessed for any research value for the Foundation and otherwise disposed of.

**Description:** SCP-5555-EX is a phenomenon that manifests inside of the conciousness of individuals that have gone through amnesticization. During an episode in which a person experiences the effects of SCP-5555-EX, they are, for a short period of time, able to recollect memories erased by amnestics. In effect individuals affected by the anomaly answer to stimuli experienced in the past as an oposse to current ones. 

Though the exact biological mechanism behind the anomaly is currently not known, it is certain that individuals affected by SCP-5555-EX are not aware of the fact that they are experiencing erased memories.

The first appearance of SCP-5555-EX manifested in 1873, inside of the mind of Paul Verlaine, a French poet.

We of course cannot order him to stay, nor can we terminate a great friend of ours - I therefore propose a simple and harmless solution to this problem - amnestics. If he accepts my offer, all we could do is to wish him luck on his new road in life of becoming a poet.

> I come to you to apologise for my actions - I have discovered that the usage of amnestics does, in fact, have an unwanted effect. Though it is one of inconvenience at most, it's nature is anomalous nonetheless, as people affected by the phenomenon, usually appropriately refered to as "déjà vu" seem to, occasionally, experience a feeling during which they are, for a short period of time, sure that they have already lived through the current moment. As I take full responsibility for this peculiar occurence, I propose to personally research it further.

I wish I could present you with a different and more humane solution, but I am afraid it is the only thing we can do. We need to spread  and execute the message on __everyone__, no matter their status or knowledge.
