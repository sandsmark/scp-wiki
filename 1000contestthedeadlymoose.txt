**Item #:** SCP-1000

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** All media reports related to SCP-1000 are to be examined for potential verifiability. All civilian organizations and individuals investigating SCP-1000's existence are to be kept under surveillance and discredited or administered amnesiacs as appropriate. This is especially important for anthropologists, biologists, and any other scientist of high repute, but procedure also applies to cryptozoologists, hunters, and any other investigators, however amateur. Alleged sightings of SCP-1000 must always be investigated, however trivial the claim.

Any verifiable physical sign of SCP-1000's existence must be retrieved and kept in Foundation custody. Any previously unverifiable physical signs of SCP-1000's existence that becomes verifiable (through advances in civilian technology or new scientific discovery) must be retrieved and replaced with decoy items. 

Mobile Task Force Zeta-1000 has been assigned to this task. Use of any and all amnesiacs has been cleared for their procedures.

Any attempt by SCP-1000 to make contact with humans, especially Foundation personnel, must be reported directly to Director Jones immediately.

**Description:** SCP-1000 is a large, nocturnal, omnivorous ape in the hominid family, classified in the //Hominini// branch along with genera //Pan// and //Homo//. Adults range in size from 1.5 to 3 m (5 to 10 ft) in height, and weigh between 90 and 270 kg (200 - 600 lbs). They have grey, brown, black, red, and occasionally white fur. They possess large eyes with good vision, a pronounced brow ridge, and a sagittal crest on its forehead similar to that of the gorilla. SCP-1000 has intelligence on par with //Homo sapiens//.

SCP-1000 was brought to Foundation attention by the organization called the Sisters of the Sun on ██/██/███ (see attached documentation). This organization has since been subsumed into the Foundation, and their resources (including all unique technological items) classified separately as 1000-001-A - 1000-████-██. These resources have been made use of by the Foundation in [DATA EXPUNGED]

SCP-1000 evolved alongside //Homo sapiens//, existing contemporaneously with proto-humans and humans in large numbers until 10,000-15,000 years ago. [DATA EXPUNGED] 

Before Foundation involvement, the Sisters of the Sun worked to keep SCP-1000's existence hidden from public knowledge, using methods [DATA EXPUNGED] as well as systematic eradication of any fossil evidence of SCP-1000 or SCP-1000's relatives that was discovered by humans as the sciences of paleontology and archaeology advanced. 

The highest known population concentrations of SCP-1000 are at present located in the Pacific Northwest region of North America and the Himalayan Mountain range in Asia. As of ██/██/████, these populations remain extant. SCP-1000's presence and [DATA EXPUNGED] have also been documented within the past 5 years on every continent, including Antarctica. All known significant populations of SCP-1000 located near human population centers have been eliminated. The full list of locations in which significant populations of SCP-1000 have been eradicated can be found in Document 1000-6891-D-Antiquity and Document 1000-6891-D-Contemporary.

All personnel with clearance level 3/1000 or above are required to read Document Alpha-1596-1000.

**Addendum 1000-466-X: Update to Special Containment Procedures:** As of ██/██/████, SCP-1000's Special Containment Procedures no longer include Procedure 516-Lumina. [DATA EXPUNGED] indicates that SCP-1000 may be developing a resistance to the sonic element [DATA EXPUNGED] will not further develop, so that Procedure 516-Lumina can still be used in emergency situations. Investigation into alternate means of reliably keeping SCP-1000 away from human population centers is underway. Whether SCP-1000 resistance to Procedure 516-Lumina was calculated (and as such may be a sign of SCP-1000 [REDACTED]) or coincidental (by chance of natural species variation) is not known at this time.

**Document Alpha-1596-1000: Missive from Director Jones**

> You've probably heard the rumors before now. Everyone without the clearance level to know better wants to get their dig in. "Did you hear Sasquatch is an SCP? Are we gonna capture and contain Batboy next?"
> 
> Yes. Bigfoot is SCP-1000.
> 
> I'm sure you've snickered, reading this. Who hasn't? Don't worry. Contrary to rumors, we don't actually assign you to "Keter duty" for finding something humorous.
> 
> You think Bigfoot is funny because we //want// you to think Bigfoot is funny. We've bankrolled Hollywood comedies and farcical documentaries, paid off men in gorilla suits, perpetrated obvious hoaxes with bear prints and goat fur, bribed and brainwashed cartoonists to get especially silly depictions airtime on children's television. Even the term "Bigfoot" comes from us, planted in the media in 1958, a term people would find even harder to take seriously than "Sasquatch".
> 
> The reason we've done this is because SCP-1000 predates humanity, defined as members of //Homo sapiens sapiens//, as the dominant species of Earth.
> 
> The Sun Sisters came to us when we were young, after we'd been operating in [REDACTED] years. They told us a story we didn't believe - refused to believe, at first.
> 
> It happened around 15,000 to 10,000 years ago. The Sun Sisters weren't sure of the dates either - it's been too many thousands of years, and some of their records are less accurate. The written records they have were produced by SCP-1000, and we haven't been able to decipher all of it.
> 
> As you've already read, the apes we call SCP-1000 evolved alongside us. We walked in the daytime, they walked in the nighttime, our nocturnal siblings in the shadows. 
> 
> While we were still wandering hunter-gatherers, they... changed. Like we would, eventually. They developed agriculture. Domesticated animals. Began to form stable settlements. As humanity blinked in the Pleistocene sun, SCP-1000's population exploded across the night. We called them moon-walkers in primitive language, told our children to keep away from them, just as we warned them away from tusked mammoths and sharp-toothed lions.
> 
> We were rare, then, like gorillas now, only a few hundred thousand left, perhaps fewer. They fenced off our dwindling wild populations in conservatories, outlawed poaching but in the underground consumed our bones as aphrodisiacs. Taught a few of us to humorously approximate their howling, chirping language like we teach parrots to ask for crackers. 
>
> As we hid, their society evolved. Developed better and better tools, technology that we still can't comprehend, even though we've thoroughly studied the surviving pieces that the Sisters brought us. The Sisters tell stories of even more than what we've seen. SCP-1000 used organic technology, made trees and birds of prey grow into fast-moving ships, herds of animals that became trains, bushes that became flying vehicles. From insects and pigeons they made things like cell phones, televisions, computers. Atomic bombs.
> 
> They blanketed the planet in the tens of billions. The Sisters described vast shining cities, stretching across glaciers and penetrating the deepest caverns, grown skyships of ivory and spider-silk, creatures tending them with hundreds of blinking eyes. They covered the planet and reached for the stars.
> 
> Then their civilization fell. And we did it. By 'we' I don't mean the Foundation. By 'we', I mean humanity.
> 
> The myths passed down by the Sisters are muddy. The Sisters have few solid conjectures on how it actually happened, and Foundation investigation has come up dry. Supposedly a trickster forest god took pity on humanity and gave us the master's tools to give us a fighting chance. Either way, we somehow acquired SCP-1000's own technology. We instigated an SK-class dominance shift in which humanity became the dominant species of Earth. 
> 
> The weapons we used wiped out 70% of SCP-1000's population in a single night. The Night of Flowers, the Sisters called it. But we went further than just killing them. Some of SCP-1000's tools and weapons and technology had more in common with the things we contain than anything dreamed by a computer programmer. With them, we drove the survivors mad, even those hiding beyond our reach, trapped them in their own minds, blocking higher functions and leaving their bodies to fend for themselves like any ordinary animal. We slaughtered their living machines and burned their vast shining cities with SCP-1000's bioweapons that reduced everything to slurry and dust that washed or blew away in spring rain and wind. 
> 
> We left no traces behind. Or so we thought. This was before satellite photos, before archaeological digs, before humans could dust off old bones and identify the million-year-dead owners. We wiped them from history and memory. Even our own memory. Yes, we turned one of the weapons on ourselves. Wiped out any knowledge of SCP-1000 and the greatest civilization the planet had ever seen. Only a few humans, including the Sisters of the Sun, were left with any memory at all of the existence of SCP-1000. By the time we reached the modern age, only the Sisters were left.
> 
> Now we're reaching the apex of civilization that SCP-1000 did. A little more slowly, a bit more cautiously. Where they embraced the so-called supernatural, we guard against it. To protect ourselves. If we can.
> 
> You're going to find out soon enough, so I'll tell you here first: SCP-1000 may be somehow regaining their forgotten intelligence and knowledge. Maybe they already have, or maybe they never truly lost it. We don't know. The Sisters told us that SCP-1000 was developing some kind of selective-release racial memory. Some way of bringing themselves back from their destruction? We don't have all the old weapons anymore, and as for the ones we do... we simply don't understand most of them anymore. 
> 
> This is why we can't let SCP-1000 come in contact with human civilization. This is why the ever-increasing number of "Bigfoot sightings" is so worrying. Why the attempts at contact, however indecipherable, are even more worrying.
> 
> Yes. SCP-1000 //are// just like us. That's what makes them so dangerous. We wiped them from memory. We dissolved their civilization and we slaughtered most of their species. Just ask yourselves: If they got the chance, what more would they do to us?

**Addendum 1000-056-D:** Instances of SCP-1000 have tried to make contact with Foundation personnel on multiple occasions. Most of these attempts at contact have [DATA EXPUNGED] untranslated, though recent attempts show that some instances of SCP-1000 are capable of communicating in English. 

**Log 1000-ad065-x1:**: The following is a rough translation of recent SCP-1000 attempt at communication with Foundation personnel on ██/██/███ (see attached documentation). 
> we forgive you;
> given choice for now, not forever;
> let us back in
