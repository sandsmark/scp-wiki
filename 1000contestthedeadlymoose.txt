**Item #:** SCP-1000

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** All media reports related to SCP-1000 are to be examined for potential verifiability. All civilian organizations and individuals, such as cryptozoologists, investigating SCP-1000's existence are to be kept under surveillance and discredited or administered amnesiacs as appropriate. Alleged sightings of SCP-1000 must always be investigated, however trivial the claim.

Any attempt by SCP-1000 to make contact with humans, especially Foundation personnel, must be reported directly to Director Jones immediately. 

**Description:** SCP-1000 is a large, nocturnal, omnivorous ape in the hominid family, classified in the //Hominini// branch along with genera //Pan// and //Homo//. Adults range in size from 1.5 to 3 m (5 to 10 ft) in height, and weigh between 90 and 270 kg (200 - 600 lbs). They have grey, brown, black, red, and occasionally white fur. They possess large eyes with good vision, a pronounced brow ridge, and a sagittal crest on its forehead similar to that of the gorilla. SCP-1000 has intelligence on par with //Homo sapiens//.

The highest known population concentrations of SCP-1000 are at present located in the Pacific Northwest region of North America and the Himalayan Mountain range in Asia. As of ██/██/████, these populations remain extant. SCP-1000's presence has also been documented within the past 5 years on every continent, including Antarctica. All significant populations of SCP-1000 located near human population centers have been eliminated.  

The list of known locations in which significant populations of SCP-1000 have been eradicated in the last two centuries includes [DATA EXPUNGED] 

All personnel with clearance level 2/1000 or above are required to read Document Alpha-1596-1000.

**Document Alpha-1596-1000: Missive from Director Jones**

> You've probably heard the rumors before now. Everyone without the clearance level to know better wants to get their dig in. "Did you hear Sasquatch is an SCP? Are we gonna capture and contain Batboy next?"
> 
> Yes. Bigfoot is SCP-1000.
> 
> I'm sure you've snickered, reading this. Who hasn't? Don't worry. Contrary to rumors, we don't actually assign you to "Keter duty" for finding something humorous.
> 
> You think Bigfoot is funny because we //want// you to think Bigfoot is funny. We've bankrolled Hollywood comedies and farcical documentaries, paid off men in gorilla suits, perpetrated obvious hoaxes with bear prints and goat fur, bribed and brainwashed cartoonists to get especially silly depictions airtime on children's television. Even the term "Bigfoot" comes from us, planted in the media in 1958, a term people would find even harder to take seriously than "Sasquatch".
> 
> The reason we've done this is because SCP-1000 predates humanity, defined as members of //Homo sapiens sapiens//, as the dominant species of Earth.
> 
> SCP-1000 was brought to Foundation attention in 1███ after we'd been operating in [REDACTED] years. A dying organization calling themselves the Sun Sisters came to us, told us everything I'm about to tell you and more.
> 
> It happened around 15,000 to 10,000 years ago. The Sun Sisters weren't sure of the dates either - their records were mostly oral, at first, and oral records evolve most with time. The apes we call SCP-1000 evolved with us in the same way Neanderthals evolved with us. We walked in the daytime, they walked in the nighttime, our siblings in the shadows. 
> 
> While we were still wandering hunter-gatherers, they... changed. Like we would, eventually. They developed agriculture. Domesticated animals. Began to form stable settlements. As humanity blinked in the Pleistocene sun, SCP-1000's population exploded across the night. We called them moon-walkers in primitive language, told our children to keep away from them, just as we warned them away from tusked mammoths and sharp-toothed lions.
> 
> As we hid, they covered the world. Developed better and better tools, technology that we still can't comprehend. The descriptions handed down to the Sisters are shrouded in myth, but sound both familiar and alien. Stories of organic technology, trees and birds of prey growing into fast-moving ships, herds of animals that became trains, bushes that became flying vehicles. From insects and pigeons they made things like cell phones, televisions, computers. Atomic bombs.
> 
> We were rare, then, like gorillas now, only a few hundred thousand left, perhaps fewer. They kept us as pets, or in zoos. Fenced off our dwindling wild populations in conservatories, outlawed poaching but in the underground consumed our bones as aphrodisiacs. Taught some of us to approximate their howling, chirping language like we teach parrots to ask for crackers. 
> 
> They reached the technological level where we are now and surpassed it. They blanketed the planet in the tens of billions. The Sisters described vast shining cities, stretching across glaciers and penetrating the deepest caverns, grown skyships of ivory and spider-silk, creatures tending them with hundreds of blinking eyes. They covered the planet and reached for the stars.
> 
> Then we stopped them.
> 
> The myths passed down by the Sisters are muddy. Supposedly a trickster forest god took pity on humanity and gave us the tricks to overcome our oppressors. The surviving modern-day Sisters believe that we got hold of SCP-1000's own technology, bioweapons developed in a Cold War analogue to utterly decimate any enemy foolish enough to attack, their very own mutually assured destruction. The long and short of it is that we instigated an SK-class dominance shift in which humanity became the dominant species of Earth. 
> 
> According to the stories, SCP-1000's population didn't even know humanity was behind the attacks until months, even years into the process. By then, it was too late. 
> 
> Weapons were used that wiped out 70% of SCP-1000's population in a single night. The Night of Flowers, the Sisters called it. But we went further than just killing them. SCP-1000 had tools and weapons and technology that have more in common with the things we contain than the wildest dreams of a computer programmer. With the weapons we took from them, we drove the survivors mad, trapped them in their own minds, blocking higher functions and leaving their bodies to fend for themselves like any ordinary animal. We slaughtered their living machines and burned their vast shining cities with SCP-1000's own bioweapons that reduced everything to slurry and dust that washed or blew away in spring rain and wind. 
> 
> We left no traces behind.
> 
> The greatest civilization the planet had ever seen, and we wiped them from history and memory. Even our own memory. Yes, we turned some of the weapons on ourselves. Wiped out the history of being pets and zoo animals and a carefully protected endangered species. Only a few humans were allowed to remember the existence of SCP-1000, including the Sisters of the Sun. Until they contacted the Foundation in 1███, they were the only ones with this knowledge throughout humanity's modern era.
> 
> Now we're reaching the apex of civilization that SCP-1000 did. A little more slowly, a bit more cautiously. They embraced the so-called supernatural, we guard against it. To protect ourselves. If we can.
> 
> You're going to find out soon enough, so I'll tell you here first: SCP-1000 may be somehow regaining their forgotten intelligence and knowledge. Maybe they already have. We don't know. The most worrying thing that Sisters told us is that SCP-1000 may have developed some kind of time-released racial memory, some way of bringing themselves back from their destruction in the far future, when the time was right. We don't have the old weapons anymore, and if we do, we don't understand them anymore. 
> 
> This is why we can't let SCP-1000 come in contact with human civilization. This is why the ever-increasing number of "Bigfoot sightings" is so worrying. Why the attempts at contact, however indecipherable, are even more worrying.
> 
> Yes. SCP-1000 //are// just like us. That's what makes them so dangerous. We wiped them from memory. We dissolved their civilization and we slaughtered most of their species. Just ask yourselves: If they got the chance, what more would they do to us?

**Addendum 1000-056-D:** Instances of SCP-1000 have tried to make contact with Foundation personnel on multiple occasions. Most of these attempts at contact have [DATA EXPUNGED] untranslated, though recent attempts show that some instances of SCP-1000 are capable of communicating in English.
