**Item #:** SCP-2260

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2260 must be contained in Locker 43 located inside the storage room in Area-35. Any personnel wishing to use SCP-2260 for any purpose must fill out the mandatory SCP-2260 paperwork detailing location of choice, time wishing to be spent there, and activities performed at said location and submit the paperwork to Dr. Matthews, who will send the paperwork over to O5-█. All entries must be monitored by at least two security personnel, and any deviation from approved entries will be met with immediate termination.

**Description:** SCP-2260 is a green composition book with no markings or names on the front of the book. On the first page of the book, the sentence "I went to spend the rest of my life in Hawaii" is written in pencil. The pages are wide ruled, contains 200 pages, appears to be recently purchased, and all other details of SCP-2260's appearance remain the same of any other composition book. The book itself however, weighs 4.9 kg, which is far heavier than a normal composition book.

SCP-2260 has the ability to put subjects in a temporary coma and cause them to visualize the location specified in the writing. While they are not actually visiting the location, the details of the location are the exact same as the real location.

Anyone wishing to travel to a location using SCP-2260 must use a journal entry formatting. It must be written in the past tense, and specify a location the writer wants to go to (ex. I went to Japan), and what length of time the writer wants to stay at said location (ex. I stayed for 2 days). Extra details can be specified, such as specifying exact events that the writer wants to do, but this is not necessary. After the information is written in SCP-2260, the writer is rendered unconscious, and will remain unconscious until the time written down is fulfilled. There is no way to awaken the writer during the time they are unconscious. After the writer wakes up, they will recall every detail of the trip, and the entry into the book will fade away.

The book can be used to send people to fictional locations, locations that are not typically able to be reached, locations that no longer exist, and locations that do not exist yet. Subjects sent to locations existing in the past have been proven to be 100% accurate, and tests done with near future locations have been proven to be exact as well. 

Prolonged exposure to SCP-2260 has been shown to be very dangerous. Subjects that use SCP-2260 once a week or more have been prone to hallucinogenic episodes while awake, entering locations previously entered into SCP-2260. Light headedness and temporary amnesia has also been recorded in subjects. One extreme case had a subject permanently fall into a coma while awake. Subjects have stated that visiting a location while awake makes the location appear distorted, and that people inside the location will begin screaming at the subject to leave.

**Addendum 2260-A:**

|| Guatemala || 1 week || None || Subject remained unconscious for 1 week. Upon waking up, subject said they had a nice time. ||

|| The room subject is in 10 minutes in the future || 5 minutes || None || Subject woke up and stated that someone will interrupt the test. 8 minutes later Dr. Matthews stepped in to see how the test was doing. || 
|| [[[SCP-990|SCP-990]]] || 10 hours || An interview || Subject woke prematurely, screamed, and assaulted a security personnel with multiple blows to the head. Before subject could be terminated, subject took the belt of the unconscious security personnel and suffocated themselves for 4 minutes before their demise.||

|| Atlantis || 2 days || Having a breathing apparatus on ||Subject remained unconscious for 2 days, and awoke to tell many stories of advanced technology and a city at the bottom of the ocean. It appears the previous subject drowned while at the location. ||
|| Surface of the sun || 10 minutes || Being able to survive the sun's heat || Subject awoke after 10 minutes just as planned. Subject questioned why the room was darkening, and became permanently blind following 5 minutes. ||

Further testing has been requested.

**Addendum 2260-B:**
The book was initially found in the possession of Mr. James R██████, who had written the entry about going to Hawaii. It is presumed that because he specified a time that will end upon his demise, he will never wake up from SCP-2260. Testing has been done on his vitals while in the comatose state. SCP-2260 keeps all brain activity normal, and appears to regulate heart beat and other vital organs. It also regenerates cell structure 10 times quicker than that of a normal human. James has been put in the Cryogenics Area in Sector C for further testing.

**Addendum 2260-C:**
D-████ made a personal request to re-use SCP-2260 after using it previously to go to [DATA EXPUNGED]. They were accepted the request, and another test was performed. D-████ made another request to use SCP-2260 only 2 days following the previous experiment, and the request was denied due to the short amount of time between testing. D-████ was told they could use it again in a month. After the month passed, another test was performed on D-████, who was very eager to comply with all commands issued. Upon waking from unconsciousness, D-████ immediately requested another use of SCP-2260. Once D-████ was denied, they went into a fit of rage and attacked themselves, security, and research personnel alike. They were apprehended, were told they could never use SCP-2260 again, and were sent into psychological counselling. A few weeks later, D-████ was found dead with a tongue chewed off, bloody fingernails, and scratches on the wall stating "Without that book, I --have-- am nothing". 

It appears that SCP-2260 causes addiction in some of the users of it. While D-████ was an extreme case, other D-class subjects have made requests to re-use SCP-2260, despite how dangerous the previous test may have been. One D-class subject repeatedly said "Give me the book" and refused to eat, sleep, or even move. Upon another test with SCP-2260, they resumed a normal physique until 2 days had passed, in which they would not do anything until a test was performed with SCP-2260. They are currently still in psychological counselling.

**Addendum 2260-D:**
The goal of this experiment was to test what happens when a subject enters a secondary SCP-2260 while inside SCP-2260. There was two medical personnel at hand, three security personnel, two research assistants, and Dr. Matthews was present to observe the experiment.

Timeline of experiment:
0 Minutes: Subject went into unconsciousness, and brain activity remained normal. 
4 minutes: Brain activity doubles and regulation of vital organs and heartbeat double as well.
10 minutes: Subject begins to perspire heavily
15 minutes: Perspiration of sweat turns into perspiration of blood.
25 minutes: Subject's brain activity and regulation doubles again, making bodily functions quadruple their normal speed. It is assumed that subject entered SCP-2260 again while inside the secondary SCP-2260.
32 minutes: Brain begins to swell, and subject begins to become pale.
35 minutes: Heart fails. Stomach lining bursts from excess gastric acid.
36 minutes: Attempts were made to erase the entry from SCP-2260. Entry reappears each time. Medical personnel were attempting to revitalize subject by using a defibrillator.
41 minutes: Subject expires. Entry fades from the book.

**Addendum 2260-E:**
Other Experiments:

Test on 3/4/██: Entry was written on a loose-leaf paper and stuffed into the book. No effect took place.

Test on 5/██/██: Entry was written in the book, and the page was immediately torn out. Subject slipped into unconsciousness and went to specified location. Entry faded when subject awakened.

Test on 6/14/1█: A page was torn out of book, and the entry was written on the torn out page. No effect took place.

Test on 6/2█/1█: The entry was written, and immediately whited out. Words in the entry burned through the white out, and were visible after 9 seconds.

Test on 7/██/██: The entry was written, and the page was carefully burned as to not burn the book.  Once page was burned away, the entry appeared on the next page.

Test on 8/7/1█: The entry was written without an event specified, and once subject went into unconsciousness, a secondary subject wrote in an event. Secondary subject also fell into unconsciousness, and when both awoke (at the same time), both claimed to have seen the other at the location.

Test on 8/13/1█: Based on the previous experiment, two subjects were dedicated to simultaneously write two different entries. Both subjects become unconscious, and woke up at the times specified in the entry. When the subjects woke up, they claimed the locations had merged, and residents of the location were "glitchy".
