**Presented To:** [[[SCP-682]]]
**Number of Documents:** 1000
**Document Content:** Upon beginning his review, Agent █████ fell unconscious after reading the first few sentences.  Computer analysis has revealed that the documents are in English, but are unreadable due to a theorized memetic effect that causes the reader to fall into a coma.
