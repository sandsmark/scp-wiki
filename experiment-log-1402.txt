**Presented To:** [[[SCP-173]]]
**Number of Documents:** 432

**Document Content:** Documents were originally written in German.  Revealed SCP-500 to have been created in ██████, Germany, in a medical painkiller factory alongside the normally manufactured painkillers.  Unfortunately, these documents revealed only the very start of each pill's existence rather than what chemical combination was needed to create them.

**Date:** ██/██/20██
**Presented To:** [[[SCP-682]]]
**Number of Documents:** 1000
**Document Content:** Upon beginning his review, Agent █████ fell unconscious after reading the first few sentences.  Computer analysis has revealed that the documents are in English, but are unreadable due to a theorized memetic effect that causes the reader to fall into a coma.
