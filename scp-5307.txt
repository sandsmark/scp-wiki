SCP-5307 is an olfactohazard found within an oil designed for a personal vaporizer. The containers are labeled as "Donk Juice, The Juice You Jam To" and are found at convenience stores across the Southern United States. SCP-5307 is marketed as a flavored CBD musical mood enhancer distributed by Western Wilds, LLC. 

Upon olfaction of SCP-5307, a neurological event occurs causing altered audio and visual perception. Subjects exposed to SCP-5307 will internally visualize a music video featuring a humanoid donkey resembling [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4768 SCP-4768]; songs observed appear to be parodies of popular songs released between 1970 and 2010. The duration of the event varies based on the length of the parodied song, typically 2-6 minutes. The affected individual will only vaguely recall the exact contents of the SCP-5307 event, though will remember the basic themes and structure of the song. SCP-5307 has no known negative effects on exposed subjects.

++++ **__Discovery__**
Numerous reports of hallucinations of an entity matching SCP-4768's description in Texas, Georgia, and Louisiana led MTF Kappa-12 ("Rough Riders") to discover SCP-5307. All instances of SCP-5307 were traced to convenience store franchise "1-Stop". At this time, MTF Epsilon-17 was dispatched to handle the situation, with MTF Kappa-12 providing auxiliary support. 
[[/div]]
[[div class="addenda-header"]]
++++ **__Investigation__**
The "1-Stop" franchise cooperated fully during the SCP-5307 investigation, willingly providing their entire supply of SCP-5307 and all known information on its origin. The "1-Stop" franchise records indicate that they purchased its supply of SCP-5307 from a company known as Western Wilds, LLC, a limited liability company based in Delaware, USA. While the filing records indicate the owner of the license to be Harold Thompson, the address given for the agent of record does not exist. 

As of the filing of this record, no known address exists for Mr. Thompson or Western Wilds, LLC. A nation-wide search for a known address yielded a divorce case filed in the state of Texas, indicating that Mr. Thompson is divorced and gave a legitimate address for his ex-wife, Carolyn McLean.

**Date:** 2016/07/18

**Interviewer:** Agent Eric Sonder 

**Interviewed:** Carolyn McLean

**Foreword:** Carolyn McLean is being interviewed regarding her knowledge of POI-5307W and Western Wilds, LLC.

**[BEGIN LOG]**

**Agent Sonder:** Okay Mrs. Th–

**McLean:** Miss, it's Ms. McLean.

**Agent Sonder:** Of course, //Ms. McLean//, are you ready to begin?

**McLean:** Yes, but you need to make this quick. I need to pick my son up from practice and God knows I've wasted enough time on Harry.

**Agent Sonder:** I'd like to discuss Mr. Thompson's business.

**McLean:** //[Ms. McLean snorts.]// Of course, 10 years wasn't enough– now I've gotta' listen to more of this bullshit.

**Agent Sonder:** I'm sor–

**McLean:** Listen, my ex-husband was pretty great when we met, he was an outgoing entrepreneur. But after his father passed, something changed. He became obsessed with those– those donkey men.

**Agent Sonder:** You're referring to Ulysses B. Donkman? 

**McLean:** Yeah sure, whatever you want to call it. Those //things// ruined my marriage. Harry went on and on about how his family didn't understand the damn things, how there was //"a fortune to be made"//.

**Agent Sonder:** You speak as if there is more than one?[[footnote]]Prior to this interview, the Foundation had no knowledge of a second SCP-4768 instance or similar entity.[[/footnote]]

**McLean:** I don't know much– but I know there are two of them.

**Agent Sonder:** Alright, and Mr. Thompson's family has a connection to these "donkey-men"?

**McLean:** Obsession is more like it. As Harry told it, his father, grandfather, and great grandfather [http://www.scp-wiki.net/ulysses-b-donkman-and-the-heinous-hitman all tried to kill one of the damned things]. But not Harry, he thinks he can make money off of it.

**Agent Sonder:** So he is working with the entities?

**McLean:** //"Entities"//, you make it sound like this isn't all fantasy bullshit. No, of course he's not working with the //"entities"//, him and his little club are trying to capture them or something. You should've seen his office, it had newspaper clippings and photos pinned to the wall with strings. Like some sort of serial killer collage.

**Agent Sonder:** So he created Western Wilds in an attempt to capture and exploit the entities?

**McLean:**  Listen, I get you have a job to do, but I really don't know much else. Once Harry started trying to get our son involved, I had to get out and away from all of it. I'm just trying to put the whole thing behind me, okay?

**Agent Sonder:** I understand, do you have any of your ex-husband's material here?

**McLean:** I have a box with a few of his things, I burned the rest. You're more than welcome to take it with you.

**Agent Sonder:** Okay Ms. McLean, we're just about finished here. I have to ask again for the record, do you have any idea of your ex-husband's whereabouts, or anything else to do with his company?

**McLean:** No, like I told you– I haven't spoken to him in years.

**Agent Sonder:** Thank you, Ms. McLean. I won't take up any more of your time.

**[BEGIN LOG]**

**Mr. Thompson:** Is everything okay? I got the emergency sign–

**Ms. McLean:** They came to me today, they were asking questions. About you, the Donkman, all of it! What's going on?

**Mr. Thompson:** Who came to see you? Was it the GOC again? 

**Ms. McLean:** No, this was different. They said that they were from the State Department, but something wasn't right. They knew too much!

**Mr. Thompson:** They didn't follow you did they? 

**Ms. McLean:** I'm not an idiot Harry, I spent 8 hours making sure! 

**Mr. Thompson:** You don't remember anything that might've stood out?

**Ms. McLean:** //[Several seconds of silence.]// Yeah, yeah I do. You got a pen? Good yeah, hand me that napkin. 

**Mr. Thompson:** What for?

**Ms. McLean:** You'll see, just  hold on.

//[Several seconds of silence.]//

**Ms. McLean:** Yeah that's it– this symbol was on the pen he was using, does–

**Mr. Thompson:** Shit, shit, shit. 

**Ms. McLean:** Harry, what's wrong? Who are these people? You told me that if we separated, me and Kenny would be safe!

**Mr. Thompson:** Listen, everything will be fine. Go home, get Kenny, pack some bags, and meet me here in 2 hours.

**Ms. McLean:** What, why–

**Mr. Thompson:** Carolyn, please! Just go get Kenny. I'll explain everything, I just need to tie up one loose end. 

**[END LOG]**

The surveillance team was ordered to follow Mr. Thompson, as an auxiliary team apprehended Ms. McLean en route to her home. Mr. Thompson placed a call via speakerphone 15 minutes after the encounter with Ms. McLean.

**Mr. Thompson:** Aloysius, we've got a problem.

**Unknown:** How delightfully casual. What is the problem, //Mr.// Thompson?

**Mr. Thompson:** It's the Foundation, they're on to us, sir. 

**Unknown:** Preposterous, they should be hot-on-the-heels of my imbecile brother.

**Mr. Thompson:** They spoke to Carolyn, they were in my home! We've got to call it off, tell the others–

**Unknown:** Now you listen here, //you// despicable ingrate, //you// are responsible for this! I have tolerated your nonsense for far too long.

**Mr. Thompson:** But I did everything we discussed! I don't know where I went wrong.

**Unknown:** Oh yes, I think you have done quite enough. You were supposed to draw more attention to my brother– not lead them to my doorstep. You're just as useless as him.

**Mr. Thompson:** Sir please, I can fi–

**Unknown:** I grow tired of your excuses, your promises– more so.

**Mr. Thompson:** Tell me what to do, please!

**Unknown:** If the Foundation wants their pound of flesh, they can certainly have it. Good day, Mr. Thompson.

//[The call can be heard ending]//

**Mr. Thompson:** Fuck, fuck, fu– 

//[Mr. Thompson begins screaming incoherently and exits his vehicle, collapsing on the ground. The surveillance team rushes in; Mr. Thompson's body can be seen warping and distorting. A short flash of light envelopes Mr. Thompson, temporarily disabling the video feed. As the feed resumes, all that remains is a donkey with Mr. Thompson's head.]//

//[Mr. Thompson begins to shriek in a manner similar to a donkey braying.]//

Mr. Thompson expired 4 hours after his containment, due to severe internal hemorrhaging caused by his transfiguration. Ms. McLean and her son were amnestisized and released, with Cover Story Y665T (Fatal Motor Vehicle Incident) enacted. The recipient of the call placed by Mr. Thompson is currently unidentified; an investigation into its identity and whereabouts is currently ongoing.
