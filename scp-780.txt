**Item #:** SCP-780

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**
SCP-780 must be kept in a locked steel box 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm, with walls at least 1 cm thick. This box is to be kept on a 5 meter pedestal, at the center of a 20 meter x 20 meter concrete room. Individuals wishing to approach SCP-780 must submit to a full-body search, and may not bring plants (living or artificial), images of plants, descriptions of plants, or digital displays of any kind within 10 meters of SCP-780 except as part of a preapproved test protocol. Individuals with plant tattoos are likewise forbidden from approaching SCP-780 except during testing.

Individuals who come into contact with SCP-780-1 are to be terminated and cremated.

**Description:**
SCP-780 is a small gem, 1 cm in diameter, with six petals and a hole at its center. When a plant or representation of a plant (including artificial plants, photographs of plants, drawings and paintings of plants, particularly vivid textual descriptions of plants, or any of the above appearing on a screen of any sort) is placed within 10 meters of SCP-780, the four petals which do not contain holes will begin to flap, and it will fly towards the plant. How SCP-780 detects plants is unknown at this time. If restrained, SCP-780 will become increasingly agitated until the plant is removed from its radius.

If allowed to come into contact with the plant (hereafter the "host plant"), SCP-780 will stick to it for a period of five (5) seconds, at which time it will fall to the floor. Once it lays flat against the floor, it becomes fixed until the next stage of the process. Within ten (10) minutes, a shoot will be seen growing from within the hole at the center of SCP-780; this will mature to a fully-grown specimen of the host plant within twenty-four (24) hours. This new plant is designated SCP-780-1. Even if the host plant was not a living, physical plant, SCP-780-1 will be, though in all other traits (color, height, general form) it will match the depiction of the host plant.

SCP-780-1 has the same requirements for sun and atmosphere as the host plant, but does not have a root system, and therefore does not require water or any particular soil conditions. Despite lacking roots, SCP-780-1 will not fall over regardless of imbalance or pressure applied; attempts to dig up the ground SCP-780-1 sits on result in [DATA EXPUNGED]. SCP-780-1 is equally susceptible to damage as the host plant; anything which would kill the host plant will also kill SCP-780-1. Upon its death, it will rot unusually quickly, and SCP-780 may be retrieved.

Any organism which comes into contact with SCP-780-1 (designated SCP-780-2) will immediately begin to feel lethargic, seeking to find an environment suitable for cultivation of the host plant. Within a day, SCP-780-2 will fall into a coma, dying shortly thereafter. At this point, an autopsy will reveal that SCP-780-2's internal structure has been replaced with plant material: blood vessels now carry xylem and phloem, their bones are now composed of dense wood, etc. If cremated at this point, no further effects are observed. However, if left for a week, new instances of the host plant will begin to sprout from the surface of SCP-780-2, sufficient to completely cover it. These new plants have no unusual properties, aside from rapid growth leading to their becoming fully-grown a week after sprouting.

**Addendum:**
**Document #780-A**
SCP-780 was recovered when a freak windstorm in the woods outside ██████████████, ██ left only one tree, SCP-780-1, standing. Attempts to investigate resulted in ██ civilian casualties before coming to the attention of Agent █████, embedded in the local police force. SCP-780-1 was felled by Mobile Containment Task Force ███ ("███████ ████"), using robotically-controlled chainsaws. Upon the decay of SCP-780-1, SCP-780 freed itself and imprinted on a nearby blade of grass; Task Force ███ eventually used flamethrowers to scorch an area ██ meters in diameter to retrieve SCP-780.
