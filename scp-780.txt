**Item #:** SCP-780

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-780 must be kept in a locked steel box 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm, with walls at least 1 cm thick. This box is to be kept on a 5 meter pedestal, at the center of a 20 meter x 20 meter concrete room. Individuals wishing to approach SCP-780 must submit to a full-body search, and may not bring plants (living or artificial), images of plants, descriptions of plants, or digital displays of any kind within 10 meters of SCP-780 except as part of a preapproved test protocol. Individuals with plant tattoos are likewise forbidden from approaching SCP-780 except during testing.

**Description:** SCP-780 is a small gem, 1 cm in diameter, with six petals and a hole at its center. Two of the petals have smaller holes. It appears to be made of a pink amorphous substance; studies suggest it has a structure similar to that of polyvinyl chloride, but this does not account for its reaction to plants. While SCP-780 does not melt at temperatures exceeding 3500 K, cooling it to below 24 K temporarily changes its structure into a crystalline form, allowing it to be damaged by blunt impacts.

When a plant or representation of a plant (including artificial plants, photographs of plants, drawings and paintings of plants, particularly vivid textual descriptions of plants, or any of the above appearing on a screen of any sort) is placed within 10 meters of SCP-780, the four petals which do not contain holes will begin to flap in a manner akin to an insect, and it will fly towards the plant. How SCP-780 detects plants is unknown at this time. If restrained, SCP-780 will become increasingly agitated until the plant is removed from its radius.

If allowed to come into contact with the plant (hereafter the "host plant"), SCP-780 will stick to it for a period of five (5) seconds, at which time it will fall to the floor. Once it lays flat against the ground, it cannot be removed except as noted below. Within ten (10) minutes, a shoot will be seen growing from within the hole at the center of SCP-780; this will mature to a fully-grown specimen of the host plant within twenty-four (24) hours. This new plant is designated SCP-780-1. Even if the host plant was not a living, physical plant, SCP-780-1 will be, though in all other traits (color, height, general form) it will match the depiction of the host plant.

SCP-780-1 has the same requirements for sun and atmosphere as the host plant, but does not have a root system, and therefore does not require water or any particular soil conditions. Despite lacking roots, SCP-780-1 will not fall over regardless of imbalance or pressure applied; attempts to dig up the ground SCP-780-1 sits on result in [DATA EXPUNGED]. SCP-780-1 is equally susceptible to damage as the host plant; anything which would kill the host plant will also kill SCP-780-1. Upon its death, it will rot unusually quickly, and SCP-780 may be retrieved.

If the host plant was a flowering plant, when it has fully matured a new copy of SCP-780 will burst out of each of its flowers, affixing to the nearest plant or falling inert to the ground if no plant (other than SCP-780-1) is within its radius. If the host plant was not a flowering plant, its seeds will be copies of SCP-780, with the same properties as above. Flowers or seeds removed from SCP-780-1 before it reaches maturation will be seen to contain smaller, misshapen copies of SCP-780, but these do not react to plants in any way.

**Addendum:**
**Document #780-A**
SCP-780 was recovered when flyovers of the █████ desert reported an odd stand of ███ trees where insufficient water should have existed for their survival. Initial response from the ████████ government included a botanist carrying "███████████ ██ ████," which included a picture of the ███████ bush on the cover. Upon approaching the site, multiple copies of SCP-780 flew toward the book, and the researchers fled; when they returned a day later, many more copies of the  ███████ bush were growing at the site. Communication between the research team and their contacts was intercepted by Agent █████, who intervened on behalf of the ████████ government. Mobile Containment Task Force ███ ("███████ ████") was dispatched, using incendiary devices to incinerate all plants in the area. All instances of SCP-780 were retrieved, and all but one has been destroyed to reduce the risk of further growth.

**Document #780-B** Research Log
The following experiments were performed to evaluate the extent of SCP-780's abilities

**Experiment 780-e1**
**Host Plant**: Sunflower
**Result**: Full-grown sunflower produced in 24 hours, with one new copy of SCP-780 within flower

**Experiment 780-e2**
**Host Plant**: Photograph of sunflower used in Experiment 780-e1
**Result**: Resulting flower was identical to the one produced in Experiment 780-e1

**Experiment 780-e3**
**Host Plant**: Painting of sunflower used in Experiment 780-e1
**Result**: Resulting flower was similar to the one produced in Experiment 780-e1, but slight differences (number of petals, shades of color) showed it to be a copy of the painting, not the original plant.

**Experiment 780-e4**
**Host Plant**: Painting of sunflower, with only a single petal rather than many yellow ones
**Result**: Resulting flower matched that of the painting

**Experiment 780-e5**
**Host Plant**: The word "sunflower"
**Result**: No response

**Experiment 780-e6**
**Host Plant**: A one-paragraph description of a sunflower
**Result**: Resulting flower matched description in paragraph

**Experiment 780-e7**
**Host Plant**: A one-paragraph description of [DATA EXPUNGED]
**Result**: [DATA EXPUNGED]
//Remember, SCP-780-1 only has the vulnerabilities of the host plant! Anyone at Site ██ found with text reading "Invulnerable tree which reaches to the moon" will be demoted to Keter duty!//

//- Dr. █████████//

**Experiment 780-e8**
**Host Plant**: [[[SCP-038]]]
**Result**: Resulting plant appeared identical to SCP-038, but lacked its ability to reproduce items touched to its trunk

**Experiment 780-e9**
**Host Plant**: [[SCP-376]]
**Result**: While exhibiting the outward appearance of SCP-376, little growth was observed after 24 hours, and lacking a root system, it was unable to infect other power systems
//Further testing on plant-like SCP objects is canceled, as their unique properties do not appear to be reproduced.//

//- Dr. █████████//

**Experiment 780-e10**
**Host Plant**: Apple (unplanned experiment; researcher ██-████ had brought an apple for lunch)
**Result**: Full apple tree grew. After additional SCP-780 burst from apples, remaining parts given to D-class test subjects; reported to be tasty if a bit acidic. No complications arose. Research into large-scale food production on hold pending approval.
