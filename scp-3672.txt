**Item #:** SCP-3672

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All and any possible information concerning PoI-365 is to be filtered by Protocol 3672-Lamech, and data deemed relevant is to be sent to the two extant teams of researchers at both Site-102 and Reliquary Site-██. The full contents of Protocol 3672-Lamech are not to be made available to both teams at any time.

**Description:** SCP-3672 is a phenomenon centered around an individual known as Michael Scrivener, designated PoI-365. Through an isolated CK-class reality restructuring scenario almost all information concerning Scrivener, save some limited information compiled by the Foundation and similar organizations beforehand, has been erased from history and historical record. 

What limited extant information indicates is that Scrivener was male, Catholic (see Addendum-1) and worked as a puppeteer for primarily motion pictures, typically working with full body puppets. What limited information exists indicates that he was most notably employed to perform the character Sweetums in the 1979 film //The Muppet Movie//, filling in for Richard Hunt. Hunt later provided the voice of the character.  He also is recorded to have puppeteered in other films by the Jim Henson Associates company, such as the 1982 film //The Dark Crystal//, the 1984 film //The Muppets Take Manhattan//, and the 1986 film //Labyrinth//, where he possibly potrayed the character Ludo. He was probably dismissed from the Jim Henson Associates company that year, and appeared as a Sasquatch type creature in the 1987 film //Harry and The Hendersons//, followed by numerous unknown commercials. Several charities reported large donation from Scrivener at this time, but which charities these are or were is unknown.

In early 1995, Scrivener was reported missing, and later that year Foundation Hume counters briefly recorded a CK-Class reality altering scenario, which lasted 1.5 seconds. Following which, evidence concerning his life and career were completely erased. Private and public memory of Scrivener has been altered, and no possessions or accounts can be traced to him. The roles of his that can be verified within 75% probability have been performed by Richard Hunt, Ron Mueck, and Kevin Peter Hall.

The Foundation became aware of SCP-3672 when the backup DEEPWELL database of stored public information reported several broken or false uploads following the event.

**Addendum:** There currently exists only one piece of evidence for Scrivener's existence, pre-SCP-3672 and outside Foundation DEEPWELL servers. A damaged handwritten note was located in a drawer inside St. Teresa of the Child Jesus Roman Catholic Church in Borehamwood, England.

I cannot see you in person due to the circumstances, but I have been told that my [ILLEGIBLE] means [DAMAGED] is happening again and what is in Genesis 5:24 is that [DAMAGED]. I ask for forgiveness, and I request a prayer for strength that I may walk in the steps of the light and fulfill the Twelve Steps of Pity unto Him. [DAMAGED] is with [ILLEGIBLE] now. I am regretful for my sins and I hope I have done enough with my life. I wish to be absolved.

The implications of this note are complex and unclear, and research is pending.
