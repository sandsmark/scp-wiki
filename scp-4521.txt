**Item #:** SCP-4521

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4521 is to be kept in Site-551's Bioterrarium and only accessible by personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher. Additionally, attempts are to be made daily in an attempt to provoke vocalizations from SCP-4521.

**Description:** SCP-4521 is a Douglas fir tree with abnormal shape and leaves. SCP-4521 was discovered within God's Silence, Oregon after reports of an "ear piercing silence" from within the tree's vicinity. Amnestics were administered, and SCP-4521 was transported by implanted Foundation agents to Site-551.

Currently, SCP-4521's anomalous property is that it is incapable of screaming. No apparatuses are found on SCP-4521 that allow it to scream, and attempting to create one has been met with failure (see testing log). Attempts are being made to provoke screaming within SCP-4521. 

No memetic or cognitohazardous phenomena originate from or affect SCP-4521. Multiple attempts using several other anomalies have been made to detect any screaming, but no screaming was detected.

**Test Log:** The following are attempts made by on-site personnel to eliminate SCP-4521's anomalous ability.


> **Test 1:** Carve a mouth on SCP-4521.
> 
> **Outcome:** Several holes were placed upon SCP-4521 using a chainsaw. No screaming appears to emanate from these holes. 

> **Test 2:** Use an extremely hot branding iron to imprint the word "SLAVE" onto the base of the tree.
> 
> **Outcome:** No screaming detected. Brand disappeared within 2 days time.

> **Test 3:** Place multiple species of spiders upon SCP-4521's base.
> 
> **Outcome:** No screaming detected. Approximately 30% continued to stay on the tree. 50% of the spiders that stayed burrowed further into the tree. No screaming was detected during this time.
> 

> **Test 4:** Take a tree that is genetically similar/related to SCP-4521, and slowly destroy it in a close radius around it. 
> 
> **Outcome:** Tree successfully destroyed over the course of 28 hours. No screaming detected.
> 

> **Test 5:** Take a tree that is genetically similar/related to SCP-4521, and [REDACTED].
> 
> **Outcome:** [REDACTED BY REQUEST OF ETHICS COMMITTEE]. No screaming detected.

> **Test 6:** Use a D-Class personnel under the effects of mnestics in the event that SCP-4521's screaming is antimemetic.
> 
> **Outcome:** No screaming detected.


> **Test 7:** Attempt to communicate with SCP-4521.
> 
> **Outcome:** See attached audio file.
