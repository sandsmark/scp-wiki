**Item #:** SCP-666

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-666 is to be stored in a monitored, closed vault at all times at Site 73 in the Tibetan mountains. Guards are to be changed weekly, selected from only the most trustworthy SCP personnel. All guards must pass a background check before being assigned to their post, and proven free of drug and alcohol addiction. 

Entrance to SCP-666 is only to be granted to approved operatives with level 4 Security Clearance, with appropriate documentation and approval from human resources pending a background check. Any personnel attempting unauthorized entry is to be detained pending psychiatric evaluation. Any unapproved personnel found in the vicinity of SCP-666 is to be terminated or enter drug rehabilitation courses, dependent on security level.


**Description:** SCP-666 is a medium sized Tibetan yurt, made of tied wooden branches and covered in Yak leather. The interior ceiling is 2.44m (8ft) high and the base of the yurt is 9.14m (30ft). The hut is circular in shape. The interior of the yurt appears to be as crude as the outside to the majority of observers, with a dirt floor; the branches that make up the yurt frame are wrapped in rabbit fur and tied with yak leather thongs. 

SCP-666 was discovered in 1973 by SCP operatives searching the mountain regions on reports of a "wendigo" sighting - seeking shelter during a blizzard, the operatives ducked into the abandoned hut. Of the three operatives present, two experienced no ill effects. The third entered a stupor, experiencing vivid hallucinations and muttering incoherently to himself. Upon retrieval of the team, the yurt was recovered and taken to nearby site 73 for further investigation.

When an operative of sound mind and body, and clean history enters the yurt, the yurt remains dormant and seems to have no ill effects. Class D Personnel without a history of alcohol or narcotics abuse were able to sit inside the yurt for days at a time provided proper nourishment, but did report a greater intensity in their dreams. Class D Personnel who did have a history of substance abuse, however, all experienced a hallucinogenic effect when inside the structure. The effect increases in intensity the longer the subject is inside the Yurt, until the subject is removed, stumbles out, or dies.

Subjects who recover from the experience give mixed reports, but all report seeing a different room when entering the yurt, each room varying based on the subject. Reports are mixed ; A nightclub bathroom, a 1973 volkswagon vanagon, a filthy alleyway. One subject reported finding himself in a dirty apartment with a prostitute named "Chloe", whom he claimed to have "shot up" with, before "doing a line off her ass". 

Oddly, a few researchers have reported entering the yurt and finding themselves in an upscale coffee bar. Though the effects of exposure are neither strong nor life threatening, it is advised that any researcher finding SCP-666 in a nondormant state remove themselves from the structure and reduce caffeine intake immediately.
