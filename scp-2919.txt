**Item #:** SCP-2919

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2919 is to be contained within Provisional Site-31. SCP-2919-1 instances are to be monitored at all times for new changes in behavior. No personnel are allowed to interact with SCP-2919-1 instances without permission from Level 3-2919 clearance personnel. Minkowski Spacetime Monitors are to be set up around SCP-2919 and Provisional Site-31, and will monitor any gravitational distortions within an area of 1 kilometer. These are to be routinely checked and repaired. Due to the limited spatial control of SCP-2919-1 instances, it is unlikely for any major distortions to occur. If one occurs, personnel at Provisional Site-31 are to follow Protocol Eureka-4 (detailed in Document 2919-E4). Non-Foundation personnel who discover SCP-2919 or Provisional Site-31 are to be administered Class-A Amnestics.

**Description:** SCP-2919 is a large abandoned factory located in Norrbotten County, Sweden. SCP-2919 is not accessible by road or footpath. It is believed that SCP-2919 was constructed at some point during the 1960s-1980s, based on the architectural style and apparent age of the building. One part of SCP-2919 has a mural painted on the eastern facing wall of what is presumed to be the main entrance to SCP-2919. The mural is 5m x 10m, and features black and white depictions of an unknown person, presumably of authority, in the middle. Scientists and engineers are on the left side, and instances of SCP-2919-1 are on the right. All of them are saluting. The background resembles the flag of the Kalmar Union[[footnote]] The Kalmar Union was a personal union of the kingdoms of Denmark, Sweden (including Finland), and Norway (including Norway's overseas territories). The union lasted from 1397 to 1523 [[/footnote]]. On a wall opposite to the mural there is red text reading, "SUOJAA KANSAMME[[footnote]] This translates to "Protect our People" in English. The original text was written in Finnish[[/footnote]]." The mural is located at what is presumed to be the main entrance of SCP-2919. The function SCP-2919 served when it was in in use is unknown.

SCP-2919-1 instances are Caucasian males of varying height and apparent biological age. Each instance wears a white metal helmet that extends to cover the shoulders, upper chest, and the head. A cylinder approximately 1 meter in length with a rounded end protrudes from the middle of the front of the helmet. On the left side of the cylinder is a rectangular box with a small, square hole on the front of it. On the upper half of the helmet's back is a similar cylinder that is roughly 0.5 meters long. Each instance is clad in a long-sleeved shirt, trousers, and a belt. SCP-2919-1 instances do not have difficulty with movement, despite the shape of the helmet. SCP-2919-1 instances have posts, which are positions they stay at in each entrance to SCP-2919. When nobody is attempting to enter SCP-2919, instances will sit or stand at their posts. Every 6 hours SCP-2919-1 instances will leave their post and enter SCP-2919, with other SCP-2919-1 instances leaving SCP-2919 and replacing them at their post. SCP-2919-1 instances are conversant in Swedish, Finnish, Danish, Norwegian, Russian, and English.

SCP-2919-1 instances will actively prevent humans from entering SCP-2919 via the use of verbal commands. Non-compliance will result in escalating use of force, terminating in the use of what appears to be the generation of localized gravitational distortions to remove individuals from the premises of SCP-2919. The distortions can be generated within a radius of 4 meters around the instance. SCP-2919-1 instances will also use said gravitational distortions as a form of self defense, via physically repelling attackers and deflecting or neutralizing projectiles fired in its direction. 

Current observations have shown them not to be hostile without provocation. So far only three subjects have been killed by SCP-2919-1 instances, due to gravitational distortions appearing on or in their body after attempted attacks by the subjects. Further details are in Document 2919-D7. This is believed to be caused by attempts by the SCP-2919-1 instances to relocate the subjects, and was unintentional. These abilities have prevented the capture and study of SCP-2919-1 instances. This has also prevented any exploration of SCP-2919.

**Addendum-2:** On █/██/████ at 10:54 am, an SCP-2919-1 instance (named SCP-2919-1V for the autopsy log) began to spasm and subsequently collapsed. Three minutes later, another SCP-2919-1 instance emerged from SCP-2919 and took its place at its post, ignoring the collapsed instance. SCP-2919-1V was able to be retrieved with no complications arising. After confirmation that the instance was dead, an autopsy was performed on the corpse.

The helmet is composed of stainless steel, painted in white. The helmet contained differentiated biological tissue connected to multiple electronic components, grafted to a series of metal struts. In the center of the helmet is a brain, which many of the electronic components are connected to. The tissue resembles organs that have been found in other anomalous beings, such as [REDACTED]. It is currently unknown what purpose the organs served. It is theorized that they were able to generate an alternating current of a constant voltage to power the electronic components, and process glucose and other nutrients for the body via ██████. The helmet is connected to the rest of the body's skeletal system, and cannot be removed without causing a collapse of the spine and chest. The number "KU-21" has been tattooed above the naval. The rest of the body and its attire showed no abnormalities.

During the autopsy the instance was surrounded by a gravitational lensing effect[[footnote]] A visual effect caused by the bending of light around large gravity source. This is commonly observed in space when light from a distant source is bent around a cluster of galaxies.[[/footnote]], and subsequently vanished along with the autopsy table and various instruments. Sensors picked up a large spatial and gravitational distortion in the area when this occurred, which pulled the instruments towards SCP-2919-1V's body. A hole was reported appearing in the lens, which led to a dark, gray area. The body and the equipment have not been found.

**Addendum-3:**

[[collapsible show="+ Exploration Log 2919" hide="- Exploration Log 2919"]]
> **Foreword:** Experimentation with interactions between SCP-2919-1 instances and machinery have determined that small robotics and machinery are largely ignored. Horus Camera Drone H765 (1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm) was attached to an SCP-2919-1 instance (named SCP-2919-1U) on the front of its helmet. After 2 hours at 6:00 PM, SCP-2919-1U left its post and entered the building. The following is a transcript of what H765 recorded inside SCP-2919 before the signal was lost. Further explorations are planned.
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> SCP-2919-1U walks towards a series of doors. These doors open on their own, presumably caused by SCP-2919-1U's gravitational distortions. It enters through them and begins walking down a long hallway. The hallway has various exits along the walls, presumably leading to other segments of SCP-2919. The walls are less worn than the outside of SCP-2919. Despite the apparent age of SCP-2919, lights inside the building are still operational, suggesting there is a running source of electricity. The end of the hallway splits off into two corridors, with a door in the middle. Next to the door is a bulletin board, with a map and other documents on it (further details are in Addendum-4).
> 
> The door leads to a stairwell, which appears to have been designed to accommodate the helmet shape of SCP-2919-1 instances. SCP-2919-1U descends down this stairwell for several minutes. The stairwell leads to a catwalk above a large room, with various other catwalks near the upper area of it. On the catwalk floor is wrinkled poster. The poster has a gray silhouette of a person wearing black shades, on top of an orange background. A caption underneath says, "If you see someone wearing glasses, ask them to remove them! They might be CONSTRUCTED![[footnote]] This and all other text seen in SCP-2919 has been translated from Finnish to English.[[/footnote]]" SCP-2919-1U walks down the catwalk for two minutes before reaching a set of stairs at the end of it.
> 
> As SCP-2919-1U walks down the stairs at the end of the catwalk, H765 is able to see more of the room. This area has various deactivated conveyor belts and machinery that appear to have been assembling SCP-2919-1 helmets. Metal vats are attached to the walls, some of which have fallen off and spilled blood and organs on the floor. These organs resemble the ones found in SCP-2919-1V's helmet. Several SCP-2919-1 instances are patrolling this area. Much of the machinery is either in a state of disrepair or broken entirely. On the floor are two documents (detailed further in Addendum-4) and the back of a human body protruding from the floor, as if submerged. On the wall is a propaganda poster, depicting a soldier planting the Kalmar Union flag into a cracked outline resembling the United States of America. The outline has the Great Seal of the United States in the center. The caption says "We beat the States, and we can beat the communists too!" SCP-2919-1U goes through a set of metal doors into another room similar to the previous one. At this point connection with H765 is lost for one minute.
> 
> Upon connection with H765 being restored, SCP-2919-1U enters an elevator, and turns around to face the doors. The elevator's walls and doors are made of glass, allowing a view of a tall metal chamber. Inside the chamber is an object resembling an enlarged version of an SCP-2919-1 helmet, with various electronics and machinery connected to it. At the top of the chamber is a broken window, which leads into an unknown area. The elevator descends below the chamber, and only shows concrete. Connection to H765 begins to decrease. 
> 
> The doors open to reveal a large gray cylindrical room. In the center of it is a metal ring that is connected to the floor and ceiling with rods. A machine is in the center of the ring, with wires and tubes connecting to the inside of the ring. Along the sides of the ring are 20 naked human bodies, all of which are headless and have tubes extended from their necks to the ceiling. Some of the bodies are in a state of decay, while others appear healthy. One of the bodies has been segmented diagonally from its right shoulder to the left side of its hip, while another one appears to have been exploded from the inside. Decayed organs, dried blood stains, and broken glass are visible on the floor. At random intervals one of the bodies spasms (including the decayed and heavily damaged ones). The letters "KU2-S" can be seen on the chest of each body. Various organs been assembled into the words (in Finnish) "DID I SAVE YOU?" on the ground. On the wall the words (also in Finnish) "PLEASE TALK TO ME" can be seen, having been written in blood. As SCP-2919-1U approaches the center of the room H765's signal is lost.

> 
> End of Week Report - 21/10/1979
> 
> This has been a week of great progress for Project Dažbog. Our engineers have put the finishing touches on the construction systems, which have produced 11 new Karewit Units in a single day. The organ construction cells are healthy, though at times the organ production has gotten out of control. Four days ago one of our growth vats broke apart after rapid organ growth pushed too hard against the vat's walls. Even during the cleanup operation the cells were still attempting to construct more organs. However, this is believed to be a freak incident, and is unlikely to happen again. However, we have added a system to our vats that will get rid of unneeded organs if too many grow.
> 
> Karewit-U2 continues to grow stronger. In one experiment KU2 was able to hold a 3 m x 4 m x 3.5 m rock in the air for approximately 2 minutes outside Facility 63, better than it has ever done so far. Other tests have shown that KU2 can now manipulate gravity anywhere within Facility 63. If we are able to keep KU2 in this state for a long period of time, the next year might see militarization of KU2. However, its personality is still that of a child. It is unknown why this is, considering the brain size and augments. At some point next week we will look into this further. Currently this seems to have no negative side effects.
> 
> The biggest advancement we've made so far happened during testing of a Karewit Unit. While testing how many objects can be manipulated at once, the unit vanished and reappeared several meters away. This means we can create artificial wormholes with the units, though we don't know how this works. This discovery has been made today, so little testing has been performed, but research will be continued on this next week.
> 
> Lastly, the Democratic Council has agreed on giving us more money for our research. With the increasingly difficult war against Mekhantos, they want us to finalize our Karewit Units soon. However, this will not override any planned projects and experiments for next week, as the Karewit Units are close to being finished. Hopefully next week brings further progress.

> vanished after the transport, with the cord sliced in half. Footage from the Unit only showed static and a blue sky. One researcher who went through with a Unit, Dr. Cai Egil, claims he saw another world for a brief second, though he can't give any specific details about it. Based on other footage taken by units, it is theorized that the wormhole passes through another dimension, then reenters into ours. While this opens up many possibilities, wormhole transportation is very dangerous. One Unit ended up inside a wall after transporting itself, with parts of its body filled with concrete. The only reason we knew where it went was when we saw its hand sticking out of a wall a few hours later, twitching. It is unknown where the rest of the concrete was displaced to. I hope that our missing scientists haven't suffered the same fate.
> 
> Due to these dangers related to wormholes, there is worry that KU2 will be able to do the same thing, but on a larger scale. After having studied on how the wormhole creation is performed, our engineers have developed an inhibitor that prevents this from happening. We have also had to call off any further testing on the wormholes, due to the escalated tensions on the border and government worries. Karewit Units are currently being produced at the fastest rate possible right now. Hopefully we will live to see further developments next week.

They can't be allowed to learn.//

> This is written description of a map seen on the bulletin board in SCP-2919.
> 
> The map is titled "Map of the Modern World - 1975." Various countries are depicted in the colors blue, red, and gray. A legend on the map says "Blue: Capitalist and Allied Nations, Red: Communist Territory, Gray: Neutral, Yellow: Old Government Territory, Bronze: Mekhantos, Black: Lost" The countries on the map are very different than maps made during the Cold War. Some major differences include North America being composed of ten countries, ranging in size. Three of the western countries are colored in red, with a majority in blue. Cuba and most of Central America are blue. The countries in South America are a mix of blue, red, and gray, with a resemblance to Cold War South America. The only major difference is that Chile is smaller in size, and that Brazil is two countries, one blue and the other red.
> 
> Africa and the Middle East remain fairly unchanged, with slightly different borders. On the west coast of Africa is a small yellow country, which is the only country colored in yellow. In Europe, Italy isn't a single country, and is made up of various smaller ones. Portugal and Spain are both one country. Sweden, Finland, Norway, and presumably Norway's overseas territories are also one nation. What is presumed to be the Soviet Union extends up to its 1945 borders. Asia (including Japan) is predominantly red, though what is believed to be China is blue and smaller in size. In the South Atlantic Ocean is a bronze circle roughly the size of Brazil. Four smaller bronze circles are in the Pacific Ocean. Greenland is the only area of the map that is colored black.
