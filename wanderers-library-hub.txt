The Wanderer's Library is the hub of all knowledge throughout every universe and dimension. Its endless halls carry every book that has or ever will be written (and several that won't). Scholars from worlds unknown stalk its aisles and trash bins for forbidden knowledge. It would take several lifetimes to read the contents of even one shelf in the Library.

++++ //What is a Library?//
[[<]]

It's a lot more than a man-made structure full of books. It can be eclectic collections of all assortment and mannerisms. Arcane knowledge and cookbooks deserve to sit side-by-side, but they are nothing without readers. Without a head to sit in writing is just the pretension of abstract shapes seeking meaning.

Ultimately, libraries are those groups treasuring what little anyone can truly know.

In my younger days, I failed to accomplish my dream. Becoming a library unto myself, seizing all which could be known and fitting it within my own person. Despite my best intentions I've snuffed out the life of more ideas than any Bookburner could ever dream of incinerating.

Unleashing the damnation of fire and forgetting on so many of my fellow patrons is my penultimate regret, before allowing hubris to make me who I am today. So as you browse all the knowledge you could possibly ask for there must always be that voice whispering in your ear to remind you that mortality is a virtue.

Let the Library be the one which keeps all that which cannot be remembered. Else then you may never be able to forget.

[[<]]
Well, you're standing in it. Go ahead and gawk. Everyone does, their first time. Don't worry, the shelves aren't going to fall down anytime this century. It just feels like it because they're so high and narrow. The Library is... I suppose the best way to describe it would be a hub. Kind of like this hub, except instead for worlds. The Library is at the root of every world, universe, and timeline that has ever existed, or will ever exist. You guys have that saying, right? "All roads lead to Rome"? Yeah, it's kind of like that. No matter where you are in reality (or sometimes out of it), you can always find a way back here. Get it? A Way?

Oh. Man, they don't even tell you what Ways are anymore? Alright, well, a Way is a kind of wormhole -- the labcoated fucks at the Foundation probably have some technojargon name for it, but we call them what they are - Ways. Of course, all Ways have Knocks -- a kind of trick to get in. There's one in New York where you have to pour chicken blood over a manhole. This one's easy, though. You just need someone who's been inside to invite you. So long as I'm here, you can get though. Next time, you can let yourself in.

Yeah, go ahead. Of course you can read them, don't be stupid. Be a pretty shit library if you couldn't read the books, right? But you won't be able to read all of them, so don't bother trying. I know guys who have spent lifetimes trying to complete just one shelf. And there are countless shelves in the Library -- that's not an expression. As far as we know, the place is quite literally infinite, in every direction. At night, try looking up -- you can see the stars. Sometimes you come across entire clouds forming at the tops of shelves. Don't ask me where the light comes from -- I couldn't tell you. Matter of fact, there's a lot about this place nobody knows. Nobody knows when it was founded; it just seems to have always been here. Nobody knows where the books come from; they just appear. And, of course, nobody knows who created it, if anyone.

Well, nobody who can talk knows. Maybe the Librarians do.

Oh, right. See that tall cloaked guy, with the lantern? Don't stare, it's not polite. Yeah, he has no mouth.

You can only find them at the front desk - they're the ones without eyes. That doesn't stop them from knowing where every book is at any given time, though. If you want to check out, you'll need this card to show them. Hold onto the card, by the way. It can act as your ID in a lot of places. And if someone else gets ahold of it, they own you. Another thing to remember -- always return your books on time. You don't wanna know what happens to overdues.

We're in the main hall right now -- it's a bit emptier this hour, only a hundred people or so. It looks cozy, but don't be fooled - space in here is.... weird. It can expand to fit more people without changing dimensions. It's hard to explain, but you'll see. Feel free to grab a desk or seat and just start, y'know, reading. Everything is shared property in here; we're all Wanderers in spirit. I think there's an [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/orientation Orientation] happening in a little while, might wanna hit that up.

[[tab An Overview of the Wanderers Library]]
[[<]]
The Wanderer's Library is a writing community spun off from the SCP Universe almost a decade ago by two SCP administrators. It remains as the only official SCP sister site. It's a collection of stories that explore strange and fantastic corners of the world, hidden from ordinary eyes. Some of the stories take place in the distant past, taking the form of legends and fables. Others are from the modern day, hiding in the shadows just out of sight. The basic premise is that there are strange things that are not quite of our world. Some are dangerous, some are merely fascinating. They are all in some respect extraordinary.

Unlike SCP, Wanderer's Library stories have no set format; entries, as they are called, can be prose, epistolary, multimedia, or anything else you can dream up. The genre is similarly fluid -- we have everything from high fantasy to urban horror. The only consistent theme, if there is one, is that stories in the Library should try to evoke a Sense of Wonder, a sense that there is a larger world beyond the one we know. In the world of the Library, these wonders are hidden, but never truly far away. But never forget that this is a wilder world than our own, and it's never entirely safe, either.

The Library's contents are a sort of Venn diagram with the larger SCPverse. Entries are free to be set in the larger universe, and use Groups of Interest or characters from the universe at large, but standalone works in their own universes or worlds are also perfectly fine -- indeed, the majority of entries are of the latter sort. **Reading works on the site is the single best way to get a feel for the tone.**

The Planasthai is a weekly news magazine that has circulated in at least ten different formats under dozens of different names and has won scores of accolades. The hundreds of editors that guided the publications to billions of ocular receptors took great pride in the job of honest thorough reporting. Readers clung to its wisdom and enjoyed its vaguely melony scent. The publication performed numerous inventive duties not envisioned by the editorial staff (ex: birdcage lining). Planasthai's motto "Sunlight clears the rot" has adorned everything from t-shirts to treaties, always with love and reverence. However, the once sterling reputation of Planasthai has been tarnished in recent years due to poor oversight, unsavory editorial decisions and losses of ad revenue.

+++ [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/serpents-hand The Serpent's Hand]

The relationship between the Library and the Serpent's Hand is one riddled with misconceptions and misinformation. The Library is not the exclusive domain of the Hand, nor do they control it in any way. The Serpent's Hand are just one of the multitudes of organizations dedicated to scholarly pursuits and freedom of knowledge that choose to call the Library home. That said, the Serpent's Hand are unique among these groups for their history with the Library; the original Hand of the Serpent was a school of warrior-monks living in the Shelves, dedicated to the defense of knowledge. Their exact fate is unknown, but it is generally accepted that sometime in the 20th century, several young thaumaturges from Earth accidentally opened a Way and discovered the Library, along with the ruins of the Hand's temple. They adopted the moniker and idealogy, becoming a militant force in the fight for liberty of the anomalous and rapidly expanding in size, ranks bolstered by young idealists and revolutionaries.

The modern Serpent's Hand is a decentralized movement -- it operates in discrete cells, with the only governing structure being L.S, an individual of unclear origins and description who is recognized by all cells of any influence to be the closest thing to a de facto leader of the group. There are no requirements for forming a cell or becoming a member of the Hand; anyone who wishes to join need only consider themself a member, and that is enough. A new member who utters the Serpent's Creed in the Library can expect a quick welcoming visit from L.S to show them the ropes; how they know when this occurs is unknown.

Further information about the Serpent's Hand is available [http://www.scp-wiki.net/serpent-s-hand-hub here.]

+++ The Neverwere

There are things that are older, more dangerous, and more terrible than anything that exists, and those are things that never did exist, and never will exist, and don't exist. But they want to. We call these beings the Neverwere. They drift in the hidden corners of places, always just out of sight, "made up remnants of forgotten stories, lost epics, and abandoned dreams."

In the ancient times, the Ways were bright and clear as far as you could see, with fruit trees offering a bounty to travelers in exchange for legends of their worlds. However, as more and more people dreamed and lost, told stories that were forgotten, and died without ever knowing themselves, the Ways grew darker and darker, and then, it is claimed, the Neverwere appeared. Others claim that the Neverwere are merely the souls of those who honored dead gods, searching for a chance to call upon another for salvation, while others still say they are merely figments of the imagination given elementary form and body by the Ways.

At any rate, travelers of the Ways began to vanish, and beings started to appear that should not have existed. A fully realized Neverwere has not been seen in millennia, though, as they also prey on each other. One achieving existence is normally devoured by its kin almost instantly.

----

+++ The Daeva

It is suspected that at some point, the Daeva were wanderers themselves, the cast-off leavings of another world that had died on some catastrophe or another, and that some of them reached the Library at its founding, as the Tale of Cornerstone confirms. However, at some point, they left the realities forever, leaving behind a book. Unfortunately, this is not something that can be easily or simply verified, due to the very nature of the Daeva themselves.

The Daeva occupy a text which is continually in the process of writing itself. As it continues, references to it appear in other volumes, though they do not appear in the memories of those old enough to remember the events themselves. What is truly confounding is that the evidence of the Daeva appears to be writing itself into history as the volume continues to be written. Therefore, while texts mention them as wanderers from another world, there is no way to be certain.

What is certainly known is that the Daeva have a vendetta against the Library for reasons unknown, though it has been theorized that something about the magic of the place possibly threw them into their current condition. Various texts have appeared, seemingly at random, telling of wars the Daeva fought against the Library and its denizens, though no record of such a war existed before. Most worrisome is the possibility that these events will suddenly come into existence should the original text become complete.

Everyone knows Cousin Dan. He's a big, burly, friendly giant, a distant cousin from your mother's -- or was it your father's? -- side. He's as American as apple pie and a simple country boy at heart. But, as with every country boy, he's developed a reputation, and sometimes, stories can be larger than life.

> He was as big as a mountain and bright as the sun, and ate like a whole herd o' horses. They say he danced with thunderclouds and talked with the flowers. And he was born to my Uncle Leroy and Aunt Petunia, down in Deadwood Valley, where the dusty flowers grow.
>
> Now, my cousin Dan was born in the middle of a thunderstorm, and the wind outside was the devil's own fury. But when the midwife slapped Dan on his backside, he let out such a howl, the wind plumb got scared an' ran away, and they say it ain't shown its face there since.
>
> He wasn't too big when he was born, no more'n twice the size of a normal baby, but he grew pretty quickly. By the time he was five, he was as tall as the day is long, and a few inches more besides.

A ten volume series of tomes written in nearly a dozen languages, this series was begun as the repository of magical knowledge of Roxana the Helot and Badr al-Rashid ibn Ya'fir ibn Abdulaziz al-Miṣrī. Though the first five volumes were written mostly by these two individuals and their descendants, soon material was introduced by apprentices and other scholars, and the history of the tomes becomes nearly impossible to track. It is of note that there is a significant gap in time between volumes VI and VII, which were written in the early 11th century and 1890, respectively. The books contain alchemical processes, written accounts on contact with supernatural entities, and magic rites and rituals.

An assembled collection on non-corporeal or obscure entities, their properties, and their relationships with various worlds. The volumes constituting it have been contributed to heavily and irregularly since its first publication in 1038 CE, being updated whenever new information becomes relevant. Sources have varied greatly, causing some degree of contradiction: writers have included members of the Catholic and Anglican Churches at alternate stages in their history, early cultists, unaffiliated university scholars, otherworldly immigrants, hermits, and several of the entities of the subject matter themselves.

Most volumes have been heavily annotated and edited by other authors working after the initial publication. Certain Hand members have produced, appended, updated and acted as editors for several of the texts.

The Kingdom of Elrich is the most ancient of all realms found upon the fair isle Elra. 'Tis a silly place, where elevators were invented before stairs, mystical marsupials are a grave threat to the monarchy's integrity, and cabbages have the final say in all matters.

Other kingdoms exist with them, realms such as the Union of the Four Empires, where squabbling co-monarchs have cause their entire realm to be cursed due to grocery-bagging ghost scandals.  Gamenia focuses more on baked goods, and is a place where any croissant can find love. Suvians are renown for their prowess in war, but also have a thriving market for antiques. Those residing on the floating island of Cayle enjoy pineapple heads. Dolton has seen better days.

All of this and more can be explored in the realm of Elrich, more information on it can be found [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/the-world-of-elrich in this magical glowing text].
