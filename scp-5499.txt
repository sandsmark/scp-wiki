**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-XXXX is to be stored, unpowered, in the ████-██ Equipment Storage Wing. Due to the nature of ████-██'s primary project, transfer of SCP-XXXX to a proper containment site has been deemed unfeasible at present.

**Description:** SCP-XXXX is an L7[[footnote]] A Foundation subsidiary dedicated to the production and retail of consumer electronics. [[/footnote]]-Brand Smart Refrigerator, Model 2S. Prior to its installation in the ████-██ Break Room on January 31st, 2005, SCP-XXXX displayed no anomalous properties.

Outside of direct observation, SCP-XXXX is capable of damaging foodstuffs placed within its chassis. Such damages occur in bursts of 1 to 4, typically spaced at least 4 hours apart, and are accompanied by a series of messages played across SCP-XXXX's touchscreen. The process by which SCP-XXXX chooses foodstuff is unknown, although it shows considerable preference towards foodstuffs of sweet and savory flavor profiles.

SCP-XXXX was discovered following a series of complaints to the ████-██ Human Resources Department.
