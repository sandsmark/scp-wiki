title:Reimagining Contest
++ Let's get ready to rummmbblleeeeeeeeeeeee...

By popular demand, a new contest is starting up! The purpose of this contest is to take a classic idea from the site and reimagine it as something new, different, and original! 

++ How does this work?

The idea here is simple. You take anything written on the site from 2011 or earlier, and you reimagine it as something new. You put it into a new format (tale, recovery logs, interviews, experiment logs, [[[GOI Contest 2014|GOI formats]]], or even the SCP format), and you submit it for the contest. 

Note that this isn't just taking [[[SCP-173]]] and writing [[[Crunch]]]. It's even more than turning [[[SCP-173]]] and making [[[Revised Entry]]]. This is taking SCP-173 and thinking "What if it was as big as Rushmore?" or "Why doesn't it play the flute and lure other statues into holes in the side of a hill?" or "What if it was actually a pig-demon?"

You are not rewriting. You are not expanding. You are //reimagining the whole dang concept//.

++ Alright, but... What if I want to take more than one direction?

This contest anticipates -- maybe even hopes -- that you do. There are two options for how to do your contest entry: one single, solid article or a multi-part work.

++ Oh, so that's the weird thing about this one.

Yeah, you got it. It works like this. If you want to just write one, strong reimagined article for the entire contest, then you are totally within your rights to write it, submit it, and still have just as good of a chance of winning as a more expansive article. 

However, if you want to, for example, write up SCP-682 as a nearly indestructible adaptive alien god who hates humanity, but talks like a Power Rangers villain due to improper absorption of our popular culture, then you could write a multi-part entry that would look like: 

> Part #1: The Global Occult Coalition records of an attack by 682 on the United Nations demanding to see the world leader so he can be properly eaten. 
> 
> Part #2: The Black Queen's multiversal catalogue entry, using her GOI format. Shows neo-682's effect on a bunch of different timelines. (Hopefully the theoretical author wouldn't just use this as an excuse to bring in the original 682; that defeats the purpose!)
> 
> Part #3: is a short tale from the POV of 682 herself.

This is completely legal. You can have as many or as few pieces to a multi-part entry as you want. When doing a multi-part entry, to keep the contest running smoothly, please make sure you're using [http://www.wikidot.com/doc-wiki-syntax:layout#tabview a tabbed document] and keep all your entries on a single page.

Note: If you use the SCP format, you need at least three parts to your entry. See Rule #3 below.

++ Can I get some more concept examples?

Here you go (feel free to steal):

[[collapsible show="+ Gimmy da Goodies!" hide="- These were not the goodies I was hoping for..." hideLocation="both"]]

* **SCP-008:** Zombie plague that turns out to be the intended next state of humanity's existence, suppressed by occult organizations up until the present, who passed this duty on to the Foundation.
* **The Broken God:** The shattered remnants of a deity who allowed herself crucified by the dominant religious groups in the universe before this one, so as to allow the creation of Earth. Her bones make up the bones of Earth, and her cults are trying to resurrect her by reinvigorating Earth metals with life force via clockwork shrines that crank out mechanical worship.
* **Profile of The Administrator, Charles Ogden Gears:** An emotionless man who founded the Foundation, after calculating that this was the only way to save the world from inevitable destruction and plunging into chaos. His plan to reshape the world into a mechanical, emotion-free paradise is SCP-001, though he is holding off for now because he wishes to preserve normalcy for as long as possible. SCP-001 will be executed only once the Foundation finally fails (as it must). He is opposed by freedom fighters called the Chaos Insurgency, founded by (a re-imagined) Alto Clef and Kain Pathos Crow. Neither faction are villains.
* **The Serpent's Hand:** Fighting for the rights of all sentient organisms to become sapient and to ascend to the next level of evolution. This may or may not involve literally giving serpents hands.
* **SCP-105:** A girl named Iris who can extract light from photographs and film and analyze its patterns of light on a quantum level. She eventually sees through universes. (Don't steal this one: [[[scp-1465|it's been done already as an SCP]]].)

++ Contest Rules

+ [http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/reimagining-contest/reimagination%20flow%20chart.png CONFUSED ABOUT THE RULES? ESKOBAR WANTS TO HELP. <CLICK ME>]

# One entry per author.
# For the sake of the voting: One page per entry. Use tabviews if necessary.
# You may not have more than one SCP format portion in your entry, and if you use the SCP format at all, you also need at least two other tabs. In other words, you must have at least //three distinct, substantive documents// (three or more tabs total) within your entry in any format **IF** you make use of the SCP format. Relying exclusively on the familiar is discouraged. __If they are found not to have sufficient content, your entry will be disqualified.__ 
# Entries can be as long or as short as you want. However, if you're using the SCP Format, then the other tabs //must// have substantive content.
# No significant edits after the entry has been posted. If you wouldn't do it to someone else's work, don't do it to your own until the contest ends.
# Once your entry is in, it's in. Entries will be subject to the normal deletion process, and authors with failed entries will not get another chance. Make sure your entry is as good as possible before submitting it!
# Entries must be new. You can use some material you've used before, but the bulk of your entry must be new material and ideas created for this contest (on pain of disqualification). It also must be your own idea, not set in someone else's canon.
# No malicious downvoting. This is always a rule, but we mention it here again because contests can get competitive. If you do this, not only will you be disqualified, you may also be banned from the site.
# All entries must be tagged with "rei2015" (Reimagining Contest 2015) in order to be counted.
# Do not post before **February 20th** or after **March 6th**.
# The winner will be determined on **March 10th** and announced the following day. The winners are determined by a combination of rating and judge scoring, with both halves being weighed equally. Judges are chosen from site staff and members anonymously. 

++ Questions
[[collapsible show="+ Display Questions" hide="- Hide Questions" hideLocation="both"]]

**Is it more advantageous to post a single piece, or try to write something as ambitious as possible?**

Neither. A single-piece entry will be easier to pull off, and you'll have much more time to polish it. Same for a few short tabs. And people are much more willing to read something that's shorter.

On the other hand, a massive sprawling 20-tab affair may dazzle people with its impressiveness. But it will be very hard to pull off, and can also end up being too long for people to want to read. It also has an Achilles heel: if just one tab sucks, the whole thing can get downvoted. (That's one reason we're requiring all sub-entries to be on one page.)

**Man. Why are you being such dicks about the SCP Format?**

We expect you to be creative and flexible. If your entry relied on you just reimaging SCP-108 into a pie monster who throw pies and murders babies, and all you wanted to do was write up the SCP, then what are you really accomplishing? Spread your arms and fly, little birds. We have faith in your wings. And even falling is a good experience sometimes.

**Can I keep the original concept a secret?**

No. That's counter to the spirit of the contest. This isn't a competition for how clever one can be with papering over their source material.

**What if we wanna reimagine a central concept written during/before 2011, but had a rewrite after that?**

You can use any of the base concept from during/before 2011. Try to avoid using newer material added on to that specific concept -- otherwise, what's the point? The base concept is fair game.

**Can we tie in any newer stuff?**

Sure, as long as your central concept is based on something that's classic by this contest's standards. Make sure the bulk of the entry qualifies for the contest's standards. **Newer material should be used for ancillary concepts only.**

If you're worried you have too much material based on newer stuff, then write more material based on the older stuff or cut some of the newer stuff out. 

**Do I just have to reimagine SCP articles?**

Nope. Key word: "concept". If you can think of a way to reimagine anything on the wiki from 2011 or before, go for it.

**Can I use the original names/titles/SCP numbers?**

Yes.

**Can I see a list of articles that qualify?**
