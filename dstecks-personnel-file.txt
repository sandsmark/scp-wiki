**Name:** Dr. D█████ Stoeckle, codename "DStecks"
//**Note from O5-█:** Are you serious? His codename is// DStecks//? Does he think he's a [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] rapper? Let me have a look at this file. Looks like it needs some corrections.//
**Position:** Field research, Item acquisition.
**Security Clearance:** Level 2
**History:** A recent hire by the Foundation, Dr. Stoeckle graduated near the top of his class at MIT, but soon found himself confronted by his --antisocial tendencies-- enormous jackassery. While he worked for a time at the Smithsonian Institution, he was quickly fired. --The Smithsonian's personnel records-- Common sense shows that they ultimately decided that his talent was not worth his --inability to work as part of a team-- ego. As a result of his actions, the Smithsonian blacklisted him. He has had similar experiences with every other employer he has worked for, including DARPA, NASA, Microsoft, [DATA EXPUNGED], and Burger King. Thus, only the Foundation will employ him, and as such, he receives --10-- 50% less pay than a normal doctor of his rank.

--Dr. Stoeckle must not, under any circumstances, be assigned to a Mobile Task Force for any reason.-- Rescinded as per approval of P3-EAVESDROP.
