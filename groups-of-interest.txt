title:Groups Of Interest
The Foundation is not the only group with an interest and investment in the paranormal and metaphysical. There are many other groups in existence who possess, use, or attempt to create SCP objects, either for their own personal gain or for the protection of mankind. Some are rival organizations, some are splinter groups of the Foundation, and some are trusted associates of the Foundation. In any case, it has been deemed necessary to create and distribute a brief on what agencies the Foundation knows about, and our stance towards them.

[[toc]]
++ The Amethyst Charity

Close to Nothing is known about the Amethyst Charity, only that it is somehow connected to SCP-2122 and Prometheus Labs Inc. There are no other subjects related to The Amethyst Charity that the Foundation knows about.   

++ Alexylva University

Very little is known about Alexylva University or its motives. Evidence appears to suggest that the organization exists in some sort of alternate universe in which Latin and Greek cultures maintain dominance at least over the Western Hemisphere; nothing to date is known about any other part of this world. All University-related objects have been found in the Mid-Southern United States, and more specifically in Tennessee, leading Foundation researchers to believe the University itself is located in that geographical area. 

Many objects associated with the University (which is not believed to have built the objects) are recovered during postal transit via an agency known as "Phitransimun Combine" and accompanied by relevant paperwork, which has helped shed light on the objects and the place from which they came. To date, all that is known about the methods that transfer the objects is that the technology uses principles similar to that of the Einstein-Rosen Bridge, a concept considered purely theoretical by contemporary science. A particular section of the University known as the Department of Natural Philosophy is considered responsible for the transferences, possibly without the knowledge or consent of the rest of the organization. 

Catalogued SCPs relevant to Alexylva University include [[[SCP-877]]], [[[SCP-961]]], [[[SCP-1043]]], [[[SCP-1080]]], [[[SCP-1081]]], [[[SCP-1083]]], [[[SCP-1546]]], and [[[SCP-1998]]]. To see all documents tagged with //alexylva//, [/system:page-tags/tag/alexylva click here].

++ Are We Cool Yet?

A collective of "art terrorists", the members of Are We Cool Yet? are capable of either obtaining or producing anomalous objects and entities, and using them to create art installations. These installations are placed for maximum public exposure, and are often -- but not always -- fatal to bystanders; the phrase "Are We Cool Yet?" is always present in some way.

++ The Black Queen

Very little conclusive information has been recovered about the person of interest called the Black Queen. All reports claim that she is a woman named Alison Chao, daughter of researcher Dr. ██████ Gears and ██████ ███ Chao before Gears' recruitment by the Foundation. She is highly intelligent, highly driven, and possesses extensive knowledge of Foundation structure, activities, and contained items. She has repeatedly been able to breach Foundation security. There are reports of her involvement with almost every major Group of Interest known to the Foundation, along with many local governments and most world governments.

Conflicting reports exist of the Black Queen's activities and motivations. In some reports, she is said to be highly malevolent, murderous, and destructive. In other reports, she is said to be more benevolent, assisting Foundation endeavors in secret as often as she opposes them (as with "Nobody"). Regardless, due to her major security breaches, she is considered extremely dangerous.

Certain sources claim that the Black Queen is the same individual as L.S. of the Serpent's Hand, and that L.S. stands for "Little Sister". These sources claim either that the Black Queen is benevolent towards the Hand in her role as L.S., or that she is simply manipulating them more directly than other groups. None of this information has been verified.

A few reports claim that the Black Queen is in contact with extra-universal individuals who also call themselves the Black Queen. These reports claim that "Little Sister" is a code name the Queens created to use amongst themselves, and that they cooperate and share information when it suits their goals. It is not known to what extent these reports hold any truth.

++ The Chaos Insurgency

The Chaos Insurgency is a splinter group of the Foundation, created by a rogue cell that went A.W.O.L. with several highly useful SCPs in 1924. Since then, the Insurgency has become a major player on the world stage, using the SCPs that it obtains for its own personal benefit and to consolidate its global power base. The Insurgency not only deals in SCPs, but also in weapons running and intelligence gathering.

It makes use of dictator regimes in Third World countries, often using their populations in the same manner as the Foundation does D-Class personnel. Because of this, it helps to maintain the extreme poverty and war that is suffered by these countries, so that it can continue its radical experimentation, easy conscription of forces, and lucrative business deals with rebel factions.

Most of the SCPs possessed by the Insurgency are unknown, but of those that are known, the most notable are the "Staff of Hermes", an item capable of warping the physical and chemical properties of any matter it touches, and the "Bell of Entropy", an object that can cause a variety of destructive effects depending on where it is struck. Both of these SCPs were originally obtained at no small cost by the Foundation, and were stolen by the original founders of the Insurgency. The Insurgency also has a known association with [[[SCP-355]]] and [[[SCP-884]]].

The main base of operations of the Insurgency is unknown, as are its leaders. This organization is directly antagonistic to the Foundation, coming to clash over SCP items several times. Personnel are made to be aware of possible raids, terrorist attempts, and spies from the Insurgency, and to notify command about any strange behavior of fellow personnel.

++ The Church of the Broken God

Shortly after the discovery and containment of [[[SCP-882]]], several members of this "church" came forward and demanded the return of "the heart of god".  Led by one Robert Bumaro, they are a group of zealots, believing many of the SCP items to be parts of a "god" that was broken after the creation of the universe. By restoring it to its whole state, they will also gain godhood. Since first contact, three other key components of the "god" have also been tentatively identified: [[[SCP-217]]], [[[SCP-271]]] and [[[SCP-1139]]]. A sect dedicated to the Church built [[[SCP-808]]].

They are extremely hostile to Foundation operatives, branding them "heretics", and will attempt to kill operatives and break containment of SCP items.  It is unknown how they are able to detect these items, but they have shown their ability to do so with frightening accuracy.  In addition, they have shown a remarkable ability to resist the mental effects of SCP items, notably [[[SCP-882]]] and its "mental lure".

The Church is viewed as a threat to both the Foundation and SCP.  Members are to be detained by force, or eliminated by whatever means deemed necessary by Foundation agents.

++ Doctor Wondertainment

It is unknown whether Doctor Wondertainment is an individual or an organization. All that is known is that Doctor Wondertainment is capable of producing anomalous artifacts and entities which thematically resemble children's toys.

Links to the Factory have been speculated but are unconfirmed.

++ The Factory

Little is known about The Factory, except that they seem capable of manufacturing anomalous artifacts -- and that they use mass-production techniques to do so.

++ The Fifth Church

//"This church is to other churches what clowns are to people. There are some superficial similarities, but all the wrong things are being emphasized and exaggerated so you can't quite put your finger on what is wrong. . . Sure, it isn't out to get you, but what does it mean? Why is it there? What happens if it calls to you?"// --Dr. █████

The Fifth Church, also known as the Church of Fifthism or the Fifthist Fellowship, is a highly secretive religious organization which possesses ties throughout the entertainment industry. Despite repeated investigations, culminating in the 2007 nationwide sting known as "Operation Stargazer", no further details regarding its doctrines, its practices, its number of members, or its goals have been confirmed, although a watchlist is maintained of 100 confirmed and suspected Fifthist celebrities and other prominent personalities. Its origins have been placed in varying points in the mid-20th Century and various locations in North America and Asia, but some sources have dated it to centuries earlier.

The Fifth Church has never communicated directly with the SCP Foundation, but is to be considered a hostile force.

Objects attributed to this group which are currently under Foundation custody include [[[SCP-1523]]], [[[SCP-1982]]], [[[SCP-1724]]], and [[[SCP-1425]]]. To see all documents tagged with //fifthist//, [/system:page-tags/tag/fifthist click here].

++ [http://www.scp-wiki.net/goc-hub-page The Global Occult Coalition (GOC)]
The GOC was created in the aftermath of WWII, from the remnants of defecting occultists, psychics, priests, and scientists from Nazi, Soviet, and Allied states, brought together and formed by the Allies. As the world stage broadened, so too did the number of countries that had their hands in the GOC, until it became what it is today.

The GOC are a largely political force, seeing themselves as the police of the paranormal world. They pride themselves on destroying supernatural entities, and make use of the most high-tech experimental technology possible, obtained from their benefactors. Many potential SCPs have been destroyed by them before the Foundation could obtain and contain them.

They have been both on the side of the Foundation and against it at times, depending on the situation. They largely hold the Foundation in contempt for their use and containment of SCP items rather than their out-and-out destruction. The GOC has respected the Foundation's formidable might enough to leave it mostly alone, although there have been some questionable incidents with which the GOC have strictly denied involvement.

Agents of the GOC are to be treated with suspicion.

The GOC are known to have involved themselves with [[[SCP-1609]]] and [[[SCP-1899]]]. To see all documents tagged with //global-occult-coalition//, [/system:page-tags/tag/global-occult-coalition click here].

++ GRU Division "P"

Originally known as the ЧД АКН ("ChD AKN", or Fourth Department Abnormal Occurrences Commission), it was established in early 1935 by direct decree of J. V. Stalin, its first task being the investigation of the murder of S. M. Kirov.

During WWII, the Commission expanded into newly reorganized GRU as Division "P" - Psychotronics, working to counteract anomalous threats from the SS, Ahnenerbe, and the Vatican, and to capture and study anomalous artifacts both home and abroad for the benefit of the Soviet government. Division "P" has carried on with this role throughout the Cold War, making Foundation operations in the countries of the Comintern difficult.

After 1991, rapid restructuring, coupled with budget cuts and the decommissioning or sale of significant assets, resulted in numerous defections of their personnel (A significant proportion of both Chaos Insurgency and MC&D operatives in Eastern Europe originated from GRU Division "P" ranks) and the flooding of the European black market with anomalous items formerly in their possession. Currently, this Group of Interest poses little direct threat to the Foundation.

Objects associated with GRU Division "P" are [[[SCP-1011]]], [[[SCP-1723]]] and [[[SCP-1232]]]. To see all documents tagged with //gru-division-p//, [/system:page-tags/tag/gru-division-p click here].

++ Herman Fuller's Circus of the Disquieting

Herman Fuller's Circus of the Disquieting is purported to be a circus of anomalous origin and purpose. Currently, there is no evidence that this group exists beyond the allegations of various sapient SCPs and a handful of damaged non-anomalous artifacts. Most instances of related objects typified by humanoid status are physically mutilated in some way, such as [[[SCP-1884]]] and [[[SCP-1860]]]. Others appear to be typical fairground //objets d'art//, such as [[[SCP-1921]]], or take the form of 'attractions' for the show, such as [[[SCP-1956]]] or [[[SCP-1931]]]. Typically, objects related to Herman Fuller's Circus of the Disquieting are found at fairgrounds where the show is said to have 'performed.'

++ The Horizon Initiative 

The Horizon Initiative is an organization created in the late 1960s by various influential sects in the main three Abrahamic religions as a response to the growing number of anomalous activities and groups which they perceived as threats. Though the full extent of their goals is uncertain, the Horizon Initiative is known to target SCP objects, either with the intention of retrieving or destroying them, depending on each item's perceived place in their dogma.

The Initiative is led by a tribunal composed of leaders from the three largest sects involved in its creation, though a large amount of internal strife often leaves the official leadership in less than full control of the organization. The HI's main combat force, Project Malleus, is generally deployed in anti-cult operations and in SCP retrieval operations.

The Initiative's relations with most other Groups of Interest and the Foundation seems to be in a state of constant flux; while all parts of the HI perceive the Church of the Broken God and Fifth Church with a great degree of hostility (and at times engaging them in armed conflict), sentiments toward the Foundation and the GOC vary greatly, from open hostility to a limited willingness to cooperate, depending on the internal affiliation of individual members.

++ Manna Charitable Foundation

Established in 1971 as an interfaith humanitarian relief agency, recovered documents describe the Manna Charitable Foundation's mission as "sharing all of God's miracles with the least of His children". Funded indirectly through associations with various charitable groups and religious organizations, and on occasion publicly endorsed by wealthy philanthropists or academic institutions, the MCF's primary agenda since its founding has been the free distribution of anomalous objects, or their by-products, to civilians living in poverty-stricken regions in the Third World or in areas afflicted by warfare, famine, or natural disaster.

The MCF is currently recognized as a non-governmental organization by the United Nations, and is known to operate legally and illegally in several hostile or isolated regions outside the Foundation's sphere of influence. While no SCP objects known to have been distributed by the MCF to date have caused intentional harm to human beings or communities (and detained MCF operatives tend to demonstrate strong pacifist beliefs), containment breaches associated with the group have often resulted in human casualties or severe threats to the global status quo due to unforeseen consequences of the object's release from containment, and/or a zeal to distribute potentially "helpful" objects immediately without rigorous scientific study of their long-term behavior.

Objects known to be associated with the Manna Charitable Foundation include [[[SCP-1135]]], [[[SCP-1176]]], and [[[SCP-1615]]]. To see all documents tagged with //manna-charitable-foundation//, [/system:page-tags/tag/manna-charitable-foundation click here].

++ Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd.

A “club” based in London, England.  Catering to the super-rich and with extensive political and financial ties worldwide, this group has caused extensive problems for the Foundation.  Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. is known for collecting rare and obscure items, along with providing its members the most exclusive, expensive, and rare experiences available.

These activities have resulted in conflict with the Foundation on numerous occasions.  The group is not known for the use of force; they prefer to apply extreme financial and political pressure to achieve their goals.  When forced to use more direct means, Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. employs outside agents, and it is very difficult to connect said agents to the organization.

Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. has caused several SCP containment breaches, primarily through the use of money or social pressure.  Several reports, records, and even items have been leaked by Foundation personnel who had been approached with large amounts of money, or threats of extensive jail time or torture.  Notably, two containment sites were almost brought to public attention after the Foundation refused access to members of Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd.

Information pertaining to Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd., such as the name of the director or even a list of members, has proven very difficult to acquire.  Agents encountering members of this group are advised to maintain a cover story and not, for any reason, reveal Foundation ties or SCP information.

++ "Nobody"

Little is currently known about the person, entity, or group known as "Nobody".  First sighted in 1954, they have had numerous appearances since.  There has only been one person seen at any given time, typically described as a male Caucasian dressed in a grey suit and a fedora.  If asked his identity, he replies that he's "Nobody".  However, it is not known if this is the work of a single person or multiple agents of a single, unknown agency.  Their agenda is currently unknown, sometimes helping the Foundation, sometimes hindering it.  Caution is recommended if any field agents encounter an operative identifying themselves as "Nobody".

++ Office For The Reclamation of Islamic Artifacts (ORIA)
The Office For The Reclamation of Islamic Artifacts (ORIA) is a paramilitary force, answerable only to the Supreme Leader of Iran, dedicated to the collection and utilization of anomalous artifacts throughout the Middle East and Central Asia. Following the 1979 overthrow of the Imperial Iranian government by revolutionary forces, and subsequent creation of the Islamic Republic of Iran, all Foundation personnel were expelled from Iran as "agents of colonialism." Attempts at maintaining a clandestine presence in the country met with failure, with the majority of Foundation personnel either captured or killed and Sites ██, ███, and ███ being captured by Iranian forces. To prevent Iran from being left behind in the field of extranormal research, the ORIA was created by a secret decree of Supreme Leader Khomeini in 1981. Despite its name, the group has not limited itself to the pursuit of anomalous objects of Islamic origin.

Although the ORIA has access to considerable resources, its effectiveness is hobbled by infighting among numerous factions within the organization. Some of these disputes center around philosophical differences, such as the weaponization of anomalous objects, while others appear to be personal in nature. The proliferation of factions appears to have been intentional, as the organization of the ORIA often leaves multiple commanders with overlapping areas of responsibility. It is theorized that the reasoning behind this arrangement was to prevent any one individual from accumulating enough power to pose a challenge to the Supreme Leader.

With the spread of Iranian hegemony throughout the Middle East and Western Asia, the ORIA has expanded its reach across the region, becoming the foremost paranormal organization in the Middle East. The ORIA is to be considered a hostile force, and Foundation personnel are advised to use extreme caution when engaging.

++ Oneiroi Collective

Information about the Oneiroi Collective has come to the Foundation only through interviews with the persons who have come across it, and the anomalous objects they leave behind. It is unknown whether any individuals are 'members' of the collective, or if it exists as one whole outside the Foundation's perception of reality. Researchers have theorized that the Oneiroi Collective may be a self-aware dream that works to deliver impermanent dreams to the more permanent reality.

It is rumored that certain Foundation employees believe to have been visited in their dreams by shapes and lights, pleading with them to use their influence or responsibilities to assist the Collective. All of these personnel have undergone amnestic treatment after being interviewed.

Intelligence has shown that they have been documented by other Groups of Interest, usually to a degree similar to the Foundation's interaction. The Oneiroi Collective is apparently capable of contacting even highly isolated entities (e.g. Nobody). The only Group of Interest noted to have antagonistic interactions with the Collective is the Factory, but the reason for this is unknown.

Documents related to the Oneiroi Collective include [[[SCP-2805]]], [[[SCP-2028]]], and [[[SCP-2272]]].

++ Prometheus Labs, Inc.

Prometheus Labs was founded by ██████ ██████ in 1892 as a scientific research and development corporation based in [DATA EXPUNGED] who had over the years developed several potentially marketable products of a preternatural quality.

Prometheus Labs was regarded as a profit organization claiming to "develop technology and tools that will aid humanity to surmount the so-far extrinsic realm of the paranormal". Despite posing no direct threat to the Foundation, Prometheus Labs was relatively reckless in their regimens and refused the Foundation's recommendation of special containment procedures for certain products that would warrant them.

On 01/09/98, one of Prometheus Labs' projects, [DATA EXPUNGED], resulting in the annihilation of their base facility. In the aftermath, the Foundation swept over Prometheus Labs' ground zero and recovered several surviving products and personnel. Products were retrieved as SCPs and survivors inducted as Foundation personnel. The Foundation is currently attempting to establish contact with Prometheus Labs' branches and affiliates.

Objects recovered from Prometheus Labs facilities include [[[SCP-148]]], [[[SCP-155]]], [[[SCP-534]]], and [[[SCP-1290]]]. To see all documents tagged with //prometheus//, [/system:page-tags/tag/prometheus click here].

++ [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/ The Serpent's Hand]

The Serpent's Hand is a small but formidable organization responsible for several security breaches. At least three different individuals have been encountered, all of whom used possible or confirmed anomalous items for infiltration purposes (including [[[SCP-268]]], which was stolen from the Foundation, who had in turn recovered it during a raid of a Chaos Insurgency facility). The total number of members belonging to this organization is unknown, as is their level of technology, number of possible SCPs held, or total level of threat.  However, it is clear they are highly coordinated and possibly dangerous.  One of their leaders is thought to be a figure known as "L.S.", who is considered to be personally responsible for two security breaches in Foundation sites.

The Foundation currently has very little information about the Serpent's Hand, and almost all known information about the Serpent's Hand has been leaked from the GOC intelligence. The group seems to embrace the use and existence of paranormal items, and in particular seems to embrace humanoid and sentient SCPs. The Serpent's Hand has been highly vocal in criticizing the containment and destruction of these SCPs, especially those which are fully human and are not particularly destructive.

The group seems to have unfriendly relations with the Chaos Insurgency and the ORIA, and an extremely hostile relationship with the GOC. The only recorded cases of unprovoked violence by Serpent's Hand members have been against GOC agents.

The Serpent's Hand seems primarily based in an anomalous location called the Wanderers' Library, a building accessed through portals found in many different parts of the world. Direct assaults on the Library have so far proven unfeasible, even when entrance could be found. However, initial intelligence seems to suggest the Hand has little understanding or control over the place.

++ Unusual Incidents Unit (UIU), Federal Bureau of Investigation

Disparagingly referred to as "X-Files" (after the television program starring David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson) by the larger FBI community, UIU was formed after the SCP-███ Containment Failure Incident brought the existence of paranormal activity to the public consciousness. Although later debunked as a ████ █████████ █████████, a rider attached to HR██████ by Representative ███████ ██████ of ██ (███) required the creation of a special FBI division devoted to rapid response to paranormal events and crimes. Since official protests by then-FBI Director ██████ would have drawn suspicion, UIU was formed on ██-██-████ to "research and react to paranormal activity".

Members of UIU are generally well-meaning, although their lack of effective resources and training often make them a liability in the field. Early attempts to recruit from UIU have met with dismal failure: as UIU is generally considered a dead-end career path, the unit tends to attract the lowest rung of FBI talent. Personnel who request a transfer to UIU voluntarily are few, and those who do generally exhibit high levels of credulity and gullibility. For this reason, UIU operatives are to be recruited at the same tier as normal FBI agents.

Should UIU obtain possession of a genuine SCP, personnel are required to contact Assistant Director ███████ at the ██████████, ██ office for retrieval and replacement with an inert substitute. The standard "Man in Black" concealment pattern is recommended for these scenarios, and for incidents where UIU is operating in the same theater as Foundation elements.

FBI agents operating for the UIU have engaged in combat operations with Foundation Operatives and the Office For The Reclamation of Islamic Artifacts as detailed in ████████ of the Bowe Commission Reports.
