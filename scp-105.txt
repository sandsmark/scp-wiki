**Item #:** SCP-105

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-105 is implanted with a personal tracking device and is currently housed at Site-17. Subject is allowed Class 3 (restricted) socialization privileges with approved site personnel, granted based on continued good behavior and cooperation with Foundation personnel. SCP-105's personal camera (designated SCP-105-B) is to remain in a locked safe-deposit box at Site 19's High Value Item Storage Facility. Standard positive-action defenses (explosive, chemical, biological, and memetic) are to be in place at all times, according to standard operating procedure.

At no point are SCP-105 and SCP-105-B to be allowed to come into contact, without approval of a majority vote of the O5 Council.

**Description:** SCP-105 (formerly known as Iris Thompson), is a Caucasian female human. Records indicate that the subject was born in ████, making her 18 years old at the time of acquisition. Subject has blond hair and blue eyes, and at the time of the article, is 1.54 meters in height and 50kg in weight. Subject does not appear to have any out-of-the-ordinary physical characteristics and appears to be, for all intents and purposes, a normal human being in good health.

SCP-105-B is a Polaroid One Step 600 camera, manufactured in 1982. SCP-105-B does not appear to have any out-of-the-ordinary physical characteristics and appears to be, for all intents and purposes, a normal Polaroid camera, operating normally for all persons aside from SCP-105.

When SCP-105 is holds a photograph taken by SCP-105-B, the photograph changes from a still image to that of a real-time image of the location in question. SCP-105 is also able to reach through the photograph, and manipulate objects within reach of the original point at which the photograph was taken. Persons witnessing this manipulation report seeing a disembodied female hand (determined to be that of SCP-105) reaching out from an invisible portal and carrying out the actions indicated.

SCP-105-B, and the photographs taken by said camera, have no unusual properties when used by any other person. SCP-105 likewise has no unusual abilities in when it comes to other cameras, or photographs taken by any other cameras (including cameras of the same make and model as SCP-105-B). 

**Addendum 1: Circumstances of Acquisition** SCP-105 was brought to the Foundation's attention shortly after the murder of her boyfriend when she was sixteen years old.  Subject claimed to have been on the phone with the victim at the time of his murder, prompting her to hurry to his side: however, telephone records did not correspond to her story, making her a prime suspect in the murder. Subject then informed her lawyer that she had, in fact, witnessed the murder through a photograph she had taken with her boyfriend several days prior: the attorney in question disregarded the story and recommended that the subject plead guilty. Subject refused to do so and was subsequently found guilty of first degree murder and sentenced to death. 

Subject was originally recruited from death row as part of the D-Class Acquisition program, but was transferred to Special Containment Procedures pending confirmation of her abilities. Foundation Personnel retrieved SCP-105-B from her home (replacing it with an identical model), and returned it to her. Further testing confirmed subject's unusual abilities, and she was moved to Site-17, designated SCP-105.

**Addendum 105-00:** "We have run every type of test imaginable on Iris, and the only conclusion that I am able to draw is that her physiology is indistinguishable from that of a normal human being. It is confounding how she is able to have such an extraordinary ability with such an ordinary brain. I will try to contact the SCP ethics committee regarding this issue and the terms of her containment." //-Dr. Dantensen//

**Addendum 105-01:** SCP-105 has volunteered her services to provide additional surveillance on SCP-███ and SCP-███.  (Permission Denied)

**Addendum 105-02:** SCP-105 has expressed interest in joining Mobile Task Force Omega-7, for reconnaissance purposes. (Permission Granted by Gen. ██████, Prof. █████████, and SCP-076-2.)

**Addendum 105-03:** SCP-105 has requested that security cameras be removed from her cell, due to her clean behavior record. (Permission Granted by Dr. Dantensen. //[Permission subsequently rescinded until further notice. - Ethics Committee]//)

**Addendum 105-04:** SCP-105 has requested one (1) Bible (NIV translation) and barring from testing on Sunday mornings. (Permission Denied.)

**Addendum 105-05:** Subject has been accepted into Mobile Task Force Omega-7, having beaten [[[SCP-076]]]-2 in a contest to see which of the two could activate several devices, each spaced over a mile away from each other and the starting point. SCP-105 managed to score significantly higher than SCP-076-2 by using her inherent abilities to her advantage. SCP-076-2 ceded defeat and allowed her entry into the group.

**Addendum 105-06:** I recommend releasing Iris as, after the most recent interviews with her, she appears to have lost her abilities. - Dr. Dantensen

//Recommendation denied. Following outside review of the video recordings of the interviews in question, it is clear that Dr. Dantensen was asking leading questions in an apparent attempt to get SCP-105 to claim that it had lost its anomalous ability. As there is no evidence that this is the case, rather than an attempt to escape, SCP-105 will remain in custody. Dr. Dantensen is to immediately be demoted from Level 3 to Level 1 Security Clearance due to his attempt to enable a containment breach, and is to be re-assigned to studying a non-humanoid SCP Item. - Ethics Committee//
