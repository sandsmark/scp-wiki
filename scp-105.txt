**Item #:** SCP-105

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-105 is implanted with a personal tracking device and is currently housed at Site-17. SCP-105 is allowed Class 3 (restricted) socialization privileges with approved site personnel, granted based on continued good behavior and cooperation with Foundation personnel. SCP-105's personal camera (designated SCP-105-B) is to remain in a locked safe-deposit box at Site 19's High Value Item Storage Facility. Standard positive-action defenses (explosive, chemical, biological, and memetic) are to be in place at all times, according to standard operating procedure.

At no point are SCP-105 and SCP-105-B to be allowed to come into contact, without approval of a majority vote of the O5 Council.

**Description:** SCP-105 (formerly known as Iris Thompson), is a female human of European descent. Records indicate that SCP-105 was born in ████, making her ██ years old at the time of acquisition. She has blond hair and blue eyes, and at the time of the article, is 1.54 meters in height and 50kg in weight. She does not appear to have any out-of-the-ordinary physical characteristics and appears to be, for all intents and purposes, a normal human being in good health.

SCP-105-B is a Polaroid One Step 600 camera, manufactured in 1982. SCP-105-B does not appear to have any out-of-the-ordinary physical characteristics and appears to be, for all intents and purposes, a normal Polaroid camera, operating normally for all persons aside from SCP-105.

When SCP-105 holds a photograph taken by SCP-105-B, the photograph changes from a still image to that of a real-time image of the location in question. SCP-105 is also able to reach through the photograph, and manipulate objects within reach of the original point at which the photograph was taken. Persons witnessing this manipulation report seeing a disembodied female hand (determined to be that of SCP-105) reaching out from an invisible portal and carrying out the actions indicated.

SCP-105-B, and the photographs taken by said camera, have no unusual properties when used by any other person. SCP-105 likewise has no unusual abilities with regard to other cameras, or photographs taken by any other cameras (including cameras of the same make and model as SCP-105-B), or any other device. 

**Appendix 1: Circumstances of Acquisition** SCP-105 was brought to the Foundation's attention shortly after the murder of her boyfriend.  SCP-105 claimed to have been on the phone with the victim at the time of his murder, prompting her to hurry to his side: however, telephone records did not correspond to her story, making it a prime suspect in the murder. SCP-105-B then informed her lawyer that she had, in fact, witnessed the murder through a photograph she had taken with her boyfriend several days prior. The attorney in question disregarded the story and recommended that the subject plead guilty. Subject refused to do so and was subsequently found guilty of first degree murder and sentenced to death.

Subject was originally recruited from death row as part of the D-Class Acquisition program, but was transferred to Special Containment Procedures pending confirmation of her abilities. Foundation Personnel retrieved SCP-105-B from SCP-105's home (replacing it with an identical model), and returned it to her. Further testing confirmed SCP-105's unusual abilities, and it was moved to Site-17, designated SCP-105.

**Addendum 3: History of Service with Mobile Task Force Omega-7:**

//Iris was the second person recruited to Mobile Task Force Omega-7 under the Pandora's Box initiative. Unlike Team Able, which was assigned to strike and capture operations, Team Iris had the primary mission of reconnaissance and intelligence gathering. Team Iris carried out over twenty missions in cooperation with the Bowe Commission, and all indications are that these missions were carried out swiftly, and without incident.//

//The first disciplinary incident involving SCP-105 involved the escalation of Team Iris missions from reconnaissance to wetwork. SCP-105 violently opposed the use of her abilities to carry out assassinations, even after members of the Bowe Commission explained that said actions would be "towards the greater good for world peace."[[footnote]]A direct quote from a Bowe Commission member. See Interview Log 105-21-6543[[/footnote]]. SCP-105 became emotionally distressed, and attempted to deceive Foundation personnel into believing that her anomalous traits had disappeared: this was later disproved by Foundation agents, who intercepted SCP-105 after Dr. D███████ attempted to aid in her escape from Foundation custody.//

//Following the end of the Pandora's Box Initiative, all Mobile Task Force Omega-7 teams were disbanded, and SCP-105 was returned to Site-17. Because of the security risk she represents, she is no longer allowed access to SCP-105-B.//

//All further information regarding Mobile Task Force Omega-7 is sealed by order of the Records And Information Security Administration.//
