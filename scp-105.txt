**Item #:** SCP-105

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-105 is to be kept in a two-room cell furnished with whatever SCP-105 requests as long as such requests do not violate any standard SCP procedure.  Subject is allowed to freely wander the facility, but is not allowed within one hundred meters of another SCP object for security reasons. Once per week, SCP-105 is allowed to leave the facility for one hour. During this period SCP-105 is to be accompanied by two plain-clothes agents. (This privilege is to be suspended until further notice.) SCP-105 has been implanted with a tracking device, and displays no extraordinary physical ability, thus probability of escape is negligible. Subject is allowed to carry one Polaroid camera, but is not permitted to take any pictures within the facility, or of any SCP staff. Subject currently resides in Site-17.

**Description:** SCP-105, who refers to herself as "Iris", appears to be a Caucasian female. She claims to be eighteen years old. Subject has blond hair and blue eyes, is 1.54 meters in height, and 50 kilograms in weight (variable). Subject does not appear to have any out-of-the-ordinary physical characteristics.  Subject displays all basic needs of a normal human being, but favors healthy foods.

When SCP-105 is in possession of a photograph, she is able to look through it, as though it were a window, and see the location depicted in the photograph in real-time, somewhat mimicking the effect of a security camera.  Also, she is able to "reach through" the photograph, and perform minor actions on objects within the photo's reach. Estimates indicate that subject is able to apply roughly 50 newtons of force to an object, and is able to lift objects with masses of no more than 5 kg.

**Origin:** The Foundation became aware of SCP-105's presence when she was standing trial for the murder of her boyfriend when she was sixteen years old.  She claimed to have witnessed his death through a photograph of his room, and she rushed to save him; however, this unfortunately, placed her at the scene of the crime, and with several pieces of botched evidence.  Her lawyer advised her to take an insanity plea, and she was placed in indefinite custody of the █████████ ██████ psychiatric care facility. When SCP examined the court case, it was decided to test the subject's proposed ability.  Subject was, at first, reluctant to be taken into SCP custody, using the phrase "New prison, new warden." However, she later decided to join willingly, under the condition that she would be allowed time outside at least once a week.  Subject's parents were informed that subject died trying to escape from the asylum.

**Addendum 105-00:** "We have run every type of test imaginable on Iris, and the only conclusion that I am able to draw is that her physiology is indistinguishable from that of a normal human being. It is confounding how she is able to have such an extraordinary ability with such an ordinary brain. I will try to contact the SCP ethics committee regarding this issue and the terms of her containment." //-Dr. Dantensen//

**Addendum 105-01:** SCP-105 has volunteered her services to provide additional surveillance on SCP-███ and SCP-███.  (Permission Denied)

**Addendum 105-02:** SCP-105 has expressed interest in joining Mobile Task Force Omega-7, for reconnaissance purposes. (Permission Granted by Gen. ██████, Prof. █████████, and SCP-076-2.)

**Addendum 105-03:** SCP-105 has requested that security cameras be removed from her cell, due to her clean behavior record. (Permission Granted by Dr. Dantensen. //[Permission subsequently rescinded until further notice. - Ethics Committee]//)

**Addendum 105-04:** SCP-105 has requested one (1) Bible (NIV translation) and barring from testing on Sunday mornings. (Permission Denied.)

**Addendum 105-05:** Subject has been accepted into Mobile Task Force Omega-7, having beaten [[[SCP-076]]]-2 in a contest to see which of the two could activate several devices, each spaced over a mile away from each other and the starting point. SCP-105 managed to score significantly higher than SCP-076-2 by using her inherent abilities to her advantage. SCP-076-2 ceded defeat and allowed her entry into the group.

**Addendum 105-06:** I recommend releasing Iris as, after the most recent interviews with her, she appears to have lost her abilities. - Dr. Dantensen

//Recommendation denied. Following outside review of the video recordings of the interviews in question, it is clear that Dr. Dantensen was asking leading questions in an apparent attempt to get SCP-105 to claim that it had lost its anomalous ability. As there is no evidence that this is the case, rather than an attempt to escape, SCP-105 will remain in custody. Dr. Dantensen is to immediately be demoted from Level 3 to Level 1 Security Clearance due to his attempt to enable a containment breach, and is to be re-assigned to studying a non-humanoid SCP Item. - Ethics Committee//
