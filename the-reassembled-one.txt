**The Reassembled One, Master of the Church of the Broken God, Son of MEKHANE, [[footnote]] While "Broken God" and "MEKHANE" refer to the same entity, "MEKHANE" is used by members of the Devout and in written papers. "Broken God" is a colloquialism coined by outsiders of the faith. [[/footnote]] KTE-7317-Black Ford**

Revered as the Son of MEKHANE, Qabil was an important figure during the War of the Flesh [[footnote]] While historic sources had cited the invaders as "Sea People", that may be a misnomer derived from records of early battles that took place in port cities. [[/footnote]] in the late Bronze Age. Although he died in battle once, he was later reassembled as a divine miracle of MEKHANE. Reassembled and augmented, Qabil was tasked to reassemble MEKHANE and triumph over the Flesh. 

Since the end of the Bronze Age, Qabil secluded himself from the world. In recent times, he is awakened to a world that has forgotten MEKHANE. Despite that, Qabil seeks to complete his mission and prepare for the Day of Reassembly. [[footnote]] The Day of Reassembly is believed to be the day where MEKHANE is reassembled to His glory and the Flesh is permanently destroyed. [[/footnote]] To that end, alongside the thirteen-member Apostle Overwatch, they founded the latest incarnation of the Devout: The Church of the Broken God. [[footnote]] The term "Church of the Broken God" was originally coined by news media, which ultimately became the official title for the organisation. [[/footnote]]

**Knowledge**
[[/=]]

**Traits:** Qabil's appearance is that of a male human in his earlier thirties, standing at about 1.8 m tall and weighing about 80 kg. His limbs and spinal cord are replaced with bronze implants, grafted onto him during his reassembly. Engraved onto his forehead is the Design, a Piece of MEKHANE which contains an outline of MEKHANE's completed Form. 

Qabil has received an augmentation from MEKHANE that reflects any attacks directed towards him against his attacker, safeguarding him against the many agencies of the Flesh. In addition, Qabil gains pyrokinetic ability that allows him to manifest fire around him. 

Qabil also possesses a photographic memory, storing all canon knowledge regarding MEKHANE and the Flesh. He is regarded among the Devout as a source of knowledge and is the author of the Devout's Holy Writs. 

**Nature:** Qabil is known for his introverted disposition. He shuns the company of his fellows despite his influential role amongst the Devout, so management of everyday operations is left to the Apostle Overwatch. His only true priority is to reassemble MEKHANE, often relying on the Devout to retrieve His Pieces. Thus, he devotes all his time to reassemble MEKHANE.

**History & Associated Parties:** According to the Book of Designs, Qabil was the firstborn child to Hawwa, who was impregnated by lightning. [[footnote]] Excerpt from the Book of Designs Chapter 8: //16. And the craftsman Cedalion explained: "Do not be afraid for what is conceived in you is from MEKHANE, who is Broken." 17. "And you shall give birth to His Son and he shall make MEKHANE Whole."// [[/footnote]] In his youth, Qabil was initiated into the cult of MEKHANE. Skilled in blacksmithing, he grew to become a talented metalsmith. 

During the War of the Flesh, Qabil was among the many defenders to rally against the Flesh. Famously, he fought a duel with his half-brother, Habil the Betrayer. [[footnote]] Unlike Qabil, Habil the Betrayer is not born from MEKHANE. [[/footnote]] Although the duel ended in Habil's death, Qabil was mortally wounded and he too died not long after. 

Many mourned and wept at the passing of Qabil, but MEKHANE performed His miracle on the remnants of Qabil. The sky was cast in His tears and lightning struck upon Qabil's Broken body. Branded with His Design, Qabil was made Whole and arose. At the sight of the reassembled Qabil praising MEKHANE, he would be hailed as The Reassembled One. After that battle, Qabil was renowned as the founder of many cities, as described in Bronze 15:5-7. [[footnote]] Excerpt from the Book of Bronze Chapter 15: //5. And the formerly great forests and all its greenery burnt unto ashes and dust. 6. And gave way to the flames evoked through His Son Qabil. 7. And once these formerly great forests no longer obstruct His Son, Qabil built for the righteous a sanctuary to safeguard the righteous from the horrors of the Flesh.// [[/footnote]]

At the end of the Bronze Age, Qabil secluded himself to recover from injuries and fell into deep slumber. He was awakened in the 20th century, where he roamed the land in search of modern successors to the Devout... only to find none initially. He took it upon himself to gather new followers to reassemble the Broken God, eventually founding the Church of the Broken God. 

Currently, Qabil leads this new incarnation of the Devout, and utilises the Design and his many followers to locate and secure the Pieces of MEKHANE. Under Qabil's leadership, the Devout strengthens day by day [[footnote]] Excerpt from //The New York Times//, dated 20 August 1991: Broken God followers led by AO-12 victorious in USSR. [[/footnote]] and prepares for the Day of Reassembly. 

**Approach:** Due to multiple attempts of assassination by the Bookburners, Qabil is currently secured in the Seventeenth Forge, and protected by the Devout. High levels of security have deterred attempts to intrude the Seventeenth Forge, protecting Qabil from enemies and ensuring no hindrance to his mission. 

Due to Qabil's presence and mission, only Class 4 and above members of the Devout are allowed entry to the Seventeenth Forge. If any other individual wishes to seek an audience with Qabil, they must obtain approval from a member of the Apostle Overwatch. 

//While these measures appear to be a reaction against Qabil's enemies, he is essentially under house arrest. We do not know if that is truly Qabil's wishes or the Apostle Overwatch's.// ~ L.S.

**Observations & Stories**
[[/=]]

Within the canon of the Devout, Qabil is the central figure in the Gospel of Hephaestus. Members of the Devout universally revere Qabil as a saviour, believed to be key to the reassembly of MEKHANE. It is believed by the Devout that they will be rewarded for the reassembly of MEKHANE on the Day of Reassembly, and become united with Him. [[footnote]] Excerpt from the Book of Reassembly Chapter 53: //14. "And all faithful followers of MEKHANE shall be regarded as His Sons and Daughters, and be in communion with Him."// [[/footnote]]

The Threat Entity Database of the Bookburners consider Qabil and the Devout as a Severe Threat, probably due to their influence on many devotees worldwide. Skirmishes have occurred between the Devout and Bookburners over various Pieces of MEKHANE, usually resulting in collateral damage.

**Doubt**
[[/=]]

It is speculated that Qabil himself had warped the Devout to suit his interests, whatever it may be. Proponents of this allegation highlight Qabil's authorship of the Holy Writs, along with Broken God dogma positioning him as a messianic figure and a component of MEKHANE. 

Another speculation among Hand members is that the Apostle Overwatch had imprisoned Qabil. Since relocation to the Seventeenth Forge, Qabil has not made a public appearance and security prevented outsiders from entering the Seventeenth Forge. Qabil's current status cannot be confirmed, though the Devout consistently stress that Qabil is working to rebuild MEKHANE and call for followers to send in any relic that could be a Piece of MEKHANE. 

//Intentions do not matter, what matters to all of us here is that the masquerade imposed by the Bookburners will be broken once MEKHANE is reassembled. Let the Devout rebuild MEKHANE, as they should.// ~ C.O.G.

//I beg to differ. The broken masquerade is meaningless if it only creates a prison in its place. The Devout appears to be hoarding all the world's mysteries to achieve their objectives, which contradicts the principles in which we stand for. Is the Broken God truly worth the price?// ~ L.S.
