**Item #:** SCP-5199

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5199-A is designated as a perpetual patient in the neonatal care unit at Site 06-3 and undergoes all appropriate procedures.

SCP-5199-B is held in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site 06-3. The entity is required to attend therapy twice weekly alongside monthly psychiatric evaluations. SCP-5199-B is allowed to be in contact with SCP-5199-A for a maximum of six hours per day, though this limit may be moved at the discretion of the entity’s psychological staff.

**Description:** SCP-5199 is the designation of two connected anomalous entities referred to as SCP-5199-A and SCP-5199-B. 

SCP-5199-A is the designation of an animate statue composed of calcified tissue that resembles a human infant. This tissue is pliant enough to allow a full range of motion but displays no other anomalous properties. Beyond its material makeup, SCP-5199-A’s behavior, needs, and medical vitals are consistent with that of a non-anomalous child, though it shows no signs of growth nor standard development milestones. 

SCP-5199-B is a 27-year-old British woman by the name of Leida Kuusik who is responsible for SCP-5199-A's creation. Though SCP-5199-B was formerly capable of local reality manipulation, this property has so far proven to have been transient, and the entity no longer shows independent anomalous capabilities.

Both components of SCP-5199 were brought into containment on May 5th, 2019, shortly after the surgical removal of SCP-5199-A. Medical records of the birth and interviews with SCP-5199-B indicate that the fetus had been deemed a miscarriage via abdominal pregnancy following rupture of the uterine wall, a condition that SCP-5199-B was predisposed to due to its Nälkän[[footnote]]More commonly known as "Sarkic" or "Sarkites": in this case, a Proto-Sarkic population isolated in northern Estonia.[[/footnote]] ethnicity. It is hypothesized that the biological manipulation practiced by the group is responsible for the deleterious germ-line mutations affecting SCP-5199-B as opposed to //de novo// mutations in the individual herself.

An MRI performed on April 29th revealed that the unborn fetus had developed into a lithopedion.[[footnote]]A rare type of ectopic pregnancy in which the mother's body calcifies the dead fetus as an immune response.[[/footnote]] Sometime in the following week, SCP-5199-B underwent an involuntary stress-born Hume fluctuation, the result of which was the animation of SCP-5199-A.

**Procedure:** Exploratory MRI of SCP-5199-A

**Result:** SCP-5199-A is structurally uniform, though there are numerous sections of higher density in the head and upper torso. No internal organ structures are present.

**Result:** Though attempts at sedation failed, a sample was successfully acquired. Mass spectrometry indicates that SCP-5199-A is chemically consistent with non-anomalous lithopedia.

**Procedure:** Replace sample material taken in SCP-5199-A/3 back in its original position //in vivo.// The material will be kept in place using surgical glue and covered in an adhesive bandage for protection.

**Result:** As only 0.35g of material were recoverable post-analysis, a mixture of calcium, phosphate, iron, and zinc powder in a ratio identical to the sample's composition was used as filler. The replaced sample has stayed intact, though no sign of reintegration with SCP-5199-A has been observed.

**CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE REVISION 18 SEP 2019**
[[/=]]

SCP-5199-A is designated as a perpetual patient in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at Site 06-3. The entity is to wear a cushioned, full-body suit at all possible times to reduce further disintegration. All hard surfaces in areas accessible by SCP-5199-A are to be covered in cushioning foam to provide extra padding.

SCP-5199-B is held in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site 06-3. The entity is required to attend therapy twice weekly alongside monthly psychiatric evaluations. SCP-5199-B is allowed to be in contact with SCP-5199-A for a maximum of two hours per day, though this limit may be moved at the discretion of the entity’s psychological staff.

Direct contact with SCP-5199-A may not be made without Level-3 confirmation and observation so as to prevent further damage.

##666666|**Result:** Mixture was applied successfully. However, nearly all patches were undone unconsciously due to SCP-5199-A's movements.##

+* Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)

I, Leida Kuusik, alias SCP-5199-B, being of sound mind and body and as legal guardian of Erin Kuusik, alias SCP-5199-A, do hereby request to all relevant parties that should signs of life cease to be observed from Erin Kuusik, no attempt shall be made to resuscitate them.

In addition, I do hereby request that attempts at curation immediately cease upon recognition of this document by the leadership of the SCP Foundation.

I acknowledge that this decision does not inherently alter the status of my containment nor that of Erin Kuusik.

I acknowledge that cessation of treatment on Erin Kuusik will result in a significant decrease in the likelihood of curation.

I acknowledge that the SCP Foundation reserves the right to override the above requests in an emergency scenario or in pursuit of its mission to Secure, Contain, and Protect, as defined by The Code of Ethics of the Foundation 20.2.7-18.

This order shall remain in effect until overridden by my written request.

I voluntarily execute this order with complete understanding of all consequences inherent.
