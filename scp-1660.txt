**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1660-1 may be safely kept in a locked safe-deposit box at Site ██ Storage Facility. Standard positive-action defenses (explosive, chemical, biological, and memetic) are to be in place at all times, according to standard operating procedure. SCP-1660-1 is to be kept away from flammable materials unless in testing. Under no circumstances is SCP-1660-1 to come into contact with fire-related SCPs such as SCP-███. In event of SCP-1660-1 igniting outside, testing personal are to evacuate the area until all flaming materials are extinguished. Due to only being accessible via SCP-1660-1, SCP-1660-2 can be considered to be contained as long as SCP-1660-1 is. Any animal life that emerges from SCP-1660-2 during testing are to be captured pending study and possible termination.

**Description:** SCP-1660-1 is an elaborately decorative oil lamp made from silver, coral and the shell of a as yet unknown species of snail. Its anomalous effects active if a fire is lit inside the chamber of the snail shell. Upon ignition the fire will, regardless of materials used, begin to emit large amounts of smoke while will begin to gather forming an arch shaped "gate" in the air approximately ███ meters across. The size and stability of said "gate" will fluctuate based on the amount of material being burned within SCP-1660-1. In event of SCP-1660-1 being extinguished the gateway will collapse. 

SCP-1660-2 is a miniature parallel universe consisting of approximately █████ kilometers of temperate forest conditions which can be accessed by means of the "gate" produced by SCP-1660-1. Around the edges of SCP-1660-2 are walls of a as-of-yet unidentified mineral rating up to ███ on the mohs scale. Testing with diamond drills have been unable to damage the mineral while rapidly blunting drill bits. Roughly a kilometer above the treetops is what appears to be a layer of [DATA EXPUNGED] all aerial exploration is to be performed with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) following incident ████████. Attempts at drilling below ground have revealed a crust of the same unidentified mineral making up the walls exists approximately half a kilometer exists under the entire area of SCP-1660-2.

**Document Alpha SCP-1660-7: Report from Director ████**

> The information in the article that you've already read left out, or more accurately expunged something quite important. SCP-1660-7. They're sapient. Their forepaws work like hands. They have simple tools and a language of their own based on 
> bioluminescent patterns that we have yet to decode.
> 
> It is their cave paintings which however interest us, crude humanoid figures holding sticks and killing with them at a distance, shooting projectiles. Then a battle, new figures, and the end of the killing. And the symbol copied off the new figures, the symbol which they leave food in front of in sacrifice, the symbol which they smear all over things with ash and plant pigment. Two rings, one inside the other, with three arrows pointing inward. The symbol of their gods.
