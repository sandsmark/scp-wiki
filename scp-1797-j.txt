**Item #:** SCP-1797-J

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1797-J is to be kept inside a secure storage unit at the media archive of [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-77| Site-77]]]. It is to be checked regularly for imperfections. Once every four years, a search of any possibly related artifacts should be conducted through the archives.

 **Description:** SCP-1797-J is a polymorphic oil portrait of former United States President George Washington. Behind him stands an unidentified male figure engaging in apparently vigorous sexual intercourse with Washington. 

"GEORGE WASHINGTON ENTERTAINING A GENTLEMAN FRIEND WHILE PICKING HIS NOSE"(sic) has been written on the backing with a felt tipped writing instrument. Laboratory analysis indicates that SCP-1797-J is from an authentic time period. 

SCP-1797-J was initially encountered by a filing clerk in the George Washington Presidential Library in 1█81. Upon viewing it they alerted the local constabulary with the intent to find the painter and press "obscenity charges". A low-level investigation was conducted, at which point the Foundation was alerted and secured SCP-1797-J. 

Further investigation of the library's records by Foundation personnel failed to yield any leads on SCP-1797-J's origin.

Repeated viewings of SCP-1797-J causes it to display a different scene. Each viewing becomes more and more "randy"; However the President will always be picking his nose.
