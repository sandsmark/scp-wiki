**Item #:** SCP-3623

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** As of writing this document, Foundation was succesful in containing 13 instances of SCP-3623 out of at least 200 worldwide[[footnote]] It is estimated that at least 23% of its population is involved with other Groups of Interest, notably the Global Occult Coalition, Serpent's Hand and multiple small anartist cells.[[/footnote]]. Population of SCP-3623 is slowly increasing by unknown means.

SCP-3623-1 through -11 are to be contained close to their respective hosts, in a standard humanoid containment cell in Site-91. Instances are to be housed separately from their hosts but in close proximity of no more than 3 kilometres. On-site personnel is to be reminded that while instances of SCP-3623 do not have the same needs as their hosts, they should be treated as if they had. 

An exception is to be made in case of SCP-3623-12 and -13, whose hosts are currently Foundation employees. Due to their unrecognizability from humans and their state as anomalous entities, Protocol Artwork-7 has been devised and applies for any instance of SCP-3623 that --infects-- transfers to Foundation personnel. See Addendum 3623-2 for more information regarding Protocol Artwork-7.

##blue|--Mobile Task Force is to actively search for and contain instances of SCP-3623 and their hosts.--##

##blue|Remaining uncontained instances are to be captured if found but no active searching is to be enacted due to difficulty of such task and the low level of danger that SCP-3623 represents.##

**Description:** SCP-3623 is a an intelligent species of anomalous --parasitic-- symbiotic humanoids, which uses sentient species, usually humans, as their host. Connection between SCP-3623 and its host is psychological and does not require physical contact to form. Persons affected by SCP-3623 experience a variety of symptoms ranging from headache to loss of conciousness, however they are not in any immediate danger.

Biology of SCP-3623 is identical to human with a few key differences:

* Only female instances of SCP-3623 exist.
* Reproductive systems of SCP-3623 do not function [[footnote]]However bodies of SCP-3623 possess them. It is currently unknown how SCP-3623 reproduces.[[/footnote]].
* SCP-3623 do not require any nutrition other than energy drained from their hosts but have completely functioning digestive systems.
* Stable Hume Field of exactly 0.87 Humes has been observed in all contained instances of SCP-3623 to date and has proved to be the only effective way of identifying instances of SCP-3623 from humans. Instances of SCP-3623 have not been observed to have any reality bending abilities.
* SCP-3623 have an extremely long lifespan. To date, no known occurence of natural death has been observed in SCP-3623  [[footnote]]It appears that aging is replaced by a different process (See Addendum 3623-1 for information on the Transfer process of SCP-3623).[[/footnote]].

Roughly every 72 hours, SCP-3623 will start a "feeding event". In order for SCP-3623 to start feeding, a distance of maximally 5 kilometers from host has to be established, otherwise the subject will starve. There is no observable change in behaviour of SCP-3623, in fact, entities in question do not report feeling any change either[[footnote]] Only noticable change in behavior occurs when SCP-3623 starts starving.[[/footnote]], however, the host does experience this event as a sudden surge of weariness, sometimes accompanied by headaches. Strength of this surge depends on time passed since last feeding event.

An anomalous side effect of this feeding is described as sudden compulsion to create and engage in activities regarded as artistic, such as writing poems, or playing instruments. This can be used as an indicator of connection between host and SCP-3623 as affected persons may exhibit a change in behaviour. It is to be noted, that this effect only creates artistic compulsion and does not enhance any previous skill. Because of this, instances of SCP-3623 generally prefer people with pre-existing artistic capabilities, when switching hosts.

**Addendum 3623-1:** Transfer Process

Transfer process occurs only when the host of SCP-3623 dies and cannot happen otherwise. In an opposite scenario, where SCP-3623 dies, the host starts developing symptoms of depression and various psychological problems leading to eventual suicide in 93% of cases. During this process, SCP-3623 will experience great amount of pain and involuntarily undergo an event similar to metamorphosis. SCP-3623 will replace at least 50% of its genome and go through a complete body and personality change. Memory of SCP-3623 is also replaced. It is to be noted that in some cases, SCP-3623 will retain memory of its nature as an anomalous entity.

Subject looks very different from its original form and now appears as an young woman with dark hair, noticably taller than before. Subject's clothing remains the same, though it doesn't fit subject's figure anymore.

##blue|Most subjects will almost instantly accustom to their new personalities and bodies. Their memory is completely replaced with false memories of their life, similar to effects of an amnestic treatment. Interestingly, SCP-3623 is extremely resilient against any other amnestic effect. It is also to be noted that instances of SCP-3623 and their respective hosts often exhibit a subconscious need to stay close to one another, even when not aware of their psychic link.##

**Addendum 3623-2:** Protocol Artwork-7
[[collapsible show="[SUBMIT LOGIN CREDENTIALS: LEVEL 3 CLEARANCE REQUIRED]" hide="[CREDENTIALS ACCEPTED]"]]


Protocol Artwork-7 applies to instances of SCP-3623 which are connected to Foundation Personnel (Currently two, SCP-3623-12 and -13). As of writing this, no effective way of breaking the connection between SCP-3623 and its host exists. Termination of host triggers a transfer event and termination of SCP-3623 causes host to develop severe anxiety and depression, eventually leading to suicide.
Due to this, the fact that instances of SCP-3623 themselves exhibit no dangerous properties and the memory alteration caused during their transfer, it has been decided that SCP-3623-12 and -13 will be given statuses of Foundation employees. 

**Protocol:**
* All instances of Foundation employees who are SCP-3623 are to be kept oblivious of their true nature.
* Hosts of respective instances are to be informed of their nature as hosts and are to be given all information regarding the instance of SCP-3623 that connected to them.
* All instances of Foundation employees who are SCP-3623 are to have their security clearance edited without their knowing and are not allowed to leave Site-91.
* Should any instance of SCP-3623 realise their true nature, they are to be refered to the document below.

**Document 3623-7:**
> Welcome,
> 
> You are here because you want to know who you are. First of all, I am terribly sorry, no you are not human, no we couldn't tell you. I worked hard and used all my influence and connections in the Ethics Committee to even create Protocol Artwork-7. Not telling you was a compromise. Why? Well, the Foundation contains anomalies. We do not destroy them, we do not use them and most importantly, we do not work with them. Of course there are exceptions. And this is one of them.
> 
> I don't care if anyone disagrees. What else would you have done? Execute all the SCP-3623 we have because some of them infected personnel? Keep them locked up and risk the staff killing themselves? If it was on me, I would let this anomaly be, but I also understand that the Foundation doesn't leave anomalies uncontained.
> 
> So here you are, SCP-3623. But think about it, do you really feel that different? I recommend you to tell your host. Talking is a key to a succesful relationship and if you like it or not, you are in one now. It has worked for me while it did, it should for you.
> 
> I apologise for telling you this way. But this arrangement is already very thin. Please think about your next action.
> 
> - Dr. Erwick, ##blue|former## Director of Site-91
