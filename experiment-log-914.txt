**Test 914-1207**
**Name:** WR Markham
**Date:** 12/11/2019
**Total Items:** Two hardback copies of //In My Time// by Former US Vice President Dick Cheney

**Input:** //In My Time//
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A 1:6 paper-mache model of Dick Cheney.

**Input:** //In My Time//
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A copy of //The Necessary Evil//, ostensibly authored by Liz Cheney (President of the United States 2021-2029) in 2039.
According to the book, a global war broke out in 2015 because of the actions of an SCP Foundation researcher named Madeleine Sailer, which indirectly led to the United States declaring war on Bangladesh, followed by an invasion of Kashmir by Pakistan, atomic bombings of fifty cities in ten nations, eventually leading to the public acknowledgement of the anomalous, and a new Civil Rights movement which essentially denounced the SCP Foundation's containment on sapient humanoid anomalies.
According to footnotes, by 2038, [[[SCP-029]]] was stated to have started an apocalyptic cult in Hyderabad, [[[SCP-096]]] was neutralized when Pittsburgh was nuked, while [[[scp-3009|SCP-3009-C]]], as the Governor of Minnesota, was shot during her reelection campaign. A prominent member of the Church of the Broken God was elected as a state representative from Texas.

//Note: While no memetic or cognitive hazards were detected, the autobiography was incinerated due to its written description of a certain "Four Pixels flag" of the new Civil Rights movement. We do not need an idiot to attempt reproduction of the flag and trigger 096 on a killing spree. - WR Markham//

-----
**Test 914-1208**
**Name:** Researcher Laskenta; D-48962
**Date:** 12/11/2019
**Total Items:** Three electronic calculators

//Note: As anomalous numbers normally represent a threat and it is not unlikely that 914 will produce such output, I got two members of Θ-90 as a security measurement. - Laskenta//

**Input:** One calculator
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** An abacus, made out of plastics and metal. The materials match the input. --Non-anomalous.--

**Input:** One calculator
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** An abacus. The individual parts of this output are constructed from different materials than they were in the previous output, but the dimensions are identical.

//Note: It is highly unusual for 914 to repeat its outputs. I will further investigate both results and deem both as anomalous for the time being. Even if there is a good chance that 914 messes with us again. - Laskenta//

**Input:** One calculator
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** The input, with five additional buttons, labelled "StA 1", "StA 2", "LfA 1", "LfA 2" and "Introduce" respectively. Pressing one of the two "StA" buttons will cause an anomalous effect that moves one of the above created abaci into the state that represents the value shown on the display of this output. Pressing one of the two "LfA" buttons will paste a value shown on one of the abaci onto the output. --Pressing the "Introduce" button results in an anomalous effect that introduces the sum of the values shown on both abaci to the set of natural numbers.-- Pressing the "Introduce" button results in a cognitohazardous sound that affects every human that hears the button being pressed. Affected subjects will believe that the sum of the values shown on both abaci has been added to the set of natural numbers until they are reminded that the sum of two natural numbers will lead to another existing natural number.

**Test 914-1209**
**Name:** Intern Bolton
**Date:** 12/11/2019
**Total Items:** Two 8ml bottles of Purell brand hand sanitizer, one sheet of A4 printer paper, one mechanical pencil

//Note: Finally got set up here and started mingling with a few of the others. Wanted to try more than just an introductory message for my first log. Pre-approved, of course. - Intern Bolton//

**Input:** One sheet of printer paper with the message "Hey, 914. Another new guy. - Bolton" scrawled on it, one mechanical pencil.
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** The same sheet of printer paper with a large, but crude, drawing of a screw on it. Mechanical pencil half empty.

//Note: Oh come on, my handwriting's not that atrocious. - Intern Bolton//

**Input:** One bottle of hand sanitizer.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One bottle with a spray nozzle instead of a hand pump, labelled "Full-body sanitizer". Testing revealed the spray to be extremely caustic to any materials touching the user's skin, including but not limited to bacteria, hair, tattoos, clothes, and metal jewelry. Any skin exposed to the spray is completely sanitized with minor temporary skin irritation. Unscrewing the spray nozzle from the bottle revealed the contents themselves to be ordinary hand sanitizer with no anomalous properties. Bottle and contents incinerated separately.

**Input:** One paper note, with the words: ''Hello, 914, I am Intern Clockworks, I will be working with you.''
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One paper note, with a paragraph detailing the benefits of joining the Church of the Broken God, non-anomalous.

//Note: Is that supposed to happen? I was at least expecting some sort of response. Not something that had to do with the Broken God. - Intern Clockworks//

**Input:** One 1kg cube of steel
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One small metal statue consisting of a large gear anomalously floating and rotating on a smaller pile of semi-melted gears

//Note: That’s...quite interesting but I won’t be keeping it. Dr. Zavalosa, is it okay if I put this on Rough? - Intern Clockworks//

//Note: Fair enough. -Prof. Wren//

**Input:** One Falconzord.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A toy model of Captain Falcon from the //F-Zero// game franchise. An anomalous feature was discovered by D-class wherein contact with the model's left hand, closed in a fist, causes 1st-degree burns and minor bone fractures in a 7cm radius around area of contact. Item incinerated.

//Note: Yeah, we don't need anyone around here Falcon Punching anyone else, thanks. -Prof. Wren//

**Input:** One Red Battlezord.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** The same toy configured as a twin-barreled gatling gun. This configuration is not known to be possible. Toy could be converted to normal humanoid configuration and back afterward.

**Input:** One Brachiozord.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A trio of small, black/gold toy model Utahraptors. Upon booth opening, model raptors jumped on D-class and launched an unsuccessful attack. Models smashed and incinerated.

//Note: Okay, time for the last one. -Prof. Wren//

**Input:** The remaining Zord models.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** The four Zord models combined together as follows:
-The Dragonzord in its "Battle Mode" torso configuration. Tail and chest plate stored inside the Brachiozord.
-The Falconzord on the Dragonzord's back with its wings clamped around the torso and its wingtips facing forward.
-The Red Battlezord's chest piece split in two to separate the arms and folded over to form shoulder plates, connected to the outside of the Falconzord's wings. The gatling guns around the hands are extended. Its feet are detached and connected at the base of the Dragonzord's legs. The remaining pieces are stored inside the Brachiozord.
-The above combination is standing atop the Brachiozord, whose neck and head are lowered and straightened out, with a cannon barrel in its mouth.

//Note: Wow...not sure what I was expecting, but a Tommy Oliver zord combination...perhaps "T.O. Ultrazord" would be a good name for it?...was not anywhere near what I thought it'd do. I honestly expected this test to go w-- - Prof. Wren//

//Note: 15 seconds after output booth opened, the "T.O. Ultrazord" began moving towards D-class. Multiple bursts of holographic weapons-fire erupted from its gattling arms, wing tips, and Brachiozord head cannon, accompanied by the sounds of laser fire and "Go Go Power Rangers" by Ron Wasserman. No damage was caused by the illusionnary blaster barrage, though D-class later mentioned feeling compelled to holler in pain and fall flat on his back after being struck by multiple bolts, at which time a holographic explosion erupted from D-class and filled the room.//

//Note: Further tests have shown the effect only occurs when the "T.O. Ultrazord" is placed within 1.2 meters of a D-class, suggesting it only "attacks" those it considers "evil."//
