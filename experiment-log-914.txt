One (1) capsule administered to male D-class test subject, resulting in subject experiencing effects of intense euphoria, marked improvement in mood, and some psychedelic visuals after a period of 25 minutes. Effects lasted for 10 hours, after which subject experienced a "crash" with symptoms of a bad hangover and severe depression lasting for a two week period. More tests pending, but effect seems to be a combination of both drugs with a more severe "crash" period than unrefined MDMA. 

**Input:**  20 doses MDMA, 20 does of LSD, and 20 doses "Viagra" 
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One hundred (100) 16.5 µg gel capsules, opalescent yellow in color. One (1) capsule administered to female D-class test subject, resulting in intense euphoria, a feeling of "serenity", and had a strong desire to be in close physical contact with others, with onset occur after a period of 5 minutes. Subject remained in this state for a period of 78 hours, after which subject entered a catatonic state lasting a period of nearly four weeks. Subject showed extreme hostility after awakening and appeared to be in intense pain. Subject was terminated then autopsied, revealing that pleasure centers in her brain were severely damaged and testosterone levels were increased. More tests pending.

**Input:**  20 doses MDMA, 20 does of LSD, and 20 doses "Viagra" 
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One hundred (100) 17µg gel capsules, golden and luminescent. One (1) capsule administered to male D-class test subject, with effects identical to "Fine" output appearing after 30 seconds. Subject was very docile and, while coherent, would not answer questions. After 15 minutes, subject entered a catatonic state for a period of 74 hours during which time subject was observed to have seizures resulting in ejaculation. Upon awakening, subject displayed a marked deadening of emotion, showed no interest in pleasurable activities, and was unable to be sexually aroused. When interviewed, subject stated he "just didn't care anymore". Subject terminated and autopsied, show sever damage specific to emotional centers of the brain. More tests pending. 

//Note: While there may be possible therapeutic benefits to the "Fine" and "Very Fine" outputs, I suggest that more tests be run on subjects of both genders. The output results are to be kept in my office safe unless being tested.// -Dr. Palmer

**Output:** 1x PDA containing SCP-079. Began upgrading the PDA's memory. Immediately destroyed.

**Input:** 1x PDA Containing SCP-317
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** Various individual parts that, when assembled, formed a non-functioning 
mechanical device of same shape and proportions as the PDA.

**Input:** 1x PDA Containing SCP-317
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** [DATA EXPUNGED] Quickly began 'Replicating'. Took several dozen Class D personnel to contain, but no casualties as it did not seem interested in harming them. Destroyed.

//Note: It was disturbingly organic in its outward appearance. Almost... human. Could this mean a connection between 317 and 228? The meaning of this is being looked into.//
- Dr. Ruben █████
//Note: The machine is normally very random with its changes- yet twice in a row, it simply created another PDA that had a different SCP program on it. Between this and the device's strange behavior when 808 is in the vicinity of it, it almost appears as if the device has preferences when dealing with other SCPs. I believe further investigation is needed into this matter.//

*Name:** Dr. P██████ Gibbons
**Date:** [DATA EXPUNGED]
**Total items:** 5x regular cubes of Telekill Alloy [[[SCP-148]]], with a volume of 0.4 cubic meters, making a total of 2 (Two) cubic meters.

**Input:** 1x cube of Telekill Alloy for each setting.

**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** 25x regular cubes of Telekill Alloy, each with a volume of 0.016 cubic meters

**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** 1x cube of unknown dark-blue metal, with a volume of 0.2 cubic meters. The fact that it's two times smaller to the original input cube suggests that the density of the material is two times greater than the Telekill Alloy. With an original melting point of 700ºC, and an evaporation point of 1400ºC, it has been noticed that, if temperature of the metal reaches below 0ºC, the color of the metal changes to a lighter blue and physical properties change. This metal has an unknown melting point, as focused, concentrated heat of over 20000ºC has not melted it. Catalogation for SCP has been raised to 05-7 personnel and denied.


**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** 1x cube of unknown light-red metal, with a volume of 1.2 cubic meters. Size is three times that of the original input, suggesting that the input Telekill Alloy is three times more dense than the output. Metal has a melting point of 700ºC and an evaporation point of 1400ºC, matching with the 'Coarse' output, although does not show the same physical properties change when reaching 0ºC, like the previous output. Metal, when touched by a sentient human being, inhibits all senses for a period of 30 (thirty) minutes after the first time is touched (that is, if the object is held for 5 seconds, the period of inhibition will last 30 minutes and 5 seconds). Witnesses have later described it as a "VERY unpleasant experience," and also manifested sensations of "wild hallucinations," similar to a near-overdose of Lysergic Acid. --SCP catalogation pending.-- //SCP catalogation approved by O5-█, Output now known as [[[SCP-506]]].//

//The 30 scariest minutes of my fucking life. Note to self: Use the damn gloves. Second note to self: Ask Clef if he wants bracelets of this for his birthday. -Dr. Gibbons//

**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Sculpture resembling [[[SCP-682]]] made out of Telekill Alloy, with a volume 0.4 cubic meters. Output has not shown any kind of sentient manifestations, although any contact or approach near [[[SCP-682]]] is denied until further notice.

//Now, I would like this for my dekstop, if you don't mind. -Dr. Gibbons//

**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** [DATA EXPUNGED].
//Creepy. How the fly got into the input chamber, I don't know. -Dr. Gibbons//

**Test 11828-U5:** Tests on the nature and construction of SCP-914

With approval from 05 Command, A single gear was removed from one of the "outer" sections of SCP-914.  Placement was carefully documented, and was in a location that would not release tension on any belts, or damage any documented sections.  Testing area was cleared and sealed after placing a steel block in the "intake" booth.  D-00104 was dispatched to SCP-914, and instructed to turn the key and activate SCP-914.

D-00104 reported that "the key won't catch", and it was observed the key turned several times without tightening the mainspring.  No activity of any kind was observed from SCP-914 during this time.

Missing gear was replaced with a identical copy, comprised of the same metal (brass) as the original.  Steel block re-inserted into the "intake" booth, and SCP-914 was activated on the "1:1" setting.  SCP-914 observed to operate normally, with a slight pause of 3.5 seconds after winding the key.  After "refining", Output observed to be a solid steel sphere with the same volume as the original steel block.  Original gear returned to SCP-914.

**Notes:**  //Well, thank god we can at least repair the damn thing if we damage it...assuming we can find what's broken in it.  Hell, maybe it's already broken, i don't know...this damn thing hurts my head...

**Input:** One (1) copy of "//Metroid Prime 3: Corruption//" (PAL-Version)
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** [DATA EXPUNGED] Software scheduled for further examination; it appears highly addictive and may be potentially hazardous to the health of its players, as anyone using it appears to abandon survival in favour of continued usage.

//Note: Improvement of personal items and affects, as well as objects for use in daily life, is hereby heavily restricted. Import a limited edition from Japan or something.//

**Input:** One (1) orange
**Setting:** 1:1 
**Output:** One (1) tomato

**Input:** One (1) orange
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A small bottle of orange concentrate. The label describes it as "1:1000" in potency. Chemical analysis incomplete as of now.

**Input:** One (1) orange
**Setting:** Very Fine.
**Output:** [DATA EXPUNGED]. Object had to be incinerated in order to stop it from singing and dancing. Whilst it appeared non-aggressive, the perpetual, deeply irritating song-and-dance number performed by the Object lead me to conclude that it was of no further use.

Addendum 1: The... arange appears to have been successful in leaving its cane behind during transportation to the incinerator. (Careless D-Personnel has been punished) The cane has, in the timespan of approximately thirty (30) minutes grown into a small tree, on which little top hat shaped blossoms appeared after a short while. All of them have been pollinated, aparently by the tree itself. Now we have approximately 50 of those little buggers running around the facility.
SCP-914 appears to have adopted a dadaistic approach. This is truly ridiculous.

**Output:** Single sheet of paper.  Weight is exactly the same as the entered documentation.  The sheet appears to be be a single page from the entered SCP-914 documentation, however when flipped over to the right, the reverse side is the following page in sequence.  When flipped over to the left, the opposite side is the preceding page in sequence.  No new documentation is included, however this item is significantly easier to store, if more time consuming to browse.

//(**Memo from General ████████:**  It's screwing with us, you know that right?  I don't CARE if it's been proven that it has no self-awareness, this thing is LAUGHING at us!)//

**Name:** Dr. Restov et al
**Date:** ██/█/20██
**Total items:** (6) sets photocopies and duplicates of lab notes and other research material on SCP-914.

//Dr. Gears took my suggestion to heart and put it into action, but the results were not the glorious revelation I had hoped for.  I have requested and received permission to carry on experiments in the same vein.//

**Input:** 1x set of research materials
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One formal report book, 22cm x 30cm, 420 pages, bound with a clear plastic protective cover.  Book contains all lab reports on SCP-914 assembled to date, apparently created on a word processor and printed with a color laser printer.  Fonts used do not conform to any fonts currently installed on SCP Foundation computers.  Each lab report contains more elaborate information, more detailed descriptions, and more precise measurements than were in the input material.  The contents of the report are extensively cross-referenced, and there is a thorough index in the back.  Spot-checking 40 randomly selected details that could be re-examined by our team, the more detailed information in the output was confirmed to be correct in all 40 cases.

The report book has been labeled "SCP-914 Output ██/█/20██-a" and added to research materials.  //Note: information therein should be confirmed before being deemed reliable.//

**Input:** 1x set of research materials
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One leatherbound tome, 54cm x 42cm, 256 vellum pages, with title written in gold leaf.  Language of the title and the contents were at first unidentifiable, and were later discovered to be an old dialect of Finnish.  The contents are written in calligraphy, and more than half the pages are elaborately illuminated with colored inks and gold and silver leaf.  Once translated, the contents proved to be identical to the contents of the input material, arranged chronologically.  The tome has been radiocarbon dated to the early 11th century C.E.

Anachronistically, a leather pocket is sewn into the inside back cover, and this pocket contains what appears to be a modern compact disc, 10cm in diameter.  Data on this disc is encoded by an unknown codec.  Attempts to divine the codec and decipher the data are ongoing.

//Note: It's a pity the contents of this tome are classified.  It's a piece worthy of any museum.  I've never seen such exquisite calligraphy.  The illuminations may prove to be the most interesting part of the book, though.  They often portray clockworks and related mechanical parts as well as some of the input or output objects; possibly they relate in a direct rather than abstract way to the operation of 914 as described on the illuminated pages.//

The tome has been labeled "SCP-914 Output ██/█/20██-b" and added to research materials.  It has been flagged for further study.

**Input:** 1x set of research materials
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A collection of unredacted notes, photographs, and other media related to SCP-████, which does not yet appear in the Foundation's catalogue of known SCPs.  Dates contained within the output material start at ██/██/████, yet in the future as of this report.  No personnel named in the material are current employees or associates of the SCP Foundation, save for Dr. █████ ██████████.  When interviewed, Dr. ██████████ denied any knowledge of the material, and handwriting analysis has confirmed that the information attributed to him was not written by the current Foundation employee.  //Note: this is probably just a coincidence of names.//

In accordance with established protocols, an alert of a potential temporal anomaly has been raised.  O5-level personnel have been informed, and the output material (designated "SCP-914 Output ██/█/20██-c") has been classified and put into secure storage.

**Input:** 1x set of research materials
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One cardboard box, 40cm x 65cm x 24cm, white.  Contents are (15) manila folders containing detailed internal security notes, psychological profiles, and logs of covert monitoring of (15) different, current SCP Foundation personnel.  Output materials were confiscated and later reported to have been destroyed.  Accuracy or inaccuracy of the information contained therein could not be verified.

//Now switching to the "Very Fine" setting.  Perhaps we'll get more useful results.  Only persistence will tell.//

**Input:** 1x set of research materials
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A set of (36) laminated posters, 80cm tall x 121cm wide.  When arranged into a 4-wide by 9-tall rectangle, the posters form an animated image of interlocking gears in motion.  The posters can be rearranged into any order of 4x9 pattern, and each arrangement portrays a different animated image of functioning clockworks.  The animations appear to have no direct connection to SCP-914; they always appear in motion, even when -914 is idle.  They may not even be showing the workings of -914, in any state.  The team is still working on theories for what we're seeing.

The posters have been labeled "SCP-914 Output ██/█/20██-d" and added to research materials.  They have been flagged for further study.

**Input:** 1x set of research materials
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One PDA containing a single document file, written in an undetermined language.  PDA is heavy for its size.  Lab technician █████ ██████ visually scanned through the file from beginning to end, then went into a catatonic state.  Technician is completely unresponsive, save that whenever someone speaks directly to him, he replies with a statement that appears to be an alteration or refinement of whatever was spoken to him.  He has been taken to Medical for treatment and observation.  PDA has been labeled "SCP-914 Output ██/█/20██-e," labeled as dangerous and added to research materials.

//Note: It's as though ██████ has become some sort of human linguistic -914.  It's a curious effect for a written document to have.  Still, he might provide some useful insights into how SCP-914 works, or at least how its designers thought.//

**Name:** Agent T█████
**Date:** ███/██/████
**Total Items:** (1) copy of World of Warcraft Atlas

//This is the first iterative test of SCP-914. The result has been interesting.//

**Input:** (1) copy of World of Warcraft Atlas
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A leather-covered version of the original, with vellum pages and metal reinforcements on the corners of the cover. The language is still English, but the printing now appears to be calligraphic, in the Gothic Black style.

**Input:** The altered atlas from the above test
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** The book now has a lock. Fortunately, a key was included. The maps are now of higher quality, more numerous, and more detailed. A scale is now included on all maps, and the cities cover larger areas and are more detailed. The pages are thinner, but more numerous.

**Input:** The altered atlas from the above test, and its cover key.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** The book has even finer pages now, with cabochons on the cover. The language could not be immediately identified, but photographs later analyzed showed it to be English, in an unknown typeface. The key is more complex.

**Input:** As above
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** The pages have become even thinner, and still more numerous. Now the maps include latitude and longitude, their number and level of detail have increased, and the illustrations of animate things are themselves animate. Unlike [[[SCP-085]]], they do not show evidence of sentience, and do not stray from their positions. The maps are now extremely detailed, showing many settlements not included in any Warcraft supplement or official lore. The language, from studies of photographs, could not be identified with certainty.

**Input**: As above
**Setting**: Fine
**Output:** Still an atlas of Azeroth, but now the illustrations are holographic as well as animate, the binding has become lay-flat, and a leather pocket on the inside back contains a CD-ROM labelled "Atlas of Azeroth, compiled by the Explorer's League of Ironforge. Printed with the assistance of Togglescrew, Switchback, and Buzzbolt, Gnomeregan." The atlas now appears to be written in an archaic dialect of its reader's primary language, in a calligraphic style associated with the relevant culture's medieval period. Photographs taken using purely automatic robots has shown no meaningful printing. Remotely operated cameras show the book in the operator's primary language. The contents of the disc are not encoded in any standard format. Study of the CD-ROM is ongoing. This final version has been labelled as "SCP-914 Output █/██/20█-f." 

//Update: When reexamined in 20█ and 20█, the atlas had grown in thickness. It now contains information on all areas of Azeroth added in each game expansion.//

//Personal log, Agent T███: This thing is beautiful. Absolutely gorgeous, the calligraphy alone is incredible. Ironically, it's so beautiful and detailed a representation of Azeroth as a real word that it's become nearly useless for playing the game. And frankly, the illustrations creep me out.//
