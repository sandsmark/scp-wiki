**Test 11828-U5:** Tests on the nature and construction of SCP-914

With approval from 05 Command, A single gear was removed from one of the "outer" sections of SCP-914. Placement was carefully documented, and was in a location that would not release tension on any belts, or damage any documented sections. Testing area was cleared and sealed after placing a steel block in the "intake" booth. D-00104 was dispatched to SCP-914, and instructed to turn the key and activate SCP-914.

D-00104 reported that "the key won't catch", and it was observed the key turned several times without tightening the mainspring. No activity of any kind was observed from SCP-914 during this time.

Missing gear was replaced with a identical copy, comprised of the same metal (brass) as the original. Steel block re-inserted into the "intake" booth, and SCP-914 was activated on the "1:1" setting. SCP-914 observed to operate normally, with a slight pause of 3.5 seconds after winding the key. After "refining", Output observed to be a solid steel sphere with the same volume as the original steel block. Original gear returned to SCP-914.

**Notes:** //Well, thank god we can at least repair the damn thing if we damage it...assuming we can find what's broken in it. Hell, maybe it's already broken, I don't know...this damn thing hurts my head...

**Total items:** 4x clockwork pocket watch, belonging to Dr.Gears

**Input:** 1x gold-plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Small clockwork bird. When the tail is pressed, it produces a robin's call.

**Input:** 1x gold-plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Toy clockwork train engine.

**Input:** 1 gold-plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Miniature grandfather clock, fully functional.

**Input:** 1 gold-plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Small metal sculpture of a piano.

//Notes from Dr. Gears:// It appears there is a high level of randomness when SCP-914 "refines" an item. However, it seems to preserve some element of its original composition, in this example, clockworks. This is not a law, but a high probability. Refine a metal bar, and you're more likely to get a simple metal object than a internal combustion engine. Both, however, are possible.

**Name:** Dr. Gears
**Date:**██/██/████
**Total number of objects:** Three (3) copies of all documentation, photographs, and test logs accumulated in relation to SCP-914.

**Input:** One (1) Copy of SCP-914 documentation
**Setting:** 1:1 
**Output:** Folder containing all previously entered documents, arranged in chronological order.

**Input:** One (1) Copy of SCP-914 documentation
**Setting:** Fine 
**Output:** Hard-bound book containing 400 pages. No diagrams, photos, or other visual aids of any kind are included. The pages appear to be solid black, but microscopic examination shows each page to be covered in approximately twenty thousand characters. The text has no correlation with any known writing style, and is not in a linear format, with "sentences" constructed from individual characters spread out between many pages. Each sentence requires an exceedingly complex formula to decode, with each formula unique to each sentence. //(Note: Current decoding work has resulted in two partially translated sentences after 225 work-hours. Item appears to be a record of the internal structure of SCP-914)//

**Input:** One (1) Copy of SCP-914 documentation
**Setting:** Very Fine 
**Output:** Single sheet of paper. Weight is exactly the same as the entered documentation. The sheet appears to be a single page from the entered SCP-914 documentation, however when flipped over to the right, the reverse side is the following page in sequence. When flipped over to the left, the opposite side is the preceding page in sequence. No new documentation is included, however this item is significantly easier to store, if more time-consuming to browse.

//(**Memo from General ████████:** It's screwing with us, you know that right? I don't CARE if it's been proven that it has no self-awareness, this thing is LAUGHING at us!)//

//Note from Dr. Gears//: There seems to be some difficulty as to the meaning of "fine" and "coarse" on the settings; the machine appears to be capable of refining input based either on a scale of complexity (loss of entropy accompanied by increase in connectivity between components and/or acquisition of subjective meaning) or of simplification (separation into composite materials and loss of meaning).

**Total items:** One (1) set photocopies and duplicates of lab notes and other research material on SCP-914.

**Input:** 1x set of research materials
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One leather-bound tome, 54cm x 42cm, 256 vellum pages, with title written in gold leaf. Language of the title and the contents were at first unidentifiable, and were later discovered to be an old dialect of Finnish. The contents are written in calligraphy, and more than half the pages are elaborately illuminated with colored inks and gold and silver leaf. Once translated, the contents proved to be identical to the contents of the input material, arranged chronologically. The tome has been radiocarbon dated to the early 11th century C.E.

Anachronistically, a leather pocket is sewn into the inside back cover, and this pocket contains what appears to be a modern compact disc, 10cm in diameter. Data on this disc is encoded by an unknown codec. Attempts to divine the codec and decipher the data are ongoing.

//Note: It's a pity the contents of this tome are classified. It's a piece worthy of any museum. I've never seen such exquisite calligraphy. The illuminations may prove to be the most interesting part of the book, though. They often portray clockworks and related mechanical parts as well as some of the input or output objects; possibly they relate in a direct rather than abstract way to the operation of SCP-914 as described on the illuminated pages.//

**Input:** A copy of said blueprints and required materials.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One (1) replica of the weapon, the weapon's blueprints left in untouched state, and various pieces of scrapped metal, carbon and synthetic rubber from the inserted materials. The weapon functioned normally and on dissasembly and closer inspection was revealed to be an excact fabricate from the blueprint, with average fabrication precicions of averagely ten-thousand's of a millimetre.

//Note: Dr. S. Comrie: "As we can see in the previous experiments with SCP-914, in all but a few isolated cases, the object's output were all consisting of roughly the same materials and quantities as the input. Which makes sense as SCP-914 probably can't make matter "out of thin air". However, as we expected, when provided with the required materials the object can be used to fabricate things."//

**Input:**  A recipe of --Simon Nan's delicious-- apple pie and it's required ingredients
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** After approximately fifteen (15) minutes of loud mechanical noises SCP-914's output cabinet opened and revealed a hot appelpie and scraps from its baking process such as apple peels and cores. On closer inspection the pie showed many flaws and inconcistencies, "as if prepared by a clumsy robot".

//Note: Dr. M. Thornwood: "As this experiment proves, the same that goes for the manufacturing of objects by SCP-914 from blueprints, goes for it "cooking from the book". What's particularly interesting is the shape of the pie. the ingredients look overly scattered, the apple slices and dough rolls neatly cut, and so on. It looks as if SCP-914 actually read the recipe and attempted to follow its instructions."
Post scriptum: "Simon's grandmother must've been really formidable at making pies."//

This text is written in English on one page, and a form of early Daevic that is readable on the other. It describes the rise of a river civilization along the Shebelle and Jubba river. Ironically, Script 1050ℵ is mentioned as being only significant as the first recorded mention of this civilization. Estimates from these books suggest a time frame of 102███-95███ BC for the reign of this civilization, though far older estimates could be drawn from some of the more esoteric parts of the book series.  

//Dr. Kurjak: "We could use this process to, in the future, try to decipher other unknown texts. Plus, it is incredible that we push back modern human psychology that far. Too bad nobody in the actual scientific community will ever see this. I personally recommend taking a field trip to [[[SCP-1726]]] to try to find some more information, but even they might have nothing on this civilization due to the time. I have placed the encyclopedia and the phrasebook with SCP-1050."//

**Date:** 3/20/17
**Total Items:** Three (3) 9mm magazines for a standard Glock 19.

**Input:** One (1) magazine as stated above.
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One (1) magazine for the UMP45, with the same amount of ammunition, causing the magazine to be somewhat empty.

**Input:** One (1) magazine as stated above.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One (1) magazine, seemingly identical to the input.  When fired, it seemed to have no effect on a target in the shooting range.  Upon being granted a D-Class to experiment on, the effect became apparent.  When fired at a human target, the target experiences traumatic memories of being shot and will fully believe that they have been shot, and will disregard others trying to tell them otherwise.  

//Note: Possible use for interrogation by the Foundation? -Dr. Ursini//

**Input:** One (1) magazine as stated above.
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** When fired, the bullets actively seek out a human target.  However, the bullet still loses velocity as per normal, and the turning speed of the bullet can cause it to orbit around a human until it loses all kinetic energy.  

//Note: Testing further with that magazine denied.  We can't risk it flying through the corridors and causing a containment breach. -Dr Ursini.//

**Total Items**: 2 unbranded electronic bubble blowers, 1 unbranded "bubble wand" and 3 canisters that contain 250 ml of hydrochloric acid.

**Input**: 1 electronic bubble blower, 1 canister of hydrochloric acid.
**Setting**: Fine
**Output**: 1 250 ml canister of a clear, unidentified substance. When placed on any object, said object will begin to turn into bubbles at a rate similar to the speed hydrochloric acid would dissolve an object.

**Input**: 1 bubble wand, 1 canister of hydrochloric acid. 
**Setting**: Very Fine
**Output**: A bubble wand requires no outside source of replenishment. Popping bubbles created by it result in the bubble instantly releasing an unknown acid. Said acid is capable of dissolving an entire human body in [REDACTED] seconds, and is completely undetectable to the naked eye. Currently stored in the on-site armory for further study.

**Input**: 1 electronic bubble blower, 1 canister of hydrochloric acid.
**Setting**: Very Fine
**Output**: A single bubble blower that appears to be slightly melted, and requires no external ammunition. When fired, it produces many small bubbles that burn flesh when touched, and gradually lose velocity over time, coming to a stop in the air, unaffected by gravitational force. Bubbles created can last longer than 3 minutes, and greatly increase duration when near other bubbles. Using this, it is possible to create a wall of bubbles that can last upward of 12 hours. Currently stored in the on-site armory for further study.

**Output:** One (1) ████████-readable physical storage medium

//Note 1: 03/31/10 - Object initially unreadable. However, after eight months of development, a prototype for a new kind of storage reader (████████) was built by Foundation researchers. Upon successful reading, researchers found object to contain a bewildering array of data. Dr. ██████ estimated that 99.999926% of content is entire raw, non-anomalous █████ ███ █████ ██████ ██ ███ █████ ████ dating back to roughly 1877. The new unit of storage also features a 30-hour-long documentary series ("A History Tinted Green") which explores how "The Matrix" fits into this timeline. Various figures are interviewed in a featureless white room by what appears to be a young K█████ R█████. Of note is a joint interview of Samuel Clemens and Joseph Campbell.//

//Note 2: 04/01/10 - Dr. █████, a noted film enthusiast, entered a destructively excited emotional state upon learning of breadth of content, and, for project's protection, has been denied access to lab for study's duration. Requests for specific data from the object, however, are not to be rejected. No extraordinary data handling rules currently require enforcement, although this may change if Dr. █████'s interest becomes a dangerous obsession.//

**Input:** 1 (1) Sony FDR-AX33 4K Handycam Camcorder, set to 'record'. 
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** 1 (1) unidentified camera, set to 'record'. Footage commences one second before the machine's doors open; nothing of the internal components is visible. The camera does not exhibit any anomalous properties, but pictures taken with it have no zoom limit; that is, one can zoom into them on a standard piece of photo-editing software and never reach individual pixels.

//Note: Could be handy for surveillance - I'll leave it in the Site 21 Armoury. - Dr. Blaze//

//Note: Well, it looks like any attempts to record the internal mechanisms of SCP-914 is futile. Unless anyone else has any ideas, I'm closing this round of testing.
