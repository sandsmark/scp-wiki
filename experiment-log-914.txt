**Test 11828-U5:** Tests on the nature and construction of SCP-914

With approval from 05 Command, A single gear was removed from one of the "outer" sections of SCP-914. Placement was carefully documented, and was in a location that would not release tension on any belts, or damage any documented sections. Testing area was cleared and sealed after placing a steel block in the "intake" booth. D-00104 was dispatched to SCP-914, and instructed to turn the key and activate SCP-914.

D-00104 reported that "the key won't catch", and it was observed the key turned several times without tightening the mainspring. No activity of any kind was observed from SCP-914 during this time.

Missing gear was replaced with a identical copy, comprised of the same metal (brass) as the original. Steel block re-inserted into the "intake" booth, and SCP-914 was activated on the "1:1" setting. SCP-914 observed to operate normally, with a slight pause of 3.5 seconds after winding the key. After "refining", Output observed to be a solid steel sphere with the same volume as the original steel block. Original gear returned to SCP-914.

**Notes:** //Well, thank god we can at least repair the damn thing if we damage it...assuming we can find what's broken in it. Hell, maybe it's already broken, I don't know...this damn thing hurts my head...

**Total items:** 4x clockwork pocket watch, belonging to Dr.Gears

**Input:** 1x gold-plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Small clockwork bird. When the tail is pressed, it produces a robin's call.

**Input:** 1x gold-plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Toy clockwork train engine.

**Input:** 1 gold-plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Miniature grandfather clock, fully functional.

**Input:** 1 gold-plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Small metal sculpture of a piano.

//Notes from Dr. Gears:// It appears there is a high level of randomness when SCP-914 "refines" an item. However, it seems to preserve some element of its original composition, in this example, clockworks. This is not a law, but a high probability. Refine a metal bar, and you're more likely to get a simple metal object than a internal combustion engine. Both, however, are possible.

**Name:** Dr. Gears
**Date:**██/██/████
**Total number of objects:** Three (3) copies of all documentation, photographs, and test logs accumulated in relation to SCP-914.

**Input:** One (1) Copy of SCP-914 documentation
**Setting:** 1:1 
**Output:** Folder containing all previously entered documents, arranged in chronological order.

**Input:** One (1) Copy of SCP-914 documentation
**Setting:** Fine 
**Output:** Hard-bound book containing 400 pages. No diagrams, photos, or other visual aids of any kind are included. The pages appear to be solid black, but microscopic examination shows each page to be covered in approximately twenty thousand characters. The text has no correlation with any known writing style, and is not in a linear format, with "sentences" constructed from individual characters spread out between many pages. Each sentence requires an exceedingly complex formula to decode, with each formula unique to each sentence. //(Note: Current decoding work has resulted in two partially translated sentences after 225 work-hours. Item appears to be a record of the internal structure of SCP-914)//

**Input:** One (1) Copy of SCP-914 documentation
**Setting:** Very Fine 
**Output:** Single sheet of paper. Weight is exactly the same as the entered documentation. The sheet appears to be a single page from the entered SCP-914 documentation, however when flipped over to the right, the reverse side is the following page in sequence. When flipped over to the left, the opposite side is the preceding page in sequence. No new documentation is included, however this item is significantly easier to store, if more time-consuming to browse.

//(**Memo from General ████████:** It's screwing with us, you know that right? I don't CARE if it's been proven that it has no self-awareness, this thing is LAUGHING at us!)//

//Note from Dr. Gears//: There seems to be some difficulty as to the meaning of "fine" and "coarse" on the settings; the machine appears to be capable of refining input based either on a scale of complexity (loss of entropy accompanied by increase in connectivity between components and/or acquisition of subjective meaning) or of simplification (separation into composite materials and loss of meaning).

**Total items:** One (1) set photocopies and duplicates of lab notes and other research material on SCP-914.

**Input:** 1x set of research materials
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One leather-bound tome, 54cm x 42cm, 256 vellum pages, with title written in gold leaf. Language of the title and the contents were at first unidentifiable, and were later discovered to be an old dialect of Finnish. The contents are written in calligraphy, and more than half the pages are elaborately illuminated with colored inks and gold and silver leaf. Once translated, the contents proved to be identical to the contents of the input material, arranged chronologically. The tome has been radiocarbon dated to the early 11th century C.E.

Anachronistically, a leather pocket is sewn into the inside back cover, and this pocket contains what appears to be a modern compact disc, 10cm in diameter. Data on this disc is encoded by an unknown codec. Attempts to divine the codec and decipher the data are ongoing.

//Note: It's a pity the contents of this tome are classified. It's a piece worthy of any museum. I've never seen such exquisite calligraphy. The illuminations may prove to be the most interesting part of the book, though. They often portray clockworks and related mechanical parts as well as some of the input or output objects; possibly they relate in a direct rather than abstract way to the operation of SCP-914 as described on the illuminated pages.//

The weapon functioned normally and on dissasembly and closer inspection was revealed to be an excact fabricate from the blueprint, with average fabrication precicions of averagely ten-thousand's of a millimetre.

//Note: Dr. S. Comrie: "As we can see in the previous experiments with SCP-914, in all but a few isolated cases, the object's output were all consisting of roughly the same materials and quantities as the input. Which makes sense as SCP-914 probably can't make matter "out of thin air". However, as we expected, when provided with the required materials the object can be used to fabricate things."//

**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** After approximately fifteen (15) minutes of loud mechanical noises SCP-914's output cabinet opened and revealed a hot appelpie and scraps from its baking process such as apple peels and cores. On closer inspection the pie showed many flaws and inconcistencies, "as if prepared by a clumsy robot".

//Note: Dr. M. Thornwood: "As this experiment proves, the same that goes for the manufacturing of objects by SCP-914 from blueprints, goes for it "cooking from the book". What's particularly interesting is the shape of the pie. the ingredients look overly scattered, the apple slices and dough rolls neatly cut, and so on. It looks as if SCP-914 actually read the recipe and attempted to follow its instructions."
Post scriptum: "Simon's grandmother must've been really formidable at making pies."//

Estimates from these books suggest a time frame of 102███-95███ BC for the reign of this civilization, though far older estimates could be drawn from some of the more esoteric parts of the book series.  

//Dr. Kurjak: "We could use this process to, in the future, try to decipher other mysterious texts. Plus, it is incredible that we push back modern human psychology that far. Too bad nobody in the actual scientific community will ever see this. I personally recommend taking a field trip to SCP-1726 to try to find some more information, but even they might have nothing on this civilization due to the time. I have placed the encyclopedia and the phrasebook with SCP-1050."//

**Output:** One (1)seemingly normal G36 with both magazines.The internal workings of the gun have been switched for circuit boards, the outer shell appearing to be made out of the same plastic the input phone was made out of and the attached sight acting as a screen. The trigger acts as the on/off switch, the magazines are used as a power source and the screen is used via touch-input

//Note: Apparently 914 can combine Objects  into one object that looks like one but works like the other .I'm asking for permission for private use of the "Hecklerwei P36 Lite" as i like to refer to it
-Dr.Corsini//
//Permission granted for usage inside his office only//

**Input:**One (1)Smartphone, One (1)G36 assault rifle and both magazines
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:**One (1)seemingly normal G36 with one magazine. Upon pulling the trigger it charges up for approximately 3 seconds before emitting a blue ray comprised of ultra heated plasma. The ray has a maximum length of roughly 25 meters and burns through any solid at about ██████ kelvin 
Currently stored in the On-site Armoury 

//Note: That was a nice lightshow. And it managed to get through ██ meters of reinforced steel armour plates. That's what I call German engineering
Dr.Corsini// 

**Input:**One (1)Smartphone, One (1)G36 assault rifle and both magazines
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One (1)seemingly normal Huawei P8 Lite Smartphone. Upon pressing the power button it will shoot 5,56 × 45 mm NATO Ammunition out of the AUX-port at the same Rate of fire as a standard G36.
Currently stored in the On-site Armoury 
//Upon trying to boot it up Dr. Corsini accidentally discharged 5 bullets wounding █ of the by-standing personell and himself with the shrapnel caused by the bullets impacting the walls of the Test room//

//Note: Could have guessed it works both ways. Let's not try that again.
-Dr.Corsini//

**Input:** Three (3)AA Batteries, One (1)Smartphone
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One (1)Smartphone worked at three time the speed and power efficient as its unmodified counterpart. Also the capacity of its Lithium-ion battery was 3 times higher than before the test (tested on an unmodified phone)
//Note:Nice. Now we know that normal AA-Batteries can enhance electronics. Might write that down for future experiments. Also I'm gonna keep that phone.
-Dr.Corsini//

**Input:** Three (3)AA Batteries, One (1)Smartphone, One (1)G36 assault rifle and both magazines
**Setting:** Very fine
**Output** One (1) G36 with only one magazine. The optics of the gun are capable of displaying all wavelenght on the EM-Spectrum. When set to single-fire it works similar to the G36 modified in the test above. When set to full-auto it shoots a ray of [DATA EXPUNGED] wich has a length of ████ Meters and [DATA EXPUNGED] inorganic matter at about ██ Megakelvin. 
When used against organic matter the ray changes the structure of the [DATA EXPUNGED] and [DATA EXPUNGED] wich results in rapid growth of the [DATA EXPUNGED],[DATA EXPUNGED] and the [DATA EXPUNGED]. This is joined by [DATA EXPUNGED]. This makes the target capable of short distance teleportation, telepathy and [DATA EXPUNGED]. First test of the weapon led to the [DATA EXPUNGED] of ██ D-Class personel wich resulted in a [DATA EXPUNGED] of over ███ individuals. The resulting entity teleported to [DATA EXPUNGED], approximately  █ light-hours away from Earth. It is now classified as SCP-████
Class-E Amnesiacs were administered to the survivors on site
//Note: I think i won't play god with weapons anymore... I still have nightmares of this...monstrosity

**Total Items:** Dr.Corsinis Custom built home PC, ten (10) AA Batteries, One (1) D-Cell Battery

**Input:** Items listed above
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One (1) PC looking like the input PC. The components of the PC are not visible and the case can not be opened. It does not require a powerinput as it produces the power it needs through unknown means. The clockspeed of the CPU and GPU have increased at a factor of about ████times compared to the original. The amount of RAM and VRAM has also been increased to about █████ time its original value. It does not emit heat and the inside of the PC was measured at around 0,00█████ K speeding up the calculations of the seperate processing units up even more. The storage capacity of it's  harddrives is estimated to be close to, if not [DATA REDACTED]. It is currently standing in Dr.Corsinis quarters where it doubles as a personal computer and the mainframe of the facility

**Name:** Dr. Watterson
**Date:** 2-8-17
**Total Items:** Four (4) Polaroid images of [[[SCP-096]]]. Testing cleared by O5 Command.

//Note: SCP-096 was moved to a makeshift container outside of SCP-914's chamber. All doors leading to SCP-914 were open for the duration of the test. The surrounding area was evacuated one our prior to and following testing. Four Class-D personnel were on site and tasked with carrying out tests. All four personnel were equipped with a wireless electrical kill collar for enforcing disciplinary action and minimizing difficulty in termination in the event of an accidental viewing of the image.//

**Input:** One image of SCP-096
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** A thin strip of wood, as well as a small puddle of ink. Product did not induce a hostile reaction from SCP-096.

**Input:** One image of SCP-096
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A picture of a homeless man sitting under a stop sign. Sign was in Arabic. Product did not induce a hostile reaction from SCP-096.

**Input:** One image of SCP-096
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A stylistic bobblehead doll of SCP-096, designed to look "young and hella cute" as described D-78819. Every time someone looked away and looked back at it, its facial expression changed. Product did not induce a hostile responce, although echolocators inside its cell showed it to glance over towards D-78819 every time she looked at the bobblehead.

**Input:** One image of SCP-096
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** Seemingly the same image. D-78819 was instructed to look at the image. After she did, SCP-096 stood up and began screaming as per usual. However, after it was done doing this, instead of running towards D-78819, it "pulled a sombrero out of nowhere and began dancing to mariachi music." Echolocators in its cell, as well as an audio recorder, were able to confirm this. SCP-096 did this for 15 minutes before taking off the sombrero, which halted the music and disappeared completely. SCP-096 then ran towards D-78819 and [DATA EXPUNGED] per usual.

//Note: Following this experiment, SCP-096 was contained without incident by MTF Eta-10 "See No Evil". All products of this experiment have been contained in a safe in SCP-096's chamber. Janitorial staff cleaned up results of final experiment. Testing was concluded for the day.//
