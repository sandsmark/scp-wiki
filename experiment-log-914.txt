**Name:**Dr. V███  Palmer
**Date:** ██/██/20██

**Total Items:** 80 doses of MDMA (150 mg dosage), 80 doses of gelatin LSD, high potency solution  (150 ug dosage), and 40 doses of Sildenafil [trademark, "Viagra"] (50 mg dosage).

**Input:**  20 doses MDMA, 20 does of LSD, 
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** A small pile of powder weighing approximately 165 mg. Chemical composition identical to input.

**Input:**  20 doses MDMA, 20 does of LSD
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:**  Twenty (20) 160 mg gel capsules, yellow-green in color. One (1) capsule administered to male D-class test subject, resulting in subject experiencing effects of intense euphoria, marked improvement in mood, and some psychedelic visuals after a period of 25 minutes. Effects lasted for 10 hours, after which subject experienced a "crash" with symptoms of a bad hangover and severe depression lasting for a two week period. More tests pending, but effect seems to be a combination of both drugs with a more severe "crash" period than unrefined MDMA. 

**Input:**  20 doses MDMA, 20 does of LSD, and 20 doses "Viagra" 
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One hundred (100) 16.5 µg gel capsules, opalescent yellow in color. One (1) capsule administered to female D-class test subject, resulting in intense euphoria, a feeling of "serenity", and had a strong desire to be in close physical contact with others, with onset occur after a period of 5 minutes. Subject remained in this state for a period of 78 hours, after which subject entered a catatonic state lasting a period of nearly four weeks. Subject showed extreme hostility after awakening and appeared to be in intense pain. Subject was terminated then autopsied, revealing that pleasure centers in her brain were severely damaged and testosterone levels were increased. More tests pending.

**Input:**  20 doses MDMA, 20 does of LSD, and 20 doses "Viagra" 
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One hundred (100) 17µg gel capsules, golden and luminescent. One (1) capsule administered to male D-class test subject, with effects identical to "Fine" output appearing after 30 seconds. Subject was very docile and, while coherent, would not answer questions. After 15 minutes, subject entered a catatonic state for a period of 74 hours during which time subject was observed to have seizures resulting in ejaculation. Upon awakening, subject displayed a marked deadening of emotion, showed no interest in pleasurable activities, and was unable to be sexually aroused. When interviewed, subject stated he "just didn't care anymore". Subject terminated and autopsied, show sever damage specific to emotional centers of the brain. More tests pending. 

//Note: While there may be possible therapeutic benefits to the "Fine" and "Very Fine" outputs, I suggest that more tests be run on subjects of both genders. The output results are to be kept in my office safe unless being tested.// -Dr. Palmer

//Wait, how does that even work? Viagra is a vascular dilator thingie, not an aphrodisiac.//

**Name:** Dr. P██████ Gibbons
**Date:** [DATA EXPUNGED]
**Total items:** 5x regular cubes of Telekill Alloy [[[SCP-148]]], with a volume of 0.4 cubic meters, making a total of 2 (Two) cubic meters.

**Input:** 1x cube of Telekill Alloy for each setting.

**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** 25x regular cubes of Telekill Alloy, each with a volume of 0.016 cubic meters

**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** 1x cube of unknown dark-blue metal, with a volume of 0.2 cubic meters. The fact that it's two times smaller to the original input cube suggests that the density of the material is two times greater than the Telekill Alloy. With an original melting point of 700ºC, and an evaporation point of 1400ºC, it has been noticed that, if temperature of the metal reaches below 0ºC, the color of the metal changes to a lighter blue and physical properties change. This metal has an unknown melting point, as focused, concentrated heat of over 20000ºC has not melted it. Catalogation for SCP has been raised to 05-7 personnel and denied.


**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** 1x cube of unknown light-red metal, with a volume of 1.2 cubic meters. Size is three times that of the original input, suggesting that the input Telekill Alloy is three times more dense than the output. Metal has a melting point of 700ºC and an evaporation point of 1400ºC, matching with the 'Coarse' output, although does not show the same physical properties change when reaching 0ºC, like the previous output. Metal, when touched by a sentient human being, inhibits all senses for a period of 30 (thirty) minutes after the first time is touched (that is, if the object is held for 5 seconds, the period of inhibition will last 30 minutes and 5 seconds). Witnesses have later described it as a "VERY unpleasant experience," and also manifested sensations of "wild hallucinations," similar to a near-overdose of Lysergic Acid. --SCP catalogation pending.-- //SCP catalogation approved by O5-█, Output now known as [[[SCP-506]]].//

//The 30 scariest minutes of my fucking life. Note to self: Use the damn gloves. Second note to self: Ask Clef if he wants bracelets of this for his birthday. -Dr. Gibbons//

**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Sculpture resembling [[[SCP-682]]] made out of Telekill Alloy, with a volume 0.4 cubic meters. Output has not shown any kind of sentient manifestations, although any contact or approach near [[[SCP-682]]] is denied until further notice.

//Now, I would like this for my dekstop, if you don't mind. -Dr. Gibbons//

**Test 11828-U5:** Tests on the nature and construction of SCP-914

With approval from 05 Command, A single gear was removed from one of the "outer" sections of SCP-914.  Placement was carefully documented, and was in a location that would not release tension on any belts, or damage any documented sections.  Testing area was cleared and sealed after placing a steel block in the "intake" booth.  D-00104 was dispatched to SCP-914, and instructed to turn the key and activate SCP-914.

D-00104 reported that "the key won't catch", and it was observed the key turned several times without tightening the mainspring.  No activity of any kind was observed from SCP-914 during this time.

Missing gear was replaced with a identical copy, comprised of the same metal (brass) as the original.  Steel block re-inserted into the "intake" booth, and SCP-914 was activated on the "1:1" setting.  SCP-914 observed to operate normally, with a slight pause of 3.5 seconds after winding the key.  After "refining", Output observed to be a solid steel sphere with the same volume as the original steel block.  Original gear returned to SCP-914.

**Notes:**  //Well, thank god we can at least repair the damn thing if we damage it...assuming we can find what's broken in it.  Hell, maybe it's already broken, i don't know...this damn thing hurts my head...

**Input:** One (1) copy of "//Metroid Prime 3: Corruption//" (PAL-Version)
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** [DATA EXPUNGED] Software scheduled for further examination; it appears highly addictive and may be potentially hazardous to the health of its players, as anyone using it appears to abandon survival in favor of continued usage.

//Note: Improvement of personal items and affects, as well as objects for use in daily life, is hereby heavily restricted. Import a limited edition from Japan or something.//

**Input:** One (1) orange
**Setting:** 1:1 
**Output:** One (1) tomato

**Input:** One (1) orange
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A small bottle of orange concentrate. The label describes it as "1:1000" in potency. Chemical analysis incomplete as of now.

**Input:** One (1) orange
**Setting:** Very Fine.
**Output:** [DATA EXPUNGED]. Object had to be incinerated in order to stop it from singing and dancing. Whilst it appeared non-aggressive, the perpetual, deeply irritating song-and-dance number performed by the Object lead me to conclude that it was of no further use.

Addendum 1: The... orange appears to have been successful in leaving its cane behind during transportation to the incinerator. (Careless D-Personnel has been punished) The cane has, in the timespan of approximately thirty (30) minutes grown into a small tree, on which little top hat shaped blossoms appeared after a short while. All of them have been pollinated, apparently by the tree itself. Now we have approximately 50 of those little buggers running around the facility.
SCP-914 appears to have adopted a dadaistic approach. This is truly ridiculous.

**Input:** One (1) Copy of SCP-914 documentation
**Setting:** Fine 
**Output:** Hard-bound book containing 400 pages.  No diagrams, photos, or other visual aids of any kind are included.  The pages appear to be solid black, but microscopic examination shows each page to be covered in approximately twenty thousand characters.  The text has no correlation with any known writing style, and is not in a linear format, with "sentences" constructed from individual characters spread out between many pages.  Each sentence requires a exceedingly complex formula to decode, with each formula unique to each sentence.  //(Note:  Current decoding work has resulted in two partially translated sentences after 225 work-hours.  Item appears to be a record of the internal structure of SCP-914)//

**Input:** One (1) Copy of SCP-914 documentation
**Setting:** Very Fine 
**Output:** Single sheet of paper.  Weight is exactly the same as the entered documentation.  The sheet appears to be be a single page from the entered SCP-914 documentation, however when flipped over to the right, the reverse side is the following page in sequence.  When flipped over to the left, the opposite side is the preceding page in sequence.  No new documentation is included, however this item is significantly easier to store, if more time consuming to browse.

**Output:** One leather bound tome, 54cm x 42cm, 256 vellum pages, with title written in gold leaf.  Language of the title and the contents were at first unidentifiable, and were later discovered to be an old dialect of Finnish.  The contents are written in calligraphy, and more than half the pages are elaborately illuminated with colored inks and gold and silver leaf.  Once translated, the contents proved to be identical to the contents of the input material, arranged chronologically.  The tome has been radiocarbon dated to the early 11th century C.E.

Anachronistically, a leather pocket is sewn into the inside back cover, and this pocket contains what appears to be a modern compact disc, 10cm in diameter.  Data on this disc is encoded by an unknown codec.  Attempts to divine the codec and decipher the data are ongoing.

//Note: It's a pity the contents of this tome are classified.  It's a piece worthy of any museum.  I've never seen such exquisite calligraphy.  The illuminations may prove to be the most interesting part of the book, though.  They often portray clockworks and related mechanical parts as well as some of the input or output objects; possibly they relate in a direct rather than abstract way to the operation of 914 as described on the illuminated pages.//

The tome has been labeled "SCP-914 Output ██/█/20██-b" and added to research materials.  It has been flagged for further study.

**Input:** 1x set of research materials
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A collection of unredacted notes, photographs, and other media related to SCP-████, which does not yet appear in the Foundation's catalog of known SCPs.  Dates contained within the output material start at ██/██/████, yet in the future as of this report.  No personnel named in the material are current employees or associates of the SCP Foundation, save for Dr. █████ ██████████.  When interviewed, Dr. ██████████ denied any knowledge of the material, and handwriting analysis has confirmed that the information attributed to him was not written by the current Foundation employee.  //Note: this is probably just a coincidence of names.//

In accordance with established protocols, an alert of a potential temporal anomaly has been raised.  O5-level personnel have been informed, and the output material (designated "SCP-914 Output ██/█/20██-c") has been classified and put into secure storage.

**Input:** 1x set of research materials
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One cardboard box, 40cm x 65cm x 24cm, white.  Contents are (15) manila folders containing detailed internal security notes, psychological profiles, and logs of covert monitoring of (15) different, current SCP Foundation personnel.  Output materials were confiscated and later reported to have been destroyed.  Accuracy or inaccuracy of the information contained therein could not be verified.

//Now switching to the "Very Fine" setting.  Perhaps we'll get more useful results.  Only persistence will tell.//

**Input:** 1x set of research materials
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A set of (36) laminated posters, 80cm tall x 121cm wide.  When arranged into a 4-wide by 9-tall rectangle, the posters form an animated image of interlocking gears in motion.  The posters can be rearranged into any order of 4x9 pattern, and each arrangement portrays a different animated image of functioning clockworks.  The animations appear to have no direct connection to SCP-914; they always appear in motion, even when -914 is idle.  They may not even be showing the workings of -914, in any state.  The team is still working on theories for what we're seeing.

The posters have been labeled "SCP-914 Output ██/█/20██-d" and added to research materials.  They have been flagged for further study.

**Name:** Agent T█████
**Date:** ███/██/████
**Total Items:** (1) copy of World of Warcraft Atlas

//This is the first iterative test of SCP-914. The result has been interesting.//

**Input:** (1) copy of World of Warcraft Atlas
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A leather-covered version of the original, with vellum pages and metal reinforcements on the corners of the cover. The language is still English, but the printing now appears to be calligraphic, in the Gothic Black style.

**Input:** The altered atlas from the above test
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** The book now has a lock. Fortunately, a key was included. The maps are now of higher quality, more numerous, and more detailed. A scale is now included on all maps, and the cities cover larger areas and are more detailed. The pages are thinner, but more numerous.

**Input:** The altered atlas from the above test, and its cover key.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** The book has even finer pages now, with cabochons on the cover. The language could not be immediately identified, but photographs later analyzed showed it to be English, in an unknown typeface. The key is more complex.

**Input:** As above
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** The pages have become even thinner, and still more numerous. Now the maps include latitude and longitude, their number and level of detail have increased, and the illustrations of animate things are themselves animate. Unlike [[[SCP-085]]], they do not show evidence of sentience, and do not stray from their positions. The maps are now extremely detailed, showing many settlements not included in any Warcraft supplement or official lore. The language, from studies of photographs, could not be identified with certainty.

**Input**: As above
**Setting**: Fine
**Output:** Still an atlas of Azeroth, but now the illustrations are holographic as well as animate, the binding has become lay-flat, and a leather pocket on the inside back contains a CD-ROM labelled "Atlas of Azeroth, compiled by the Explorer's League of Ironforge. Printed with the assistance of Togglescrew, Switchback, and Buzzbolt, Gnomeregan." The atlas now appears to be written in an archaic dialect of its reader's primary language, in a calligraphic style associated with the relevant culture's medieval period. Photographs taken using purely automatic robots has shown no meaningful printing. Remotely operated cameras show the book in the operator's primary language. The contents of the disc are not encoded in any standard format. Study of the CD-ROM is ongoing. This final version has been labelled as "SCP-914 Output █/██/20█-f." 

//Update: When reexamined in 20█ and 20█, the atlas had grown in thickness. It now contains information on all areas of Azeroth added in each game expansion.//

//Personal log, Agent T███: This thing is beautiful. Absolutely gorgeous; the calligraphy alone is incredible. Ironically, it's so beautiful and detailed a representation of Azeroth as a real word that it's become nearly useless for playing the game. And, frankly, the illustrations creep me out.//

**Name:** Dr.Malfoss, no observation or assistance
**Date:** ██/███/20██
**Total numbers of objects:** 1

**Input:** 1 bic lighter, red with the flame shielding peeled off, belongs to Dr. Malfoss.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A black Zippo-style lighter with the word "GodSpeed" inscribed on the left side. When used to light a cigarette, the flame was 19 feet high and burned a hole in the ceiling Attempts to refuel it showed that the fuel reservoir was filled with cherry flavored Jell-o gelatin. Further testing as to the application of the cherry Jell-O as a fuel is pending approval.
//Note: Evidently my 5 year-old daughter left me a present consisting of cherry jell-o in my lab coat pocket, best not to ask why but this could explain, through particle transfer, how it uses it as a fuel source, further testing in to 914's ability to change the fuel requirements of various fuel-consuming objects seems to be a logical step forward also it seems that 914 is much more precise in ingredients used during refining, perhaps even on the microscopic level?.-Dr.Malfoss//

**Output:** A cellular phone. Contains a "Contact List" of over 500 names and telephone numbers, none of which correspond to any telephone currently in use anywhere on Earth. The first one on the list is labeled "SCP-682 - Home Number".
//Note: I suggest destroying the "Very Fine" output. I mean, it has SCP-682's "home" on the frickin' speed dial, that's reason enough for me not to screw with it.//
//Note: Testing has shown that the number listed under SCP-682's home is for a cellphone located in SCP-682's containment chamber. Investigation is ongoing as to how the telephone got into the chamber//

//Note: Well, it appears SCP-914 can do basic arithmetic.  But so can my computer, so that doesn't tell us much. -Dr. Stevenson//

**Input:** 1x pack Wrigley's "5" chewing gum
**Setting:** fine
**Output:** 5x stick unknown spearmint-flavored chewing gum.  Flavor determined to be spearmint, but does not appear diminish over time, as with most gums.  Dr. Stevenson currently has one stick in his possession and one other has been used in further testing.  The remaining three are kept in Dr. Stevenson's office and are up for grabs.

**Input:** 1x stick from previous output
**Setting:** Very fine
**Output:** 1x piece new variety of spearmint-flavored bubble gum.  Bubbles blown appear to have no limit in size except that of the room.  Cleaning staff found that the gum, even after bursting due to contact with walls and ceiling, can be easily recombined into the original piece and does not collect any debris.

//Note: It's certainly spectacular, but does this new variety of extremely-large-bubble gum have any practical application? - Dr. Stevenson//

//Addendum: From now on, no items obtained from SCP-914 are to be tested in research cell 109-B.  Results could damage the SCP or result in a terrible mess.  Do it outside or something.  -O5-6//

**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** 1x 250 mL can "Monster" brand energy drink.

**Input:** 1x 250 mL can of Red Bull.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** 1x can 250 mL Red Bull Ultra. Brand is not currently produced by the company that makes Red Bull. Expiration date is marked as ██/█/████, far in the future from the writing of this report. Ingredient label contains several substances not known to modern science. Upon consumption of the beverage, D class personnel was observed to function normally for 72 hours without sleep. No signs typical of excess stimulant consumption such as trembling, irritability, or difficulty concentrating were observed. After 72 hours, subject slept for a standard eight hours and remarked that they felt "just fine" on waking. It is not known if the given expiration date means that the drink had an exceptionally long shelf life, or that it was somehow procured from a future era.

**Input:** 1x 250 mL can of Red Bull.
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** 1x 30 mL unmarked bottle containing unidentifiable liquid. Upon consumption, Class D personnel disappeared. Approx. two seconds later, facility wide containment breach was reported. Security on duty reported seeing "some kind of gray blur". Security sweep of the surrounding area turned up the Class D subject approx. 26 km from the facility. Subject was apprehended and when questioned remarked they had just had "the most incredible rush" and that everything now appeared to be moving "too fast". Subject terminated. Giving Class D subjects materials that could result in their escape is not recommended.

**Name** Dr. C. Havik
**Input:** 1x Kitchen Sponge, generic brand
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** 1x Kitchen Sponge of indeterminable make and brand. The output is capable of taking in both liquid and solid masses. The sponge has shown capabilities for absorbing and storing an unnaturally large amount of material despite any apparent growth in weight or size. The maximum observed capacity seems to be an approximate weight of one hundred pounds, with the size of the absorbed materials appearing to be inconsequential. The sponges characteristics only come into effect when it is actually wiped on a substance; simple contact has no effect. The absorbed objects are discharged from the sponge by wringing it, depositing the objects in the condition they were absorbed in. Further investigations are pending.

//Alright, where did you jokers get the idea to actually wipe this on someone without medical personnel available? - Havik//
