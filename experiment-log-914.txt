**Input:**  20 doses MDMA, 20 doses of LSD
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:**  Twenty (20) 160 mg gel capsules, yellow-green in color. One (1) capsule administered to male D-class test subject, resulting in subject experiencing effects of intense euphoria, marked improvement in mood, and some psychedelic visuals after a period of 25 minutes. Effects lasted for 10 hours, after which subject experienced a "crash" with symptoms of a bad hangover and severe depression lasting for a two week period. More tests pending, but effect seems to be a combination of both drugs with a more severe "crash" period than unrefined MDMA. 

**Input:**  20 doses MDMA, 20 doses of LSD, and 20 doses "Viagra" 
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One hundred (100) 16.5 µg gel capsules, opalescent yellow in color. One (1) capsule administered to female D-class test subject, resulting in intense euphoria, a feeling of "serenity", and had a strong desire to be in close physical contact with others, with onset occur after a period of 5 minutes. Subject remained in this state for a period of 78 hours, after which subject entered a catatonic state lasting a period of nearly four weeks. Subject showed extreme hostility after awakening and appeared to be in intense pain. Subject was terminated then autopsied, revealing that pleasure centers in her brain were severely damaged and testosterone levels were increased. More tests pending.

**Input:**  20 doses MDMA, 20 doses of LSD, and 20 doses "Viagra" 
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One hundred (100) 17µg gel capsules, golden and luminescent. One (1) capsule administered to male D-class test subject, with effects identical to "Fine" output appearing after 30 seconds. Subject was very docile and, while coherent, would not answer questions. After 15 minutes, subject entered a catatonic state for a period of 74 hours during which time subject was observed to have seizures resulting in ejaculation. Upon awakening, subject displayed a marked deadening of emotion, showed no interest in pleasurable activities, and was unable to be sexually aroused. When interviewed, subject stated he "just didn't care anymore". Subject terminated and autopsied, show severe damage specific to emotional centers of the brain. More tests pending. 

//Note: While there may be possible therapeutic benefits to the "Fine" and "Very Fine" outputs, I suggest that more tests be run on subjects of both genders. The output results are to be kept in my office safe unless being tested.// -Dr. Palmer

//Wait, how does that even work? Viagra is a vasodilator, not an aphrodisiac.//
~Dr. Trebuchet

//This test may indicate that SCP-914 understands the use of input objects and not simply their function. Recommend testing with medicines reliant on the placebo effect to ascertain if outputs provide actual medicinal solutions to problems.// -Dr. Pyrrhus

**Input:** 1 brown paper bag
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** Small heap of ashes and several scraps of brown paper

**Input:** 1 brown paper bag
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** 25 small squares of brown paper.

**Input:** 1 brown paper bag
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** 1 white paper bag.  Texture smoother than the original bag.

**Input:** 1 brown paper bag

--------------------------------------------------------------------

**Name:** Dr. P██████ Gibbons
**Date:** [DATA EXPUNGED]
**Total items:** 5x regular cubes of Telekill Alloy [[[SCP-148]]], with a volume of 0.4 cubic meters, making a total of 2 (Two) cubic meters.

**Input:** 1x cube of Telekill Alloy for each setting.

**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** 25x regular cubes of Telekill Alloy, each with a volume of 0.016 cubic meters

**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** 1x cube of unknown dark-blue metal, with a volume of 0.2 cubic meters. The fact that it's two times smaller to the original input cube suggests that the density of the material is two times greater than the Telekill Alloy. With an original melting point of 700ºC, and an evaporation point of 1400ºC, it has been noticed that, if temperature of the metal reaches below 0ºC, the color of the metal changes to a lighter blue and physical properties change. This metal has an unknown melting point, as focused, concentrated heat of over 20000ºC has not melted it. Catalogation for SCP has been raised to 05-7 personnel and denied.


**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** 1x cube of unknown light-red metal, with a volume of 1.2 cubic meters. Size is three times that of the original input, suggesting that the input Telekill Alloy is three times more dense than the output. Metal has a melting point of 700ºC and an evaporation point of 1400ºC, matching with the 'Coarse' output, although does not show the same physical properties change when reaching 0ºC, like the previous output. Metal, when touched by a sentient human being, inhibits all senses for a period of 30 (thirty) minutes after the first time is touched (that is, if the object is held for 5 seconds, the period of inhibition will last 30 minutes and 5 seconds). Witnesses have later described it as a "VERY unpleasant experience," and also manifested sensations of "wild hallucinations," similar to a near-overdose of Lysergic Acid. --SCP catalogation has been denied.

//The 30 scariest minutes of my fucking life. Note to self: Use the damn gloves. Second note to self: Ask Clef if he wants bracelets of this for his birthday. -Dr. Gibbons//

**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Sculpture resembling [[[SCP-682]]] made out of Telekill Alloy, with a volume 0.4 cubic meters. Output has not shown any kind of sentient manifestations, although any contact or approach near [[[SCP-682]]] is denied until further notice.

//Now, I would like this for my desktop, if you don't mind. -Dr. Gibbons//

**Test 11828-U5:** Tests on the nature and construction of SCP-914

With approval from 05 Command, A single gear was removed from one of the "outer" sections of SCP-914.  Placement was carefully documented, and was in a location that would not release tension on any belts, or damage any documented sections.  Testing area was cleared and sealed after placing a steel block in the "intake" booth.  D-00104 was dispatched to SCP-914, and instructed to turn the key and activate SCP-914.

D-00104 reported that "the key won't catch", and it was observed the key turned several times without tightening the mainspring.  No activity of any kind was observed from SCP-914 during this time.

Missing gear was replaced with a identical copy, comprised of the same metal (brass) as the original.  Steel block re-inserted into the "intake" booth, and SCP-914 was activated on the "1:1" setting.  SCP-914 observed to operate normally, with a slight pause of 3.5 seconds after winding the key.  After "refining", Output observed to be a solid steel sphere with the same volume as the original steel block.  Original gear returned to SCP-914.

**Notes:**  //Well, thank god we can at least repair the damn thing if we damage it...assuming we can find what's broken in it.  Hell, maybe it's already broken, i don't know...this damn thing hurts my head...

**Input:** One (1) Copy of SCP-914 documentation
**Setting:** Fine 
**Output:** Hard-bound book containing 400 pages.  No diagrams, photos, or other visual aids of any kind are included.  The pages appear to be solid black, but microscopic examination shows each page to be covered in approximately twenty thousand characters.  The text has no correlation with any known writing style, and is not in a linear format, with "sentences" constructed from individual characters spread out between many pages.  Each sentence requires a exceedingly complex formula to decode, with each formula unique to each sentence.  //(Note:  Current decoding work has resulted in two partially translated sentences after 225 work-hours.  Item appears to be a record of the internal structure of SCP-914)//

**Input:** One (1) Copy of SCP-914 documentation
**Setting:** Very Fine 
**Output:** Single sheet of paper.  Weight is exactly the same as the entered documentation.  The sheet appears to be be a single page from the entered SCP-914 documentation, however when flipped over to the right, the reverse side is the following page in sequence.  When flipped over to the left, the opposite side is the preceding page in sequence.  No new documentation is included, however this item is significantly easier to store, if more time-consuming to browse.

//(**Memo from General ████████:**  It's screwing with us, you know that right?  I don't CARE if it's been proven that it has no self-awareness, this thing is LAUGHING at us!)//

//Last Monday morning, I entered the recreation room of Test Facility X, and I noticed the ██████ cadavers of ██ class D test subjects, as well as the uninjured Senior Researcher ████████ in various ████████ poses on the ████████, the floor, ████████ sofa, and counter; some test subjects were in the ████████████ process of ████████ physical intimacy, including ████████, hugging, kissing, ████████ sex, ██████ sex, and ████████████.  Senior Researcher ████████ was snoring extremely loudly and could not be awakened.  I employed Agent Portman's help in cleaning up the mess and transferring Senior Researcher ████████ to a bed.  After all was said and done, Agent Portman alerted me to the presence of a small, dark blue box, as well as several sheets of coffee-stained paper.   Upon one was the word 'beauty' written repeatedly in beautiful French hand, and upon the others was the beginning of an experiment.  The below log shows Senior Researcher ██████████ beginning of the experiment, as well as my conclusion of it.// -Dr von Hildebrandt

**Input:** One Oxy-Contin tablet.
**Setting:** Very fine.
**Output:** One blue box, approximately two inches on each side, with a button on top.  When pressed, Senior Researcher ████████ felt the effects of opioid intoxication; that is, an overpowering feeling of happiness, as well as drowsiness; he felt 'the need to hug anybody and everybody'.  Senior Researcher █████████ took the result to the recreation room, and allowed, contrary to regulations, everybody in attendance to use the box repeatedly; the above effects were noted.

**Input:** One Oxy-Contin tablet, one Valium tablet.
**Setting:** Very fine.
**Output:** An object similar to a pen-light; when activated in the direction of test subject D-5318008, the subject felt incredibly drowsy and yet as if he had been 'kissed by God Himself'.  When given an analeptic to treat the drowsiness, the subject felt empathic symptoms as described above.

**Input:** One Oxy-Contin tablet, one Valium tablet, one glow-stick, one Desoxyn capsule, one SCP-500 clone capsule.
**Setting:** Very fine.
**Output:** One glow-stick, in a pouch presumably originating from the various plastics used as pill binders.  When glow-stick was removed from pouch, all the subjects and SCP personnel in the vicinity felt 'incredibly relaxed', with no drowsiness.  Glow-stick was left outside SCP-914 for approximately one hour.  When returned to pouch, all SCP personnel in the vicinity felt the effects of intense opioid withdrawal.  Morphine was given to no avail; personnel returned to normal in approximately three days.  SCP status pending.

//Addendum by Agent Portman: The glow-stick inserted into the intake booth was green and inactive.  The glow-stick in the output booth was purple and glowing.  What's up with this thing?  Oh, yeah, and my broken forearm's not broken any more!//

//Addendum by Dr von Hildebrandt: If exposed to the glow-stick combination for longer than approximately one hour, subjects will be unable to sleep (relationship to duration of exposure is yet to be determined); after a period of time, subjects will fall asleep immediately where they are and suffer the following effects in their sleep: shivering, involuntary muscle movements (especially in the legs), rhinorrhoea (runny nose), rough sleep, lacrimation (tearing of eyes), hypertension (high blood pressure), tachycardia (rapid heart rate), emesis (vomiting), and loss of bowel control.  This thing isn't to be played with.//

**Total items:** (6) sets photocopies and duplicates of lab notes and other research material on SCP-914.

**Input:** 1x set of research materials

**Setting:** Fine

**Output:** One formal report book, 22cm x 30cm, 420 pages, bound with a clear plastic protective cover.  Book contains all lab reports on SCP-914 assembled to date, apparently created on a word processor and printed with a color laser printer.  Fonts used do not conform to any fonts currently installed on SCP Foundation computers.  Each lab report contains more elaborate information, more detailed descriptions, and more precise measurements than were in the input material.  The contents of the report are extensively cross-referenced, and there is a thorough index in the back.  Spot-checking 40 randomly selected details that could be re-examined by our team, the more detailed information in the output was confirmed to be correct in all 40 cases.



The report book has been labeled "SCP-914 Output ██/█/20██-a" and added to research materials.  //Note: information therein should be confirmed before being deemed reliable.//



**Input:** 1x set of research materials

**Setting:** Fine

**Output:** One leatherbound tome, 54cm x 42cm, 256 vellum pages, with title written in gold leaf.  Language of the title and the contents were at first unidentifiable, and were later discovered to be an old dialect of Finnish.  The contents are written in calligraphy, and more than half the pages are elaborately illuminated with colored inks and gold and silver leaf.  Once translated, the contents proved to be identical to the contents of the input material, arranged chronologically.  The tome has been radiocarbon dated to the early 11th century C.E.



Anachronistically, a leather pocket is sewn into the inside back cover, and this pocket contains what appears to be a modern compact disc, 10cm in diameter.  Data on this disc is encoded by an unknown codec.  Attempts to divine the codec and decipher the data are ongoing.



//Note: It's a pity the contents of this tome are classified.  It's a piece worthy of any museum.  I've never seen such exquisite calligraphy.  The illuminations may prove to be the most interesting part of the book, though.  They often portray clockworks and related mechanical parts as well as some of the input or output objects; possibly they relate in a direct rather than abstract way to the operation of SCP-914 as described on the illuminated pages.//



The tome has been labeled "SCP-914 Output ██/█/20██-b" and added to research materials.  It has been flagged for further study.



**Input:** 1x set of research materials

**Setting:** Fine

**Output:** A collection of unredacted notes, photographs, and other media related to SCP-████, which does not yet appear in the Foundation's catalogue of known SCPs.  Dates contained within the output material start at ██/██/████, yet in the future as of this report.  No personnel named in the material are current employees or associates of the SCP Foundation, save for Dr. █████ ██████████.  When interviewed, Dr. ██████████ denied any knowledge of the material, and handwriting analysis has confirmed that the information attributed to him was not written by the current Foundation employee.  //Note: this is probably just a coincidence of names.//



In accordance with established protocols, an alert of a potential temporal anomaly has been raised.  O5-level personnel have been informed, and the output material (designated "SCP-914 Output ██/█/20██-c") has been classified and put into secure storage.



**Input:** 1x set of research materials

**Setting:** Fine

**Output:** One cardboard box, 40cm x 65cm x 24cm, white.  Contents are (15) manila folders containing detailed internal security notes, psychological profiles, and logs of covert monitoring of (15) different, current SCP Foundation personnel.  Output materials were confiscated and later reported to have been destroyed.  Accuracy or inaccuracy of the information contained therein could not be verified.



//Now switching to the "Very Fine" setting.  Perhaps we'll get more useful results.  Only persistence will tell.//



**Input:** 1x set of research materials

**Setting:** Very Fine

**Output:** A set of (36) laminated posters, 80cm tall x 121cm wide.  When arranged into a 4-wide by 9-tall rectangle, the posters form an animated image of interlocking gears in motion.  The posters can be rearranged into any order of 4x9 pattern, and each arrangement portrays a different animated image of functioning clockworks.  The animations appear to have no direct connection to SCP-914; they always appear in motion, even when SCP-914 is idle.  They may not even be showing the workings of SCP-914, in any state.  The team is still working on theories for what we're seeing.



The posters have been labeled "SCP-914 Output ██/█/20██-d" and added to research materials.  They have been flagged for further study.



**Input:** 1x set of research materials

**Setting:** Very Fine

**Output:** One PDA containing a single document file, written in an undetermined language.  PDA is heavy for its size.  Lab technician █████ ██████ visually scanned through the file from beginning to end, then went into a catatonic state.  Technician is completely unresponsive, save that whenever someone speaks directly to him, he replies with a statement that appears to be an alteration or refinement of whatever was spoken to him.  He has been taken to Medical for treatment and observation.  PDA has been labeled "SCP-914 Output ██/█/20██-e," labeled as dangerous and added to research materials.



//Note: It's as though ██████ has become some sort of human linguistic SCP-914.  It's a curious effect for a written document to have.  Still, he might provide some useful insights into how SCP-914 works, or at least how its designers thought.//

Name: Dr. Grunn, Dr. █████ observing
Date: ██/█/████
Total items:  Six (6) 1'x1x1'' cubes of pine wood, all from the same tree.
Note: There seems to be a odd correlation between the person putting items in, and what comes out.  Working on the theory that 914 is some kind of massive, over-elaborate toy, I will attempt to alter the output by verbally requesting items before starting the device.

**Input:** One (1) 1'x1x1'' pine wood block
**Setting:** 1:1, while verbally stating "I would like a wooden ball."
**Output:** A wooden cylinder with identical mass of the input.
//Note: Partial credit?  it was round, at least...//

**Input:** One (1) 1'x1'x1' pine wood block
**Setting:** 1:1, while verbally stating "I would like a wooden pyramid"

//Note: Ok, so a little out of left field...maybe geometry is confusing...//

**Input:** One (1) 1'x1'x1' pine wood block
**Setting:** 1:1, while verbally stating "I would like a set of blocks"
**Output:** Sawdust.  Microscopic examination shows each sawdust particle is a perfect cube.  Held for further research
//Note: While somewhat extreme, this was actually a legitimate reply to my request.//

**Input:** One (1) 1'x1'x1' pine wood block
**Setting:** 1:1, while verbally stating "I would like a wooden sculpture of a bird"
**Output:** A wooden box of identical dimensions to the input.  Opening the box revealed a smaller box, and so on.  27 boxes found, in total.
//Note: Maybe it's getting bored.//

**Input:** One (1) 1'x1'x1' pine wood block
**Setting:** 1:1, while verbally stating "I would like a wooden clock"
**Output:** Small mass of finely tuned wooden clockworks.  Observation shows that the device, if properly secured in an appropriate housing, tracks the movement of all the major bodies of the solar system.  Device needs to be wound daily, and automatically corrects itself when tracking wanders due to slow down or tampering.  Held for further research.
//Note: Maybe it has a odd sense of time... or is messing with me.  I find myself less able to debate the sentience argument, the more I work with it.//

**Input:** One (1) 1'x1'x1' pine wood block and Dr. Grunn's keys. (note: keys were found to have accidentally fallen in to the Input chamber without Dr. Grunn's notice.)

Total Items: One (1) piece of 22cm x 29cm (8.5 in. x 11 in.) unlined copy paper upon which the rules for the children's game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" are typed.

**Input:** One (1) set of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" rules.
**Setting:** Very Fine.
**Output:** A 10cm x 10cm piece of noticeably thicker paper. Text is inscribed in a spiral , starting at the outside edge and moving inwards, in a language that was eventually discovered to be Dutch. When translated, it was a more concise version of the printed text. Also, when brought within five (5) meters of a stone, mineral, or metal object with a surface area equal or less than the paper's, it will move to envelop and subsequently crush the material. This property was discovered upon the output sensing Researcher Adams' jade ring. Soon thereafter, the ring and finger were reduced to a fine powder. Output incinerated to prevent harm to components of SCP-914.

**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A small, mostly black card, thicker and of smaller area than the ID badge. Upon being tapped, displays comprehensive information about "John Doe" in the form of a hologram the size of 8.5 by 11 inch paper. Given the nonsensical and jumbled nature of the information (including a US social security card and a driver's licence registration in the nation of South Africa, dated 2 years after the reported birthday), it is the opinion of Dr. ████████████ that this information likely does not correspond to any actual person.

**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A small black card, similar to the first one, that displays comprehensive identification information about whoever touches it in the form of a hologram the size of a standard 8.5 by 11 inch paper. This information has been seen to include name, picture, voice and DNA sequence, social security number, all current and past security clearances, all questionable actions ever taken by the person in question (tested on several D-class, leading to one immediate termination due to newly revealed information disqualifying the subject from access to SCPs) Object also revealed comprehensive physical and mental information on the subject, apparently performing a complete psychoanalysis. It also displayed information on family members and friends, and information stating where the subject's loyalties lie, who he respects, who he fears, etc. The object was classified SCP-████ "safe" and now serves as Dr. ████████████'s identification badge. He is required to keep it on his person at all times, and is not to be assigned to any sentient SCPs unless the object is destroyed.

**Input:** 1x Morton salt container
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** 1x container of Old Bay seasoning (680 grams/container). Upon taking it to a seafood buffet with colleagues, Dr. King and his co-workers agreed that it was the best Old Bay seasoning they have ever had. Further inspection reveals an expiration date of ██/██/2028, and nutrition information that does not match any currently produced Old Bay seasoning.

**Input:** 2x Morton salt container
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A small (size estimated to be approx. 10x10x7.5 cm), heavy (approx. 1,474 grams) three-dimensional statuette of the “Morton Salt Girl” on a small pedestal. Analysis of the figurine shows that it is made up entirely of tightly-packed sodium chloride. When pieces of the sculpture are broken off, the unattached segment crumbles into regular-density Morton salt. The rest of the sculpture quickly regenerates the broken segment. Splitting the sculpture exactly in half (so that both of the pieces have an equal mass) results in both halves regenerating, creating a duplicate. Two of the statuettes currently exist: one kept in the staff room of Site-67, and the second displayed on the desk of Dr. King.
