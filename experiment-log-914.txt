**Test 11828-U5:** Tests on the nature and construction of SCP-914

With approval from 05 Command, a single gear was removed from one of the "outer" sections of SCP-914. Placement was carefully documented, and was in a location that would not release tension on any belts or damage any documented sections. Testing area was cleared and sealed after placing a steel block in the "intake" booth. D-00104 was dispatched to SCP-914, and instructed to turn the key and activate SCP-914.

D-00104 reported that "the key won't catch", and the key was observed to turn several times without tightening the mainspring. No activity of any kind was observed from SCP-914 during this time.

Missing gear was replaced with a identical copy, comprised of the same metal (brass) as the original. Steel block re-inserted into the "intake" booth, and SCP-914 was activated on the "1:1" setting. SCP-914 observed to operate normally, with a slight pause of 3.5 seconds after winding the key. After "refining", Output observed to be a solid steel sphere with the same volume as the original steel block. Original gear returned to SCP-914.

**Notes:** //Well, thank god we can at least repair the damn thing if we damage it... assuming we can find what's broken in it. Hell, maybe it's already broken, I don't know... this damn thing hurts my head...

**Total items:** 4x clockwork pocket watch, belonging to Dr. Gears

**Input:** 1x gold-plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Small clockwork bird. When the tail is pressed, it produces a robin's call.

**Input:** 1x gold-plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine

**Input:** 1 gold-plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Small metal sculpture of a piano.

//Notes from Dr. Gears:// It appears there is a high level of randomness when SCP-914 "refines" an item. However, it seems to preserve some element of its original composition, in this example, clockworks. This is not a law, but a high probability. Refine a metal bar, and you're more likely to get a simple metal object than a internal combustion engine. Both, however, are possible.

**Date:**██/██/████
**Total number of objects:** Three (3) copies of all documentation, photographs, and test logs accumulated in relation to SCP-914.

**Input:** One (1) copy of SCP-914 documentation
**Setting:** 1:1 
**Output:** Folder containing all previously entered documents, arranged in chronological order.

**Input:** One (1) copy of SCP-914 documentation
**Setting:** Fine 
**Output:** Hard-bound book containing 400 pages. No diagrams, photos, or other visual aids of any kind are included. The pages appear to be solid black, but microscopic examination shows each page to be covered in approximately twenty thousand characters. The text has no correlation with any known writing style, and is not in a linear format, with "sentences" constructed from individual characters spread out between many pages. Each sentence requires an exceedingly complex formula to decode, with each formula unique to each sentence. //(Note: Current decoding work has resulted in two partially translated sentences after 225 work-hours. Item appears to be a record of the internal structure of SCP-914.)//

**Input:** One (1) copy of SCP-914 documentation
**Setting:** Very Fine 
**Output:** Single sheet of paper. Weight is exactly the same as the entered documentation. The sheet appears to be a single page from the entered SCP-914 documentation, however when flipped over to the right, the reverse side is the following page in sequence. When flipped over to the left, the opposite side is the preceding page in sequence. No new documentation is included, but this item is significantly easier to store, if more time-consuming to browse.

//(**Memo from General ████████:** It's screwing with us, you know that right? I don't CARE if it's been proven that it has no self-awareness, this thing is LAUGHING at us!)//

//Note from Dr. Gears:// There seems to be some difficulty as to the meaning of "fine" and "coarse" on the settings; the machine appears to be capable of refining input based either on a scale of complexity (loss of entropy accompanied by increase in connectivity between components and/or acquisition of subjective meaning) or of simplification (separation into composite materials and loss of meaning).

**Total items:** One (1) set photocopies and duplicates of lab notes and other research material on SCP-914.

**Input:** 1x set of research materials
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One leather-bound tome, 54cm x 42cm, 256 vellum pages, with title written in gold leaf. Language of the title and the contents were at first unidentifiable, and were later discovered to be an old dialect of Finnish. The contents are written in calligraphy, and more than half the pages are elaborately illuminated with colored inks and gold and silver leaf. Once translated, the contents proved to be identical to the contents of the input material, arranged chronologically. The tome has been radiocarbon dated to the early 11th century C.E.

Anachronistically, a leather pocket is sewn into the inside back cover, and this pocket contains what appears to be a modern compact disc, 10cm in diameter. Data on this disc is encoded by an unknown codec. Attempts to divine the codec and decipher the data are ongoing.

//Note: It's a pity the contents of this tome are classified. It's a piece worthy of any museum. I've never seen such exquisite calligraphy. The illuminations may prove to be the most interesting part of the book, though. They often portray clockworks and related mechanical parts as well as some of the input or output objects; possibly they relate in a direct rather than abstract way to the operation of SCP-914 as described on the illuminated pages.//

**Input:**  One (1) lithium-ion battery
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One (1) object that resembles an unmarked lithium-ion battery. Closer inspection revealed that much of the internal mass of the battery had been converted into a radioactive isotope of █████████, deriving power from its nuclear decay, with a design very similar to that used in many spacecraft. Object placed into storage.

**Input:**  One (1) lithium-ion battery
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** When the output door opened, air rushed into the output chamber as if a vacuum had been present within. The object is a black cube with two electrical nodes on the top, fifteen (15) cm across, and weighing exactly the weight of the input battery plus the air in the chamber. The object is unmarked, with the exception of a small printing on one side, warning users that the object contained antimatter, and advising caution. Antimatter composition of object has not yet been confirmed, but has shown no limit to energy capacity. Object currently under testing.

//Note: I think we should refrain from putting anything with a lot of potential energy into SCP-914 in the future. If the pressure wave from the air had damaged the output, all of Site-██ could have been destroyed. Not a pleasant thought.// -Dr. Geralds

**Output:** A hand-crafted blanket. The thread count is notably high and the surface has a sleek, silky feel, but the mass is unaltered.

**Input:** One (1) of the comforters
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A comforter that has shown moderately anomalous properties. Testing with a few voluntary subjects shows that wrapping them up in the blanket, such that it covers around 80% of their body, results in a sense of security and well-being. Subjects wrapped in it and laid on their back report drowsiness and lose consciousness exactly 300 seconds later. The subject remains unconscious until the blanket is removed, at which point they awaken, reporting a restful sleep. Additionally, during this rest period, minor injuries and afflictions disappear, including scrapes, bruises, and in one case, a nasty cold.

**Input:** One (1) wheel (green)
**Setting:** Course
**Output:** Disassembled green skateboard wheel. Appears to have been used heavily and shows scuff marks and discoloration.

**Input:** One (1) wheel (green)
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One (1) wheel (red) of identical make and quality. 

**Input:** One (1) wheel (green)
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One (1) unmarked black wheel of almost perfect quality. The outer rubber of the wheels greatly resists wear even with prolonged use, and the center bearing exhibits almost no friction, and was successfully left spinning in a vacuum sealed environment for just under ██ days.

**Input:** One (1) wheel (green)
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One (1) bearing, suspended by an invisible outer wheel of unknown material. Although invisible, the outer wheel physically exists and appears to use higher-dimensional translations to redirect the force of gravity and propel the object forward at at about half the speed of free fall. The wheel can be easily stopped at low speeds, but gains momentum quickly while unhindered. Prospective researchers should note that under the influence of gravity the wheel will always retain a 1/4mg horizontal force, even while at rest. 

//Note 1: And they say you can't reinvent the wheel.

**Name:** Dr. Mason
**Date:**07/06/17
**Input:** Five (5) realtime location beacons, standard Foundation issue. 
//Note: The area above and around SCP-914 was set with receivers before this test. In this test, all directional notation is relative to the central "Intake" and "Output" booths, i.e., a subject standing at the mainspring is facing "North".//

**Input:** One (1) tracking beacon
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** Small amounts of various scrap metals and other composite materials of tracking beacons. 
**Path:** Within the first 0.15 seconds, the signal was traced to move 3.41 meters "North" before turning exactly ninety one (91) degrees. Signal was lost after another 0.3 meters. 

**Input:** One (1) tracking beacon
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** One (1) tracking beacon, with battery and transceiver unit removed. No other visible damage. 
**Path:** While again initially traveling "North" for 3.41 meters, the tracking device remained functional for almost twice the amount of time as the first trial. This path appeared to follow the outer edges of the rectangular main body of SCP 914 before the signal was lost. 
//Note: I wonder if there are set paths that each setting follows. - Doctor Mason//

**Input:** One (1) tracking beacon
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One (1) unlabeled tracking beacon consistent with those used by Canadian counterterrorism groups. 
**Path:** "North" for 3.41 meters. Signal then moves towards one of the "Southwestern" outer segments of SCP-914, where it repeatedly follows an equilateral triangle for 0.13 seconds before losing signal. Analysis of received signals shows a new signal retracing a path back to the booths. 
//Note: Seriously, though. What is that first bit Northward for? I've checked the recordings, it does that in every test. Every. Single. One. -Dr. Mason//

**Input:** One (1) tracking beacon
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One (1) apparent tracking beacon,  components consistent with Foundation-specific requirements. Tracking beacon is smaller than standard, with certain unknown components. Testing revealed it to be fully operational, although signal was lost mid-test, as the output ran a different operating system. 
**Path:** "North" for 3.63 meters. "South-southeast" for 0.7 meters. Accelerates in the opposite direction for four (4) meters before signal cutoff. 
//Note: So, I was talking to a colleague about my testing, and they said that the Fine output sounded familiar. Turns out the smaller beacon and the new OS are both prototypes right now. Guess we end up using them. - Dr. Mason//

**Input:** One (1) tracking beacon
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One (1) thin strip of translucent film, shown to be attachable with static cling. Discovered to be remarkable resilient for its size when D-1126 tore a fingernail pulling it off of the wall of the Output Booth. Currently unreadable. 
**Path:** "North" for 3.41 meters. Subsequently appears to reach all parts of SCP-914, although high speeds prevented receivers from accurately tracking the path. 
//Note 1: Well, that was disappointing. At least I got a strip of fancy tape. Hopefully I'll be able to get something out of the prior results. -Dr. Mason
Note 2: So, turns out if you let that tape stick itself to your hand, you can draw the paths of whatever it recorded. You also draw a legend, and what appears to be a menu screen. I'm going to try to get this put onto a D-Class to preserve my wrists. - Dr. Mason
Note 3: Wow. So, not only did the new tracker record its own movements, it somehow recorded ALL of the movements. Of EVERYTHING that 914 has worked on over the last 3 months. I think I've finally gotten 914 to work with us, albeit with a lot of analysis involved. This is amazing. -Dr. Mason
Note 4: [EXPLETIVE DELETED]. I thought it would make sense for ONCE. But no, it had to be messing with us again. One of my interns - sorry, Junior Researchers - found out that, if you superimpose all the paths from the tracker, you get a 3D image of the Foundation logo. It's pretty for art drawn in GPS, but it still makes this whole project meaningless. Piece of [EXPLETIVE DELETED] doesn't follow set paths. It does whatever it wants. -Dr. Mason
Note 5: Dr. Mason has been placed on psychological leave due to apparent stress. Junior Researcher Chen has taken over. Analysis of the object paths taken will continue. -O5 Command//

**Input:** One (1) loaded Heckler and Koch MP7
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One (1) Panzerfaust 3. Testing shows that once fired another missile will appear in it's place, the process taking between 2 and 5 seconds. As well as this, the missile emits mild amounts of radiation with a blast radius multiplied approximately twice. Testing at missile impact sites show radiation equivalent to the proposed Davy Crockett portable nuclear system. Currently stored for future testing.

**Input:** (1) Disc
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** (1) apparently unchanged compact disc. However when played for D-class personnel, an immediate euphoric effect was noted, with certain individuals weeping with emotion and others falling over with apparent rictus smiles on their face. Soon after the effects were noted additional symptoms were exhibited, including seizures, jaundice, and vomiting. The experiment was immediately ended, however researcher A-1 ████ was injured by D-17645 while attempting to turn off the disc player, begging the researcher to allow him to continue listening to the music.

Security proceeded to restrain the remaining ambulatory D-class personnel long enough for ██████ to deactivate the player. Physical examinations and testing of the individuals exposed to the music revealed the presence of a previously unknown euphoric-inducing toxin in their bloodstreams. Chelation was performed, but one individual expired from a combination of kidney failure, liver failure, and cardiac necrosis.

**Output:** Separate piles of dextrose, corn syrup, gum base, corn starch, and red food dyes.

**Input:** 1 green gum ball
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** 1 ball of what initially appeared to be gum, matching green color. Object ended up being an everlasting gobstopper.

**Input:** 1 blue gum ball
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** 1 blue gum ball. Outer shell was a much glossier blue than input gum ball. When chewed, subject reported that the flavor was that of farm ripened blueberries. 

**Input:** 1 yellow gum ball
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** 1 shiny yellow gum ball. Gum appears to glow faintly in low light. Testing indicates no source for this glow. When chewed, subject reported feelings of euphoria. Subject indicated that the gum reminded them of their favorite childhood meal, but couldn't elaborate as to what the flavor actually was. Flavor apparently does not fade away as with normal chewing gum. 

//Notes from Dr. Reece:// The everlasting flavor seems to be further indication that this thing modifies objects based on our perception of them. Everyone wishes gum would keep its flavor for more than a few minutes.

**Input:** One (1) IMI Desert Eagle .50AE
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** One (1) fully disassembled Desert Eagle, each component sorted based on size.

**Input:** One (1) IMI Desert Eagle .50AE
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One (1) IWI Jericho 941.
//Note: The Jericho is a pistol also designed and manufactured by IMI with cosmetic similarities to the Desert Eagle.//

**Input:** One (1) IMI Desert Eagle .50AE
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A small cannon, weighing 4.4 lb. The back is capable of being opened up to load one .50AE round. A small trigger is located on the top of the cannon.
//Note: This brings a whole new meaning to a hand-cannon. Will place output in the site armory.//

**Input:** One (1) IMI Desert Eagle .50AE
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A small clockwork bird, appearance similar to that of a bald eagle. It appears to behave similar to an actual bald eagle, except far more docile.

//Note: I don't know what I was expecting, but a clockwork bird was the not even a possibility I thought of. On occasion, the bird seems to make varying pitch clicking in some form of melodic pattern.// -Dr. J P█████

//Update: It dawned on me that the pattern of notes it plays is to that of the American national anthem, "Star-Spangled Banner." I'm keeping it and naming it Kennedy.// -Dr. J P█████

**Input:** The aforementioned manuscript 
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A series of origami cranes that took off as soon as the chamber was open, flying in irregular patterns. Most of the cranes collided with the doorway and fell straight to the ground, exhibiting no further anomalous properties.

//Note: The program input was an application similar to the app "Flappy Bird".//

//That was interesting. I'll have to see about something a little more complex.// -Dr. Hadian

**Name:** Dr. Hadian
**Date:** 2-17-2018
**Total Items:** One (1) printed copy of a Javascript program (meant to be a "chat bot")

**Input:** The aforementioned manuscript 
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A small paper-mache head that spoke in a choppy, occasionally non-sequitur fashion. In spite of its ability to communicate, the head appears to lack true sentience, instead repeating back phrases taught to it and a few other basic English sentences.

//Note: About what I expected. I could be mistaken, but it would appear that even though SCP 914 is a mechanical device, machine code is still somehow understood by it. This would make sense, with the interpretation that it functions based on the "meaning" of objects, and given the explicit functionality of most programming languages, we might be able to achieve more stable results this way.// -Dr. Hadian

**Name:** Researcher Mikk
**Date:** 2-21-2018
**Total Items:** One (1) printed copy of a Javascript program (self-learning chat bot), 5 kilograms of tin with 5% silver, 10 grams of copper, 500 grams of plastic

//Note: This is a continuation of the tests of Dr. Hadian.// - Researcher Mikk

**Input:** One (1) printed copy of a Javascript program (self-learning chat bot), 5 kilograms of stainless steel, 10 grams of copper, 500 grams of plastic
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** Same as the last time, but made of stainless steel. The voice was similar to the chatbot "Evie." When connected to a computer using an USB cable, it will start speaking to you similarly to the chatbot "Cleverbot." Further test logs awaiting O5 approval.

//Note: The head is supposedly "sentient," according to the people who first talked to it, which could be wrong, because the program code was simple and when used in a normal computer, is not sentient.//

**Name:** Dr. Hadian
**Date:** 2-22-2018
**Total Items:** One (1) manuscript of a simple Javascript program, one (1) fluorescent light bulb.

//Note: The code in question was a program devised to have the bulb turn on if it was being held right-side up. This test is to see if SCP 914 will comply in fabricating such an object.//

**Input:** The aforementioned materials
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A luminescent mass, opaque, with a smoky white color. The object could be moved without difficulty, but it would not rotate in any fashion except in a way that kept it perpendicular to the floor. In all attempts to defy this property, it has proven immobile, causing the tester's hand to slip, defying gravity, and in one case, shattering the shaft of a power tool rigged to turn it over.

//We'll chalk that one up as "inconclusive". Certainly an interesting paperweight, though.// -Dr. Hadian

**Name:** Dr. Sato
**Date:** 2/24/17
**Total Items:** One (1) unloaded electric airsoft M16 Rifle

**Input:** 1 unloaded electric airsoft M16 Rifle
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One (1) Pull-action crossbow with a hollow stock, three (3) carbon fiber bolts with an electronic device serving as a bolt head.

//Notes: The mass of the bolts were equal to that of the original gun’s stock and reviewing the original gun’s make it appears that the stock was made of carbon fiber. Researcher suspects that the device serves as a tracker but has no means of confirming it without potentially compromising the product.//

**Input:** One (1) of said carbon fiber bolts
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A single construction bolt with some sort of mechanism on it.

//Notes: Experimentation has revealed that the bolt is self screwing, using what is likely a small motor. The self screwing takes effect after light manual labor is applied.//
