**Input:**  20 doses MDMA, 20 does of LSD
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:**  Twenty (20) 160 mg gel capsules, yellow-green in color. One (1) capsule administered to male D-class test subject, resulting in subject experiencing effects of intense euphoria, marked improvement in mood, and some psychedelic visuals after a period of 25 minutes. Effects lasted for 10 hours, after which subject experienced a "crash" with symptoms of a bad hangover and severe depression lasting for a two week period. More tests pending, but effect seems to be a combination of both drugs with a more severe "crash" period than unrefined MDMA. 

**Input:**  20 doses MDMA, 20 does of LSD, and 20 doses "Viagra" 
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One hundred (100) 16.5 µg gel capsules, opalescent yellow in color. One (1) capsule administered to female D-class test subject, resulting in intense euphoria, a feeling of "serenity", and had a strong desire to be in close physical contact with others, with onset occur after a period of 5 minutes. Subject remained in this state for a period of 78 hours, after which subject entered a catatonic state lasting a period of nearly four weeks. Subject showed extreme hostility after awakening and appeared to be in intense pain. Subject was terminated then autopsied, revealing that pleasure centers in her brain were severely damaged and testosterone levels were increased. More tests pending.

**Input:**  20 doses MDMA, 20 does of LSD, and 20 doses "Viagra" 
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One hundred (100) 17µg gel capsules, golden and luminescent. One (1) capsule administered to male D-class test subject, with effects identical to "Fine" output appearing after 30 seconds. Subject was very docile and, while coherent, would not answer questions. After 15 minutes, subject entered a catatonic state for a period of 74 hours during which time subject was observed to have seizures resulting in ejaculation. Upon awakening, subject displayed a marked deadening of emotion, showed no interest in pleasurable activities, and was unable to be sexually aroused. When interviewed, subject stated he "just didn't care anymore". Subject terminated and autopsied, show sever damage specific to emotional centers of the brain. More tests pending. 

//Note: While there may be possible therapeutic benefits to the "Fine" and "Very Fine" outputs, I suggest that more tests be run on subjects of both genders. The output results are to be kept in my office safe unless being tested.// -Dr. Palmer

**Input:** 1x PDA Containing SCP-317
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** Various individual parts that, when assembled, formed a non-functioning 
mechanical device of same shape and proportions as the PDA.

**Input:** 1x PDA Containing SCP-317
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** [DATA EXPUNGED] Quickly began 'Replicating'. Took several dozen Class D personnel to contain, but no casualties as it did not seem interested in harming them. Destroyed.

//Note: It was disturbingly organic in its outward appearance. Almost... human. Could this mean a connection between 317 and 228? The meaning of this is being looked into.//
- Dr. Ruben █████
//Note: The machine is normally very random with its changes- yet twice in a row, it simply created another PDA that had a different SCP program on it. Between this and the device's strange behavior when 808 is in the vicinity of it, it almost appears as if the device has preferences when dealing with other SCPs. I believe further investigation is needed into this matter.//

*Name:** Dr. P██████ Gibbons
**Date:** [DATA EXPUNGED]
**Total items:** 5x regular cubes of Telekill Alloy [[[SCP-148]]], with a volume of 0.4 cubic meters, making a total of 2 (Two) cubic meters.

**Input:** 1x cube of Telekill Alloy for each setting.

**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** 25x regular cubes of Telekill Alloy, each with a volume of 0.016 cubic meters

**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** 1x cube of unknown dark-blue metal, with a volume of 0.2 cubic meters. The fact that it's two times smaller to the original input cube suggests that the density of the material is two times greater than the Telekill Alloy. With an original melting point of 700ºC, and an evaporation point of 1400ºC, it has been noticed that, if temperature of the metal reaches below 0ºC, the color of the metal changes to a lighter blue and physical properties change. This metal has an unknown melting point, as focused, concentrated heat of over 20000ºC has not melted it. Catalogation for SCP has been raised to 05-7 personnel and denied.


**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** 1x cube of unknown light-red metal, with a volume of 1.2 cubic meters. Size is three times that of the original input, suggesting that the input Telekill Alloy is three times more dense than the output. Metal has a melting point of 700ºC and an evaporation point of 1400ºC, matching with the 'Coarse' output, although does not show the same physical properties change when reaching 0ºC, like the previous output. Metal, when touched by a sentient human being, inhibits all senses for a period of 30 (thirty) minutes after the first time is touched (that is, if the object is held for 5 seconds, the period of inhibition will last 30 minutes and 5 seconds). Witnesses have later described it as a "VERY unpleasant experience," and also manifested sensations of "wild hallucinations," similar to a near-overdose of Lysergic Acid. --SCP catalogation pending.-- //SCP catalogation approved by O5-█, Output now known as [[[SCP-506]]].//

//The 30 scariest minutes of my fucking life. Note to self: Use the damn gloves. Second note to self: Ask Clef if he wants bracelets of this for his birthday. -Dr. Gibbons//

**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Sculpture resembling [[[SCP-682]]] made out of Telekill Alloy, with a volume 0.4 cubic meters. Output has not shown any kind of sentient manifestations, although any contact or approach near [[[SCP-682]]] is denied until further notice.

//Now, I would like this for my dekstop, if you don't mind. -Dr. Gibbons//

**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** [DATA EXPUNGED].
//Creepy. How the fly got into the input chamber, I don't know. -Dr. Gibbons//

**Test 11828-U5:** Tests on the nature and construction of SCP-914

With approval from 05 Command, A single gear was removed from one of the "outer" sections of SCP-914.  Placement was carefully documented, and was in a location that would not release tension on any belts, or damage any documented sections.  Testing area was cleared and sealed after placing a steel block in the "intake" booth.  D-00104 was dispatched to SCP-914, and instructed to turn the key and activate SCP-914.

D-00104 reported that "the key won't catch", and it was observed the key turned several times without tightening the mainspring.  No activity of any kind was observed from SCP-914 during this time.

Missing gear was replaced with a identical copy, comprised of the same metal (brass) as the original.  Steel block re-inserted into the "intake" booth, and SCP-914 was activated on the "1:1" setting.  SCP-914 observed to operate normally, with a slight pause of 3.5 seconds after winding the key.  After "refining", Output observed to be a solid steel sphere with the same volume as the original steel block.  Original gear returned to SCP-914.

**Notes:**  //Well, thank god we can at least repair the damn thing if we damage it...assuming we can find what's broken in it.  Hell, maybe it's already broken, i don't know...this damn thing hurts my head...
