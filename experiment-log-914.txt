//Note from Doctor//: There seems to be some difficulty as to the meaning of "fine" and "coarse" on the settings; the machine appears to be capable of refining input based either on a scale of complexity (loss of entropy accompanied by increase in connectivity between components and/or acquisition of subjective meaning) or of simplification (separation into composite materials and loss of meaning).

//Notes from Dr.Gears:// it appears there is a high level of randomness when SCP-914 "refines" a item.  However, it seems to preserve some element of it's original composition, in this example, clockworks.  This is not a law, but a high probability.  Refine a metal bar, and you're more likely to get a simple metal object than a internal combustion engine.  Both, however, are possible.

**Name:**Dr. V███  Palmer
**Date:** ██/██/20██

**Total Items:** 80 doses of MDMA (150 mg dosage), 80 doses of gelatin LSD, high potency solution  (150 ug dosage), and 40 doses of Sildenafil [trademark, "Viagra"] (50 mg dosage).

**Input:**  20 doses MDMA, 20 does of LSD, 
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** A small pile of powder weighing approximately 165 mg. Chemical composition identical to input.

**Input:**  20 doses MDMA, 20 does of LSD
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:**  Twenty (20) 160 mg gel capsules, yellow-green in color. One (1) capsule administered to male D-class test subject, resulting in subject experiencing effects of intense euphoria, marked improvement in mood, and some psychedelic visuals after a period of 25 minutes. Effects lasted for 10 hours, after which subject experienced a "crash" with symptoms of a bad hangover and severe depression lasting for a two week period. More tests pending, but effect seems to be a combination of both drugs with a more severe "crash" period than unrefined MDMA. 

**Input:**  20 doses MDMA, 20 does of LSD, and 20 doses "Viagra" 
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One hundred (100) 16.5 µg gel capsules, opalescent yellow in color. One (1) capsule administered to female D-class test subject, resulting in intense euphoria, a feeling of "serenity", and had a strong desire to be in close physical contact with others, with onset occur after a period of 5 minutes. Subject remained in this state for a period of 78 hours, after which subject entered a catatonic state lasting a period of nearly four weeks. Subject showed extreme hostility after awakening and appeared to be in intense pain. Subject was terminated then autopsied, revealing that pleasure centers in her brain were severely damaged and testosterone levels were increased. More tests pending.

**Input:**  20 doses MDMA, 20 does of LSD, and 20 doses "Viagra" 
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One hundred (100) 17µg gel capsules, golden and luminescent. One (1) capsule administered to male D-class test subject, with effects identical to "Fine" output appearing after 30 seconds. Subject was very docile and, while coherent, would not answer questions. After 15 minutes, subject entered a catatonic state for a period of 74 hours during which time subject was observed to have seizures resulting in ejaculation. Upon awakening, subject displayed a marked deadening of emotion, showed no interest in pleasurable activities, and was unable to be sexually aroused. When interviewed, subject stated he "just didn't care anymore". Subject terminated and autopsied, show sever damage specific to emotional centers of the brain. More tests pending. 

//Note: While there may be possible therapeutic benefits to the "Fine" and "Very Fine" outputs, I suggest that more tests be run on subjects of both genders. The output results are to be kept in my office safe unless being tested.// -Dr. Palmer
