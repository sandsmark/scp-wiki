**Note to all Researchers:**  
please include your name on all records, along with date and total number of items "refined".  

Researchers are responsible for all "Output".  Should damage or loss of life occur, the researcher will be subject to judicial review and possible disciplinary action.  

Biological testing has been suspended.  Any biological testing must be cleared by 05 Command.

**Name:** Dr. Byron with Dr. █████ assisting
**Date:** ██/█/20██
**Total items:** Five (5) copies of Nathaniel Hawthorne's //The Scarlet Letter//

**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** 1x block of wood the same size as the original book; 1x unlabeled ink cartridge presumably for a high-speed printer.

**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** 1x 500-page manuscript detailing revisions to //The Scarlet Letter,// including an unreleased chapter.  A literature historian was consulted regarding the authenticity, results are not conclusive. 

**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** 1x copy of Nathaniel Hawthorne's //The House of Seven Gables//

**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** 1x copy of //The Scarlet Letter// as part of the "Childrens' Literature Classics Series;" an abbreviated version of the original book with simpler language.

**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** 1x six (6) page document summarizing //The Scarlet Letter.//

//Note from Dr. Byron:// This experiment was suggested to me by my son, who got visibly upset when I refused to give him the result from the "Very Fine" setting.  While I admire his ingenuity and interest in following in his father's footsteps, I must not encourage my son to cut corners, especially in his schooling.  I did, however, give him the output from 1:1 so he could "manually process this intake at a 'Very Fine' setting."

**Input:** Miniature airship
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** Helium balloon, green

//Note from Doctor//: There seems to be some difficulty as to the meaning of "fine" and "coarse" on the settings; the machine appears to be capable of refining input based either on a scale of complexity (loss of entropy accompanied by increase in connectivity between components and/or acquisition of subjective meaning) or of simplification (separation into composite materials and loss of meaning).

**Name:** Dr.Gears
**Date:** ██/█/20██ 
**Total items:** 4X clockwork pocket watch, belonging to Dr.Gears

**Input:** 1 gold-plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Small clockwork bird.  when the tail is pressed, it produces a robin's call.

**Input:** 1 gold-plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Toy clockwork train engine.

**Input:** 1 gold- plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Miniature grandfather clock, fully functional.

**Input:** 1 gold- plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Small metal sculpture of a piano.

//Notes from Dr.Gears:// it appears there is a high level of randomness when SCP-914 "refines" a item.  However, it seems to preserve some element of it's original composition, in this example, clockworks.  This is not a law, but a high probability.  Refine a metal bar, and you're more likely to get a simple metal object than a internal combustion engine.  Both, however, are possible.
