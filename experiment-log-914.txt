**Test 11828-U5:** Tests on the nature and construction of SCP-914

With approval from 05 Command, A single gear was removed from one of the "outer" sections of SCP-914. Placement was carefully documented, and was in a location that would not release tension on any belts, or damage any documented sections. Testing area was cleared and sealed after placing a steel block in the "intake" booth. D-00104 was dispatched to SCP-914, and instructed to turn the key and activate SCP-914.

D-00104 reported that "the key won't catch", and it was observed the key turned several times without tightening the mainspring. No activity of any kind was observed from SCP-914 during this time.

Missing gear was replaced with a identical copy, comprised of the same metal (brass) as the original. Steel block re-inserted into the "intake" booth, and SCP-914 was activated on the "1:1" setting. SCP-914 observed to operate normally, with a slight pause of 3.5 seconds after winding the key. After "refining", Output observed to be a solid steel sphere with the same volume as the original steel block. Original gear returned to SCP-914.

**Notes:** //Well, thank god we can at least repair the damn thing if we damage it...assuming we can find what's broken in it. Hell, maybe it's already broken, I don't know...this damn thing hurts my head...

**Total items:** 4x clockwork pocket watch, belonging to Dr.Gears

**Input:** 1x gold-plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Small clockwork bird. When the tail is pressed, it produces a robin's call.

**Input:** 1x gold-plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Toy clockwork train engine.

**Input:** 1 gold-plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Miniature grandfather clock, fully functional.

**Input:** 1 gold-plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Small metal sculpture of a piano.

//Notes from Dr. Gears:// It appears there is a high level of randomness when SCP-914 "refines" an item. However, it seems to preserve some element of its original composition, in this example, clockworks. This is not a law, but a high probability. Refine a metal bar, and you're more likely to get a simple metal object than a internal combustion engine. Both, however, are possible.

**Name:** Dr. Gears
**Date:**██/██/████
**Total number of objects:** Three (3) copies of all documentation, photographs, and test logs accumulated in relation to SCP-914.

**Input:** One (1) Copy of SCP-914 documentation
**Setting:** 1:1 
**Output:** Folder containing all previously entered documents, arranged in chronological order.

**Input:** One (1) Copy of SCP-914 documentation
**Setting:** Fine 
**Output:** Hard-bound book containing 400 pages. No diagrams, photos, or other visual aids of any kind are included. The pages appear to be solid black, but microscopic examination shows each page to be covered in approximately twenty thousand characters. The text has no correlation with any known writing style, and is not in a linear format, with "sentences" constructed from individual characters spread out between many pages. Each sentence requires an exceedingly complex formula to decode, with each formula unique to each sentence. //(Note: Current decoding work has resulted in two partially translated sentences after 225 work-hours. Item appears to be a record of the internal structure of SCP-914)//

**Input:** One (1) Copy of SCP-914 documentation
**Setting:** Very Fine 
**Output:** Single sheet of paper. Weight is exactly the same as the entered documentation. The sheet appears to be be a single page from the entered SCP-914 documentation, however when flipped over to the right, the reverse side is the following page in sequence. When flipped over to the left, the opposite side is the preceding page in sequence. No new documentation is included, however this item is significantly easier to store, if more time-consuming to browse.

//(**Memo from General ████████:** It's screwing with us, you know that right? I don't CARE if it's been proven that it has no self-awareness, this thing is LAUGHING at us!)//

//Note from Dr. Gears//: There seems to be some difficulty as to the meaning of "fine" and "coarse" on the settings; the machine appears to be capable of refining input based either on a scale of complexity (loss of entropy accompanied by increase in connectivity between components and/or acquisition of subjective meaning) or of simplification (separation into composite materials and loss of meaning).

**Notes from Dr. Cenh:** This may imply that [[[SCP-914]]] has an understanding of religion. More experiments with religious items are indicated.

//This test may indicate that SCP-914 understands the use of input objects and not simply their function. Recommend testing with medicines reliant on the placebo effect to ascertain if outputs provide actual medicinal solutions to problems.// -Dr. Pyrrhus

Installation security forces were ordered to high alert. Twenty-four hours passed with no signs of activity from the subject. Subject proved unresponsive to all stimuli and was pronounced dead thirty-six hours later. Necropsy was unable to identify a cause of death nor any anatomical revisions attributable to SCP-914. Remains preserved for further study.

**Setting:** Very Fine

**Date:** ██/█/20██
**Total items:** One (1) set photocopies and duplicates of lab notes and other research material on SCP-914.

**Input:** 1x set of research materials
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One leather-bound tome, 54cm x 42cm, 256 vellum pages, with title written in gold leaf. Language of the title and the contents were at first unidentifiable, and were later discovered to be an old dialect of Finnish. The contents are written in calligraphy, and more than half the pages are elaborately illuminated with colored inks and gold and silver leaf. Once translated, the contents proved to be identical to the contents of the input material, arranged chronologically. The tome has been radiocarbon dated to the early 11th century C.E.

Anachronistically, a leather pocket is sewn into the inside back cover, and this pocket contains what appears to be a modern compact disc, 10cm in diameter. Data on this disc is encoded by an unknown codec. Attempts to divine the codec and decipher the data are ongoing.

//Note: It's a pity the contents of this tome are classified. It's a piece worthy of any museum. I've never seen such exquisite calligraphy. The illuminations may prove to be the most interesting part of the book, though. They often portray clockworks and related mechanical parts as well as some of the input or output objects; possibly they relate in a direct rather than abstract way to the operation of SCP-914 as described on the illuminated pages.//
