**Test 11828-U5:** Tests on the nature and construction of SCP-914

With approval from 05 Command, a single gear was removed from one of the "outer" sections of SCP-914. Placement was carefully documented, and was in a location that would not release tension on any belts or damage any documented sections. Testing area was cleared and sealed after placing a steel block in the "intake" booth. D-00104 was dispatched to SCP-914, and instructed to turn the key and activate SCP-914.

D-00104 reported that "the key won't catch", and the key was observed to turn several times without tightening the mainspring. No activity of any kind was observed from SCP-914 during this time.

Missing gear was replaced with a identical copy, comprised of the same metal (brass) as the original. Steel block re-inserted into the "intake" booth, and SCP-914 was activated on the "1:1" setting. SCP-914 observed to operate normally, with a slight pause of 3.5 seconds after winding the key. After "refining", Output observed to be a solid steel sphere with the same volume as the original steel block. Original gear returned to SCP-914.

**Notes:** //Well, thank god we can at least repair the damn thing if we damage it... assuming we can find what's broken in it. Hell, maybe it's already broken, I don't know... this damn thing hurts my head...

**Total items:** 4x clockwork pocket watch, belonging to Dr. Gears

**Input:** 1x gold-plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Small clockwork bird. When the tail is pressed, it produces a robin's call.

**Input:** 1x gold-plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine

**Input:** 1 gold-plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Small metal sculpture of a piano.

//Notes from Dr. Gears:// It appears there is a high level of randomness when SCP-914 "refines" an item. However, it seems to preserve some element of its original composition, in this example, clockworks. This is not a law, but a high probability. Refine a metal bar, and you're more likely to get a simple metal object than a internal combustion engine. Both, however, are possible.

**Name:** Dr. Gears
**Date:**██/██/████
**Total number of objects:** Three (3) copies of all documentation, photographs, and test logs accumulated in relation to SCP-914.

**Input:** One (1) copy of SCP-914 documentation
**Setting:** 1:1 
**Output:** Folder containing all previously entered documents, arranged in chronological order.

**Input:** One (1) copy of SCP-914 documentation
**Setting:** Fine 
**Output:** Hard-bound book containing 400 pages. No diagrams, photos, or other visual aids of any kind are included. The pages appear to be solid black, but microscopic examination shows each page to be covered in approximately twenty thousand characters. The text has no correlation with any known writing style, and is not in a linear format, with "sentences" constructed from individual characters spread out between many pages. Each sentence requires an exceedingly complex formula to decode, with each formula unique to each sentence. //(Note: Current decoding work has resulted in two partially translated sentences after 225 work-hours. Item appears to be a record of the internal structure of SCP-914.)//

**Input:** One (1) copy of SCP-914 documentation
**Setting:** Very Fine 
**Output:** Single sheet of paper. Weight is exactly the same as the entered documentation. The sheet appears to be a single page from the entered SCP-914 documentation, however when flipped over to the right, the reverse side is the following page in sequence. When flipped over to the left, the opposite side is the preceding page in sequence. No new documentation is included, but this item is significantly easier to store, if more time-consuming to browse.

//(**Memo from General ████████:** It's screwing with us, you know that right? I don't CARE if it's been proven that it has no self-awareness, this thing is LAUGHING at us!)//

//Note from Dr. Gears:// There seems to be some difficulty as to the meaning of "fine" and "coarse" on the settings; the machine appears to be capable of refining input based either on a scale of complexity (loss of entropy accompanied by increase in connectivity between components and/or acquisition of subjective meaning) or of simplification (separation into composite materials and loss of meaning).

**Total items:** One (1) set photocopies and duplicates of lab notes and other research material on SCP-914.

**Input:** 1x set of research materials
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One leather-bound tome, 54cm x 42cm, 256 vellum pages, with title written in gold leaf. Language of the title and the contents were at first unidentifiable, and were later discovered to be an old dialect of Finnish. The contents are written in calligraphy, and more than half the pages are elaborately illuminated with colored inks and gold and silver leaf. Once translated, the contents proved to be identical to the contents of the input material, arranged chronologically. The tome has been radiocarbon dated to the early 11th century C.E.

Anachronistically, a leather pocket is sewn into the inside back cover, and this pocket contains what appears to be a modern compact disc, 10cm in diameter. Data on this disc is encoded by an unknown codec. Attempts to divine the codec and decipher the data are ongoing.

//Note: It's a pity the contents of this tome are classified. It's a piece worthy of any museum. I've never seen such exquisite calligraphy. The illuminations may prove to be the most interesting part of the book, though. They often portray clockworks and related mechanical parts as well as some of the input or output objects; possibly they relate in a direct rather than abstract way to the operation of SCP-914 as described on the illuminated pages.//

//Note 1: 04/01/10 - Dr. █████, a noted film enthusiast, entered a destructively excited emotional state upon learning of breadth of content, and, for project's protection, has been denied access to lab for study's duration. Requests for specific data from the object, however, are not to be rejected. No extraordinary data handling rules currently require enforcement, although this may change if Dr. █████'s interest becomes a dangerous obsession.//

//Note 2: 05/09/10 - This output is final. However, for the purposes of adding to the Foundation's storage capabilities, the object will spend further time in research to discern if recreation of new medium falls within safe limits.//

**Input:** One (1) DVD copy of 1999 motion picture "The Matrix"
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** One (1) heavily-worn VHS home video of Japanese schoolchildren acting out 1999 motion picture "The Matrix" in backyard.

**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One (1) 'Sony' brand speaker system. Sound quality was identical between the two, despite the differing manufacturers and materials.

 **Input:** One (1) 'Marshall' brand speaker system.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One (1) speaker system of unknown brand. When turned on and provided with music, sound produced was indistinguishable from the quality and timbre of a live performance by instrumentation.

**Input:** One (1) 'Marshall' brand speaker system.
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One (1) black sphere, assumed to be a single continuous speaker. When approached by D-9566, object scanned his head, emitted a sharp electronic beep, and began to emit sound at around 300 decibels. Mild structural damage was done to the test chamber, and all personnel within 500 m of the chamber sustained hearing damage of varying degrees, from temporary damage to permanent loss. Activation event was ended when Agent Kane opened fire on the object with his sidearm. While these shots missed the object, they did impact with D-9566, killing him and ceasing the event.
//Note: I can't believe the last thing I ever heard was Barry Manilow. We couldn't have found a D-Class with better music taste? -Dr. Maguire//

**Input:** 1 (One) £10 note
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** HK$100

//Note: Hong Kong was previously British territory prior to 1997. It is unknown whether SCP-914 chose HKD by chance or if it chose this currency due to Hong Kong's prior association with Great Britain, although the fact that it chose to use a note from the pre-handover era lends to the latter theory. Also of note is that HK$100 was, at the time of the test, almost equal in value to the £10 used as an input.//

**Input:** 1 (One) £10 note
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** 2 £5 notes, both from the same year as the input.

**Input:** 1 (One) £10 note

**Name:** Dr. Geralds
**Date:** 03/06/201█
**Total Items:** Three (3) lithium-ion batteries, manufactured by A123Systems

**Input:**  One (1) lithium-ion battery
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One (1) lithium-ion battery, manufactured by the Chinese company Hunan Shanshan Toda Advanced Materials Co., Ltd.

**Input:**  One (1) lithium-ion battery
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One (1) object that resembles an unmarked lithium-ion battery. Closer inspection revealed that much of the internal mass of the battery had been converted into a radioactive isotope of █████████, deriving power from its nuclear decay, with a design very similar to that used in many spacecraft. Object placed into storage.

**Input:**  One (1) lithium-ion battery
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** When the output door opened, air rushed into the output chamber as if a vacuum had been present within. The object is a black cube with two electrical nodes on the top, fifteen (15) cm across, and weighing exactly the weight of the input battery plus the air in the chamber. The object is unmarked, with the exception of a small printing on one side, warning users that the object contained antimatter, and advising caution. Antimatter composition of object has not yet been confirmed, but has shown no limit to energy capacity. Object currently under testing.

//Note: I think we should refrain from putting anything with a lot of potential energy into SCP-914 in the future. If the pressure wave from the air had damaged the output, all of Site-██ could have been destroyed. Not a pleasant thought.// -Dr. Geralds

**Input:** One (1) Crayola brand Marker, standard red color
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One (1) marker, no brand mark. Removing the cap reveals a bright red tip.

//Note: The tip seems to stay bright despite the level of light in the room. Testing proves that, not unlike the crayon, marks made by said marker glow red and radiate heat. Further testing needed; marker put in storage. Further testing proves marker to be safe. The marker will be placed in the lounge as well.//

**Name:** Dr. Guy
**Date:** ██/07/20██
**Total Items:** Five (5) ████████ Brand Pizza, all of the "Margherita" variety

**Input:** One (1) ████████ "Margherita" Brand Pizza
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** Various mounds of smashed tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, flour, and yeast.

**Input:** One (1) ████████ "Margherita" Brand Pizza
**Setting:** Course
**Output:** One (1) uncooked pizza, further examination shows the pizza to have been made from vastly inferior ingredients to the original pizza.

//Note: That was one of the worst pizzas I've ever tasted! It's almost shocking how poorly that machine managed to create it - Researcher Jan//

**Input:** One (1) ████████ "Margherita" Brand Pizza
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One (1) Adult sized serving of "Spaghetti Bolognase".

**Input:** One (1) ████████ "Margherita" Brand Pizza
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One (1) ████████ "Meat Feast" Brand Pizza. Several unknown types of meat were spotted on the pizza, including meat from the thought extinct  ████████████ ████████████ and SCP- ████.

//Note: How did it manage to get meat from ████? We can barely scratch that thing!- Dr. Guy//

**Input:** One (1) ████████ "Margherita" Brand Pizza
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One (1) seemingly unchanged ████████ "Margherita" Brand Pizza, however, upon consumption, the subject immediately believes there to be bones inside of the pizza, and will ask if they can get a different "boneless" pizza. This exact wording has been seen across multiple different D-Class personnel. There has been no evidence to prove the existence of any bones inside of the pizza, and any questioning about the pizza towards those who have eaten it merely ask for a replacement to the pizza.

//Note: Listen, do you want to be the one to tell them that no matter what they say, the pizza never contained any bones? - Researcher Jan//
