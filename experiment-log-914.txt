**Test 11828-U5:** Tests on the nature and construction of SCP-914

With approval from 05 Command, A single gear was removed from one of the "outer" sections of SCP-914. Placement was carefully documented, and was in a location that would not release tension on any belts, or damage any documented sections. Testing area was cleared and sealed after placing a steel block in the "intake" booth. D-00104 was dispatched to SCP-914, and instructed to turn the key and activate SCP-914.

D-00104 reported that "the key won't catch", and it was observed the key turned several times without tightening the mainspring. No activity of any kind was observed from SCP-914 during this time.

Missing gear was replaced with a identical copy, comprised of the same metal (brass) as the original. Steel block re-inserted into the "intake" booth, and SCP-914 was activated on the "1:1" setting. SCP-914 observed to operate normally, with a slight pause of 3.5 seconds after winding the key. After "refining", Output observed to be a solid steel sphere with the same volume as the original steel block. Original gear returned to SCP-914.

**Notes:** //Well, thank god we can at least repair the damn thing if we damage it...assuming we can find what's broken in it. Hell, maybe it's already broken, I don't know...this damn thing hurts my head...

**Total items:** 4x clockwork pocket watch, belonging to Dr.Gears

**Input:** 1x gold-plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Small clockwork bird. When the tail is pressed, it produces a robin's call.

**Input:** 1x gold-plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Toy clockwork train engine.

**Input:** 1 gold- plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Miniature grandfather clock, fully functional.

**Input:** 1 gold- plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Small metal sculpture of a piano.

//Notes from Dr. Gears:// It appears there is a high level of randomness when SCP-914 "refines" an item. However, it seems to preserve some element of its original composition, in this example, clockworks. This is not a law, but a high probability. Refine a metal bar, and you're more likely to get a simple metal object than a internal combustion engine. Both, however, are possible.

**Name:** Dr. Gears
**Date:**██/██/████
**Total number of objects:** Three (3) copies of all documentation, photographs, and test logs accumulated in relation to SCP-914.

**Input:** One (1) Copy of SCP-914 documentation
**Setting:** 1:1 
**Output:** Folder containing all previously entered documents, arranged in chronological order.

**Input:** One (1) Copy of SCP-914 documentation
**Setting:** Fine 
**Output:** Hard-bound book containing 400 pages. No diagrams, photos, or other visual aids of any kind are included. The pages appear to be solid black, but microscopic examination shows each page to be covered in approximately twenty thousand characters. The text has no correlation with any known writing style, and is not in a linear format, with "sentences" constructed from individual characters spread out between many pages. Each sentence requires a exceedingly complex formula to decode, with each formula unique to each sentence. //(Note: Current decoding work has resulted in two partially translated sentences after 225 work-hours. Item appears to be a record of the internal structure of SCP-914)//

**Input:** One (1) Copy of SCP-914 documentation
**Setting:** Very Fine 
**Output:** Single sheet of paper. Weight is exactly the same as the entered documentation. The sheet appears to be be a single page from the entered SCP-914 documentation, however when flipped over to the right, the reverse side is the following page in sequence. When flipped over to the left, the opposite side is the preceding page in sequence. No new documentation is included, however this item is significantly easier to store, if more time-consuming to browse.

//(**Memo from General ████████:** It's screwing with us, you know that right? I don't CARE if it's been proven that it has no self-awareness, this thing is LAUGHING at us!)//

//Note from Dr. Gears//: There seems to be some difficulty as to the meaning of "fine" and "coarse" on the settings; the machine appears to be capable of refining input based either on a scale of complexity (loss of entropy accompanied by increase in connectivity between components and/or acquisition of subjective meaning) or of simplification (separation into composite materials and loss of meaning).

**Total items:** One (1) set photocopies and duplicates of lab notes and other research material on SCP-914.

**Input:** 1x set of research materials
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One leatherbound tome, 54cm x 42cm, 256 vellum pages, with title written in gold leaf. Language of the title and the contents were at first unidentifiable, and were later discovered to be an old dialect of Finnish. The contents are written in calligraphy, and more than half the pages are elaborately illuminated with colored inks and gold and silver leaf. Once translated, the contents proved to be identical to the contents of the input material, arranged chronologically. The tome has been radiocarbon dated to the early 11th century C.E.

Anachronistically, a leather pocket is sewn into the inside back cover, and this pocket contains what appears to be a modern compact disc, 10cm in diameter. Data on this disc is encoded by an unknown codec. Attempts to divine the codec and decipher the data are ongoing.

//Note: It's a pity the contents of this tome are classified. It's a piece worthy of any museum. I've never seen such exquisite calligraphy. The illuminations may prove to be the most interesting part of the book, though. They often portray clockworks and related mechanical parts as well as some of the input or output objects; possibly they relate in a direct rather than abstract way to the operation of SCP-914 as described on the illuminated pages.//

**Date:** 2013/03/01
**Total Items:** Two (2) Beretta 98 handguns.
//Researcher's Note: We've yet to test if 914's effects are cumulative.//

**Input:** One (1) Beretta 98 handgun.
**Setting:** Very Fine.
**Output:** One black handgun with no identifiable markings. The weapon lacks a magazine and fires a high-power laser pulse, similar to the Nautilus Laser System, that penetrated the walls of the testing chamber and caused noticeable damage to Site 19.

**Input:** The results of the previous test.
**Setting:** Coarse.
**Output:** A series of miniscule parts, along with a small battery and the black casing of the weapon. Contents were put into storage.
//That was interesting. It appears that opposite sides of the dial do not exactly reverse the other's effects.//

**Input:** One (1) Beretta 98 handgun.
**Setting:** Fine.
**Output:** An ordinary-looking magazine, filled with 9 mm IMI rounds.
//Note: Normally, the results of the experiment would be tested vigorously. I'm sure it would have some freakish effect that would destroy most of the facility, but in this case, the only purpose it holds is to be the subject of the next trial.//

**Input:** The magazine from the previous test.
**Setting:** Fine.
**Output:** One 9 x 21 mm cartridge. Mass is identical to one Beretta 98.
**Testing:** The cartridge was fired in the Foundation's nuclear testing facility. Agent Smithers with some difficulty fired the round at D-1743. After viewing enhanced and slowed recordings of the incident, the bullet, after exiting the D-Class' left foot, changed direction and proceeded to go through the left feet of one other D-Class, two other researchers', four other agents', and eight security guards'. The bullet seemed to target the next individual closest to D-1743, before moving onto the next closest, other than Agent Smithers, who was not targeted. Analysis of the site post-incident showed that the bullet had traveled through steel walls, reinforced glass, clothing, and the ground with no apparent decrease in velocity.
//Note: The total count of victims is fifteen. The magazine of the Beretta used in the experiment held fifteen bullets.//
//Repeat experiments will have to be done, but I think it is safe to say that cumulative trials appear to have an exponential rate of increase on the anomalous effect of the item. In other words, two "fines" create a far more...powerful effect than a "very fine." Thank God he didn't shoot him in the head.//

**Output:** 1x Intel Core i5-6600K CPU @ 3.7 GHz. Outputted with a small overclock, performed as expected in number-intensive applications.

**Input:** 1x Intel Core i5-6600K CPU @ 3.7 GHz
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** 1x Intel Core i7-6950X CPU @ 4.8 GHz, with its pins capable of morphing to fit the socket of any given computer with no loss in performance. Despite the remarkably huge overclock, the test computer located in a separate test room did not lock up or freeze. During a 15-minute stress test, its thermal output was rated at 17.1 kJ, even though the processor should have output ~273 kJ in that time.

**Input:** 1x Intel Core i7-6950X CPU @ 4.8 GHz
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** 1x █████ Core i9-870E CPU @ 17.3 GHz, with morphing pins as observed before. Outputs only 7.8 kJ of thermal energy while capable of calculating the 49th Mersenne prime number (2^74207281 - 1) in 1/███ the time of the i5-4460.

**Input:** 1x █████ Core i9-870E CPU @ 17.3 GHz
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A chemically-unidentifiable, smooth metallic cube of roughly 4x4x4 centimeters, colored dark grey with one side capable of morphing to fit any known computer socket. No processor statistics were displayed on the computer when running, and while in-use gave off a subtle humming noise. Thermal readings have been inconclusive, however on direct contact with the cube in-use Dr. ████████ noted that it felt "colder than lukewarm".

Immediately after shutting down the test computer, the cube [REDACTED] causing ██.█% of gases in the test room to [REDACTED] resulting in █ casualties and subsequent vaporization of the cube. No traces of the cube have been found since, except for small amounts of gamma radiation from the moment it vaporized.

//Note: While the cube processor would've been an extremely useful tool for intense calculations and simulations (such as [CLASSIFIED]), it was quite clearly designed for a different power modulation circuit or computing unit, such as one in the future. How SCP-914 is capable of creating these advanced pieces of technology is still unknown, and yet it leaves the researchers more curious than ever.//

**Name:** Dr Hawk
**Date:** ██/██/2016
**Total Items:** 3x Blister packs containing eight vitamin-B12 supplement tablets, held inside a box labelled as ███████████████-manufactured Amoxycillin tablets.

**Input:** 1x Blister pack of vitamin B12 supplement tablets inside an Amoxycillin Box
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** 1x Blister pack containing 8 calcium supplement tablets, within a box labelled as ███████████████-manufactured Chloroquine.

**Input:** 1x Blister pack of vitamin B12 supplement tablets inside an Amoxycillin Box
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** 1x Blister pack of vitamin B supplement tablets. Upon qualitative analysis, the tablets were determined to contain between roughly 100% of the Recommended Daily Intake of all B-spectrum vitamins. Outer box was labelled as ████████████, with no other information. 

//Note: ████████████ was discovered by Dr. ███████ during a failed synthesis at Site-19, and is still undergoing testing by the Foundation as a general use antibiotic.//

**Input:** 1x Blister pack of vitamin B12 supplement tablets inside an Amoxycillin Box
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** 1x Blister pack of tablets with no markings or printings. Later testing determined the tablets contained 100% of an average human male's Recommended Daily Intake of all vitamins and minerals, except for Vitamin B-12. The box had been integrated into the blister pack, which lacked any labeling whatsoever.

//Note: The expected result was for the machine to turn the supplements, previously designed for use as placebos in the testing of ████████████, into ████████████. The labelling of the box as ████████████ during the second test implies some sort of awareness of what the items and their intended uses are.//
//Note: During the clinical testing of ████████████, the patient using the placebos generated by SCP-914 had the same level of improvement as the patients using ████████████.//

**Name:** Dr. Erikssen
**Date:** ██/██/2016
**Total Items:** 1x Remington Rolling Block rifle chambered in .303 British. 
5x 7.7x56mmR rounds.
1x Piece of A4 paper depicting the Blueprint of a █████ ████ musket.

**Input:** Above-mentioned materials.
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** The original rifle was replaced with a musket of unknown makings, the only similarities with a █████ ████ being the firing mechanism. Gunpowder contained in ten paper cartridges. Three lead balls found lying next to cartridges.
Brass casings presumably converted to brass ornaments present on musket. No flint was attached to the mechanism.

Flint was attached to mechanism, musket loaded and fired three times. Ballistics proved to be similar to original rifle.
Musket currently on display in Dr. Erikssen's office.

//Note: I don't think this proves SCP-914 to be sentient, and it merely "scanned" the blueprint, like a computer would do. -Dr. Erikssen//

**Name:** Researcher Prop
**Date:** ██/██/2016
**Total Items:** 1x blank sheet of paper, 1x pencil.

**Input:** Above mentioned materials. On the paper, the phrase "Tell us a little about yourself" was written in the aforementioned pencil.
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** The same piece of paper, as well as the pencil, with the phrase "You do not have the proper security clearance to take this action. Please contact an engineer working on this project if you believe this is incorrect, or file a report with [illegible] at your earliest convenience. Thank you" written on the paper below the previous phrase, in a currently unidentified typeface. The pencil had been sharpened, and was noticeably shorter than it previously was.

//So... whoever, or whatever, built this thing had some sort of hierarchy. That... tells us very little, actually. I don't know what I was expecting.
