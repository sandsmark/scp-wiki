SCP-1066 - Instant Education

I wrote this one in 2011, when I was 15 years old. I'm gonna be bitter forever until it's not my highest-rated article. I just don't think it's very good. It used to like..... fuckin' kill you hardcore, like everyone would come back injured in a ~thematic way~, but I took that out pretty quick. I snagged this spot right after Series 2 got opened before some asshole could try to put a Norman Conquest SCP there.

SCP-2418 - Hadrian's Well

Love me some ancient gays <3. There was a legit ancient rumor that Hadrian killed his boyfriend to cure him of some illness and this is an SCP for that. I think the MCD report isn't as good as it could be. I do like the poem I wrote in the SCP article and I think I should've written it in Latin also because poetic composition in dead languages usually impresses people. Also the name is a pun on Hadrian's Wall because duh.

SCP-2517 - This One Time I Saw God On Shrooms

Subtitled "God Was On Shrooms, Not Me". 

This one was inspired by a really intense mushroom trip during which I saw the fnords on my ceiling. It's heavily based on qntm's Antimemetics Division stuff, but it shouldn't require prior knowledge of that canon. It’s a hallucinogenic mushroom that acts as a mnestic and also cushions your mind from harmful memetic effects; it lets you see the Fifth Church's God/SCP-3125, an extradimensional meme-based organism that kills you and everyone with a similar mind if you perceive it. The mushrooms protect you from being erased and stop it from noticing you if you don't use them regularly, but don't protect your friends and family.

"Megatyphro" means "Big Cheese" in Greek, so Saint-Archon Horatius Megatyphro is Celebration "Big Cheese" Horace.

SCP-2573 - I ain’t never heard of no commy Fifthists or nothin'.

This was just me writing an SCP based on that exact line from the [[[Fifthism Hub]]]. I don't think I executed it well but it's like at +25 which is ok. Roll that frog footage.

SCP-2607 - Herpes ERPlex

To quote the Wikipedia page on phone sex, "A key advantage of phone sex, compared with physical intimacy, is that it cannot transmit a sexually transmitted infection."

The inspiration for this was a post on the OutOfContextSite19 tumblr, "Terrible SCP idea: an STD that is somehow transmissible by reading erotica." If you were the person who said this in #Site19, this is your child. Congratulations.

SCP-2766 - Aqua Caligula

The inspiration for this one was that I visited the upper end of the Aqua Claudia while I was studying abroad in Rome. It was the first appearance of the CPSO, which can get a tag if two people who aren't me use it in articles. Please. I want this.

SCP-3337 - Death of the Artist

I wrote this one after going to MoMa in New York while in the depths of a depressive episode. I was up on the top floor looking over a balcony and started having suicidal thoughts (the usual) and then i was like "wait, what if i got one of those gallery labels and stuck it to the wall and THEN jumped" and then i was like "wait what if that was an SCP". At first is was just the tag, which summoned a jumper like once a day, but then i switched it, which i thought worked better.

SCP-3853 - Imperium

Hnnnnnnghhhhh i want this to have more votes I don't know if I just posted it at a bad time and nobody saw it or if it's too long and nobody's finished it. Anyway I think it's good. It's literally just that the title "Emperor of Rome" is anomalous because Augustus fuckin sacrificed himself. That's pretty metal.
