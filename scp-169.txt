title:Scp 169
**Item #:** SCP-169

**Object Class:** Keter

**Standard Containment Procedures:** SCP-169 cannot and will not ever be contained. No structure on earth possesses the dimensions sufficient enough to contain the entirety of said object, as its mass is greater than the any of our containment facilities. The location of SCP-169 is currently unknown, but GPS suggests that the majority of its body is located somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean.

**Description:** Only parts of SCP-169 have been seen, so the entirety of the entity cannot be described accurately, however it is assumed that SCP-169 is a marine arthropod of enormous size, known only as the "Leviathan" to sailors and historians alike. Reasonably presumed at first to be a myth told by sailors, SCP-169 was photographed recently by a group of field agents investigating paranormal activity at a chain of islands (Latitude: ██████, Longitude: ██████). After several hours of investigation, the islands were reported to have moved at least three (3) kilometers from their original location, and the agents had begun to chase their assignment. Photographs taken by satellites reveal an enormous series of rock-like plates moving together and drifting slowly across the Atlantic.

Our researchers estimate that the creature's body length could easily extend lengths greater than that between New York City and Chicago, Illinois and may possess organic mass that has yet to be scientifically recorded by man. The creature is thought to have existed since Pre-Cambrian times, and no other specimens have been sighted.

The nature of the creature is unknown, such as its reproductive capabilities, food source, and nesting area (if any), and research regarding the subject is pending approval. The only information regarding the object is that it is immense and that its entirety has yet to be seen even by satellite. Several small land masses seem to have taken root on what appears to be its back, one which is inhabited by a small tribe of natives who live happily and undisturbed by their traveling homestead. However, were the creature to submerge completely, the tribe would most likely be destroyed.

The creature moves slowly, less than one kilometer per hour (1kph), but seems only to be adrift. It's method of propulsion is unknown, but the natives report that the creature "breathes" regularly about every three (3) months, causing minor shifts in the islands' terrain. This gives evidence that the creature is probably alive, but dormant in some way.

N.A.S.A. is currently cooperating with the Foundation in keeping the existence of this creature quiet, and is currently permitting the Foundation use of their satellites for photographic use.
