**Item #:** SCP-3944

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3944 is to be kept in a standard, locked storage unit at Site-56. Storage unit should be kept locked at all times to prevent accidental usage. The code to the storage unit can be obtained from the Site Supervisor following testing approval.

Transportation of SCP-3944 should be carried out by no more than three individuals, though typically two will be adequate. If more staff are required to be near SCP-3944, they must not come within a 1m radius of the object. Doing so will trigger SCP-3944's anomalous effect.

**Description:** SCP-3944 is an outdoor patio table from ███████. The object is a black iron round table, approximately 80cm in height with a radius of 61cm, the surface being made of 5mm tempered glass.

SCP-3944 causes a "loop" of interrupted thought processes. It is expressed as an instance of SCP-3944-1 stopping mid conversation to ask the instance to their immediate left if they can recall the topic of conversation, having a momentary lapse in train of thought mid-sentence. It is at this point a repetitive looping effect takes place. In a steady and consistent, sequential clockwise order, instances of SCP-3944-1 will begin repeating a series of questions and replies to each other. This will not stop until either an instance is removed from SCP-3944's radius, causing the number of subjects to fall below the minimum requirement for activation. 

Testing revealed that instances will not succumb to a lack of nutrition, dehydration or sleep deprivation. But upon cessation of SCP-3944's effect, SCP-3944-1 will expire or lose conciseness due to a lack of sustenance and exhaustion. The severity of which is directly proportional to the duration SCP-3944-1 is under the influence of SCP-3944.

SCP-3944's anomalous effect is triggered when four [[footnote]]Four being the minimum number needed for activation. The upper limit for this effect depends on the number of subjects that can fit within SCP-3944's radius of effect[[/footnote]] or more subjects, designated as SCP-3944-1[[footnote]] Specific designations will be assigned based on current number of affected individuals.[[/footnote]], are stationed within a 1m sphere around the objects edge. If these requirements are met, SCP-3944-1 will display the following symptoms:
* Subjects will begin to converse amongst themselves
* Subjects will rapidly experience extreme short term memory loss
* Paranoia 
* Loss of impulse control regarding spoken communication 

The combination of these symptoms creates the cognitive effect that only affects SCP-3944-1 instances. See Test Logs for in-depth information regarding the effects of SCP-3944.

SCP-3944 was brought to the Foundation's attention when a call was placed by an individual in ████████, California to local emergency responders.

The caller was distressed over the phone and explained that he and his wife were attempting to check up on some friends who had been missing for a few days. They had driven to their friend’s house, and after inspecting the back of the property they located the missing individuals. The caller reported that all their friends were "repeating themselves, and would not respond to anything". The Foundation was alerted by an imbedded agent within the Emergency Call Center to a possible anomalous event. Agents arrived shortly after to the location disguised as local law enforcement. After entering the residence agents detained any witnesses, as well as individuals responsible for the call.

It was discerned by Agent Haskell that the patio table was most likely the source of the anomaly after brief questioning of a detained individual. Unfortunately, Agent Haskell could not relay this information before Agent █████ entered SCP-3944's effect radius. Backup was called in, including a field researcher. The area was cordoned off under the guise of a gas leak, and Foundation elements secured the property until the nature and severity of SCP-3944 could be ascertained and containment implemented. All involved parties were debriefed and administered Class-A amnestics before release. See **Incident and Audio Log: 3944-01** for a recording of this incident.

> **Interviewed:** Michael Johnson, age 36, hereby designated POI-0001, originally placed the 911 call.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Agent Haskell, Field Agent responding to anomalous report.
> 
> **Foreword:** This is a transcript of audio recorded by Agent Haskell's standard field recording device. It describes an interaction with a detained suspect and later Agent █████ being influenced by SCP-3944.
> 
> **<Begin Log, 1924 hours>**
> 
> **Agent Haskell:** Mr. Johnson you need to tell me everything you know about what might have happened here.
> 
> **POI-0001:** What? I'm not in trouble, am I? I swear I had nothing to do with this! 
> 
> **Agent Haskell:** You are not in any trouble. I just need to make an accurate report of what might have happened here. You said in you call that you were "checking up on your friends". Can you tell me about that?
> 
> **POI-0001:** Well like I said on the phone, me and my wife were asked by ████'s[[footnote]] Owner of residence, age 40, male.[[/footnote]] parents to check up on them because no one had been able to reach them for days.
> 
> **Agent Haskell:** Have your friends out back ever exhibited any unusual behavior in the past? It doesn't have to relate to what we are experiencing now.
> 
> **POI-0001:** Not anything concerning, no. Definitely nothing like this, that’s for sure.
> 
> **Agent Haskell:** What can you tell me about the table outside?
> 
> **POI-0001:** The table? Why do you care about that? Aren't you going to help them I mean Jesus there is something wrong with them!
> 
> **Agent Haskell:** Relax. We are going to help them as best we can. Please answer my questions, this might be time sensitive matter.
> 
> **POI-0001:** Well ████ had mentioned buying it the other week. They bought new furniture since they just finished renovating their backyard. They said they wanted to have some people over a few days ago. But we couldn't make it.
> 
> **Agent Haskell:** And who are the other people around the table?[[footnote]] Agent Haskell is referring to the 4 non-primary residents of the home.[[/footnote]]
> 
> **POI-0001:** That would be ███, █████, ████ and ████. The first 2 went over for dinner and the latter came by the next day I believe to see the yard. It wasn't until today we got asked to check up on them. Guess they all decided to join in the craziness huh?
> 
> **Agent Haskell:** So wait. You're telling me they all showed up on different days and they all ended up acting this way?
>  
> **POI-0001:** Well yeah, I guess. As far as I know.
> 
> **Agent Haskell:** Shit! Stay here. Don't move!
> 
> *//It is at this point Agent Haskell ends his interaction with POI-0001 and began promptly making his way to the back of the property while trying to warn other agents//*
> 
> **Agent Haskell:** This is Agent Haskell! Possible mind-affecting skip! All agents do not approach the table or affected individuals! I repeat skip is mind-affecting!
> 
> *//After making it to the backyard Agent Haskell finds other agents standing around SCP-3944 and SCP-3944-1. Agent █████ at this point had already succumbed to SCP-3944 effect.//*
> 
> **Agent Haskell:** █████! Get away from there!
> 
> *//Agent █████ does not acknowledge Agent Haskell, a long-time coworker. Agent █████ is heard speaking to the SCP-3944-1 to his left. This is corroborated by other agents//*

> **Agent Haskell:** Great...
>  
> **<End Log, 2225>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** After Containment was established and SCP-3944-1 instances safely removed from the area of effect, both Agent █████, detained POIs and SCP-3944-1 instances were debriefed and administered Class-A amnestics. Agent █████ was later reprimanded for failing to exercise caution during the investigation of a possible SCP.

> **Test #:** 3944-01
> **Foreword:** SCP-3944 testing access granted to Researcher Dr. Daniels and Junior Researcher Dr. Shanon. They shall conduct all tests related to SCP-3944 unless transfer is deemed necessary. - Site Director  
> **Test Subjects:** D-class test subjects (D-01-D-06).
> **Test Parameters:** This test is meant to ascertain the scope of SCP-3944. Subjects will approach the object incrementally as instructed, and sit on one of four non-anomalous chairs placed around SCP-3944 until instructed otherwise.
> 
> **Results:** D-Class were instructed to form a line directly outside of the test chamber. One by one Dr. Daniels instructed D-Class to approach SCP-3944 and take a seat and to not speak to each other. After a total of four subjects had taken seats at SCP-3944, D-03 began telling a story to the other subjects. D-03 was reminded that they are not to speak, but all instructions were ignored. Remaining D-Class were not instructed to enter the room. By this point, D-03 was reaching what was assumed to be the climax of their conversation. Note that all other subjects around SCP-3944 are seen to be highly engaged in what D-03 is saying.
> 
> D-03 is observed to suddenly cease speaking. D-03 appears confused and expresses that they had lost their train of thought, and could not recall what was being talked about. D-03 looks to their left at D-01 and asks if they remembered the topic of the conversation. D-01 is heard denying knowledge themselves and proceeds to ask D-02 to their left the exact same question followed by the same reply from D-04. At this point all subjects are considered under the influence of SCP-3944.
> 
> Due to lack of data related to liberating test subjects from this effect. D-Class-01 though D-Class-04 were left under the effects of SCP-3944 for approximately two hours. A rope was thrown over the top of D-02 after some deliberation, and was pulled away from SCP-3944.
> 
> After being dragged approximately 1m, all subjects were suddenly freed from the effects of SCP-3944. 
> 
> **Researcher Notes:** We now have a minimum participant number for the activation of SCP- 3944. It was unfortunate that it took so long to remove the D-Class from it's effects. But we could not risk anyone else being influenced now that we activated it. Subjects were highly agitated and showed signed of high mental distress and trauma. It appears those under the effects of SCP-3944 are fully aware of their surroundings and actions. - Dr. Shanon

//*Site Director: Further research into a theoretical upper limit to the number of affected subjects is scheduled and approved.*//

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="+ Test Log-02: Upper Limit" hide="- Close"]]
> **Test #:** 3944-02
> **Test Subjects:** A total of 15 D-Class have been requisitioned. Designated D-01 though D-15.
> **Test Parameters:** The objective of this test is to ascertain an upper limit (if any) to the number of subjects that can be influenced by SCP-3944. Subjects are instructed to immediately approach the object and sit around, on top, under and stand around SCP-3944. Ensuring that the most space within 1m of SCP-3944 is occupied. All D-Class are fitted with remotely activated tethered harnesses for extraction.
> 
> **Results:** Junior Researcher Shanon gives the command for all D-Class to engage in the testing parameters. All test subjects approach SCP-3944 and promptly begin sitting around, on top of and below SCP-3944. Any subjects that could not seat themselves are instructed to stand as close as possible to the object. Please note that only 11 subjects could successfully position themselves in theoretical area of effect.
> 
> When asked, D-Class sitting on top of SCP-3944 describe it as being "Pretty solid for a cheap table". D-Class below SCP-3944 expressed discomfort and complained about not getting a "good seat". After approximately 10 minutes D-13 (Sitting atop the object) [[footnote]] It is uncertain how SCP-3944 chooses which subjects it affects first. This mechanism appears random.[[/footnote]]begins conversing with D-06 who was below the table, and upon further observation was technically closer then D-04 who was also seated to the left of D-13.
> 
> As with the previous test, all subjects begin forgetting the topic of conversation followed by repeated appeals for assistance from other subjects. An organized queue appears to form after the first round of questioning makes its way around all the test subjects. D-Class subjects at no point deviate from this order after it is established. Efforts to deviate this order is met with failure. 
> 
> After approximately 55 minutes the test was terminated and all D-Class systematically removed via tethers. During debriefing, it was noted that while all test subjects displayed previously observed post-test symptoms but to a lesser degree. Subject described being aware of what they were doing, but stated they could not stop themselves, and just "wanted to remember".
>    
> **Researcher Notes:** Due to differences in height, weight and build in available test subjects. We have concluded that the upper limit to the effect projected by SCP-3944 is only limited by the number of subjects that can fit within a 1m radius from the edge or surface of the object. It is also our recommendation that any researchers wishing to test SCP-3944, and not expose subjects to high mental stresses, should limit exposer to under 60 minutes. - Dr. Daniels
> 
//*Site Director: Further research into the limits of SCP-3944 and side effects of prolonged exposure approved.*//

[[collapsible show="+ Test Log-03: Stress Test" hide="- Close"]]
> **Test #:** 3944-03
> **Test Subjects:** 4 D-Class subjects.
> **Test Parameters:** Ascertain If SCP-3944 has a limited effect duration as well as any lethality. Subjects will be instructed to sit around SCP-3944 on 4 non-anomalous chairs. Once subjects are successfully under the influence of of SCP-3944, researchers will monitor D-Class fora total of 1 week. After 1 week, test will be terminated and D-Class extracted if possible.
>  
> **Results:** Researcher Daniels instructs subjects to take their seats at SCP-3944. After a short duration subjects, begin conversing followed by the onset of SCP-3944's main effect. The effect persists, unending for 1 week. During this time, the D-Class experianced no sleep deprivation, signs of hunger or dehydration, as well as no signs of vocal damage that would be expected after such extraneous vocalizing.
> 
> This ability to stave off bodily degradation only lasted while all subjects were under the influence of SCP-3944. Once the number of D-Class within the area of effect was reduced below 3, all subjects either lost consciousness or experienced seizures. Subjects struggled greatly to speak with researchers. After receiving medical treatment, those subjects that regained the ability too speak were no longer capable of forming coherent sentences. D-04 expired immediately during cessation of test.
> 
> **Researcher Notes:** SCP-3944's ability to essentially keep its victims alive while subjecting them to extreme mental abuse is profound. Based on D-Class testimony, the effects of SCP-3944 on their psyche is extreme following prolonged exposure. 
> 
> It is the opinion of both Dr. Shanon and myself that further testing not be carried out. We feel we have sufficient data to secure and contain SCP-3944. - Dr. Daniels

//*Site Director: Testing will continue until we understand the full capability of SCP objects in our care. Another test is scheduled and approved to ascertain the full scope of SCP-3944's effects. Researcher Daniels and Junior Researcher Shanon have been denied transfer and will perform the test as scheduled.*//

**Addendum-01:**
Investigations into ███████ as well as the manufacturer that supposedly produced SCP-3944 were deemed inconclusive. Both parties have denied creating and selling SCP-3944. Both companies have been designated GOI-03453-1 & GOI-03453-2 and are to be continually monitored for further instances of anomalous goods. Testing of SCP-3944 is currently under the direct supervision of Site-56's Site Director. No further testing is currently scheduled or approved.
