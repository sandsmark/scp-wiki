++ ATTENTION

**Artists**, **sculptors**, **hacks** and **frauds**, come one, come all, come along but goddammit, //come//!

//See// **Sind Wir Jetzt Cool Lichtenberg**, the dirt-caked underdogs of Outer Lichtenberg, fight for their lives against an existential threat to their home's very thesis! //Watch// as they scramble to assemble the barricades, man the windows, ready their scooters and weapons and paint! //Lend your hand// to these wretches in need, or sit idly by as **the Fourth Reich** secures Outer Lichtenberg once and for all!

Chemical weapons shall fly! Psuedoscience will be put to the test! Blood will cake the cobblestones!

For once in your life, see Outer Lichtenberg painted
+ BLACK AND WHITE AND RED ALL OVER!
