**<Commence Log>**
> 75:58:42 - [Dr. █████ is seen sitting at a desk similar to that in his own office, peeling a kiwi fruit with a small knife.]
> 
> 75:58:57 - [Dr. █████ suddenly jerks his arm and drops the knife, seeming to have sliced his hand by accident.  A low chuckle is heard from SCP-1743-3. Dr. █████ looks up and grimaces, still holding his wound.]
> 
> 75:59:07 - **Dr. █████:** What the [expletive] is so funny?  Where are you and why are you doing this?
> 
> 75:59:16 - [No reply from SCP-1743-3.  Dr. █████ places his head on the desk and sobs for several minutes.]
> 
> 76:08:19 - [Dr. █████ reaches into one of the desk drawers and removes a handgun.  It misfires and startles him, causing him to fall backwards out of his chair and hit his head.  SCP-1743-3 responds with roaring laughter.]
> 
> 76:08:37 - **Dr. █████:** St... Stop it... STOP LAUGHING AT ME!
> 
> 76:08:45 - [Laughter becomes progressively louder to the point of screaming.  Dr. █████ fumbles for the firearm and readies the barrel in his mouth.
> 
> 76:09:02 - [The pistol fires, killing Dr. █████.  Laughter ceases.]
> 
> 76:09:53 - [After several seconds of complete stillness, Dr. █████ animates and rises to his feet, despite the fatal wound.  He approaches the front of the stage, joined by several instances of SCP-1743-2, and all proceed to bow.  SCP-1743-3 responds with applause.]
> 
> 76:13:43 - [Applause ceases.  Dr. █████ becomes inanimate once more and falls off the stage into the audience area.  All SCP-1743-2 instances return    backstage.]
