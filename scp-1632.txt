**Item #:** SCP-XXXX

**Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to its nature, containment of SCP-XXXX is to focus on the capture and relocation of SCP-XXXX-01 instances. SCP-XXXXX-1 instances are to be stored in a standard humanoid containment cell in Site 45, and fed according to the standard Humanoid Nutrition chart.  Police reports in Nevada are to be monitored in order to discover any instance of SCP-XXXX-1. All found advertisements featuring SCP-XXXX are to be removed. Any found SCP-XXXX client is to be administered Class-A Amnesiacs.

SCP-XXXX places advertisements offering its services as a professional attorney-at-law, specializing in divorce cases. SCP-XXXX's actions are focused on civilians in the state of Nevada. These advertisements can appear in multiple sources and formats, including flyers, internet popups, Craigslist entries, and billboards. Hosts of these advertisements are unable to recall any information regarding SCP-XXXX, other than his appearance.

In every advertisement, a sequence of 10 unknown symbols appear where a telephone number would normally be placed. Test have shown this sequence to be a low-threat visual cognitohazard which cause the symbols appear to be random numbers. However, individuals who require of SCP-XXXX's services are able to contact SCP-XXXX using the number provided. All attempts made by the Foundation to obtain the correct telephone number have failed.

SCP-XXXX will assist its clients(s) with the various legal processes of obtaining a divorce from a spouse. SCP-XXXX does not appear in the vicinity of Foundation employees or recording equipment, making surveillance of its appearance difficult. Clients of SCP-XXXX report it's service to be helpful and inexpensive. Attempts to transfer a client from SCP-XXXX's involvement to a Foundation appointed lawyer result in the client's dissatisfaction of the new lawyer, and request that SCP-XXXX be brought back to the case. Administration of Class-A Amnesiacs to clients have proven successful in halting SCP-XXXX cases.

When a divorce case is finished, SCP-XXXX, its client, and the client's former spouse will disappear. After a few hours, an instance of SCP-XXXXX-1 will appear where the client was. SCP-XXXX-1 refers to a biological entity that consist of a SCP-XXXX client and the client's former spouse physically fused together. SCP-XXXX-01 instances are usually found wrapped in white cloth, for an unknown purpose. SCP-XXXX-1 instances tend to be radically different in the method of fusion, ranging from both partners becoming fused at the pelvis reigon, to appearing as a mass of non-discernible tissue . However, nervous and respiratory systems are not modified, allowing both partner use cognitive functions and vocalize respectively. All attempts surgical separation, even when the procedure itself is relatively harmless, have been met with failure.

>
> **SCP-XXXX-1A:** Honey, you should probably skip to the important part.
>
> **SCP-XXXX-1B:** Alright then. After about two weeks after all of the papers were submitted, I woke up in this strange place, in my wedding dress. It was like a chapel.
