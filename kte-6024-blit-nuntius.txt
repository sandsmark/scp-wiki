The initial report of KTE-6024 is displayed below, documented after the disappearance of a Coalition operative led to discovery of the entity.
> ||~ Parathreat Investigation||
>
> __**Special Observer:**__ “Reisender” 65243383/9NQ
> 
> __**Overview:**__ An infectious memetic hazard limiting communicative ability has been identified in western Germany.
> 
> __**Parathreat Evidence:**__ Following the disappearance of operative 42188945/11M “Naps”, assessment team #11M “Gatherers” was deployed to west Germany to recover operative. As a recovery overseer operative, I was included in the operation. Naps was recovered in █████████, a small rural German community six days after disappearance.
> 
> Naps showed immense relief on recovery, but failed to understand anything spoken by the assessment team. After a failed attempt at communication, Naps willingly entered GOC custody. Further testing with Naps found he didn't understand written language either. Analysis of the town showed approximately one-fifth of the population displayed similar behavior.
> 
> No physical symptoms, though Naps showed considerable mental trauma from his failure to understand language. Naps had no recollection of any events in the week he had gone missing.
> 
> __**Suggested Response/Requests:**__ We need to lock this down fast. While we are currently unsure of its method of transmission, we do know that it is highly infectious. Immediate lockdown and quarantine must be established immediately in the populated area.
> 
> Communication to the outside world must be prohibited in the quarantined area. Total elimination of all internet-accessing devices in the area recommended. Research into previous outward communications from the town must be tracked and checked for signs of this anomaly.
> 
> We need PTOLEMY to get on this ASAP. We still don't know its exact methods of transmission or its full effects. We need to trace the origins of this anomaly as well. If another organization developed this, we're in big trouble.

The destruction of █████████,  ████████ and █████████, despite internal conflict among the Council and other divisions, was deemed absolutely necessary by High Command. Though cover stories were implemented, the mass population suppression has resulted in considerable public interest about the event. Quarantine measures to isolate these areas were implemented.

||||||~ Subject|| RE: Countermeme||
|||||||| That's going to be a real challenge. We're on it, of course, but there are so many angles of this thing we have to deal with. I mean, this thing destroys communication up to a base level, and then it also spreads like crazy? It seems impossible. Definitely beyond the capabilities of what we have currently. Now, if we had access to some of the class-LX materials in Base-A9, that might be a different story. _
 _
With the aforementioned resources, I believe we should have a workable prototype available in a matter of weeks. I’d say we could put the deadline out to be around April. Honestly, I think the rest of High Command will be rather impressed with what we’re working with. Once the prototype’s available, they’ll be the first to know. _
 _
On a side note, I can't help but voice concern over certain aspects of the project. Just on a conceptual level, this ‘countermeme’ could affect millions in a matter of weeks, if not days. And if it gets in the internet? That’s a possibility I wouldn’t want to think about. Still, I know you’re on top of this, and I trust your judgement. I would just rather not be responsible for some of the consequences that could arise if this not executed correctly. _
 _
Nevertheless, I understand your orders and the memetics wing will continue work on the project. _

This report from the Operation Plains Talk Overseer General was relayed to High Command seven days after the first phase of Operations Plains Talk was completed.
> ||~ 6024 FIELD REPORT NO. 4||
> 
> High Command,
> 
> Initial procedures have proven ineffective in the containment and subsequent destruction of the memetic effect. We’ve found people who can’t talk or read as far as 4 kilometers away from the quarantined area, which is nothing but a gaping hole now. Assessing and identifying the countermeme has been problematic, mainly because by the time an operative notices an infected individual, they’ve usually become infected themselves and have to be eliminated. Many of the assessment teams are hesitant to continue the operation with the current rate of deaths. Of course, they will continue to follow their orders.
> 
> We’re working on expanding the quarantine zone, but there are certain challenges present with establishing this. As you could imagine, there is a great deal of chaos and confusion present, which, paired with the high infection rate, makes establishing order difficult. The people here are mad, despondent and confused. Without speaking or writing, it’s not easy to convey that we’re trying to help. We’ve established some basic procedures to keep operatives from infection, but we’re losing a lot of people out here.

The following letter was sent by the Bavarian Illuminati to GOC High Command ten days after the beginning of Operation Plains Talk. With this contribution, the second phase of Operations Plains Talk was implemented, shifting the focus of the operation from liquidation to containment.

> We have found it in our best interests to contribute the additional resources recommended by High Command in order to suppress this rapidly growing threat entity. 11 permanent high-energy electromagnetic disruptors (designated as +1Gen-HED) have been removed from storage and are being securely transported to their individual locations via armed vanguard. As per Coalition recommendation, they will be spaced evenly from each other within the quarantined area, and will permanently disable all electronic equipment within the quarantine site plus an additional range of 3 kilometers outside of the quarantined area.

||||||~ Subject||Countermeme Project Resignation||
||||||||Mr. Khalil, _
 _
I must inform you and the rest of High Command with regret that the memetics wing will no longer continue research on the countermeme project. Current research has only served to prove that the utter effectiveness of this object would not only be a liability, but a clear, uncontrollable global threat. Even though the majority of High Command has expressed interest in further development of this project, I am certain that there is no possibility that the Coalition would be able to wield such an entity without damage to a significant portion to Earth's population via loss of functional communication methods. As the Global Occult Coalition serves as a force dedicated to the destruction of anomalies, further progress would be a direct violation of our basic mission statement. Thus, I have called for an end to countermemetic research. _
 _
Our current course of action involves complete destruction of all current functioning instances of the countermeme, as well as destruction of all materials relating to production of the countermeme, as to disable any future replication attempts. Other research pertaining to the countermeme will remain, though, to aid in the development of safer alternatives. I understand that this contradicts High Command orders, but I have been forced to call this discontinuation preemptively for the protection of humanity. _

The following procedure guide has been received and transcribed from the active quarantine site. Steps 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and portions of step 8 have been removed following potential field contamination. The further export of written documents in the quarantined zone has been banned except in the case of reports by the acting General, and personnel are being examined for signs of countermemetic contamination.

> +++ STEP 2: Equipment
> 
> All acting operatives in the quarantine zone are required to wear MK VII standard field dress with the +1Gen anti-countermeme helmet in all situations involving civilian encounters. The anti-countermeme helmet is a full-face, polycarbonate plastic helmet containing special technology to prevent contact and infection with the countermeme. The first beneficial feature of the anti-countermeme helmet is the adaptive visor, equipped with sensors to identify and block out any forms of writing, eliminating any chance of infection through visual means. The anti-countermeme helmet also completely eliminates outside sound, preventing countermemetic infection through audio means. An intercom is present in each helmet to allow communication between operatives. Remember, this helmet will be the difference between life and death, so don't forget to wear it constantly.
> 
> +++ STEP 3: Civilian Procedures
> 
> After basic quarantine setup, personnel, as directed by acting General or Lieutenant General, are to initiate civilian processing operations, situation-code 13 (distributed to subsection leaders as document CIV-PROC-13). It is not uncommon for chaos and rioting to break out in the quarantine area, which is why it is necessary to utilize armed and combat-ready operatives. Civilians may be confused and afraid, and thus liable to cause accidents or infection. Remember to always follow the provisional Coalition safety codes, situation-code 54 (also distributed to subsection leaders as document PR-SAFETY-54) to prevent any danger to yourself as well as others. The anti-countermeme helmet helmets are essential in protecting yourself and the people around you when the countermeme is present, so wear them constantly. Don't forget, your job here is to help the people, so treat them with dignity and respect.

> +++ STEP 8: Entity Elimination
> [DATA REMOVED -CONTAMINANT IDENTIFIED] every civilian showing symptoms are checked in to special "infected zones."

The following memo was sent by the technology sector to High Command.
> ||MEMO||
> 
> During the course of our investigation into outgoing communications from currently-infected towns, we've been successful in locating and tracking what we believe is a full list of all electronic communications sent before the estimated time of infection. The document attached to this one should contain the locations of every instance of the countermeme present outside of the quarantine zone. It's a big list though, so be prepared that this operation is going to get much bigger.
> 
> We have found one abnormality in the data, however. Within the starting point of the countermeme, namely towns █████████, ████████ and █████████, there were no external communications dating back to the predicted start of the countermemetic infection. It appears that prior to Coalition interference, another force already eliminated all methods of external communication in these locations, effectively isolating them in the same way we have. This would seem to convey that the current situation with the countermeme is not just a spontaneous occurrence, but rather a planned test from an unknown entity or group thereof. Further research into possible interference will be difficult due to the total devastation of all three of the origin towns in question. We are awaiting commands on how to proceed with this information.

The third phase of Operations Plains Talk was implemented as a final measure in eliminating KTE-6024. Because of its uncontainable nature, the goal of the operation once again changed to that of complete liquidation.

> ||2||+2Gen-TMW||Temporary Trailing Memetic Cognitohazard Weapon||1||

The memetic weapon has been confirmed to duplicate a maximum of 8 times for each instance of the countermeme followed, and died out afterwards. Research into affected civilians outside of the west German quarantine zone has shown that this covers the extent of the spread of the countermeme. Due to the indistinguishing and fatal nature of the memetic cognitohazard weapon, there was a large rate of uninfected civilian death.||
The Council of 108 faced severe disagreement regarding these strict measures. The final compromise was the previously-shown execution of phase 3 of Operation Plains Talk. A cover story about a fictitious virulent disease has been implemented for those eliminated by the memetic weapon.

This is the last message you'll get from me. I'm far away now, and I won't be found. See, you’re all creating a disaster, and I'm not falling with you. You don't understand what you're dealing with. This entity is completely uncontrollable, and that's why we had to destroy it. You're not playing with fire, you're playing with an atomic bomb, and it's primed to go off. I don't want to be caught in the blast with you. That's why I'm leaving now, because when this shitstorm kicks into gear I don't want to be anywhere near the Coalition.  _
 _
I know our countermeme test subjects weren't killed. I know High Command has them. I’ve heard you've even begun testing the countermeme out in Germany. You need to understand that this course of action is completely irrational. We hadn't implemented any safeguards or preventative measures on the countermeme, and I honestly don't know if we even could have. With this countermeme, literally one word to the wrong person can start a chain of events that will destroy civilization as we know it. Is that what the Coalition stands for?  _
 _
The countermeme is beyond anyone’s control. It's not a tool, it's a destructive force. Sure, it could destroy a hostile meme, but it will also destroy every person who gets into even the slightest contact with it. It destroys their communication at its core. And we can't get rid of it unless we destroy them. How many people would have to die then? How many people will have to die? _
 _
No one can save any of us now. The countermeme is out, and nothing can stop it. It's more than a weapon. It's more than a force. It's void. Pure nothing in words. An ever-expanding network of silence across the globe. It'll be everywhere. It might already be everywhere. _
 _
Can you imagine the chaos in the streets? I can see it now. Millions of people learning they can no longer speak. Can no longer be spoken to. It's the collapse of civilization. What happens when it gets into the Coalition database? What happens when we can't track our own monsters? Nobody's safe. I'm not safe. And all of you, watching this catastrophe unfold from afar, not even you are safe. _
 _
One day you, too, will wake up and find that you can no longer read. That words make no sense to you anymore. That nothing anybody says to you will ever make sense again. That the rest of your life will be only understood by yourself, because you cannot read, you cannot hear, and you cannot speak. _
 _
I fear for the future. _
 _
For the last time, perhaps, ever. _
