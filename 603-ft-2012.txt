**ID:** SCP-603-70
**Aliases:** Tamagotchi
**Compiled on:** 09-Mar-20██
**Recorded by:** Dr. Brown
**Description:** An image of a face is rendered to the window using three circles and one line. Three symbols are rendered at the bottom right of the window. An adjective is displayed above the face which changes periodically to reflect the current mood of Dr. Giles. The appearance of the face does not change.

The connection with Dr. Giles was discovered when he reported to Site 6 medical center with complaints of narcolepsy, motion sickness and fatigue. Further testing performed by Dr. Brown and Dr. Giles confirmed the connection.

Surveillance indicates that Dr. Giles was the closest person to the SCP-603 computer system when SCP-603-70 was first run.

The user may use the mouse to click on the symbols at the bottom right of the window. The symbols exhibit different biological effects on Dr. Giles depending on the current adjective. Though the symbols often have varying results, some adjective-symbol combinations have been proven to always exhibit same effect. These have been documented below:

**Adjective:** Hungry
**Button 1:** Dr. Giles will experience a strong desire to seek out food.
**Button 2:** Will eliminate feelings of hunger in Dr. Giles for up to one hour.
**Button 3:** Dr. Giles will vomit immediately

**Adjective:** Tired
**Button 1:** Dr. Giles will retire to the staff room for one hour.
**Button 2:** Dr. Giles will fall asleep immediately.
**Button 3:** Dr. Giles will vomit immediately

**Button 2:** Dr. Giles will organize a company outing.
**Button 3:** Dr. Giles will fall into an intense state of euphoria lasting for 10-20 minutes.
