**Item #:** SCP-1061

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1061 should be kept in a storage room of at least 6m X 4m. The door should be locked at all times unless testing is in progress. Access to SCP-1061 is only allowed to Level 4 personnel to prevent accidental deaths. SCP-1061 does not require any maintenance at any time.

**Description:** SCP-1061 is a dark red 1992 Pontiac Grand Am with severe damage to its entirety, including a completely broken windshield, when viewed from outside. When an individual examines the car’s interior, it appears completely intact. SCP-1061 is registered to ██████ ████. When all doors are closed, they will lock, and all windows display a small neighborhood. The person in the drivers seat is then possessed, acting as if driving the car, and will respond only to the name ██████.

The "journey" will take approximately 30 minutes, ending in a head on collision with another car, though from outside, no movement or change will be witnessed. The driver of SCP-1061 inevitably dies, and is lost. See [[[Document 1061-I]]]

Only Class-D personnel are to be used in the driving of SCP-1061, with a Level 4 personnel, preferably Dr. ████.

**Discovery:** The ██████ County authorities investigated a fatal car accident. Upon examination of the car, the interior's illusion was discovered and the authorities requested federal intervention. Agent █████ intercepted the request and obtained SCP-1061.

SCP-1061 was involved in a head-on collision with another vehicle. The driver was ██████ ████, a 22-year old female. She was ejected from the car at the moment of impact. Her background shows no signs of paranormal incidents or interactions.

**Addendum 1061-01:** Current theory: Subjects' brainwaves are overwritten with that of the deceased. All events, thoughts, and actions that took place before the accident are reenacted by the subject. Further human testing involving the monitoring of both the subjects' bodily functions and brainwaves requested. ~Dr. ████
