**Item #:** SCP-1061

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1061 should be kept in a storage room of at least 6mx4mX3m. Its doors should be locked at all times, and its windshield boarded up, unless testing is in progress.

Access to SCP-1061 is restricted to Level 4 personnel, and to D-class personnel engaged in authorized testing.

Aside from authorized testing, it is forbidden to make any contact with the driver's seat; personnel who make contact with the driver's seat are considered lost, and are to be apprehended. Removal of post-test biological debris is to be performed by robots. 

**Description:** SCP-1061 is a dark red 1992 Pontiac Grand Am with severe collision damage, including a large hole in its front windshield. As a result of the collision, it manifests three distinct anomalous properties; these properties are considered to be linked, in that they seem to be caused by the same anomalous entity.

The first anomalous property is that the collision damage is only visible from the outside; when viewed from inside, the car’s interior appears completely intact. This is purely a visual illusion, and can be detected by cameras and other mechanical means. When viewed from the inside, the windows show a suburban neighborhood outside the city of [REDACTED], on ██/██/1996 -- the day that the car was in its collision. 

The second anomalous property manifests when a live human enters SCP-1061 and sits in any of its passenger seats; at this point, all four doors will close and lock, and the windows as seen from the inside will show a suburban neighborhood outside the city of [REDACTED], on ██/██/1996 -- the day that the car was in its collision. The front windshield will likewise show the suburban neighborhood; however, the hole in the front windshield made by the impact of the original driver's head shows neither the suburban neighborhood nor the containment chamber. Instead, it shows [DATA EXPUNGED]; this is speculated to be linked to the fact that the creation of the hole involved a human death.

The third anomalous phenomenon occurs when a living human sits in the driver's seat. At this point, the driver's mind is erased, and replaced with a consciousness identifying itself as [REDACTED] -- the original owner of the car.


The "journey" will take approximately 30 minutes, ending in a head on collision with another car, though from outside, no movement or change will be witnessed. The driver of SCP-1061 inevitably dies, and is lost. See [[[Document 1061-I]]]

Only Class-D personnel are to be used in the driving of SCP-1061, with a Level 4 personnel, preferably Dr. ████.

**Discovery:** The ██████ County authorities investigated a fatal car accident. Upon examination of the car, the interior's illusion was discovered and the authorities requested federal intervention. Agent █████ intercepted the request and obtained SCP-1061.

SCP-1061 was involved in a head-on collision with another vehicle. The driver was ██████ ████, a 22-year old female. She was ejected from the car at the moment of impact. Her background shows no signs of paranormal incidents or interactions.

**Addendum 1061-01:** Current theory: Subjects' brainwaves are overwritten with that of the deceased. All events, thoughts, and actions that took place before the accident are reenacted by the subject. Further human testing involving the monitoring of both the subjects' bodily functions and brainwaves requested. ~Dr. ████
