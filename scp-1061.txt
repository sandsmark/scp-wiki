**Item #:** SCP-1061

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1061 should be kept in a storage room of at least 6m X 4m. The door should be locked at all times unless testing is in progress. Access to SCP-1061 is only allowed to Level 4 personnel to prevent --accidental-- deaths. SCP-1061 does not require any maintenance at any time.

**Description:** SCP-1061 is a dark red 1992 Pontiac Grand Am with severe damage to its entirety, including a completely broken windshield, when viewed from outside. When an individual examines the car’s interior, it appears completely intact. SCP-1061 is registered to ██████ ████. When all doors are closed, they will lock, and all windows display a small neighborhood. The person in the drivers seat is then possessed, acting as if driving the car, and will respond only to the name ██████.

The "journey" will take approximately 30 minutes, ending in a head on collision with another car, though from outside, no movement or change will be witnessed. The driver of SCP-1061 inevitably dies, and is lost. See [[[Document 1061-I]]]

Only Class-D personnel are to be used in the driving of SCP-1061, with a Level 4 personnel, preferably Dr. ████.

**Discovery:** The ██████ County authorities investigated a fatal car accident. Upon examination of the car, the interior's illusion was discovered and the authorities requested federal intervention. Agent █████ intercepted the request and obtained SCP-1061.
