**Item #:** SCP-3648

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment of SCP-3648 is predicated upon research into and development of early detection methods for SCP-3648 events. All Foundation military force is to be considered available and expendable in the cause of terminating any individual found to be instigating an SCP-3648 event.

**Description:** SCP-3648 is a theoeschatological/cosmogenic phenomenon that has the potential to cause CK-class Reality Restructuring Scenarios. The cause(s) of SCP-3648 and the condition(s) which may increase or decrease its likelihood of occurring are not fully understood. However, according to Foundation DEEPWELL exo-reality data storage archives [[[SCP-2000| and other K-class contingencies,]]] it is known to have occurred ██ times prior to the present iteration of reality. Due to their anomalous nature, further SCP-3648 events may have occurred yet not been detected.

Based upon said exo-reality detection methods, SCP-3648 is believed to occur in several stages:

* Each SCP-3648 event is precipitated by a single sapient (human or otherwise) individual native to the planet Earth.[[footnote]]Effects of SCP-3648 events elsewhere in the universe are not known. Research is ongoing.[[/footnote]] It is not known whether the involved individual is selected by an intelligent being or beings, a product of circumstance, or by random chance. Suspected factors in the provenance of such individuals include:
 * Having been born and/or raised near the coastline of a saltwater ocean or one or more very large freshwater lakes.
 * Uralic or Tungusic ancestry, especially among humans.
 * Great artistic talent, especially of a musical nature, or a personal history of such achievement, typically unrecognized.
 * [[[SCP-1237|Certain genetic predispositions to anomalous behavior.]]]
 * An abusive or otherwise antagonistic figure in the person's life.
* The specific factor(s) that induce an SCP-3648 event are not known, but the beginning of a new SCP-3648 event does include at least one overt anomalous occurrence by which it may be detected.
 * All land surfaces on the Earth will anomalously and instantaneously become immersed in water of variable depth. This immersion does not appear to cause consequences expected from such an event: objects are not damaged by the presence of this water; biological activities of plants, animals, and persons are not notably affected; and water of this type does not appear to drain from locations where it would be expected to drain (hills, upper floors of buildings, etc.). Additionally, this water appears to exhibit an antimemetic effect upon intelligent life: its presence is not noted as unusual except by highly mnestisized persons or instrumentation resistant to reality shifts.
* The individual instigating the event will inevitably disappear in one of a variety of anomalous ways. Most such ways involve the individual bidding farewell to their family, personal friends, and/or community and departing their home, though without making ordinary travel preparations. In all known cases, the individual departs over water, taking little with them beyond their clothing and at least one method of producing fire.[[footnote]]It is not known how such information could have become available to prior iterations of the SCP Foundation yet not have proven sufficient warning to contain the ensuing reality shift. Research is ongoing.[[/footnote]]
* Little information about the progression of an SCP-3648 event beyond this point is available in the DEEPWELL files, with the exception of fragmentary Hume readouts and reality disruption reports, and the exploration log filed in Addendum 3648-1.

**Addendum 3648-1:** Recovered Footage From Iteration █████

[[collapsible show="+ Access Log" hide="- Hide Log"]]

> **Foreword:** One of the least corrupt DEEPWELL intelligence files recovered from prior SCP-3648 events available is a video log in which the individual instigating the SCP-3648 event was somehow recruited as a D-Class test subject prior to the beginning of a SCP-3648 event. They were assigned to detail and report their experience, using standard exploration recording and communication equipment, which they were carrying prior to the onset of the SCP-3648 event as a precaution. Due to data corruption, audio is primarily static and consistent time references are not possible.

> 
> //Several hours of intermittent point of view footage depict the SCP-3648 instigating individual in a D-Class uniform, performing activities typical of D-Class personnel in what is apparently a Foundation facility, though data corruption prevents positive identification of this facility. At one point, the individual examines a Foundation issue watch with the designation "D-3648/1." It is presumed that this is their official classification.//
> 
> //Eventually, D-3648/1 leaves their quarters (without first obtaining the approval of security personnel, as is procedure), and proceeds through the facility, asking after and exchanging farewells with various personnel and SCP objects. Notably, D-3648/1 also plays the violin before a gathering of personnel in the Site cafeteria. D-3648/1 eventually converses with an individual presumed to be the Site Director, and requests no further supplies for its journey beyond several boxes of matches.//
> 
> //D-3648/1, accompanied by various personnel, leaves the facility. It is located near an unidentified river, with several kayaks resting on the shore adjacent to the facility. D-3648/1 enters one of these kayaks and departs, frequently turning to look back and wave at the other personnel. The last time it does so, the other personnel appear to be standing knee deep in water, without having moved from their original position.//
> 
> //D-3648/1 proceeds down the river for what seems to be several days, based upon repeated day-night transitions evident in the footage. As it does so, the banks of the river gradually recede until they occupy the entire horizon. During this period of time, D-3648/1 makes various reports to its handlers, though virtually all speech is garbled beyond recovery.//
> 
> //At least one day after its final report, D-3648/1 begins lighting the matches and dropping them into the water at semi-regular intervals. Rather than being extinguished, the flames appear fed by the water and continue to burn. D-3648/1 does not look directly behind itself, but it looks around enough to suggest that the fires are moving in the direction opposite D-3648/1's.//
> 
> //After it has not attempted a report for at least a week, D-3648/1 sights a commercial speedboat approaching them. It ceases paddling, and produces its violin, which it had seemingly left behind.//
> 
> //An indeterminate amount of time later, the speedboat and its occupant, an elderly human man, reach D-3648/1. Though the resulting conversation is unintelligible, D-3648/1 and the other human appear confrontational and nearly violent. Eventually D-3648/1's violin is seized and cast into the water by the unknown individual, and the two depart from each other.//
> 
> //D-3648/1 spends several more days kayaking, finally landing upon an outcropping of barren rock. It then begins to gather stones from the "seafloor" and rearrange them into piles and stacks.//
> 
> //The time scale of the footage begins to dramatically accelerate. D-3648/1 begins to show evidence of years of aging, despite the persistence of its equipment. The erosion processes of wind and water begin to shape and fuse the stones into shapes representing various plants, animals, and inanimate objects. The final recognizable images before D-3648/1 discards its recording equipment and the footage degrades entirely are stone renderings of the Site it inhabited, various personnel from that Site, its violin, and an etched spherical stone resembling the continents of Earth.//
