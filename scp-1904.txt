**Item #:** SCP-1904

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-1904 is currently dismantled and housed in Storage Unit-07. No further procedures are necessary to contain SCP-1904.--  SCP-1904 is to be monitored at its original location, currently disguised as a government warehouse.  

**Description:** SCP-1904 is a network of plastic tubing for child recreation installed at a ██████████ restaurant in ████████, MD. Structure exhibits no anomalous properties when examined or explored besides a subtle trembling and vocalizations likened to "whimpering." On an irregular basis, vocalization may escalate into intense moans, shrieks and occasional "gagging" or "choking" sounds lasting up to several hours at a time, usually marking the start of a new gestation cycle. Gestation lasts anywhere from eight days to eleven months, during which trace amounts of blood, amniotic fluids and uterine tissues may leak with increasing frequency from the structure's lowest entryway. No particular origin point or DNA match for these fluids has been found. A typical gestation cycle culminates in a single violent expulsion of fluids, tissues and one or more instances of SCP-1904-1.

SCP-1904-1 resemble human embryos at varying stages of development, with higher stages consistently exhibiting severe congenital deformities. Regardless of condition, survival rate is nearly 100% until termination. Instances increase steadily in size and mobility with minimal nutrient intake but do not progress further along embryonic development or otherwise appear to age, with the largest monitored specimen exceeding ████ kgs. Cognitive development is extremely sluggish, though instances equipped to do so have been observed imitating staff vocalizations and in some cases attempting reproductive behavior. Under no circumstances are instances to be reunited with SCP-1904-1 [see document 1904-A]

SCP-1904 exhibits a spike in vocalization coinciding with the termination of any SCP-1904-1 instances, described as "screaming" followed by prolonged periods of "weeping."

**Addendum-1904**
Following extensive testing, SCP-1904 was originally dismantled, exhibited no anomalous properties in storage and was classified as safe. Over the following months an exponential increase in birth defects became apparent within a rapidly expanding radius of the original site. Samples were found to match the properties of SCP-1904-1 and SCP-1904 was restored to its original location and configuration, whereupon the wave of abnormal births subsided. ███ confirmed and ███ potential instances of SCP-1904-1 were subsequently confiscated, dissected and terminated while class-B amnesiacs were administered to much of the surrounding populace. Affected couples were sterilized following evidence of long-term contamination and compensated for what they now believe to have been a class action lawsuit against a fabricated overseas pharmaceutical company.

**Discovery**: On November 06, ████, an ████████ paper reported a string of "monster" sightings corroborated by multiple eyewitnesses over a three day period.  Foundation operatives eventually tracked activity back to a ██████████ allegedly closed for remodeling since the previous year.  ██ instances of SCP-1904-1 were subsequently discovered in the establishment's walk-in freezer and ███ live specimens recovered from local sewage tunnels.
