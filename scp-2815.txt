title:SCP-2815
**Item #:** SCP-2815

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**
SCP-2815 is to be monitored on a 24-hour basis by members of MTF Epsilon-6 “Village Idiots”[[footnote]]Mobile Task Force Epsilon-6 specializes in the investigation, containment, and subsequent cleanup of anomalies in rural and suburban environments.[[/footnote]]. Task force agents are to periodically make visits to the village variously disguised as government and county officials, law enforcement officers, tourists, researchers, construction workers and out-of-town service personnel. Agent Balogh is to infiltrate SCP-2815 via initiating a romantic relationship with an instance of SCP-2815-1 (designated SCP-2815-1-A), with the aim of marrying into the family, producing offspring and (unless posing significant danger to containment) be officially inducted into the community. Agent Balogh is then to record and/or document any anomalous or otherwise suspicious activity via any means possible and transfer the data to Foundation researchers for analysis and study. Agents Hegedüs, Kolompár and Lakatos are to make contact and attain a working level of trust with the local Roma community, whereupon they will be co-opted into surveillance operations.

__REVISION (24/06/2016):__ As SCP-2815 has proven to be largely self-containing, focus will shift to monitoring any activity by and limiting the influence of GOI-0385[[footnote]]Active primarily throughout Europe, the **Esoteric Order of the White Worm** (Hungarian: //Fehér Féreg Ezoterikus Rend//) is a Sarkic cult disguised as an occult themed fraternal organization. Similar to other "secret societies", the existence of the cult is an open secret while its true nature is unknown to the general population.[[/footnote]] within the village of ███ and Heves county as a whole. This task is delegated to MTF Psi-13 "Witch Hunters"[[footnote]]Mobile Task Force Psi-13 is a highly classified joint Foundation/GOC task force designed for the infiltration of Sarkic organizations and the termination of high threat members. Operatives are trained in Counter Occult Stratagems (COS) and the use of corrosive/incendiary armaments.[[/footnote]], due to their infiltrators already being established within GOI-0385 for surveillance. The new primary goal is to prevent the radicalization of SCP-2815 by GOI-0385. Data sharing between relevant Epsilon-6 and Psi-13 detachments to facilitate containment has been approved and mandated by the O5 Council.

__REVISION (13/12/2016):__ Following data gained from Expedition Ψ13-2815-1612-1, MTF Epsilon-6 is to observe all harvests made by SCP-2815 and track all shipments of produce and medical supplies originating from ███. Requisitions for specimens for research purposes can be made with either Head Researcher Dr. Hidegkúti Lajos or ranking Sitra Achra personnel. Acquisition of specimens is to be made by Epsilon-6 plainclothes operatives under the guise of ordinary customers. Additional funds, materials and manpower is to be made available to the local Epsilon-6 detachment in order to achieve these goals.

**Description:** SCP-2815 designates an anomalous, endogamous community comprising the majority of the inhabitants of the village of ███, Heves county, Hungary. Of the village's 367 inhabitants (95% Hungarian, 5% Roma), about 80% are genetically related, belonging to one large extended family sharing the surname '████' or '████'. Only the local Roma community and a few other Hungarian households lack genetic relations to the ████ family. Identity within SCP-2815 is strongly linked to the idea of shared ancestry. Kinship ties are reinforced by having members of SCP-2815 interbreed with distant relatives in order to maintain a more closely related community, in accordance with their beliefs. Heavy restrictions are placed on exogamous unions, with only one such union allowed every fifth generation for any given bloodline. Community members (henceforth referred to as SCP-2815-1) possess an ability to intuitively and accurately determine the degree of inbreeding among one another, which is used to define social position according to perceived genetic purity.

Very few instances of SCP-2815-1 (fewer than 3%) have been shown to possess non-debilitating physical deformities. These individuals do, however, seem to play prominent roles in the spiritual life of SCP-2815. Though outwardly portraying themselves as moderately devout Roman Catholics, investigations have revealed the community to be practising a religion derived from Hungarian paganism displaying a high degree of syncretism with a heterodox variety of Sarkicism[[footnote]]Sarkicism (derived from the Greek σάρξ, or “flesh”) is a religious/philosophical system that encompasses a variety of traditions, beliefs, and spiritual practices largely based on teachings attributed to “Grand Karcist Ion”, its deified founder. Adherents practice ritual cannibalism, human sacrifice, corporeal augmentation, thaumaturgy, dimensional manipulation, and the formation of pacts with otherworldly entities. Organic manipulation has allowed certain Sarkites to achieve anomalous states of being, transcending the physical limitations of baseline humans.[[/footnote]]. The few members displaying physical deformities (commonly polydactyly, severe hyperdontia, caudal appendage, heterochromia, albinism) are given the status of //táltos//[[footnote]]The name for a cleric in Hungarian paganism and neopaganism, similar to a shaman.[[/footnote]] (henceforth referred to as SCP-2815-2), a role for which they begin training as early as the age of five or six, in accordance with Hungarian pagan tradition. 

Belief in the efficacy of magical rituals is widespread and reinforced by SCP-2815-2 instances' ritual display of anomalous abilities, which play a central role in many rituals. These abilities are widely believed by SCP-2815 to be directly tied to their physical deformities and have been shown to include remote viewing, retrocognition, limited precognition, fleshcrafting, anomalous healing, sensory and emotional projection, conversion of bodily fluids to gaseous or solid states as well as remote control of horses. The main application of these abilities seem to be as a form of alternative medicine. Religious practices include a mixture of Hungarian pagan and common Sarkic rites and rituals, and while it has never been observed, there have been mentions of slow slicing[[footnote]]A form of torture and execution used in China and Vietnam from ca 900 AD until 1905, wherein a knife was used to methodically remove portions of the body over an extended period of time, eventually resulting in death. Referred to within SCP-2815 as "A Nyúzó Szertartás", referenced in English as "The Flaying Rite" or sometimes "The Rite of Nyúz". This is believed to be a historical relic, practised only in a figurative rather than a literal sense, entailing the ritualized peeling of a piece of fruit by an instance SCP-2815-2[[/footnote]].

*[[footnote]]This subsection contains data pertaining to the culture of SCP-2815. It has been moved to its own subsection as it is considered non-essential for containment. However, is has been left in the article as it constitutes valuable research material, and may provide useful insights into SCP-2815's background and motivations.[[/footnote]][[collapsible show="+ Display contextual information" hide="- Hide contextual information"]]

SCP-2815 instances display a surprisingly low rate of physical deformities and other birth defects otherwise associated with inbreeding, despite the fact that most families have been continuously endogamous for over a century. In fact, the population is shown to be uncommonly healthy, a fact that has attracted the attention of the scientific community. Several studies have been published on the subject by geneticists, most of which were performed by the prolific Hungarian anthropologist Nemeskéri János[[footnote]]Hungarian names are written in Eastern name order, meaning the surname precedes the given name. This article uses Eastern name order for such names.[[/footnote]]. The cause behind this incoherence is believed to be anomalous in nature.

Cosmologically, SCP-2815 believe the world to be divided into three realms: the Upper Realm being the abode of //Isten// and good spirits, believed responsible for rain, sunlight, luck and other positive attributes; the Nether Realm, residence of //Ördög//, a malignant deity who issues challenges to humans in the form of pests, diseases, war and disasters as a form of winnowing; the Middle world, where humans reside. These two deities created the world in unison. Theological focus centres around subverting the suffering caused by //Ördög// for the benefit of human beings, turning the Middle Realm into a paradise. Sermons reference a "Grand Karcist Ion", considered their prophet, whom SCP-2815 aim to reincarnate through selective breeding, believing that he will ultimately usher in an era of health and harmony through teaching humanity how to "embrace the healing sicknesses".[[footnote]]Thus far, agents have encountered no mentions of //Yaldabaoth// or //Važjuma//, the primary Sarkic deity, in SCP-2815.[[/footnote]]

Rituals and sermons are held in an as of yet undeciphered language. This language has been identified by Foundation linguists as ostensibly Uralic with prominent Finnic features, a Hungarian substrate and elements from an unknown language that our linguists have given the provisional name “glossacháos”. The name of this faith among its adherents has been recorded as //az Éh// or sometimes //Nyelke//.[[footnote]]//Az Éh// literally translates to "The Hunger". //Nyelke// appears to be a Hungarian rendition of the Sarkic endonym //Nälkä//, both of which derive from the Proto-Uralic root '*ńäle-'.[[/footnote]] Foundation linguists have therefore dubbed the language //Eehish//. This language has been identified to be nearly identical to that spoken within the Hungarian-based Esoteric Order of the White Worm (GOI-0385). This would link SCP-2815 to both GOI-0385 as well as the numerous isolated proto-Sarkic communities in the Carpathian Mountains, suggesting a common origin among the Solomonari cults[[footnote]]A Sarkic cult historically active in the Kingdom of Hungary during the Medieval and Renaissance periods. It was presumed destroyed during the 15th century by the Hungarian commander John Hunyadi (Hunyadi János). Historical evidence suggest that some Solomonari served as "court magicians", advising their lords and ladies on matters of alchemy, medicine, astrology, and the occult. Several boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia, most notably the Gutkeled clan of Hungarian nobles, are now believed to have been under the control of the Solomonari; an influence that would lead to the development of Neo-Sarkicism and it's western expansion.[[/footnote]] of medieval Hungary.

Of particular note is the rite of passage into adulthood, which is performed at 23 for female and 26 for male individuals, while intersex individuals, on account of being considered SCP-2815-2 instances, receive theirs after the first sign of puberty. It centres around the consumption (read: swallowing) or implantation of an external organ or biological organism referred to by adherents as 'aklóca' and by clergy as 'akolossz'.[[footnote]]Both believed to be Hungarian and Eehish corruptions of Sarkic 'akuloth' respectively.[[/footnote]] These has been identified by Foundation experts as instances of SK-BIO Type Z.[[footnote]]Known to Sarkites as an "Akuloth" and "His Sacred White Worm", instances of SK-BIO Type Z are symbiotic organisms found in the bodies of both Sarkites and Sarkic organisms. It is believed that they act as a secondary immune system, protecting the host against disease as well as greatly increasing their regenerative abilities. SK-BIO Type Z is also believed to be connected to the physical transformations some Sarkites undergo.[[/footnote]] It is presumed that this organ is what allows SCP-2815-1 instances to sense and determine the “purity” of one another.

[[collapsible show="+ INFORMATION RESTRICTED TO LEVEL 3 PERSONNEL AND ABOVE" hide="- LEVEL 3 CLEARANCE VERIFIED. ACCESS GRANTED"]]

A notable difference lies in the initiation ritual for SCP-2815-2 instances, for which the SK-BIO Type Z is grown inside a horse. The horse is then ritually slaughtered, removing most internal organs including the notably deviant Type Z specimen, which are then consumed by SCP-2815-2. Afterwards, the horse's wounds are sewn shut. Finally, SCP-2815-2 places one hand on it and maintains that position for approximately 10 minutes, after which the horse reanimates. This horse will then follow SCP-2815-2 around for the rest of the latter's life, claimed by SCP-2815 to aid it in its rituals.[[footnote]]This is analogous to the '//táltos ló//', or //táltos// horse, of Hungarian Paganism, which are regarded as spiritual partners of Hungarian pagan shamans.[[/footnote]] These horses are designated SCP-2815-3 and appear to work as extensions of their specific instances of SCP-2815-2.

SCP-2815-3 instances have been observed to consume organic matter, specifically animal tissue, which they later regurgitate as a viscous organic substance (designated SCP-2815-4) similar in form and composition to that recorded in SCP-2217 (Incident 2217-14). SCP-2815-4 has been observed being used by SCP-2815-2 to treat injuries and repair damage to buildings and other inanimate objects. This is accomplished by SCP-2815-2 transmuting it into the desired material. As explained by one instance of SCP-2815-2, a limitation of SCP-2815-4 is that any given instance can only be transmuted into one substance.

Agent Balogh was discreetly able to obtain a small sample of SCP-2815-4. Sample was subsequently delivered to Site-66 for further analysis. The tests performed at Site-66 returned results showing the tissue to be saturated with N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (N,N-DMT),[[footnote]]A powerful psychedelic compound historically consumed by indigenous Amazonian Indian cultures for divinatory and healing purposes.[[/footnote]] presumed to be a product of the local divergent SK-BIO Type Z grown inside SCP-2815-3. It is assumed that the N,N-DMT serves a similar purpose as it has in SCP-2480: revealing anomalously hidden features that are invisible to the naked eye or mundane recording equipment. Samples taken from SCP-2815-1-A (saliva, hair, nails, skin, blood) have not yielded any traces of N,N-DMT, confirming that this is a property unique to SCP-2815-2.

**Addendum-1:** On 13/05/2015, Agent Balogh recorded the following part of a sermon preceding a cannibalistic funeral rite:

> “Tehát vegyük magunkba szeretett társunkat,
> Együk húsát, igyuk vérét,
> Hogy velünk maradhasson időnk végéig.
> Ezt tanította nekünk Jan nagykarcista[[footnote]]Hungarian rendition of "Grand Karcist Ion".[[/footnote]],
> Kit megviselt egy elviselhetetlen erő,
> Ki látta a számtalan holt világot,
> És maga a halált meggyilkolta,
> Ki megolvasta teremtőnk beleit,
> És az örökkévalóságot kitárva megpillantotta.
> Tudjuk, hogy közeledik mennyországunk,
> Amit csakis saját húsunkból megszülhetjük.”
[[footnote]]"Thus let us take into ourselves our beloved companion
Let us eat their flesh, Let us drink their blood,
That they may stay with us till the end of our time.
This did the Grand Karcist Ion teach us,
Who was subjected to an intolerable force,
Who has seen the innumerable dead worlds,
And who murdered death itself,
Who has read the entrails of our creator,
And glimpsed the eternity spread wide.
We know that our paradise draws ever closer,
And that only from our flesh can it be birthed." [[/footnote]] 

The sermon was followed by the consumption of the deceased instance, designated SCP-2815-1B. Agent Balogh was politely denied from participating on account of him lacking an SK-BIO Type Z, though he was allowed to remain and observe. Following the conclusion of the ceremony, Balogh reported noticing gradual behavioural changes in his partner, Ivády ███████ (SCP-2815-1A), which intensified over the course of the following three days. The changes, though minor, were noticeably similar to those of SCP-2815-1B, the deceased instance which it had consumed. SCP-2815-1A has since been reported recounting memories specific to SCP-2815-1B. The exact number and extent of these memories is unknown, but presumed to be limited.

According to SCP-2815-1A (as relayed by Agent Balogh), the purpose of the inbreeding practice is to "distill" the gene pool by weeding out non-Sarkic ("non-ancestral") material and increasing its "ancestral purity". Incestuous procreation and funerary endocannibalism are both believed to contribute to this. SCP-2815 believes the end result to be an individual pure enough that it would constitute an Earthly reincarnation of their prophet, Grand Karcist Ion, who would then unite all of humanity and usher in a Golden Age. Were it to succeed, it would at best cause an SK-Class Dominance Shift scenario (following the ████ narrative), and at worst a XK-Class End-of-the-World scenario (following mainstream Sarkic narratives). Due to the deviant nature of SCP-2815 and its beliefs from other Sarkic groups, the likelihood of such an event remains in doubt and is considered implausible.

**Possible Involvement of GOI-0385**

On 16/05/2016, Agent Kolompár relayed information concerning an unfamiliar veteran car having entered ███, sighted by one of the Roma inhabitants. The car was reported present in the village by all four agents posted there over the course of the following week. Agent Balogh reported having seen the proprietor of the vehicle, identifying him as Pelbárthidi Ödön (assigned the designation POI-563), a mid-ranking member of the Esoteric Order of the White Worm (GOI-0385). Agent Balogh never interacted directly with POI-563 and was unable to certainly determine its purpose. Though it can be assumed that POI-563's and its GOI's interest in the village is directly related to SCP-2815 and in particular instances of SCP-2815-2. It is feared that any active involvement of GOI-0385 with SCP-2815 may alter SCP-2815 breeding programme sufficiently enough to result in an XK-Class End-the-World-Scenario. Containment protocols have been updated following this report to account for the involvement of GOI-0385.

As of 24/10/2016, POI-563 has revisited SCP-2815 exactly 19 times. In a few of these instances, he was seen accompanied by what is presumed to be additional members of GOI-0385. Agent Balogh, who has now reportedly met POI-563 several times, has detailed its efforts to recruit SCP-2815 into GOI-0385 or request for a live specimen of SCP-2815-2. Leading members of SCP-2815 have continuously refused these requests and have at best shown disinterest in GOI-0385. Due to SCP-2815's seemingly isolationist attitude towards other Sarkic cults, it has been deemed a Low Level Threat by SCP-2815 Head Researcher Dr. Hidegkúti Lajos. This reclassification is currently under review by Sitra Achra personnel.

**SCP-XXXX-5**
[[include component:image-block name=Tree%20of%20Life%20-%20Iv%C3%A1dy%20Manor%20-%20by%20Rak%C3%A1s%2C%20from%20Wikicommons.jpg|caption=Ivády Manor during daytime.|width=300px]]
Following a ceremony on 3/11/2016, Agent Balogh noticed an instance of SCP-2815-2 enter a tree in the gardens of Ivády Manor. The instance was reported as "disappearing behind a fold in the trunk", though subsequent investigations have revealed no such features. None of the SCP-2815-1 present at the ceremony reported being able to perceive the aperture through which SCP-2815-2 had entered. According to local legend, only the //táltos// can ascend the "Sky-reaching Tree"[[footnote]]//Égig érő fa//: An element of Hungarian shamanism and native faith, and a typical element of Hungarian folk art and folk tales. It is the Hungarian equivalent of the //World Tree// and/or //Tree of Life//, a cosmological motif common to many disparate belief systems throughout Eurasia.[[/footnote]] (this is consistent with Hungarian mythological narratives), as the locals refer to it. The tree appears to the naked eye as an old specimen of //Juglans regia// (common walnut tree), and although visually inconspicuous, Kafka counters return readings of ca 50 humes in close proximity, leading to speculations that an active extradimensional portal may exist somewhere on the surface of the tree trunk. The tree, along with the presumed portal and extradimensional space, have been given the designation SCP-2815-5.

On the advice of Dr. Narváez, Dr. Hidegkúti has scheduled an expedition into ███, to be carried out by members of MTF-Psi 13 "Witch Hunters" under the influence of N,N-Dimethyltryptamine. The goal will be to ascertain the anomalous nature of SCP-2815-5 and, if possible, gain access to its presumed extradimensional space.

**Audiovisual transcript of Expedition Ψ13-2815-1612-1**

At the request of Dr. Hidegkúti, a manned expedition comprising a squad from MTF Psi-13 "Witch Hunters" utilizing N,N-Dimethyltryptamine was dispatched into ███ on ██████████. All squad members were fitted with omnidirectional microphones and headmounted minicameras. The expedition, commencing at █████ █████, was intended to exploit overcast nighttime conditions to infiltrate the grounds of Ivády Manor and investigate SCP-2815-5. Primary objective was uncovering relevant data as to SCP-2815-5's anomalous attributes, specifically the presence of a presumed extradimensional portal. Secondary objectives, conditional upon the primary, included exploring, mapping and retrieving samples from said extradimensional space, if possible.

Basic commands and non-relevant chatter have been redacted from this transcript to conserve space.

__Personnel list:__
- **Dr. Hidegkúti Lajos:** Head of research for SCP-2815, expedition supervisor.
- **Dr. Calixto Narváez:** Head of research for SCP-████, present for advisory purposes due to experience with similar operations with SCP-2480.
- **Major Miloš Obrenović "Domovoi":** Commander of Epsilon-6 detachment in charge of SCP-XXXX containment, present due to familiarity with ███ and SCP-2815, expedition commander.
- **Sgt. Charles F. Brandon "Stalker":** Psi-13 expedition squad leader. Designation FT-A1.
- Squad members are denoted by shorthand (e.g. FT-B1), where 'FT' stands for 'fire team', 'B' is fire team designation and '1' denotes fire team member.

//Camera feed (Stalker POV) shows expedition in transit towards ███. Approximately 2 km from the village, squad disembarks and proceeds towards destination on foot. Once arrived, they quickly make their way to Ivády Manor. A snap gun is shown being used to unlock the front gate, with squad members cautiously proceeding onto the manor grounds, leaving the gate closed but unlocked behind them. Squad arrives at SCP-2815-5 at █████, local time.//

**Stalker:** This is Stalker. We're in position. Do you read?
**Domovoi:** We read you, Stalker. What's your status?
**Stalker:** All green. It's perfectly quiet here, almost seems abandoned. Encountered no contacts on approach either.
**Dr. Hidegkúti:** Acknowledged. Can you make out any unusual features on the tree?
**Stalker:** Affirmative, Doc. I'm facing it right now. It's a... erm... it looks like a err...

//Cam feed shows the characteristic bark of an aged specimen of// Juglans regia//, though no anomalies appear in the footage. Squad members' movements variably suggest mild unease, confusion, amusement.//

**Dr. Hidegkúti:** We can't confirm a visual, Stalker. Can you describe the anomaly?
**Stalker:** It err...
**FT-Δ3:** It looks like a pussy, Sir.
**Dr. Hidegkúti:** A what?
**Stalker:** Vagina, Doc. It looks like a vagina. Or an erm... vulva, rather.
**Domovoi:** Acknowledged, Stalker. Our agents have confirmed the locals consider walnuts to be a fertility symbol. It's likely related. Can you tell us anything about the anomaly?
**Stalker:** Well, it's err... it doesn't move, it appears dry. Wooden, looks like a burl, very much. About 2,5 metres high and three quarter metres wide. Rest looks like a regular walnut tree.
**Dr. Hidegkúti:** Noted. Try touching it.

//FT-Γ2 produces a stun baton, with which she proceeds prodding the anomaly. The baton appears to hit solid material approximately 30 cm from the surface of the tree trunk. Stalker reports no reaction. FT-Γ2 attempts touching the same spot with one hand, then slowly begins stroking it, giving the appearance of waving at empty air. Initially, no reaction is discernible. After exactly 5 seconds, Stalker reports the anomaly changing, although video footage shows no change.//

**Stalker:** It's moved a bit, widened by about a quarter metre. I can see a hole in the centre now, about half a metre long. There's... it's exuding some sort of resin. Floppy, take a sample.

//FT-B2 approaches anomaly and retrieves a small tube of the resinous substance.//

**FT-B2:** It's funny, Sir. It's viscous alright, like the usual stuff, but this has the consistency of gel. Dissolves real easily and is pretty slippery. Bet I could use this in place of gun lube. Sample retrieved.
**Dr. Hidegkúti:** Good job, Beta Two.
**Dr. Narváez:** Stalker, knowing Sarkic cults, I would assume the resin is meant to facilitate entrance. Try sending somebody through. //10 seconds elapse without any activity.//
**Domovoi:** You heard the Doc, boys and girls. Get moving.
**Stalker:** Yes, Commander. Hey, Stains, in you go.

//FT-Δ2 is shown cautiously approaching the tree. POV shifts to FT-Δ2's camera, which, when approximately 2 cm from the surface of the trunk, shows it splitting vertically and widening into a black hole, enveloping the field of view. Δ2's heavy breathing is clearly audible, along with the sound of coarse fabric sliding against soft tissue. After ca 20 seconds of pushing, FT-Δ2 emerges in an enclosed space reminiscent of the interior or a lighthouse. Surfaces appear to be composed of walnut lumber, though the circular bend of the wood seems to defy the material's fractal toughness. Chamber appears dimly illuminated, though no light source can be identified. Δ2 takes to narrating her passage as a means to reduce anxiety.//

**FT-Δ2:** Erm... It's tight in here. Feeling a light squeeze from both sides, pretty uncomfortable. The walls are moist and squishy, lot softer than I expected from a tree. //*Δ2 emerges into chamber.// Alright, I made it through. Seems safe enough. I'm in some kind of room, circular, goes way up. There's a stairwell here, spiral-shaped, goes both up and down. Not much else. Err... It's all made of wood. Hard, like it's supposed to be, unlike the entrance. Place feels kind of off, too.
**Domovoi:** Affirmative Delta-Two. Fire teams Alpha, Gamma and Delta are to proceed through the opening. Fire team Beta is to remain outside and watch for hostile until either all fire teams have reemerged from the opening or until further orders. Delta-Two, take some measurements and try gathering some samples if you can. All units, do you copy?
**Stalker:** Stalker here, we copy, Commander. Proceeding through the opening.
**FT-B1:** This is Beta Leader. Orders received. Setting up a perimeter now.
**FT-Δ2:** Delta-Two, proceeding as ordered.

//Camera feeds shifts cycles between Stalker, FT-Δ2 and FT-Γ1 until all fire teams have made it through into the chamber. Δ2 is shown taking measuring reality, temperature, atmospheric pressure, width and durability of chamber, as well as sampling air and wood shavings from the walls.//

**FT-B1:** Perimeter secure. Holding position. Awaiting orders.
**FT-Δ2:** Kant counter fluctuates between 54 and 62 humes... Measuring tape comes out at roughly 7,5 m, but the place doesn't look more than three metres wide... Thermometer shows a stable 34 degrees Celsius... Barometer shows around 360 kilopascals... Air sample retrieved and sealed... Gonna try and see how hard these walls are... Hm, just like any normal wood. Kinda disappointed, to be honest. I'm going to shave off a bit of it for you guys to take a look at... There, done. Awaiting further instructions.
**Dr. Hidegkúti:** Great job, Delta-Two. Now wait for the others to come through.

//A further 5 minutes elapse until all fire teams are through.//

**Stalker:** This is Stalker. Alpha, Gamma and Delta teams are through. What are your orders?
**Dr. Hidegkúti:** Excellent, Stalker. Now I would like you to take a team and explore upstairs.
**Domovoi:** This is Domovoi. Alpha and Delta teams are to proceed upstairs and report progress. Gamma team is to hold the ground floor until either the return of Alpha and Delta teams or until further orders.
**Stalker:** Roger, Domovoi. Flopdog, you take point, Delta team follows. Alpha team, you're after me.
**Dr. Hidegkúti:** Mythological narratives suggest possibility of malignant entities residing in the lower levels. Gamma-One, keep a close eye on the descending stairs, we don't want any nasty surprises.
**FT-Γ1:** Understood, Doc. Thanks for the heads up! Assuming position.

//Feed switches to FT-Γ1, showing her team assuming defensive positions around the ground, then switches to FT-Δ3, who takes the lead in ascending the spiral staircase. Ascension continues for a good half hour without discernible progress, the fire teams taking one short break during that time. After 30 minutes, Alpha and Delta teams arrive at a chamber similar to the ground floor one. By this point, the fire teams have ascended beyond the externally visible height of SCP-2815-5. Delta team proceeds to take complementary measurements for contrastive  purposes, noting that readings remain largely the same. Timestamp displays ████.//

**Stalker:** This is Stalker. We've reached the top of the staircase. Room is almost identical to ground floor, only there's a door where the vaginal portal would be, and a ladder going farther up. I'd say, about twenty metres, from where I'm looking. Can't say for sure though, spacetime's all off in here. We'll be taking a break, that walk was surprisingly exhausting.
**Dr.Narváez:** Roger, Stalker. While you're at it, make sure to take your second dose of DMT. The come-down might what's causing those odd sensations.
**Stalker:** Affirmative, Doctor. All units, this is Stalker, time to take your medicine. Doctor's orders.

//The group settles down for a short rest and meal. All squad members administer another 60mg of N,N-DMT. Break lasts for 15 minutes.//

**Stalker:** We're ready, Command. Requesting orders. Tinny, Gusto, status report.
**FT-B1:** Gusto here. No changes to report. Place is dead.
**FT-Γ1:** This is Tinny. We've been hearing some strange sounds from downstairs. Sound pretty far down though, barely audible, and they're pretty infrequent. Stopped about twenty minutes ago. Had Pinwheel set up a claymore though, just in case. Better safe than sorry. Other than that, nothing new.
**Dr. Narváez:** We heard you, Gamma-One. Stay frosty and look out for additional sounds. //Mic muted; to assistant.// Get somebody to analyze Gamma team's audio! Now! High Priority. Keep me updated. //Mic unmuted.//
**Dr. Hidegkúti:** Send somebody to check out that ladder. Measure length as you go.
**Stalker:** Copy, Doc. Flybag, I want you to climb that ladder and see what's up there. Stains, go attach some measuring tape to Flybag's ass, let's see how tall this place is.

//A string of affirmatives follow as preparations are made. FT-Δ2 readies instruments, after which FT-Δ4 begins climbing the ladder. Alpha team and the remainder of Delta team take up defensive positions. Camera feeds switches to Δ4, whose pace seems slower than initial visual would have suggested. Chamber is shown narrowing along with ascent, prompting Δ4 to attach an anchor and safety line on the opposite wall once within arm's reach. Continuing upward, Δ4 reaches the end of the ladder after 20 minutes of additional climbing, though he exhibits no exhaustion. Four small windows are located at the top, one for each cardinal direction, in a narrow space not larger than to accommodate a human head. FT-Δ4 takes time to examine the landscape beyond each window, invariably showing what appears a major city. Colours of edifices are predominantly shades of red and brown. Material confirmed to consist of a mix of mammalian soft tissue, various chitinous substances and osseous materials. All edifices appear animate and can be observed contracting and expanding in slow but regular patterns, consistent with typical breathing motion, suggesting edifices may be alive. Sky is overcast with rust-coloured clouds, the speed of which indicates windy weather. Ground seems covered in a plum-coloured unidentified, presumably organic substance. Several black flags were observed fluttering in the air, emblazoned with a circular golden symbol in the middle.//

**FT-Δ4:** Command, you reading this? This place looks messed up, awfully dreary. I'd say it's clearly Sarkic, tell-tale meaty buildings all over. And those black flags look awfully familiar. What do you say? You recognize any of this?
**Dr. Narváez:** Affirmative, Delta-Four, we read you. Though we can't quite make out any details, I'd say you're right. Though I can't place the settlement. We'll need to investigate further for that. You may return now, Delta-Four. Good job.

//FT-Δ4 begins slow descent back towards top floor. Despite the ascent haven taken nearly 35 minutes at a quicker pace, the descent lasts no more that 12 minutes.//

**Dr. Hidegkúti:** Be advised, Delta-Four, you descent took less than half the time of your ascent. Delta-Two, how long did you read the height?
**FT-Δ2:** Maximum height reached 60 metres, Sir. No fluctuations.
**Domovoi:** Alright, folks, we're definitely dealing with unstable spacetime here, so be careful. Stalker, I want you to take a look at what's behind that door. Take all necessary precautions you can. It's gone well so far, let's try and keep it that way.
**Stalker:** Agreed, Commander. Plushie, time to set that droid of yours to work. Everybody else, take up position around that door and the stairs. Stains, you watch the ladder. Get to it, people! 

//FT-A2 is shown removing a spherical device from his backpack. Camera feed switches to FT-A2 POV. All squad members are seen donning gas masks. A2 approaches door and is seen pressing down a button on device and holding. Following a brief countdown, FT-Δ3 opens to the door 15 degrees, whereupon FT-A2 quickly throws the device out the door, which is promptly shut by by FT-Δ3.//

**FT-Δ4:** All clear. No hostiles detected.
**FT-Δ2:** Air pressure and humidity stable No new particles detected. Aperture presumably a portal, appears non-conducive to gaseous compounds and microbial organisms.
**FT-A2:** Receiving feed. Ψ13-RD1 is active and mobile. Got visual. Rerouting to command, do you read?

//FT-A2 holds a control unit with a screen displaying a camera feed from the spherical device, identified as Psi-13 Reconnaissance Droid 1. Camera feeds switches to Ψ13-RD1, which appears to be moving about outside area. Area surface appears as a mix of various species of moss and grass, although no exposed dirt can be observed. The boughs of a large tree of indeterminate species can be seen hanging overhead.//

**Domovoi:** We read you, Alpha-Two. That's an impressive piece of hardware you got there. Proceed with recon.
**Dr. Hidegkúti:** Receiving atmospheric data. Transmitting to analyst team.

//Droid moves to explore space. Unmanned exploration concluded and space mapped within 45 minutes. Space appears circular with a diameter of approximately 30 metres, not counting potential spacetime fluctuations. Aside from 1 large, significantly aged tree of indeterminate species and numerous species of moss and grass, space appears desolate of any lifeforms. Local atmosphere deemed free of Sarkic microbial pathogens. Camera feet switches to FT-A1 "Stalker" POV. All members are shown removing gas masks. FT-Δ3 opens the door, while FT-A1 orders all Alpha members out into into the "Arboretum", leaving Delta team to guard the upper floor. FT-A2 retrieves and deactivates Ψ13-RD1.//

**Dr. Hidegkúti:** Alpha team, now that you are closer, are you able to identify the tree?
**FT-A3:** Negative, Sir. It looks vaguely like a //Castanea//, but it still doesn't resemble any subspecies I know of. Should've sent the Gardeners, we're no botanists. Can't see any chestnuts on the tree though, but a whole lot of fruit, like, full of 'em. All different species too. I can make out plum, apple, lemon, pomegranate, passionfruit, cherries, bananas... really, every kind of fruit. And that's not right, I can tell you that much... A lot of these branches seem pretty low hanging. We could probably harvest a good amount if you want us to, Doctor.
**Dr. Hidegkúti:** Noted, Alpha-Three. Affirmative on the harvest. Stalker, have your teams gather as much fruit as you can carry. Be sure to take take some samples of the leaves, bark, moss and grass as well. Once your done, return to Beta team.
**Stalker:** Understood, Doc. You heard the man, boys, it's harvest time!
**Dr. Narváez:** Beta-One, see if your team can't sample some leaves and nuts while you're waiting. It'll be good to compare them to the extradimensional samples.
**FT-B1:** Affirmative, Doctor. I'm sending Beta-Four to do that. You hear that, Fancypants? Get that ladder out and get picking. Rest of you, hold position.

//Camera feeds from FT-A1 and FT-B3 show samples being taken from both the extradimensional tree as well as the external surface of SCP-2815-5. Harvest takes a total of 20 minutes. Timestamp displays █████.//

**Stalker:** We're done harvesting, Command. Sacks are full. Requesting orders.
**Dr. Hidegkúti:** Acknowledged, Stalker. Beta team, how is your progress?
**FT-B3:** Sampling complete, Sir. Resumed previous position.
**FT-B1:** We're holding the line, Command. Awaiting orders.
**Domovoi:** Alright, folks, we've got the goods, and time's running out. Alpha team, return to Beta team. Gamma and Delta teams are to follow Alpha team back to Beta team as they pass.

//Alpha team begins retreat. 6 seconds elapse before FT-A3 request they stop.//

**FT-A3:** Wait! Hold on, I think I saw something... Yeah, there's definitely something in here.

//Camera feed switches to FT-A3 POV, shown approaching the tree. A previously unnoticed hole is visible in its side. A3 turns on flashlight and points it at the hole, illuminating a small cavity containing what appears to be an undulating white liquid substance. Camera remains focused on the substance for 3 seconds before A3 promptly reaches inside, earning protests from FT-A1, and pulls out an adolescent specimen of SK-BIO Type Z.//

**FT-A3:** Thought so. Doctors, I got one of those big white worm thingies here. Thinking you might want this.
**Stalker:** Goddammit, Nutjob! How many times have I told ya' to-
**Dr. Narváez:** Excellent, Alpha-Three! I can confirm that's a pristine Type Z specimen. We've been looking to get our hands on a live one for years. Secure and retrieve, Alpha-Three.
**FT-A3:** Yessir! //Feed shows A3 emptying a jar containing fruit, replacing it with the live specimen of SK-BIO Type Z. The jar's lid is perforated to enable ventilation.// Specimen secure, Doc.
**Dr. Hidegkúti:** Good job, Alpha-Three. Are there other any holes in that tree?
**FT-A3:** I... wait, yes! Yes, there are.
**Dr. Hidegkúti:** Very well. Alpha team, switch with Delta and have them examine the holes.
**Stalker:** Roger that. Nutjob, we're gonna have us a long, serious talk when we get back. Now move it!

//Camera feed switches to FT-Δ1, showing Alpha team reentering the room and Delta team exiting into the "Arboretum". Approaching the tree, several holes becomes visible on the trunk, which had previously gone unnoticed. Delta team proceeds to examine the holes.//

**FT-Δ3:** Holy shit! There's a whole bunch of fucking organs in here!
**FT-Δ1:** These are Sarkites all right. This is pretty standard fare for these folks, Amps. Command, you want samples?
**Dr. Hidegkúti:** Affirmative, Delta-One. As much as you can take, from each and every hole.

//FT-Δ1 begins harvesting the organs, the rest of Delta teams can be seen doing the same.//

**FT-Δ1:** Harvesting complete, Command. Awaiting orders.
**FT-Δ3:** Uh, hey Command, I managed to get a sample of erm... I'd wanna call it sap, 'cause its from the tree but... it looks like blood, Sirs. Smells like it too.
**Dr. Hidegkúti:** That's wonderful! Great job, Delta team.
**Domovoi:** Alright then, resume previous directive. Time to wrap this up.

//Feed switches to FT-A1 POV. Delta team is shown retreating back through door, down the stairway and out the portal. Alpha and then Gamma teams are confirmed to be following. All squad members are confirmed present at Beta team's position at █████ hours. Squad begins return to origin point, locking the gate behind them. All members arrive at origin point without incident at █████ hours. Members enter vehicles and return to base. Expedition concluded. Audiovisual feed disabled. 

All materials harvested from the SCP-2815-5 have since been provided the designation SCP-2815-6.//

**Laboratory Report: SCP-2815-6 Test Results**

Fruit from SCP-2815-5 (henceforth SCP-2815-6A) were subjected to genetic tests to determine origin and composition. Test were performed on samples taken from each fruit, including: peels, flesh, juice, stems, arils and seeds. Tests returned results showing fruits to be composed of a wide variety of DNA, including human and other non-plant material. Although each individual fruit varied as to the ratios between different genes, there was no identifiable pattern with regards to species of fruit. All fruits were found to contain all genes of every species ever recorded in Hungary since the 16th century. All D-Class tests performed have yielded results showing no direct negative effects.

The blood and organs collected from SCP-2815-5 (henceforth SCP-2815-6B) were also tested for. All results returned showed all specimens to be genetically 100% human material. Blood types varied, but included an unusual prominent amount of otherwise rare blood types. All organs appeared to be in a healthy state (excepting tissue degradation since removal from SCP-2815-5B). Experiments with organ replacement on D-Class subjects showed increased performance of all SCP-2815-6B instances compared to their original counterparts. Test subjects reported feeling healthier and "more wholesome".

All construction materials (henceforth SCP-2815-6C), especially the wooden materials, were scrounged for traces of organic matter, which similarly underwent genetic testing whenever applicable. All wooden materials were shown to consist of a mixture human of human and equine genetic material, whereas all inorganic materials contained considerable traces biological matter of the same makeup. 

One of our graphic artists has also been able to able to produce an approximate replica of the flag observed by FT-Δ4 during Expedition Ψ13-2815-1612-1, which I have included in this report.

[[include component:image-block name=Adytum.png|caption=Artist's rendition of the flag observed within SCP-2815-5.|width=300px]]

According to the reports that we have received from Agent Balogh, SCP-2815 regularly transports SCP-2815-6 in bulk out-of-town once a substantial enough amount has been collected. Maj. Obrenović's other field agents have further witnessed SCP-2815-6 sold at various farmer's markets throughout the country (including major urban centres such as Budapest, Debrecen, Miskolc and Nyíregyháza) and donated to a wide variety of private households and local charities. Obrenović has notified me that according to a certain retrieved document, at least one shipment of SCP-2815-6 has been confirmed in the possession of the Manna Charitable Foundation.

Conclusively, the singular most important note in these discoveries is that, for all intents and purposes, SCP-2815 seems to be utilizing SCP-2815-5 and their anomalous skills and resources for explicitly benign purposes. Maj. Obrenović has argued for armed intervention and possible termination, believing SCP-2815 to be using live humans in the creation of SCP-2815-6. While I honestly cannot fault him for being suspicious, considering the Sarkites' overall track record, neither can I accept nor condone his requests. We cannot simply purge an entire community based on circumstantial evidence and mere conjecture, especially considering the good these people do. A lot of Hungary's hospitals receive a lot of vital organs and rare types of blood from these very people, saving a lot of lives that would otherwise be lost. 

Moreover, SCP-2815 represents the first and only outright benign Sarkic community we have yet encountered. Taking hostile action against them would make us lose unique research subject as well as a potential strategic asset. Think of the medical benefits that could be drawn from studying them. We may even find something with which to counteract Sarkic halkosts! Not to mention the knowledge there is to be gained about a culture and civilization that we know next to nothing about. Thus, as SCP-2815 is of singular importance to the Foundation's third mission, it is my professional opinion that they be left unmolested.

**Comments on Expedition Ψ13-2815-1612-1**

Mission was a success. It's rare to have a milk run like that, even more so when dealing with these Sarkites. A pleasant surprise. I'd like to extend a personal thanks to Dr. Narváez and MTF Psi-13 for their invaluable efforts.

Dr. Hidegkúti's team of analysts have returned findings that have revealed the fruits of both the external and extradimensional trees of SCP-2815-5 to be composed almost entirely of human DNA. Same goes for their medical supplies and construction materials. We had D-Class test subjects try each fruit, who all reported no deviations from the real varieties. No test subject experienced any negative side-effects whether during or after the experiments. For all intents and purposes, these are just regular pieces of fruit.

However, if what Dr. Narváez has told me of these Sarkites is true, then we have all reason to believe that the fruits do indeed consist of real human tissue. I suspect they are merely transmuted via some anomalous process into their present states, in much the same way that SCP-2815-2 is able to transmute SCP-2815-4 into various building materials. In all cases, the results have proven indistinguishable from the real deal to every human sense of perception. It's also worth noting that the origin of their plentiful harvests have been unknown up till now and I'm fairly certain that they all originate from SCP-2815-5. And this is the stuff SCP-2815 sells at  farmer's markets! 

In essence: **they're making people eat other people**. While it doesn't seem to be dangerous in any way (in fact, these fruits seem to have higher nutritional value compared to their regular counterparts), I think nobody will disagree as to how disconcerting this is. For all we know, they might be using human sacrifices to produce these "fruits". In light of this, I'm requesting an armed intervention to shut down these Sarkites and remove their products from the market. Hopefully, we can prevent the entire county from being turned into unwitting cannibals and accomplices in murder.

Signed,
Major Miloš Obrenović, 
Commander of SCP-2815-5 primary containment team, 
Detachment of MTF Epsilon-6.

**Response:**
Dear Maj. Obrenović,

I forwarded your missive to the higher ups for decision and it looks like it made it all the way up to the O5 Council and Office of the Under-Secretary General. Sadly they have both voted against direct intervention against SCP-2815, citing that they don't consider the issue grave enough to merit a military response. The official explanation reads as follows:

------

"We have received and read your missive, Maj. Obrenović. Thank you for your concern.

The SCP Foundation and Global Occult Coalition will make no direct armed response against SCP-2815 in light of these recent discoveries, nor will the Foundation or GOC take any hostile action against SCP-2815 until further notice. SCP-2815 constitutes a hitherto unique opportunity for the Foundation to study a Sarkic society in depth without risking the lives of its researchers and operatives. The value of this research is indispensable, and no matter how disquieting it is to be eating disguised human flesh, the disadvantages of intervention far outweighs the benefits under the current circumstances.

Furthermore, the goods produced by SCP-2815 have proven highly beneficial, despite their composition and speculated origins, and despite your claims, you have failed to uncover or present any evidence that they are actively harming human beings. Their intentions, and particularly this "Tree of Life", have proven nothing but benign, as your own Agent Balogh has continuously reported. Their blood and organs are tapped and harvested from a tree rather than human beings, which they donate to hospitals and charities, providing valuable commodities that help saving human lives. We have here what is ostensibly a group of charitable Sarkites, who not only don't wish to harm people but actively want to help them, an unprecedented discovery, and your first reaction is to destroy it? 

The order stands: Epsilon-6 and Psi-13 are to contain, not engage, SCP-2815 as per established Foundation containment procedures. This decision will not be reviewed until additional evidence is uncovered as to the origins of SCP-2815-6 and general purpose of SCP-2815. If you are dissatisfied with this decision, Maj. Obrenović, you may request reassignment to another project.

Sincerely
General Hugó Solana-Ramírez, GOC Chief Commander of Sitra Achra
General Natalja Kostrova, SCPF Chief Commander of Sitra Achra"

------

Trust me when I say that I'm just as appalled at this decision as you are. Should you feel that your current posting won't allow you to make a difference, send me a signal. The Abyss Gazers[[footnote]]Moblile Task Force Psi-9 ("Abyss Gazers") is a battalion-strength force, consisting of personnel from the Foundation and Global Occult Coalition, trained in unconventional warfare against invading enemies through the use of heavy artillery, DMT enhanced perception, and Counter Occult Stratagems (COS).[[/footnote]] could use men of your calibre, Obrenović, and I can promise you more rewarding work than making people eat their own kind and babysitting a bunch of dangerous fleshcrafters for the eggheads. We'd be glad to have you. Give it some thought.

Best Regards,
Brigadier General Amelia Schornharst,
Regional Commander of Sitra Achra operations,
Central European Theatre.
