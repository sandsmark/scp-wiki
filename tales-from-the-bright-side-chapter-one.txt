    "I wish to again formally register my objections to this line of experimentation." I said, addressing my comment to the turned back of one Dr. Samit, an up and coming new researcher here at the Foundation. He seemed to think that the appropriate methods for advancement within our ranks was to insinuate himself with the Overseers. No one likes an ass kisser.

    "And, again, your objections are notified, 963, however I have the full support of O5-1 on this matter. SCP-682 is simply too dangerous, we must try all possible outcomes." I bristled when he called me by a number. Why do they always make the same mistake?

    "Mister Samit, my name is Dr. Bright. This," And I held out the amulet currently glued to my palm. "Is SCP-963. Please refrain from mixing the two up, or I will have Grangan there shoot you in the foot. No hard feelings, but I'm sure you understand." A small smile crept across my features as I spoke, gesturing to one of my small crew of assistants. Unlike certain other members of the Senior Staff I had never actually named the Junior Staff who had fallen under my wing, but the other staff had taken to calling them the Lucky Bunch, and it seems to have stuck. The name seems to  reference to the fact that researchers under my care tend to live longer, my own obsession with games of chance, and, quite possibly, a dig at my sometimes simian nature Amusing, I'm sure.

    Samit glanced uncomfortably at my underling, before turning his attention back to me. "Nevertheless Ni-" I cleared my throat, noting from the corner of my eye as Grangan slipped his hand into his inside coat pocket. "- Bright, We must-" Again, I interrupted his speech, in an effort to correct the fellow.

    "Dr. Bright. Only those who work with me on a regular basis are allowed to drop the title. And you will not be here long enough to work with me on a regular basis." Samit paled visibly at my words.

    "Is that a threat?" He questioned, anger in his voice.

    "No, merely good odds. You see, this ridiculous undertaking of yours has little to no chance of succeeding.
