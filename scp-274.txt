**Item #:** SCP-274

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Any and all buildings found to be infected with SCP-274 are to be reported immediately to a superior and the leader of Mobile Task Force Pi-1 (“City Slickers”). MTF Pi-1 is to torch SCP-274-1, and secure the infected building(s) by forming a quarantine of 1 kilometer radius under the guise of the local police and fire department. MTF Pi-1 is to terminate any cases of SCP-274-2 through the use of high-pressure fire hoses. Civilians insisting on entering an instance of SCP-274-1 are to be detained, and have one class B amnesiac administered. Any apparatus used to contain or handle SCP-274 should either be incinerated, or entirely composed of metal or glass, and thoroughly washed immediately after use. The cover story for a containment breach of SCP-274 should be gang-related arson.

**Description:** SCP-274 is a paint of variable color. Buildings inflicted with SCP-274 appear to have large amounts of graffiti covering the sides of the building, and often have large, disturbing designs to them (see addendum-274). While its consistency is that of normal paint, its composition reveals it to be 28% hemoglobin, 12% gastric acid, and 60% common components consistent with Krylon brand spray paint.

When SCP-274 is applied to a wall, it will begin to spread until it has covered the wall and any walls attached to it. SCP-274 is unable to spread on metal, glass, and horizontal surfaces. While SCP-274 spreads on buildings, it will convert the interior of a wall into a large mesoglea, the interior walls into a gastrodermis, and the exterior walls acts a protective shell and epidermis. Buildings coated entirely with SCP-274 will become cases of SCP-274-1.

SCP-274-1 exhibit signs of life, react to stimuli, and behave in a manner similar to many species of the Anthozoa class. Buildings converted into SCP-274-1 lure passing civilians by emitting noises from inside SCP-274-1. Sounds of glass breaking, loud coughing, or pained whimpers have all been reported from D-class personnel. It is currently unknown whether SCP-274-1 or the SCP-274-2s are responsible for this behavior, as the noises stop immediately after entry.

Typically, civilians will either call the police, or investigate the noises themselves. As subjects search inside SCP-274-1, they will be recognized as food by instances of SCP-274-2, if any are present. When a victim enters a room inside SCP-274-1, barring the entry way they will immediately be suctioned into a gastrovacular cavity belonging to SCP-274-1, later processing them into SCP-274 and one instance of SCP-274-2.

Specimens of SCP-274-2 are organisms composed of SCP-274 that appear as men or women wearing a gas mask or respirator, along with a bright, pastel colored hoodie. SCP-274-2 is able to support its heavy weight by its thickness and density in its membrane, which consists of 45-50% of the mass of SCP-274-2.

SCP-274-2 act as nematocysts for SCP-274-1, and can disguise themselves by merging into the walls. This is done by heavily compacting themselves, and implanting itself into an interior wall, save for their 'mask', which flattens around the wall, and disguises itself as standard graffiti. This behavior has proven to be a means of ambushing food for SCP-274-1, and will only wake when it detects something it considers a source of food.

SCP-274-2 possess a hinged operculum that ejects SCP-274 located in their right hand. This operculum looks identical to a normal spray can, and can project SCP-274 in the same manner. SCP-274-2 will attempt to spray SCP-274 into the eyes and mouth of its victims in an attempt to incapacitate, and encapsulate them. This method of attack has shown to be very painful, and will blind, and numb the victim from the neck down. Once tagged, the victim is placed into a gastrovacular cavity, resulting in a new SCP-274-2.

SCP-274-2 are able to duplicate themselves while inside SCP-274-1, and will produce one new SCP-274-2 every 24 hours. Once twelve SCP-274-2 specimens reside inside one SCP-274-1, further cases of SCP-274-2 will leave SCP-274-1 and find a new building to spray with SCP-274, avoiding any people they may encounter. Once a building is found, the SCP-274-2 will spray SCP-274 onto the building until it has completely dehydrated itself of SCP-274, and dies, resulting in another instance of SCP-274-1. If left unchecked, it is estimated that SCP-274 could cover a large city within 20 days.

||~ Date found: ||~ SCP-274-1 appearance ||
|| 01/██/2001 || SCP-274-1-1 depicts a large bus with the number ███ on its sides. The front of the bus has been replaced by a human like face, and the back is on fire. Bus patrons do not react to the fire, and all look towards the front of the bus. ||
|| 04/██/2006 || SCP-274-1-2 is designed to look as if it's falling apart. A face can be seen forming from the falling rubble. At the base, people are illustrated to be running away from SCP-274-1-2. ||
|| 03/██/2010 || SCP-274-1-3 depicts a beach with three sharks in the water, and several people running from the shore. Scene is behind a large tiki statue, which takes up most of the front of SCP-274-1-3. ||
|| 08/██/2011 || SCP-274-1-4 illustrates what is presumed to be Noahs ark at sea. The animals are replaced with creatures that do not match any known species. The ark is depicted to have a face with several sharp teeth, and eyes devoid of pupils or retinas. ||
|| 11/██/2011 || Several figures in level three bio hazard suits are fighting each other for what appears to be hand-sanitizer at the base of SCP-274-1-5. Several dead bodies are piled on top of one another in the background, and a large green cloud forms as a canine-like face, which is presumably laughing at the people fighting. ||
|| 07/██2012 || SCP-274-1-6 is painted to resemble a mausoleum, and has a large human skull decorating its front. Figures suffering from advanced stages of rigor mortis are painted around the base of SCP-274-1-6. Most notable is that several figures are wearing the standard-issue tactical armor distributed to MTF Pi-1. ||
|| 08/██2012 || SCP-274-1-7 is decorated with the scene of MTF Pi-1 setting SCP-274-1-7 on fire through the use of Molotov cocktails. A large depiction of SCP-274-2 can be seen attacking MTF Pi-1. ||
|| 08/██/2012 || [REDACTED]. ██ operatives dead as a result of a large mob of SCP-274-2, numbering between ███ to █,███. ||
