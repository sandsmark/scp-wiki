**Item #:** SCP-274

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Any and all buildings found to be infected with SCP-274 are to be reported immediately to a superior and the leader of Mobile Task Force Alpha-9 (“Bank Breakers”). MTF Alpha-9 is to set SCP-274-1 on fire, and secure the infected building(s) by forming a quarantine of 1 kilometer radius under the guise of the local police and fire department. MTF Alpha-9 is to terminate any cases of SCP-274-2 through the use of high-pressure fire hoses. Hostile civilians attempting to enter an instance of SCP-274-1 are to be detained, and have one class B amnesiac administered. Any apparatus used to handle SCP-274 should either be incinerated, or entirely composed of metal or glass, and thoroughly washed immediately after use. It is advised that the cover story for a containment breach of SCP-274 should be gang-related arson.

**Description:** SCP-274 is a paint of variable color. Buildings inflicted with SCP-274 appear to have large amounts of graffiti covering the sides of the building, and are often have troubling designs to them (see addendum-274). Its consistency is that of normal paint, but its composition reveals it to be 28% hemoglobin, 12% gastric acid, and 60% common components consistent with Krylon brand spray paint.

When SCP-274 is applied to a wall, it will begin to spread until it has covered the wall and any walls attached to it. SCP-274 is unable to spread on metal, glass, and horizontal surfaces. While growing on buildings, SCP-274 will convert the interior of a wall into muscles, bones, and tendons, while the exterior acts as a protective shell and skin. Buildings coated entirely with SCP-274 will become cases of SCP-274-1.

SCP-274-1 exhibit signs of life, and react to stimuli, but show no signs of higher intelligence or sentience. Victims whose homes are being converted are lured into touching areas covered in SCP-274 due to its wet looking texture, which gives the impression that SCP-274-1 may be covered in wet paint. This behavior in its victims is believed to be simple human curiosity, and not tied to any mind-altering effect.

Subjects that come into contact with SCP-274 will attempt to enter SCP-274-1, and will react violently to anything preventing their entry. Once inside, subjects will begin to explore SCP-274-1, and will be recognized as foreign contaminates by instances of SCP-274-2, if any are present. Once a victim enters a specific room inside SCP-274-1 they will immediately be pulled into SCP-274-1's digestive tract, processing them into SCP-274 and one instance of SCP-274-2.

SCP-274-2 act as anti-bodies for SCP-274-1, and can merge into the walls by heavily compacting themselves, and traveling through the walls interior save for their 'mask', which flattens around the wall, and disguises itself as standard graffito. This behavior has proven to be a means of hibernation for SCP-274-2, and will only wake when it detects something it considers a foreign contaminate.

Specimens of SCP-274-2 are large single-celled organisms composed of SCP-274. A semi-solid mass of multi-colored material in their chest cavity serves as the nucleus, and its outer shell appears as a man or a women wearing a gas mask or respirator, along with a hoodie, which are in bright, pastel colors. SCP-274-2 is able to support its heavy weight by its thickness and density in its membrane, which consists of 45-50% of the mass of SCP-274-2.

SCP-274-2 possess a organ located in their right hand that looks identical to a normal spray can, and is able to eject SCP-274 in the same manner. SCP-274-2 will attempt to spray SCP-274 into the eyes and mouth of its victims in an attempt to incapacitate, and sanitize them. This method of attack has shown to be very painful, and will blind and weaken the victim. Once tagged, the victim is placed into SCP-274-1's digestive tract, resulting in a new SCP-274-2.

SCP-274-2 are able to reproduce through mitosis while inside SCP-274-1, and will produce one new SCP-274-2 every 24 hours. Once twelve SCP-274-2 specimens reside inside one SCP-274-1, further cases of SCP-274-2 will leave SCP-274-1 and find a new building to spray with SCP-274, avoiding any people they may encounter. Once a building is found, the SCP-274-2 will spray SCP-274 onto the building until it has completely dehydrated itself of SCP-274, and dies, resulting in another instance of SCP-274-1. If left unchecked, it is estimated that SCP-274 could cover a large city within 20 days.

||~ Date found: ||~ SCP-274-1 appearance ||
|| 01/██/2001 || SCP-274-1-1 depicts a large bus with the number ███ on its sides. The front of the bus has been replaced by a human like face, and the back is on fire. Bus patrons do not react to the fire, and all look towards the front of the bus. ||
|| 04/██/2006 || SCP-274-1-2 is designed to look as if it's falling apart. A face can be seen forming from the falling rubble. At the base, people are illustrated to be running away from SCP-274-1-2. ||
|| 03/██/2010 || SCP-274-1-3 depicts a beach with three sharks in the water, and several people running from the shore. Scene is behind a large tiki statue, which takes up most of the front of SCP-274-1-3. ||

|| 11/██/2011 || Several figures in level three bio hazard suits are fighting each other for what appears to be hand-sanitizer at the base of SCP-274-1-5. Several dead bodies are piled on top of one another in the background, and a large green cloud forms as a canine-like face, which is presumably laughing at the people fighting. ||
|| 07/██2012 || SCP-274-1-6 is painted to resemble a mausoleum, and has a large human skull decorating its front. Figures suffering from advanced stages of rigor mortis are painted around the base of SCP-274-1-6. Most notable is that several figures are wearing the standard-issue tactical armor distributed to MTF Alpha-9. ||
|| 08/██2012 || SCP-274-1-7 is decorated with the scene of MTF Alpha-9 setting SCP-274-1-7 on fire through the use of Molotov cocktails. A large depiction of SCP-274-2 can be seen attacking MTF Alpha-9. ||
|| 08/██/2012 || [REDACTED]. ██ operatives dead as a result of a large mob of SCP-274-2, numbering between ███ to █,███. ||
