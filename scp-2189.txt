**Item #:** SCP-2189

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** --Instances of SCP-2189-T are to be kept in the low-security greenhouses at Biological Containment Site-103, with temperature, humidity and soil resembling the native conditions of their biological counterparts. Instances of SCP-2189-F are to be harvested when ripe, and the metals recycled.--

Instances of SCP-2189-T are to be individually isolated in climate-controlled terraria at Bio Site-103. Temperature, humidity and soil resembling the native conditions of their biological counterparts are to be provided when instances of SCP-2189-F are required for research. At other times, a dormant state is to be induced. Class 6 hazmat procedures must be observed whenever entering the terraria or handling instances of SCP-2189-F. Every 30 days, research staff are to collect dissection specimens from insect populations in the low-security greenhouses at Bio Site-103, as well as certain animal populations (outlined in Document 2189-501) from the region of █████ where SCP-2189 was first discovered. Anomalous findings from dissection specimens are to be escalated to the Site Director.

**Description:** SCP-2189 is the collective designation for three items superficially resembling specimens of //Malus domestica// (AKA an apple tree, designated SCP-2189-T-1), //Vitis vinifera// (AKA a common grape vine, designated SCP-2189-T-2) and //Musa acuminata// (AKA a banana plant, designated SCP-2189-T-3), as well as their associated fruit (designated SCP-2189-F-1, -2, and -3, respectively).

The bark, epidermis, and peels of SCP-2189 instances are indistinguishable from that of their non-anomalous counterparts, including genetically. However, in place of the expected internal structures are an intricate network of gears, springs, cams, and cranks. Removed components are indistinguishable from non-anomalous brass. 

When its internal mechanisms are functioning, instances of SCP-2189-T respond to their environment similarly to their biological counterparts, except that they are always in growing season, and parts do not naturally senesce: leaves never change color and fall off, bark never sloughs off, and instances of SCP-2189-F remain attached indefinitely and do not become overripe.

SCP-2189-T instances have the same needs as their non-anomalous counterparts in terms of water, sunlight, and soil type. When deprived of these, the instance's internal mechanisms begin to slow, eventually stopping altogether under circumstances corresponding to severe malnutrition. If appropriate exposure to sunlight, water, and soil are resumed, the instance resumes functioning. The internal mechanisms of an SCP-2189-F instance will cease functioning if it is picked before ripe, or once it has been separated from the corresponding SCP-2189-T instance for about the same amount of time it would take its biological counterpart to spoil.

Functioning instances of SCP-2189-F can be eaten and digested. Subjects report that the flavor and texture are typical of the type of fruit corresponding to the instance. Juices dripping from an SCP-2189-F instance incidental to being consumed are identical to non-anomalous counterparts. (However, attempting to squeeze or ream an instance to produce additional juice will result in jamming of the internal mechanisms, as described below.) Mechanisms that are bitten through will continue their normal movement, with portions of the mechanism moving from the main mass to the bitten-off piece and back again, as if the mechanism were still intact. This spatial anomaly appears to continue on an increasingly small scale as SCP-2189-F pieces are further broken down in the mouth and digestive tract.

If the peel of an SCP-2189 instance is removed, the mechanical interior will continue to function. However, if anything other than animal mouthparts penetrates deeper than the peel of an SCP-2189-F instance, the internal mechanisms of that instance will jam. Once this occurs, all portions of the instance will cease to function as fruit. The mechanisms can no longer be bitten through, and bites already taken will become indigestible. Consequent autopsies of animal and D-class test subjects identified either gastrointestinal trauma or copper toxicity as the cause of death, depending on the stage of digestion.

**Addendum 1:** One of the early test subjects of SCP-2189, D-51259, was subsequently assigned to be [REDACTED] for SCP-███, and consequently had her termination deferred by three months. When SCP-███ attempted to remove [REDACTED] D-51259 was given a detailed autopsy with biopsies of all tissues. This unusually thorough postmortem analysis was standard practice for all D-class who had been used to test SCP-2189, and the directive remained in D-51259's personnel file despite the fact that active testing of SCP-2189 had been concluded.

Microscopic brass gears were discovered in some samples of D-51259’s adipose and lymphatic tissue, and her liver was found to contain a cluster of five interlocked gears ranging in diameter from 0.1-0.4mm, the largest of which was attached to a 0.3mm-long camshaft. These structures were not found in D-class personnel who died during or shortly after testing of SCP-2189. Testing of SCP-2189 has resumed and a proposal to reclassify as Euclid is currently being drafted by the research team.
