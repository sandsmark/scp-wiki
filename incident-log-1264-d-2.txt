> **INCIDENT LOG:** 1264-D-2
> 
> **SCP INVOLVED:** [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1264 |SCP-1264]]]
>   
> **DATE**: Mar. 11, 1999
> 
> **LOCATION**: 15km north from the coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauaʻi
> 
> **PREAMBLE:** Engagement is authorized after a cruise ship is attacked by SCP-1264.  MTF Tau-11 (aka "Can Openers") is dispatched to the area with 5 Pegasus-class hydrofoils (PHM-7 through PHM-11) and a Juliett-class submarine (CMS-3) from Marine Command-09.  CMS-3 was standby and awaiting clearance from the PHM rapid response unit in order to launch its P-500 missiles without jeopardizing civilians.  Upon arrival of the PHM unit, the cruise ship was on fire and taking on water while listing steeply to port.  SCP-1264-A was seen from a large opening on the starboard side preparing a fishing net to throw over the survivors in the water.
> 
> **-13:01-**
> MTF Tau-11 PHM unit made contact with SCP-1264 while SCP-1264-A attempted to ensnare the survivors.  PHM-7 and PHM-9 then broke formation to engage SCP-1264-A directly using their 76mm guns.  SCP-1264-A was quickly suppressed as PHM-7 and PHM-9 fired along SCP-1264's starboard hull.  
> 
> **-13:03-**
> PHM-8, PHM-10, and PHM-11 fired their harpoon missiles directly into the stern of SCP-1264 from a distance of 750m away.  SCP-1264 was hit and took damage to 2 of its rudders.  
> 
> **-13:04-** 
> SCP-1264's port side turrets all turned 90° to their 9'o'clock position just before SCP-1264 rapidly dove into the water.  Afterwards, underwater explosions and floating debris were seen trailing off to the west.  PHM-7 and PHM-9 investigate.  During this time, CMS-3 makes positive radio communication with SCP-1264-1 (see addendum). 
> 
> **-13:10-**
> Behind the remaining 3 PHMs, SCP-1264 partially resurfaced, just enough to expose its port side turrets.  SCP-1264 was positioned with the PHMs' starboard hull directly in its line of fire.  6 of the port battery's 140mm guns fired into the 3 PHMs, effectively destroying them.   PHM-7 then relayed to CMS-3 that SCP-1264 was clear of the civilians.  CMS-3 then launched 2 P-500 missiles, targeted at SCP-1264.
> 
> **-13:11-**
> SCP-1264 then began to move towards the capsizing cruise ship and fired 2 of its 410mm guns at the exposed bilge keel at a distance of only 175m.  The ship exploded and splintered into several sections.  SCP-1264 then plowed through the floating debris.  The P-500 missiles' active radar was unable to distinguish SCP-1264 from the wreckage and they missed the target.  
> 
> **-13:13-**
> SCP-1264 launched Mark 14 torpedoes at PHM-7 and PHM-9 before it dove underwater again.  Both PHMs easily outmaneuvered the torpedoes.  CMS-3 is then ordered by Marine Command-09 to track SCP-1264 with sonar and pursue.  The remaining PHMs attempted to retrieve the survivors left in the water.
> 
> **-15:10-**
> CMS-3 lost contact with SCP-1264 55km NE of the incident. 
> 
> **ADDENDUM:** During this incident between 13:06 and 13:10, CMS-3 made positive radio communication with SCP-1264-1 over ELF radio signals.  Below is the audio transcript between the operator and SCP-1264-1 after its initial dive.
> * SCP-1264-1: (//deep gurgling noises//)
> * CMS-3: Unknown contact, you are ordered to resurface or be destroyed.  Do you copy?
> * SCP-1264-1: (//continued gurgling//)
> * CMS-3: Unknown contact, resurface or be destroyed.  Do you copy?
> * SCP-1264-1: (//gurgling pauses, a deep voice is then heard//) ...the...interlopersss...want my...compliance... (//gurgling//) ...granted...
> * CMS-3: Unknown contact, you have 2 minutes to resurface.  This is an ultimatum.  Do you copy?
> * SCP-1264-1: (//gurgling//) ...yessss... (//sustained gurgling for the next 2 minutes//)
> * CMS-3: Unknown contact, respond.
> * SCP-1264-1: (//loud banging is heard in the background//) ...preparing to...ressssurface... 
> //At this time, SCP-1264-1 resurfaced and destroyed 3 of the PHMs.//
> * SCP-1264-1: ...drown...with me... (//static//)
> 
> **EPILOGUE:** On Jun. 8, 1999, SCP-1264 was reported and photographed by a fishing trawler in the Indian Ocean.  Photos were intercepted and revealed that all damage done to SCP-1264 during Incident 1264-D-2 had been repaired.  Additional spending is approved for MTF Tau-11 for expanding its fleet to include aerial support, acquiring heavier armament, and installing passive sonar equipment at strategic locations.
