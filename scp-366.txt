**Item #:** SCP-366

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All samples of SCP-366 are to be kept in a small, sub-zero freezer in sealed, airtight containers and only to be handle by at least Class-2 personnel wearing full biohazard suits. Personnel involved in handling or experimentation with SCP-366 are not to be allowed physical contact with other people, food, or toilet seats (and all clothes worn while handling are to be burned) until they have been completely scrubbed down and undergone a brief testing period to establish a lack of infestation.

Infested personnel are to be kept in quarantine, with all waste products and clothing routinely burned. Unless testing is in operation, no medical action is to be taken except to administer painkillers and, in the case of an emergency, blood transfusions and potentially surgery to manually remove the infestation should it become hostile or agitated. Infested personnel are not to be fed certain well-known herbal remedies or citric fruits, and allowed hot baths upon request. Bathtubs should immediately be sterilized via chemical wash and high heat.

During testing and surgery, all surgical tools and biohazard suits should be sterilized, and if the situation permits, destroyed after use.

Live, fully grown specimens of SCP-366 should be contained in sealed, airtight containers and either frozen for testing, or incinerated at high heat.

Infected male personnel are to be placed in quarantine for a minimum of one month, under observation, to let the infestation take it's course, and even after being verified as free of infestation must spend a minimum of three months abstaining from sexual contact. Infected female personnel are to be placed in quarantine under medical observation twenty-four hours a day, and are encouraged to stay calm and relaxed best they can through the ordeal. Once the infestation has passed through personnel, they should abstain from sexual activity for a minimum of three months in order to determine their capability for infecting others, and the damage done to internal organ systems.

**Description:** Some debate has raged over SCP-366's origins. Certain parties believe that SCP 366 is a natural parasite, while others, noting its bizarre life cycle, believe it to be artificial. SCP-366 begins it's life as an egg, one of potentially millions laid by it's parent, and these eggs have proven resistant to all but the very high heat, subzero freezing, and produce a small amount of chemicals that can suppress an individual's immune system. SCP-366 eggs gestate in the human body, and are incredibly small, able to travel through the blood stream and into different organ systems, allowing for them to be found in the digestive tract, waste products, saliva, lymph...virtually anywhere or in anything in the human body. Eggs are relatively harmless and the only effects of their existence in an individual is a slight weakening of the immune system. Eggs are easy to pass from one individual to another.

The hatching of eggs is triggered by a number of occasions. An increase in certain hormonal outputs, commonly associated with happiness, adrenaline, ovulation in females, and sexual arousal will cause the eggs to hatch into microscopic larvae. After hatching, larvae instinctively 'swim' through the body via bloodstreams and whatever tissue they can worm or eat through to the reproductive organs. There are some slightly notable, but temporary signs of this happening, including minor muscle pain, upset stomach and heartburn, and in rare circumstances a small amount of blood in stools or spittle.

In males, the larvae settle in the seminal vesicles, where they lay potentially thousands of eggs each, before dying, never reaching adulthood. Some rare side effects that men may experience include muscle pain, a small amount of blood in urine and semen, and in rare cases internal bleeding may occur if SCP-366 is given sufficient hormonal stimulus to mature to adult form. In this case, immediate surgery to destroy the infestation if required. It takes at least a month for the infection to pass, in males, and has a small chance of re-infecting the host.

In females, the larvae settle in the uterus, where they attach to the lining of the uterus and quickly grow to adults, resembling meal worms. They remain inside the body and produce a number of unsettling effects, such as severe abdominal pains, blood loss, and [[DATA EXPUNGED]] When startled by hormonal upset, overt use of drugs, or surgical attempts the adult SCP-366 will attempt to burrow deeper into the body, causing sever complications. If left to it's own an SCP-366 infestation will pass in approximately several weeks to a month, upon the end of their life cycle they will [[DATA EXPUNGED]]

After several attempts at removing or treating an infestation, it quickly became clear that the only way to avoid severe complications and the potential death of the infested was to let the infestation run it's course. As upsetting as this may be, it has proven relatively effective, and with proper care infested may recover fully with time.

"The data can be found elsewhere, along with video and pictures. But right now, we'd rather not have everybody skimming this file revisiting whatever they had for lunch, okay? Plus, it's just gross." - Dr. Rights

It should be noted that, despite all precautions, SCP-366 can still be found outside of the SCP Foundation's security. Small outbreaks are located every few years, typically among young adults who are sexually active. In these situations, individuals are to be taken into quarantine and explained has having caught a "rare, exotic parasite" that's highly contagious. Given proper incentive, they may be monitored and, if deemed necessary, have memory alterations put in place.
