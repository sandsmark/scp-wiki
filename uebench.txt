+ Topic and Prompt of the month!
[[size 150%]][[collapsible show="+ Open FAQ" hide="- FAQ"]][[/size]]
[[<]]
+++ what's this?

Underread and Underrated is a project intended to shine a spotlight on, well, underread and underrated pages!

+++ oh neat. What's the blurb for?

As part of the associated UaU initiative, each month we'll be picking an element of SCP lore that people outside the general gestalt might not know about. We're also hosting writing challenges involving said lore!

+++ may i suggest [blank] for the topic?

Sure! Do note, however, that anything with a dedicated hub[[footnote]] Meaning a hub dedicated exclusively or primarily to the topic. GoI Formats would //not// count unless the primary content for the GoI is its formats.[[/footnote]] above +100 in rating can't be made topic. Sorry! D:

Suggestions should be PM'd to [[*user UraniumEmpire]]!

+++ oh cool how do i participate?

Just PM [[*user UraniumEmpire]] a link to your piece and she'll post it on next month's "Last Month's Pieces and Topic" section!

For artists: try to link to whatever social media page is hosting the art. It saves us space and ensures we have a solid reference.

This month's topic.

[[/div]]

On August 25th, [[*user PeppersGhost]] started the [[[scp-oct-hub|SCP Original Character Tournament]]], a clash of literary titans that spearheaded several great tale series.

On September 2nd, one [[[alto-clef-jr-fins-of-the-father|Alto Clef Jr.]]], GOC Agent and miraculous talking goose abomination, decided he wanted in, [[[goc-act-hub|and the rest is history]]].

The ACT was the OCT with a twist: while still the culmination of a little over 40 original characters from as many authors, Alto Clef Jr. would be matched with one (or more) of each character, during which he would kill them in a bloody rampage to the top. Along the way, Jr. would confront spooky hotels, the brutal California sands, and his own conscience.

One thing is certain: there will be blood.

+++ This month's challenge:
* **For writers:** Pick your absolute favorite character(s) not featured in the OCT, and write about how Alto Clef Jr. hunted them down and killed them.
* **For artists:** Depict Alto Clef Jr., before, during, or after a hit.
