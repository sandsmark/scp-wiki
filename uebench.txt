+ Topic and Prompt of the month!
[[size 150%]][[collapsible show="+ Open FAQ" hide="- FAQ"]][[/size]]
[[<]]
+++ what's this?

Underread and Underrated is a project intended to shine a spotlight on, well, underread and underrated pages!

+++ oh neat. What's the blurb for?

As part of the associated UaU initiative, each month we'll be picking an element of SCP lore that people outside the general gestalt might not know about. We're also hosting writing challenges involving said lore!

+++ may i suggest [blank] for the topic?

Sure! Do note, however, that anything with a dedicated hub[[footnote]] Meaning a hub dedicated exclusively or primarily to the topic. GoI Formats would //not// count unless the primary content for the GoI is its formats.[[/footnote]] above +100 in rating can't be made topic. Sorry! D:

Suggestions should be PM'd to [[*user UraniumEmpire]]!

+++ oh cool how do i participate?

Just PM [[*user UraniumEmpire]] a link to your piece and she'll post it on next month's "Last Month's Pieces and Topic" section!

For artists: try to link to whatever social media page is hosting the art. It saves us space and ensures we have a solid reference.

This month's piece.
[[/div]]
[[/div]]
[[/div]]

Writing a 001-proposal is //hard//. While the number "001" is barely different from 002 or 003, the slot comes with a veneer of significance and grandeur. Not only is a 001-proposal supposed to //be// important in some capacity to the in-universe Foundation world, it also needs to //feel// important to the out-of-universe readers viewing it. Often, it's an author's magnum opus. One can imagine the stress of writing something of such expectations, trying not to be derivative of others attempts at the task; for many writers over the years, it was a reality for a time.

That's not what [[*user TroyL]] did, though.

The consequences and logical conclusions of many 001-proposals, while implied, are often left unexplored. This is where Project Thaumiel comes in. By taking another perspective, or bringing something to its eventual end, or simply re-imagining it, each installation of Project Thaumiel explores the implications of each 001-proposal being real, in their individual bubbles of narrative.

Sometimes the Foundation tries to stop them. Thaumiel is the opposite of Keter. Sometimes they're complicit. But in each installation, a 001-proposal is given its time in the limelight, the full work of the author shining through. And given "project-thaumiel" is a tag, other authors are within their right to create something just as exploratory themselves.

Project Thaumiel has initiated.

+++ This month's challenge:
* **For writers:** Write a Project Thaumiel article.
* **For artists:** Re-imagine an existing 001-proposal, then translate that into a creative medium.
