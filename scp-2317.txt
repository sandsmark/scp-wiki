Seven heavy hooks are embedded in the entity's back, each one attached to a heavy steel chain connected to the lower end of one of the seven pillars embedded in the ceiling of the chamber.
> 
> At the time of the writing of this document, six of the pillars or chains have been broken or damaged, and only one chain remains intact.[[/span]]

> 
> [[span style="color:blue;"]]**Addendum 2317-2: History:** SCP-2317 was first discovered in 1922, by [DATA EXPUNGED]. Object was subsequently moved to what was then called Provisional Containment Area 17. Object was moved to Containment Area 179 in 1982, where it remains as of the writing of this article.
> 
> When initially discovered, four of the seven chains were broken, and three were intact: the breaking of the fifth chain in ████ corresponded directly to a ██████████ event in our world. The sixth chain, which broke in ████, was also coincident with a much more severe ██████████ event, eventually resulting in the deaths of two million persons.
> 
> Analysis of supplementary texts retrieved at the time of containment pointed to Procedure 220-Calabasas as an effective means of maintaining containment until an effective means of repairing or reattaching said chains can be discovered. Containment procedures were modified to incorporate Procedure 220-Calabasas. As records show that the sequence of ██████████ events shows an exponential increase in lethality, it can be extrapolated that failure of the final chain (SCP-2317-G), would result in an XK-Class End of the World Scenario. 
> 
> For this reason, every possible effort is to be made to ensure a successful Procedure 220-Calabasas.[[/span]]

> **Description:** SCP-2317 is a primeval entity known as "The ████████ ████, Devourer of Worlds" (name redacted intentionally). The Erikesh Codex indicates that it was captured and imprisoned by Erikeshan mystics circa 1894 BCE. An excerpt from the relevant passage follows:
> 
>> AND THEN KESHPETH LED HIS ARMY OF TEN THOUSAND INTO THE REALM BEYOND THE CLOUDS, AND THERE DID THEY DO BATTLE WITH THE DEVOURER, MAY HIS NAME REMAIN FOREVER UNREMEMBERED. AND THEN KESHPETH AND HIS TEN THOUSAND DID CRAFT SEVEN CUNNING CHAINS OUT OF THE BONES OF JASPETAR, SEVENTH BRIDE OF THE DREAD DEVOURER, MAY HIS NAME REMAIN FOREVER UNREMEMBERED, AND BOUND HIM WITHIN THE PEARL OF THE FATHER OF OYSTERS, HE WHO DWELLS UNDER THE MIRROR OF SALT IN THE REALM UNDER THE SEA. AND KESHPETH ORDERED THAT THE GATES TO THE FAR COUNTRY BE SEALED FOREVER, LEST THE DREAD DEVOURER, MAY HIS NAME REMAIN FOREVER UNREMEMBERED, FIND ITS WAY BACK TO OUR WORLD.
> 
> It is not clear how the 19th-century Society of the Golden Arrow discovered how to create a gate to Universe-Kappa-Erikesh, nor their reasons for doing so. What is clear is that the damage to the first four chains that bind the Devourer was accidental. By the time Our Founder took possession of the item following the dissolution of the Society, the organization had bankrupted itself several times over trying desperately to repair the damage caused.
> 
> **Projected Containment Profile:** Indications are that Final Containment Failure will occur at some point within the next century as of the writing of this article: the mean time to failure being calculated at thirty years. All efforts to repair or replace the chains have failed. All efforts to re-discover the method for creating these chains have proven fruitless. Research is currently underway to determine an alternate containment plan, but the possibility that anything can keep the Devourer from entering our universe is slim, especially as the original material used to create the chains (namely, the bones and sinew of another Devourer entity) are no longer in existence.
> 
> The primary threat is internal despair or panic. In order to maintain morale, a false containment procedure (Procedure 220-Calabasas) will be authored and implemented. This false containment procedure has been given a sense of veracity by the following means:
> * Incorporating elements of common ritualistic magics.
> * Incorporating elements of popular religious rites.
> * Incorporating elements of other known occult organizations.
> * Incorporating elements of other known Special Containment Procedures.
> * Incorporating references to similar but unrelated occult entities.
> * Increased information security regarding the elements of the procedure.
> * Appealing to the common institutional meme of the effectiveness of thermonuclear weapons in destroying paranormal entities.
> 
> Although completely ineffectual, the purpose of Procedure 220-Calabasas is to provide the appearance of active containment in order to allay anxiety among staff until a more permanent solution can be found.
> 
> In the meantime, preparations will be made in order to ensure the survival of the human race following Containment Failure. As most of the recommended preparations overlap with or are identical to preparations already underway in case of numerous other XK-Class scenarios, minimal additional resources are required.

> Approved by the unanimous vote of the Overseer Council on ██-██-████.
