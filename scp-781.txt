**Item#:** SCP-781

**Object Class:**  Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** 
SCP-781 is to be contained within a reinforced room with a buffer zone at least 25mx25m surrounding it.  Subject's chambers should have access to a bed, bathroom, and limited forms of entertainment as approved. As soon as subject initiates sleep, usually at around 20:00, all personnel present in the main containment chamber should evacuate. A minimum of two (2) personnel are to be present at all times outiside of SCP-781s chamber, and use the remote-monitoring equipment. Should any complications arise, Dr. Glass is to be contacted immediately.

SCP-781 is to conference each morning with Dr. Glass until dismissed, starting at 07:00.  Any personnel seeing SCP-781 in their dreams are to report to Dr. Glass for documentation. 

SCP-781's remains should be collected and placed upon the middle of his containment chamber after any incident resulting his death.

**Description:**  
SCP-781 appears to be an human male of mediterrenean decent, approximately sixteen (16) years old as of █/█/10. However, when he was first recovered in █/█/97, he appeared to be approximately thirteen (13) years old.  Autopsies performed on the subject have determined SCP-781 to be physiologcally identical to average humans. The reason for any anomalies surrounding SCP-781, including decreased rate of aging, is unknown.

While awake, SCP-781 seems to display only mild forms of control over his powers. Testing has shown that he is capable of perceiving and manipulating the dreams of sleeping subjects in his vicinity. While awake SCP-781 generally seems to be benign, and under his own initiative prefers to go through great lengths to grant pleasant dreams to tailored specifically for the subjects of his abilities.

Whilst asleep, SCP-781 is seems to be capable of involuntarily manifesting dream-content into a physical form. The majority of these manifestations are highly dangerous and hostile. SCP-781 himself appears to bear the brunt of the hostility shown by the majority of these manifestations but personnel should be warned that these manifestations are fully real, and both willing and capable of causing harm. SCP-781 is typically awaken by the hostile intent of its manifesations, but this does not seem to have any effect on them. Such 'manifestations' always remain relatively close to SCP-781, up to a range of about 10.1m. Manifestations forced out of this ranged immediately disappear. Manifestations seem to linger upwards of five (5) minutes even after SCP-781's physical death.

Lastly, it is to be noted that SCP-781 seems capable of coming back from apparent death. Though the subject does not exhibit resistance to injury or death beyond the limits of a normal human, twelve (12) hours after SCP-781's physical "death" any remains of its corpse disappear. Another twelve (12) hours later, a fully healthy SCP-781 appears close to the place with the largest concentration of his remains.


**Further Notes:**
Furthermore, while asleep, SCP-781's mere presence seems to induce 'waking dreams' on living creatures.  Sometimes, with no seeming provocation, subjects in this state are shown to suffer from a series of vivid 'nightmares', which enduce severe panic attacks in the victims. Many of these incidents are shortly followed by SCP-781 creating hostile manifestations, and thus personnel are now prohibited from approaching SCP-781 whilst it is sleeping for any reason.

Most personnel do not seem to exhibit any lasting damage from these mental attacks beyond what is normal for a traumatic experience, so no memetic effects are suspected to be involved.  Victims of these attacks all recall 'feeling' that SCP-781 himself was behind these attack, though attacks are never recalled by SCP-781 while awake. Animal testing has shown that animals that normally sleep are not immune from the 'walking dream' stage but none thus far have shown signs of panic whilst in SCP-781's presence.

**Addendum 781-01:**  Most of SCP-781's night-time manifestations are hostile to SCP-781, and are quick to cause him harm. On a typical week, SCP-781 is killed three times by his manifestations. The majority of manifestations never repeat themselves, but there have been cases where reoccuring manifestations have been cited. The following is a list of some of the manifestations seen more than once.

* Sewage burst from the floor, accompanied by a seemingly unending swarm of rats which quickly overwhelmed SCP-781 and proceeded to devour him alive, leaving only bones and bits of flesh.  The same occurrence happened the following night, but has not been observed since.

* A large humanoid figure about 4.57m (15ft) tall, made up of a transparent and highly acidic substance. Has appeared twice, both times after interviews with personnel other than Dr. Glass.   Tends to grapple SCP-781 in its arms until death due to heavy acidic burns or suffocation.

* A large floating mass with several tendrils bearing sharp needle-like spines, which foricibly drew SCP-781 into itself. SCP-781 died two hours later from blood loss. Appear three times in the space of a month, but has not been seen since.

* An old woman with rotting flesh, which attacks SCP-781 with her teeth and nails. Typically SCP-781 is able to fight back, but almost always sustains heavy wounds which require him to be euthanized by personnel. Has appeared three times.

* A man wearing a surgical mask, who strapped SCP-781 to his bed and proceeded to slice his abdomen open with a scalpel, removing several organs. Has appeared three times, each time after an autopsy was performed on SCP-781. Further autopsies have as a result been prohibited.

* A statue resembling [DATA EXPUNGED]. Is not observed physically harming SCP-781, but seems to cause the subject great distress, and often SCP-781 has passed out from hyperventilation at the sight of this manifesation. This particular manifestation has appeared four times now, starting on the day SCP-781 was exposed to [DATA EXPUNGED].

* A man resembling an older SCP-781, but wearing and wielding a bloody sword.  After wounding SCP-781, this man picked up SCP-781, and with the subject over his shoulder proceeded to break containtment and run through Site 17, killing three (3) D-Class personnel and two (2) agents before SCP-781 died from blood loss and trauma, causing the manifestation to disappear.  This manifestation has appeared a record number of five times. Personnel are instructed to terminate SCP-781 if this particular manifestation is sighted to prevent damage.

**Addendum 781-02:**  
//Subject appears to be quiet, meek, and amiable the majority of the time, and has been extremely cooperative to the foundation in regards to testing. SCP-781 seems to resent containment, but has never attempted escape. Subject is occasionally seen crying, especially on days following incidents resulting in his death. When questioned, subject merely claims to be scared, though is unable to describe his fears. Psychological analysis shows subject to be highly forgetful about personal events, especially those leading to his death.  Whether this memory repression is a coping mechanism to deal with his frequent painful deaths or inherent to him is unknown.//  

//Subject is fluent in Greek, Latin, an dialect of Renaissance-Era Romanian, and three yet unidentified languages, though linguists suspect at least one to be similar to ancient Estruscan. Efforts by myself to teach the subject English to improve communication are progressing quickly.// - Dr. Glass

**Addendum 781-03:** It appears SCP-781 is not able to be used as a reusable source of organs, as all parts of SCP-781 disappear twelve hours after his death, even if they have preserved or made functional within a different body. Proposals to use SCP-781 as a resuable D-Class personnel have been denied, as the stress this would cause SCP-781 might increase the severity of his manifestations. Furthermore, O5-██ raised concerns of exposing an immortal subject to sensitive information.

**Addendum 781-04:**  SCP-781 maintains a continued fixation on [[[SCP-182]]] which seems to come from infatuation, though SCP-781 expresses other purposes.  Request to introduce the two was raised to O5-██ and denied, as SCP-781 refuses to say why he would like arrange a meeting, or how he even knows of SCP-182. Though the two humanoid SCP are both housed in Site 17, neither have been previously allowed in each other's presence.

**Addendum 781-05:** //Subject had to be terminated during the course of an interview by Dr. ██████. Dr. ██████ was, during the interview, attempting to question SCP-781 about some of the reoccuring manifestations observed. At first, subject merely stated that it didn't remember anything, but as Dr. ██████ progressed SCP-781 began to show signs of hostility, eventually coming to sadistically describe the mental and physical tortures it wished to inflict upon the Dr. ██████. After further pressing by Dr. ██████, SCP-781 violently stabbed Dr. ██████ on the shoulder with a pen before being quickly terminated by security agents. As this is the first sign of anger or hostility SCP-781 has shown, it is perhaps prudent to refrain from questioning SCP-781 further about its nightmares.// - Dr. Glass
