**Item#:** SCP-781

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-781 is to be contained within a reinforced cell with a buffer zone at least 25mx25m surrounding it.  Subject's cell should include a bed, bathroom, and limited forms of entertainment as approved. As soon as subject initiates sleep, usually at around 20:00, all personnel present in the main containment chamber should evacuate. All personnel are prohibited from interfering with any situation within SCP-781's chamber between 20:00 and 07:00, despite any pleas for aid or attention from SCP-781.

SCP-781 is to be interviewed each morning at 07:00 by Dr. Glass. Any personnel seeing SCP-781 in their dreams are to report to Dr. Glass for documentation. 

SCP-781's remains should be collected and placed upon the middle of his containment chamber after any incident resulting in its death.

**Description:** SCP-781 appears to be a human male of Mediterranean decent, approximately sixteen (16) years old as of █/█/10. However, when he was first recovered in █/█/97, he appeared to be approximately thirteen (13) years old.  Autopsies performed on the subject have determined SCP-781 to be physiologically identical to average humans. The reason for any anomalies surrounding SCP-781, including decreased rate of aging, is unknown.

While asleep, SCP-781 is capable of involuntarily manifesting dream-content into a physical form. The majority of these "manifestations" are hostile and highly-dangerous, and on average SCP-781 is killed three times per week. Testing using D-Class personnel shows that these manifestations specifically target SCP-781 over other potential victims, but are capable of harming others should they attempt to interfere.

It seems that though it is required that SCP-781 be asleep to create manifestations, it is not required that he continue sleeping for their continued existance. Thankfully, these manifesations are not wholly independant of their creator, and always remain relatively close to SCP-781, up to a range of about 9m. Manifestations forced out of this range immediately disappear. Observers should be careful of manifestations that move SCP-781's body with them, as in that case they obviously do not suffer from this limit. Manifestations seem to linger upwards of five (5) minutes even after SCP-781's physical death.

Lastly and importantly, it is to be noted that SCP-781 seems capable of auto-resurrection. Though the subject does not exhibit resistance to injury or death beyond the limits of a normal human, twelve (12) hours after SCP-781's physical "death" any remains of its corpse disappear. Another twelve (12) hours later, a fully healthy SCP-781 appears within 10m of the place of its previous death.


**Further Notes:** While asleep, SCP-781's mere presence seems to induce 'waking dreams' in living creatures.  Sometimes, with no seeming provocation, subjects in this state are shown to suffer from a series of vivid 'nightmares', which induce severe panic attacks in the victims. Many of these incidents are shortly followed by SCP-781 creating hostile manifestations; thus, personnel are now prohibited from approaching SCP-781 for any reason whilst it is sleeping.

Most personnel do not seem to exhibit any lasting damage from these mental attacks beyond what is normal for a traumatic experience, so no memetic effects are suspected to be involved.  Victims of these attacks all recall 'feeling' that SCP-781 himself was behind these attacks, though attacks are never recalled by SCP-781 while awake. Animal testing has shown that animals that normally sleep are not immune from the 'walking dream' stage but none thus far have shown signs of panic whilst in SCP-781's presence.

**Document 781-01:** Most of SCP-781's night-time manifestations are hostile to SCP-781, and are quick to cause him harm. The majority of manifestations never repeat themselves, but there have been cases where reoccuring manifestations have occurred. The following is a list of some of the manifestations seen more than once.

* Sewage bursting from the floor, accompanied by a seemingly unending swarm of rats which quickly overwhelm SCP-781 and proceed to devour him alive, leaving only bones and bits of flesh.  Has been observed twice.

*A large woman holding a hose which seems to extend from the ground, which she forcibly inserts into SCP-781's throat. The hose seems to expell a thick white liquid, which the woman uses to drown SCP-781. Has appeared twice.

* A large humanoid figure about 4.57m (15ft) tall, made up of a transparent and highly acidic substance. Has appeared twice, both times after interviews with personnel other than Dr. Glass. Tends to grapple SCP-781 in its arms until death due to major acid burns or suffocation.

* A large floating mass with several tendrils bearing sharp needle-like spines, which forcibly drew SCP-781 into it. SCP-781 died two hours later from blood loss. Appeared three times in the space of a month, but has not been seen since.

* An old woman with rotting flesh, which attacks SCP-781 with her teeth and nails. Typically SCP-781 is able to fight back, but almost always sustains heavy wounds which require it to be euthanized by personnel. Has appeared three times.

* A man wearing a surgical mask, who straps SCP-781 to its bed and proceeds to slice its abdomen open with a scalpel, removing several organs. Has appeared three times, each time after an autopsy was performed on SCP-781.

* A statue resembling [DATA EXPUNGED]. Is not observed physically harming SCP-781, but seems to cause the subject great distress, and often SCP-781 has passed out from hyperventilation at the sight of this manifesation. This particular manifestation has appeared four times now, starting on the day SCP-781 was exposed to [DATA EXPUNGED].

* A man resembling an older SCP-781, wielding a bloody sword.  After wounding SCP-781, this man picked up SCP-781, and with the subject over his shoulder proceeded to break containtment and run through Site 17, killing three (3) D-Class personnel and two (2) agents before SCP-781 died from blood loss and trauma, causing the manifestation to disappear.  This manifestation has appeared a record number of five times. Personnel are instructed to terminate SCP-781 if this particular manifestation is sighted to prevent damage to Foundation personnel and property.


**Addendum 781-01:** //Psychological analysis shows subject to be highly forgetful about personal events in general, but even more so on those leading to his death. His memory repression was likely developed as a coping mechanism to deal with his frequent painful deaths. In an attempt to aid the development of his mental health, security personnel on nightly detail are hereby ordered to defend SCP-781 from his manifestations if possible.//  - Dr. Glass

**Addendum 781-02:** //SCP-781's mood, memory, and mental health finally seem to be improving. He has been regularly cheerful as of late, has begun to request company, and has becoming increasingly open with his thoughts. With some work, I've been able to get him to remember a few memories from before his time in the foundation. SCP-781 expresses gratitude of the Foundation's interference on his behalf.// - Dr. Glass

**Addendum 781-03:** //As of █/█/00 personnel are no longer to interfere in SCP-781's nightly attacks. It has been determined that the personnel casualties and resource expenditure needed to protect SCP-781 can no longer be justified, as continued interference has only caused the manifestations to become more dangerous and volatile, and SCP-781's immortal nature has been fully proven in any case.  Dr. Glass is hereby made a secondary consultant to this case, and Dr. ██████ is given primary charge of research concerning SCP-781.// - O5-█

**Addendum 781-04:** //It appears SCP-781 is not able to be used as a reusable source of human organs, as all parts of SCP-781 disappear twelve hours after its death, even if they have preserved or made functional within a different body.// - Dr. ██████

**Addendum 781-05:** //On all trials, it seems SCP-781 returns perfectly healthy despite mode of death. When exposed to mundane toxins, SCP-781 succumbed as normal, but always returned perfectly health. Proposals to use SCP-781 as a resuable D-Class personnel have are pending, though O5-██ raised concerns of exposing an untrusted and potentially immortal subject to sensitive information. Having a single genetically identical subject who could later expound on his experiences would be a great asset to future research in the case of fatal SCPs./ - Dr. ██████

**Addendum 781-06:** //Subject had to be terminated during the course of an interview by Dr. ██████. Dr. ██████ was, during the interview, attempting to question SCP-781 about some of the reoccuring manifestations observed. At first, subject merely stated that it didn't remember anything as usual, but as Dr. ██████ continued to press the subject for information, SCP-781 began to show signs of hostility, eventually coming to sadistically describe the mental and physical tortures it wished to inflict upon the Dr. ██████. After further pressing by Dr. ██████, SCP-781 violently stabbed Dr. ██████ in the throat with a pen before being quickly terminated by security agents. As this outburst is the first sign of anger or hostility SCP-781 has shown, it is perhaps prudent to refrain from questioning SCP-781 further about its nightmares.// - Dr. Glass
