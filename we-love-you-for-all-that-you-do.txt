title:We Love You For All That You Do
+++ //Hi, admins.//

This is all of us on staff. We know that you guys do more for the wiki than anyone can even guess - and that it must be stressful as all hell. We also know that being on staff is a thankless job, and that it must bite even more as an admin. 

Well, we want to show you that it isn't entirely thankless. Below, you're going to find a bunch of messages we've compiled from users and lurkers in our fandom/community who wanted to thank you and tell you how much they appreciate everything that you do. We've included messages of our own as well.

From all of us on staff, thank you for being hardworking, resilient, and the best bosses we could ever ask for. We love you guys and we're glad to call you our Administrators, and even more glad to call you our friends.

> The Wiki is an amazing community, and you guys make it all possible. You volunteer your time, talents, and experience to run this awesome place and don't get anything in return, which is a damn shame considering how much is owed to y'all. Just know lot of people appreciate you guys, even if we don't get the chance to show it. <3

> Dear Admins of the SCP wiki,
> 
> You do a great job. Seriously, your dedication to this relatively small corner of the internet dedicated to fanfiction of a 4chan creepypasta from 2007 is astounding, and there are few words I can use to even begin describing your handling of this site. While I don't know much or haven't even met on IRC or Discord some of you, I know for a fact that you each deserve so much praise. 
> 
> Shoutouts to Zyn: Legitimately, forum upkeep wouldn't be a thing without you. Your handling of ideas and drafts along with the founding of the Butterfly Squad can all be summed up to you, and I can't thank you enough.
> 
> Shoutouts to Roget: You've written, like, all the skips (OK, only about 5% of the skips, but that's a lot, OK?) and you've consistently remained dedicated with the site enough to have a whole 5 part essay about the site's history. I love that essay, man, and I hope it's updated soon.
> 
> Shoutouts to SoullessSingularity: You're skips are some of my favorites (you somehow made Herobrine an interesting concept), and I'm still amazed how you got almost all the 2XX2 slots. On top of that, you consistently work hard on O5 Command on the disciplinary team, which I can't thank you enough for.
> 
> Shoutouts to Dr. Mann and The DeadlyMoose: I'll admit that I haven't gone over much to the Wanderer's Library, but your work in basically making something from nothing is very valiant, and I enjoy your work on the top that.
> 
> Shoutouts to Quikngruvn: Old people? On the wiki? Madness! In all seriousness, much like Soulless, your dedication to the disciplinary team is always appreciated, and you're one of the oldest team member out there, only beat by Bright. Speaking of Bright...
> 
> Shoutouts to Bright and Clef: Well, the old guard is here. Even as the site has grown so much, you've tagged along for the ride, and that's always a good sign that it's a quality thing to be part of.
> 
> Shoutouts to Silberescher: I'll be real with you, the Fifthists are my favorite GoI, and SCP-3005 is my favorite skip. It's also the subject of my highest rated tale, Fifthdation. In essence, I can't thank you enough for making such an enjoyable little eldritch cult.
> 
> Shoutouts to Dexanote: So many excellent contests have been run by you, and you also are extremely dedicated to the disciplinary team. Keep it up!
> 
> Without you guys, this site would all fall to ashes, and I would never have improved my writing skills, which'll help me in real life. You're all awesome, all of you.

Basically, you all do a great job and I would like to extend the BIGGEST of THANKS.

From short stories to essays, monsters for rpgs to fan games, the realm you foster is as quintessential to the history of the internet as homestuck, as wonderous as Marvel or DC's comic book universes, and as bizarrely memetic as the life of Christian Weston Chandler. Please, do not think that your work goes unnoticed or unloved. From youtubers like Fredrik Knudsen, Tats Top Games, The Volgun and Lord Bung to casual fans such as myself, it takes serious grit to do what you do, and i want you to know we are all eternally grateful for what you do. Please continue to do your best. We will continue to devour it with rapacious glee.

> To our beloved admin team,
> Thank you all so much for your hard work and dedication over these many years. You have helped mold the SCP Foundation wiki into the rising pop culture phenomenon that it is this day, and under your guidance made the SCPF the friendly and accepting community that sets a high bar for similar communities across the net. On top of that, getting to know each of you better during my own time in staff, I can confidently say that you are all top notch people who don't nearly get the credit they are due for the long hours you put in. Hopefully this and the other messages you receive as part of this collection remedy that a little and remind you of the high esteem we all hold you in.

Thank you for always being there, being a powerhouse in the forums, being a fantastic administrator, and most importantly, being a fantastic, fantastic friend.

License issues, user drama, off site weirdness, onsite updates, etc. So much is done without fanfare and so much is done with little thanks or much complaining. I wanted to say thank you for maintaining the wiki and growing the community over the years. It's still a welcoming place and has only gotten better as time has gone on. I hope all staff, both new and old and retired, know they are appreciated for their time and efforts. Without you folks, the wiki would have fallen into ruin a long time ago and there would not be nearly as many spectacular projects coming to fruit based off the writings. Many endless thanks.

> I really thank you for what you do. Thanks to your work so many people have thrived, and (although I've yet to contibute) through this wiki, I was able to meet some AMAZING people. It's a lot of work to run a website as popular as this, and it's really sad to me that you don't get the recognition and appreciation that you deserve. I hope you all do well, and I wish you all the best. Thank you for all you've done for us. ♡♡♡

You've fostered a welcoming and engaging creative space and community and I'm so happy to be a part of it. Seriously, thank you. <3

> The wiki, and the community, would be nothing without the tireless efforts of staff, and the admins most of all. It’s a thankless job most of the time - you can’t please everyone, you’re blamed for things outside your control, and you get less time to write your own stuff. But as site members, we know how much we owe you. Every submission, every vote, is a token of our gratitude. We couldn’t do it without you. Thanks!

> Thank you for all the work you've done on this site. I have spent countless hours poring over the site and I know the sheer amount of work it must take to keep things running and looking good is massive. The work of an admin is often a thankless job, when things are going good people don't complain and when things go to shit everyone is down your throats. You are doing amazing work here, keep it up :)
