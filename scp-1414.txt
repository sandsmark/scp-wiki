**Item #:** SCP-1414

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1414 is to be contained in a 3 meter by 3 meter soundproof room on a stone end table, with at least one electrical outlet. It is not to be plugged in except for while being tested. 

**Description:** SCP-1414 is a ████████ brand radio with turn table, cassette player, and CD player, made out of wood and metals commonly found in radios. It is similar in design to an old-fashioned radio, and play FM and AM stations. Physically, nothing is out of the ordinary about its design or workmanship on the exterior, and taking it apart has found its wiring to be manufactured with no deviation from similar radios manufactured by ████████.

However, when spoken to, the radio changes stations, and is capable of picking up any station, regardless of frequency or location. This includes television stations, in which case it will play the audio of the current broadcast. It will also pick up an individual station, even if another station plays on the same frequency elsewhere. The speaker must refer to the station by its frequency or another method of identification, and the radio will switch stations to the one desired.

Testing has revealed that only one speaker can control the radio at a time, and it must be powered down for it to register a change speakers. The first person to tell it a station becomes the speaker it recognizes, not the first person to speak around it. 

How it recognizes speakers is unknown, as it will not register even the most exact recordings of a speaker as the individual.

When the volume is increased so that listeners experience the sound emitted from the radio to increase to 70 decibels, any listeners will begin to experience deafness of sound not coming from the radio itself. Within ten minutes of exposure at over 80 decibels, listeners will be unable to hear anything under 90 decibels outside of the radio transmission itself. 

After half an hour at any decibel level over 70, full deafness from outside noise sources will occur, remaining a permanent state. After listening for longer that, the radio will start getting quieter for the listener, but will not make them completely deaf from it. Powering the radio down and then back up will make it return to normal levels of sound, granted it remains below 70 decibels. It will not cancel the effect of deafness for sounds not originating from it.

The effect does not carry over to recordings of transmissions from it, only directly listening to the radio has the effect. 

Medically, no damage to the cells responsible for hearing is done by the radio.

**Addendum:** SCP-1414 was found in an antique radio shop in ███████, ███████ after a lawsuit against the shop was filed for negligence in █/█/██. The owner of the store confessed to not knowing where the radio came from initially. All witnesses to the radio causing deafness were giving an amnesiac and given fake memories, and the radio itself was taken into Foundation custody.
