**Item #:** SCP-5381

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** As of ██/██/2048, Virginia City, Nevada has been converted into a Foundation site. Road maps and GPS maps have been modified to remove Virginia City, and any civilians who approach Virginia City are to be prevented from entering with an appropriate cover story as listed in Document 5381-B

Staff stationed are to monitor the area for any incoming instances of SCP-5381. Any SCP-5381-1 instances delivered by SCP-5381 are to be retrieved by unarmed personnel, with any given papers to be signed under the name of Martha Jane Cannary.

All retrieved SCP-5381-1 deliveries are to be brought to the site's containment sectors, with each delivery to be placed in a Safe containment locker. Once secured, no other protocols are required, save for a weekly inventory check. Researchers may file a request to use any SCP-5381-1 items for testing.

Four (4) secondary outposts 200m away from Virginia City have been established. Should an instance of SCP-5381 be observed carrying a delivery outside of Virginia City's bounds, staff members are authorized to shoot the chain binding SCP-5381 to its parcel. This procedure has been statistically proven to decrease out-of-bounds deliveries by 49%. Intercepted packages are to be handled the same way as properly received parcels.

**Description:** SCP-5381 is the collective designation given to a group of intangible, semi-translucent humanoid entities native to Virginia City, Nevada. SCP-5381 are approximately 2.5 meters tall on average and are in good physical condition. SCP-5381 lack facial features, hair, or any defining exterior gender qualities. 

SCP-5381 wear a set of chains looped around their arms and back that cross over SCP-5381's chest in an "X" pattern. These chains show signs of extreme weathering and pulling these chains has proven to be the most effective method of moving SCP-5381-1 instances. While the chains bear a resemblance to rusted iron or steel, they are actually comprised of an unknown material.

SCP-5381-1 refers to the packages that SCP-5381 instances drag by their chains. SCP-5381-1 have an average volume of 15 cubic centimeters and are resistant to weathering and decay. The contents of SCP-5381-1 are diverse, and a comprehensive list can be found in the logs below.

SCP-5381 will produce a pen, clipboard, and a sheet of paper from a cavity within their abdominal region upon the completion of a delivery. Signing the paper under the name "Martha Jane Cannary" is the only method of relinquishing inbound SCP-5381-1 deliveries. Forcefully detaching SCP-5381 from its package will cause a distressed response from the entity. SCP-5381 will make physical contact with SCP-5381-1 and vanish once contact has been made. 

All attempts to interrupt this process, or subsequent attempts to relocate SCP-5381 instances afterward, have failed. SCP-5381 do not exhibit this behaviour during outbound deliveries.

The following items were recovered from an intercepted SCP-5381-1 package.

* One empty salt shaker, one unopened bottle of Malibu Coconut Rum 
> Bill,
> 
> William's locked the exorcist out of his room again. I keep telling him to stop pestering the guests but he never listens to me. The man's been dead for 200 years and hasn't learned a thing. Terrifying guests into shitting their pants won't make people want to come back here. 
> 
> What an idiot.
> 
> Anyway, we should really get a drink sometime, like the old days. I might not have the same iron stomach I used to, but I can still keep up with the boys. Write me back, I'll be waiting.
> 
> Your love, 
> Calamity 
> 
> P.S. Here's something to bring back the old memories. Just cause we're dead doesn't mean we can't party like its 1888! Bring this back when you visit, okay?

**Outbound**
* One sealed envelope with the outline of a mouth imprinted on it
> Bill[[footnote]] Wild Bill Hickok.[[/footnote]],
> 
> I hope this finds you well. I worry that the ghouls [[footnote]] SCP-5381 [[/footnote]] haven't been finding their way to you, they haven't been coming back with anything very often. I hope you're well.
> 
> Your love,
> Calamity

* One sealed envelope, one partially filled bottle of Malibu Coconut Rum, one knife with a blade made of silver, one iron bar
> Billy,
> 
> I miss our drinking days, don't you? Even if you can't visit me right away, at least we can hit the bottle together in spirit! I know you think that you love that woman, but that feeling will pass. You know what to do when it does.
> 
> And if you know where she's buried, don't hesitate to let me know. I can take care of it if you can't. That's what love is about after all.
> 
> Your love, 
> Calamity

* One sealed envelope, one foldable shovel, 16 millimeters of iron shavings, one filed salt shaker
> Bill,
> 
> I was kidding before, of course. I'd never want to hurt Agnes [[footnote]] Wild Bill Hickok's wife. [[/footnote]] intentionally. I was hitting the spirits a bit too hard that day, and for that, I must apologize. I do hope you realize one of these days that we'd be better buried together than apart. I would have the ghouls move me but the damn fools can't do much other than delivering mail. 
> 
> Maybe you'll have better luck on your end. 
> 
> Love,
> Calamity

**Inbound**
* One sealed envelope, one empty bottle of Malibu Coconut Rum
> Calamity, I appreciate all your gifts but I am a happily deceased and respectfully buried man. Please stop sending us presents, as Agnes and I are having a very hard time moving them. We're ghosts, not spirits. Please be more sensitive in the future, you might offend someone.

* One sealed envelope, one filled salt shaker
> I think the living call this 'ghosting'. Seems a bit harsh in my opinion, but that's what needs to happen. I'm ghosting you, Calamity. See you next reincarnation.
