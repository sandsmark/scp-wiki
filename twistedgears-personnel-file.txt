**Name:** Daniel "TwistedGears" Navarro

**Personnel Classification:** Level 2, Class C

**Occupation:** Field Agent, often deployed within Mobile Task Force Eta-10 ("See No Evil")

**Location:** Site-19

**Profile:** Psychological profiling has recently revealed Agent Navarro's inability to differentiate certain humanoid subtypes from actual humans, resulting in the personification of anomalies. This results in Agent Navarro being unable to follow protocol pertaining to these humanoids without psychological damage. As such, Agent Navarro is forbidden from interacting with humanoids in any way. This can be temporarily overridden in the event of an emergency or containment breach, though the override for Safe and Euclid class objects must be given by Level 4 personnel.

Agent Navarro will freely speak about the designation TwistedGears, however due to the variety and nature of his explanations they are to be ignored until further notice. Agent Navarro has offered the following explanations:

> 1. Agent Navarro is Dr. Gears from the past
> 2. Dr. Gears is Agent Navarro from the future
> 3. Agent Navarro is Dr. Gears in the present, claiming to have been affected by a temporal anomaly. Agent Navarro cites Dr. Gears current MIA status as proof.
> 4. Agent Navarro is from an alternate reality where he is the parallel version of this reality's Dr. Gears. This is why he is an agent, and our version is a researcher. He also claims his reality does not have spaces in their written languages.
> 5. Agent Navarro is a former member of the Church of the Broken God, and joined the Foundation after being administered a Class Omega amnestic
> 6. Agent Navarro is/was affected by SCP-217, sometimes claiming to have been cured by SCP-500/SCP-427. Agent Navarro often cites explanations 1 and 2 as proof.
> 7. Agent Navarro is SCP-2000. Agent Navarro cites this as the source of his personification of some humanoid anomalies.
> 8. Agent Navarro was given the designation during a classified operation
> 9. [DATA EXPUNGED] (Agent Navarro will literally say "data expunged" in a robotic voice.)
