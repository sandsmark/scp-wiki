> Description: A short iron sword, a cashew-shaped jade magatama bead pierced with a hole, and a circular mirror bearing an eight-pointed star design.

“Is the sword even sharp?”  “Not really, Doc.”  “Just… just throw that crap in the dumpster, then.”

The staff at Site-33 seemed to think that they had a keen wit when it came to nicknames.  Site-33 itself, of course, was “Rolling Rock”.  Its director, the bearded, bespectacled Dr. Sanders, was “the Colonel” (though never to his face).  And the building designated General Non-Anomalous Testing and Containment (GNATC) was “Granny’s Attic”.  If the Foundation was in possession of a specimen or an object that turned out to not be anomalous, well, it generally ended up in the Attic.

> //Designation: BDH-483
> Description: A human left canine tooth, with trace amounts of ash of burnt sandalwood and pork proteins.
> Recovery: Kandy, Sri Lanka//
“Who even brought  that thing here, the tooth fairy?  Trash, trash.”

In theory, things in the Attic (being non-anomalous and therefore not interesting) would eventually be processed in one way or another.  That glowing worm that turned out to be a bioluminescent animal unknown to science but otherwise uninteresting?  Released back into the cave where it had been found.  That tour bus of Mexican pilgrims to Guadaloupe who had been contained on suspicion of having been infected by a dangerous meme?  Heavily dosed with amnesiacs and dropped off at the roadside.  Who knows, maybe some of them made it back home to the loved ones who had last seen them eleven years ago.

In theory.  In practice, processing non-anomalous items was the kind of duty that none of the Site-33 researchers seemed to ever really get around to doing.  There was too much interesting work to be done on the SCP-level objects, you see.  And so, an object in the Attic tended to stay in the Attic.

On February 7, Dr. Jerome Savonarola found himself in the Penalty Box.  The PB (officially, the “Processing Bureau”) was the office charged with running the Attic.  This office was normally vacant, but from time to time the Colonel would assign personnel there, more as penance or to get someone out of the way than in order to ensure the fulfillment of the duties of that office.  In this case, Savonarola had (according to the Colonel) bungled the containment protocol of Site-33’s colony of SCP-831.  (“How was I supposed to know that D-29934 had a loose dental filling?”).  Before the napalm had even been hosed away, it was “off to the PB with you, Jerry.  Maybe a tour of duty in the Attic for a few weeks will remind you to follow protocol to the letter.”

“Scribble-scrabble and a stinky shoe.  Ugh.  Pitch ‘em.”

Protocol to the letter.  Have it your way, Colonel.  As long as I’m here, I’ll follow the GNATC manual to the literal letter, just like that old passive-aggressive soldiers’ trick for coping with a martinet of an officer.  Particularly, Procedure TRS-β, which expressly requires the Site PB duty officer the duty to “expeditiously process  GNATC items with a view towards minimizing expenses of continued maintenance and storage.”  If they want me to take out the trash, that’s what I’ll do.

“Sticks and stones.  Charming.  Dumpster.  Keep the gold, though.”

As it turned out, the Penalty Box could be surprisingly cathartic.  A few more dumpster-loads, and there’d be nearly enough room in here for a squash court.

“Gold, again.  More of it, this time.  Melt it down, and put the resulting ingots in the trunk of my car.  I, er, have some research in mind.”

“Incinerator.  Why are you looking at me like that?”
