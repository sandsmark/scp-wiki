**Item #:** SCP-503

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-503 is to be contained within a holding cell at all times. The subject is to be under constant observation by security personnel, if the subject appears to be attempting to obscure the view of the security cameras within the cell a security team equipped with non-lethal weaponry must be immediately dispatched. There are to be no objects within the subject’s cell capable of easily causing harm. Any strange activity should be treated as a full-scale emergency. Any researchers studying SCP-503 must be searched by security personnel for potentially dangerous objects. Subject is to have weekly social interaction with Foundation personnel not currently assigned to its case. SCP-503 currently has a weekly chess game with Dr. ████.

**Note on Procedures from Dr.████**: The searches are //not// optional. I don't care if you think they're a waste of time. I refer you to Incident Report 503-B, for anyone who thinks otherwise.

 **Description:** SCP-503 is a Caucasian male, sixty-three (63) years of age, completely bald (formerly black hair) with brown eyes. The subject’s lower jaw is a prosthesis as a result of the events of Incident 503-A, which occurred before the subject was in foundation custody.

SCP-503 demonstrates a remarkable proclivity towards short-term good fortune and long-term misfortune. The first manifestation of this was at the age of eleven (11), when the subject was involved in an automobile accident with its family while in a heavily forested and mountainous area. While the subject survived, its parents and two (2) siblings were killed. In addition, the subject was trapped in the car for █ days before being discovered.

The subject has had three (3) marriages, all ending in divorce, during which it has had twelve (12) children, none of whom survive. As far as the subject is aware it has no living family. The subject is suicidal, its prosthetic jaw being the result of Incident 503-A: the subject attempted to commit suicide with a shotgun, which left the subject alive but caused massive cranial damage including total loss of the lower jaw. The subject has also survived the following events according to his medical record: Near-drowning and hypothermia after a plane crash into the North Atlantic, being trapped in a burning building, falling from a 34th story window, as well as suicide attempts by hanging, painkiller overdose, and, as previously mentioned, shotgun. Although the subject has won the lottery on two (2) separate occasions, by the time it came into Foundation custody medical bills had bankrupted it.

SCP-503 is currently being researched by Dr. ███████ to determine if the subject’s properties can be reverse engineered to increase the survival chances of field agents.

**Experiment Log 503-1**
Attending Researcher: Dr. ███████
Purpose: Determine whether SCP-503’s condition is a true phenomenon or simply coincidence.
Procedure: A deck of fifty-two (52) regular playing cards are shuffled by Dr. ███████. 503 is asked to guess how many cards from the top the ace of spades is.
Results: Test 1: Success. Test 2: Success. Test 3: Success. Test 4: Success. Test 5: Success. Testing with this method ceases at this point.
Conclusion: Inconclusive.

**Experiment Log 503-2**
Attending Researcher: Dr. ████████
Purpose: Continued testing to determine nature of SCP-503’s condition.
Procedure: 503 is asked to guess what Dr. ███████ is currently thinking. Designated thoughts for the experiment are as follows: 1: a manatee. 2: Batman. 3: SCP-682 [Note: SCP-503 is not aware of any other objects in the custody of the Foundation]
Results: Test 1: Success (although the subject referred to it as a “sea cow”). Test 2: Success. Test 3: Failure (subject guesses an ice cream cone)
Conclusion: SCP-503’s condition is likely paranormal, and strictly probabilistic in nature. Subject could not guess something it had no awareness of, indicating that it is not telepathic. [Note from Dr. ███████: It seems likely that 503 is a pseudo-reality bender. Although he can’t do the impossible, he seems to always achieve the best possible outcome. These tests aren’t enough to determine the extent of his powers. We need to go bigger.]

**Experiment Log 503-3**
Attending Researcher: Dr. ████████
Purpose: Continued evaluation of the limits of SCP-503’s ability.
Procedure: 503, under strict supervision, will load a revolver with five (5) rounds, spin the chamber, then fire the gun into his chest, aiming at the heart. Medical personnel will stand by if the test should fail. [Note from Dr. ███████: A headshot would be too risky.]
Results: The revolver discharged a round into 503’s chest, hitting the heart. The physicians who treated it described his survival as “miraculous”: The bullet went through the heart at the intersection of the four chambers, causing no serious damage.
Conclusion: SCP-503’s luck manifests itself in non-obvious ways. [Note from Dr. ███: Dr. ███████ has received disciplinary action as a result of this. I have no idea how this test was approved.]

**Incident Report 503-A**
Approximately one (1) week before the subject came into Foundation custody, it attempted to commit suicide by firing a shotgun at point blank range through the jaw into the head. However, the jaw absorbed much of the blast, leaving 503 alive but critically injured. A civilian who heard the shot found 503 and called an ambulance. 503's medical records came to the attention of the Foundation when researchers were monitoring a hospital for a possible outbreak of SCP-███.

**Incident Report 503-B**
During Experiment 503-█, research assistant B████ was not properly searched by security personnel before entering 503's cell. At some point during the experiment, B████ dropped a ███-brand ball point pen. After the experiment, SCP-503 found the pen and attempted to commit suicide, which it survived, but the attempt left it in critical condition for a week. Research assistant B████ recieved disciplinary action and has been reassigned.
