**[[[SCP-2060]]] - We Burn Every Day**
//"When the head of an instance is ignited and the feet placed in the mouth, the user will experience the effects and taste of smoking a cigarette, up to and including nicotine addiction. Instances of SCP-2060 will continue to burn up to the lower torso, down to the bone until scorched; they do not burn past the waist. SCP-2060 instances appear to feel pain, reacting in a manner similar to normal humans if ignited or masticated, but continue to utter phrases spoken by their counterparts."//

**[[[SCP-2143]]] - Singin' in the Rain**
//" Although the symptoms of the disease are that of septicemic plague (diarrhea, fever, low blood pressure, gangrene, shock, etc.), the disease is untreatable by antibiotics. The disease's vector is unknown. If SCP-2143 is allowed to sing, any afflicted persons will quickly recover, and the area of effect will dissipate."//

**[[[SCP-2210]]] - The Bureaucracy**
//"High-speed camera surveillance shows unknown individuals entering the residence, leaving the appeal form, and carrying off objects and possession that equal the value of the late fee. If the policyholder runs out of possessions and money, they will be accosted by an unknown individual in a business suit and mask, who will proceed to abduct them and carry them through the nearest doorway, whereupon the two will disappear."//

**[[[SCP-2350]]] - A Romance in Higher Dimensions**
//"Every 256 hours, a purple oblong portal (approximately 16 meters tall) appears somewhere within one of the parks. The portal emits what is theorized to be Hawking radiation, and causes severe burns to all unshielded organisms within a 2.67 meter-radius of the portal. Based on observation of the entities that exit it, it appears to be a gateway into a universe with at least four spatial dimensions."//

**[[[SCP-2490]]] - Chaos Insurgency Special Operative Alpha-19**
//"Targets uniformly report SCP-2490 either moving towards them without moving its legs (with its arms outstretched) or scuttling in a matter akin to a crab. SCP-2490 appears to have a type of short-range teleportation (although another hypothesis is that there are multiple instances of SCP-2490). In one instance, SCP-2490's target locked it in a closet, then turned around to see SCP-2490 emerging from a nearby bathroom."//

**[[[SCP-2570]]] - MCA and Heartbreak**
//"In particular, any music featuring the voice of musician Kanye West has a strongly negative effect on SCP-2570. West's voice also halts the corrosion, causing an inverse process where the corrosive liquid is recompiled into its original substance and/or retreats back into the rift. Instances of SCP-2570-3 are neutralized and reverted to their original selves. However, complete closing of the rift has been unsuccessful."//

**[[[SCP-2650]]] - Pediatric Pupaphobia**
//"If alone, SCP-2650-B will convert the child into an instance of SCP-2650-1. The mechanism of conversion is unknown. Instances of SCP-2650-1 are various preadolescent children, between the ages of 5 and 9, with their own instances of SCP-2650-A. They share the same neurological abnormality as SCP-2650-B, but their behavior is markedly different."//

**[[[SCP-2790]]] - You've Got a Squid in Me**
//"As of 8/03/██, only 87% of test subjects had suffered complications from the grafting procedures, which were relatively minor: specifically, unexplained rejection of 2790's gorgeous skin and post-transplant infection. 70% of all personnel report the onset of tissue necrosis at the grafting site and the surrounding area, indicating that their bodies recognize the imperfection of their own skin and are removing them for 2790's skin."//

**[[[SCP-2810]]] - Organism.R.G.A.N.I.S.M.**
//"For example, human lungs are composed of actual humans that inhale and exhale, while plant leaves are composed of smaller, wilted plants arranged and folded in such a way that only their leaves are exposed to sunlight. Microscopic examination reveals that these cellular-sized composites are themselves composed of exponentially smaller composites carrying out their bodily functions, which in turn are composed of smaller copies, and so on."//

[[tab Whatchu talkin' bout Willis?]]
[[[SCP-2060]]] is loosely based on a talk I had with my father about... six months, I think, before I posted it. We were out on a walk and he was in the middle of a diatribe about how Dubya was Cheney and Bush Sr.'s puppet, as well as how Cheney was the real mastermind behind the Middle East invasions in order to steal their oil... and then he mentioned cigarettes for some reason, and for some other reason the words Cheney and cigar resonated with me. Originally I wrote about Dick Cheney alone being turned into a cigarette, and then I wondered what if all kinds of celebrities were turned into cigarettes? Thus, SCP-2060 was born.

[[[SCP-2143]]] will be familiar to anyone who's read the Asterix comics. Specifically, he's based off of Cacofonix the bard, whose singing is so bad that it causes rain both indoors and outdoors- at one point, he, Asterix, and Obelix travel to India to relieve a drought with his song. I was struck by how much Cacofonix resembled an SCP: he had a strange ability, was under containment (by Fulliautomatix the blacksmith, who smacked him in the face if he tried to sing) and was actively sought out by certain Groups of Interest like the Indians and Romans. So I turned him into an SCP. I couldn't write Cacofonix the SCP, since he lived in the year 50 BC (and it would be plagiarism). So instead, I drew upon another song-related figure: the god Apollo. Greek gods are supremely petty and vengeful bastards, so a conflict with his godly father Zeus provided some emotional backstory and also a reason for his affliction.

[[[SCP-2210]]] was written up for a Bright Challenge, specifically a prompt posted by [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-1014402#post-2115705 |InsipidParoxysm]]]. He postulated an anomalous insurance company, so I ran with the idea. I started by thinking that a lot of parties in the Foundationverse would want insurance and/or special materials they couldn't get anywhere else given the nature of their work, hence the use of multiple Groups of Interest. But it wasn't enough to have an otherwise-regular insurance company -the company itself needed to be anomalous. It's easy enough to get into a contract with SCP-2210, but impossible to get out. The geography of SCP-2210 itself is based around unnecessary complexity and obfuscation; the strange currency types and the consequences of failure to pay are just weird; while the insurance policies provided add fridge horror (such as North Korea being the result of an anartist's vision). At the core, SCP-2210 is an eldritch horror pretending to be GEICO.

[[[SCP-2350]]] was a pretty simple self-imposed challenge. I wanted to see if I could tell a story - a full blown television serial plot - without actually telling a story. I also wanted to write a Keter-class object and Neutralized object. Thus, SCP-2350. I had several character stereotypes laid out: the jock, the chick, the twins, and the outcast. The plot is fairly simple: the outcast is in love with the chick, while the chick is in a relationship with the jock. The twins simply add background material to distract from the love triangle. The outcast does his best to win the heart of the chick, but it isn't enough, and he goes mad with grief. He kidnaps her and is then shot to death. The twist is that this soap opera actually is a soap opera - they're all actors in an extra-dimensional serial shot on Planet Earth. I consider this my weakest effort since I didn't have any real plans beyond the soap story.
-----
[[[SCP-2490]]] was another challenge of mine. I wanted to write something that made the reader paranoid. The spark came from a random thought whereupon I imagined a mannequin watching me in my house in the middle of the night. I used that thought and expanded upon it: a mannequin watching its target, picking up on their mannerisms and habits, before literally picking up those memories, mannerisms, and habits to steal an SCP. I used the interview log to expand on that horror, draw the reader in, and try to force them to imagine the same thing. The final burst of horror comes from the implications that there are multiple instances of SCP-2490.

[[[SCP-2570]]] is my personal favorite and I wish more people read it. //This is a story about Nathaniel Hornblöwer, not Kanye West!// The Beastie Boys are by far my favorite rappers, and I wanted to write a tribute to MCA. Thus, I wrote a story about fans who try to bring MCA back from the grave but fail due to a minor mistake - with major consequences. The use of Pali as a language is a direct reference to MCA's Buddhist faith, while Kanye West simply adds more flavor to the article. It's simple, and I like to think beautiful.

[[[SCP-2650]]] is the first truly successful SCP I wrote, so it holds a special place in my heart. This one is inspired by Slappy the Living Dummy. I still don't like ventriloquist dummies, so I wrote an article to express that fear. I also wrote about children and their imaginary friends, because when I was a child I had far more imaginary friends and stuffed doll friends than real ones. There are some underlying themes of child predation, but I want to make it clear that pedophilia has //absolutely nothing// to do with the article other than the fear of a stranger being alone with one's children.
-----
[[[SCP-2810]]] was my  entry into the Short Story contest. This piece is very, very body-horror focused, probably as an homage to David Cronenberg. I only vaguely remember what the inspiration for this was, as I was half-asleep while I wrote up the preliminary drafts. I do remember that I wanted to write SCPs about fractals and communism, so I suppose this was the result of that (Actually, I guess I do remember the inspirations for this piece). I also suffer very heavily from dermatophagia and dermatillomania to the point of sometimes peeling and eating skin off my foot, and I badly wanted an outlet to express that. When I first wrote the preliminary draft up, I wanted to tie it into GRU-Division "P" as an attempt to create a "communist virus". I couldn't fit all of that into the article, so I cut out the bioweapon background and simply laid it on as a mysterious plague. My favorite piece of fridge horror comes from the dermatophagia. It's literally autocannibalism in action - human sufferers are biting and chewing pieces of human flesh made of humans, forcing tiny humans to bite and chew and vomit and defecate pieces of human flesh made of other, even tinier humans.  I think the reason that this article is my most popular is the tight focus of the body horror.
