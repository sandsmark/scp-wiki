+++ ##blue|How Do You Know If## 
+++ ##blue|You're Being Haunted?##

It's more likely than you think. Over five millionhomes are sold every year in the United States, and several million apartments are rented. 

Of these, up to 10% are haunted. These properties are usually sold to low-income families as a method of 'dumping' unwanted property.

Common signs of a haunting include:
- Odd behavior in children or pets
- Items levitating in midair
- Manifestation of a green, mold-like substance
- Sudden rusting of metals
- Phantom voices

+++ ##blue| Am I in## ##red|Danger?##

Most hauntings are benign, and to date, there have been no documented human deaths related to a haunting in the United States.

However, physical harm can still occur-- burns, scratches, and scars have been left on 
victims of hauntings in the past.

Most families who live in haunted houses are financially disadvantaged, and are unable to relocate.
