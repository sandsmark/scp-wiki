**History:** Dr. Elliott came to the Foundation’s attention during the [REDACTED] Greenhouse Incident. (See documentation for Containment Breach ███-████ for further details.) The artifact reappeared in [DATA EXPUNGED] her work at the time. She [DATA EXPUNGED] but escaped with minimal greening. She was approached shortly thereafter, and recruited promptly upon attaining her doctorate.

**Note:** //Personnel concerned with approving Dr. Elliott’s requests for close examination of SCP objects should note that she displays a worrisome degree of tactile curiosity. Unless you want to have her literally poking your Safe-class item, or sniffing at a Euclid, exercise caution. At least she has enough sense not to risk it around the really dangerous ones.// -- ███ █████

//Whatever it is, get it out of your office. I don’t want to find it in the break room, or my coffee. I saw what happened to Kyle.// --Dr. ████
