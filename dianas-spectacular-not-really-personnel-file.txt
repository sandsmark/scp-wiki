###ff99c8|**Item#:** SCP-Berry##

###ff99c8|**Object Class:** Lesbian##

###ff99c8|**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-Berry is to be contained in an average bedroom. She is also not to be writing author pages for she is terrible at it and not creative. As long as Diana has water and   [[[https://www.vaseline.com/us/en|vaseline]]], she probably won’t complain.##

###ff99c8|**Description:** SCP-Berry is a homosexual female in her late teens. Her anomaly manifests in her ability to be really fucking sensitive. What she creates is often inspired by her feelings and/or view on the world. She enjoys looking at things differently, and looking at things in a unique perspective. Well she thinks it’s unique. It’s not lol.##

###ff99c8|SCP-Berry is actually a researcher, but her author page anomalously manifests in the form of a fake SCP document.##

###ff99c8|SCP-Berry is very girly. She wears skirts, dresses, and flower crowns. One crown of which she made herself. It is unknown how it was put together. --her mom totally did not glue it together because SCP-Berry hates hot glue.-- Despite this, SCP-Berry has a love for horror and weird things. Horror in an interesting use is her favorite. Her favorite GoI is [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/dr-wondertainment-hub|Dr-Wondertainment]]], which is where the rumor of a tattoo reading "Diana Berry, from Little Misters ® by Dr. Wondertainment" outside her left thigh came from. --SCP-Berry does not actually have this tattoo yet. This line was just for the fun of the article.--##

> ###ff99c8|**Addendum-1:**##
>
> ###ff99c8| SCP-Berry has created an author page after specifically being instructed not to by her anxiety.##

###ff99c8|Hello! Thought I should give a little hello. My name is Researcher Diana Berry! The first tab is an anomaly. I’ve tried to type it normally, but it just gives me this note:##

> **Dr Wondertainment’s Wonderfy Yourself!**
>
>
> Hey kids and pathetic teenagers/adults! Ever wanted to know what it was like to be a Wondertainment product? An SCP to be exact? Well now you can! You don’t have to look for Dr Wondertainment’s Wonderfy Yourself code, it’ll find you! Happy expressing yourself!
>
> [[size xx-small]]Dr Wondertainment’s Wonderfy Yourself code may cause side effects in those fifteen or older. Side effects include: Being obsessed with stuffed animals, a cryptic weird cat that croaks instead of meows, loving the color pink, and other still we’re not gonna tell you about cause we’re a brand for kids get a life teenager!

###ff99c8|I dunno I thought it was kinda strange, but I didn’t question it.##

###ff99c8|On to real stuff now lol. My name is Diana! I’m quirky, weird, emotional, sensitive, a bunch of shit lol. I like all sorts of tv shows. I mean my taste ranges from Miraculous Ladybug to South Park to Criminal Minds. I’m interested in so many things it’s unreal. My brain never likes to stay in one place, and I guess that’s a good thing for this sort of site. My problem is having ideas but never knowing how to go about them, or how to develop them properly. This site is ridiculously hard to write for with all its guidelines and originality and stuff. How I even managed to get three successful pages is beyond me lol.##

###ff99c8|I constantly have new ideas. I have lots of my own stories and characters that don’t have to do with SCP. I’ve been creating since I was a kid. It’s my passion, it’s what I want to do in life. Create in some way. I’m real close to entering the real world, so I’m hoping I can enter it doing what I want to.##

###ff99c8|I want to help other people. I want to help people write, I want to help them with ideas. If you ever want your concept or draft for an scp, tale, GoI format, etc reviewed, just shoot me a PM and I’ll see if I can get to it/do anything for you. I’m not great at giving critique, but I guess I do know some things.##

###ff99c8|We’re allowed to get this personal on author pages, right?##

###ff99c8|**My GoI:**##

###ff99c8|My GoI is that of the Just Girly Things blog site, aka the pink monstrosity. (SCP-4319) It’s basically a blog site that brain washes girls to be stereotypical females. My main PoI is KeeLee, the creator of Just Girly things. If you’d like to write for JGT, feel free! (I’d love if you let me know tho :3 I could maybe even help you) I mean tbh, other SCPs could probably be managed from it honestly. But mostly I think tales is where it would be at. But I’m also considering working on a ‘sister’ profile thing that people could do their own of, like the Wilson’s adoption posters, or the Circus posters. Idk, just brainstorming honestly. Hoping to make something from it, but I’d be fine with it staying where it is because it’s at a good place currently. <3##

###ff99c8|This is where I’ll put information about my characters that I use in SCPs. Not SCPs, I mean like doctors and such. And I kinda have my own GoI as well. If you’re ever interested in writing an article for it, shoot me a pm and I’ll go over your idea.##
