I'm always open to collabing, especially if the concept has been sitting there unfinished.

##red|**DISCLAIMER: I feel the need to state once again that I DO NOT condone or agree with the views expressed by JGT. It's simply a commentary. They're horrible people, the only character's you're supposed to like is like maybe Jess cause she's super brainwashed, but idk hate her too. I 100% am not transphobic in any way, I am very supportive of the trans community. I do not agree with how JGT views women AT ALL. I don't EVER want anyone to think I agree with these horrible views. They're villains, and meant to be taken as such. I myself am very girly, clearly not in this way, but I tend to like to take things I like and see the opposite end of it. I like to step outside the boundaries, some people don't. I completely understand that, trust me. Nothing caused this, just my anxiety. I never meant for this to become a GoI, it just happened. I love you all and stay safe out there!**##

[[tab About Diana]]
Hi! My name is Diana! Nice to meet you! Lovely that you stumbled upon this weird page of mine. 

Object Class: Lesbian. 

This was a part of my old author page that I couldn't let die with the reformatting. 

I'm female, almost out of highschool, and awkward!  ♡〜٩( ˃́▿˂̀ )۶〜♡

My name is Diana (duh). I'm weird, emotional, sensitive, but I also like to consider myself smart and creative. I like all sorts of tv shows. I mean my taste ranges from Miraculous Ladybug to South Park to Criminal Minds. I’m interested in so many things it’s unreal. My brain never likes to stay in one place, and I guess that’s a good thing for this sort of site. My problem is having ideas but never knowing how to go about them, or how to develop them properly. But I suppose I got some right, huh?

I constantly have new ideas. I have lots of my own stories and characters that don’t have to do with SCP. I’ve been creating since I was a kid. It’s my passion, it’s what I want to do in life. Create in some way. I’m real close to entering the real world, so I’m hoping I can enter it doing what I want to.

I want to help other people. I want to help people write, I want to help them with ideas. If you ever want your concept or draft for an scp, tale, GoI format, etc reviewed, just shoot me a PM and I’ll see if I can get to it/do anything for you. I’m not great at giving critique, but I guess I do know some things.

**My strengths:** Light horror, psychology, real word problems, cute things, horror in weird ways, technology/AIs, history, some humanoids, some animals, wholesome stuff, cute bugs.

**Likes:** Short concept pitches, outside the box ideas, short drafts. 

I will mostly crit concepts, but sometimes I'll do drafts if I'm in the mood.

I suffer from [[[http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/page.php?ID=30|Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome]]], [[[https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcolepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20375497|narcolepsy]]], anemia, and moderate asthma. I won't talk about it a lot, but it does leave me disabled irl. If you have any questions about dysautonomia or narcolepsy or invisible illnesses in general, feel free to shoot me a pm.

**Social Media:**

[[[https://diana-berry.tumblr.com|My tumblr]]] This is just a side blog, but it's where I'll post SCP stuff.

[[[https://www.reddit.com/u/Berryberrybun/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf|My reddit]]] Small chance the link won't work. Anyways the name is Berryberrybun

Instagram- Curerosetta. Not quite sure how to link it. Anyways I don't really post SCP stuff there, it's just cats. I might post SCP art to my blog Ladyglitterbugs in the future, but idk.

Artbreeder- [[[https://artbreeder.com/dianaberry|DianaBerry]]]

I have other social media, but that's what I use the most so it's all I'm linking.

Oh and I've got an account on SCP amino --but I forgot what it's called-- and I don't really care because I hardly use it. It's called DianaBerry.
