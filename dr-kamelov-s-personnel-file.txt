**Full Name:** Dr. Ali Zamir Kamelov

**Security Clearance:** --Level 3--

**Location:** --Site 37--

**History:** Born in Tashkent in 1891, Dr. Kamelov attained multiple PhDs from Moscow State University including Theoretical Physics (1913), Biological Sciences (1915), and Art Theory (1922). In 1924, he was selected to join the fledgling Комитет по Исследованию Аномальных Явлений (Committee For The Investigation of Anomalous Phenomenon) as a junior researcher. Over the next decade , he rose to the rank of Assistant Chief Researcher for Central Asia. In 1934, Dr. Kamelov was recruited to the Foundation by Agent ██████.

Dr. Kamelov died on █/█/1966 during Containment Breach █-█-███ at Site 37. Although initially presumed to have been killed during the escape of SCP-████, autopsy reports revealed the cause of death as cardiac arrest. As none of the objects contained at Site 37 were known to affect cardio-vascular health, his death was ruled as "natural causes." As per his will, his personal effects and financial assets were incinerated "so that no one else can have them." His remains were shipped to Uzbekistan within twenty-four hours of his death, where they were interred at ████████ Cemetery in Tashkent. Due to the residue of over thirty years of daily chain-smoking, Dr. Kamelov's office was declared a Level Two chemohazard on ██/█/1966. Decontamination efforts continued until ██/█/1968, at which point the office was walled off.

--**Note:** Due to Dr. Kamelov's ongoing obsession with Lysenkoism and refusal to accept modern genetic theory, all reports with relevant information regarding genetics and/or evolution are to be edited by Junior Researcher Gaffney. Under no circumstances is Dr. Kamelov to be made aware of this arrangement.--
