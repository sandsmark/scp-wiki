[[/div]]
**Full Name:** Dr. Ali Zamir Kamelov

**Security Clearance:** Level 3

**Location:** Site 37

**History:** Born in Tashkent in 1901, Dr. Kamelov attained multiple PhDs from Moscow State University including Theoretical Physics (1926), Biological Sciences (1929), and Art Theory (1931). In 1934, he was selected to join the fledgling Комитет по Исследование ненормальное явление (Committee For The Investigation of Abnormal Phenomenon) as a junior researcher. Over the next decade and a half, he rose to the rank of Assistant Chief Researcher for Central Asia. In 1953, Dr. Kamelov defected to the Foundation, bringing with him several anomalous objects, including SCP-████, SCP-████, and SCP-████ (now neutralized).

**Note:** Due to Dr. Kamelov's ongoing obsession with Lysenkoism and refusal to accept modern genetic theory, all reports with relevant information regarding genetics and/or evolution are to be edited by Junior Researcher Gaffney. Under no circumstances is Dr. Kamelov to be made aware of this arrangement.
