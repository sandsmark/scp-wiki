[[/div]]
**Full Name:** Dr. Ali Zamir Kamelov

**Security Clearance:** --Level 3--

**Location:** --Site 37--

**History:** Born in Tashkent in 1891, Dr. Kamelov attained multiple PhDs from Moscow State University including Theoretical Physics (1913), Biological Sciences (1915), and Art Theory (1922). In 1924, he was selected to join the fledgling Комитет по Исследованию Аномальных Явлений (Committee For The Investigation of Anomalous Phenomenon) as a junior researcher. Over the next decade and a half, he rose to the rank of Assistant Chief Researcher for Central Asia. In 1938, Dr. Kamelov was recruited to the Foundation by Agent ██████.

Dr. Kamelov was killed on ██/█/1957 in Containment Breach █-█-███. Although initially presumed to have been killed during the escape of SCP-████, autopsy reports revealed the cause of death as a heart attack.

--**Note:** Due to Dr. Kamelov's ongoing obsession with Lysenkoism and refusal to accept modern genetic theory, all reports with relevant information regarding genetics and/or evolution are to be edited by Junior Researcher Gaffney. Under no circumstances is Dr. Kamelov to be made aware of this arrangement.--
