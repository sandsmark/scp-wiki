**31 October 2016 - Halloween**

**6 November 2016 - Daylight Saving Time Ends**
* For everyone living in a place that observes DST, it’s time to turn your clocks back! And contemplate the illusion of time, and for those of us who don’t turn the clock at all, some of us might be celebrating [[[SCP-2098 | Saint Simon’s Day]]] with [[*user Mulciber]] this year…

**21 November 2016 - World Hello Day**

++++ __December 2016:__
**13 December 2016 - World Violin Day**
* Let us honor the centuries-old string instrument with a tale of a rather curious violin. As [[*user Drewbear]] tells us, “play it well and keep the life of music flowing”. But is [[[SCP-1687 | the violin]]] really a lost Stradivarius, or rather, something more sinister?

**24 December 2016 - Christmas Eve**
* 'Tis the season! Think back on the 14th Annual Site-19 Senior Staff Christmas Eve Caroling, at the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/december-24th-2011-hub December 24th, 2011 Hub]. 

**31 December 2016 - New Year's Eve**
