**13 December 2016 - World Violin Day**
* Let us honor the centuries-old string instrument with a tale of a rather curious violin. As [[*user Drewbear]] tells us, “play it well and keep the life of music flowing”. But is [[[SCP-1687 | the violin]]] really a lost Stradivarius, or rather, something more sinister?

**24 December 2016 - Christmas Eve**
