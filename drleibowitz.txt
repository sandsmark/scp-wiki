Doctor Israel Leibowitz was born in San Diego, CA to Abram and Rachel Leibowitz on 30 June 1996. He studied science and theology at home until he was old enough to be put into public schooling. He showed great aptitude in the areas of math and science, and frequented the university libraries, especially those with rare book collections.

When he was in elementary school, Dr. Leibowitz began his studies into the occult, summoning his first entity at the age of 8, but only manifesting it for 45 minutes. After that event, he devoted himself fully to the paranormal and studied everything he could in the areas of demonology, theology, alchemy, and other forms of thaumatergical arts.

During middle school, Dr. Leibowitz became more reclusive in his work, disappearing for long periods of time. One of our agents in the Wanderer's Library believe that he  was the one people during this time referred to as "The Boy Wanderer" or "The Little Librarian," which would mean that he discovered a way into the library by the time he was 12. The one known as "The Boy Wanderer" never really talked to many people about himself, so it is unclear weather these rumors are to be believed.

His high school career was even more sparse, often showing wildly swinging aptitudes in everything unrelated to chemistry or religion, which he always seemed consistently good at. The proponents of "The Boy Wanderer" theory, claim that this could be because he was switching on a regular basis with versions of himself from other timelines, although it is unclear why he would do this. It is worth noting at this point that Dr. Leibowitz himself seems wholly uninterested in discussing the possibility that he is "The Boy Wanderer," apparently finding the theory totally boring.

He went to college at the University of California at Berkley, where he continued his study of the paranormal while pursuing a degree in Chemistry. He frequently utilized the university library to acquire copies of rare alchemical books from around the world, under the guise of research.

In his professional career, Dr. Leibowitz spent much of his time off the radar, although it is known that sometime during this period of his life, he amassed contacts in the Serpant's Hand and the Are We Cool Yet? groups of interest. He seemed to have developed an addiction to cocaine during this time as well, but seems to be, otherwise, a model chemist. 

The next time his paranormal life appeared on the Foundation's radar was during an incident at his previous employer, CalChem Synthesis, where it was reported for about 45 minutes that a large squid appeared in the lab where Dr. Leibowitz was working, due to, according to witnesses, some sort of summoning ritual the doctor had preformed. When the Foundation dispatched agents to investigate, however, all the witnesses appeared to have been treated with a crude approximation of Class-C amnestics, selectively forgetting details relating to the event. The Foundation used mnestics on the individuals, which worked flawlessly, and discovered that during this time Dr. Leibowitz had found a method of producing amnestics of sufficient quality without the use of Y-909 compound.

Following the events of this incident, Dr. Leibowitz was approached and hired by the foundation.
