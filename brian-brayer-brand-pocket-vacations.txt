||~ Sender || Brian Brayer ||~ Recipient || Lana Fuentes||
|||||||| Oh my god you weren't kidding about this place! This lab is amazing! I mean the JMen were great but this place is a whole other level. I have a few new ideas I'd like to run by you later if you have a moment to stop by the office. I HAVE AN OFFICE NOW. Haha.||

||~ Sender || Lana Fuentes ||~ Recipient || Brian Brayer||
|||||||| That's fantastic to hear. I am actually out of the country for the moment, Jameson Kepler had an issue down in Bogota and I needed to handle it personally. We hired you for your ideas and that crazy enthusiasm so keep that up! Go ahead and produce a few of the base product so we can test the market first.||

PS: You know Jameson Kepler? Color me impressed. I, honest to god, almost went to work for Kepler Aerospace just on the strength of his reputation alone. Good luck with the trip!||

|||||||| LANA. BRAYER'S PRODUCT IS SELLING LIKE HOTCAKES. HAVE WE FIGURED OUT A WAY AROUND THE PRODUCTION BOTTLENECK? ||

||||||||~ Memo 35||
||||||||~ CM3SP/OPK97/8AM2Y ||
||~ Sender || Lana Fuentes ||~ Recipient || Hr'asm'Kal||
|||||||| The items are keyed in to an anomalous ability he possesses and we very much want to keep him working for the moment given the demand. I know we've been using floating pricing, but I think a drastic and permanent increase in price is reasonable at this point.  ||

|||||||| ABSOLUTELY. DONE. DEMAND IS RUNNING AHEAD OF OUR DATA COLLECTION BUT WE'LL INCREASE THE PRICE TO A MILLION DOLLARS FOR NOW. I'LL RE-EXAMINE LATER THIS MONTH TO SEE IF WE NEED FURTHER ADJUSTMENT. GREAT WORK GETTING THIS GUY IN, BY THE WAY. THIS IS THE KIND OF PRODUCT THAT CAN MAKE A CAREER AROUND HERE. ||

||~ Author || Brian Brayer ||~ Date || October 18th, 2016||
||||||||Hoboy. Each of these things drains me a little bit more. I can get the energy back but it takes a day or two. One of the sales people came down to brief me on how the object is being used and she said that Jameson Kepler came in yesterday and bought like 5 of these things at once for a family vacation. I can't believe he actually bought something I made! _
 _
Still. That's part of the problem. I can't make these multi-use cause once I pour my energy in that needs to be the end of my contribution (and Lana says the sales would eventually taper off if they were reusable anyway). What I needed was a balanced in-between option. _
 _
I figured out how to make these things stay open for multiple family members. Anyone in the room that shares the same recent heritage as the activator will get transported along with them. It's not perfect, obviously, but I think it's a good solution for the moment.||

|||||||||| We are entertaining several special requests from buyers. I've contacted Brian about them and he says most of them are doable. The first one was Mr. Kepler. He's bought both the single use and family version before. He says he wants two of the original design that only worked for one person. He's willing to pay us like it's a family version so I directed Brian to make them. _
 _
Once Brian's done we'll start working on the remainder of the special requests. I'm going to figure out a way to get special requests into the production chain without spoiling the process too much.||
