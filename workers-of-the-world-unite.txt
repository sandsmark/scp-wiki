[[tab My Thoughts]]
* [[[SCP-2339]]] - This was the first piece of writing I published to the site, and I'm still very happy with it. It's about bees that play music, nothing more, nothing less. I came up with the idea after imagining a bee playing a set of tiny drums, then lots of bees playing one big drum, then an orchestra... I wrote it in less than a day, which I'm quite happy with.

* [[[SCP-2594]]] - The idea for this skip came after I realised we had a lot of infinitely large extra-dimensional skips, but not many that were finite let alone a single room. Coupling this with the dread that is liminal spaces and waiting rooms, I threw together a quick draft- but it wasn't very good, so I decided to collab with Roget, who really made it what it is. 

* [[[SCP-3250]]] - My second highest rated article, and the --only-- first one over 200, it's basically about KFC Jesus. The idea came, predictably, from a JFC/KFC misspelling, leading to the idea... which minmin and I liked so much we decided to collaborate on it. It went well!

* [[[SCP-3377]]] - I can't remember where the idea for this one came from, but I liked having an entirely hypothetical anomaly that the Foundation can't quite figure out, but know how to make it work. So there you go.

* [http://www.scp-wiki.net/broekken-gued Brökkën Güd] - My one and only tale, born from the frustration of assembling a flat-pack bed with multiple faulty parts and frustrating instructions (no, it wasn't actually from that store). I had a dumb idea about the Broken God being assembled like this... so wrote this tale, which turned out well. 

* [[[lily-s-proposal | SCP-001]]] - Inspired by Malvina Reynolds, and her song 'The World's Gone Beautiful'. SCP-001 doesn't have to be long. Sometimes short is enough. Currently my highest rated piece.

* [[[SCP-4567]]] - No great story behind this one, just at nice idea I had after taking the picture one day. My first Series 5 article.
