**Item #**: SCP-4000

**Object Class**: Safe

**Special Containment Procedures**: Due to SCP-4000's unwillingness or inability to appear before more than one person at a time, in addition to the subsequent and immediate death of any who witness it firsthand, SCP-4000 is effectively self-containing. Any reports of SCP-4000 manifestations captured by security camera feeds, photographs, or similar are to be investigated, and the media confiscated for analysis. All secondhand witnesses among the civilian populace are to be amnesticized.

**Description**: SCP-4000 is a humanoid entity, visually resembling a middle-aged Caucasian male in a dark-colored suit. Due to the rarity of recorded manifestation events and the specific circumstances in which they occur, little data concerning its nature or intent is available. Its behavior in all recovered sightings is consistent, however, with little to no deviation between appearances.

SCP-4000 will manifest in the presence of only one human person. All subjects recorded to date have been in terminally poor health, critically injured, or on their deathbeds, with SCP-4000 appearing nearby and within sight of the individual not more than 20 minutes before their expiration. SCP-4000 will only appear if the subject is conscious and alone. It will not appear if the subject is comatose, asleep, or unconscious; nor will it appear if they are being cared for by, in the company of, or otherwise being directly observed by another person. 

Upon manifestation, the entity will seat itself directly adjacent to the subject's bed, if such furniture is available. If not, it will remain standing or sit on the floor/ground in whatever configuration will allow it direct physical access to the subject without causing disturbance. Once situated, it will remove a pack of cigarettes from its left inside jacket pocket and offer one to the subject. If the subject accepts, SCP-4000 will place it between their lips, remove one for itself, and light both. If the subject declines, SCP-4000 will light and smoke the cigarette instead. The entity will make physical contact with the subject, typically via holding their hand, placing its hand atop theirs, or resting its hand on their shoulder. 

SCP-4000 will then remain with the subject, silent and unmoving, until they have passed away.

No subject thus far has been seen to recoil from or otherwise resist the entity, nor have any attempted to engage it in conversation, despite multiple instances of subjects acknowledging the entity's presence via eye contact, adjusting posture to reciprocate or facilitate the entity's touch, breaking into tears when noticing its presence, or verbally thanking the entity when offered a cigarette.

Individuals affected by SCP-4000 share a number of common attributes. Research into identified subjects has indicated that SCP-4000 is more likely to appear if an individual:

* is unmarried or otherwise lacks a significant other
* lives alone
* is nonreligious
* is impoverished or homeless
* displays a history of mental illness
* has no criminal record, or has never been convicted of a violent crime
* has no currently surviving family
* has little to no social standing in their community
* does not exhibit any record of significant professional or personal accomplishments,

or exhibits qualities and life history that have rendered the individual nondescript, anonymous, or otherwise unnoticed or insignificant by the standards of their respective society.

SCP-4000 has not been seen to engage in any other activity or behavior, and demanifests immediately upon the subject's death. The subject's cigarette, however, will remain, providing the only physical evidence of SCP-4000's presence.

No testing involving SCP-4000 has been authorized or attempted, due to available data indicating that observation of a subject precludes its manifestation, as well as ethical concerns.

**Discovery**: SCP-4000 was initially discovered as the result of its status as an urban legend, with footage of the entity appearing on hospital security cameras worldwide being disseminated via the Internet and various television programs. A minor disinformation program was put into effect to maintain this public image, and SCP-4000 was officially registered on November 27th, 1998.

Additional research and cross-referencing with accounts of similar phenomena have indicated that while concrete evidence of SCP-4000 appearances has become more commonplace due to the advent of photography and video recordings in the modern era, writings and depictions of a figure exhibiting similar behavior and physical resemblance exist throughout global history, culture, and mythology, with some accounts being thousands of years old. 

This includes certain references to and representations of mythical figures such as the Grim Reaper, Charon, the Ankou, and various other psychopomps and anthropomorphic personifications of the concept of death. Multiple cuneiform inscriptions on recovered Assyrian tablets dating to 2500 BCE reference an unnamed minor deity referred to as “the last visitor”, “the warden in the smoke”, or “he who watches over”, alongside crude figures resembling SCP-4000. 

A pre-Neolithic archaeological site discovered in southern France in 2017 includes a series of cave paintings, one of which prominently depicts a dark humanoid figure composed of distinct shapes reminiscent of the pattern of SCP-4000's suit, with a contour resembling a lit and smoking cigarette on one side of its head, standing over a more typical human analogue in a position of repose.

It is not currently understood how pre-modern cultures would have been capable of detecting SCP-4000. Investigation into this phenomenon, and SCP-4000's apparent omnipresence across human history and culture, is ongoing.
