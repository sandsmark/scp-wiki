    **Item #:** SCP-023

    **Object Class:** Euclid

    **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-023 is to be contained in a walled-off intersection of two (2) corridors at Site ██, with at least three (3) meters of space in each direction, and dummy doors at three (3) of the four (4) ends in addition to the real door, to give an illusion of the possibility of people walking through the intersection. There are to be security cameras above all four (4) doors, pointing down the hallways. 

SCP-023 does not need to eat, and no food is to be provided for it.

At all times, SCP-023's eye sockets are to be filled with spherical inserts made of hard rubber. Eye inserts must be replaced as they degrade. Degradation can be monitored by measuring the brightness of the "burning" effect as observed by security footage. Brightness lower than ██ candela is indication of degradation sufficient to warrant replacement of inserts. Eye inserts may only be replaced at night, one at a time. Under no circumstances are non-D-class personnel to look directly at the eye sockets, whether or not they are filled.

Once a month, a pair of D-class personnel are to trim SCP-023's claws.

In light of [[[Incident 023-27]]], no glass or reflective surfaces, and no displays, monitors, or eyewear of any sort are permitted within 30 metres of SCP-023's cell, including monitors linked to the security cameras within its enclosure. Security personnel shall be placed at checkpoints in the halls around the cell to ensure this.


    **Description:** SCP-023 is a large, apparently genderless shaggy canine (1.5 metres at the shoulder) with black fur. --It has bright orange-red eyes and prominent teeth-- (see [[[Incident Report 023-26]]]). Research so far suggests that any human that makes eye contact with SCP-023 will die within the span of one (1) year. 

If not contained in a setting that at least superficially resembles a "crossroads", SCP-023 has displayed the ability to phase through walls to get to the nearest suitable location, leaving burns on all materials it passes through.

SCP-023 was first brought to the Foundation's attention when it attacked a church in ███████ while it was in session, killing █ civilians directly and an unknown number via eye contact. Mobile Task Force [REDACTED] was sent out to capture it, Class-B amnesiacs were administered to all witnesses, and the incident was covered up as a case of arson.

If SCP-023's eye sockets are empty, it will vanish during daylight hours, and reappear within 20 kilometers at the next nightfall. Objects placed in 023's eye sockets will glow a bright orange-red, and slowly break down. Of materials tested, synthetic polymers lasted longer on average than either wood or metal.

**Addendum 023-01**
SCP-023 broke containment on ██/██/████ by walking through its cell wall (Incident 023-01). SCP-023 was traced via scorch-marks left on the walls to the intersection of two (2) corridors elsewhere at Site ██. A quick folkloric check into SCP-023 confirmed that it prefers to appear at "crossroads". New containment cell built around SCP-023. Containment procedure updated. Dr. ████████ issued reprimand for negligence in research.

**Addendum 023-02**
SCP-023 has been responsible for the deaths of ███ personnel since it was first brought into containment on ██/██/████. It is unknown how many people have been killed by SCP-023 before it was contained.

███ personnel have looked into its eyes or seen [DATA EXPUNGED].
█ personnel have been set on fire by SCP-023 passing through them.
██ personnel have been bitten and/or clawed to death by SCP-023.

**Addendum 023-03:**

Request for reclassification to Keter pending.

**Addendum 023-04:**
It has come to our attention that SCP-023's containment cell completely blocks off an archive of expense reports from the 19██s. A portion of the wall furthest away from the containment cell is scheduled to be taken down on ██/██/████ so that these documents may be moved to another location.
