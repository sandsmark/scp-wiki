    **Item #:** SCP-023

    **Object Class:** Euclid

    **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-023 is to be contained in a walled-off intersection of two (2) corridors at Site ██, with at least three (3) meters of space in each direction, and false doors at three (3) of the four (4) ends, in addition to the real door. There are to be security cameras above all four (4) doors, pointing down the hallways.  

At all times, SCP-023's eye sockets are to be filled with spherical inserts made of hard rubber. Eye inserts must be replaced as they degrade. Degradation can be monitored by measuring the brightness of the "burning" effect as observed by security footage. Brightness greater than ██ candela requires that the inserts be replaced with twelve (12) hours. Eye inserts are only to be replaced, individually, and only after the sun has completely set. Personnel are not to look directly into eye sockets of SCP-023 at any time.

Following [[[Incident 023-27]]] all reflective surfaces including displays, monitors, and eye-wear of any sort are not permitted within 30 meters of SCP-023's cell. This includes monitors linked to security cameras within its enclosure. Security personnel posted at checkpoints outside both corridors are to enforce this measure.

    **Description:** SCP-023 is a large, apparently genderless shaggy canine (1.5 meters at the shoulder) with black fur. --It has bright orange-red eyes and prominent teeth-- (see [[[Incident Report 023-26]]]). Research has shown that any individual that makes eye contact with SCP-023 will die exactly one (1) year after eye contact is broken. Autopsies of the deceased show that, while outwardly appearing unharmed, their remains have been 'filled in' with highly compacted ash, including but not limited to all organ systems and the circulatory system. 

If not contained in a setting that at least superficially resembles a "crossroads", SCP-023 has displayed the ability to phase through walls to get to the nearest suitable location, leaving burns on all materials it passes through.

SCP-023 was first brought to the Foundation's attention when it attacked a church in ███████ while it was in session, killing █ civilians directly and an unknown number via eye contact. Mobile Task Force [REDACTED] was sent out to capture it, Class-B amnesiacs were administered to all witnesses, and the incident was covered up as a case of arson.

If both SCP-023's eye sockets are empty, it will vanish during daylight hours, and reappear within 20 kilometers at the next nightfall. Objects placed in 023's eye sockets will be permeated by a bright orange-red that will increase in intensity as more and more of the object is reduced to ash. Synthetic polymers lasted longer on average than either wood or metal in testing, and are now the standard material to be used in filling 023's eye sockets.

**Addendum 023-01**
SCP-023 has been recorded vanishing for roughly one (1) second from its containment area numerous times. Each instance of disappearance so far has corresponded with the death of an individual, which, in the cases in which examination was possible, were shown to have died in the manner unique to victims of SCP-023.

**Addendum 023-02**
SCP-023 broke containment on ██/██/████ by passing through its cell wall (Incident 023-01). SCP-023 was discovered at the intersection of two (2) corridors elsewhere on Site ██. Agent █████ noted SCP-023's similarity to a [REDACTED]. A new containment cell was erected surrounding SCP-023's location and the Special Containment Procedures for 023 were updated. Dr. ████████ was issued a reprimand for negligence in research.

**Addendum 023-03**
SCP-023 has been responsible for the deaths of ███ personnel since it was first brought into containment on ██/██/████. 

**Addendum 023-04:**
Request for reclassification to Keter pending.
