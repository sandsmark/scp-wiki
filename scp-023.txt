    **Item #:** SCP-023

    **Object Class:** Euclid

    **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-023 is to be contained in a walled-off intersection of two (2) corridors at Site ██, with at least three (3) meters of space in each direction, and false doors at three (3) of the four (4) ends, in addition to the real door. Security cameras will be placed, and maintained above all four (4) doors. 

At all times, SCP-023's eye sockets are to be filled with spherical inserts made of hard rubber. Eye inserts must be replaced as they degrade. Degradation can be monitored by measuring the brightness of the "burning" effect as observed by security footage. Brightness greater than ██ candela requires that the inserts be replaced with twelve (12) hours. Eye inserts are only to be replaced, individually, and only after the sun has completely set. Personnel are not to look directly into eye sockets of SCP-023 at any time.

Following [[[Incident 023-27]]] all reflective surfaces including displays, monitors, and eye-wear of any sort are not permitted within 30 meters of SCP-023's cell. This includes monitors linked to security cameras within its enclosure. Security personnel posted at checkpoints outside both corridors will enforce, and adhere to this measure.

    **Description:** SCP-023 is a large, apparently genderless shaggy canine (1.5 meters at the shoulder) with black fur. --It has bright orange-red eyes and prominent teeth-- (see [[[Incident Report 023-26]]]). Research has shown that any individual that makes eye contact with SCP-023 will die exactly one (1) year after eye contact is broken. Autopsies of the deceased show that, while outwardly appearing unharmed, their remains have been 'filled in' with highly compacted ash, including but not limited to all organ systems and the circulatory system. Muscle tissue, bones, and brain tissue universally show signs of exposure to temperatures above ██ °C.

If not contained in a setting that at least superficially resembles a "crossroads", SCP-023 will phase through walls to get to the nearest suitable location, incinerating all materials it passes through.

SCP-023 was first brought to the Foundation's attention when it attacked a church in ███████ while it was in session, killing █ civilians directly and an unknown number via eye contact. Following retrieval, Class-B amnesiacs were administered to all witnesses, and living victims. The incident was covered up as a case of arson.

**Addendum 023-001**
SCP-023 broke containment on ██/██/████ by passing through its cell wall (Incident 023-01). SCP-023 was discovered at the intersection of two (2) corridors elsewhere on Site ██. Agent █████ noted SCP-023's similarity to a [REDACTED]. Special Containment Procedures for 023 updated. Assistant Researcher ███████ issued a reprimand for negligence.

**Addendum 023-002**
SCP-023 has been responsible for the deaths of ███ personnel since it was first brought into containment on 10/12/██94. 

**Addendum 023-003:**
Request for reclassification to Keter pending.
