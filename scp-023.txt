    **Item #:** SCP-023

    **Object Class:** Euclid

    **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-023 is to be contained in a walled-off intersection of two corridors at Site ██, with at least three meters of space in each direction, and dummy doors at three of the four ends in addition to the real door, to give an illusion of the possibility of people walking through the intersection. There are to be security cameras above all four doors, pointing down the hallways. 
SCP-023 does not need to eat, and no food is to be provided for it.

At all times, SCP-023's eye sockets are to be filled with spherical inserts made of hard rubber. Eye inserts must be replaced as they degrade. Degradation can be monitored by measuring the brightness of the "burning" effect as observed by security footage. Brightness lower than ██ candela is indication of degradation sufficient to warrant replacement of inserts. Eye inserts may only be replaced at night, one at a time. Under no circumstances are non-D-class personnel to look directly at the eye sockets, whether or not they are filled.

Once a month, a pair of D-class personnel are to trim SCP-023's claws.

In light of [[[Incident 023-27]]], no glass or reflective surfaces, and no displays, monitors, or eyewear of any sort are permitted within 30 metres of SCP-023's cell, including monitors linked to the security cameras within its enclosure. Security personnel shall be placed at checkpoints in the halls around the cell to ensure this.


    **Description:** SCP-023 is a large, apparently genderless shaggy canine (1.5 metres at the shoulder) with black fur. --It has bright orange-red eyes and prominent teeth-- (see [[[Incident Report 023-26]]]). Research so far suggests that any human that makes eye contact with SCP-023 will die within the span of one year.

If SCP-023's eye sockets are empty, it will vanish during daylight hours, and reappear within 20 kilometers at the next nightfall. When filled, whatever is in 023's eye sockets will glow a bright orange-red.

**Addendum 023-01:**

Request for reclassification to Keter pending.

**Addendum 023-02:**
It has come to our attention that SCP-023's containment cell completely blocks off an archive of expense reports from the 19██s. A portion of the wall furthest away from the containment cell is scheduled to be taken down on ██/██/████ so that these documents may be moved to another location.
