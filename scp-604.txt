**Object:**  SCP-604

**Item Class:**  Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-604 consists of a set of objects; but this is only for conveniences sake because of the fact that they share similar traits and origins; they can be separated from each other without harm done.  This is a policy that has a low probability of being enacted however;  human problems associated with 604 make the procedure of guarding each object separately too large a drain of resources. Due to fact that SCP-604 is wanted by other groups of interest, particular Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd., which it was retrieved from, it's cell requires heavy guarding, with a focus on infiltration and outside attack, as is procedure in circumstances like this. Currently, is is kept at an undisclosed location.

Remember, any personnel found consorting with the enemy or selling secrets are viable for instantaneous termination.

**Description:**  SCP-604 is a set of tableware and dishes (19 plates of various sizes and designs, and 21 cups; some goblets, other wineglasses)  Several are ornately gilded, studded with diamonds and rubies, or made out of fine materials such as porcelain and china.  Most are extremely heavy, because of the weight of the rich metals.  The cutlery, cloth, chairs, table, and everything else that made up the banquet where SCP-604 was discovered have no anomalous properties.

Whenever an edible solid is placed onto one of the plates or an liquid is poured into one of the drink vessels, the food will transform into human flesh, or the nearest equivalent organ, body part, or fluid.  The change from one product to another seems to be based on similarities between color, smell, and composition, although vague symbolism and mental associations seem to be occasionally involved as well.  For example, fleshy steaks will turn into cuts from the thigh, and red wine or juices into human blood (this is the most frequent use). Because the plates are not big enough in diameter and circumference to create an entire form, most pieces manifest as human infant parts; chicken wings as tiny burnt infant arms, excreta excreta.  However, adult chunks do appear occasionally, often when the beginning meat is placed vertically, sticking into the air.  Based on analysis on the captured videos and logs, this is how longer, more mature parts where designed, although the plate's products seem only to be able to project beyond the surface straight up at a limit of one meter (around 3 feet).  Vegetables, and non animal objects are effected as well, but when mixed together, inevitably every time, meat is altered, and everything else is left the same.  This means prepared meat will retrain the herbs, spices, topping, sauces, and garnishes as it is transformed into human flesh.  More then one piece of meat can be placed on SCP-604, but the results are varied; either creating separate pieces, incorporating them all together into one body system based on similarities in appearance (eggs and thin slices turning into an female reproductive system, a pile of pig intestines and a cow stomach melding together to form a digestive) or choosing one to focus on, and leaving all the others untouched.

It has been deemed fairly obvious why Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. employed SCP-604 at some of their more exotic auctions, performances, functions and dinners, during the meal portion.  The likely reasoning behind it, supported by direct quotes, was that it was "an once in a life time event" and those attending were urged to partake in the cannibalism "for experiences sake; so you can brag to your friends about it" in much the same manner adventure clubs offered bizarre meals such caramelized bugs.  The taste and novelty of the flesh was so popular that it was declared an "exhibit" by The Directors of MCD which in their terminology means that it was to be kept in one place remaining stationary, never to be sold, and the site visited only for the sake of that one item.  The highly exclusive restaurant were it was located was called "The Cannibal's Banquet" and {DATA EXPUNGED}

The other unique ability that SCP-604 possesses is any living creature placed on it's surface (or enmeshed inside water contained within a goblet) will metamorphisize into a moving human body part.  Even though it is biologically impossible, as many are severed yet do not bleed, and are not connected to any muscles or nerves yet are quiet active, as long as the piece could be moved while attached, in it's normal whole form, it will be capable of kinetic activity, such as flexing, as in the case of a starfish that turned into a six fingered baby's hand that opened and closed, and grasped at touch, or locomotion, no matter how awkward and slow it is.  (they will move in the typical way expected of a separated limb , such as inching and crawling forward by curling and extending their "body" as the moving finger with an extremely long nail generated from a lobster did, or the floating penis in a large goblet did to "swim"; it's tip jerking up and down to allow it to propel forward, even though no increased flow that could cause such a thing was possible)  If not, the flesh will simply squirm and jiggle, remaining slightly warm to the touch.   A pulse can be detected, even when the object in question is not hooked up to a heart.  These creations will continue existing until consumed, removed from the plate for a long period of time, or expiring from shock and pain, as many seem to freeze and go into a catatonic state similar to shock when stabbed or bitten into.

As living foods were in great demand, Marshall, Carter, and Dark owned many advanced cooking and zoological facilities.  Kittens and special breeds of tiny monkey where used for child creation.  When larger parts where desired guillotines were situated directly over SCP-604, as most parts continue vital signs a few seconds after removal.  Certain specimens were also raised from birth in special cramped cages, mostly cats, their bones molded to grow in a certain way, and kept alive crushed in specific outlines by specialists employing feeding tubes and electric hookups, so MCD could dictate exactly what size and shape the results would be.

**Acquisition:**  SCP-604 was acquired by MCD operatives sometime in the year ████.  According to records it was removed against its owners will from a secluded abbey somewhere in the ███████ ████ countryside.  The monastery and the surrounding village took the rites of communion literally, and consumed human flesh and blood, proverbially Jesus of Nazareth's by placing wafers onto the plates situated on the main alter, and drinking blood from the goblets.  The wafers were described to have a "light spongy taste" and both manifestations caused extreme religious ecstasy when eaten and hallucinations of the smiling Christian God lovingly offering his body, quoting relative scriptural pertaining to the event, and speaking intimately of their sins and tribulations.  It is unknown if at this time SCP-604 possessed its other abilities, even anything beyond effecting wafers and wine, as it was only used in these instances, before its robbery.

**Log SCP-604-07** 

> Unidentified voice:  Note: it is unknown if Curio B-26 could create sapient creatures.  When we finally successfully do get a living head, the mouth and eyes could simply start opening and closing randomly, and it would drool all over itself, or maybe, just maybe it would be perfectly intelligently.   I know some of our clients are definitely hoping, nay, fantasizing for the second option, and I have been instructed by The Directors to bring it about as best as I can.  I would like to remark that when we placed a snake, upright on plate seven, it did manifest as a human throat and the bottom part of a mouth, tongue intact and began screaming and shrieking.  But it was all incoherent, even though extremely loud and piecing, very annoying to, could hear it all across the building, so i just don't-

> 
> Head:  Oh jesus!  Oh god! gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!  GAAAAAAAAAAAH! They're all over!  They're AHHHHH!  GET THEM OFF!  FUCK!  JESUS! GET THE-  (it has been determined by analysis that at this point the head either began choking on some of the leeches, or it's tongue was covered and drained of blood)

> 
> (the human head is that of a man around thirty five, with thick black hair and sideburns.  He has extremely pale skin and dark circles under his eyes.  He is severed at the neck, which reveals muscle and a bloody hole.)
> 
> Head:  Where am i?  Who am i?!  What the hell is going-  (Begins looking around and turning up, down, and to the sides)  Everything seems at a weird angl-  hey what are you doing!  get that knife away from me!
