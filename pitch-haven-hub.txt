Pitch Haven follows the past, current, and afterlives of Foundation Agents Dr. Stuart Hayward and Agent Sarah Crowely. Assigned together as partners, they have dedicated their lives to locating and capturing all anomalous entities and objects in the Foundation's infamous Las Vegas branch, Site-45.

As they work together, both begin to realize that several hellish beings seem to have it in for them and, for reasons unknown, see them as loose ends standing in the way of whatever they are planning. Against their will, the two find themselves on the verge of discovering who, and more importantly, what, they really are.

**Sex:** Male
**Height:** 1.68 m
**Ethnicity:** English
**Original Profession:** Field agent
**Status:** [REDACTED] (188█-1998); possibly revived as SCP. If so, contained.

Personality type gamma (Γ); intelligent, committed, and mostly solitary, Dr. Stuart Hayward was recruited by the Foundation as a field agent after he graduated from ███ with a doctorate in literature.

[[f>image Freddie.jpg size="small"]]
++++ **[[[SCP-1913|SCP-1913-3]]] ("Fredrick/Freddie"):** ##white|(The Wolf) ◤・ｪ・◥##
**Sex:** Male
**Origin:** SCP-2746-1
**Role:** Crafter
**Note:** Contained

Personality type alpha (A). Fredrick, commonly referred to as Freddie, is an entity capable of self-detonation and rapid reconstruction. Fredrick is intuitive, brave, and at times, callous. It has the appearance of an adolescent black labrador retriever with no snout. Shows hostility towards personnel. It is theorized that Fredrick was previously a Brutus-Class Demiurge entity, and was under the title of 'King' of ████', but lost his title and advantages after Event Nachash.

Currently, Fredrick is trying to reach Agatha for 'family' reasons. Fredrick appears to have a positive relationship with Agatha, and does not appear to want to harm it. Fredrick's true goals are currently unknown, but expected to be of a malevolent nature.

[[f>image agatha.jpg size="small"]]
++++ **[[[SCP-1913|SCP-1913-1]]] ("Agatha"):** ##white|(The Porcelain Cat) ЖωЖ##
**Sex:** Presumed Female
**Origin:** SCP-2746-1
**Role:** Crafter
**Note:** Contained

Personality type sigma (Σ). Agatha, formally known as Agathos, is an entity contained within a ceramic cat statue filled with ink. Agatha is practical, manipulative, and an obsessive perfectionist. Shows disdain towards personnel. Along with Fredrick, Agatha presumed to have been a Brutus-Class Demiurge entity under the title of 'Queen of ███' prior to Event Nachash. 

Based on relevant documentation, Agatha's goals appear identical to those of Fredrick's, however, Agatha seems to have different motivations and methods of meeting these goals. It appears to be awaiting for an event before it comes into contact with Fredrick. It is possible that either Agatha has further anomalous properties, or she is awaiting outside assistance.

[[f>image Clovis.jpg size="small"]]
++++ **SCP-████-█/[[[SCP-1913|SCP-1913-2]]] ("Clovis"):** ##white|(The Black Rabbit) [ Oㅅ✖"]##
**Sex:** Presumed Female
**Origin:** SCP-2746-1
**Role:** Scholar
**Note:** Code Schrödinger

Personality type delta (Δ). Clovis is a Paolo class entity who appears to be either a hive mind-like entity spread over a variety of forms, or a series of duplicates consisting of at least one digital hive mind, and one uncontrolled physical body. Clovis is generally very cheerful towards personnel, and appears to show little resentment to the Maker, or humanity. Clovis also appears to be the driving force behind Fredrick and Agatha's plans. It is currently unknown why Clovis is allied with Fredrick and Agatha, as Clovis shares very few ideals with the two. Suspected relations to [[[SCP-1903]]].

The effectiveness in Clovis' current containment is unknown, and attempts are being made to determine if it also exists outside of containment.

+ Locations
----
[[f>image site45.png size="THUMBNAIL"]]
++++ **Site-45:**
Site-45 was established as a provisional measure for an abnormally high turnout of anomalous events in the Las Vegas district. Site-45 consists of three structures, Site-45-A, -B, and -C, which are connected through an underground monorail system and elevator.

Site-45-A was originally a standalone site under the guise of an office complex. It was originally built outside city limits in 190█, but as the city developed, Site-45-A became within city limits. Site-45-A has been re-purposed as a base for task forces and response teams, and for non-anomalous item storage. Barring permitted personnel with 1903 clearance or similar, SCP objects are no longer permitted.

Site-45-B is a newer building under the guise of a private mental care institution, which has been commissioned to provide housing, comfort, and entertainment to Site-45 personnel. Site-45-B has several recreational areas, such as rec-rooms, theater rooms for movies and shows, gyms and training rooms, restaurants, and an enclosed garden. Many residents are not allowed to leave Site-45 for varying reasons, so Site-45-B was built to simulate a small community; not just for anomalously affected personnel, but to provide heavy incentives for living on-site.

Site-45-C refers to the large subterranean research facility located 1.56 km underneath Site-45-B and approximately 220 km west of Site-45-A. Site-45-C is the workplace of the majority of Site-45 staff, and handles the research and containment of SCPs found in the area. Site-45-C specializes in researching anomalies with ties to various religions and mythologies, and includes a research staff consisting mainly of folklorists, anthropologists, neurologists, particle physicists, historians, sociologists, and linguists. Due to the site's large quantity of living and sapient objects, Site-45-C also houses a robust medical and psychiatric department. Site-45-C's 24th floor is inaccessible due to [[[SCP-1619]]].

[[f>image furylogo.png width="150px"]]
++++ **[[[SCP-2746|SCP-2746-1]]] ("████"):**
SCP-2746-1 is the suspected origin of the majority of anomalies contained at Site-45. SCP-2746-1 is an extradimensional forested area monitored by Site-45-A with a lack of any wildlife. SCP-2746-1 was inhabited by multiple demiurge entities of various strength, but were relocated after Event Nachash. SCP-2746-1 was completely abandoned approximately 200 years ago after the suicides of two remaining entities, S██████ and S███.

+ How to Add More
----
It comes highly recommended that you read every document in the 'Documentation' section before you write, and have your draft critiqued by [[*user Fantem]], in addition to other willing members and staff, but that aside, anyone can write for this project. Once you complete your writing and submit it normally, proceed to the Documentation section. Place your work on the bottom of the 'Published' list. Then, find where your piece fits on this project's timeline in the 'Chrono' section. Proceed to 'Listed'. SCPs are sorted by their number, and tales are sorted alphabetically at the bottom. Finally, go to the bottom graph and add a new column for yourself if you haven't already done so. List all your work in the order you submitted it. If you require assistance, contact [[*user Fantem]] through private message.

If you want to add more POIs or locations, be sure to include them in a couple SCPs or tales first; don't just add them because you want to. Don't forget to format their description like the others.
