|||||| Immediately upon completion of ritual, subject claimed to feel as though he discovered a missing part of himself. Subject left room to call Researcher ████████. Researcher ████████ and Researcher Michaelson now in a relationship. Researcher Michaelson's cell phone was rendered unusable after call to Researcher ████████. ||
||||||= **Post-Results Supervisor Notes** ||
|||||| //Fairly uneventful for the first test of SCP-2105. Bookshelf has been replaced as it was torn apart for items required for the ritual. After a short interview with Researcher Michaelson, he claims he had been contemplating asking Researcher ████████ out on a date. He also claims that the receipt, which he held in his back pocket for weeks, was a delivery receipt for pizza on the night his mother died. Michaelson claims he would not like to be involved in further testing. I suspect he experienced more than he is willing to tell me. Request to use Class-D subjects has been submitted. -- **Approved**// ||

||||||= **Results** ||
|||||| D-10984 did not perform ritual and removed back from wall during step 3. D-10984 has been terminated. ||
||||||= **Post-Results Supervisor Notes** ||
|||||| //When D-10984 removed his back from the wall, some sort of black rift formed behind him. Like peeling away the layers of an onion, each layer of D-10984 was pulled into the rift. First his epidermis, followed by his adipose tissue, followed by his musculature, etc. D-10984 showed no signs of distress the whole process. The black rift disappeared immediately following the consumption of D-10984's lymphatic system. Further research into what this black rift was should be performed, if possible.// ||

||||||= **SCP-2105 Parameters** ||
|| **Lethality:** No |||| **Ritual Type:** 5. Projection ||
||||||= **Preliminary Supervisor Notes** ||
|||||| //After the failure of D-10984, protocol regarding the rituals has been revised and made significantly more strict. D-993 has been instructed to read the ritual and repeat it back five times before he is allowed to proceed with the experiment. Additionally, further research into the other ritual types has been deemed necessary. As such, D-993 has been instructed to choose 5. Projection for this test. Room has also been furnished with a handful of new items for use in rituals. This includes: A dining room chair. A house key. Mid-sized pair of speakers. A box of 48 crayons. A love-seat couch. A standing lamp. _
Additional Notes on Subject: D-993 was chosen randomly from a pool of D Class meant for free experimentation. D-993 professes to have been treated poorly during her detainment with The Foundation but suggests the poor treatment came from other D Class personnel. D-993 is an average height, average weight middle aged woman.// ||

||||||= **Results** ||
|||||| D-993 was instantly transported away from Research Facility-12. Due to use of  ████████, D-993 was located 11 minutes later on the edge of the facility attempting to escape. ||
||||||= **Post-Results Supervisor Notes** ||
|||||| //The second D-993 put the plastic cone over her head, it looked as though she was quite literally sucked into the top of it. It reminded me of something I'd seen in a cartoon. Upon capture, D-993 insisted she had been gone for hours and would not divulge where she was was located for those hours. Because of this test, Projection has been determined an unsuitable type to use with D Class Personnel.// ||

|| **Name:** D-2129 and D-990 || **Date:** ██/██/████ || **Supervisor:** Dr. Forsyth [Clearance Level 3] with assistance by Dr. Marberry ||
||||||= **SCP-2105 Parameters** ||
|| **Lethality:** No |||| **Ritual Type:** 2. Summoning ||
||||||= **Preliminary Supervisor Notes** ||
|||||| //Due to the current unpredictable nature of SCP-2105 and of a Summoning Ritual possibly resulting in a XK class end-of-the-world scenario, Dr. Marberry is joining me in observation of Experiment-2105-α4. ["We can never be too careful." -O5-█] D-2129 and D-990 are familiar with each other, sharing the same domicile while in custody of The Foundation. D-2129 is a tall, muscular man of European descent. Previously administered Class A Amnestics, D-2129 has no memory of his life before acquisition by The Foundation. D-990 is a tall, diminutive man of Colombian descent. He claims to have known D-2129 before their capture. _

||||||= **Results** ||
|||||| --[REDACTED]-- -"I am sure this was unnecessary -O5-█" A mechanical creature of an equine nature //[researcher note: Dr. Marberry believes it bore a superficial resemblance to beings in [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-967 SCP-967]]// grew from D-2129's tendon. Lasting approximately 45 minutes, the creature spoke a language unfamiliar to both the subjects and the supervisors. The creature became increasingly more frustrated until it grabbed D-2129 and reverted back into the tendon. D-2129 reverted back with the creature, showing no signs of distress during the reversion.||
||||||= **Post-Results Supervisor Notes** ||
|||||| //D-2129 and D-990 were initially extremely reluctant to perform the ritual. While Subjects argued over whether or not to follow orders, objects were gathered for the ritual. Dr. Marberry located a pair of scissors on the floor above the observation room. Eventually, subjects agreed to perform the ritual citing "fear of known more than the unknown" as their reasoning. _
 _
The ritual itself was significantly more severe than past rituals. The tendon from the bottom of D-2129's foot had to be removed before the ritual. D-2129 was administered local anesthetic before Dr. Marberry surgically removed the tendon. Once, removed, the ritual began. Throughout the ritual, anomalous events occurred. _
 _
The first step adhered the heels of D-2129 and D-990 together. When the tendon of D-2129 was placed next to D-990's foot, it stretched, wrapping around the circle formed by the subjects' feet. When period key was placed into D-2129's eye, it fused with his existing eye, completely replacing it. During the time that the subjects stared into each other's eyes, the entire room morphed into a room Dr. Marberry recognized as a standard D Class dormitory. The observational window continued to exist, but surveillance video ceased as cameras merged with the walls. _
 _
Subsequently, D-990 picked up the scissors, moving mechanically and with much purpose. D-990 spoke out-loud: "Marching through the high of March, I found what I believed to be the cog that turned the world. But I was mistaken. It was not a cog, it was not made of any alloy found in this world. It did not turn the world, it consumed it." _
 _
D-990 then cut the stretched tendon which snapped back into place next to his foot. D-2129 then spoke: "It was me, I am the miraculous one that calls for you to answer me." The mechanical creature then grew from the tendon. A recording of the creature's speech has been submitted for analysis and Dr. Marberry is optimistic of its chances of being translated.// ||

||||||= **Results** ||
|||||| 500GB Hard drive formed extra parts and pieces, recognized as various parts from a Commodore VIC-20. Parts formed haphazardly around the object until a figure D-990 recognized as D-2129 was formed. D-990 and D-2129 conversed in the dialect spoken during Experiment-2105-α4, currently still unfamiliar to researchers. D-990 was then converted into parts from a Commodore VIC-20 as well. D-2129 and D-990 then escaped Room 382-C and together attempted to breach Observational Room 382-C. Both subjects were shown to be in much distress until Observational Room 382-C was breached and the subjects terminated both Dr. Forsyth and  Dr. Marberry. D-2129 and D-990 then reverted into a 500 GB Hard drive and a 750 GB Hard drive.  ||
||||||= **Post-Results Supervisor Notes** ||
|||||| //Notes by Researcher Michaelson: Due to Research Site-12 being lower security level, response to D-2129 and D-990's frenzy was delayed. When Response Team M82 responded to the alarm, they found Dr. Forsyth and Dr. Marberry cleanly dismembered with no signs of struggle. All wounds and lacerations were cleanly cauterized before blood-loss. 500 GB and 750 GB Hard drives were both found to be empty when connected to Room 382-C's computer.// ||
