++ **What is this?**

Ever wish you could find all the works featuring your favorite SCPs? Well, now you can! This is meant to be an easy way to access such content for fans, writers, and other interested parties. This is to be an ever-evolving list, so do feel free to add missing entries should you come across them. 

**Do's and Don'ts for inclusion:** 

[[collapsible show="IMPORTANT"]]
-----
**Do Include:** 

* Articles which directly star, prominently feature, or are otherwise about the SCP in question, even if it's only a single 'scene' or chapter on any given page.
* Articles which include the SCP for only a portion of the work in question, such as the Surgeon Crabs in the Bellerverse Canon Tale: [[[The List of Wonders]]], or the Illusory butterflies being heavily referenced/briefly appearing in the 17,000+ word Tale "[[[Portraits of Your Father]]]".
* Re-imaginings (such as [[[Probe-H9]]] for [[[SCP-087]]]) and different-canonical interpretations, even in cases where it's implicit (try to check discussion pages for "Word of God"[[footnote]]"Word of God" is a term which describes a creator's statement regarding their work. Here, this means "check discussion pages to see what the author says regarding spoilers/chacters/etc."[[/footnote]] in edge cases, if need be).
* Articles in which the SCP is heavily referenced, or has some significance; so long as its inclusion has some impact on the characters/narrative/what-have-you. (For example: [[[every-waking-hour-of-every-living-day|Every Breathing Minute of Every Waking Hour]]], a series of vignettes, focuses on personnel contending with various Foundation duties and situations. Though [[[SCP-231]]] does not actually appear in the article, its inclusion is quite significant for the section it's referenced in. 


**Do Not Include:**

* Works rated less than +10, or under one day in age.
* Supplement pages (works which have the SCP set as its parent page) should not be included for obvious reasons. This includes experiment/crosstest logs.
* Collaborative Tales (which have their own section)

**How-To's for inclusion:** 

[[collapsible show="IMPORTANT"]]

When an SCP has multiple entries, please attempt to order them by relevancy, if at all possible. So:

> The Tale is about the SCP ---> The SCP appears in this Tale --> The SCP is heavily referenced within the Tale --> The SCP is briefly alluded to within the Tale

It's not a hard-and-fast rule (one is not expected to read EVERY 173 tale to know where to slot the next one). This is merely a courtesy to readers. 

__When linking series:__ A link to the hub page or first chapter should suffice if the SCP in question appears in multiple entries or is central to the series. A link to individual Tales in a series should be used in cases where the SCP is focused on in a single chapter.

> (For instance. SCP-012 is the primary focus of the On Mount Golgotha canon, so I linked to the canon hub. SCP-339, on the other hand, is featured prominently in the On Mount Golgotha tale "An Impenitent Thief", so I linked that tale instead of the whole canon).

__Multiple SCPs:__ When there are multiple SCPs in a given work, it's fine to include the work under each SCP, not just one or two.


**Formatting entries:**

Tale entries should be nested underneath their respective SCPs, on a tier separate from the main bullet-points. Place a space before the asterisk to accomplish this. Tales should be in triple-brackets. If the url and the title of the page are different, the entry should have the url first, followed by a vertical bar, followed by the title.

For example:

> @@* [[[SCP-106]]] - The Old Man@@
> @@ * [[[The Young Man]]]@@
> 
> The Tale has a space before the asterisk, and is properly nested. The page title and the page url are the same, so the link is good.
> 
> @@* [[[SCP-359]]] - The Hawk@@
> @@ * [[[i-wanna-be-the-very-best|SCPokemon]]]@@
> 
> Here, the url and page title are different. This entry includes the url, followed by a vertical bar, followed by the page title. Another good link.

Parentheticals may be used next to individual submissions to further lend insight on contents (for example "(Poetry)" or "(Tale Series)". Please try to label adult content in this manner:

> [[[Tale]]] (Adult)
