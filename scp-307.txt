**Item #:** SCP-307

**Object Class:** Euclid/Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP-307 is to be kept within a stainless steel planter, measuring 1 square meter, within a hydroponic growth chamber equipped with remotely operated light and sprinkler.  The sides of the planter are to be equipped with retractable circular blades, the controls to which must be located outside the containment cell and manned at all times.  The hydroponic chamber is to be kept within a 5x5x3m room with stainless steel walls, floor, and ceiling.  There are to be no windows in the room - all light will come from the hydroponic grow light, and any observation of SCP-307 is to be done over a security camera.  The temperature of the room is to be kept at 15 degrees C to discourage seed production.

If entry to SCP-307's room is necessary, all personnel involved are to wear insulated full-body suits, and are to be armed with flamethrowers.  Under no circumstances is anyone to touch the hydroponic chamber except to make repairs.  If repairs become necessary, SCP-307 must first be sealed within a metal container large enough to contain the planter in its entirety.

If any specimens of SCP-307 are discovered outside the containment cell, they are to be burned immediately until only ashes remain.  Any personnel who touches SCP-307 must also be burned.

**Description:**

SCP-307 is a creeping vine, similar in appearance to the common English ivy //(Hedera helix),// save for the presence of greenish thorns on the stems, and the tendency of the leaves to exhibit a purple hue.  The vine puts down roots approximately every twelve (12) inches.  The roots can penetrate any porous material, but not metal.

SCP-307 appears to be carnivorous, and seems to exhibit some degree of intelligence (see Document 307-A).  When in the presence of a warm-blooded animal (hereafter referred to as "the victim"), it grows at a startlingly rapid rate in the direction of the animal, often growing three vines at a time in what appears to be a flaking maneuver.  Upon contact, SCP-307 appears to paralyze the victim, and then liquefy and drain all internal organs, musculature, and blood.  The mechanisms by which it does this are presently unknown.

SCP-307 was first discovered by Agent ██████████ in ████████, ████, where he witnessed it rapidly growing up the trunk of a tree and consuming a nest of American robins.  Further examination has revealed the prevalence of the plant throughout North America.    It has shown itself to be highly resistant to any attempts at poisoning.  This has included all commercially available herbicides, exposure to allelopathic plants, and formaldehyde.  Except for the sample obtained for study, the plant has been burned wherever it has been encountered - however, it is very likely that numerous specimens still exist outside of Foundation control.  SCP-307 is only kept alive in the hopes of engineering a biological agent to use on the wild population.
  
**Document #307-1:** Experiment logs

**Experiment 1:** █/██/████.  Tray of mealworms introduced to cell. 

**Result:** SCP showed no signs of movement.

**Experiment 2:** █/██/████.  Chilean rose-hair tarantula introduced. 

**Result:** SCP showed no signs of movement.  Did not respond when tarantula climbed onto SCP.

**Experiment 3:** █/██/████.  Live mouse introduced to cell. 

**Result:** SCP immediately began to grow in the direction of the mouse.  One vine extended directly towards it, while two more grew around and in front of it, effectively surrounding the mouse.  Mouse immediately became rigid and stopped moving upon contact with SCP-307.  Behavior continued for 26 seconds before mouse fell on its side, obviously dead.  Vines outside the planter were severed, allowing D-class personnel to collect mouse.  Upon retrieval, mouse was noted to appear to be lacking any anatomic structure beside skin and bones.  Mouse was taken for further examination.  Results pending.
