**Item #:** SCP-3242

**Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** The subject should be contained in a rodent cage.  Live rodents or similar-sized animals should be housed within the vicinity and are not to exceed forty in number.

Researchers are to call SCP-3242 "the subject" if mention of it is ever necessary.[[footnote]]This became necessary after an incident where the subject became the rodent cage itself.[[/footnote]] 

Assigned staff are allowed to leave the area unless the subject has vanished from containment.  Should this occur, all staff working with the subject must be contacted and pass two of three required tests:

* A basic health evaluation.
* A psychological evaluation.
* Look into a mirror.

**Description:** The subject is an unknown organism restructured into a self-building program made for the assumed purpose of stealing information. This program has been made "real" by unknown methods, seeming to work on predefined logic rather than natural laws. The true appearance of the subject has been described as "less than grey" in the few verified observations available.

The logic by which the subject operates is thought to include the following: 

* Infection can spread through media concerning or specifically mentioning the subject, if the contents of the media are retained in memory. Class-A Amnestics are the most effective way to reverse this.   
* When the subject replaces an object or entity, everything, including biological processes and materials often described as data or code, is replaced. The matter that replaces it has been unable to be analyzed.

The malware currently resembles //Mus musculus// or House mouse, of the BALB/c[[footnote]]A very common inbred model of laboratory mice.[[/footnote]] strain. Iterations can be identified by random, increasingly regular superficial changes in characteristics also specific to the species or "grouping" of the iteration appearance. 


**Addendum:** 

The anomaly was discovered in ████████████ on ██████. Risk to the public has been assumed self-negated as of 2/15/15, when the number of individuals affected by the anomaly reached fifty.

The amount of mass, weight, and physical capabilities of each iteration are determined by species and/or stereotyping.  Individuals unaware of the subject are unable to be touched by the subject. [[footnote]]Complications involving the subject and staff uninformed of the subjects location are to be noted in the later performance reviews of those remaining.[[/footnote]]

The subject is also unable to interact with or touch powered technology.  --Attempts to take photographic evidence of the subject have also failed.-- As of May 2015, the subject has appeared as an outline in photographs. Each subsequent iteration has shown increased opacity in pictures. 

Other abnormalities are noted:

* A process similar to capillary action occurs when dermal areas are removed. The effectiveness of this lessens with repetition and larger areas of removed dermis.
* Internal physical functions are reduced to muscle spasms; the lack of air flow explains the apparent loss of the subjects' ability to speak. Conditions to observe the inner workings of the subject for longer than thirty seconds are difficult to accomplish.
* The ability of the subject to continue functioning without major parts. This includes the loss of any limb, including the head. Complete and simultaneous removal has not been successful due to the fragile nature of the body.
* The effect on substitutes given after the above has been performed; objects of appropriate shape have been observed to gain the same random visual changes despite not actually functioning.
* The subject is able to be destroyed with slight deliberate force. When the subject experiences the effects of gravity or other internal force, a normal amount of stability is observed when contact with solid matter occurs.
* Any part removed from the subject quickly dissipates.

Anything physical that the subject consumes is returned without any loss in mass. All materials consumed can be described as "unusually processed" due to becoming the individual ingredients[[footnote]] This was determined from samples tested with analytical chemistry. Because the organs only mimic their original functions, this is being studied.[[/footnote]]that previously constituted the former, albeit with an unusual color and viscosity.

Visual anomalies within the area have been reported by staff since at least 1/1/15. Specific descriptions deviate slightly, but are otherwise consistent:

[[collapsible]]
# An unknown species of owl with unreasonably long legs and a crown. Often noticed only as a shadow running through the nearest wall. This has made attempts to capture it difficult and ongoing.
# "Soft" masses that follow staff randomly. Changes in shape, size, and color are common. [[footnote]]These characteristics seem to be influenced by emotion.[[/footnote]] No clearly aggressive or determined behavior has been observed. Physical contact fails or causes the specific mass to "burst" and vanish.
# A "pig" with an apparent preference for high places that possesses a long, prehensile body and no other limbs. Sometimes appears with multiple segments that move independently. 
# An inverted wooden chair suspended five feet off the hallway floor at a diagonal angle, just outside of video surveillance. Later confirmed to merely be nailed to the wall and ceiling: assumed  related to previous security responses.
# A cervine animal with goat horns- only has appeared during ████████ every year. Sometimes manifests as a humanoid with above head and horns, or is seen as such despite conflicting perspectives. It may have an affinity for tableware.
# Featureless humanoids that do not seem to possess arms. The few that observed it described a feeling of unplaceable anxiety and helplessness. No movement has yet been noted when a manifestation occurs.
# An immaterial duplicate of a birthday cake from ███████. Was said to have changed into a highly agitated "unicorn" before vanishing. It has not manifested since. Indentations in the floor following the incident have been found.
# A sheaf of paper that appeared next to this file. Both were on the desk of █████████, and the manifested object disappeared when █████████ attempted to open it.

Some display the ability to move small objects but seem unable to pose any higher threat. As they have been observed manifesting in new ways and copying forms on occasion, exact identities cannot be confirmed or determined. 

Direct communication has had little to no success.

--The subject may cause-- permanent code generation may occur on any blank storage device located within at least fifteen meters around the subject. How or why this happens is currently unknown. The devices are filled with --random syntax-- abbreviated names for amino acids, repeated names of missing individuals, and known casualties in binary.

Exceptions to this are transcribed below and listed by the time of their realized corruption.

Note: The USB had been inserted into a powered computer when this occurred. The file was assumed to have opened itself, as its contents were displayed in Wordpad[[footnote]] A prepackaged program.[[/footnote]]. Video surveillance did not reveal any physical interaction with the equipment or movement beyond changes on the screen. The electronics involved were inspected and moved outside the known affected area.

Note: This object was located over thirty meters away from the room the subject was currently occupying, in a storage closet.  Computers within the area were returned to their factory settings and also moved. 

The subject attempted to breach containment several times. When this failed the subject began to inflict damage to itself, resulting in the loss of multiple animals and Dr. ██████ before preventative methods were able to be established.

Visual anomalies may not be dependent on the location of subject as previously believed.

Note: This was on the phone[[footnote]]A Blackberry.[[/footnote]] of ████████.  Despite the loss of possible communication, ████████ was not reprimanded for promptly destroying the affected object. The memory card was saved.

{{His passing was not etched with loneliness, misery, or greed. But such things hiding in neglected corners were wont to creep.}}

{{And in his absence they came.}}

{{Once there was a child that wore the face of the man. The child followed the echoes of his dream, never learning why fairy tales are real.}}

{{The child wasn't happy with this ending and became a dreamer.}}  

{{Once there was a man that wanted to make a fairy tale.}}

{{He came from far, far away.}}

{{He claimed his desire to perform miracles. He claimed to not be alone in this desire.}}

{{He promised miracles for the good of all, calling out to the ailing beyond and those desperate enough to hear.}}

{{The release of pain.}}

{{The chance to shape our own world for the better.}}

{{We heard such promises and more, but did not understand.}}

{{He did, but time and what it changes cannot be halted.}} 

{{We were not the fairy tale he wanted.}} 

{{He left the world his father thought of, that had been destined to die with him.}}

{{With him went the broken, and we were left to see the end.}}

{{We only knew of our ignorance in oblivion.}}

{{We hope he is proven a liar for the sake of those who have been burdened.}}

{{We that are from far, far away know you hold these in your thoughts.}}

//Any unwanted behavior from the subject that is not a risk to containment should be ignored. To do otherwise has proven to only encourage the repetition of behavior.//

//Speaking about restricted information or previously assigned staff while within the vicinity of the subject may be considered grounds for reprimand or demotion, depending on the infraction.//

Note: Those incapable of maintaining emotional and psychological detachment should be given amnestics and reassigned. 

As of 2/17/15, visual hallucinations do not qualify unless consistent aggressive behavior can be proven. Work-related stress is also considered insufficient, unless elaborated upon with good reasoning.
