**Item #:** SCP-463

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-463 is to be maintained in the small glass display case within its containment cell at Site ██. If SCP-463 must be transported from its current location, it should be transported in its display case, or some other container. At no time should any Foundation researchers come into direct physical contact with SCP-463. Personnel are strongly discouraged from bringing food of any sort into SCP-463's cell.

**Description:** SCP-463 is a small silver spoon, approximately 17.5cm in length, with a mass of approximately 153g. Unless handled by a human, SCP-463 displays no abnormal behavior. X-ray analysis, MRI, and the [REDACTED] imaging system have revealed no detail to the inner structure. All analysis of SCP-463 is consequently limited to its directly observable effects.

Any individuals who pick up SCP-463 have their spines bent backwards at a 90^^o^^ angle, just below the T6 Thoracic vertebra. This bending typically proves fatal, although some test subjects have survived with full lower-body paralysis. Its effect on humans is displayed regardless of whether or not the subject is wearing gloves, oven mitts, or any other such barrier; the only apparent requirement for SCP-463 to be able to 'bend' its holder is that the subject have a firm grip. Subjects who have held SCP-463 very weakly (i.e. with just the tips of the fingers), have been unaffected.

Testing has demonstrated that SCP-463 displays no unusual effects when in contact with autonomous machines, remotely controlled machines, animals, or corpses. 

**Addendum 463-A:** As per the request of Dr. █████, any personnel engaged in direct or indirect contact with SCP-463 found imitating, quoting, or making jokes in the style of comedian Yakov Smirnoff are to be temporarily reassigned.

//Memo: In spite of the apparent comedy of SCP-463's effects, it is important that all researchers keep in mind the potential dangers posed by an SCP object. Not treating these artifacts with the required level of seriousness is only a few steps away from a particularly unfunny lunchroom prank. -Dr. █████//
