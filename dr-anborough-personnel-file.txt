title:Dr. Anborough's Personnel File
**Name:** Dr. Charles Anborough

**Security Clearance:** Level 4

**Location:** Site-59

**History:** Born ██/██/19██ in █████ ████, ██.  Former nuclear physicist at ███.  Recruited by the Foundation after one of his experiments accidentally transported himself and a portion of his laboratory to █████, France.  The anomalous event has not been reproduced.  Dr. Anborough is currently the director of Sites 59 & 117.

**Profile:** Dr. Anborough is 1.8 meters tall and weighs 81 kg.  He is currently in stable health but is hindered by a gunshot wound in his right calf.  To date, Anborough has given 45 different explanations for this injury.  The angle of impact on the wound, however, suggests that [DATA EXPUNGED][[footnote]] I did NOT accidentally shoot myself in the leg; stop interfering with my file, Adler.[[/footnote]].  Due to this disability, Anborough utilizes a crutch, and has been known to occasionally poke his subordinates with said implement.  Anborough possesses a notable dry wit and will often insist that works by Igor Stravinsky be played in his presence.  Due to this, Site-59 is stocked with multiple versions of "Petrushka", "The Rite of Spring", and "The Firebird Suite".

Hi, everyone!

This is for anyone who wants to know a little more about me.

I am 21 years old, male, and living in southern California.  I am currently attending California State University of Fullerton, where I am studying in English.  I have almost completed my Bachelor's in English, and am about to start on a Minor in Radio/TV/Film.  My favorite genre of fiction is fantasy.

I first got into horror fiction while playing Amnesia: the Dark Descent.  After that, I started reading Lovecraft, and in early 2013, my brother showed me SCP: Containment Breach.  I never actually played the game, but decided to look into the subject a little further, and discovered this site.  I joined in early April, and my work from that time on can be seen on the site.

My real name is not Anborough, my author avatar stems from a character I made up for an Amnesia custom story which I never made because I can't into programming.

--If anyone encounters me on the drafting forums (where I tend to show up most often), I'll tell you what to expect from me in a critique.--  I am, above all, ruthless on grammar and word usage.  Most of the issues I will be targeting are these things and tone.  My main words of advice?  Be.  Concise.  Use words that are the most accurate, objective, and don't use more words than necessary.  This is for the new users, obviously, I'm not trying to tell the older members how to write, as I ask them for feedback quite often (I've been a member of the Foundation for 7 weeks at the time of this writing).  I can, however, be of assistance to the newbies, and will try to be as often as possible.

Anyway, feel free to contact me by PM--, but I'm not on chat yet because I can't figure out IRC--.

Oh, one last thing.  If you're wondering about my critique insignia, it's a line from Two Best Friends Play LA Noire.

Anborough out.
