title:Dr. Anborough's Personnel File
**Name:** Dr. Charles Anborough

**Security Clearance:** Level 4

**Location:** Site-59

**History:** Born ██/██/19██ in █████ ████, ██.  Former nuclear physicist at ███.  Recruited by the Foundation after one of his experiments accidentally transported himself and a portion of his laboratory to █████, France.  The anomalous event has not been reproduced.  Dr. Anborough is currently the director of Sites 59 & 117.

**Profile:** Dr. Anborough is 1.8 meters tall and weighs 81 kg.  He is currently in stable health but is hindered by a gunshot wound in his right calf.  To date, Anborough has given 45 different explanations for this injury.  The angle of impact on the wound, however, suggests that [DATA EXPUNGED][[footnote]] I did NOT accidentally shoot myself in the leg; stop interfering with my file, Adler.[[/footnote]].  Due to this disability, Anborough utilizes a crutch, and has been known to occasionally poke his subordinates with said implement.  Anborough possesses a notable dry wit and will often insist that works by Igor Stravinsky be played in his presence.  Due to this, Site-59 is stocked with multiple versions of "Petrushka", "The Rite of Spring", and "The Firebird Suite".

__SCP Articles Authored__:

[[[SCP-1769|SCP-1769]]]: **The Beloved** My first and still favorite article: originally designed as a "hitting-too-close-to-home" commentary on internet addiction, the poetic elements really add another shade of personality to the anomaly.
[[[SCP-1428|SCP-1428]]]: **Jinwu** My first really successful article: inspired by a Yu-Gi-Oh card, this went through a lot of trial and error before it reached its current state, it's also where I learned how to collapsible.
[[[SCP-1734|SCP-1734]]]: **The Hole in the Deck** This is the first article where I actually considered what scared me before writing: I think the scariest part is wondering why the tentacle is dormant, given all the shit in the logs.
[[[SCP-1815|SCP-1815]]]: **A Mercurial Doppelganger** This one took three attempts and a ton of rewriting: it's directly inspired by Kalinin's The Iapetus Anomaly [736], employing the same methods of implication.
[[[SCP-1847|SCP-1847]]]: **The Rake** My first humanoid SCP: I would argue this is my second best article (mostly due to the implications of the last addendum), although the score suggests otherwise.
[[[SCP-1748|SCP-1748]]]: **The Dragon's Legacy** My first XK Scenario article: inspired by Reject's Disco Inferno [1969], this was supposed to be an attempt to give AWCY an XK device, although they had to be cut from the final version.
[[[SCP-1824|SCP-1824]]]: **A Mother's Son** My most unusual Keter: this was really just an attempt to make a really weird Keter, the additional backstory about my avatar's dad came later.
[[[SCP-1838|SCP-1838]]]: **Bob** My best article in my opinion: do not make Bob sad, give to Bob, and Bob will give to you for years and years to come.  We are all Bob, all and one, we are all Bob, Bob... 
[[[SCP-1518|SCP-1518]]]: **The Bubble Fountain** Huh?  What was I saying again?  Oh yeah, the fountain, my eeriest article, I think: in all honesty, I think the song is really the main feature.
[[[SCP-861|SCP-861]]]: **A Fallen Angel**[[footnote]] Collaborative work co-authored by Dexanote, originally posted by Far2, original author unknown. [[/footnote]] My first rewrite: This went through a very long drafting period, though I think the end result is satisfying, all in all a good rebirth to an old and failing article.
[[[SCP-1527|SCP-1527]]]: **Our Bellmaker, Our Radiant Skies** A Wanderer's Library tale in disguise (basically): all the meat here is in the interaction between the Serpent's Hand and the Foundation, and the clash of perceptions regarding anomalies.

Hi, everyone!

This is for anyone who wants to know a little more about me.

I am 21 years old, male, and living in southern California.  I am currently attending California State University of Fullerton, where I am studying in English.  I have almost completed my Bachelor's in English, and am about to start on a Minor in Radio/TV/Film.  My favorite genre of fiction is fantasy.

I first got into horror fiction while playing Amnesia: the Dark Descent.  After that, I started reading Lovecraft, and in early 2013, my brother showed me SCP: Containment Breach.  I never actually played the game, but decided to look into the subject a little further, and discovered this site.  I joined in early April, and my work from that time on can be seen on the site.

My real name is not Anborough, my author avatar stems from a character I made up for an Amnesia mod which I never made because...I can't program for shit.

If anyone encounters me on the drafting forums (where I tend to show up most often), I'll tell you what to expect from me in a critique.  I am, above all, ruthless on grammar and word usage.  Most of the issues I will be targeting are these things and tone.  My main words of advice?  Be.  Concise.  Use words that are the most accurate, objective, and don't use more words than necessary.  This is for the new users, obviously, I'm not trying to tell the older members how to write, as I ask them for feedback quite often (I've been a member of the Foundation for 7 weeks at the time of this writing).  I can, however, be of assistance to the newbies, and will try to be as often as possible.

Anyway, feel free to contact me by PM--, but I'm not on chat yet because I can't figure out IRC--.

Oh, one last thing.  If you're wondering about my critique insignia, it's a line from Two Best Friends Play LA Noire.

Anborough out.
