title:Dr. Anborough's Personnel File
**Name:** Dr. ███████ Anborough

**Security Clearance:** Level 3

**Location:** Site-59

**History:** Born ██/██/19██ in █████ ████, ██.  Former nuclear physicist at ███.  Recruited by the Foundation after one of his experiments accidentally transported himself and a portion of his laboratory to █████, France.  The anomalous event has not been reproduced.  Due to personnel shortage, Dr. Anborough is currently the acting supervisor of Site-59.

**Profile:** Dr. Anborough is 1.8 meters tall and weighs 81 kg.  He is currently in stable health but is hindered by a gunshot wound in his right calf.  To date, Anborough has given 45 different explanations for this injury.  The angle of impact on the wound, however, suggests that [DATA EXPUNGED][[footnote]] I did NOT accidentally shoot myself in the leg; stop interfering with my file, Adler.[[/footnote]].  Due to this disability, Anborough utilizes a crutch, and has been known to occasionally poke his subordinates with said implement.  Anborough possesses a notable dry wit and will often insist that works by Igor Stravinsky be played in his presence.  Due to this, Site-59 is stocked with multiple versions of "Petrushka", "The Rite of Spring", and "The Firebird Suite".
