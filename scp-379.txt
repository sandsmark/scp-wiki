**Item #:** SCP-379

**Object Class:** Safe/Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**
SCP-379 is to be kept in a green, mobile tacklebox, placed in storage room ST-████ at any time when not in use. When required, it may be transported by any Level 1 staff member to any location being used for experimentation purposes. It should be returned to ST-████ after being used.

**Description:**
SCP-379 is a clear liquid contained in a small, crystal bottle. The bottle is topped with a spritzer-styled lid which delivers approximately one-half (.5) mL of the clear substance inside the bottle.

The bottle itself has no noted properites of any particular interest. However, the liquid inside (while scentless and ineffective to normal human beings) has the strange effect of a state not unlike human infatuation on electronic systems and machines. When applied to a person, plant, object, or another machine, any machines or electronics in the vicinity (aside from any machine or electronic system wearing SCP-379) will begin running in an overheated state, unable to process as many commands but consuming more energy, and usually heating the unit at least five (5) degrees Fareinheit.

For cybornetic systems or computers deemed 'sentient', the target seems to exhibit more humanistic qualities of typical 'infatuation' including:

* A preference to be around\close to\in contact with the wearer of SCP-379.
* More willingness to cooperate with anyone in the room while the wearer of SCP-379 is present.
* Slower response times in machines.
* A slightly higher chance of glitches occuring during runtime.

It should be noted and of particular interest that humans seem entirely uneffected to SCP-379. In a test where a Level 1 staff member wearing SCP-379 entered the room of [[[SCP-808]]], 808 did not show any sign of change of any kind.

It has been suggested to expose aggressive SCPs like [[[SCP-228]]] to SCP-379 to see if the pheremone can reduce the aggressiveness and ease SCP-228 into answering more questions about its function and time period of origin. It has also been suggested to try SCP-379 on SCPs that are not mechanical but do not exist in our 3D, real-world state (as is the case of [[[SCP-085]]]) to see if the pheremone affects them; deemed unlikely.

There is no known reason as to how the sporting of SCP-379 affects most machines; SCP-379 does not release any sort of scent or actual pheromone into the air. It has been suggested that SCP-397 has an electromagnetic frequence of some sort, but tests have proven this theory inconclusive. Further tests are to be limited until chemical composition is established to determine if SCP-379 can be artificially replicated.
