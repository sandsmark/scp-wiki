[[tab About]]
The main reason I created this series was to finish what PeppersGhost started. He briefly mentioned a female Ringmaster in [[[SCP-2094]]], with the clear intention of setting up a further narrative that was never followed up on. PeppersGhost did have an overall arc he intended to tell with Herman Fuller, but this arc was left incomplete. In private e-mails with PeppersGhost he informed me of his overall plan for the Circus, and with his continued input I hope to complete it myself to the best of my ability.

Why do this? Well, I like the Circus partially because in some ways it's the exact opposite of the Foundation. When The Administrator found his first anomaly, he decided it was something to be locked up and kept secret forever. When Herman Fuller found his, he decided to pitch a tent and charge admission. My ideology towards the anomalous is actually closer to that of the Serpent's Hand's than it is to the Foundation's. Not everything anomalous is dangerous, and the Foundation's policy of locking every anomaly up 'just in case' is both immoral and to Humanity's detriment. One of my favourite SCPs is [[[scp-8900-ex |8900-EX]]] because it illustrates the Foundation's edict of preserving the status quo, even if changing the status quo would be a good thing. The Circus is a place where people can see actual magic, and where anomalous people have more freedom than they would in containment.

I also have a fondness for the early days of the Foundation; whacky senior staff, insane cross testing, etc. The Circus gives me a venue to write in that style that would otherwise not be acceptable. 

I will do my best to continue the story PeppersGhost started, and maybe one day the tale of Herman Fuller's Circus of the Disquieting will be known in its entirety.

I am proud to announce that Dread & Circuses is officially a Canon. If you're interested in contributing to Dread & Circuses and need feedback on anything just send a message to [[*user DrChandra]]. Fanart is also welcomed. 

For a more general sense of how to write for Dread and Circuses, I would like to quote the GoI page on tv tropes:

"**Circus of Fear:** Zig-Zagged. When the sadistic Fuller was in charge, the circus fully embraced this trope to the point of Card-Carrying Villain. In the post-Fuller era, while the circus's ethics are grey at best and it still lives up to the disquieting part of its name, it seems to have shifted significantly toward a Ragtag Bunch of Misfits just trying to make a living and show people a Creepy Awesome time."

Remember that. The Circus may be morally ambiguous and creepy as hell, but at its core it's a community of anomalies just trying to survive and find solidarity with each other. The Circus is Family, and Family stays together.

You should definitely read SCP-2094 since that's more or less the 'zig-zag' point. Motormouth provided a positive perspective on the Circus that is very different from PeppersGhost's four previous Circus scips.

Ideally, you should also read this entire series if you're going to write for it, but at the very least make sure you've read a tale that features the characters you're writing about. As with other Canons, everything should be relatively consistent.

Though my depiction of MC&D in this Canon is heavily inspired by Wills and Ways as well as Bloodbaths, Dread & Circuses does not share a continuity with Randomini's Acidverse. It does, however, dip into the S&C Plastics, War on all Fronts, What a Wonderful World and Ship in a Bottle canons. 

As for adding entries to this hub, keep in mind that tales are ordered chronologically, not by posting, and that any tale set before Former Assets should go under Opening Acts, with tales set after that going under Headlining. Stand-alone tales should work fine on either of these, however, if you're planning on a series that doesn't neatly fit into either Opening Acts or Headlining, put them under Special Attractions. SCPs are arranged numerically under Sideshows. Anything else can be by posting order for now, but I may change that at some point.
[[/tab]]
[[tab Nouns (People, Places and Things)]]
Main Characters:
* **Icky** - The Current Ringmaster of the Circus. Like most Clowns, she's energetic to the point of hypomania. Normally extremely happy, but can become psychotically enraged if anyone she cares about is put in danger. 
* **Manny** - Also known as the Man with the Upside-Down Face. Originally Herman's thug, but slowly accrued power over decades until they were //de facto// partners, a role now shared with Icky. He mostly handles things behind the scenes. He's also responsible for the Circus's pretermemetic defences (see below). 
* **Lolly** - Her full stage name is Li'l Lollipop. She's Icky's lover, assistant, and //de facto// second in command. Even for a Clown, she's excessively energetic, friendly and happy. Loves Icky and the Circus more than anyone, and is fiercely loyal to both (I'd also like to make it clear that despite her childish persona she is physically and chronologically an adult, as some readers were uncertain about this).
* **Victor Chan** - A young MC&D rep from the Hong Kong office, and was assigned the Circus as a client. Relatively inexperienced and still uncomfortable with the anomalous, he functions as a 'straight-man' and audience surrogate.  

[[collapsible show="Also, here they are as buns" hide="Thank you Sunny for the sunny buns"]]
[[image D%26Csunnybuns.png]]
by [[*user sunnyclockwork]]
[[/collapsible]]

The Attractions of the Circus include, but are not limited to:
* **The Big Top** (Currently run by Icky, puts on feature-length performances of the Circus's best acts each afternoon and evening)   
* **The Den of Freaks** (Self-explanatory)
* **The Menagerie of Mayhem** (Displays and houses fantastic anomalous beasts, like Bubblegum the Alcoholic Elephant)
* **The Hall of Humans Extraordinaire** (Gary and Zoltan work here, as did Icky prior to becoming a Clown)
* **The Petting Zoo** (small, for kids, home of the Obama Llama)
* **The Fun-lover's Funhouse** (Fun-lovers are kept in here when not needed. Going in unescorted or wandering off from the tour group is ill-advised)
* **The Mermaid Exhibit** (This was actually the first anomalous attraction Herman ever built for the Circus, featuring a reanimated Fiji Mermaid he stole from P.T. Barnum. It's housed various aquatic themed attractions over the years, such as the (fraudulent) heart of the Dread Behemoth, but at present its main attraction is a small pod of genuine Mermaids, led by Nixie)  
* A midway featuring rides, games, and concession stands.
* Numerous tents for individual acts, like Virtuoso.  

Ancillary sites within the Circus include:
* **The Ringmaster's Tent** (Icky, Manny and sometimes others will use this as an office)
* **The Kaleidoscope** (The Circus's method of anomalous transport, capable of creating Ways on demand into nearly any door in the Multiverse)
* **Clown Alley** (a single trailer modified into a hyperdimensional orthotope, capable of comfortably housing the Circus's entire Clown population)
* **Dormitory Trailers** (train-car sized trailers divided into either eight single sized or four double sized sleeping compartments with a shared washroom. Top talent receives private trailers, while non-performers often have to double up inside single compartments) 
* **The Cookhouse** (prepares and serves meals buffet-style to Circus staff)
* Trailers for storage, transport, and support (laundry, infirmary, etc.)  

[[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ti0jFVSKUo |Clowns are funny...]]]:
* **Original Clowns:** Lovecraftian reality-benders from another plane of existence that took near-human form to join Herman Fuller's Circus(they were bored). Eugene and Pius are the foremost examples.
* **Converted/Turned Clowns:** Humans converted into Clowns. They're a little more normal looking and a little less temperamental but otherwise the same as the Originals. Icky and Lolly are both examples of Turned Clowns. 
* **Bred Clowns:** Created by Dick C. Normus using biological material from both Originals and Turned Clowns. These Clowns have very specific and very extreme traits, and are typically less intelligent than other Clowns. Mr. Noodles is a Bred Clown. As a side-effect of being gestated in Fun-lovers, they produce their own Milk, and therefore require milking or they'll literally explode. Original and Turned Clowns must drink Clown's Milk to survive, and only require milking if they overindulge. 
* **Not Clowns:** Professional clowns, some anomalous and some not, who have nothing to do with True Clowns. Motormouth and Jester the Goblin were both professional clowns who were Not Clowns.  

Other Nouns:
* **Pretermemetics** - Information which is selectively memetic or anti-memetic depending on the nature of the recipients or circumstances. The Circus itself is pretermemetic, being nigh imperceptible to its enemies while simultaneously drawing in customers from miles around. Most customers typically only remember what they experienced as dreams or illusions. 
* **The Utterly Bazaar** - An inter-dimensional marketplace, first appearing in the Acidverse tale Jam Jars. Circus members visit it regularly.
* **The Library and the Serpent's Hand** - If you've been on the site for any length of time you know about these two. Circus members visit the Library often, both for books and to meet with contacts in the Serpent's Hand. 
* **Iris Dark** - I poached her from the Acidverse as well. Dread Iris is Percival Darke's heir, proxy, and apprentice. She's a tech genius who's also dabbling in ancient black magic. Due to the Circus's recent agreement to allow MC&D to use the Kaleidoscope on a limited basis, Percy sends her through it on assignments now and then.
