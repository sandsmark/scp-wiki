[[tab About]]
The main reason I created this series was to finish what PeppersGhost started. He briefly mentioned a female Ringmaster in [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/SCP-2094 |SCP-2094]]], with the clear intention of setting up a further narrative that was never followed up on. PeppersGhost did have an overall arc he intended to tell with Herman Fuller, but this arc was left incomplete. In private e-mails with PeppersGhost he informed me of his overall plan for the Circus, and with his continued input I hope to complete it myself to the best of my ability.

Why do this? Well, I like the Circus partially because in some ways it's the exact opposite of the Foundation. When The Administrator found his first anomaly, he decided it was something to be locked up and kept secret forever. When Herman Fuller found his, he decided to pitch a tent and charge admission. My ideology towards the anomalous is actually closer to that of the Serpant's Hand's than it is to the Foundation's. Not everything anomalous is dangerous, and the Foundation's policy of locking every anomaly up 'just in case' is both immoral and to Humanity's detriment. One of my favourite SCPs is [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-8900-ex |8900-EX]]] because it illustrates the Foundation's edict of preserving the status quo, even if changing the status quo would be a good thing. The Circus is a place where people can see actual magic, and where anomalous people have more freedom than they would in containment.

I also have a fondness for the early days of the Foundation; whacky senior staff, insane cross testing, etc. The Circus gives me a venue to write in that style that would otherwise not be acceptable. 

I will do my best to continue the story PeppersGhost started, and maybe one day the tale of Herman Fuller's Circus of the Disquieting will be known in its entirety.

[[tab Contributing]]

I hope for this to be a Canon someday, so if you're interested in contributing to Dread & Circuses and need feedback on anything just send a message to** [[*user DrChandra]]. Fanart is also welcomed. 

For a more general sense of how to write for Dread and Circuses, I would like to quote the GoI page on tv tropes:

"**Circus of Fear:** Zig-Zagged. When the sadistic Fuller was in charge, the circus fully embraced this trope to the point of Card-Carrying Villain. In the post-Fuller era, while the circus's ethics are grey at best and it still lives up to the disquieting part of its name, it seems to have shifted significantly toward a Ragtag Bunch of Misfits just trying to make a living and show people a Creepy Awesome time."

Remember that. The Circus may be morally ambiguous and creepy as hell, but at its core it's a community of anomalies just trying to survive and find solidarity in each other. The Circus is Family, and Family stays together.

You should definitely read SCP-2094 since that's more or less the 'zig-zag' point as it were. Motormouth provided a postive prospective on the Circus that is very different from PeppersGhost's four prievous Circus scips.

Ideally you should also read this entire series if you're going to write for it, but at the very least make sure you've read a tale that features the characters you're writing about. 

Though my depiction of MC&D in this tale series is heavily inspired by Wills and Ways as well as Bloodbaths, Dread & Circuses does not share a continuity with Randomini's acidverse. I do however have plans for it to cross into S&C Plastics eventually. 

As for adding entries to this hub, keep in mind that tales are ordered chronologically, not by posting, and that any tale set before Former Assest should go under Opening Acts, with all other tales going under Headlining. SCPs are arranged numerically under Side-Shows. Anything else can be by posting order for now, but I may change that at some point.
