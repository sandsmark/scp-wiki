**Item #:** SCP-648

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** As SCP-648 cannot be moved, it is contained on-site with at least two (2) armed, undercover guards on duty at all times. Exploration or experimentation within SCP-648 may only be performed with prior permission from at least one (1) level 4 personnel.

**Description:** SCP-648 is a hidden entrance of the ███████ █████ hedge maze near [DATA EXPUNGED]. Although no official record of this entrance exist, evidence suggests that SCP-648 was incorporated into the hedge maze shortly after its construction.

When subjects enter the maze via SCP-648, they are displaced to an extradimensional space separate from the real maze. So far, several anomalous properties have been observed:

* The alternate maze blocks all radio transmissions, preventing communication or remote recordings of the inside of SCP-648.
* The alternate maze within SCP-648 appears to exceed 3 kilometers in size, or over ██ times larger than the maze from the outside.
* The topography and layout of the alternate maze shifts, as often as once every 3 hours and as seldom as up to 30 days between shifts.
* All attempts to look over or scale the walls have met with failure, including in once case [DATA EXPUNGED], causing the deaths of 1 agent and 2 Class D personnel.
* Multiple hostile entities have been encountered by personnel exploring the inside of SCP-648, many of which do not match creatures known to terrestrial science.

SCP-648 came to the Foundation's attention on ██/█/19██ after two young children managed to enter SCP-648 and were attacked by [DATA EXPUNGED].

Attempts to explore SCP-648 are ongoing, as common features of SCP-648 iterations seem to indicate a possible convergence within the maze. Research into possible defenses against [DATA EXPUNGED] attacks are also underway.

**Addendum 648-01:**

On █/██/200█, a breach was reported at the SCP-648 containment station. Upon arrival, agents found that the station had been attacked from the inside by at least one [DATA EXPUNGED]. Revised containment procedures are under review, and additional guards are to be posted until further notice.
