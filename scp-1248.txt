**Item #:** SCP-1248
 
**Object Class:** Safe
 
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1248 may be kept in a standard containment locker at Site 20, along with all cassette tapes that it has recorded. SCP-1248 is to be tested only in a soundproof room with a separate observation area. The existence of recordings made using SCP-1248 (hereby SCP-1248-1) outside of containment is considered highly unlikely.
 
Testing of SCP-1248-1 should take place only on separate cassette players to avoid undue harm to SCP-1248. Preferably, subjects used to make instances of SCP-1248-1 should be cooperative while doing so.
 
**Description:** SCP-1248 is a Walkman WM-D6 recording device with wear and tear consistent with regular usage. As with normal devices of this model, SCP-1248 is capable of recording sounds when a cassette tape is inserted.
 
SCP-1248’s anomalous properties manifest when a person listens to an instance of SCP-1248-1 with one or more human voices audible. Any subject who hears the recording will become listless and unresponsive until the tape stops or the subject is otherwise unable to hear SCP-148-1. Upon recovery, subjects will exhibit the personality traits of one person who produced sound heard in SCP-1248-1. This change appears to be permanent and affects all facets of the subject’s personality. However, memories, intelligence, and skills will remain unaltered.
 
It has been found that subjects will remain unaffected by instances of SCP-1248-1 listened to after their first exposure. Further, if one of the persons creating audio is experiencing any abnormal mental effect, the change in the subject will reflect that. Note that the tone of voice used to record SCP-1248-1 is inconsequential. See **Testing Log 1248-A** for further information.

**Excerpts from Testing Log 1248-A**
 
**Recording:** D-3638 and D-3639 saying their names simultaneously.
**Subjects:** Six Class-D subjects.
**Special Conditions:** None.
**Result:** All six subjects exhibited personalities consistent with D-3638.
 
**Recording:** A dog barking.
**Subjects:** D-3639.
**Special Conditions:** None.
**Result:** D-3639 collapsed and died. Further inspection showed extensive non-localized brain damage.
 
**Recording:** Dr. Hathaway singing “Eye of the Tiger”.
**Subject:** Drs. Schroeder, Hathaway, and White.
**Special Conditions:** All subjects had consumed large quantities of alcohol prior to testing. Test was unauthorized.
**Result:** As expected; however, all three subjects showed signs of alcohol intoxication and continued to do so after they would normally become sober. After one week, the three were dosed with amnesiacs and remanded to a civilian care facility.
 
**Recording:** Agent Dixon saying his name.
**Subjects:** Name unknown, a captured agent of the Chaos Insurgency.
**Special Conditions:** Agent Dixon has demonstrated remarkable loyalty towards the Foundation.
**Result:** The subject appeared cooperative and attempted to divulge sensitive information regarding a suspected CI base in [REDACTED], but experienced severe throat swelling in the process of doing so and was unable to continue. In addition, large amounts of scar tissue appeared [DATA EXPUNGED]. Subject died shortly thereafter.
**Note:** Use of anomalous items for counterintelligence purposes by the Chaos Insurgency confirmed. It is unlikely that the event was caused by SCP-1248 itself.
 
**Recording:** D-2180 saying his name.
**Subjects:** D-2344
**Special Conditions:** The tape recorder used to play SCP-1248-1 was heavily damaged.
**Result:** D-2344 exhibited behavior sometimes consistent with D-2180’s personality and sometimes with her own personality. D-2344 was apparently unaware of these shifts.
 
**Recording:** D-2180 reading a short paragraph.
**Subjects:** D-2350
**Special Conditions:** D-2180’s voice was altered using a phase vocoder and "Auto-Tune" software.
**Result:** While D-2344’s personality resembled that of D-2180 nominally, D-2344 did not visibly express emotion. Further, subject displayed sociopathic and misanthropic tendencies not present in D-2180.
 
**Recording:** N/A
**Subjects:** D-5552
**Special Conditions:** SCP-1248's microphone was blocked prior to recording.
**Result:** [DATA EXPUNGED]
//[DATA EXPUNGED] sapient even if it// did //exist. If said entity is real and not an effect of SCP-1248, it would almost certainly qualify for containment.//- Dr. Vang
