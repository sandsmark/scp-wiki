[[/div]]

**Item #:** SCP-1448

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Mobile Task Force Nu-6 “Triple-Dog Daredevils” is tasked with tracking SCP-1448 to the best of their ability. Active members of Nu-6 must appear to be between the ages of 12 and 18, and have experience in undercover work. Support personnel also require experience in undercover operations but may be of any physical appearance. Once SCP-1448 has ceased migration, Nu-6 will pose as minors and attempt to discredit any statements made about the area inhabited by SCP-1448, hereby SCP-1448-1.

Each instance of SCP-1448-1 is to be monitored at all times.  Any minors approaching SCP-1448-1 between sunset and sunrise are to be detained and interrogated, then administered amnesiacs and released.  If possible, false memories detailing the failure of any tasks they came to accomplish should be implanted.

**Description:** SCP-1448 is an incorporeal entity that appears as a dark, irregularly-shaped cloud roughly 20 meters in diameter. SCP-1448 is only visible in very dim light, rendering it invisible from shortly before sunrise to shortly after sunset and difficult to see otherwise; however, it is several degrees cooler than its surroundings, allowing it to be tracked via infrared sensors. Except during migration events, SCP-1448 will display no activity whatsoever.

SCP-1448 will only remain in one area for a period of between three months and ten years, with the median time of residence being fifteen months. After this period of time, SCP-1448 will leave and fly to a new destination at a mean speed of 65 kph and a height of between one and fifteen meters. SCP-1448 will rarely fly in a direct path to its destination, instead deviating by up to 170% from the ideal route. On average, SCP-1448 will travel approximately 950 kilometers before choosing a new habitat.

SCP-1448 tends to inhabit manmade structures, although by no means will it restrict itself to artificial habitats. In every recorded instance, SCP-1448-1 has been in an area accessible to the public. SCP-1448-1 has, in the past, been:
* Churches. In all cases, churches inhabited by SCP-1448 have always been over 53 years old at time of migration. SCP-1448 rarely inhabits other religious centers.
* Cemeteries. SCP-1448 appears to have a preference for cemeteries with large gates. Said gates often require frequent maintenance to prevent rusting.
* Caves.  Subterranean areas that have been SCP-1448-1 frequently become colonized by bats after SCP-1448 departs, if they were not already home to bats.
* Trees and stumps over two meters in diameter. Oak trees are the most common tree for SCP-1448 to “roost” in.
* A variety of abandoned buildings in varying states of disrepair. SCP-1448 has attempted to inhabit SCP-████ on five separate occasions, in each case compounding [REDACTED], requiring Mobile Task Force Nu-1’s assistance. 
* Densely forested areas. Forests containing SCP-1448 have been noted to become significantly darker after containment and appear to remain so indefinitely.
* Small bodies of water, such as swamps, ponds, and the shores of lakes. In these cases, SCP-1448-1 has always been the site of at least one drowning.
* Amusement parks and other outdoor recreational areas. Persons who enter SCP-1448-1 during these instances are highly unlikely to dispose of refuse properly.

In a disproportionately large number of cases (16.3%), SCP-1448-1 has been the scene of at least one death prior to hosting SCP-1448.  Said death has been within twenty years of containment in each incidence.  ███ separate incidences of SCP-1448-1 have been recorded since discovery in 1839.

--A full log of SCP-1448-1 is available as Document 1448-1.-- After several researchers expressed interest in visiting instances of SCP-1448-1, Document 1448-1 now requires Level 4 clearance. 

The effects of SCP-1448 being present at SCP-1448-1 are believed to begin approximately three days after SCP-1448 has ceased migration, although they may not become apparent for another week. The primary effect of SCP-1448 is the creation of rumors or “urban legends” regarding SCP-1448-1, often concerning supposed deaths or otherwise abnormal activity in the area. Usually, these rumors (collectively SCP-1448-2) are begun and spread among the youth population of the population center nearest SCP-1448-1. When SCP-1448-1 is near a densely populated area such as a city, SCP-1448-2 will generally be restricted to several city blocks or one neighborhood, although one [DATA EXPUNGED] to prevent federal authorities from becoming involved.

A feature common to every instance of SCP-1448-2 is that, between two and three weeks after SCP-1448 arrives at SCP-1448-1, a rumor will surface to the effect that performing certain actions in or near SCP-1448-1 will yield results that would normally be considered implausible or nonsensical. In most cases, the “ritual” involves some form of dangerous activity or the mutilation and/or killing of an animal. These rumors are only acted upon by persons under the age of eighteen, with the rare exception of intoxicated young adults making attempts. When similar rumors were produced as a test (see Experiment Log 1448-4), nearly all children interviewed (94%) were able to identify which had been created by the researchers, whereas 49% of all other persons interviewed were capable of doing so.

Examples of rituals produced by SCP-1448 include:
* Placing a dead cat on a grave near SCP-1448-1 (see file photo) was intended to cure the mumps.
* Fornication in or under SCP-1448-1-89 would not result in the transmission of pathogens, provided no other precautions against infection were taken.
* Repeating the phrase “She [REDACTED]” eight times with one’s eyes closed inside SCP-1448-1-211 was supposed to cause the ghost of Edna ███████, who committed suicide in SCP-1448-1-211 in late 1894, to kill the speaker. 
* Self-mutilation at midnight in SCP-1448-1-451 resulting in significant blood loss will grant access [DATA EXPUNGED]; notably, three similar entities were recovered from the area several months earlier.

Note that all rituals produced by SCP-1448 are completely nonfunctional and each is unique in nature and intended results. Reported failures of these attempts have been somewhat effective in discouraging others from making attempts. At this stage, it is estimated that 18% of all persons under the age of 18 who are told one of these rituals and the proper location to do so will attempt them.

SCP-1448-2 will change over time, rarely staying stable for longer than five days. After SCP-1448-1 has been active for three weeks, the related rituals will be replaced with steadily more violent versions, in some cases requiring several deaths to “successfully” activate it, with correspondingly larger supposed results. Up to 35% of persons under the age of 18 will attempt to perform these actions. It should be noted that deterring those who try to access SCP-1448-1 during this time becomes increasingly difficult.

After SCP-1448 migrates from SCP-1448-1, SCP-1448-1 is most commonly avoided by locals whenever possible for several years afterwards. The rumors and legends regarding SCP-1448-1 will stay, along with the mildest versions of the rituals involving SCP-1448-1. Persons will no longer exhibit any unnatural desire to perform these rituals. --Former instances of SCP-1448-1 do not require containment.-- Former instances of SCP-1448-1 are reviewed for further containment on a case-by-case basis (See Incident Report 1448-38).

Research into creating reliable containment procedures for SCP-1448 is underway.
