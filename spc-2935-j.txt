**From the office of the Athletic Coordinator.**

Ladies and gentlemen of the Centre. When we founded this organization, we had a simple mission statement: Sock. Pummel. Combat. From our humble beginnings following the consolidation of several covert anti-shark organizations [[footnote]]//Most notably: 'Her Majesty's Foundation for the Shark Punchers of the Coast'//[[/footnote]], right on through till today, this has been our promise to the world. We have had to make some tough choices over this time, as the personnel currently performing Procedure 110-Monshark[[footnote]]//Which entails punching a little-girl shark in the face. Repeatedly.//[[/footnote]] are aware. You may have had to raise your fist against your friends, your loved ones, all in the pursuit of our mission.

You may have heard of [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/spc-169-j|Project Ahab]]]. You may have wondered if such a thing could be justified. You may fret over the possibility of non-sharks being caught in the crossfire, of innocent civilians being punched into oblivion. "It's too much," the detractors say, "surely we don't need to resort to WMP's".

SPC-2935 represents the single greatest threat to our continued existence. This file is hereby declassified to all levels of the Centre. What you are about to read is incredibly disturbing, but it must be made known. We cannot, //will not// falter. We will not concede defeat. And when you gaze into the abyss, ladies and gentlemen...

...punch the shit out of it.

**Description:** [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2935|SPC-2935]]] is the term for an alternate Earth, accessible via an heretofore undocumented cave system in New Mexico.

SPC-2935 is for all intents and purposes identical to baseline Earth, excluding the fact that organic life - as well as advanced AI and sentient anomalies - became entirely selachian-based on July 17, 2017.

SPC-2935 was discovered on July 19th, after pugilists at Arena-81 picked up a distorted emergency broadcast. A search of the area of its supposed origin led to the discovery of a cave which accessed the aforementioned alternate Earth. Upon entry, the broadcast was able to be deciphered:

> Citizens, beware! Selachian threats may be loose in the immediate area. Please remain indoors, and report any fishy activity to your local Centre representative. Stay tuned in for further updates.

All subsequent information on SPC-2935 was gathered by Mobile Task Fist Betta-12 ("Bare-Knuckle Trawlers"), and relayed to Centre Command during a reconnaissance mission.

> 
> **Adrian:** Very funny miss--Ow! Ow! Shit, help!
> 
> //[The grass around Adrian animates and points in his direction, while the closest blades bend and touch their tips against his body. Adrian can be seen pulling several from his hand prior to punching the ground in retaliation.]//

> 
> **Adrian:** It's biting me! The fuckin'-ow-grass is biting me!
>

> 
> **Adrian:** Yea. All good.
> 
> **Russell:** Alright. Let's keep it moving, then.

> 
> **Segal:** ...then I says, 'I meant with THESE!'! //[Grabs his pelvic region, remaining members laugh.]//
> 
> **Russell:** Hold it, guys. Coach, we've got a house here. Lights are on - looks like someone might be home.
> 
> **Coach:** You're clear to enter. Be careful team. Punch anything that moves.
>

> 
> **Russell:** //[sniffs]// Aw, that's foul.

> **Segal:** Smells like 's time to kick some arse. //[cracks knuckles]//
> 
> //[Team moves through the house; Russell and Segal clear the first floor, while Maggie and Adrian search the second. Russell detects noises emanating from the basement, the squad rendezvous in the kitchen.]//
> 
> **Maggie:** What's going on, we found something?
> 
> **Russell:** Think so. Listen...
> 
> //[The squad pauses. From the basement; several long, drawn-out, high-pitched vocalizations can be heard. It seems to be coming from multiple sources.]//

> **Adrian:** Hey, found something! It's a newspaper. "Albuquerque Herald. July 17, 2016." Headline reads: "Four dead after a deadly game of 'Leap Frog'. Residents shocked." That was two days ago.

> **Russell:** Good find. Coach?

It displays the set of 'Shark Tank'//[[footnote]]//'Shark Tank' Was an American reality television series that invited entrepreneurs to present business ideas to a group of investors or 'Sharks', who would then choose whether or not close a deal. In baseline, the show lasted a single episode before it was raided by the Centre. All involved in its production were summarily pummeled to death.//[[/footnote]]. 
> 
> //Several shark-people can be seen flopping about the set, two of which seem to be attempting to climb into seats. A fifth shark-person lays opposite them, using a pointer to draw attention towards a large drawing aboard an easel. The drawing seems to be a schematic that would assist in bipedal locomotion for the shark-people. All instances are excitedly repeating the word 'shark', in an argumentative manner.]//

> **Coach:** Affirmative. We have another squad on standby. Hold your position.

All microbes observed displayed selachian traits. Three operatives had to be treated upon receiving glass splinters from sample slides in their knuckles.

Under magnification, individual blades can be seen to posses what appears to be dorsal and pectoral fins, as well as tooth-lined 'mouths'. Specially-engineered threshers are currently being mass-produced to pummel the flora of SPC-2935. These machines are projected to clear SPC-2935 in its entirety sometime within the next few centuries. The Five-Finger Death Council has expressed satisfaction with this time-table.

The streets are littered with car accidents, with drivers still flopping around all silly-like in their seats. To the east, several sharknados tear across the county.//

> //The drone continues on for some time, occasionally engaging in pugilism against passing shawks, swarms of bumble sharks, and an unusually persistent shark paraglider. Eventually, the drone arrives at Arena-19, and pings the team.//

> **Adrian:** Listen. I think I have everything figured out. There was this note that dead-me wrote before beating himself to death. It was a warning. //He// already went through this. He went into his //own// SPC-2935 from here and when he came back? Well, //something// stuck with him.

> It's... I don't - I'm certain of it. No one here's going to believe me, and if we try to head back... I can't bear to let it happen. I've got little sluggers back home! I can't let this happen to them! Any one of us could carry this, this //thing// back - let it do to our world what it did here.
