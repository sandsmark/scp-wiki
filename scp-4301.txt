**Item #:** SCP-4301

**Object Class:** Euclid

[[collapsible show="Open Outdated Containment Procedures" hide="..."]]

**Special Containment Procedures (Outdated):** SCP-4301 is currently considered a high-risk breach of VEIL Protocol due to possible spontaneous materialization in public areas. Operatives belonging to MTF Phi-3 ('Photobombers') are assigned with the task of containing SCP-4301 and transferring it to the Site-75 Humanoid Containment Wing, where it is to be contained in a standard Humanoid Containment Cell and guarded by at least 2 Site-75 guards.

As SCP-4301's true purpose is still not known to the Foundation, MTF Phi-3 operatives are to exercise caution when attempting to capture and contain SCP-4301.

**Special Containment Procedures (Updated):** SCP-4301’s current status is unknown. All personnel are to closely monitor Dr. Gilles for any future manifestations of SCP-4301.

Should any future manifestations of SCP-4301 display signs of hostility towards Dr. Gilles or any other Foundation personnel, priority must be given for the immediate capture and containment of SCP-4301.

**Description:** SCP-4301 is a 1.72 m male humanoid closely linked to Dr. Laura Gilles, the head researcher of Site-75. While the reason as to why SCP-4301 is only linked to Dr. Gilles is still not known, Dr. Gilles has stated that the humanoid resembles Timothy Gilles, her husband who had vanished in Nevada in 1987.

SCP-4301 is normally incorporeal, and will only materialise if a picture is taken of Dr. Gilles using a camera, phone, or another photo-capturing device. SCP-4301 will materialise behind, beside, or in front of Dr. Gilles, and will subsequently dematerialise approximately 5 seconds after the taking of the picture. SCP-4301 will then subsequently appear in the taken pictures (designated as instances of SCP-4301-1) with Dr. Gilles.

While instances of SCP-4301-1 commonly display SCP-4301 making a pose, SCP-4301 also has the capability of altering SCP-4301-1 depending on the pose Dr. Gilles makes, or the other objects in the original picture. Alterations can include changes to SCP-4301-1's background, setting, inserted filter, and Dr. Gilles' actions.

> **Interviewed:** Dr. Laura Gilles
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Hubert King, Site-75 On-Site Psychologist
> 
> **Foreword:** The interview was conducted at the personal request of Dr. Gilles.
> 
> **<Begin Log, 1634 hours>**
> 
> **HK:** Let's begin then. Dr. Gilles, you mentioned in your psychiatric session application form that you have been 'followed' by an unnatural entity that only appears in your photos.
> 
> **LG:** That is true. The Foundation has classified the entity as an anomaly, and we are trying to capture it as of now.
> 
> **HK:** So what seems to be the problem?
> 
> **LG:** The entity looks like someone I know personally. My husband, in fact.
> 
> **HK:** I see. And seeing him makes you uncomfortable?
> 
> **LG:** More than that. It's like seeing someone again after a few years of separation from one another. You're happy to see them again, but you're not sure how much of the old 'them' is still in them. I had wished, prayed for his reappearance ever since he disappeared. Now that he has come back, I'm surprised and terrified at the same time. I wanted him to be by my side again after all these years, but instead, he only comes back when I take pictures of myself and disappears shortly after. I can't get a chance to talk to him, and that frustrates me.
> 
> **HK:** But despite all that, you still love him?
> 
> **LG:** Yes. That's why I'm trying to reach him, or at least the thing that acts like him. That's why I'm trying to capture it.
> 
> **HK:** But, since the entity who looks like your husband doesn't talk to you when he appears, could it be that he just chooses not to talk to you?
> 
> **LG:** Does it matter?
> 
> **HK:** It matters a whole lot. If you're trying to reach him, or it, you must understand his decision and why he chooses to only do what he is doing. You can't force him to talk to you. That's just not how trust works. You need to trust that he will be by your side, and he needs to trust you too. If there is no trust, there will be no happiness for both you and him.
> 
> **LG:** No. If I know him, he always trusts me to do the right thing, and capturing him is still the priority here.
> 
> **HK:** I see. Good luck, then.
> 
> **LG:** Thank you, doctor.
> 
> **<End Log, 1657 hours>**
