**Item #**: SCP-327

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-327 should be kept in a 100mx50mx30m salt water pool at Site 17: said pool is to be kept at least 100 meters from any open body of water, and must not have any direct access through drains or other channels to any open body of water. The water must be changed at least once a month over a period of two weeks: in addition, daily maintenance must include removal of algae build-up on all pool surfaces by divers (as the use of anti-algal chemicals is prohibited due to toxicity). Due to its reduced mobility outside of water, removing access from bodies of water are sufficient to contain SCP-327. 

SCP-327 is to be fed approximately 5kg of fresh raw meat daily: preferred foods are squid, herring, mackerel, and cod, although subject does enjoy terrestrial meats, particularly pork and beef. All terrestrial meat fed to SCP-327 is to be irradiated to prevent SCP-327 from suffering infections from trichinosis and other blood-borne pathogens.

Due to increased lethargy (apparently due to prolonged captivity) SCP-327's accomodations may be revised in the future to include a large volume of water and a variety of live sea life: arrangements are being made to transfer SCP-327 to the defunct ███████ Aquarium, the future Site ██ (Aquatic Containment Facility).

Personnel working with SCP-327 are required to wear hearing protection, including earplugs and white-noise generation headsets, during the summer months (June through September).

**Description:** SCP-327 appears to be a female member of a species of aquatic mammal currently unknown to the public: subject is approximately 1.4m in length and weighs approximately 50 kg. General body type is humanoid, although the legs have atrophied and been replaced with a tail, similar to cetaceans. SCP-327 has no body hair, a skin-tone similar to that of a bottlenose dolphin, and no dorsal fins. Subject's eyes are 300 percent larger than normal humanoid eyes, and possess a large iris and a tapetum lucidum, resulting in greatly improved night-time vision. Subject also possesses the ability to echolocate, similar to cetaceans.

SCP-327 is highly intelligent, and has attempted to communicate with her human handlers several times. Although unable to speak due to her incompatible vocal apparatus, SCP-327 has learned to read and write in nine different languages.

SCP-327's major danger comes from its unusual vocalizations: once per year, between the months of July and August, SCP-327 is compelled emerge upon land and "sing" - this is believed to be a mating ritual, although, to date, no answering songs have been detected. The song, however, has an unusual side effect when heard by humans: victims are compelled to leap into the nearest ocean and swim towards the horizon, continuing to do so until exhausted, resulting in death by drowning. Sea-going sailors, however, report an opposite impulse, feeling compelled to pilot their ships/boats towards land at highest possible speed, resulting in destruction of the vessel. The reason for these two very different effects is unknown.

**Notes:**

SCP-327 came to the facility when fishermen off the coast of Miami, FL started reporting sightings of a mysterious creature in the water. Containment teams were dispatched via Osprey aircraft, and SCP-327 was collected without incident. It should also be noted that there were numerous reports of ships running aground or beaching around the time SCP-327 was collected, with crew members having no recollection of how the ship came to such a state.
