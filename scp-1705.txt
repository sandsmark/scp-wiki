**Item #:** SCP-1705

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-1705 and SCP-1705-A are to be kept in Safe-level containment lockers at Site 33. Instances of SCP-1705 should only be brought together during controlled testing with at least three Level 3 personnel presiding over the event. Only D-Class subjects should be used in testing instances of SCP-1705-B. All instances of SCP-1705-A are to be photographed and filed appropriately. Personnel are to refer to the photographs of SCP-1705-A rather than the tablets themselves if possible.

**Description:** SCP-1705 is a collection of 2,507 bones of various origin and composition. Many instances of SCP-1705 are identical. All instances have been physically altered with notches and protrusions for the apparent purpose of accommodating separate instances of SCP-1705. These bones can be assembled in a variety of ways by following diagramming that is etched onto instances of SCP-1705-A. When assembled according to the diagrams, SCP-1705 instances will begin to rapidly produce tissues that act to create usable tools, machines, and inventions, forming an instance of SCP-1705-B. See Addendum-1705-Upsilon for details. Foundation-produced materials have had no effect when assembled in a manner consistent with instances of SCP-1705.

SCP-1705-A is a series of stone tablets diagramming pictorial instructions on assembling SCP-1705. The tablets depict instances of SCP-1705 of particular shape, without marks that could be used to identify a specific bone; as such, any instance of SCP-1705 matching the depiction can be substituted into the design. There are currently --142-- 107[[footnote]]35 instances of SCP-1705-A were lost during testing of SCP-1705-B-071. Testing must not continue in the presence of tablets to ensure the greatest possible retention of SCP-1705-A instances.[[/footnote]] instances of SCP-1705-A contained by the Foundation. Instances of SCP-1705-A are not anomalous.

SCP-1705-B-001 through SCP-1705-B-142 refer to the constructs created by assembling SCP-1705 instances correctly according to an SCP-1705-A instance. All instances are composed of tissues normally found in terrestrial fauna[[footnote]]Notable examples of this include the use of keratin for walls and lipids for fuels.[[/footnote]]. All modifications done to an instance of SCP-1705-B constructed using a specific subset of SCP-1705 appear to remain over time and do not change after repeated disassemblies and reconstruction[[footnote]]Such examples of this include damage to an iteration of SCP-1705, graffiti, and bodily fluids.[[/footnote]]. 

SCP-1705 and SCP-1705-A were recovered at at 39.7████ N. 11.5████ E by Mobile Task Force Sigma-5 (aka "Sinkronized Swimmers"). All objects were found on the seabed, with approximately 350 instances of SCP-1705 and 250 instances of SCP-1705-A deemed unusable or illegible. Ruins resembling structures similar to those of the first century Roman Empire were prevalent at the site of recovery, but deemed irretrievable. The Foundation currently speculates that an ancient civilization originally native to the area of discovery constructed and utilized all known instances of SCP-1705.

**Addendum-1705-Upsilon:** The following is a amended testing log of the various forms of SCP-1705-B constructed by following the diagramming on SCP-1705-A instances.

||~ SCP-1705-B||~ Apparent Function of Results||~ Researcher Notes||
||SCP-1705-B-054||Fountain||The anomaly produces a currently unknown liquid continually at a rate of 4L per minute. The basin of SCP-1705-B-054 is able to hold approximately 4L of liquid at a time. The liquid has been revealed to be highly addictive and toxic.||
||SCP-1705-B-071||--Unknown-- Incendiary device||--Given the apparent superficial similarities of SCP-1705-B-071 through SCP-1705-B-088, testing will be done to discover the function of all three.-- SCP-1705-071 has been determined to be an incendiary explosive. Due to the greater proportion of the materials of these instances in comparison to the remainder of SCP-1705, the Foundation has deducted that SCP-1705-B-071 through SCP-1705-B-088 were originally designed to be easy to make and readily replaceable. SCP-1705-B-071 is activated by noises louder than 90 dB. When exposed to such conditions, SCP-1705-B-071 ignites for approximately 7 seconds, then explodes, often destroying its composite materials in the process. Usage of an instance SCP-1705-B-071 renders that instance unusable.||
||SCP-1705-B-090||Communications Device||SCP-1705-B-090 appears to be constructed in a way that mimics a humanoid CNS. The device is approximately 1m by 0.5 m by 1.75 m. Attached to SCP-1705-B-090 is an input device and a module for housing recorded media. The front of the device itself houses a screen, which is assumed to project the media onto the screen; however, at the time of writing, no currently viewable media is available for the device. Multiple instances of SCP-1705-B-090 are able to communicate between each other.||
||SCP-1705-B-099||Turret||The anomaly appears to be constructed to accommodate about 3 bipedal organisms at a time. The construct is capable of launching projectiles made out of instances of SCP-1705-098 at a target.||
||SCP-1705-B-121 through SCP-1705-B-142||Unknown||All objects appear to be too large to construct within the confines of Site 53 at the time. Research is postponed on these instances until a suitable location is decided on.||

**Addendum-1705-Chi:** A suitable location was found to be appropriate for the apparent size for testing SCP-1705-B-121 through SCP-1705-B-142 at Area 14. 

||~ SCP-1705-B||~ Apparent Function of Results||~ Researcher Notes||
||SCP-1705-B-121||Temple||SCP-1705-B-121 appears to be a place for religious observation. It can be speculated that the idolistic figures depicted near the entrance of the construct are what this civilization worshipped. Furthermore, the structure appears to have been desecrated with graffiti depicting obscene and lewd activities, as well as fragments from what can be assumed to be instances of SCP-1705-B-071 embedded in the various parts of the wall.  The civilization appears to have undergone a civil war.||
||SCP-1705-B-122 through SCP-1705-B-142||Homes||All instances of SCP-1705-B-122 through SCP-1705-B-142 appear to be housing units for the SCP-1705 civilization. Each building is equipped with an instance of SCP-1705-B-054 in some way, often attached to receptacles that store any overflow. Instances of SCP-1705-B-090 have been found in the majority of the homes with accompanying media. When shown through the screen of SCP-1705-B-090, the media depict subjects adorned with attire similar to that of the ancient Roman Empire during the first century engaging in various displays of power[[footnote]]Notable examples of these displays include excessive drinking from SCP-1705-B-054, positioning themselves in front of instances of SCP-1705-B-099 as it is being fired, and wrestling.[[/footnote]].||

//I would like to request a review of the names applied to these objects. We may be applying a perceived purpose to them without fully reviewing their intended usability. A warrior civilization in this area at this time simply does not make sense, and closer examination of SCP-1705 is necessary.// -Researcher Lawrence
