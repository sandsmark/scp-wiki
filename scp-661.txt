    **Item #:** SCP-661

    **Object Class:** Safe

    **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-661 is currently kept at ███-██ in a room of 6m x 8m, at an average temperature of 20.0C. A bed sits in one corner and a toilet in another with a sink/mirror next to it. All guards to this room are to be confirmed deaf or are to wear ear protection capable of sound neutralization and white noise generation. All non-test subject personnel entering and leaving the room are to be tested by polygraph. Failure of test should result in a 27 hour quarantine followed by a retest. Failure of the retest leads to a repeat of this procedure until test comes up clean. All security cameras are to be sound disabled. All sound recording devices are to only be played back under test circumstance.

SCP-661 is to be fed three times per day and provided with flavored liquids six times per day. Subject refuses to drink water to the point of danger.

    **Description:** SCP-661 is a fat, balding middle-aged man in poor shape and worse temper. Subject was found working as an advertising/marketing agent in ██████ ███. Subject was doing vocal work for radio and TV advertisements. Subject has a personality that is frequently described as demanding.

Subject has the unusual power to, through the sound of his voice, make others want what he tells them to want. Testing has shown that this works for the longest (Approx 1 week) for physical objects and shortest (Approx 5 hours) for abstract concepts such as 'love' or 'peace'. Tests have shown that subject must understand what he is saying to transmit the effect. It is theorized that [Data Redacted]. More testing is necessary.

    **Addendum 661-1:** Despite claims to the contrary by SCP-661, subject is perfectly aware of his powers. Erasure is recommended should SCP-661 ever become a threat or successfully breach containment. Tests performed with biopsy and skin samples suggest that a simple bullet will do the job. Incineration of body recommended for extra confirmation. ~ Dr. ██████

Subject is rude and uncooperative even under threat of force. Actual force has yielded some results for testing, but not enough. Recommend application of class A amnesiacs followed by a personality re-write. ~ Dr. ██████
