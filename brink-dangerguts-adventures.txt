title:Brink Dangerguts Adventures
Of late, several anonymous manuscripts featuring a protagonist named "Brink Dangerguts" have been discovered in numerous SCP facilities. The documents include very little in the way of factual information, but contain enough sensitive material to engender a low-level security breach if found outside Foundation walls. The writings have been organized here to assist in identification.
