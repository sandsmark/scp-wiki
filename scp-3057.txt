**Item #:** SCP-3057

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** A small quantity of SCP-3057-1 is contained on-site. Members of MTF Epsilon-6 ("Oil Slickers") are to operate as first-responders in the event of a major oil spill, destroying all organisms produced via SCP-3057. 

**Description:** SCP-3057 is an anomalous phenomenon by which crude oil spontaneously transforms into instances of prehistoric species (SCP-3057-1 and onward).

SCP-3057-1[[footnote]]//Rafatazmia chitrakootensis//, a species of pre-Cambrian algae.[[/footnote]] was first observed in the aftermath of the //Deepwater Horizon// explosion[[footnote]]The //Deepwater Horizon// was a semi-submersible oil-drilling platform located in the Gulf of Mexico.[[/footnote]] in 2010. PoI-8A052 (an ex-employee of the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/manna-charitable-foundation-hub Manna Charitable Foundation]) deployed SCP-3057 in an attempt to reverse environmental damage caused by the disaster. It was only through extensive Foundation efforts that SCP-3057-1's spread was limited to a radius of 0.25 kilometers from the initial point of contamination. Since 2010, 4 more instances of SCP-3057 have been observed around the world. Whether this is a result of the initial contamination remains unknown.

The Manna Charitable Foundation has disavowed all knowledge of SCP-3057, and claims PoI-8A052's employment was terminated several weeks before the //Deepwater Horizon// incident. An ongoing investigation is underway to determine whether or not this is true.

> **Date:** 08/11/2013
> 
> **Location:** Philippines; Estancia, Iloilo
> 
> **Description:** SCP-3057-2; //Anomalocaris//, a Cambrian era meter-long ancestral arthropod resembling predatory shrimp.
> 
> **Notes:** //Power Barge 103// (owned by Napocor, or National Power Company) experienced several leaks as a result of Typhoon Haiyan. This resulted in the emergence of several hundred instances of SCP-3057-2. 
> 
> Over a dozen injuries along the coast have been linked to SCP-3057-2, which attacks its prey using barbs lining 2 appendages located near its mouth. These attacks have been blamed on a new species of invasive jellyfish. Foundation efforts to destroy all instances of SCP-3057-2 are ongoing.

> 
> **Location:**  Bangladesh; Sundarbans, Khulna Division
> 
> **Description:** SCP-3057-3; //Meganeura//, a Carboniferous era dragonfly with a maximum wingspan of 0.65 meters[[footnote]]For reference, //Corvus brachyrhynchos// -- the common American crow -- has a wingspan of approximately 0.85 meters.[[/footnote]].
> 
> **Notes:** The //OT Southern Star 7// collided with a cargo vessel, leading to several hundred instances of SCP-3057-3. 
> 
> Every instance of SCP-3057-3 expired shortly after manifesting; recent research suggests this is related to SCP-3057-3 having evolved in an oxygen-rich environment[[footnote]]The Carboniferous era saw atmospheric oxygen concentrations as high as 35% -- compared to the current era's 20% concentration.[[/footnote]]. All SCP-3057-3 instances have been recovered and destroyed.

> **Location:**  United States of America; Pennsylvania, Philadelphia
> 
> **Description:** SCP-3057-4; //Velociraptor//, a Cretaceous era carnivorous theropod dinosaur approximately 2 meters in length and 0.5 meters high (at the hip).
> 
> **Notes:** A unit upset in an oil refinery caused several vessels in a tank-farm to catastrophically  rupture. This led to the emergence of several dozen instances of SCP-3057-4. All instances are believed to have fled into the surrounding wetlands[[footnote]]Before being amnesticized, witnesses provided confirmation that instances of SCP-3057-4 did, in fact, have feathers.[[/footnote]].
> 
> To date, 11 casualties (9 injuries and 2 fatalities) have been linked to SCP-3057-4. Foundation operatives have provided media outlets with a false cover story describing the escape of several cassowaries from captivity. All efforts to destroy instances of SCP-3057-4 are to be conducted by MTF Phi-2 ("Clever Girls").

> **Description:** SCP-3057-5; //Megalodon//, a Cenozoic era shark with a maximum length of 18 meters[[footnote]]For reference, a typical American school-bus is 13.7 meters.[[/footnote]].
> 
> **Notes:** The //BW Maple// collided with //Dawn Kanchipuram//, another oil-tanker. This lead to the manifestation of 6 instances of SCP-3057-5.
> 
> 1 instance of SCP-3057-5 is confirmed as destroyed; the remaining 5 instances remain unaccounted for. After the loss of //Beagle 2//'s crew, all further efforts to destroy instances of SCP-3057-5 are now conducted by MTF Theta-5 ("The Bigger Boat").

> **Agent Densworth:** How did you do this? Was it a chemical?
> 
> **PoI-8A051:** The 'how' isn't as important as the 'why'.
> 
> **Agent Densworth:** Alright, I'll bite: Why did you decide to turn one ecological disaster into a much bigger one?
> 
> **PoI-8A051:** Really? You think a prehistoric algae bloom is worse than dumping five million barrels of poison into the ocean?
> 
> **Agent Densworth:** You can't pull an extinct species out of the Proterozoic era, hurl it into the modern world, then not expect dire consequences.
> 
> **PoI-8A051:** More dire than the consequences of hurling over a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide into our atmosphere every year?
> 
> **Agent Densworth:** For fuck's sake. Are you for real?
> 
> **PoI-8A051:** You're concerned over some obsolete organisms popping into existence and making life a little more complicated. Meanwhile, I'm concerned over how we are obliviously committed to a campaign to de-terraform the entire fucking planet. Are //you// for real?
> 
> **Agent Densworth:** I'm not here to argue with your bizarro-world Greenpeace bullshit, Al Gore. I'm here to find out how you did this. And you're not leaving this room until you tell me.
> 
> **PoI-8A051:** In that case, I suspect I will be here for quite a while.
