title:Incident 517-1997-M
parent:scp-517
**SCP Involved**: [[[SCP-517]]]
**Personnel Involved**: Dr. Agusta Meil (deceased), Site-23 Security 
**Date**: 08/25/1997
**Location**: Storage Site-23.

//On 08/25/1997, at approximately 13:56, the late Dr. Meil was targeted by [[[SCP-517]]] while supervising the object’s transport to a new storage locker. Security and Site Director were alerted, and a defensive strategy was devised.// 

//At 23:30, Dr. Meil was loaded into a Foundation UH-60 Black Hawk, five security personnel assigned as bodyguards. Helicopter was situated on Helipad 3-8, located on the roof of the then-empty Cafeteria 1.// 

//Non-essential security personnel from sectors 1, 3 and 4 were armed with blades and stun batons, and select personnel were granted flame weapons and concussion explosives. Squads were directed to strategic points around Cafeteria 1’s main and second floors, and instructed to destroy any instances of SCP-517-01 that appear. As this was the first concerted effort intended to overcome SCP-517-01, all measures were taken.// 

//As Cafeteria 1 was not constructed with a proper basement, it was expected that SCP-517-01 would manifest in one of the surrounding buildings. All SCP objects that posed a threat if released by SCP-517-01 were moved to another area of the Site. [[[SCP-059]]]’s enclosure is located away from Cafeteria 1 and as such was deemed safe.//
