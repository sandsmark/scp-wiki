[[tab Profile]]

**Full Name:** Krona "Proasek" Midaeus

**Date of Birth:** 13/07/20██

**Personnel Classification:** B

**Security Clearance:** 2 

**Position:** General researcher at Site-34

**Location:** Site-34 

**Notable Features:** Krona Midaeus is a pale British woman, with a young face and sky blue hair. She --wears-- no longer wears a green tinted visor at all times. The visor is of her own design, and --its purpose is unknown-- its purpose is to look cool.

**History:** Krona Midaeus was recruited as part of a personnel exchange with the British Occult Service, where she formerly held the position of Internal Security Agent. In 20██, Krona Midaeus was reassigned to the Scientific Department by request, and was assigned as a Junior Researcher working at Site-34. After two years diligent work, initially as part of the SCP-████ project and later assisting MTF Lambda-14 ("One Star Reviewers"), Krona Midaeus was promoted to a full Researcher. Krona Midaeus has since worked at this level on various minor projects. 

Krona Midaeus has a notable interest in SCP-914, and has proposed and executed a number of unusual tests regarding it. These can be found in [[[Experiment Log 914 2 |Experiment Log 914]]]

**Profile:** Researcher Midaeus is well known for an unusual approach, her unique style of testing often revealing important information that could not be revealed through standard testing procedure. Due to the variety of tests, as well as a background with the B.O.S, she has a large variety of memetic inoculations. She is equally well known for her sarcastic attitude, convoluted insults, and for being the most overtly British Foundation researcher in the nearest thousand miles.

**Note:** //No, I did **NOT** work for the sodding Gocks, those wankers can't know their arse from their face for the amount of shite they spew from both. MI-666 is far more competent on its own, and all we've got to deal with are the Welsh!//

[[tab Author Notes]]

I've been remarkably lucky when it comes to SCP articles; I've not had anything taken off the main site! That's not to say anything's done especially well however, so I've got a long way to go. My brief time here has been characterised by two things: A restaurant of anomalous dishes, and a consistent and uncanny ability to rope highly respected writers into my projects. 

Let's have a look at what I've written, eh?

-----

**[[[Dining Out]]]:** My first post on the website was this tale, created for Halloween 2018. Doesn't really fit the theme, but I was really just looking for an excuse to plumb in this new GoI idea I had...

Perhaps that's why it took two weeks to breach +10?

-----

**[[[SCP-4554]]]:** [[*user DrChandra]] wrote an [[[Oh, I Wouldn't Worry About Flaky-Os |excellent tale]]] regarding my new Group, and I just had to use an idea I saw there. How had there not been a liquid sunshine skip before now? Truly, the mainlist boggles the mind.

-----

**[[[Ambrose Fair|The Ambrose Fair]]]:** Following the setup of the Ambrose Restaurant Discord channel, I received the very good point that Ambrose probably isn't the first in the anomalous food market. So I decided to do a good bit of world building. 

I also took the opportunity to lay down the groundwork for a few characters I can use later.

-----

**What's Next?** I'll be taking a break from Ambrose for a bit while I look for other writers. I am however working on a draft with an idea gifted to me by [[*user LurkD]], which I shan't explain too much for fear of spoiling things.

Suffice to say, [[[shaggydredlocks proposal|dawn is coming]]]


I'm also working on a thing with [[*user Smooothcriminal]] to make a Foundation standard issue guide book, which you can fine the other parts of [http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/smooothcriminal on their sandbox.]

[[tab Sandbox]]

For a look at all current projects, and several weird offshoots, have a look at my [http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/proasek Sandbox]! Direct any questions and concerns towards the discussion page here, since I've not much other use for it.

[[tab Fanart]]

I lied, I'm not Spherical Livingquarters. I don't have a load of fanart lying around because I've not plugged my work until I become famous for it. I'm not opposed to it, however.
