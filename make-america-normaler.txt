> __Directive: Make America Normaler__ (or MAN) describes the Unusual Incidents Unit and the United States Government's goal of maintaining normalcy in all facets of American civilian life. The United States Government has deemed this imperative to the sanity and well-being of its people. In the removal of abnormalities, among the most successful initiatives was the displacement of said activity into the Three Portlands, a pocket universe / city that exists alongside the physical location of Portland, Oregon. This was considered sufficient precedent to justify //Operation: MAN's Best Friend//.

[[div class="content-panel standalone"]]
[[size 120%]] **Operation:** MAN's Best Friend[[/size]]

**Summary:** THUS-1221 (Boring, Oregon) is an area of disproportionate anomalous activity within Oregon. Operation: MAN's Best Friend seeks to reduce said activity through exporting it to Three Portlands via the nearby Portland, Oregon. By siphoning anomalies to Three Portlands, we can ensure the Veil's future in upholding and maintaining normalcy.  We expect to accomplish this by supplying locals with thaumaturgically sealed vans who can then take said anomalies and sell them in the Three Portlands market through a UIU monitored Way. UIU agents already present in Three Portlands would overlook all of said market operations.

[[tab Plan of Action]]
In years prior, Wilson's Wildlife Solutions (WWS) has been too closely connected to the SCP Foundation's power structure to allow for implementation of MAN's Best Friend. However, recent developments-- under the leadership of Faeowynn Wilson, the successor to Tim Wilson after his death in the summer of 2024-- have gained them newfound independence and agency outside of the Foundation's supervision.

Due to this, it is likely that Ms. Wilson would be open to (and able to accept) exporting anomalies from THUS-1221 into Three Portlands. It is also believed that the economic landscape of Three Portlands is lacking in anomalous animal distribution, lessening the possibility of competition for the prospective business. The current approach is as follows:

* Suggest the creation of an adoption center in Three Portlands, where WWS could take anomalies that they can not contain or that would be easy to handle as a pet. This can be framed as a joint operation between the UIU and WWS to alleviate the pressure of containing the majority of anomalies from THUS-1221 so as to reduce the risk of a breach in the Veil.
* Depending on the nature of the adoption center, it might be possible to embed agents within it, which would establish clearer intel on their inner workings. This would allow for closer monitoring of the success of MAN's Best Friend.
* Offer to help familiarize them with Three Portlands. Such operations can serve as a venue through which to oversee their business ventures.
* Offer monetary contributions to the project to expedite the process. It is also possible to use this action as a venue to ask that WWS returns said money at a low interest rate from profits, leading to a small financial gain.
* Directly contribute to the marketing for and dissemination of information about the adoption center's opening to denizens of Three Portlands, also as a means to hasten the process.
* Through all of the above actions, establish a relationship with WWS as allies instead of supervisors, contrary to the relationship under Tim Wilson. An amiable relationship would lead to more willingness to share their Three Portlands interactions. A supervisory relationship would be more difficult to establish, due to Ms. Wilson's stricter business practices and the continued support of and from the SCP Foundation.

[[tab Current Progress]]
__2028/4/16:__ Contact was established with Faeowynn Wilson and a meeting was proposed between herself, any staff she would like to have with her, and three UIU representatives. She accepted, and the meeting was scheduled for 4/21.

__2028/4/21:__ The meeting was largely successful, and Ms. Wilson met the idea of starting an adoption center with enthusiasm. It was suggested that several UIU agents escort Ms. Wilson and trusted WWS staff through Three Portlands to become acquainted with the area. Our representatives presented the idea to the Operation Director, and it was summarily approved. Email correspondence has set a date for 4/29.

__2028/4/29:__ Tour of Three Portlands was deemed successful. Ms. Wilson seemed optimistic about the prospect of establishing an adoption center in Three Portlands, as she believed it would relieve pressure on WWS, and create further connections with the anomalous community.  However, herself and her entourage did express anxiety about the acquisition of property in Three Portlands. As such, Ms. Wilson was informed that the UIU have a contact.

__2028/4/30:__ UIU agents awaited the arrival of Capital R, a real estate agent acquainted with extradimensional and otherwise anomalous locations[[footnote]]Capital R only appears to those who wish to seek his presence, but no other method of contact is currently known.[[/footnote]]. As expected, Capital R appeared in the Operation Director's office during her lunch break, and waited for her return. After confirming its identity the operation was explained in full, and Capital R promised that they would be able to procure several options with "sufficient pay", though the rate was not determined before they disappeared. However, Capital R's rates have been flexible in past interactions, and are expected to remain well within MAN's Best Friend's budget.

Ms. Wilson was informed of the interaction, and was told that Capital R is expected to return with results within the following week. She expressed pleasure at this transaction, but had no further input.

__2028/5/5:__ The following document was faxed to the Operation Director:

//Oh Faeowynn, I know you won't be able to fit the animals in here, but I couldn't resist suggesting this lustrous residence to such a beautiful Fae. Besides, you're one of the only Fae I've ever met.//

//I've got to say, though, for a Fae, your name isn't all that unique. You just added an 'owynn' to the end. Alas, that's none of my business. However, I hope you'll consider taking advantage of this fantastic deal-- even if it's not quite what you're looking for at the moment.//

//Now, this next one's a bit of a doozy.//

//So, funny story, I found this vortex just outside of town-- and for some odd reason it sucks up any meat around it-- you know, beef, pork, human, all that kinda stuff. I've been testing, but I haven't tried approaching it with a live animal yet.//

//Perhaps you'd like to experiment around with the property? I know your organization has a surplus of money, plus it would be a shame for you all to pass up this offer.//

//My favorite part about this property is that it's close to a Way, which will make transferring animals to and fro much easier.//

//The private courtyard can easily be repurposed as a holding area for bigger animals, or perhaps we could even build a giant aviary. And then there's all the room for little pets-- it's practically perfect.//

@@@@
//Note: Due to the nature of this plot's soil, mass upkeep is necessary. Please try not to leave the property for more than seven days, lest your crops grow far too large.//
[[/div]]

//I was thinking I could get something built here. It's the cheapest of the batch-- mostly used for farmers and extreme gardening hobbyists-- plus we could sell off the sun & supercharged soil to make a nice chunk of cash.//

//It would allow for plenty of customization on how you want the adoption center arranged as well. However, construction in Three Portlands tends to take a while, as they have to drag materials and heavy machinery through Ways which is a... very strenuous process.//

//All depends on how fast you want the property in your hands, really.//

//Well, that's all. Please contact me if you'd like more information on any of the properties, I'll be there lickity-split.//

Notably, the office's fax machine is only capable of printing in black and white, and no prices were listed except the first. A trimmed document with only the third and fourth options has been delivered to Ms. Wilson, and a tour of the suggested areas has been scheduled for this coming Saturday.

__2028/5/6:__ The tour went well, and Ms. Wilson requested time to think on her decision. She was assured that there is no rush.

__2028/5/8:__ Ms. Wilson predictably selected the fourth option. A second meeting with Capital R, with Ms. Wilson present, has been scheduled for the following Thursday.

__2028/5/11:__ The meeting with Capital R was successful and WWS is now in possession of the property, with financial assistance from the UIU (a repayment at a low interest rate has been established, as planned).  Capital R requested, along with payment, that several silver plates engraved with capital Rs are to be built into the building. Ms. Wilson expressed confusion and suspicion on this point, but was assured that this was normal behavior for transactions of this kind with Capital R. This seemed to put her more or less at ease.

With the property owned, development of the adoption center will soon be [[[Off the Hook|underway]]].
