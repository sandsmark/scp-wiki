**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation agents embedded within highway patrol police units are to maintain a lookout for SCP-5502 occurrences whenever on duty. Agents are permitted to amnesticize any civilians/police officers involved with the occurrence after all relevant information has been extracted from all individuals.

Foundation webcrawlers are to monitor and remove any photography or video footage depicting SCP-5502 occurrences and the media to be investigated and analysed to locate the source of the triggering individual. All individuals that have been determined to have witnessed such media are to be amnesticized.

**Description:** SCP-5502 is a phenomenon in which an individual operating a motor vehicle will temporarily gain the ability to alter baseline reality. The exact conditions that cause SCP-5502 to occur are not known, however the following attributes were present in all occurrences and have been determined to increase the likelihood of SCP-5502 occurring:

* The local time is between 20:00 and 04:00
* It is currently raining
* The vehicle is travelling at 160 km/h or greater
* There are no other moving vehicles within a 0.5 km radius
* The triggering individual had a romantic partnership that recently ended
* The triggering individual has a history of clinical depression

Whenever one or more of these conditions are no longer met, affected individuals will lose their ability to alter reality, and reality will return to baseline levels. Post-incident interviews with affected individuals show that most individuals were incapable of manipulating reality reliably, with unconscious control of such manipulation being consistent across all occurrences of SCP-5502.

The specific accounts of SCP-5502 occurrences by the triggering individuals vary, but elements that are present within all accounts include the presence of bright pink, cyan, and blue lights; the illusion of the affected vehicle travelling in a straight line; and the creation of a humanoid[[footnote]] The actual appearance of the entity varies greatly from individual to individual. [[/footnote]] entity. In addition, all individuals who trigger an SCP-5502 occurrence report feeling happier, more self-assured, or possessing greater clarity of mind after having experienced SCP-5502. Whether this change is anomalous is currently unknown at this time.

**Addendum 5502:** Incident Report and Post-Incident Interview

On 2021/04/02, Dr. Geoff Cassidy, who a month prior was cleared to return to work after losing his right arm during a raid against Site-111 by a hostile group of interest, triggered SCP-5502 on the way back to his residence after his shift had ended. The local police department was contacted and through them, Agent Marcus Hoss. Agent Hoss successfully stopped Dr. Cassidy and promptly recorded the following interview.

> **Interviewer:** Agent Marcus Hoss
> **Interviewee:** Dr. Geoff Cassidy
> **Date of Interview:** 2021/04/02
>
> **<Begin Interview>**
> 
> **Hoss:** Hello, Doctor. I'll admit, I didn't think you were the type to speed.
> 
> **Cassidy:** It's been a long day. I just want to go home.
> 
> **Hoss:** I get that. The interview will begin now.
> 
> **Cassidy:** Very well.
> 
> //Cassidy exits his vehicle, walking over to lean on the right side of the car.//
> 
> **Hoss:** So, in your own words, describe what happened while you were driving.
> 
> **Cassidy:** Like I said, I was driving home from work and saw the multi-colored lights. The researcher in me wanted to take my phone out to record everything, but a humanoid entity appeared and pulled it out for me and started to record in my stead.
> 
> **Hoss:** And what did this humanoid entity look like?
> 
> **Cassidy:** I couldn't make out the body, but its face looked like a male version of my ex-girlfriend, L███.[[footnote]] [**NOTE:** This name has been redacted by request of the Ethics Committee due to privacy concerns.] [[/footnote]]
> 
> **Hoss:** I'm aware of your past relationship with Dr. █████. Sorry about the break-up, by the way.
> 
> **Cassidy:** It's quite alright, Marcus. I'm finally over it now.
> 
> **Hoss:** Nonetheless, we're getting off-topic. Tell me more about the occurrence.
> 
> **Cassidy:** Right. So I couldn't take my hand off the wheel, so I unconsciously reached out with my missing arm and it grew back. I was dumbstruck and couldn't take my eyes off it. I touched it and waved it around, it didn't even register that my hands were off the wheel.
> 
> **Hoss:** And what was the entity doing during all this?
> 
> **Cassidy:** For a while it just did nothing. I guess it was just sort of watching me as I was fiddling with my new limb. The car just kept going straight during all this, and I don't think I saw any other cars, so there wasn't any risk of a crash. But yes, after some time, the entity started to speak to me. It asked me if I still loved L███.
> 
> **Hoss:** What did you say to it if anything?
> 
> **Cassidy:** Well, I don't think it would be all that appropriate if I brought up my answer, but after my reply it told me to "be honest with myself." It then brought up the facts. She broke up with me because of my missing arm. She's moved on. She's just shallow. It then asked me, if she was willing to break up with me over my injury, what other shallow thing would she break up for if I still had my arm?
> 
> **Hoss:** Must have been a lot to take in.
> 
> **Cassidy:** It was, but it was something I had to hear. Part of me wanted to believe that L███ loved me back, that the break-up was only temporary, but I understand now. It sucks, but I understand. And you know what?
> 
> **Hoss:** What?
> 
> **Cassidy:** I've made my peace with it. She deserves someone who can love her best, and so do I.
> 
> //Hoss remains silent.//
> 
> **Cassidy:** So not long after that, you were chasing me down, I stopped, the lights vanished, my arm went away again, and now here we are.
> 
> **Hoss:** I see. Well, I don't have anything to ask you, so this concludes the interview.
> 
> **Cassidy:** Alright. Hope you gleaned something from this. I take it I need to be amnesticized now?
> 
> **Hoss:** Protocol's protocol.
> 
> **Cassidy:** Very well. I'm ready.
> 
> //Cassidy extends his arm.//
> 
> **Hoss:** You seem pretty eager for this.
> 
> **Cassidy:** Sometimes all it takes is a night drive to clear your head and sort out your emotions, anomalously or not. The amnestics will just complete the process.
> 
> **<End Interview>**
