[[span style="color: black;"]]The stories and articles found throughout the SCP wiki can be breathtaking and multilayered, but also complexly hidden between the lines. Even after repeated readthroughs and laconic explanations, sometimes you still don't get the full picture - the context, the nuanced meanings, or the greater story behind everything. The r/SCPDeclassified subreddit is here to help you out and enrich your reading experience by offering clear and readable walkthroughs and essays that delve deep into these multifaceted pieces.

We call our explanation posts **declassifications.** They incorporate a SparkNotes-style summary of the article, along with heavy analysis of the meaning of their plot elements or symbols. We incorporate quotes from the story, knowledge and links with all of Foundation lore, and our own educated speculation about how it all fits together to create a professionally-written, engaging, and exhaustive declassification.

Our subreddit is a hub of content that celebrates and analyzes the great depth of story that the SCP community has created over the years. We host periodic **Ask An Author** features, which allow SCP authors a platform for commenters to ask questions about their writing process, any part of their work, and their contributions to the wiki as a whole. In addition, SCPDeclassified's **Lore Overviews** are helpful and in-depth essays that explore one part of the SCP universe, whether that be the Class of '76, the History of Sarkicism, Pattern Screamers, or a Modern Introduction to the SCP Foundation.

> //And what the everloving FUCK is "DAMMERUNG"?//

**[https://redd.it/6i9gsl SCP-2719 - Inside]**

The pointer tries to access the location in memory of Intestinal Distress; it's Outside, and no longer under the pointer's influence. Whatever the case, Dr. Bright assigns the pointer to Intestinal Distress, puts the doctor Inside it.//

**[https://redd.it/7h14jz SCP-2740 - It Wasn't There]**
> //This SCP can't really be understood in-universe, and that's kind of the point. That nightmare most of us have had: running from something, some unknowable fear, the one Olivia references? This is that bundled with family tragedy and domestic violence.//

**[https://redd.it/7hd2uf SCP-2747 - As below, so above]**
> //Hell, by studying the anafabula so heavily, the Foundation has accelerated its own destruction by giving it so many opportunities to enter their universe, and by creating one in the layer just beneath them.//

**[https://redd.it/7mok5s SCP-2922 - Notes From the Under]**

**[https://redd.it/6onfkk SCP-2943 - In Case Of Emergency, Break Glass]**
> //SCP-2943 is like the time version of SCP-2000. It's a way to save and load; a real-life quicksave. It's the best power, the one thing that was beyond the Foundation, delivered perfectly into their hands.//
