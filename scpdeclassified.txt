[[span style="color: black;"]]The stories and articles found throughout the SCP wiki can be breathtaking and multilayered, but also complexly hidden between the lines. Even after repeated readthroughs and laconic explanations, sometimes you still don't get the full picture - the context, the nuanced meanings, or the greater story behind everything. The r/SCPDeclassified subreddit is here to help you out and enrich your reading experience by offering clear and readable walkthroughs and essays that delve deep into these multifaceted pieces.

We call our explanation posts **declassifications.** They incorporate a SparkNotes-style summary of the article, along with heavy analysis of the meaning of their plot elements or symbols. We incorporate quotes from the story, knowledge and links with all of Foundation lore, and our own educated speculation about how it all fits together to create a professionally-written, engaging, and exhaustive declassification.

Our subreddit is a hub of content that celebrates and analyzes the great depth of story that the SCP community has created over the years. We host periodic **Ask An Author** features, which allow SCP authors a platform for commenters to ask questions about their writing process, any part of their work, and their contributions to the wiki as a whole. In addition, SCPDeclassified's **Lore Overviews** are helpful and in-depth essays that explore one part of the SCP universe, whether that be the Class of '76, the History of Sarkicism, Pattern Screamers, or a Modern Introduction to the SCP Foundation.

[https://redd.it/6y27ab SCP-1272 - Slow Motion Catastrophe]

**[https://redd.it/7fj5ul SCP-2357 - The Perfect SCP]**

**[https://redd.it/7iovqu SCP-2400 - Temporal Dilation Facility]**

**[https://redd.it/a2d4sk SCP-2470 - The Void Singularity]**

**[https://redd.it/6xhacb SCP-2700 - Teleforce]**
> //Worse, it seems that the core is containing Omega, and if that containment were ever to break, the reversed entropy would spread across the entire universe, reversing time back to the Big Bang. It's set to do just that, breaking its own containment in 2234.//

**[https://redd.it/6mnff4 SCP-2718 - What Happens After]**
> //And what the everloving FUCK is "DAMMERUNG"?//

**[https://redd.it/6i9gsl SCP-2719 - Inside]**
> //Someone tries to make intestinal distress Inside Dr. Bright, but for some reason it doesn't work. The pointer tries to access the location in memory of Intestinal Distress; it's Outside, and no longer under the pointer's influence. Whatever the case, Dr. Bright assigns the pointer to Intestinal Distress, puts the doctor Inside it.//

**[https://redd.it/7h14jz SCP-2740 - It Wasn't There]**
> //This SCP can't really be understood in-universe, and that's kind of the point. That nightmare most of us have had: running from something, some unknowable fear, the one Olivia references? This is that bundled with family tragedy and domestic violence.//

**[https://redd.it/7hd2uf SCP-2747 - As below, so above]**
> //Hell, by studying the anafabula so heavily, the Foundation has accelerated its own destruction by giving it so many opportunities to enter their universe, and by creating one in the layer just beneath them.//

**[https://redd.it/77apj4 SCP-2764 - The Eldritch Antarctic]**
> //He’s being followed by an eldritch horror and mentally tormented by it at the same time, but he pitches a fucking tent and reads a book.//

**[https://redd.it/6lns3e SCP-2798 - This Dying World]**
> //The next one is attempting to destroy SCP-001. First, it's approved, only to be rejected due to being "Impossible." This is where we get the sense that this is a big issue.//

**[https://redd.it/7c3sjo SCP-2905 - A Web Wrapped With Roses and Poisons]**

**[https://redd.it/7mok5s SCP-2922 - Notes From the Under]**
> //In conclusion this skip isn’t just about a shitty little brain implant, it’s about love, betrayal, and doing everything in your power to pursue what you think is right.//

**[https://redd.it/6pbjff SCP-2935 - O, Death]**

**[https://redd.it/6onfkk SCP-2943 - In Case Of Emergency, Break Glass]**
> //SCP-2943 is like the time version of SCP-2000. It's a way to save and load; a real-life quicksave. It's the best power, the one thing that was beyond the Foundation, delivered perfectly into their hands.//

**[https://redd.it/6qib0e SCP-2996 - ERROR / ERROR]**

> //Despite knowing its father can't read the document, and despite knowing the document will likely be deleted by the first affected staff member that comes across it, the object is still going to continue posting and reposting the document until it dies or ceases being anomalous. That's determination right there.//

**[https://redd.it/70my32 SCP-3443 - Placeholder]**

**[https://redd.it/apg9mv Dr. Gears' Proposal - The Prototype]**
> //This suggests some kind of juvenility, as if whoever is writing this is some sort of ameteur, or perhaps they were rushing to get it done. As we’ll see later, both of these will be the case.//

**[https://redd.it/6m5maf Dr. Mackenzie's Proposal - The Legacy]**
> //A few points to note here: why would this technology “hasten” the process? Why does he have to kill presumably the Foundation when they do this? How does he do it? Surely he can’t kill the entire Foundation by himself.//

**[https://redd.it/81n8cy Roget's Proposal - Keter Duty ]**
> //The anomaly is extremely plain of a surface level - a facility with Keters that contain each other - but on top of that is a rich mystery implying some very deep truths about the nature of the universe and the origin of the anomalous.//

**[https://redd.it/6k43jp djkaktus's Proposal I - The Children]**
> //And thus ends this 001 proposal, which deals not truly with the Foundation's creation, but its ultimate philosophy and purpose, and as a haunting account of madness in its early days, and at its very heart.//

**[https://redd.it/7f3tlh TwistedGears-Kaktus Proposal - The Broken God]**
> //This next part begins with one hell of a picture.//
> 
> //Let that sink in. That’s 160 million square kilometers of land just gone. That’s roughly half of Germany, or the entire state of Florida, just straight up being removed.//
> 
> //What the fuck happened in Mexico?//

**[https://redd.it/6lns3e Kalinin's Proposal - Past and Future]**
> //Have I mentioned we're absolutely fucked?//

**[https://redd.it/6nk432 Wrong Proposal - The Consensus]**
> //The consensus has changed: the Fifth Occult War does not exist; it is no longer agreed as such. A revote has been put in place, and SCP-001 has changed, because the consensus said so. There was no CK-Class scenario, no anything. Just a lot of public opinion that it never existed.//

**[https://redd.it/6cgo24 S. D. Locke's Proposal - When Day Breaks]**
> //Thuds, from the flesh masses, bang against the door. SCP-001-A has found you, and they will take you. You are cornered, with no hope of escape. It breaks down the door, and you do not struggle as you are carried into the waiting light.//

**[https://redd.it/ccpfzb Tanhony - Dead Men]**
> //Part 3: I’m Running Out Of Part Names, But People Die.//

**[https://redd.it/9evpe9 Tufto's Proposal - The Scarlet King]**
> //The O5 council doesn’t understand the law of howling and thinks that changing the classification from Keter to Safe will do the job. But that won’t stop the Scarlet King from coming. Nothing will.//

**[https://redd.it/aiftab djkaktus's Proposal II - Atonement]**
> //From their perspective, they've just been duped into letting a malevolent entity destroy the multiverse, when in reality they are the ones responsible for the doom that will eventually befall them.//

**[http://redd.it/91f315 The Great Hippo's Proposal (feat. PeppersGhost) - A Good Boy]**
> //Now comes the home stretch. What will our mechanical canine do now that he has complete control of the Foundation?//
> 
> //One word: Magic!//

**[https://redd.it/adviul Captain Kirby's Proposal - O5-13]**
> //If you're the only nonanomalous person on an anomalous council, who's really normal?//

**[https://redd.it/ccuja5 Pedantique - Fishhook]**
> //TL;DR: SCROLL DOWN TO INSTANTLY DIE//

**[https://redd.it/bmoryv not_a_seagull's Proposal - The Sky Above The Port]**
