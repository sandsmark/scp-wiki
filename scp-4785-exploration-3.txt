> **Researcher Dylan:** //<Mid-sentence.>// —cause we— wait, one of the lights on the recorder just— did I have the recorder off the entire time?
> 
> **TSATPWTCOTTTADC.aic:** ✔️ Affimative. ✔️
> 
> //<Researcher Dylan sighs.>//
> 
> **Researcher Dylan:** I'll start from the beginning. I went through the door with the square on it from the cabinet last time, and I ended up back in the big city. I found a tunnel that went to the big skyscraper in the middle of the city, which didn't have any boards, for whatever reason.
> 
> Elevator was broken— well, not broken, but TSAT kept telling me that it wasn't stable. I took the stairs, but the upper floors were blocked by the web shit, and I know I don't want to touch that. Don't want another one of the lizards chasing me again. Anyways, I went downstairs, and there was a big hole in the concrete floor, and I climbed down that and now I'm in this big secret lab, like the basement back at Site-31.
> 
> //<Pause.>//
> 
> I think that's everything. Anyways, It's dark in here, but we found a terminal, and TSAT's trying to hack it to get the lights on. I've been standing here for the past few minutes, waiting for—
> 
> **TSATPWTCOTTTADC.aic:** ✔ Vulnerability Found, Login Completed ✔ — 💡 Activating lights...
> 
> //<Click from lights activating.>//
> 
> **Researcher Dylan:** Now I can see the rest of the room... It's pretty white, sterile, except for the green web, which I didn't see coming in. I'm lucky I avoided it. There's some doors, but they're blocked with the green web. The terminal's in front of a window, looking into a testing room, from the looks of it. It's labeled "Greenroot Holdings Inc." I don't see how you're supposed to get in.
> 
> **TSATPWTCOTTTADC.aic:** 🔎 Mainframe analysis complete, executable program found. ❓ Should I execute it?
> 
> **Researcher Dylan:** Go ahead. Let's see if this still works.
> 
> //<Whirring noises, presumably from the machine activating.>//
> 
> **Researcher Dylan:** Okay, there's a, uh, chemistry set, that came out of a hole in the wall, inside of the test chamber. There's something red and clear in the vials, I'm not a chemist, I can't tell what it is. Another hole opened up on the other side of the room; if something's supposed to be coming out of it, it's broken.
> 
> There's something extending out of the table holding the chemistry set. It's like a syringe, but it looks longer. It's still... extending out.
> 
> //<Whirring noises for 5 seconds, then the noises suddenly cease.>//
> 
> **Researcher Dylan:** It... it stopped. I don't know—
> 
> **Mechanical Voice:** //<Loud.>// ERROR: SUBJECT NOT PRESENT WITHIN CHAMBER. PLEASE REACTIVATE TESTING ONCE CHAMBER IS FULLY OCCUPIED.
> 
> **Researcher Dylan:** Wait! Shit, shit—
> 
> //<High-pitched roaring from one of the hallways, similar to that of the lizard-like creature from the initial incursion.>//
> 
> **Researcher Dylan:** I need to hide, need to hide...
> 
> //<Metal banging, followed by Researcher Dylan hyperventilating. Footsteps, combined with a wet, squishy sound, come from the room.>//
> 
> //<The creature then leaves the room. Researcher Dylan attempts to exit his hiding place, but it will not open.>//
> 
> **Researcher Dylan:** It— it left behind more of the weird green stuff, like a spider. Webbed the cabinet shut. I guess that's, that's what it's about—
> 
> //<A shout from Researcher Dylan, followed by the sudden deactivation of the audio recorder. The audio recorder is reactivated 1 minute and 36 seconds later.>//
> 
> **Researcer Dylan:** —it, my arm, my arm... leaned backwards, and I fell into some... I can't tell. I'm back in the slime room. It somehow took me back to the slime room, what the hell? Where did I come from?
