**Item #:** SCP-2129

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2129 is to be kept at all times in a specially-designed, vacuum-sealed container with thirty-centimeters thick walls of Titanium shielding. Another twenty centimeters-thick layer of Zetix fabric is to cover the entire room for added protection. The container must be connected to a constant oxygen supply, and must be emptiable of all oxygen in less than ten seconds.

A ten meters-long, two meters-wide corridor of the same materials and thickness is to connect the container to the rest of the Site █ facility. Said corridor must be emptiable of all oxygen in the same manner.

The container must be monitored by no less than six thermal cameras at all times without exception, and be equipped by four loudspeakers allowing communication in Morse. All equipment must be encased in five centimeters of blast-resistant laminated glass. All experiments and communications with SCP-2129 must take place in blast-resistant facilities.

No personnel is allowed to enter SCP-2129's container while it hasn't been de-oxygenated under any circumstances. All personnel are to wear custom-designed, sealed bomb suits including oxygen reserves when entering SCP-2129's container. Four of these suits are stored in suit storage units at the entrance of the corridor leading to the entity's container, and should be replaced under the shortest delays if damaged.

SCP-2129 is to be kept in its dormant state at all times, unless an experiment calls for it to be active: in this case, the container should be filled with as little oxygen as necessary to allow the experiment to proceed.

In the event of a containment breach, Procedure Perkele-1 is to be initiated under the briefest delays. Near Site █ has been built a 150 meters-deep well reinforced with the same Titanium and Zetix composing SCP-#'s container's walls, sealed with a vacuum-tight steel door and hidden by the surrounding vegetation: at the bottom of this well have been placed approximatively twenty (20) tons of ANFO. SCP-2129's demeanor will push it to fly down the well, as it will be attracted by the large quantity of explosives: the well will then be flooded with both a set of pumps and Foundation personnel trained for the exercise. SCP-2129, once confirmed to be neutralized and docile, is to be retrieved from the bottom of the well by a team of three staff members specifically trained to retrieve SCP-2129 under such circumstances.

**Description:** SCP-2129 is an invisible entity manifesting itself by a continuous stream of detonations. It possesses the ability to levitate and fly in three dimensions, and is able to reach speeds of up to 152 kilometers per hour. Detonations happen continuously while the creature is moving, with a general frequency of two per seconds, though the creature has shown itself to be able to generate up to six per seconds in exceptional conditions. The explosions' energy output has been estimated to be in the neighbourhood of 5 gigajoules, or the equivalent of 1.2 tons of TNT.

It has been theorized that detonating is either its means of energy production or a side-effect of it. Likewise, study of the creature's flight patterns have shown changes of directions correlated to its detonations: the entity also modulates its speed by changing the strenght and frequency of the detonations. It is unknown if the creature could reach speeds superior to its highest recorded one, or if higher speeds would impair its ability to direct itself.

While it is invisible to the naked eye, thermal cameras show, in the absence of explosions, an oblong, serpentine body approximatively a meter long, with no other discernible characteristics. Experiments to discover more about the characteristics entity's physical body are currently being devised.

SCP-2129 necessitates air to detonate: it will detonate continuously until it has consumed all the available air, after which it will enter a dormant state and only resume activity when more oxygen is available. It is unknown what process the creature uses to create the detonation, as no trace of any known explosive as ever been found to have been emitted by it. The entity appears to be attracted by explosives and explosives substances, and displays an ability to sense them through hard surfaces by an unknown process.

Due to this, complete deoxygenation is the most effective way of containing the entity, as it is then forced to enter its dormant state. It however does not seem to be aware of the existence of explosives that do not require oxygen to detonate, as it did not actively seek out a container of acetylene (which can detonate in the absence of oxygen) when one was transported into its cell.

SCP-2129 also appears to possess sentience. This is evidenced by its ability to modulate the strenght and lenght of the detonations it emits to communicate in Portuguese using a rough, sometimes inexact version of morse code: it is able to communicate in short sentences in this manner, and is able to understand messages communicated in the same manner. 

Extended conversations have revealed that SCP-2129 displays a generally cooperative but melancholic demeanor, mostly expressing frustration concerning its containment and wishes to be released and made able to roam freely.

SCP-2129 was captured on █-█-20█, following its destruction of the coastal town of [REDACTED], Brazil, causing the deaths of ██ inhabitants and injuring ██ others. The incident was publicly attributed to a terrorist attack by explosives, and efforts to fabricate proof corroborating this version of the facts is still ongoing. All known survivors have been administered standard amnesia treatment. The area should be closed-off under the pretense of an ongoing investigation: civilians and possible investigators alike should be discouraged from the premises politely but firmly.

**Addendum:** Following multiple denied requests of the sorts, all personnel requesting to see if SCP-076 or SCP-682 can indeed "wrestle with explosions" are to be stripped of their clearance rights and put on container cleaning duty.
