Instances are to be relocated to containment at Site-██. Testing has revealed SCP-3382-A instance are non-anomalous in nature, and personnel are authorised to disassemble and repurpose material in the interest of storage. Foundation webcrawler DjinnSpotter is to monitor social media and forums for mention of the name or number featured on SCP-3382-A instances, and flagged posts are to be deleted with class-A amnestics administered to all involved individuals.

**Description:** SCP-3382 refers to the anomalous appearance of billboards across the North American state of Arkansas, designated SCP-3382-A, featuring advertisements for a phone hotline titled "Ill wishes", designated SCP-3382-B. 

SCP-3382-A instances feature the name of the charity as well as a phone number [[footnote]]Despite an Arkansas area code, attempts to trace calls have failed to yield a location.[[/footnote]] and the slogan "Dreams fulfilled for the terminally ill". Frequency of SCP-3382-A appearances correspond with the proximity to the center of the state, with manifestations occurring at least once every ██ days within a 10km radius. Local city council members do not recall authorising the construction of suspect billboards and cannot recall how long they have been present.

Children under the age of 10 who dial the number on SCP-3382-A are greeted by a female voice[[footnote]]Voice analysis returned a match to Agatha Hawksburn, an Arkansas cancer patient who disappeared in mysterious circumstances connected to SCP-████ in 1983.[[/footnote]], and asked for their wish. Subjects who have already made a wish, or subjects over the age of 10, will instead be alerted that the number is disconnected. Once a wish has been made SCP-3382-B will wish subjects a nice day and the call will end, with the specifics of the wish actualising within seven days[[footnote]] Refer to addendum 3382.t.1 for testing details.[[/footnote]].
