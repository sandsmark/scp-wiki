**Item #:** SCP-440

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** As of 6/19/████, the majority of SCP-440 in existence is located in Site-█'s Large-Scale Wilderness Observation Dome (LSWOD). Standard LSWOD security protocols apply, and all observers and items placed inside the Dome are to be completely sanitized of SCP-440. The bottle in which SCP-440 was first discovered (hereafter referred to as SCP-440-Prime), is currently located in a security cabinet on Site-█.

**Description:** SCP-440 is a sample of fine-grain sand (sand grain of approximately 90 micrometers) that is chemically identical to typical silica-based sand. Its only difference is that it functions as if it is in a microgravity environment, regardless of the gravitational forces acting upon it. SCP-440 was found in a small glass bottle with no label on it, filled with a viscous fluid that, presumably, weighs down SCP-440 and prevents the grains from touching.

SCP-440 is capable of giving this property to other other samples of sand, essentially transforming it into SCP-440 itself[[footnote]] Sands with a particle size of >1mm do not gain this ability. [[/footnote]]. The process governing this conversion is believed to be based on contact, requiring SCP-440 to be introduced into a sample of unconverted sand via compressed air. The rate of conversion from basic sand to 440 is also unknown, but it is understood that approximately 30% (by mass) of 'seed sand' does not convert.

When SCP-440 reaches specific levels of concentration within an environment, a SCP-440 based ecosystem forms. Because all SCP-440-based objects (environmental and sapient) are in constant gravitational freefall, there is less evolutionary pressure on gravity-defying traits.

**Experiment Log**

03/10/████:  In Examination Booth #6642, 2g of SCP-440 injected into 4L of fine-grain sand via air-powered hose.

03/18/████: Sand-to-SCP-440 conversion ceases; approximately 1.2L of sand remains unconverted. Small (.5 to 1cm) nodules of SCP-440 appear, floating aimlessly in the enclosure.

4/31/████: Request to expand experiment approved by O5-█ to Examination Room #6135. 12L of fine-grain sand added to the room.

5/10/████: 3L of fine-grain sand remains unconverted. Larger rocks (average size: 10cm) float through the enclosure. First discovery of 440-based life occur, hereafter referred to as SCP-440-1. SCP-440-1 (colloquially called "dustbugs"), are 6cm entities somewhat resembling brine shrimp. Specimens of SCP-440-1 spend their lives using their rough 'teeth' to shear off sections of rocks for consumption. Study of SCP-440-1 specimens reveal they are composed entirely of undifferentiated SCP-440.  Experiment transfer to Animal Enclosure #42 approved, and enclosure is re-seeded with ██L of fine-grain sand.

6/7/████: Floating rocks (average size: 41 cm) compose the majority of the enclosure. SCP-440-1 population increases dramatically, kept in check by a new entity type, hereafter SCP-440-2. SCP-440-2s are 75cm long entities resembling rocky cephalopods, using their tentacles to push themselves off the environment to move. After much deliberation, O5-█ ordered Animal Enclosure #42 shipped to Site-█ for expansion purposes, owing to that Site's unused Large-Scale Wilderness Observation Dome. As with the previous transfer, approximately [DATA EXPUNGED] of fine-grain sand was placed in the Dome.

9/19/████: Rocks in environment have an average size of 6m. Populations of SCP-440-1 and -2 have grown as projected. Over the past week, four instances of a new apex predator, SCP-440-3, is documented. SCP-440-3s are 1.5m long entities with a snake-like body and a mouth shaped like a conventional rock crusher. Two SCP-440-3s are killed before reaching full maturity (one from another SCP-440-3, another from attacking a group SCP-440-2). The survivors establish a territorial system within the LSWOD. It is assumed that SCP-440-3 specimens are composed of SCP-440, but capturing a 440-3 sample has proven difficult, owing to hostility by 440-3s.

10/08/████: Permission to seek expansion for the environment denied by O5-█.
