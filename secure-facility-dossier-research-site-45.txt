[[/div]]

* **Checkpoint Garradin:**  This is the land-based checkpoint located at the very end of Leeuwin road, where the main blast doors are located.  A security force remains on-duty to check incoming and outgoing traffic from the site at all times.  This is the only entrance to Research Site-45 from land.  The checkpoint also includes substantial underground living quarters for most of the  working staff at Research Site-45. 

* **Funicular Rail and Tunnel:**  Past the land-based checkpoint is the funicular rail/platform system which descends from Checkpoint Garradin at a 30 degree incline down to 170m below sea level due west, under the extending continental shelf and Indian Ocean.  Another 8.5km due west by rail via underground tunnel will reach the entrance to the main shaft of Research Site-45.  Within the tunnel are high explosive charges placed every 200m within the walls in case of a catastrophic emergency.  

* **Checkpoint Wahan:**  This is the underground checkpoint in the Indian Ocean that connects to the main access shaft below which then connects to all the subsequent Blocks that make up Research Site-45.  This is considered the command center of the installation below as it controls all surveillance and lockdown controls from this point.  There is an underwater lift that ascends upwards to reach the Off-Shore Platform above.  The checkpoint is also equipped with inflatable escape pods in case of a sudden evacuation.

[[include component:image-block name=rigged.png|caption=Off-shore platform seen from surface.]]

* **Off-Shore Platform (aka "The Rig"):**  The off-shore rig is located approximately 9km from the coast due south from Checkpoint Garradin.  It is positioned directly on top of the main underground shaft from which the entirety of Research Site-45 is built around.  The rig is by all appearances to the civilian populace an off-shore drilling platform.  The rig serves as an MTF naval staging point and heavily fortified defensive/offensive countermeasure against external attacks or breaches.  It is also equipped with a Scantron Reality Anchor (SRA) for maintaining a baseline Hume for the installation below.  Other equipment/features include:
 * (2) Phalanx CIWS
 * (4) 57mm Bofor guns
 * (2) Quad Harpoon Launchers
 * Sea Viper air defence system, with a 48-cell Sylver A50 VLS, for mix of up to 48:
  * Aster 15 missiles (range 1.7–30 km)
  * Aster 30 missiles (range 3–120 km)
 * On-deck helipad
 * SAMPSON multi-function air tracking radar (Type 1045)
 * Raytheon omni-band radar
 * MFS-7000 sonar array

* **Main Access Shaft:**  The shaft is 30m in diameter which houses of 2 elevators for personnel, 1 larger utility elevator for equipment, and an adjacent stairwell for emergencies.  From here, staff can access all subsequent Blocks of the facility.  Each Block is a compartmentalized multi-level structure that are self-sustaining with its own air ventilation and power systems.  In the event that one Block is breached/cut-off, the other Blocks are not jeopardized and can still function.  The entrance of each block is equipped with a large bulkhead door that automatically closes in the event of a containment breach.  Blocks do not have a secondary emergency access for security reasons.  In the event that the Main Access Shaft is compromised, Checkpoint Garradin is permitted to blow the rail tunnel leading to the surface.  This makes the shaft itself an incredibly critical piece to the installation.

* **Administration (aka "Penthouse"):**  Administration is connected to Checkpoint Wahan via stairs instead of the Main Access Shaft.  Located here are the offices of the Site Director, Site Superintendent, Server Room, and a Conference Center.  High level meetings are occasionally held here.

[[include component:image-block name=lounge.jpg|caption=A-Block staff lounge]]
[[/div]]

* **A-BLOCK (aka "The Bed & Breakfast"):** __There are no anomalies contained or permitted within this Block.__  The Block houses the majority of the D-Class stocks within individual cells and personnel offices.  Medical testing, screening, and operations are also conducted here on both staff and D-class.  A limited amount of individual offices are also located here near the entrance itself, as well as the cafeteria, locker rooms, and staff lounge.  This particular Block is situated near the top of the Main Access Shaft for faster evacuation if need be since the majority of essential personnel operate there.  

* **B-BLOCK (aka "The Freak Show"):** This area is considered the Humanoid Containment/Research Area.  B-Block is equipped with it's own extensive medical and laboratory facilities for autopsies, surgery, or other purposes as needed.  Here anomalies that can be stored in humanoid cells under normal conditions are kept for study, observation, etc.  Some non-humanoid anomalies are kept here as an exception, as access to the extensive medical facilities is a required necessity.  Anomalies contained here include: [[[SCP-321]]], [[[SCP-1598]]], [[[SCP-2401]]] 

[[include component:image-block name=lab.jpg|caption=C-Block Laboratory 3]]

* **C-BLOCK (aka "The Toy Box"):** This area is used as a Non-Humanoid Containment/Research Area.  There are extensive containment chambers of varying size used to store such items/entities, each equipped with a small adjacent customized laboratory suited to research that particular object.  There are large empty rooms along the very end of the Block designated specifically for testing purposes.  Most weaponization projects are conducted within this Block and several anomalous weapons are stored within the Block's armory.  Anomalies contained here include: [[[SCP-127]]], [[[SCP-2424]]], [[[SCP-1577]]], [[[SCP-439]]] 

* **D-BLOCK (aka "The Vault"):** This Block contains many anomalous items or items affected by anomalous means and are stored here in high security vaults that aren't specifically being researched but deemed potentially valuable to future research.  Specially designated archival reports/data of a particularly sensitive nature are also stored here for safekeeping as well as backup servers.  Of all the Blocks in Research Site-45, it has the lowest security presence.  Anomalies contained here include: [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1471 SCP-1471-# items], [[[SCP-2501]]]

* **E-BLOCK (aka "The Cellar"):** This is used as a separate containment area for highly dangerous and/or hostile anomalies.  The Block itself is connected via a 1.5km tunnel from the bottom of the Main Access Shaft, a considerable distance from the installation.  E-Block is the only Block that can be sealed with high explosive charges placed within the tunnel in the event of a catastrophic breach.  Access is restricted to most personnel.  Anomalies contained here include: [[[SCP-466]]], [DATA EXPUNGED]

++ Notable Containment Incidents
[[/=]]

> [[[SCP-1905]]]
> Sep. 1999
> 
> SCP-1905 was mistakenly loaded during research, causing an instance of SCP-1905-1 (resembling an //Ankylosaurus magniventris//) to manifest within the laboratory itself.  The entity broke through several labs, damaging a load bearing pillar and a utility line, effectively causing a black-out within C-Block for 12 hours and prompting an evacuation.  No injuries were reported.  SCP-1905 and the researcher on-duty were immediately transferred off-site. 

> [[[SCP-1598]]]
> Nov. 2009
> 
> SCP-1598 was involved in 2 isolated incidents within B-Block.  Both incidents caused extensive damage to a laboratory and adjacent offices.  In its most recent breach, SCP-1598 was able to descend down the Main Access Shaft and into D-Block, where it caused additional damage to an archival vault.  Countermeasures are now in place to prevent further incidents. 

> [[[SCP-466]]]
> Aug. 2014
> 
> SCP-466 was located in B-Block prior to Aug. 2014 until its most recent incident where it attacked and killed several personnel during an emergency procedure to save its own life.  Since then it has evolved into a much more hostile entity and has been interned in E-Block since.  To date, it continues to show hostile and aggressive behavior.  Plans to move SCP-466 to a more secure containment facility are currently being proposed. 

> [[[SCP-2403]]]
> UNKNOWN
> 
> SCP-2403 was discovered haphazardly by researchers during an evacuation drill within the east stairwell.  It is theorized to be a purely random and isolated phenomenon.  It is unknown when the phenomenon started or how long it has been active.  Currently this section of stairwell is blocked off until further study.

++ Additional Information

Research Site-45 was first conceptualized by General William Pendergast in 1973 under the premise for a stand-alone site dedicated to researching anomalies for Foundation applications, be it offense, defense, or other.  Construction started in late 1979 along the southwestern Australian coast using large tunnel-boring machines (TBMs) to excavate the tons of earth needed for the rail and elevator systems.  Further excavation and blasting were used to create the large stope "Blocks" that were later established as Blocks A through D.  

The drilling platform above was bought from an Australian government salvage contractor and hauled out to its current location.  There it was stripped and modified to house multiple weapon systems and security measures to protect Research Site-45 from a possible naval attack or breach.  Because of its strategic location, several parts of the rig were converted for storing fuel and munitions as the O5 council deemed it as a staging point within the Indian Ocean for naval MTFs, specifically MTF Gamma-6 and MTF Tau-11.

Construction completed in 1984.  In the following years, several pieces of critical tech were developed in Research Site-45.  Research Site-45 was also involved in the [[[Project Heimdall]]] initiative developing several potential countermeasures for Foundation use.  Research Site-45 has also served as an MTF supply depot and staging area for several incidents within the Australian and Indo-Pacific waters, most notably assisting with the prolonged engagement with [[[SCP-1264]]], which thankfully ended in its current containment in the Pacific Ocean.

The addition of E-Block was built in 1999 originally as an annex.  However, after several incidents that nearly compromised the site, it was decided to convert E-Block as an auxiliary high security containment area.  Since its construction, SCP related incidents have dropped by 32% in the last 15 years.  Because of the limited capacity and space of Research Site-45, it was never intended to operate as permanent containment.  Over the years, hundreds of cataloged anomalies have been transferred in and out from the installation for their benefits of being researched and utilized by the Foundation.  This is still how Research Site-45 operates today.
