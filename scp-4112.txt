**Item #:** SCP-4000

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4000 is to be kept in Site-120, Containment Wing A, Keter-class reality suppression locker 6B. No additional security for locker 6B is required, though staff should be aware of Containment Wing A's standard security precautions, which include, but are not limited to:

* Various Berryman-Langford memetic kill agents, administered on failing to provide proper identification.
* Automated lethal deterrents, activated upon failing to provide proper identification.
* Other minor safety precautions, listed in the site dossier.

Personnel are to ensure they possess proper clearance before doing so. A list of qualified personnel can be found below.

**Description:** SCP-4000 is a lyre, constructed of tortoiseshell, bovine intestinal strings, leather, and other assorted apparently non-anomalous items. Radiocarbon dating has placed this object's origin at sometime earlier than 3000 BC, though testing has proven difficult due to the object's first anomalous property: excessive durability. SCP-4000 is capable of resisting all instruments shy of those with diamond tips, in all components. Separated components are attracted to each other, and will, with a speed of up to 10 kph, reconfigure themselves if dismantled, including fragments and pieces reattaching to each other, with no visible join or crease.

SCP-4000's second and more dangerous property manifests when a user touches the object with intent to make a sound. Such movements include strumming, tapping, and more. If said user completes this while intending to produce an effect, whatever effect the operator has in mind will occur, regardless of impossibility, depending upon the complexity of the performance. Previous tests have manifested objects, removed objects from existence, changed the laws of reality, temporally transported the user, and more.

##e6e6e6|**Item #:** 4000##

##cccccc|**Danger Value:** 5/5##

##b3b3b3|**Safety Precautions:** Item 4000 is to be kept with the Administrator at all times. Item 4000 is not to be removed from the Administrator's## ##878181|possession at any time, at penalty of erasure from reality. Should the Administrator have any need to remove Item 4000 from his person, a## ##737373|copy of the Administrator will be given the device and no one else.##

**Destruction Protocols:** N/A.

**Appearance:** Item 4000 is an electric guitar, more specifically, a Gibson ES-335, white coloration. No physical alterations or modifications can be observed. Sourcing the model to a specific maker has proved fruitless (no identifying markings or model numbers are present on the object), and testing has proved difficult due to the objects anomalous properties.

**Anomalies:**

* **Excessive Durability:** Item 4000 is capable of resisting all instruments shy of those with diamond tips, in all components. Separated components are attracted to each other, and will, with a speed of up to 5 miles an hour, reconfigure themselves if dismantled, including fragments and pieces reattaching to each other, with no visible join or crease.

* **Provides Artificial Ontokinesis:** Item 4000's second and more dangerous property manifests when a user touches the object with intent to make a sound. Such movements include strumming, tapping, and more. If said user completes this while intending to produce an effect, whatever effect the operator has in mind will occur, regardless of impossibility, depending upon the complexity of the performance. Previous tests have manifested objects, removed objects from existence, changed the laws of reality, temporally transported the user, and more.

**Additional Documents:**

[[collapsible show="+ Level 3 Research Team 9's Notes." hide="- Level 3 Research Team 9's Notes."]]

**Voice logs:** Item 4000

**Entry ██/██/██:**

//"Mantell's log. Please, do not distribute the following findings. We in Research Team 9 believe there is more to Item 4000 than meets the eye. Something, something just doesn't add up in the documentation for Item 4000. I've checked its history as far as my clearance would allow, it doesn't say how the object came into the possession of the Administrator. Not only that, he seems to suddenly lack skills and experience one would expect from someone in his position. Additionally, despite being the object most important to the Administrator, the item is not numerically first in the archives of the Federation. Further investigation is... pending."//

**Entry ██/██/██:**

//"Harding's log. I followed though with Researcher Mantell's request to do some snooping. Turns out, there's a containment vessel in our very own Zone-120 logged to contain the item, but it's unlisted in the safety document. That's the very same safety document very specifically stating it ought to be with the big man at all times. Very suspicious, I'll be conducting measurements inside the empty locker later this week.//

//I don't like the sound of this. It's starting to look like shady business is going with that guy. And if he is involved in something like that, we could all be in danger. Harding out."//

**Entry ██/██/██:**

//"Harding's log. There's been a... an enormous uncatalogued reality event in the near vicinity of locker 6B within the past month. We have conclusive evidence enough to reckon that our current Administrator has... artificially inserted himself into his position through use of Item 4000. Our findings will be reported to the Council of Syrinx posthaste."//
