الموت لأمريكا! إيزيس عظيمة
> **Foreword:** On 02/14/2017, another video producer, ███ ██████, discovered several of their videos affected by SCP-3006. This transcription is for an iteration of the interview. The original has been lost, or may never have existed. 
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Dr. Krang:** Can you state your name, for the record, and spell it?
> 
> **███ ██████:** Sure. //(nervous laughter)// Kinda like a newspaper interview, I guess. I'm ███ ██████, █ █ █, █ █ █ █ █ █. But you already knew that, right?
> 
> **Dr. Krang:** When did you first become aware of the videos?
> 
> **███ ██████:** Someone linked it to me on Twitter, I think. It's weird, seeing people you know get fucked up like that. You feel bad, but they're just little computer people, right? So not really a big deal. That's what I thought, at least.
> 
> **Dr. Krang:** How long did it take for you to discover the videos you were featured in?
> 
> **███ ██████:** Yeah, well, y'know, it was one of the suggested videos. God. Dude, I just... it's not something I want to describe. So I tried reporting it and... now I'm here with you guys.
> 
> **Dr. Krang:** How many times did you watch the video?
> 
> **███ ██████:** I don't know. At a certain point you lose track. Because it's funny, right? It's weird seeing a ton of yourself. I didn't know what else to do there, to be perfectly honest.
> 
> **Dr. Krang:** What do you mean?
> 
> **███ ██████:** Well, it's just... I don't know why I went. Felt like... you ever do something, and then when you're done you don't even know why you did it? That's what it felt like. Almost like it was a dream or something.
> 
> **Dr. Krang:** What were you expecting to happen?
> 
> **███ ██████:** From what they told me... well, they said it'd be like they were in there with each other forever. But it's not a them, it's //me//. There were thousands of me, and they're dead now. Crushed. Viscera //puree//. One of the eyes floated by, and I saw myself in it dude. That's fucked.
> 
> //At this point both the interviewer and interviewee become aware of several humanoids identical to themselves present in the room, standing around the edges.//
> 
> **███ ██████:** Jesus!
> 
> //Several iterations of Dr. Krang immediately attempt to exit the room, but are unsuccessful. All instances begin fighting one another, while the copies of ███ ██████ congregate in the opposite side of the room around the original interviewee, covering their faces with their hands.//
> 
> **███ ██████:** Get away! Stop! Help!
> 
> //Copies of ███ ██████ begin violently ripping flesh and skin off of him, while copies of Dr. Krang do the same. This violence continues until there are only one iteration of each left. It is unknown whether or not these are the originals. Video playback ends with both attempting unsuccessfully to exit the interview area.//
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** Subject was issued Class-C amnestics at the interview. The SCP-3006 anomaly continues to persist, and several other instances of SCP-3006 have been subsequently documented in Foundation video archives. Classification upgrade to Keter is under consideration.
