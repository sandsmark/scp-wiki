**Item Lost:** SCP-████

**Item Retrieved:** SCP-████, in active state
**Item Lost:** Unknown
**Notes:**//D-5566 was immediately killed by SCP-████ upon removing it from SCP-1162. No other fatalities were experienced; SCP-████ was returned to containment without incident. It appears that if used as a "disposal chute," the next item pulled out will be the last one deliberately put in. Due to the transitory nature of SCP-1162 if not used regularly, this poses an unacceptable risk of containment breach if used in this fashion. No further testing in this area will be allowed.//
