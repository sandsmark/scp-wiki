**Item Lost:** SCP-████

**Item Retrieved:** SCP-████, in active state
**Item Lost:** Unknown
**Notes:** //D-5566 was immediately killed by SCP-████ upon removing it from SCP-1162. No other fatalities were experienced; SCP-████ was returned to containment without incident. It appears that if used as a "disposal chute," the next item pulled out will be the last one deliberately put in. Due to the transitory nature of SCP-1162 if not used regularly, this poses an unacceptable risk of containment breach if used in this fashion. No further testing in this area will be allowed.//

//Note: Agent White did not technically lose her previous pay rate.  Human Resources agrees that Agent White voluntarily relinquished her previous pay rate through her documented sub-standard performance in the aforementioned reporting period.  As one cannot "find" what one does not "lose", her pay rate will remain at its current lesser rate.//

**Item Retrieved:** [REDACTED]
**Item Lost:** Undergarments
**Notes:** //"No way is this mine!  I'm married, what would I even need something like this for?  Okay, stick a fork in me, I'm done.  I mean... ahh, this is ridiculous."//
