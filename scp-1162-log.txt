**Subject:** D-5524
//Note: D-5524 was carrying Keter class object SCP-████, in a passive state, to see if SCP-1162 could be considered as a containment option for troublesome small SCP objects.//

**Item Lost:** SCP-████
**Notes:** //D-5524 was terminated immediately afterwards.//

**Item Retrieved:** SCP-████, in active state
**Item Lost:** Unknown
**Notes:** //D-5566 was immediately killed by SCP-████ upon removing it from SCP-1162. No other fatalities were experienced; SCP-████ was returned to containment without incident. It appears that if used as a "disposal chute," the next item pulled out will be the last one deliberately put in. Due to the transitory nature of SCP-1162 if not used regularly, this poses an unacceptable risk of containment breach if used in this fashion. No further testing in this area will be allowed.//

-------

//Note: Agent White did not technically lose her previous pay rate.  Human Resources agrees that Agent White voluntarily relinquished her previous pay rate through her documented sub-standard performance in the aforementioned reporting period.  As one cannot "find" what one does not "lose", her pay rate will remain at its current lesser rate.//

**Item Retrieved:** [REDACTED]
**Item Lost:** Undergarments
**Notes:** //"No way is this mine!  I'm married, what would I even need something like this for?  Okay, stick a fork in me, I'm done.  I mean... ahh, this is ridiculous."//

**Subject:** Researcher S█████

//Note: Researcher S█████ came in with a large number of spherical objects, varying in size from 1 mm in diameter to 20 cm in diameter, with the intention of determining how items that are lost are selected by SCP-1162.  Researcher S█████ wore a one-piece jumpsuit instead of the standard Foundation researcher uniform and carried nothing else on his person to minimize the chance of an unintended item being taken by SCP-1162.//

**Item Retrieved:** One (1) U.S. penny
**Item Lost:** One (1) sphere, 8 cm in diameter
**Notes:**

**Item Retrieved:** One (1) empty plastic water bottle

**Item Retrieved:** One (1) broken half of an unmarked compact disc

**Notes:**

**Item Retrieved:** One (1) sphere, 8 cm in diameter
**Item Lost:** One (1) sphere, 2.5 cm in diameter
**Notes:** //The number of items retrieved before previously taken items start to return is consistent with Sr. Researcher Grant's experiment.// -Researcher S█████

Using data from 75 repetitions of the experiment, Researcher S█████ determined that spheres selected were normally distributed with regard to size, with a mean diameter of approximately 7.25 cm and a standard deviation of approximately 2.5 cm.  Spheres above 15 cm in diameter were not selected during any of the trials, though it is unknown whether this was because SCP-1162 cannot take items that do not fit within it, or because the probability of an object of that size being selected based on the normal distribution is 0.1% or below.

//Note: These spheres had no personal significance, so we've yet to determine if the personal meaning attributed to an object influences the probability that the object is taken.  However, it seems clear that meaningless items are truly taken at random.// -Researcher S█████
-----

**Item Retrieved:** One (1) partially decayed //Rattus norvegicus domestica//
**Item Lost:** One (1) pocketbook
