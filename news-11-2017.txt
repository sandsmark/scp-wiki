Welcome to this installment of site news, where we give thanks for the wiki!

This is a series showing off news from the site, articles from the past month[[footnote]] with a rating above 0 [[/footnote]], and fan-content for you to check out and discover! Be sure to leave a comment with your thoughts!

++++ Featured Articles

* The featured articles for November were [[[SCP-2494]]] ("SOFT HANDS") by [[*user TL333s]], [[[Last Meetings]]] by [[*user Jacob Conwell]], and [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/hello-i-am-an-eldritch-horror |Hello, I Am an Eldritch Horror]]] by [[*user DreamwalkerFae]]. The first is about organically source hands (cream), the second is about a long-awaited retirement, and the third is about a particularly sinister toaster! Check them out!

++++ Editor's Choice Articles

* [[[SCP-3084]]] ("Seven Strangers at a Feast") - A film takes on a life of its own. Written by [[*user Kalinin]]. //Seven Strangers is a fantastically eerie piece, operating on a surreal internal logic and meshing together a collection of classic horror elements in a uniquely Foundation style. Seven Strangers gave me goosebumps and is not to be missed.//
* [[[SCP-049-J]]] ("The Plague Fellow") - Gotta get that sweet medieval bitcoin. Written by [[*user djkaktus]]. //This is the only good article about 049. It's a terrific riff on the (in)famous doctor and is wickedly funny in its own right. This author gives it two severed thumbs up!//
* [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/like-clockwork-hub |...Like Clockwork]]] - This is the end of all. Written by [[*user Decibelles]]. //If its progenitor 3999 was an SCP devoted to the author's psyche, Like Clockwork is a tale series devoted to its own author's psyche. It breaks the meta and mold of the wiki in fascinating ways and is a uniquely character-focused take on the end of the world.//
* [[[An Old Woman and her Garden]]] - A fairy tale about a sweet old lady and her garden of undead horrors. Written by [[*user fieldstone]]. //An Old Woman's unique protagonist and Tim Burton-esque gothic fantasy mesh together to form one of the best creepypastas I've read in recent memory.//

++++ Event Featured Articles

* In [[[SCP-2336]]] ("The Word"), by [[*user spikebrennan]], the Foundation industrialized hell...
* In [[[SCP-410]]] ("Editor Bettles"), by [[*user Woedenaz]], bugs had better spelling and grammar than you...

Thanks for tuning in again, folks! If you're unsatisfied with the blurb(s) provided for the article(s) you wrote, feel free to change it. Of course, you could just avoid that problem entirely by sending [[*user A Random Day]] a blurb for your article. We may or may not use it (if we can think of something more attention-getting, though we can try to stick with one you give us) but we'd really would just like them in order to make the process easier for making these. This is a community thing, and we want authors to give their blurbs to sell these articles much easier. It reduces the workload we have to do, and helps the news come out that much earlier!
