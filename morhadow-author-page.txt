Hello guys!! I guess that you want to see my works. There we go

[[[SCP-4620]]] - Bread for Today, Wage for Never

> This is my first skip //**here**//. I planned to write this for ClicheCon as an object that does a thing extremely well but I was busy[[footnote]] For busy, I meant lazy. [[/footnote]]. So I left the idea in the dust until jamcon 2019 and trying how fast could I write. I'm not satisfied much with this, but due to the theme I can't do much.

> Thanks [[*user Agente marw]]. Good kitten!
> 
> Surprisingly, it has a Japanese translation...

[[[SCP-4791]]] - The Lady's Matchmaker

> My favourite skip written //**here**//. I love the End of Death canon, one of the best in the wiki. But there are aspects still unexplored[[footnote]] Not anyone fault. Just that EoD encompass a lot.[[/footnote]] like fiction made in the period. And the theme was pulp fiction. And this is how this abstract piece was born. I'm fine with this and how did it make and bla bla.

>  Thanks for [[*user Jakuwoski]] for translating. You are the best!

[[[SCP-4927]]] - Have a Nice Flight
> Last skip //**here**// at the moment! I was inspired. I wanted to write it. I changed my idea halfway thanks to an interpretation of a [[[http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dc-yerko|good planet]]]. I searched feedback. I published it. It will do good.

> Thanks for [[*user Alkenoc]] for translating it fast! Spanish Branch, best Branch!!
