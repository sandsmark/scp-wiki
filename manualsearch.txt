**Personnel Number: IS601** - //Systems Analyst Patrick Gephart//

**Biography**
My name is Patrick Gephart, and I am a Class 1 Systems Analyst with a major in Information Systems, a minor in Computer Science, and a certificate in Networking. I was recruited by the SCP Foundation after discovering the Biological Networking Device, a wireless router with a connection to living beings.

I have worked in the field as an agent and I have worked in the laboratories as a doctor, but I am not considered either of these professions. However, when it comes to mechanical or electrical systems, I am to be consulted before any major changes are to be made. I am slowly taking on more jobs but I am hurrying as fast as I can. You can reach me at any time with a page to my Personnel Number or contact via phone at (███)-███-████.
