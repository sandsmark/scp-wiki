+ HIYA!
++ I'm Fingo7! :D

>++ INTRODUCTION:
> I'm Fingo! Some people say that I'm a ladybug, but I don't really know. They may be right. When you are writing on your computer you don't tend to notice these things. Aside from my possible lack of humanity, I am your typical finds-loads-of-things-cute-and-loves-green-drinks kind of coccinellid. I find almost anything pretty much adorable, and I have a soft spot for round, happy-looking, small things. If you could just shitpost a ton of cute pictures of millipedes or something in the discussions that'd be great, because I'm going through a fad of loving many-legged friendly creatures. 
> /(-w-)/
> Actually, if you send your cute millipictures in the discussions, I'll give you a long range Fingo-hug, because I once had occultism as an interest of mine and we practiced long range hugs. (just don't spam 3:<) I drink at least a litre of extra strong matcha a day, which I'm pretty sure isn't good for your kidneys but it helps me write so I don't really care.

I'll start off the millipictures with a picture of a T. Niger I found in my garden. Shame we don't get any big millipedes where I live, in Ireland. I might buy a pet Florida Ivory millipede one day. ;3
