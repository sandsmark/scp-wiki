+ HIYA!
++ I'm Fingo7! :D

>++ INTRODUCTION:
> I'm Fingo! Some people say that I'm a ladybug, but I don't really know. They may be right. When you are writing on your computer you don't tend to notice these things. Aside from my possible lack of humanity, I am your typical finds-loads-of-things-cute-and-loves-green-drinks kind of coccinellid. I find almost anything pretty much adorable, and I have a soft spot for round, happy-looking, small things. If you could just shitpost a ton of cute pictures of millipedes or something in the discussions that'd be great, because I'm going through a fad of loving many-legged friendly creatures. 
> /(-w-)/
> Actually, if you send your cute millipictures in the discussions, I'll give you a long range Fingo-hug, because I once had occultism as an interest of mine and we practiced long range hugs. (just don't spam 3:<) I drink at least a litre of extra strong matcha a day, which I'm pretty sure isn't good for your kidneys but it helps me write so I don't really care.

+++ MY CAMEROON FAT BLACK MILLIPEDE IS JUST PRECIOUS <3 <3 <3

"Dr. Gears, we've had a problem with the mainframe for the database, and well-"

"Yes, Lament?"

"Well, I was trying to get into the system to try and check up on the containment reports for a couple of the anomalies, and… this happened."

"…Curious."

"Sir, what the hell are we gonna do about this?"

"I would advise you consult a member of the computing anomalies if necessary and the Informational Security-"

But even as Gears reached for the intercom button, the catface loomed large over him.
And that was how they found him: a neat little hole in his head, and his lips stretched into an abhorrent expression.

Big hugs go to [[*user Absentmindednihilist]] for telling this spooky tale at  //[http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-1933640 Trick or Treat! Part Duex]//. :3

[[collapsible show="+ The legend of Fingo, the adorable finger-severer!" hide="- It was a dark and stormy night."]]
Well. Stormy in attitude, anyway.

The Joneses had run out of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. All they had been left with was Whoppers. Ah yes, that bane of Halloween mirth. The detestable malted candies that led only to misery and schoolyard conversations trying to figure out exactly what malt was, exactly.

But Mr. Jones was a frugal man, and despite his wife's protests, he had bought several large bags of the reviled confection when they were on sale at the local Wal-Mart. His wife had managed to obtain some contraband goodies, but they had quickly run out as the children had selected anything but the beige-wrapped monstrosities.

Mr Jones's financial prudence would turn out to be his doom.

The doorbell sounded, and Mr. Jones opened it to find a tiny, adorable child in a positively squeal-worthy handmade ladybug costume.

"Twick oh tweat," the kiddo called, still mangling his rhotics.
Mr. Jones began to offer the kid candy, but stopped when he realized that there were no adults in sight. The kid couldn't have been more than five - who let a preschooler wander around unsupervised at night?

"Do you have a name, kiddo?"

"Fingo. Do you have candy?"

"Sure do, kiddo. Sure do. Where's your mommy and daddy, Fingo?"

Fingo shoved his lip out in an impressive pout as tears began to gather in the corners of his eyes.

"I don't know. They told me to go out and get candy and leave them alone. And then they drove away and left me all alone."

Mr. Jones beckoned Mrs. Jones over and explained the story. After a brief strategy meeting, it was agreed that Mrs. Jones would call the authorities while Mr. Jones kept Fingo occupied.

Mr. Jones led Fingo over to the couch and scrolled through TV channels until he found the Peanuts Halloween special. He came back with a bowl of candy, piled high with Whoppers.

"All yours, kiddo!" Mr. Jones announced proudly.

Fingo gleefully grabbed the bowl and gazed inside.

After the incident, Mr. Jones would swear the kid's eyes turned red.

An ear-shattering scream came from the den, causing Mrs. Jones to drop the phone and hurry in. 

She found her husband on the floor, trying to stem the tide of blood pouring from his hands.

"Thank you foh the tweat!" Fingo said, munching on Mr. Jones's left pinky finger and holding up a blood soaked pillowcase in gratitude, before running away altogether.
