+ Paranormal Object
A Saharan weapon from the age of barbirism and paganism, resembling a curved axe decorated with jewels of the desert.

+ Threat Posed
Benign

+ Origins
Believed to have been created by North-Saharan witchcraft before the modern age. The object was seized from the Order of Solomon's Temple[[footnote]] [RAISA NOTICE] An organization dedicated to the containment of the abnormalities. Defunct c.1720 [[/footnote]] following the Illuminatus Schism[[footnote]] [RAISA NOTICE] This is believed to be in reference to the Fifth Occult War. [[/footnote]].
-----
+ Alchemist Asserstion
The object is made of gold but radiates with the same energy of lead. Grandmaster Alchemists are to handle the object exclusively.
-----
+ Abnormality
Records of the Order of Solomon's Temple utilizing the object to wage war during The Crusades is referenced in The Library. Though the object lacks the sharp edge of a blade or the deadliness of a bullet, it conjured warriors from the sands of the desert.

In order to summon warriors, the blade must be satisfied with a witchcraft ritual, the likes of which are described henceforth.
# Slit the throat of an adult male oxen and collect its spilled blood.
# Collect the manure of a riverbeast[[footnote]] [RAISA NOTICE] Colloquial term for 'hippopotamus'. [[/footnote]].
# Finely grind lavender blossom into oil.
# Gather fresh honey.
# Mix into a concoction using a wooden ladle and roasting over a cast iron pot.
# Bathe the object in the concoction, storing the rest.
# Present the blade to the sands.

The summoned do not understand the King's English, but obey the language of Kemet. Commands may be issued exclusively in the language. One must not be fluent, but understandable enough for the summoned to obey.

{{Most esteemed gentlemen of the Operations Council,}}

{{Intelligence operatives have revealed the Kingdom of Italy and the Deutsches Reich intend on allying sometime in early September.}}

{{With most of our weapons and manpower being reallocated, our African protectorates are soon to be under immediate Italian threat. Moving the requisite amount of troops to defend our interests will consume far too many resources which would be better spent elsewhere, as well as time we cannot afford to lose.}} 

{{It is for the above reasons I would propose the use of AO-023 on a mass scale to create an army which may fulfill our needs. The materials required to satisfy the object's ritualistic cost are affordable when compared to steel, iron, and other items which will surely only become more expensive as the war continues.}}

{{Though the limitations of these soldiers are very rudimentary, they will require our enemy to expend bullets, manpower, and other resources of their own to combat them. As these conjured soldiers are golems, they require no sustenance and will blindly obey our commands as issued to them. We may not be able to overpower our opponents, but we can easily succeed in a war of attrition by using this object. The possibility of the Ahnenerbe Obskuracorps possessing knowledge of AO-023 is minimal, as most documentation regarding the object was burned or acquired by His Majesty's Foundation following the Fifth Occult War.}}

{{I thank you for overseeing this proposal.}}
