**Item #:** SCP-2534

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-2534-1 instances that have not passed their two year mark are to be kept in Containment Wing 14 of Site-32.  They are to be individually wrapped in plastic, and organized by their original recovery date (or a rough estimate, see retrieval procedures).  SCP-2534-1E is also to be contained in this manner.
Only D-Class personnel are to handle, sort, and arrange these instances, to ensure no personnel accidentally receive its effect should a dating error arise.

A week prior to an SCP-2534-1 instance's two year mark (or estimated two year mark), it is to be held by a D-Class personnel (to ensure ownership is transferred), then placed in a smaller temporary containment locker until its two year mark passes.

When the D-Class (now an instance of SCP-2534-2B) has been subjected to SCP-2534-1's effect, SCP-2534-1 will be removed and transferred to inert SCP-2534-1 containment.  SCP-2534-1's effect is to be noted on the D-Class SCP-2534-2B's record, to prevent testing them with any currency related or currency based SCPs.

SCP-2534-1 instances that have passed their two year mark are to be kept in a standard containment crate in Containment Wing 15 of Site-32.  To date, no further anomalous activities have manifested with these pennies, and they are considered inert.  Inert instances may be used for testing at the consent of one Level 3 or higher researcher.  Future uses of inert SCP-2534-1 instances have been proposed and are pending approval.

Due to unpredictability of SCP-2534 occurrence, retrieval of SCP-2534-1 directly from manifestation is not feasible with current resources.

An advertising campaign under the guise of a US mint recall of SCP-2534-1's characteristic "printing error" is ongoing.  Social media websites and applications are to also be tracked to identify SCP-2534-1 and SCP-2534-2A or -2B instances.

Upon confirming location of an SCP-2534-2A instance, Mobile Task Force Rho-7 ("Ford's Theatre") will be dispatched to retrieve SCP-2534-1 from them.  The date of original SCP-2534-1 retrieval is to be acquired from SCP-2534-2A as well, as it is important for further containment (see containment procedures).  If SCP-2534-2A is unable to recall the date of retrieval, they are to provide a rough estimate.  After location and retrieval of SCP-2534-1, Class C amnestics are to be administered to SCP-2534-2A.

Bank owners, government officials, US mint employees, and other individuals legally involved in handling large amounts of currency are to be closely monitored for possibility of SCP-2534-1 acquisition.  If any of these individuals are confirmed to own an instance of SCP-2534-1, MTF Rho-7 are to initiate the same retrieval procedures as above.

Retrieval procedures are being prepared to expand to the eurozone if any more instances of SCP-2534-1E are discovered.

Instances of SCP-2534-2B are to be administered Class B amnestics and detained in Site-32-B.  They are not to come into contact with any currency.  
Current global surveillance systems are to include identification of possible SCP-2534-2B instances through identification of unusual circumstances such as cash disappearing, strange or unusual robberies, etc.  If any instances are found, MTF Rho-7 are to be dispatched to detain them.


**Description:** SCP-2534 is a phenomenon which results in the manifestation of SCP-2534-1.

SCP-2534 occurs --only-- almost always (see Addendum 2) in the United States[[footnote]]SCP-2534 has occurred in all 50 states.[[/footnote]], and only on flat areas composed of concrete, asphalt, wood, metal, or carpet that are commonly traversed on foot.  Due to this, SCP-2534 usually occurs on public sidewalks, in parking lots, or inside buildings.  SCP-2534 occurrences have never been directly witnessed or recorded.

Instances of SCP-2534-1 are United States pennies.  SCP-2534-1 are, on most occasions[[footnote]]Changes in SCP-2534-1 composition and design have been noted.  For example, SCP-2534-1 instances discovered in 1980 contained mostly zinc, and instances discovered in 2008 displayed the Lincoln Union Shield on their backside.[[/footnote]], almost visually identical to current United States pennies.  However, the printed year of SCP-2534-1 instances is always two (2) years ahead of the year of original retrieval of the instance, along with limited destructibility[[footnote]]SCP-2534-1 instances can be melted, bent, etc, but cannot be cut or separated into more than one piece (in either solid or liquid state).  Any manipulated SCP-2534-1 instance holds the same eventual anomalous effect as a normal instance.  SCP-2534-1 instances that have passed their two year mark do not have this effect.[[/footnote]].  Instances of SCP-2534-1 have been printed with both mint marks from the Denver mint and without mint marks[[footnote]]Pennies printed without mint marks originate from the Philadelphia mint.[[/footnote]].

The earliest discovered instance of SCP-2534-1 was in 1965.  

When SCP-2534-1 has been retrieved[[footnote]]Defined as being picked up by retriever.  This is not exclusively contact with skin, as those wearing gloves or using other methods to retrieve SCP-2534-1 is still considered retrieval.  Tests are currently underway to determine the exact parameters of retrieval.[[/footnote]] after manifestation, the retriever (or current owner) will receive its primary anomalous effect exactly 2 years after the date of original retrieval.  Owners of SCP-2534-1 are hereby referred to as SCP-2534-2 (-2A being a current owner of SCP-2534-1 before its two year mark passes, and -2B being those who have received its primary effect).

SCP-2534-1 ownership (and SCP-2534-2A status) can be transferred among persons.  SCP-2534-1 being given, stolen, handled by another individual, or used as legal tender are all grounds for transfer of its eventual anomalous effect.  If SCP-2534-1 is not left on SCP-2534-2A's person (such as being left in property owned by SCP-2534-2A, hidden, or lost) but not retrieved, stolen, or otherwise handled by another individual, no ownership or status is transferred.

Exactly two years after the original retrieval date of SCP-2534-1, the current owner (now SCP-2534-2B) will lose all United States currency on their person, property[[footnote]]Regardless of whether or not SCP-2534-2B owns the cash in their property, see Incident 2534-S for more details.[[/footnote]], or ownership, with the exception of instances of SCP-2534-1 (inert or otherwise) and non-physical currency (bank balances, credit cards, etc). Property loss usually occurs via theft, loss, or sudden expenses, each of which appear non-anomalous in nature.  Any new US currency acquired by SCP-2534-2B is lost in a similar manner shortly after acquisition.

This effect makes it impossible for SCP-2534-2B to handle or use any United States legal tender, and --does not cease until the death of SCP-2534-2B-- persists even after the death of SCP-2534-2B, regardless of whether or not SCP-2534-2B dies before their SCP-2534-1's two year mark passes.

After the 2 year mark has passed and SCP-2534-2B has received SCP-2534-1's anomalous effect, the SCP-2534-1 instance will become inert and cease any anomalous activity.

__**Test 1**__
> **Subject:**  D-103122 (SCP-2534-2BD) 
> **Note:**  D-103122 has received SCP-2534-1's effect, and will be used to test the effect's parameters.  From now on, D-103122 will be referred to as SCP-2534-2BD.
> **Procedure:**  SCP-2534-2BD is given a dollar ($1.00 USD) and is instructed to hold on to it for as long as possible.
> **Results:**   SCP-2534-2BD placed the dollar in her pocket.  When the pocket was checked again, the dollar was no longer there.

__**Test 2**__
> **Subject:**  SCP-2534-2BD
> **Procedure:**  A nickel ($0.05 USD) is taped to SCP-2534-2BD's arm using transparent tape.
> **Results:**  SCP-2534-2BD complained that the tape was too tight.  When attempting to loosen it, the nickel fell out and rolled into a nearby grate.  SCP-2534-2BD was unable to retrieve the nickel.  Repeated tests eventually resulted in SCP-2534-2BD losing the nickel, despite any changed variables.

__**Test 3**__
> **Subject:** SCP-2534-2BD
> **Procedure:**  SCP-2534-2BD is given $1.00 USD, $1.00 CAD, ¥100 JPY, £1.00 GBP, €1.00 EUR, and 元5.00 CNY.  SCP-2534-2BD was then instructed to hold onto all the currency.
> **Results:**  SCP-2534-2BD placed all currency in her pocket.  When the pocket was checked again, all currency remained except for the $1.00 USD.

__**Test 4**__
>**Subject:** SCP-2534-2BD
> **Procedure:** A quarter ($0.25 USD) is surgically inserted underneath the skin in SCP-2534-2BD's leg.
> **Results** --The quarter remained in SCP-2534-2BD's leg.  At the time of writing, it has not been lost.
> "It seems that the effect will not persist if the money in question is not readily available to SCP-2534-2B.  More tests to determine the limits of this effect have been approved."  //Dr. █████//-- Two weeks later, SCP-2534-2BD underwent testing with SCP-███.  During the testing, SCP-████ wounded SCP-2534-2BD's leg, breaking the skin and releasing the quarter.  SCP-2534-2BD was then quickly evacuated from the testing chamber.

**Addendum, Incident 2534-S:** On █/██/████, the ███ █████ Bank of ██████████ was robbed by 4 unidentified individuals.  The entirety of the approximate $██.█ million dollars the bank had in storage was stolen. When checked, J███ S████, the owner of the bank, was confirmed to own an instance of SCP-2534-1. The instance was retrieved, and Mr. S████ was administered amnestics and relocated to Site 32-B.

> Folks, look at this as a wake up call.  Though this event was nothing to sneeze at, this proves that SCP-2534-1 could have some massive consequences if it were to fall into the wrong hands.  Imagine if this happened at a federal reserve.  If that were to happen, SCP-2534-1 could cause a serious dent in the US economy.  I'm requesting a revision to the containment procedures. //-Captain A███, head of MTF-Rho-7//

**Addendum 2:**  A thread was made on ██████ (a popular image sharing website) on ██/█/2015, on the topic of a "misprinted Euro" the poster had discovered.  In the thread, an image was included of a 1 Euro cent coin printed with the year 2017.  The IP was traced to ███████, France, and MTF-Rho-7 was dispatched to retrieve the instance, now designated SCP-2534-1E. 

SCP-2534-1E was retrieved without error, date of retrieval was confirmed, and Class-C amnestics were administered to SCP-2534-2A instance.  SCP-2534-1E has retained the same physical properties as a normal SCP-2534-1 instance (see Footnote 3), and it is assumed that it will have the same eventual effect as well.

No other instances of SCP-2534-1E have since been reported or discovered.
