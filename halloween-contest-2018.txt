title:Halloween Contest 2018
++ TIME TO GET SPOOKY

Halloween Contest 2018 is upon us. What does that mean?

> * **Write a tale dealing with the SCP Foundation and Halloween.**

We’re going to have a bit of a challenge this time around, though. This year, we want the community to help us out with the contest.

From the moment this post is up, to midnight on October 4th 2018 (##orange|Eastern Standard Time##), we will have a thread open for the community to suggest stipulations that everyone must follow during this contest - tricks and treats, if you will. [[[SCP-330 | Two]]] will be chosen by Dexanote and Sly from community suggestions, plus two more created by staff. Each contestant may then choose TWO of the four tricks and treats to use in their entry!

[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-7733625/tricks-and-treats-halloween-contest-2018 | Take a look here for the Tricks and Treats thread! It will be closed on October 4 2018 at Midnight.]]]
 

On October 5th, 2018, **this post will be edited**, and the four Tricks, Treats, and Stipulations will be added to the Rules below. Each entry will include, reference, or follow these tricks, treats, and stipulations, depending on what they end up being. Be creative! And get spooky!


> **__The Rules__**:
> 
> 
> # This is a solo contest. //No exceptions.//
> # Entries will be subject to the usual deletion process.
> # Minor edits are permitted - grammar edits, formatting, etc. Try not to change the tale fundamentally.
> # Your tale //must// include Halloween with an SCP Backdrop or The SCP Foundation with a Halloween backdrop. No tales about how 682 was really discovered on Halloween or something like that.
> # Your tale needs to be a tale. No "SCP Format, Tagged Tale, Lookit Me!" stuff. We would prefer this to be a story.
> # Your tale must have a rating of at least +20 to qualify for the winning prize. If everyone writes crap, no one wins. Put effort in! The season deserves it.
> # You must write something //new//. If you've got something close already on the site, you don't get to enter it just because the contest came along.
> # No entries will be accepted after October 29, 2018 at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, because Dex and Sly are the ones running this contest and they’re in EST.
> # The winner will be determined on October 30, 2018 at whatever time of the day we get around to it. No whining. Probably gonna be before 9pm EST though. We’ll try our best.

After writing your tale, tag it "halloween2018" and link it to the bottom of this page! The winner’s piece will be featured on October 31 on the front page, with other prizes will be announced in the near future.


__**Current Entries**__:

* There are no current entries.




Looking forward to this.
