**Item #:** SCP-982

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-982 is to be kept in a climate-controlled facility, and must remain closed and bolted except during approved exploration. All exploration team members must receive dialect coaching and full-spectrum vaccinations before entering SCP-982, and undergo decontamination and a 96-hour quarantine upon emerging. Nonwhite personnel participating in exploration teams must undergo mandatory psychological counseling.

**Description:** SCP-982 is an antique casement window, originally taken from the abandoned business offices of███ ██████, a 19th-century patent attorney in Chicago, IL. No matter where it is mounted, SCP-982 opens onto the street outside███ ██████'s third-story office, as it was between 8:30 AM on Friday, March 26, 1875 and 10:45 AM on Saturday, March 27, 1875. Personnel exiting this window find themselves in what is apparently 1875 Chicago; however, at the end of the 26-hour interval, the city 'resets'. Any external objects or personnel within the city at that time are lost.

The size of the area accessible via SCP-982 is not known; exploration teams have been able to send telegrams to ████████ in England, and receive responses.

Exiting 1875 must be done by climbing back through SCP-982 from the outside; attempts to access SCP-982 from within the offices of ███ ██████ reveal only an ordinary window. Exploration teams are advised that the Chicago Police in 1875 react with hostility towards the use of grappling guns and rope ladders to re-enter SCP-982; since all changes are eliminated at the reset, the use of lethal force is fully sanctioned with no risk to the timeline.

Items extracted from SCP-982 are to be considered potential biohazards and contained as such.
