**Item #:** SCP-966

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation MTF ██ (Dream Hunters) are to regularly be on the lookout for news about violent human deaths related to sleep deprivation on [REDACTED], in order to find and neutralize remaining wild instances of SCP-966.

The four specimens of SCP-966 (designated SCP-966-1 through SCP-966-4) acquired by the Foundation must be contained in a 10 x 10 m room made of steel, with no windows, located on Site-██. Two security cameras with infrared filters and infrared-sensitive film are to be installed inside the room. Each SCP-966 are to be fed with 20 kg of meat every month.

In the event of the SCP-966-2 giving birth, the newborn specimen is to be studied and disposed of before it reaches maturity.

**Description:** SCP-966 are predatory creatures that resemble hairless, digitigrade humans, possessing an elongated face with a mouth lined with needle-like teeth. The claws on their hands are 20 cm long. Although sharp, these are easily broken, making them unfit for active combat. SCP-966 height ranges from 1,40 to 1,60 meters, and they can reach up to 30 kg in weight. Physically, SCP-966 are weak, possessing hollow bones and low muscular density. They do not seem to rest through sleep; instead, they will suddenly cease all movements at seemingly random intervals of time, resuming normal activity three to five minutes later.

SCP-966 is visible only at wavelengths ranging from 700 nm to about 900 nm. This applies to all of SCP-966 tissues, including blood, saliva and [DATA EXPUNGED].

SCP-966 feeds on medium-to-large sized animals, including humans. They hunt either alone or in pairs. Their hunting methods consist on emitting a previously unknown type of wave (dubbed as ██████ waves, in honor of the late Doctor ██████) which permanently inhibits the ability of the affected creature to enter in any of the NREM and REM sleep stages. The ability to micro sleep is also lost. All attempts to make victims of SCP-966 sleep have failed; however, it is still possible to induce other forms of unconsciousness.

After depriving its victim from sleep, SCP-966 will stalk its prey until the lack of rest makes it collapse. At this point, SCP-966 will proceed consume it. SCP-966 has proved to be very agile and silent while stalking their victims. On occasion, they will deliberately make threatening noises around the prey to further stress it, and may even physically assault it if the victim proves to be particularly durable.

Other than the common symptoms caused by sleep deprivation, victims of SCP-966 have also showed signs of suffering from extremely vivid hallucinations, as well as sudden bouts of rage with no apparent external stimuli. It is currently thought that, besides being able to emit ██████ waves, SCP-966 are also able to [DATA EXPUNGED] in order to further degenerate the physical and mental state of their prey.

Wild instances of SCP-966 were previously found all over the world; however, since their discovery in 19██, the Foundation has succeeded in greatly thinning their numbers. They are now exclusively found in [REDACTED].
