**Item #:** SCP-2971 

**Object Class:** Euclid

[[span style="color:red"]]**In accordance with Protocol Myra, there will be messages throughout this article to dispute the existence of SCP-2971-A. Read these messages in their entirety, and consider their points until you believe them to be the truth.**[[/span]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** Persons suspected to be carriers of SCP-2971 are to be monitored through their social media accounts, bank account statements, and whereabouts. information spread by these persons regarding SCP-2971-A is to be censored, and the subject in question detained.

Internet search engines are to be monitored for search levels of the phrases (or variations of these phrases) 'Think about it', 'Rock and Roll Sacrificial', 'Vic Stanley Country Club', and 'December 28th, 2012'. If SCP-2971-related keywords are repeatedly searched from a single I.P. address, the location of the I.P. is to be tracked and agents are to take all persons at the location into custody for questioning and administration of Protocol Myra.

Protocol Myra is to be enacted on subjects confirmed to be under the influence of SCP-2971. Protocol Myra consists of firm refutal that SCP-2971-A existed, followed by rationalizating to the subject why it didn't exist. This has proven to be enough to cure SCP-2971 in 100% of cases. 
 
Jerry Lee Lewis' home address and all properties owned by him are to be wire-tapped, and Lewis himself is to be monitored for any SCP-2971 related phenomena. Personnel assigned to monitoring Lewis are to log any notable findings and notify their immediate superiors of them should they occur. 

**Description:** SCP-2971 is a memetic localized reality-restructuring event that causes the subject to believe they attended a live Jerry Lee Lewis concert held at the Vic Stanley Country Club in Ferriday, Louisiana on December 28th, 2012 (Dubbed SCP-2971-A). SCP-2971-A never actually occured, and no business named 'Vic Stanley Country Club' exists. SCP-2971 is passed to an uninfected subject through reading or discussing the topic of SCP-2971-A or its contents with an infected person. The topic of SCP-2971 without mention of SCP-2971-A as an event is not sufficient to spread the meme. 

[[span style="color:red"]]**SCP-2971-A never occured. Jerry Lee Lewis was at home resting on December 28th, 2012. He did not perform that day.**[[/span]] 

Infection of a subject by SCP-2971 has two primary effects: 

**Effect A:** The subject will suddenly gain a thorough recollection of SCP-2971-A's setlist, comments made by Jerry Lee Lewis during SCP-2971-A, and other details such as their journey to Vic Stanley Country Club. Subjects affected by SCP-2971 will excitedly attempt to tell others about the event (thereby spreading the meme), and show an abnormally increased interest in Lewis' songs and history, bordering on obsession. Upon curing a subject of SCP-2971, all of these memories will disappear, and any anomalous interest in Lewis will cease. 

**Effect B:** SCP-2971 implements a localized reality-restructuring effect. Persons afflicted by it will have historically attended SCP-2971-A, despite the event having not occured at all for non-infected persons. In their possession are often memorabillia from SCP-2971-A. Some examples include autographs, non-anomalous CD-ROMs[[footnote]]Some instances of these CDs have had a receipt in the case with the vendor printed as VIC.STAN.CTRY.CLB.[[/footnote]], T-shirts and amateur recordings of the event. Upon curing a subject of SCP-2971, all of the subject's items acquired this way will disappear. 

One notable symptom of SCP-2971 infection is an abnormally frequent use of the phrase 'Think about it'[[footnote]]Lewis has been known to utter this phrase offhandedly from time to time. It may refer to a song he recorded called 'Think About It, Darlin'[[/footnote]]. The phrase itself is not memetic, and contributes to the spread of SCP-2971 no more than conversation about SCP-2971-A with an infected subject usually does. In 100% of cases to date, however, frequent use of the phrase has accompanied SCP-2971 infection. 

SCP-2971 has no known source; on December 29th, 2012, it is believed to have spontaneously spread to an apparently random selection of 2,446 citizens in the state of Louisiana, with the exception of the largest cluster of subjects within the Ferriday city limits. 

[[span style="color:red"]]**SCP-2971-A did not happen. You were at work on December 28th, 2012, so you would not have had the time to attend a concert.**[[/span]] 

When Foundation agents had discovered SCP-2971, a telephone call to the Lewis household was made in order to ascertain his status. The Foundation was unable to talk to Lewis himself, but spoke to an assistant who said Lewis was fine except for 'a bout of headaches' in the days following December 28th, 2012.

> **Interviewed:** ████ ███████████, one of the first discovered subjects affected by SCP-2971.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. █████.
> 
> **Foreword:** ████ ███████████ has shown an abnormal interest in this concert she says she attended (as the initial reports suggested she might), and claims to remember it in great detail. She has proven willing to co-operate, however she has been difficult to talk to due to her continually steering the converstation towards something related to Jerry Lee Lewis.
> 
> **<Begin Log.>**
> 
> **Dr. █████:** Good evening, Ms. ███████████.
> 
> **████ ███████████:** Hello.
> 
> **Dr. █████:** What can you tell me about December 28th, 2012?
> 
> **████ ███████████:** Oh boy, what can't I tell you? It was great. I took my kids to see Jerry Lee Lewis live that day! We stayed there for hours... after the show we got autographs and bought a few CDs... they loved it! In fact, we...
> 
> **Dr. █████:** [//Interrupting//] Uh, Ms. ███████████, do you recall anything out of place about the event? Anything at all?
> 
> **████ ███████████:** Well now that you mention it, there was a man in a fancy suit who sat near us, but never seemed to focus on the concert. He was always looking at the crowd, scanning their faces. Think about it, he was probably just nervous, I mean he was in the presence of a real rock star! I was nervous too.
> 
> **Dr. █████:** Did the man say anything to you?
> 
> **████ ███████████:** No sir, he just kept to himself. Think about it, we wouldn't have been able to hear him anyhow, what with the loud music and all. Jerry did a song called 'Rock and Roll Sacrificial' that really got the crowd roaring! It was the only thing that got the man in the suit to pay attention to the stage. He must have really liked it!
> 
> [[span style="color:red"]]**No song called 'Rock and Roll Sacrificial' is known to have been recorded by Jerry Lee Lewis. We have searched his entire discography, it does not exist.**[[/span]]
> 
> **Dr. █████:** So why did the man in the suit stand out? There were thousands of audience members, what made him catch your eye?
> 
> **████ ███████████:** Well, he was sitting one row in front of us, for one. He also had this really distinct sort of glow about him, like he had a mission. I dunno, he just seemed important. Anyway, did I tell you what Jerry Lee did on 'Great Balls of Fire'? I have to tell you!
> 
> **Dr. █████:** What did he do?
> 
> **████ ███████████:** He lit his piano on fire in the middle of the song!
> 
> **Dr. █████:** No way! That's crazy!
> 
> **████ ███████████:** He actually did! It was quite amazing to see. My kids just lost it when they saw that! Think about it.
> 
> **Dr. █████:** Come to think of it, I think I might've actually been to that show. That was at the old Vic Stanley Country Club, right?
>  
> **<Dr. █████ contracted SCP-2971 and was administered Protocol Myra, along with Ms. ███████████. Extraneous data removed. End Log.>**
>  
> **Closing Statement:** It was determined soon after that interviews with infected subjects should be kept to a hard limit of one minute followed by administration of Protocol Myra to the interviewer, to avoid any further incidents. Both Dr. █████ and Ms. ███████████ have since been cured.

> To whom it may concern at the Foundation,
> 
> We have a mutual problem. I represent a group interested in containing this little 'outbreak' of sorts that you've had. My organization has been, for some time, in possession of a small bubble of alternate timelimes. These timelines were gifted to us by an investor who counted greatly on the stability of your realm. He has put a great deal on the line to ensure that your realm does not see a collapse of its timethreads in the next decade.
> 
> With that in mind, obviously this new development is concerning. I have assured my superiors that we will gain your co-operation in rectifying this little problem. During my journey to your realm, I discovered that it was a fault of an entity(s) in your realm that caused one of these timelines to fall up between the cracks. As per inter-realm etiquette, the responsibility lies with that entity(s) to fix its mistake (as I'm sure a gentlebeing such as yourself is well aware). I do not currently believe the entity(s) is currently aware of its crime, however it will soon depart your realm and rescind. The courts will examine its case soon thereafter. 
> 
> Until such a time that the entity(s) responsible can be brought to the justice of the althing courts for this timeline error, my organization has determined that we will enact a Dimensional Property Claim (D.P.C.) on our I.P. currently residing in your realm, and any and all physical and metaphysical material spawned from it. We are disappointed that this mess had to happen. It is our sincere wish that this matter can be resolved peacefully (as many of our realm's interactions are), and we can continue business unabated in the future.
