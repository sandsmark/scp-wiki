**Item #:** SCP-804

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Until such time as SCP-804 is found to be without any memetic effect it is to remain in its original location at the former site of █████ █████, Alaska, where exposure to the elements prevents its reactivation.  A 30m x 30m camouflage tarp is to be maintained over SCP-804 and facilities for armed guards and testing are to be maintained 130 meters from its location.  Trespassers are to be treated with a Class-A Amensiac and returned to the nearest town of [DATA EXPUNGED] or terminated at the discretion of on-site security.  In the event of SCP-804 being approached or seized by a hostile armed force, Contingency 804-X is to be executed.

**Description:** SCP-804 is the remains of an art installation titled "World Without Man," revealed on ██ / ██ / 20██, by the defunct artists' group ██████ ███████.  According to documentation retrieved and deleted from the artists' website during clean-up procedure, SCP-804 was originally a large, clear globe of the Earth, with several smaller globes and video equipment within.  Promotional material on the website implied that the globe was to display images of pastoral wilderness untouched by mankind contrasted with visuals of abandoned human industry and decaying landmarks.

Upon activation before a small audience of prominent environmental activists and artists from the nearby community of █████ █████, SCP-804 began to display its destructive properties.  We can only speculate if the device's output was intentional or not as those involved in its construction perished during the incident or have gone into hiding.

While the globes within SCP-804 rotate, all man-made artifacts within approximately 100 meters begin to rapidly deteriorate until completely disintegrated.  The effect applies to anything ranging from machinery to buildings, clothing, plastics, synthetic chemical compounds and any tool more complex than a sharpened stick of wood.  The area of effect grows the longer the device is active, with the effect growing ever stronger at its source.  Human tissue is also affected at a slower rate of decay, causing victims to become emaciated as they lose body mass--leading up to collapse of the skeleton and death, with the body swiftly breaking down into component matter shortly thereafter.  Non-human life is completely unaffected.  Persons who escape the area of effect experience symptoms similar to prolonged starvation but can return to full health with proper care.

If not for the fact the SCP-804 is not entirely immune to its own effect it had the potential to remove all trace of humanity from the globe in a matter of weeks.  Judging from the observed rate of destruction upon original activation versus its current capabilities under testing, SCP-804's capabilities have been impaired by the damage it caused to itself.  However, sustained use still presents an extreme threat especially if the device is somehow refined or repaired.  

Due to the circumstances in which SCP-804 was secured it is strongly believed that the device also possesses some form of mental compulsion on those who view it, but testing is still on-going to determine if that property has also been compromised by the decay of SCP-804 and how it might be contained.  See Recovery Log for further information. 

**Recovery Log SCP-804**

Approximately 5 minutes after activation, the effect of SCP-804 reached the nearby community of █████ █████.   Citizens who were not at the art show initially responded with panic and made several emergency calls.  Due to the extreme remote location of the town, the first response was made by a small single-prop aircraft which arrived about thirty minutes later.  Although the plane entered the area of effect and was quickly lost, the pilot did relay a radio message describing the swift and complete destruction of the town's buildings.  At this point, the Foundation became aware of the situation and teams of agents were sent to investigate.

By the time agents were able to arrive on scene, SCP-804 had been intermittently active for nearly eight hours and as a result the town and everything in a radius of [DATA EXPUNGED] was wiped clean of any trace of human civilization.  Upon arrival one plane was immediately lost, fortunately the crew was able to make an emergency landing before the physical structure of the plane collapsed around them.  Unfortunately, their equipment and clothing was also quickly disintegrated, exposing them to the extreme cold of northern Alaska.  As a result six agents had to be treated for hypothermia, but all are expected to return to duty with no lasting effects.

After recovering the crew of the downed plane, agents set up a perimeter and were able to observe the epicenter of SCP-804's effect.  The surviving population of █████ █████ had crowded around the remains of the device.  All subjects observed were severely emaciated and suffering from severe hypothermia.  Exposure had only worsened the effect of SCP-804 and many subjects were observed with missing digits and even limbs.  The survivors were approaching the device in teams of two to three to push at the single remaining globe within SCP-804's housing in order to maintain its effect.  As each subject eventually succumbed and collapsed, another from the crowd of onlookers would shuffle forward to take their place.  Survivors were seen to be cheering and encouraging those who were maintaining the device until their turn to push the frosted globe came up.

Agents were authorized by O5-█ to open fire on the crowd.  Although bullets experience the same decay as any other artifact, their velocity was enough to strike lethal wounds before decomposition.  When the remaining globe of SCP-804 ceased to spin, the effect ended and agents were able to move in and secure the device.  Survivors attempted to resist but lacked the strength to impede Foundation agents and began to act in a disoriented manner once they were removed from SCP-804.  With no adequate facilities remaining to provide shelter for them all, many survivors chose to simply lay down in the snow and die while others attempted to provoke agents into using lethal force upon them.  Those who were taken into custody refused to answer any questions and were able to refuse enough care that they did not recover from their physical decay.

As exposure to the extreme elements of northern Alaska appears to adequately contain SCP-804 by freezing its remaining machinery in place, it was decided to leave the device on site and under guard along with a [DATA EXPUNGED] in the unlikely event that a hostile faction attempts to secure the device.

**Addendum**

SCP-804 is not to be contained within any SCP facility until it is certain that we will be able to prevent anyone from being compelled to activate or maintain the rotation of the globe.  Even a few minutes of SCP-804's effect could destroy its own containment and seriously compromise any other containment nearby.

**Memetic Research Report**

> I understand that command is unhappy with our progress regarding the hypothetical memetic component of SCP-804.  Please understand that every standard test in the book has been run at least three times or more, and we've also developed and performed many other new tests beyond that.  Beyond lacking any particularly notable memetic trigger SCP-804 does not emit any unusual radiation or display any congnitohazardous properties when inactive and nothing beyond the physical effect of its active state has been observed.  The "feelings of unease" reported among the personnel here on site can be directly attributed to frustration and exposure to the unusual days and bitter cold up here in the middle of nowhere.
> 
> No one wants to turn this thing on with the obvious exception of some of our D-Class sociopaths who would respond similarly to a large red button labeled EVERYTHING DIES.  SCP-804 has no control over anyone, period, and I doubt that it ever did.  Hell, give me some black paint and a crowbar and I'll make this thing safe enough to display in the courtyard at Site ██!

> We've reached a point where all possibilities but one have been eliminated.  We do not need to look any further than what we already know about human nature and group dynamics to understand why these people threw themselves and pushed their neighbors into the deadly workings of a sculpture that was going to wipe all human life off of Mother Earth.
