= //I hope some crazy government shoots me out of the sky so I can get this hell over with.//

[[collapsible show="Commentary" hide="Commentary"]]

**Commentary:** My first SCP posted. I still have a soft spot for it, and am still a bit surprised that this dorky idea about Santa Claus being a time traveling prisoner of the Foundation //actually worked out//. I mean I'm not complaining. I really want to make an image for this, but I am to lazy to do that at the moment.

**Fun Fact:** The original draft had Santa get killed by the Global Occult Coalition launching a missile at him. This however, was pretty dumb.

= //Jesus is my favorite snake width too!//

[[collapsible show="Commentary" hide="Commentary"]]

**Commentary:** This was an idea I've had for a while, before dado was popular actually. When I found out about dado I was like "well shit", but then I still tried to pull this off, and people like it, so I guess that's a good thing! This seriously though is one of my first ideas for an SCP I've ever had, and so this article is a lot more personal to me. 

**Fun Fact:** The number for this one is actually an A1B2Z26 cipher for dog, meaning D=4 O=15 and G=7.

= With [[*user The Trashman]]
= //And while you wait, why not wonder what might be out there for a change?//

[[collapsible show="Commentary" hide="Commentary"]]

**Commentary:** This was a collab piece with [[*user The Trashman]], who I know in real life. The entire writing process of this basically consists of him coming up with the idea, him writing a draft, me seeing the draft and saying "no that bad" and then rewriting 70% of it. I added the spooky ending, and just hope that I have made his first SCP a good one. 

**Fun Fact:** The main idea for this according to Trashman came from the "The stranger the fear the better" line in the How To Write An SCP guide.

= //We have heard your cries in the teeth of our patients.//

[[collapsible show="Commentary" hide="Commentary"]]

**Commentary:** So yeah teeth. Funnily enough, this sorta started out as a SCP-089-ARC rewrite, I however decided to overhaul the entire concept and just make it about a tooth god. This is one of my favorite works I've written, surpassed on by SCP-5666. It was so fun to put together the logs and have everything come into place in the end.

**Fun Fact:** Every single image in this besides the header image was found using the "Random File" button on Wikimedia Commons.

= //Instance was then captured with a mason jar and removed from the premises.//
[[collapsible show="Commentary" hide="Commentary"]]

**Commentary:** One day, I saw there was a free series 4 slot open. Another day, I found the image for the -1 instances. Another day, I wrote the entirety of this and posted it. I had fun writing this one too, and just wanted to write something purely out of clinical tone without any form of interviews or notes or anything as a break from writing Collaboration-Con entries. 

**Fun Fact:** idk something?

= //He is an other-worldly father of capitalism dammit!//
[[collapsible show="Commentary" hide="Commentary"]]

**Commentary:** part two of the Collab-Con articles, this is a long one, and I was hoping it wouldn't be //too// long and boring. Luckily we cut the objects down to 5 from like, 7 I think? Along with some other bits and pieces like moving the journal entries to the tale. This was equally as fun to write as the tale, Deadly Bread's a cool lad. 

**Fun Fact:** "Alexander Katenbrot" is last-named after a type of bread, you can thank Deadly Bread for that.

= [[span style="color:green"]][S][[/span]] [[[SCP-3902]]] - anomaly class bar by dado
= //bone class: none//
[[collapsible show="Commentary" hide="Commentary"]]

**Commentary:** Holy FUCK this thing blew up. I came up with the idea like a day after the anomaly classification system thingy came out after just, like, immediately jumping to granola bars when I heard "anomaly class bar". I sat on the idea for a couple days until the morning of my birthday, and then cranked out the entire thing in about 4 hours. 

How much attention this is getting is nutty (ha) to me, it got its fair share of downvotes from people who can't handle THE FUTURE but that's fine too.

**Fun Fact:** i literally don't know i already said this was written on my birthday so uhhhh??

= ,,[[[scp5000contesthub|SCP-5000 Contest]]] Entry -- 17th Place,,

= //Her dress is an elegant shade of color.//

[[collapsible show="Commentary" hide="Commentary"]]
**Commentary:** 5k-con was nuts for me. I went through about five or so drafts before I wrote this one, and god did I enjoy writing this. I started listening to the album set linked in the number and author post, Everywhere at the End of Time, around the time of its creation, which stirred some very visceral fears of memory loss for me. 

The concept for this, when writing the initial description, was going to be some plane that goes into other dimensions with XK-Class Scenarios. It was a bad idea and I never fleshed it out at all. After several hours of The Caretaker in my head, I finally settled on this idea. 

There's a lot of stuff I liked about writing this, mainly the final log, during the writing of which I only felt this subtle melancholy feeling. Making the Administrator a women and gay was cool too, I did it simply because it felt right (also because why not?). 

17th place wasn't too bad for the contest, as my goal was to get above 20th. I choose 5666 for several reasons, such as giving a subtle comparison of dementia to hell, and to near match my 4667 slotted article. 

So this is the best thing I've written in my eyes, and when it hopefully kicks "anomaly class bar by dado"'s ass and becomes my highest rated article, I will be able to freely ascend to the heavens. 

**Fun Fact:** I listened to Everywhere at the End of Time about six or so times while writing this, that's about 36 hours of The Caretaker pumped into creating this.

[[collapsible show="Commentary" hide="Commentary"]]

**Commentary:** Part one of two to the Collab-Con Articles, I was the only one around during the writing of the wizard fight scene and the ending, although we equally contributed to that in concept. We really just wanted to WACK people in the face with dado half way through, which worked. Most of this was written on like, the day posting ended due to me procrastinating a ton and loosing steam, so I'm glad it turned out good. 

**Fun Fact:** This was the first Professor A.W. article in 5 years. Mostly because it was a pet PoI for a inactive author.

**Commentary:** I was sent a wendigo x bigfoot parawatch fanfic one day through discord, then this happened. I came up with part of the Kali idea and the Puppet thingy, and helped write it a bunch. 

**Fun Fact:** The puppet thing was from me just looking on the fictional creatures Wikimedia Commons category for inspiration.

= //But all that flesh couldn't have come from four sheep.//

[[collapsible show="Commentary" hide="Commentary"]]

**Commentary:**Â Â This article has had quite the history. This used to be on an site called "The Wayward Society", which was basically just a spinoff SCP site that was probably as far as you could get from just ripping off the site. I won't delve much into the details but, that site went to the wayside, and in the process, me and some others pulled their articles from the site, with me leaving staff on there. 

It was around (or actually before) when I pulled the original Barns from Nowhere off that site that Parawatch exploded, causing me to immediately start rewriting the article for Parawatch. It took a while but I got it up after [[*user Ellie3]] kept yelling at me to do it, and with some last minute critique from [[*user A Random Day]] it was good and still is pretty good. 

This iteration is definitely better than the last time, the horror is much more subtle, and it's just a lot less cringe overall. 

**Fun Fact:** barns are cool i like da barn
