= [[span style="color:red"]][K][[/span]] [[[SCP-4255]]] - Santa Claus, the Time Traveler
= //I hope some crazy government shoots me out of the sky so I can get this hell over with.//

[[collapsible show="Commentary" hide="Commentary"]]

**Commentary:** My first SCP posted. I still have a soft spot for it, and am still a bit surprised that this dorky idea about Santa Claus being a time traveling prisoner of the Foundation //actually worked out//. I mean I'm not complaining. I really want to make an image for this, but I am to lazy to do that at the moment.

**Fun Fact:** The original draft had Santa get killed by the Global Occult Coalition launching a missile at him. This however, was pretty dumb.

= [[span style="color:red"]][K][[/span]] [[[SCP-4157]]] - WANT DOG
= //Jesus is my favorite snake width too!//

[[collapsible show="Commentary" hide="Commentary"]]

**Commentary:** This was an idea I've had for a while, before dado was popular actually. When I found out about dado I was like "well shit", but then I still tried to pull this off, and people like it, so I guess that's a good thing! This seriously though is one of my first ideas for an SCP I've ever had, and so this article is a lot more personal to me. 

**Fun Fact:** The number for this one is actually an A1B2Z26 cipher for dog, meaning D=4 O=15 and G=7.

= [[span style="color:green"]][S][[/span]] [[[SCP-4488]]] - [[span style="font-family:times new roman;"]][[size 125%]]Thalassophobia[[/span]][[/size]]
= //And while you wait, why not wonder what might be out there for a change?//

[[collapsible show="Commentary" hide="Commentary"]]

**Commentary:** This was a collab piece with [[*user The Trashman]], who I know in real life. The entire writing process of this basically consists of him coming up with the idea, him writing a draft, me seeing the draft and saying "no that bad" and then rewriting 70% of it. I added the spooky ending, and just hope that I have made his first SCP a good one. 

**Fun Fact:** The main idea for this according to Trashman came from the "The stranger the fear the better" line in the How To Write An SCP guide.

[[tab Questions]]
These are questions I feel I will be asked, if you have more, just ask.

**Who is that radical cat in your profile picture?** 

That's MY radical cat. I have two, but the other is pitch black, so every picture of them is just a black void with eyes. 

**What is your name about?**

It's the second half of miscellaneous, Laneous. It's pronounced 'Lan-E-ous', anyone saying 'L-anus' will be tracked and smacked with a stainless steel toaster oven.
