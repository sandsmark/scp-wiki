**Duties:** Design and maintenance of complex SCP containment units

**SCPs Researched:**
[[[SCP-493| SCP-493 - Replicant]]]

------

**History:**
Dr. Rath holds degrees in multiple fields of engineering, and has done extensive work in the physics research community, developing new methods of containment for fusion and high energy experimentation.  He was noticed by the Foundation after successfully replicating the energy absorption properties of SCP-███ during his work on the Large Hadron Collider. The removal of Dr. Rath from the project may or may not have directly resulted in the 09/19/08 breakdown of the LHC.

Since joining the foundation, Dr. Rath has improved the safety of various containment chambers of Euclid and Keter level SCPs. He has also researched and documented some SCPs outside his field of study, seeking to expand his knowledge base. Dr. Rath has also become friends with [[[SCP-493| SCP-493-2]]], and enjoys coffee and chess with him regularly.

**Notes:**
Dr. Rath has a “lucky” 1804 silver dollar. He often leaves decisions up to the coin when he cannot make up his mind. This has not resulted in any negative incidents as of yet.

Dr. Rath is often seen napping at his desk or in the break room, and is rarely seen actually doing work, yet his assignments mysteriously get done on time.

Don’t hold private conversations around a sleeping Dr. Rath, expecting he won’t be listening to you, because chances are that he will remember the entire conversation.

Dr. Rath wears gloves at all times to keep from touching things. Try not to ask him to do otherwise.
