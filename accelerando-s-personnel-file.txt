[[/div]]
**Name:** Alex Ron Doe

**Security Clearance:** Level 1

**Position:** Your --friendly-- neighborhood janitor

**History:** Mr. Ron Doe was found aimlessly wandering the streets of [REDACTED] during the containment breach of SCP-████. After being subsequently harassed for it's possesions by SCP-████, he was then subdued by Agents, who also managed to contain SCP-████ after offering assorted fruits to it.

Prior to the administering of amnestics, Mr. Ron Doe mentioned that he was a musician and composer, and would prefer not to forget how to properly play a kettle drum. It was then agreed that he could take up the position of janitor at Site-10, and occasionally perform during lunch and break hours. However, staff were not informed of Mr. Ron Doe's love of the atonal, minimalistic, aleatoric, and pretty much any damn avant-garde genre of music. He was subsequently booed off the stage during his first performance of //Music for 18 Musicians// for being unable to play two marimbas at once.

* [[[SCP-1940]]] The Anywhere Store 
   [[collapsible show="+ Really guud wares!!1!" hide="- Only da best prices here at [DATA EXPUNGED]"]]
After my first SCP went down (a mirrored elevator with a ghost apparition or something), I was slightly discouraged. I used one of my fears to make this, but it still crashed and burned. Well, I guess I wouldn't say "crashed and burned", it was more like "slowly cooked to a crisp in the oven". Still, I looked at each piece of advice given to me, and moved on. 

I then got the idea for this on my way to my next class. There was a bathroom sort of right next to the band room, but not exactly connected. I remembered how much shit (no pun intended) we kept in their for storage, and wondered if we should sell them all. Then, BAM, an idea! After writing it out and having it kicked off the main list (again), Scantron suggested a different approach to the idea, and Crayne helped me rewrite it, making it what it is today.

* [[[SCP-1920]]] Turbine of the Future!
   [[collapsible show="+ CROSSING TEH DIMENSIONS " hide="- LCE DOES NOT APPROVE"]]
I was surprised at the success of this one (Unsurprisingly, after a rewrite). I forced myself to look around my room and come up with an idea, and my eyes fell upon this old science project I made.

Once again Crayne swooped in, liking the idea and helped tighten it up. I had begun to get more confident in my writing skills, but like Crayne said, I was still missing some details which were quite important in making a solid SCP.

* [[[SCP-1490]]] Animal Sculptor 
   [[collapsible show="+ Don't try this at home kiddies" hide="- It ain't worth it. I know. O_O"]]
The inspiration for this was from a nightmare. I'd rather not disclose on //all// the details, but basically it was a giant, costumed, big-headed thing that morphed people into animal shapes.

This had evolved from a big headed kid that was mistakenly similar to another kid SCP that replaced other kids a family. Luckily, Dexanote pointed that out, and the SCP's progress went on a hiatus.

That dream pretty much made up what I wanted it to be, with a little backstory behind it to supplement it. This was also my first draft that didn't get a line by line review; I felt like throwing it around chat helped it the most.

[[collapsible show="+ About Light Courier Enterprises" hide="- We're still alive"]]
Though it started out as a placeholder name, I'm sort of half-taking it seriously right now. Like I mentioned in "The Leak" thread, LCE isn't one organization, but rather several groups of people in a futuristic fallout. These "people" are using the name and technology of LCE, because either:

1) They used to be an employee. This wasnt called "Enterprises" for nothing.

2) They're trying to be a smartass. Very little people are civil in an apocalypse.

3) They want to rebuild LCE. Think something along the lines of the Enclave from Fallout 3.

4) [Insert another one of the many possible reasons why here]

So in [[[SCP-1940]]], you have people from #2, and in [[[SCP-1920]]] we have people from #3.

This certainly isn't one of the most creative GOI's, but I do plan to use it sometime in the future. Go ahead and use it if you want too, and I could look it over. :)
