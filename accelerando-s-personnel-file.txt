[[/div]]

**Name:** Alex Ron Doe

**Security Clearance:** Level 1

**Position:** Your --friendly-- neighborhood janitor

**History:** Mr. Ron Doe was found aimlessly wandering the streets of [REDACTED] during the containment breach of SCP-████. After being subsequently harassed for its possessions by SCP-████, he was then subdued by Agents, who also managed to contain SCP-████ after offering assorted fruits to it.

Prior to the administering of amnestics, Mr. Ron Doe mentioned that he was a musician and composer, and would prefer not to forget how to properly play a kettle drum. It was then agreed that he could take up the position of janitor at Site-30, and occasionally perform during lunch and break hours. However, staff were not informed of Mr. Ron Doe's love of the atonal, minimalistic, aleatoric, and pretty much any damn avant-garde genre of music. He was subsequently booed off the stage during his first performance of //Music for 18 Musicians// for being unable to play two marimbas at once.

**SCP-1940:** After my first SCP went down (a mirrored elevator with a ghost apparition or something), I was slightly discouraged. I used one of my fears to make this, but it still crashed and burned. Well, I guess I wouldn't say "crashed and burned", it was more like "slowly cooked to a crisp in the oven". Still, I looked at each piece of advice given to me, and moved on. 

I then got the idea for this on my way to my next class. There was a bathroom sort of right next to the band room, but not exactly connected. I remembered how much shit (no pun intended) we kept in there for storage, and wondered if we should sell it all. Then, BAM, an idea! After writing it out and having it kicked off the main list (again), Scantron suggested a different approach to the idea, and Crayne helped me rewrite it, making it what it is today.

**SCP-1920:** I was surprised at the success of this one (unsurprisingly, after a rewrite). I forced myself to look around my room and come up with an idea, and my eyes fell upon this old science project I'd made.

Once again Crayne swooped in, liking the idea and helped tighten it up. I had begun to get more confident in my writing skills, but like Crayne said, I was still missing some details which were quite important in making a solid SCP. 

I'm sure you can figure out what happened in this SCP, if you read about LCE.

**SCP-1490:** The inspiration for this was from a nightmare. I'd rather not disclose on //all// the details, but basically it was a giant, costumed, big-headed thing that morphed people into animal shapes.

This had evolved from a big-headed kid that was mistakenly similar to another kid SCP that replaced other kids a family. Luckily, Dexanote pointed that out, and the SCP's progress went on a hiatus.

That dream pretty much made up what I wanted it to be, with a little backstory behind it to supplement it. This was also my first draft that didn't get a line by line review; I felt like throwing it around chat helped it the most.

And by the way, this people that come to him are from AWCY. They tried to vein him for art projects, but realized he was batshit crazy after "sculpting" his parents. Poor little bastard reality bender.

**SCP-1740:** This was for the 5-word challenge by Dmatix, and I gotta say I enjoyed writing this one. I admit the words were a bit easy (playground, number, saliva, prison, guillotine) but I'm still happy with how this turned out. 

I also wanted an excuse to use LCE again, so I thought: "Why not have them make a system to prepare their children for their corrupted world?"

And yeah screw getting critique only LongWayHome looked at it (who actually does good reviews).

**SCP-1640:** So I came on chat late at night, and found Meserach using a random word generator for some guy, who was making ideas on the spot. I joined in, and eventually the words "satellite" and "rabbit" came up. I suggested a rabbit with a little den in a satellite, and others in chat pushed for Meserach to use it, which he reluctantly plopped in his sandbox (I had only written two things at the time, and I wanted the rabbit to sing a song. You can imagine why I knew I couldn't write it). 

Time passed, and Meserach still hadn't --done shit-- written a draft. So I started to work on it, and after ANOTHER rewrite, I managed to elicit mild feels from people. Finally. [[size 0.8em]] And now on to what it's about.[[/size]]

The story of the Rabbit in the Moon has always stuck with me from childhood, mainly because of the fact that it involved a rabbit throwing almost throwing itself into a fire for a poor man to eat. 

This started out as being a rabbit simply wanting to go to the moon. Then it became a son of a mother rabbit who sent we son to control the satellite giving religious offerings to the Moon Rabbit, and he crashes it because he feels his life is pointless now that his mother brushed him off as the runt he is. Sleeping on ideas can help when writing.

**SCP-1530:** Oh boy, this one. This is probably the crown jewel of my work.

I've put several weeks into this, which started from a simple animal abuse idea. It turned into a reality bender's pets. I don't have a clue how that happened.

Fantem was a heavy inspiration in making this, and all of his works as well. So give him a hand.

...that's all I have to say about this. It was great fun painting this story. Maybe I'll write a tale.

**SCP-1860:** Herman-Fuller's Circus of the Disquieting has been an original and interesting GOI for me. I've always wanted to write for it, so I decided that Herman Fuller was slowly becoming like Wondertainment, and dabbling in anomalies. Somehow, he ended up making a piece of sheet music turn into //this// thing. He thought it was cute, gave it a little side tent for his circus, but slowly forgot about it in his excitement for finding other anomalies.

Poor little dude. He thinks that he was forgotten on accident; all he's happy about is that he loves his master.

**SCP-1580:** Lowest Rated Article? Yes.
"Fuk da polise" joke? Yes.
Attempt to give the reader mystery, then turn around and slap them with humor? Yes.
Fun while writing this? Quite a lot.

**SCP-1544:** User bluesoul posted a .gif of a fancy rainbow slinky man. I said I would write about it, Pendragon said he would write about it, and he proposed we collaborate. 

And that's how our escaped research experiment that met Wondertainment came to life.

[[tab Light Courier Enterprises]]
Though it started out as a placeholder name, I'm sort of half-taking it seriously right now. Like I mentioned in "The Leak" thread, LCE isn't one organization, but rather several groups of people in a futuristic fallout. The world isn't completely destroyed from nuclear bombing or wars of some sort; all of the technology present simply collapsed, and left everything in a state of chaos (imagine something like a futuristic utopia, with monstrosities and haywire automatons running wild in partially destroyed cities).

Light Courier Enterprises was responsible for most of the things gone wrong, from an excessive usage of experimental materials in their products. The remaining "people" have no knowledge of LCE's faults, and are using LCE's name because either:

1) They used to be an employee. This wasn't called "Enterprises" for nothing, and with millions of employees requires discipline behind average regulations.

2) They're trying to be a smartass. Of course there will be people who want personal gain, even in the end.

3) They want to rebuild LCE. Think something along the lines of the Enclave from Fallout 3; we have another group of people like that here.

4) They're shouting a cry of help. They hope someone puttered will recognize LCE's name.

5) [There may be many more possible explanations.]

So in [[[SCP-1940]]], you have people from #2, and in [[[SCP-1920]]] we have people from #3. [[[SCP-1740]]] is kind of #1, but only partially.

This certainly isn't one of the most creative GOI's, but I do plan to use it sometime in the future. Go ahead and use it if you want, and I could review it for you, no charge.
