+++ On-Site News

* The featured articles for this month are [[[SCP-1791]]] ("Mobile Homes") by [[*user astronautilus]] and [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/reach-s-blueprint-folder |Reach's Blueprint Folder]]] by [[*user Dr Reach]].

++++ Event-Featured Articles

+++++ September:

* September 19 was International Talk Like a Pirate Day! Yarr Gather 'round, and listen to [[*user Doctor Cimmerian]] and [[*user Faminepulse]]'s tale of [[[SCP-2986 | a ship in space]]], the crew of the voyajer, and their adventures.
* September 25-26 was World Dream Day! (Night?) Dreams can inspire us to make wonders of the blank slate that is the future. But what happens when something goes wrong with our sleep-time dreams? Consider the case of [[[SCP-2245 | A Dream's Nightmare]]], by [[*user DreamwalkerFae]].
* September 29 was National Coffee Day! Whether it's keeping you awake, functioning, sane, or some mix of the three, coffee is a pretty great drink! Just be careful if you're using [[[SCP-1786 | that strange coffee percolator]]] [[*user DrBerggren]] was talking about... 

+++++ October:

* October 14 was World Egg Day! Take a moment to think of the benefits of eggs. Such as the [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1657 |MAN EGG]]] that [[*user azzleflux]] told us about. --It seems a little questionable.-- //DO NOT LEAVE EGGS OUTSIDE OF A COLD ENVIRONMENT FOR MORE THAN HALF AN HOUR AT A TIME. IF ANYTHING EMERGES FROM YOUR MAN EGG, PLEASE CALL █-███-███-████.//
* October 28 was National Chocolate Day, a day to celebrate all things chocolate! Remember to watch out for that one [[[SCP-743 | chocolate fountain]]] by [[*user Quikngruvn]], though.
* October 31st was Halloween! Hope you had a happy All Hallows' Eve, mortals, enchanters, walkers of the world. Eat candy, spin stories, enjoy the night of fright with friends and folk alike. And, as [[*user Ihp]] will tell us of, let us [[[Dance the Danse]]]!  

++++ Rest of the News

* Holy cow, it's the one-year anniversary of the Site News! Everyone send [[*user Decibelles]] a thank-you for starting it and delivering your [bi-] monthly happenings on the site for the last twelve months!
* Congratulations to [[*user LurkD]]'s [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2521 |●●|●●●●●|●●|●]]] for being the first Series 3 SCP to reach the coveted +1000 votes!
* The [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/site-rules |Site Rules]]] have been updated! Self-upvoting (upvoting your own articles) is no longer against the rules!
* [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-1976778/november-2016-intros-writers |The Introduction Forums]]] have been updated! Now all new users can congregate into one thread to introduce themselves and meet other fresh faces!

Thanks for tuning in again, folks! If you're unsatisfied with the blurb(s) provided for the article(s) you wrote, feel free to change it. Of course, if you write an article and it sticks, //please// send [[*user A Random Day]] or [[*user rumetzen]] a blurb for your article. We may or may not use it (if we can think of something more attention-getting, though we can try to stick with one you give us) but we'd really would just like them in order to make the process easier for making these. This is a community thing, and I want authors to give their blurbs to sell these articles much easier. It reduces the workload we have to do, and helps the news come out that much earlier! 


Thank you all for continuing to be an excellent community <3
