**Item #:** SCP-649

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-649 is to be kept closed in a plain plastic bin. Item should not be opened unless testing is being performed.  Item is not to be moved from storage room ███ in site ██ unless testing is being performed. In case of containment failure, heating implements should be placed in the cell to combat SCP-649's effect.
    
**Description:** SCP-649 is a Diamond brand matchbox of standard thirty two (32) count. It has a mark on the underside of the box, resembling a snowflake. Whenever SCP-649 is left open for more than fifteen(15) minutes, its anomalous properties will manifest. SCP-649's anomalous properties can be divided into three stages. During stage one, the area SCP-649 is held in will experience a sudden decrease in temperature, followed by strong winds. These winds will still develop if the item is indoors.

Stage 2 occurs when the temperature in the area SCP-649 reaches zero degrees Celsius. When this occurs, the area around SCP-649 will begin to exude large amounts of snow and sleet. In addition, SCP-649's area of effect will rapidly increase, to a radius of 1km. The sleet and snow will be continuously produced by SCP-649 until the entire radius is covered by snowfall at least three(3) meters deep with a temperature below -30 degrees. When these criteria are met, and the area contains at least 25 human beings, SCP-649's stage three effect will initiate.

During Stage 3, SCP-649's area of effect will expand at a rate of 15 meters an hour, continuously. In addition, tundra-like conditions will develop near the epicenter of SCP-649's effect, expanding at the same rate as SCP-649's radius of effect. The temperature within SCP-649's radius will stay at a constant -45 degrees Celsius. This stage will continue indefinitely, with the only known means of halting the expansion of the area of effect being to close SCP-649's lid.
    
    **Addendum 649-A:** On ██/██/19██, during testing on SCP-649's third stage, Doctors Johnson and Pena (stationed on the perimeter of SCP-649's radius of effect) noted hearing children's laughter within SCP-649's radius of effect. No other personnel were noted to be within the area at the time.
