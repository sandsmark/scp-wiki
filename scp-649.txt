**Item #:** SCP-649

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-649 is to be kept closed in a plain plastic bin. Item should not be opened unless testing is being performed.  Item is not to be moved from storage room ███ in site ██ unless testing is being performed. In case of containment failure, heating implements should be placed in the cell to combat SCP-649's effect.
    
**Description:** SCP-649 is a Diamond brand matchbox of standard thirty two (32) count. It has a mark on the underside of the box, resembling a snowflake. Whenever SCP-649 is left open for more than fifteen(15) minutes, its anomalous properties will manifest. SCP-649's anomalous properties can be divided into three stages. During stage one, the area SCP-649 is held in will experience a sudden decrease in temperature, followed by strong winds. These winds will still develop if the item is indoors.

Stage 2 occurs when the temperature in the area SCP-649 reaches zero degrees Celsius. When this occurs, the area around SCP-649 will begin to exude large amounts of snow and sleet. In addition, SCP-649's area of effect will rapidly increase, to a radius of 1km. The sleet and snow will be continuously produced by SCP-649 until the entire radius is covered by snowfall at least three(3) meters deep with a temperature below -30 degrees. When these criteria are met, and the area contains at least 25 human beings, SCP-649's stage three effect will initiate.

During Stage 3, SCP-649's area of effect will expand at a rate of 15 meters an hour, continuously. In addition, tundra-like conditions will develop near the epicenter of SCP-649's effect, expanding at the same rate as SCP-649's radius of effect. The temperature within SCP-649's radius will stay at a constant -45 degrees Celsius. This stage will continue indefinitely, with the only known means of halting the expansion of the area of effect being to close SCP-649's lid.
    
   **Addendum 649-A:** SCP-649 was left open for approximately one hour and forty-eight minutes. After one hour and forty five minutes , children's laughing could be heard, and a snowball hit Dr. Pena. Silhouettes of small forms could be seen through the fugue. Three D-Class personnel were sent to investigate. When they did not return after an additional twenty minutes, SCP-649 was closed and containment protocol initiated. The D-Class personnel have not been recovered. When the tape was replayed, one of the D-Class could be seen led by small figures through the walls of the test chamber. Records on the missing personnel indicate all three (one male, two female) had had children who had died before adolescence. All testing with such personnel have been suspended.
