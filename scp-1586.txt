**Item #:** SCP-1586

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1586 is contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Humanoid Containment Site 06-3. SCP-1586 is to be fed a high-calorie diet and monitored at all times via biometric sensors. Any illness, distress, or inconsistencies in biometric readings are to be reported to off-site command at Site 19 immediately, and any medical procedure with the risk of inducing miscarriage must be approved by both the Site Director and Assistant Site Director.

Until final contingency procedures are developed, all non-essential personnel must evacuate the site in the event that SCP-1586 experiences a miscarriage or goes into labor.

**Description:** SCP-1586-1 is a human female of mixed European ancestry, approximately 17 years of age at initial containment. SCP-1586-1 is physiologically normal in all regards with the exception of being slightly emaciated as a result of long-term malnutrition due to the effects of SCP-1586-2, which have only been partially mitigated via the administration of a high-calorie diet. At time of last update, SCP-1586-1 has been in Foundation custody for the past five (5) years, during which she has been highly cooperative with Foundation personnel and thus poses a minimal security risk.

SCP-1586-2 is an anomalous object or entity suspended in the center of SCP-1586-1's womb that appears to be a perfect black body in the shape of a twelve-week-old human fetus. The object exhibits extreme lensing of electromagnetic radiation consistent with a gravitational singularity and is surrounded by what appears to be an accretion disk of nutrients and fluids absorbed from SCP-1586-1. Measurements of the object's properties has yielded a calculated mass of approximately 1.69 x 10^^25^^ kg; it is currently unknown why these effects are limited to the inside of SCP-1586-1's womb or why SCP-1586-1 is only minimally affected by its presence.

SCP-1586 came to the Foundation's attention on █/██/08 following [DATA EXPUNGED]. Amnestics were administered to the sonogram clinic staff and all civilian witnesses, and a cover story given to SCP-1586's parents involving [REDACTED].

**Addendum 1586-01:** Incident Report

> On ██/█/08 SCP-1586-1 became extremely ill as a result of accidental exposure to a pre-symptomatic Foundation caretaker infected with an influenza virus. During the following week, multiple malfunctions in gravimetric and radiometric sensors as well as intermittent power fluctuations were reported at Humanoid Containment Site 06-3 consistent with the most serious periods of illness in SCP-1586-1.
> 
> It is theorized that SCP-1586-1 is somehow containing the effects of SCP-1586-2, which was disrupted during her period of illness; subsequent examination showed a 1.3% increase in the suggested mass of SCP-1586-2 which seems to support this theory. The research staff believes that if SCP-1586-2 were separated from SCP-1586-1, either through birth, miscarriage, or surgical removal, it would exert the full effect of a gravitational singularity.
> 
> Until such time that we can find a permanent solution to this problem, I am requesting that we keep SCP-1586-1 as healthy and comfortable as possible.

**Addendum 1586-02:** Administrative Note, ██/██/09

> Request approved. Do what you have to.

**Addendum 1586-03:** Observer Note, █/█/10

> Administering a high-calorie diet and additional medical care appears to have improved SCP-1586-1's condition, but has also slightly increased the rate at which SCP-1586-2 is gaining mass. While it's not growing as fast as a real human fetus would, the last snapshot we took seems to indicate that the shape and size of SCP-1586-2 are now consistent with that of a fetus at 16 weeks.
> 
> We have no clue where it's getting the extra mass from, but at this rate we may have less than five years before it becomes "full term" and that's not ruling out the possibility of premature labor. Even if we launched it out of the atmosphere, there would be no promise of safety as it is already twice the mass of Earth and still growing.
