**Item #:** SCP-356

**Object Class:** Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** The remains of SCP-356 are to be kept continuously frozen in Long Term Biological Storage Unit 73A at Site-23. Staff are advised that SCP-356 has been a person of interest to the governments of the United States, the Russian Federation, and the Republic of Azerbaijan since 1986. As such, liaisons to the Foundation serving with these nations or affiliated entities are to be kept unaware of SCP-356's containment in 1986 and death in 1987.  

Except for approved research purposes, no phones or electronic devices capable of audio or visual output are to be brought within 10 m of SCP-356. 

**Description:** SCP-356 was a 62-year-old male human of Eurasian descent at the time of its initial containment, measuring 1.76 m tall and weighing 81.5 kg.  SCP-356 exhibited anomalous effects on electronic devices. These effects took place when SCP-356 was in close proximity (approximately a 3 m radius) to such devices, and varied depending on the nature of the device:

* When SCP-356 was near any device capable of receiving a telephone call (such as traditional land-based telephones, cellular phones, or computer terminals with software enabling telephony), that device would begin receiving a constant stream of calls. Left unanswered, these calls would continue for an indefinite period, only ceasing when answered, and resuming once the speaker hung up. When calls prompted by the presence of SCP-356 were answered by a third party, no speaker was present, though the line will remain open as long as the third party is on the line. When SCP-356 answered these phone calls, a voice exactly matching that of SCP-356 would respond. All attempts to trace the source of the calls showed the devices receiving those calls as the point of origin. 

* When SCP-356 was near a device intended for the reception of radio transmissions, only static interference was audible, regardless of what signal the radio was tuned to prior to being affected. If the device was tuned to 87.6 MHz while other individuals were in the presence of SCP-356, the sound of a man humming in a tuneless manner in a voice exactly matching that of SCP-356 was clearly audible. If SCP-356 was alone, the signal audible at 87.6 MHz became similar in content to that heard when SCP-356 answered phone calls.  

* When SCP-356 was near any device capable of displaying video output, that device would display an accurate image of SCP-356 and its surroundings at the given time, from a perspective directly facing the front of SCP-356 and level with its face from a distance of approximately one meter. This image would persist for a time period ranging from four minutes to six hours, after which deviations in visual content would occur.   

**Experiment Log-356:** Listing of SCP-356 Phenomena

||~ Experiment Number ||~ Date ||~ Medium ||~ Summary of Results ||
|| E356.11A || 07/29/1986 || Land-based telephone, factory specifications || A telephone connected to a working line is placed in SCP-356's observation chamber. The telephone begins ringing, and is allowed to do so 28 times before a researcher answers. No response is heard. Research staff then allow phone to ring 132 more times before SCP-356 is instructed to answer. A voice exactly matching that of SCP-356 is heard on the line, stating background information on SCP-356 such as biometric data, known associates, and a detailed history of SCP-356's record as an operative in the Azerbaijan SSR division of the Soviet KGB. This information is later verified to be completely accurate. || 
|| E356.18G || 09/02/1986 || United States Army-issued standard radio set || A radio set is placed in the same observation chamber as SCP-356 and tuned by a research staff member to 87.6 MHz. An individual with SCP-356's voice is heard humming. Researchers leave the observation chamber. The transmission received by the radio set then proceeds to list details of the operations of Frontier Energy Consulting Ltd., a known (at the time of the experiment) KGB front company operating in Baku, and also describes SCP-356's role in overseeing its activities, which primarily consisted of industrial espionage. Information is verified to be accurate. ||
|| E356.24B || 03/12/1987 || 30 cm color television set, factory specifications || A television is brought into an observation chamber with SCP-356 and switched on. Television displays image of SCP-356 sitting at the table in the chamber in an accurate manner. Image continues to be accurate for approximately fifteen minutes before changes occur. At the sixteen minute mark, the television displays SCP-356 standing up and walking around the room (SCP-356 remains motionless and is instructed to watch the television screen). SCP-356 is depicted pacing slowly back and forth in the chamber, until Researcher ████ steps back into the scene. Video feed goes to static 34 minutes after commencement of experiment. ||
|| E356.26K || 05/22/1987 || Commercially available radio set, factory specifications || Radio is brought into observation chamber with SCP-356 as in previous tests. After researchers leave the chamber, the speaker documented in previous experiments describes the capture of SCP-356 by persons affiliated with the Central Intelligence Agency after the failed KGB attempt to assassinate ██████ ██████ (known to the Foundation as "Operation █████"). The speaker heard on the radio interrupts this narrative at various intervals to describe the current mental state and thought processes of SCP-356, including references to physical characteristics of attendant researchers. ||  
|| E356.31C || 05/30/1987 || Cellular phone equipped with additional recording device for observational purposes || As in previous experiments, phone starts ringing immediately after being brought into the presence of SCP-356. When SCP-356 is asked to answer the phone, a conversation begins between SCP-356 and the entity on the other end of the line. However, the conversation is limited to the entity in question asking SCP-356 about its current status, and then responding to any answer given with "run. Start running, they have plans for you," punctuated by brief laughter. SCP-356 is asked to terminate the phone call after thirteen minutes of observation. ||
|| E356.34A || 07/02/1987 || Digital signal processing radio receiver || Radio is brought into observation chamber with SCP-356 as in previous tests. After SCP-356 is left alone in the chamber, the entity speaking in previous broadcasts describes in precise detail SCP-356's knowledge of specific KGB operations in the Caspian Sea region (which includes activities related to SCP-███ prior to its containment), as well as SCP-356's escape from CIA custody. Portions of the information provided during this observation remain unverifiable at this time, however many details are consistent with Foundation files and information recovered during the initial containment of SCP-356 and its subsequent intake interrogation. ||
|| E356.41L || 07/13/1987 || Personal computer video monitor || As in prior observations, video monitor displays an image of SCP-356 upon being brought into its presence; however, resolution of the image is poor due to technological constraints related to the computer monitor. After one hour and 12 minutes, the image changes to SCP-356 in a different setting, displaying a room that is not the observation chamber. Three unknown human figures are depicted entering the room and restraining SCP-356 to a chair. One figure then holds SCP-356's left hand down on a table, appears to speak to SCP-356, and then hits its hand with what looks to be a hammer or similar implement. The scene depicted continues in a similar manner for three hours and 14 minutes before cutting to static. ||

**Addendum 356-1:** On 08/09/1987, SCP-356 suffered an acute myocardial infarction leading to cardiac arrest and heart failure. Foundation medical staff were unable to revive SCP-356, resulting in its clinical death later that day. An autopsy revealed the cause of death to be natural, and related to a medical history of heart disease. SCP-356 reclassified from "Euclid" to "Neutralized" effective 08/11/1987. 

**Addendum 356-2:** On 04/15/2009, a maintenance worker in Long Term Biological Storage Unit 73A reported that their personal cellular phone was receiving repeated, unremitting calls from an unknown source while on duty. After reviewing case histories, research staff traced the cause of this phenomenon to the remains of SCP-356. Request for additional experimentation and reclassification of object class pending.
