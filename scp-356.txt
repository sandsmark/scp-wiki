**Item #:** SCP-356

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP is to be kept in a featureless room, the walls of which are to be carved from marble. SCP-356-2 (see below) is to be built into the floor of said room in such a manner as to make removal impossible. The door to this room will be disguised as a plain wall from the outside, via advanced holography. Personnel attempting to find the door without authorization are to be shot on sight if D-class, otherwise detained.

**Description:** SCP-356 is a statue of a nude woman, 1.1m tall, lying on a flat slab, carved out of [DATA EXPUNGED]. While usually still, the humanoid portion of the carving (designated 356-1) will animate slowly when a dead body is brought within ██m of the SCP. It will seek out living targets nearby, moving quietly until it can render its attack, which it accomplishes by moving its "hand" into the back of a target's head. This action leaves no visible wound or hole, and the target's skull receives no apparent damage. However, [REDACTED] hours after this attack, the victim will fall over dead without warning, the surface of his or her brain totally calcified. 356-1 will strike up to three victims in this manner before returning to the slab (designated 356-2), there reassuming its inanimate state.

SCP-356 was brought to the Foundation's attention after a number of unexplained deaths in one city, where it was noted that the victims' heads were unusually heavy. Post-mortem reports of each victim stated that the brain had been transformed into something unidentified, a [DATA EXPUNGED]. Undercover agents destroyed the files and [REDACTED] the coroners. Tests were conducted at Site ██, with D-class personnel acting as mourners at a staged funeral, whereby the Foundation learned that SCP-356-1 was capable of moving through concrete, granite, and [REDACTED], leading to the protocols listed above.
