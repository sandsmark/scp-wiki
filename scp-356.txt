**Item #:** SCP-356

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** As this SCP is immovable by any means available, a contingent of █ agents are to be posted, disguised as janitorial staff of █████████ Cemetery. They will observe any activations of the SCP and report any outcomes. People who emerge from the SCP muttering fatalistic statements (e.g. "The world is doomed") are to be immediately taken to Site ██ for evaluation, interviewing and [REDACTED].

**Description:** SCP-356 is a statue of a nude woman, 1.1m tall, lying on a flat slab, carved out of [DATA EXPUNGED]. While usually still, the humanoid portion of the carving will periodically "sink" into the slab. The nearby person (as this has only been observed happening when exactly one person is near SCP-356) will experience a compulsion to first touch the slab's top surface, then climb up onto it. Intended subjects who climb atop the slab will then fall into it, leaving behind any items of technology. After [REDACTED], the subject will be thrust out of one side of the SCP uninjured, and the humanoid portion will re-emerge in its normal position. All subjects thus far have adamantly refused to discuss what happened inside SCP-356 even under threat of death, and those who emerged with unidentified objects on their persons have likewise been tight-lipped about their acquisitions.

**Addendum:** On ██/██/09, personnel D-42966 was near SCP-356 when it activated. He returned from the SCP shivering, though he exhibited no other signs of exposure to cold temperature. Agents were able to convince him to speak of his experience, but he was only able to say, "It was a--" before abruptly dying. Autopsy revealed that his heart had exploded.
