**Item #:** SCP-356

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** As this SCP is immovable by any means available, a contingent of █ agents are to be posted, disguised as janitorial staff of █████████ Cemetery. They will observe any activations of the SCP and report any outcomes. People who emerge from the SCP muttering fatalistic statements (e.g. "The world is doomed") are to be immediately taken to Site ██ for evaluation, interviewing and [REDACTED].

**Description:** SCP-356 is a statue of a nude woman, 1.1m tall, lying on a flat slab, carved out of [DATA EXPUNGED]. While usually still, the humanoid portion of the carving will periodically "sink" into the slab. The nearby person (as this has only been observed happening when exactly one person is near SCP-356) will experience a compulsion to first touch the slab's top surface, then climb up onto it. Intended subjects who climb atop the slab will then fall into it, leaving behind any items of technology. After [REDACTED], the subject will be thrust out of one side of the SCP uninjured, and the humanoid portion will re-emerge in its normal position. All subjects thus far have adamantly refused to discuss what happened inside SCP-356 even under threat of death, and those who emerged with unidentified objects on their persons have likewise been tight-lipped about their acquisitions.

**Addendum:** On ██/██/09, personnel D-42966 was near SCP-356 when it activated. He returned from the SCP shivering, though he exhibited no other signs of exposure to cold temperature. Agents were able to convince him to speak of his experience, but he was only able to say, "It was a--" before abruptly dying. Autopsy revealed that his heart had exploded.

After being granted permission to use [[[SCP-484]]] in an experiment with one target of SCP-356, Agent Green administered one dose to a Class D personnel, ordering him to look into the eyes of the "target". He then attempted to conduct an interview.

> **Green**: Now, Mr. ██████, if you could tell me what you witnessed while inside the SCP?
> **Class D**: Fuck you! Fuck all y'all, man! Y'all are outta yo' //minds//, man!
> **Green**: Calm down, please.
> **Class D**: Calm down, shit! How about I put you through all that bullshit and then me tell you calm down, how about that?
> **Green**: If you don't calm down, the guards will be forced to sedate you.
> **Class D**: Sedate this, motherfucker! *flips off Green*
> 
> A guard grabs the offending finger and bends it back, farther than said digit was meant to bend. While the Class D is screaming in pain, the guard injects a sedative.
> Two minutes pass while the sedative takes effect. The Class D's screaming becomes gradually less intense, and Green jots down a note, squirreling it away before anyone else can read it.
> 
> **Green**: Are you ready to cooperate with this interview now?
> **Class D**: Y...yeah... sure...
> **Green**: Good. Now if you could describe what you remember of the SCP's interior for me.
> **Class D**: A... hallway... kinda two on top of each other but kinda not...
> **Green**: Is there just the hallway or is something else in there with you?
> **Class D**: Uh... some kinda gray curtain thing... but it's like water. I remember... reachin' out to touch it, and...
> **Green**: And... what?
> **Class D**: And there was... a flash of dark, does that make sense?
> **Green**: I think I can extrapolate, yes. What then?
> **Class D**: I couldn't move... an' then this //thing// reached out to me and then... then I woke up on the grass and my necklace was gone. Wait, I don't have a necklace.
> **Green**: Forget about the necklace, Mr. ██████. Can you describe this //thing// for me?
> **Class D**: No way. It was twisted so far through dimensions I don't think there's words for it.
> **Green**: I see. Well, we're done for now. Try to remember the things that happened, Mr. ██████, as I may need to interview you again. And have your finger looked at.

The SCP's target mentioned above, one Ms. █████ █████████ is currently in a deep coma, and the Class D in the interview is under solitary guard for the rest of his term.
