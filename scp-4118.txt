**Item #:** SCP-4118

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-4118 is kept in a standard storage unit in Site K-40. All SCP-4118-1 instances are to be kept in an adjacent unit, and new instances are only to be created for testing and must be recorded. It is not recommended for more than three carnivorous instances of the same species to be active at once. Interaction with SCP-4118 instances is permitted, but no fighting is to be encouraged among the carnivorous instances. SCP-4118-2 are allowed to visit their imprinted instances, but are to maintain their daily routines, and not stay past their permitted time allocation.-- 

SCP-4118 is currently uncontained and in the possession of an unknown GOI (for details see Addendum 4118-A). The current population of SCP-4118-1 is to be maintained with selective breeding of instances. SCP-4118-1 instances are to be kept in a 50 x 45 x 4 meter containment cell, with small environmental features such as different biomes, hills, plants, and a river placed on the floor, that flows into a large pool set in the northeast corner of containment cell, where all aquatic SCP-4118-1 instances are to be kept. The pool is to be 15 meters deep, and to become shallower near the shore, allowing for a swamp biome to be created. A higher density of tall plants and bonsai trees is to be placed in the northwest corner, simulating a forest biome. The southern side of the cell, where the containment cell door is located, is to be an area with short shrubs and grass, simulating a grasslands biome. Perches are to be installed in varying heights of the wall for the aerial SCP-4118-1 instances.  The lights in the containment cell are to be placed on a 24-hour schedule, turning off during the night and turning on during the day. A sprinkler system is to be installed in the roof of the containent cell, using filtered water from the pool as its source of liquid. The sprinkler is to be activated once every four days, when no personnel are in the cell, as to water the plants. Interaction with SCP-4118 instances is permitted, but no personnel is allowed to stay in the containment cell beyond the times outlined in the visiting schedule. Personnel are not allowed to pick up SCP-4118-1, or instigate fights between instances. The schedule can be found in the cafeteria on the notice board. 

MTF Kappa-7 "Fun Police" is to monitor the county that SCP-4118 was found in for more anomalous activity, and intercept any instances that may be sold on the market. The [[[SCP-4110|Romagnoli-Bitler Wondertainment Suppression Protocol]]] is to be used to track down any additional SCP-4118 or SCP-4118-1 being sold online.

**Description:** SCP-4118 is a clear plastic tube resembling those commonly used for the packaging of plastic toy animals. A label on the interior obscures the contents of the tube. The label displays an unknown carnivorous dinosaur and several sauropods, with bright letters that read: “Dr. Wondertainment’s Tube O' Dinos!”. On the opposing side of the tube is a paragraph of text that reads: 

> Have you ever wanted your very own pet dinosaur? Have you ever wanted to recreate scenes from King Kong vs Godzilla? Well the newest invention straight from the genius mind of Dr. Wondertainment, does just that, with our new product, the **Tube O' Dinos®**! Simply shake the patented **Time Tube®** and you can have your very own tiny tyrants, and recreate a prehistoric landscape in your very own house!
> 
> [[size smaller]] May represent choking hazard to 3 or under. [[/size]]

SCP-4118 seems to have a mild cognitohazardous effect which instills a childlike attitude in subjects within a 2 meter radius, although this is easily dispelled with any amount of willpower or shock. Those who intentionally do not dispel the effect describe it as similar to nostalgia. A much stronger secondary cognitohazard occurs when SCP-4118 is damaged in any way. All who have interacted with the object previously will feel hostility towards the person who damaged it, however this never escalates to violence. This often results in the person who damaged SCP-4118 feeling remorse or guilt over damaging SCP-4118, even if the reason was justified. Whether this is part of the cognitohazard is unclear.

When opened, the tube appears to have a mirror covering the opening. This mirror appears to be non-anomalous, but appears to be extremely resistant to any form of damage. When shaken upside-down onto a surface, a SCP-4118-1 instance will be manifested.

SCP-4118-1 instances are small animate toys, made of a hard plastic similar to polyvinyl chloride (PVC)/thermoplastic elastomers (TPE)/crylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and resemble various prehistoric creatures, most commonly creatures from the Mesozoic Era and earlier. Instances resembling animals from the Cenozoic Era are rarely produced. --No humanoid instances have been produced thus far.-- Instances come in various sizes, ranging from 3 centimeters tall to █ meters tall, and appear to eat and drink, but it is not necessarily required, as the instances can live without sustenance for an indefinite period of time. Instances have been noted to be faster or more agile than previously assumed of their respective species, but it has been theorized that it is only due to their size and/or composition. SCP-4118-1 instances appear to gravitate towards biomes that appeal to their physiology (Brachiosaurus dwelling in forests, Triceratops living in savanna-like conditions). The majority of instances go into a form of stasis if the lights in their cell are deactivated, while certain carnivorous instances seem to be more active during this time. Herbivorous instances can be awakened by stimuli, and have been noted to respond to the vocalizations of their young when attacked by carnivorous instances.

When an instance is created, the first subject SCP-4118-1 sees within a 10-second time frame will be  imprinted upon (subject then designated SCP-4118-2). There seems to be no limit to how long the imprint lasts, as SCP-4118-1 instances have recognized and responded to SCP-4118-2 at least █ years after last contact. Behavior of instances are varied when near SCP-4118-2, but carnivorous instances have a marked decrease in aggression when near their "parent."

When a carnivorous SCP-4418-1 instance comes into contact with a smaller and/or herbivorous instance, the former will try to attack the latter, with the second trying to defend itself. Carnivorous entities appear to digest any plastic they consume[[footnote]]As such, no cross-testing with [[[SCP-387|other sentient plastic anomalies]]] is to be conducted at this time[[/footnote]][[footnote]]This ability extends to all types of plastics, including, but not limited to, Acetal, Acrylic, CE Canvas Phenlonic, and some types of plastic explosives, despite not being made out of plastic.[[/footnote]], although no excrement or growth of the instance is noted. Carnivorous instances have also been known to form a pack with similar members of its species, which then try to take down herbivorous, and even carnivorous instances larger than them.

SCP-4118-1 do not age, but can be terminated if their head is severed from their neck, or more than 30% of their body mass is not present. An example would be "Lucky," a nickname given by site personnel to a Variant-01 instance, which is the oldest and largest SCP-4118-1 terrestrial instance in the Foundation's care. "Lucky" is 0.75 meters tall, and missing chunks of its body from attacks by carnivorous instances. It is missing around 17% of its body mass, such as a large portion of the end of its tail, gouges in its torso, a missing left forelimb, and deep bite marks around its neck. It has lived with these damages since 20██, and appears to be in good condition nonetheless. No regrowth of body mass has been noted.

SCP-4118-1 instances have been known to reproduce, but how they do so is largely unclear, as they lack genitalia or cloaca to reproduce with. When two members of the same species are together for about ██ hours, one of the instances will appear to lay 1 to ██ plastic eggs, roughly half the size of the original instances. These eggs will then "incubate" for roughly 24 hours, which then will hatch into 
smaller SCP-4118-1 instances, that then grow for a time period between 3 and 5 weeks, depending on the size of the egg. The adult stage of these new instances is between the sizes of its parents. These new instances do not imprint with nearby personnel, as they appear to automatically imprint on their parents. No factors have been determined to influence or induce reproduction, including temperature, time of year, time of day, size differential of instances, coloration of instances, and other varying factors.

**Log Of SCP-4118-1 Variants**
||~ Variants ||~ Species ||~ Population ||~ Behavior||
||Variant-01 || //Brachiosaurus altithorax//|| 7 || Herbivorous instances located in the forest biome that only travel with their mate, whom they apparently bond with permanently. Grazes on tall grasses and trees, and is very rarely attacked by carnivorous instances.||
||Variant-02 || //Postosuchus kirkpatricki// || 3 ||Instances are very solitary, living in the swamp biome of the containment chamber. They seem to be ambush predators, waiting underwater for other instances to wander near to V-02's environment, wherein it will strike using its superior speed and jaw-strength. V-02's bite strength is noted to be strong enough to cause severe pain in personnel that it bites. No attempts to induce reproduction between instances have worked. ||
||Variant-03 ||//Triceratops horridius// || 23 ||Herbivorous herd animal, moves in a group of 7 or 8 at one time. If attacked by predators, the instances will surround their offspring, using their horns and frills to threaten away predators. Utahraptors employ a "snatch-and-grab" technique with the young instances, trying to drag the target away before the adult instances take notice. ||
||Variant-04 || //Mosasaur hoffmanni//|| 5 ||Aquatic carnivorous instances, formed a pod that slowly swims around the pool, hunting coelacanth and occasionally Ichthyosaurs. Have been observed to make vocalizations similar to whale-song, when audio equipment was placed underwater. The purpose of this vocalization is unknown. ||
||Variant-05 || //Utahraptor ostrommaysorum// || 18 || Nocturnal carnivorous instances, and is markedly more intelligent than other variants, and is even able to be trained to perform tricks in exchange for pieces of plastic to consume. Travels in two packs of equal size, that appear to compete for resources. These two packs have been observed to attack one another, using varying tactics, like ambushes in the forest, or pitched battle in the savanna biome.||
||Variant-06 || //Ichthyosaur// || 15 || Aquatic carnivorous instances, after containment and breeding, a pod of V-06 was established, and is known to harass the Mosasaur pod that was established. For reference, the adult Mosasaurs are each .71 meters long, compared to the Ichthyosaurs, who were all around 10 centimeters in length. Instances mainly consumes coelacanths.||
||Variant-07 || //Latimeria chalumnae// || ~70 || Colloquially known as coelacanths, these are aquatic herbivorous instances, as opposed to their real-life counterpart, which is carnivorous. They are the smallest instances produced, as their maximum size is 2 centimeters. It is difficult to judge the population of V-08, as their size makes them hard to spot in the waters, even with sensors. Their relatively fast reproduction cycle, coupled with their size, makes them the basis of the aquatic food chain.||
|| Variant-08 || //Pteranodon longiceps// || 15 || Avian Pescatarian instances, use flight to plunge-dive and catch coelacanths. Have been known to be eaten by V-04, when trying to fly out of the water. Produces vocalizations not unsimilar to seagulls. Create nests out of grass and other plants on the perches on the wall.||
||Variant-09 || //Homo sapiens// || 1 || Instance immediately attempted to communicate with researchers after creation. Instance detained for questioning. After introduction to containment, the instance appears to enjoy living in the forest biome, observed creating tools out of plants and parts of SCP-4118-1 instances.||
||Variant-10 || //Megatherium americanum//|| 8 || Giant Ground Sloth, a herbivorous variant, dwells on the border between the forest and savanna biomes. One of the few  variants produced that is originally from the Cenezoic Era, is a very hardy variant, that uses its large claws to slash predators and retrieve food from the tops of tall plants. It is slow moving compared to other variants, but difficult to take down.||
||Variant-11 || //Giganotosaurus carolinii//|| 2 || The third-largest variant in containment, at 0.48 meters long, is the only carnivore to consistently use V-01 as a main food source. Lives in the forest biome, although it is difficult for it to maneuver in the biome. Only one mating pair in containment, has successfully produced an egg.||

> **Test Log**
> **Acting Researcher**: Dr. Jonas
> **Test In Question**: Whether or not SCP-4118 can be provoked into releasing specific SCP-4118 instances.
> 
> **Test 1A**: Dr. Jonas attempts to verbally trigger a response by saying the following: “I want to receive my favorite dinosaur.”
> 
> **Results**: Instance resembles the genus Pteranodon. Instance then begins to fly around the room.
> 
> **Notes**: Dr. Jonas claims his favorite dinosaur is Allosaurus.

> **Test 2A**: Dr. Jonas attempts to trigger a response by thinking of an Allosaurus.
> 
> **Results**: Instance is an unknown species of prehistoric reptile with large scythe-like claws.
> 
> **Notes**: Dr. Jonas requested permission to name this creature. Request denied on the basis of “You didn’t find the bones, you just got lucky messing with a toy”.

> **Test 3A**: Dr. Jonas attempts to trigger a response by “playing” with several non anomalous plastic dinosaurs and exclaiming “I sure need an Allosaurus to play with”.
> 
> **Results**: SCP-4118 automatically activated and produced a SCP-4118-1 instance. Instance perfectly matches modern representations of Allosaurus fragilis.

> **Test 4A**: Previous test repeated to account for possible coincidence.
> 
> **Results**: Same as previous test.
> 
> **Conclusion**: It has been concluded by Dr. Jonas and several reviewers that it is most likely SCP-4118 instances are spawned randomly outside of any “playtime” and can only be requested when “needed”.
  
 
> **Acting Researcher**: Dr. Jonas
> **Test In Question**: Testing the limits of SCP-4118’s ability to manifest SCP-4118-1 instances resembling other SCPs.
> 
> **Test 1B**: Dr. Jonas plays out a containment breach with crude figures representing a D-Class and a researcher. Dr. Jonas verbally requests a "[[[SCP-966|Sleep Predator]]]."
> 
> **Results**: Instance resembles a member of the genus Therizinosaurus.

> **Test 2B**: Dr. Jonas plays out a containment breach with crude figures representing a D-Class and a researcher. Dr. Jonas verbally requests an “Owl man”.
> 
> **Results**: An instance resembling a a 5 centimeter high wall with a recreation of [[[SCP-1155|SCP-1155]]]. Of note is that instead of having SCP-1155’s normal effects, the instance seemingly “pretended” to have these effects, turning into a physical version of SCP-1155 when the figures were turned away from the instance.
> 
> **Notes**: Instance has been stored in storage unit 67A5. SCP-4118 may prove extremely useful in learning more about SCPs that are difficult to observe, presuming it is accurate. This also implies that SCP-1155 has been around for millennia, presumably on cave or cliff walls. I would hate to see that cave art                        -Dr. Jonas


> **Test 2C**: Dr. Jonas plays out a containment breach with crude figures representing a D-Class and a researcher. Dr. Jonas verbally requests a “pretend cognitohazard”.
> 
> **Results**: An unrecognizable entity that Dr. Jonas reports as “Giving him a major headache”. The SCP-4118-1 instance was terminated by faculty. Study into whether this instance represents an uncontained SCP is ongoing.

> **Test 2D**: Dr. Jonas plays out a containment breach with crude figures representing a D-Class and a researcher. Dr. Jonas verbally requests “A monster”.
> 
> **Results**: [REDACTED]
> 
> **Notes**: Testing of SCP-4118-1 production is on hold indefinitely.



> **Test Log**
> **Acting Researcher**: Researcher H.
> **Test In Question**: To determine the intelligence of SCP-4118-1 instances.
> 
> **Test**: Researcher H. performs a basic Well’s Sapience Test.
> 
> **Results**: All instances with the exception of those in Variants-05 and -09 demonstrate no sapience or self awareness. The carnivorous instances seem to be more intelligent than the herbivorous instances, as they are able to coordinate and hunt as packs. Variant-05 displays basic sapience, and is able to recognize itself in a mirror, and also able to solve complex puzzles, with a success rate and solve time near to a crow's. Variant-09 displays traits of complex sapience and tool-making, and is overall compliant with Foundation demands. However it is reluctant to interact with Foundation personnel.
> 
> **Notes**: Further testing with Variant-05 and -06 are scheduled. Testing on other instances has been put on hold so as to focus on these instances.

[[collapsible show="+ Interview of Variant-09" hide="- hide this content"]]

> **Interviewed:** SCP-4118-1 Variant-09 (Shortened to V-09 for brevity).
> 
> **Interviewer:** Researcher H.
> 
> **Foreword:** Researcher H. will attempt communication with I-06 in order to learn any information about SCP-4118. V-09 appeared to have basic writing skills, and understands personnel when talked to, but is unable to communicate in any verbal language known to the Foundation.
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Researcher H.:** Hello V-09. Can you understand me?
> 
> V-09 nods its head
>  
> **Researcher H.:** Is there any way you might be able to communicate back to me?
> 
> V-09 motions to its throat and shakes its head, then makes a gesture resembling a pencil on paper
> 
> **Researcher H.:** I see. I will get us something for you to write with.
> 
> To account for the size of V-06 and how difficult a pencil would be for it to use, a bottle of ink, a toothpick, and a piece of standard printer paper is provided.
> 
> **Researcher H.:** Alright, let’s begin. Do you know why you are a toy?
> 
> **V-09:** this is not me. smaller than me. strange skin.
> 
> **Researcher H.:** Do you mean to tell me you were once in another form?
> 
> **V-09:** yes. before you. before much. world was very different. world was like us, world full of monsters.
> 
> **Researcher H.:** And what happened before you found yourself in this form?
> 
> **V-09:** running. all of us were running. from large destroyer. destroyer was going to cause end of world. not sure of word.
> 
> **Researcher H.:** So you were running from something destroying everything, and then you found yourself here? How do you think you found yourself in this form and in this time?
> 
> **V-09:** not sure. last thing remember is asking [[[A Fancy Dinosaur|winged one]]] to save me. scars are missing, this is not my body. This is a- (I-06 appears to struggle for a word)- a golem.
> 
> 
> **Researcher H.:** One last question. Was this "Destroyer" a small light in the sky, that grew larger over time until it covered the sky?
> 
> **V-09**: yes. how did you know?
> 
> **Researcher H.:** I think I understand. Thank you for your cooperation I-06, it has been an enormous help.
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** It is unclear what exactly V-09 means by many of its statements, however it is assumed that one of two scenarios happened. Either this “Destroyer” destroyed V-09 yet its consciousness survived, and was then captured by the "winged one" and put into a SCP-4118-1 instance, or V-09 is simply a copy of that consciousness imprinted upon a SCP-4118-1 instance. Whichever scenario it is, it is likely this is true for all SCP-4118-1 instances.

 **Recovery Log:** SCP-4118 was recovered from a family owned convenience store in which the owners had been selling SCP-4118-1. The anomaly was discovered by undercover agents of MTF Kappa-7 "Fun Police" making a routine sweep of the county's convenience and toy stores. SCP-4118 was recovered from the location and amnestics were administered as necessary . A disinformation campaign framing SCP-4118-1 instances as prototypes of an upcoming toy line was deployed and was successful.


**Addendum 4118-A:** On 1/7/1998, an unknown organization bearing the name “ARC” with an unidentified insignia breached Site K-40 and succeeded in stealing multiple anomalies, including SCP-4118. No staff on site were injured or otherwise harmed during the event. Samples taken from blood stains found on site indicate that at least one of the intruders was injured during the raid. Testing of the blood samples has yielded no matches within the foundation's database.`

Investigation into this group and possible motives for the raid are underway. Motives behind the abduction of SCP-4118 is unclear, but the two most popular theories are either that SCP-4118 has an unknown secondary function, or that it was simply an easy SCP to acquire due to its low security and ease of transport. All of the SCP-4118-1 instances were left behind, bringing into question whether or not the organization knew that SCP-4118 was responsible for creating them. 

Retrieval of SCP-4118 is considered low priority.


**Addendum 4118-B:** Further testing and breeding of SCP-4118-1 instances is authorized, to maintain the current population of instances at a steady level. All variants that did not have a breeding pair were hunted by carnivorous instances, even the SCP replicas. As such, only eleven variants remain to support a healthy ecosystem.

**Note:** //Whoever keeps putting up a sign over the SCP-4118 containment cell that reads "The Plastic Jurassic Park," needs to stop, or else they will be disciplined and receive a pay cut from me personally//         -Dr. Jonas
