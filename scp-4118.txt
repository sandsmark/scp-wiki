**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-4118 is kept in a standard storage unit in Site K-40. All SCP-4118-1 instances are to be kept in an adjacent unit, and new instances are only to be created for testing and must be recorded.-- 
SCP-4118 is currently uncontained, for details see Addendum 4118-B.

**Description:** SCP-4118 is a plastic tube resembling those used to sell plastic toy animals.It is clear however a label on the interior blocks view of the inside. The label displays an unknown carnivorous dinosaur and several sauropods, with bright letters that read: “Dr. Wondertainment’s Terrible Lizards!”. Opposite this text is another block of text that says: “Have you ever wanted your very own pet dinosaur? Well now with the newest invention from the minds of Dr. Wondertainment, you can! Simply shake the patented Time Tube and you can have your own tiny tyrant!”

When opened, the tube appears to have a mirror covering the opening, however when shaken onto a surface, a SCP-4118-1 instance will be manifested.

SCP-4118-1 instances are small animate toys, made of plastic and resembling various prehistoric creatures, most commonly reptiles.

**Addendum 4118-B**: Upon the discovery that SCP-4118 is capable of spawning other SCPs, experiments have been cleared to test the extent of its abilities.

> **Test Log**
> **Acting Researcher**: Dr. Jonas
> **Test In Question**: Whether or not SCP-4118 can be provoked into releasing specific SCP-4118 instances.
> 
> **Test 1A**: Dr. Jonas attempts to verbally trigger a response by saying the following: “I want to receive my favorite dinosaur.”
> 
> **Results**: Instance resembles the genus Pteranodon. Instance attempts to fly but due to its composition is unable
> 
> **Notes**: Dr. Jonas claims his favorite dinosaur is Allosaurus.
> 
> 
> **Test 2A**: Dr. Jonas attempts to trigger a response by thinking of an Allosaurus.
> 
> **Results**: Instance is an unknown species of prehistoric reptile with large scythe-like claws.
> 
> **Notes**: Dr. Jonas requested permission to name this creature. Request denied on the basis of “You didn’t find the bones, you just got lucky messing with a toy”.
> 
> 
> **Test 3A**: Dr. Jonas attempts to trigger a response by “playing” with several non anomalous plastic dinosaurs and exclaiming “I sure need an Allosaurus to play with”.
> 
> **Results**: Instance perfectly matches modern representations of Allosaurus fragilis.
> 
> 
> **Test 4A**: Previous test repeated to account for possible coincidence.
> 
> **Results**: Same as previous test.
> 
> **Conclusion** It has been concluded by Dr. Jonas and several reviewers that it is most likely SCP-4118 instances are spawned randomly outside of any “playtime” and can only be requested when “needed”.
> 
> 
> 
> **Acting Researcher**: Dr. Jonas
> **Test In Question**: Testing the limits of SCP-4118’s ability to manifest SCP-4118-1 instances resembling other SCPs.
> 
> **Test 2A**: Dr. Jonas plays out a containment breach with crude figures representing a D-Class and a researcher. Dr. Jonas verbally requests a “Moving statue”.
> 
> **Results**: Instance resembles a member of the genus *Coelophysis*.
> 
> **Notes**: It is theorized with SCP-4118’s exclusivity to ancient creatures that it is unable to manifest SCP-173 or SCP-650 as they were created outside the time range it can access.
> 
> 
> **Test 2B**: Dr. Jonas plays out a containment breach with crude figures representing a D-Class and a researcher. Dr. Jonas verbally requests an “Owl man”.
> 
> **Results**: An instance resembling a wall with a scribble of [[[SCP-1155|SCP-1155]]]. Of note is that instead of having SCP-1155’s normal effects, the instance seemingly “pretended” to have these effects, turning into a physical version of SCP-1155 when the figures were turned away from the instance.
> 
> **Notes**: Instance has been stored in storage unit 67A5. SCP-4118 may rove extremely useful in learning more about SCPs that are difficult to observe, presuming it is accurate.
> 
> 
> **Test 2C**: Dr. Jonas plays out a containments breach with crude figures representing a D-Class and a researcher. Dr. Jonas verbally requests a “pretend cognitohazard”.
> 
> **Results**: An unrecognizable entity that Dr. Jonas reports as “Giving me a major headache”. Study into whether this instance represents an uncontained SCP is ongoing.
> 
> 
> **Test 2D**: Dr. Jonas plays out a containment breach with crude figures representing a D-Class and a researcher. Dr. Jonas verbally requests “Something the researcher can’t comprehend.
> 
> **Results**: SCP-4118 produces a handwritten note reading “This is for children, you know that right?”.
> 
> 
> **Test 2E**: Dr. Jonas plays out a containment breach with crude figures representing a D-Class and a researcher. Dr. Jonas verbally requests “A monster”
> 
> **Results**: (REDACTED)
> 
> **Notes**: Testing of SCP-4118 is on hold indefinitely .




**Recovery Log**: SCP-4118 was recovered from a family owned convenience store in which the owners had been selling SCP-4118-1. The anomaly was discovered by undercover agents making a routine sweep of the county. SCP-4118 was recovered from the location and amnestics were administered as necessary . A disinformation campaign framing SCP-4118-1 instances as prototypes of an upcoming toy line was deployed and was successful.





**Addendum 4118-B:** On 1/7/1998, an unknown organization bearing the name “ARC” with an unidentifiable insignia invaded Site K-40 and succeeded in stealing multiple anomalies, including SCP-4118. No staff were harmed in the encounter however blood marks indicate at least one of the intruders were injured. Testing of the blood samples has found no matches in the foundations database.
