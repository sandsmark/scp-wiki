**Item #:** SCP-4118

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4118 is kept in a standard storage unit in Site K-40. All SCP-4118-1 instances are to be kept in an adjacent unit. Interaction with SCP-4118 instances is permitted. SCP-4118-2 are allowed to visit their imprinted instances, but are to maintain their daily routines, and not stay past their permitted time allocation.

A custom containment cell has been constructed for the SCP-4118-1 population, with different environments and terrain accommodating the different species of SCP-4118-1. Specific plant species have been established in different areas of the cell, to be watered regularly (Details within //"Killer Vines and Me: Foundation Guide to Plant-care, both Anomalous and Benign"//). The lights in the containment cell are to be placed on a 24-hour day-night cycle. Interaction with SCP-4118 instances is permitted, but no personnel is allowed to stay in the containment cell beyond the times outlined in the visiting schedule. Personnel are not allowed to pick up SCP-4118-1, or instigate fights between instances. The schedule can be found in the cafeteria on the notice board. 

Current population of SCP-4118-1 is to be maintained, with reproduction encouraged if necessary. If population growth exceeds constraints of cell personnel are permitted to dispose of newer instances. All cases of improper disposal of instances will be reported to Site Director. All exotic or unique 4118-1 instances are to be kept in hibernation in a secure Safe-rated storage locker in the observation room adjacent to SCP-4118-1's habitat.

MTF Kappa-7 "Fun Police" is to monitor the county that SCP-4118 was found in for more anomalous activity, and intercept any instances that may be sold on the market. The [[[SCP-4110|Romagnoli-Bitler Wondertainment Suppression Protocol]]] is to be used to track down any additional SCP-4118 or SCP-4118-1 being sold online.

**Description:** SCP-4118 is a opaque plastic tube resembling those commonly used for the packaging of plastic toy animals. The label displays an acrylic scene of a group of three theropods eating while a sauropod watches in the background. On the opposing side of the tube is a logo that reads: “Dr. Wondertainment’s Tube O' Dinos!” in bright block-lettering. Underneath the logo is a paragraph of text that reads: 

> Have you ever wanted to peer behind the veil of the past to see things time has buried?  Have you ever wanted to discover things those grumpy paleontologists have yet to uncover? Well the newest invention straight from the genius mind of Dr. Wondertainment, does just that, with our new product, the Educational **Tube O' Dinos®**! Simply shake the patented **Time Tube®** and you can have your very own tiny tyrants, and recreate a prehistoric landscape in your very own house! Learn the Behaviors of the behemoths of a forgotten era! Witness the ancient rivalries of Reptiles and Mammals once again take center stage! Become a scientist, finding new and Interesting creatures that are stranger than fiction, only with our **Tube O' Dinos®**!

When opened, the tube appears to have a reflective surface covering the opening, preventing personnel from viewing the inside of the tube. This mirror is extremely resistant to any form of damage. When SCP-4118 is shaken mirror-side down onto a surface, a SCP-4118-1 instance will appear to exit the mirror.

SCP-4118-1 instances are small animate toys, made of a hard plastic similar to polyvinyl chloride (PVC)/thermoplastic elastomers (TPE)/crylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and resemble various prehistoric creatures, most commonly creatures from the Mesozoic Era, although instances from earlier periods have been created. Instances resembling animals from the Cenozoic Era have also been observed to be produced, but at a significantly lower rate than instances found in earlier periods. --No humanoid instances have been produced thus far.-- Instances have been recorded to be various sizes, ranging from 3 centimeters tall to  60 centimeters tall, and are capable of of consuming food.Instances are not required to eat, as the instances can live without sustenance for an indefinite period of time in a form of stasis. 

Herbivorous instances, such as sauropods and ceratopsians, consume primarily plant matter. Carnivorous and pescatarian entities, such as therapods and pliosaurs, appear to digest any plastic they consume[[footnote]]As such, no cross-testing with [[[SCP-387|other sentient plastic anomalies]]] is to be conducted at this time[[/footnote]][[footnote]]This ability extends to all objects colloquially called "plastics" including, but not limited to, Acetal, Acrylic, CE Canvas Phenlonic, and some types of plastic explosives.[[/footnote]], although no excrement of the instance is noted.

Instances have been noted to be faster or more agile than previously assumed of their respective species, but it has been theorized that it is only due to their size and/or composition. SCP-4118-1 instances appear to gravitate towards biomes that appeal to their physiology (Brachiosaurus dwelling in forests, Triceratops living in savanna-like conditions). The majority of instances go into a form of hibernation if there is low light conditions in their environment. However, certain carnivorous instances seem to be more active during this time. Instances can be awakened from their stasis by stimuli, and have been noted to respond to the vocalizations of their young when attacked by carnivorous instances during their period of hibernation.

When an instance is created from SCP-4118, the first human being SCP-4118-1 sees within a 10-second time frame will be  imprinted upon (subject then designated SCP-4118-2). Imprint seems to be permanent, as SCP-4118-1 instances have recognized and responded to SCP-4118-2 at least 4 years after last contact. Instances are shown to have a marked decrease in aggression when near SCP-4118-2, to the point of docility, and remains docile even when people other than SCP-4118-2 are near it. If SCP-4118-2 exits line of sight for more than 10 seconds, SCP-4118-1 instances default back to their original behavior pattern.

SCP-4118-1 do not appear to age, but can be terminated if their head is severed from their neck, or more than 30% of their body mass is not present. No regrowth of injured tissue has been observed.

SCP-4118-1  reproduce when two instances of the same species are in close proximity for on average 47 consecutive days. One of the instances will appear to generate 1 to 40 plastic eggs, which after a period of 24 hours will hatch into smaller SCP-4118-1 instances. These new instances will grow for a time period between 2 days and 5 weeks. These new instances appear to automatically imprint on their parents. The time required for reproduction and the amount of offspring produced varies between species. No factors have been determined to influence or induce reproduction. Outside of interference by staff, there are no natural ways of culling the population of carnivores within the ecology of SCP-4118, as resources are not necessary for reproduction, and carnivore-carnivore predation is rare, outside of specific cases of cannibalism.

**Log Of SCP-4118-1 Variants**
||~ Variants ||~ Species ||~ Population ||~ Behavior||
||Variant-01 || //Brachiosaurus altithorax//|| 7 || Herbivorous instances located in the forest biome are sexually and socially monogamous, travelling and breeding only with one other instance. Grazes on tall grasses and trees, and is very rarely attacked by carnivorous instances. Young travel with parents until maturity, at which point they will leave to find a mate.||
||Variant-02 || //Postosuchus kirkpatricki// || 3 ||Analogous to modern-day crocodiles. Instances are very solitary, living in the swamp biome of the containment chamber. They seem to be ambush predators, waiting subermerged underwater for other instances to approach to drink, wherein it will strike using its superior speed and jaw-strength. V-02 often barrel rolls small instances to kill, but with larger instances usually will tear flesh from limbs. V-02's bite strength is noted to be strong enough to cause severe pain in personnel that it bites. No attempts to induce reproduction between instances have worked. ||
||Variant-03 ||//Triceratops horridius// || 23 ||Herbivorous herd animal, moves in a group of 7 or 8 at one time. If attacked by predators, the instances will surround their offspring, using their horns and frills to intimidate predators. V-05 employ a "snatch-and-grab" technique with the young instances, trying to drag the target away before the adult instances take notice. ||
||Variant-04 || //Mosasaurus hoffmanni//|| 5 ||Aquatic pescatarian instances, formed a pod that slowly swims around the pool, hunting coelacanth and occasionally Ichthyosaurs. Have been observed to make vocalizations similar to whales. The purpose of these vocalizations is unknown. ||
||Variant-05 || //Utahraptor ostrommaysorum// || 18 || Primarily nocturnal feathered carnivorous instances, markedly more intelligent than other variants. Travels in two packs of equal size that appear to compete for resources. These two packs have been observed to attack one another using varying tactics, such as ambushes in the forest, or pitched battle in the prairie biome. Altruistic among pack-members, the weakest and youngest have priority during feeding. Preening and grooming as a form of social interaction has been observed.||
||Variant-06 || //Ichthyosaur// || 15 || Aquatic pescatarian instances, a pod of V-06 is known to harass the //Mosasaurus// pod. For reference, the adult Mosasaurs are each ~70 centimeters long, compared to the Ichthyosaurs, who were all around 10 centimeters in length. Instances mainly consumes coelacanths. Instances appear to have the ||
||Variant-07 || //Latimeria chalumnae// || ~70 || Colloquially known as coelacanths, these are aquatic herbivorous instances, as opposed to their real-life counterparts, which are carnivorous. They are the smallest instances produced, as their maximum size is 2 centimeters. It is difficult to judge the population of V-08, as their size makes them hard to spot in the waters, even with sensors. They are the primary food source within the aquatic ecosystem, which is maintained via a fast reproduction cycle.||
|| Variant-08 || //Pteranodon longiceps// || 15 || Avian pescatarian instances, use flight to plunge-dive and catch V-07. Has been known to be consumed by V-04 when flying near or out of the water. Produces vocalizations not unsimilar to seagulls. Create nests out of woven plant material on the wall perches.||
||[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/tedtalk| Variant-09]]] || //Homo sapiens// || 1 || Instance immediately attempted to communicate with researchers after creation. Instance detained for questioning. After introduction to containment, the instance lives in the forest biome, observed creating primitive tools out of plants and parts of SCP-4118-1 instances. Raids food caches of V-11 if necessary.||
||Variant-10 || //Megatherium americanum//|| 8 || A herbivorous Giant Ground Sloth, dwells on the border between the forest and plains biomes. One of the few variants produced that is originally from the Cenezoic Era. Uses its large claws to fend off predators and retrieve food from the tops of tall plants. It is slow moving compared to other variants of its size, but is rarely harassed by carnivores.||
||Variant-11 || //Giganotosaurus carolinii//|| 2 || The third-largest variant in containment, at 0.48 meters long, is the only carnivore to consistently use V-01 as a main food source. Lives in the forest biome, although due to their length it is difficult for them to maneuver in their environment. Only one mating pair in containment, has successfully produced an egg. Maintains caches around its territory to store excess food. As material from 4118-1 instances does not decompose, some of these caches can be stored for years until needed. ||

[[collapsible show="+ Test Log" hide="- hide this content"]]

> **Test Log**
> **Acting Researcher**: Dr. Jonas
> **Test In Question**: Whether or not SCP-4118 can be provoked into releasing specific SCP-4118 instances.

> **Test 1A**: Dr. Jonas attempts to verbally trigger a response by saying “I want to play with my favorite dinosaur.”
> 
> **Results**: Instance resembles the genus Pteranodon. Instance then begins to fly around the room.
> 
> **Notes**: Dr. Jonas claims his favorite dinosaur is Allosaurus.

> **Test 2A**: Dr. Jonas attempts to trigger a response by thinking of an Allosaurus.
> 
> **Results**: Instance is an unknown species of prehistoric reptile with large scythe-like claws.
> 
> **Notes**: Dr. Jonas requested permission to name the new species. Request denied on the basis of “Doesn't count, its a toy, not bones.”.

> **Test 3A**: Dr. Jonas attempts to trigger a response by “playing” with several non anomalous plastic dinosaurs and exclaiming “I would love to have an Allosaurus to play with”.
> 
> **Results**: SCP-4118 automatically activated and produced a SCP-4118-1 instance. Instance perfectly matches modern representations of Allosaurus fragilis.

> **Test 4A**: Previous test repeated to account for possible coincidence.
> 
> **Results**: Same as previous test.
> 
> **Conclusion**: It has been concluded by Dr. Jonas and several reviewers that it is most likely SCP-4118 instances are spawned randomly outside of any “playtime” and can only be requested when “needed”.
  
 
> **Test Log**
> **Acting Researcher**: Researcher H.
> **Test In Question**: To determine the intelligence of SCP-4118-1 instances.
> 
> **Test**: Researcher H. performs a basic Well’s Sapience Test.
> 
> **Results**: All instances with the exception of those in Variants-05 and -09 demonstrate no sapience or self awareness. The carnivorous instances seem to be more intelligent than the herbivorous instances, as they are able to coordinate and hunt as packs. Variant-05 displays basic sapience, and is able to recognize itself in a mirror, and also able to solve complex puzzles, with a success rate and solve time near to a crow's. Variant-09 displays traits of complex sapience and tool-making, and is overall compliant with Foundation demands. However it is reluctant to interact with Foundation personnel.
> 
> **Notes**: Further testing with Variant-05 and -09 are scheduled. Testing on other instances has been put on hold so as to focus on these instances.

[[collapsible show="+ Interview of Variant-09" hide="- hide this content"]]

> **Interviewed:** SCP-4118-1 Variant-09 (Shortened to V-09 for brevity).
> 
> **Interviewer:** Researcher H.
> 
> **Foreword:** Researcher H. will attempt communication with I-06 in order to learn any information about SCP-4118. V-09 appeared to have basic writing skills, and understands personnel when talked to, but is unable to communicate in any verbal language known to the Foundation.
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Researcher H.:** Hello V-09. Can you understand me?
> 
> V-09 nods its head
>  
> **Researcher H.:** Is there any way you might be able to communicate back to me?
> 
> V-09 motions to its throat and shakes its head, then makes a gesture resembling a pencil on paper
> 
> **Researcher H.:** I see. I will get us something for you to write with.
> 
> To account for the size of V-09 and how difficult a pencil would be for it to use, a bottle of ink, a toothpick, and a piece of standard printer paper is provided.
> 
> **Researcher H.:** Alright, let’s begin. Do you know why you are a toy?
> 
> **V-09:** this is not me. smaller than me. strange hard skin.
> 
> **Researcher H.:** Do you mean to tell me you were once in another form?
> 
> **V-09:** yes. before you. before much. world was very different. world was like us, world full of monsters. hairy beasts with spears and daggers for teeth.
> 
> **Researcher H.:** And what happened before you found yourself in this form?
> 
> **V-09:** running. all of us were running. mountain angry, red hot tears flowed from top, killing everything.
> 
> **Researcher H.:** So you were running from something destroying everything, and then you found yourself here? How do you think you found yourself in this form and in this time?
> 
> **V-09:** not sure. last thing remember is asking shaman to save me. scars are missing, this is not my body. This is a- (I-06 appears to struggle for a word)- a golem.
> 
> **Researcher H.:** I think I understand. Thank you for your cooperation V-09, it has been an enormous help.
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** It is unclear what exactly V-09 means by many of its statements, however it is assumed that one of two scenarios happened. Either the volcano erupted near his tribe and destroyed V-09's original body with its consciousness surviving, or V-09 is simply a living toy that was given fake memories. Whichever scenario it is, it is possible this is true for all sentient or near-sentient SCP-4118-1 instances.

 **Recovery Log:** SCP-4118 was recovered from a family owned convenience store in which the owners had been selling SCP-4118-1. The anomaly was discovered by undercover agents of MTF Kappa-7 "Fun Police" making a routine sweep of the county's convenience and toy stores. SCP-4118 was recovered from the location and amnestics were administered as necessary . A disinformation campaign framing SCP-4118-1 instances as prototypes of an upcoming toy line was deployed and was successful.


**Addendum 4118-A:** On 1/7/1998, a cell of the Serpent's Hand breached Site K-40 and succeeded in stealing multiple anomalies, including SCP-4118. Minor injuries were incurred on both sides, no casualties. 

Investigation possible motives for the raid are underway. Motives behind the abduction of SCP-4118 is unclear, but the two most popular theories are either that SCP-4118 has an unknown secondary function, or that it was simply an easy SCP to acquire due to its low security and ease of transport. All of the SCP-4118-1 instances were left behind, bringing into question whether or not the organization knew that SCP-4118 was responsible for creating them. Retrieval of SCP-4118 is considered low priority.

**Addendum 4118-B:** On 1/15/1998, fifteen instances of V-05 and V-08 were recorded missing from the containment cell. Video doesn't show the instances leaving the cell, nor did the research staff inadvertently carry them outside of the cell. None of the instances could be found within the site, and the rest of the instances in containment were placed in temporary hibernation. On 1/27/1998, security observed the 4118-1 instances approaching the front gate of Site-K20, along with SCP-4118 and atop an instance resembling a member of //Quetzalcoatlus northropi//. It is unknown how or where the instances reacquired SCP-4118. Instances were recontained and SCP-4118 was placed into storage.
