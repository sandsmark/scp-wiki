**Recovery Log**: SCP-4118 was recovered from a family-owned convenience store in which the owners had been selling SCP-4118-1. The anomaly was discovered by undercover agents making a routine sweep of the county. SCP-4118 was recovered from the location and amnestics were administered as necessary. A disinformation campaign framing SCP-4118-1 instances as prototypes of an upcoming toy line was deployed and was successful.





**Addendum 4118-A:** On 1/7/1998, an unknown organization bearing the name “ARC” with an unidentifiable insignia invaded Site K-40 and succeeded in stealing multiple anomalies, including SCP-4118. No staff were harmed in the encounter however blood marks indicate at least one of the intruders were injured. Testing of the blood samples has found no matches in the foundation's database.
