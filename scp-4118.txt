**Item #:** SCP-4118

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-4118 is kept in a standard storage unit in Site K-40. All SCP-4118-1 instances are to be kept in an adjacent unit, and new instances are only to be created for testing and must be recorded. It is not recommended for more than three carnivorous instances of the same species to be active at once. Interaction with SCP-4118 instances is permitted, but no fighting is to be encouraged among the carnivorous instances.-- 

SCP-4118 is currently uncontained and in the possession of an unknown GOI (for details see Addendum 4118-B).

**Description:** SCP-4118 is a clear plastic tube resembling those commonly used for the packaging of plastic toy animals. A label on the interior obscures the contents of the tube. The label displays an unknown carnivorous dinosaur and several sauropods, with bright letters that read: “Dr. Wondertainment’s Terrible Lizards!”. On the opposing side of the tube is a paragraph of text that reads: 

>“Have you ever wanted your very own pet dinosaur? With the newest invention from the mind of Dr. Wondertainment, you now can! Simply shake the patented **Time Tube®** and you can have your very own tiny tyrant, and recreate a prehistoric landscape in your very own house!”`
>

SCP-4118 seems to have a mild cognitohazardous effect which instills a childlike attitude in subjects within a 2 meter radius, although this is easily dispelled with any amount of willpower or shock. Those who intentionally do not dispel the effect describe it as similar to nostalgia. A much stronger secondary cognitohazard occurs when SCP-4118 is damaged in any way. All who have interacted with the object previously will feel hostility towards the person who damaged it, however this never escalates to violence. This often results in the person who damaged SCP-4118 feeling remorse or guilt over damaging SCP-4118, even if the reason was justified. Whether this is part of the cognitohazard is unclear.

When opened, the tube appears to have a mirror covering the opening. This mirror appears to be non-anomalous, but appears to be extremely resistant to any form of damage. When shaken upside-down onto a surface, a SCP-4118-1 instance will be manifested.

SCP-4118-1 instances are small animate toys, made of a hard plastic similar to polyvinyl chloride (PVC)/thermoplastic elastomers (TPE)/crylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and resemble various prehistoric creatures, most commonly creatures from the Mesozoic Era and earlier. Instances resembling animals from the Cenozoic Era are rarely produced. --No humanoid instances have been produced thus far.-- Instances come in various sizes, ranging from 3 centimeters tall to █ meters tall, and do not appear to need sustenance or have bodily functions. Instances have been noted to be faster or more agile than previously assumed of their respective species, but it has been theorized that it is only due to their size and/or composition.

When a carnivorous SCP-4418-1 instance comes into contact with a smaller and/or herbivorous instance, the former will try to attack the latter, with the second trying to defend itself. This behavior does not seem to be necessary, as the instances can live indefinitely without sustenance. Carnivorous instances have also been known to form a pack with similar members of its species, which then try to take down herbivorous, and even carnivorous instances larger than them.

> **Test Log**
> **Acting Researcher**: Dr. Jonas
> **Test In Question**: Whether or not SCP-4118 can be provoked into releasing specific SCP-4118 instances.
> 
> **Test 1A**: Dr. Jonas attempts to verbally trigger a response by saying the following: “I want to receive my favorite dinosaur.”
> 
> **Results**: Instance resembles the genus Pteranodon. Instance attempts to fly but due to its composition is unable
> 
> **Notes**: Dr. Jonas claims his favorite dinosaur is Allosaurus.

> **Test 2A**: Dr. Jonas attempts to trigger a response by thinking of an Allosaurus.
> 
> **Results**: Instance is an unknown species of prehistoric reptile with large scythe-like claws.
> 
> **Notes**: Dr. Jonas requested permission to name this creature. Request denied on the basis of “You didn’t find the bones, you just got lucky messing with a toy”.

> **Test 3A**: Dr. Jonas attempts to trigger a response by “playing” with several non anomalous plastic dinosaurs and exclaiming “I sure need an Allosaurus to play with”.
> 
> **Results**: Instance perfectly matches modern representations of Allosaurus fragilis.

> **Test 4A**: Previous test repeated to account for possible coincidence.
> 
> **Results**: Same as previous test.
> 
> **Conclusion**: It has been concluded by Dr. Jonas and several reviewers that it is most likely SCP-4118 instances are spawned randomly outside of any “playtime” and can only be requested when “needed”.
> 
> 
> 
> **Acting Researcher**: Dr. Jonas
> **Test In Question**: Testing the limits of SCP-4118’s ability to manifest SCP-4118-1 instances resembling other SCPs.
> 
> **Test 2A**: Dr. Jonas plays out a containment breach with crude figures representing a D-Class and a researcher. Dr. Jonas verbally requests a “Moving statue”.
> 
> **Results**: Instance resembles a member of the genus Coelophysus .
> 
> **Notes**: It is theorized with SCP-4118’s exclusivity to ancient creatures that it is unable to manifest SCP-173 or SCP-650 as they were created outside the time range it can access.

> **Test 2B**: Dr. Jonas plays out a containment breach with crude figures representing a D-Class and a researcher. Dr. Jonas verbally requests an “Owl man”.
> 
> **Results**: An instance resembling a wall with a scribble of [[[SCP-1155|SCP-1155]]]. Of note is that instead of having SCP-1155’s normal effects, the instance seemingly “pretended” to have these effects, turning into a physical version of SCP-1155 when the figures were turned away from the instance.
> 
> **Notes**: Instance has been stored in storage unit 67A5. SCP-4118 may prove extremely useful in learning more about SCPs that are difficult to observe, presuming it is accurate.

> **Test 2C**: Dr. Jonas plays out a containments breach with crude figures representing a D-Class and a researcher. Dr. Jonas verbally requests a “pretend cognitohazard”.
> 
> **Results**: An unrecognizable entity that Dr. Jonas reports as “Giving him a major headache”. The SCP-4118-1 instance was terminated by faculty. Study into whether this instance represents an uncontained SCP is ongoing.

> **Test 2D**: Dr. Jonas plays out a containment breach with crude figures representing a D-Class and a researcher. Dr. Jonas verbally requests “Something the researcher can’t comprehend.
> 
> **Results**: SCP-4118 produces a handwritten note reading “This is for children, you know that right?”.

> **Test 2E**: Dr. Jonas plays out a containment breach with crude figures representing a D-Class and a researcher. Dr. Jonas verbally requests “A monster”.
> 
> **Results**: [REDACTED]
> 
> **Notes**: Testing of SCP-4118 is on hold indefinitely.




**Recovery Log**: SCP-4118 was recovered from a family owned convenience store in which the owners had been selling SCP-4118-1. The anomaly was discovered by undercover agents making a routine sweep of the county. SCP-4118 was recovered from the location and amnestics were administered as necessary . A disinformation campaign framing SCP-4118-1 instances as prototypes of an upcoming toy line was deployed and was successful.


**Addendum 4118-A:** Upon the discovery that SCP-4118 is capable of spawning other SCPs, experiments have been cleared to test the extent of its abilities.


**Addendum 4118-B:** On 1/7/1998, an unknown organization bearing the name “ARC” with an unidentified insignia breached Site K-40 and succeeded in stealing multiple anomalies, including SCP-4118. No staff on site were injured or otherwise harmed during the event. Samples taken from blood stains found on site indicate that at least one of the intruders was injured during the raid. Testing of the blood samples has yielded no matches within the foundation's database.`

Investigation into this group and possible motives for the raid are underway. Motives behind the abduction of SCP-4118 is unclear, but the two most popular theories are either that SCP-4118 has an unknown secondary function, or that it was simply an easy SCP to acquire due to its low security and ease of transport. All of the SCP-4118-1 instances were left behind, bringing into question whether or not the organization knew that SCP-4118 was responsible for creating them. 

Retrieval of SCP-4118 is considered low priority.


**Addendum 4118-C:** Further testing of SCP-4118-1 instances is authorized, due to the much lower risks they pose, and the possibility of learning important information about SCP-4118.



> **Test Log**
> **Acting Researcher**: Researcher H.
> **Test In Question**: To determine the intelligence of SCP-4118-1 instances.
> 
> **Test 1A**: Researcher H. performs a basic Well’s Sapience Test.
> 
> **Results**: All instances with the exception of the instances from Test 2C and 2B demonstrate no sapience and intelligence not dissimilar to most animals. Instance-2B displays basic sapience, however is far too difficult to test to get accurate results. Instance-2C displays traits of sapience and is overall compliant however is reluctant to interact with foundation personnel, and can cause issue because of its tendency to cause migraines.
> 
> **Notes**: Further testing with Instance 2C and 2B are scheduled. Testing on other instances has been put on hold so as to focus on these instances.

> **Interviewed:** SCP-4118-1 Instance 2C (Shortened to I-2C for brevity).
> 
> **Interviewer:** Researcher H.
> 
> **Foreword:** Researcher H. will attempt communication with I-2C in order to learn any information about SCP-4118. Researcher H. was specifically chosen due to his resistance to cognitohazards in order to make communication easier.
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Researcher H.:** “Hello I-2C. Can you understand me?”
> 
> I-2C nods its head to signal yes
>  
> **Researcher H.:** “Is there any way you might be able to communicate back to me?”
> 
> I-2C motions to its throat and shakes its head, then makes a gesture resembling a pencil on paper
> 
> **Researcher H.:** “I see. I will get us something for you to write with”.
> 
> To account for the size of I-2C and how difficult a pencil would be for it to use, a bottle of ink, a toothpick, and a piece of standard printer paper is provided.
> 
> **Researcher H.:** “Alright, let’s begin. Do you know why you cause people headaches?”
> 
> **I-2C:** “Hard for you to understand. Not normally seen. Form compressed”.
> 
> **Researcher H.:** “Do you mean to tell me you were once in another form?”
> 
> **I-2C:** “Yes. Before you. Before much. World was very different. World was like us, world full of headache causers”.
> 
> **Researcher H.:** “And what happened before you found yourself in this form?”
> 
> **I-2C:** "Running. All of us were running. From large destroyer. Destroyer was going to cause end of bigger than world. Not sure of word”.
> 
> **Researcher H.:** “So you were running from something destroying everything, and then you found yourself here? How do you think you found yourself in this form and in this time”.
> 
> **I-2C:** “Not sure. Scars are missing, this is not my body. This is a- (I-2C appears to struggle for a word)- a golem”.
> 
> **Researcher H.:** “I think I understand. Thank you for your cooperation I-2C, it has been an enormous help”.
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** It is unclear what exactly I-2C means by many of its statements, however it is assumed that one of two scenarios happened. Either this “Destroyer” destroyed I-2C yet its consciousness survived, and was then captured and put into a SCP-4118-1 instance, or I-2C is simply a copy of that consciousness imprinted upon a SCP-4118-1 instance. Whichever scenario it is, it is likely this is true for all SCP-4118-1 instances.
