**Item #:** SCP-288

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-288 is to be kept in a locker, with only level-two security personnel and up to know the combination. They are currently contained in the small, velvet-lined black box they were retrieved in. Unauthorized personnel found wearing or taking SCP-288 are to be moved off the premises immediately, and given a mild disciplinary hearing. Personnel who have worn the rings during testing are to undergo full psych exams afterward, and their experiences recorded. No further precautions need to be taken for SCP-288. For all points and purposes, when not being worn, they are harmless.

**Description:** SCP-288 consists of an engagement ring and matching band, both silver in make, the ring containing a small diamond. They are relatively plain, and bear no marks as to their origin or make, but staff routinely describe them as seeming like "very nice wedding rings, if a little plain." They are completely normal in every sense, and have been dented by endurance testing (although a quick trip to a jewelers fixed them right up), and their effects are only observed while worn.

When the woman's ring from SCP-288 is worn by any adult female in a relationship, she immediately becomes what has been referred to as an "extreme housewife". Women describe this experience as if they are not in control of their body, merely observing. They appear to lose all ability to form their own opinions, and instead automatically agree with the opinions of their spouse, and show very few negative emotions, if any. They seem to gain an instinctive knowledge of cooking and baking, in the style of "traditional American" foods, such as apple pie or macaroni and cheese. These dishes are always perfectly made, and a similar knowledge occurs in the manner of cleaning and fixing things, displaying the ability to sew and knit even if they were not able to do these acts before donning SCP-288. With this knowledge, they feel the urge to cook, clean, and mend things around their home incessantly; lose the will to have a job of their own; and become exceedingly obedient and loyal to their spouse, as well as religious and authority figures. Many wearers of SCP-288 seem to have a fondness to rather modest dresses, and seem to be uncomfortable when wearing pants or more revealing clothing. They also exhibit a fondness for children, and if they do not already have children express the urge to have them.

When the man's wedding band from SCP-288 is worn by any adult male in a relationship, he undergoes a change to become what's been called the "all-American dad", whether or not he has children of his own. Men describe the experience similar to women, in that they feel they are not in control of their life. He shows loyalty and obedience to political, religious, and authority figures, as well as whoever his current boss is. He will work exceedingly long hours without complaint, and remains upbeat and motivated through his work. No matter his former personality, he becomes friendly and easy to approach, and becomes good with kids and fiercely loyal to his spouse, always willing to help around the house and willing to please with a shoulder rub. Men with children are seemingly perfect fathers to them, and men without children express a desire to have children strongly.

When used together, SCP-288 seems to recreate a "Stepford Marriage". While this seems ideal and relatively harmless, SCP-288 has been responsible for numerous crimes, including spousal abuse, murder, and suicide. Both women and men report feeling trapped while wearing SCP-288, and out of control of their own life. After extended periods of wearing SCP-288, they often have intense feelings of being used and depression, like they're not themselves. On a more sinister note, somebody wearing SCP-288 will take virtually any manner of abuse from a spouse without a word or raising a hand to defend themselves.

In transsexual/transgendered individuals, the ring appears to affect their 'mental' gender. Therefore, a male-to-female transsexual would react to the female ring, rather than the male ring, whether or they were pre- or post-op. Homosexual couples are affected by their respective gender of ring, but a male homosexual will not react to the female ring, just as a female homosexual will not react to the male ring. More testing upon sex and gender is pending.

The potential for SCP-288 to create a "domestic slave" proves disturbing to some, and seems useful to others, and records show that is has been utilized in such a fashion before. [See Addendum]

SCP-288 was discovered by Dr. Rights in [DATA EXPUNGED]. Thankfully, her boyfriend grew wary of her extreme mood changes and called the Emergency SCP Contact number she had left for him, delivering SCP-288 into the Foundation's hands.

"I'm just glad I got suckered into it before somebody else did...even if it was horrible."
-Dr. Rights

It should be noted that both rings of SCP-288 resist being separated, and wearers may feel compelled to buy or even steal the rings in order to keep them nearby.

**Addendum:** It has been revealed through extensive backtracking of SCP-288's path that it has caused five instances of homicide, three suicides, and two cases of spousal abuse. It has been a regular occurrence in pawn shops across the United States for reportedly eighty years and all attempts to track it past a certain point have failed to reveal any evidence.

It is unknown how SCP-288 works, as they display no physical anomalies relative to a normal wedding ring of similar type.
