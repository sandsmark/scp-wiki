**Item #:** SCP-288

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-288 is to be kept in a locker, with only level-two security personnel and up to know the combination. They are currently contained in the small, velvet-lined black box they were retrieved in. Unauthorized personnel found wearing or taking SCP-288 are to be moved off the premise immediately, and given a mild disciplinary hearing. Personnel who have worn the rings during testing are to undergo full psych exams afterward, and their experiences recorded. No further precautions need to be taken for SCP-288. For all points and purposes, when not being worn, they are harmless.

**Description:** SCP-288 consists of an engagement ring and matching band, both silver in make, the ring containing a small diamond. They are relatively plain, and bear no marks as to their origin or make, but staff routinely describe them as seeming like "very nice wedding rings, if a little plain." They are completely normal in every sense, and have been dented by endurance testing (although a quick trip to a jewelers fixed them right up), and their effects are only observed while worn.

When the woman's ring from SCP-288 is worn by any adult female in a relationship, she immediately becomes what has been referred to as an "extreme housewife". Women describe this experience as if they are not in control of their body, merely observing. They appear to lose all ability to form their own opinions, and instead automatically agree with the opinions of their spouse, and show very few negative emotions, if any. They seem to gain an instinctive knowledge of cooking and baking, in the style of "traditional American" foods, such as apple pie or macaroni and cheese. These dishes are always perfectly made, and a similar knowledge occurs in the manner of cleaning and fixing things, displaying the ability to sew and knit even if they were not able to do these acts before donning SCP-288. With this knowledge, they feel the urge to cook, clean, and mend things around their home incessantly, lose the will to have a job of their own, and become exceedingly obedient and loyal to their spouse, as well as religious and authority figures. Many wearers of SCP-288 seem to have a fondness to rather modest dresses, and seem to be uncomfortable when wearing pants or more revealing clothing. They also exhibit a fondness for children, and if they do not already have children express the urge to have them.

When the man's wedding band from SCP-288 is worn by any adult male in a relationship, he undergoes a change to become what's been called the "all-American dad", whether or not he has children of his own. Men describe the experience similar to Women, in that they feel they are not in control of their life. He shows loyalty and obedience to political, religious, and authority figures, as well as whomever his current boss is. He will work exceedingly long hours without complain, and remains upbeat and motivated through his work. No matter his former personality, he becomes friendly and easy to approach, and becomes good with kids and fiercely loyal to his spouse, always willing to help around the house and willing to please with a shoulder rub. Men with children are seemingly perfect fathers to them, and men without children express a desire to have children strongly.

When used together, SCP-288 seems to recreate a "Stepford Marriage". While this seems ideal and relatively harmless, SCP-288 has been responsible for numerous crimes, including spousal abuse, murder, and suicide. Both women and men report feeling trapped while wearing SCP-288, and out of control of their own life. After extended periods of wearing SCP-288, they often have intense feelings of being used and depression, like they're not themselves. On a more sinister note, somebody wearing SCP-288 will take virtually any manner of abuse from a spouse without a word or raising a hand to defend themselves.

In transsexual/transgendered individuals, the ring appears to affect their 'mental' gender. Therefore, a male-to-female transsexual would react to the female ring, rather than the male right, whether or they were pre-or-post-op. Homosexual couples are affected by their respective gender of ring, but a male homosexual will not react to the female ring, just as a female homosexual will not react to the male ring. More testing upon sex and gender is pending.

The potential for SCP-288 to create a "domestic slave" proves disturbing to some, and seem useful to others, and records show that is has been utilized in such a fashion before. [See Addendum]

SCP-288 was discovered by Dr. Rights in [[DATA EXPUNGED]]. Thankfully, her boyfriend grew wary of her extreme mood changes and called the Emergency SCP Contact number she had left for him, delivering SCP-288 into the Foundation's hands.

"I'm just glad I got suckered into it before somebody else did...even if it was horrible."
-Dr. Rights

It should be noted that both rings of SCP-288 resist being separated, and wearers may feel compelled to buy or even steal the rings in order to keep them nearby.

**Addendum:** It has been revealed through extensive backtracking of SCP-288's path that it has caused five instances of homicide, three suicides, and two cases of spousal abuse. It has been a regular occurrence in pawn shops across the nation for reportedly eighty years and all attempts to track it past a certain point have failed to reveal any evidence.

It is unknown how SCP-288 works, as there is no physical differences from any other wedding rings, to them.

**Incident Report #288-1 Brief**

> "As is well known, I am in a relationship currently. Me and █████, my boyfriend, were spending a day together last week, when we decided to go into ██████████...it's this awesome antiques place downtown and we sometimes go there to find old comic books and weird stuff for the house...and we were joking around with some rings, since you know...we try not to think about the big 'M' too much and //The agent recording the brief clears his throat to encourage her to stick to the point// ...Sorry. But we found this little ring box, and I playfully slipped on one of the rings and...things didn't seem that different but I just, I'm not sure why, but when he looked away I slipped the ring box into my pocket, still wearing the ring- what is it now? SCP-288? Right. It was very...uncomfortable. I don't even like wearing any jewelry, and I hate rings, but I couldn't take it off, and I guess stuff got really weird around that night when we got home. Now, I've had clingy, domestic mood before, but I cooked alfredo. I don't know how to do that even! I cooked dinner and cleaned up the house and of course █████ was a little weirded-out but he thought it was just another mood swing at this point-or my hormones acting up again, considering how that night went when...//The agent clears his throat again, indicating for her to skip over this part// -huh? Right. Well...I didn't feel like going to work the next day. And the next. Around that point █████ really got scared, and called the emergency SCP contact number I had given him, just in case. I guess they told him that I'd gotten exposed to some experimental drugs or a weird mold or something...They figured it out was the ring as soon as they took it off me to try and decontaminate me to figure it out, and I just...snapped out of it. I flipped out and, uh, well you know... //"Yes, Miss Rights. By the way, don't worry, the researcher you attacked will be fine."// Oh, good. But they found the other ring where I left it, in my dresser, and I hope to god I never get that put on me again. I mean, it wasn't all bad...but you know me. I don't take to control well. Not well at all..."
> -Dr. Agatha E. Rights, explaining the circumstances which bought 288 to the notice of the SCP Foundation.
