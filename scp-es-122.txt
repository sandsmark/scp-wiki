[[size 125%]] **Description:** [[/size]]

SCP-ES-122 is an anomalous multi-purpose software only executable on computers with operating systems derived from GNU/Linux. SCP-ES-122 instances comprise a single executable file called //greengrocer.exe//[[footnote]] All filenames have been translated from Spanish to English.[[/footnote]]. Although GNU/Linux-derived distributions are not capable of executing files with the .exe extension, opening the program will start an installer that will take the user through a series of steps to install the software. The following text was extracted from the "Terms and Conditions" of SCP-ES-122:

When SCP-ES-122 is installed, it runs under the name "greatGreenishGreenery v1.0.1". SCP-ES-122 has a variety of options that can only be used when a male-male USB cable is connected to the executing device. While SCP-ES-122 is running, the USB cable must be inserted into any plant (which invariably will end up being pierced by the connector). [[footnote]]Most of the time it is necessary to try to insert the connector several times; subjects who have done this process before have a better chance of inserting it on the first attempt.[[/footnote]]

Once a plant is connected via the USB cable, different types of data will be transferred to the device used. Depending on the size of the plant, the amount of data varies with a recorded maximum of about 8 terabytes[[footnote]]Despite the size of data transferred to the device's memory, the data transfer time is unchanged (10 seconds) and the performance of the device is not altered in any way.[[/footnote]]. Through its options, SCP-ES-122 is able to analyze the genetic traits, history, symbology, among other characteristics of the connected plant.

SCP-ES-122 has a programming language called SCP-ES-122-A, denoted by the software itself as //Lotto//[[footnote]]SCP-ES-122 includes a complete manual on how to program in SCP-ES-122-A.[[/footnote]]. SCP-ES-122-A is dynamic typing[[footnote]]Unlike strong typing languages, where the language before being compiled is analyzed for errors, dynamic or weak typing languages first interpret the code (execute it) and if there is an error, then it will be activated during its execution (e.g.: if a button changes its color when pressed, and if there is an error, then it will appear only when it is activated. Under strong typing, the error will be displayed first and the program will not run until its resolution). [[/footnote]] and object-oriented[[footnote]]Object Oriented Programming is a way of programming based on the concept of <<objects>>. Objects are an encapsulation of code that has characteristics (attributes) and actions (methods). This type of programming is done for the least repetition of code, because it is possible //heritage// the attributes and methods between object and object. For example, if it is <<animal>> an object that defines all the existing animals, it is possible to create an object adjacent to <<animal>> called <<mouse>> and which //h will inherit// actions and characteristics of the <<animals>>, and even so, <<mouse>> can have the same actions and characteristics. [[/footnote]]. Unlike other standard programming languages, SCP-ES-122-A uses words and abbreviations derived from Spanish[[footnote]] Both the sender and receiver of SCP-ES-122 are hispanic.[[/footnote]] as keywords[[footnote]]Generally they are abbreviations that denote some action or logical sentence, like <<<print on screen>> or <<if yes, then this. if no, then this>>. For example, <<structure>> or <<plant>> are non-standard keywords.[[/footnote]], which allude to the general purpose of SCP-ES-122. Although SCP-ES-122-A works with extremely complex data, it is designed to extract the data in such a way that the complete structure of the plants is represented without using genetic sequences, or represent each cell as a single component.

Each connected plant will register in the device used as a series of folders with subfiles and source code written in SCP-ES-122-A[[footnote]]Both the names of the folders and the files will vary between plant and plant, even if they are of the same species. The arrangement of the folders for each plant varies between species, for example, in generic trees, the first folders found will be <<root>>>, <<trunk>> and <<crown>>. Within each of these folders there are subfiles and subfolders denoting characteristics and actions extremely abstracted from the plant.[[/footnote]]. The modification of these files will have a direct impact on the plant, changing its biochemistry, anatomy, etc. Errors in the source code will invariably result in a rapid decrease in the Hume level of the plant from the error margin to completely cover it, leading to its subsequent disintegration if the source code is not debugged.

[[size 125%]] **Addendum 01:** SCP-ES-122 Testing Log[[/size]]

The following log is a summary of experiments performed with SCP-ES-122-A. For more information, personnel may see the extended SCP-ES-122 Testing Log.

[[collapsible show="» Show Testing Log" hide="« Hide Testing Log"]]
+ 
||~ Test No. 3||~ Plant: //Aloe vera//|||
||||**Modified File:** << sheets\main.fall >>  Modified leaf color. ||
|||| The instance progressively changed from its characteristic green color to a crimson tone. ||
||~ Test No. 8||~ Plant: //Aloe vera//|||
||||**Modified File:** << inflorescence\flowers.oto >>  Modified outcrop. ||
|||| During the outcrop, the flowers of the plant did not open, instead expanding until they exploded.||
||~ Test No. 11||~ Plant: //Mammilloydia candida//|||
||||**Modified file:** << structure\body.oto >>  Body vector[[footnote]]3D model of plant structure.[[/footnote]] modified.||
|||| After 2 weeks, the plant took a toroidal shape.||
||~ Test No. 17||~ Plant: //Rosa californica//||
||||**Modified file:** << petals\main.oto >>  Parameter of number of petals modified.||
|||| For 1 hour and 45 minutes, the number of plant petals changed every 4 minutes following the Fibonacci sequence. After the first hour, the number of petals grown was uncontrollable. Since the incineration of these did not change the next cycle of petal growth, a new modification was made to the plant stopping the addition of new petals. ||
||~ Test No. 25||~ Plant: Instances of [[[SCP-392]]]||
||||Modified File: << fruits\structure.oto >>  Modified fruit structure. ||
|||| The plant fruited non-anomalous peaches. No other anomalous properties were found in the modified instance.||
||~ Test No. 27||~ Plant: Instances of [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-es-041|SCP-ES-041]]]||
||||**Modified file:** << fruits\main.fall >>  Increased nutritional value. ||
|||| The plant produced several instances of SCP-ES-041-2 ten times larger than the original. When ingested, the exposed subjects presented a rapid increase in the level of sugar, vitamins, cholesterol and proteins in the blood, leading them to hepatorenal failure with deterioration of the arterial irrigation of the brain and myocardium. In spite of this, the oxygenation in the blood was sufficient to maintain breathing. At one point, the aforementioned levels stopped rising, maintaining a stable point (which would otherwise have started the process of putrefaction). The blood of the subject was transmuted, becoming a whitish gel with a composition similar to human milk but much denser. The subject suffered a notable cognitive deterioration and, despite remaining conscious, is unable to communicate.||
||~ Test No. 31||~ Plant: Trunk of //Quercus ilex//|||.
||||**Modified File:** Only the file "trunk.oto" was found. Regular connectors with other processes and tree structures were not found. Created the file "roots.oto" and programmed for tree rooting. ||
|||| The plant created roots of its own species, taking root in the soil of the place. The plant is under the supervision of the Site-35 Botanical Area.||
||~ Test No. 35||~ Plant: //Aloe vera// and //Rosa californica//|||
||||**Modified File:** Two instances of SCP-ES-122 were executed. The files << petals\main.oto >> of //R. californica// and << leaves\principal.oto >> of //A. vera// were mutually exchanged. Some sentences were modified. ||
|||| The instance of //A. vera// began to turn its leaves over itself, modifying its texture and shape to that of the petals of //R. californica//. The petals of the //R. californica// became more pointed, thick and green, forming the characteristic rosette of the //A. vera//. ||
||~ Test No. 39||~ Plant: //Penicillium claviforme//|||
||||**Modified file:** Impossible to analyze. ||
|||| SCP-ES-122 failed to analyze the fungus. ||
||~ Test No. 41||~ Plant: //Quercus robur// infected by //Penicillium claviforme//||
||||**Modified file:** << mycorrhiza\main.oto >>. Deleted the line attaching the plant and the fungus. ||
|||| The fungus detached from the plant. ||

[[size 125%]] **Item History:** [[/size]]

SCP-ES-122 was recovered from a raid at a meeting center of [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-es-041|Holy Church of the Vine]]][[footnote]]Although dependent on it, members of the Church use technology as a means for esoteric research and data transfer. [[/footnote]], in ██████, Chile. A total of 49 followers were captured; 5 died in the process. During the assault, 4 instances of modified local trees were eliminated. The instances possessed mobility through their roots and used their branches as arms. During their analysis, a nervous system similar to the human and tissues in their branches were found that allowed them to perceive the heat of the environment. Among the confiscated devices, the following conversation was recovered between the Stolon[[footnote]]An analog among the members of the Holy Church of the Vine for Parish Priest.[[/footnote]] Alberto Peceros, and a subject identified as PoI-12077 ("Maximus").

Below is an excerpt from the conversation[[footnote]] All records have been translated from Spanish to English.[[/footnote]]:

Greetings, dear Maximus.

This afternoon we had a small incident with your software. One of our colleagues tried to analyze one of our sacred plants and the soil, but he and the plant ended up disappearing. The place where they disappeared has now become a kind of "reality sphere", a place like a soap bubble.

We want answers.

Dude, what the fuck. Even a cross-eyed squirrel could use my program better than you and your little clique. Of course, they did the one thing any sane person wouldn't do. It only figures they don't know how to use my subtle programming language properly.  I've limited the alteration of reality, since it’s obvious that you see this as a toy. Eat a dick.

With love,
~~~ Maximus
