**Item #:** SCP-3175

**Object Class:** Safe (presumed Neutralized)

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3175 is housed in a Standard Humanoid Containment Unit at Site ██. Toys, books, games and other stimulation are to be provided at the discretion of Dr. ██████. SCP-3175 is to be allowed up to two hours of outdoor play per day under supervision.

**Description:** SCP-3175 is Lonnie James █████████ of ███ █████, ██████, recorded date of birth ██/██/2010. In all physiological respects, SCP-3175 appears to be a normal 6-year-old boy. Psychologically and cognitively, SCP-3175 displays a number of abnormalities which remain unexplained.

SCP-3175 claims to be Edwin Makepeace █████ of ████████, ████, recorded date of birth ██/██/1956[[footnote]]█████ was reported missing by his daughter Elizabeth on ██/██/2016. His remains have never been found.[[/footnote]]. According to SCP-3175, sometime during the night of ██/██/2016, after celebrating his 60th birthday, he found his consciousness transported by means unknown into the body of SCP-3175.

**Recovery:** SCP-3175 came to the attention of the Foundation in 2016 during a routine review of school records as part of Project SAMSARA. █████████ was flagged as possibly of interest to Project SAMSARA based on repeated disciplinary action for “telling the most ridiculous lies” in class. █████████ was subjected to preliminary psychological screening under the supervision of Dr. ██████, and although not found to meet the inclusion criteria for Project SAMSARA, was subsequently catalogued as SCP-3175. SCP-3175 was taken into Foundation custody under the cover story of the fatal rupture of a previously undiagnosed cerebral aneurysm. SCP-3175 has been transferred to secure housing at Site ██.

> **[Interview transcript begins.]**
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** Hello, Lonnie. My name is Dr. ██████. I’d like to talk to you a little bit, if that’s all right.
> 
> **█████████:** Sure, Doc.
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** These incidents at school have us all a little concerned. I wonder if you could tell me about them?
> 
> **█████████:** Look, you’d have told people too. I mean look at me!
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** What do you mean?
> 
> **█████████:** I’m a kid again! I can hear! I can see! I’ve got so much energy I can barely sit still! Yeah, I know, “Keep it to yourself, Edwin,” that was the plan. But…some things you just can’t keep bottled up.
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** Who is Edwin, Lonnie?
> 
> **█████████:** Me! Or not me, I guess, not any more, but the me who I was.
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** Do you mean you were reincarnated? Do you know what that means?
> 
> **█████████:** Don’t patronize me, Doc. No, I wasn’t reincarnated. I—well, I guess I made a wish.
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** I see. Go on?
> 
> **█████████:** Lizzie and Marcus and their boys, they threw me this surprise party. Did up the whole downstairs, like it was a kid’s party, you know? Balloons and streamers, ice cream and cake. You know those candles shaped like numbers? Lizzie put them on the cake. Six and oh. “Make a wish,” she said. And I guess I did.
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** And what was your wish?
> 
> **█████████:** You’re not supposed to tell a birthday wish, Doc. If you do it won’t come true.
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** But you believe your wish //did// come true, is that right?
> 
> **█████████:** Yeah, that’s a fair point. It was the candles, okay? There was the six and there was the oh, like I said, for sixty, and I was just looking at the six. And I remember thinking, “Wouldn’t that be nice. Wouldn’t it be nice to be six and to have it all to do over again.”
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** And then what?
> 
> **█████████:** And then nothing. I blew out the candles, we ate the cake. Opened presents. They gave me socks, these great thick wool socks. I wore them to bed that night. They were great. But then the next morning, I woke up, and… [Subject indicates himself.]
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** And?
> 
> **█████████:** And look at me!
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** And you have memories of your previous life?
> 
> **█████████:** Oh sure. I remember lots of stuff. In fourteen ninety two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue. America was founded in 1776.[[footnote]]Although the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence in 1776, the United States as a political entity first came into existence in 1777. This is a common misconception among adults.[[/footnote]] Righty tighty, lefty loosey. Six times twelve is seventy two. I remember it all. Except…
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** Except?
> 
> **█████████:** Well, Lizzie had these two boys. Twins. Beautiful little boys. Dalton and…and I can’t remember the other one. Doc, I can’t remember my grandson’s name.
> 
> **[Interview transcript ends.]**

> Whether there is any truth to subject’s account we cannot currently speculate, but subject is clearly both cognitively and psychologically abnormal. No relevance to Project SAMSARA, but recommend classification and transfer to secure housing for further evaluation.
> 
> Further recommend attempt to recover and classify birthday candle artifacts described by subject.
> 
> — Dr. ██████

> Request for classification granted. Subject is SCP-3175, provisional object class is Safe. Request for transfer granted. Request for recovery granted.
> 
> — Dr. █████████, Director, Site ██

> Birthday candle artifacts recovered from ██████████ Landfill on ██/██/2016: partially burned “6” candle and “0” candle, intact “1”–“5” and “7”–“9” candles. Artifacts extensively tested and found to be entirely non-anomalous.

> 
> **SCP-3175:** Okay. Food’s good. Don’t like being called that, though.
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** I’m sorry, but it’s part of our procedures. Do you understand what that means?
> 
> **SCP-3175:** [No response.]
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** Sorry. I don’t mean to condescend. You have to remember…well, how you look.
> 
> **SCP-3175:** Oh, I remember. Every morning I wake up in a bed that feels four sizes too big. I go to piss and here’s this little pee pee. I brush my teeth but they’re all wrong. Baby teeth, see?
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** It seems like you’re not feeling very well today.
> 
> **SCP-3175:** Oh I’m fine. Been having headaches.
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** Yes, I remember. Have the painkillers not helped?
> 
> **SCP-3175:** They help some.
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** Do you have any special requests?
> 
> **SCP-3175:** I could go for a cigarette.
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** I don’t—
> 
> **SCP-3175:** Just kidding, Doc. I gave ’em up years ago. Don’t suppose you can tell me when I’m getting out of here though? I know I’ve got my whole life ahead of me [SCP-3175 laughs] but time’s a-wastin’, you know? When can I go home?
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** Soon. Very soon.
