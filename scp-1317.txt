**Item #:** SCP-1317

**Object Class:** Euclid
 
**Special Containment Procedures:** All known instances of SCP-1317 are to be housed in Vault ██ of Site ██'s Euclid SCP wing. Under no circumstance should any personnel above D-class apply SCP-1317 to their skin. Any persons who have ben exposed to SCP-1317 are to be quarantined until they expire.

**Description:** SCP-1317 is a collection of vintage skin care products, manufactured sometime in 1942. Individual tins of SCP-1317 weigh approximately 0.5 Kg. The individual containers of SCP-1317 are brown, with the makeup itself being a shade of beige. When SCP-1317 comes into contact with living animal tissue, it will begin to integrate itself into the tissue. Continuous application of SCP-1317 will lead to the affected tissues being completely replaced by SCP-1317. In addition, SCP-1317 will replicate the biological function of all tissues it replaces. If the user does not continuously apply SCP-1317, the affected tissue will lose its cohesion over the next five weeks, which leads to the user experiencing fatal trauma. 

SCP-1317 was discovered in 1941, when an unusually high number of persons with critical skin conditions were reported from several US cities. Interviews with victims revealed that they had obtained SCP-1317 via an advertisement in a newspaper to "market test" new makeup products. Following the address provided by the advertiser resulted in a warehouse containing over ████ instances of SCP-1317. However, shortly after this warehouse was discovered, instances of SCP-1317 began appearing in pharmacies and newspaper advertisements in the United States, Canada, Britain, and Germany. Between 1943 and 1945, an estimated █████ additional instances of SCP-1317 were recovered from theses regions. However, after May of 1946, SCP-1317 ceased appearing in these areas. It is still unknown where these additional instances of SCP-1317 were produced, or how they were transported and stocked at these locations.

**Addendum 1317-A:** Progression of symptoms related to long-term SCP-1317 withdrawal:

One week: The user will report irritation in area that are affected by SCP-1317, similar to a mild rash. Subjects may also report increased amounts of skin flaking.

Two Weeks: The user will begin to develop more severe rashes in the afflicted areas. These rashes are usually a dark green or light purple. In addition, any of the users hair located in these affected areas will begin to fall out.

Three Weeks: The user will report serious discomfort in the affected areas. All of the user skin in the afflicted areas will have turned a purple-brown color, similar to flesh in the late stages of necrosis. Users at this stage will become highly reclusive due to their appearance, but only a small percentage will seek medical care. Users in this stage will have lost all body hair in the affected areas, and will begin losing hair in previously unaffected areas.

Four Weeks: The rash will begin to spread to other parts of the users body. Users at this stage will begin to experience extreme fatigue due to the fact that their muscles are beginning to lose cohesion. In addition, users at this stage will begin to report that strips of their flesh and large chunks of skin are beginning to fall of of their body. 98% of users who reach four weeks of exposure will have lost all body hair.

Five Weeks: At this stage, the users flesh will begin to lose cohesion. The afflicted area will have spread to 100% of the user's body. The first tissue to dissolve will usually be soft tissue such as the users eyes, cheeks, and loose areas of skin. Following this, harder tissues such as muscle and ligaments will begin dissolving. In cases where the user had used SCP-1317 for more than six months, the dissolution of organs such as the intestine, liver, bladder, and damage to the lymphatic and circulatory systems have been reported.
