Subject D-980-07 was treated for abrasions on the face and remained in stable condition for weeks after Incident 980-04. Though it is suspected that his vision was impaired, the subject has not opened his eyes or mouth since. Testing has shown that while he is physically able to open and presumably use his sensory organs, D-980-07 consciously chooses not to. He has not responded to sounds or smells of any sort, including a handgun fired nearby. Subject did not show any surprise, though later tests showed that his ears did sustain significant damage.

SCP-980 has been questioned about D-980-07's actions and claims not to know of his intentions. It has little knowledge of its effects on human beings but found his response unusual. It agreed with the interviewer on the tendency of its victims to react with physical changes rather than behavioral ones in later stages of development.

Testing to examine SCP-980's effects on humans has resumed.

> --**Subject D-980-15:**-- Facial changes, slight height gain, severe memory loss, vision loss, kidney failure, heart chamber fusion
> 
> --**Subject D-980-16:**-- Severe facial changes, suspected personality changes, slight skin changes, lung and heart simplification
> 
> --**Subject D-980-17:**-- Slight build changes, slight facial changes, memory loss, deafness, stomach and intestine fusion, slight heart chamber fusion, slight liver function loss, blindness

SCP-980 itself has stated that it does not, and has never intended to induce such transformations in organic beings and inanimate objects alike. The validity of such statements is unverified, though the fact that similar results are found in all things within a certain distance of SCP-980 regardless of its level of focus or activity seems to lend some amount of support to its claims. Though there is the possibility of manipulation or deception on the part of SCP-980, it appears probable that the effects themselves are an entirely different force than SCP-980 and have merely focused around it.

> --**Subject D-980-18:**-- Build changes, habit loss, suspected personality changes, slight heart chamber fusion, blindness, heart failure
> 
> --**Subject D-980-19:**-- Slight facial and build changes, slight supected memory loss, hearing loss, liver failure, blindness, deafness, severe lung alteration

Subject D-980-20 was the second D-class subject to show results similar to D-980-07. Though minor facial changes took place, similar behavioral changes were noted and subject was introduced to D-980-07. Though at first neither appeared to notice the other, after approximately 15 minutes left in containment D-980-07 began walking toward D-980-20 and stopped inches from his face. Both subjects remained still in this manner for the remaining hour and 45 minutes of the exposure.

> --**Subject D-980-21:**-- Build and slight facial changes, personality changes, deafness, lung alteration, kidney failure, fusion of skin over eyes 
> 
> --**Subject D-980-22:**-- Severe memory and personality loss, liver failure, blindness, heart chamber fusion
> 
> --**Subject D-980-23:**-- Slight facial changes, severe personality loss, deafness, fusion of skin over ears, heart chamber fusion, muteness

D-980-07 was exposed to SCP-980 a second time, albeit separated by a glass pane. Subject acted of his own accord for the first time in weeks to press himself against the glass, seemingly in an attempt to reduce distance between itself and SCP-980. SCP-980 backed away from the subject and sat against the far wall. D-980-07 was wheeled towards SCP-980 to ensure further changes would have the oppurtunity to occur. SCP-980's body language displayed fear.

> --**Subject D-980-24:**-- Severe build changes, personality changes, slight memory loss, blindness, deafness, fusion of skin over ears, lung alteration
> 
> --**Subject D-980-25:**-- Severe build and facial changes, slight personality changes and memory loss, fusion of skin over eyes, deafness, blindness, muteness, kidney failure, heart chamber fusion
> 
> --**Subject D-980-26:**-- Build changes, severe facial changes, severe personality loss, blindness, fusion of skin over eyes, fusion of skin over ears, muteness, liver failure, stomach and intestine fusion, deafness, fusion of skin over nose and mouth, fusion of heart chambers

D-980-07 showed physical changes during its second exposure to SCP-980. Subject experienced hair loss and skin formation of smooth surfaces over its unused sensory organs. D-980-07 has displayed remarkable improvement in navigation and self-awareness.

> **Subject D-980-27:** Severe build changes, facial changes, severe personality and memory loss, blindness, deafness, fusion of skin over mouth, ears, and eyes
> 
> **Subject D-980-28:** Severe build changes, slight facial changes, severe memory loss, deafness, fusion of skin over mouth, ears, and nose, muteness, fusion of skin over eyes
> 
> **Subject D-980-29:** Severe build and facial changes, severe personality and memory loss, blindness, deafness, fusion of skin over mouth, ears, nose, and eyes, muteness

Testing to examine SCP-980's effects on humans is suspended until further notice.
