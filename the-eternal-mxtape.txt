> **The Eternal MxTape** is about trying to escape a crushing sense of alienation and make yourself a better, more compassionate person... even when your underlying nihilism doesn't exactly go away.

> **The Eternal MxTape** is about a nonbinary media magician with a dissociative disorder so severe, they //disbelieved// themselves out of existence. It's also about an unlucky Foundation employee who wants //so badly// to do the right thing, it seriously interferes with her secondary work as a spy.

> **The Eternal MxTape** is about --wreaking terrible vengeance upon a heinous murderer who was also a bigoted jerk.-- Forget that guy. //He never really mattered//.

> **The Eternal MxTape** is (sorta) like //Doctor Who// by way of //Slaughterhouse-Five//, if Billy Pilgrim were a genderqueer //MST3K// dork and "regeneration" entailed a brief eternity in the abyss. It owes a lot to Douglas Adams and //Jojo's Bizarre Adventure//, but you don't have to worry about that (unless you're into it).

> **The Eternal MxTape** is about trying to uphold a quid pro quo in a nominally uncaring universe. Fortunately, this corner of existence is full of //people//, some of whom care about each other very, very much.

In short, this is a **[http://www.scp-wiki.net/gamers-against-weed-hub Gamers Against Weed]** story. More generally, it's about coming back from the brink, finding comfort in culture and companionship, and fighting back against a harsh world. It's about learning to forgive, and trying to be there for the people who need it most... because whoever and wherever we are, we are not alone.

**The Eternal MxTape** is meant to be a positive story, but it also grapples with some dark, heavy and difficult subject matter. These are ponderings on identity, nothingness and self-destruction, juxtaposed with social and political satire. With that in mind, **I want to be a responsible creator!** Part of that is preparation on my end. Part of that is allowing for preparation on //yours//, reader, if you need it. For that reason, I will attempt to provide content warnings in bumpers like these, or weave them into the Special Containment Procedures.

Most playlists have a default order, but regardless of whether you put them on shuffle, listen to them backwards, or pick and choose your preferred tracks, it's still a curated experience. **The Eternal MxTape** has a structure to it, but it's not //linear//; it plays out in different ways for different readers (and different characters!) based on where they jump in. You decide where the story starts, so pull up a chair! Pick a mix. Have fun. //Keep circulating the tapes.//
