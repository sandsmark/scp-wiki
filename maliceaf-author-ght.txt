title:MaliceAforethought's Author Page
[[collapsible show="M" hide="ME AS AN AUTHOR!"]]

Picture someone straight, white, male, middle class, reasonably young, British, mediocre and nerdy. This person is about as close to being me as anyone is ever going to get. I enjoy reading, writing, drawing, shitty puns, meta-humour, repeating myself, and meta-humour. The internet takes up a larger portion of my life than it perhaps should.

[[tab SCIPS]]

+++ SCP-2856 (Machines, machinations, and a warehouse in Leipzig):
> {{**[[[SCP-2856]]] is a large warehouse located on the outskirts of Leipzig, Germany, formerly owned by █████ Logistics...**}}

My third SCP and my most successful to date. The toasterMan scene was ripped almost entirely from a nightmare I had (it's a strange day when your subconscious is a better writer than you), and the narrative just seemed to congeal around it. I knocked out a first draft in a matter of hours, but didn't return to it for months -- I'm extremely glad that I did. While it went through modifications to fit various different formats (including a tale that I was sorry to abandon), it returned to something resembling the original SCP article and did surprisingly well for itself.

There's not much more to say about this one. It's dark, it's got body-horror, and I've hidden a very, //very// subtle Easter-egg relating to a fairly popular Series IV scip. 100 MalicePoints™ to anyone who can find it.

+++ SCP-3317 (Libre La Livres):
> {{**[[[SCP-3317]]] is a composite narrative, manifesting entirely through text presented via the written word...**}}

This was my first SCP, and went through a butt-ton of editing and revising before metamorphosing into the beautiful pseudo-Communist bibliovore you see before you today. Initially, it was a fairly basic format screw, with the Supreme Government of the Amalgamated Union of the Textual Plane taking over the 3317 slot. While reasonably interesting, it (ironically) lacked any kind of narrative, and the format screw angle was eventually ditched in favour of the current layout. I love it to pieces, and have a tale in the works about an encounter with a certain library-based GOI...

------

+++ SCP-3663 (The Adventure of the Cardboard Box):
> {{**[[[SCP-3663]]] is a humanoid entity constructed primarily from cardboard (in the form of boxes and tubes), adhesive tape, and twine...**}}

Ah yes, my second SCP article, and my first real attempt to convey a structured narrative. I had a much clearer picture of what I wanted to do this time round, and got to posting a lot more quickly than with 3317. Certain details have been changed along the way, and the narrative's been re-ordered and clarified more times than I care to count, but the central theme and ideas have remained the same throughout. Consider this one an experiment into the lands of humanoid Keters, and one that's been moderately successful. I'll probably get around to re-writing the dialogue at some point.

[[tab TALES]]
+++ Ex Nihilo Nihil:
> {{**They open the door, and my body freezes. The light is so bright it burns, and although I have no eyes to see it I know it is there. They move slowly around me, and I cannot run. I can never run, even when they no longer see me. [http://www.scp-wiki.net/ex-nihilo-nihil I am a slave to myself, and to my shapeless limbs.]**}}

Believe it or not, this was my first successful contribution to the site. It was (as far as I can recall) a coldpost, and was written in an evening for the 173-fest. It's a little too purple, a little too pretentious, and could have been structured better, but it holds a special place in my heart -- it's lack of failure gave me the confidence to start writing more, both on the site and off.

More to come!

I can often be found on #site19 under the nickname "MaliceAforethought", "MaliceAF", or some variant thereof. I am usually willing to crit anything reasonably short, or anything long if it's reasonably good. I suck at developing ideas, but will happily correct tone, grammar, spelling, and other such things. I plug my own pages relentlessly, and will check out everyone else's if I have enough time and energy. Do not start a pun war you cannot finish; my record is 23 minutes of god-awful hilarity.

At this point, you're probably thinking something along the lines of "is there anything this guy can't do?" Well guess what, I've done an art page as well! I update it --semi-regularly-- whenever I can be bothered, take requests, and the art is mediocre but improving.

You can find/investigate/hunt down/plagiarise/downvote my 'art' under the semi-hilarious title of [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/malicious-content|Malicious Content]]].

[[tab OTHER PEOPLE'S STUFF!]]

I needed something to fill out my page a bit, so I guess it would be good to show off some other people's stuff. "But Malice!", I hear you cry, "This is //your// author page, why would you show off the works of people who are clearly superior? Does that not make you look worse?" To which I reply, shut up.
