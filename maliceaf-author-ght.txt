title:MaliceAforethought's Author Page
[[collapsible show="M" hide="ME AS AN AUTHOR!"]]

Picture someone straight, white, male, middle class, reasonably young, British, mediocre and nerdy. This person is about as close to being me as anyone is ever going to get. I enjoy reading, writing, drawing, shitty puns, meta-humour, repeating myself, and meta-humour. The internet takes up a larger portion of my life than it perhaps should.

This table format was stolen directly from Tufto, who stole it from Mortos. The circle of life, ladies and gentlemen.

[[module ListPages created_by="MaliceAforethought" order="created_at" separate="no" tags="-author -tale -artwork" perPage="250" prependLine="||~ Item # ||~ Rating ||~ Comments ||~ Created ||"]]
|| %%title_linked%% || %%rating%% || %%comments%% || %%created_at%% ||
And yes, I know I've only got one so far. This will hopefully change in the near future.

Again, this list will hopefully grow as I stop procrastinating and actually start doing shit. Fingers crossed!

[[collapsible show="I" hide="IRC CHAT!"]]

I can often be found on #site19 under the nickname "MaliceAforethought" or some variant thereof. I am usually willing to crit anything reasonably short, or anything long if it's reasonably good. I suck at developing ideas, but will happily correct tone, grammar, spelling, and other such things. I plug my own pages relentlessly, and will check out everyone else's if I have enough time and energy. Do not start a pun war you cannot finish; my record is twenty solid minutes.

At this point, you're probably thinking something along the lines of "is there anything this guy can't do?" Well guess what, I've done an art page as well! I update it semi-regularly, take requests, and the art is mediocre but improving.

You can find/investigate/hunt down/plagiarise/downvote my 'art' under the hilarious title of [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/malicious-content|Malicious Content]]].

[[collapsible show="E" hide="EXTRA STUFF!"]]

I needed something to put under 'E', so I guess it would be good to show off some other people's stuff. "But Malice!", I hear you cry, "This is //your// author page, why would you show off the works of people who are clearly superior? Does that not make you look worse?" To which I reply, shut up.
