title:MaliceAforethought's Author Page
[[collapsible show="M" hide="ME AS AN AUTHOR!"]]

Picture someone straight, white, male, middle class, reasonably young, British, mediocre and nerdy. This person is about as close to being me as anyone is ever going to get. I enjoy reading, writing, drawing, shitty puns, meta-humour, repeating myself, and meta-humour. The internet takes up a larger portion of my life than it perhaps should.

Coming soon to an author page near you! (Spoiler: it's this one)

This table format was stolen directly from Tufto, who stole it from Mortos. The circle of life, ladies and gentlemen.

+++ SCIPS:

And yes, I know I've only got one so far. This will hopefully change in the near future.

[[collapsible show="I" hide="IRC CHAT!"]]

I can often be found on #site19 under the nickname "MaliceAforethought", "MaliceAF", or some variant thereof. I am usually willing to crit anything reasonably short, or anything long if it's reasonably good. I suck at developing ideas, but will happily correct tone, grammar, spelling, and other such things. I plug my own pages relentlessly, and will check out everyone else's if I have enough time and energy. Do not start a pun war you cannot finish; my record is 23 minutes of god-awful hilarity.

[[tab MY STUFF!]]

At this point, you're probably thinking something along the lines of "is there anything this guy can't do?" Well guess what, I've done an art page as well! I update it semi-regularly, take requests, and the art is mediocre but improving.

You can find/investigate/hunt down/plagiarise/downvote my 'art' under the semi-hilarious title of [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/malicious-content|Malicious Content]]].

[[tab OTHER PEOPLE'S STUFF!]]

I needed something to fill out my page a bit, so I guess it would be good to show off some other people's stuff. "But Malice!", I hear you cry, "This is //your// author page, why would you show off the works of people who are clearly superior? Does that not make you look worse?" To which I reply, shut up.
