**Title:** //Outdoor Object of Ordinance//

**Material Requirements:**
* One (1) 7’ Park Bench

**Abstract:** The //Outdoor Object of Ordinance// is a park bench. It is fully functional in the sense of it is able to be sat on comfortably by up to three people who do not know each other and up to five people who have known each other for a long period of time. One individual is able to comfortably assume his/herself in a horizontal or resting position on the surface of the bench. The //Outdoor Object of Ordinance// may also function as a surface of which objects can be placed, however objects smaller or as large as the gaps on the bench may drop to the ground if not handled with care.

As the object’s intent, it should be displayed in a park in which the public are able to spectate and utilise it as they please.

**Intent:** In my search for inspiration I have come across marvellous, remarkable displays of the most unconventional means of contemporary art done by my idols, the professionals, and quite a few of my colleagues. I marvel at their creation, in my mind thinking how I can succumb to their degree. Such dangerous, controversial, brave surrealistic objects can only be exceeded by a piece more dangerous, more controversial, more surrealistic.

I was sat down one Monday afternoon and in vain, attempted to gush all my thoughts and ideas into a sketch book. A life-sized replica of Joseph Stalin’s head reciting Soviet secret in the tune of the first documented song by humanity. A school play of Les Miserables with genuine famine. North Korea but bees. Nothing satisfied me. As I stood up from where I was sitting, it hit me.

How everything in this movement must be outrageously controversial and most likely dangerous. To create anomalies is largely and almost solely the purpose of this art movement, however your regular bench would be an anomaly among anomalies. Everything, every piece in the movement could be broken by something so mundane because mundanity itself defies normalcy. This piece of mine may anger critiques, create controversy within the movement. I feel that it is part of my duty as an artist.
