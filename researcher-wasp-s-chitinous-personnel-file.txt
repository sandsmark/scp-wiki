Hello I am DL_Baryonyx, local frenchman roaming the lands of author blocks and procrastination.
I wrote my first SCP in 2018 after motivation finally pushed me to contribute on the community i have been following for a few years now. I am the leader of the SCP minecraft mod, [https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/scp-lockdown SCP Lockdown] as well as a former developper on [https://www.scp-unity.com/ SCP Unity].
Below are all my contributions.

Main Site articles:

[[[SCP-4169]]] - Carbonized Purgatory: This was my first article on the site. The history behind that SCP was me wanting to pay tribute to a scene that genuinely scared me as a kid, the famous bug pit scene of King Kong (2005). I'm surprised it's still on the site, as I wouldn't call it anything special. But I'm nonetheless proud of how it ended up, considering it was my very first article.

[[[SCP-4178]]] - Arachnespheksophobia: I consider 4178 to be my first true article (and most successful). Originally an entry for the clich√© contest in 2019 running in the spooky monster category. It was deleted after falling below -10. After picking it back up and enhancing it and commisionning an image to a friend, it was reposted and currently sits at +40.

[[[SCP-4191]]] - Draco ignem: 4191 is a special case, originally it was the idea of a friend that worked a bit on it. After a year of inactivity he passed the torch onto me and i completed it using his feedback. 4191 is quite barebone but i took the opportunity of trying to make it interesting by doing something unusual, linking it with a foreign SCP! [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-124-fr SCP-124-FR] to be precise.

[[[SCP-4307]]] - Electro-Marine Praetorian: Ahh 4307, written under 3 weeks not counting the wait for approval and feedback. 4307 was actually the very first SCP i came up with but was my third article on the site.
