> ++ UTILISATION:
> 
> The purpose of this documentation is to inform personnel of basic procedures during an on-site lockdown following a compromise of security or containment. Advanced copies, including re-containment protocol manuals, may be accessed by requesting such from your immediate supervisor.
> 
> Refer to this manual as your most reliable source. Lockdown procedures must be fast in order to achieve effectiveness, utilising speed as an advantage over the adversary threat. Misunderstanding basic regulations can endanger everyone you work with. Due to this, site administration requires all personnel to be familiar with this manual.
> 
> ++ DISTRIBUTION:
> 
> Unless directed otherwise, staff are reminded that the content of this manual is strictly classified, and remains site-specific in context. Distribution across sites is a Type-3a offence. Exchange/viewing of copies provided to separate personnel is also prohibited.
> 
> Staff suspecting a breach of this regulation are to contact administration immediately.

> //Over the years we have come to accept that an entirely secure facility, equally protected from both internal and external forces, is an impossible equilibrium to correctly achieve. This is why lockdowns are an integrated part of our Foundation system. Entering a mindset in which a goal of absolute control exists is a futile effort. It is important to consider that there is always more that can turn out wrong than right. Not relying on procedures such as these would be a complete denial of the wrong. The Foundation is built upon grounds of acceptance, not ignorance. Don't be ignorant.//
> 
> //- Dr. Sawer, Head of Site Safety and Containment Regulations Board.//
> 
> ++ OVERVIEW
> 
> A lockdown is defined as a varying emergency procedure in response to a containment breach or loss of security. Lockdowns are requested using LID (Lockdown Intensity Degree) codes, and issued from automated HIVE systems. Once evaluated, lockdowns are classified using Lockdown Degrees, which provides pre-created guidance on the appropriate response, such as AMTF (Armed Mobile Task Force) units and Automated Response Initiatives (ARIs), commissioned when appropriate to suppress the apparent threat.
> 
> ++ BACKGROUND
> 
> Lockdowns first became official standard regulations following the 1931/03/12 containment breach, and multiple on-site accidents resulting in the severe loss of Foundation personnel, material, and vital assets. Since then, the Foundation has made substantial efforts to re-integrate a more secure, reliable and dependable methods of repressing internal instability among sites. Some of the first MTFs (Mobile Task Forces), such as Epsilon-11, were commissioned to advance against the increasing number of contained anomalous objects across the Foundation.
> 
> For a number of years, over the period known as the "deep waters", the Foundation was prone to regular breaches and loss of vital assets, due to [*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/goi-formats influencing opposing factions], falling containment standards and disobedience of Foundation personnel, including the creation of the [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/groups-of-interest#toc4 Chaos Insurgency] in 1928, where the lowering ethics of the Foundation provoked a unit to go A.W.O.L and re-form as an extremely hostile splinter-group. The response to containment breaches was eventually re-considered and altered by the O5 council in 1935.
> 
> Following the containment of multiple Keter-class anomalies in the 1980s, containment breach severity and frequency increased dramatically throughout certain Foundation facilities. New Armed Mobile Task Forces (AMTFs), such as Nu-7 and Eta-5, were founded with the goal of assisting in re-containment and repression of these new threats. Contemporary material science had not developed to a point that would allow for the effective economical containment of these entities. However, as technology advanced, the threats posed by these anomalies and the period known as the "reptile scares" were eventually mitigated by the mid-1990s.
> 
> One of the most recent periods involving a Foundation-wide lowering in containment safety involved the infamous [*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sc-14-126-20-921 "two-naught-seven strikes"] throughout 2015, in which eighteen sites were attacked by the autonomously fast, possessive and senselessly lethal entity known as subject two-naught-seven, presumed to have been created by the Chaos Insurgency (CI) in 2011 as an uncontained and un-coordinated biological weapon against the Foundation. The strikes were most effective because they were governed by a complete lack of knowledge regarding a spontaneous attack, the loss of vital security MTF teams, and multiple encounters with civilian populations - attempting to expose Foundation secrecy. Subject two-naught-seven was last observed on the 8th September 2017 in a disused metro station, after assaulting 5 separate MTF divisions and subsequently disappearing under an approaching train.
> 
> ++ HIVE SYSTEMS
> 
> //Many of you have questioned our adoption of the HIVE systems. If you want to personally sift-through 3 files every second when dealing with appropriate responses to simultaneous rapidly-developing lockdowns, then be our guest.//
> 
> //- Dr. Walsh, Senior Executive of Foundation Records Systems.//
> 
> Originally, lockdowns were ordered manually by the O5 council, as a response to a distress call triggered from a select facility. Following the scale of the Foundation expansion, registration and commission of any lockdown is now controlled by electronic systems, known as the HIVE.
> 
> Following the alert of a breach warning, a system will request authorisation from the O5 council. After 3 minutes of no response, the system will request authorisation from administration staff. If no valid response is received within 1 minutes, the system will request authorisation from any foreign site. If no responses are confirmed after eight 8 minutes, the system will enter "light lockdown", sealing all doors, ventilation, utilities and power from the outside. A "light lockdown" does not include the deployment of any Automated Response Initiatives, such as on-site nuclear devices, or the deep-storage of any data banks, but will request MTF response with highest priority. During this process, a confirmation of a specified Lockdown Degree can be accepted by any of the aforementioned and leave the unspecified state of "light lockdown".
> 
> ++ LOCKDOWN INTENSITY DEGREE
> 
> //Nobody really knows who thought it up, but the LID codes work and seem to tell us everything required in less than a sentence.//
> 
> //- Dr. Alder, Head of Lockdown Response Committee.//
> 
> A Lockdown Intensity Degree (LID), refers to three values; a numerical and alphabetical character, and a set of specialised coordinates, indicating in total the precise and readable condition of an apparent site-lockdown. This designation code system is most effective when requesting the support of a [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/task-forces re-containment MTF] or other body unaware of the current situation. Incidents have occurred in the past involving a failure to understand the situation due to an extensive/unreadable description, leading to the creation of the LID system as an effective replacement, utilising speed and response time to maximise capability of an external MTF unit.
> 
> ++ DECIPHERING
> 
> Deciphering a LID is short and simple. An example would be "3/A*/921-3-81". The first numerical value refers to the approximated number of un-contained anomalous objects, or other hostile combatants involved in the breach; the alphabetical value indicating the "intensity grade" [A, B, C, D]; and the string of integers specifying the affected areas and coordinates.
> 
> +++ INTENSITY GRADE:
> 
> "Intensity grade" is considered one of the most vague aspects of the LID system, and is more appropriately utilised as a one-character description of the current intensity of the breach. "Grade-A" often is issued to illustrate a maximum-class priority, involving the possible escape of several Keter-class SCP objects, a substantial threat to public exposure, a requirement of the on-site nuclear devices to be detonated, or the complete loss of the facility. "Grade-D" may involve a minimal threat, with few Safe/Euclid SCP objects uncontained, or the loss of several escaped [http://www.scp-wiki.net/security-clearance-levels#toc11 D-Class personnel].
> 
> On occasion, a LID code may be issued with an intensity grade followed by a unique character. "Grade A*", "Grade A+" or "Grade A-" each refer to an "evaluated" threat. "A+" is often used to warn of an escaped Large-Scale Aggressor (Such as [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-682 SCP-682]), suggesting a response of a heavily-armed battalion-strength MTF such as Eta-5 or Nu-7. "A-" refers to a possible threat of public exposure including loss of Foundation secrecy, advising for an MTF response such as [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/task-forces#toc4 MTF-Gamma-5]. "A*" involves a dimensional or incorporeal threat, requesting support from a group advanced and specialised MTFs including [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/task-forces#toc9 MTF-Zeta-9], [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/task-forces#toc8 MTF-Epsilon-11] or [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/task-forces#toc17 MTF-Lambda-5]. In more complex incidents, multiple supporting-symbols can be used to provide further additional information at once.
> 
> +++ "UNCONTAINED" UNIT:
> 
> The "uncontained unit" (first value) is not always accurate at indicating the quantity of hostile combatants. The value is likely to change continually on a ratio dependant on the "intensity grade", and issues an approximated, not definite number.
> 
> A high uncontained unit is also not necessarily a substantial threat. Many SCP objects are incapable of self-movement, but the value should be utilised as an affective measurement or "scale" of the breach, providing the estimated requirements/time to re-contain all escaped SCP objects.
> 
> +++ AFFECTED AREAS:
> 
> The final unit, a string of integers specifying the affected areas is readable following the order: units, compounds, site. An example consists of "921-3-81". The first integer specifies the quantity of affected units, in this case, being 921 affected units. The second integer indicates the number of affected compounds, being 3. The final number states the site of interest, being [http://www.scp-wiki.net/secure-facility-dossier-site-81 Site-81]. In total, the affected areas would read as "921 units affected in 3 compounds on Site-81". This system is considerably faster than providing specific coordinates, and has already been in usage since the first re-containment MTF units.
> 
> ++ LOCKDOWN CLASSIFICATIONS
> 
> //Lockdowns happen in a multitude of ways, and there are an even larger multitude of things you need to consider as a response. Planning-out categories for the future makes work easier. Hopefully.//
> 
> //- Dr. Hayward, Retired Head of Site Safety Board.//
> 
> A lockdown is further assessed once MTF response teams arrive, and given a specific Lockdown classification, including a more complete description. A lockdown classification has multiple purposes, setting the definite priority of the lockdown on a scale, selecting specific MTFs, authorising ARIs (Automated Response Initiatives)[[footnote]] See Automated Response Initiatives below. [[/footnote]], and providing confirmation regarding code of conduct to the [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/ethics-committee-orientation Ethics Committee]. Lockdown classifications are set into 9 "categories", labeled by characters taken from the Ancient Greek Language. This system is used universally across sites.
> 
> +++ CATEGORY: Γ-Gamma "THANATOS":
> 
> //Thanatos, the personification of death. Son of night and darkness, and brother of hypnotic sleep.//
> 
> Category Γ-Gamma is the lowest priority of lockdown degree, used as a vague category to define a memetic[[footnote]] Concept of self-replicating information. [[/footnote]], infohazardous[[footnote]] Information that may harm those with the very knowing of it. [[/footnote]] or cognitohazardous[[footnote]] Visual threat that may harm those upon seeing. [[/footnote]] threat, one standard on-site staff are unable to currently suppress without foreign intervention.
> 
> The response to Category Γ-Gamma limits to small-scale unarmed MTF responses, such as [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/task-forces#toc10 MTF-Eta-10] ("See No Evil") or [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/task-forces#toc11 MTF-Eta-11] ("Savage Beasts"). Staff involved in a Category Γ-Gamma are to be aware of potentially compromised staff, and refrain from intervention with personnel targeted by memetic/obsessive effects. For prevention of memetic agents indirectly escaping the site, MAGNI will take appropriate actions to contain select units and block all auditory and visual communication methods to the outside that exhibit cognitohazardous properties.
> 
> 
> +++ CATEGORY: δ-Delta "CERBERUS":
> 
> //Cerberus, the "hound of hades", preventing the dead from leaving of the underworld.//
> 
> Category δ-Delta is a frequent category of lockdown often associated with a small-scale containment breach; including several escaped sentient[[footnote]] Sensually-aware. Do not confuse with sapient. Includes examples such as [[[SCP-1913]]] and [[[SCP-1048]]].[[/footnote]]/hazardous anomalous objects, such as an intelligent threat, or one capable of organised resistance. This may also include a minor site raid from a hostile faction, or the escape of multiple D-Class assailants.
> 
> Response rates to Category δ-Delta will be given priority over Category Γ-Gamma. More sizeable AMTFs will also be allocated to suppress Category δ-Delta lockdowns, the most active in the last years being [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/task-forces#toc8 MTF-Epsilon-11] ("Nine-Tailed-Fox"). The ARI, MAGNI[[footnote]] See Automated Response Initiatives below. [[/footnote]], will also allocate a noticeably greater enforcement of its capabilities, however refrain from closure of ventilation or entrance gate mechanics until the threat is further evaluated.
> 
> +++ CATEGORY: Θ-Theta "PROMETHEUS":
> 
> //Prometheus, giver of fire to man. Bound to suffering for his actions.//
> 
> Category Θ-Theta breaches may refer to a threat derived from a bio-hazardous[[footnote]] See [[[SCP-2075]]], [[[SCP-1100]]], [[[SCP-2870]]]. [[/footnote]], infectious, or other contamination source[[footnote]] See [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-059 SCP-059]. [[/footnote]]. These may include highly-infectious microorganisms[[footnote]] See [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-008 SCP-008], [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-020 SCP-020], [[[SCP-1121]]].[[/footnote]], biological weapons, or anomalous self-sustaining reactions[[footnote]] See [[[SCP-2102]]]. [[/footnote]] capable of dramatically increasing in severity unless immediately countered.
> 
> The standard listed MTF allocated to suppress Category Θ-Theta lockdowns remains [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/task-forces#toc3 MTF-Beta-7] ("Maz Hatters"). MAGNI will lock entrance gates, block ventilation and sewage systems, close select units and cut power lines/other utilities to prevent spread of airborne hazardous substances. In the case of an anomalous pandemic, MTF divisions will act rapidly in the containment and liquidation of areas affected by such anomalies. Surviving staff will be quarantined and examined for possible contamination. Incidents involving a catastrophic self-sustaining reaction are to be contained with maximum efficiency to prevent further spread into an "unrecoverable" situation.
> 
> +++ CATEGORY: Ι-Iota "STYX":
> 
> //Styx, the river defining the boundary between the dead and the living.//
> 
> Category I-Iota lockdowns define the parameters in which a Large-Scale Aggressor (LSA) such as [[[SCP-2059]]], may escape containment and pose a substantial threat to the site.
> 
> Responses for Category I-Iota lockdowns are of upper priority and almost all available battalion-strength AMTFs can be allocated at any time, such as [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/task-forces#toc21 MTF-Nu-7] ("Hammer Down") and [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/task-forces#toc32 MTF-Eta-5] ("Jaeger Bombers"). [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/task-forces#toc4 MTF-Gamma-5] ("Red Herrings") may also be dispatched to liquidate incidents involving possible public exposure/sightings. I-Iota lockdowns are frequent and well-planned as a recurring threat from SCP-682. ARIs, such as ODIN-D, possess official control to detonate the Alpha warheads above the site following a "cold-zero" containment breach. Class-B priorities have the magnitude to on occasion result in substantial loss of personnel and vital assets.
> 
> +++ CATEGORY: ρ-Rho "HYDRA":
> 
> //Hydra, an almost invulnerable serpentine water monster, reputable as an entrance to the underworld.//
> 
> Category ρ-Rho lockdowns are the given response to the escape of a NTT (Non-Terminable Threat) such as [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-096 SCP-096]. A NNT is defined as a threat that, given the circumstances or present resources, is unable to be terminated by response teams during the incident, or are otherwise invulnerable to any form of attack.
> 
> Category ρ-Rho lockdowns are severe and require immediate response from a specialised re-containment AMTF, such as MTF-Epsilon-11 ("Nine-Tailed-Fox") or MTF-Sigma-23 ("Backup Required"). Techniques used to deal with Category ρ-Rho breaches do not always originate from direct force, and often require luring, bating, or otherwise inducing the threat into a docile state before capture and movement back to a secure location.
> 
> +++ CATEGORY: Υ-Upsilon "ACHLYS":
> 
> //Achlys, an ancient being older than chaos itself, the personification of misery and sadness.//
> 
> Class Υ-Upsilon lockdowns indicate the assault of a highly-organised major assimilation-force.
> 
> Responses will include battalion-force AMTFs, such as MTF-Nu-7 ("Hammer Down"). Defensive ARIs, such as THOR, VALI-SYS and AESIR, with be indiscriminately deployed during the holding of the site. Should the site be lost, LOKI-O5 will request for total destruction of the immediate vicinity surrounding the affected facilities.
> 
> [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/groups-of-interest#toc4 Chaos Insurgency] and [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/groups-of-interest#toc21 Serpent's Hand] raids are among the most frequent, and staff are reminded that most attacks from smaller organisations such as these will originate from within the site as a false member of staff. Personnel are most familiar with this form of raid.
> 
> Should larger organisations mount a hostile attack, such as the [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/groups-of-interest#toc10 GOC (Global Occult Coalition)], responses will include battalion-force AMTFs, such as MTF-Nu-7 ("Hammer Down"). Defensive ARIs, such as THOR, VALI-SYS and AESIR, with be indiscriminately deployed during the holding of the site. Should the site be lost, LOKI-O5 will request for total destruction of the immediate vicinity surrounding the affected facilities. Large-scale raids will most likely originate from outside the site.
> 
> +++ CATEGORY: Φ-Phi "EURYNOMOS":
> 
> //Eurynomos, a ghostly demon of the underworld, which feasts off the flesh of the dead, leaving only their bones.//
> 
> Class Φ-Phi is used to designate a lockdown involving a dimensional threat, including a spatial or temporal alteration[[footnote]] Alteration spatially (in space) or temporally (in time). [[/footnote]], continuity error[[footnote]] See [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-196 SCP-196].[[/footnote]], incorporeal objects[[footnote]] Objects not composed of matter, or having no material existence. [[/footnote]], trans-dimensional entities[[footnote]] See [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-675 SCP-675] [[/footnote]], or objects capable of breaking fundamental natural laws and processes.
> 
> Lockdowns categorised as "Φ-Phi" are of upper-priority. Listed AMTFs include [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/task-forces#toc9 MTF-Zeta-9] ("Mole Rats"), [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/task-forces#toc17 MTF-Lambda-5] ("White Rabbits") and [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/task-forces#toc20 MTF-Mu-13] ("Ghostbusters"). Category Φ-Phi lockdowns are often unpredictable, and require both planning and appropriate field-knowledge. Due to the irregularity and at time irrationality, Φ-Phi lockdowns are extremely vague and MTFs are advised to make substantial preparations. To assist, RINDRE will automatically "lock dimensions" to limit the effects of incorporeal or dimensional threats.
>  
> +++ CATEGORY: Ψ-Psi "HADES":
> 
> //Hades, god and owner of the dead and the dying.//
> 
> Category Ψ-Psi lockdowns have only been submitted on three occasions. Once to deal with a CI[[footnote]] Chaos Insurgency [[/footnote]] assimilation force, second to prevent the 08/06 leakage, and third during the infamous 03/12 breach. In order to define a Category Ψ-Psi lockdown, the threat must be of a level capable of fatally exposing, or entirely eradicating the Foundation organisation.
> 
> Parameters of guidance regarding a Category Ψ-Psi lockdown have been entirely classified, and remains a subject of the O5 council, however staff can expect that the detonation of the Alpha warheads and the granting of the LOKI-O5 protocol. Yes, a significant threat to all personnel will occur during a Category Ψ-Psi lockdown, but the council stresses the severity that the situation must pertain before the granting of the LOKI-O5 protocol and subsequent loss.
> 
> +++ CATEGORY: Ω-Omega "TARTARUS"
> 
> //Tartarus, a deep and abysmal prison of the underworld, forever tormenting the dead who have committed acts of murder.//
> 
> A Category Ω-Omega lockdown is mostly undefined, a protocol given to highest members of the O5 Council during a situation of extreme crisis, detailing the response to a XK or ZK class end-of-the-world scenario.
> 
> It is still disputed whether any member of the Foundation entirely understands the directives of a Category Ω-Omega lockdown, or if the class exists at all.
> 
> ++ AUTOMATED RESPONSE INITIATIVES
> 
> Automated Response Initiatives (ARIs) are mechanised systems providing a specific counter-measure against a suspected breach.
> 
> Deployment of an ARI will be applied regarding the Lockdown Degree issued to the breach. The higher the degree, the more prevalent the ARI.
> 
> +++ ODIN-D:
> 
> ODIN-D, or the Operational Defence Initiative for Nuclear Devices, is the initiative program responsible for the manually-confirmed detonation of the on-site Alpha warheads located (in cases of subterranean sites) on the surface of the facility. ODIN-D is authorised only in high-threat situations exceeding Class-B, being an effective method of terminating all life directly above, while protecting most sites with underground blast-shielding and remaining mostly intact after deployment.
> 
> +++ LOKI-O5:
> 
> LOKI-O5 stands for the Low Operational Kinetic-energy Initiative, authorised only by O5 council members, following the issue of a Class-A Lockdown Degree. LOKI-O5 is issued partial control in the immediate and autonomous detonation of the Omega kinetic warheads[[footnote]] Suspected kinetic-energy weapon, utilising the conversion of kinetic force into thermal force to devastating capabilities. [[/footnote]] located underneath the main facility. [Further information regarding the LOKI-O5 protocol has been removed as of 03/11/██ by the O5 council and Ethics committee. Requesting access to this removed information can be attained through contact of your immediate supervisor.]
> 
> +++ VALI-SYS:
> 
> VALI, or the Visual And Light Impairment System, is a program applying sensual impairment, such as strobe lights and high-pitch audio to disorientate and repress hostile combatants. VALI is most often utilised when facing external threats such as raids from hostile factions, or entities responding to a standard human sensual environment.
> 
> +++ THOR:
> 
> The Tesla-static Heat-Origin Regulation is a site-specific program responsible for utilising allocated electrostatic tesla-gates, electrocuting or stunning entities or objects moving at an irregular pace not similar to human movement. On a number of occasions, THOR has resulted in the stunning of staff suffering from movement problems, disabilities, or other impairments causing a significant variation in movement speed. Due to this, THOR has gained an infamous reputation, and has been moved to requiring at minimum of a Class-C Lockdown Degree to prevent further unnecessary casualties. Disabled staff are continually reminded to ask a site administrator to close the tesla gates before proceeding through an active one.
> 
> +++ MAGNI:
> 
> MAGNI or MAG-LC-NI, refers to the Main Autonomous General Lockdown Closure for Nominated Incentives, in partial control over the closure/lockdown of all door, utility and ventilation system, and in direct connection with the HIVE system for maximum response time. MAGNI can be authorised on any grade higher than Class-E, and will automatically close select units, compounds and sites to varying intensities dependant on the Lockdown Degree, including site gates, sewage systems, power lines, radio connection and issue Protocol 15-A on all data banks, causing most to enter deep-storage. MAGNI is effective due to the rate at which it can respond to a breach, and is one of the most essential response initiatives for any site.
> 
> +++ AESIR:
> 
> AESIR represents the AirbornE Systemic Infusion Regulation, a further infamous response initiative (a common subject of the Ethics Committee) is in direct and full control over the release of gaseous agents into compounds affected by containment breaches. The AESIR program utilises multiple agents, including sedatives, reversible-paralytics, nerve agents, vesicants and intoxicants. Separate agents are utilised for specific Lockdown Degrees and in varying states of emergency, or to combat specific evaluated threats. The most frequently applied are reversible-paralytics, allowing retrieval staff but not entire elimination of the threat. Areas flushed with vesicants or intoxicants are designed for repression, while nerve agents are used for direct and lethal results.
> 
> +++ RINDRE:
> 
> RINDRE, or the Reality Initiative for Non-Dimensional Risk Entities, controls the "reality anchors" influencing the hume level[[footnote]] Measure of "reality" in any given spatial area. [[/footnote]] within sites containing trans-dimensional objects. These "reality anchors" essentially combine dimensions, "locking" dimensional entities into the same dimensional space as site guards and MTFs, limiting the effects of objects including [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-106 SCP-106].
> 
> ++ EVACUATION
> 
> Evacuation of a site is the practice in which staff will withdraw from affected facilities following a lockdown. Evacuations will proceed within the "Evacuation Phase", the period in which threats are still mostly developing, and have not yet pertained an intensity requiring the closure of the evacuation shelters.
> 
> +++ GUIDANCE
> 
> Staff involved in any lockdown are to seek evacuation as their highest priority. Detailed evacuation plans and prints can be found in Administration and Security. Smaller plans are also present in each compound. These will direct staff towards the nearest evacuation shelter.
> 
> Armed site security staff will also assist in the evacuation process, and divide a team for each affected compound. Teams will accompany personnel to evacuation shelters, and attempt to repress developing threats until MTF units arrive. Staff are advised to follow security teams.
> 
> Evacuation shelters can be closed manually if the threat reaches a substantial level, or otherwise given a timeout-lock for 2-3 minutes. Speed and arrival time is critical. Personnel not inside an evacuation shelter before closure are no longer a priority of security, and are handed to the responsibility of MTF units entering the facility. Staff in this situation are advised to hide and not retaliate against threats, or intervene in any way with a struggle or death of another member of staff. Self-preservation is required above the safety of others. Do not startle, distract or expose MTF teams.
> 
> Once inside evacuation shelters staff will be registered. Personnel unaccounted for will be added to a staff list for MTF units to retrieve and recover. Staff are reminded that they in the eyes of MTF units are of second priority. A list will also be sent to MTF teams of contained SCP objects and assets within the site that may or may not be an active threat.
> 
> Extraction of personnel will commence once all threats have been neutralised or re-contained. Personnel will be examined and quarantined for further evaluation until they are safe from possible contagions, memetic/obsessive effects or post-traumatic stress.
> 
> ++ RECOVERY
> 
> The recovery operation can last extended periods of time depending upon the extent of damage or public exposure. Recovery includes the restoration of the site, application of amnestics, re-containment of anomalous objects, registration of staff, evaluation of causes, and liquidation of events.
> 
> +++ EVALUATED CAUSES
> 
> Causes of breaches and subsequent lockdowns can be categorised into the following classes:
> 
> * Failure of automated systems, such as gate mechanics, specialised containment systems, or data corruption.
> * Infiltration or incursion from a hostile [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/groups-of-interest Group of Interest, (GOI)]. Members of the Serpent's Hand and Chaos Insurgency utilise this method of attack with terrorising effect.
> * Disloyalties, unawareness, misjudgements or general faults of containment staff.
> * Underestimated scale of threat and needs for containment of a specific object.
> * Uncontainable anomalous objects.
> * Direct assault or raids from a foreign force.
> * Memetic/obsessive effects or manipulation of staff. This may include actions forced-upon staff members without consent.
> 
> Investigation teams will utilise electronic logs, security footage and witnesses among many methods to identify the cause.
> 
> +++ INVOLVED PERSONNEL
> 
> Personnel involved in the recovery and liquidation operation following a breach are classified into specific teams, each identifiable by a select symbol. This symbol accounts for both colour-blind and visually-impaired staff, and will be found on the uniform of the personnel of interest.
> 
> MTF/AMTF units are identifiable from the triple-red lines symbol. Their role in the recovery process is in securing the facility from hostile combatants/anomalous objects, and in the evacuation of surviving staff members. Most MTF teams are armed, and those heavily-armed with military-grade vehicles and specialised weaponry known as AMTFs. MTF teams will only participate in the immediate response and recovery period after a lockdown.
> 
> Registration teams are identifiable from the blue ring symbol. Members are responsible for the accounting of surviving staff, lost assets, neutralised anomalous objects, and personnel mortalities/casualties.
> 
> Liquidation teams are the backbone of the recovery operation, identifiable from the yellow cross symbol. Members specialise into multiple sub-teams and roles, including application of amnestics on public exposure, clearance of destroyed facilities, treatment of injured personnel, and evaluation of the total damage.
> 
> Object-movement teams are identifiable for the orange dash symbol, responsible for the re-containment and movement of anomalous objects, and often work in-turn with MTF units and other field personnel/agents to secure and evaluate the threat. These teams will be present for the early part of the recovery operation.
> 
> Investigation teams are not widely recognised and often hide their role for security measures, but are most commonly attributed to a green triangle symbol, and are involved in the evaluation of events leading up to the lockdown, and the ultimate cause. Investigation teams utilise security footage, electronic logs and witnesses (among many methods) to identify the aforementioned.
> 
> +++ RE-CONTAINMENT PROTOCOLS
> 
> [THIS SECTION IS ADDRESSED TO OBJECT-MOVEMENT TEAMS ONLY.]
> 
> Re-containment protocols are the methods object-movement teams should follow in order to obtain secure hold over a specific anomalous object. Each threat will have unique re-containment protocols, and the same method will not apply to all.
> 
> Large Scale Aggressors (LSAs) are some of the most fundamentally challenging objects to successfully acquire and re-contain with minimal loss. Multiple encounters with SCP-682 suggest the most effective method of securing is through distraction and luring. LSAs are known to rarely reach a docile state, and may have to be surrounded and forcibly constrained by multiple battalion-strength AMTFs once lured into an appropriate location for acquisition. LSAs may reach a critical level of public exposure, and require considerate re-directing away from a nearby civilian population. Evaluation and exploitation of the threat is critical. Sedatives, depending upon availability, are also a viable option. In almost all cases, total neutralisation of the threat should always be considered.
> 
> Dimensional threats are those that may involve a spatial or temporal alteration, space-time rupture, trans-dimensional entities, incorporeal objects, separate dimensional existences, or objects primarily un-constricted by natural laws and processes. Methods of securing include luring, such as the practice used on SCP-106, or reality-anchorage; the process in which reality anchors will merge dimensions, reducing, removing or halting the effects of a trans-dimensional entity, and merging the spatial existence of general dimensional anomalies. Dimensional threats are more often than not lost during a breach if not immediately prioritised, and at times are expendable. These threats are seen as being a damaging combination of complexity and severity, and require extensive background knowledge before intervening.
> 
> Non-Terminable Threats (NTTs) are defined by an inability to be terminated, and as such neutralisation is never an appropriate option. Escapes involving NTTs are complicated and require extensive evaluation before action while still accounting for maximum speed of response. Breaches involving that of SCP-096, suggest a docile state can be achieved if effectively dealt with. Converting a NTT into a docile state allows for a fast and clean acquisition. Methods include sedation, allowing the entity to achieve purpose (with relative consideration, if a purpose is required at all), manipulation, hypnosis, or other object-specific actions.
> 
> Memetic, infohazardous or cognitohazardous threats often meet the requirements for a well-evaluated and assessed plan of action with little account for response speed. Memetic objects may need handling from sensually-inept personnel invulnerable to the danger of viewing, hearing, or touching. By definition, these effects can spread if not well-contained and isolated from site staff unaware of the object. Mediums of transferring these memetic effects into a civilian population must also be removed where necessary and well-considered beforehand.
> 
> Contamination sources must be acted upon swiftly and resourcefully. Most teams will divide into separate roles, preventing the spreading of the contagion while also suppressing the initial source. These may include re-animated organisms, self-sustaining reactions, contagious/harmful entities or objects, anomalous infectious diseases, sources of anomalous toxins, carcinogens, ionised radiation, biological weapons or fungal species. Appropriate hazardous-materials suits should be worn corresponding with the apparent threat(s). Although the role of MTFs is in suppression and isolation of the source and affected areas from civilian populations, quarantining of contagious persons and re-containment of the initial source is a responsibility of the object-movement teams. Threats such as these must be dealt with through exact meticulous and remorseless action in remaining ahead of the risks involved.
