title:Foundation Meetups
Hello! Welcome to the Foundation meetup page. Now you may be wondering, "Roget, you dashing rouge, what's this all about then?" Well thank you, anonymous person, I will tell you what this is all about. Basically, it's a place where you can organize meeting, greeting, and other activities with other people on the site in //real life//. Whether it's a convention, or a concert, or a meetup specifically designed for the Foundation, You can give your fellow Foundationeers the heads up It's a place where if lets say, Bland, was going to a music event, he could post something like this(**Note:Do not actually post like this**):

> "I'll be at Burning Flipside which has nothing do with the Foundation, but, eh!"

And you could post

> "That's so cool! I am also going, and perhaps I could meet you and some other Foundationists!"

Alright so now that you know what it is, here is how we are going to do it. Since Wikidot has nothing in the way of calenders, I have devised an alternative. Lets say you are planning to go to....Genericon. You would create an event on the page like this:

||~ Event||~ When||~ Where ||~ Who is going||||||||~ Comments||
|| Genericon || The date of this event, and how long it goes on|| name of venue and specific address || If you organized the event, put your name here and put "organizer. If you are going, just put your name. |||||||| -that sounds like fun, I will go. ~Rosen  _
-I may be able to go. maybe. ~Taylor _
-Y'all love a good pie? ~TroyL||

And there you have it. Put any events you may want to organize below. I hope this page brings many a Foundationer together for some awesome times.

~Roget
