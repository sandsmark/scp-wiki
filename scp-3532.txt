**Item #:** SCP-3532

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation webcrawlers are to monitor popular social media platforms for activity from SCP-3532. Any activity is to be recorded, scanned for cognitohazards, and archived. Foundation personnel are forbidden interaction with social media accounts associated with SCP-3532 unless otherwise ordered. In accordance with Procedure 24-Lehonot, information damaging to the public image of SCP-3532 is to be produced wherever and whenever applicable. In the event that Procedure 24-Lehonot were to be rendered ineffective, all platforms hosting active SCP-3532 accounts are to be taken offline or otherwise rendered inaccessible until containment can be reestablished.

**Description:** SCP-3532 is believed to be an entity previously worshipped as a deity at an indeterminate point in the past. Currently, SCP-3532 is known to the pubic as ███████ █████████, a popular social media advertiser and influencer. SCP-3532 currently prioritizes the growth its cult-like following known as "The Miraculous Church Gang"[[footnote]]//Hereby referred to as GOI-3532-1.//[[/footnote]], using its social media presence to do so. SCP-3532 has displayed knowledge in the creation of cognitohazardous imagery. Testing has shown that the cognitohazards employed by SCP-3532 do not force the observer to perform an action, instead only acting as strong suggestion. Further testing indicates that a negative perception of SCP-3532 can counteract the cognitohazardous effects.[[footnote]]//See Addendum B.//[[/footnote]]

SCP-3532 was discovered on 1/19/18, when several mp4 files containing level 2 cognitohazarous patterns were detected by Foundation webcrawlers. The files were uploaded to the Instagram and Twitter social platforms by accounts belonging to SCP-3532, and featured the entity advertising products from [REDACTED], as well as GOI-3532-1 branded merchandise. The cognitohazards found in the files would compel humans aged approximately 12 to 25 to both purchase the featured products and follow the several social media accounts of SCP-3532. At the time of discovery, there were no other viewable posts on either accounts.

Investigations into SCP-3532 owned accounts revealed a number of deleted posts made prior to 1/19/18, with the earliest being dated 11/28/17. Said posts differ from the more recent posts and indicate a lack of understanding on how social media operates. In these posts SCP-3532 appears to beg for followers on its accounts and ponders why other users have more followers on their accounts.

The sudden shift in post coherency is likely due to SCP-3532 acquiring representation from social media managing company ████ Marketing[[footnote]]//Hereby referred to as GOI-3532-2.//[[/footnote]] on 1/3/18. Due to the ages of many staff members of GOI-3532-2 falling within the range of the cognitohazards previously employed by SCP-3532, it is presumed that the entity utilized similar cognitohazardous effects to acquire representation. Upon receiving representation, most of the posts uploaded to SCP-3532 accounts were made by GOI-3532-2 employee Mark █████[[footnote]]//Hereby referred to as POI-3532-1.//[[/footnote]], a 22 year old mass communications major and "Miraculous High Priest"[[footnote]]//Job description as listed in Recovered Document 3532 24a. See Addendum A.//[[/footnote]], which accounts for the increase in post coherency.

As of 4/5/18, SCP-3532 has secured advertising deals with ██ major brands. It does not appear that SCP-3532 used its cognitohazardous effects to secure these deals, rather it seems that these companies reached out to SCP-3532 on their own accord due to the entity's popularity.

**Addendum A:** On 13/5/18, a detachment of MTF Phi-1 ("Hostile Takeover") infiltrated the main offices of GOI-3532-2 in order to acquire documentation concerning SCP-3532. A notable document[[footnote]]//Designated 'Recovered Document 3532 24a'.//[[/footnote]] acquired in the raid was a pdf file of GOI-3532-2's contract with SCP-3532. The document shows that GOI-3532-2 was under near complete control of SCP-3532. Cross referencing Recovered Document 3532 24a with other recovered contracts shows a number of deviations, such as the term "client" being replaced with "Miraculous Being" and, as previously mentioned, "manager" replaced by "Miraculous High Priest". Other notable aspects include a clause that states the contract can only be altered by SCP-3532 and no other persons, as well as a separate clause stating that GOI-3532-2 reserves the right to retract representation for clients deemed unprofitable or harmful to the image of the company[[footnote]]//While this clause is not unique to Recovered Document 3532 24a, its inclusion allowed for current containment procedures and Procedure 24-Lehonot to be established.//[[/footnote]]. Due to the concern that SCP-3532 could easily influence other companies in a similar manor, Procedure 24-Lehonot was drafted in order to suppress the entity's influence. Procedure approved on 20/5/18.

**Addendum B:** On 21/5/18, Procedure 24-Lehonot was enacted. A detachment of MTF Phi-1 that had previously infiltrated GOI-3532-2 was tasked with replacing key members of GOI-3532-2 upper management with Foundation agents in order to gain control of the company. Once the company was successfully under Foundation influence, POI-3532-1 was replaced with Dr. Jeffery Burr, who assumed the role of manager for SCP-3532. Dr. Burr then made contact with SCP-3532 and attempted to alter the entity's social media persona to one that would be seen as undesirable.

> Hello Lord ███████,
> I've noticed as of late that your posts aren't getting as much attention as they were before. I'm afraid that your current posts are not being perceived as "cool" or "hip". If these patterns continue, your numbers will fall, just like they have been for the past month. With your permission, of course, I'd like to make a few changes to your image that will ensure that you remain "groovy!" as your age demographic would say. You can read them in the enclosed file below.

All further attempts to persuade SCP-3532 into altering its persona failed. At this point is was determined that SCP-3532 could only be influenced by someone it perceived as having a better understanding of social media. In order to successfully alter the online persona of SCP-3532, Site-72 allowed 3532 personnel to use the social media accounts of [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3331| SCP-3331-Alpha]]] to contact SCP-3532. Dr. Burr was instructed to contact SCP-3532 posing as SCP-3331-Alpha and alter the entity's perceptions of current social trends.

Following the dialogue, SCP-3532 instructed Dr. Burr to follow the advice from the SCP-3331-Alpha account regarding the social media accounts, to which Dr. Burr complied. Within two months, the number of visitors to SCP-3532 run accounts had dropped by 95%. At this point, GOI-3532-2 retracted its representation SCP-3532 in accordance with the company's contract. Following this, SCP-3532 attempted to contact other social media managing companies seeking representation but to no avail. On of 7/18/18, SCP-3532 made one final post to all of its accounts, reading "i just wanted followers againn" before deleting its accounts shortly after. No new posts or accounts have been observed since.
