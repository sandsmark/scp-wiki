**Item #:** SCP-582

**Object Class:** Euclid (Keter classification pending)

**Special Containment Procedures:** There is currently no feasible method to contain SCP-582 within the Foundation. All preventative measures against SCP-582 are to be handled by Special Intelligence Team “Bump in the Night” (Security Chief special order 817-2: ██/██/████). No personnel outside the Special Intelligence Team are permitted to view any materials related to SCP-582 without the permission of a Level 4 security officer. All members of the Special Intelligence Team are to undergo weekly psychological screening.

All major Internet search engines are to be monitored for any references to SCP-582 under the pseudonyms of “Bundle”, “████ ████”, “█████████”, “The ███ ████ of █████”, or [DATA REDACTED]. All sources of artistic, photographic, video, and written data involving SCP-582 are to be destroyed. Individuals responsible for the creation of such data are to be dealt with accordingly, as per Document 582-RP.

Individuals undergoing direct interaction with SCP-582 are to be monitored by Foundation agents at all times. Further interference is only permitted in cases of [DATA EXPUNGED], in order to maintain Foundation security and secrecy. 

**Description:** SCP-582 is an adaptive, self-propagating memetic entity capable of both physical manifestation and passive reality modification. These abilities are not controlled by the entity itself, but by outside stimuli.


SCP-582’s existence is defined by the creation of a narrative account involving it. That is, a fictional account will, by virtue of SCP-582’s reality-shaping abilities, become a factual account of a manifestation of SCP-582. All additional details of the narrative will exist within reality and are cumulative, often overlapping with or connecting to separate manifestations. If no specific date or place is given, SCP-582 will manifest at the first time that meets the criteria of the narrative.  

SCP-582’s effect is not limited to written narrative, as other forms of media have been shown to generate manifestations as well. Photographic manipulations have been shown to be just as effective as written accounts, while artistic representation will only result in a manifestation in ██% of cases. Video evidence is rare, but considered to generate the most powerful effect due to the inherent first-person perspective.

It should be noted that first-person narrative is incredibly high-risk, as it will most often create a cyclical effect between the creator and SCP-582, which will lead to direct contact with the entity. However, such a cycle will only occur when the narrative is from the creator’s point of view: a first-person account written from the perspective of another individual will have an effect no different than a standard account. Of the cyclical first-person accounts recovered, both written and video, ██.█% resulted in either the death or disappearance of the subject, and all resulted in eventual mental breakdown. 

Accounts seen to contradict prior characterization will have no effect. Due to the large amount of media devoted to SCP-582 before the Foundation became aware of its existence, the entity has a set, if generalized, nature.

SCP-582’s physical description and actions vary by source. Most sources describe the entity as humanoid and of indeterminate gender, appearing as an indistinct figure in visual media. A common depiction of SCP-582 has the entity wearing several layers of heavy clothing, even in high temperatures, as well as carrying one or more sacks or bags on its person. The contents of these are unknown. SCP-582 is commonly seen at or near the sites of unexplained murders or disappearances, but is rarely seen actively participating in these due to the secondhand nature of many of the narratives. However, as of ██/██/20██, [REDACTED] deaths have been attributed to SCP-582, as well as ███ other sightings and manifestations.

The origin of SCP-582 can be traced to the urban legend of “Bundle”, which first began circulating on the Internet in the spring of 200█. “Bundle” had amassed a small but devoted following before discovery by the Foundation, and said following had devoted numerous blogs, short story collections, photograph manipulations, and other projects to SCP-582 as a sort of collective mythos, centered around the website [DATA EXPUNGED]. The majority of these materials have been recovered by the Foundation, allowing a history of SCP-582’s major manifestations to be compiled (See Document 582-UU). 

**Addendum 1:** Several recovered narratives introduce additional entities with seeming connections to the “Bundle” character. It is unknown whether these secondary entities become independent after manifestation through SCP-582’s effect. Further study required.

**Addendum 2:** ██/██/20██ - Operation “Rabbit Hole” authorized. Select members of the Special Intelligence Team assigned to SCP-582 have begun an attempt to lure SCP-582 into Foundation control via a series of short “Bundle Stories”. No success as of yet. Request to use a first-person narrative has been submitted and is awaiting O5 approval.

**Addendum 3:** ██/██/20██ – Evidence gathered from recent manifestations of SCP-582 seems to indicate that it has become complex enough to act without an outside narrative. Request to upgrade to Keter class submitted and awaiting approval.
