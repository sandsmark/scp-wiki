**Item #:** SCP-582

**Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** There is currently no way of fully containing SCP-582 within the Foundation. Temporary containment may be achieved by means of a “Bundle Story”, a written narrative detailing SCP-582’s containment within the Foundation. While controlled, it is to be kept in a standard sealed 3 x 3 x 3m containment unit. This unit is to remain empty, with the exception of a reproduction of the painting [REDACTED]. This is to be used as a specifying detail in all “Bundle Stories”.

All preventative measures against SCP-582 are to be handled by Special Intelligence Team “Bump in the Night” (Security Chief special order 817-2: ██/██/████). No personnel outside the Special Intelligence Team are permitted to view any materials related to SCP-582 without permission of a Level 4 personnel.

All major Internet search engines are to be monitored for any references to SCP-582 under the pseudonyms of “Bundle”, “████ ████”, “█████████”, “The ███ ████ of █████”, or [DATA REDACTED]. All sources of artistic, photographic, video, and written data involving SCP-582 are to be destroyed. Individuals responsible for the creation of such data are to be dealt with accordingly, as per Document 582-RP.

In the case of a breach, a new containment document is to be written within 3 hours.

**Description:** SCP-582 is an adaptive, self-propagating memetic capable of physical manifestation. When manifested, this entity has few consistant details, as its description varies by source. Primarily, it is depicted as a humanoid of unknown gender and generally indistinct appearance, wearing several layers of heavy clothing, even in hot climates. In addition, it is commonly described as carrying numerous large burlap sacks.  Variants of this description exist, as well as several alternate descriptions. While contained, SCP-582 will exist only as an ill-defined, shadowy humanoid. 

SCP-582’s primary ability is passive reality modification. Any fictional account written about SCP-582 will become a facutal record of a manifestation of the entity, in which SCP-582 will carry out all actions attributed to it in the narrative. These manifestations will take place at whatever time and place is specified: if no specific location or time is given, the manifestation will occur at any opprotunity that will meet the narrative’s criteria.

Details attributed to SCP-582 are permanent and culminative. If a narrative contains descriptions that contradict previously established details, it will have no effect upon SCP-582. Through this effect, SCP-582 has a consistant, if generalized, portrayal, due to its existance as an Internet urban legend before discovery by the Foundation (See Addendum 1).

SCP-582 is primarily portrayed as the cause of mysterious or unexplained deaths and dissipearances, but rarely as an active participant. The more common format of story involves the aftermath of a manifestation of SCP-582, and features few details of SCP-582’s actual abilites. Within narrative, SCP-582 is trans-dimensional, capable of appearing or dissipearing at any place or time. The entity will cause extreme paranoia in individuals who encounter it, often culminating in complete mental breakdown. No method of terminating or otherwise harming SCP-582 within narrative has been sucessful. 

**Addendum 1:** The origin of SCP-582 can be traced to the urban legend of “Bundle”, which first began circulating the Internet in the spring of 200█. “Bundle” had amassed a small but devoted following before discovery by the Foundation, and said following had devoted numerous blogs, short story collections, photograph manipulations, and other projects to SCP-582 as a sort of collective mythos, centered around the website [DATA EXPUNGED]. The majority of these materials have been recovered by the Foundation, allowing a history of SCP-582’s major manifestations to be compiled (See Document 582-UU). 

**Addendum 2:** Several recovered narratives introduce additional entities with seeming connections to the “Bundle” character. It is unknown whether these secondary entities become independent after manifestation through SCP-582’s effect. Further study required.

//All personnel, please note: SCP-582 is a memetic reaction. It has shown no signs of actual consciousness or free will. Everything it has ever said, done, or thought is because someone wrote that it would. That said, I still don’t think we should introduce Fred to it any time soon.// -Dr. ██████
