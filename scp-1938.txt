**Item #:** SCP-1938

**Object Class:** Safe 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1938 should be held in a standard Safe object containment cell. The cell is to be sealed in such a way as to prevent water from being introduced into the cell. No aquatic life apart from SCP-1938-1 should be placed into SCP-1938.

**Description:** SCP-1938 is an aquarium, capable of holding up to 450 liters of water. It appears to be filled with water and to contain a filter, thermometer, a layer of pebbles at the bottom, and large pieces of coral. In addition, various aquatic organisms (hereafter referred to as SCP-1938-1) have been noted to materialize inside the tank. These fish do not match any known terrestrial species of marine life. Instances of SCP-1938-1 will disappear if SCP-1938 is drained of water. Behavior patterns of SCP-1938-1 resemble those of //Botia macracantha//.

Additionally, if any adolescent person (hereafter referred to as "the user") submerges any portion of their body into SCP-1938, they will appear to vanish for approximately fifteen minutes, after which they will re-appear in a spot within 15 meters of their original location. Users will report that they were teleported into SCP-1938 in the form of a small fish, and that they were in a feudal-style underwater civilization populated by instances of SCP-1938-1. This civilization is usually described as having characteristics similar to the traditional interpretation of a "Utopia", with every instance of SCP-1938-1 reporting great satisfaction with their life and an eagerness to positively interact with the user. The time the user perceives having spent in SCP-1938 ranges from 2 hours to one week. Note that SCP-1938-1's behavior does not reflect the observations of the user during this time.

Of particular note are several interactions where instances of SCP-1938-1 have inquired after Foundation personnel under the effects of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1839 SCP-1839]. It is unknown where or through what means the instances of SCP-1938-1 acquired their knowledge, and further investigation is recommended to ensure containment of both anomalies is properly maintained.

If any species of fish that are not instances of SCP-1938-1 are introduced into the tank, all instances of SCP-1938-1 will immediately change into copies of this introduced species. These new organisms (hereafter referred to as SCP-1938-2) will behave in a much more erratic manner than instances of SCP-1938-1, but apart from behavior and appearance, they share the properties of SCP-1938-1.

However, if the user attempts to use SCP-1938 while it is populated by SCP-1938-2, they will have a different experience. Users will report that they found themselves in an area described as similar to the location found when using SCP-1938-1, but in a state of severe instability. This area will be populated by instances of SCP-1938-2, which are invariably hostile towards the user. In addition, users will report that their experiences in SCP-1938 last for an extended amount of time, with the longest reported being approximately ████ days. Note that no matter what users experience during this time, they will not sustain any injuries.

**Addendum:** This note was recovered with SCP-1938.
