I suppose we should just get to the articles now. Wait, you were expecting a gimmick? Uh, I'm not sure... Do you want a collapsible?

No, that's boring... What about some **bold text?** Or even some //italic text?// Or even **//both at once!//**

Nah? That's boring too? I really have to learn more about Syntax and CSS... But hey, at least you get a rhyming title, that's cool, right?[[footnote]]I would totally make my author page cooler, but I'm not that smart when it comes to all those fancy coding thingamajigs.[[/footnote]]

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/s-c-plastics-actually-does-their-job S&C Plastics Actually Does Their Job] was my very first article on the wiki, and as of now, my most successful. I came up with the idea when I was looking through the S&C Plastics Hub, and I realized something: None of the Foundation's cover-up businesses have anything written about the actual cover-up. So, I wrote this. Honestly, Pop's powers were only introduced because I was too lazy to research actual machines used in the plastics business, but it all worked out in the end!

------

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-apple-doesn-t-fall-far The Apple Doesn't Fall Far] was my second article, this time in the Dread & Circuses Canon. Originally, I was going to have my first tale be this, but I decided I should get a bit more experience before contributing to one of my favorite Canons on the site (Well, actually I like S&C Plastics as much as D&C).

Anyways, I was looking through the hub, and I realized that nobody had ever talked about The Cookhouse of the Circus. So, I took the opportunity to create something new. I wanted to make the story a bit lighthearted, with a touch of darkness, so I came up with the plan that Raymond, the more openly mischievous cook of the pair, would create a helper. I couldn't figure out what it would be though, so I was thinking and thinking and thinking, but then I saw it. That's right folks, the Apples to Apples, uh, apples, were the inspiration for Appie.

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/starlow-grocery Starlow Grocery] and [http://www.scp-wiki.net/there-s-a-job-for-everyone There's a Job For Everyone] were my next two articles. For some reason, I really wanted to make a grocery store for Sloth's Pit, as it seemed like it could be a fun little adventure. As this grocery store evolved, I decided to add Com, who's a play on words for the word 'intercom,' since he's a speaker (kind of). So, what was supposed to be a wacky short adventure changed into a wholesome, character-interaction based story. Then I came up with The Stocker. The Stocker inspired me to create other 'Workers,' such as The Janitor.

I was having a blast. However, Ihp (the god himself), gave me a bit of feedback that made me change how I did things. The tone shifted a bit, and he informed me that perhaps I should turn this into a series. Originally, I was a bit 'eh' about that idea. Then I came up with all the awesome backstory, and Starlow Grocery went from one long tale to a series! 

------

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-midnight-students The Midnight Students (A Totally Normal Band)] was my first [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/the-midnight-students International GOI Contest entry]. I honestly had a lot of fun writing this, and as some people said, it felt like I was writing some kind of cartoon or superhero comic. It was also pretty fun to come up with a new MTF and create the symbol. Originally, I was going to name them 'The Silencers,' but that name was already taken, and I had already made the Foundation's nickname that. So, I looked up synonyms for silence, and there it was. 'Dead Air.' And man, I love that MTF name!

------

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-ide SCP-ide] was based on a little tiny joke made in the SCP Declassified Discord that quickly turned into a real thing. Honestly, I was cackling like a madman the whole time I was writing this. It took me about 45 minutes to write, and I got enough critique to post it by the end of the day, which made me confident that I'd be able to perform well in JamCon2019. 

Keep in mind, in order to make some jokes work, this is a bit of an Alternate Universe Foundation, where the CI is just about eradicated and the Foundation lacks funds and happiness. I was originally going to make a joke that too many employees were following the 'SCP Procedure' in improper conditions, but that seemed far too dark and I really couldn't find a way to slip it in. Anyways, I'm surprisingly proud of this.

------

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/not-the-foundation-fight-club (Not The) Foundation Fight Club!] was my JamCon 2019 Round One entry for the theme 'Shaggy Dog.' I used my SCP-ide characters because I kinda wanted to do some more with them. Originaly, I was going to have a short sparring match between Sadie and Alexander, but that evolved into them hosting a fighting tournament, and it all spun out of control from there.

------

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-cottonmouth-rescues-her-darling The Cottonmouth Rescues Her Darling
] was my JamCon 2019 Round Two entry for the theme 'Pulp Fiction.' Honestly, I didn't really know what to do with this theme, //until// I saw the wikipedia entry for 'Pulp Magazines,' and I read about some of the main characters. I think I managed to stick to the theme while not being too... Bad...

------

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-bed-salesman The Bed Salesman: A Brief Interlude] was my JamCon 2019 Round Three entry for the theme 'So it was all a dream…' This tale takes place in my S&C Plastics series, 'The Link Between Workers,' and I'm honestly pretty pleased with how this turned out. Originally, The Bed Salesman was supposed to be a one-off joke character, but it was pretty fun to flesh them out a little, while also offering a bit of information on how The Union finds potential Workers. 

I've always asked myself, 'What if my life is just on a schedule, with every event planed out in advance?' Well, The Bed Salesman is the embodiment of that. Just waiting for things to happen. Perhaps I'll do more with him in the future. Or someone else can write about him, //wink!//

------

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-many-business-ventures-of-s-c-plastics The Many Business Ventures of S&C Plastics] was my JamCon 2019 Round Three entry for the theme 'So it was all a dream…' W-- wait! Two of them!? Yep, I got insanely bored, so I decided to write this little humorous idea I had. This tale was based on a dream I actually had where I had to complete a random goal in a certain amount of time, but I would always be a few seconds short. 

Plus, I wanted to write more Pop. Pop is the best charachter I've ever made, change my mind. Okay, maybe not... I love all of my characters equally, actually! For the most part. //Sigh.// Anyways, this had been my S&C... There's no synonyms for commentary that start with a P... Eh, y'all are probably sick of that joke anyways.

> **Round 4: Ellie3**

> My daily cravings had hit me again, this time at the mall. Luckily, there was a small candy stand. Usually overpriced, but it would work.
> 
> “Gimme half a pound of these little... erm”
> 
>  “Yes ma’am, sorry about the misspelling on the sign for those, I’ve been meaning to print out a new one” the man behind the counter bagged up the multicolored, sweet, tasty little treats. Perhaps I was letting my cravings get to me. 
> 
>  I slammed five dollars down on the table and ran off with the goods before he could say any more, letting him keep the fifty cents of change. Finally, my hunger would be sated. Tearing the top off of the bag, I shoved a handful into my mouth. I had just swallowed a few before the bitter taste hit me. Disgusted, I spit them into a trash can, throwing the rest of the bag in after them. 
> 
> //Perhaps they were actually just supposed to be sour,// I thought as I walked off and started my car, driving away from the mall. //Yes, that might have been another reason they needed a new sign.//
>  
> Suddenly, there was a burning pain in my chest. I pulled the car over and slammed on the breaks, clutching my stomach. It felt like my stomach was going to explode, almost like it was leaking. The torture intensified, and my vision went white with pain.
> 
> And then I died.
