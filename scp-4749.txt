**Special Containment Procedures:** The Northrop Hotel has been purchased by the Foundation with all employee positions operated by undercover Foundation agents. --The men's restroom of the second floor is to be closed off to the public and locked up citing sanitary issues as the reasoning. No other containment procedures are necessary.--

UPDATE: The men's restroom of the second floor has been sealed off with concrete in a new segment of the wall taking the restroom door's place (//See Addendum 4749.02 for more information//). Personnel are to ignore any sounds or noises that may emanate from the wall. Personnel are to remain observant of any unusual vermin, large holes, and foul-smelling odors and report these to the HMCL supervisor.

**Description:** SCP-4749 refers to an enMotion[[footnote]]A brand that specializes in cleaning products and a subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific LLC; a company that specializes in the manufacturing and distribution of toilet and tissue paper, chemical products, and towel dispensers.[[/footnote]] brand paper towel dispenser located in the men's restroom on the second floor of the Northrop Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. The primary anomalous property of SCP-4749 manifests as a seemingly infinite amount of paper towels. Sheets removed from SCP-4749 are non-anomalous and do not appear to have any other function other than to dry human hands.

SCP-4749's secondary anomalous property is the effect that occurs in its environment when the towel sheets are pulled. When pulled, the restroom will simultaneously begin to degrade in condition depending on the amount of paper towels removed. As the restroom's form distorts, organisms and pests such as rats, cockroaches, and worms manifest. These animals are also affected by SCP-4749 as the entities begin to distort into grotesque and malformed creatures bearing little to no resemblance of their original forms[[footnote]]The only exclusion to this affliction is the entity pulling the paper towels. Why this only affects the immediate environment and all the vermian entities produced and present is not fully understood.[[/footnote]]. --This effect, can be reversed by rolling the paper towel roll back in its place, causing all deterioration within the restroom to gradually disappear[[footnote]]Vermin present during this sanativic process will also be reversed to their original forms and vacate the restroom by crawling into any holes or openings that may still be present nearby.[[/footnote]], bringing the restroom to its original quality.-- Further description pending.

**Exploration Video Log Transcript**

**Subject:** D-22222

**Target:** SCP-4749

**Location:** Second Floor, Northrop Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada

**Equipment:** One body camera with microphone attachment and earpiece device
-----

**[BEGIN LOG]**

**Command:** Step inside the room, please.

//D-22222 opens the door to the restroom and walks in.//

**Command:** Please proceed to the paper towel dispenser on your left.

//D-22222 walks over to SCP-4749. He starts to look at himself in the mirror of the restroom; presumably to check for hidden cameras.//

**Command:** Please pull.

**D-22222:** The paper towels? That's it?

**Command:** That's it.

//D-22222 grabs the paper towel and rips it out. The restroom mirror suddenly cracks.//

**D-22222:** Jesus! What the hell was that!?

**Command:** Just keep pulling.

//D-22222 complies and begins counting as he slowly pulls on the paper towels. The restroom slowly begins distorting: the lights start to dull and flicker, tiles begin to fall off, urinals and toilets start to leak, and the mirror's cracks start growing.//

**D-22222:** Is... is this actually happening?

**Command:** D-2, how many paper towels have you pulled?

**D-22222:** I don't know, 12?

**Command:** Pull faster.

//D-22222 continues pulling on the towels as the room begins to deteriorate. The mirror is now stained with oxidation and cracks, the walls now bleed from the crevices in the tiles as they fall, the wallpaper and ceiling paint starts bubbling and peeling off, and audible gurgling noises can be heard from the faucet sink. Suddenly, D-22222 jerks forward.//

**Command:** What is it?

**D-22222:** ...shit.

//D-22222 looks over and there appears to be a large puddle of brown liquid touching the back of his shoes. Worms can be seen floating and writhing in the puddle. D-22222 looks up and it appears that the fluid is leaking from the toilet stalls. D-22222 begins coughing and gagging; presumably at the smell coming from the puddle.//

**D-22222:** Jesus Fucking Christ. Can I- (pauses) Can- (pauses) Can I stop? Can I- (coughs) Fucking shit. It's all over the fucking place, man. There's fucking worms in here! There's- (retches).

**Command:** Alright, push the towel roll back.

**D-22222:** (coughs) ...what? You want me to do what?

**Command:** Push the roll inside the dispenser.

**D-22222:** Wh- What? Why? How- How does that help?

**Command:** Push the roll back. Now.

//D-22222 begins to push the roll back slowly. As he does this, the brown fluid and blood on the walls reverses back, the remaining residue left behind dries up and disintegrates, the cracks and oxidation on the mirror is restored, and the lights start growing brighter until the room is now clean and devoid of any smell. D-22222 looks around in confusion.//

**D-22222:** ...what the hell was that? What was that?

**Command:** D-2, step outside for debriefing. This experiment is over.

**Exploration Video Log Transcript**

**Subject:** D-22222

**Target:** SCP-4749

**Location:** Second Floor, Northrop Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada

**Equipment:** One body camera with microphone attachment and earpiece device
-----

**[BEGIN LOG]**

**Command:** Step inside the room and pull on the paper towels in the dispenser.

//D-22222 is hesitant at first but complies with the demand. He proceeds to slowly pull on the sheets causing the restroom to break down and deform itself.//

**D-22222:** So how long do I have to keep doing this?

**Command:** Until I tell you to stop.

//D-22222 groans and sighs heavily into his microphone as he continues to pull. The restroom begins to degrade as wallpaper peels and the toilets start leaking the brown fluid again. The mirror oxidizes immediately and cracks. The crevices in the tiles start leaking blood. One of the tiles on the far left corner falls to the ground.//

**Command:** D-2, how many paper towels have you pulled?

**D-22222:** Um... 50.

**Command:** I see. Do you see the tile that just fell on the floor there?

**D-22222:** Yeah, why?

**Command:** Walk over to the area.

//D-22222 approaches the wall with the missing tile. There appears to be a mass of organic matter in the place of the tile.//

**D-22222:** Jesus... what the hell is this?

**Command:** Can you describe it?

**D-22222:** It- It looks like- like flesh or muscle tissue. Dilating, living flesh. //Ugh.//

//A cockroach flies past D-22222 as he recoils in disgust.//

**Command:** Alright. Go back to the dispenser.

//D-22222 goes back to SCP-4749 and starts pulling again. The restroom's interior proceeds to worsen as more tiles start falling out with the crevices bleeding profusely. Rats begin to swarm the urinals and the cockroaches start crawling out of the faucet sinks.//

**D-22222:** Please man, can I get out of here now? It's- (pauses) I- Please? It's really bad in here, man (coughs). Smells like- like- (retches). I've been holding my breath the whole time and- (retches).

**Command:** How many?

**D-22222:** Wh- What?

**Command:** How many have you pulled?

**D-22222:** 97.

**Command:** Alright, I think- (static) that's enough. Push- (static) the roll back now.

//D-22222 pushes the roll back but no change is observed.//

**D-22222:** ...uh.

//D-22222 pushes the towel roll back faster. Nothing happens.//

**D-22222:** It's not- (coughs) not working anymore.

**Command:** Did you touch some- (static) thing? Did you break anything inside?

**D-22222:** No way. I just did what you said and- and- (retches) it just- (pauses) it isn't fucking working!

**Command:** Okay, just- (static) just get out of there.

//D-22222 attempts to open the door but it doesn't open. D-22222 continues to twist the knob left and right as well as pushing and pulling the door in an attempt to open it. D-22222's breathing gets more labored as he starts cursing and hitting the door.//

**D-22222:** Fuck! I'm stuck! Get me out of here! Please!

**Command:** Calm down. We're trying to open the door on the other side. Just stay calm and don't touch anything.

//Containment units outside attempt to open the door using a lockpick set but are unsuccessful. They proceed to use a sledgehammer and a fire axe to break both the door knob and the door itself to no avail.//

**D-22222:** What's going on? I can hear you guys banging on the door. Is it working?

//In that moment, a dark puddle of blood, urine, and fecal matter seeps from the bottom of the door to the outside. The containment unit takes a step back.//

**D-22222:** Help! Help! Somebody help me! Please! Let me out! Please! PLEASE!

**Command:** D-2, we're having t-(static) trouble with the connection. I don't know if you can read us but we- (static) we're having issues trying to secure a connection with you. Remain calm, we're try- (static) ing to fix it. Just hold on.

**D-22222:** What? Fix it faster! I'm knee-deep in (coughs) shit and piss! There's blood and shit everywh- (retches) Oh- (retches) Oh God, fuck-

**Command:** D-2?

//D-22222 lurches forward on his hands and knees in the fluid and begins to vomit for five seconds. The puddle of blood, urine, and feces has grown considerably larger now. Worms and cockroaches are now floating in the liquid.//

**D-22222:** (sobbing frantically) Fuuuuuuck. Somebody pl- (pauses) please help me. Please. Please. Please. Plea-

**[CONNECTION LOST]**

After losing contact with the subject, it was presumed that D-22222 perished inside the room. With no way to access the restroom, it was proposed to close off the restroom from the public until further notice.

Upon closure of the restroom, it was discovered that the logs from D-22222 were saved and ported to Command automatically as part of a protocol in the event that the subject expire or the equipment malfunction. These provided a way to listen to D-22222, however, contact with the subject could not be established. The following transcripts are the moments leading up to the final logs of D-22222.

**Addendum 4749.02:** 08/07/2015 Incident

On August 7th, 2015, Foundation agents reported a foul-smelling odor emanating from the storage room in the third floor kitchen. Upon investigation of the smell, it was discovered that the scent came from a large hole in the corner of the wall. Closer inspection of the hole prompted a massive influx of creatures resembling vermian entities to spawn from the  hole and overwhelm the kitchen and staff in the second and third floors of the hotel. [[[SCP-4310|Mobile Task Force Lambda-12 ("Pest Control")]]] responded and were quickly dispatched to deal with the threat. The invading vermin present appeared to have physical traits and qualities similar to that of rats but grossly misshapen with matted fur and deformed features. Among these was the presence of insectoid legs and antennae, thick segmented tails, and humanlike hands and faces. DNA testing of the creatures revealed a close relation to organisms belonging to the orders of Megadrilacea, Blattodea, Rodentia, and Primates.

During cleanup, one of the creatures had a message carved into its abdomen with a small, sharp piece of a ceramic tile. The message is transcribed below:

Following this, containment procedures have been updated with the original hole sealed off with concrete.
