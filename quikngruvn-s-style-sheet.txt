title:Quikngruvn's Style Sheet
**Work in progress**

This Style Sheet is to help me develop and compile a standard way of formatting stuff for SCP articles. This is by no means an official document, though I'm going to list formats for official terminology that (I hope) are used consistently among SCP articles.

# In a measurement, add a space between the number and the unit (ex., 2 m). Don't add a comma to a compound measurement (ex., 5 ft 10 in). _
Exceptions:
 # Temperature: 20°C
 # Latitude and longitude: 40°N, 85°W
 # Acidity: pH 3.4
 # Caliber: Berretta 9mm
# (Significant digits)
# (Commas)
# (Hyphens)
# (Apostrophes)
# (Capitalization)
