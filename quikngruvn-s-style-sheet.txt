title:Quikngruvn's Style Sheet
**Work in progress**

This Style Sheet is to help me develop and compile a standard way of formatting stuff for SCP articles. This is by no means an official document, though I'm going to list formats for official terminology that (I hope) are used consistently among SCP articles.

# **Measurements:** In a measurement, add a space between the number and the unit (e.g., 2 m). Don't add a comma to a compound measurement (e.g., 5 ft 10 in). Decimal values between -1 and 1 should have a zero in the units place (e.g., 0.4 g). _
__Exceptions__:
 * Temperature: 20°C
 * Latitude and longitude: 40°N, 85°W
 * Acidity: pH 3.4
 * Caliber: Berretta 9mm
# **Significant digits:** Broadly, in a measurement, all digits 1 through 9 as well as 0s between non-zero digits are significant digits (e.g., 12000 kg has two siginificant digits, while 12007 kg has five). The number of significant digits of a measurement is determined by how precisely the measurement can be taken. The number of significant digits should remain constant when a measurement is converted (e.g., 12000 kg = 26000 lb, but 12007 kg = 26415 lb). _
__Rule of thumb__:
 * Rough estimates, ballpark figures, and difficult measurements get one or two significant digits.
 * Standard measurements get three or four digits.
 * Getting five or six digits requires good equipment, and any more would require exponentially better equipment or special circumstances.
 * __Exception__: GPSs can give latitude and longitude to six decimal places, meaning GPS readings routinely give eight or nine significant digits. [confirm]
