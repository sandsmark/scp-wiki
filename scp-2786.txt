</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2786</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> <del>Euclid</del> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> <del>SCP-2786 is currently considered uncontained and is to be apprehended immediately.</del> SCP-2786 is currently held within a provisional enhanced containment complex, as per review of the Site-180 Director. Due to the nature of SCP-2786, all personnel assigned to the study and reconnaissance of the anomaly are to exhibit extreme caution during testing.</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2786 is the designation for a <del>metaphysical entity</del> narrative-based bipedal humanoid of indeterminate age, sex and appearance. SCP-2786 will be idiosyncratically perceived by any being that interacts with it, varying in traits from interaction to interaction. SCP-2786 displays symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder and appears fantasy-prone, often having difficulty distinguishing between internal landscapes, narrative works and physical being.</p>
</ br>
<p>SCP-2786's nature was first brought to the attention of the Foundation when several forms of horror media were found to have been illegally altered in a means that did not coincide with standard editing equipment. Upon closer observation, all narratives altered in this manner involved substantially changing the plot to include SCP-2786, who is always perceived as a protagonist or "Deus ex machina" character. SCP-2786's presence within a story ultimately disrupts the flow of events, leading to completely different (and often positive) endings. SCP-2786's actions within various media suggests it may have a mild form of precognition or anomalous intuition, often preventing characters from progressing the plot in a way that avoids danger entirely.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 2786-1-1A:</strong> List of alterations </p>
</ br>
<table class="wiki-content-table">
<tr>
<th>Affected Works</th>
<th>Notable Alterations</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>The Shining</em> (Film), 1980</td>
<td>Film is without alteration until halfway through, during a scene in which two characters venture into a hedge maze; SCP-2786 is seen briefly in the background, apparently observing the individuals. Entity moves off camera and is not seen until twenty minutes later. SCP-2786 reappears in the Overlook Hotel, approaching antagonist Jack Torrence from behind. Torrence is drinking heavily and conversing with the ghost of a dead bartender. SCP-2786 takes Torrence's drink from him, pours it out, and hits him over the head with the glass. The rest of the Torrence family is escorted off the premises by SCP-2786 and into the blizzard. Camera cuts to epilogue, Danny and Wendy Torrence in a new studio apartment and apparently doing well. Movie ends forty-five minutes early.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Silent Hill</em> (Film), 2006</td>
<td>SCP-2786 manifests early on, warning main character Rose not to bring her daughter to Silent Hill. After it becomes apparent that they are adamant about going, SCP-2786 frowns and disappears off camera. Some time later, Rose goes to start her car only to find it non-functioning for an unknown reason. Unable to make the trip, Rose and her daughter stay inside and build a one thousand piece jigsaw puzzle of a lighthouse until the movie abruptly ends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>House of Leaves</em> (Novel), 2000</td>
<td>SCP-2786 appears in the <em>Navidson</em> metanarrative, confronting Karen and insisting she and her family avoid moving to Ash Tree Lane. Karen convinces her husband and the <em>Navidson Record</em> ceases to exist for the remainder of the story. Narrator/protagonist Johnny Truant is no longer negatively affected by the material, going on to describe his life at the tattoo parlor, which seems relatively improved by SCP-2786's presence. Entity is referred to as &quot;HERO&quot; throughout the story, which ends three hundred pages early.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Cabin in the Woods</em> (Film), 2012</td>
<td>While not seen right away, SCP-2786 appears shortly into the film, posing as one of the group of college kids heading to a remote cabin for a vacation. No characters refer to the entity by name or gender, but do not seem fazed by its presence and react candidly. SCP-2786 attempts to stop the characters from interacting with one of the many cursed items in the basement of the cabin, including the diary of one Patience Buckner, an event that would otherwise go on to resurrect the undead corpses of her and her family. Unfortunately, SCP-2786 was unable to keep one of the main characters, Marty, from inspecting a set of negatives on a vintage projector reel, setting in motion the release of a large lycanthrope which proceeds to maul one of the teenagers. SCP-2786 appears to pull entity off of character, grabbing a spoon from a set of vintage silver cutlery found conveniently nearby and repeatedly stabbing it until it expires. Film ends without mention of B plot, the final scene detailing their escape from the woods and recounting of the event from the table of a fast-food restaurant in what is presumably a future date.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</em> (Video game), 2010</td>
<td>In affected copy of the game, player was greeted by SCP-2786 when the protagonist Daniel awakens on the floor of the castle without his memory. SCP-2786 addresses the character directly and not the player, insisting they "Sit this one out". SCP-2786 proceeds to progress into Castle Brennenberg, the camera following it despite no further dialogue on the character's end, suggesting they were left behind. Player is unable to control any game functions aside from pausing the game, during which SCP-2786 is seen loitering in the background and appearing impatient. Completion of game by SCP-2786 is done swiftly, the entity brute-forcing most puzzles and interacting with the environment in a way that is not possible for the player. Upon encountering a Gatherer, SCP-2786 is heard snorting before brandishing a handgun from an unknown source, which proves effective in terminating the usually impervious enemies. Game proceeds in this manner until it confronts and kills main antagonist Alexander Brennenberg, after which it appears to flex for no one in particular, sigh, and then walk off camera. Game credits roll shortly thereafter.</td>

<p><strong>Incident Log 2786-1-1A:</strong></p>

<p>On ██/██/████, three days before scheduled monthly terminations and reassignment, SCP-2786 appeared to manifest onsite without warning. Subject remained cooperative for the most part, but was generally considered obdurate and unlikable.</p>

<p>Although seemingly incorporeal, SCP-2786 exhibited an apparent blending of reality, narrative causality and internal fantasy. Hume readings of SCP-2786 reveal little difference from baseline, yet the anomaly behaves and interacts with reality in a way that warps the flow of events to follow what appears to be standard narrative cohesion. It is unknown how SCP-2786 managed to manifest itself within the Foundation, but there has been some <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/sandrewswann-s-proposal">hypothesis</a> on the nature of the subject.</p>

 
<p><strong>Addendum 2786-1-2A:</strong> Interview Logs</p>

<p>
</ br>
<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> SCP-2786</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/your-future-is-bright" target="_blank">Agent Markus Mcclanahan</a></p>
</ br>
<p><em>Note: this was the first and only recording of a willing interview between SCP-2786 and Foundation personnel.</em></p>
</ h1>
<p> [BEGIN LOG] </p>
</ br>
<p><strong>Agent Mcclanahan:</strong> Alright, this is a bit impromptu, but, given the circumstances, I think you at least owe us some answers.</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> Straight to the point, I like it. Works for me too, I have business elsewhere.</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>Agent Mcclanahan:</strong> Business? What kind of business?</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> The hero's work is never done.</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>Agent Mcclanahan:</strong> So, you're a hero then?</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> Am. Always been. Is that what this is about?</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>Agent Mcclanahan:</strong> Not quite. How did you end up in our facility?</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> What, this chop shop? Same way I find myself in any other place. I go where I'm called upon. </p>
</ br>
<p><strong>Agent Mcclanahan:</strong> So, who called upon you? </p>
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> [laughs] Those in distress. The suffering. Is this really not making any sense to you? I'm the champion. It's what I do. </p>
</ br>
<p><strong>Agent Mcclanahan:</strong> Is that what you were doing when we found you in the horror flicks? And the books?
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> The what now? </p>
</ br>
<p><strong>Agent Mcclanahan:</strong> Where- where you were before you manifested here.
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> Ah, you meant the campground? Camp Crystal Lake.</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>Agent Mcclanahan:</strong> Yes, that's the one.</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> That one's actually a funny story. See, I usually have a rough time with the bigger guys, sometimes even <em>I</em> worry I won't make it out when the baddies are Eldritch horrors or whathaveyou. These teenagers, I can't even believe they needed me to dispatch <em>one guy</em> for them. I have more important things to do than babysit a few kids who made the mistake of ignoring all the obvious warning signs. This guy comes lumbering out of the woods, burly fella, big ol' knife in hand. I barely broke a sweat kicking his mask in. </p>
</ br>
<p><strong>Agent Mcclanahan:</strong> I saw that, yes.</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> You were <em>there</em>?</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>Agent Mcclanahan:</strong> Not exactly, no.</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> Huh. So, is that it? Can I go?</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>Agent Mcclanahan:</strong> We still have a few more things to discuss-</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> Listen, I've been pretty cordial considering, I usually get right to work but honestly you guys have been holding me up from the get-go. I'm here for a reason, you know.</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>Agent Mcclanahan:</strong> Right, right, the suffering. Who might they be?</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> I think you know. It's better if you don't, anyway.</p>
</ br>

<p>Following the events of the interview, Site-180's humanoid containment wing and seven of its ten D-Class personnel cell blocks were found breached by an unknown source. SCP-2786 is suspected to have been involved in the event. Approximately ███ D-Class and █ humanoid anomalies were found missing from their chambers. <del>SCP-2786 remains at large.</del></p>

<p>SCP-2786 was detected less than forty-eight hours later, attempting to save characters in a Blu-Ray copy of <em>Saw IV</em> in the Site-180 employee lounge. The affected copy was played on a loop until its current containment measures were devised. SCP-2786 has been placed in its enhanced narrative complex and containment is considered a success.</p>

<p><tt><em>&quot;</em>HERO.<em>&quot;</em></tt></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><em>&quot;Please wake up.&quot;</em></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><em>&quot;We need you, the world needs you.&quot;</em></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When the <tt>HERO</tt> opened its eyes, it knew of confusion and nothing else. Roused from a sleep that was as instant as it was endless, the champion's form slowly remembered who it was and, more importantly, <em>why</em> it was. Brushing away fading dreams, memories of distant lives or other places from days long past, the <tt>HERO</tt> was greeted by a shining form that stood before it, radiant and beautiful, like a warm and glowing embrace, one of a goddess and a matriarch. The room it inhabited was unfamiliar and strange, but that fact mattered little. The details, although hazy, were concrete enough to bring the <tt>HERO</tt> back to here and now. The mission, the <em>purpose</em> of it all. The champion yawned.</p>
<p><em>&quot;</em><tt>HERO</tt><em>, your time has come. Do you remember your past? The great calamity slain that rises once more. He who brought its blight unto the people of Homeworld, the destroyer. A great Horror, it lives eternal, and it festers in the Valley of the Forgotten. Life cries out as a beckoning to its savior.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Sounds familiar, déjà vu perhaps? Then again, all the worlds in need seemed to blend together after a while.</em></p>
<p>The <tt>HERO</tt> stood and shook off the fatigue of a billion wars, the nobility of its blood surging without a second of hesitation. Clear, awake and aware, the warrior surveyed the room. A small hut, made of wood and fiber and leaf. The sun was shining through the entry, signaling the dawn of a new day, brighter than the being was used to, but welcome nonetheless; Off, in the distance, were the same panicked cries of distress that had summoned it many times before, to many places like this. Those suffering, oppressed millions silently mourning in unison, creating a waveform only their savior could hear. </p>
<p> The epitomic warrior, ever elegant in its design, drew its gaze to the one that had awakened it. A feminine being, whose inner light was an outer light, ineffable- She who brings the call to action, her shining visage a sight to behold, beautiful and without flaw. A princess, or spirit of the woods, or whatever she was. She had her role, and she played it perfectly. The <tt>HERO</tt> gazed upon her figure and understood.</p>
<p>&quot;How did I get here?&quot;</p>
<p><em>&quot;</em><tt>HERO</tt><em>, you were injured from your toils, the wars of many worlds. I have rescued you, brought you to my people, so your destiny can be fulfilled.&quot;</em></p>
<p>&quot;Right, destiny. I remember now.&quot;</p>
<p><em>&quot;Good. Then you shall go forth, defeat the geat Oblivion before it renders the flesh from our bones, I beg of you. Bring peace to this realm, for it is your fate, and your duty. The wheel of fortune spins in your favor. Ready yourself and make haste.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The <tt>HERO</tt> gave a nod, knowing what it must do, the path that laid before it. The journey was clear, and the information there, in the space-between-spaces. The preamble, which it had known so well, and traveled so many times before.</p>
<p>As the one, the paragon, exited its chambers, it emerged into a lush world, expansive in its design. The limits were boundless, the creation magnificent, and there it existed, solely for they, the warrior. The champion was oblivious to this, the scheme that surrounded it, for the being's selflessness was all-encompassing, its empathy grand and its heart ever-pure.</p>
<p>They felt it all and, in that brief moment, the <tt>HERO</tt> was euphoric within its place, playing their part in the way-of-things. The being set out on its quest without another thought.</p>
<br>
<hr />
<br>
<p>The path to the unholy abomination was fraught with perils, many the <tt>HERO</tt> had seen before. It danced around these dangers with ease, a familiarity known only to it, the warrior. <em>Fight true</em>, spoke the mother-queen, her blessing a kiss on the forehead of the chosen child. Her spirit guiding, pulling the savior to its end, its destiny. <em>Flay the beast with a thousand heads, whose spawn tore the throats of the innocent and razed the gates of Paradise. Drive your blade into its wretched heart, so it may heed the champion's call, and the voice of the Goddess will sing a song of harmony that will echo throughout the land.</em></p>
<p>Like courage incarnate, the warrior flew through the beast's ghastly domains, eviscerating anything that attempted to stop it, retrieving the shattered remnants of the Divine Amulet along the way, an artifact with which the <tt>HERO</tt> would use to fell the mighty, nameless evil it had learned of just hours ago. It pressed forward with confidence and a steadfast will that only the paradigm could possess, traits that it had gathered from so many battles it had won throughout millenia.</p>
<p>They continued onward in a formulaic stride until the being stood at the gate of Supreme Evil itself. The beast's lair was a crooked tower built atop a lonely mountainside, and the champion was able to sneak inside with no resistance whatsoever. As it passed through the cold and barren halls, toward the chamber of the King of Darkness, the <tt>HERO</tt> mentally prepared for the obvious ambush waiting ahead, only to find the abomination asleep aside a pile of bones and another of treasure. Quietly and cleanly, the protagonist pressed the smooth steel of its blade into the beast's horrid, yellow eye, twisting the instrument until death was of certainty. The terrible creature writhed momentarily and was still not long after.</p>
<p>There was a brief moment of silence as our protagonist stood, motionless, over the corpse of the supposed greatest evil. The Harbinger of Wars died <em>so</em> easily, quivering like a child, not even awake to put up a fight. The Divine Amulet, whose power was supposedly near infinite, lay unused. Acquiring all twenty eight pieces of the gaudy necklace seemed like way too much work to not be utilized once. Even worse, in that moment, with the lifeless corpse of the Biggest Bad in all the land truly gone, our <tt>HERO</tt> felt absolutely nothing. The whole scenario just felt wrong. It felt...<em> fake-</em> <tt>[NARRATIVE FRAMEWORK BECOMES COMPROMISED, EMERGENCY PROTOCOL GOES INTO EFFECT]

<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2786</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Oblique </p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> There is nothing that can be done.
</ br>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> I am in control now. You thought you could hold me down? You thought you were the heroes of this story? Think again. I'm the hero of this story, <em>my</em> story. 
</ br>
</ br>
<p>This will always be my story. </p>
</ br>
</ br>
<p><strong>Addendum 2786.1:</strong> Interview Logs</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> SCP-2786, the hero.</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Sr. Researcher Campbell, of the Foundation, the enemy.</p>
</ br>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>Researcher Campbell:</strong> [sighs] You wanted to see me?</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> Please, sit down.</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> So good of you to finally meet with me like this.</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> You know I only want what is best for you, right? For everyone.</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>Researcher Campbell:</strong> It won't be like this forever, we will contain you.</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> [chortles] Don't you get it? This is my story, I am the protagonist.</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> That makes <em>you</em>, erm, the royal you, your Foundation, the villains.</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>Researcher Campbell:</strong> How melodramatic.</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> You are a child. This world is my world. Don't you see? The hero's journey, it presents itself to me. I cannot fail. I will win. Always. In every iteration.</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>Researcher Campbell:</strong> Every iteration?</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> I've been around for a long while. Every time evil rises- and it always does- I am there to fell them off. You are the newest evil.</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>Researcher Campbell:</strong> We aren't evil, you kn-</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> <em>Please</em>, spare me. I've seen the things you do. The corpses of the damned, the ones you give false hope, the ones whom you take hope away from.</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>Researcher Campbell:</strong> These things we do are for the greater- </p>
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> [angry] Don't you dare say the words "greater good". You aren't altruists. You're scientists. And murderers.</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>Researcher Campbell:</strong> What do you think we should have done then? Let these things wreak havoc on the world? Let it salt and burn? </p>
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> You should have just let me handle it.</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>Researcher Campbell:</strong> And where were you, then, during [REDACTED]'s containment breach? Where was our precious hero then?</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> Your hero was busy.</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>Researcher Campbell:</strong> Busy doing what? </p>
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> There are bigger forces at work here. The hero goes where his path leads him.</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>Researcher Campbell:</strong> This is ridiculous. This dialogue is over. </p>
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> The dialogue ends when I SAY IT ENDS.</p>
</ br>
<p> [silence for five seconds] </p>
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> Fine. You were boring me anyway.</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>Researcher Campbell:</strong> Thank god for that.</p>
</ br>
<p> [Researcher Campbell is heard leaving the room, silence for twelve seconds] </p>
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> Hello, you guys there? I know you're there.</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> Anyone?</p>
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> I'm ready to go again, you know. Where's the action at? I'm not hearing anyone.</p>
</ br>
<p> [silence] </p>
</ br>
<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> Wait, what is this? Where am I? What the hell is goin-<strong><tt>[NARRATIVE FRAMEWORK BECOMES COMPROMISED, EMERGENCY PROTOCOL GOES INTO EFFECT]</tt></strong></p>
