I did this for the art contest and submitted it by Gmail, but the judges never got it. Such is life. I still appreciate the motivation to do a painting for what was the first time in ages.

[[collapsible show ="+ You Should Be Seeing More Or Less Normally"]]

The operation from [[[Parts]]]. This is pretty stylized - it should all be clunkier and less colorful, with more struts and stuff holding them upright. The blood would actually leak out like that, though, because my headcanon is metal as fuck.
