__**E-mails Concerning Site 127 Containment Breach:**__
> **From:** ███████ ████████, Head of Ethics Committee
> **To:** Troy Felderman, Site 127 Director
> **Re:** SCP-721-J 
> 
> Could you guys at Site 127 stop sending us that stupid dog picture. I opened my inbox this morning to find 18 different pictures of your site's new cafeteria mural. I shouldn't have to say it but these are not proper requests for ethics review. 
> 
> Additionally, no-one want to see that tattoo on D-6783's [DATA EXPUNGED]. (Was that even consensual? How do you even get a tattoo there?)

> **Re:** SCP-721-J 
> 
> I don't see any problem with my staff's behavior. SCP-721-J is memetic but it's not hazardous. Besides, I talked with Doctor Lloyd Jenkins about it and he feels like he's finally done something successful in his life.

> **To:** Troy Felderman, Site 127 Director
> **Re:** SCP-721-J 
> 
> Firstly, SCP-721-J may not be hazardous but it has become painful to look at.
> 
> Secondly, being successful doesn't mean you deserve it.
> 
> Thirdly, if something is successful, but it also makes the O5 council mad, it isn't actually successful.
> 
> Fourthly, the O5 have voted, image spam of SCP-721-J is to stop immediately.
> 
> Failure of cessation will result in removal of site 127's annual pajama day.

Following the assassination of Troy Felderman, Site 127 descended into an anarchy fueled civil war.

Communication channels were cut, and, as far as the rest of the Foundation was concerned, everything had returned to normal.
