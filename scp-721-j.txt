**Item #:** SCP-721-J

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-721-J-1 has been safely contained at Dr. Lloyd Jenkins' house with an electric shock collar.-- SCP-721-J-1 is to be kept at Doctor Lloyd Jenkins' house at all times. Just never let him leave. And if he does leave never ever let him near another Foundation site. 

**Description:** SCP-721-J is an image of Doctor Lloyd Jenkins' dog, [REDACTED][[footnote]] Name redacted at request of Dr. Lloyd Jenkins to "keep all my passwords safe." [[/footnote]], hereafter SCP-721-J-1 . SCP-721-J is a visual memetic agent that only affects individuals who have seen SCP-721-J-1 in person. The effect causes an individual to customize their personal belongings with SCP-721-J. This includes wall paintings, desktop backgrounds, calendars, mugs, t-shirts, etc. There are currently 9 instances of SCP-721-J in Doctor Lloyd Jenkins' office (not including each separate calendar month). There is no known cure for exposure. 

SCP 721-J first came to the attention of the Foundation in 2014. The image was quite popular among Doctor Lloyd Jenkins' friend group, so he decided to upload it to Ifunny in hopes of becoming an internet sensation. However, nothing remarkable happened. Doctor Lloyd Jenkins subsequently discovered the image's anomalous properties, shifting the blame for his internet failure off of himself.

> **Re:** SCP-721-J 
> 
> Could you guys at Site 127 stop sending us that stupid dog picture. I opened my inbox this morning to find 18 different pictures of your site's new cafeteria mural. I shouldn't have to say it but these are not proper requests for ethics review. 
> 
> Additionally, no-one want to see that tattoo on D-6783's [DATA EXPUNGED]. (Was that even consensual? How do you even get a tattoo there?)

> I don't see any problem with my staff's behavior. SCP-721-J is memetic but it's not hazardous. Besides, I talked with Doctor Lloyd Jenkins about it and he feels like he's finally done something successful in his life.

> P.S. Is it really too expensive for the Foundation to purchase Photoshop? It took me two hours to make that in Gimp 2 and I'm still not satisfied with that O.

Following the assassination of T█████ F████████ Site 127 descended into an anarchy fueled civil war.

Communication channels were cut, and, as far as the rest of the Foundation was concerned, everything had returned to normal.
