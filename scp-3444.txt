**Item #:** SCP-3444

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The town of Nowhere has been comprehensively purchased by the Foundation, and has been converted into Site 90, the headquarters of the Unreality Division. Entrance into and out of Nowhere is prohibited to any civilians.

The use of SCP-3444 for recreational purposes has been approved. Any staff member with Level 2 clearance or higher at Site 90 is permitted to use it up to 2 times per year, with priority given to those suffering from stress, overwork or particular mental health issues.

**Description:** SCP-3444 is a train station located on the outskirts of the town of Nowhere, North Dakota. SCP-3444 contains only a single train-line which, if one approaches from the outside, appears to abruptly end approximately 50m out of SCP-3444 on either side. Both externally and internally, SCP-3444 is decorated in a design reminiscent of a 1920s "Art Deco" style. Several signs throughout the station are emblazoned with the word "NOWHERE"; a small digital monitor is present over the platform, constantly showing the phrase "GOING: ANYWHERE".

SCP-3444 manifests at 12 AM each night; should no human enter it, it will demanifest one hour later. Should a --human-- mammal enter it, a Golden Event will begin; this results in SCP-3444 immediately disappearing to outside observers, before remanifesting at a variable time several hours later[[footnote]] Usually between 90 and 160 minutes later, but events have been known to be as short as 30 minutes and as long as 510 minutes.[[/footnote]].

To the observer within SCP-3444, the Golden Event progresses thusly:

* A 4-8-4 type locomotive[[footnote]] Commonly called a "Northern", this type of train was first used on the Northern Pacific Railway, which ran through North Dakota [[/footnote]] attached to a single 1920s-style carriage, will abruptly pull into the station. The locomotive and its carriage are hereafter referred to as SCP-3444-1. SCP-3444-1 is painted entirely black, except for the words "Midnight Train" painted in white upon the side of the locomotive.

* The entrant into the station- hereafter referred to as the subject- will then be affected by a cognitohazardous effect. This effect compels the subject to abide by the "script" which governs the Golden Event and the Silver Events. The effect is mild to begin with, but intensifies in strength throughout the course of the Golden Event; a subject without cognitohazardous training ordinarily remains lucid until midway through SCP-3444-3's Silver Event.

* The subject will enter the carriage of SCP-3444-1. SCP-3444-1 will then proceed to leave the station. Once outside, it will become apparent from the significantly altered surroundings that SCP-3444 and SCP-3444-1 are now located in an entirely different locale, believed to be a different dimension.

* After approximately 8 kilometers of travelling, SCP-3444-1 will pull into another station, which is apparently identical to SCP-3444 except for the absence of the digital display, and with the signs displaying the name "NOWHERE" instead displaying the word "ORIGINS". This station is henceforth referred to SCP-3444-2. SCP-3444-1 will then stop, and will not resume its journey until the subject has alighted, left SCP-3444-2, entered the surrounding locale and returned onto SCP-3444-1.

* Within this locale, the first Silver Event (henceforth referred to as Silver Event A) will occur. Each Silver Event involves the subject being compelled to act as the protagonist in an elaborately-acted cinematic scene. These scenes are apparently improvised but often involve complex choreography and singing. The landscape which appears outside each station is always thematically appropriate for the purposes of the Silver Event, as are the various individuals who inhabit each locale and participate in each Silver Event. These individuals are henceforth designated SCP-3444-9 instances. The landscape onto which each station opens and the nature of each Silver Event vary from subject to subject, often incorporating details from the subject's memories. The combination of all 8 Silver Events in each Golden Event together appear to form a broad narrative, the details of which can be found below.

* Following the conclusion of Silver Event A, the subject will return to SCP-3444-1, which will then travel a further 8 kilometers to SCP-3444-3. This process will repeat itself through the train stations designated SCP-3444-3 to SCP-3444-8. These stations are all identical to SCP-3444, with the exception of variations in the signage; the name of the station appears to be different in each station. 8 kilometers after leaving SCP-3444-8, SCP-3444-1 will arrive at SCP-3444, which will remanifest in the town of Nowhere (with some minor alterations detailed below). A brief Silver Event will occur here, before the subject leaves the station.

* The cognitohazardous effect will then be removed from the subject, and SCP-3444 will demanifest.

References to SCP-3444 first appear in October 1927[[footnote]] Notable as being the month in which the first full-length "sound film", //The Jazz Singer//, was released.[[/footnote]], when an article about a "disappearing train station" appeared in the //Capital Journal//. The anomaly only came to the attention of the Foundation in 2003, when it was stumbled upon by researchers noting strong fluctuations in the area's Hume field.

Below are details of SCP-3444-2 to -8, as well as the Silver Events taking place within them. Each Experiment Log gives an account of a particular subject's experience at a particular station; a brief summary of the events in the rest of the stations they visit is included in each log.

[[tab SCP-3444-2 (ORIGINS)]]

SCP-3444-2 opens onto a predominantly rural landscape.  A single building will be present somewhere close to SCP-3444-2; beyond this, the landscape appears to stretch on indefinitely, with little or no variation. Located within the building will be SCP-3444-9-A, ordinarily a genetic copy of one of the subject's parents[[footnote]] Though sometimes, especially in cases where the subject lacked a prominent parental figure during their childhood, a figure acting in a parental role can substitute[[/footnote]]. The subject will feel compelled to enter the building, converse briefly with SCP-3444-9-A, and then return to SCP-3444-1.

SCP-3444-9-A will admonish the subject for failing to live up to their duties at home, and encourage them to follow a traditional career path within the local community (despite the apparent lack of one within the locale). SCP-3444-9-A will also frequently disparage the subject's aspirations for the future.

**Subject:** D-3150, a male from Lancashire, UK, convicted of arson. D-3150 was a failed ska musician who, having fallen into poverty, was paid by a local gangster to burn down the homes of several individuals indebted to him.

> 
> **D-3150:** Yeah, it's just- this looks exactly like home. The hills are just like those next to Mum's old farm! Where the hell am I? I was in America someplace!

> 
> **D-3150:** Uh- sure. It'd be nice to see somewhere homely again.

**Summary of Subsequent Silver Events:** 
* At SCP-3444-3 (BRIGHT LIGHTS), the station opened onto a recreation of 1980s Manchester, but one which appeared to be significantly more prosperous and well-maintained than Manchester was during that period. D-3150 walked through several record shops before returning to SCP-3444-3.

* At SCP-3444-4 (HARDSHIP), the station opened onto a recreation of a 1980s slum in Manchester. D-3150 gave an impassioned soliloquy about the difficulties of working at a laundromat when he wanted to become a renowned ska musician.

* At SCP-3444-5 (FIRST SIGHT), the station opened onto a discotheque. The SCP-3444-9-B instance was a female ska musician in her mid-30s. D-3150 and SCP-3444-9-B engaged in dancing for most of the duration of the Silver Event.

* At SCP-3444-6 (BIG BREAK), the station opened onto the office of a prominent record manager, who agreed to finance D-3150's ska record.

* At SCP-3444-7 (LOVE), the station opened onto a run-down motel on the outskirts of Manchester. SCP-3444-9-B gave an impassioned soliloquy about how she was being forced to leave Manchester; D-3150 then assured her that he would look after her. The two then checked into the motel, before engaging in sexual intercourse.

* At SCP-3444-8 (CLIMAX), the station opened onto the same version of Manchester as seen outside SCP-3444-3. D-3150, SCP-3444-9-B and a variety of SCP-3444-9 instances apparently representing D-3150's friends visited a variety of bars and clubs, imbibing several units of alcohol while there. D-3150 then returned to SCP-3444-8; D-3150's sobriety was immediately restored upon entering the station.

* At SCP-3444's second manifestation (WAKE UP), ska music could be heard before D-3150 left the station.

**Note:** D-3150 has subsequently been released, and become a successful ska musician, headlining a musical group called "Ska Ska Land."

[[tab SCP-3444-3 (BRIGHT LIGHTS)]]

SCP-3444-3 opens onto some form of open area within a city, ordinarily a marketplace or plaza. This area is usually brightly-lit and often elicits positive emotions of satisfaction or joy in the subject. A variety of SCP-3444-9 instances are present, often greeting the subject in a friendly fashion and offering to do business with them. The subject will feel compelled to walk across the area, often wandering into shops and conversing with the locals, before returning to SCP-3444-1.

**Subject:** D-2072, a female from Chicago, Illinois, convicted of 1st degree murder of Mrs. Valerie Jacobson, the wife of John Jacobson, with whom she had been having an affair. D-2072 was noted to be an afficionado of the "noir" genre. Of particular note is the apparent absence of the effects of [[[SCP-8900-EX]]] once SCP-3444-1 left SCP-3444.

**Summary of Prior Silver Events:** 
* At SCP-3444-2 (ORIGINS), the station opened onto a small country farm, with a farmhouse approximately 50m away from SCP-3444-2. The aesthetic of both farm and farmhouse were reminiscent of rural Illinois in the late 1940s. The SCP-3444-9-A instance- apparently a copy of D-2072's father- spoke in an accent and cadence reminiscent of 1940s Illinois. It became apparent in the subsequent Silver Events that the entirety of the Golden Event was set during the 1940s. SCP-3444-9-A implored D-2072 not to return to Chicago, and to stay as a farmer. D-2072 angrily rebuffed this advice, stating that she "had nothing to fear".

> **//<Begin Log>//**
> 
> //D-2072 exits SCP-3444-3. The environs she enters appears as a precise recreation of Haymarket Square, Chicago, in the early part of the 20th century, but significantly cleaner and containing significantly happier people. The weather is clear; [[[SCP-8900-EX]]] is still not active.//

> **Control:** Alright, D-2072, you still with us? If so, please head to-
> 
> //At this point, a disembodied female voice- later determined to be a highly exaggerated version of D-2072's own voice- began to speak. It is believed that this was a form of SCP-3444-9 instance, and is henceforth referred to as the "Voiceover" instance.//
> 
> **Voiceover:** Chicago. 1946. It'd been a long time since I'd been here last, but I didn't miss a single thing about it. The money. The whores. The booze. This city was a den of vice and whisky… and just my kinda town.
> 
> **Control:** Wha- D-2072, is that you?
> 
> **D-2072:** No, boss! I don't-
> 
> **Voiceover:** On the surface, it looked nice- pretty streets, gleaming surfaces. But I know that beneath its surface, was the same scum, the same filth that shot and killed for just another fistful of dollars.
> 
> //At this point, smooth jazz began to be heard.//
> 
> **Voiceover:** I swore I was done with this game. Swore I'd stay out of it, go home, be a model daughter. But that's just not me. Every time I try to leave, it just keeps pulling me back. And this time, it was a 7-foot piece of meat and muscle called John Jacobson.
> 
> **D-2072:** Wh-What? John? What the-
> 
> **Control:** For God's sake, it's running a noir film. What is this, some [[[scp-3043|Murphy Law]]] shit again?
> 
> //Control is heard to audibly sigh.//
> 
> **Control:** Look, D-2072, if you're still with us, just try to interview some of the people around you, OK? Ask them about their lives- where they came from, how they got here. And try to ignore the voice. It’s just drawing from your own life, trying to make a narrative.
> 
> **D-2072:** Um, OK, boss. Gotcha.
> 
> //D-2072 approaches a young boy, apparently around 10 years of age.//
> 
> **D-2072:** Umm...
> 
> OK, listen, kid. I don't know if you know anything or not, but I've heard that there's some bad stuff going' on this side of town. I need an informant. Whaddya say? I'll pay you a dollar a week.
> 
> **Control:** Goddamnit, we've lost her. I thought we were really holding on this time. Alright, switching to observation mode.
> 
> **Boy:** Aw, shucks, miss, that sounds like a real good plan. Jus' make it two dollars and we’ve got a deal.
> 
> **Voiceover:** The kid was smart. Too smart. I could see it in his eyes; he’d seen too much for too short a life. Give him a few years and he’d end up just like me; too damn stubborn, too damn idealistic. He’d soon learn that ideals were for fools and liars.
> 
> **Control:** This isn’t even good noir! Who wrote this?
> 
> **D-2072:** //<Passing two dollars to the boy>// Done. And if I want you to tail someone, you tail them, OK?
> 
> **Boy:** Gotcha, miss.
> 
> **Voiceover:** Chicago. It might seem sunny and fantastic on the outside, but I knew it better than anyone. Capone might be gone but the city was still alive and kicking with the mud and misery. And I was just a two-bit dame caught up in the middle of it all.

> 
> **Shopkeeper:** D-2072. Well, I never. Didn’t think I’d ever see you again.
> 
> **D-2072:** It’s just “Dee” now, Henry. Easier to replace on my door sign when it gets shot off.
> 
> **Shopkeeper:** You’ve got a lot of nerve showing up here again after the Friar Boys framed you for murder.
> 
> **D-2072:** Hey, Henry, you know me. I like to flirt with danger. Get me a Magnum. I’ve got a score to settle.
> 
> **Shopkeeper:** Anything for you, Dee.
> 
> //The “Shopkeeper” instance exchanges a .357 Magnum for a series of crumpled dollar bills. D-2072 stashes the magnum in a pocket, before heading for the door.//
> 
> **D-2072:** Be seein’ ya, Henry. Try to look out for yourself.
> 
> //D-2072 leaves the shop.// 
> 
> **Voiceover:** You see, I wasn’t just anyone. I was Dee 2072, Private Eye. There was money and opportunity to be made here for anyone with a gun and a face like mine. And I was there for anyone with cash in hand, and a sob story to make me cry.

**Summary of Subsequent Silver Events:**
* At SCP-3444-4 (HARDSHIP), the station opened onto a small office in a tower block, apparently owned by D-2072. A male SCP-3444-9 instance resembling John Jacobson entered the office, and hired D-2072 to investigate the murder of his wife. D-2072 discussed various monetary and legal concerns with the "Jacobson" instance, before returning to SCP-3444-4. The "Voiceover" instance present at SCP-3444-3 continued to vocalise, describing the "Jacobson" instance as "trouble", and making objectifying comments about him as he came into the room. 

* At SCP-3444-5 (FIRST SIGHT), the station opened onto a bar, apparently in a backstreet of downtown Chicago. SCP-3444-9-B was working as a barman, and spent much of the Silver Event flirting with D-2072. The "Voiceover" instance commented on the quality of the bar, the personalities of the SCP-3444-9 instances serving as the clientele, and engaged in objectification of SCP-3444-9-B.

* At SCP-3444-6 (BIG BREAK), the station opened onto a small apartment in downtown Chicago. D-2072 immediately began looking for clues. Eventually, D-2072 found fingerprints on a kettle, which she claimed proved that Jacobson was the killer. The "Voiceover" instance was not present in this Silver Event.

* At SCP-3444-7 (LOVE), the station opened onto a small motel on the outskirts of Chicago. D-2072 checked into the hotel, before being joined by SCP-3444-9-B. The pair engaged in sexual intercourse, before discussing existentialist and nihilist philosophy while smoking cigarettes. The "Voiceover" instance was not present in this Silver Event.

* At SCP-3444-8 (CLIMAX), the station opened onto Haymarket Square again; the weather, however, had changed from a clear sky to heavy rain. D-2072 confronted the "Jacobson" instance in the street, who confessed to his wife's murder. D-2072 shot the "Jacobson" instance, killing him. The "Voiceover" instance then expressed regret at the "turn things had been forced to take", before ruminating on the effect which life in Chicago has on human nature.

* At SCP-3444's second manifestation (WAKE UP), the "Voiceover" instance summarised the events of the Golden Event, and expressed a hope that one day D-2072 would be exonerated.

**Note:** D-2072 was subsequently exonerated, following a retrial which featured new evidence. John Jacobson was subsequently convicted of the murder. It was discovered that the police had purposely covered up DNA evidence found on a kettle in the Jacobsons' house in order to implicate D-2072.

[[tab SCP-3444-4 (HARDSHIP)]]

SCP-3444-4 opens onto an urban area, stylistically reminiscent of that found in SCP-3444-3. The area is typically portrayed as some form of slum or poor neighbourhood. At this point, the cognitohazardous effects ordinarily begin to alter not just the actions of the subject, but their personality too; they will consciously take on the role of someone living within a slum or house within the neighbourhood, attempting to become successful at their chosen field but instead relegated to a less desirable form of employment. The SCP-3444-9 instances will often be hostile to the subject, either through aggression or through attempts to take advantage of the subject's vulnerability. After these interactions, the subject will perform a soliloquy (or, for Golden Events running the "musical" script, a solo musical piece) discussing their condition, before returning to SCP-3444-1.

Please consult Experiment Log 3444-15 for more information.

**Subject:** D-2508, a female from Vermont, USA, convicted of the premeditated murder of her boyfriend, Keith Baker. This experiment is notable for being the first occasion on which the "musical" script was activated, in which each Silver Event features an elaborately-choreographed musical number.

**Summary of Prior Silver Events:** 
* At SCP-3444-2 (ORIGINS), the station opened onto an orchard in Vermont. A small farmhouse, containing SCP-3444-9-A, was located 50m away from SCP-3444-2. SCP-3444-9-A took the form of D-2508's father; the instance appeared to have imbibed a large quantity of alcohol, and spent much of his dialogue blaming D-2508 for her mother's death. Upon leaving the farmhouse, D-2508 sang a musical piece about how she wished to leave the countryside and attain some form of success in the city[[footnote]] The nature of this success was left vague. [[/footnote]], before returning to SCP-3444-2.

* At SCP-3444-3 (BRIGHT LIGHTS), the station opened onto Times Square, NYC, as of 2001. D-2508 entered through several shops located around Times Square, while singing a musical number (along with several SCP-3444-9 instances acting as background singers and dancers) about her hopes for life in the city. Once the musical number had finished, D-2508 returned to SCP-3444-3.

**Summary of Subsequent Silver Events:**
* At SCP-3444-5 (FIRST SIGHT), the station opened onto a French restaurant in Manhattan. SCP-3444-9-B appeared as a copy of D-2508's acquaintance Jacob Manwell. The two sang a duet concerning forbidden love.

* At SCP-3444-6 (BIG BREAK), the station opened onto the ticket office of a different train station. D-2508 bought a ticket to Albany, New York State, before engaging in a solo song concerning themes of romantic love and heartbreak.

* At SCP-3444-7 (LOVE), the station opened onto a woodland in upstate New York. D-2508, met SCP-3444-9-B. The two then engaged in an impassioned duet, in which they proclaimed their love for one another. The sound of an alarm[[footnote]] Noted to be extremely similar to the alarms used in D-2508's cell block to sound an escaped prisoner, but far more exaggerated. [[/footnote]] was then heard. D-2508 then ran back into SCP-3444-7.

* At SCP-3444-8 (CLIMAX), the station opened onto Times Square again. Several policeman were present, telling D-2508 that she had been completely exonerated from the murder of the "Baker" instance. In response, D-2508 initiated an elaborate musical number involving all the SCP-3444-9 instances present, including SCP-3444-9-B, concerning her newfound freedom, desire to stay in the city, and relationship with SCP-3444-9-B.

* At SCP-3444's second manifestation (WAKE UP), SCP-3444-9-B and the "Baker" instance appeared on either side of D-2508 after she stepped onto the platform. Piano music in the key of E minor could be heard be SCP-3444-9-B attempted to encourage D-2508, while the "Baker" instance attempted to denigrate D-2508. D-2508 was noted as being visually upset at their appearance, swiftly exiting SCP-3444.

[[tab SCP-3444-5 (FIRST SIGHT)]]

SCP-3444-5 opens onto some form of social establishment, such as a cafe, bar, nightclub or coffeehouse. The establishment will ordinarily be crowded with SCP-3444-9 instances, all of whom will be partaking of the venue's entertainments and diversions in the fashion customary to the establishment.

The subject will meet the SCP-3444-9-B instance at this location. The SCP-3444-9-B instance will serve as a romantic interest for the subject for the duration of the Golden Event. The SCP-3444-9-B instance will manifest as a figure particularly attractive to the subject. This figure can be entirely imaginary, but often appears as somebody to whom the subject is romantically attached, ranging from a long-term partner to a colleague or former schoolmate to whom the subject was once attracted to. The subject and the SCP-3444-9-B will ordinarily flirt or, if appropriate to the setting, dance; the scene will end with the subject returning to SCP-3444-1, often after the promise of a second meeting.

**Subject:** Junior Researcher Sybil Westwood[[footnote]] Following 18 experiments using D-Class personnel, it was determined that SCP-3444 was safe to use. Foundation personnel were consequently used in subsequent tests. [[/footnote]]. Dr. Westwood had been transferred to Site 90 from the Antimemetics Division, and as such had advanced cognitohazardous training. Dr. Westwood was instructed to resist the influence of the Silver Events as much as was possible.

**Summary of Prior Silver Events:** 
* At SCP-3444-2 (ORIGINS), the station opened onto a small airstrip in the middle of a tundra-like landscape, with a small concrete building present[[footnote]] Dr. Westwood has described the landscape as being similar to her homeland in the Northwestern Territories, Canada. [[/footnote]]. As per her instructions, Dr. Westwood did not enter the building, but instead attempted to explore the surrounding area; it was determined that the same landscape stretched indefinitely in all directions. After 30 minutes of this, Dr. Westwood returned to SCP-3444-2, citing her rapidly-diminishing cognitohazardous resistance as a reason for cutting her explorations short.

* At SCP-3444-3 (BRIGHT LIGHTS), the station opened onto an idealised version of Manhattan, NYC, New York; instead of being an open space as per usual, the area was instead a cluster of crowded streets surrounded by skyscrapers. The streets formed an enclosed system, preventing in-depth exploration. Dr. Westwood's attempts to interview the SCP-3444-9 instances revealed that they were all highly-paid, highly motivated workers in the financial district. Dr. Westwood returned to SCP-3444-3 relatively quickly, due to concerns about her weakening cognitohazardous defences.

* At SCP-3444-4 (HARDSHIP), the station opened-unusually- onto an office in one of the same tower-blocks seen earlier. Three SCP-3444-9 instances, playing the roles of friends of Dr. Westwood, attempted to discuss love and romance with Dr. Westwood. Dr. Westwood ignored this line of questioning, instead attempting to question the SCP-3444-9 instances about their origins and nature. The SCP-3444-9 instances expressed considerable confusion as to Dr. Westwood's meaning, and eventually left, seeming offended.

The same characters, same archetypes, endlessly recycled in other peoples’ dreams.

**Summary of Subsequent Silver Events:**
* At SCP-3444-6 (BIG BREAK), the station opened onto the same offices present in SCP-3444-4's locale, but with an SCP-3444-9 instance identical to Site Director Perry present, apparently representing Dr. Westwood's superior. The "Perry" instance offered Dr. Westwood a job, which Dr. Westwood excitedly and happily accepted.[[footnote]] It appears that Dr. Westwood's cognitohazardous resistance completely broke down following the Silver Event of SCP-3444-5. [[/footnote]] 

* At SCP-3444-7 (LOVE), the station opened onto an upmarket Italian restaurant. SCP-3444-9-B was seated at a table, which Dr. Westwood approached and sat at. SCP-3444-9-B professed his love for Dr. Westwood, and insisted that she leave her job and marry him. Dr. Westwood stated that she would need time to consider such a proposal, before running from the restaurant into SCP-3444-7.

* At SCP-3444-8 (CLIMAX), the station opened once again onto the locale of SCP-3444-2. Dr. Westwood approached SCP-3444-9-B, announcing her intention to give up the job opportunity offered to her by the "Perry" instance in order to raise a family with SCP-3444-9-B. The pair then dramatically kissed, causing the surrounding SCP-3444-9 instances to give a standing ovation.

* At SCP-3444's second manifestation (WAKE UP), Dr. Westwood's cognitohazardous training appeared to reactivate, leading to an angry soliloquy against the "romantic comedy" film genre, expressing considerable anger against the anti-feminist sentiments often present in such films. Unusually, no music was heard.

**Note:** The presence of a musical element in a Silver Event when the Golden Event was not running a "musical" script is thus far unique to this experiment.

SCP-3444-6 ordinarily opens onto an office or other suitable venue owned by some form of company or institution which the subject, within the "script" of the Golden Event, wishes to work at. The subject will ordinarily undergo some form of interview; they will subsequently be told that they have received the position, eliciting a great deal of happiness and excitement in the subject.

**Subject:** Senior Researcher Claude Montague. Dr. Montague entered SCP-3444 at his own request, for therapeutic purposes. It should be noted that Dr. Montague was raised as an adherent of the Cogwork Orthodox Church[[footnote]] A splinter-group of the Church of the Broken God, which adheres to the technological norms of the Industrial Revolution and sees the production of clockwork and analog technology as a form of prayer.[[/footnote]], before defecting to the Foundation as an adult.

**Summary of Prior Silver Events:** 
* At SCP-3444-2 (ORIGINS), the station opened onto what appeared to be a large piece of clockwork machinery refashioned to resemble a countryside landscape. Several pieces of machinery resembling shrubs, trees, flowers and birds were present. A cabin constructed in brass and resembling a Victorian cottage was present. SCP-3444-9-A bore a strong resemblance to [[[the-heresy-of-disassembly|Legate Trunnion]]] of the Cogwork Orthodox Church. SCP-3444-9-A gave Dr. Montague a long speech concerning his "heretical impulses", exhorting him to stay and be further Standardised. Dr. Montague abruptly ran out of the building and back into SCP-3444-2.

* At SCP-3444-3 (BRIGHT LIGHTS), the station opened onto what appeared to a copy of Site 90, but constructed entirely from wood and plant matter. Several SCP-3444-9 instances, dressed in Foundation uniforms, were walking around the area, apparently with no particular job in hand. During the Silver Event, Dr. Montague gave an impassioned soliloquy about his dislike of the Cogworth Orthodox Church and his desire to work at the Foundation, before returning to SCP-3444-3.

* At SCP-3444-4 (HARDSHIP), the station opened onto a copy of a Standard Humanoid Containment Cell at Site 90. The cell and its environs were made entirely of brass, with several clockwork apparati fused into the walls. Dr. Montague spent much of the Silver Event at the door of his cell, begging to be let out and insisting upon his loyalty to the Foundation.

* At SCP-3444-5 (FIRST SIGHT), the station opened onto a bar, with the letters "SITE 90 REFECTORY" emblazoned above it. The bar and all of its furnishings were constructed of wood. SCP-3444-9-B took the form of Dr. Montague's wife, Junior Researcher Maria Fonseca. The two discussed literature and philosophy during Dr. Montague's three hour stay in this location.

> **//<Begin Log>//**
> 
> //SCP-3444-6 opens onto a small office, with a single desk and two windows. The camera feed cannot see what is through the windows. The entire office and all its furnishings are constructed from wood. A single male SCP-3444-9 is sitting behind the desk, wearing a Foundation uniform. Dr. Montague enters the room and sits on a chair in front of the desk.//
> 
>  **Interviewer:** Greetings, Dr. Montague. How are you today?
> 
> **Dr. Montague:** Well, thank you. The quarters given are most satisfactory, and I appreciate the work of the Foundation doctors you have sent in removing my implants. I feel… much freer.
> 
>  **Interviewer:** We are glad. We just have a few more questions to ask you.
> 
> **Dr. Montague:** Of course.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Why did you leave the Cogwork Orthodox Church?
> 
> **Dr. Montague:** It was… a gradual realisation that I was living in a world that was half-mad. I-I just could not quite reconcile the idea that my body was somehow… wrong, or impure. Flesh seemed so natural to me. I don’t mean in the manner of the Sarkicists, of course, but I, my being, felt right to me. I didn’t want these alterations. They were the parts of me that felt impure. The world beyond, the ordinary flesh-and-blood and real world- this felt far more genuine, far more true.
> 
>  **Interviewer:** Very good. What, in your own words, do you think you can provide the Foundation?
> 
> **Dr. Montague:** Apart from my knowledge of the Church? Well, I do have a doctorate in linguistics. I have always wanted to learn about the ways in which we communicate ourselves, you see. I think such skills could prove useful to you.
> 
>  **Interviewer:** Indeed they could. Finally, why did you choose to defect to the Foundation?
> 
> **Dr. Montague:** Because, to me, the Foundation represents the preservation of life against death. Whatever its faults, whatever its methods, it remains the best way to keep us running. I have lived a life of mad gods and lying clockwork; I have encountered snake-people and arcane gods and all sorts of horrors. Human life should be treasured for what it is, preserved for what it is, not torn and ripped to shreds by its external enemies or internal fanatics. The Foundation may kill, but only for the greater good. For humanity’s advancement.
> 
>  **Interviewer:** …Well, Dr. Montague, that all seems in order. I have some good news for you: the Foundation may be cold, but it is not cruel, and we feel you have aptly demonstrated your loyalty towards us over the past few weeks. We are consequently willing to grant you employment on a probationary basis.
> 
> **Dr. Montague:** Wh- really? Oh, thank you!
> 
>  **Interviewer:** Please, remain seated. Do not thank us yet, Dr. Montague. We will be closely monitoring your progress, and we will know if there are any lapses in loyalty.
> 
> **Dr. Montague:** O-of course. I would expect nothing less.
> 
> //The “Interviewer” instance rises from his seat to shake Dr. Montague’s hand.//
> 
>  **Interviewer:** Still, I think this is a decision we’re not going to regret. Congratulations, Dr. Montague. You’ll be working here, at Site 90. I hope you enjoy it.
> 
> **Dr. Montague:** Thank you so much, sir. You do not know what this means to me. I won’t let you down.
> 
>  **Interviewer:** See that you don’t.
> 
> //Dr. Montague then turns and re-enters SCP-3444-6.//
> 
> //**<End Log>**//

**Summary of Subsequent Silver Events:**
* At SCP-3444-7 (LOVE), the station opened onto a large, mostly empty grass field, with a single tree standing in the centre stretching into the sky. Dr. Montague and SCP-3444-9-B climbed to the top of the tree, which was located in outer space[[footnote]] Some form of spatial anomaly appeared to be affecting the tree, as the climb only took Dr. Montague and SCP-3444-9-B 10 minutes. [[/footnote]]. Dr. Montague and the SCP-3444-9-B sat at the top of the tree for 5 minutes, staring around them while holding one another's hands, before Dr. Montague left SCP-3444-9-B, climbed back down and returned to SCP-3444-7.

* At SCP-3444-8 (CLIMAX), the Site 90 copy was filled with the same SCP-3444-9 instances as before, but in a state of merriment, apparently holding an impromptu party. An SCP-3444-9 instance resembling Site Director Perry came and congratulated Dr. Montague on his entry into the Foundation.

* At SCP-3444's second manifestation (WAKE UP), Dr. Montague began to weep, apparently due to intense happiness, upon exiting SCP-3444-1. An upbeat piece of piano music could be heard by observers.

//I think this should put to rest any assertions that Dr. Montague's loyalty to the Foundation is in any way suspect.//- Dr. Perry, Director of Site 90.

SCP-3444-7's locale and the "script" of the Silver Event are extremely variable. The only constant is that it involves a positive romantic encounter between the subject and the SCP-3444-9-B instance. This often ends in some form of sexual act, depending on the setting of the Golden Event.

**Subject:** Researcher Amir Safavi. It should be noted that Dr. Safavi is a native of Isfahan Province, Iran.

**Summary of Prior Silver Events:** 
* At SCP-3444-2 (ORIGINS), the station opened onto a large expanse of sand, containing a small sandstone hut. The SCP-3444-9 A instance was apparently a copy of Dr. Safavi's mother. The hut was furnished in a manner suitable to a peasant dwelling in 17th century Iran. SCP-3444-9-A told Dr. Safavi that she considered his sexuality to be an "abomination", and told him that staying with her would be the optimum way to "cure" him. Dr. Safavi angrily rebuffed this line of thought, before leaving the building and returning to SCP-3444-2 in a state of considerable distress.

* At SCP-3444-3 (BRIGHT LIGHTS), the station opened onto a copy of the Naqsh-e Jahan Square in Isfahan circa 1650. The SCP-3444-9 instances were all wearing clothes and using language appropriate for that period, but the social makeup was apparently idealised, with a number of same-sex couples from both genders and a variety of different races present among the SCP-3444-9 instances. Dr. Safavi spent his time here bartering with SCP-3444-9 instances appearing as merchants, but did not purchase any goods; after two hours, he returned to SCP-3444-3.

* At SCP-3444-4 (HARDSHIP), the station opened onto a copy of an Isfahani slum circa 1650. Dr. Safavi gave a soliloquy about the impossibility of finding love in Isfahan, despite the immense size of the city.

* At SCP-3444-5 (FIRST SIGHT), the station opened onto a 17th century Iranian coffeehouse. The SCP-3444-9-B instance appeared to be a copy of Dr. Howard Wong, Dr. Safavi's colleague at Site 90. The two discussed poetry and miniature painting for 3 hours, before Dr. Safavi returned to SCP-3444-5.

* At SCP-3444-6 (BIG BREAK), the station opened onto a room of the Ali Qapu pavilion in Isfahan. Several miniature paintings appropriate to the period were present on a table in the centre of the room, apparently having been painting by Dr. Safavi.[[footnote]] Miniature painting is a hobby of Dr. Safavi's. [[/footnote]] An SCP-3444-9 instance apparently representing Shah 'Abbas II entered the room, critically appraised the works, and offered Dr. Safavi a position as a court miniaturist. Dr. Safavi happily accepted the offer.

> 
> **Dr. Safavi:** But what of the journey itself?
> 
> **SCP-3444-9-B:** Ahh, the poet in you speaks! It was full of cold nights and fiery days. I have missed you so much, my love. At night, I would gaze upwards, into the face of God, and try to compose a few tawdry lines, but they were of inferior quality.

> 
> **SCP-3444-9-B:** Oh, most beloved, do not worry yourself on this count. After all, who says that dreams must not be real? To some, the dream is more real than the physical world. Perhaps this is not the world of matter, but the world of the spirit. Perhaps our joy is the expression of union with God. It matters not. All that matters is the feeling, in the here and now, of love.
> 
> **Dr. Safavi:** Yes… Love. I love you. We can be happy here, even if only for an hour, a day, a minute, a few seconds, my hopes can be fulfilled.

**Summary of Subsequent Silver Events:**

* At SCP-3444-8 (CLIMAX), the station opened onto the Naqsh-e Jahan Square for a second time. Several SCP-3444-9 instances, including SCP-3444-9-B, congratulated Dr. Safavi on his appointment to the Shah's court.

* At SCP-3444's second manifestation (WAKE UP), a piece of slow piano music in the key of D Major began to play. Dr. Safavi seemed extremely satisfied.

* At SCP-3444-2 (ORIGINS), the station opened onto a narrow street in Istanbul.[[footnote]] It should be noted that the subject was adopted by Dr. Perry from a charity set up to rehome Turkish strays cats. [[/footnote]] No SCP-3444-9 manifestations were visible except for a female Persian cat, believed to SCP-3444-9-A and representing the subject's mother. SCP-3444-9-A attempted to give the subject a dead bird, but the subject instead ran back into the station.

* At SCP-3444-3 (BRIGHT LIGHTS), the station opened onto what appeared to be a large, spacious manor house during the daytime, with abundant gardens. The house contained several dozen cats within it, each occupying a room the size of a typical domestic house cat's territory. The house featured several versions of Dr. Perry, each holding a bowl containing an unlimited amount of wet cat food. The house was largely filled with scratching posts, cat-beds and piles of unwashed laundry.

* At SCP-3444-4 (HARDSHIP), the station opened onto the gardens seen in BRIGHT LIGHTS, but with all entrances into the manor house closed. Instead of taking place during the day, the Silver Event took place at night. Several large, vicious house cats and Rottweilers were seen patrolling the garden, although none of them appeared to seriously threaten the subject. The subject spent the Silver Event attempting to hunt a small wren, eventually succeeding before returning to the train.

* At SCP-3444-5 (FIRST SIGHT), the station opened onto a suburban street. The subject was seen meowing heavily at a large male Bengal cat, determined to be SCP-3444-9-B. The cats displayed typical courtship behaviour towards one another, before the subject returned to SCP-3444-5.

* At SCP-3444-6 (BIG BREAK), the station opened onto a cat adoption agency. A pair of SCP-3444-9 instances, each identical to Dr. Perry, entered the building and took the subject back to SCP-3444-6.

* At SCP-3444-7 (LOVE), the station opened onto a back-garden. SCP-3444-9-B was present, and proceeded to [DATA REDACTED AT REQUEST OF DR. PERRY]. The subject then returned to SCP-3444-7.

> //SCP-3444-8 appears to open onto a large garden. While mostly covered in grass, it is flanked by trees. Its two distinguishing features are a large rock- upon which several feline SCP-3444-9 instances are lazing- an extremely tall tree in the centre of the garden, and a small hole in the ground. Several leaves are protruding from the hole in the ground.//
> 
> //The two SCP-3444-9 instances resembling Dr. Perry seen in the previous Silver Event are standing directly behind the subject, smiling. SCP-3444-9-B can be seen.//
> 
> //The subject emits a vocalisation, and walks towards SCP-3444-9-B. SCP-3444-9-B notices the subject, and walks towards her. The subject and SCP-3444-9-B begin to purr. The subject gently nuzzles SCP-3444-9-B.//
> 
> //SCP-3444-9-B then emits a vocalisation, before running towards the central tree. SCP-3444-9-B begins to climb the tree. The subject follows, doing the same.//
> 
> //The subject and SCP-3444-9-B. climb the tree until they reach its height. There, they see a small circle of dirt levitating in the air. They enter the circle, and climb out of it. They are now once again on the surface of the garden, having climbed out of the aforementioned hole.//
> 
> //The subject emits a loud vocalisation. SCP-3444-9-B also emits a loud vocalisation. The two stare at one another, purring, for approximately 2 minutes. The subject then turns and re-enters SCP-3444-8.//

**Summary of Subsequent Silver Events:**
* At SCP-3444's second manifestation (WAKE UP), the subject was noted to have "meowed mournfully" before leaving the station.

[[tab SCP-3444, Second Manifestation (WAKE UP)]]

SCP-3444's second manifestation contains three notable deviations from SCP-3444:

* The station's sign reads "WAKE UP" instead of "NOWHERE", and the digital display is absent.
* Both the subject within and outside observers report hearing music- often piano music- being played.
* SCP-3444-9 instances can appear here, apparently independently of the "script" of the Golden Event.

Upon leaving the station, SCP-3444 disappears and it ceases to have any effect on the subject in question.

**Subject:** Jacqueline Perry, Director of Site 90. Dr. Perry has had cognitohazardous training, but was using SCP-3444 for recreational purposes, and thus chose not to employ it.

**Summary of Prior Silver Events:** 
* At SCP-3444-2 (ORIGINS), the station opened onto another corn field, with a small farmhouse containing the SCP-3444-A instance. It was noted at this point that the Golden Event had taken the form of a musical, as Dr. Perry began to sing about the boredom she felt in the countryside. SCP-3444-A took the form of Dr. Perry's mother, and told her that she should "give up her dreams of acting", as they were "unsuitable for a young lady". Dr. Perry simply left the building without speaking, and returned to SCP-3444-2.

* At SCP-3444-3 (BRIGHT LIGHTS), the station opened onto what appeared to be an idealised version of Los Angeles in the 1950s. Of particular note is the prevalence of art deco architecture in the city's makeup, and an anachronistic level of minority integration. Dr. Perry engaged in a musical number, along with the SCP-3444-9 instances present, concerning her acting dreams and desire to become a major Hollywood film star; the musical number finished with her being bodily flung by several male SCP-3444-9 instances into SCP-3444-3.

* At SCP-3444-4 (HARDSHIP), the station opened onto a slum of Los Angeles, but which bore a remarkable similarity to areas of New York in the late 1980s. It should by noted that Dr. Perry grew up in New York during the 1970s and 1980s. Dr. Perry was seen working as a waitress in a small cafe, before singing a solo musical piece, accompanied by a violin, discussing her depression and numerous failed auditions.

* At SCP-3444-5 (FIRST SIGHT), the station opened onto a 1980s-style nightclub. SCP-3444-9-B was a Latino male in his mid-20s, who worked as a bouncer at the nightclub. The two engaged in a salsa dance in the centre of the nightclub for most of the duration of the Silver Event.

* At SCP-3444-6 (BIG BREAK), the station opened onto the grounds of a major Hollywood studio. Dr. Perry gave an audition to a pair of SCP-3444-9 instances representing studio executives. The instances appeared pleased with her performance, and Dr. Perry successfully got a major role in a Hollywood film about the SCP Foundation. This was followed by an elaborate musical number about her happiness.

* At SCP-3444-7 (LOVE), the station opened onto a motel car park. Dr. Perry and the SCP-3444-9-B instance engaged in a romantic musical number, wherein they profess their feelings for one another, before each left the area; Dr. Perry headed back to SCP-3444-7.

* At SCP-3444-8 (CLIMAX), the station opened onto the Dolby Theatre, LA, where Dr. Perry is seen receiving the Academy Award for Best Actress. SCP-3444-9-B was seen applauding her from the crowd. Following her acceptance speech, Dr. Perry returned to SCP-3444-8.

> //Dr. Perry steps off SCP-3444-1, and onto the platform.//
> 
> //After five seconds, piano music can be heard, and Dr. Perry begins to sing.//
> 
> **Dr. Perry:** Ohhh, won't you come with me to paradise,
> And feel the way things were,
> Ohhh, won't you come with me to paradise,
> And dance in a moonlit blur,
> 
> //At this point, SCP-3444-9-B suddenly appears in the camera shot, coming from the left of the platform. SCP-3444-9-B then begins to sing.//
> 
> **SCP-3444-9-B**: Ohhh, won't you come with me to paradise,
> And feel sand on your feet, 
> Ohhh, won't you come with me upon this night,
> And forget the snow and sleet,
> 
> **Dr. Perry:** Ohhh, for those misspent nights in paradise,
> That fantasy out of time
> Ohhh, for all of those heavenly stars to shine,
> To forget such lonely lives
> 
> **SCP-3444-9-B:** Ohhh, I wish that in our misspent youth,
> When we could just catch a train,
> We'd dream dreams that are now denied to us,
> Of the City of Angels,
> 
> //Several SCP-3444-9 instances, dressed in full tuxedos, appear in both sides of the camera shot. The music suddenly changes to that of a full orchestra, increasing the intensity and tempo of the music dramatically. Dr. Perry, SCP-3444-9-B and the rest of the SCP-3444-9 instances begin a complex musical number.//
> 
> **SCP-3444-9 instances:** Ohhh, for long-lost thoughts of this paradise,
> That as children we forgot,
> Ohhh, for this starlight, lovestruck paradise,
> That as adults we could not,
> 
> Ohhh, for this makeshift train-clad paradise,
> Its tortured and lovelorn seas,
> Ohhh, come with me to this heaven with me,
> To the way things should have been.
> 
> **Dr. Perry:** And in that wondrous, starlit night,
> 
> **SCP-3444-9-B:** And in that grand motel at morn,
> 
> **Dr. Perry:** And walking on the waterfront,
> 
> **SCP-3444-9-B:** And on that fresh golden dawn!
> 
> **SCP-3444-9 instances:** Ohhh, won't you come with her to paradise,
> Where things are as they should be,
> Ohhh, for our childhood paradise,
> Ohhh, to think what could have been,
> 
> Ohhh, for this makeshift train-clad paradise,
> Its tortured and lovelorn seas,
> Ohhh, come with her to this heaven with her,
> To the way things should have been.
> 
> //At this point, the SCP-3444-9 instances, including SCP-3444-9-B, all disappear from the camera feed with an elaborate flourish. Dr. Perry is left alone on the platform, at this point on her knees and singing towards the sky.//
> 
> **Dr. Perry:** Ohhh, won't you come with me to paradise,
> To a ramshackle fantasy,
> Ohhh, won't you come with me to paradise,
> And dance in the sky with me...
> 
> //Dr. Perry then exits SCP-3444 by the entrance. Agents Cartwright and Olivers are waiting to collect her.//
> 
> **Agent Cartwright:** Nice singing, doctor.
> 
> **Dr. Perry:** Shut up, Cartwright. Time to go home.
