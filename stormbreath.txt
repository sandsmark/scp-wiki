[[tab J1-13]]
**Name:** J1-13 (Henrik Sturmatem)

**Position:** Janitor Overseer Council

**Background:** Nobody is quite sure when J1-13 first started working for the Foundation, with some rumoring that he's been around longer than the Administrator. These personnel are, of course, reminded that the Administrator doesn't actually exist and that J1-13 likely started working before the Great RAISA Fire of '94, which destroyed almost all records of 0 Level staff.

J1-13 has served without major distinction as a Foundation janitor, cleaning a large collection of random anomalies. J1-13 has shown the marked ability to not die after at least twenty years working with the Foundation, having been involved in ███ containment breaches, the majority of which involved him cowering under a table and repeatedly muttering "I went to law school for this?"

As a result of having been employed by the Foundation for an exceptionally long period of time for a janitor, Henrik Sturmatem was promoted to the J1 Council as J1-13, giving him full Level 1 Clearance. [[footnote]]The J1 Council refers to the committee consisting of the highest-ranking janitors of the Foundation. With complete access to all information regarding the cleaning of anomalies in containment, the J1 Council oversees all Foundation cleaning operations worldwide and directs its long-term cleaning plans. Due to the sensitivity of their positions, J1 Council members must --not-- come into direct contact with any anomalous object, entity, or phenomenon. Furthermore, the identities of all J1 Council members is classified; all council members are referred to only by their numeric designation (J1-1 through J1-13).[[/footnote]] This does not absolve him of any cleaning duties.

[[tab Me as an Author]]
I'm not quite sure where/when I first discovered the SCP Foundation, but it was probably sometime in 2015. This first SCP I distinctly remember reading was [[[SCP-1689]]], but I also remember plowing on through the articles in numerical order starting with SCP-002. (I know I didn't start with 001, but I'm not really sure why.)

I had some ideas for objects in that time, including:
* A cup that experienced time in reverse chronological order, so that if you tried to damage it, you'd only repair damage that had already happened, and repairing it would only cause new damage.
* A Fifthist priest that was contained by the ritual significance of the number "3" being prevalent in their life. (like, getting three square meals a day, being in a 9m x 9m x 9m containment chamber, having a designation with several 3s in it)
* A memetic statement that greatly changed brainwave patterns and gave you telekinesis ... in Dolphin. The sapient and telekinetic dolphins then formed empires and tried to stop people from killing them or putting them in zoos.

I never really put any of these to paper (and when I did years later, I didn't like them as I had in the past.)

After what was probably two years of lurking, I finally created an account in order to post SCP-3310. This started with a basic idea of taking a real world thing and making it an anomaly without adding much. [[footnote]] Not taking a real world thing and adding an anomaly to it, like I did with Harold Holt and SCP-3477 [[/footnote]] I think one of the pitfalls of the article was that the Old Man isn't well known enough - it's not famous enough that people wouldn't immediately see it and think "Oh wow! That's a real thing I am already familiar with!", which I a large part of what I wanted.

My second SCP was the Writer of Ganymede, a giant spider thing on Ganymede that wanted to take care of humanity. It didn't do very well, and got deleted pretty quickly. I rewrote it as a Black Queen GoI article, but that ended up being somewhat bland and not particularly good. I may come back to it at some point, but I'm not sure.

I also posted an skip about an object that had become separated from it's location, and was just the location. It ended in a D-Class having the same thing happen to them, and becoming a pseudo-ghost. It wasn't very well executed, as it ready similar to a lot of other SCPs. I self-deleted it as well.

I like numbers repeating in my SCP numbers.

[[tab Author Commentary]]

[[collapsible show="► SCP-3310" hide="▼ The Old Man of the Lake"]]
* My idea when making this was to take a real world thing that seemed a bit paranormal and turn it into an object. I played with a couple other ideas, including the Curse of Tamerlane, but I ended up going for the Old Man.
* A lot of this article is real - there really is a log in Crater Lake, it's been there since the late 1800s, the incident about scientists removing actually happened (all of it - they removed it, there were storms immediately, they thought they pissed off the log and put it back), the myths at the end are real Klamath myths
* This is not my favorite thing that I've written. The biggest reason is that it doesn't really feel original - a large percentage of this SCP is from the wikipedia page about it. Basing it off a real world thing caused it to lack originality
* My intent was that the Foundation/ASCI's messing with the log has been weakening it's ability to keep Llao dead. This was more evident in the original, before I changed what Pangloss was saying. However, that wasn't really in line with his character, so he doesn't tell the Foundation they're fucking up now. The idea is that they still are.

[[collapsible show="► SCP-3477" hide="▼ Will the Real Harold Holt Please Stand Up?"]]
* This takes inspiration from a lot of different SCPs, most notably [[[SCP-2404]]] and [[[SCP-1041]]]. It's interesting that nobody has said that mine reminded me of those, because it was initially concieved as combination of those.
* The title is a bad reference.
* Harold Holt was not always the guy who became anomalous. I had decided I wanted it to be a politician or somebody famous, and then I wanted a politican who had mysteriously disappeared. It came down to either Harold Holt or Jimmy Hoffa, and I decided to go with Harold Holt because his disappearance worked a bit better. 
* One of my favorite things about this article is the amount of world building in it - the article really feels like it's an integrated part of the SCP world. The table especially references a high number of GoIs and makes several crosslinks, both of which continued in the table.
* The Great Barrier Reef Empire-In-Exile is a reference to my unwritten dolphin empire skip. (It was originally a merfolk empire, but then I thought that sapient dolphins would being easier to brush over and just accept.)
* Ottaviano Medici is from the House of Medici, specifically from the height of it's power in the 15th century. He's also immortal, but he has a much better way of maintaining it than animatronic Harold got. In short - MC&D jipped 3477-23.
* The idea of Extraordinary Special Containment Procedures were taken from [[[SCP-3072]]], although I didn't put in a crosslink there. I used it to represent instructions of what to do in the case of a breach scenario.
* I used MTF Zeta-2 because I wanted a Task Force that hadn't been used much, and was surprised to find one that had only been mentioned on the log of Extranormal Events. My headcanon is that it's primarily a humanoid recontainment task force.
* While writing, I never had an concrete number of Harold Holts that I wanted there to be in total, but now I do. I chosen the number primarily just because I liked having 34 in it (because that was always the contained number) and I liked having repeated numbers, but now I like having it be a fraction: the Foundation contained 34/77 Harold Holts, so there are 33 more.
* I don't have an answer as to which of the Harold Holts are real, or how there are so many of them. Your guess is as good as mine.

* DrChandra contacted me and asked if I wanted to collab on a full table of Harolds, so we made [[[document-3477-2|Document-3477 #2]]]. He did most of the work, and I just did some editing.
* The only instance I actually wrote for this was the Australian Selkie (-4), which was based off a now deleted SCP written by Freudian. Somebody asked if one of the instances on the main 3477 page was a reference to that (it wasn't) but I thought it would be cool to make the reference.
* Most of the crosslinks were added by me to already written instances: the 963-like hat, the tulpa and the lucky one were all written when I decided to throw out some crosslinks to similar ones. The corgi train bit served to justify faeries a little more. -18 was originally explicitly a god, but I modified that to use the same format as 3480, and crosslink to there.
* -22 originally got it's wish from "a high level reality bender" but that was just so bland and clinical. I changed it to djinn because I was able to find a crosslink that worked, and it just flows so much better.

[[collapsible show="► SCP-2684" hide="▼ Where's the Beach?"]]
* I've already talked about the inspiration for this on the discussion page, but it's from the fear of briefly losing sight of the beach while swimming. 
* The title is also a bad reference.
* One of the first drafts for this had 8872, 3613 and 5327 all end up committing suicide - 8872 by intentionally drowning herself, 3613 with the knife and 5327 with the same gun the captain used. However, that was pretty cliche and I didn't like the sameness, so 8872 just drowned and 5237 starved to death.
* D-8872's crime was killing somebody (sibling/parent/spouse/child/friend) by drowning or letting them drown. Thus, she thinks she's in an ironic hell, and genuinely believes she's been damned to hell at the end.
* At one point, I had 5327 hallucinate as he's starving to death. However, because his narration was the only source of info regarding the last log, there really wouldn't be an easy way to make it explicit that he was hallucinating.
* My hope was that it'd be clear than 5327 killed 1176 after their argument, and that it'd be less clear that 5327 ate both 1176 and the captain. There aren't as many hints to those, with there only being one very subtle remark about how he ate the captain's body.
* The alternate history was meant to hammer in that this ocean is not anywhere on Earth, and that the D-Class aren't just, say, in the middle of the pacific. The other ship let me extend the amount of time that people spent in the ocean to several months. 
* The "false remains of the child" that were created as part of the cover story were a clone of the kid. That line was meant to be a "Wait, what?" moment, but may have been too subtle. [[/collapsible]]
@@@@
[[collapsible show="► SCP-2317-J" hide="▼ A Door to Another Parody"]]
* I've had the idea for this one for a while, and I finally just decided to actually write it up. This was a really quick write, only taking me about two hours of writing and little revisions. 
* The "Blackbox-Blackbox-Blackbox-Blackbox" joke was the first part of this that I originally thought of, because the idea of people actually saying "Redacted" is really funny to me.
* All of the characters (except for the D-Class) in the article were taken from the people who accessed the file in the original article, which wasn't something I had ever really paid attention to before. That said, KPC being the level 4 person allowed me to make a dog joke.
* This is oddly similar to the skip I wrote before it - short description followed by a bunch of dialogue.
* I've thought about turning this into a non-J, and I feel that parts of it could work: instead of being SCP-2317-K behind the door, some sort of interdimensional vampire would work, playing up the "can't enter unless invited" and "mind-control" tropes.

[[collapsible show="► Project Proposal 1994-103" hide="▼ A Song of Hope and Home"]]
* Adebowale is Yoruba for "the crown has come home" and is a gender neutral name. I don't have an assigned gender for Adebowale as a character. Also, Adebowale is the entirety of their name in the anart community - they're one of those artists that only goes by their first names. (Like Prince or Beyonce)
* My headcanon is that AWCY? uses the same Universe classification system as the Wanderer's Library. X-### universes are meant to represent dead universes.
* The hot chocolate, coffee, tea and blankets in the materials list are so Adebowale can take care of the people after they listen to the song - it's emotionally draining, and you need some time to recover.
* The steel triangle is used for the memetic primer, and the beryllium bronze triangle is used for the memetic cleaner. The idea is that beryllium bronze stabilizes reality, and is thuse able to remove the memetic primers that the song places.
* Adebowale calls it "Pandora's Amphora", not Box. This isn't just them being poetic or descriptive: my idea is that everyone calls it an amphora in their home reality, and this is one of those few subtle differences between worlds.
* A large part of the inspiration for this as I was writing was my failure to convey 100% of the emotion and imagery I've felt through writing. I've always wanted to just be able to put the ideas into somebody else's head, so they actually //know//.
* The original idea of this piece was just a song that took viewers to a beautiful sight. When I was writing, I had the realization that the most beatiful things we see aren't objective, but subjective, so for someone else to think something was incredibly beautiful you'd need to give them the same experiences as you. This led me to the idea of the narrator having gone through extreme hardship before seeing the sight, and that being the main reason they thought it was beautiful.

[[collapsible show="► SCP-3557" hide="▼ CK or OK?"]]
* This wasn't always a format screw. Originally, the warning message was in the body of the SCP article itself, and then I decided to move it to the beginning, so that people would get the same "Oh shit" reaction as the Foundation. From there, I added a couple more messages that are meant to be in the moment. The email from Yolas was originally an Addendum, but I moved it to a seperate thing because I could. The excessive footnotes from Yolas were always there - it was always meant to be a first iteration of the article.
* I'm happy about how the formatting of this turned out. I had to put the SCP and the second email into divs so that I could include the footnote block within the SCP portion itself (and it also let me put in quote blocks that looked decent)
* This wasn't originally meant to be part of the Tag-Less Contest, but then I realized how little could be said about it. It works best as an SCP file, but it's really just an Extranormal Event with a lot of significance - and most tags aren't for Extranormal Events. I had to remove the explicit GoI references from the SCP to remove tags, but I'm happy with what I replaced them with.
* This is a load of dense technobabble, and is mostly incomprehensible in all honesty. It's probably too much, but the entire thing does have internal consistency with itself, and tries to explain everything. It is meant to leave the reader confused, because that's what the Foundation is feeling.
* I made sure to include mostly nonamalous methods of detection for the CSDs, so that people wouldn't just say they operate off of handwavium. Some of the methods do, but there are several others that don't.
* This has a bunch of crosslinks, including two 001s! I really hope that it doesn't feel excessive. The two times it lists of sites and dimensions probably is, but other than that they should feel natural.
