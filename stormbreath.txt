**Name:** J1-13 (Henrik Sturmatem)

**Position:** Janitor Overseer Council

**Background:** Nobody is quite sure when J1-13 first started working for the Foundation, with some rumoring that he's been around longer than the Administrator. These personnel are, of course, reminded that the Administrator doesn't actually exist and that J1-13 likely started working before the Great RAISA Fire of '94, which destroyed almost all records of Level 0 staff.

J1-13 has served without major distinction as a Foundation janitor, cleaning a large collection of random anomalies. J1-13 has shown the marked ability to not die after at least twenty years working with the Foundation, having been involved in ███ containment breaches, the majority of which involved him cowering under a table and repeatedly muttering "I went to law school for this?"

As a result of having been employed by the Foundation for an exceptionally long period of time for a janitor, Henrik Sturmatem was promoted to the J1 Council as J1-13, giving him full Level 1 Clearance. [[footnote]]The J1 Council refers to the committee consisting of the highest-ranking janitors of the Foundation. With complete access to all information regarding the cleaning of anomalies in containment, the J1 Council oversees all Foundation cleaning operations worldwide and directs its long-term cleaning plans. Due to the sensitivity of their positions, J1 Council members must --not-- come into direct contact with any anomalous object, entity, or phenomenon. Furthermore, the identities of all J1 Council members is classified; all council members are referred to only by their numeric designation (J1-1 through J1-13).[[/footnote]] This does not absolve him of any cleaning duties.

[[tab Me]]
I'm not quite sure where/when I first discovered the SCP Foundation, but it was probably sometime in 2015. This first SCP I distinctly remember reading was [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1689 SCP-1689], but I also remember plowing on through the articles in numerical order starting with SCP-002. (I know I didn't start with 001, but I'm not really sure why.)

I had some ideas for objects in that time, including:
* A cup that experienced time in reverse chronological order, so that if you tried to damage it, you'd only repair damage that had already happened, and repairing it would only cause new damage.
* A Fifthist priest that was contained by the ritual significance of the number "3" being prevalent in their life. (like, getting three square meals a day, being in a 9m x 9m x 9m containment chamber, having a designation with several 3s in it)
* A memetic statement that greatly changed brainwave patterns and gave you telekinesis ... in Dolphin. The sapient and telekinetic dolphins then formed empires and tried to stop people from killing them or putting them in zoos. (EDIT - THIS IS NOW [[[SCP-3932]]])

I never really put any of these to paper (and when I did years later, I didn't like them as I had in the past.)

After what was probably two years of lurking, I finally created an account in order to post SCP-3310. This started with a basic idea of taking a real world thing and making it an anomaly without adding much. [[footnote]] Not taking a real world thing and adding an anomaly to it, like I did with Harold Holt and SCP-3477[[/footnote]] I think one of the pitfalls of the article was that the Old Man isn't well known enough - it's not famous enough that people wouldn't immediately see it and think "Oh wow! That's a real thing I am already familiar with!", which I a large part of what I wanted.

My second SCP was the Writer of Ganymede, a giant spider thing on Ganymede that wanted to take care of humanity. It didn't do very well, and got deleted pretty quickly. I rewrote it as a Black Queen GoI article, but that ended up being somewhat bland and not particularly good. I may come back to it at some point, but I'm not sure.

I also posted an skip about an object that had become separated from it's location, and was just the location. It ended in a D-Class having the same thing happen to them, and becoming a pseudo-ghost. It wasn't very well executed, as it ready similar to a lot of other SCPs. I self-deleted it as well.

I like numbers repeating in my SCP numbers.

[[tab Commentary]]

[[collapsible show=" + SCP-3310" hide=" - The Old Man of the Lake"]]
* My idea when making this was to take a real world thing that seemed a bit paranormal and turn it into an object. I played with a couple other ideas, including the Curse of Tamerlane, but I ended up going for the Old Man.
* A lot of this article is real - there really is a log in Crater Lake, it's been there since the late 1800s, the incident about scientists removing actually happened (all of it - they removed it, there were storms immediately, they thought they pissed off the log and put it back), the myths at the end are real Klamath myths
* My intent was that the Foundation/ASCI's messing with the log has been weakening it's ability to keep Llao dead. This was more evident in the original, before I changed what Pangloss was saying. However, that wasn't really in line with his character, so he doesn't tell the Foundation they're fucking up now. The idea is that they still are.

* I rewrote this, somewhat recently. I wasn't happy with the original version, because it didn't add enough to the actual facts of the Old Man. I'm much happier with the newer execution, which has a couple good lines and such. (Pictures of the original have been uploaded to the article.)
* Since my byline on the original was that the Foundation was fucking things up, I decided to run with it and make this a Hiemal. This is both an set of interconnected anomalies that are containing each other; and something which the balance of which has been upset by the Foundation.
* I don't like {{[DATA EXPUNGED]}} as a trope, but I had to put in to cover the fact that the scientists in 1988 didn't actually see anything. Not happy with it, but it's better than the alternative.
* I removed the "every hundred years" line from this, but still have the implication that the seal is becoming weaker. There's hints that the situation is getting worse, which are carried by the final note.
* The last eruption of Mount Mazama was attributed to Llao. The last Sigma event could mean one of two things: Llao is about to break free and blow up the mountain, OR Skell can no longer keep Llao contained is going to blow up the mountain to try and stop him. Neither is very reassuring.
[[/collapsible]]
@@@@
[[collapsible show=" + SCP-3477" hide=" - Will the Real Harold Holt Please Stand Up?"]]
* This takes inspiration from a lot of different SCPs, most notably [[[SCP-2404]]] and [[[SCP-1041]]]. It's interesting that nobody has said that mine reminded me of those, because it was initially concieved as combination of those.
* The title is a bad reference.
* Harold Holt was not always the guy who became anomalous. I had decided I wanted it to be a politician or somebody famous, and then I wanted a politican who had mysteriously disappeared. It came down to either Harold Holt or Jimmy Hoffa, and I decided to go with Harold Holt because his disappearance worked a bit better. 
* One of my favorite things about this article is the amount of world building in it - the article really feels like it's an integrated part of the SCP world. The table especially references a high number of GoIs and makes several crosslinks, both of which continued in the table.
* The Great Barrier Reef Empire-In-Exile is a reference to my unwritten dolphin empire skip. (It was originally a merfolk empire, but then I thought that sapient dolphins would being easier to brush over and just accept.)
* Ottaviano Medici is from the House of Medici, specifically from the height of it's power in the 15th century. He's also immortal, but he has a much better way of maintaining it than animatronic Harold got. In short - MC&D jipped 3477-23.
* The idea of Extraordinary Special Containment Procedures were taken from [[[SCP-3072]]], although I didn't put in a crosslink there. I used it to represent instructions of what to do in the case of a breach scenario.
* I used MTF Zeta-2 because I wanted a Task Force that hadn't been used much, and was surprised to find one that had only been mentioned on the log of Extranormal Events. My headcanon is that it's primarily a humanoid recontainment task force.
* While writing, I never had an concrete number of Harold Holts that I wanted there to be in total, but now I do. I chosen the number primarily just because I liked having 34 in it (because that was always the contained number) and I liked having repeated numbers, but now I like having it be a fraction: the Foundation contained 34/77 Harold Holts, so there are 33 more.
* I don't have an answer as to which of the Harold Holts are real, or how there are so many of them. Your guess is as good as mine.

* DrChandra contacted me and asked if I wanted to collab on a full table of Harolds, so we made [[[document-3477-2|Document-3477 #2]]]. He did most of the work, and I just did some editing.
* The only instance I actually wrote for this was the Australian Selkie (-4), which was based off a now deleted SCP written by Freudian. Somebody asked if one of the instances on the main 3477 page was a reference to that (it wasn't) but I thought it would be cool to make the reference.
* Most of the crosslinks were added by me to already written instances: the 963-like hat, the tulpa and the lucky one were all written when I decided to throw out some crosslinks to similar ones. The corgi train bit served to justify faeries a little more. -18 was originally explicitly a god, but I modified that to use the same format as 3480, and crosslink to there.
* -22 originally got it's wish from "a high level reality bender" but that was just so bland and clinical. I changed it to djinn because I was able to find a crosslink that worked, and it just flows so much better.
[[/collapsible]]
@@@@
[[collapsible show=" + SCP-2684" hide=" - Where's the Beach?"]]
* I've already talked about the inspiration for this on the discussion page, but it's from the fear of briefly losing sight of the beach while swimming. 
* The title is also a bad reference.
* One of the first drafts for this had 8872, 3613 and 5327 all end up committing suicide - 8872 by intentionally drowning herself, 3613 with the knife and 5327 with the same gun the captain used. However, that was pretty cliche and I didn't like the sameness, so 8872 just drowned and 5237 starved to death.
* D-8872's crime was killing somebody (sibling/parent/spouse/child/friend) by drowning or letting them drown. Thus, she thinks she's in an ironic hell, and genuinely believes she's been damned to hell at the end.
* At one point, I had 5327 hallucinate as he's starving to death. However, because his narration was the only source of info regarding the last log, there really wouldn't be an easy way to make it explicit that he was hallucinating.
* My hope was that it'd be clear than 5327 killed 1176 after their argument, and that it'd be less clear that 5327 ate both 1176 and the captain. There aren't as many hints to those, with there only being one very subtle remark about how he ate the captain's body.
* The alternate history was meant to hammer in that this ocean is not anywhere on Earth, and that the D-Class aren't just, say, in the middle of the pacific. The other ship let me extend the amount of time that people spent in the ocean to several months. 
* The "false remains of the child" that were created as part of the cover story were a clone of the kid. That line was meant to be a "Wait, what?" moment, but may have been too subtle. [[/collapsible]]
@@@@
[[collapsible show=" + SCP-2317-J" hide=" - A Door to Another Parody"]]
* I've had the idea for this one for a while, and I finally just decided to actually write it up. This was a really quick write, only taking me about two hours of writing and little revisions. 
* The "Blackbox-Blackbox-Blackbox-Blackbox" joke was the first part of this that I originally thought of, because the idea of people actually saying "Redacted" is really funny to me.
* All of the characters (except for the D-Class) in the article were taken from the people who accessed the file in the original article, which wasn't something I had ever really paid attention to before. That said, KPC being the level 4 person allowed me to make a dog joke.
* This is oddly similar to the skip I wrote before it - short description followed by a bunch of dialogue.
* I've thought about turning this into a non-J, and I feel that parts of it could work: instead of being SCP-2317-K behind the door, some sort of interdimensional vampire would work, playing up the "can't enter unless invited" and "mind-control" tropes.

[[collapsible show=" + Project Proposal 1994-103" hide=" - A Song of Hope and Home"]]
* Adebowale is Yoruba for "the crown has come home" and is a gender neutral name.
 * The meaning of the name is super important -> Adebowale is home now.
 * I don't have an assigned gender for Adebowale as a character. Also, Adebowale is the entirety of their name in the anart community - they're one of those artists that only goes by their first names. (Like Prince or Beyonce)
* My headcanon is that AWCY? uses the same Universe classification system as the Wanderer's Library. X-### universes are meant to represent dead universes.
* The hot chocolate, coffee, tea and blankets in the materials list are so Adebowale can take care of the people after they listen to the song - it's emotionally draining, and you need some time to recover.
* The steel triangle is used for the memetic primer, and the beryllium bronze triangle is used for the memetic cleaner. The idea is that beryllium bronze stabilizes reality, and is thuse able to remove the memetic primers that the song places.
* Adebowale calls it "Pandora's Amphora", not Box. This isn't just them being poetic or descriptive: my idea is that everyone calls it an amphora in their home reality, and this is one of those few subtle differences between worlds.
* A large part of the inspiration for this as I was writing was my failure to convey 100% of the emotion and imagery I've felt through writing. I've always wanted to just be able to put the ideas into somebody else's head, so they actually //know//.
* The original idea of this piece was just a song that took viewers to a beautiful sight. When I was writing, I had the realization that the most beatiful things we see aren't objective, but subjective, so for someone else to think something was incredibly beautiful you'd need to give them the same experiences as you. This led me to the idea of the narrator having gone through extreme hardship before seeing the sight, and that being the main reason they thought it was beautiful.

* This has now been linked to on SCP-2753. To explain what happened in that: Adebowale initially created the piece sometime between 1984 and 1988, and then showed it at anart festivals around the world. One of these was unfortunately destroyed as a result of a jenga accident, but Adebowale turned out okay and decided to submit the piece to the 1994 Expo.

[[collapsible show=" + SCP-3557" hide=" - CK or OK?"]]
* This wasn't always a format screw. Originally, the warning message was in the body of the SCP article itself, and then I decided to move it to the beginning, so that people would get the same "Oh shit" reaction as the Foundation. From there, I added a couple more messages that are meant to be in the moment. The email from Yolas was originally an Addendum, but I moved it to a seperate thing because I could. The excessive footnotes from Yolas were always there - it was always meant to be a first iteration of the article.
* I'm happy about how the formatting of this turned out. I had to put the SCP and the second email into divs so that I could include the footnote block within the SCP portion itself (and it also let me put in quote blocks that looked decent)
* This wasn't originally meant to be part of the Tag-Less Contest, but then I realized how little could be said about it. It works best as an SCP file, but it's really just an Extranormal Event with a lot of significance - and most tags aren't for Extranormal Events. I had to remove the explicit GoI references from the SCP to remove tags, but I'm happy with what I replaced them with.
* This is a load of dense technobabble, and is mostly incomprehensible in all honesty. It's probably too much, but the entire thing does have internal consistency with itself, and tries to explain everything. It is meant to leave the reader confused, because that's what the Foundation is feeling.
* I made sure to include mostly nonamalous methods of detection for the CSDs, so that people wouldn't just say they operate off of handwavium. Some of the methods do, but there are several others that don't.
* This has a bunch of crosslinks, including two 001s! I really hope that it doesn't feel excessive. The two times it lists of sites and dimensions probably is, but other than that they should feel natural.

* There were troubles in getting this to site, but we managed to get it working as a Canon. It's now official and everything, so I've done that.

* Hy-Brasil being a Nexus is something I've always liked the idea of, not just in the SCP-verse. I've thought of it as one of those places where magic could still exist, and I'm very happy to have gotten it published and doing well.

* This was an attempt to do a very simple SCP: under 500 words, no footnotes, no addenda. I wanted to do something in the polar opposite of what I normally did.
* The idea from this was literally just a dream in which some people killed God by shooting him from the future.
* SCP-3797-ARC was a non-human reality altering entity that was a god (but the Foundation hates that word). If the GOC knew about it, they'd classify it as an Ex Machina Threat Entity.
* The best part of this - to me - was being able to use the future perfect in an article and having that be the only accurate tense to describe what was going on. I love the future perfect.

[[tab Headcanons]]
+ Small Foundation
* The Small Foundation is the most realistic of my headcanons, and is drastically different from a normal interpretation of the Foundation-verse.
* In Small Foundation, the Foundation is defined by it's small size. They don't have much of a budget, anomalies are rare, and it's very possible for them to conceal everything.
* The Foundation contains, perhaps, ten unique anomalies a year. They don't have more than 500 objects in containment at any given time. It's much smaller than the normal interpretation.
* D-Class don't exist. At all.
* Most GoIs do not exist, and are incompatible with the headcanon. The few that would are: Nobody, ORIA, Chicago Spirit, Black Queen, Serpent's Hand
* The Foundation, in Small Foundationverse, can justify their ideology of containment by being the only game in town. I feel this is a major weak point in most views of Foundationverse.
* 001 Proposal: WJS

+ Mystic Foundation
* Mystic Foundation, as I would describe it, is the closest the Foundation could get to being released as an actual work of fiction/TV/movie.
* The biggest defining feature of the Mystic Foundation is that there are very few "random" anomalies - everything tends to relate to something larger. There are causes and effects - but most importantly, anomalies don't just //happen//.
* In a major department from the normal values of the Foundation, the Mystic Foundation's goal is to maintain the Masquerade and keep BOTH the anomalous and the mundane safe: they don't hate the anomalous, and they are a lot friendlier to it.
* Mystic Foundation runs a couple places for humanoid anomalies to live that aren't just prisons - remember, these guys don't hate the anomalous. Dangerous humanoid anomalies get the prison treatment, but Cactusman, Major Alexei Belatrov or T-Flex? Unecessary.
* Mystic Foundation, in keeping with their stated goals, is a lot more willing to utilize the anomalous in containment of the anomalous - they don't have a problem with it. Their goal is safety.
* This is, imo, the most moral and good of the Foundations.
* GoIs: Broken God, Sarkicism, Fifthism, Factory, Wondertainment, Nobody, Pangloss, Oneiroi,  Serpent's Hand, maybe Prometheus Labs
* 001 Proposal: Spikebrennan's, Tanhony's, Clef's
 * Kalinin's could reasonably exist here

+ Big Foundation
* Big Foundation is where I give up completely on any remote sense of realism, because nothing about any of SCP-verse even comes close to making sense in the slighest.
 * I could go on for hours about all the things I find unrealistic. I won't here. If you're curious, hit me up on IRC.
 * But basically, the only way SCP-verse makes sense is if you give up trying to make it make sense.
* In Big Foundation, **//everything//** is canon, by which I mean everything. The world has been destroyed and reset a billion times, every SCP exists, there were three King Arthurs, and nothing makes sense.
* The Big Foundation is where all the BIG tech comes into play - SRAs, Reality Sinks, L-Cannons, you name it, it's here and it's powerful. Every GoI exists, and they all have interplay with each other.
* GoIs: All of them
* 001 Proposal: All of them

[[tab Underrated]]
I hear a lot of things about "underrated" articles (especially on r/SCP) and such SCPs are very rarely actually underrated - in my opinion, anything above a +100 is not underrated by any means. Also - new stuff is rarely actually underrated, it just hasn't been here long enough. This isn't really a list of my favorite SCPs per se (those don't need more attention, really) but I do like all of the stuff here.

**[[[SCP-2931]]]:** This is a short and simple creepy SCP, and it does it well. It's an excellent usage of fridge horror, with a good wham line at the end.

**[[[SCP-1102]]]:** This is one of my favorite SCPs ever - it's atmospheric, creepy and mythical. The imagery is very good, and I like the picture it paints of the Foundation in their attempt to figure things out. It's very thematic and cool - I love it.

**[[[SCP-4023-EX]]]:** My problem with a LOT of -EX anomalies is that they aren't really -EXs in spirit. A lot of them still have an anomalous thing running around. This, however, is an actual -EX: something that the Foundation thought was anomalous, did more research on, and found out it wasn't -EX. This has nice science, and actually does the -EX format justice.

**[[[SCP-2486]]]:** This is a great usage of crosslinks and how they can improve an SCP. The base SCP is neat, but it's with the crosstesting that it really shines. The theme is cool, and it's funny and evocative.

**[[[SCP-2654]]]:** I love this. It's short, simple, bizarre and also creepy in a way that the article barely even focuses on. Getting woken up by a naked genie in the middle of the night and being asked for snack foods would be disturbing, and then it answers whatever you asked a magic 8-ball. It's funny and evocative, while still being off-putting.

**[[[SCP-2948]]]:** This is great for showing just how dangerous a Safe can be. It's also creative and has a good story with the doctor which shows a more human side to the Foundation, which I always like.

* [[[http://ja.scp-wiki.net/scp-3477|Japanese Translation]]] of SCP-3477 by [[*user C-Dives]] [[footnote]] I found another [[[https://www49.atwiki.jp/aniwotawiki/pages/38046.html|Japanese translation of SCP-3477]]], but that doesn't seem as good - the formatting isn't there, and reading through the Google translate of it seems more like a discussion of the SCP rather than the SCP itself. That said, it has a translation of Document-3477 #2, which the main Japanese site doesn't.[[/footnote]]
