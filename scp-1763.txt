**Item #:** SCP-1763

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The stairwell leading into the basement containing SCP-1763 is to be kept closed at all times, and guarded from the inside by two security personnel. A clearance level of 2 or higher is required for entrance. Personnel interested in viewing video records of performance incidents are to contact Dr. Howder.

**Description:** SCP-1763 is a Class-4 (reclassified from Class-3 following incident 1763-64) interdimensional portal located in the basement of ████ West 38th Street, New York City, NY[[footnote]]Independent shows not necessarily associated with Broadway Theater are common in this area of New York City.[[/footnote]]. At the time SCP-1763 was discovered, 76 folding chairs had been set up facing SCP-1763, in a formation typical of a proscenium space. While there is no box office, a metal bowl is placed on a small table at the entrance to the seating area with the label "donations". Any objects placed in the bowl will disappear at exactly one hour following the end of any performance incident. One hour before a performance incident, 40 to 70 programs will appear beside the bowl, detailing the performance that will take place along with a brief summary of the social context of the performance and an overlook of the organization performing the piece. Throughout Foundation containment of SCP-1763, only one organization has performed; however, several programs indicate that previous "companies" have made use of the venue.

The reality visible within SCP-1763 appears to be a proscenium-arch-type stage, with two permanent sets of curtains[[footnote]]These curtains are rarely used, as per trends among contemporary theatre.[[/footnote]]. The theatre is mainly constructed from wood[[footnote]]which will typically be painted over in order to match with the current production[[/footnote]], with metal scaffolding above the stage[[footnote]]Note that this is exclusively used for prop work; no lighting units are apparent.[[/footnote]]. This stage area is designated SCP-1763-1.

SCP-1763-1 is currently used as a theatre venue by a large company designated SCP-1763-A. This company will perform on a monthly basis, with limited runs during the last full week of the month from Monday to Saturday. Shows typically start at 18:00 and run until 20:00 - 22:00, with a 15 - 20 minute intermission. There may also be a matinee on Fridays or Saturdays at 2:00. Alongside these regular performances, SCP-1763-A may also produce children's shows, stand-up comedy, or improvised theatre [[footnote]]Due to SCP-1763's nature, there is no audience participation in this form of improvisation.[[/footnote]].

Members of SCP-1763-A show numerous anomalous properties. SCP-1763-A-1[[footnote]]The director of most productions.[[/footnote]] is an incorporeal entity which operates through mechanical hands extending inwards from off-stage, SCP-1763-A-5, -6, and -12 are entirely skeletal, SCP-1763-A-7 and -8 possess two sets of arms, and SCP-1763-A-13 appears to be a member of //Homo neanderthalis//. Players may or may not be type-casted depending on their appearance.

Construction of the set begins two weeks before opening, with dress rehearsals occurring three days before opening. Pieces performed by SCP-1763-A vary widely. Approximately one quarter of all performances correspond to existing plays. Thus far, the perceived cost of a production and the frequencies of production have not changed with audience attendance or the amount donated.

Attempts to interact with the space within SCP-1763 have so far been unsuccessful. Tunneling around and into SCP-1763's apparent space leads to a mirror image of SCP-1763.
