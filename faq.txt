+++ General Questions

**Is SCP real?**

No. We are a creative writing website. All the SCPs are fictional. The Foundation is fictional.

**How can I join the SCP Foundation?**

Go to our [http://www.scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:join Join Page]. Remember to follow all the instructions.

**Can the memetic hazards hurt me? Will I die if I ignore a security warning? Will anything happen to me in real life from reading these pages?**

No. The "memetic hazards" are just random pictures. The security warnings are just to tell the reader how much the Foundation thinks these things are important and scary. They're not real.

**I saw an SCP! / I think I am an SCP! What do I do?**

No, you didn't. SCPs are fiction that we wrote. Also, we are not a roleplaying site!

**Do you all write this stuff, or did someone else?**

We wrote all this stuff. We are a community of writers.

**I want to create a project based on the SCP Foundation. Can I do that?**

Yes! See our [[[Licensing Guide]]] for more information. The short version:
* Yes, you can make money off of anything -- //except the image of [[[SCP-173]]].// But you must follow the license.
* The Creative Commons license means anyone else can copy and profit off of anything you make if they wish.
* You do have to credit us and link our site.
* No, we can't take off the Creative Commons license. Not "won't" -- //"can't"//.
* Yes, we will help you sort out licensing confusion if you ask.

**I have a question about Containment Breach.**

We are not the official site for Containment Breach, because we didn't create Containment Breach. Check out its official site here: http://www.scpcbgame.com/

**I have a question about TheVolgun's voiceover work.**

We are not the official site for TheVolgun's (awesome) work. Check out their Youtube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/user/TheVolgun

**Why is the age limit 15?**

Because fifteen is the age when most people are mature enough to be part of our community.

**I'm mature enough, but I'm not 15. Can you make an exception?** 

No, sorry. Even if it's true, //everyone// says that. Plus, it wouldn't be fair to everyone else who follows the rules. If you tell us you're under fifteen, or if we figure it out, we have to ban you.

However, unless you're a jerk about it, we'll be happy to let you in as soon as you turn fifteen.

**Can I draw or make artwork about an SCP? Can I show you?**

Absolutely! Post away in our [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/c-662937/fan-work Fan Work forum]. You can also post on [http://visual-records.wikidot.com/ Visual Records] -- anyone can join, even if they're not a member here.

+++ Questions About SCPs & Stories

**Will I die if I scroll down and read SCP-001? Can I click on SCP-2000?**

You'll be perfectly fine if you scroll down on read SCP-001. Yes, you can click on SCP-2000. This is true for all SCPs like this. You're supposed to read everything. These are works of fiction -- they can't hurt you.

**Which SCPs should I read?**

The biggest tip we can give you is: Don't ONLY read Series 1. Series 1 is great, but right now we're working on Series 2 and Series 3. Try reading an equal number of SCPs from each series. Also, read some [[[Foundation Tales]]] too!

Also, you can ask on the forums or in [[[chat guide|our IRC chat]]] for peoples' recommendations.

**There is an SCP that does something, but I don't remember the number. Can you help?**

Probably! Ask around in [[[chat guide|chat]]] and we might be able to help you. You can also try [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-1082671/trying-to-find-an-scp-or-tale-but-don-t-remember-the-name this forum thread].

**How come there are so many contradictions? What is canon?**

The SCP Foundation is built on contradiction! There are many canons. There is no one completely correct view. The only exception is if a certain view is (1) too "off-concept" to be accepted by the readers, or (2) too silly in a bad way.

In-character, the Foundation may put false and contradictory information in "public" versions of SCP articles as a security measure.

**What's the correct spelling: amnestic, or amnesiac?**

The correct spelling is "amnestic". "Amnesiac" means "a person who has amnesia".

Note: A few older authors have chosen to keep the old spelling. Please don't fix the error yourself if you see it; ask staff to take a look instead.

**What's up with D-Class? Are they really from death row? Are they really killed at the end of the month?**

Only sometimes. Check out [[[Security Clearance Levels]]] for more information on D-Class.

**Is [[[SCP-173]]] based on the Weeping Angels? Or the Endermen?** 

Nope. SCP-173 was created in 2007, a couple of months before the Weeping Angels. That's a coincidence. The Endermen were created in 2010, much later.

+++ Questions About Writing SCPs & Other Writing Questions

**How do I write an SCP? Where do I submit an SCP?**

Read the [[[How to Write an SCP]]] for a step-by-step guide!

**I wrote an SCP. Do you want to see it?**

Yes, of course. Please show it to us before posting, although you don't have to. And please read [[[How to Write an SCP]]] even if you've already written it.

Then, make a page (named after you) on the [http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/ sandbox wiki]. Then post the link on the [http://www.scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum:start forums] and/or in [[[chat guide|chat]]]. 

**Can I just post an SCP without any feedback?**

Yes, you can. But please don't! Please read the [[[How to Write an SCP]]] guide and show it to us first. 

Once you get enough feedback, and most people think it looks good, //then// post it.

You can take the risk and "cold post" it with no feedback. But we may yell at you if it's bad.

**What if my friends like it?**

Show it to us anyway! We may have different standards than your friends.

**Why don't you like my SCP?** 

Usually, we'll tell you. Hard to shut us up about it, in fact. Remember, though, we're critiquing your //writing//, not //you//.

**How do I become a good writer?**

(1) Practice writing a lot and (2) listen to feedback, and usually you will be able to create something good.

**Can I cross-test? Can I use crosslinks?**

Yes. Please read the Crosslinks guide in [[[How To Write An SCP]]] first.

**Can I use an author avatar?**

Yes. Just try not to get too silly. Please listen to us if we tell you that something is wrong with what you wrote.

**But people are saying I can't do those things at all!**

They are wrong. Some people still repeat outdated information. You can do all these things, but please do them well.

**Can I reserve an SCP number on the list?**

No, you cannot. SCP numbers are first come, first serve.

**Can I write something from a thing I read or watched as an SCP?**

Nope. SCPs have to be original work. (Same for Tales.)

**Can I use other authors' characters and SCPs in what I write?** 

Yes, you can. If the author is still around, it's even better if you ask them for their advice first. But you don't have to.

**When can I post an author page?**

Once you have three positively-rated SCPs and/or tales. Any combination of SCPs and tales are fine, so long as the total number is three.

**How can I add something to the list of [[[the things Dr. Bright is not allowed to do at the Foundation]]]?**

You can post on the discussion thread for the list page with your suggestions. If Bright or the rest of us like them, we'll add them. 

However, fair warning, a lot of us are tired of hearing these suggestions, including Bright!

+++ Community & Staff Questions

**How can I contribute if I'm not a good writer?**

Just be friendly and hang out with us! If you can give good critique, awesome. If you have some technical skills, or can help out with other things, awesome. But just being cool is generally enough.

**Why is everyone mean to me?**

No one should be mean to you for no reason... but giving harsh critique or pointing out bad behavior is not mean. Check our [[[Site Rules]]] and our [[[Criticism Policy]]]. If someone's following that, then they're fine. If not, then you can let staff know.

**Is that <other site member> single?**

That is not your business, and it doesn't matter if they're single or not! This is not a dating website. Hitting on other users is a terrible idea. And if you creep people out, you'll get banned pretty quick.

**Why does (Kalinin/Bright/etc) hate everything?**

They don't actually hate everything. If they did, they wouldn't care enough to be here. They're just harsh critics, with high personal standards. 

**Can I change someone else's article?**

You can only edit for grammar, punctuation, and spelling. Otherwise, please leave a comment in the article's discussion thread requesting a change. You can also send a message to the author, or to the [http://05command.wikidot.com/rewrite-main rewrite team].

**Where is (insert member of senior staff)?**

Hang out in [[[chat guide|chat]]] and see if they show up. Or find their member page [http://www.scp-wiki.net/members-pages here] and send them a message. Please note that some people have permanently left the community and aren't around anymore.

Please keep in mind that just because someone has a staff character does not mean they are actually staff. For example, "Real Life" Bright and Clef are real site staff, but "Real Life" Kondraki is not.

**How do I become staff?** 

A good way is to post an explanation of why you want to be staff in [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-1023953/ this thread]. An even better way is to be a friendly, low-drama person, and offer to help people with things. The best way is to do both.

Please note that it is very hard to become staff unless you are on [[[Chat Guide|the IRC chat]]].

**Am I allowed to read the posts on the admin site, [http://05command.wikidot.com/ O5 Command]?**

Yes, you can read those! A lot of new people think they're not supposed to be reading that site and might get in trouble for it. But you're fine. Read away. It's public for a reason. (The stuff that isn't public, you won't accidentally find, so don't worry.)

+++ Bonus Answers

**In-character, what is the SCP Foundation?** 

We are the last bastion of security in a world where natural laws rapidly break down. We are here to protect humanity from the things that go bump in the night, from people who wield power beyond mortal understanding. We are here to make the world a safer place. We are the holders of wonders, and the crafters of dreams. We are why the world continues.

See also [[[About The SCP Foundation]]].

**What does "SCP" stand for?** 

"Special Containment Procedures" and the motto "Secure. Contain. Protect."

**How long has this site been around?** 

Basically, the original SCP ([[[SCP-173]]]) was written back in 2007, the first incarnation of this wiki (on editthis.info) was made in early 2008, and we moved to Wikidot in the middle of that year.

Read [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-228926/site-history|this forum post]]] and the [[[history-of-the-universe-hub|site history essay]]] for more. 

**Do you guys want pictures that other writers can use in their SCPs?**

Yes, definitely! We have a really cool **[http://visual-records.wikidot.com/ Visual Records]** site where you can upload art or pictures. The Visual Records wiki is currently in open registration, just hit Join in the sidebar to become a member. There are also SCP fuel images, if you want to contribute to those.

The best images you can contribute are images that you own yourself! You can either give us permission to use them while retaining your copyright, or release them to Creative Commons.
