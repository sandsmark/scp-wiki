[[tab The Site]]
+++ The Site

**Is this real?** No. This is a collaborative writing website.

**What is [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/|the Foundation]]]?** We are the last bastion of security in a world where natural laws rapidly break down. We are here to protect humanity from the things that go bump in the night, from people who wield power beyond mortal understanding. We are here to make the world a safer place. We are the holders of wonders, and the crafters of dreams. We are why the world continues. In the short form, we're a creative writing site, devoted towards horror.

**What does SCP stand for?** "Special Containment Procedures". We generally go with "the Foundation". It also stands for the site motto: "Secure. Contain. Protect."

**How long has this site been around, anyway?** Read  [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-228926/site-history|this forum post]]] and the [[[history-of-the-universe-hub|site history essay]]] for details. Basically, the original SCP ([[[SCP-173]]]) was written back in 2007, the first incarnation of this wiki (on editthis.info) was made in early 2008, and we moved to Wikidot in the middle of that year.

**Have the owners of the wiki ever considered expanding their universe to other media (television, film, podcasts, etc.)?** Yes. We haven't been presently officially endorsing anything besides a few podcasts, but our wider fan community has created many impressive pieces of media, notably [http://www.scpcbgame.com/ SCP: Containment Breach].

**Should I join if I don't want to write an SCP?** Sure. It's totally up to you. However: if you wish to vote, comment, or edit, you do need to join.

**Is this a roleplaying site?** No. Some writers have usernames that are the same as characters or 'author avatars' that they created on the site, but we don't pretend to be our characters while posting. A good rule of thumb is that Dr/Agent/Whatever (Name) is the character, while (Name) is the writer.

**Can I roleplay anyway?** Not on the main wiki. The site is out-of-character only. RPing can be done elsewhere; ask around in [http://www.scp-wiki.net/chat-guide chat] if you want to find out more.

**What if I just write myself as a character?** You can; it's pretty common. Keep in mind that self-inserts are automatically judged negatively until the quality of the character is established. Over the top avatars are typically not thought of very well around here anymore. This goes double for avatars who are supposed to be funny or awesome or your idealized self.

**I have some really awesome art that I made, where can I post it?** We have a really cool **[http://visual-records.wikidot.com/ Visual Records]** site where you can upload art of your very own. The Visual Records wiki is currently in open registration, just hit Join in the sidebar to become a member. There are also SCP fuel images, if you want to contribute to those.

**How do I get to know the SCP Foundation better?** Read as many SCPs and tales as you can. Seriously, that's the easiest way. Also, consider reading newer SCPs, not just older SCPs.

**What are all those [REDACTED] and [DATA EXPUNGED] that are everywhere?** They are information removed from the article, generally in order to make it scarier.  While most writers know what is behind the removal, they are unwilling to tell. It's a lot worse when you have to imagine what it is. Note: Don't redact information (besides site locations) in the containment procedures. In-universe, all information in containment procedures must be available to all Foundation personnel, in case they need to contain the SCP object and these procedures are all they have. 

**Why does the Foundation keep this SCP around? Why don't they just destroy/kill it?** Well, for starters, if you've read our motto, you know SCP stands for Secure, Contain, Protect, not Destroy, Destroy, Destroy. Most of the objects and people the Foundation houses are being kept for study, which is not at all the same as sitting on death row. Why obliterate something when you have enough resources to try to discover how it works? (That said, if we destroyed everything, we wouldn't have much of a site, would we?)

**Why am I being asked for my password?** No one on staff will **ever** ask you for your password. If you think that's what they're asking for, you might want to read again. If anyone //does// ask for your real-life password, please let staff know.

**Is this the entire FAQ?** Nope! Scroll up and click on the other tabs to read the rest.

[[tab SCPs]]
+++ SCPs

**I got an idea for an SCP! What do I do?** The [[[How to Write an SCP]]] guide explains how to conceive, write, format, and post an SCP. Short answer: You can make an account on the [http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/ sandbox wiki], post your drafts there, and  share the link with people on the forums and the Realtime Chat. When you're satisfied that you've received enough feedback, go ahead and post it. Or, you can take the plunge and just post it directly to the wiki, with no feedback. This isn't recommended, but it's completely up to you. The worst that will happen is your piece getting deleted.

**There's already one or more SCPs really similar to my idea! What do I do?** Try to come up with a totally new spin on it. Don't just change a few details, mind you. Try to make it unique, or surprising. Or, write something else.

**But I can't think of a new idea! What do I do?** Relax. Don't panic. Inspiration will come to you eventually. Many of our writers go months without posting anything, simply because the inspiration isn't there. And that's fine. For more on getting ideas, see "Developing Thoughts" in [[[How To Write An SCP]]]. Also, check out the various challenges in the forums, or ask around in chat. There are always people with ideas that they just don't have time to write up.

**How do I know if there is already one or more SCPs really similar to my idea?** If you can't be arsed to search the site, ask around in chat. Someone will know.

**How is the number for my new SCP chosen?** Just pick an empty one and fill it. Some people prefer to take the next available slot, some don't. Up to you.

**Can I kill SCP-XXXX?** Of course you can. In a tale, not in an article. Anything can happen in your tales, because you don't have to stick to any canon.

**I keep hearing that phrase, 'There is no canon'. What does it mean?** This is a bit outdated; it's better phrased as "there are infinite canons". The point is that you can decide what other stories or articles to consider when writing your own article. It's perfectly okay to ignore what's been written. Of course, if you take things too far off the concept, your article may be downvoted into oblivion. 

**What are examples of going "off concept"?** Think of it this way: //tone// is canon, but the actual details are generally open for exploration. Just because, say, someone has written a story where [[[SCP-343]]] claims he can't do anything to [[[SCP-682]]], doesn't mean you can't write a story where he whales on the reptile like nobody's business. But if you write this in a style or tone that doesn't fit what's already on the site - like making 682 a wacky mutant elephant, and adding a version of [[[http://www.scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-076|SCP-076-2]]] who can shoot Goku's Spirit Bomb - then we're going to downvote. Also, try to keep your characters in character. Gears doesn't display emotion. Bright is bound to [[[SCP-963]]]. Rights is a mother. Mann is willing to go to extremes for the sake of research. You don't have to use previously written characters, but if you do, and you write them out of character, people will likely be unhappy.

**Do all D-class get terminated at the end of the month? Are they really all death row inmates?** Nope. This used to be stated in our background material, as a sort of "party line" told to researchers so they don't object to subjecting these people to horrible things. But almost no one actually believed that. Check out our updated [[[Security Clearance Levels]]] page for more current information.

**Which class of amnestic is the strongest?** Up to you. Different articles have different takes on this. Some articles say Class A is the strongest, some say Class A is the weakest, and some articles use alternate classification systems or don't specify.

**How do you spell "amnestic/amnesiac"?** "Amnestic" is the correct spelling, used in most new articles. "Amnesiac" is the classic spelling, still used by some authors, and it actually means "a person affected by amnesia". You //will// get downvoted by some people for using the classic spelling, because, well, it's a goofy error that old articles accidentally made popular. But you can use it if you want.

**My article/story/whatever is very similar to another article/story/whatever. Can I still post it?** As long as it's sufficiently different to be new and exciting. Otherwise, it is likely to be deleted.

**Can I cross-test other SCPs in my article?** Yes, you certainly can. However, be aware that bad cross-testing can garner downvotes. Check out our guide to cross-testing (and crosslinking in general) on the "Crosslinks" tab of [[[How To Write An SCP]]].

**What is a -D?** [[[http://www.scp-wiki.wikidot.com/decommissioned-scps|A decommissioned article.]]] One that was so bad (out of universe), we couldn't just delete it, but had to actively put it out of its misery.

**What is a -ARC?** [[[http://www.scp-wiki.wikidot.com/archived-scps|An archived SCP]]]. One that might not be real good, but is kept around because either the staff like it, or it has been used in surviving stories. -ARCs are much rarer these days; ask around if you'd like more information.

**What is a -EX?** [[[http://www.scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-ex|An "explained" SCP]]]. This is a particular genre of SCP that addresses phenomena that would once have been considered inexplicable or unnatural, but for which regular science later developed an explanation. Read through the extant -EXs to get an idea of what they look like.

**What is a -J?** [[[http://www.scp-wiki.wikidot.com/joke-scps|A joke SCP]]]. The main rule about -J's is that they have to be funny. Once upon a time we allowed SCP-ified versions of things from other fictions as -J's, but that got cut out during the mass edit. A -J has to be funny, not just a failed regular SCP.

**Can I decommission an SCP?** No. Decomms are special occasions, and generally, decomms no longer fit the theme of the site.

**Can I use something from an anime/tv show/movie/comic book/something else I'm into as an SCP?** No. SCPs should be original. If your idea is "An X from Y," you're probably going about things the wrong way.

**Is an SCP's Object Class a community decision, or entirely up to the creator of the SCP?** Object Classes have specific definitions, found on the [[[Object Classes]]] pages. Try to assign your SCP the Object Class that best fits. If you're not sure what class your SCP falls under, there's nothing wrong with asking.

**What exactly is Procedure 110-Montauk, from [[[SCP-231]]]?** It's meant to be something extremely horrifying. Originally it was, yes, meant to involve rape of some kind, though you aren't //obligated// to take that as canon. (so long as you don't tell other people they're just reading too much into it; no, they're not). Please, stop asking what exactly it is. Asking about it as a newbie is a good way to get us to hate you. Coming up with your own theories is a good way to get us to //really// hate you. That's crossing the line into //you// being creepy. So just don't do it.

**[[[SCP-173]]] is totally based on the weeping angels, right?** No, actually! 173 came out a couple of months before the weeping angels. And way before the Endermen.

**Mainlist SCPs have to be scary, right?** Absolutely not. Yes, we're primarily a horror site, but articles can evoke any number of emotions, not just fear.

**Okay, but being funny is just for -Js, right?** No. A mainlist SCP can be funny. It just can't be //a joke//. A -J means the author is essentially saying "but not really". Putting a funny SCP in the main list means: even though this is funny, it's still at least theoretically a real thing in-universe.

[[tab Critique]]
+++ About Critique

**Why are you guys so mean?** We try not to actually be mean, but we also aren't always going to sugarcoat. We prefer to be straightforward. If this is something you can't handle, it's likely that this is not the site for you.

**Are there "right" and "wrong" ways to give criticism on an article?** Yes. Don't be an asshole. You don't have to say nice things, but focus your criticism on the article. Don't attack the author. For more information, see the [[[Criticism Policy]]].

**Why are people criticizing/downvoting my article or idea?** Because they don't like it. Just because you think an idea is great doesn't mean it is. It doesn't mean we think //you// suck. If you can't handle being told something of yours sucks, this isn't the right site for you.

**This got decent feedback in the forums. Why is it getting downvoted?** Unfortunately, sometimes you might get feedback from newbies who don't yet know what they're talking about, or older users who've never successfully written anything, and may not yet understand our standards for various personal reasons. Try to get some feedback from experienced writers. And be patient. Going into chat is usually the best way to get eyes quicker.

**What are some things that generally cause an article to accumulate downvotes?** Everyone has a different reason for downvoting. But, some common reasons: Bad grammar, poor writing, an idea done in a cliche way, or failing to write in the clinical tone of the Foundation.

[[tab Wiki Etiquette]]
+++ About Wiki Etiquette

**What happens when I write a SCP article/story/creepypasta that people don't like?** Once it hits -10, a member of staff will call for a deletion on the article's discussion page. If they can get three other members of staff to agree to it, the page is deleted. If there is discussion, and someone thinks it can be saved, we go from there. See the [[[Deletions Guide]]] for more information.

**Is there a penalty for having an article deleted?** Absolutely none.

**Can I put my article back up after it has been deleted?** Yes, as long as you have sufficiently edited the article to make it better. While some ideas are better off just leaving to die, some just need a lot of work.

**How many times am I allowed to repost an SCP/story idea that got deleted?** As many times as you can rewrite it to improve it. Never post the same deleted version.

**Can I upvote my article to prevent it being deleted?** No, not unless someone has maliciously downvoted your article. If this is the case, bring the malicious downvote to staff's attention.

**Can I downvote the articles by someone I don't like, to make a point?** No, and don't be an asshole. This is called 'malicious downvoting' and is against the rules.

**Man, I really want to delete my own article. Can I do it myself, or do I have to wait for staff?** You are always free to delete your own work, no matter the vote. Just make sure you're actually deleting it, and not just renaming it. To delete a page you created, click the "+Options" link at the bottom of the page, and select delete. Make sure you check the "delete completely" box, though, or you'll just rename the page and piss us all off. Read the [[[Deletions Guide]]] for details.

**Can I just ask staff to delete my article right away?** Yes.

**Where do deleted pages go?** Oblivion. Wikidot doesn't cache deleted pages in any form, including the discussion pages. If you want to back up your own work and/or any critiques you received from it, it's entirely up to you to do so. We don't keep them around because we don't want to clutter up the site.

**So I have this great idea to make an article better, I can just dive in and change whatever I want, right?** Absolutely not. While this is a wiki, we're a little bit more strict on who can edit what than most wikis. Spelling is generally okay. Grammar... if it's something that doesn't change intent, it's okay, but not everyone has perfect grammar. Adding, taking away, or otherwise altering any article is not okay without consent from the author, or from the [http://05command.wikidot.com/rewrite-main rewrite team] if the author is missing.

**What is the password?** You need to read the [[[Guide to Newbies]]] to find this out.

**My application has been rejected. What can I do?** Check out the "I Got Denied!" tab on the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/system:join Join page].

**Is it kosher to go through and comment on every article?** No. We have around 4000 articles at the time of writing; you aren't going to have something interesting to say about all of them. This well get especially annoying if you just post on a whole lot of old article threads at once. You can still write a shitload of comments, but make sure they have sufficient content to merit making them.

**Do we have to ask permission to use other authors' characters and SCPs in our stories?** No, you don't. But it's often more polite to ask, especially if you want to get their SCPs or characters right.

[[tab Chat Etiquette]]
+++ About Chat Etiquette

**How can I get along in chat?** Read the [[[Chat Guide]]] and just generally try to be a cool person. This tab is short because all //vital// things should be covered in the Chat Guide.

**Hey, I'm running this idea by the chat and no one is looking at it. What should I do?** Wait a bit, then try again. The chat doubles as a social hangout, so it may take a while to get people's attention. Whatever you do, don't spam your link. It just pisses people off.

**Oh no there is a troll! What do I do?** Whether it's a troll or a spammer, don't feed them. Meaning, don't respond to them. Both want attention. Don't give it to them. Feel free to ping a channel operator.

[[tab Staff Etiquette]]
+++ About Staff Etiquette

**Who are the Staff?** They're the people under the Senior Staff tab in [[[guide-to-newbies|The Guide to Newbies]]]. Staff are the people who run the site. They've been around for a while, have shown an interest or strength useful to the site, and generally know what they're talking about.  You don't need to know all of them, but //you are required to know who they are when you encounter them//. There are four levels of Staff.
# Junior Staff are probationary staff members. They aren't yet listed on the Guide to Newbies page. They are otherwise the same as Operational Staff.
# Operational Staff are regular staff members. They (and moderators, and jr staff) specialize in one of ten staff teams. This may be anything from encouraging and enforcing good critique, to fielding questions about Creative Commons licensing, to running one of our social media pages. They also have the ability to vote for article deletions and call a stop to conversations.
# Moderators work the same as regular staff members, but with additional practical power. They have the power to delete articles, edit/delete other users' forum posts, or both. Some moderators also lead a staff team or two.
# Admins determine site-wide policy. They can override other users, but use this power sparingly. Due to the way wikidot is set up, admins also have to personally handle applications. Finally, one site administrator who is considered a stable, neutral party amongst other administrators is also chosen to be the site owner; this is presently [[user DrEverettMann]].

**No staff are around! Who are some people to ask for help?** It might actually be better if you just waited until a member of staff was around. Nothing on this site is especially time sensitive, but if you really need help, send a wikidot PM to someone. Several of us check our computers multiple times over the course of the day, so don't be afraid to write.

**Can we ask why so-and-so was banned?** Yes, you may.

[[tab Harsh Answers]]
+++ Harsh Answers

> **This tab is not meant to be taken as seriously as the rest of this FAQ.** This is where we give mean, but true, answers to common bad questions. You have been warned.

**<Veteran Member> is being mean to my article!?** Yes, and? Did you read our [[[Criticism Policy]]]? Are they breaking any rules?

**No, but I want them to stop!** It's not going to happen. That's just how we are. If we actually are being mean, and you aren't just misreading our sarcasm, there's a reason for it.

**I put my SCP up for review and not that many people responded. Then I posted it and it was rejected. But it's their fault!** HAHAHAHAHAno. Seriously, deleted SCPs are a part of life. Deal.

**I have an awesome site and am currently the admin there. May I please have admin here?** No. We do not know who you are. We do not know your site. We do not care if you are those guys from Penny Arcade, when you join up here, you start out as a regular user. Eventually, if you're not a moron, you might move up. If you actually do help out, that's very likely. But you actually have to do shit.

**I own an IRC channel on the synIRC network and it is quite successful. May I please have admin in our chat?** Fuck no. Stop being stupid.

**When a mod says "Stop" they mean, "Talk louder and more stupid", right?** Were you dropped on your head a lot as a child, while eating paint chips, underneath powerlines? If a member of the staff tells you to stop, you stop, then and there. You are more than welcome to PM them to ask why you have to stop, as long as you understand that when they say a conversation is over - it's over.

**Hey, those decomms are pretty funny. Can I write a shitty article just so you can decomm it?** No. No, no, no, no, no. Did we mention no? Having an SCP so terrible that it has to be decommissioned is NOT a good thing. One of the reasons we rarely do them anymore is because people wanted to gain infamy. Also, don't be a fuckwit.

**<Bad SCP> is so bad in so many ways! Can we keep it around as an example of what not to do?** No. There are as many ways for an article to be bad as there are shades of gray. Anything we keep around as an example is going to be ignored by people who would actually benefit from its advice and would be useless to those who would actually need it. Also, worse things have been posted (yes, they have), and we didn't save those either.

**Hey, I'm a dude and I see there are some girls on this site! Can I hit on them/make astonished comments about girls on the internet?** No. NO. __NO.__ This is not a dating website, and in most cases if this is a question you have to ask, your flirtation (or special attention) will not be so much welcome as creepy.

**So, can I talk about rape for no reason?** No. Stop. Shut the fuck up. There is no reason to talk about rape, or any other upsetting subject like that, unless it's on topic and you're not being a douchebag about it. 

**Wait, are you saying there's something wrong with discussing sexuality?** No. We don't mind you discussing that sort of topic or sharing personal information in appropriate context. Even in detail, //if it's appropriate.// 

We once had a user who took every opportunity to reference his rape fetish. No matter what the conversation was about, if he was around, you'd get a rape reference, or a NSFW picture link involving rape. This user is now banned. And we now boot pretty much anyone who randomly makes rape jokes. Get the picture?

**I'm too lazy to read more than ten or so SCPs, but I want to write an SCP of my very own! Good idea, or best idea?** No. You are being a jackass. Your SCP will end in an unmarked grave, and everyone will hate you, because you could have so easily avoided it. Also, why the hell do you expect people to read your shit if you won't read their shit?

**What other harsh advice would you give a new writer?** Read. The. Goddamn. Required. Fucking. Reading. Read all the guides. No, seriously, read them! Absorb them. Read it again. Look at some examples, read through the forums and discussion pages, (they are open to public viewing) and then read it a-fucking-gain. It makes you look pretty god damn stupid when you post an SCP, half finished, and people start yelling at you for it, when it tells you in the rules NOT to do that. 

**But I already know my idea is the best!** No you don't. This site has been up since 2009. We have thousands of members. At the time of writing, we have around four thousand articles. We've seen damned near everything, at least once. And what you think is OH MY GOD AWESOME, we think is just another piece of shit we'll have to delete. Lurk. For the sake of humanity, lurk. Take part in the discussions, talk in the forums and the chat, find out why people are downvoting something you think looks cool. Then, go back, and READ THE GUIDES again, and make sure you do it RIGHT.
