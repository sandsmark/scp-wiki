The Official SCP Foundation FAQ

**Why was the old FAQ Deleted?** It was getting unwieldy, so I figured I'd start again, see if I could slim it up some.

**How do I upload images?** Well, that info IS in the Newbie Guide, but since you asked: Go down to the bottom of the page where it says files, click upload a file from your computer, and go from there.

**What are some things that generally cause an article to accumulate downvotes? ** That's like asking how many grains of sand are on a beach. Everyone has a different reason for downvoting. But, some simple reasons: Bad grammar, poor writing, doing something that's already an SCP, or failing to write in the tone of the Foundation.

**How do I familiarize myself with the site?** Uhm. Read it? No, seriously, go through, and read as many SCPs and tales as you can, it's the easiest way.

**Why does the Foundation keep this SCP around? Why don't they just destroy/kill it?** Well, for starters, if you've read our logo, you know SCP stands for Secure, Contain, Protect, not Destroy, Destroy, Destroy. That said, if we destroyed everything, we wouldn't have much of a site, would we? In characterâ€¦ suspension of disbelief. Make something up, if it's good, it might be used.

**What are these -D, -ARC, and -EX SCPs that people keep talking about? They're not on the main list with the -J SCPs. Where can I find them?** -D are Decommissioned SCPs, one that were so bad, we had to write stories about their destruction. -ARC are archived SCPs, ones that were used in good stories, or that the old hands think of favorably, but that have drifted into the negatives, due to changing standards. -EX, which i wish there were more of, are explained SCPs, ones that no longer stand out as unusual in this world. As to where you can find them... just look around.
