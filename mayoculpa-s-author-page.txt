**A suspicious condiment** was first developed in 1982. The earliest (and still ongoing) researches into its culinary potential involve lightly-braised vocal melody with various raw instrumental garnishes. However, its rare consumer applications lean towards small batch artisanal poetry or use as a casual seasoning at various independent internet cafés and social media franchises.

If irritation persists, discontinue use.

> There are a couple of ways to reply to this, depending on your writer. In general, answers range from Harlan Ellison’s now-classic, “I get my ideas from a post office box in Schenectady,” to the more factual, and most often disbelieved, “Ideas are easy,” to the in-your-face, “Do you mean to say that you **don’t** have ideas? For God’s sake, tell me how to make them stop!”
