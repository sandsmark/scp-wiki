[[[SCP-2829]]] was my very first skip. I avoided the 'Failed First Skip' curse by just being too nervous to post, mostly, but I got a ton of feedback and all that. It was also how I learned about the Adipose from Dr. Who, incidentally. 

The original concept was basically little balls of fat that make you happy but something BAD happens. I was inspired by 999 when making this, because as much as I love the concept, that article //sucks//. 999 is happiness personified. What's the opposite of happiness? Maybe sadness and loss. Sometimes I like the Greek tragedy kind of irony. So I decided, hey, reimagine 999. Juxtapose sadness with happiness. Zyn told me to think of a story for these things, so I did. 2829 is the story of something made to bring joy, yet only succeeding in bringing more sadness into the world. The slugs suffer because they're starving and they can't fulfill their purpose. The Foundation staff suffer to keep it as safely contained as possible. Dr. Blackbox suffers because they ate him and their intended recipient never gets them.

Why slugs? Your guess is as good as mine. I don't even particularly //like// slugs. I'm far too proud of the title than I have any right to be.

[[[SCP-3031]]]. If it wasn't for the contest, I don't think this would ever exist. Honestly, the whole thing was born out of a narcissistic desire to get myself into history through the contest. I figured if I tried and didn't quite //fail//, that would still be a pretty good outcome. This is the quickest I have ever (and likely will ever) pushed something from concept to draft to posted, less than two and a half weeks.

Now, on to the skip itself. I knew I had no chance in hell of winning the contest. So I went full meta --alchemist-- and decided to write my thing on fear itself. I figured that a contest would be the only time I'd get away with something so ambitious. Parasites freak me out. The idea of something in your head that is eating your thoughts and replacing them with its own freaks me out. I knew it wouldn't be horror-y enough to win, but it seems to have done well. I like timeline-screwing in general. Yes, the iterations and note are cliche. But I like those cliches, and I think they're rather cool still.

[[collapsible show="." hide="Yes, tenrecs."]]
[[[SCP-3233]]] is a special skip for me, because it's A) the first skip idea I made completely wholecloth, and B) the first time I had to pull and revise something. It's the first time I actually experienced the whole "look at things in your everyday life that inspire you" method of idea coming-up-with. Anyways, long story short I was talking to a friend who works with animals, and she mentioned that for whatever reason, the animals seemed to only give birth when she was around. I never found out if this was just confirmation bias, but the idea of a person affecting animals in that way interested me. This was the same friend who told me about the existence of tenrecs; they're pretty cool animals. And since they got no representation on this site, and we need more animals that aren't cats, dogs, or birds, I figured why not.

The idea was stuck with me for a while, but last New Years Eve I had the urge to pull out my phone and write a quick rough draft on that useless Memos app. I have this thing where I'll write a bunch, then stop cold, then edit a tiny thing a month later. I'm still shy about asking for feedback, so it ends up being a continuous, slow cycle of improvements before I can even think it's good enough to ask someone to check it.

Anyway, I finally got it the way I liked it, and then ended up self-deleting a few days later. I received valuable feedback that it was organized //horribly//, and people were divided on the silly ending. The contest, and working on 3031 got in the way after I made minimal progress. I got back to it, and while writing it it sort of got away from me. I decided to amputate the ending from the skip itself, and I'll probably put it into a companion tale instead. I'm happy with how it's developed, though.

I don't think I //have// a definitive writing style. Or at least, not one that can be determined from a sample size of three. As I mentioned in the tab above, I tend to write in bursts. I don't often follow the methods in the guides, maybe I should. I've only done "story first, object second" for 3031; the other two I had the objects long before I knew what I was going to do with them.

As for inspiration? I can't really answer that. I've had three ideas in a year of being on this site, two if you consider that the original seed for 2829 was created years before I joined. I think 3031 was my only true burst of inspiration, and even then it's heavily derivative.

If I had to describe the things I wrote under one umbrella, I'd say that I like remixing and building on established works, tropes, and themes. Seeing the great work posted here keeps me motivated to try to come up with stuff, even if I never actually manage to do so.
