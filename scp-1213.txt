**Item #:** SCP-1213

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1213 is to be strapped immobile in a locked shipping container, stored in Sector-25. SCP-1213 is not to be allowed near young children, puppies, kittens, or any other mammal displaying neotenous traits, except for testing purposes.

**Description:** SCP-1213 is a wooden and steel catapult, medieval in design, 1.5 meters wide and 2.5 meters long. It has no distinguishing features or unusual physical properties. SCP-1213 is capable of locomotion on its four wooden wheels, and of operating its firing mechanism, how it does this is unknown.

Given space to move, SCP-1213 will haphazardly explore an area, searching for targets, should SCP-1213 find a suitable target, SCP-1213 will teleport the target into the basket on its firing arm by unknown means. SCP-1213 must be within 10 meters of a target in order to teleport it. SCP-1213 will then launch the target at the nearest flat vertical surface, after a launching it will remain stationary, emitting a "contented purring sound" while it resets its firing arm, and then SCP-1213 will resume its search for more targets. SCP-1213's firing arm can be strapped down, but any strapping will break should SCP-1213 launch a target.

SCP-1213 favors infant to prepubescent mammalian targets exhibiting significant neoteny that weigh in between 15 and 50 kilograms. SCP-1213 has also been known to target people with dwarfism on occasion.

SCP-1213 was found in █████, a farming town in Britain, after several unexplainable cases of dead children and small animals that were described as having been "hurled into walls at high velocity". A search of the town found SCP-1213 waiting in ambush in the bushes of a school playground. Further investigation of the town led to the discovery of a laboratory in an abandoned warehouse. Much of the laboratory was destroyed by an explosion, presumably caused by the large defunct device that was the focus of the laboratory. The device had been worked on for several years by  Dr. ████████, a scientist that had gone rogue after [DATA EXPUNGED]. Dr. ████████ could not be located.

Dr. ████████'s damaged research log was discovered in pieces amongst the debris of the warehouse, and only excerpts could be retrieved:
