**Item #:** SCP-431

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All documents and/or photographs SCP-431 appears in are to be stored in the Site-██ local database and replaced with copies of their original versions. Any personnel who report recalling SCP-431 are to be immediately questioned. Office ██-25 is to be inspected daily for any new objects. Foundation archives are to be monitored for any changes or new documents.

**Description:** SCP-431 is the designation given to Dr. Gideon, a man who appears to have been a Foundation researcher. Due to the condition of his records at the present, it is not known if Gideon is his real name. The existence of SCP-431 was first discovered during what appeared to be an attempt to hack the Foundation database: a number of documents were altered to state that a scientist referred to as "Dr. Gideon" was involved in researching several SCP objects. However, the Foundation IT team determined that the documents in question were not being accessed at the time that they were modified.

Since the initial event, references to a Dr. Gideon have appeared in ██ additional documents. Every time a document has been altered, IT has shown that it was not in use at the time of modification. Several new documents also appeared, a number of which are SCP documentation of items that the Foundation does not currently possess, including a [DATA EXPUNGED], and one item, a [DATA EXPUNGED], which is known to currently be in the possession of Marshall, Carter & Dark.

A number of physical objects have also been discovered in Office ██-25, which is currently vacant. It is not known when items began to appear inside it, as the office was only investigated when a "Dr. Gideon" name placard appeared on the door. ██ Documents have been recovered from the office, including a photograph, Document 431-██, seen above, which is believed to depict Dr. Gideon alongside three (3) known Foundation personnel. Old security camera tapes show a man who is believed to be Dr. Gideon conversing with a number of researchers. None of the researchers report ever working with anyone named Gideon and none show signs consistent with the administration of amnesiacs.

No information concerning Dr. Gideon's hiring by the Foundation exists, nor does any documentation indicating that Dr. Gideon was either fired, terminated, or quit of his own volition. One document recovered from Office ██-25 appears to have his fingerprints on it, as the fingerprints have no match within the Foundation's or any government's fingerprint database. No government documentation regarding anyone named Gideon matching the description of the individual in Document-431-██ exists, including birth, death, census and tax information.

By date, the last documents available presently state that Dr. Gideon was scheduled to oversee the decommissioning of an SCP object, however, the document refers to the object being decommissioned as SCP-███, a designation not currently in use. No documentation has appeared describing SCP-███.
