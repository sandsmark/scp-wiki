**Item #:** SCP-431

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All documents and/or photographs SCP-431 appears in are to be stored in the Site-██ local database and replaced with copies of their original versions. Any personnel who report recalling SCP-431 are to be immediately questioned about his activities, particularly those concerning SCP-431-1. In the event that SCP-431 is located he is to be immediately debriefed and questioned about SCP-431-1.

**Description:** SCP-431 is the designation given to Dr. Gideon, a man who appears to have been a Foundation researcher. Due to the condition of his records at the present, it is not known if Gideon is his real name. The existence of SCP-431 was first discovered when an unknown individual appeared in a photograph (Document 431-A, above) of several Foundation researchers at a party. Before that time, the unknown person did not appear in the photograph. Writing on the back of the photograph identified the individual as “Dr. Gideon”. At the time, no documentation existed regarding a Dr. Gideon. Over the next week, three (3) additional previously existing documents (Documents 431-B through 431-D) were found to reference a Dr. Gideon where they had not previously. No Foundation personnel remember a Dr. Gideon ever working for the Foundation, even people he now appears in photographs with.

It is now believed that Dr. Gideon, at some point, was a high-ranking Foundation researcher. The documents that have been found have all been verified, all photographs that now show him have been examined and shown to be undoctored. In addition, beyond eyewitness testimony, there is no physical evidence proving that the documents were ever altered. The documents indicate that during his time at the Foundation, Dr. Gideon supervised study of several SCP objects, all of which are still in Foundation custody except for four (4) items; two (2) of which remain missing; one (1) of which is known to be in the possession of Marshall, Carter & Dark; and a fourth, currently designated SCP-431-1. 431-1 was first discovered when a number of documents (Documents 431-E through 431-J) appeared in a vacant office in Site-██.

The documents refer to an SCP-███, although that designation is currently empty. The documents identify Dr. Gideon as the primary researcher of SCP-431-1. The documents describe SCP-431-1 as a Caucasian male, approximately 24 years of age, capable of altering reality with its mind. The documents state that while SCP-431-1 can alter reality, its changes only remain permanent within a certain radius of SCP-431-1. The exact radius is unknown as it is censored in all recovered documents, but the amount censored puts the radius between ten (10) and ninety-nine (99) meters. Once SCP-431-1 moves, any changes not within the radius will eventually revert, the time it takes to do so dependent on the severity of the change. All containment procedures are missing from the recovered documents, making the locating of Dr. Gideon, if he still lives, top priority.

The most recent documents found in the office state that SCP-431-1 was scheduled to be decommissioned, with Dr. Gideon supervising. No documents refer to the results of the decommissioning, and it is considered likely that the decommissioning procedure failed.
