title:Personal Diary of Dr. Julius L██████s
**Diary Entry 573-1:**

In my research with the Foundation, I have found that the official log is rarely the place to input personal observations. Therefore, I am logging this diary in an attempt to keep my own ideas readily available to myself.

SCP-573 is a flute, capable of lulling and entrancing animals and children. While entranced, subjects will do anything the flute player requests of them, without limit. So far, testing has been done solely on animals, without any negative consequences. Senior Staff has given me approval to move the testing up to children.

I will be testing six children, all aged eight years old,  three boys, three girls. One of each will be tested in mental and physical assignments, with the final two children acting as a baseline study, being put into a trance without any outside stimulus.

Current Test Subjects:
Cindy, Female, Physical
Tom, Male, Physical
Mariah, Female, Mental
Stewart, Male, Mental
Relanna, Female, Base
Sam, Male, Base

**Diary Entry 573-2:**

Met with the children today, everything went well. The kids are, well, kids, alternatively monsters and angels as they wish. Seeing as SCP-573 is capable of keeping the children in line, I have been informed that I will have no assistance in these tests, and that even the childrens nominal caretakers will be leaving for other duties while they are in my care. Due to this unfortunate circumstance, I will be handling the children as one group, instead of in separate chambers as I had hoped.

The children were rowdy when first dropped off, but I had them sit in their chairs, and preceded to play SCP-573 for ten minutes. At the first notes, the children immediately relaxed, all tension leaving their bodies. I instructed Tom and Cindy through a series of basic maneuvers, which they accomplished with ease. I then led Stewart and Mariah through some basic math and recitals, which they picked up with ease. This should be my easiest project yet.
