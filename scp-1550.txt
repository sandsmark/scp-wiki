**Object Class:** Safe


**Special Containment Procedures:** all SCP-1550  specimens are to be contained in a sealed 5m by 5m terrarium simulating [DATA EXPUNGED] under electronic surveillance and implanted with tracking devices. In event of a contaminate breach the affected sector will be locked down until all specimens have been recaptured and any eggs collected. Total population of SCP-1550 specimens is not to exceed twenty with further eggs or larva being terminated and their corpses incinerated. All testing must be approved by Level 3 staff or higher. All uncontained instances of SCP-1550 discovered must immediately be killed on sight.

**Description:** Item SCP-1550 is an apparently artificial species of unknown classification whose larva have the ability to undergo metamorphoses into a form which is adapted for their environment although all specimens posses a tattolike set of markings on their underbelly reading [DATA EXPUNGED] - a Dr. Wondertainment™ Trademark" and none will not grow to over ██ centimeters in length. Due to SCP-1550's powers of adaptation is it unknown if the species has an original form, and if so what it is.

Notes: //That was a bad idea. Dr. ████████//

Date: ██/██/████
Test Subject: SCP-1550

Procedure: One (1) SCP-1550 egg was placed in a vacuum chamber which was then depressurized.

Results: SCP-1550-7 egg exploded coating the inside of the vacuum chamber in [DATA EXPUNGED]
