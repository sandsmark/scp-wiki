[[/div]]


**Object Class:** Safe


**Special Containment Procedures:** All adult SCP-1550  specimens are to be contained in a sealed 5m by 5m by 5m terrarium simulating desert conditions under electronic surveillance and implanted with tracking devices. In event of an escape the affected sector will be locked down until all specimens have been recaptured. SCP-1550 eggs are to kept in their airtight packaging apart from in testing. Total population of SCP-1550 adults are not to exceed twenty at a time with further specimens being terminated and their corpses incinerated. All testing must be approved by Level 3 staff or higher. All uncontained instances of SCP-1550 discovered must immediately be killed on sight.

**Description:** Item SCP-1550 is an apparently artificial species of unknown classification whose larva have the ability to undergo metamorphoses into a form which is adapted for their environment. However, despite adaptations, all specimens possesses a tattoo-like set of markings on their underbelly reading [DATA EXPUNGED] - a Dr. Wondertainment Trademark" and none will grow to over ██ centimeters in length. Due to SCP-1550's powers of adaptation is it unknown if the species has an original form, and if so what it is. SCP-1550 eggs are one (1) centimeter, flesh-toned ovoids which will only hatch if exposed to air. When packaged, they are stored under airtight plastic seals apparently for transport. Dissection of unhatched eggs reveals them to simply contain a biologic mucusoid substance containing fragmentary DNA of unknown origin. As adult SCP-1550 specimens appear to be sterile it is unknown how the eggs are created.

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** SCP-1550

**Procedure:** One (1) SCP-1550 egg was placed in a tank of seawater and allowed to hatch.

**Results:** SCP-1550 specimen SCP-1550-1 possess gills along its upper back behind the eyes, flattened and broadened tails to serve as paddles for swimming and produces specialized mucus to protect its eyes from salt damage, a swim bladder revealed upon dissection in its lower █████ and [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Notes:** //Skin coloration was also a mottled blue, presumably to blend in with seawater.// Dr. ████████

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** SCP-1550

**Procedure:** One (1) SCP-1550 egg was placed in a tank of water taken from a river behind site ████ in which SCP-1550 was stored and allowed to hatch.

**Results:** SCP-1550 specimen SCP-1550-2 possess enlarged lungs and thinned body for increased streamlining.

**Notes:** //No gills? Apparently it doesn't use the same adaptations for similar circumstances. That's somewhat odd.// Dr. ████████

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** SCP-1550

**Procedure:** One (1) SCP-1550 egg was placed in a terrarium made to simulate a temperate forest ecosystem and allowed to hatch.

**Results:** SCP-1550 specimen SCP-1550-3 possess a thin layer of brown fur covering the top of it's body and a ridged, snakelike underbelly as well as enlarged tail-tentacles.

**Notes:** //The ridges along SCP-1550-3's underbelly had a small oval patch of smooth skin on which the tattoo-like markings where located.// Dr. ████████

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** SCP-1550

**Procedure:** One (1) SCP-1550 egg was placed in a terrarium made to simulate a desert ecosystem and allowed to hatch.

**Results:** SCP-1550-4 was cold-blooded and possessed a tanned coloration to camouflage it against sand as well as a tendency to burrow.

**Notes:** //The size was also interesting. ██ centimeters in length, about one centimeter larger than the other specimens.// Dr. ████████

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** SCP-1550

**Procedure:** One (1) SCP-1550 egg was placed in a terrarium made to simulate a standard city apartment and allowed to hatch.

**Results:** SCP-1550-5 possessed leathery skin, eyes on short lumps protruding from its head in a manner somewhat like the eyes of a chameleon and was noted for behaving in a more affectionate and active manner to researchers than other specimens of SCP-1550.

**Notes:** //Study reveled that behind the jaw inside are located strands of whale-like baleen, allowing the specimen to filter dust and crumbs from the floor.// Dr. ████████

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** SCP-1550

**Procedure:** One (1) SCP-1550 egg was placed in a vat of molten iron.

**Results:** SCP-1550-6 egg burst into flame and was destroyed.

**Notes:** //Well, what did you expect to happen?// Dr. ████████

Date: ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** SCP-1550

**Procedure:** One (1) SCP-1550 egg was placed in a vacuum chamber which was then depressurized.

**Results:** SCP-1550-7 egg exploded coating the inside of the vacuum chamber in [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Notes:** //It now seems obvious that SCP-1550 eggs cannot survive conditions besides those which at least some sort of complex animal can live in. So we might as well stop trying to make them do so.// Dr. ████████

Date: ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** SCP-1550

**Procedure:** One (1) SCP-1550 egg was placed in a vacuum chamber filled with seawater which was then pressurized to 1,086 bars (15,750 psi)
**Results:** SCP-1550-8 possessed a bio-luminescent lure like that of an angler fish extending from its forehead, gills similar to SCP-1550-1 and a dark grey-blue coloration. Legs were flattened and webbed into fishlike fins and eyes were nearly twice the size of those of other SCP-1550 specimens. Teeth were sharpened and possessed ridges to cut meat, similar to those found in many species of shark.

**Notes:** //This leaves the question of just what kind of child Dr. Wondertainment is trying to sell these things to that would live in conditions where a creature like that could be kept as a pet.// Dr. ████████
