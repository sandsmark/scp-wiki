Pile the bodies, one by one
Those we had to kill
Blame it on a freak explosion
Or mass suicide on the hill

Remember we are on the side
Of the angels; danger we condemn
However, we cannot hide
From the fact we are not them

Often we must act the devil
And play along with sin
But remember too, we do not revel
In the suffering of our kin

The physical under lock and key
The memetic erased from thought
The mental explained as injury
The visual forgot

End the interview, bring me
An amnesiac to frisk
And remove from their memory
The knowledge and the risk

Cover stories to produce
Disinformation is spread
Tell lies, for once loose
The truth could drop you dead

To the ends of the earth we traverse
And sacrifice ourselves
To defend this universe
From some unspeakable hells
