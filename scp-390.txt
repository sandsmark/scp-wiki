**Item #:** SCP-390

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-390 is to be stored in a climate-controlled secure containment unit at Site ██. Experimentation or analysis on SCP-390 may only be performed with permission from at least two (2) Level 4 personnel.

**Description:** SCP-390 is a large mechanical device that may have once been approximately 6 meters tall and 4 meters wide, composed mainly of wood and hand-crafted metals. The remaining section of the device consists of a large aiming mechanism topped with a heavy, sealed housing containing multiple large glass lenses as well as several components that have yet to be identified. The device was constructed primarily out of wood, with various metallic fittings and parts. Despite carbon dating of the wood in the structure placing the device at approximately 2200-2300 years old, little to no deterioration of the device's structure has been found.

Experimentation on SCP-390 performed after years of careful restoration work has shown that the device is capable of generating intense heat focused at a distance of up to 1200 meters, causing water to instantly vaporize, and flammable materials to ignite. Exactly how the device is able to accomplish this is currently unknown, and is the subject of continued research on the device.

SCP-390 was uncovered by archaeologists at a dig site at [DATA EXPUNGED], near what was ancient Syracuse. SCP-390 came to the attention of the Foundation after being reported by a local undercover Foundation agent. It was discovered near what may have been a mount that allowed SCP-390 to be precisely rotated and aimed. Due to its location, the age of the composite materials, and its apparent function, Foundation histories have theorized that SCP-390 may in fact be the legendary "████ ███ of ██████████" used during [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Incident 390-01:**
During testing performed on █/██/██, SCP-390 malfunctioned, flash-vaporizing all personnel within 50 meters of the device and causing catastrophic damage to its containment unit. Further testing of the device has been suspended, pending further understanding of its function and operation.
