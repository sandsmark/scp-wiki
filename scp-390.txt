**Item #:** SCP-390

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP-390 is to be stored in a climate-controlled secure containment unit at Site ██. Due to the significant deterioration in SCP-390's structure, experimentation or analysis may only be performed with permission from at least two (2) Level 4 personnel.

**Description:**

SCP-390 is a large mechanical device approximately 6 meters tall and 4 meters wide composed mainly of wood and hand-crafted metals. The remaining section of the device consists of a large aiming mechanism topped with a heavy device containing multiple large glass lenses as well as several components that have yet to be identified. Carbon dating of the wood in the structure has placed the device at approximately 2200-2300 years old.

Analysis of SCP-390 and its components is incomplete, but the device appears to be a mechanical construct similar to a modern military Chemical Oxygen-Iodine Laser, or COIL. It is presently not known how such a complex device was built in the time period suggested, nor how the device may have been fueled or powered.

SCP-390 was uncovered by archaeologists at a dig site at [DATA EXPUNGED], near what was ancient Syracuse. SCP-390 came to the attention of the Foundation after being reported by a local undercover Foundation agent. When discovered, SCP-390 was discovered near what may have been a mount that allowed SCP-390 to be precisely rotated and aimed. Due to its location, the age of the composite materials, and its apparent function, Foundation histories have theorized that SCP-390 may in fact be the mythological "████ ███ of ██████████" used during [DATA EXPUNGED].

SCP-390 is in an extreme state of disrepair, having suffered significant deterioration due to its age, and well has having been physically damaged. Efforts to restore and experiment on SCP-390 are pending review.
