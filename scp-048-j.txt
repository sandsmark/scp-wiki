**Item #:** SCP-048-J

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to its prevalence in public society, no method has proven effective in fully containing SCP-048-J. Rumors are to be disseminated to the public that the use of SCP-048-J is "bad luck" to discourage the continuation of its use. This is to be accomplished through word of mouth and by representing SCP-048-J in a negative light in mass media. All Foundation employees are to be alerted to the true nature of SCP-048-J, and requested to minimize or fully cease its use in their speech and writing.

**Description:** SCP-048-J is a set of anomalous phrases which, when spoken or written, will cause a manipulation of probability in the user's vicinity. These shifts in probability are universally detrimental to the user or the the completion of the user's objectives, and to any factors or individuals that may have been directly beneficial to the user. SCP-048 consists primarily of the phrase "T█████ c███'█ g██ a██ w████" but variations of this phrase also seem to activate SCP-048-J's probability manipulation effect.

**Addendum 1:** //Example of SCP-048-J's use. Audio sample from the Site-██ containment breach on ██/██/████.//

>
> **Agent Paulus Shirt:** No, I-I think we outran them.
>
> **Agent Red:** Nasty little buggers, aren't they?
>
> **Agent Shirt:** Yeah, I don't think they'll find us in here though.
>
> **Agent Red:** Aw, who are you kidding? If they don't find us, something worse will. We're good as dead already unless the reinforcements get here in time.
>
> **Agent Shirt:** Come on. Okay, so maybe we're stuck in the middle of a containment breach. And maybe we won't make it out. And maybe we're cut off from everyone else on the site. But look on the bright side! At least [SCP-048-J]

**Addendum 2:** //Log from the Area-███ break room.//

>
> **Junior Researcher Joseph Shmoe:** Morning █████.
>
> **Security Agent █████ Wolf:** Hey Joe, how's your morning been?
>
> **Junior Researcher Shmoe:** Not too good. The wife just filed for divorce.
>
> **Agent Wolf:** Hm. Sorry to hear that.
>
> **Junior Researcher Shmoe:** Yeah, and that's on top of a bunch of other stuff. This day literally can't get an- [At this point in the recording Junior Researcher Shmoe has his head shot off by Agent Wolf.]
>
> **Agent Wolf:** Don't you //ever// say that!
>
> **<End Log>**
>
> **Closing Statement:** Agent Wolf has been awarded the Foundation Gold Star for bravery in the face of danger and for averting the containment breach of SCP-048-J. Research into Junior Researcher Shmoe's past reveled that he was, in fact, a sleeper agent for the Chaos Insurgency who was meant to sabotage Foundation operations using SCP-048-J.

**Addendum 3:** On █/█/████, a second form of SCP-048-J was discovered and designated SCP-048-J-2. SCP-048-J-2 Consists of the phrase "W███ c████ p███████ g█ w████?" When spoken by an individual involved in an experiment or project involving an SCP object, it will invariably cause the failure of the endeavor and large-scale collateral damage, often with far-reaching consequences. The negative effects of SCP-048-J-2 appear to be multiplied exponentially if the user has been previously advised against carrying out the endeavor.
