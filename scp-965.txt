**Item #:** SCP-965

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-965 must be contained within a framed, ready-to-install window (henceforth referred to as SCP-965-1) composed of at least six (6) panes of clear glass (or similar material) measuring at least 15cm x 30cm. SCP-965-1 must in turn be kept within an environmentally controlled storage facility capable of withstanding significant seismic and similar disturbances. SCP-965-1 should be inspected at least once per week to check for degradation of material. At all times at least two (2) similar framed windows must be present and within separate chambers in additional padding and insulation, with no other window pane measuring greater than 14cm wide or 29 cm tall between them and SCP-965-1. The lighting within the chamber containing SCP-965 must be at a minimal of 130 candelas at any time personnel are within said chamber, except during research.

While SCP-965 is currently contained within SCP-965-1, our inability to control its movement upon destruction of SCP-965-1 through means beyond proximity have prompted its elevation to Euclid status. Research into a more permanent means to contain SCP-965 is ongoing and individual experiments —may be carried out by Level 1 personnel— require security level 2 or higher clearance with approval of Level 4 staff (see Notice 965-3a).

**Description:** SCP-965 is an irregular manifestation that occurs within framed windows. This manifestation takes the shape of the shadowed face of an apparently pale-skinned male that is looking through the window. The exact amount shown varies, as does the direction of orientation as well as the age of the person; however, it always appears to be the same individual at differing points of life, between the approximate ages of 10 and 55. Data-mining is ongoing to ascertain if the face belongs to a specific individual; lack of visual detail and the constant shifting of specifics has thus far hampered definitive identification but has lead to some few leads, including [DATA EXPUNGED]

SCP-965 will only manifest when the relative lighting on the "outside" of the window falls below 5 candelas, regardless of lighting on the "inside." Such terms are possible because the face will only appear in a fully assembled window frame, though it does not need to be currently installed. Thus far, SCP-965 has not shown any ability to intentionally move from one pane to another, even within the same installation; it is only able to attain a new manifestation point upon the destruction of the current SCP-965-1, at which point its new habitat will be reclassified as SCP-965-1. Individuals who are in the room when SCP-965 manifests report feelings of unease, nervousness and low-grade paranoia. This effect will overcome anyone within visual range of the manifestation, even if blocked (such as by curtains) but to varying degrees. The face is visible from the outside portion of SCP-965-1, but despite its two-dimensional nature it is described as "looking away, into the room." 

Based upon reports pertaining to residents of the house where SCP-965 was discovered encountering problems sleeping, experiments were conducted using D-class personnel who were made to sleep in a chambere where SCP-965-1 was installed. An individual that is sleeping in any area visible to SCP-965 when it manifests will invariably have dreams of a disturbing nature, usually involving being chased, attacked, tormented, etc., though without physical damage. Prolonged exposure to SCP-965 has shown increased numbers of manifestations, as well as equally increased severity of dreams and feelings of paranoia. The prior mental state of the victim in question has little effect; follow-up interviews have provided descriptions of different dream specifics but with the same end result of psychological disturbance.

With repeated incidents involving the same subject, as few as three (3) but never more than ten (10) dream cycles, SCP-965 will begin manifesting with a more explicit smile than normal; after this point, the subject will begin complaining of abdominal pain and often begin to vomit blood or have blood in bodily wastes. These were found to be caused by SCP-965 making shallow incisions within the abdominal cavity of the victim through a currently unknown process. The injuries have been confirmed as early as the first night of SCP-965 manifesting the "smile" configuration via exploratory surgery as well as autopsies of terminated D-class subjects. The incisions have a somewhat random placement and orientation but always remain around the gastrointestinal tract, occurring between approx. 2 cm and 6 cm beneath the skin, while the incisions themselves average once centimeter or less in depth. These cuts always appear the same patterns, a type of angular runic language or similar symbology. While the amount of incidents necessary to complete the "writing" varies to an as-yet undefined expect, SCP-965 will eventually carve a single rune onto the victim's heart which inevitably proves fatal; on this occasion, SCP-965 will always manifest with a smiling expression. No matching set of symbols have yet been discovered and are believed to be of unique construction.

A secondary effect occurs when SCP-965 targets a victim during their sleep, but the subject does not return. Interviews with prior owners of the residence where SCP-965 was discovered, backed up by reports from D-class subjects partaking in experiments, have reported continuing experiences of the facial manifestations during dreams as well as in peripheral vision while awake. Most suffer from low-grade but lasting feelings of paranoia, as well as sensations that they are being watched or followed. Whether this is in fact some remnant influence left behind or standard symptoms of distress followed by the dramatic intrusion of SCP-965 into their psyche is under investigation.

SCP-965 has to date produced no noise and there have been no reported instances of SCP-965 moving in any way once it appears; however it is capable of disappearing and reappearing at will in different poses. SCP-965 also shows signs of intelligent sentience; it has been observed to show disappointment if it manifests to an empty room, irritation or anger when manifesting before someone that had broken a prior SCP-965-1, and one instance of visible fear when in the presence of [DATA EXPUNGED] was unable to explain.

SCP-965 was first witnessed as a feature of a "haunted house" located in ████████, ██, USA. As part of routine examinations of such occurrences, on ██/██/19██, Agent ████████ was able to visually confirm its appearance and effects; a retrieval team was later able to remove the window from the structure and replace it with an identical one at a time when the building's owners were not on site.

**Notable incidents since retrieval**

**Incident 965-1:** On ██/██/19██, routine testing involving the destruction of SCP-965-1 confirmed that a multi-paned window may act as multiple holding zones, sufficient damage to the overall structure disqualifies it as a possible replacement; unfortunately SCP-965 instead manifested in an adjacent experimentation chamber's observational window. Due to the high standards of Foundation equipment, this required the window's complete removal and destruction via tactical breaching charge. SCP-965 was viewed with significantly hostile expressions for one month after the incident.

**Incident 965-2:** On 03/27/20██, two D-Class subjects, D-36147 (male, Caucasian) and D-36168 (female, Latino) were asleep at the same time when SCP-965 manifested in its smiling state, which as stated normally takes between 3 and 10 instances. Subject D-36147 suffered the expected cumulative wounds from continuous exposures within a single night, culminating in the fatal heart injury. Additionally, five seconds after life signs terminated, Subject D-36168 awoke screaming. She described watching D-1134 being mutilated by a man roughly matching the description of SCP-965 using assorted blades and stating he "wanted more." Once full testimony was recorded, D-36168 was sedated; SCP-965 manifested once more and was described by observing staff as "malevolent". D-36168 soon expired; autopsy showed internal wounds similar to normal but with greater depth and severity.

//Note: This is the first time that we've had someone able to give us a more-or-less complete description of the entity in a dream scenario. The fact that it seemed to be able to affect the subjects more rapidly - or simply chose to - when multiple people are asleep at the same time points to SCP-965 either harnessing its power from its victims or being willing to expend more effort to satiate its desires more rapidly. This may require further study.// - Dr. ███████, case manager

**Incident 965-3:** On 06/05/20██, the above experiment was repeated with five D-class subjects, all given nightly sedation and left in the chamber with SCP-965-1 each night for a week. When SCP-965 manifested in its smiling stage, a second round of sedation was remotely triggered to ensure all subjects remained unconscious throughout the study. The subjects expired one after another at approximate intervals of five minutes; the final subject, D-36548, awoke despite the sedation and was recorded as screaming "help me" repeatedly before dying. During this time, wounds were visibly being carved through the skin and into deep tissue by an unseen force, rather than appearing within the cavity. D-36548 only sat up and shouted with no other physical movement, suggesting somniloquy and/or somnambulance. This was the first known case where the internal wounds were inflicted to a severity to cause breaching of the skin, and autopsies on all victims showed that the symbology was morphing with each victim, becoming closer to the standard Roman alphabet though not enough to extrude a meaning. Visual records of SCP-965 at the time showed its expressions becoming progressively more ecstatic and malevolent with each victim.

Notice 965-3a: //Given the recent incident involving SCP-965, all related tests are hereby canceled until further notice. We have thoroughly proven that  it can only affect individuals who are sleeping, and that it gets happier and more powerful when more people are asleep nearby. We don't need to know how strong it can possibly get and we don't need to fully transcribe whatever it's been writing. We already know how to contain it: lock the door, leave it alone, check occasionally to make sure that its prison is intact.// - O5-█
