"Alright, Agent Mcclanahan, you know the drill."

"Don't I ever", said the man to the blank wall.

The room was small, cramped and featureless. Mark Mcclanahan stared at the single camera lens in front of him and tried to act like he wasn't about to be interrogated by a close friend. It was the drill, after all.

"Alright Mark, this has been your, uh, fourty-seventh debrief and coghaz decontamination baseline procedure. You remember that, yes?"

"Each and every one."

"Okay, let's begin."

The speaker emanates the sounds of leafing papers. A small moment of silence pervades, and Mcclanahan takes a deep breath. Here we go.

"State your name and identification for the record."

"Agent Mark Mcclanahan. Seven-four-alpha-nine-six-delta, //erm//, thirty-three."

"Good. And now, your phrase."

"In the twilight, the black and white goes gray." What a stupid line.

"Correct. Onto boilerplate loyalty tests. What is the Foundation?"

"The salvation of mankind."

"Do you work for the Foundation?"

"Always, as far back as I can remember, thanks to //you guys//."

"Keep it professional, Mark."

"Yeah, yeah."

"Do you have doubts about the Foundation?"

"No."

"Do you have plans against the Foundation?"

"No."

"Do you dream of leaving the Foundation?"

"No."

"Count to seven for me, 74A96D-33."

"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven."

"How many numbers are between four and seven?"

"Two."

"[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-033 How many numbers are between five and six]?"

"None."

"You hear about [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1173 that thing down in Samothrace]?"

"No."

"Feel your skin. Is it yours?"

"Irrelevant. My skin belongs to the Foundation."

"Is the vessel a vessel without the flesh?"

"They are one in the same."

"Do you prefer [http://www.scp-wiki.net/groups-of-interest#toc20 flesh] or [http://www.scp-wiki.net/groups-of-interest#toc5 metal]?"

"I prefer life."

"Good. [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2316 Do you recognize the bodies in the water]?"

"I do not."

"Where do you go when you are alone?"

"I visit my family."

There is a slight pause in the room. The tension mounts but fades rapidly.

"Can you tell me what they told you?"

"I work to serve in the dark, so others may live in the light."

"Who is your superior?"

"I serve the oh-five."

"Do you question the Overseers?"

"No."

"Recite your phrase."

"In the twilight, the black and white goes gray."

"Where do you go when you go to sleep?"

"Inside myself."

"Where do you go when you look away?"

"Inside myself."

"Where is Site-104?"

"Site-104 does not exist."

"Take a drink from the glass in front of you."

"There is no glass."

"Good. Continuing further. What does [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-370 the key] look like?"

"I don't know."

"Does it open a lock?"

"No."

"Does it open yourself?"

"No."

"How many stars are in the sky?"

"Too many to count."

"How many stars have died?"

"I don't know."

"Does the black moon howl?"

"When the twilight turns gray."

"Are you unclean?"

"I certainly hope not."

"//Professional//, Mark."

"Sorry, no, I'm not."

"Good"

"Does the name '[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2998 Ruhar]' mean anything to you?"

"No."

"Have you ever dreamed of being on a [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2571 carousel]?"

"No."

"Where do you go when you are here?"

"I'm never not here."
Â 
"What does this image mean to you?"

A symbol manifests on the white wall on Mcclanahan's left. He gives it a good look and turns to face the camera once more.

"It means nothing."

"Recite your phrase."

"In the twilight, the black and white goes gray."

More silence. Mcclanahan sits on the hard, metal chair for moments that feel like eternity.

"Alright, Agent Mcclanahan, please step outside."

Relieved, the agent quickly grabs his coat off the back of the chair and exits the room. On the other side, two guards greet him with dour expressions on their faces.

"What? What is it now?"

"Mark, you have no family."

"What, I-"

The world goes dark. The agent is never seen again. No one blinks an eye, and no one questions his passing. The world turns and the heavens gaze upon the Earth with a tear down its face.

"This isn't your fault."
