**Item Number:** SCP-4585

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4585 is to be stored within a soundproofed containment cell at Site-50. Interaction with SCP-4585 requires Level 2 or higher security clearance. It is recommended that safety glasses be taken into SCP-4585's cell during any interactions, however this is not required.

**Description:** SCP-4585, physically, is a standard hamburger made by the Steak 'n Shake Corporation. SCP-4585 is sapient, and can speak in German via a voice of unknown origin. This voice has reached a maximum of 142 dB. SCP-4585 is also capable using the five senses[[footnote]] Hearing, sight, taste, smell, touch [[/footnote]] and will not decompose. SCP-4585 can voluntarily cause SCP-4585-1 manifestation events, but is unable to cause a manifestation event if less then one month has elapsed since the last manifestation event. SCP-4585-1 manifestation events can number a maximum of 25 manifestations.

Physically, SCP-4585-1 instances are smaller then SCP-4585, but otherwise identical. In addition to SCP-4585's anomalous properties, SCP-4585-1 instances also possess the ability to generate french fries. They utilize said french fries in a similar fashion to a throwing spear. SCP-4585-1 instances use telekinesis to throw these weapons, but have not shown this ability on other objects. The french fry will demanifest after it is thrown.

In the event that the meat of a SCP-4585-1 instance is completely separated from the rest of the rest of the hamburger, all anomalous effects of that individual instance will cease. It is presumed that a similar effect takes place on SCP-4585 itself. 

Neither SCP-4585 or SCP-4585-1 instances are capable of locomotion.

> 
> **SCP-4585:** I swam.
> 
> **Junior Researcher Johnson:** //(pause)// But, you can’t move.

> **SCP-4585:** I am the Duke of Hamburg.
> 
> **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Can... how does that effect anything?
> 
> **SCP-4585:** I don’t follow.
> 
> **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Uh, whatever. We can return to that a little later. Are your //(pause)// subjects //(pause)// also like you? As in-
> 
> **SCP-4585:** Our appearance? Yes! That is part of what makes Hamburg so great! After all, its a lot easier to catch this world’s criminals if they cannot move.
> 
> **Junior Researcher Johnson:** that’s no- whatever. That's useful to, I guess. Is everyone in that place like you?
> 
> **SCP-4585:** Yes.
> 
> **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Then how do you catch criminals? Actually, scratch that, how does the whole thing operate?
> 
> **SCP-4585:** I can assure you, our justice system is very effective. I don't even get involved! Just in case I feel the urge to do injustice on my citizens! Isn't that great!
> 
> **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Sure, but, how does the city operate? I mean, nobody can move, you wouldn't be able to do anything other than sit around.
>

> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** Following this interview, Junior Researcher Johnson advised against classifying SCP-4585's Hamburg as SCP-4585-2. Citing SCP-4585's inability to explain how the city would function. Further investigation into SCP-4585’s origins is recommended.

On 4/9/1971, a convoy of 3 guards moved SCP-4585 to a soundproof containment cell via several on-site cardboard boxes. The following recording was taken from security guard Harold Unerp's body-worn camera. Note that this only shows a portion of SCP-4585's transport, for a full log see Document 4585-TRP-1.
