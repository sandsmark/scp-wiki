"Why do you look so gloomy?" said Harmon as Dr Muse took a seat at SCP-946 with SCP-857.

She plunked the wine glass onto the table and gave it a long glare.

"I //loathe// zis object."

"What's the matter with it?" Garcian said. "It's a rather nice glass."

"It is ze worst SCP object."

"Tell us of it, then."

Dr Muse sighed.

"Well, it apparently believes it is God or somesing like it, and it does miracles but sometimes it does not, and occasionally it does 'orrid sings to sinners and when its form is destroyed ze effect travels to anozzer cup, and ze containment procedures called for an alchemist and I am not a containment specialist so 'oo am I to question such sings, but anyway it is simply too much trouble to keep around, and just as I was sinking zis I got a call from one of ze Overseers and 'e informed me zat I am allowed to attempt to destroy it but after days and days I just //cannot//. It is ze worst."

Harmon and Garcian nodded slowly, then turned to face each other.
