++++ Description:
[[include :scp-sandbox-3:image-zoom name=victor.jpg|caption=Photo of SCP-5380.|width=300px|align=right]]

SCP-5380 is a homemade snow globe with a paper divider placed through its center. On both sides of the wall, the phrase "I ❤️ U, Victor" is written. The (recently deceased) individual responsible for creating SCP-5380 has been identified as Leana Hernandez.

When shaken, SCP-5380 will shower the area it is located in with snowflakes and paper hearts, similar in appearance to the objects in the snowglobe.

Approximately five minutes after the initial activation, all objects created by SCP-5380 proceed to dematerialize, at which point, SCP-5380 is capable of being reactivated for the same effect.

At the bottom of SCP-5380, a message dedicated to the individual "Victor Hernandez" has been inscribed, reading:

[[div class="blockquote"]]
[[=]]
//To Victor, my one and only beloved son.//

//"I let you into my world."//
//"...And then, you became my World."//
//—Ashiwarya Patra//

//I hope you'll live a good life.
I'm sorry I couldn't be with you more.//

//From, Your Mother.//
//—Leana//

+++++ Addendum 5380-1 — Discovery
[[/=]]
----
SCP-5380 was discovered when the individual "Victor Hernandez" (henceforth designated as PoI-1341) was sighted holding it within Metropolis at Metrotown in Burnaby, BC. PoI-1341 was showing the object to his acquaintance when shortly after, SCP-5380 was dropped accidentally. As a result, the entire mall was showered with snowflakes and small paper hearts.

Two members of MTF Iota-3 ("Secrecy") were dispatched, utilizing cover story ("Cold Love"). Alongside this, the remaining members of Iota-3 were dispatched to locate and apprehend PoI-1341 and claim SCP-5380. On initial contact, PoI-1341 threatened violence against Iota-3, at which point he was incapacitated and brought into custody.

+++++ Addendum 5380-2 — Interview
[[/=]]
----
Three days after the apprehension of PoI-1341, as well as the containment of SCP-5380, PoI-1341 was interviewed for further information into the anomaly. A recording of the entire interview has been logged.

[[div class="blockquote"]]
**Interviewer:** Dr. Ryne Monte
**Interviewee:** Victor Hernandez (PoI-1341)
----
**<Begin Log>**

**Dr. Ryne:** Good evening, Victor.

//[PoI-1341 is unresponsive for a few seconds.]//

**PoI-1341:** ...Evening.

//[Dr. Ryne smiles faintly before continuing.]//

**Dr. Ryne:** Do you mind if we ask you a few questions about SCP-5380?

**PoI-1341:** SCP-5380?

**Dr. Ryne:** Yes, the snowglobe.

**PoI-1341:** ...Right.

**Dr. Ryne:** Thank you for cooperating.

**PoI-1341:** //(Speaking in a quiet voice.)// What a bunch of bullshit.

**Dr. Ryne:** If you could tell us when you came into contact with SCP-53— No, the snowglobe of yours, that'd be a great start.

**PoI-1341:** It was a gift.

**Dr. Ryne:** A gift? From who?

**PoI-1341:** My mom. She died just recently, and it was her last gift to me.

**Dr. Ryne:** I'm... sorry, for your loss.

**PoI-1341:** Don't— //(Deep breath)// sweat it. It's fine. Not your problem anyways.

//[Dr. Ryne hesitates to respond.]//

**Dr. Ryne:** Do you know how she made it? The snowglobe, I mean.

**PoI-1341:** I don't know. We were too far from each other.

//[PoI-1341 pauses.]//

**PoI-1341:** My mom worked overseas. She went to Korea to teach a bunch of kids English. My dad at the time... he was dead. So my mom thought it was a great idea to work over in Korea, get a good stable job, and transfer the money to me so I could get on with life. I... had no idea she was working on a gift.

**Dr. Ryne:** I see...

**PoI1341:** Is there anything else? Can I have the snowglobe back?

**Dr. Ryne:** Two more questions. Did she ever make anything like this back at your home? Even in Korea.

**PoI-1341:** ...Yeah, she used to make a bunch of glasses and stuff. A real tiring job. She'd always make glass cups, vases, and shit before she moved to Korea. I guess she managed to get her hands on some of the equipment just to make… that last gift.

**Dr. Ryne:** Right... And how about you? Do you know how to make anything like this?

**PoI-1341:** No. I tried it once and failed. Even after, I tried again as a parting gift to my mom. It just never worked out, I guess I'm not really capable, huh?

//[Dr. Ryne pauses.]//

**Dr. Ryne:** I don't think that's what it is, if you don't mind me putting my two cents in. Maybe give it more time and effort.

**PoI-1341:** ...I'll try. May I have the gift back now?

**Dr. Ryne:** I'm very sorry, Victor. But we can't give you the snowglobe.

**PoI-1341:** What? Why?

**Dr. Ryne:** It's... a policy thing.

//[PoI-1341 is stunned]//

**PoI-1341:** Policy thing, huh? That's stupid.

**Dr. Ryne:** Look—

**PoI-1341:** My mom and I never got in much contact after she moved, and you're taking the one and only thing that connects us together away from us.

**Dr. Ryne:** Look, Victor. We're sorry, but we just can't hand over the snowglobe.

//[PoI-1341 takes a deep breath.]//

**PoI-1341:** Is it possible if you could... bend the rules a bit?

//[PoI-1341 pauses.]//

**PoI-1341:** Please.

**Dr. Ryne:** Like I said, I'm sorry. We can't hand it over.

**PoI-1341:** //(His voice quivers)// Right... right, because of your rules. I get it.

//[Tears form at the corner of PoI-1341's eyes. He slumps down in his chair and his face is facing the ground.]//

**PoI-1341:** Then I'm done here, goodbye.

**<End Log>**

Shortly after the interview was ended, PoI-1341 was escorted out of the room by on-site security.

+++++ Addendum 5380-3 — Delivery
[[/=]]
----
One month after the initial interview with PoI-1341, a package delivered to Dr. Ryne Monte was found within the Site-53 priority mail drop-off. Inside the package was a snowglobe wrapped in a heavy pile of sawdust. When a member of Foundation staff picked up the snowglobe to deliver it to the recipient, Site-53 and the surrounding area was hit by a rainstorm lasting fifteen minutes; this also caused anomalous indoor rainfall. No further deliveries containing items with similar properties have been received; investigations into the incident are on going.
