[[tab Introduction]]
+ Introduction
The Global Occult Coalition classifies paranormal Threat Entities into five broad categories, based on the general knowledge available regarding said entity. Threat Entities are named using the following format:
* A three-letter code indicating threat category.
* A unique casefile number.
* One or more codeword descriptors.
* An informal description of the threat entity.

EXAMPLE: **KTE-7912-Spiral Blackchild:** "Alternate Dimension Portal, Cornwall." 
The nomenclature indicates that this is a Known Threat Entity (**KTE**), casefile number 7912, that it is both a localized space-time rupture (codeword **Spiral**), and that it was created by a demi-deity (codeword **Black** [demi-deity], modifier **-child** [paranormal artifact created by]).

[[tab KTE: Known Threat Entity]]
Known Threat Entities are those paranormal entities which have been clearly identified as Threats and slated for response. 

[[collapsible show="Access KTE-0706-Black" hide="Hide KTE-0706-Black"]]
__**Threat ID:**__ KTE-0706-Black "Subject Able"

__**Authorized Response Level:**__ 4 (Severe Threat)

__**Description:**__ Component Able is a humanoid threat entity, apparently in its late twenties, approximately 2m tall, weighing approximately 80kg. Subject normally dresses in a manner adorned with demonic imagery, and prefers black leather clothing. In addition to the standard full suite of superhuman abilities (Strength, Speed, and Regeneration, all at Class 1 or higher) Subject possesses the ability to manifest bladed weapons from an unknown source. Subject is highly skilled in close combat, and appears to use no known martial combat style currently on record.

Psychological profile indicates that Subject is primarily motivated by ennui: Subject appears to derive satisfaction only from the act of killing, especially if said acts are carried out against a "worthy foe." Subject always appears to engage the most dangerous perceived threat first, and will bypass lesser threats to do so: Operatives should take this into consideration when preparing a plan of action.

Component Baker is an engraved stone cube 3.66m (12ft) on a side, sealed with 21 locks (one large lock surrounded by twenty smaller locks in a circle). Component Baker-Two is contained within, and comprises a 2.13m (7ft) tall stone coffin, secured with chains of unknown composition. Component Baker-Two is capable of regenerating Component Able from any remains, and of reforming it should all remains be destroyed. As stated above, Component Baker is to be considered the primary threat and should be secured as soon as possible.

__**Rules of Engagement:**__ KTE-0706 Black (hereafter referred to as Subject) comprises two components. Component Able is to be engaged with extreme caution: entity is a highly lethal combatant and has caused the deaths of over one hundred operatives to date. Component Able is never to be engaged at close range, but from as great a distance as possible. Headshot by sniper is the preferred method of termination.

Upon termination, Component Able will begin to reform inside Component Baker, returning to full threat efficacy within several weeks. For this reason, locating and destroying Component Baker is necessary for complete liquidation of the Subject. Operatives who have information leading to the discovery of the location of Component Baker are to immediately report said information to GOC High Command.

__**History:**__ <CLASSIFIED LEVEL Q BY ORDER OF GOC HIGH COMMAND>

-----

__**Appendix 001:**__ Field Operatives indicate that KTE-0706-Black is currently in the hands of the Foundation. Operatives are hereby ordered to focus all efforts upon that Organization to locate and recover Component Baker.

__**Appendix 002:**__ Per Field Report from Operative Crane, Coalition Operatives are hereby advised that the Foundation has begun fielding Component Able in combat situations, supported by a six to twelve-man support squad. 

__**Appendix 003:**__ Due to unacceptable casualties in the last three engagements with Threat Force Able, all Field Operatives are to cease and desist engaging Component Able under any circumstances save self-defense. Operatives are to refocus efforts upon locating and destroying Component Baker.

[[collapsible show="Access KTE-0937-Velveteen" hide="Hide KTE-0937-Velveteen"]]
__**Threat ID:**__ KTE-0937-Velveteen "Sixth Chair."

__**Authorized Response Level:**__ 3 (Moderate Threat)

__**Description:**__ Several kg of material comprising primarily of oak splinters and upholstery. Previously a chair made of oak and leather in the shape of a reclining female. Type III spatial transit entity.

__**Rules of Engagement:**__ To be engaged only by deep cover operatives. Object is extremely hostile to the Coalition and its agents. Object is to be destroyed by incineration if the chance arises.

__**History:**__ Initially one of a set of six matching objects originally constructed by KTE-7201-Pygmalion ("The Carpenter") as a gift to [IDENTITY REDACTED]. Classified a Second Mission threat in ████. Creator, customer, and artifacts were all liquidated by a GOC Field Operator cell. All other objects were successfully incinerated: KTE-0937-Velveteen was disposed of by maceration after a mechanical failure in the incinerator device. Artifact proceeded to escape through teleportation, and has since been responsible for the deaths of several agents. Believed to currently be in the possession of The Foundation.

__**Addendum:**__ 

> KTE-0937-Velveteen is an object lesson in the importance of following proper operating procedure. Due to the lack of vigilance by the agent on the scene, the object's threat level was escalated, the object itself was not successfully disposed of, and it has since fallen into the hands of a hostile agency. A single failure by a single operative resulted in the deaths of six. Remember this the next time you think about cutting corners.

[[collapsible show="Access KTE-1181-Plague Grey" hide="Hide KTE-1181-Plague Grey"]]
__**Threat ID:**__ KTE-1181-Plague-Grey "Infectious Slime Mould"

__**Authorized Response Level:**__ 3 (Moderate Threat)

__**Description:**__ A yellow-green myocetezoan protist. Life cycle begins as a single-cell ameboid which normally feeds upon bacteria and other protists. Upon encountering another member of the same species, the organisms will mate and then form a plasmodia that will then expand, consuming all food matter it encounters. When all available food matter has been consumed, organism will solidify, form sporangia (fruiting bodies), and release spores, which hatch into single-cell ameboids, resuming the life cycle. 

Organism's designation as a parathreat is due to its behavior upon encountering human brain tissue. Should the ameboid cross the brain-blood barrier and enter the brain, it will begin feeding upon human glial cells and replace human brain tissue with the plasmodia substrate. Secondary plasmodia will migrate through the blood stream to the skin pores, at which point the organism will form structures similar to sporangia which will begin producing a pheremone-like substance. 

The host body will then be compelled to travel to a public space, whereupon the pheremones will attract other humans to its current location. Upon detecting a sufficient number of human hosts within a particular distance, organism will then begin to reproduce at an exponential rate, building up pressure within the skull until the host body's cranium bursts, spreading spores and plasmodia and infecting all nearby human hosts, resuming the life cycle.

__**Rules of Engagement:**__ Infected hosts are to be terminated by gunfire and the host bodies disposed of by incineration. Avoid head-shots, as this may result in premature detonation of the subject's cranium and cause the infection to spread. The preferred method of termination is by a long-distance precision gunshot to the heart by a marksman: should close-quarters combat be required, all operatives are to be issued MOPP gear and placed in quarantine for a period of no less than 72 hours following the operation. 

Should the infection escalate to the point where it threatens to spread from the quarantine zone, escalation to Response Level 4 is authorized. At this point, the entire quarantine zone should be sealed off and sanitized by incineration. Any persons attempting to leave the quarantine zone will be terminated by gunfire followed by santization by incineration.

[[collapsible show="Access LTE-0913-Ex-Machina" hide="Hide LTE-0913-Ex-Machina"]]
__**Threat ID:**__ LTE-0913-Ex-Machina - "Semitic Solar Deity"

__**Authorized Response Level:**__ 1 (Monitor for signs of re-emergence, do not Engage)

__**Description:**__ LTE-0913-Ex-Machina (hereafter referred to as "Subject") was an energy entity revered as a god by several Semitic tribes during the fourth millenium BCE. 

__**History:**__ Subject was successfully captured and destroyed by a cabal of German Occultists circa 1882 CE. Destruction of Subject resulted in severe psychic backlash, leading to ennui and feelings of nihilism in several psi-sensitive subjects: one, in particular, wrote a text in 1883 mourning the death of said Subject:

> God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?

__**Appendix 001:**__ Although this operation was carried out before the founding of the GOC, it was one of the pivotal events leading to the founding of this organization. 

<CLASSIFIED LEVEL Q BY ORDER OF GOC HIGH COMMAND>

Subsequent events (The Seventh Occult War) devastated the paranatural world and came close to causing an Eschatological Event Sequence. The Coalition was subsequently founded to act as a safeguard against further rogue operations, and as a means of replacing the lost protection afforded by <CLASSIFIED LEVEL Q BY ORDER OF GOC HIGH COMMAND>

[[collapsible show="Access LTE-2101-Freud Warhol" hide="Hide LTE-2101-Freud Warhol"]]
__**Threat ID:**__ LTE-2101-Freud-Warhol - "Street Theater"

__**Authorized Response Level:**__ N/A (Confirmed Destroyed, File Archived)

__**Description:**__ LTE-2101-Freud-Warhol (hereafter referred to as "artifact") was a psychomechanical device concealed in New York's Central Park from an unknown date until █/█/██, when it was recovered and destroyed by a Coalition recovery team. Artifact consisted of three components:

1. A power supply consisting of an array of four lead-acid automotive batteries and an induction charger drawing electricity from the city's power grid.

2. A control unit consisting of a CPU, solid-state hard drive, and timer.

3. A Type-2 psychic broadcast unit capable of 200 kilorhines of output. 

Artifact was programmed to trigger once every ten to thirty days, upon detection of a minimum required number of persons within its broadcast range. Artifact would then assume direct psychic control of all individuals within broadcast range, designating certain individuals as "actors" and others as "audience." "Actors" would then proceed to perform one of the plays of William Shakespeare, chosen at random, for the edification of the "audience."

At the conclusion of the performance, Artifact would emit a high energy psychic burst that would erase the memories of the past performance from all subjects. Side effects include headache, disorientation, and nausea.

__**History:**__ Existence of artifact was first discovered following reports of strange behavior among the homeless population of Central Park from residents of the surrounding area. Artifact was recovered, catalogued, and destroyed by a Coalition field team disguised as New York City Power Authority employees.

__**Appendix 1:**__ The following fliers were discovered posted around Central Park 24 hours after destruction of LTE-2101-Warhol.

[[collapsible show="Access LTE-3410-Clockwork Green" hide="Hide LTE-3410-Clockwork Green"]]
__**Threat ID**__: LTE-3410-Clockwork Green "The Slow Kid"

__**Authorized Response Level**__: N/A (Confirmed Destroyed, File Archived)

__**Description**__: Subject was at time of liquidation a Caucasian male twenty-one (21) years of age and a Stage 4 Type Green (Subtype Clockwork) Known Threat Entity. Initial Identification was made by Observer [REDACTED] after being alerted by local law enforcement of a bank robbery involving an anomalous entity. Surveillance footage of the firefight recorded the Subject utilizing its anomalous ability to affect incoming gunfire from armed police response units. Three (3) law enforcement officers were wounded during this incident.

__**Liquidation**__: Due to the high profile of the initial incident, expedited liquidation authorization at Response Level 2 was given by Assistant Director "Celesta" on █/█/██ to field units in the local area. Due to the ground-floor location within a populated area, the method of termination selected was a night-time raid utilizing suppressed small arms fire at close range.

__**Appendix 1**__: Encounter Report

> **Date:** █/█/██
> **Subject:** KTE-3410-Clockwork-Green
> 
> **After-Action Report Summary:** Upon breaching the building, Liquidation Team One was beset by a large number of pre-prepared booby traps set out by Subject. While none of these were immediately lethal, the distraction was sufficient to allow the Subject to escape the building while setting off an Improvised Explosive Device
> 
> At this time, we do not believe that the Subject was aware of our mission; the ambush was merely consistent with that of precautions undertaken by a paranoid schizophrenic with undue access to dangerous materials.
> 
> One LT Operative KIA, two WIA. Team Leader █████ has volunteered to head up follow-up investigation and re-acquire Subject.
> 
> **Status:** Mission Failed, Subject at Large

__**Appendix 2**__: Liquidation Report

> **Date:** █/██/██
> **Subject:** KTE-3410-Clockwork-Green
> 
> 3410 terminated by small arms fire at close range, body removed and incinerated as per standard procedures. Guess the fucker can't stop bullets fast enough if you're in his face, but I can't do anything about the bullet now.

> **Status:** Mission Success, Subject Liquidated

__**Appendix 3**__: Oversight Annotation

Operative █████ has been reprimanded for his unprofessional solo liquidation of KTE-3410-Clockwork-Green. While Subject was successfully liquidated, his acting alone while motivated by retribution as well as the resulting creation of a new Non-Threat Entity that is now under Foundation control are regarded as unacceptable risk under Second Mission concerns. Operative █████ has been suspended for a period of no less than three (3) months pending review.

__**Threat ID**__: LTE-4201-Velveteen "Ghost Ships"

__**Authorized Response Level**__: N/A (Confirmed Destroyed, File Archived)

__**Description**__: Two fishing trawlers, each 39 meters in length, designated Component Alpha and Component Bravo. Component Alpha was distinguishable from Component Bravo due to extensive hull damage caused by impact with iceberg. Entities were animate and apparently sapient and displayed companionate behavior towards one another.

__**Liquidation**__: Due to increasing Second Mission Concerns due to increasing reports of "Ghost Ships" by local sailors, LTE-4201 Velveteen was approved for liquidation by the Council of 108 on █/█/██. Strike Team "Ocean Thunder" was tasked to eliminate the target. Strike Team perished after successful liquidation of Component Alpha, when Component Bravo collided with their vessel at hypersonic velocities, resulting in the loss of all hands. Component Bravo subsequently self-terminated.

All members of Strike Team "Ocean Thunder" were subsequently awarded the Aegis of Humanity (post-mortem).

__**Appendix 1**__: Memorial Message, issued on █/█/██.

> FOR IMMEDIATE DISTRIBUTION TO ALL GLOBAL OCCULT COALITION MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS
> 
> GOC High Command has just learned that Strike Team "Ocean Thunder," based out of Dutch Harbor, Alaska, was lost with no survivors this day, after an encounter with a dangerous Threat Entity. Strike Team "Ocean Thunder" was carrying out the liquidation of a major Second Mission Threat, and had destroyed one of the two Threat Entities, when the second collided with their vessel at high speed. Despite a heroic rescue attempt by Assessment Team "Spinnaker," all members of Strike Team "Ocean Thunder" had perished by the time they were plucked from the sea.
