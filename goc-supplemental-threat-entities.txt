+Introduction
The Global Occult Coalition classifies paranormal Threat Entities into five broad categories, based on the general knowledge available regarding said entity. Threat Entities are named using the following format:
* A three-letter code indicating threat category.
* A unique casefile number.
* One or more codeword descriptors.
* An informal description of the threat entity.

EXAMPLE: KTE-7912-Spiral Blackchild: "Alternate Dimension Portal, Cornwall." The nomenclature indicates that this is a Known Threat Entity (KTE), casefile number 7912, that it is both a localized space-time rupture (codeword Spiral), and that it was created by a demi-deity (codeword Black [demi-deity], modifier Child [paranormal artifact pertaining to]).
