Subject: SCP-567-9-1

Description: Though there were two reported incidences of SCP-567-9 before the Foundation arrived, SCP-567-9-1 was the first incidence observed by the Foundation. It was discovered by Agent █████, and was approximately 2 m in length. Though it walked on four limbs, its front limbs had [REDACTED] capable of operating complex devices.

Subject: SCP-567-9-2

Description: SCP-567-9-2 appeared shortly after Site 41 was fully established and quarantined, and took the form of [DATA EXPUNGED].  Foundation personnel suffered 9 casualties before it was destroyed with remote explosives.

Subject: D-834200

Description: D-834200 was used as part of testing to determine the trigger conditions for each cell.  When placed in front of the cells, SCP-567-6 and SCP-567-7 both activated simultaneously and attempted to draw D-834200 in. After a brief struggle, D-834200 was [REDACTED]. The individual body parts vanished as per the usual, once drawn completely into the cell.

Subject: SCP-567-9-5

Description: During testing of SCP-567-4, when the cell door was opened, SCP-567-9-5 manifested and immediately attacked and killed Dr. ██████ without warning. It took the form of [DATA EXPUNGED]. Due to the presence of high-value personnel, standard containment procedures were not feasible. After a total of 7 casualties, [REDACTED] was able to lure SCP-567-9-5 back towards SCP-567-4, a which point it activated, drawing SCP-567-9-5 back into it.

Subject: Dr. Clef

Description: Dr. Clef toured the facility as part of a routine inspection. The moment he entered SCP-567, each cell's door slammed shut and refused to open again, even when individuals meeting the cell's requirements were placed in front of it. Cell doors did not unlock again until Dr. Clef had left the facility entirely.

[DATA EXPUNGED]

**Date:** December ██, 20██

Subject: SCP-567-9-8

Description: On December ██, 20██, the door to SCP-567-7 was observed to open and close via CCTV, but no instance of SCP-567-9 appeared on the monitoring system. Two weeks later, [REDACTED] was found dead in his bed, in circumstances identical to those of deaths involving [[[SCP-966]]]. Mobile Task Force Iota-1 was dispatched, and located SCP-567-9-8 within Site 41. SCP-567-9-8 appeared similar to an instance of [[[SCP-966]]], with the key differences being [DATA EXPUNGED]. It is worth noting that, when viewed in the proper wavelength, this instance of SCP-567-9-8 had clear burn marks around its wrists and ankles. SCP-567-9-8 was successfully contained, and facility cameras were upgraded to observe additional wavelengths.
