**Item #:** SCP-213

**Object Class:** Keter/Neutralized 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-213 is to be contained within a standard cell furnished with basic items that he already owns. No additional or new items are allowed. This cell must be separated from all adjacent rooms by a 10 meter space filled with gaseous materials corrosive to human skin; subject should be informed as to the nature of his housing to prevent use of abilities which would result in bodily harm. A staffing of two guards armed with high-voltage electroshock rifles, oleoresin capsicum, and polymer web grenades should be stationed at all times. Due to the nature of this containment equipment, subject should be made fully aware that his life is expendable due to his previous escape attempts.

**Description:** Subject appears to be a Caucasian male in his late teens, 1.90 m (6 ft 3 in) tall, 95.25 kg (210 lbs). Hair is brown, eyes hazel. Investigation reveals that the subject is a citizen of [DATA EXPUNGED], full name █████ ███ ███ and 19 years of age with full records leading back to birth. Subject claims his ability manifested at the age of 17, with no apparent cause. 

SCP-213 possesses the ability to forcefully sever the bonds between atoms in most any solid or semi-solid matter with physical contact. An intense flash of light is produced when doing so, leading some researchers to theorize that he produces a unique type of energy which, when forced through the molecular structure of an object, breaks the object's molecular bonds. Recent events have revealed that he can employ this ability for sustenance and significant regeneration of his own body(see event log 213-1)




Event log 213-1: 


Subject requested an interview with Doctor ████ , who had been the primary researcher and contact to SCP-213 for the majority of his stay. she accepted due to the fact 213 had been highly uncooperative and had refused to speak to staff prior to this incident.

 The doctor entered the containment area and began the interview, which was recording as follows:


 
> Doctor: Good evening ███, how are you feeling?
> 
> 213: Fairly decent, all things considered. 
> 
> Doctor: I understand you are ready to provide us further details of your time outside now? There was a sudden 2 year gap in your otherwise consistent records
> 
> 213: Records?
> 
> Doctor: Yes. medical, educational, so on. it abruptly stops around june of ████ 
> 
> 213: ooooh. haha, yea, I suppose it would have
> 
> Doctor: Did something happen in this time?
> 
> 213: Yes. I found it. 
> 
> Doctor: It?
> 
> 213: yea, it. what I needed to find. I looked for it, and then they gave it to me. It's beautiful.
> 
> Doctor: Are you refering to your..."ability"
> 
> 213: huh? oh, sure. yea. but look, I kinda called you down here to help me with something. see, I gotta do it again. it's time. I need you to help me do it again. to get me out.
> 
> Doctor: I'm sorry, but I'm afraid that is not possible. your previous attempts at escape have forced us to take a rather strict containment policy.
> 
> 213: aw don't worry about it. you can still help me. I got it all figured out all ready. don't worry, your job will be super easy.
> 
> Doctor: I'm sorry but I must insist that you cease you-*doctor is interupted by 213 grabbing her by the throat and pulling her to the walls of the enclosure*




The following is a transcription of the events that followed, obtained through security footage and witness accounts:


-213 applies ability to the wall of his containment area. as the caustic materials contained within begin to take effect, subject applies his ability to doctor ████, albeit at a much slower rate that had ever been recorded before. subject appears to be replacing lost tissues as the doctor is slowly consumed.


-subject reached the far wall and destroys it, granting him access to the facility at large. Doctor ████ is confirmed dead at this point

-Subject seemingly ignores possible escape routes in favor of seeking foundation personnel. due to entering a low security wing armed security staff was sparse 

-Subject indiscriminately attacks any personnel he finds. Subject's lack of desire to escape is made apparent when he ingores a clearly marked exit in favor of pursuing a group of staff into the lounge area

-upon killing the research staff in the lounge, subject is met with the newly arrived security detachment sent to investigate the alarm. subject charges the team and they respond by opening fire


-subject incurs severe wounds in numerous locations, falls to the ground and expires shortly afterward.
