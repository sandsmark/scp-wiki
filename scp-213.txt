**Item #:** SCP-213

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-213 is to be contained within a standard cell furnished with basic items that he already owns. No additional or new items are allowed. This cell must be separated from all adjacent rooms by a 10 meter space filled with gaseous materials corrosive to human skin; subject should be informed as to the nature of his housing to prevent use of abilities which would result in body harm. A staffing of two guards armed with high-voltage tazer rifles and polymer web grenades should be stationed at all times. Due to the nature of this containment equipment subject should be made fully aware that his life is expendable due to his previous escape attempts.

**Description:** Subject appears to be a Caucasian male in his late teens, 1.90m (6ft,3in) tall, 95.25kg (210lbs). Hair is brown, eyes hazel. Investigation reveals that the subject is a citizen of [DATA EXPUNGED], full name █████ ███ ███ and 19 years of age with full records leading back to birth. Subject claims his ability manifested at the age of 17, with no apparent cause. 

SCP-213 possesses the ability to forcefully sever the bonds between atoms in most any solid or semi-solid matter with physical contact. A highly visible light is produced when doing so, leading some researchers to theorize that he produces a unique type of energy which, when forced through the molecular structure of an object, breaks the object's molecular bonds.  Any part of the subject's body can utilize this power; the subject has used it to disintegrate bullets and shells as they impact his body, provided he knows they are coming.  Extensive use of his ability has proven to leave the subject tired, hungry, and/or dehydrated.

**Addendum 213-01:** Subject has made his first escape attempt. After asking for another interview with Dr. ████, SCP-213 calmly waited for the doctor to arrive and begin entering his cell. As soon as two of the three doors were opened, subject rushed to the final door and applied his ability, atomizing the door and giving him a clear path out of his cell. Subject killed Dr. ████, as well as two gas squad members during the initial stage of his escape. Subject proceeded on through the facility, destroying barriers in order to quicken his travel through the area. 

Subject up until this point has only seen a small portion of the facility and was easily apprehended after he encountered SCP-███ and SCP-███ while searching for an escape route. Breaking through his cell seems to have weakened him enough to prevent further damage to other containment cells. Subject apprehended in the lounge while being ‘viciously assaulted’ by SCP-131 who had stared him into a corner near a vending machine. On further investigation subject had been told by some staff members who passed the area that they possess ‘Death-Ray Eyes’ if angered and just to stay still until someone comes for them.

**Addendum 213-02:** SCP-213 has agreed to a test to ascertain the level of his ability in exchange for access to one of the staff member’s full collection of ‘Family Guy’ DVDs to watch. During this test an array of material was set on stands and SCP-213 was asked to ‘atomize’ each.
 
> **Glass Bottle Pyramid:** 10 glass Yoo-Hoo bottles arranged atop one another in a pyramid. After 2 seconds of contact with the bottles they flashed to a bright red in color as if exposed to high heat then vanished. A burnt smell lingered in the air at this spot.
> 
> **Cinder Block Pyramid:** 10 concrete cinder blocks arranged in a pyramid shape. After 7 seconds of contact the blocks again flashed a red color and vanished. Unusual smell remained, could be smell of burnt concrete but that is not a smell we have experience with so cannot be certain.
> 
> **Hustler Pyramid:** 10 Hustler magazines confiscated from ██████ arranged in a stack. Magazines immediately vanished and smell of burning paper remained.
> 
> **Dr. █████:** Dr. █████. Subject attempted to vaporize Dr. █████ and was promptly socked in the jaw. Time span of test was .35 seconds. SCP-213 returned to his room where he awoke 30 minutes later and was given pain relief medicine.

**Addendum 213-03:**SCP-213 accidently left his containment. Due to the nature of this escape no reprimand has been issued. According to video feed taken at 3:15am of SCP-213 sleeping, his bed suddenly vanished beneath him along with a section of the floor which he promptly fell through into a boiler area in the basement. SCP-213's cell floor is the only part of his containment that is a purely solid substance and does not contain the corrosive gases currently used as incentive to prevent escape attempts. Consideration was put into changing this however it was decided that we do not want to lose a research subject due to 'Night terrors'.

From study of this video it is clear that SCP-213's control of his ability is not as perfect as he previously believed and due to this he has become more cooperative with us in trying to establish a method to control and utilize it. Vague conjecture on the part of the review staff as to possibilities of what would occur should the power trigger accidently, including SCP-213 self-vaporizing, are noted as being particularly useful in this regard.

**Addendum 213-04:**
██-07-████: During routine physical examination of SCP-213 we have discovered lesions on his back that at first glance appear to be boils. Inspection of these has led to the conclusion they are not an indication of any sickness or disease. At present time there are four boils, placed at intervals on the subject’s back in a perfect square. Distance between all four points is exactly 15.24cm (6in) from boil to boil. SCP-213 has been asked to remain shirtless as long as possible while in containment so video feed can observe and rapidly respond to changes in this condition.

██-09-████: After routine material tests with SCP-213 to record the extent of objects that he can affect a follow-up examination has led to the discovery of two more boils, these are placed in the perfect center of his palms. SCP-213 reports mild irritation at their presence but zero levels of pain or discomfort resulting from them. The boils resist pressure applied to them with blunt or sharp instruments and do not pop or bleed. During an attempt to excise a sample using a scalpel, the instrument also refused to cut the boil and after a few seconds of firmly applied pressure it vaporized. SCP-213 denies responsibility for this occurrence.

██-14-████: SCP-213 rushed to medical lab after being observed yelling at the cameras in his containment cell. Examination of SCP-213 shows an additional ten (10) boils have appeared on subject’s back. A myriad of possible designs could be used to describe the new lesions due to their placement. A perfect distance of 5.08cm (2in) separates each boil. Subject continues to report no pain, merely shows panic at the discovery. SCP-213 has been assigned a medical observer who will remain outside his containment with the standard guard staff for the next week in the event of further occurrences.

██-23-████: All boils on SCP-213 have disappeared and been replaced with thin scissions not even 1cm in width, best described as being like paper cuts. There are at present a total of 16 of these, 14 on the back replacing the boils and 2 on the palms. During inspection of these new lesions the medical examiner witnessed the scission on SCP-213’s palm open and an ‘eye’ was observed watching her. SCP-213 claims no knowledge of any such event but has corroborated the panic of the medical technician upon examining his hands.

**Addendum 213-05:** Source of SCP-213’s ‘ability’ appears to be a symbiotic infection of unknown origin inhabiting his body. The previously recording medical anomalies stem from growth of the symbiotic lifeform inside of SCP-213. This lifeform does not communicate but does observe through the lesions now present on SCP-213’s body. SCP-213 has exhibited understandable panic over this development and requested several times the entity be removed from him, however both for purposes of research and actual medical impossibilities this has been declined.

The entity inhabiting SCP-213 fails to show up on any medical scan we have at our disposal. This is being attributed to the nature of the ‘ability’ granted to SCP-213 where he is able to break down material on a molecular level. The new hypothesis is this ability actually serves to provide sustenance to the symbiote inside SCP-213 and repeated tests to determine the extent of his ability has led to increased growth.

The lesions in the palms of SCP-213 provide a visual outlet for the entity as described in the last event of **Addendum 213-04**. The lesions on SCP-213’s back appear to provide a means for it to extend its mass out of the confines of his body. During observation a growth of matter, blue/green in color with a mild repugnant smell, slithered from a lesion which then closed. The tentacle fell to the floor and rapidly dissolved into a gas. This was only observed once so no sample was obtained due to the surprise of the staff. Further observations have been authorized.
