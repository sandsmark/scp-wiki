**Item #:** SCP-213

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-213 is to be contained within a 2 room cell furnished with the furniture and items of the subject's choosing, with the exception of items deemed a threat to security and secrecy. there is to be no other rooms or spaces above, around or below the subject's cell.

 the walls, ceiling and floor are to have no less then 3 layers, with at least 25cm of empty space between each layer. subject's ability can travel through a great deal of mass as long as it is connected, the only way to counter this and thus stall subject long enough to be contained is to use the aformentioned layer system. the cell's ventilation system is to have an attached nerve gas system able to be triggered quickly and easily from the observation room. 


additionally, a minimum of 5 gas squad members are to be permanently stationed at SCP-213's cell. 24-hour surveillance is required to assure subject does not attempt to escape.due to the subject's abilities, any additional fortifications to the cell have been deemed a waste of resources. 

**Description:** Subject appears to be a caucasian male in his late teens,six foot 3 inches(6'3) tall, 210 lbs, hair is brown eyes hazel. later investigation revealed the subject is a citizen of [DATA EXPUNGED], full name █████ ███ ███, 19 years of age with full records leading back to birth. subject claims his abilities manifested at the age of 17, with no apparent cause.

SCP-213 posses several abilities, all of which he claims manifested at the same time. 

the most marked of these is the apparent ability to forcefully sever the bonds between atoms in most any solid or semi-solid matter with physical contact. a highly visible light is produced when doing so, leading some researches to theorize he produces a unique type of energy that is forced through the atoms, and is somehow able to nullify their bonds with each other, reducing them back to individual atoms. unfortunately testing has been delayed indefinitely due to subject's lack of cooperation, and the great danger posed from attempting to do so against his will.


in addition to this unique trait, the subject's physical abilities are all at a superhuman levels, having strength, speed, reflexes and durability far exceeding an ordinary man, and possesses an incredibly fast an efficient regenerative ability(subject has healed from 3 armor piercing rounds being fired through his head, heart and throat in less then a minute). in addition, subject has no need to eat, and requires very little water(subject has gone for 2 weeks without drinking anything, with no visible negative effects). reasons for these abilities have once again been linked back to the unique energy subject seems to produce, but no conclusive tests have been done at this point in time.






while not openly violent in his stay, subject has refused most all forms of cooperation in the study of his abilities. the below detailed account of his capture is as of yet the best known example of his abilities he has demonstrated, refusing to do so while being watched in containment.


**Additional**


Subject was found within a [DATA EXPUNGED] federal prison(later subject reported he was there of his own will, thus how local authorities where able to apprehend him), subject was discovered when a class d personnel recruited from that same prison reported meeting a man who could "make things disappear". an investigation was carried out.


upon being confronted by the foundation team sent to apprehend him, reports state subject used his ability to destroy a large patch of wall in his cell, then proceeding to jump 5 stories down, landing on his feet and proceeding to run at incredible speeds to the nearest gate, which he jumped over and escaped the prison compound into a nearby town. 


upon seeing his abilities, the agents on location requested support from combat and containment unit 012. upon arrival unit 012 proceeded to track subject into the town, and eventually cornered him in a vacant building. the 23 members of team 012 entered the building. there where no survivors. from what could later be gathered from the scene, subject killed all members of team 012(some with his unique power, other seemingly with sheer physical force) and escaped to a nearby warehouse.


 approximately 2 hours after the deaths of team 012, team 026 and a gas squad where dispatched to the area, tracking subject to the warehouse. team 026 and the gas squad entered from opposite ends of the warehouse, though no sign of subject was found for 15 minutes until he was eventually spotted hiding behind a high stack of crates. upon being noticed, subject attempted to retreat, destroying several objects and barriers that where blocking his paths. it was eventually noticed that extended use of his ability visibly fatigued the subject. the teams began forcing SCP-213 to clear routes for himself through the many barriers of the warehouse, wearing him down as he did so. eventually subject ended at the far right wall of the warehouse. instead of making a hole to continue his escape, the notedly irritable subject instead turned on the teams and attacked. subject was reportedly noticeably hindered by his exausted condition, however despite this he proceeded to take several volleys of automatic weapons fire, and kill 8 personnel before the gas squad was finally able to sorround and spray him with the paralyzing agent, bringing an end to the chase.






subject was kept heavily sedated until he could be relocated to the ████████████ facility. 


**Addendum 213-01:**


Subject has agreed to interviews at various times, the most productive of which is detailed below



> <Start of session>
> 
> Dr. ████: When did you first become aware of your abilities?
> 
> SCP-213: I was 17 years old, sitting at the kitchen table eating a sandwich. I had on had laid on the table, just relaxing and eating. then I get a sudden migrane. used to get them alot when I was younger. next thing I know, the table I was touching glows dark blue for a split second, and then it's gone. just, gone. I freaked out and jumped back, then felt my hand hit something and heard a loud noise. I turn to find I had put my arm clear through the refrigerator door, then flung the thing half way accross the room while trying to pull my arm out. needless to say at that point, I was a bit freaked out
> 
> 
> Dr. ████: then what happened?
> 
> 
> SCP-213: My mom comes in freaking out, runs up to me and not even thinking, I put my hand on her shoulder partly touching her neck. next thing I know, there is the light again. I pulled my hand away as fast as I could, but I was too late, a big chunk of her neck and shoulder where just....gone. she died before I could call for help. 
> 
> 
> 
> Dr. ████: and I take it that is how you ended up where we found you?
> 
> 
> SCP-213: yea. one of the neighbors heard the noise and the yelling, called the cops. they get there and of course fine me sitting there with blood on my, my mom dead n the floor, and me looking like a wreck. assumptions where made pretty quick. I was still just really confused, so I just went with it. said straight out I did it. long story short, I'm in prison for first degree murder. spent 2 years there figuring out how to work my "talents", so that now I can fully control all of it.
> 
> 
> 
> Dr. ████: why do I feel like there are things you aren't telling me?
> 
> 
> SCP-213: because there are. I don't trust you or the rest of the freaks that run this pit.
> 
> 
> Dr. ████: and why is that? why is it you refuse to allow us to test you, to gain some possibly useful insight on your abilities?
> 
> 
> SCP-213: because you're fucking monsters. remember when you used to send some of those "d class" personnel from the prison I was at into my cell to try and talk to me? yea you where watching them, so they couldn't really say much out loud, but these are cons. cons know how to pass information in secret. notes, words said between sentances, things like that. they told me how they where dropping like flies in here,you guys send them into the cages with these scary ass monsters you got locked up here, if you don't straight out kill them yourself. and you think I don't see the way you look at me? I'm a fucking science experiment to you. I'll be damned if I'm going to show off for you like a lab monkey you sick fuck.
> 
> 
> Dr. ████: haven't you killed over 30 people in the brief time you've had your abilities? do you see yourself as a more decent person then the men and women who work here?
> 
> 
> SCP-213: I only hold myself responsible for one death, and that was an accident. the others where, as far as I'm concerned, self defense, and I refuse to feel guilty about them. look, we can go at this as many times as you want, I love to talk. but I'm not going to show off for you. deal with it. 
> 
> (Subject refuses to respond after this point)




In order to facilitate the viewable use of his powers, introduction of subject to other SCP, namely some of the more dangerous ones, has been considered. no decision has been reached at this time.



**Addendum 213-02:** 
  


Subject has made his first escape attempt. asking for another interview with doctor ████, SCP-213 calmy waited for the doctor to arrive and begin entering his cell. as soon as 2 of the 3 doors where opened, subject rushed to the final door with incredible speed, proceeding to apply his ability, atomizing the door and giving him a clear path out of his cell. subject killed dr. ████, as well as 6 gas squad members during the inital stage of his escape. subject proceeded on through the facility, destroying barriers in order to quicken his travel through the area. unfortunatley due to subject's lack of knowledge of the facility, he unwittingly broke into [[[SCP-517 ]]] 's containment unit. upon seeing him, the SCP-517 attacked in it's usual ferocious manner, slashing and biting the greatly suprised SCP-213. 


during the struggle, SCP-213 was able to apply his ability directly to SCP-517's torso, obliterating it. while he healed from his grievous wounds, SCP-213 has seemingly expended too much power in all his efforts(it is unknown if regeneration takes a toll in the same way his signature power does).


security and heavy weapons where rushed to the site to contain SCP-517 before it regenerated and escaped it's containment, only to be met with an curious sight. while still very much alive, the horribly mangled SCP-17 was seemingly unable to regenerate it's damaged torso. this is highly unusual, as in all other cases the specimen's healing abilities have been more then sufficient to hande any wound it has come across.



using their gained time, staff was able to nuetralize both SCP-213 and SCP-517 without further incident, and repaired both damaged cells while subjects where kept under heavy sedation.



 

Two things of value have been gained from this event. the first being that we now have recorded instances of SCP-213 using his abilities. the second, this has opened up a new possible option for dealing with other difficult SCPs.



possibilities involving SCP-213 and  [[[Scp 682 ]]] are currently being considered.
