**Item #:** SCP-213

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-213 is to be contained within a standard cell furnished with basic items that he already owns, no additional or new items are allowed. This cell should not be adjacent to any room without 10m of gap between walls filled with gaseous materials corrosive to human skin; subject can be informed as to the nature of his housing to prevent misuse of abilities. A staffing of two armed utilizing high-voltage tazer rifles and polymer web grenades should be stationed at all times. Due to the nature of this containment equipment subject should be made fully aware that his life is expendable due to his previous escape attempts.

**Description:** Subject appears to be a Caucasian male in his late teens, 1.90m (6ft,3in) tall, 95.25kg (210lbs). Hair is brown, eyes hazel. Investigation reveals that the subject is a citizen of [DATA EXPUNGED], full name █████ ███ ███ and 19 years of age with full records leading back to birth. Subject claims his ability manifested at the age of 17, with no apparent cause. 

SCP-213 possesses the apparent ability to forcefully sever the bonds between atoms in most any solid or semi-solid matter with physical contact. A highly visible light is produced when doing so, leading some researchers to theorize that he produces a unique type of energy, forced through the structure of objects to nullify their molecular bonds.  Any part of the subject's body can exhibit this power; the subject has used it to disintegrate bullets and shells as they impact his body, provided he knows they are coming.  Extensive use of his ability has proven to leave the subject tired, hungry, and/or dehydrated.

**Addendum 213-01:**

Subject has agreed to interviews at various times, the most productive of which is detailed below:

> <Start of session>
> 
> Dr. ████: When did you first become aware of your abilities?
> 
> SCP-213: I was 17 years old, sitting at the kitchen table eating a sandwich. I had laid it on the table, just relaxing and eating. Then I get a sudden migraine. Used to get them a lot when I was younger. Next thing I know, the table I was touching glows dark blue for a split second, and then it's gone. Just, gone. I freaked out and jumped back, then felt my hand hit something and heard a loud noise. I turn to find I had put my arm clear through the refrigerator door, then flung the thing half way across the room while trying to pull my arm out. Needless to say at that point, I was a bit freaked out.
> 
> Dr. ████: Then what happened?
> 
> SCP-213: My mom comes in freaking out, runs up to me and not even thinking, I put my hand on her shoulder partly touching her neck. Next thing I know, there is the light again. I pulled my hand away as fast as I could, but I was too late, a big chunk of her neck and shoulder were just....gone. She died before I could call for help. 
> 
> Dr. ████: And I take it that is how you ended up where we found you?
> 
> SCP-213: Yeah. One of the neighbors heard the noise and the yelling, called the cops. They get there and of course find me sitting there with blood on me, my mom dead on the floor, and me looking like a wreck. Assumptions were made pretty quick. I was still just really confused, so I just went with it. Said straight out I did it. Long story short, I'm in prison for first degree murder. 
> 
> Dr. ████: Haven't you killed over 30 people in the brief time you've had your abilities? Do you see yourself as a more decent person than the men and women who work here?
> 
> SCP-213: I only hold myself responsible for one death, and that was an accident. The others were, as far as I'm concerned, self defense, and I refuse to feel guilty about them. Look, we can go at this as many times as you want, I love to talk. But I'm not going to show off for you. Deal with it. 
> 
> (Subject refuses to respond after this point)

**Addendum 213-02:** Subject has made his first escape attempt. Asking for another interview with Dr. ████, SCP-213 calmly waited for the doctor to arrive and begin entering his cell. As soon as two of the three doors were opened, subject rushed to the final door and applied his ability, atomizing the door and giving him a clear path out of his cell. Subject killed Dr. ████, as well as two gas squad members during the initial stage of his escape. Subject proceeded on through the facility, destroying barriers in order to quicken his travel through the area. 

Subject up until this point has only seen a sliver of the full scale of the facility and was easily apprehended after he encountered SCP-███ and SCP-███ while searching for an escape route. Breaking through his cell seems to have weakened him enough to prevent further damage to other containments. Subject apprehended in the lounge while being ‘viscously assaulted’ by SCP-131 who had stared him into a corner by a vending machine. On further investigation subject had been told by SCP-076 that they possess ‘Death-Ray Eyes’ if angered and just to stay still until someone comes for them.

**Addendum 213-03:** SCP-213 has agreed to a test to ascertain the level of his ability in exchange for access to one of the staff member’s full collection of ‘Family Guy’ DVDs to watch. During this test an array of material was set on stands and SCP-213 was asked to ‘atomize’ each.

**Glass Bottle Pyramid:** 10 glass Yoo-Hoo bottles arranged atop one another in a pyramid. After 2 seconds of contact with the bottles they flashed to a bright red in color as if exposed to high heat then vanished. A burnt smell lingered in the air at this spot.

**Cinder Block Pyramid:** 10 concrete cinder blocks arranged in a pyramid shape. After 7 seconds of contact the blocks again flashed a red color and vanished. Unusual smell remained, could be smell of burnt concrete but that is not a smell we have experience with so cannot be certain.

**Hustler Pyramid:** 10 Hustler magazines confiscated from ██████ arranged in a stack. Magazines immediately vanished and smell of burning paper remained.

**Dr. █████:** Dr. █████. Subject attempted to vaporize Dr. █████ and was promptly socked in the jaw. Time span of test was .35 seconds. SCP-213 returned to his room where he awoke 30 minutes later and was given pain relief medicine.

**Addendum 213-04:**SCP-213 accidently left his containment. Due to the nature of this escape no reprimand has been issued. According to video feed taken at 3:15am of SCP-213 sleeping, his bed suddenly vanished beneath him along with a section of the floor which he promptly fell through into a boiler in the basement. Changes to SCP-213’s cell floor had not been implemented due to it being pre-existing however repair work now required here will include making the floor the same as other gas containing walls. Noted here is that SCP-213 does not have complete control of his ability as he previously assumed. Following this event SCP-213 has begun to show less aggression toward staff and personnel.
