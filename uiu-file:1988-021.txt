[[size 120%]] **UIU File 1988-021:** Codename "Reptilic Cephalopod"[[/size]]

**Summary:** An event involving an unknown (now-destroyed) giant creature around 100 meters tall, resembling a half-crocodile half-squid hybrid animal, which came out of the Atlantic Ocean to destroy the city-state island of Hy-Brasil.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation became aware of this event following the cessation of all communications from a UIU Extranormal Informant who resided on the island of Hy-Brasil, as well as the FBI Field Office stationed there. Further investigation by UIU Intelligence revealed high activity in the area from nearly-all known anomalous parties, prompting the immediate dispatch of UIU Agent Elliot Watkins to further investigate what happened in Hy-Brasil.

Evidence suggests that the creature, and the ensuing battle to eliminate it, nearly destroyed the island of Hy-Brasil. This creature may have been previously-contained-or-created by anomalous parties, namely either the Global Occult Coalition or the Foundation.

[[tab Suspect Description/Capabilities]]

**Irregularity Cross-reference:** Megafauna, Animal, Hy-Brasil, Investigated

**Physical Description:** Creature appears to have been a 100 meter tall animal with the top-half of its body resembling that of a crocodile with five equally-distanced arms around its body and the bottom-half of its body resembling that of a five-tentacled squid.

**Capabilities:** The creature was, according to UIU Agent Watkins' investigative notes, capable of breathing fire from its mouth up to 60 meters in front of itself. This ability is not fully understood at this time. The creature was also (due to its massive size) able to inflict massive damage to the surrounding area, using its five arms and five tentacles to destroy buildings and grab prey for consumption. The creature seems to have maintained a competent-enough intellect to be capable of hunting intelligent prey, including those hidden inside buildings and motor vehicles.

**Purpose/Motive:** Unknown/Survival

**Modus Operandi:** Despite its size the suspect was highly mobile, sought-out prey for consumption whilst protecting itself from hostile attack, and responded to extreme stress with its anomalous fire-breathing ability.

**Behavior:** The creature behaved in an enraged state from the time that it was first sighted to its elimination by hostile forces, and was highly-destructive in both its hunting and attack patterns.

[[tab Evidence]]

**A: Two Samples of Creature Muscle/Tissue:** Purchased from an elderly man who claimed to formerly be part of an anomalous Chicago group, possibly the Chicago Spirit. This elderly man was also in possession of several photographs of the creature itself, taken during the creature's initial landfall and subsequent attack, which UIU Agent Watkins was unable to purchase due to lack of funds.

**B: Eighteen Photographs:** One day before the UIU's dispatch of Agent Watkins, he was issued a standard Mamiya ZE 35 SLR 35mm camera to document anything suspicious relating to the case. He produced 18 photographs of various locations where the creature had caused significant damage to persons and property, some photos being temporarily withheld and pending release as they depict graphic images of individuals crushed or ripped apart by the creature.

**C: Six Witness Statements:** During the course of Agent Watkins' investigation, he took multiple statements from American citizens (all anomalous individuals, notably) who had resided in Hy-Brasil and witnessed the attack. The witnesses stories all corroborated each other's statements enough to conclusively determine them to be telling the truth, and one anomalous individual, in particular, has requested to be inducted into the US government's Witness Protection Program in exchange for her statement. This request should be noted as pending evaluation by the US Marshals Service, with Agent Watkins listing the anomalous individual as a "critical witness to a classified UIU investigation."

**Foreword:** Excerpt from the Debrief of UIU Agent Elliot Watkins on 08/15/1988.
> 
> **<Begin Log, 22 Minutes Into Debrief>**
> 
> **Assistant Director ████:** "I understand your annoyance, but we're almost done here. So, you listed a Can Man as a 'critical witness' to your investigation. Can you explain this in greater detail?"
> 
> **Agent Watkins:** "Sir, this individual has key information regarding the creature's assault on the island. If she was taken in by WITSEC, we could have her legally brought to the United States to give more in-depth statements on this event."
> 
> **Assistant Director ████:** "Give statements to who, exactly? The courts? No one outside of that island is even aware of what happened there, and we already have your statements. What more could she provide that we need?"
> 
> **Agent Watkins:** "Sir, we can protect her."
> 
> **Assistant Director ████:** "From what? The dead monstrosity that attacked the island? What do you think, that it's going to snitch on her from the grave to a monster mafia?"
> 
> **Agent Watkins:** "We can protect her from the hellhole that the island will inevitably turn into! We can protect her from-"
> 
> **Assistant Director ████:** "Watch your tone, son. Don't you forget that //I// am the one in charge here."
> 
> [There's a brief pause as Agent Watkins collects himself.]
> 
> **Agent Watkins:** "Assistant Director, it is our job to protect American lives when we are able, and we have the opportunity to do so here. This girl is about to be trapped inside an apocalyptic post-disaster on that island, and we have the opportunity- no, //you// have the ability to do something about it. I am pleading that you get her into Witness Protection so that she can be rescued from an inevitably-dark fate if she were to remain on that island."
> 
> **Assistant Director ████:** [Takes a moment to clear his throat.] "Agent, why exactly did you pick this girl for WITSEC? There were other American Can Men in Hy-Brasil, several of whom witnessed the Incident up-close, according to your investigative notes. What is she so significant for?"
> 
> **Agent Watkins:** "Unofficially, sir? She's only 15... and she looks just like my daughter did at that age. She fled America - our nation - to hide from the Skippers and other groups hunting her down. Because we couldn't control what was happening here, she had to run to an anomalous island she had heard about during her time underground and beg them for amnesty. Now, that island has been destroyed and I refuse to abandon an underage American girl in a foreign nation that's decaying before her eyes. She's never committed a crime and yet she's being punished by having everything ripped away... "
> 
> [A 7-second pause commences.]
> 
> **Agent Watkins:** "She deserves to be brought home, sir. She deserves the right to live under the star-spangled banner without fear of imprisonment or execution from the Skippers and Suits, and Witness Protection can keep her identity hidden from both. We both know from what I found that the GOC will kill anomalous witnesses trying to flee the island in order to hide their failures following the Hy-Brasil Incident. I am, as one of the longest agents still serving in the UI-Unit, asking you to grant her that right."
> 
> [A long, 35-second pause commences as the Assistant Director can be heard shuffling paperwork.
> 
> **Assistant Director ████:** "I can't guarantee anything, son. You know that we aren't in charge of WITSEC handling... " [Assistant Director stands up from his chair] "But I'll forward the application to the Marshals. Whether they accept or reject it, I'll let you know."
> 
> **Agent Watkins:** "Thank you, sir." [Agent Watkins shakes the Assistant Director's hand] "That's all I ask."
> 
> **<End Log, Interview Completed After 32 Minutes Elapsed>**
> 
**Closing Statement:** As of 08/31/1988, the above-mentioned request for Witness Protection submitted to the US Marshals Service is still pending review. For further details or to issue an update for this log, contact the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Records Department.

[[tab Bureau Record]]

**Current Status:** Eliminated by an unknown anomalous party on 06/13/1988. Suspected anomalous parties narrowed down to either the Foundation or the Global Occult Coalition. Creature's corpse has been removed by an as-of-this-time-unconfirmed third party, suspected to be Marshall, Carter, and Dark. Case is considered closed.

**Crimes:** N/A, as creatures of the Reptilic Cephalopod's nature cannot be charged with crimes. Also, N/A as Hy-Brasil is not under US government jurisdiction, and therefore crimes committed there cannot be used for prosecution. However, the creature has constituted a grave threat to United States coastal cities if there are others like it, which the Acting Director has deemed to be of critical importance in this investigation. If applicable, the charges of damaging and/or destroying public mailboxes, immigration disruption, inducing a panic, mass arson, destruction of federal property, and terrorism would be applied, in accordance with US federal law.

**Sentencing:** N/A, as the creature has been eliminated effective 06/13/1988.

**History of UIU Action:**

06/13/1988: Initial contact is made by Extranormal Informant Ramone Valtruz during the initial landfall of the creature.

06/17/1988: The EI on Hy-Brasil and the FBI Field Office on the island both fail to submit their weekly reports to the FBI Records Department. The EI's handler, Special Agent Omar Petkin, attempts to contact the EI for updates. When contact failed, Special Agent Petkin attempts to contact the FBI Field Office on Hy-Brasil and Hy-Brasil's Foreign Relations Office. Both calls are dropped. Special Agent Petkin alerts the Assistant Director of the Unusual Incidents Unit of a possible situation on Hy-Brasil.

06/18/1988: Assistant Director of the Unusual Incidents Unit launches an official investigation and discovers that the area is experiencing one of the highest levels of presence between known anomalous parties to-date, and updates the preliminary to an emergency investigation into the situation on the island. That same day, the Assistant Director activates UIU Agent Watkins for deployment to the island to assist in the emergency investigation. Six hours later, UIU Agent Watkins lands on the island of Hy-Brasil and begins immediately investigating the whereabouts of Extranormal Informant Ramone Valtruz as well as the status of the Hy-Brasil FBI Field Office.

06/19/1988: UIU Agent Watkins confirms the FBI Field Office on Hy-Brasil to be destroyed, both crushed and still-ablaze, making document and body retrieval impossible. Agent Watkins then focuses on the remaining investigation of the missing EI.

06/28/1988: The EI is finally located by UIU Agent Watkins at a triage-center-turned-field-hospital and is found to have been gravely wounded with third-degree burns as a result of the creature's fire-breathing capabilities. While the EI is originally found to be responsive and gives a full statement to Agent Watkins regarding the events of 06/13/1988, he succumbs to his injuries on 07/03/1988.

08/08/1988: UIU Agent Watkins informs the UIU's Assistant Director of the completion of his field investigation, and requests egress from the island.

08/15/1988: The EI's body is transferred to the UIU's custody and readied to be sent back to Columbus, OH for burial under an alias name. Both Agent Watkins and the EI's body are then egressed from the island. UIU Agent Watkins is debriefed by the Assistant Director of the Unusual Incidents Unit regarding his investigation.

08/31/1988: Assistant Director of the Unusual Incidents Unit declares all cases and investigations related to the island nation of Hy-Brasil to be closed and sealed immediately, and classifies all records involving such at-minimum as Secret, with the exception of select records being classified as Top Secret as deemed by the Assistant Director himself.

[[tab Additional Notes]]

Following the investigation of the Hy-Brasil Incident, several UIU Department Heads, Agents, and other Unit Officials have since submitted comments and reports on the possibility of more creatures similar to the Reptilic Cephalopod existing, and if so what the UIU (and America as a whole) could do to prevent the tragedies experienced by the Hy-Brasil island from happening to coastal regions in the United States. Also included are the Assistant Director's responses to the statements, if any were made.

These comments, reports, and statements are listed below along with the officials' full names, time with the Bureau (pre-UIU), and time with the UIU itself:

**UIU Extraterrestrial Investigations Department Head - 09/09/1988:**
[[collapsible show="Top Secret Clearance Required" hide="Authority Approved: Welcome SPECIAL AGENT"]]
> **Full Name:** William J. Gardner
> 
> **Years of Service in the Bureau (Pre-UIU):** 2 Years
> 
> **Years of Service in the UIU:** 9 Years
> 
> **Report/Statement/Comments:** "After all my time in the UIU, it has finally happened. I don't care what that deployed Agent's 'investigation' says, that big fucking behemoth of a monster did not come from the Atlantic. No, I //know// that beast came from the sky. There's no other possible explanation of how we didn't notice such a massive creature before now! I strongly recommend to the Assistant Director that he immediately reopen the case under the jurisdiction of the Extraterrestrial Investigations Department, so that we can immediately begin looking into where the creature's UFO is located. Assuming that the UFO crashed into the ocean, thereby making it a USO, we should scour the depths to procure the spacecraft as soon as possible to determine where the creature came from and if this was the forefront of an invasion attempt. Perhaps the creature was sent here to test Earth's defenses, and it just happened to be lucky enough not to piss off Uncle Sam directly! We need to be ready for anything, especially when E.T. himself starts knocking on our door!"
> 
> **Assistant Director Response:** "While I appreciate your... enthusiasm, William, I have no intentions of reopening this case at this time. But if another critical piece of this investigation appears, you have my word on the Bible itself that the Extraterrestrial Investigations Department will immediately be granted full authority over the continuing investigation!"

**UIU Paranormal Investigations Department Head - 09/14/1988:**
[[collapsible show="Top Secret Clearance Required" hide="Authority Approved: Welcome SPECIAL AGENT"]]
> **Full Name:** Selina K. Miller
> 
> **Years of Service in the Bureau (Pre-UIU):** 4 Years
> 
> **Years of Service in the UIU:** 7 Years
> 
> **Report/Statement/Comments:** "Upon reviewing the contents of File 1988-021, I can definitively say that this creature is of paranormal origin. While I cannot designate the exact origin of the creature known as the 'Reptilic Cephalopod,' I suspect that it has been on Earth for at least a few thousand years. Most likely the creature was hibernating that entire time, sleeping in the deepest parts of the Atlantic Ocean. Following up on the investigation of the Reptilic Cephalopod and Hy-Brasil Incident, I believe that the creature was awoken from its slumber by the anomalous nature of Hy-Brasil itself as well as its residents, and attacked it as part of its survival instinct. One would think that the creature would be more interested in attacking Three Portlands, but I suspect that the creature was deterred by our American military-might and instead chose to attack a weaker target! I am immediately requesting that the Paranormal Investigations Department be granted full authority over this case, and to have the case reopened as soon as possible so that we may receive the adequate attention (and therefore, the appropriate funding) to secure the American people from this paranormal entity!"
> 
> **Assistant Director Response:** "While I do appreciate your conviction to protect our beloved Americans from this paranormal entity, I have no plans of reopening this case at this time, Ms. Miller. But if another critical piece of this investigation appears, you have my word on the Bible itself that the Paranormal Investigations Department will immediately be granted full authority over the continuing investigation!"

**UIU Homeland Preparedness Department Head - 09/29/1988:**
[[collapsible show="Top Secret Clearance Required" hide="Authority Approved: Welcome SPECIAL AGENT"]]
> **Full Name:** Adam L. Rochester
> 
> **Years of Service in the Bureau (Pre-UIU):** 1 Year
> 
> **Years of Service in the UIU:** 6 Years (Pending Investigation into Allegations of Foreign Ties)
> 
> **Report/Statement/Comments:** "Mr. Assistant Director, sir, I'm afraid that nothing I am about to report is going to be particularly optimistic, but I plead with you to consider what exactly I've been presented with. Never before in the history of the Unusual Incidents Unit have we been faced with such a colossal enemy, and I'm not entirely sure we are capable of defeating one like this. The sheer size of the creature alone renders most conventional weapons (firearms, mortar platforms, etc.) completely useless in either deterring or destroying the creature. Based on all data we currently possess about the creature, if another like it were to attack an American coastal city or any American island territory, the affected area would be completely lost. Since the only known way of defeating the creature is to deploy the advanced nuclear device that the Global Occult Coalition used in its battle, it is likely that any American city or territory would be destroyed in the effort to defeat the creature. Assuming that we did not have ready access to the GOC's weapons, we would need to ensure the following steps were taken in the event of another Hy-Brasil Incident taking place on United States soil:
> 
> * Following the initial landfall of the creature, the US Army National Guard would begin immediately evacuating civilians from the besieged area, sending all civilians to a designated evacuation center cut-off from the rest of the American population.
> * Once a sufficient majority of civilians were evacuated, the US Army and Air National Guards would begin an all-out assault against the creature, attempting to keep it in the already-besieged area until the next step was complete.
> * The US Air Force would immediately begin preparations to launch a nuclear strike against the creature - no Guard units would be made aware of this step as to ensure their continued assault against the creature, until such time as the nuclear strike eliminates both the creature itself and the surrounding area.
> * The UIU would debrief the President on the situation that has occurred and immediately begin cover-up operations. We would then ask for assistance from 'the Foundation' in 'amnesticizing' all evacuated civilians. Considering the countless times before which we have worked alongside the organization, we know that it is both possible and extremely likely that they would assist us to protect both their secrecy and ours.
> * The UIU would immediately disseminate information blaming the nuclear strike on international terrorism. Following civilian amnestics being completed, the UIU would clear the release all evacuated civilians, allowing other government agencies and non-governmental organizations (FEMA, CIA, American Red Cross, etc.) to proceed from there.
>
> "Undoubtedly, this is a dark scenario. One which none of us ever hope to live through in our lifetimes, but we have to face facts: Our United States military (as it currently stands) has no hope of defeating a creature of this magnitude should another like it appear. I implore you, Mr. Assistant Director, to allow the Homeland Preparedness Department to immediately begin work on a full operation study to put the bullet points above into an actionable plan. Unlike my coworkers in the Extraterrestrial and Paranormal Investigations Departments, I am not requesting this departmental permission as a way of furthering my own insane agenda or receiving newfound funding. I am merely acknowledging that if you truly believe that this creature and others like it could still be a threat to the United States, then we will need these preventative plans formalized as soon as possible.
> 
> "And pray that we may never actually //need// them, sir."
> 
> **Assistant Director Response:** "Mr. Rochester has been placed under investigation for possible communist ties in light of his egregious and unpatriotic remarks regarding our military, as well as those of his coworkers, and for his seeming willingness to openly challenge the UIU's chain of command as it currently stands //beneath// the President's office. This 'plan' of his, which details ideas of sacrificing American soldiers and civilians in order to defeat the creature, are absolutely unacceptable statements and intolerable behavior unbecoming of an FBI Division's Department Head. No further statements from him will be made-or-taken regarding Case 1988-021 or the Hy-Brasil Incident overall until the investigation is complete and has concluded Mr. Rochester has not been compromised by amoral foreign agents."

**UIU Special Agent Petkin - 10/02/1988:**

> **Full Name:** Omar M. Petkin
> 
> **Years of Service in the Bureau (Pre-UIU):** 3 Years
> 
> **Years of Service in the UIU:** 14 Years
> 
> **Report/Statement/Comments:** "As the EI's handler, I feel uniquely qualified to reinforce the fact that if another creature like this were to attack, its ranged attack capability of 60-meter-long fire-breath would do irreparable damage to both organic and inorganic material in the area. I have talked with Agent Watkins personally following his return, and his claims of what Hy-Brasilians told him about the creature's ability are truly chilling, especially considering what he was forced to see with his own eyes during this deployment. According to him, the anomalous fire-breath would burn for days on whatever it had stuck to - much longer than any form of napalm or white phosphorus we've seen. Ramone Valtruz wasn't an evil man, even if he was a criminal EI. He deserved better than to have his skin flake and shed off for two weeks before his death."

Flying saucers and bigfoot are one thing, but a goddamn giant crocodile squid!? What in the actual fuck are we even meant to do to fight this!?

> **Years of Service in the UIU:** 4 Years
> 
> **Report/Statement/Comments:** "Following rumors of a secondary operation involving another deployment to Hy-Brasil by the UIU, I'm stating on the record that this would undoubtedly be a terrible idea. While I do understand that the Assistant Director may want an update on the ongoing situation of the island, this could be more dangerous than usual for American agents operating in foreign territory - especially considering that the indigenous peoples' opinions may have soured since the creature attacked, due to the US government not providing any foreign aid since the disaster. I'm aware that I'm still a new agent compared to some of my veteran colleagues, but I feel that I have enough experience to categorically-advise against deploying American assets to the island in the near-future."

> **Years of Service in the UIU:** 18 Years
> 
> **Report/Statement/Comments:** "I am reporting that any previously-considered deployments to the island of Hy-Brasil are scrapped until further notice. Let's be honest, boys: With the USSR collapsing and one of the lowest rates of anomalous activity in the history of the United States, our funding for operations and investigations is just going to keep getting cut until we can't afford any overseas deployments, period. I doubt that at any point in the future will we be returning to the island - unless the Red Army rebuilds itself in fucking Ireland of all places and convinces all the residents to become Soviets using some kinda anomalous powers. Satellite and signals surveillance will continue until determined by the Assistant Director of the UIU to be unnecessary or unneeded."

With this proud conclusion of a mission accomplished, the newly-appointed Assistant Director of the Unusual Incidents Unit has deemed there to be no further threat from the Reptilic Cephalopod or any other creatures like it to the American populace. As of 04/20/2001, all satellites and signals surveillance assets previously assigned to these regions will be immediately redeployed to assist with other UIU operations that need them. Any further operations, investigations, or surveillance of these areas or any other parts of Case 1988-021 are to cease immediately and not be continued until such time as deemed necessary by the Assistant Director of the Unusual Incidents Unit."
