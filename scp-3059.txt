**Item #:** SCP-3059

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3059 is to be held onsite at least 20 meters away from any and all physical texts, fiction and nonfiction. All electronics are also prohibited within this 20 meter radius. Foundation documentation is not allowed within 50 meters of SCP-3059.

**Description:** SCP-3059 is an 18 year old Hispanic male named Sam Micheals. SCP-3059	 passively affects all fictional and nonfictional literature, written and digital, within roughly 20 meters of it. Affected text is eventually altered to include "Sam Micheals" in some form or the other, with texts closer to SCP-3059 being affected at a faster rate. As texts are affected, the parts of SCP-3059's body closest to the text slowly disintegrate into a fine dust. This dust is then pulled into the text. 

The rate of disintegration is directly tied to the distance of the text to SCP-3059. Once a book has absorbed enough of SCP-3059, Sam Micheals will appear within the text, with their importance within the text being dependent on how much of SCP-3059 the text was able to absorb. The maximum amount of body mass SCP-3059 is able to lose to any given text varies from text to text. While some texts do not progress further than 'Sam Micheals' being mentioned, other texts may change to feature it as a major point within the texts. 

This process is painful to SCP-3059, described as feeling as if it were actually losing the parts that disappeared. All parts which are no longer present continue to function as if they were still there. This process is permanent. As of the writing of this document, 23% of SCP-3059's body mass has been lost.

SCP-3059 was discovered in a library in New York City, New York by police officers, following complaints of a screaming man inside the library. After SCP-3059 was apprehended and taken into custody, it was identified by the John Smith Protocol, and subsequently taken into Foundation custody.

Any changes made to a text are reflected on every single copy of the text produced after the alteration has occurred. In certain texts, mainly nonfictional and historical texts, changes to it may also affect other documentation, creating fictitious people in related media. These fictional people do not actually exist, with details about them being very obscure and vague, often featuring only a single distinguishing feature or feat. Some examples can be seen below. For a current list of all affected texts, please see the SCP-3059 project overseer.

> **Type of Text:** Fiction/Fantasy
> **Title:**  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
> **Author:** J.K. Rowling
> 
> **Excerpt:** Harry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who were doing the spell wrong. Ginny was teamed with Sam Micheals; she was doing very well, whereas Sam was either very bad or unwilling to jinx her.
> 
> **Notes:** There were no other changes made to the text, simply changing the name of the character Micheal Corner                                (a minor character) to Sam Micheals. 

> **Type of Text:** Fiction/Historical
> **Title:**  A Thousand Splendid Suns
> **Author:** Khaled Hosseini
> 
> **Excerpt:** "My name is Sam. I feel you should know the name of the person who must do this to you. I know you do not want to be here and neither do I," the Talib said, "but this is my duty, //hamishira//, so please kneel." Her bible verse was interupted. "What do you mean," Mariam said. "I know it hurts. Trust me, I know, but please, kneel here, //hamishira.// And look down." And in confusion, Mariam did as she was told.
> 
> **Notes:** It seems that not only is SCP-3059's importance to the story affected by the time spent in close proximity, but other character's reactions to differences from the original text.

> **Type of Text:** Dictionary
> **Title:** Dictionary of English Language and Culture
> **Author:** Longman Dictionaries
> 
> **Excerpt:** **Sam Micheals** /sæm maɪkəls/ //proper noun//  The name given to the bleeding vagrant: //My name is Sam Micheals. It hurts. It's like being pulled in a million different directions. I don't know where I am. This place isn't right.//
> 
> **Notes:** It is possible that a degree of SCP-3059's feelings also bleed into the texts as well. The pain and confusion seem to be a recurring theme.

> **Type of Text:** Nonfiction
> **Title:** The Elements 
>  **Author:** Theodore Gray
> 
> **Excerpt:** And I have to thank my good friend, Sam Micheals. It was only with his help and love of the elements that I was able to foster my own. Sadly, he is currently going through great sickness, one that you don't recover from. I wish him luck in dealing with it and in what comes after.
> 
> **Notes:** Theodore Gray was later questioned about the excerpt. He expressed familiarity with the written text and Sam Micheals, despite the fact that he was unable to recall what he looked like or where they met. Research into the possibility of a memetic side affect of the texts are undergoing.

[[collapsible show="Access Interview"hide="Hide Interview"]]
> **Interviewed:** SCP-3059
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Dartshire
> 
> **Date:** 12/23/2008
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Dr. Dartshire:** Good morning SCP-3059. How are we doing today?
> 
> **SCP-3059:** Better, I guess.
> 
> **Dr. Dartshire:** Well that's good to hear. I'm going to ask you some questions now, so we can better understand your affliction, and hopefully stop it. You OK with that?
> 
> **SCP-3059:** Yeah, of course. I'll, uh, I'll try my best anyways.
> 
> **Dr. Dartshire:** Well then, wonderful, let's begin. So then, when did you discover this thing affecting you?
> 
> **SCP-3059:** All at once. It had never happened to me before the library. I was, uh, quite the avid reader, actually. I was returning a book, and I decided I wanted another. So I was looking around. I picked up a book, opened it, and then tried to read it. But I-I couldn't.
> 
> **Dr. Dartshire:** What do you mean?
> 
> **SCP-3059:** When I touched it, blood came out everywhere. The entire library was screaming, yelling at me, and I was bleeding. I blinked and I saw something through my chest. A sword or spear or something, and then I woke up. In the library. All alone. There was blood running down my chest. I could see it. People were saying things, that I was fine, there was no blood, but I could see it. And I couldn't see them. I was trying to stop it, but I couldn't. The books called to it, pulling it in, and I...I... 
> 
> **Dr. Dartshire:** What happened next?
> 
> **SCP-3059:** I blinked and I was lying on the floor. I was bleeding. Everywhere. I called for help, but no one came. I tried to call out for my mom but names kept popping up. I don't know which one was right. I can't remember my family.
> 
> **Dr. Dartshire:** And that's when the police arrived, correct?
> 
> **SCP-3059:** I'm bleeding. I can't stop it, no matter how hard I try. Please, you have to help me. It always hurts.
> 
> **Dr. Dartshire:** [Motions to guards] I think that's all we can get today, no need to press further.

**Addendum-3059-2:**
[[collapsible show="Access Incident Report (Level 4 Access Required)"hide="Access Granted"]]
> **Incident Report:** 3059-1
> 
> **Date :** 13/10/2008
> 
> **Location:** "Valley of the Kings," Luxor, Egypt 
> 
> **Summary:** 
> **8:32 AM:** Several news outlets in Egypt report the discovery of a new tomb in the Valley of Kings, a location near Luxor, Egypt. The news outlets report that not only is it one of the largest discovered, it is mostly untouched. Foundation database intercept key word "Sam Micheals" and take over operations.
> 
> **9:47 AM:** Foundation operations take over unearthing the tomb. Small Exploration team sent in to determine any possible hazards. Once the team returns and gives the go ahead, a full exploration group is formed and sent in. 
> 
> **10:11 AM:** The exploration begins sending in reports. The tomb seems unfinished, with many dead ends and empty rooms. All glyphs found leading up to the main tomb simply read "It hurts." 
> 
> **11:58 AM:** The main tomb is identified. The door to the room features nothing except for a man crouched. 12 Women with what looks like an owl's mask are standing over him, all of them holding spears through his chest. The glyphs below it read "He is sealed."
> 
> **12:17 PM:** The team enters the tomb. The sarcophagus is completely featureless and made out of iron, only being roughly human shaped. The sarcophagus only has a single layer, lacking any other extra layers that would normally be present. The body found within is extracted from the site and sent to Site-19 for identification.
> 
> **Additional Notes:**  Test Results determined that there was a 98.6% match with SCP-3059. 
> 
> //There's something wrong here. Not just the incident, but the entirety of SCP-3059. We are the only ones who have noticed so far. Harry Potter is one of the most popular book series out there, yet not one person noticed the change made, even if it was simple. Then this. The Valley of the Kings has been searched through extensively, and yet no one has questioned how a tomb this large just slipped by unnoticed. Which leads us to another question: What haven't we noticed?// -Site Director Sam ████████
