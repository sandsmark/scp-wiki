**Item:** SCP-415

**Object Class:**  Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-415 is to be kept in human class living quarters, with freedom of movement, although a guard by the door should note his coming and going in a log book.  All of its requests for luxuries should be met if reasonable, provided they do not compromise Foundation security.   This policy should continue as long as SCP-415 remains cooperative, as it is a voluntary committee.  Personnel interacting with SCP-415 have a particular risk of succumbing to sympathy and emotional attachment.  To avoid this, guard examinations and mental health sessions should be issued frequently among such staff (as per psychological guidelines chapters 3-5).  However, this need not be done with a focus against assisted escape attempts, unless SCP-415 becomes uncooperative.

**Description:**  SCP-413 is a 176.9 centimeter tall Caucasian male of 36 years.  He has blue eyes and brown hair (slightly receded), and at first glance appears to be a normal human.  Subject exhibits an average IQ and a relatively stable personality, aside from posttraumatic stress disorder and a slight guilty complex (//see Document 413-C//).  He has conventional interests, particularly board games, and enjoys the company of on-site staff.

SCP-413 possesses regenerative healing abilities, though only in the form of tissue and organ regrowth.  This ability is most pronounced concerning his internal organs, particularly the liver, spleen, pancreas, and colon.  However, his regeneration applies to all tissues and fluids in his body, including his skin, gray matter, nervous system, and skeleton.  Subject can survive for long durations without large pieces of his heart or lungs, which have been shown to regrow in no longer than three months.  However, he is still vulnerable to sickness, radiation, and other ailments not involving direct tissue damage or blood loss.

More worthy of note, SCP-413's body has undergone several radical alterations by an unknown third party.  Subject has had several zippers surgically installed on his body: One curved from his left armpit to the skin over his stomach, one centered directly over his heart, and two smaller ones, parallel to each other on his gut.  In addition:

*  Most of his torso is in fact only covered by a flap of skin that can be lifted at any time, and is currently pinned on by three safety pins and a sewing button.

*  He is covered in numerous scars, most which seem very old, but in some places he still has unhealed wounds or even long lines of stitches done crudely with extremely thick black thread  (the crosses can been seen from far away and raise of the surface of his body in some points more then a centimeter) that fray off in some places.  One particularly noticeable stitching begins on the small of his back and continues up his side until the four rib were it then goes over to the neck and forks into two branches which finish on the shoulders.  In an accident when he was struck with some force and this stitching was severed, his entire left side ripped open and almost all his internal organs spilled out.  There appears to be evidence that this stitching has been undone and resown repeatedly.

*  Attached to his spine is a small wheel that can be turned by a handle, the whole thing resembling a meat grinder.  When cranked, a thick gray fluid comes out of a facet connected to the device.  Due to the intense pain exhibited by SCP-413, it was soon realized that this was the bones in his spine, his nerves, and the neuron links all combined, crushed, and mixed together to resemble paste.

*  Implanted in his rib cage near the start of the bones are four metal hinges on either side.  Investigation with x-rays leads us to believe that when connected to a certain type of machine (which would have to piece the skin and lock into specific notches in the hinges) these metal coverings would facilitate the opening of his abdomen in a easier, more efficient manner.

*  Acting much like the rib implants, there is a steel lining inserted in between the solid bones of the skull, which if a sharp object like a scalpel or knife was slide through, and some pressure applied, would allow the top of his head to be removed.

*  His occipital bones surrounding the left eye have been crushed and remolded in a way that creates a small inward decline that allows the removable of the eyeball by using a pointed tool like a screwdriver and applying some leverage.  This can be done without damaging the organ significantly. 

**Addendum 415-01:**  SCP-415 had been on the run for approximately two and a half years, allegedly hitchhiking, staying in the wilderness, living sporadically in small towns, and almost always in state of movement.  Although no full record of his movements exists, information from interviews and first hand civilian reports have provided a partial travel map.  He was first sighted in New England, fleeing along the east coast of the US, then traveled almost directly into the heart of the Midwest before wandering in a rough circle around that area, participating in farm work and manual labor.  According to SCP-415, he was running from an organization that was hunting him to sell his organs on the black market.  The Foundation came in contact with SCP-413 after he turned himself in to the FBI, asking for protection and action against the group that had allegedly pursued him (though he was doubtful they could assist; he seems to believe that said organization is far beyond the power of normal law enforcement).  An associate brought this case to the Foundation's attention, and SCP-413 eagerly agreed to his capture and containment, accompanying agents to Site 17 after only a few hours of discussion.
