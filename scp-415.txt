**Item:** SCP-415

**Object Class:**  Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-415 is to be kept in human class living quarters, with freedom of movement, although a guard by the door should note its coming and going in a log book.  All of its requests for luxuries should be meet if reasonable and do not compromise Foundation security.   Try to fulfill its demands, as it is a voluntary committee and has been highly cooperative.  Be warned, as it is human, sympathy and emotional attachment are likely.  To avoid this common problem, see psychological guidelines chapters 3-5, and design guard examinations and mental heath sessions around the advice given aside.  However, this should not be done with a focus on preventing assisted escape attempts, for, due to reasons mentioned above, this is unlikely.

**Description:**  SCP-413 is a 176.9 centimeter tall Caucasian male of 36 years old.  He has blue eyes and brown hair, and at  first glance appears to be a normal homo-sapian.  However,  under his left armpit, there is a zipper that starts there and continues down until it reaches  his stomach, going at a slight curve.  There are also three others zippers on his body, one that is centered directly over the heart, and two smaller ones, parallel to each other on his gut.  In addition:

*  Most of his torso is in fact only covered by a flap of skin that can be lifted at any time, and is currently pinned on by three safety pins and a sewing button.

*  He is covered in numerous scars, most which seem very old, but in some places he still has unhealed wounds or even long lines of stitches done crudely with extremely thick black thread  (the crosses can been seen from far away and raise of the surface off his body in some points more then a centimeter) that fray off in some places.  One particularly noticeable stitching begins on the small of his back and continues up his side until the four rib were it then goes over to the neck and forks into two branches which finish on the shoulders.  In an accident where a researcher accidentally bumped SCP-415 and he fell down, hitting his side, we discovered that this stitching is literally the only thing holding him together, for when he was struck with some force, his entire left side ripped open and almost all his internal organs spilled out.  There are implications that this stitching has been done over and over again, and frequently is opened and then closed up.

*  Attached to his spine is a small wheel that can be turned by a handle, the whole thing resembling a meat grinder.  When cranked, a thick gray gruel comes out of a facet connected to the device.  We soon realized this was the bones in his spine, his nerves, and the neuron links all combined, crushed, and  mixed together to resemble paste, when he begin crying out in indescribable pain.

*  Implanted in his rib cage near the start of the bones are four metal hinges on either side.  Investigation with x-rays leads us to believe that when connected to a certain type of machine (which would have to piece the skin and lock into specific notches in the hinges) these metal coverings would facilitate the opening of his abdomen in a easier, more efficient manner.

*  Acting much like the rib implants, there is a steel lining inserted in between the solid bones of the skull, which if a sharp object like a scalpel or knife was slide through, and some pressure applied, would allow the top of his head to be removed.

*  His occipital bones surrounding the left eye are crushed and remolded in a certain way that creates a small inward decline that allows the removable of the eyeball by using a pointed tool like a screwdriver and applying some leverage.  This can be done without damaging the organ significantly. 

Besides these modifications, and the reasons for them (he has regenerative healing abilities which although mostly centered on the regrowth of his internal organs, particularly the liver, spleen, pancreas, and colon also apply to his skin ((giving it a slightly faster rate of healing)) gray matter, nervous system, and skeleton.  He can survive some time without large pieces of his heart or lungs, which will mend no longer then in three months, and it is virtually impossible to kill him by blood loss, for his blood is recreated at almost the same rate as it can be drained.  However, he is still vulnerable to normal human weakness, and can be destroyed almost as easily as anyone else, therefore, treat him with as much care and caution as you would any other human SCP of benevolent intent.  Take protective measures to keep him away from on location radiation, explosive materials, and pathogens.)   he is a average person of ordinary IQ, stable personality (not counting the post traumatic stress and guilty complex ((see Document 413-C)) that his experiences have caused him), and conventional interests.

**Addendum 415-01:**  SCP-415 had been on the run for approximately two and a half years; hitchhiking, staying in the wilderness, living sporadically in small towns, and almost always in state of movement.  Although there does not exist a full record of his travels, information from interviews and first hand civilian reports have provided a partial travel map that shows that he begin in New England, fled along the east coast, then went almost directly into the heart of the Midwest before wandering in a rough circle around that area, during tough jobs, farm work, and manual labor to stay alive.  Even then,  he was constantly on the watch for the organization that presumably was hunting him to sell his organs on the black market, and although he managed to avoid them, several times it was just barely, and there were multiple close calls.  We came into contact with SCP-413 after he turned himself into the FBI, telling them his story, asking for protection, and offering his help to attempt to take down the society that had marked him (although he was doubtful that this particular branch of government could do anything to that effect; he seems to believe that those harvesting him are far beyond the power of normal law enforcement)  An associate brought this case to out attention, and we immediately gave our assistance, proposing an alliance with SCP-413, and safety from the forces troubling him that only we could give.  He agreed quickly, and was in fact overjoyed that something like us existed, accompanying us to Site 17 after only a few hours of discussion.
