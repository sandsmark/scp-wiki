**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation AIs are to analyze all images posted to high-traffic online social media groups centered around the discovery of SCP-2304 instances. Any images found to contain cognitohazardous properties are to be systematically removed from their respective image hosting services and saved to a Foundation server.

**Description:** SCP-2304 is the collective designation for a group of at least 14 images all carrying some degree of cognitohazardous properties[[footnote]]Subdesignated SCP-2304-1 through 14.[[/footnote]]. SCP-2304 instances take the form of common internet memes[[footnote]] Images created and shared by internet users, typically to incite a humorous response from the receiver.[[/footnote]], and are artificially over-processed and edited for comedic effect. All SCP-2304 instances carry the ability to cause spontaneous muscle cell growth upon viewing, often resulting in --death--[[span style="color:blue"]] the constriction of air passages and consequent medical issues. (UPDATED [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3984 2020-09-12]) [[/span]]

**Discovery Log:**
[[div style="display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px"]]
SCP-2304 first came to the Foundation's attention in 2019, after a series of suspicious deaths from constricted airways caused by extreme cell growth in the throat. It was initially classified as an unknown vector, but following the ΩK "End of Death" scenario on 2020-09-12, several surviving victims were located and interviewed to discover the source of the anomaly. A victim of an SCP-2304 instance revealed to Foundation personnel that they had acquired the SCP-2304 instance from an internet relay chatroom, #██████████, under the handle "OxyGenesis". Agent Smith was chosen to attempt to infiltrate this community, under the handle "PebbleTooth".

**Interviewed:** Ryan Romero, handle "commodore69"
 
**Interviewer:** Agent Smith
 
**Foreword:** Romero was detained and brought to Site-56 for interrogation.

= **<Begin Log>**

//Agent Smith enters the interview room.//

**Agent Smith:** Evening, Mr. Romero.

**Romero:** I want a lawyer.

**Agent Smith:** I'm afraid we can't do that.

**Romero:** I'm a US citizen, I have the right to a lawyer. I'm not a dumbass.

**Agent Smith:** You're not in United States government jurisdiction at the moment, sir.

**Romero:** What the fuck do you even want?

**Agent Smith:** We'd just like to know where you acquired the images. Nothing more.

**Romero:** What images?

**Agent Smith:** The ones you posted in #██████████.

**Romero:** ... How do you know about those?

**Agent Smith:** That's not within my clearance to tell you.

**Romero:** It was the fucking new guy, wasn't it? Bastard.

**Agent Smith:** Please answer the question.

//Romero sighs.//

**Romero:** What images //specifically//?

//Agent Smith produces non-anomalous replications of several SCP-2304 instances.//

**Romero:** Oh.

**Agent Smith:** Can you remember where you saved them from?

**Romero:** Yeah. Some of them.

**Agent Smith:** Not all?

**Romero:** #██████████ isn't the biggest source for anart memes. Not by a longshot.

**Agent Smith:** You're in other such chatrooms?

**Romero:** Yeah. A bunch. #██████████████, #█████,#████████.

**Agent Smith:** Why would you willingly expose yourself to harmful mind-affecting phenomena?

**Romero:** I mean, I guess it's the same reason people drink or do drugs.

**Agent Smith:** An addiction?

**Romero:** Not... entirely? There's definitely an aspect of it, but I think it's more...

//Romero hesitates.//

**Agent Smith:** What's wrong?

**Romero:** I think it's more the feeling you get when you're driving along the highway and have the urge to swerve into the oncoming lane.

**Agent Smith:** I- I'm not familiar with it.

**Romero:** Fucking-

//Romero breathes deeply.//

**Romero:** No, you do. Because if you don't, I'm just fucked, and I'm not willing to believe that.

**Agent Smith:** Okay, so, this fee-

**Romero:** Yeah, it's like that. It's just- It's so much easier to end things than to deal with shit.

**Agent Smith:** Well, we don't get to make that choice.

**Romero:** Tha- That's the fucking thing. I can actually do it, I can open the damn link and //if//, for some fucking reason, it actually kills me, my last thoughts won't be about how many other people I hurt.

= **<End Log>**

**Closing Statement:** Investigations into the provided chatrooms are currently ongoing.
