title:Incident 668 A
+ Incident: Retrieval of SCP-668, "13 inch chef's knife"

SCP involved: [[[SCP-668]]]

Personnel involved: (DATA EXPUNGED]

Date: (REDACTED)

Location: (REDACTED)

Description: On ██-██-█████, ███ ████ City police department, Precinct ██, responded to reports of a man attacking and killing bystanders with a large chef's knife at a local mall. Upon responding, officers discovered fifteen casualties, most of whom had been ritually flensed in a manner described by witnesses as "horrific." Officers discovered the suspect (an escaped serial killer named ████████ ███████, hereon referred to as "Suspect") in the child's daycare area in the process of filleting and consuming a 9-year old boy. Officers ordered Suspect to cease desist. Suspect did not comply. Officers then attempted to fire upon Suspect, but discovered that they were unable to pull the trigger. Officers then attempted to flee, but found themselves unable to do so after Suspect declared his intention to "rape and murder every last one of you motherf███ing pigs."

Suspect then proceeded to [DATA EXPUNGED] ending with the only female officer present: Cynthia Wallis, an SCP Operative embedded as an observer with the ██PD. Despite being under severe psychic assault, Officer Wallis (a pseudonym) managed to activate her emergency transponder located in her belt while complying with Suspect's orders to ████████, alerting the Foundation of the situation. Her bravery is to be commended, and her next of kin shall recieve her death benefits in the form of a lucky lottery ticket (Note: contact █████████ State Lottery Commission re: Andrew Wallace).

SCP Mobile Task Force Upsilon-9 ("Durendal's Shards") arrived on the scene ██ minutes later, disguised as an "FBI Special Antiterrorist Task Force." Upsilon-9 breached the perimeter at ████:██:██, corresponding with the moment that Officer Wallace's vital signs telemetry ceased transmitting. Task Force members discovered Suspect standing outside the █████████ department store on the third floor of the mall. The police officers' bodies were found suspended from the third floor railing, skin flensed and arranged the form of wings, entrails removed and trailing to the floor. Officer Wallace's body was found [DATA EXPUNGED]. SCP Operatives then attempted to terminate Suspect, only to discover that they too were unable to fire their weapons. Team Leader █████████ transmitted a Class 1, Type 73 Mimetic Attack Alert to command and ordered the team to withdraw: this order failed when Suspect stated his intention to, "find out what all your insides look like." Team Upsilon-9 then made the decision to self-terminate using surgically installed cranial detonators: transmission logs indicate that the Team Leader's final words were, "Sorry, but we're not going to play your games. You'll have to find some other toys to play with, sicko."

Command then ordered termination procedures be carried out according to emergency protocol. All personnel aware of the nature of the situation were ordered under information lockdown. A remotely operated sniper rifle was installed on a building 0.5 kilometers away by SCP Operatives who were not informed of the nature of the package nor the reason for installing it. A lobotomized Class D Personnel, equipped with locked night vision goggles to hide the details of the scene, was ordered to observe a particular mall window and say "now," when anyone passed in front of it. Yet another lobotomized Class D Personnel was ordered to listen in to the second and press a button linked to the sniper rifle upon being told to do so. Finally, an SCP Operative was ordered to enter the facility and attempt to lure Suspect into passing in front of a certain window in the mall.

The operation was a success: by breaking down the procedure beyond several personnel, none of whom were aware of the significance of their actions, none of the personnel were aware that their actions were related to terminating the Suspect, confirming SCP Foundation's hypothesis as to the nature of the device. Suspect's remains were later retrieved by a "bomb defusing" robot and placed in a box lined with [[[SCP-148]]] before being retrieved by Foundation personnel.

Controlled testing has determined that the Suspect's weapon (13 inch chef's knife) was the active agent in the incident, emitting a psionic command that [DATA EXPUNGED]. Suspect's remains are to be sent to ██PD along with a replica knife. The original weapon is to be designated [[[SCP-668]]] and sent to Site-19 for further testing. How the suspect acquired [[[SCP-668]]] is unknown at this time.
