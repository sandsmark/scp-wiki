**Special Containment Procedures:** An investigation is ongoing into the causes of SCP-4852. Objects relevant to Incident 4852.7 are stored in Site-19 Evidence Locker 38E.

**Description:** SCP-4852 was an event that occurred on January 18th, 2013, that consisted of Foundation Site-19's Research Wing A spontaneously manifesting a proportionately sized pair of legs, superficially resembling those of a domesticated chicken. Research Wing A, provisionally designated SCP-4852-A, used these legs to tear itself from the rest of Site-19 before turning and running in a southwesterly direction at 21 km/h. A research conference had been scheduled in the wing, resulting in several prominent personnel gathered in the area during the event.

**AKTUS:** Y-yes, nothing I'm not used to. Though I have to say, the floor shaking is a new symptom. Maybe vertigo - nausea?

**OVERWATCH-COMMAND:** Gone? Is it destroyed?

**S19-COMMAND:** It's, uh, it's running away.

**S19-COMMAND:** It's just sprinting outta here. Ditched the rest of the facility.

**S19-COMMAND:** Yeah. Looks like fucking Baba Ya- hold on, we're getting a signal from inside the wing.

**OVERWATCH-COMMAND:** Oh Christ.

**S19-COMMAND:** Dr. Crow, I assure you, we're doing our best-

**S19-CROW:** You ever seen a dog in a moving car? Three words: slip and slide, bud! I'm getting the hell outta here before I lose my lunch.

**OVERWATCH-COMMAND:** Dr. Crow, that's dereliction of duty.

**OVERWATCH-COMMAND:** Probably.

**S19-BRIGHT:** Hello? Hello? Come in?! Did Clef break the fuck--

**S19-COMMAND:** Oh hel- Tom? That you?

**S19-BRIGHT:** It's Bright, you dolt.

**S19-COMMAND** You sound an awful lot like Tom.

**S19-BRIGHT:** And why do you think that is?

//[Silence for 4 seconds.]//

**S19-COMMAND** Oh.

**S19-BRIGHT:** Yeah. Don't worry, I'm putting his body to better use than he ever did. Slob.

**OVERWATCH-COMMAND:** Signal in, what's going on in there? Why'd the signal go out earlier?

**S19-BRIGHT:** Clef tried to fucking shoot me. Actually I have to give credit where it's due, he shot me. Really nailed me, it was great. Props.

**S19-COMMAND:** You're not like... hurt, though, right?

**S19-BRIGHT:** I'm immortal, not invulnerable. Getting shot still fucking hurts. Anyway, you guys need to get me the fuck out here. Ben's lost it, he keeps telling us how we could end this right now if we pulled a Battle of Hoth. I don't even know what that means!

**OVERWATCH-COMMAND:** Okay, does he-

**S19-COMMAND:** You never watched Star Wars? Seriously?

**S19-BRIGHT:** Believe it or not, I have better things to do than watch campy sci-fi.

**OVERWATCH-COMMAND:** Okay, that's really not important right now. Bright, can you tell where you are?

**S19-BRIGHT:** I'm in the break room.

**OVERWATCH-COMMAND:** I meant geographical- why are you in the break room?

**S19-BRIGHT:** What the hell am I supposed to do? Everyone's in their headquarters.

**OVERWATCH-COMMAND:** What? Okay, explain from the start.

**S19-BRIGHT:** After Clef fucking //shot me//, Kondraki raised hell while someone got me to a new body. Well, they tried, I just took theirs instead, faster. When I came back to, Crow told me that half the researchers had taken up with Ben and holed up in the office block and the other half are supporting Clef because I guess their hate for Ben outweights their fear of Alto.

**S19-COMMAND:** It's been like an hour holy shit. How did you guys already go Lord of the Flies?

**S19-BRIGHT:** These people are crazy. I think I saw someone about to be sacrificed.

**S19-COMMAND:** Oh, like Luke in Return of the Jedi. Oh wait, you'd only get that if you've watched Star Wars.

**S19-BRIGHT:** Wow.

**OVERWATCH-COMMAND:** Can you get ahold of Crow? Where are you two?

**S19-BRIGHT:** Uh, yeah, he's right here. We're in the mech lab, he's trying to- YOU MOTHERFUCKER!

**OVERWATCH-COMMAND:** What on Earth is going in there?

**S19-BRIGHT:** He finally got it working.

**S19-COMMAND:** What working?

**S19-BRIGHT:** The fucking egg walker.

**AFTERWORD:** Immediately following this, SCP-4852's advance was momentarily halted by an explosion punching a hole in its exterior. An object exited this hole at high velocity, crashing into a nearby thicket. Agents discovered Dr. Crow in a modified version of his Type-2 Oblong Walker, having sustained only minor injuries. Afer being extracted from the wreckage and purging on the paramedics, he was returned to the main portion of Site-19 for medical treatment.

**S19-KATHERINE:** Why's that?

**S19-KONDRAKI:** I just said so! Because he's insane! He's a violent, paranoid maniac! Which is why we need to kill him before he does anything!

**S19-KONDRAKI:** They're not coworkers anymore, Kathy. They're competition. We have to prioritize our own survival! We cannot let that psychopath kill us all!

**__LOCATION:__** 59 KM SW of Site-19, TN.

**__STATUS:__** Concluded.

**__TIME:__** 11:49 PM (local time) January 18, 2013

**__DISRUPTION CLASS:__** Keneq

----
**__EVENT SUMMARY:__** SCP-4852-A ceased movement and squatted down. Over the following 12 minutes, the facility produced 5 metal ellipsoids, each roughly 3m in diameter and 4m in height, and dropped them to the ground in a small pile. Each object was found to be constructed of riveted steel with a Foundation seal emblazoned on top.

Following the laying of the fifth object, SCP-4852-A stood up, moved several meters forward, squatted again, and demanifested its legs, dropping the facility to the ground. No further anomalous activity recorded.

Upon disassembly, each metal object was found to contain a full set of blueprints for Site-19.

**S19-COMMAND:** And you never saw fit to intervene? Try to establish order?

**S19-AKTUS:** Everyone at this godforsaken site is deranged. They probably would've tried to draw and quarter me. Besides, I had money riding on this game.

**S19-COMMAND:** ... I see. And do you have any idea what could have caused SCP-4852?

**S19-AKTUS:** Oh, is that what it's being called? Frankly, I don't think it should be an SCP file, most of your addenda will just end up being boring transcripts. But, no, I have no idea what definitively caused the event.

**S19-COMMAND:** You make it sound like you have a good guess.

**S19-AKTUS:** You ever heard of the term cuckoo's nest?

**S19-COMMAND:** Insane asylum, right?

**S19-AKTUS:** That's right. You guys put the most anomalous,  craziest people on the payroll into the same building housing the most magic objects in the world.
