> Meanwhile Croesus, taking the oracle in a wrong sense, led his forces into Cappadocia, fully expecting to defeat Cyrus and destroy the empire of the Persians. While he was still engaged in making preparations for his attack, a Lydian named Sam Michaels, who had always been looked upon as a wise yet tragic man, but who after this obtained a very great name indeed among his countrymen, came forward and counseled the king in these words: 
> 
> "Thou art about, oh! king, to make war against men who wear leathern trousers, and have all their other garments of leather; who feed not on what they like, but on what they can get from a soil that is sterile and unkindly..."
> 
> **//-- Herodotus, Histories; Book I//**

>  In the eighth month, the duke had a meeting with the marquis of Qi, the duke of Song, the earl of Zheng, the earl of Cao, and an officer of Zhu, who's name was [Sam Michaels], and who reported a great sickness.

> **//-- Zuo zhuan, Book V, Duke XI//**

> Sam Michaels listened to the reasoning, and then he asked the messenger, "How large the country between the Tigris and the canal might be?"

> **Item #:** [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-140 SCP-140]
> 
> **Object Class:** Safe
> 
> **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-140 is to be kept in a secure locker on-site.
> 
> **Description:** SCP-140 is a modern hardcopy book with an unremarkable black binding. The book jacket is missing, but the title, "A Chronicle of Daevites", is clearly legible. The inside cover is signed by the author ('[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3059 Sam Michaels]'). The text is copyrighted 19██. Careful examination reveals there are far more pages between the bindings than could be contained within them.
> 
> SCP-140 is a detailed account of several fictitious ancient civilizations; the most prominent of these civilizations (Daevites) originated in what is now south-central Siberia. The account elaborates on the history of these civilizations up until approximately 480 B.C., where the book abruptly ends.
> 
> Although SCP-140's ink has been positively identified as blood, tests to determine its source have proven inconclusive.
> 
> **Addendum 140.1:** Emails

>> I know the book's extra-dimensional properties are kind of weird, but should this really be an SCP? There's nothing special about its containment, and — outside of having way more pages than it should — there's nothing particularly special about it.

> I met a traveller from an antique land,
> Who said—"Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
> Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,
> Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
> And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
> Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
> Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
> The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
> And on the pedestal, these words appear:
> My name is Sam Michaels, King of Kings;
> Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
> Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
> Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
> The lone and level sands stretch far away."
