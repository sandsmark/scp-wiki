**Item #:** SCP-2542

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment is focused on seizing and destroying any knowledge of SCP-2542 and all evidence thereof. This is to be maintained through destruction of all instances of SCP-2542-A and working in conjoint efforts with local police departments to seize and then destroy all SCP-2542-A instances currently in circulation. 

Foundation AI (ATLS-20 and GRGN-04) are to monitor websites dedicated to usage of illegal drugs and their related paraphernalia and also websites in which users more likely to perform these activities congregate for mention of SCP-2542, SCP-2542-A, or the description of a DIONYSUS-12 Event.

SCP-2542-A is to be destroyed by a contingent of D-Class who have been shown to be repeat drug offenders with no history of theft. All D-Class who return from a DIONYSUS-12 Event are to be interviewed. If the D-Class returns deceased, another is to be brought to fill its place. When the D-Class stops undergoing DIONYSUS-12 Events (defined as a period of four months without an occurrence) they will be amnesticized and released back into the general populace, due to their non-violent offenses.

All researchers studying SCP-2542 and SCP-2542-A are to undergo mandatory weekly drug screenings. Any failure will result in Class-C amnestics, a demotion, and transfer to another site.

As of 3-1-12, all experiments involving theft of SCP-2542-A from SCP-2542 are forbidden.

**Description:** SCP-2542 is a humanoid of indeterminate species and origin which exists in what is theorized to be a self-contained pocket dimension. Initial access to SCP-2542's dimension is contingent upon knowledge of the entity, its nature, and a desire to engage in commerce with it. No procedure is necessary to enter, taking an average of three minutes from initial desire to disappearance. Knowledge of SCP-2542 is not necessary for transportation stemming from consumption of SCP-2542-A.

SCP-2542-A is a plant superficially resembling cannabis, in terms of smell, appearance, and THC content. SCP-2542-A is more closely related, however, to plants of the //Rafflesia// genus. The primary anomalous property of SCP-2542-A is its apparent indestructibility. While the plant can be ground up, the particles will not be destroyed unless burnt by an individual with a desire to become intoxicated. 

After an individual has used SCP-2542-A for the purposes of intoxication, at any point until the THC fully leaves their bloodstream, they can be subject to a DIONYSUS-12 Event. A DIONYSUS-12 Event involves the subject disappearing at random and entering SCP-2542's pocket dimension. Individuals who undergo a DIONYSUS-12 Event describe the time spent in SCP-2542's dimension as awkward and tense, mostly due to SCP-2542's seeming unfamiliarity with human biology.

When an individual has entered SCP-2542's dimension in order to obtain SCP-2542-A, SCP-2542 shows a strong preference to making deals that benefit the buyer in question. It is unclear if this is due to some form of good nature on the behalf of the entity or if it is an attempt to spread SCP-2542-A. SCP-2542 accepts money, IOUs, and objects of sentimental value. It is worth noting that SCP-2542 makes no attempt to seek the money owed. Despite this, all individuals who undergo a DIONYSUS-12 Event express discomfort surrounding SCP-2542. Normally, an individual will not be involved in more than three DIONYSUS-12 events, but individuals involved in more than ten have been recorded.

SCP-2542 remains amicable with all subjects unless an individual attempts to steal SCP-2542-A. All forms of theft are met with extreme aggression and then death. The remains of these individuals return to where they were taken from within one week, though some have been kept for up to six months. Autopsies confirm that while the bodies may appear to have undergone unusual injury, the subjects were alive for the majority of time spent in SCP-2542's dimension.

**Interview 2542-1A:**

[[collapsible show="+ Level-2 Clearance Necessary=" - Access Granted"]]
> //SCP-2542-A was discovered due to an uncharacteristic and unprecedented increase of illegal cannabis sale in Cleveland, OH, which was connected to a series of brutal murders following what was called “impossible disappearance(s).” When the cannabis was all found to be both indestructible under normal circumstances and more closely related to rafflesia than any other plant, the Foundation inserted itself into all attempts to apprehend those responsible.//
> 
> //Daniel Sheridan (POI-2542-1) was quickly found to be the source of this upswing in cannabis sales. Due to his prior work as a clerk at a local bookstore, the methods by which he was able to produce and/or procure SCP-2542-A were deemed to be anomalous, resulting in Foundation agents taking charge of all interviews. Herein is the first interview where the nature of SCP-2542 was established.//
> 
> **Interviewer:** Are you comfortable? Do you need something to drink?
> 
> **Daniel Sheridan:** I'd like my lawyer is what I'd like. I didn't do any of that killing. That was him.
> 
> **I:** We're a little beyond that right now, Mr. Sheridan. I'd like you to tell me who this him was.
> 
> **DS:** Tayn't. Like, some weird elf devil name. T-A-Y-N-apostrophe-T. God. Fuck. I sound crazy. You're not going to believe me, are you?
> 
> **I:** I can't help you unless you tell me the truth. No matter how it sounds. How did you meet it?
> 
> **DS:** I didn't summon him or anything. I didn't sell my soul. I just, I don't know. I really wanted to get high. Really bad. And I just, I don't know. I kept wishing. And I think he heard me.
> 
> **I:** And Tayn't is the source of this marijuana you've been selling?
> 
> **DS:** I don't know if he grows it or anything. Or how he grows it. Uh, he doesn't live, well, here. I don't know. He doesn't live where we do.
> 
> **I:** Please explain, Mr. Sheridan.
> 
> **DS:** When you think of him, when you want it really bad, when you're jonesing, you just, I don't know, close your eyes. And you're there. It's wet. It smells terrible. It's dark, but I can see just enough. Things are glowing, but you can't tell where they are. It's hot. You know those ugly fucking smell flowers? The Pokemon one and the one that looks like a dick? They were everywhere. It was, uh, rot. That's where he lives. You think I'm crazy.
> 
> **I:** I've heard stranger. Continue.
> 
> **DS:** He lives in, like, a hut. It's filled with bugs. It's noisy. And it gets hotter the more you come in. But it's opulent, man. He's got, like, beetles fighting each other in cages right next to fucking, like, entire barrels of weed. And it was all good stuff. All purple. It smelled like heaven, and I wanted to sit right next up to it, because everything else smelled so bad. The bugs were everywhere, man.
> 
> **I:** Can you describe him to me?
> 
> **DS:** Big. He was always tall. He had weird ears. Sometimes sharp, all weird elf shit, but sometimes he didn't have any, just these weird holes. Lizard shit. Sometimes, he had a neck tattoo. It was always something gross. Something that didn't make sense. Like he saw a few hardasses in real life and tried to do it himself.
> 
> **I:** Can you give me an example?
> 
> **DS:** A gun with a vagina in it.
> 
> **I:** I see. Go on.
> 
> **DS:** I don't know. He just looked like something weird trying to be human. It was so fucking hot and humid in there, but he had the best weed. And I realized that, well, he didn't know what shit was worth. I remember the first time I got, like, ten ounces for fifty bucks. It was crazy. It was a fucking garbage bag. And he didn't bat an eye. Which would've been understandable, since I think a bug was crawling on it or something. But, I figured, all I had to do was hang out with this, uh, magic weed guy, and I'd keep buying weed from him. I've always had weird, obnoxious drug dealers, but this guy was worth it. I mean, he said a lot of weird things. He did weird stuff. And like, sometimes it'd be hard to look at him without getting a headache, but the stuff I got him from him was better than anything I'd ever had.
> 
> And he was, uh, nice to me, you know. Seemed to care about my problems. Always fronted me without shit. Since he was some weird elf demon thing, I figured he'd like sentimental items, you know? Like I figured they held magic. And I don't know if he was just doing it to be nice, or if he was, but he would always take, like, this crappy plastic rosary my grandma gave me when I was ten and give me, I don't know, fucking, sixty ounces like some fucking god kingpin amount.
> 
> **I:** Did he ever refuse a barter?
> 
> **DS:** Offered him my old PlayStation 2 memory card. He said he hated video games. He still gave me a few ounces as an apology. Like I said, he was really weird, but I think, he was ultimately a good guy.
> 
> **I:** Yet you say he was behind these murders?
> 
> **DS** I told my friend about him. My friend Johnny. I needed someone to hold onto this weed. I needed someone to help me deal. I told him how to meet Tayn't, and he did. He was a great partner. Knew him since grade school, you know. But he always got greedy. Always mouthy. Couldn't hold a secret either. Stupid idea.
> 
> **I:** Why would Tayn't harm your friend?
> 
> **DS:** Johnny'd been stealing from him for a while. Told some friends like him about the magic elf we got weed from. They'd all been stealing from him for a week before Tayn't found out.
> 
> **I:** What makes you believe Tayn't is behind these disappearances?
> 
> **DS:** Last time he called me. His place was hotter than hell. I was more nervous than I'd ever been. He was all teeth and darkness, and the smell was horrible. He was a plant, but he looked more like sharp. Like a rock. I pissed myself. I remember he told me I was a bad friend for inviting thieves into his home. I don't remember much. I don't think he spoke language so much as screamed. And, I never found him again. Week later, Johnny's body turned up all fucked up. People thought it was me, or a rival drug dealer. Then the others happened.
> 
> **I:** Do you believe Tayn't to be behind the disappearance and reappearance of people who took the marijuana you received from him?
> 
> **DS:** I mean, it makes sense. He always seemed like he wanted a friend. No one gives that much unless they need something in return. Liked having me visit. Maybe he'll find another bud. Hope no one else takes shit from him, though. Never thought he'd get so mad. I'm lucky I never got caught, I guess.
> 
> **I:** Thank you, Mr Sheridan. I'll leave you here, and we'll get you as much help as we can.
> 
> //Using this information SCP-2542 was contained and confirmed through D-Class ingestion of SCP-2542-A causing DIONYSUS-12 Events. Daniel Sheridan was amnesticized and charged for drug dealing. The murders were ruled to be aggression from rival drug dealers.//

**Exploration Log 2542-3C:**
[[collapsible show="+ Level-2 Clearance Necessary=" - Access Granted"]]
> //After ten successful DIONYSUS-12 Events, D-2542-34 was prepped with an audio-visual recording device. D-2542-34 was ordered to steal a sample of SCP-2542-A in order to judge if closeness would change SCP-2542's usual reaction to theft. D-2542-34 was ordered to summon SCP-2542 and gain entrance.//
> 
> //Upon D-2542-34's entrance into SCP-2542's dimension, cameras malfunctions momentarily. Sensors indicate that the temperature is 39°C. While visibility is low, various rafflesia and titan arum are observed growing uncharacteristically in the muck.//
> 
> **D-2542-34:** Never gets less gross.
> 
> **CONTROL:** D-2542-34, could you examine the ground?
> 
> //D-2542-34 refuses for several minutes but is cajoled to stick his hand in the muck. It is shown to be a black clay mixed with brackish water. There are no signs of life in the water.//
> 
> **CONTROL:** That's enough. Make your way to SCP-2542.
> 
> //As D-2542-34 walks further into darkness, the temperature rises to 41°C. Eventually, D-2542-34 comes to what is identified as SCP-2542's home. It is a cabin made from rotting wood, though its dimensions shift irregularly, and as D-2542-34 walks closer to the door, the sound of insect cries (most currently unidentifiable) become louder.//
> 
> //SCP-2542 comes to the door and welcomes D-2542-34 inside. Sensors indicate the temperature inside is over 45°C. Inside, as described, are a number of containers filled with SCP-2542-A, but also cages containing unidentifiable species of beetle.//
> 
> //SCP-2542 appears naked and in a roughly humanoid form, lacking nipples and having what looks to be a series of roots instead of genitalia. Its ears are long and pointed, pierced at the lobes with an unidentified bone in each. Its body is in constant motion and undulation.//
> 
> **SCP-2542:** Sorry for the nudity, my man. I was just in the middle of my bug time. You know all about my bug time, right, guy?
> 
> //D-2542-34 nods and tries to avert his eyes from the nudity. SCP-2542 bends over and wraps itself in a sodden robe, discolored by age and covered in various forms of fungus.//
> 
> **D-2542-34:** Uh, why do you keep it so hot in here, anyway, Tayn't?
> 
> **SCP-2542:** //[Its mouth widens in what is most likely an approximation of a smile.]// I like to turn the heat up. To get myself a little nervous. I think better when I'm nervous, don't you?
> 
> //D-2542-C coughs and looks at the ground. The insects that cover the floor are unidentifiable, and there are frog-like creatures with a kind of carapace. Footage is brought back to SCP-2542 as it begins to speak again.//
> 
> **SCP-2542:** So, what didja need, my big man? I got the shit for your signs. Wanna bite of this shit? It's the fantastic stuff. I love it.
> 
> //SCP-2542 reaches down to the floor and picks up a creature resembling a frog, biting the head and two front legs. It offers the rest to D-2542-34, who declines.//
> 
> **D-2542-34:** Hey, is it cool if we put this down as an I owe you type thing? I, uh, well, you know. They don't give me money.
> 
> //SCP-2542 makes a screeching noise that has been identified as laughter.//
> 
> **SCP-2542:** We're all trapezoidal, my fine feathered friend. You got the bug time; you got the bug rhyme. Do you understand? We're all good. We're all so good. I got just the time for you. All stuffed.
> 
> //SCP-2542's body begins to undulate and stretch, which has been shown to be an attempt to put the other party at ease. As SCP-2542 turns around to look deeper into its cabin, D-2542-34 attempts to grab a handful of SCP-2542-A from a nearby truncheon.//
> 
> //As D-2542-34 begins to stow away the SCP-2542-A, SCP-2542's arms slides out from the darkness and takes his hand. At the moment, sensors indicate the temperature to be 50°C. SCP-2542 produces a long sustained croaking noise. D-2542-34 begins to scream as the skin of his arm sloughs off with a pull from SCP-2542.//
> 
> **SCP-2542:** I would've given you so much more. //[Here, SCP-2542's voice is distorted, as though coming through water.]// So much of me to give.
> 
> **D-2542-34:** They made me! They made me! They—
> 
> //The footage cuts out. D-2542-34's body appeared a month later at his barracks. His body was covered in bites from unidentified insects. The bites were at various stages of healing, indicating he received them while still alive. His stomach and lungs were shown to be filled with finely ground SCP-2542-A, believed to be the cause of death.//
