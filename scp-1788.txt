**Item #:** SCP-1788

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment of SCP-1788-1 is currently impossible. Embedded agents in various governments, including those of ███████, ██████, and ███ ██████ ██████ ██ ███████, are encouraging the creation of anti-obesity measures, as a means of making SCP-1788-2 instances more visible. Any suspected instances of SCP-1788-2 are to be reported immediately to Armed Biological Area-223 Command. Personnel are not to engage suspected instances and should retreat immediately.

The Foundation currently has seven (7) instances of SCP-1788-2 imprisoned in Armed Biological Area-223. Contact with these instances is strictly forbidden outside of approved experiments. Each instance is to be housed in a separate humanoid containment cell. Feeding and cleaning requirements are laid out in document 1788-CF. All guards assigned to this area must wear ear protection with sound-neutralization capabilities.

No more SCP-1788-2 instances are required for current research purposes; any newly-discovered instances of SCP-1788-2 are preemptively cleared by O5 command for immediate termination by Armed Mobile Task Force Tau-4 ("All Things Bright and Dutiful").

**Description:** SCP-1788-1 is the collective designation for a set of artificially created biological implants. When successfully implanted into a prepubescent human, this human becomes an instance of SCP-1788-2. These individuals are highly dangerous on reaching adulthood and are considered high-priority targets. Currently the creator(s) of SCP-1788-1 is unknown; groups of interest are being investigated. Finding the origin of SCP-1788-1 is considered a //Sindri//-level priority.

On reaching adulthood, SCP-1788-2 instances display predatory behavior towards prepubescent humans. Typically, they will settle in a large urban center, find a form of white-collar employment,[[footnote]]They will usually not seek employment in a job where they would work directly with children. Presumably this is to limit suspicion.[[/footnote]] then begin tracking prepubescents in the area. Approximately once every six (6) months, an SCP-1788-2 instance will attempt to abduct one of the prepubescents it has been tracking and take them to a remote or otherwise unobserved location, where it is dismembered and partially devoured.[[footnote]]In particular, SCP-1788-2 instances consume all of its victims' neural tissue. It is currently theorized that this provides the majority of the required elements, and that other flesh is consumed as part of a ritualized feeding behavior.[[/footnote]]

Little information has been gathered from captured instances of SCP-1788-2. Instances are of above-average intelligence,[[footnote]]More detailed observations are difficult to make, as instances refuse to take standardized exams, become aggressive and uncooperative when forced to answer questions, or are otherwise unwilling or unable to comply with tests.[[/footnote]] and show extremely strong resistance to compulsion, coercion, torture, [[DATA EXPUNGED]], and other forms of information extraction. Every instance to date has also shown signs of malignant narcissism and psychopathy; they generally have a complete lack of empathy while also showing keen psychological insight. Furthermore, SCP-1788-2 instances apparently have an anomalous effect, transmitted vocally, which allows them to convince listeners of the truth of any statement they make. For these reasons, among others, unauthorized contact with SCP-1788-2 instances is strictly forbidden.

Individual instances generally do not voluntarily gather or interact, except for the purposes of mating; in fact, when two or more instances are placed in the same environment, they typically fight for dominance. This behavior is not gender-linked; females and males will fight one another in addition to their own genders, and in a mixed-gender group there will be only one dominant individual, who may be male or female. Captured instances are housed separately to minimize damage. Multiple instances have been seen in the same general urban area, but never in a ratio greater than 1:100,000 normal humans.[[footnote]]This behavior is similar to other apex predators.[[/footnote]]

Mating season apparently occurs annually, but is not seasonally linked: instances in some environments have been observed mating in the summer, while other instances have been observed mating in winter months. SCP-1788-2 instances will exclusively mate with one another; they have no apparent sexual attraction to normal humans. Gestation period for SCP-1788-2 instances is approximately forty (40) weeks, roughly the same as humans. Their offspring are genetically indistinguishable from normal humans and are not considered anomalous; however, as they are prime candidates for receiving the SCP-1788-1 implants, their capture or termination is to be considered high priority, second only to the termination of SCP-1788-2 instances.

**SCP-1788-1:** The number of implants in each set is unknown, nor is it known whether each set contains the same number and type of implants. The creator of these implants is also unknown, as is the processes of creation and implantation, although it is known that at least one stage of the implantation process requires large amounts of iodine. The implants are currently undetectable by any means available to the Foundation, and their presence can only be confirmed by autopsy.

Further information on SCP-1788-1 is restricted to level 4 personnel.

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-1788-2 Anatomy" hide="- SCP-1788-2 Anatomy"]]
**SCP-1788-2 Anatomy:** It is extremely difficult to distinguish an instance of SCP-1788-2 from a normal adult human, even on close inspection. Individuals show variation as expected from gender and ethnicity, but share certain characteristics in common. SCP-1788-2 individuals appear to be obese, within the range of one hundred and fifty (150) to two hundred (200) kilograms when fully grown.[[footnote]]Note that their //actual// weight is often closer to two hundred and fifty (250) kilograms, due to higher muscle and bone density.[[/footnote]] SCP-1788-2 instances have larger-than-average eyes, though not enough to appear abnormal on casual inspection. Their sweat contains high levels of potassium, copper, and [DATA EXPUNGED], though still within the normal range for an adult human.

Though externally normal, their internal anatomy has been extensively changed. SCP-1788-2 instances' long bones and cranium have been reinforced with several heavy metals, and their muscle fibers have been interwoven with structures resembling carbon nanotubes. This gives them extraordinary durability, strength, and speed, belying their unathletic appearances.

SCP-1788-2 instances possess backup organs and systems for most of their bodies' vital processes. For example, they have a secondary heart, lower in the torso, which can work in tandem with the primary heart to more efficiently circulate blood, or can function independently as necessary. Certain blood vessels have complex "valve" structures, allowing instances to close off blood flow to damaged limbs and other areas to prevent excessive blood loss. Other organ systems also have two or three redundant backups that can take over in the event of the failure of the primary organ(s).

SCP-1788-2 instances also possess a secondary brain, located in the upper torso and protected by its own skeletal structure, similar in construction to the ribcage. Currently the exact function of this brain is unknown; it is known that this brain can continue to function even in the event of the destruction of the primary brain, as demonstrated by Incident 1788-XR-12.[[footnote]]Logs of this incident have not been fully cleared. In summary, a team of agents were able to lure an SCP-1788-2 instance into the range of a sniper, who was able to destroy most of the instance's head, including the entirety of the "main brain," with several shots from a high-caliber rifle. However, the instance still displayed full mobility and partial lethality, disabling two agents, one fatally, at close range. It is unknown how the instance was still able to sense the agents with most of its primary sense organs destroyed; research is ongoing.[[/footnote]]

The final difference in gross anatomy is the appearance of a second pair of arms, located directly below the main pair. These have apparently equal strength and dexterity to the upper pair, and SCP-1788-2 instances are apparently capable of using all four arms simultaneously. When not actively hunting, instances hold the lower pair folded closely to their sides, where they are largely concealed by natural bulk. When hidden in this manner, it is virtually impossible to distinguish a clothed instance of SCP-1788-2 from a normal, obese human, except on close inspection.

> Most of the above is a lie.

> These people are not enhanciles, at least not in the way we described. They haven't been given any magical "implants." They don't have hypnotic voices. They don't eat children.
> 
> They //are// stronger, faster, and deadlier than us. They //are// more resistant to damage. And they don't eat children, but they do //abduct// them.
> 
> There's a term in developmental biology: //neoteny//. It's when members of a species retain the characteristics of their juvenile forms into adulthood. Sometimes it means that a species keeps features it doesn't need any more when it matures, like an amphibian that keeps its gills even after it starts walking on land, or a human who keeps the ability to digest lactose even when they're all grown up and they don't drink milk any more.
> 
> Sometimes it means more. Take the axolotl. It's a kind of lizard, closely related to the Tiger salamander. It starts out aquatic, with gills and fins, and in adulthood it's supposed to become air-breathing and develop limbs. Except that, due to the conditions in its native environment, most axolotls don't become adults: their bodies don't produce the proper hormones, so they remain aquatic organisms rather than become air-breathing adults. They look like their juvenile forms, only they're sexually mature; they don't fully develop because their environment doesn't give them the necessary stimulus. Put them in the proper environment, or dose them with the right hormones, and they become something else.

> 
> They're better hunters than we are. They have redundant organ systems and heal faster; they live longer and they live //better//. They have minds and personalities better suited to long periods of solitude; they don't need the large social systems that we do, to keep ourselves from going crazy. We're children compared to them.
> 
> Something in our environment—which is to say, //Earth//—is missing. We're not getting the crucial stimulus that would turn us all into SCP-1788-2. And somebody, somewhere, has figured out what that stimulus //is//, and is applying it to these people. And they, in turn, hunt down children to apply it to //them//. Because they're trying to make more of themselves.
> 
> These aren't cyborgs or monsters or devils we're fighting. They're //us//, as we're meant to be: apex predators, without society, without civilization. Our bodies //want// us to be brutal individuals who only come together to mate and fight. The entirety of human civilization is due to the fact that we are all, and will always be, children.
