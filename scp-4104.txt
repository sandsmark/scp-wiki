**Item #:** SCP-4104

**Object Class:** **{{##004d00|N/A##}}**

**Special Containment Procedures:** As of Interview-4104-3, all remaining data on SCP-4104 is to be ##00004d|purged from the central database.## An archive containing all previous iterations of SCP-4104's file is to be kept under the care of Senior Researcher Dr. Mǒqù Sen, which can be made available upon request.

Personnel assumed to be affected by SCP-4104 are to undergo psychiatric treatment before returning to their everyday activities. No civilian was ever discovered to be under the supposed effects of SCP-4104.

**Description:** SCP-4104 was the designation given to what has been determined to be a common psychosis, likely induced by work-related stress and paranoia following a published incident report.

Those assumed to be affected by SCP-4104 displayed delusions of knowing individuals, objects, and events which never existed. These delusions varied, and would often fade on their own in time. Delusions which progressed within the affected would grow to encompass up to months worth of false memories. All observed cases were noted to involve the Foundation and other GoIs.

SCP-4104 was given its designation after an incident report was filed by Dr. Calens and Senior Researcher Oscar Tophs. The report detailed a test regarding an unknown object and several individuals; the aforementioned report has been recorded below. No audio or visual recordings of the mentioned test have been found to exist. Furthermore, ##00004d|the object and individuals mentioned do not exist.##

At the time of the report, one theory arose regarding the nature of SCP-4104.

It was theorized that anti-memetics may have caused memory loss in exposed personnel. This idea was disproven by the lack of physical trauma found on Katie Lambert of site security following an interview conducted by Dr. Mǒqù Sen. Lambert reported severe physical trauma after an encounter with a hostile anomaly. During the interview when the incident was reported, she was found to lack any sort of blunt trauma or lacerations consistent with the reported incident.

##00004d|Therefore, SCP-4104 was not the work of an anti-memetic.##

**Interview-4104-3 Video Log**

**Date:** 03/14/2017

**Interviewed:** Katie Lambert

**Interviewer:** Dr. Mǒqù Sen

-----

[BEGIN LOG]

**Sen:** "State your name and department for the record, please."

**Lambert:** "Katie Lambert... 'm just a security guard, Sir."

**Sen:** "Thank you... You've been called in to discuss the report you sent in last week. Please forgive the delay, you know how-"

**Lambert:** "-crummy bureaucracy can be? You don't gotta apologize."

//(Sen nods momentarily before handing a simple manilla envelope to Lambert.)//

**Sen:** "It was courtesy. This is the report you sent in last Tuesday, is it not?"

//(Lambert inspects the envelope before she hesitantly hands it back to Sen.)//

**Lambert:** "Nah... This ain't it. The report I sent in was about that weird locket- the one that made imaginary friends come to life and eat you."

**Sen:** "I beg your pardon? This is the only report that I've received with your name attached to it." 

**Lambert:** "Then... then something fucky is going on... The report I wrote detailed what happened with that locket. Come on- Casey died to that thing!"

**Sen:** "Can you tell me his name and department? I don't remember seeing a Casey mentioned in any of the files I've been sent."

//(Lambert buries her head in her hands. She hisses through her teeth.)//

**Lambert:** "Casey Maddox. He was a researcher here. At this site. Site 19."

**Lambert:** "I don't know what your crummy report says- but Casey? Casey was detailing that stupid test when the D class tried to bolt. He grabbed him. That locket made contact. Some poor incarnation of Clifford the dog and a harpy ripped them both apart. //Your report is fucking bullshit.//"

**Sen:** "Lambert. I need you to take a deep breath. Breathe."

**Lambert:** "..."

**Sen:** "Just breathe, Lambert."

//(10 minutes of silence passes. Lambert then looks up at Sen, and holds herself.)//

**Lambert:** "I'm 'aight... I'm okay..."

**Sen:** "We can continue whenever you are fit. I cannot delay this interview any further, however. We must finish today."

**Lambert:** "Lemme guess- bureaucracy?"

**Sen:** "...yes."

**Lambert:** "Right... Right... Continue on, I guess."

**Sen:** "Thank you. I assume you were the security on-staff for this particular test?"

**Lambert:** "Mhm- it was me and Rhena."

**Sen:** "Rhena Fennhart?"

**Lambert:** "Yeah! Is she still- she's okay, isn't she? Did she disappear too?"

//(Sen waves dismissively.)//

**Sen:** "Yes. Fennhart was in the break room earlier today; although, she didn't recall this locket event that you've been describing."

**Lambert:** "You're making me think I'm crazy, Doc. You seriously are."

**Sen:** "That is not my intention. This is a... peculiar set of circumstances, as you may be aware. You're the only one on staff who recalls these events. To add to that, your recall clashes with the events of the report I've been given. The concern is that this may be a stress-induced psychosis, as is a reality with those in our profession."

**Lambert:** "Doc... come on. I'm a lot of things but crazy ain't anywhere on that bill."

**Sen:** "Let's set that aside for the moment, Lambert. Can you give me a simple summary of the test? A short series of events?"

//(Lambert stays silent for an extended period. She does not look at Dr. Sen. She does not respond for an extended time.)//

**Sen:** "Lambert. I need you to cooperate with me."

**Lambert:** "..."

**Sen:** "Miss Lambert?"

**Lambert:** "'m just trying to recall everything. 's kind of fuzzy."

**Sen:** "Please attempt to reconstruct the events to the best of your ability. Your testimony is all we have regarding the incident."

**Lambert:** "Mm... 'm sorry Doc. Gimme a moment."

**Sen:** "Take as much time as you need. If you would prefer to write it down, I can request a pencil and pad for you."

**Lambert:** "Can I have something to write with? I think- I think that could help. Please?"

**Sen:** "As you wish. Give me a moment."

//(Sen stands, and steps out of the room.)//

//(Lambert remains in her seat.)//

**Lambert:** "...'m I going insane?"

//(Sen returns with the requested pad and pen.)//

**Sen:** "Forgive the delay. Here."

**Lambert:** "Thanks. Could I ask you a thing, Doc?"

**Lambert:** "I... I'm wondering something."

**Sen:** "Of course. What's on your mind, Lambert?"

**Lambert:** "...my leg."

**Sen:** "What about your leg, Lambert? Should I call in a nurse?"

**Lambert:** "No- no! My leg is fine. That's the problem."

**Sen:** "..."

**Sen:** "I beg your pardon?"

**Lambert:** "You know that ungodly creature I mentioned? The harpy Clifford wannabe that made dinner out of my colleague? ...I could have worded that better."

**Sen:** "Your wording aside, yes. I recall."

//(Lambert reaches down and reveals her heavily bandaged yet clean leg.)//

**Lambert:** "It ripped into me. I took it on when it showed up 'cause that's my job, and it ate into my leg. There's no pain or blood anymore, though. Look at it!"

//(Sen moves to Lambert and peels the dressing from her leg. The limb is absent of any trauma.)//

**Sen:** "...may I ask who dressed your wound?"

**Lambert:** "I did. The wound wasn't bad enough for a Doc. Just a shallow few cuts."

**Sen:** "...I'm convinced this could be a psychosis, Miss Lambert. Anti-memetics do not heal resulting trauma. This is not an anti-memetic."

**Lambert:** "...so I am crazy?"

**Sen:** "I suppose we all are, Miss Lambert. I'm going to refer you to psychiatric immediately.

**Interview-4104-5 Video Log**

**Date:** 12/27/2017

**Interviewed:** Issac Talbots

**Interviewer:** Dr. Mǒqù Sen
-----

**Sen:** "State your name and department for the record, please."

**Talbot:** "Issac Talbots, Junior researcher under Dr. Tristan."

**Sen:** "I have never heard of a Dr. Tristan at this site."

**Talbots:** "Yeah, well, he vanished this morning. I'm not surprised."

**Sen:** "...can you tell me when you supposedly met this Dr. Tristan?"

//(Talbots stands from his seat. He stretches.)//

**Talbots:** "I've known him since I was hired. That's six months, my entire career at this bloody site."

**Sen:** "That is a very long time, Talbots. I cannot recall a Dr. Tristan having ever been at this site."

**Talbots:** "You know- I'm pretty sure he was here. I think if I were walking around like a delusional fuckstick for six months that I'd be... You know..."

//(Talbots drags a finger across his throat, followed by a choking sound.)//

**Talbots:** "You get the gist."

**Sen:** "Yes, I do. ...thank you for the demonstration." 

**Talbots:** "Oi. The sarcasm is my shtick Sen."

**Sen:** "...was I being sarcastic?"

//(Talbots gives a rapid nod.)//

**Sen:** "My apologies. It was not my intent."

**Talbots:** "Yeah, it's fine. I don't really care that much. Either way, I know Dr. Tristan was here. I'm not psychotic."

**Sen:** "I was not saying you were."

**Talbots:** "If you're telling me that Dr. Tristan never existed and that I can't decern reality from delusion then you are calling me psycho."

**Sen:** "...okay. Then I am calling you psychotic. It has been discerned that SCP-4104 is nothing more than a stress-induced psychosis, I fail to see how you differ. It is the most logical answer."

**Talbots:** "As determined by..?"

**Sen:** "Myself."

**Talbots:** "Yourself."

**Sen:** "Yes."

**Talbots:** "...you don't think that something could be wiping shit from our world? You don't think people could be remembering?"

**Sen:** "I have already explained that it is likely this is a simple psychosis."

//(Talbots begins to pace around the room.)//

**Talbots:** "It's completely possible, yeah, but so is my guess. I mean, look at this shit world we live in! You know, the same world filled with things like [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3864 a predatory painting that pretty much eats people?] [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4249 A couch that leads to another world?]"

**Sen:** "You're suggesting that SCP-4104 is actually... a collection of self-contained EK-Class erasure scenarios?"

**Talbots:** "Fuck- I don't know! I'm just throwing out ideas here. Again, I ain't batshit. I wouldn't have been hired if I was batshit.

**Sen:** "I believe that is a quite a logical leap, Talbots."

//(Sen rise from his seat, and walks over to the observation window.)//

**Sen:** "Do you have anything to perhaps... back your theory up?"

**Talbots:** "I mean, kinda. I need you to answer two quick questions though."

**Sen:** "That is reasonable, but be aware you are only a junior researcher. I will not disclose information above your clearance."

**Talbots:** "Don't worry- this is all stuff that would be in SCP-4104's file. I just need a quick lil memory refresh. Kk?"

//(Sen briefly nods.)//

**Talbots:** "Okay, so, memories of the 'delusions-' and I use air-quotes here- fade completely after a certain amount of time... Yeah?"

//(Sen nods.)//

**Talbots:** "Right. Have you given antipsychotics to anyone with these delusions? You know, to see if it does anything? Something that would prove these were all just symptoms of stress-induced psychosis?"

**Sen:** "No. They have completely faded from memory in 100% of cases, as they will likely do in yours."

//(Talbot walks over to Sen, shaking his head.)//

**Talbots:** "You're telling me you never bothered to treat something you call psychosis with antipsychotics like any sane human would?"

**Sen:** "There was never a need."

**Talbots:** "How the Hell did you know that there was no need? You say common psychosis and then say everyone just forgets? I'm sorry but do you know how psychosis works dude?"

**Sen:** "There was simply never a need. The memories faded too rapidly for it to be an issue."

**Talbots:** "That ain't how it works Sen. You don't just forget everything about a delusion and poof- everything is okay! That isn't how it works!"

**Sen:** "Please settle down."

**Talbots:** "Am I the first actual scientist you've had in here?"

**Sen:** "Please settle down."

//(Talbots stands in front of Sen.)//

**Talbots:** "Well, am I? Am I, Sen?"

**Sen:** "Please settle down."

**Talbots:** "Come on, that ain't an answer. I ain't screaming at you. I'm not threatening you. I'm asking a question- am I the first actual scientist you've had in here?"

**Sen:** "Please settle down."

**Talbots:** "...ain't gonna say anything else, are you?"

[[/span]]

**Sen:** ##00004d|"Please settle down, Issac."##

[[span style="color:#004d00;"]]

**Talbots:** "...yeah, weird tone, I think I'm just gonna..."

//(Talbots moves to the door. The handle does not move.)//

**Talbots:** "...fuck. You make me take my piece off before I came in here. Should've asked about that, really."

[[/span]]

**Sen:** ##00004d|"I have never had a problem with anyone, but it does pay to be cautious."##

[[span style="color:#004d00;"]]

**Talbots:** "Can you talk normally, please? Come on, if you're gonna do something bad here at least quit sounding like a bad haunted house echo."

**Sen:** "...it isn't doing anything, it seems. Then there is no point."

**Talbots:** "Yeah, okay, what the actual fuck?"

**Sen:** "Hm?"

**Talbots:** "First you tell me I'm crazy. Then you describe something that is nothing close to common psychosis. Finally, you start sounding fucking off. Come on, I'm not dumb. Don't patronize me."

**Sen:** "This might be a problem."

**Talbots:** "No- really? I'd never have guessed. What are you- a thaumaturgist?"

**Sen:** "Not quite."

**Talbots:** "...oh please don't tell me you're a reality bender."

**Sen:** "Not quite."

**Talbots:** "Oh- thank God... I'm... I'm going to die, aren't I?"

**Sen:** "...I apologize."

//(Talbots walks back to the table. He takes his place at his chair.)//

**Sen:** "There are some things in this world that you simply are not meant to tamper with. I am sorry."

//(Talbot curls up in his chair.)//

**Talbots:** "...is it gonna hurt?"

**Sen:** "No."

**Sen:** "Do you know what Mǒqù means, Dr. Talbots?"
