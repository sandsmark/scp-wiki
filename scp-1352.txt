**Item #:** SCP-1352

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1352's enclosure is located in an isolated valley of the Amargosa Range. The entity is permitted to wander around the premises of the enclosure. The enclosure is 25 hectares, and the perimeter fencing must be rooted 10m into the ground to prevent dislodging. Debris must be made available within the enclosure for the entity to interact with. All personnel are allowed to interact with SCP-1352, but only during breaks or otherwise not performing any tasks. Proper protective equipment must be worn by personnel within the enclosure at all times.

**Description:** SCP-1352 is a sentient dust devil[[footnote]]The entity displays characteristics of major whirlwinds, but it has been classified as a dust devil due to its lack of a cloud base and the intense electrical activity it generates.[[/footnote]] with a behavior similar to that of domesticated pet-animals. Anemometer readings indicate wind speeds of at least 60 km/h, but they shift with the "mood" of the entity.

SCP-1352 displays 'playful' characteristics, often carrying small debris to play with. After interacting with people, the funnel will shrink to three meters in height and the entity will attempt surround the person/s as a sign of happiness. If excited, wind speeds and funnel size rapidly shift between the 60 and 100 km/h parameters. In an angered state, the funnel grows to proportions similar to those of F5 tornadoes. The entity will then attack with debris thrown at speeds excess of 300 km/h. SCP-1352 has a preference for interacting with human beings, and will attempt to coerce people into doing so through a variety of methods. The entity has been shown to be protective of the people it interacts with.

SCP-1352 has displayed signs of intelligent behavior. It has the ability to manipulate the wind it generates to pick up and place items weighing up to 500 kg with precision. Unusually, the funnel doesn't increase or decrease in size when this occurs. The entity has also been shown to respond to verbal commands. The researchers have discovered that it understands words such as "stay", "go", "come here", and "fetch", allowing easier containment methods. Training of SCP-1352 has continued, and currently the entity can perform more complex tasks such as arranging objects into specific patterns such as shapes, and solving simple problems i.e., matching objects.

**Addendum:** Debriefing with Agent ████ after capture of SCP-1352
> **Interviewed:** Agent ████
>  
> **Interviewer:** Dr. ████
>  
> **<Begin Log>**
>  
> **Dr. ████:** Please recall how you captured SCP-1352
>  
> **Agent ████:** Gladly, but I wouldn't exactly say "capture". Anyhoo, after they called us in we tracked the sucker to the coast. There, we found him wandering around picking up some trash on the beaches. I'm not sure why, guess he was bored.
>  
> **Dr. ████:** How did you approach it?
> 
>  **Agent ████:** Well at first we surrounded him. This only pissed him off, and he started getting bigger and bigger. The wind was really picking up, so we got some distance from him. We weren't able to call for backup, the thing was causing some radio interference. He just stayed at that spot, trying to pull us in. Agent ██████ wasn't fast enough. He got sucked up and was thrown several feet away.
> 
> **Dr. ████:** How hurt was he?
> 
> **Agent ████:** His back was broken. I couldn't go to him immediately 'cause the twister was right over my head. I thought I was gonna die, then the wind died down, and I saw the twister was getting smaller. Next thing I know it tossed this piece of wood next to me.
> 
> **Dr. ████:** Okay then. In what manner did you react to that situation?
> 
> **Agent ████:** (Drinks from a glass of water) At first I was just lying on the sand wondering why this thing didn't kill me. The twister was moving side to side, waiting for something. I put my hand on the wood, and it started moving faster and faster. I picked it up and he grew taller. He was getting really excited on the chunk of wood. Thinking I could distract it, I threw it into the water. He wasted no time fetching it. Anyways we went to our teammate and called for medical support. We stopped when the twister tossed the same hunk of wood at me and was just sitting several feet away. Lead Agent ██████ said to me, "I think this twister wants to play fetch with you." At first I disagreed because he wounded someone, but Agent ██████ convinced me and the rest of our team and said, "He's not attacking us right now, and besides, I'd rather have him calm now than angry." All the while it was just sitting there waiting for me to throw the wood again.
> 
> **Dr. ████:** So how did you contain it?
> 
> **Agent ████:** We just played with him like a dog until the Recovery teams showed up, which I think was thirty minutes later. Besides, bullets can't do shit on him so why bother. That was the best recovery I ever did, even if one of my teammates got hurt. We still visit him now and then, and he even said sorry to Agent ██████.

**Addendum:** Communication Attempt
On the morning of /█/██/██, field researchers discovered a large debris formation created by SCP-1352. The pattern was too large to be seen from ground level, requiring the use of an unmanned aerial vehicle. At 300 meters, the pattern was revealed to be the word "HELO". Subsequently, the Director has authorized further communication experiments with SCP-1352.
