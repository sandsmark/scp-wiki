@@       @@To the Mission Board of the Manna Charitable Foundation.

@@       @@On behalf of the Global Occult Coalition and the builders of the Mk. I-P-UHEC platform, the PTOLEMY Division and the Servants of the Silicon Nornir, we extend this donation as hopeful testimony of the greater works humanity can achieve when we work together. 

@@       @@Although the Prototype Mk I Ultra-Heavy Engagement Chassis was built as proof of concept and has little to do with its kin, the much heavier and sophisticated Mk. III UEHC 'Orange Suit', it is completely functional and can be used for a number of peaceful tasks in a most environments. It is a very large robotic vehicle capable of traversing any terrain and perform different operations thanks to its manipulators. 

@@       @@It has been, of course, deprived of all Tangential technology and reinforced with advanced Gen+0 devices. This was originally done as part of a testing program designed to advance current use of robotics by our non-occult partners. However, we have reached a point where, with the exception of its sophisticated actuators, it is completely obsolete. This is why we believe it can be of greater use to your organisation than to us.

@@       @@You will find that the UHEC is a very practical, if maintenance-intensive, multi-purpose platform. However, when accepting this donation, the MCF will be observing these conditions:
@@          @@**1.** The Mk. I-P-UHEC will not be used in combat against any foe, under any circumstances.
@@          @@**2.** As required by Second Mission (concealment), the Mk. I-P-UHEC will not be used close to civilian populations nor its capacities disclosed to any parties, in any way.
@@          @@**3.** No attempts to retro-engineer the Mk. I-P-UHEC Gen+0 trademarked technology (see attached documentation) will be undertaken. This includes any attempts at reproducing the device by using anomalous means.
@@          @@**4.** The Mk. I-P-UHEC will be used by active or former members of the Global Occult Coalition alone who have been registered in the Humanitarian Work Roster or academic personnel on a sabbatical that have joined an MCF operation. These persons may not train others in the use of the Mk. I-P-UHEC.

@@       @@Any failure in following these directives will result in the forcible requisition and dismantling of the device.

@@       @@We cede this article to you in good faith, as requested by ex-members of the Coalition now affiliated to your organisation, hoping that you make good use of its qualities. 

@@            @@Sincerely,
@@               @@Assistant Director of Field Operations, Central Africa Division, "Pericles".

Most of those systems implemented by the Servants were Gen+2 and further. This means they are trying to sway public opinion in their favor by giving us their prototype equipment, fitted with materials of a deplorable quality an-- Long re-charging periods will also be a problem.

> (...) To conclude: they gave us an obsolete piece of tech, denied us a chance to use it for many significant tasks by forbidding its use in front of civilians and refused to let me train volunteers to use it or copy it. This is, in my experience, what the Coalition officials do to be obstructive without being too open about it: make up as many rules as you can in the spot. It is true, however, that we have to keep it hidden or people will wonder where did a poor non-profit NGO get a ninety-four-million euro piece of top-of-the-line robotic hardware. Neither us nor the GOC need any additional scrutiny from Normal society or other interested parties.

Second, to fully exploit its all-terrain capacities we should use it in places where normal logistics and transport assets, such as trucks or trailers, __can't get to__ or have difficulties navigating. Third, to fully exploit its loading capacities, the Work Group it gets assigned to should use moderately large container-like units; I've heard of UN-issued MSU[[footnote]]MSU - //Mobile Storage Unit; type of standardized container fit for semitrailer-transport.// - //For more information on asset availability, see Mission Watch Bulletin, entry 998/12/01-3-Logistics; for a comprehensive relation of all related assets available to MCF field personnel, call the pertinent Continental Branch Offices.//[[/footnote]] that would be perfect for this.

Of course, that does not mean it is all it can do (it is, after all, an all-terrain, multi-purpose platform), but I am thinking primarily of those things we will be able to do with it, and //only// with it.
