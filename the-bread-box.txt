//When hinges creak in doorless chambers, and strange and frightening sounds echo through the halls. Whenever candlelights flicker where the air is deathly still - that is the time when ghosts are present, practicing their terror with ghoulish delight.//

//Welcome, foolish mortals, to the Haunted Kitchen. I am your host, your toast host. Kindly step all the way in please, and make room for everyone. There’s no turning back now.//
 

//Our tour begins here in this gallery, where you see descriptions of some of our skips as they appeared in their corruptible, mortal state.//

//Your cadaverous pallor reveals an aura of foreboding, almost as if you sense a disquieting metamorphosis. Is this haunted room actually stretching? Or is it your imagination - hmm? And consider this dismaying observation: this Author Page has no windows and no doors... which offers you this chilling challenge: to find a way out!//

//Of course, there’s always **my way.**//

[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3286|SCP-3286]]] - “Sea Legs”

 My first surviving SCP. Of course, it looks nothing like the original now. Originally posted in May, 2018, this was my second shot at creating an SCP. The first attempt was about an exploding medieval snail. A small statue found off the coast of a Japanese island, touching it woukd cause people to turn into some sort of fish/human hybrid that would relay a warning message from a dying civilization. It sounds interesting when I write it like that, but it was horrible. It sat in its position, never raising higher than +5. Trapped in purgatory. After coming out of a temporary slump, I decided to rewrite this article. 

The original article had something I wanted to use, to base my rewrite off of. The statue itself was of a fish with legs. Simple, weird, and a little disturbing if you thought about it for too long? Perfect. I wrote this in about 3 days, deciding to post it before getting it critiqued because I was impatient (//Side-note: This is the only article I’ve ever posted without getting it critiqued first. This being good without it was a fluke//). I was ready to endure the critique that would come flooding into the comments, but it never came. A few minor autocorrects here and there, but otherwise good comments. I can now look at my first SCP with pride, knowing that it’s something I’ve written well. As for the original, it will hopefully never see the light of day again.

[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3462|SCP-3462]]] - “The Subconscious Little Toaster”

Alright, I may need to give some backstory on this one and why it’s not the best.

I own a copy of The Brave Little Toaster on VHS. It was originally owned by my mother, who bought it when she was 23 because it looked weird. I’m so happy she did, because I can’t even count how many times I watched this movie as a wee lad. It was this and Mary Poppins, the two movies I always watched as a child. I played Mary Poppins so much I rendered the VHS tape unwatchable. The Brave Little Toaster however, survived my repeated watches.

Nobody knows what the Brave Little Toaster is. Every discussion about it has ended in confused looks. This thing was my childhood. I knew that I needed to spread knowledge of the The Best Movie of All Time™, but how to do it? Through my favorite medium of course, SCPs!

Now, I can recognize that this skip has its flaws. I recognize that you might even  think of it as some horrible slag. However, I will never completely rewrite this SCP. I may, in the future, write it in a better tone or more interesting style. I will also defend this skips existence to my grave. This article has a special place in my heart and I love it to bits.

[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4088|SCP-4088]]] - “Sing is a song, you’re a piano, man.”

My highest rated article at the time of writing. The SCP that made be start to think I wasn’t so shit at writing as I previously thought. Get ready for some more Bread lore!

The SCP itself had been written since July, but I had delayed posting it because I knew I had something good that I wanted to do justice. I had thought of the idea in the shower, thinking about the song Piano Man. I had recently gotten it stuck in my head and knew every verse, so making an SCP about it seemed like a good idea. Pianos are almost always the haunted instruments in movies, and I realized that they had a bunch of movie tropes ripe for the picking. A piano sitting alone in a room playing by itself? Prime material. Throw in hanging from a rope on the ceiling and occasionally eating people and I had something solid. 

I’ve been going to a camp over the summer since I was 10. It’s also the same place I’ll be working over the summer. It’s located on a island in the middle of a lake, so that means no internet. I’m fine with this. Going there is always one of, if not the highlight of my year. It’s where I sat in a trashcan for 20 minutes do I could pop out and yell “I’m the trashman!” as an intro for an event. It’s where I was the captain of the Olympic team WrestleMania. It’s  great time in general. I was gone during the 4000 contest and didn’t even know it was happening. By the time I got back, Series 5 had been open for about 3 days. 

Once I had gotten home from my monthlong absence, Series 5 was open and I knew it was the perfect timing. I posted it, and it’s currently on its way to +100. I couldn’t be prouder of my piano baby.

[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-444-j|SCP-444-J]]] - “Tootin’ Dootin’ Shootin’”

So this one is... interesting.

This entire article is based off of a bad pun. I thought of the phrase Tootin’ Dootin’ Shootin’ while at work and thought it was too good to pass up. I spent more time then I probably want to admit thinking about what woodwind instruments I should make shoot things. The original plan for the article was for this to be a serious scip on the main page, which explains the tone of the article. I was advised during critiquing that this might be better as a -J, so I took the bone baton and ran with it. The article had 2 cut instruments. A flute that was the equivalent of a blow dart gun, and what I can only describe as an SMG bagpipe. I had actually gotten the ammo wrong for the bagpipes originally, saying that they shot fire grenades instead of bullets. I decided to stick with that and threw in some skeletons and exploding kazoos to boot.

[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4035|SCP-4035]]] - “Prey on Words”

As most of you can tell by now, I’m a fan of wordplay. So a genie that twists your words into a bad deal seemed like the perfect fit for me. One of the only reasons I thought of this idea was the image of a genie coming out if a bedside lamp. I just proposed it in IRC chat one day and decided to roll with it. A genie used car salesman, but with superpowers. Probably the best part of the article is the title, which I also thought up in the shower.

[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4664|SCP-4664]]] - “Nightmare of 20,000 Feet”

Ah, my labor of love. This SCP, like others, was created so I could somehow work in a name I liked. I had wanted to write an skip on Nightmare at 20,000 Feet for a while and didn’t want to go the obvious route. My idea at the time involved an area of airspace and centipedes. Then I entered IRC chat for a brainstorming session. This is what exited that storm. A giant squid with puppet hands that appears after a bad dream and puts on a little show for you. It is by far the weirdest concept I’ve ever worked with and a bit of a daunting task for myself. See, before this SCP, I had only ever tried dialogue once. It was awful, absolutely dreadful, I never wanted to step anywhere near dialogue again. I couldn’t let the chat down though. 

I posted the article for critiques and it was thoroughly picked through for the bad sections. I actually rewrote the entire description of the article to make the concept easier to understand. After about 2 weeks of revising, I posted the article and left it. I just stared at my screen waiting. 

People liked it, I guess. It’s now my second highest rated article and official,y the weirdest concept I’ve written about. It easily tops even the fish with legs. I’m glad the utter chaos that was the brainstorming session wasn’t in vein, and that I could do the concept justice.
