[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3286|SCP-3286]]] - “Sea Legs”

 My first surviving SCP. Of course, it looks nothing like the original now. Originally posted in May of 2018, this was my second shot at creating an SCP. The first attempt was about an exploding medieval snail. A small statue found off the coast of a Japanese island, where touching it would cause people to turn into some sort of fish/human hybrid that would relay a warning message from a dying civilization. It sounds interesting when I write it like that, but it was horrible. It sat in its position, never raising higher than +5. Trapped in purgatory. After coming out of a temporary slump, I decided to rewrite this article. 

The original article had something I wanted to use, to base my rewrite off of. The statue itself was of a fish with legs. Simple, weird, and a little disturbing if you thought about it for too long? Perfect. I wrote this in about 3 days, deciding to post it before getting it critiqued because I was impatient (//Side-note: This is the only article I’ve ever posted without getting it critiqued first. This being good without it was a fluke//). I was ready to endure the critique that would come flooding into the comments, but it never came. A few minor autocorrects here and there, but otherwise good comments. I can now look at my first SCP with pride, knowing that it’s something I’ve written well. As for the original, may it hopefully never see the light of day again.

[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3462|SCP-3462]]] - “Lights, Camera, REDACTION”

My second rewrite of my older SCPs, this time with much more deviation from the source material. The only consistent item from the two articles is the presence of a VHS tape of the Brave Little Toaster. I had been wanting to rewrite this article for a while and had been sitting on a very vague idea of what I wanted to turn it into. I knew I wanted to make it into a monster made of VHS tapes and I wanted to try my hand at writing a Keter class SCP. 

This was probably the SCP I’ve spent the longest time drafting in total. The description and containment procedures stayed pretty similar through each draft with minor changes, but the ending used to be much different. At first, it had been an admittedly poorly written email taking about how SCP-3462 might also effect abstract concepts in addition to physical information. I then tried my hand at an exploration/recovery log, but I couldn’t quite get the “Descent Into Madness” idea across like I had hoped. Finally, I just thought, why not VHS tapes? It’s the only thing I’ve described as being immune to the effects, and a found footage idea might not be too bad. A few critiques later and I released have the article you see now. This is high up on my list of SCPs I’m proud of and I’m happy I was able to turn my old article into something worth reading.

[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4088|SCP-4088]]] - “Sing is a song, you’re a piano, man.”

My highest rated article at the time of writing. The SCP that made me start to think I wasn’t so shit at writing as I previously thought. Get ready for some more Bread lore!

The SCP itself had been written since July, but I had delayed posting it because I knew I had something good that I wanted to do justice. I had thought of the idea in the shower, thinking about the song Piano Man. I had recently gotten it stuck in my head and knew every verse, so making an SCP about it seemed like a good idea. Pianos are almost always the haunted instruments in movies, and I realized that they had a bunch of movie tropes ripe for the picking. A piano sitting alone in a room playing by itself? Prime material. Throw in hanging from a rope on the ceiling and occasionally eating people and I had something solid. 

I’ve been going to a camp over the summer since I was 10. It’s also the same place I’m working at to this day during the summer. It’s located on an island in the middle of a lake, so that means no internet connection. I’m fine with this. Going there is always one of, if not the biggest highlight of my year. It’s where I sat in a trashcan for 20 minutes so I could pop out and yell “I’m the trashman!” as an intro for an event. It’s where I was the captain of the Olympic team WrestleMania. It ’s a great time in general. Due to this, I was gone during the 4000 contest and didn’t even know it was happening. By the time I got back, Series 5 had been open for about 3 days. 

Once I had gotten home from my monthlong absence, Series 5 was open and I knew it was the perfect timing. I posted it, and it’s currently a bit past +100. I couldn’t be prouder of my piano baby.

[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-444-j|SCP-444-J]]] - “Tootin’ Dootin’ Shootin’”

So this one is... interesting.

This entire article is based on a bad pun. I thought of the phrase Tootin’ Dootin’ Shootin’ while at work and thought it was too good to pass up. I spent more time then I probably want to admit thinking about what woodwind instruments I should make shoot things. The original plan for the article was for this to be a serious SCP on the main page, which explains the tone of the article. I was advised during critiquing that this might be better as a -J, so I took the bone baton and ran with it. The article had 2 cut instruments. A flute that was the equivalent of a blow dart gun, and what I can only describe as an SMG bagpipe. I had actually gotten the ammo wrong for the bagpipes originally, saying that they shot fire grenades instead of bullets. I decided to stick with that and threw in some skeletons and exploding kazoos to boot.

[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4035|SCP-4035]]] - “Prey on Words”

As most of you can tell by now, I’m a fan of wordplay. So a genie that twists your words into a bad deal seemed like the perfect fit for me. One of the only reasons I thought of this idea was the image of a genie coming out if a bedside lamp. I just proposed it in IRC chat one day and decided to roll with it. A genie used car salesman, but with superpowers. Probably the best part of the article is the title, which I also thought up in the shower.

[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4664|SCP-4664]]] - “Nightmare of 20,000 Feet”

Ah, my labor of love. This SCP, like others, was created so I could somehow work in a name I liked. I had wanted to write a skip on Nightmare at 20,000 Feet for a while but didn’t want to go the obvious route. My idea at the time involved an area of airspace and centipedes. Then I entered IRC chat for a brainstorming session. This is what exited that storm. A giant squid with puppet hands that appears after a bad dream and puts on a little show for you. It is by far the weirdest concept I’ve ever worked with and a bit of a daunting task for myself. See, before this SCP, I had only ever tried dialogue once. It was awful, absolutely dreadful, I never wanted to step anywhere near dialogue again. I couldn’t let the chat down though. 

I posted the article for critiques and it was thoroughly picked through for the bad sections. I actually rewrote the entire description of the article to make the concept easier to understand. After about 2 weeks of revising, I posted the article and left it. I just stared at my screen waiting. 

People liked it, I guess. It’s now my second highest rated article and officially the weirdest concept I’ve written about. It easily tops even the fish with legs. I’m glad the utter chaos that was the brainstorming session wasn’t in vain, and that I could do the concept justice.

[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1401-ex|SCP-1401-EX]]] - Have You Been **Scrombled?**

This one was a first for me in a few ways. It’s both my first EX and my first try at involving an established GoI. With the absolutely dumb concept, I knew it had to be GAW that I used. 

The main focus of this article was going to be the chat logs, which was a given. A GAW without chat logs really needs to have something else to carry it. At first, I was worried about how my conversations would be perceived, but comments from people seem to agree that the logs felt solid. 

As for the actual SCP, it went through a few different edits but stayed fairly similar to the original concept. After some feedback, I made sure that the sections defining what makes it an EX stood out. Overall, I enjoy this one and think it makes a good addition to GAW.

[[[SCP-4570]]] - “Almost Heaven, West Virginia”

This turned out pretty good from the original idea. I originally wanted the SCP to be about a jukebox that could change everything around it based on the song it was playing. The issue was that it has been stuck on Country Roads for as long as the Foundation has contained it. 

After some writing, that idea started to fall apart, so I decided to go with a more interpretive and meaningful ending. You can still come to the conclusion of the original article, and there are plenty of other references to that ending still in there, but even that ending has a bit more meaning to it now.

[[[SCP-4286]]] - “No Bones About It”

I ran this idea by so many people before I even started writing it. Relatives, friends, coworkers, everyone heard about the skeleton. The draft itself went through three iterations, with the final one being a sort of Frankenstein of the first two. 

I really wanted to get it out before the anniversary of my Wikidot account passed by, and I’m so grateful for my critters looking at this in such a timely manner. I’m also really happy with the SCP itself, and is great comparing it to my first SCP and seeing how far I’ve progressed.

I can lift a fully-grown horse above my head, and I can hold my breath for ten minutes. To settle a wager, I once ate a pound of P.B. Fouke's strongest badger poison and then ran a mile in the nude. I cannot feel pain, and I can see for two miles unaided by lense. I have beaten a man of every race in formal combat. A medical doctor and two priests have written and signed a document confirming that I have no soul.

Alright, I'll be semi-serious for a few minutes now. Time for a bit about me and why I do this. I create articles whenever the ambition to strikes me. That’s been happening a lot lately and I really enjoy it if I’m being transparent. Most of my SCPs are just made off of a single phrase or a dumb joke, but I’m always up to the challenge of making that idea into an interesting story. I’m always up to collaborations with others as having a solid starting point is often how I work my best. I’ve always wanted to make some SCPs with an overarching narrative and I’ve got some ideas in the works with that. If you ever have a piece that you want to be critiqued, just send a message my way.

Now back to the dumb jokes and the theme park ride introduction I memorized.

In 200█, Randall Bannock was then transferred to the Site-73 Containment & Security Department to assist in developing the containment procedures of several anomalous objects, where he was later assigned as a Junior Researcher. After assisting with the SCP-████ project, Randall Bannock was then tasked with aiding in the containment of [[[SCP-3462]]] due to its unusual properties, which resulted in his promotion to General Researcher in 201█. 

Since this, Randall Bannock is often seen assisting in the containment and testing of various anomalies within Site-34.

**Profile:** Randall Bannock is generally known for his upbeat attitude and fondness for testing. As such, he can often be found in the experiment logs of various SCPs. His gravitation towards testing has resulted in his assignment to particularly unusual anomalies. He is often recognizable for his varying levels of humor, low body heat, and knowledge of miscellaneous information.
