Welcome, %%title%%!
[[/module]]
This essay is a chronicle of the SCP wiki, dating back from the beginning to the current day. I've created it so we can easily remember where we've been, and our history. People deserve an easy and interesting way to learn about where we came from, and where we're going.

If you see any errors in spelling, grammar, or syntax, feel free to fix them. If you believe you see a historically inaccurate fact, please send me a private message explaining it to me, and I will fix it or explain it as soon as I can.

I hope you find the information presented here educational and enlightening, and that you come away knowing something you hadn't known before.
