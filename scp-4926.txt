**Item #:** SCP-4926


**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-4926 is to be housed at the SCP Foundation Warehouse 3-B.  The unit is to remain disassembled as its anomalous columns have ceased.  All instances of SCP-4926-1 are to be kept at the Library of Anomalous Events in storage drawer 3677A.  

**Description:**  SCP-4926 refers to a Mitsubishi Offset Printing Press Model DAIYA 5F.  The press measures .91 meters wide and 2.1 meters tall.  SCP-4926-1 refers to 417 separate newspapers containing the appearance of anomalous news columns.  The columns are written by an unknown author, and  describe a living person's death.  The events vary in location and cause, but in every instance, the person in question has been found to be living.  Initially thought to be a clerical error by the publication, numerous retractions and corrections were printed following confirmation that the person was still alive.  Interviews with the subjects of each article revealed that the events described bear a direct correlation to an event in the subject’s recent experience.  

The first instance of SCP-4926-1 appeared in the Omaha World Herald on July 20th, 1997.  A man by the name of Harold Archibald had called the publication, complaining of being contacted by numerous family members and colleagues inquiring on his well being.  Upon discovering the column, the man brought the instance of SCP-4926-1 to the publication, demanding to know if there was an error or crass attempt at humor.

> Bellevue, NE
> 
> A native of Bellevue, NE. has died at the University of Nebraska Medical Center after sustaining major injuries in an apparent train accident.  Harold Archibald, 22, was hit by an oncoming train at 6:31 pm Tuesday night.  Archibald was found by a passing motorist at the intersection of Fort Crook Rd. and Chandler.  Police suspect that Archibald, while riding his bicycle, had crossed the barriers in an attempt to beat the oncoming train and had slipped onto the tracks.  The medical student suffered life-threatening injuries and was airlifted to UNMC where he later succumbed to his wounds.  He is survived by his mother and sister.  Memorial services will be held Saturday at the Platte Community Church.

> 
> **Mr. Archibald:**  Am I being detained?  What is this?  Someone makes up a fake article about me dying and I’m the one that gets questioned.  Does that make any sense to you?
> 
> **Sergeant Arness:**  It’s just standard procedure.  We’re interviewing all parties involved in this incident.  We take this very seriously.  
> 
> **Mr. Archibald:**  I’ve got a paper due tomorrow and I’m running behind.   What do you want to know?
> 
> **Sergeant Arness:**  Can you tell me where you were on Tuesday around the time of the supposed accident?
> 
> **Mr. Archibald:**  I was coming home from the gym.  I always ride my bike for cardio.
> 
> **Sergeant Arness:**  And you crossed the railroad tracks at Fort Crook and Chandler?
> 
> **Mr. Archibald:**  I always do, but I’ve never been hit by a train there.
> 
> **Sergeant Arness:**  And is it common for you to cross in front of an oncoming train?
> 
> **Mr. Archibald:**  Not normally, but I don’t know, I just did it on a whim.  Just a bit of a thrill I guess.  But I didn’t get hit or anything.  It was far enough away that I wasn’t in any real danger.  Those things take so fucking long sometimes, I just didn’t feel like waiting.  It’s not something I’d done before.  Shit, am I going to get in trouble for admitting that?
> 
> **Sergeant  Arness:**  And who did you tell about this?  You have any friends that work for the paper or anything like that?  Anyone that might be trying to play a prank on you?
> 
> **Mr. Archibald:**  Not at all.  Unless someone witnessed it, no one would have known about it.

Subsequent interviews with writers and editors revealed no known connections with Harold Archibald.  No employees reported witnessing a cyclist crossing railroad tracks.

> **Woman Found Stabbed to Death in Dundee** 
> 
> Omaha, NE 
> 
> A Dundee resident was found stabbed to death in her home early Wednesday morning.  Donna Redley, 37, was found unresponsive by her housekeeper at her residence on 75th and Dodge St. after an apparent break in.  Investigators suspect that the assailant entered through the front door while she was home alone.  The police do not have a suspect and the assailant is currently still at large.  Police Chief Aaron Ricks issued a public statement Thursday night, asking the public to come forward with any leads.  Ricks also implored people in the Dundee area to lock their doors and be on the lookout for any suspicious activity.  If you have any information related to this case, please call Crime Stoppers at ███-███-████.

> 
> **Ms. Redley:**  Seriously?    Am I really being questioned about my own murder?  Clearly I’m alive.
> 
> **Officer Massey:**  It’s just a simple question.  Even if this is some kind joke being played on you by a third party, we’d like to get to the bottom of it.
> 
> **Ms. Redley:**  Well, let’s see, I got home around 6pm watched TV, took shower, went to bed.  Nothing out of the ordinary.
> 
> **Officer Massey:**  So you didn’t leave the house at all after you returned home?
> 
> **Ms. Redley:** Well, technically, I went up the street to grab a burger.  But I was gone, maybe 10 minutes?
> 
> **Officer Massey:**  Did you see anyone?  Anyone suspicious?
> 
> **Ms. Redley:**  This isn’t funny anymore.
> 
> **Officer Massey:**  Please answer the question, miss.
> 
> **Ms. Redley:**  You’ve got to be kidding me.  No, I didn’t see anyone.  I got some food, no one was outside when I got back.  Not even the neighbors.  Where are you even going with this?  What is even the point...

Party known as "Pete" was interviewed, but no known connection to the newspaper were found.  Unrelated break ins had occurred in the weeks leading up to this instance of SCP-4926 but no altercations were involved.

Excerpt from the Omaha World Herald dated 2/01/2001

> **Missing Boy Found in local Construction Site**
> 
> Norfolk, NE
> 
> A missing boy from Norfolk, NE was found deceased in a construction site Friday afternoon.  Andrew Brown, age 7, was found having succumbed to hypothermia at the Pine Ridge housing development.  Authorities were dispatched  Wednesday evening after the boy’s mother reported him missing.  Cynthia Brown, 29 claimed that the child had been outside playing and that she had begun searching for him when he didn’t return.  The missing child was found in the foundation basement of a home that was under construction.  Douglas County police claim the boy had been playing in the area when he became trapped and unable to escape.  Medical examiners concluded that  the boy had been exposed to the elements for 17 hours before ultimately freezing to death in the sub zero temperatures.  Brown is survived by his mother, father, and two sisters.

This article differed from the previous two as active reporting was being conducted on the case as this instance of SCP-4926-1 was generated.  Brown, 7, had survived the incident, but both iterations of the story being circulated was a source of confusion and outrage directed at the newspaper.  However, details in this instance held pertinent details of the subject's location, leading to his eventual rescue.  The circumstances regarding the incident prompted embedded Foundation Field Agents to take notice.  Investigation was subsequently taken over from local authorities.

>

Analysis of the printer, paper, printer roll, and ink was conducted and a notable anomaly was found.  Ink primarily included typical chemical composition, but calcium carbonates, salt, and potassium were found in large quantities within the stencil ink.  This led to inquiries being made of the World Herald Maintenance Staff and later, the Editorial Department.  An admission of the Editorial Manager is detailed below.

> 
> **Interview:**  Elias Liebgalt
> 
> **Elias Liebgalt:**  This is about all the weird columns right?  About the people supposedly being dead but alive?  I promise you, I’m not the one writing them.  We’ve tried to determine where it’s coming from.  I thought we were being hacked, or maybe someone playing a joke.  We haven’t been able to find the culprit.
> 
> **Agent Randall:**  Has there been any other happenings going on that you can tell me?
> 
> **Elias:**  Yeah, there’s something going on with the ink.  The viscosity on the ink has been weird since the first incident happened.  
> 
> **Agent Randall:**  Weird how?  
> 
> **Elias:**  When the papers print, we use a certain viscosity, because ink is pretty expensive.  Too little and you can’t read it, too much and it runs.  But every once and a while, the viscosity will shoot up for no reason.  It always seems to happen when we have one of those weird columns print.  The one with the kid was especially bad.  The viscosity was so high we lost a lot of copies we couldn’t sell.  We’ve had techs look at it 3 or 4 times, but no one can tell me why it’s all wonky.
> 
> **Agent Randall:**  You think it might have something to do with there being human ashes in the ink?
> 
> **Elias:**  Excuse me, what?
> 
> **Agent Randall:**  We found traces of  human ashes in the printing press.  You want to tell me how they got there?
> 
> **Elias:**  Whoa, I know it’s odd, but it was nothing nefarious. About 3 years back, one of our columnists passed away, and when he was cremated,  we had his ashes mixed with the ink.   We didn't dump the whole urn in there.  Just a handful in one of the bottles of K-1.  He was a cherished colleague around here.  We didn’t murder anyone or something like that, if that’s what you mean.
> 
> **Agent Randall:**  What can you tell me about him?
> 
> **Elias:**  Simon.  Well he was a bit odd, paranoid, and had a weird sense of humor.  Kind of guy that liked to say, “I told you so.”  But he was reliable and had a big heart.  Always seemed to have a a run of bad luck though.
> 
> **Agent Randall:**  How so?
> 
> **Elias:**  Lung Cancer.  And his kid died a few years back in a an accident.
> 
> **<End Log>**

The following paragraph appeared in the Sunday Edition of the Omaha World Herald shortly after the recovery of Brown.  An embedded agent in charge of monitoring the press was able to intercept before prints could be delivered for distribution.  SCP-4926 was later confiscated and the publication was issued a replacement unit.

> //Nothing reminds people how much they care about you until they see your name come up in the obituaries.  Your lives and those of your loved ones are precious.  Stop making stupid, absent minded decisions and putting yourselves in harm's way.  People do it every day.  With every cigarette, with every ran stoplight, leaving a kid in a hot car.  I had to do something about the kid.  For a while, I thought he might not get rescued.  Too bad I burned what I had left making it happen.  It’s a lot easier going backwards than it is forwards.//  
> 
> //P.S. Elias, start compressing the dummies in the columns.  You’re wasting space.//
