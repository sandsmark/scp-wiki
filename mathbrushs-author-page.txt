> **Day 1**
> I came in today and discovered a total lack of anti-selachian equipment. Not even a dogfish discus! It seems I've been hired, not at the SPC as I intended, but at some sort of glorified zoo. At least the budget for printer ink is high.

> **Day 2**
> Turns out there was a misplaced decimal place. Hope no one wants to print in color. Looks like my assignment is to proofread new SCP entries and check for completeness. Sounds easy.

> **Day 15?**
> I hate my life. Every day it's the same. So many junior researchers are writing crap articles. "Fart berries"? Seriously? Just because you had bad gas after your lunch doesn't mean you discovered a new SCP.

> **Day 29**
> The agents here are so lazy. And rude. I was curious about the so-called 'Platonic Ideal version of the Foundation'. I tried to access it, but there was nothing. One report and three investigations later, and their little weekly coffee party is gone. Don't hate me for doing my job; hate yourself for wasting company time.

> **Day 98**
> I'm sick of this job. Mutant turtle houses that predict the future? Lame. A statue that breaks your neck if you're not looking? Sounds scary, yeah, until you find out its other super power is pooping. It's time to look somewhere else.

[[tab Thanks]]
Thanks to everyone in the community who builds up and supports writers.

I was a math guy for my whole life and I thought I couldn't write. I failed english until high school, then I got D's.

My Junior year in college, my teacher gave us "Writing with Style" and it changed my life. It made me feel like "I could be a writer".

I didn't get any better at writing, I just realized that I could enjoy it more. One person changed my life.

You could be that person for someone else. My teacher didn't just say 'you're good'. She didn't even say I was good. She gave me the resources to teach myself to be good. You can do that for people on this site, and many of you have done that for me.

I've loved your writing, and I'm so grateful you've chosen to share your stories with other people, including me. Thanks!

**Bacon jam wraps**

**French toast**
* Eight pieces of bread

Crack the eggs and beat. Stir in milk, salt and sugar. Dip bread and cook for 4 minutes each on a lightly greased frying pan set on medium. Enjoy.

Why are you even reading this? Seriously, people are posting a dozen articles a day and you're wasting your time on some author's hack-job author page.

Researcher Talloran, Andrew Swann, and you walk into a bar.

Talloran walks up to the bar and orders a gin and tonic. He takes a sip and flinches. "Uggh," he says, "I just can't finish it," and walks out of the bar.
Andrew Swann orders a <del>Bloody Mary</del><del>Screwdriver</del> water. He knocks it to the ground and shouts, "Make up your mind!"
You make eye contact with the bartender. He says, "Are you going to make a fuss, too?" You shake your head and say, "<span id="YourText">Your text here (enter below to change).</span>"
<form onsubmit="return myFunction()">

> O5-1's kid looks at the others and says "[DATA EXPUNGED. Level-5 ACCESS REQUIRED]"

++ Interactive Fiction

Before I started writing on SCP-Wiki, I wrote a several interactive fiction games (text adventures), which are listed at [http://ifdb.tads.org/showuser?id=nufzrftl37o9rw5t the Interactive Fiction Database].

This game is loosely based on the SCP foundation. I hope you like it!
