++ Interactive Fiction

Before I started writing on SCP-Wiki, I wrote a several interactive fiction games (text adventures), which are listed at [http://ifdb.tads.org/showuser?id=nufzrftl37o9rw5t the Interactive Fiction Database].

This game is loosely based on the SCP foundation. I hope you like it!
