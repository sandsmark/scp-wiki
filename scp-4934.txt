**Description:** SCP-4934 is the late cartoonist Chuck Jones' private study, located within his Newport Beach, CA estate.

**Addendum 4934.01** Notable Breach Attempts

> **Attempt #:** 1
> **Result:** Researcher Rex opens the door to SCP-4934 and attempts to enter. Researcher Rex steps on a rake, forcing the pole of the object to swing at his face and causing him to stumble backward. The door to SCP-4934 shuts immediately afterward. 

> **Attempt #:** 5
> **Result:** Researcher Rex opens the door to SCP-4934. There are no immediately observable obstacles or obstructions, and Rex is ordered to enter. Rex is unable to enter, as the entry to the room has been replaced with a painted facsimile of the room over a brick wall.

> **Attempt #:** 18
> **Result:** Researcher Rex opens the door to SCP-4934, revealing a nude woman bathing. The woman shrieks in alarm and strikes Rex before shutting the door. 

> **Attempt #:** 26
> **Result:** Researcher Rex opens the door to SCP-4934 and is immediately swept away by a line of Can-can dancers, which demanifest upon entering the hallway. The last dancer shuts the door behind it prior to demanifestation. 

> **Attempt #:** 46
> **Result:** Researcher Rex opens the door to SCP-4934 and attempts to enter. Immediately upon passing the threshold, a 50 kg anvil was dropped on his head and the door shuts behind him. Researcher Rex was recovered from the home's basement five minutes later having suffered no major injuries.

> **Attempt #:** 66
> **Result:** Researcher Rex opens the door to SCP-4934 to reveal a series of continuously smaller doors. 32 doors are opened until the experiment is canceled. The doors to SCP-4934 shut immediately afterward.

> **Attempt #:** 75
> **Result:** Researcher Rex opens the door to SCP-4934 to reveal a tall human male dressed in a trenchcoat and fedora. The subject points a revolver at Researcher Rex and says "Get outta here, see? Scram! Scram, see?" in a Chicago accent before shutting the door.

> **Attempt #:** 82
> **Result:** Researcher Rex opens the door to SCP-4934 to reveal the room had been filled with various lit explosives. Researcher Rex shuts the door immediately. Smoke was observed to emerge from underneath the door after a loud explosion is heard. Blast damage was not observed in the room on the following attempt.

> **Attempt #:** 96
> **Result:** Researcher Rex opens the door to SCP-4934 to reveal a humanoid entity identical to himself. Each appeared to mimic the movement of the other, therefore preventing entry into SCP-4934. After two minutes of mimicking one another, the duplicate within the room loudly and abruptly kisses Researcher Rex, shoves him, then shuts the door.

> **Attempt #:** 101
> **Result:** Researcher Rex opens the door to SCP-4934 to reveal shut red curtains. After five seconds, the head of a porcine-humanoid hybrid emerges from between the curtains and says "th-th-th-that's all folks!" before shutting the door. 
> 
> Following this attempt, the door to SCP-4934 could be opened without further anomalous activity. SCP-4934 was reclassified as Neutralized after a one-week observation period.
