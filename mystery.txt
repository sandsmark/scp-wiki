No, Clement, I'm serious. And yes, I do know a little bit of Chinese, so I know when someone says "bullshit". Just because Intelligence Agents are required to know everything doesn't mean we actually know everything.

Oh, you want an example? Alright, fine. We've got some time to kill before this training session is over, and I //love// talking. So sit right back and you'll hear a tale, a tale of... //wow//, blank faces? Jesus Phyrexian Christ, don't you kids watch old TV shows? Anyways...

A few months ago, the higher-ups forced me to take some PTO. I decided to visit a good friend of mine, Susie. Since Clef stole my access card for the Sites, I took her offer to spend the night. I take the guest room, but Susie comments that the bed sucks and since her boyfriend is out, I could crash on her bed if I didn't like it. Nothing inappropriate went on, for the record. Too many of my IA colleges like to imply they are James Bonds, sleeping with hot girls every night. It's mostly bullcrap, and besides, her boyfriend would //kill me//.

Anyways, I'm doing some Foundation work in the Guest Room, because the higher-ups forgot to confiscate my tertiary work tablet. It's around two in the morning, when I get a hankering for some Cinnamon Toast Crunch. I stop working, and walk downstairs to nosh. I'm surprised by the lights being on, and Susie sitting straight-backed on the couch, watching TV. I say hi, she says //"Hello"//, and I get my food.

I make a few jokes about her being up so early, and she just says //"Yes"//. It sounds like her, but it doesn't sound like her. Also, she doesn't even look at me. She's watching some show on Discovery; I can't remember what. I know I'm making it sound dramatic, but it really wasn't. It was off, but not //really// off. It's like turing the tint on a TV a little bit one way or another: something's up, but you can't place it.

So I'm eating, and I'm half-watching Susie watching the TV. I'd put it at 50% "Susie is Cute", and 50% "Something Is Up". She's fixated on the screen, smiling that smile Susie does from time to time, with posture you're taught in fifth grade. Is she okay? //"I'm fine.//. Does her back hurt? //"No, it's okay."//. I'm trying not to have my Foundation Sense kick in. You guys have been here long enough to know that sense.

I finish up the box of CTC, and say goodnight. As I'm about to walk back upstairs, she asks me to hand her the controller. The one sitting right next to her. //"I know. Could you hand it to me?"// I look at her, still watching the TV. I decide to do it. Fundamental rule of the universe: Susie asks, and Bibs complies.

As I take a a few steps towards the clicker, I can't help staring at Susie. Still smiling the smile I've seen countless times, still staring at the Discovery Channel intently. I'm about a foot away, and my Foundation Sense is //screaming//. Get out. Run. Use the Class-A Spray you've got in your bottom-left pocket. **GET AWAY.**

I don't get to be an outstanding IA by ignoring the Foundation Sense. I back away, keeping my eyes on hers. She's still smiling, still sitting straight-backed. I hit the stairs, do a 180, and walk up the stairs, slowly but with purpose. My room is at the far end of the hallway, but Susie's room is closer, on my left side. Something tells me I wouldn't make it to my room's door, so I quickly open Susie's door, do a quick 90, and walk in.

In my peripheral vision, I get a glimpse of the bottom of the stairs. All the lights are out, downstairs, and Susie is standing at the foot of the steps. She's not smiling. She's not anything. It's all I see before I close the door. Pretty sure I should be glad that's all I see.

I stumble around briefly, but find Susie's bed. I hear a groan, and then feel Susie's arm around me.  I don't sleep. I tell her in the morning that the bed made my back hurt, and apologize for not waking her up. Susie being Susie, she doesn't give a rat's ass. She knows I'm not going to try and get in her pants. Again, her boyfriend would //kill me//.

I don't tell her about what happened, and I certainly don't tell her why I'm disturbed when I flip on the TV and NBC comes up. Or why I freak out a little when she tells me her cable package doesn't include Discovery. I make it up to her by buying a bunch of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, since we ran out.
