> Well, since I'm such a lazy schmuck, and I'm currently schvitzing on my tuches, I'm just gonna give a brief summary of myself. If you are in need of a sarcastic, pessimistic, down-right fowl, stereotypically loud, grimy, and somewhat charming man...I ain't it chief. You're probably better off with uncle Lenny downstairs.

Some might even call me an "asshole," but I don't listen to them, mainly because I'm an ignorant asshole. I struggle with reading social cues, in case you care...not sure why you would, but there we go. You know now, CONGRATS!

> Ah screw it, let's just get to the reason why you're here. Beneath this audio log, you will see a list of my works. Read them, or don't, your choice.

> **Lenny from downstairs:** They're pretty long. Probably take you five years to finish them.
