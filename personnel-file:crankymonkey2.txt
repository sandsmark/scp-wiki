> [BEGIN INTRO]
> **CrankyMonkey2:**Well, since I'm such a lazy schmuck, and I'm currently schvitzing on my tuches, I'm just gonna give a brief summary of myself. If you are in need of a sarcastic, pessimistic, down-right fowl, stereotypically loud, grimy, and somewhat charming man...I ain't it chief. You're probably better off with uncle Lenny downstairs. Anyway, enjoy this audio log.
> 
> What do I like? Well...//True Detective: Season 1// is the best show to have ever existed, and you will never change my mind. Rust Cohle is my spirit animal. Uh...food's pretty nice. Not too picky, food is food. And uh...jazz, yeah jazz is nice. //(begins to sweat nervously)// Let's move on then.

> OK, "Key Defining Factors." I play the tuba. Pretty good at it too, if I say so myself.

> **Lenny from Downstairs:** He is! He plays so loud, when I tell him to shut up, he don't even hear me!
> 
> **CrankyMonkey2:** I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A LIFE-CHANGING INNER MONOLOGUE, UNCLE LENNY!

> **Lenny from downstairs:** Oh...sorry.

Fucking hell, this graphic organizer is shi--

> "Struggles and Weaknesses!" Fun. Well, I'm as I said, I'm not the most positive human being in the world. Some might even call me an "asshole," but I don't listen to them, mainly because I'm an ignorant asshole. People also call me childish, I call myself fun. I don't see the point of doing anything without at least having joy in it. Except calculus...calculus is hard and miserable...I struggle with reading social cues, in case you care...not sure why you would, but there we go. You know now, CONGRATS! 
> 
> Ah screw it, let's just get to the reason why you're here. Beneath this audio log, you will see a list of my works. Read them, or don't, your choice.
> 
> **Lenny from downstairs:** They're pretty long. Probably take you five years to finish them.

> //(deep breath)// LENNY I SWEAR TO GO--
