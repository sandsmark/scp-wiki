**Item #:** SCP-1699

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to SCP-286's public location, containment procedures are to focus on preventing access to it. Personnel stationed at SCP-1699 must turn back any person approaching SCP-1699 by alternate means. Any persons found to have knowledge of SCP-1699's anomalous properties are to be given Class-C amnesiacs and have any documents regarding these properties taken and destroyed.

**Description:** SCP-1699 is an inactive volcano located in [REDACTED] National park. SCP-1699 has been inactive for the past 67 years, with the last major eruption having occurred in 1945. SCP-1699 is sentient, and able to communicate with researchers by using its steam vents to create sounds similar to human speech.

Communications with SCP-1699 consist primarily of SCP-1699 complaining about how it wishes to be a more dangerous national disaster such as a hurricane or a tsunami. SCP-1699 has been known to speak to personnel for long periods of time about these wishes, and asking if they would be able to assist it in becoming more dangerous.  SCP-1699 will instruct personnel on various activities it believes would make it more like other disasters.

Completing SCP-1699's instructions will usually not result in anything occurring. However, on several occasions following these instructions has led to anomalous activity in the area around SCP-1699, such as a small thunderstorm occurring when SCP-1699 tried to make a hurricane, and a small whirlpool forming in a local pool when SCP-1699 attempted to cause a tsunami. Anomalous events produced by SCP-1699 have never caused any threats to containment and are usually minor to mild in their intensity. Personnel are instructed to assist SCP-1699 in completing its instructions whenever it is convenient for them.
