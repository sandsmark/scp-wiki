**Item #:** SCP-1699

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to SCP-1699's public location, containment procedures are to focus on preventing access to it. At least 8 guards are to patrol SCP-1699 on all-terrain vehicles, with rotations to occur every 4 hours. Any persons found to have knowledge of SCP-1699's anomalous properties are to be detained for questioning, searched for documents pertaining to SCP-1699, and released following a dose of Class-C amnestics.

**Description:** SCP-1699 is an inactive volcano located in [REDACTED] National park. SCP-1699 has been inactive for the past 67 years, with the last major eruption having occurred in 1945. SCP-1699 is sapient, and possesses the ability to communicate vocally, utilizing its steam vents to mimic speech.

Communication with SCP-1699 consist primarily of SCP-1699 assuming a melancholy disposition, expressing a desire to be what it refers to as a "more dangerous natural disaster", including tsunamis, earthquakes, hurricanes, and tornadoes. SCP-1699 has been known to speak to personnel for long periods of time about these wishes, and asking if they would be able to assist it in becoming more dangerous.  SCP-1699 will instruct personnel on various activities it believes would make it more like other disasters.

Completing SCP-1699's instructions will usually not result in an anomalous event. However, on several occasions following these instructions has led to anomalous activity in the area around SCP-1699, such as a small thunderstorm occurring when SCP-1699 tried to make a hurricane, and a small whirlpool forming in a lake when SCP-1699 attempted to cause a tsunami. Anomalous events produced by SCP-1699 have never caused any threats to containment and are usually minor to mild in their intensity. Personnel are allowed to assist SCP-1699 in completing its instructions whenever it is convenient for them.
