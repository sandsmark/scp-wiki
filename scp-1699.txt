**Item #:** SCP-1699

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to SCP-1699's public location, containment procedures are to focus on preventing access to it. At least 8 guards are to patrol SCP-1699 on all-terrain vehicles, with rotations to occur every 4 hours. Any persons found to have knowledge of SCP-1699's anomalous properties are to be detained for questioning, searched for documents pertaining to SCP-1699, and released following a dose of Class-C amnestics.

**Description:** SCP-1699 is an inactive volcano located in [REDACTED] National park. SCP-1699 has been inactive for the past 67 years, with the last major eruption having occurred in 1945. SCP-1699 is sapient, and possesses the ability to communicate vocally, utilizing steam vents to mimic speech.

Communication with SCP-1699 centers almost exclusively around its desire to become "a more dangerous natural disaster," and various means to achieve that end. Conversation participants have described SCP-1699's disposition as "melancholy" and "bummed out", but note that despite this, it never ceases to try new avenues toward its goal. SCP-1699 has been known to speak to personnel for prolonged periods of time about these desires, and has repeatedly requested assistance with becoming more dangerous. If accepted, SCP-1699 will instruct personnel on various activities it believes increases the similarities of it and other natural disasters.

Following instructions provided by SCP-1699 rarely results in anomalous activity. However, on several occasions, following these instructions has led to activity in the area surrounding SCP-1699, including small thunderstorm occurring following an attempt to create a hurricane, and a small whirlpool forming in a lake following an attempt to cause a tsunami. Anomalous events produced by SCP-1699 have not, as of yet, produced a serious threat to containment and are usually deemed minor in their intensity. Personnel may attempt to assist SCP-1699 in completing its instructions whenever it is convenient for them, however it is not necessary.
