**Item #:** SCP-2006

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2006 is kept in a hermetically sealed and triple-reinforced biological containment cell at Site 138-Delta. Any maintenance of this cell is to be performed via remotely-operated rovers; personnel are strictly forbidden from entering the 00 m radius Red Zone around it at any time.

No more than once per month, one (1) D-Class personnel slated for termination is to be delivered into SCP-2006's chamber for "punishment". There is no conclusive evidence that SCP-2006 requires food, water, oxygen, or sustenance of any kind, but the introduction of this containment procedure has reduced containment breach incidents by 99%.

**Description:** SCP-2006-1 is a sentient, sapient entity that causes catastrophic psychological damage to human subjects that observe it directly. Physical descriptions from test subjects exposed to SCP-2006 vary, but consistently describe a "mass of writhing tentacles, adorned with serpentine eyes". Some test subjects have reported that SCP-2006's tentacles are also capable of detachment and autonomous activity.

SCP-2006 can communicate telepathically with human subjects within 75 m, which has allowed for research staff to interview the entity; all such communication must be performed while designated staff members are wearing a helmet lined with no less than 17 mm of [[[SCP-148|Telekill alloy]]] to prevent brain hemorrhage or other neurological damage.

SCP-2006-2 and SCP-2006-3 are, respectively, a hand-sewn article of clothing resembling a short white and pink dress made from lace-lined silk sized for SCP-2006-1 and a crudely crafted artifact resembling a baton or wand topped with a crescent moon and a rough-cut ruby. Both objects appear to be non-anomalous, but appear to have significant sentimental value to SCP-2006-1, as it will become highly agitated and attempt to breach containment if these objects are confiscated or otherwise taken from it. By O5 Council order, they are to be left in the possession of SCP-2006-1 until further notice.

SCP-2006 was discovered in and recovered from an underground cavern in [REDACTED], Texas following an incident in which a group of civilian explorers inadvertently awakened the entity while exploring an unexplored cave network. All surviving civilians were administered Class A amnestics and given a cover story involving a cave collapse. SCP-2006 was recovered along with a large collection of non-anomalous DVDs, which have been contained separately in a secure storage area. SCP-2006-1 has not requested their return, claiming that it has already memorized their contents anyways.

**Addendum 2006-01:** Interview Log

//Interview responses from SCP-2006-1 are received telepathically and thus are the result of transcription, cross-reference, and verification by three (3) separate staff members as a part of interview protocols.//

//It is unclear what happened next, however all surviving personnel at Site 138-Delta reported seeing a brilliant flash of bright red or pink light despite not having direct line-of-sight to SCP-2006-1. Six (6) personnel were killed by massive brain hemorrhages, thirty-eight (38) were permanently blinded, and Drs. Kinomoto and Tsukino were heard exclaiming "SO CUTE" in Japanese before vaporizing into clouds of pastel-colored dust. Dr. █████████ recovered fully after three (3) months of hospitalization for neurological trauma.//
