**Item #:** SCP-290

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-290 is to be held in a 5 m x 5 m x 5 m cell at Site-19.  Personnel are forbidden from exposing organic matter to SCP-290 except during an approved testing procedure, and any personnel who attempt to do so must be terminated with any force necessary. During any interaction with SCP-290, three guards with knowledge of the object and of low desire for knowledge (ascertained by psychometric tests administered by Foundation psychologists) must flank the object's aperture; anyone attempting to enter must be removed from the object's cell. Subjects who undergo reconfiguration must be terminated at the conclusion of the experiment of which they are part.


**Description:** SCP-290 is a hollow metallic sphere 3 m in diameter, with a circular opening of diameter 90 cm cut into one side. This sphere is welded to four metal posts 50 cm in height. Scans have shown that SCP-290 is composed of a combination of aluminium and [DATA EXPUNGED], many of which do not match any known atomic structure. All attempts to take samples of the metal for more detailed analysis have failed. The temperature of the 'wall' remains constant at 318 Kelvin (45 ^^o^^C) regardless of the ambient conditions. As no power source for the device has been found, how it maintains this temperature is as-yet unknown.

Personnel who enter the vicinity of SCP-290 will express curiosity as to its purpose, endeavouring to collect as much knowledge as possible. Should subjects be denied this information, or told that the purpose is unknown, they will feel strongly compelled to enter the device to discover it themselves. Around 60% of such subjects will use force to gain access to SCP-290 should they be prevented from reaching it, with ~██% using deadly force. Subjects who are informed about SCP-290's effect will experience a markedly reduced compulsion to enter, although those predisposed to heightened curiosity or desire for knowledge may still be coerced into doing so.

Once a subject has entered SCP-290, the aperture will shrink rapidly, rendering the inside section inaccessible. After between 5 and 20 minutes, the aperture will reopen. No sound can be heard emanating from SCP-290 during this period. Subjects emerge from this process alive, conscious (albeit often in a state of extreme distress), but with their anatomy significantly altered. Limbs, facial features and [REDACTED] appear to be relocated randomly, yet without losing functionality. Fingers and toes are often removed from the hands and feet, and eyes rarely remain in a configuration lending itself to binocular vision. Almost all subjects report pain and discomfort in breathing and movement, with most unable to walk or locomote in any other fashion.

Autopsies performed on afflicted subjects reveal that a similar reconfiguration occurs internally, with organ placement changed and blood vessels/nerves lengthened to fit the new arrangement. Evidence of severe internal bleeding and haemorrhage of other bodily fluids is often present, although subjects present with none of the connected symptoms on retrieval from SCP-290, and no subject has died as a direct result of exposure to the object. Subjects' bones show evidence of large-scale fracturing, but also rapid healing, ostensibly a part of the modification process. Subjects remain conscious throughout the reconfiguration, see Addendum 290-1 for details.

**Addendum 290-1: Experiment Log**
//Subject:// D-59414, male, 18.
//Supervisor:// Dr. S███████, SCP-290 lead researcher
//Purpose:// Ascertain the experiences of subjects within SCP-290

//Procedure:// D-59414 was exposed to SCP-290, having had no prior experience with the entity. Subject immediately inquired as to its function, to which Dr. S███████ replied 'that is what we intend to find out'. After several subsequent inquires from the subject were rebuffed, subject was provided with an IR-sensitive video camera and ordered to enter the object; subject complied without resistance. Aperture re-opened 17.4 minutes after closure, subject and video camera retrieved.

//<A transcript of the video feed recovered from the camera follows>//
Video feed initially shows subject sitting calmly in the centre of SCP-290, looking around and examining his surroundings by touch at intervals. This continues for around 2 minutes, at which point the subject begins clutching his chest and groaning. ~30 seconds later the subject's left arm begins to shift downward, making a loud cracking noise as it does so. Subject begins to scream, uttering 'I was only curious, but I know now. Please, let me go.'. Whether this indicates a secondary consciousness inhabiting the subject's mind, with which he was conversing, is unknown.

Reconfiguration process continues for approximately 12 minutes, ending with the subject's head partially embedded into his right thigh, most fingers scattered around his torso along with both legs, and both hands and arms relocated to his back without separation. Only one eye is visible, being on the subject's right foot, the other was relocated [DATA EXPUNGED]. Process appears to move limbs across and occasionally through other tissue, evidently eliciting extreme pain in the subject. No contact between the subject and an external agent is observed.

At the conclusion of the reconfiguration the subject lays on his side in a pattern vaguely reminiscent of the fetal position, breathing heavily. Subject remains placid until retrieval.
//<End transcript>//

An debriefing interview was scheduled, but owing to the subject's larynx being relocated away from his trachea could not be conducted. Autopsy showed wide-scale reorganisation of the subject's internal organs, including small-scale fusing of parts of the small intestine and [DATA EXPUNGED], resulting in contamination of the chest cavity [DATA EXPUNGED]. Despite this, the subject had a normal volume of blood within his circulatory system, and levels of other bodily fluids such as bile were within normal parameters. How SCP-290 maintains or replenishes these fluids is unknown.
