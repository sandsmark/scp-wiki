**Document #290-1**: Area of location
SCP-290 was found during a missionary trip in Africa near ███████. Volunteers of ███ found many misconfigured people, thinking that it was only a genetic disease, they spread their mercy. After more of these cases were found the volunteers started to follow the trail along side the ██████████ area. Eventually they ran across a large metalic structure with many of these misconfigured people around it. Upon closer examination, the object was spitting these people out. The missionaries returned to █████ after contacting the SCP Orginization. Shortly after contact, the object now known as SCP-290 was captured and locked away with no trouble at all. All misconfigured humans from SCP-290 were eradicated.
