**Item #:** SCP-279

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** There is no known way of inhibiting SCP-279’s movements. As 279 has not yet been sighted outside of his host town, ████, the city has been placed under a Level-█ lockdown. No media regarding SCP-279 is permitted to leave the town. If at all possible, the civilians are to be kept unaware of the anomalous properties of SCP-279, as well as the fact that their city is being monitored. 
--SCP-279 requires no other containment methods to remain secure.-- A minimum of 2 undercover agents are to follow SCP-279’s movements as closely as they are able.


**Description:** SCP-279 appears to be a man in his early forties, of unremarkable appearance and dress. 279 has proven to not respond to any form of external stimuli, and has not been observed to deviate from a standard neutral expression or, for that matter, blink. This, in conjunction with an unnaturally rigid manner 279 has of moving, has been noted to unsettle personnel. 279 has been reported to spontaneously disappear and reappear throughout ████, rendering it somewhat difficult to follow 279 from an hour-to-hour basis.

SCP-279 seemingly spends the majority of its time travelling through the town of ████. Attempts to eradicate 279 have failed. 279 continues whatever he is in the process of doing regardless of any injury he has sustained. Small portions of 279 attempt to continue locomotion even when separated from the whole. In the light of this, it has been decided to indefinitely postpone attempts to dispatch 279, as it is difficult to maintain adequate levels of security when an apparently mortally wounded man is sighted repeatedly by civilians. All DNA and [REDACTED] samples taken confirm that 279 is human.

Upon approximately ████ military time every day, SCP-279 has vanished for █ hours and returned in its original state at another location in ████. Containment or restraint is impossible as SCP-279 possesses an inordinate amount of strength when physically restrained and has utilized its ability to spontaneously reappear in a different location in ████ when indirectly restrained. 

Although SCP-279 has no known motive, it does not have a known history of violently behavior. 279 has been observed standing in unusual areas for up to ███ hours (█ days) at a stretch, looking into windows of occupied rooms for extended periods of time, walking in a circle roughly two meters in diameter for ██ hours, [DATA EXPUNGED] in houses, [REDACTED] civilian population [REDACTED], entering shops and [REDACTED] staring [REDACTED] shop manager informed local authorities after three minutes, walking along roads, ect.

Care must be taken to avoid direct skin contact with 279. When such contact is made, the person in question will vanish along with 279 at the usual time of disappearance. Only one individual has been recovered after direct contact with 279, despite [REDACTED] D-class and equipment expended. Said individual appeared to be in a state of near-catatonic shock upon recovery in a basement. After being relocated to Site-██, the subject showed signs of being legally blind despite examinations proving vision was only slightly farsighted. Subject appeared to be reasonably lucid despite showing signs of mental [DATA EXPUNGED]

[DATA EXPUNGED] reported saying “Get away from me,” repeatedly while [DATA EXPUNGED] however, does not satisfactorily explain the injuries the subject incurred while confined to a straightjacket, in a padded room. Possibly, the subject is experiencing [DATA EXPUNGED]

See attached document outlining the actions taken by SCP-279 on a standard day.

**Addendum-279-A:** Agents monitoring SCP-279 have brought to our attention a problematic development. While in the past, information leaks were simple to secure due to the fact that 279 rarely appeared near large crowds, it has recently been visiting areas with higher concentrations of civilians.
More conspicuously odd actions have also been reported, although this may be due to the fact that more people are reporting unusual events surrounding SCP-279. Despite our best efforts, 279 has since become something of a landmark of the town due to his open, unusual behavior. Liberal amounts of amnesiacs were administered when citizens noticed connections between missing individuals (all of whom had inadvertently brushed 279 while walking in a crowd, or found other forms of contact with it) and 279. Violence directed towards SCP-279 caused attracted large amounts of attention and resulted in an immense security breach before Agents were able to arrive.
Currently, efforts are being made to maintain security without upsetting the population of ████. However, if [REDACTED] fails, the city of ████ is to be put under a Level-██ lockdown. Attempts to maintain any pretense that ████ is not being closely monitored will be discontinued. As ████ is a relatively small town, the process of [DATA EXPUNGED] ought to go smoothly.
I request for more thorough contingency plans to be made in the event that SCP-279 relocates to a heavily populated city, or becomes aggressive.

**LEVEL 5 SECURITY CLEARANCE REQUIRED:** Recently, a researcher who has a notable history of [REDACTED] noticed an odd distortion in a picture of SCP-279. After considerable concentration, the doctor was able to see a slight [REDACTED] in all files depicting SCP-279.

Dr. █████ then dedicated ██ hours of her free time finding an effective method of [REDACTED] an extremely elaborate and convoluted process [REDACTED] was able to achieve the desired effect.

An extremely subtle memetic effect had affected SCP-279 and nearly all examinations it was involved in. Since then, 279 has been confirmed to be most certainly not human. DNA re-testing [DATA EXPUNGED]. Anomalous properties [DATA EXPUNGED]. New developments have not shed any light on 279’s motives.

As per mutual agreement, the Containment Procedures regarding SCP-279 have been updated. Agents tasked with monitoring 279 have not been informed of its nature, as the information was deemed to be too distressing.
