**Item #:** SCP-3117

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** A Foundation-operated bot (I/O-SPIRAL) is to monitor online communities for discussions regarding SCP-3117. MTF Phi-11 ("Promise-Keepers") is to investigate these discussions and make a determination for appropriate action on a case-by-case basis.

Any materials confirmed to contain components of SCP-3117 are to be isolated if possible, and — if not — referred to the Foundation's Disinformation Bureau for immediate action. Subjects who have experienced SCP-3117 are to be isolated for study.

[[[task-forces#iota-10|MTF Iota-10 ("Damn Feds")]]] are to continue the ongoing investigation regarding the location featured in Addendum 3117.1.

**Description:** SCP-3117 is a recurring dream triggered via exposure to certain components. These components take the form of specific ideas, concepts, phrases, and images. While exposure to all components are required to trigger occurrences of SCP-3117, these components can be spread across multiple forms of media (including film, audio, print, and still images). Consequently, no one source is known to contain all components responsible for triggering SCP-3117.

Although subjects' experiences with SCP-3117 vary, the following symptoms have been noted among those who have or will experience SCP-3117:
* An aversion to discussing or describing SCP-3117. 
* Suspicion that they are receiving warnings regarding SCP-3117.
* A growing sense of urgency, inevitability, and/or dread. 
* The belief that they are being watched. 

In approximately 1 out of 7 cases, subjects who experience SCP-3117 will go missing shortly after the dream's first occurrence. Investigations into this phenomenon are ongoing.

**Addendum 3117.1:** Discovery

In 2006, a member of the [[[goc-hub-page|Global Occult Coalition]]]'s PSYCHE Division contacted Site-95 with the goal of transferring responsibility for containment of "UTE-2639-Pygmalion Blit" over to Foundation care. After several months of negotiation, 378 items (including several hundred documents, digital files, photographs, and one Betamax tape) were taken into Foundation custody. After an extensive clearance process by the on-duty HMCL supervisor, these items have been catalogued as part of SCP-3117's documentation.

**{{GAMMA: There's -- there's stairs. They lead down. Spiraling down, into the ground. I look down and I can't see the bottom. It's too far.}}**

**{{LADYBUG: Keep going.}}**

**{{GAMMA: I go down the stairs. Something's -- something's watching --}}**

**{{VOODOO: What's watching you?}}**

**{{GAMMA: -- and, it's -- I don't know. Something's watching me. Something's waiting for me at the bottom. But I can't stop. I start going faster and faster, and then I reach the bottom. There's a pit. There's light coming from the pit. I look down.}}**

**Addendum 3117.2:** Interview

As part of the agreement between the Foundation and the GOC, the Foundation was permitted to interview a former GOC operative (Jennifer Selwick) who had been part of the assessment team assigned to investigate SCP-3117.

> 
> **JENNER:** What can you tell me about SCP-3117?
> 
> **SUBJECT:** You've got all our files on it. What do you want me to tell you?
> 
> **JENNER:** The files don't paint the whole picture. Several of them are incomplete, and show signs of damage --
> 
> **SUBJECT:** That's probably on account of my team destroying as much of it as we could.

> **SUBJECT:** No.

> **JENNER:** -- cognitohazardous? No?

> 
> **JENNER:** SCP-3117.
> 
> **SUBJECT:** Right, whatever. 3117 -- it isn't -- it isn't whatever you think it is. There's a reason the GOC stopped looking into it and threw everything I didn't destroy over to you guys. 
> 
> **JENNER:** And why is that?
> 
> **SUBJECT:** We've been investigating this thing for maybe ten, twenty years? And it's eaten its way through --

> **JENNER:** 'Eaten'?

We originally thought it was some sort of entity, maybe a Type-Green or Type-Blue, but -- no, it's nothing like that. It's@@...@@ not even a monster, I don't think. It's just -- it's just a trap. A monster-shaped hole.

> **JENNER:** I'm not sure I --
> 
> **SUBJECT:** You try to work it out, because that's what you do when you're clever -- you work things out. But with every piece you 'find', you're filling that hole up. You're reassembling a puzzle of your own creation, one you didn't even know you were solving. Until --

> 
> **SUBJECT:** Until the hole isn't a hole anymore. Until it's staring back up at you.
> 
> **JENNER:** Are you saying SCP-3117 creates some sort of monster? 
> 
> **SUBJECT:** We think we tell each other scary stories for fun, but maybe there's another reason. I think -- I think some of these stories, when we tell them -- they're not meant to be thrilling. They're meant to be warnings. A warning to stop. To not open that door -- to not go down the stairs. To stop watching the movie, or listening to that story, or reading that article. But you don't realize it. Not until it's too late. Not until...
