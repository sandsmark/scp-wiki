**Item #:** SCP-4072

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation Webcrawler B9G41 is to monitor online digital software distribution programs for instances of SCP-4072. Any and all instances are to be reported and/or removed immediately upon discovery. In the event SCP-4072 is downloaded onto devices not owned by the Foundation or any of its branches, Mobile Task Force Kappa 10, "Skynet" is to be dispatched immediately to administer amnestics and remove instances of SCP-4072 and SCP-4072-X from public custody.

Consoles and handheld devices with SCP-4072 installed on them are to be stored in a 1.6 x 1.6 x 1.3 meter plastic storage tote located in Storage Sector 7 within Site 15.[[footnote]]Containment procedures are being revised to avoid future manifestations of SCP-4072-Alpha.[[/footnote]] During relocation, this plastic storage tote is only to be moved during the daytime, as the risk of an SCP-4072-Alpha manifestation has been shown to be significantly higher during the hours of 6:00 PM to 12:00 AM EST.

Any video games purchased or downloaded from SCP-4072 are to be designated SCP-4072-X. Copies of SCP-4072-X are to be stored on the hard drive of the console SCP-4072 was downloaded onto. D and C-Class personnel, along with foundation researchers[[footnote]]Foundation researchers are only to interact with instances of SCP-4072-1 downloaded above the "Low" download quality level.[[/footnote]], are approved for contact with instances of SCP-4072-X.

Victims of SCP-4072-X instances downloaded on the “Low” or “Very Low” quality setting are to be kept alive for as long as feasibly possible for research purposes. Victims of SCP-4072-X instances downloaded on the "Very High" quality setting, specifically D-Class personnel, are to be released from foundation custody, as they no longer pose a threat to the populace.

**Description:** SCP-4072 is a free digital software distribution service capable of hosting and publicly distributing any known and existing software meeting its requirements to be considered a video game.[[footnote]]These requirements are not yet fully understood.[[/footnote]] Any software downloaded from SCP-4072 tends to be extremely anomalous in nature, with the game itself noticeably different, mostly through removal or alteration of characters, textures, graphics, settings, or events that take place within the normal game. Upon completing an SCP-4072-X instance, a memetic agent will be displayed onscreen. The agent’s effects can take many different forms, ranging from very positive to very negative.

**Incident Report:** On 11/19/2018, 9:12 AM EST, advertisements for SCP-4072 were displayed on several electronic billboards located near Joplin, Missouri, over a week before Black Friday. Power supply to the billboards displaying the advertisements was promptly disconnected to prevent further anomalous activity regarding SCP-4072.

15 hours later, power was restored to billboards that were displaying advertisements for SCP-4072. In place of the advertisement was a plain, black background displaying the word "don't" in the middle in plain white. The significance of this image and the word is unknown.

**Notes:** Amnestics were delivered to those present in the surrounding area during the presence of the SCP-4072 advertisements.

**Incident Report:** On 7/21/1986, 10:24 PM EST, advertisements for SCP-4072 were displayed on all existing television channels simultaneously. This is widely considered to be the first occurrence of an SCP-4072 advertisement in foundation history, and SCP-4072's origin point.

Amnestics were delivered to the majority of the populace following the incident corresponding to level of exposure. █████ █████████[[footnote]]Full name redacted per request.[[/footnote]], a civilian, managed to record the commercial's ending on a Video Home System tape.

**Notes:** Prior to 9/11/2003, SCP-4072 manifested in the form of cartridges instead of downloadable software. It is also heavily implied that SCP-4072 changed its slogan during this period.

**Incident Report:** On ██/██/2019, 7:34 PM EST, Site 15 Security Officer ██████ █████ reported several rustling noises coming from within Storage Sector 7, specifically the plastic storage tote containing the consoles which SCP-4072 was downloaded onto. Several field agents were called in to deal with the issue. Ten minutes into searching, a 2.7 meter tall humanoid entity, now designated SCP-4072-Alpha, began emerging out of the box in which the consoles were being stored at the time. The entity immediately expressed hostility towards the field agents present at the scene. The entity was reported to be covered in a black, opaque, substance which has yet to be identified, [[footnote]]Field inspection has shown that this substance bears a consistency similar to that of glue.[[/footnote]]along with possessing long, disproportionate limbs. According to field agents at the scene, the entity was glowing green and blue from multiple orifices, and its vocalizations consisted mainly of corrupted and distorted white noise, along with pained screeching. This entity was also reported to have several long cables extending from the back of its head and several more strewn along its torso, arms, and legs. The entity demanifested 30 minutes later after security personnel attempted to apprehend it.

**Notes:** DNA samples left by SCP-4072-Alpha were genetically identical to █████ █████████, age 11, who went missing on 7/16/1989. Containment procedures are being revised.
