**Item #:** SCP-113

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-113 requires no extraordinary containment procedures, and is to be kept in a standard storage locker in Site-23.  SCP-113 is hazardous to personnel, and should be handled only through rubber laboratory gloves to prevent accidental exposure.  Personnel accidentally exposed to SCP-113 are to be kept under medical observation for 24 hours.

**Description:** SCP-113 resembles a small piece of red jasper, but when analyzed under EDX, Mass Spec. and other fingerprinting analysis, is found to consist of none of the usual constituents. Instead, its composition is similar to that of [[[SCP-338]]].

When touched by the flesh of an organism possessing sex chromosomes, the object changes both the genetic and the physical sex of the entire organism. This happens in 3 stages. In the first stage, lasting approximately 0.2 seconds, the object forms a bond with the cells that it touches and induces an unknown chemical change. In the second stage, lasting approximately 2 seconds, the item emits a low-energy wave that travels through the body. This causes a complex protein interaction that changes the chromosomes of the organism to those of the opposite sex. In the third and final stage, which lasts around 20 seconds, the item emits another wave that causes cells in the body and the peripheral nervous system to change to a unique variation of partially-differentiated stem cells. Upon returning to normal human tissue, the subject will be physically altered to the opposite gender. This change is semi-permanent, in that it can only be reversed by a second contact with the item. When the object is placed into direct contact with asexual organisms or inorganic material, it begins the process, but stops at the first stage.

The process of transformation has been described as excruciatingly painful. The initial bonding process causes tissue damage similar to third-degree burns, penetrating into subcutaneous fat and muscle tissue in rare cases.  The "wave" described in the second stage causes extreme nausea and vomiting, along with feeling similar to burning across the skin and through internal organs. Restructuring of the nervous system causes intense stimulation of all sensory nerves, including those that transmit pain and sexual arousal. The third-stage process of transformation has a failure rate of approximately 25%. In about half of failed transformation, partial or complete obliteration of the genitals is experienced, along with lacerations of the skin and abdominal organs as they transform at slightly different rates. An additional half of failed cases result in death of the subject by severe organ trauma or internal bleeding, or partial or complete paralysis.  Minor tissue damage, usually to the skin, occurs in nearly 75% of all cases. The failure rate increases exponentially for multiple exposures, often resulting in permanent damage even after successful transformation. Note that there is a significant risk of [DATA EXPUNGED] after multiple exposures.

**Document #113-2:** "Yes, it is quite hilarious exposing new class D personnel to SCP-113. Yes, anyone who does this again will be happily watching over Keter-class objects for the remainder of his or her brief stay with us." -- Dr. Klein

**Note:** Dr. ██████ has proposed this item in the use of gaining more watchers on [[[SCP-234]]]; testing will commence soon.

**Experiment Report #113-4:** Testing with subjects sex-changed by [[[SCP-767]]] shows that SCP-113 cannot reverse the sex shift. So far this is the only known case wherein SCP-113 cannot induce a sex change. Accordingly, any woman who touches SCP-113 and does not become male should be assumed to have been transformed by SCP-767.
