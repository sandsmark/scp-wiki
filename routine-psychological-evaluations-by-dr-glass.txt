**Notes:**
//As my official statement, I would like to note that I think all foundation personnel are deeply disturbed, often amoral, human beings suffering from varying states of anomie.  Except Agent Diogenes, who is a very nice young lady/man who should go bowling with me on Saturday// Dr. Glass

*Note:**
//Glass, s/he's just not that into you. Pull on yer big boy pants and deal. Also, who the hell thought it was a good idea to give ME access to these files?// -Dr. Bright.
