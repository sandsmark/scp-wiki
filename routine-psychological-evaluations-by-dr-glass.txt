**Notes:**
//As my official statement, I would like to note that I think all foundation personnel are deeply disturbed, often amoral, human beings suffering from varying states of anomie.  Except Agent Diogenes, who is a very nice young lady/man who should go bowling with me on Saturday// Dr. Glass
