**Item #:** SCP-445

**Object Class:** Safe  

**Special Containment Procedures:**

Access to and testing of SCP-445 must be approved by staff with level 2 security clearance or higher, and each request must include a list of tests to be carried out. Any testing must be done with the accompaniment of no less than two guards for the entirety of testing. Any deviation from the preapproved list of tests will result in immediate termination of testing and a severe reprimand.

**Description:**

SCP-445 consists of three stacks of white 11" x 17" paper. Each individual leaf has the text "Dr. Wondertainment's Super Paper!" stamped on the bottom-left corner. While in its natural state, SCP-445 cannot be torn or burned, water has no adverse effect on it, and glue or tape will not stick to SCP-445. Observation of SCP-445 has found that its fibers are much more dense than normal paper fibers at 3000 kg/m^^3^^, and a micro-layer of an unidentifiable substance is coated on each individual fiber.

When SCP-445 is folded into a representation of an object, SCP-445 takes on the qualities of the object in question. While in its folded state, SCP-445 can only be unfolded into its original state by the person who originally folded it. SCP-445 can also be rolled, and it will stick to itself if slight pressure is applied. Drawing on SCP-445 does not produce any unusual effect, with the exception of any details illustrated for folded/rolled objects.

**Addendum:** 10/15: Dr. █████ Testing Log:

**Folded Into:** A paper tube - When observed through one of the open ends, SCP-445 acted as a hand-held telescope, enhancing the view of objects within a 25 ft. distance.

**Folded Into:** A Christmas tree - Remained stable when stood upright. When green and red lights were drawn onto the tree, they lit up despite the lack of a physical light source.

**Folded Into:** A small knife - Became very sturdy and sharp, giving several researchers paper cuts when attempting to hold it. Able to hold its own against actual metal weaponry.

**Folded Into:** A conical paper tube - Acted as a megaphone, though amplified only the folder's voice. When a volume control was drawn onto the side, the folder was able to change the volume of the megaphone.

**Folded Into:** A paper cup - Became very rigid. Able to hold extremely hot or volatile liquids without any sign of tearing or melting.

**Folded Into:** A paper crane - Became animate, much like [[[SCP-368]]], though much slower and easily catchable. Recommend research into a possible connection between the two.

**Folded Into:** A crumpled wad of paper - [DATA EXPUNGED] leaving three D-class personnel dead. Testing session ended.
