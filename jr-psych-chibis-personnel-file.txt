[[tab CoolProfile.scpd]]
My official Foundation dossier is boring and doesn't tell you anything, so here's a much better much cooler super radical profile so you can figure out all my dark secrets.

NOTE TO SELF: make sure you don't do something stupid like attach this to your actual official Foundation dossier on the network, moron, Uncle David isn't gonna help you with that

[[include component:image-block name=http://www.scp-wiki.net/local--files/jr-psych-chibis-personnel-file/pester%20vs%20blackwood|caption=I'll draw things if you ask nicely, like this picture of Pesterbot and Lord Blackwood that Junior Researcher asked for.]]
**Names I use:** Chibi, Blake, Maxson

**Names other people use for me:** oh shit run it's Yamagusuku

**Birthday:** April 26

**Age:** I think like 28 or something I stopped counting

**Gender:**  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ which translates to "nonbinary girl/boy I think" or something like that (he or they if you call me Maxson, she or they if you call me Blake, any of those if you call me Chibi)

**Orientation:** polyam pan ace

**Ethnicity:** Japanese/Okinawan

**Nationality:** American and Japanese (don't tell the Japanese government I'm a dual citizen, I never denounced my Japanese citizenship)

**Likes:** cats, problematic fictional characters, drawing, salmon-ikura chirashi-don, coming up with a million story ideas and then never writing them down, my fiance

**Dislikes:** filling out incident forms, drawing, sour stuff

**How I joined the Foundation:** My grandma kept pestering my uncle (y'know the tech dude, [http://www.scp-wiki.net/new-technical-issues David Rosen], the guy that fixes everyone's tech when they inevitably fuck it up) about getting me a job at that great place he was working at, and she wouldn't stop bothering him about it so he kinda caved and recommended my hiring. Is that nepotism? Eh, I dunno, I doubt he would have actually recommended me if I wasn't good enough and I wouldn't have been hired anyway if I was a shitty psychologist.
