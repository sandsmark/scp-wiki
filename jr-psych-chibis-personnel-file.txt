Maybe if you look deeper, you'll find an older relic of who I used to be.

[[include component:image-block name=http://www.scp-wiki.net/local--files/jr-psych-chibis-personnel-file/pester%20vs%20blackwood|caption=I'll still draw things if you ask nicely, like this picture of Pesterbot and Lord Blackwood a Junior Researcher asked for. This is, however, at least 7 years old by this point and my art has both changed style and gotten marginally better.]]
