[[tab CoolProfile.scpd]]
My official Foundation dossier is boring and doesn't tell you anything, so here's a much better much cooler super radical profile so you can figure out all my dark secrets.

NOTE TO SELF: make sure you don't do something stupid like attach this to your actual official Foundation dossier on the network, moron, Uncle David isn't gonna help you with that

[[include component:image-block name=http://www.scp-wiki.net/local--files/jr-psych-chibis-personnel-file/pester%20vs%20blackwood|caption=I'll draw things if you ask nicely, like this picture of Pesterbot and Lord Blackwood that Junior Researcher asked for.]]
**Names I use:** Chibi, Blake, Maxson

**Names other people use for me:** oh shit run it's Yamagusuku

**Birthday:** April 26

**Age:** I think like 28 or something I stopped counting

**Gender:**  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ which translates to "nonbinary lady/guy I think" or something like that (he if you call me Maxson, they if you call me Blake, either of those if you call me Chibi, I don't use she)

**Orientation:** polyam pan ace

**Ethnicity:** Japanese/Okinawan

**Nationality:** American and Japanese (don't tell the Japanese government I'm a dual citizen, I never denounced my Japanese citizenship)

**Likes:** cats, problematic fictional characters, drawing, salmon-ikura chirashi-don, coming up with a million story ideas and then never writing them down, my fiance

**Dislikes:** filling out incident forms, drawing, sour stuff

**How I joined the Foundation:** My grandma kept pestering my uncle (y'know the tech dude, [http://www.scp-wiki.net/new-technical-issues David Rosen], the guy that fixes everyone's tech when they inevitably fuck it up) about getting me a job at that great place he was working at, and she wouldn't stop bothering him about it so he kinda caved and recommended my hiring. Is that nepotism? Eh, I dunno, I doubt he would have actually recommended me if I wasn't good enough and I wouldn't have been hired anyway if I was a shitty psychologist.

++ Foundation

[[collapsible show="      ◾  Researcher Dr. Arc Mitchell" hide="      ◾  The Guardian"]]
A protector of things, in a manner both self-proclaimed and bestowed upon. Working for the Foundation came from a desire to protect humanity, but also to protect the anomalous from the destruction that humanity would inevitably attempt against it. Their strong sense of protection and preservation also creates internalized difficulty in reconciling it during conflicts of other morals, ethics, or interest.

All in all, that which seeks to destroy what they work to guard would do well to watch the fuck out.

[[collapsible show="      ◾  Junior Psychologist Blake Maxson "Chibi" Yamagusuku" hide="      ◾  The Self"]]
About as literal as an author avatar can be, a direct self-insert of who the author would be in the Foundation. Chibi is fully aware of being an author avatar, and regularly bargains for less terrible things to happen to them in tales, and to actually show up in the author's own wiki works.
[[/collapsible]]

++ SCPs
[[collapsible show="      ◾  SCP-1534-2 / Ghost" hide="      ◾  The Psychopomp"]]
[[[SCP-1534 |SCP-1534-2]]], real name Ghost, is a psychopomp entity who was once human but "modified" by powers that be into the form he takes now. Souls are a "substance" that don't adhere to standard universe physics, extracted from the bodies of humans after death that he collects through various animal soul-carriers. What happens with the souls after they make their way to him is unknown, but whatever the reason he is always somehow successful in collecting them without being perceived by humans.

He doesn't seem to have any malice for humanity, although this may be more that he is benign rather than benevolent. Why he's so intent on staying out of human perception is unknown, but whatever the reason, he isn't too against letting the Foundation know that he exists.
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="      ◾  SCP-1534-1 / Bones" hide="      ◾  The Bone-Eater"]]
[[[SCP-1534 |SCP-1534-1]]], named "Bones" by Ghost, is a bearded vulture with unusual coloration and one of the several animals that Ghost relies on to collect the souls of the dead. Bones only eats bones, and is disgusted by dead flesh of any sort that isn't bones; he only collects souls from decomposed or scavenged corpses that are reduced to the skeleton, and leaves the others for one of the other soul-collecting animals.

He's one of Ghost's favorites, but don't tell the others that.
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="      ◾  SCP-2744" hide="      ◾  The Spectre"]]
[[[SCP-2744]]] isn't much else beyond what one sees of it, a black cat that exists physically only as long as its sheet stays draped over it. Whatever is underneath is impossible to perceive, only whatever the cat chooses to express out into the physical world; its eyes, its tail, and its ears. Some features are drawn on, like paws and whiskers and nose, mimicries of what the real thing underneath is. It also doesn't like water and repels rain from falling on it, just like a real //teru teru bōzu//.

It's a direct representation of the author, yes, but the author would rather let you analyze it yourself.
