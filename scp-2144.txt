**Item #:** SCP-2144

 **Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2144 is to be kept in an open-air enclosure at Site-37. The walls surrounding said enclosure are to have windows built in and a gatehouse built along the walls is to serve as the access point. Once per month, the enclosure's structural integrity is to be inspected by a containment engineer. If any damage to the enclosure is identified, a containment engineer is to repair said damage.

An observation post is to be established along the perimeter of the enclosure, with transceivers placed in each post. At all times, a guard is to be stationed in the observation post to watch over SCP-2144. An auxiliary group of up to 3 guards are to be put on standby, in case the assigned guard is unavailable for observation duty. Guards on duty are to rotate in shifts of 2 hours apiece; see Document 2144-Ø for observation duty schedule. At the beginning of each shift, the guard on duty is to acknowledge SCP-2144's presence via transceiver.  

If SCP-2144 is required to be transported from the enclosure, it is to be placed in a hermetically-sealed container with radiation shielding and an air pump installed. One side of the container is to be transparent, such that SCP-2144 may be observed by personnel. An electrocardiogram (ECG) and automated defibrillator are to be attached to SCP-2144, with the defibrillator set to activate when its heart rate is below 30 bpm. If defibrillation fails to increase heart rate, voltage may be increased. Personnel handling SCP-2144 are to wear Class A Hazmat suits. 

Prior to opening the container, the pre-installed air pump is to be activated to remove hydrogen cyanide (HCN) present in the container. Canisters filled with HCN are to be disposed of as per standard non-anomalous waste disposal protocols.

SCP-2144 is to be kept in a modified Size-S animal containment cell at Site-37, equipped with hermetically-sealed walls, radiation shielding and an air pump. A surveillance camera is to be set up to observe SCP-2144, and a transparent glass window is placed to allow direct observation of SCP-2144. An ECG and automated defibrillator are to be attached to SCP-2144, with the defibrillator set to activate when its heart rate is  below 30 bpm. If heart rate fails to increase after defibrillation, voltage may be increased and research staff assigned to SCP-2144 are to be notified immediately. 

Once per week, an inspection team is to ensure the structural integrity of the cell. Any signs of damage are to be repaired immediately. Prior to opening the cell, all personnel handling SCP-2144 or the cell are to wear Class A Hazmat suits and the air pump is to be activated to remove HCN present in the cell.

When not in the cell, SCP-2144 is to be placed in a hermetically-sealed container with an air pump pre-installed and radiation shielding. The ECG and automated defibrillator are to remain attached to SCP-2144. One side of the container is to be transparent, such that SCP-2144 may be observed. Prior to opening the container, the pre-installed air pump is to be activated to remove HCN present in the container. Canisters filled with HCN are to be disposed of as per standard non-anomalous waste disposal protocols.

**Description:** SCP-2144 is a quadrupedal creature, resembling a specimen of //Felis catus// (domestic cat). It stands at about 25 cm in height, and its head-to-tail length is about 80 cm. SCP-2144 does not possess a reproductive system, and there are no signs of neutering performed on it. Only humans are capable of interacting with SCP-2144; other animal species (including //F. catus//) are unable to detect or recognise SCP-2144's existence. 

SCP-2144 exhibits different anomalous properties based on it being in an open space or an enclosed space. [[footnote]] Defined as systems enclosed by walls or similar structures in the 4 general directions and directly above. Said space would no longer be considered "enclosed" if there is at least 1 open aperture present in the boundaries whereby SCP-2144 can move through. [[/footnote]]

While SCP-2144 is in an open space, it is animate despite lacking a heartbeat. In addition, it also does not require nutrients or respiration. In this state, SCP-2144 can only be perceived via direct observation by a human. Its image cannot be captured on photographs or video, requiring direct observation to perceive it. Similarly, sounds produced by it can only be heard directly by a human observer and are unable to be recorded. SCP-2144's mass is unable to be measured; weighing scales regularly register its mass as 0.0 kg. However, personnel who had held SCP-2144 estimates it to weigh about 2 to 5 kg. 

In terms of behaviour, SCP-2144 is shown to be lively while in an open space and typically moves about whenever it can. It also tends to avoid approaching any doors, windows or similar openings in the vicinity. Thus, SCP-2144 shows a level of resistance towards attempts to place it in containers or cells. 

When SCP-2144 is in an enclosed space, it ceases all movement and remains immobile until it is removed from the space. Its heartbeat can only be detected under such a state, along with signs of respiration. Notably, its heart rate usually starts at about 200 bpm and slowly declines over time. Estimations suggest that it takes about 48 hours for asystole to occur. Furthermore, SCP-2144's image and sounds can only be photographed and recorded in this state. Its mass can also be recorded as well, although measurements are inconsistent and ranges from 1.9 kg up to 5.2 kg.  

During this state, trace amounts of beta particles and gamma radiation are detected within the enclosed space. Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is also spontaneously generated within the enclosed space via transmutation. The ionising radiation produced aids in the the formation of HCN. HCN samples taken record a concentration of approximately 300 mg/m^^3^^, which is capable of killing an average human within 10 – 60 min. SCP-2144 is resistant to the toxic effects of HCN. Generation of HCN ceases when SCP-2144 is removed from the enclosed space.  

SCP-2144 was first found in the residence of Jason Schmidt [[footnote]] A teaching assistant affiliated with Humboldt University of Berlin's Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences I (Biology, Chemistry, Physics). [[/footnote]] in Berlin, Germany on ██/██/2003, where said individual had died of cyanide poisoning. Hydrogen cyanide and gamma radiation were detected from within his residence. SCP-2144 was also present at the scene, and was initially believed to be dead. Its anomalous properties were revealed when it resumes motion when taken out of the residence. Foundation agents subsequently recovered SCP-2144, and began containment of it. A cover story of a murder attempt on Schmidt was disseminated to the Berlin Police, and his residence was decontaminated afterwards. 

**Addendum 2144-1:** Background checks and interviews with associates reveal that Jason Schmidt is capable of lucid dreaming and has a habit to record details of his dreams. Below is a selection of entries from Schmidt's collection of dream diaries, translated from German.

> I've dreamt of Mel. [[footnote]] Interviews with Schmidt's peers and family claim no knowledge of any individual referred to as "Mel". All known references to "Mel" are contained in Schmidt's dream diaries. [[/footnote]] Setting was at a classroom, and I was standing behind the board. She wanted to know more about the tutorials I had today. Told her about Schrödinger's Cat, which I had discussed with the class earlier today. Mel did not understand me – maybe I have not explained it well enough to begin with. She took the experiment literally, despite my efforts to correct her. 
> 
> Perhaps it is fitting: a figment of thoughts would naturally perceive a thought experiment literally. But I digress – I ought to check if my students can comprehend the tutorial material given to them.

> Mel appeared again. Just as before, setting was at a classroom. This time, however, Mel was the one behind the board. Lights were broken. She was still talking about Schrödinger's Cat rather vividly, especially about how such a scenario may occur. No, not scenario. She envisioned it as a creature, a living thing. Told her again that it is only a thought experiment, that no one ever conducted such an experiment. 
> 
> Mel berated me on my narrow-mindedness and not opening up to potential. Perhaps I should listen to my students more often? Told me that any idea, not matter how flawed they are, can come true. She was quite insistent on it. As she spoke, the lights flickered and were no longer broken in the end. On the board were the words "Eureka", in English. That did not appear when the dream started.

> Mel popped by my dreams again. Setting was in a garden inside a valley; all the flowers there were blooming. Mel looked different; she seemed to have gained some weight around the belly.
> 
> Mel spoke about a surprise, that all ideas have a place in reality and she will prove it. Told me that I should be expecting in due time, that I will see it soon - the fruits of our labour, whatever it is. Perhaps it is the results of my successful tutelage?

**Addendum 2144-2:** Attempts to defibrillate SCP-2144 are noted to be increasingly difficult with each attempt. Thus far, higher voltages have been utilised successively to prevent asystole. Dr. Wolfgang hypothesises that SCP-2144 may be adapting to electric shocks applied on it. 

**Addendum 2144-3:** As of ██/██/2003, SCP-2144's Special Containment Procedures have been revised. Dr. Wolfgang has issued the following memorandum in regards to this update. 

> I'll be frank – the pre-existing measure of defibrillating SCP-2144 is not as effective as before. Sure we have been increasing the voltage to bypass that, but there's a limit as to how far we can go. There may come a point where a significantly high voltage will electrocute SCP-2144 or we're forced to have it flatline. It's between a rock and a hard place, so we have to take a third option. 
> 
> As such, we're going to change SCP-2144's living space – give it a little breathing space. Outside the box, it is not inherently dangerous. There is little worry for SCP-2144 escaping; it instinctively avoids all doors and windows, perhaps thinking that another enclosed space is behind those doors and windows. It clearly does not like being locked in a box; after all, ideas are meant to roam free. And this creature is an idea – a flawed one, but one nonetheless.
