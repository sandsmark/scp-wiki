title:Surprise! Happy Birthday! Again.
[!--

THIS IS AWESOME, TROY! HOW DO I ADD MY OWN!?!?!?

Well, that's simple, Mr. Person Editing This Page.

Toss in a collapsible. Give us the name of your creepy pasta and your name as the "show", and put in a special birthday message as the "hide."  Make sure you put in a line break.

Have fun, guys! And enjoy Gears Day!

> Well, well, well... What have we here?
> You've managed to survive yet another year?
> A year of work, of screaming children,
> A year of delving into things unbidden.
> Oh? What's that? We shouldn't know?
> All those terrible things you didn't show?
> Of course we do. We are your friends.
> Confidants. Allies. And more again.
> We know the stories, even those you don't tell.
> You see Gears... You give us our visions of hell.
> 
> Happy Birthday, oh Leader of men. We come to you again. Bearing tales. Tales of the third side of the mirror. Tales of the taste of the air when a child is screaming in sorrow. Happy tales. Sad tales. Tales if games that eat your mind. Tales of books that give you a black brilliance, the kind that gives answers, but only the kind without comfort. Tales of the song you hear when you sleep, but not when you wake again. Tales of the righteous throne of terrible glory. Tales about tales. Tales about you. Tales about us.
> 
> Some of them are even true.
>
> Happy birthday...! And many more.

It's coming for me. I try to hide, I run and do my best to avoid it. But it is a patient predator, and I know that with time, it will catch me. 

I can evade it for now. I still have to find a way to fix things. But I don't have long. 

It has begun to consume my parents, my wife, one of my siblings...none of them even realized the end had come for them. Now it has begun, and they are all doomed.

I can see it, I know what it is doing. I have to stop it before it consumes the rest my family, my friends, my children....hell, the entire human race.

But it can see me. It knows what I am doing too. I am next. And it is laughing.

It knows it has found me, it mocks my futile attempts to escape, following my every move. And once it begins its work, it will never stop until I am dead. 

It will decay my body slowly and painfully, withering my skin, tainting my hair, weakening my bones. It will rob me of my ability to run, to walk, to think, to breathe. It will slowly rob me of my sanity and my life, and all the while the world will think it normal, simply because they are used to it. Why do none of them ever think to look....

It is a predator. It found us on this world, and latched onto us. Ancient scriptures tell of the men it first began to affect, draining them of their eternal youth, unnaturally ending their lives. They invented other excuses for it, not knowing what was happening to them.

It grows more powerful every year. It has learned to begin younger, ever younger. Once you turn 30, it is too late. It has you.

But I still have time.

The light was out. It was her worst dream, having the light be out. They always came for her in the dark. The monsters, the bad men, the creatures who hated her. She waited for them, shivering, her eyes closed, as she felt the harsh, warm breath on her bare ankles.

They called her name, from the shadows. She crossed her legs, then pulled them under her, trying not to let tears drift down her face. Gentle, sharp claws traced indelicate patterns across her arms, no matter where she put them. She wouldn't call out. Not this time. She would be brave. She would be strong!

She would bite her lip to keep from screaming when a tentacle crawled across her leg. No. She had to call out. She had to call:

"DADDDDDDDEEEE!"

Andrew rushed to his daughters bedroom. Only two and she had such horrible nightmares. He flicked the light on when he came in the room, and scooped his little girl into his arms. "Aw, lookit that, your nightlight burnt out! Don't worry little lady, Daddy will leave the door open." After a couple of minutes reassuring her, he set her back in her bed, and walked back to his own bed.

He lay down, sighing at the imagination on his daughter, and turned off the light.

The last thing he thought before he fell asleep was to wonder what was slithering across his feet…
