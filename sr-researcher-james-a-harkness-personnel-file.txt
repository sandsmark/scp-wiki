= BASIC INFORMATION

------

**Name:** Sr. Researcher James A. Harkness ("Billith")

**Clearance Level:** 4

**Current Assignment:** {{[DATA REDACTED PER O5 REQUEST]}}

**Biography:** Born 31 July 1979 in Hoboken, NJ, Sr. Researcher James Harkness was recruited out of university by the Foundation during their 1999 campaign for members of the then-fledgling Mobile Task Force Rho-9 ("Technical Support")[[footnote]] Whether or not this campaign was related to Y2K remains unknown. [[/footnote]]. Since then, he has been working closely with [[[scp-3959|technology and information-based SCPs]]].

During routine evaluations, it was deduced that Harkness possesses a high cognitohazard resistance and therefore has been utilized with study of several powerful cognition-affecting SCPs in his 18 years of service. He currently resides in Site-34's personnel lodge.
