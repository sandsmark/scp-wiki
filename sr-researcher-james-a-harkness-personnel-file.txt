= BASIC INFORMATION

------

**Name:** Sr. Researcher James A. Harkness ("TheBillith")

**Clearance Level:** 4

**Current Assignment:** {{[DATA REDACTED PER O5 REQUEST]}}

**Biography:** Born 31 July 1979 in Hoboken, NJ, Sr. Researcher James Harkness was recruited out of university by the Foundation during their 1999 campaign for members of the then-fledgling Mobile Task Force Rho-9 ("Technical Support")[[footnote]] Whether or not this campaign was related to Y2K remains unknown. [[/footnote]]. Since then, he has been working closely with [[[scp-3959|technology and information-based SCPs]]].

During routine evaluations, it was deduced that Harkness possesses a high cognitohazard resistance and therefore has been utilized with study of several powerful cognition-affecting SCPs in his 18 years of service. He currently resides in Site-34's personnel lodge.

* **[[[SCP-2853|SCP-2853]]]**: From Dust to Dawn

[[span style="color:gray"]]//For approximately twenty minutes per day, the front and back doors of SCP-2853 unlock and open via an anomalous means. The doors will close and reseal themselves after this interval has passed.//[[/span]]

* **[[[SCP-3330|SCP-3330]]]**: Etudes for the Universe

[[span style="color:gray"]]//Sound waves performed synchronously as described within the parameters of the sheet music have a minor reality-warping effect, the strength of which is amplified the longer the pieces are played without error.//[[/span]]


* **[[[SCP-3959|SCP-3959]]]**: The End of All Knowledge

[[span style="color:gray"]]//It is assumed that SCP-3959 is able to freely access and travel through the internet if it is available. Therefore, Site-01's servers must be located on an off-grid private server network. Encryption and tight restriction of information going in and out of Site-01 has successfully deterred SCP-3959 from breaching Foundation servers any further.//[[/span]]
