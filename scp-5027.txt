**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5027 is contained within a high-security humanoid containment chamber at Site-64. The chamber is isolated from adjoining containment cells and utility lines on Site-64 to prevent the spread of SCP-5027's effects. 

Two Scranton Reality Anchors ([[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3001 |SRA]]]) are installed below the chamber. If one or more of the SRAs fail, repair or replacement of the devices is designated as a Level 5 priority and Site-64 is to enter lockdown until containment measures have been reestablished. 

Personnel are not permitted to enter SCP-5027's containment chamber at any time. Direct physical contact with SCP-5027 is strictly forbidden. Requests by SCP-5027 are to be sent to Dr. Williams for processing.

**Description:** SCP-5027 is a male Caucasian humanoid[[footnote]] Further details, such as its weight and height, cannot be accurately determined due to SCP-5027's anomalous effects. [[/footnote]] who claims to be a 27-year-old male individual named "[REDACTED]" residing in Bayard, Saskatchewan. Scans in the public database reveal that [REDACTED] was officially declared deceased after a head-on collision with an intoxicated driver on 05/17/1997. 

SCP-5027 is in a permanent state of quantum superposition.[[footnote]] As a result, SCP-5027 appears to be both alive and dead simultaneously. [[/footnote]] Contrary to current theories of quantum superposition, SCP-5027 does not settle into any of its states when observed. SCP-5027 claims to have no memory of how it obtained its anomalous properties; research is ongoing to determine the cause of this.

SCP-5027 appears in two positions simultaneously, where its living state is standing upright while its lower limbs are phased into its deceased state which lies on the floor. Observers report decomposed tissue on SCP-5027's body phasing into its healthy counterpart. After prolonged observations of SCP-5027, observers often experience confusion, aggravation, and mild headaches.[[footnote]] This is a result of human perception limits, not anomalous effects.[[/footnote]] 

When SCP-5027 makes direct contact with objects or living organisms, they will enter a permanent state of quantum superposition. SCP-5027's effect does not affect any inert elements such as soil, rock, or wood.[[footnote]]These elements remain unaffected by SCP-5027 unless they have undergone a physical or chemical process that leaves the product with two or more possible states.[[/footnote]] Affected inanimate objects are able to transmit SCP-5027's effect to other objects and lifeforms through direct physical contact. Affected lifeforms, however, are unable to transmit SCP-5027's effect further and will remain in a state of quantum superposition, expiring after an hour has elapsed.

caption=//Fig. 1:// D-1034 shortly after making direct contact with SCP-5027. The photo was taken prior to subject resting in a deceased state.]]

Activating an SRA near an affected inanimate object will nullify all anomalous effects[[footnote]] Which state that object comes to rest in is random and uncontrolled.[[/footnote]] as long as it remains within the object's surroundings. If the SRA is deactivated or removed from the area, SCP-5027's effect re-manifests in said object. For unknown reasons, all animate lifeforms affected by SCP-5027 remain in their state of quantum superposition in the vicinity of an SRA.[[footnote]] Unaffected lifeforms in the presence of an SRA remain able to become affected by SCP-5027. [[/footnote]]

------

**Discovery and Containment:** On 09/14/1998, several news reports arose from the town of Birch River, Saskatchewan, with eyewitness statements testifying an abnormal sighting of multiple intact infrastructures phasing into collapsed debris below. Due to the media's poor understanding of such anomalies, Foundation intervention was able to be kept minimal.[[footnote]] Several similar, isolated anomalies were previously discovered and contained by the Foundation in late 1998 and early 1999, though at the time they were not attributed to SCP-5027. [[/footnote]] Foundation agents were dispatched from Regina, Saskatchewan to implement necessary measures for information suppression and falsification, as well as the initiation of a covert operation to investigate the cause behind the event. During the missions, two agents initiated direct physical contact with affected infrastructures, resulting in their eventual expiration.

At this time, SCP-5027 approached the unaffected agents and warned them of its effects. SCP-5027's body language exhibited signs of emotional distress and confusion, though it made no explicit acts of hostility towards the agents. Suspecting reality disturbances as a possible cause for the event, Dr. Hart of Hume Research was contacted. The use of an SRA to reverse all anomalous activity in the town was suggested. As such, an MTF unit was dispatched from the nearby Site-31 to the area with two portable SRAs while Foundation agents directed traffic away from the town and maintained visual contact with SCP-5027.

After the installation of the SRAs to reverse the effects, all civilians in the town were amnesticized and all news reports were amended as part of a disinformation campaign. During the transfer of SCP-5027 to Site-31, one MTF member initiated direct physical contact with SCP-5027. On-site guards misinterpreted this as an act of hostility by SCP-5027 and threatened it before the MTF unit was able to intervene. SCP-5027 subsequently entered a manic state and refused to comply with instructions. Dr. Prash, a researcher in Site-31, has volunteered to be assigned to SCP-5027.

> 
> **Dr. Prash:** Thank you. Can you explain your... appearance? Sorry, but my eyes strain whenever I look at you. It's like I'm seeing double...
> 
> **SCP-5027:** I really don't know what's going on Dr. Prash. Whenever I look down, I see my own corpse. I know I sound crazy but I see my own legs... Like my actual living legs. They go straight through my corpse on the floor and no matter where I go my own dead body will always be there right below me. I don't think I'm alright...

> **Dr. Prash:** Thank you. Is there anything else you know about your condition?
> 
> **SCP-5027:** Well.... Whenever I touch something, I infect it with whatever I have.

> **SCP-5027:** It was dark and wet. It reeked like dirt and rotten wood, and I couldn't move. I tried to yell for help but I couldn't even move my lips. That's when I realized that I couldn't breathe and I started to panic. I thought it was a nightmare when I woke up, but then I realized I was laying in the middle of a graveyard... On a grave...
> 
> **Dr. Prash:** What graveyard? And whose grave was it?
> 
> **SCP-5027:** The one in Bayard, and no idea. I stood up and started running home. I'd never been so afraid in my life.
> 
> **Dr. Prash:** I thought you couldn't remember anything. How did you remember your home address?
> 
> **SCP-5027:** I had a wallet in my pocket and it had my license in it. I memorized the address, my name, and my birthday before it got ruined.

> **Dr. Prash:** Ruined? Do you still have the wallet or the card?
> 
> **SCP-5027:** No, sorry. I threw them away when whatever disease I have infected them.

I keep it on me because sometimes the ink is visible just long enough for me to see someone in the picture. I'm not sure who it is but they look familiar.

Two plainclothes agents were dispatched to the address given by SCP-5027 in order to gather more information, make contact with the individual mentioned by it, and to discover leads into the origin of SCP-5027's anomalous properties. Upon arrival, the agents reported to Site-31 that the entire city of Bayard was "flickering in and out of existence". When asked to clarify, the agents went on to describe several anomalous effects that corresponded with the secondary effects of SCP-5027. The agents were directed to return to Site-31. The wallet and license card mentioned by SCP-5027 are assumed to have been destroyed during a previous incident on 09/02/1998 near the same location involving the manifestation and spread of SCP-5027's secondary effects. At the time, the anomaly was not attributed to SCP-5027 and was successfully isolated and contained.

[[collapsible show="+ City of Bayard Incident Log" hide="- Hide Incident Log"]]

A Mobile Task Force was briefed on the situation and tasked with locating the address given by SCP-5027 in addition to making contact with the individual mentioned by SCP-5027. The task force was equipped with several portable SRAs for use during the mission. Upon activation of the SRAs within Bayard, all contact with MTF-5027 was lost.

A recovery team was dispatched to Bayard to gather intel and re-establish contact with MTF-5027. Upon arrival, they reported that there was only an open field on the land where the city was supposed to be. The field was littered with several active SRAs, dead plant matter, and thousands of desiccated corpses, including the entirety of MTF-5027.

Analysis of the materials gathered by the recovery team revealed all samples to be non-anomalous. Reality Expert Dr. Scranton reviewed the video and audio logs of MTF-5027 and concluded that SCP-5027's testified place of residence was affected, and that its effects were transmitted to nearby infrastructures through utility lines. Dr. Scranton further theorized that while individual buildings may have been caught in a perpetual state of disrepair, the city as a whole had been caught between states of existence and non-existence. Upon activation of the six portable SRAs by MTF-5027, the city of Bayard came to rest in a state of non-existence. 

Because the city of Bayard had completely ceased to exist, Dr. Scranton hypothesized that the deactivation of the SRAs would not result in the reappearance of the city. Testing procedures based on this information were outlined by Dr. Prash and approved by O5-██ and O5-██. On 09/16/1998,  the SRAs were deactivated. No changes to the area were recordable. A cover story was fabricated claiming the city to be a fictitious entry created in order to combat map piracy. All relatives of the previous residents of Bayard are to be amnesticized as soon as possible.

**Incident 5027-31-F:** On 01/28/1999, the SRA below SCP-5027's chamber was rendered inactive due to mechanical failure. SCP-5027's effect spread to its chamber walls, subsequently affecting the entirety of Site-31. As a result, most of Site-31, including Dr. Prash, was deemed irrecoverable. Agents from the nearby Site-64 responded to several critical connections between the two sites going dark and discovered SCP-5027 unharmed. SCP-5027 was successfully re-contained at Site-64 where current containment measures continue to be enforced.

Throughout its confinement, SCP-5027 remained in distress and attempted to inflict self-harm[[footnote]] This involved SCP-5027 repeatedly hitting its head on the wall. [[/footnote]] to no avail. SCP-5027 eventually stopped after verbal intervention and remained in a fetal position. On 02/10/1999, SCP-5027 demanded the provision of basic necessities. Dr. Williams denied this request on the basis that objects in SCP-5027's presence become unpredictable in a breach scenario. SCP-5027 remained unresponsive to all verbal prompts by on-site staff.

**Incident 5027-64-B:**  On 02/14/1999, SCP-5027 was discovered hanging from its containment chamber ceiling via a standard Foundation blanket that had been fashioned into a noose. SCP-5027 was fully conscious and vocalized several crying noises. Foundation guards cut the blanket while ensuring no physical contact was made with the subject. The blanket was removed from SCP-5027's possession and incinerated. Dr. Williams organized a post-incident interview for the following morning.

SCP-5027 once again became unresponsive and refused to participate further in the interview. Dr. Williams submitted a request to assign a Foundation therapist to SCP-5027 to address its rapidly declining mental state and uncooperative nature with Foundation staff. Analysis of security footage within SCP-5027's cell during the night of the incident failed to show who gave SCP-5027 the blanket; a single bare arm can be seen at 10:32 PM entering the frame from off-screen, though the identity of this person is currently unknown.

On 02/17/1999, Foundation therapist Dr. Joy was assigned to SCP-5027 by Dr. Williams for twice-weekly sessions with it, conducted through the loudspeaker. An introductory interview between Dr. Joy and SCP-5027 was arranged.

> 
> **Dr. Joy:** Ever? I'm jealous.
> 
> //SCP-5027 smirks.//
> 
> **Dr. Joy:** Any favorite foods? 
> 
> **SCP-5027:** Dunno. Can't remember the last time I ate anything.

> 
> //Dr. Williams prompts Dr. Joy to redirect the conversation.//
> 
> **Dr. Joy:** Look, [REDACTED]. You're affected by something that scares you. Hell, it even scares us but that won't stop us from finding out what this is.
> 
> **SCP-5027:** I- I guess. It's just... so many people. The last place I was at...
> 
> //SCP-5027 begins to hyperventilate and displays precursors of a panic attack.//
> 
> **Dr. Joy:** Deep breaths. That wasn't your fault. 
> 
> **SCP-5027:** Yes it was. Hundreds of people died because of me. Dr. Prash too... There are all the times from before you guys found me. I don't even know how many people I've-
> 
> **Dr. Joy:** We're able to help you. You're the one who wanted help, remember?
> 
> **SCP-5027:** I thought so. Now that I know help means locking me in a room without so much as a fucking blanket, I'm not so sure I want it anymore.
> 
> **Dr. Joy:** Is that why you tried ending your life, [REDACTED]? 
> 
> **SCP-5027:**...Sure. If you can call it a life.
 
At this point, SCP-5027 became unresponsive and would no longer cooperate with staff. Dr. Joy notified SCP-5027 that she would return in three days. Dr. Joy had also completed a post-interview report, as attached below.

> Date of Interview: 02/17/1999
> Date of Report: 02/18/1999
> Subject: [REDACTED]'s Mental State
> 
> Based on my first interview with [REDACTED], it is clear that he is struggling with his mental health. I am requesting permission to prescribe sertraline at a dose of 50mg for one week to see if there is any improvement. In the meantime, I will continue my sessions with him.
> 
> - Dr. Joy, Foundation Therapist

On 02/18/1999, SCP-5027 was prescribed sertraline. Subsequent blood work after a week showed no levels of sertraline in SCP-5027's blood. Further prescriptions must be approved by Dr. Williams.

As per Foundation procedures outlined within Site-64's Policy Manual, all therapy sessions between Dr. Joy and SCP-5027 are automatically converted to a text transcription which is stored on SCP-5027's file for review. Additionally, Dr. Joy is required to complete a post-session summary at the conclusion of each session.

**Post-Session Summary:** I obviously need to spend more time working with [REDACTED] before forming a professional opinion but so far I think we've done more harm than good for him. I discovered that he likes music today - more specifically classic rock. I am requesting approval for music to be played at his request. I believe this will help improve his mental state as well as provide an avenue of entertainment. - Dr. Joy, Foundation Therapist

> 
> **SCP-5027:** I don't even know what a reality anchor is...

> **Dr. Joy:** I guess not. You miss the latest info session?

> //SCP-5027 appears very confused. Dr. Joy awkwardly clears her throat.//
> 
> **Dr. Joy:** And, uh, how are you feeling about past events? 
> 
> **SCP-5027:** I'm still struggling with it... I didn't mean to- 
> 
> **Dr. Joy:** I know, [REDACTED]. It's alright, we don't have to talk about it. 
> 
> **SCP-5027:** No, I'm ready. When I first saw what was happening to me I didn't know that it could spread. Everything I touched... I thought the world around me was falling apart. I realized I was the cause. I isolated myself. I went to Parkbeg and sat in the middle of a field for months.
> 
> **Dr. Joy:** Didn't our agents initially find you in Birch River? 
> 
> **SCP-5027:** Yeah. Started to feel my mind falling apart in that field. It's freaky how similar the wind is to whispering at night. I was too scared. I wanted help. I walked into town and that's when you guys picked me up. 
> 
> **Dr. Joy:** Were you aware of the effects you would have on the town when you entered it? 
> 
> **SCP-5027:** Yeah. I tried not to touch anything but it's a lot harder than it sounds. I caught my foot on a crack in the ground and accidentally leaned on a building to steady myself. It was just a reflex... Everyone started screaming...
> 
> **Dr. Joy:** I see, hence the state of the city when we arrived... I think that's all I need for today. You've been very helpful. 
> 
> **SCP-5027:** Hey... um, Rosa?
> 
> **Dr. Joy:** Yes? 
> 
> **SCP-5027:** When I was at the last facility, Dr. Prash had sent a team out to Bayard. I told them about someone who might've been my family. Do you know if they found them? 
> 
> **Dr. Joy:** I'm not aware but I will check for next time. 
> 
> **SCP-5027:** Thanks.

**Post-Session Summary:** [REDACTED]'s mental state appears to be improving, albeit slowly. I believe the addition of music to his routine has benefited him. He is visibly uncomfortable when recalling past events though the fact that he is discussing these at all shows progress. I looked into the results of Site-31's exploratory mission in the city of Bayard. It looks like they found the house that he told them about but the entire city was lost. I also managed to uncover a post-incident report detailing the identities of recovered bodies and the list doesn't have very many survivors. - Dr. Joy, Foundation Therapist

> //SCP-5027 becomes visibly upset at this point and refuses to participate in the session further. SCP-5027 lays motionless on its chamber floor with its eyes closed for the remainder of the day.//

**Post-Session Summary:** SCP-5027 displayed moderate signs of attachment towards a staff member today, expressing a desire to escape containment. SCP-5027 became uncooperative towards the end of the session and communication was terminated. - Dr. Joy, Foundation Therapist

//These notes are significantly closer to Foundation standards. I have made minor edits to remove personal bias from the summary. Please ensure your writing is non-biased and clinical. Otherwise, I am glad to see improvement in your notes, Dr. Joy.// - Dr. Williams

> 
> //Nearby posted guards rush to SCP-5027's containment chamber. Through the door, they observe SCP-5027 shouting for help while Dr. Joy sobs on the floor in a state of quantum superposition.//

> **SCP-5027:** Don't just fucking stare, help her!!
> 
> //SCP-5027 drags Dr. Joy towards its containment chamber door as she continues sobbing. He places her in front of it before kneeling beside her.
> 
> **SCP-5027:** I'm not going to do shit! Just help her!!
> 
> //SCP-5027 and Dr. Joy embrace each other while crying. Due to the nature of SCP-5027's secondary effects, responding guards are unable to make physical contact with Dr. Joy until she expires approximately 55 minutes later, at which point they recover her body. SCP-5027 does not interfere with the staff during the recovery procedure.//

**Post-Session Summary:** Since the death of Dr. Rosa Joy and the recovery of her body, SCP-5027 has become actively hostile towards Foundation staff. SCP-5027 has attempted to initiate physical contact with any person who enters its chamber. SCP-5027 has not responded to staff over the loudspeaker though it will rarely request for music (specifically, Living on a Prayer by Bon Jovi). SCP-5027 is often observed lying unresponsive on the floor with its eyes closed for most of the day. SCP-5027 has not attempted to breach containment.

Dr. Joy's body was transferred to Site-64's morgue where an autopsy was performed. Results showed a significant amount of alcohol within her system at her time of death and several areas of heavy decay on her body, though no anomalous properties were able to be detected. The body remains in Cold Storage Locker 52-A. - Dr. Williams

//In light of the death of Dr. Joy, I have taken the liberty of completing a post-session summary above. This will be the last session of therapy to be held with SCP-5027 indefinitely. In addition to this, I am also requesting that further testing is performed on SCP-5027 in regard to its apparent immunity to death. Such information could prove to be an extremely valuable asset to the Foundation.// - Dr. Williams

//Testing approved.// - O5-██, O5-██, O5-██
