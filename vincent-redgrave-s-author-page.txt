Vincent_Redgrave is a 20-something year old aspiring illustrator, writer, and Fantasy/Sci-Fi (Particularly in the Steampunk subgenre) fan. He is currently studying Marketing and Graphic Design somewhere deep in the dark recesses of the South-Eastern United States. Vince also has a [http://vincent-redgrave.tumblr.com/ Tumblr Page] he never looks at or uses ever since he created it, A [http://vincentredgrave.deviantart.com/ Deviant Art page] that likewise gets updated rarely, and dabbles in other sites *coughcoughGaiacoughcough* as well, under the same name. His inbox is always open for tale or SCP drafts, as he loves to read... though it may take him a few days to get back to you... and he is almost always on #site19 under the names VincentRedgrave or Vince|Mobile or Vince|*insert current activity*. Look him up if you want someone to --laugh at-- talk to or get some feedback on whatever you have. 

His works for the SCP Foundation are as follows:
