Vince also has a [http://vincentredgrave.deviantart.com/ Deviant Art page] that gets updated very rarely, and dabbles in other sites *coughcoughGaiaOnlinecoughcough* as well, under the same name. His inbox is always open for tale or SCP drafts, as he loves to read... though it may take him a few days to get back to you... and he is almost always on #site19 under the names Vince, Vince|Mobile, or Vince|*insert current activity*. Look him up if you want someone to talk to or get some feedback on whatever you have. Also, you can find him through the official SCP Foundation Facebook and Tumblr pages (links in the sidebar), where he'll gladly answer any questions you may have in relation to the foundation, or else just check out all the cool skips and tales that he wants to introduce you to. Go check them out!

His works for the SCP Foundation are as follows:

**__SCPs__:**
* [[[SCP-1541]]] - A forgotten alcoholic god of euphoria gets drunk and tries to text up some new followers.
* [[[SCP-1641]]] - Butterflies that breed explosively, in several different ways, and the budding sorcerer who made them.
* [[[SCP-1810]]] - An otherworldly French babysitter just wants to go home. Oh, and he is a //terrible// chef.
* [[[SCP-1910]]] - A bunch of hippies learn why you should never mix drugs and magic, and that "becoming one with nature" isn't that wonderful. 

**__Foundation Tales__:**

**__The Dark Fables__**

This series of tales takes place in a Foundation'verse where all the myths are true, and most of them are dying. In a last ditch effort to save himself, the ancient Greek god of wealth and ruler of the underworld, Hades, known to the modern world as "Mr. Dark," of Marshall, Carter, and Dark, Ltd. goes on a quest to consolidate and amplify his power. Currently working on rewriting the first tale before proceeding.
