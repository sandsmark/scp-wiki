**Item #:** SCP-432

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** No special containment procedures are required for SCP-432, save that is to be locked at all times and the key to the lock kept in the adjacent security station under guard by three (3) Level 3 Personnel.

**Description:** SCP-432 is a 2.5-meter tall cabinet, apparently constructed from slightly rusted and age-tarnished steel. The cabinet measures 2 meters wide by 2 meters deep, with a simple inward-opening door located on one side. The door is fitted with a basic slide-bolt and a hasp for a padlock, allowing the door to be secured from outside. The exterior of SCP-432 has no unremarkable features except small spots of corrosion and light scratching commensurate with being left exposed to the elements for a prolonged period of time.

The interior dimensions of SCP-432 display alarming disparity with the exterior, however. A person stepping through the door will find themselves in a corridor constructed from the same aged and rusted steel as the outside of SCP-432, and adhering to the same height and width scales (2.5m high by 2m wide), but leading into a vast maze of similar rusted metal tunnels.

The exact size of the metal labyrinth within SCP-432 cannot be accurately measured, as each time the door is opened it leads into an apparently different section of the maze. As long as the door remains open, and the persons within the maze remember the route back, escape is possible. If the door is closed, even for a second, upon reopening the entrance will have moved to a different section of the maze. The fate of personnel within the maze when the door is closed is unknown. GPS units used within SCP-432 are rendered useless, as they show the user's location to be [DATA EXPUNGED]

The tunnels of the maze are lit at irregular intervals by what appear to be regular household lightbulbs, secured to the walls in wire mesh fittings. Many of the bulbs observed flickered as if at the end of their life, and numerous others are burned out or broken. In places several large-gauge steel pipes have been found bolted to the walls of the tunnels. These pipes are cold to the touch and sounds from within suggest water flowing through them. In places the pipes are in obvious need of repair and drip very cold, stale water. Analysis of this water has revealed [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Additional notes:** SCP-432 was discovered in an abandoned industrial complex in ██████, UK. It came to the attention of the foundation after Dr █████ heard reports of several homeless in the area disappearing after staying in the complex. Investigating, Dr █████ discovered the cabinet at the centre of an abandoned steel mill, surrounded by a number of sleeping bags, bags of clothing, shopping trolleys and other personal effects, suggesting a number of homeless persons had recently made camp there. SCP-432 was unlocked, but the door closed upon discovery. After exploring the immediate area beyond the entrance, Dr █████ left the maze and summoned Foundation personnel to transport the cabinet to a secure location.

Currently █ expeditions have been sent into SCP-432 to attempt to chart its internal geography. To date ██ D-class personnel have been lost within the maze. No further expeditions may be made without express permission by of least two (2) Level 4 Personnel.

**Expeditions:**
Below are the expeditions within SCP-432 to date.
The standard agreed mission equipment pack, agreed by Dr █████ and Dr ████████, is:

One (1) hand-torch with a three (3) hours lifespan and additional power sources providing up to six (6) additional hours
One (1) headset microphone linked to control
One (1) shoulder-mounted video unit set for wireless transmission
Two (2) 0.5L bottles of water
Two (2) high-calorie energy bars
Eight (8) sticks of luminous marker chalk
