----
[[span class="scp-showcase"]]--SCP-2641: Before the Fire-- **[DELETED]**[[/span]]

[[collapsible show="     + Learn more?" hide="- Close excerpt" hideLocation="bottom"]]
**Summary:** SCP-2641 is an ancient sapient concept that prefers to live inside literary media.

Persons exposed to these media become a conduit, connecting 2641 with the outside world.  2641 makes objects act tangentially to the way they're supposed to, in a very surreal manner. When it spreads into a new medium, it gains more power. When 2641 connects with enough media, people, and objects, it slowly regains its lost reality-bending properties.

This article gets a bit insane, featuring a dense rainforest, mysterious cult contained by the Brazilian government, exploding spears, a father wishing to save his daughter, and exiled denizen from Plato's World of Forms. That sort of thing. 

**Commentary:** SCP-2641 was my 1st SCP, written in April 2017 following the SCP-3000 "Horror" Contest.

2641 was very much an experiment. I wanted to write an SCP that was contained within its own documentation. I wanted to be able to justify why the Foundation would even do such a thing. And I wanted to show that there was something very not right going on behind the scenes. I don't think I was the most successful in doing these three things, but at the time, I was happy with how the article turned out.

The idea began with "what if objects didn't act like they were supposed to, and instead acted the opposite of that?" It took a lot of writing and rewriting to make that idea make sense. Some people are still confused to this day, so I clearly haven't done the best job of explaining it.

**UPDATE:** I self-deleted this article in mid-2018 because I was unhappy with how it performed over its long lifetime on the site (just over a year), and I didn't think I was a good enough author to execute it yet. Currently, it exists in an archived format, **[[[*http://scpdsandbox.wikidot.com/floppy-archive-1|which you can find here]]]**. 

One day I'll pick the concept back up -- I have a few ideas for that! -- but it won't be any time soon.

[[span class="scp-showcase"]][[[scp-3787|SCP-3787: The Horse Meme]]][[/span]]

[[collapsible show="     + Learn more?" hide="- Close excerpt" hideLocation="bottom"]]
**Summary:** A mysterious group of antimemetic equine entities is trying to give themselves some power on Earth. To counteract this, in what is perhaps the failed Deus Ex Machina of a drowsy god, horses have begun to breed 10 times more quickly, increasing the size of equine concepts in collective human headspace and making humans very afraid. This increase in "conceptual horseness" is effective in scaring away the Nighters, who fear the more powerful common Horse. 

Of course, the Foundation tries to contain this strange horse anomaly by slowing down horse birth rates. Not only do they start a mass horse die-off, but they also allow the Nighters to pour into our world to wreak havoc throughout North America.

This article has a lot of things packed into it, including an explanation for where modern-day mnestics come from, the SCP-2000 of horses, and crosslinks with a few different horse SCPs (intended to be a "Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse" sort of thing). It also features MTF-Pi-3 ("Glue Factory"), which battles antimemetic horse people with laser weapons, and is frankly //the coolest gosh darn thing ever.//

**Commentary:** SCP-3787 was my 2nd SCP, written in February 2018. 

It took me an awfully long time to come up with a second article. 3787 was far more ambitious than 2641, and I pitched it to people by calling it the "001 of horse anomalies". and was dubbed the "001 of Horse Anomalies" when I was pitching it to people. As with 2641, I was unhappy with the way I executed things, but I went back and touched it up considerably since. 

If you find that this article reads like I threw a bunch of horse anomalies into a blender, then I assure you: Mary Shelley's Horsenstein is //precisely// what I was looking for. Totally. I promise.

**Summary:** It's a lawnmower. Somehow, it ended up in a Baltimore suburb, quickly making the neighbourhood closer than it's ever been -- //quite literally// fusing a bunch of residents into a 5,000 kg flesh ball, perpetually mowing lawns. And they enjoy it.

**Commentary:** SCP-3719 was my 3rd SCP, written in March 2018. 

I'd say it has a very Series I tone. This speaks not to the quality of the SCP (I think it's interesting enough), but to how simple it is. I haven't much to talk about in terms of how I wrote it because, to be honest, it took me a few days to go from the beginning to the critique stage. I had wanted to write something like this for about a year now but could never figure out how until recently.

[[span class="scp-showcase"]][[[scp-3309|SCP-3309: Where We Go When We Fade, Fade Away]]][[/span]]

[[collapsible show="     + Learn more?" hide="- Close excerpt" hideLocation="bottom"]]
**Summary:** The Foundation classifies coldposts as a legitimate in-universe concept. When they learn that they can //delete// these coldposts -- as staff must do to their out-of-universe counterparts -- they do so with extreme prejudice and imprecision. This causes everything to go wrong.

**Commentary:** SCP-3309 was my 4th SCP and 1st collab, written in April 2018. I co-wrote it with [[*user PhamtomGuy]] in April 2018. This was both my 1st format screw and 1st attempt at a meta article.

3309 is a bit of a strange article for me. I'm not exactly a fan of meta articles myself unless they're done competently. And I don't actually think the work I put into 3309 is enough to consider it a well-done meta article. 3309 is an ambitious story, and ambitious stories require ambitious writing. I do believe I put in decent writing, but not enough to allow for all its parts to flow smoothly. Suffice to say, I don't think there's enough here for me to be satisfied with my writing. Maybe the concept needs work; maybe it relies too much on a gimmick; maybe it's both.

Of course, as a collaborative article, there comes a point where both parties must agree to take the middle path and be happy with the work they've put in, respective of one another's writing ability. To my co-writer, it may seem as though we kept this article on the burner for long enough and that it needed to be posted, and the votes certainly seem to display a job well done (note: I don't necessarily believe that votes = a good article, either. 3309 is //very// controversial -- especially among site contributors -- but ended up doing incredibly well). But there will always be something in me that isn't happy with the work I put in, and I guess that might never change.

Altogether, 3309 was a learning experience, and I hope I'm able to continue to progress as a writer.

[[span class="scp-showcase"]][[[scp-3464|SCP-3464: Olive Garden regularly communes with DEMONIC ENTITIES to summon their SATANIC sempiternal garlic bread]]][[/span]]

[[collapsible show="     + Learn more?" hide="- Close excerpt" hideLocation="bottom"]]
**Summary:** Some wizardy assholes steal Mr. Krab's secret garlic bread formula and start summoning demons with it.

**Commentary:** SCP-3464 was my 5th SCP, written in May 2018. 

This was fun to write. It was roughly 5 years ago that I had the idea for extremely gross garlic bread and the strange shenanigans involved with such a phenomenon, and now it's time for that idea to be a thing. So, my plan with this was to make it a relatively inane anart project used to spread the word about food waste. That's a pretty important thing, but it's probably at the very //bottom// of the Foundation's list of things to worry about when the universe can turn into cheese at any moment in the foreseeable future AND past. But I digress.

What other aspects are in this? There's the ghostly voice of Don LaFontaine, a Foundation thaumaturge (because they have those too), demonic shenanigans inspired heavily by Third Law ("demonic edibles" for instance), and an actual demon possessing a hunk of garlic bread. A fun read all together, I promise!

**Summary:** The Centre finds out about Extra-Universal Selachian threats and form a Marine Fighting Team with the know-how to punch it. My first GOI format, and Doomsday Contest 2019 entry.

**Commentary:** SPC-507 was my 1st GOI Format, written in May 2018. And my 1st entry for Team Bird's Doomsday Contest 2018 series. I do plan on writing more SPC in the future.

One thing I wasn't too happy about was the article's density, which people had heavily criticized at the time. The original version was much denser, and after receiving a large amount of crit, it's now become the simplest it's been. I've also more-or-less rewritten significant portions of this, so it's all good to go!

Either way, this is my attempt at giving the Centre a reason to exist in our universe and gives the Avian Division more manpower on the field to fight that bastard Thoth!

**Other things:**

||~ MFT "CHARYBDIS" and "SCYLLA" || References to Greek mythology. ||
||~ "FASH" || Reference to the "bash the fash"**@@*@@** catchphrase. ||
||~ "Gægr" and "Kemdulnim" || Generated using a fantasy dragon name generator. ||
||~ "Quibba" and "Keshrayuth" || Generated using a bird race name generator. ||
||~ Kaa, Waxaklahun, and Mih || Mayan numbers. ||
||~ "LIMP FIREBIRD" || A self-insert. ;) ||
|||| ***NOTICE:** I do not condone bashing anyone. Except sharks. In the snout. ||

For Marine Fighting Team CHARYBDIS, I chose names that are conventionally gender neutral.

* "Quinn" and "Jaedan" are male characters.
* "Leah" and "Haruki" are female characters.

The SPC universe deviated from the main Foundation-verse a few thousand years ago. As such, this article features some alt-history elements. Here are some examples:
||~ The Kingdom of Mycenae || Greece ||
||~ Poseidon Labs || Prometheus Labs ||
||~ Bee Obliteration Registry "K" || Directorate K. Coined by PortalHunter from #site19. ||
||~ Seventh Deviant Crusade || Seventh Occult War ||

[[tab Writing]]
+++ WRITING/INSPIRATION/COMMUNITY
----
I'm a big science fiction fan, and a diehard fan of the //Halo// series, which is where a lot of my inspiration comes from. Truth be told, I'm a nerd. I would say my articles are typically science fiction-oriented (specifically featuring paratechnology), and I always like to explore some wacky concept to its logical extreme. I'm not always the most successful, but I do try.

As far as themes go, I like to write about community, family, and camaraderie. When writing an SCP, I typically think of the object or concept first and inject related concepts into the mix. Once I've figured that out, I try to tell an emotional story about that object or concept. My favourite things to write about are antimemetics and concepts (as in, intangible SCPs).

Other than an exciting universe, SCP is very much so a means for me to practice my writing. My goals are to read every site Canon, write a lot more in general, and improve my character writing.
