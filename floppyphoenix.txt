**Addendum B: Author Commentary:**

[[[SCP-2641|SCP-#: ●●|●●●●●●|●●●●|● - Before the Fire]]]

[[collapsible show="     + Learn more?" hide="- Close excerpt" hideLocation="bottom"]]
**Item #:** SCP-2641 - Before the Fire

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Summary:** SCP-2641 is a sentient concept that lives in different media. Become exposed to these media and you've become another connection 2641 has with the outside world. 2641 will instruct you to find an object, after which it transforms that object to allow it to perform in a manner //opposite// to the way it's supposed to (see the Experiment log for all the zany applications of this concept). If your selected object is a medium, 2641 spreads into that medium, gaining more power in the process. When 2641 has influenced enough persons, objects, or media, that's when the shit hits the fan, and it begins to regain its lost reality-bending properties.

That's really only a summary for the first //quarter// of the article. The rest is where things get a bit insane. Think, dense rainforest, mysterious cult contained by the Brazillian government, exploding spears, a father wishing to save his daughter, exiled denizen from Plato's World of Forms. That sort of thing. You'll have to read the scip and its corresponding supplements to understand what's going on, and I strongly urge that you do.

**Commentary:** SCP-2641 was my 1st successful SCP, written in April of 2017 following the Horror Contest. I had been trying to write a successful SCP article since 2013, and it took all the way until 2017 for me to muster up something bearable. 

2641 was very much an experiment. I wanted to write an SCP that was contained within its own documentation. I wanted to be able to justify why the Foundation would even do such a thing. And I wanted to show that there was something very not right going on behind the scenes. I don't think I was the most successful in doing these three things, but either way, I'm happy with how the article turned out.

The idea began with, "what if objects didn't act like they were supposed to, and instead acted the opposite of that?". It took a lot of writing and rewriting to make that idea make sense. Some people are still confused to this day, so clearly I haven't done the best job of explaining, heh. If you want to write your own entry, the Experiment log document is a collaboration piece open to all.

**Also:** I made the memetic kill agent with Google Deep Dream. I like how it came out!

[[[SCP-3787|SCP-#: ●●●|●●●●●●●|●●●●●●●●|●●●●●●● - The Horse Meme]]]

[[collapsible show="     + Learn more?" hide="- Close excerpt" hideLocation="bottom"]]
**Item #:** SCP-3787 - The Horse Meme

**Object Class:** Hiemal

**Summary:** A mysterious group of antimemetic equine entities (known as "Nighters") are trying to give themselves some power on Earth. To counteract this, in what is perhaps the failed Deus Ex Machina of a drowsy god, horses have begun to breed 10 times more quickly, increasing the size of equine concepts in collective human headspace and making humans very afraid. This increase in "conceptual horse-ness" is effective in scaring away the Nighters, who fear the more powerful //Common Horse//. Of course, the Foundation tries to contain this strange horse anomaly by slowing down horse birth rates. Not only do they start a mass horse die-off, they allow the Nighters to pour into our world to wreak havoc throughout North America.

This article has a lot of things packed into it, including an explanation for where modern-day mnestics come from, the SCP-2000 of horses, and crosslinks with a few different horse SCPs (intended to be a "Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse" sort of thing). It also features a new task force Pi-3 ("Glue Factory") that battles antimemetic horse people with laser weapons, which is frankly //the coolest gosh darn thing ever.//

**Commentary:** SCP-3787 is my 2nd SCP, written in February of 2018. It took me a very long time to come up with a second article. 3787 is the most ambitious article I've written and was dubbed the "001 of Horse Anomalies" when I was pitching it to people. As with 2641, I'm unhappy with how I executed some things here as well, but I do plan on giving the article an overhaul --when I'm not lazy-- in the near future. If you find that this article reads like I threw a bunch of horse anomalies into a blender, then I assure you: Mary Shelley's horse version of Frankenstein is //precisely// what I was looking for. Totally. I promise.

I'm definitely not done writing about my horses. In the future, I plan on writing a few more SCPs related to the Nighters and North America's post-horse apocalypse. There's an entire world of horse people I want to explore.

[[[SCP-3719|SCP-#: ●●●|●●●●●●●|●|●●●●●●●●● - Your Friendly Neighbourhood Lawnmower]]]

[[collapsible show="     + Learn more?" hide="- Close excerpt" hideLocation="bottom"]]
**Item #:** SCP-3719 - Your Friendly Neighbourhood Lawnmower

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Summary:** It's a lawnmower. Somehow, it ended up in a suburb of Baltimore, quickly making the neighbourhood closer than it's ever been. As in, it literally caused a bunch of residents to form into a 5,000 kg mass of flesh that mows lawns all day. And they enjoy it.

**Commentary:** SCP-3787 is my 3rd SCP, written in March of 2018. I'd say it has a very Series I tone. This speaks not to the quality of the SCP (I think it's interesting enough), but to how simple it is. I haven't much to talk about in terms of how I wrote it because, to be honest, it took me a few days to go from the beginning to the critique stage. I've wanted to write something like this for about a year now, but could never figure out how until recently.

[[[SCP-3309|SCP-#: ●●●|●●●|o|●●●●●●●●● - Where We Go When We Fade, Fade Away]]]

[[collapsible show="     + Learn more?" hide="- Close excerpt" hideLocation="bottom"]]
**Item #:** SCP-3309 - Where We Go When We Fade, Fade Away

**Object Class:** Keter

**Summary:** The Foundation discovers coldposts //in-universe//. They discover that these coldposts begin to become deleted, like their out-of-universe counterparts. And then they decide to delete some dangerous anomalies as though they were also coldposts, and everything goes horribly wrong.

**Commentary:** SCP-3309 is my 4th SCP and first collab. I co-wrote it with [[*user PhamtomGuy]] in April of 2018. This is the most meta article I've ever written, and probably will ever write. It's also a major format screw.

3309 is a bit of a strange article for me. I'm not exactly a fan of meta articles myself, unless they're done competently. But I don't actually think the work I put into 3309 is enough to consider it a well done meta article. 3309 is an ambitious story and an ambitious story requires ambitious writing. I do believe I put in decent writing, but not enough to allow for all of its parts to flow smoothly. Suffice to say, I don't think there's enough there for me to be satisfied with my writing. Perhaps it's the concept itself that needs work, perhaps there is too much reliance on a gimmick; perhaps it's both of these things.

Of course, as a collaborative article, there comes a point where both parties have to agree to take the middle path and be happy with the work they've put in, respective of one another's writing ability. To my co-writer it may seem as though we kept this article on the burner for long enough and that it needed to be posted, and the votes certainly seem to display a job well done (note: I don't necessarily believe that votes = a good article, either. 3309 is //very// controversial, especially among writers). But there will always be something in me that isn't happy with the work I put in, and I suppose that might never change.

Altogether, 3309 was a learning experience, and I hope I'm able to continue to progress as a writer.

[[[SCP-3464|SCP-#: ●●●|●●●●|●●●●●●|●●●● - Even Garlic Bread Can Be Creepy]]]

[[collapsible show="     + Learn more?" hide="- Close excerpt" hideLocation="bottom"]]
**Item #:** SCP-3464 - Even Garlic Bread Can Be Creepy

**Object Class:** Neutralized

**Summary:** Some wizardy assholes steal Mr. Krab's secret garlic bread formula and start summoning demons with it.

**Commentary:** This was fun to write. It was roughly 5 years ago that I had the idea for extremely gross garlic bread and the strange shenanigans involved with such a phenomenon, and now it's time for that idea to be a thing. So, my plan with this was to make it a relatively inane anart project used to spread the word about food waste. That's a pretty important thing, but it's probably at the very //bottom// of the Foundation's list of things to worry about when the universe can turn into cheese at any moment in the foreseeable future AND past. But I digress.

What other aspects are in this? There's the ghostly voice of Don LaFontaine, a Foundation thaumatologist (because they have those too), demonic shenanigans inspired heavily by Third Law ("demonic edibles" for instance), and an actual demon possessing a hunk of garlic bread. Fun read all together, I promise!

[[[SPC-507|SPC-#: ●●●●●|o|●●●●●●● - The Bigger Boat]]]

[[collapsible show="     + Learn more?" hide="- Close excerpt" hideLocation="bottom"]]
**Project #:** SPC-507 - The Bigger Boat

**Summary:** The Centre finds out about Extra-Universal Selachian threats and form a Marine Fighting Team with the know-how to punch it. My first GoI format, and a contest entry.

**Commentary:** This is my first entry for my team's (Team Bird) Doomsday Contest 2018 story. It was a blast to write and I definitely plan on writing more SPC in the future.

One thing I'm not too happy about is how dense the article is, which people have commented about and explained as being the cause of their downvote. I tried to make things more simplistic during critique sessions and honestly, this is about the most simple the article has been during its various stages of writing. Frankly, things such as "FASH" and "TOP" can be cut out of the article entirely, and I can give the Gaegr character universe-travelling powers. I can make these additions but it'll have to be after the contest ends (cus rules).

Either way, this is my attempt at giving the Centre a reason to exist in our universe and gives the Avian Division more manpower on the field to fight that bastard Thoth.

Other things:

* CHARYBDIS and SCYLLA are references to Greek mythology. Unfortunately, I don't know much about Greek mythology, so a simple namedrop is the extent of the reference here
* MFT CHARYBDIS was my take on supersoldiers, which is something I've always wanted to write 'cause it's fun as heck!
* There are a //lot// of alt-history elements to this SPC, since the SPC reality deviated from Foundationverse's own a few thousand years ago. Here are some examples of that:
 * "The Kingdom of Mycenae" = Greece
 * "New South Wales" = Australia
 * "Poseidon Labs" = Prometheus Labs (though Prometheus Labs actually exists in the SPC canon)
 * "Ophiuchus" = some made-up month
 * Seventh Deviant Crusade = Seventh Occult War
* "Gægr" and "Kemdulnim" were generated using a fantasy dragon name generator
* "Quibba" and "Keshrayuth" were generated using a bird race name generator
* "FASH" was named in such a manner because of a dumb idea I had to slide a lame "bash the fash" joke into the article. Quick note that I do not condone bashing anyone (except shyarks) :O
* Kaa, Waxaklahun, and Mih are Mayan numbers
* Quick thing about the members of MFT CHARYBDIS, because I decided to pick names that are conventionally gender-neutral. Quinn and Jaedan are male while Leah and Haruki are female.
* LIMP FIREBIRD is a self-insert ;)
* PortalHunter from site19 came up with Bee Obliteration Registry "K". I'd like to write an article or something about them some day.

**Addendum C: Writing Style and Themes:** 

[[collapsible show="Because the nicest thing about hypnosis, is that wonderful feeling of physical and mental relaxation..." hide="...That can now spread throughout your entire body."]]
I'm a big science fiction fan, and a diehard fan of the //Halo// series, which is where a lot of my inspiration comes from. Truth be told, I'm a nerd. I would say my articles are typically science fiction-oriented, and I always like to explore some wacky concept to its logical extreme. I'm not always the most successful, but I do try.

As far as themes go, I like to write about community, family, and camaraderie. When writing an SCP, I typically think of the object or concept first and inject related concepts into the mix. Once I've figured that out, I try to tell an emotional story about that object or concept. My favourite things to write about are antimemetics and concepts (as in, intangible SCPs).

Other than writing SCPs, I've been trying to write my own science fiction series for a few years now. I haven't been the most successful, but I have done tons of worldbuilding. Other than an exciting universe, SCP is very much so a means for me to practice my writing. My goals are to read every single SCP (I've started on Series III to make things easier), write enough to create a successful hub (the story of The Horse Meme is definitely going to continue), and improve my character writing.

Final thoughts: my favourite SCP of all time is [[[SCP-2747]]], and all my stories revolve around Site-82 in some way. Also, I would //love// to write a time travel scip some day.

**Addendum D: Declassifications:** 

[[collapsible show="Leak Redacted File?" hide="Of course."]]You'll mainly find me interacting with the r/SCPDeclassified satellite community, which is a subreddit devoted to explaining hard-to-understand SCPs. I spend most of my SCP-related time --laughing at memes-- discussing new scips on the SCPDeclassified Discord server, and the friendly community there is fun to brainstorm with and receive feedback from. I've written a single Declassification, and hope to write more in the future.
