**Full Name:** Jefferey Jebadiah Jacques Ray

**Status:** Containment Specialist

**Security Clearance:** Level 2

**History:** Jeff Ray has an apparent masters degree in civil engineering and a bachelor degree in computer science. Was recruited by the Foundation by way of civilian lottery. Prior to employment with the Foundation, he was employed by an entity known as "Lars' Burger Sack.[[footnote]] Said entity was later confirmed anomalous and contained as SCP-████. [[/footnote]]" His fellow personnel has noted Mr. Ray to have an extremely juvenile sense of humor and to frequently use profanities in his everyday speech. Mr. Ray has been reprimanded at least 14 times for such behavior.

Aside from his behavior, Mr. Ray is an extremely generic and unnoteworthy member of Foundation personnel. Despite this, he had won best of show in the Site ██ Talent Show for his impersonations of humanoid anomalies in containment.

The first scip I've written. I honestly don't really have too much to say about that one other than it was an unexpected success. I kind of wish that article bombed though because I feel like I didn't really learn anything from that experience.

**Notes:**[[collapsible show="[DATA EXPUNGED]" hide="[DATA EXPUNGED]"]]
The most I've worked on something for this site thus far. The main inspiration for this was Evangelion. SPOILER WARNING: Towards the end of End of Evangelion, it's mentioned that Yui devised EVA Unit-01 to be a reminder of humanity's existence long after they're gone. Swap humanity with long ash-boys and EVA Unit-01 with a big statue and then you have 3195.

**Notes:**[[collapsible show="[DATA EXPUNGED]" hide="[DATA EXPUNGED]"]]
My first (and probably only) tale. This was for 173fest which I originally wasn't going to participate in, but I changed my mind because I thought it would make for a good challenge. I assumed that people were probably going to tack on an origin story to 173, so I decided to play up 173's strengths, in that nobody knows what it is or where it came from. From there, the whole life metaphor kind of formed naturally and the rest wrote itself.
