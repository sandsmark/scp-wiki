title:The Janitor (who cleans up after messy SCPs)
**Name:**  Wilhelm Grungkok

**Level:**  Although Wilhelm's security clearance level is the closet you get to having to walk around with one's eyes closed and ears covered while shouting "I'M NOT LISTENING" loudly to oneself, somehow he still seems to know more then someone of his rank should.  This could be attributed to his skill at cleaning researchers desks without messing up their large stack of papers and organization system.  This gift at putting everything back into its exact place, neatly, has gained him some renown and thus many scientists ask him to do this task frequently, when their offices are a mess, which ends in leaving him alone for long amounts of time after hours with sensitive documents.  He also seems to be a master at "dusting" videocassettes, "fixing" the woodwork on table legs //(yes, i mean he's hiding under the table when we discuss containment produces)// and "oiling" hinges on doors to rooms where overseers are sitting down and speaking of important manners //(irregardless of the fact that since the recent grant, most doors are computer operated and slide open- he seems to believe that anything mechanic could use a good oiling, even if its is hydraulic press operated)//

//Note:  Hey give the guy a break.  He's housed in a ward that doesn't allow television because of the nearness of that one SCP that manipulates information waves.  He's got to get entertainment somehow.//

**Location:**  Wherever the nearest vomit pile is.

Biography:  This is the guy who cleans up 683's pen on a everyday basis.  What other peoples punishment is, that's his daily job.  Can you believe it?   Oh, now that I remember, Wilhelm actually wanted me to attach a note of that very subject.

//Note from the Janitor:  Will you Doctors stop sending people who piss you off or the newlings to that damm alligators cage.  I don't mind a couple, because i can use them as a distraction, and when the monster comes at me, just throw them in the way as bait, but on the other hand when there're too many they block that exit in their clammer to escape.   They all run like girls to the door, when I'm trying to get out!  Are you trying to kill me?//


SCPs the Janitor has cleaned up after.


[[[SCP-342]]]   (there was nothing to tidy at all.  all i did was pretty much dust the filing cabinet!  I felt like a French maid with a feather duster.  Wheres the vomit!

[[[SCP-349]]]  (I actually got to cut the grass and pull the moss of some of the tombstones!)

[[[SCP-415]]]  (Finally!  I must be working my way up or something.  This guys got tons of fluids and gore!  I even got to mop up a blood pool!)


**Interview with the Janitor:**
Personnel Manger:  So... why are you so obsessed with becoming employee of the month?

Janitor:  I damm well deserve it!  But i'll accept it... i'm just going to have to keep trying, harder.  even though i put my life and soul into this place.

Personnel Manger: Well, ah, actually we just give it to the janitor who survives the longest.  its a tradition.

Janitor:  So thats why that old far Arthur Stroduhelm has been on that god damm winning streak?  Look, if you do it like that... well the idea of employee of the month and the longest surviving worker are direct opposites then.  The longest living guy a coward!  Do you know why Arthur lived so long?  Modified broomstick!  Its got to be at least 15 feet long.  And he just sticks it in between the bars of the cage, unlike me, who is just a extremely fast moper, which is something that actually deserves commendation!

Personnel Manger:  Ah...yes... you are a quick moper.

Janitor:  And have you seen his cleaning squirt bottles.  I swear he's switched with some kind of flamethrower.  The spray can shot across entire rooms.  Humpth.  Oh well.  I guess I'll just have to wait until that ancient idiot dies.

Manger:  Um...

Janitor:  What?

Personel:  Well actually, the employee of the month gets to clean around the life extending SCP's...as a sort of reward.  like job heath benefits.  So he's going to be around for a while.

Janitor:  God dammit!
