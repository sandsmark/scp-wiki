[[tab Announcement from Site 101 Director Paulsen]]

The following announcement was sent from Director Paulsen's Foundation email to all Site 101 Staff on 19 June ████ at 10:15.

> Good morning,
> 
> In light of apparent budget cuts, I've submitted a site transfer request for ██% of researchers, █% of medical staff, ██% of armed personnel and █% of D-Class to surrounding facilities. Those of you who were selected for transfer will receive an email at around 6:30 specifying your new work detail. I want to assure everyone that this is not a demotion, and I wish you all the best of luck elsewhere. I want to offer the same sentiment to everyone remaining as well. You are all invaluable assets to the Foundation and it has been a pleasure working alongside you.

[[collapsible show="+ LEVEL 4/3698 CLEARANCE REQUIRED" hide="- CLEARANCE ACCEPTED | INTERCEPTED MESSAGE FROM DIRECTOR PAULSEN"]]

The following announcement was sent from Director Paulsen's Foundation email to all Site 101 Staff on 19 June ████ at 10:03. Email contained several flagged linguistic memes that triggered its immediate redirection to ██████████.███ for correction and redistribution. Director Paulsen was reprimanded for attempting to utilize the previous on-site incident for anti-Foundation rhetoric. His editing and viewing permissions for SCP-3698-related documents were also summarily revoked.

> Good morning everyone,
> 
> I want this stated for the record: the Euclid designation is insufficient, period. I don't care anymore if this results in my demotion; I owe my staff full honesty, just as I believe the Foundation owes every anomaly, however well-contained, due attention. After the May 24 Incident, I hoped they could finally come to see things our way. Alas, after reviewing the site's allotted budget for next year, I doubt they will.
> 
> I'm going to be frank. There is absolutely no evidence that SCP-3698 is fully contained. In fact, based on Ji et al.'s report, SCP-3698's area of effect could be up to ████% larger than our current estimate. The figure, of course, is imprecise--something the higher-ups were keen to remind me of. I stress, however, that its inaccuracy is not the result of miscalculation but simply a side effect of our diminishing resources.

You have all been invaluable assets to not only Site 101, but the Foundation as a whole.
> 
> To those remaining, congratulations - and apologies - are in order. Things are not going to get easier around here, and I'm not going to be any more lax. The Rottbauer Lockdown is still in effect, and likely won't be lifted until Dufour's team can get their filtration system out of the prototyping phase. If it works, it'll be a monumental success, and maybe, just maybe, I won't be as stuck-up about the class designation.

[[include component:image-block

    caption=A view of Zone 3698-A from a camera atop the inner barrier.
]]

**Item #:** SCP-3698

**Object Class:** --Safe-- Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Wing 6 of Site 101 is to remain under lockdown until further notice. Airlocks on windows, doors, and vent systems of Wing 6 are to be inspected twice daily to ensure structural integrity. No expeditions into Wing 6 for sampling are to be conducted without written approval from the O5 Council.

All identified instances of SCP-3698-1 have been quarantined into one of two zones near Mount ███████ and Mount █████, designated Zones 3698-A and 3698-C, respectively. These areas are off-limits to the public, park rangers, and all local law enforcement. The perimeters around these Zones consist of two barriers designed to prevent intrusion:

* One inner barrier constructed of rebar-enforced 3m by 3m bulletproof glass panes. The top of the barrier is lined with electric wiring and cameras every two meters. Each camera has an infrared and low-light setting that can be manually activated from Site 101. The cameras rotate fully once every minute and the rotation is desynchronious to reduce blind spots both exterior to and inside the perimeter.

* One external barrier constructed of chain-link fence with twice the perimeter of the inner barrier. This exterior barrier is designed to deter civilian entry. The fence itself has been treated with trace doses of anterograde episodic amnestics. In addition, the fence contains a Bachelly-Wurmann SAM[[footnote]]Subconscious Aversion Memetic: A nonviolent deterrence method approved for use on civilians. Often abbreviated "SAM". Come in three distinct forms: visual, auditory, and textile, the first being the most common.[[/footnote]] placed every four meters at human eye-level. All staff approaching the barrier for reconniasance or maintainence should be equipped with head-mounted displays designed to filter out cognitohazardous visual stimuli[[footnote]]For examples of use in the field, see document SCP-1730, Addendum 1730.3, Exploration Log 7.[[/footnote]].

Should any instances of SCP-3698-1 be discovered outside 3698-A or 3698-C, they must be destroyed as soon as possible via controlled incineration to minimize damage to surrounding vegetation. Local conservation groups are to be informed that these incinerations are efforts to control the spread of invasive species. All staff assigned to duty within 1km of the Zones must be outfitted in pressure-sealed suits capable of withstanding off-road environments.

Zone 3698-B, located just outside of ███████, WA, is to be kept enclosed in barriers similar to those of 3698-A and 3698-C with one exception. The inner barrier is to be lined with small flamethrowers. If any life is detected within Zone 3698-B, nearby flamethrowers are to activate immediately and incinerate it.

--All collected SCP-3698 samples are to be enclosed in triple-strength 100ml glass vials developed by Site 101 Researcher █████████ Dufour. The lids are vacuum-sealed, and can be opened either remotely or via two switches on the side of the lid, which must be activated simultaneously to release the lid. Vials are to be filled and sealed remotely via X5-Gatherer Drones at Zones 3698-A and 3698-C.-- As of 24 May ████, no more samples of SCP-3698 are to be collected under any circumstances.

SCP-3698-2 is to be stored in a 4m by 3m by 4m pressurized humanoid containment cell in Site 101's Wing 3, furnished with a bed, desk, and desk chair. No personnel are allowed to converse or interact with SCP-3698-2 without written approval from the O5 Council. SCP-3698-2 is to be fed three meals a day through a 0.5m by 0.5m airlocked door on the cell's north wall. One coniferous tree sapling must be in SCP-3698-2's cell at all times. If the tree shows signs of aging or decay, it must be promptly removed and replaced with a healthy sapling by MTF Chi-5 "Connoisseurs" agents. This replacement must be conducted while SCP-3698-2 is asleep. Any personnel entering SCP-3698-2's cell must be outfitted in pressure-sealed uniforms.

**Description:** SCP-3698 is an olfactory cognitohazard produced by a currently unidentified number of //Pseudotsuga menziesii// (Douglas fir trees) in the Cascade Mountain range. While undetectable through all forms of chemical analysis, SCP-3698 and its producers are visible using Kant counters. Regular Douglas fir trees have an average hume reading of 106.0[[footnote]]It is currently unknown why Douglas firs have slightly above-average hume levels.[[/footnote]], whereas SCP-3698 specimens exhibit readings of 107.4. Air contaminated with SCP-3698 shares this hume level.

SCP-3698's effects depend on its concentration in the air, which increases with proximity to SCP-3698 specimens.

* >40m (Imperceptible): Scent is imperceptible at this distance from SCP-3698-1 instances.

* 10-40m (Perceptible): At this distance, SCP-3698 becomes perceptible to humans with normal olfactory abilities. Exposed individuals describe the scent as "pleasant", and "crisp". 89% of test subjects vocally liken it to "fresh pine".

* 10-4.5m (Anomalous): At this distance, individuals begin to develop anomalous symptoms. These include:
 * Obsession with plants. Exposed individuals will request to have plants - usually, but not exclusively, coniferous saplings - placed in their quarters for up to a week after exposure.
 * Elevated body temperature. Upon exposure, individuals' body temperature will increase to feverlike temperatures. Individuals will often complain about the room temperature to staff. Complaints will persist until room temperature is dropped to 10.6^^o^^C. If these requests are met or the individual is removed from the test environment, body temperature will return to normal and complaints will cease.
 * Rumination: For up to ten hours after exposure, individuals will experience persistent nostalgia, particularly [REDACTED | SEE EXPERIMENT LOG]

* 4.5-2m (Potent):Anomalous symptoms will continue to worsen, becoming increasingly persistent and intrusive.
 * Obsession with coniferous plants. Exposed individuals will request to have coniferous saplings placed in their quarters for up to 13 days after exposure.
 * Elevated body temperature. Upon exposure, individuals' body temperature will increase to feverlike temperatures. Individuals will complain about the room temperature to staff. Complaints will persist until room temperature is dropped to 8.6^^o^^C. If these requests are met, body temperature will return to normal and complaints will cease. If the requests are not met, body temperature will stay elevated and subjects will become increasingly distressed.
 * Rumination: For up to 19 days after exposure, individuals will experience persistent, intrusive nostalgia, particularly [REDACTED | SEE EXPERIMENT LOG]
 * Interrogative compulsions: For up to 12 days after exposure, subject will aggressively question staff and other D-Class, prying for personal [REDACTED | SEE EXPERIMENT LOG]. During this time, the individual will be incapable of normal social interaction.
 
* <2m (Extremely potent): Anomalous symptoms are malignant, often irreversible, and induce violence in those exposed.
 * Obsession with coniferous plants. Exposed individuals will request to have coniferous saplings placed in their quarters for up to 13 days after exposure.
 * Elevated body temperature. Upon exposure, individuals' body temperature will increase to feverlike temperatures. Individuals will aggressively complain about the room temperature to staff. Complaints will persist until room temperature is dropped to 3.2^^o^^C. If these requests are met, body temperature will return to normal and complaints will cease. If the requests are not met, body temperature will stay elevated and subjects will become extremely distressed and eventually lose consciousness.
 * Paranoia: When not in wooded areas, individuals will exhibit heightened vigilance.
 * Mutism: Subject will become entirely nonverbal unless explicitly provoked.
 * Interrogative compulsions: When not completely silent, subject will aggressively question any nearby humans, prying for personal [REDACTED | SEE EXPERIMENT LOG] and repeatedly demand to be "returned to the trees".
 * Self-destructive behavior: [REDACTED | SEE INTERVIEW WITH AGENT X5-9 AND EXPERIMENT LOG]
 * [REDACTED | SEE INTERVIEW WITH AGENT X5-9]

SCP-3698 was first discovered on 7 January ████, when two ██████ County forest rangers reported finding a large number of bodies clustered around Douglas fir trees. After contact with the rangers was lost shortly thereafter, MTF Theta-4 "Gardeners" was called to the scene. After a series of remote operations, SCP-3698 and SCP-3698-1 were identified, and the area containing the SCP-3698-1 instances was designated Zone 3698-A. Samples of infected air were later collected and used for D-Class experimentation.

**Addendum 3698.1:** SCP-3698 class changed to Euclid in light of recent incident at Zone 3698-C and concerns brought before the O5 Council by Site Director Paulsen and Researcher Dufour. The concerns included the unpredictability of SCP-3698's appearance in nature and the inability to accurately predict SCP-3698's behavior due to technological limitations. Motion was approved on 20 March ████ by a 12-1 margin.

**Addendum 3698.2:** Director Paulsen has requested that SCP-3698's class be changed to Keter ██ times - █ times before the 24 May Incident and ██ after the incident. Each of these requests have been denied due to insufficient evidence of containment difficulty.

[[tab Interview With Agent X5-9]]

**Interview 3698-12:30-24-02-████**

> **Interviewed:** MTF Chi-5 "Connoisseurs" Agent ███ Singh (X5-9)
> 
> **Interviewer:** Site 101 Clinical Psychologist ████ Rottbauer
> 
> **Foreword:** Rottbauer was to perform a routine psychological assessment with X5-9, who witnessed the only Foundation staff casualties caused by SCP-3698 until the ██ May Incident. X5-9 accompanied the team of technicians that regularly maintains the innermost barrier around Zone 3698-C. Due to repeated lapses into post-traumatic stress, the assessment was significantly delayed.
> 
> <Begin Log, 12:30, 24 February  ████>
> 
> **Rottbauer:** State your name and designation for the record, please. 
> 
> **X5-9:** ███ Singh, X5-9.
> 
> **Rottbauer:** Okay, X5-9... could you walk me through what happened on February ██?
> 
> **X5-9:** You mind if I get some water first?
> 
> **Rottbauer:** No problem. Anything you need.
> 
> //X5-9 gets a cup of water from a cooler. As he carries the cup back to his seat, his hand begins to shake. A small amount of water spills onto the floor.//
> 
> **X5-9:** Shit - sorry. 
> 
> **Rottbauer:** Don't worry, Singh. Let's just get through this. If you need us to do any of those exercises, we can. Unfortunately, the Level-4s won't let me suspend this interview again.
> 
> **X5-9:** I'm fine - just the nerves. We approached the second barrier at around 09:00, like always. The head tech, Li, let us in and almost immediately, Ingham started experiencing problems with his suit.
> 
> **Rottbauer:** Could you be a little more specific?
> 
> **X5-9:** He kept complaining about an indicator in his suit going off - the cooling system, I think. This was before the recall[[footnote]]All Foundation pressure-sealed suits manufactured prior to 2009 were recalled because of a fatal cooling/heating system error. The malfunction made minor leaks in the suits practically undetectable. As a result, a suit's integrity could be compromised without depressurization alarms sounding during even minor cooling/heating system errors. The recall was completed on 27 March ████. [[/footnote]], so we figured it was just a minor issue. We continued to the inner barrier and see that a camera on the east wall is damaged. Li opened up the gate and Yanez and Ingham stepped through while I wait outside.
> 
> **Rottbauer:** Why did you wait outside?
> 
> **X5-9:** Can't keep people out if you're on the other side of the bulletproof glass.
> 
> **Rottbauer:** I see. Please continue.
> 
> **X5-9:** Everything ran smoothly for a while. Yanez set up a ladder and spotted Ingham while he went up to repair the camera. After a while Ingham started complaining that he's getting warm. He yells over to Yanez like "The suit's cooling is broken - I'm gonna get winded if I don't lose some weight." So he unstrapped and dropped down his toolbelt. Just a few seconds after the tool belt hit the ground, Ingham stopped working - dropped his tools and jumped twelve feet down from the top of the ladder.
> 
> //X5-9 takes a sip of water. His hand shakes as he tries to stabilize the cup at mouth-level.//
> 
> **X5-9:** Ingham started rambling as he struggled to stand up. Kept muttering about the "fresh pine", "Christmas morning", all of that stuff - classic signs of exposure. Before I could get to him, Li tried to drag him outside the first barrier. Of course, Ingham didn't like that at all; he kicked Li square in the knee and knocked him over before darting back through the entrance. Yanez managed to chase him down, though, just as he was about to reach a tree, and got him restrained with some duct tape. He also found a small tear near a belt loop of Ingham's suit. Yanez opened the entrances while Li and I carried Ingham back to the Jeep.
> 
> **Rottbauer:** Did you notice any unusual behavior from Li?
> 
> **X5-9:** No - nothing. He seemed perfectly fine. I looked at his knee but the suit still seemed in tact. He responded to my orders without question and seemed pretty shaken by Ingham's behavior. Besides, I had Ingham to worry about first. Then we got back to the jeep and...
> 
> **Rottbauer:** Li incapacitated you, correct?
> 
> **X5-9:** The last thing I heard before everything went black was Yanez yelling at him. I woke up about a half hour later and reached for the submachine gun on my side only to find a torn strap. Somehow, my suit wasn't compromised, so I pulled out my knife and assessed my surroundings. The jeep was still there, so clearly I hadn't been left for dead.
> 
> **Rottbauer:** Did you hear the other members of the team?
> 
> **X5-9:** Not at first; snow's a pretty good sound absorber. I could only start to hear their commotion when I got right alongside the second barrier.
> 
> //X5-9 remains silent for the next twenty seconds.//
> 
> **Rottbauer:** ███, I'm sorry, but I need you to keep going. I'm going to need you to describe what happened after you re-entered Zone C.
> 
> //X5-9 begins to heave.//
> 
> **X5-9:** Li and Ingham were stripped - maybe they did it to themselves, maybe... I don't know. As I got closer... as...
> 
> //X5-9 rubs the back of his head as his face reddens.//
> 
> **X5-9:** They were drilling Yanez into a tree by his fucking hands and feet. Right through his fucking bones! And Yanez just kept screaming and his screams turned into pleas - begging for me to kill him. To just die. For God to let him go. What the fuck could I do? Li had my gun! They knew I was there! What the fuck could I have done?
> 
> **Rottbauer:** Nobody's holding you responsible for this, ███ - 
> 
> **X5-9:** And then, just like that, the drill, the screaming, everything just stopped. No sound for a solid minute. I stood there as they fucking stared at me, trying to pull myself together - trying to think of a way out. Yanez... despite all the blood Yanez lost, he wasn't dead. His head, which had gone limp just a minute ago, looked up. His eyes met mine and... and he just says "we're done decorating the tree". Ingham and Li look at me and start repeating the same thing again and again until their vocal cords fucking froze and ripped apart.
> 
> //X5-9 looks up at Rottbauer, tears visible on his face.//
> 
> **X5-9:** And then they each took turns with the gun. They blew their brains out with my - 
> 
> //X5-9 rests his head back in his hands and begins to sob loudly. Rottbauer attempts to console him, and after 28 minutes is able to escort him out of the room.//
> 
> <End Log, 13:15, 24 February  ████>

**Post-Interview Statement | 24 February ████ | ████ Rottbauer:**

> X5-9 is still in no shape to resume work. Every time he's around a firearm he lapses into post-traumatic psychosis. He should continue his regular medication as prescribed by Dr. Fahey and continue seeing me on a regular basis for CBT. Once again, I believe a small course of episode-specific amnestics could drastically improve his mental state.

**Post-Interview Statement | 3 March ████ | █████████ Dufour:**

> Since what happened at Zone C, one big question has kept me awake: What happened to Li? According to X5-9's observation, Li's suit had no tear in it upon leaving the inner barrier. I understand this is thrown into question given the fact that Ingham kicked Li's knee before leaving the barrier. However, considering that the suits are made of [REDACTED], I doubt that a single kick, much less one from a standard-issue boot, could do significant enough damage to cause a tear - at least immediately.
> 
> Upon examining Li's suit, my team observed that the tear was not caused by impact alone. While the impact certainly did damage the material, it took continuous, localized stress for the suit to actually fail. From this, we've constructed a new timeline of Li's exposure:
> 
> # Assault from Ingham. Li is kicked in the knee once with a standard-issue boot. He expresses no immediate symptoms and is able to understand and complete orders from X5-9. This would compress the [REDACTED] in the fabric at the point of impact, reducing their durability up to ██%.
> # Fabric on the knee stretches and tears while Li and X5-9 transport Ingham to the jeep. As we discovered during the recent recall, the suits' fabric significantly limited motion in the field. MTFs routinely complained about their interference with aerobic activities. We've recorded ███ cases of these things coming apart due to intense stretching before. With the area on Li's suit already damaged, a tear would require far less extraneous activity than such cases.
> # Li assaults X5-9. At this point, it is clear that Li's suit had torn and he has been exposed. He succumbs rapidly, as is standard, and exhibits characteristic symptoms accordingly.
> 
> Of course, this raises another ugly question based on what we already know about SCP-3698. Li's symptoms are indicative of exposure to extremely potent SCP-3698, but according to X5-9's testimony and evidence at the scene, they manifested well outside the external barrier. My only explanation is that gas trapped in Ingham's suit escaped and entered Li's.
> 
> But that would mean SCP-3698 does not behave like a normal gas - that it does not disperse so much as relocate from one individual to the next, like a school of fish or a pack of wolves. After all, both SCP-3698 samples and schools of fish tend to confine themselves to specific volumes. Both have directional behaviors as well, seeking out food or - in SCP-3698's case - Douglas fir trees and humans.
> 
> The main issue with SCP-3698, plain and simple, is that we are too ignorant to determine if it is an object or an organism - whether it is indeed a gas or a cluster of intangible zooids. We do not have the equipment, the funding, or the personnel to determine any of this.
> 
> SCP-3698 is a new breed of memetic anomaly - and I use the term "breed" intentionally here. By almost all measures, it doesn't exist - and according to the only machine that can measure it, it's non-anomalous - twenty points below even a minor reality bender. In other words, SCP-3698 is a pure meme - one that cannot be expressed or reliably detected. It can only be experienced and known by those it afflicts.
> 
> The fact that we even found SCP-3698 is a miracle. The fact that we still consider it Safe is appalling.

> <End Log, 15:05>

**Discussion:** Well, we seem to have a sense of how far away you need to be from SCP-3698 to be relatively unaffected. It seems that, while the scent is still discernable, it doesn't trigger any visible psychological or physiological symptoms at this concentration. At least now we have a contained form of this thing that's somewhere between between "deadly" and "unnoticeable".

**15:00 | 21 Jan ████**

[[collapsible show="[DATA CORRUPTED]" hide=" "]]
[[/collapsible]]
**Discussion:** 10m seems to be the magic distance. For the time being, D-3092 and D-2988 should be separated from their peers and placed under strict observation. We don't want another spree like D-4219's. Additionally, while the effects haven't been communicable thus far, we shouldn't take any liberties. The subjects that didn't display anomalous symptoms can be returned to their quarters.

**15:00 | 26 Jan ████**

**Experimenter(s):** Researcher Donaldson
**Subject(s):** Group D-101-1
**Conditions:** 50 D-Class living in Wing 1 will have vials introduced to their quarters, each of which will be set off remotely at exactly 15:00. The vials' samples will be taken from areas surrounding an isolated SCP-3698-1 specimen in 1-meter increments (i.e. one sample at 1m from the tree, one from 2m from the tree, etc.).

[[collapsible show="[DATA CORRUPTED]" hide=" "]]
[[/collapsible]]

**Discussion:** Thanks to this experiment, we finally have a sense of how concentration changes SCP-3698's effect. Hopefully, we'll be smarter about testing going forward and can restrict our experimentation to case studies. It is my hope that Parker and I can study those affected by the more potent dosages in the near future.

> 
> <End Log, 15:06>

**Discussion:** Once again, it appears that self-mutilation is not a direct result of potent exposure, but rather a side-effect of the exposed individual's distress. It appears that this distress cannot be used as an interrogative aid, either. At least with the subjects exposed to the extremely potent strain, their bodies give out after a while.

> **D-8911:** It's wonderful. But then you realize how empty it all is without them. Without the trees. They're where it all starts and ends - where it all congregates. And then they just burn. Everything burns. Everything starts to burn! It's all hollow! It's all fucking gone!

**Discussion:** It appears that D-8911's intrusive thoughts were not confined to coniferous trees, but also the holiday season. My working theory is that SCP-3698's effect somehow triggers episodic memories associated with Christmas trees. Perhaps it's a form of incentive to lure those affected back to SCP-3698-1 instances.

**Discussion:** D-7149's interrogative compulsion seems to be a common trait among subjects exposed to more potent SCP-3698 samples. All D-101-1 subjects dosed with these samples seemed fixated on all things holidays as well, at least for the first few days after exposure.

**Experimenter(s):** Researcher Donaldson, Researcher Parker
**Subject(s):** D-8883
**Conditions:** D-8883 will be interviewed by Researcher Parker with an armed guard present. Questions will be centered around the deaths of his peers - D-2099 and D-2112, both of whom where exposed to extremely potent samples of SCP-3698 during the January 26 experiment.

> **Parker:** Let's try this again. Could you describe your cellmates' behavior on March 25?
> 
> //D-8883 remains silent for two minutes. Parker motions to a camera in the corner.//
> 
> **Parker:** If you don't answer, I'm going to tell Donaldson to crank up the temperature.
> 
> //D-8883 begins muttering unintelligibly.//
> 
> **Parker:** Could you speak a little louder, please?
> 
> **D-8883:** Let me ask you something first, doctor. You are a doctor, right?
> 
> **Parker:** Well, I do have a PhD. I was hoping you could - 
> 
> **D-8883:** What's the first winter you remember? The first holiday season?
> 
> **Parker:** As we've told you and the others before, we're not going to give into this line of questioning. You are here for us to question, not the other way around. Now, once again: describe your cellmates' behavior on March 29.
> 
> //D-8883 remains silent for several minutes.//
> 
> **Parker:** Let me ask you something else: why do you keep asking me questions about the holidays? What's behind the obsession?
> 
> **D-8883:** It's not a compulsion - more of a coping mechanism. Self-medication?
> 
> **Parker:** How does interrogating other people help you cope?
> 
> **D-8883:** How does it help you?
> 
> //Parker stands up, seemingly out of anger.//
> 
> **Parker:** You know, pissing off the woman who decides whether you leave this room in a body bag or not probably isn't a good idea. Angering me isn't exactly grounds for termination, but it'll make me far less hesitant to give you the benefit of the doubt when you finally pull something.
>  
> **D-8883:**Their pasts strengthen mine.
> 
> //Parker sits back down and leans toward D-8883.//
> 
> **Parker:** Then how does it help you to kill them?
> 
> //D-8883 remains silent for another five minutes.//
> 
> **Parker:** If you won't answer now, you will eventually. This interview is over.
> 
> **D-8883:** I wish for you to return me to the trees, doctor.
> 
> **Parker:** You and me both, pal.
> 
> <End Log, 15:10>

**Discussion:** He's still mostly nonverbal. We'll never be able to proceed with these interviews until we can find some way to coerce D-8883 into giving us useful responses.

**Discussion:** The injuries D-8883 continues to inflict on others' hands appear to be significant; it's a behavior he repeated in each of the two latest tests. However, it appears that in the presence of coniferous plants, he doesn't even need to be intimidated into violence. Suicidal mutilative behavior also appears to heighten under these conditions. Perhaps observing D-8883 around more coniferous plants for a longer span of time could further elucidate this uptick in aggressive behavior.

**Disciplinary Referral from Researchers Dufour, Tiller, Milton, Davis, and Rottbauer. Statement below prepared by Dufour:**

<Attached: █████████████████>

It has come to the attention of several Site 101 researchers that Director Paulsen has been complicit in Donaldson and Parker's unethical experiments on D-Class personnel. We believe that his personal fears regarding SCP-3698 have hindered his effectiveness as a leader and hope that he can be brought before the Ethics Committee and O5 Council for disciplinary action. We have attached the Experiment Log to this letter for your review. As you will see, several of these experiments utilized egregious numbers of D-Class, violating Foundation Ethics Code 4.A.098.

We have become increasingly concerned at the testing conditions of one D-Class in particular, D-8883. D-8883's tests repeatedly involved excessive psychological trauma both to him and to other subjects. Instead of being separated from his peers, D-8883 has been exposed to ██ other D-Class during tests and allowed to maul and torment them under the guise of routine experimentation. When questioned about their motives for doing this, Donaldson and Parker have been dismissive and obstructive. They were also dismissive when Rottbauer insisted on running psychological debriefs on exposed D-Class prior to decommissioning, insisting that such treatment  would "interfere with long-term observational results".

We request:

* That Director Paulsen be held before the Ethics Committee on charges of attempting to conceal information from both the O5 Council and the Ethics Committee on numerous occasions. This renders him complicit in the series of unethical experiments that occurred under Researchers Donaldson and Parker.

* That Researchers Donaldson and parker be assessed for antisocial personality disorder and denied access to all D-Class experimentation as soon as possible.

* That Researchers Donaldson and Parker be reprimanded for their continued unethical experimentation on D-Class under Foundation Ethics Code 4.A.098, 4.A.201, and 4.A.202.

While the Foundation routinely uses D-Class for experimentation that operates in the moral gray area - and yes, sometimes in the dark - it also demonstrates parsimony whenever possible. Through his "by any means necessary" philosophy, Paulsen has clearly demonstrated poor leadership and professionalism. We hope

||~ Time ||~ Location ||~ Event ||
|| 14:50 || Room 602 || Researcher Donaldson and Researcher Parker review the questionnaire prepared for an SCP-3698 D-Class experiment scheduled for 15:00. ||
|| 14:51 || Room 602 || Donaldson notes as an aside that he wonders "how long it'll be until [they] can get back to more fun subjects". ||
|| 14:51 || Room 602 || Parker asks Donaldson to conduct the interview as "8883 probably won't be too cooperative with [her] anytime soon". ||
|| 15:01 || Test Room 614 || D-8883 enters Room 614 accompanied by Agent X5-18. ||
|| 15:04 || Test Room 614 || Donaldson enters Room 614. ||
|| 15:04 || Test Room 614 || D-8883 seemingly enters a psychotic state, charging Donaldson. X5-18 fires upon D-8883, hitting him █ times in the chest and abdomen. A stray bullet strikes Donaldson in the hand, causing rapid blood loss. Despite traumatic injuries, D-8883 charges X5-18 and steals the knife strapped to his side as █ additional rounds are fired into his legs and torso. ||
|| 15:05 || Test Room 614 || D-8883 stabs X5-18 several times in the right arm, causing X5-18 to drop his firearm. D-8883 grabs the gun and fires █ rounds into X5-18, killing him. ||
|| 15:05 || Observation Room 612 || Parker calls for immediate MTF support to Wing 6 over the intercom. ||
|| 15:05 || Test Room 614 || D-8883 fires ██ rounds into Donaldson's hands. Donaldson lapses into shock from blood loss and loses consciousness. D-8883 fires into the observation cameras, and video and audio feed from Test Room 614 is lost. || 
|| 15:05 || Test Room 614 || D-8883 fires █ rounds, presumably into the test room door. The door's lock fails shortly after. ||
|| 15:06 || Wing 6 /Main Wing Airlock|| X5-3, X5-4, X5-6, X5-7, X5-10, X5-11, and X5-12 enter Wing 6 as D-8883 enters the corridor, each dressed in pressure-sealed combat uniforms. X5 agents open fire. ||
|| 15:06 || Corridor || D-8883 takes cover in the entrance of Test Room 614 and begins firing into doors on the opposite side of the hall, several of which are storage rooms. ||
|| 15:07 || Corridor || X5-3 manually activates Wing 6's airlock. All windows and exterior doors to Wing 6 are automatically pressure-sealed. ||
|| 15:07 || Corridor || D-8883 steps into the corridor and begins firing at X5 agents. █ rounds strike X5-3 and X5-11 in the feet and left hand respectively. ||
|| 15:08 || Corridor|| D-8883 is killed after ██ wounds to the head, neck, and chest. ||
|| 15:09 || Corridor|| X5 agents progress to Test Room 612 and confirm the death of X5-18 via gunshot wounds to major organs and the death of Researcher Donaldson via blood loss. ||
|| 15:10 || Corridor || X5 agents begin clearing the wing. ||
|| 15:11 || Corridor || Rooms 601-609 are cleared. Researcher Milton is found dead within Room 607 from a bullet wound to the head. Researcher Kim is found critically injured within Room 609 from  █ bullet wounds to the shoulders and calf. Kim is rushed to the medical wing by X5-3. ||
|| 15:15 || Corridor || Rooms 610-614 are cleared. Parker enquires about Donaldson and D-8883. X5 agents inform her of D-8883's termination and Donaldson's death. ||
|| 15:16 || Corridor || Rooms 615-617 are cleared. Researcher Davis is found dead within Storage Room 615 from █ bullet wounds to the head and abdomen. ||
|| 15:17 || Storage Room 617 || Agent X5-7 notes that █ vials of SCP-3698 in Room 617 have been compromised - apparently by D-8883's earlier gunfire. ||
|| 15:17 || Corridor || Several rounds go off in Wing 6 East. Video and audio feed from corridor camera 1, 2, and 4 cease, leaving only camera 3 operational. ||
|| 15:18 || Corridor|| X5 agents regroup in the hallway. X5-4 is noticeably absent. X5-10 and X5-111 note that they did not observe X5-4 leaving Room 614. ||
|| 15:18 || Corridor || Three grenades enter the corridor from Test Room 614 and detonate. X5-6, X5-10, X5-11, and X5-12 are killed in the blast, while X5-7 is concussed. Corridor camera 3 is damaged by shrapnel and audio feed ceases. ||
|| 15:20 || Corridor || Donaldson emerges from Room 612 holding a X5 submachine gun and moves to Room 614. He fires ██ rounds toward the airlock between Wing 6 East and Wing 6 North, compromising it. ||
|| 15:20 || Observation Room 612 || Parker is cornered in her office, visibly distressed. The door to Room 612 is compromised by gunfire. ||
|| 15:21 || Observation Room 612 || Room 612's door opens and Donaldson appears in the doorway. Parker begins hyperventilating and pleading with Donaldson. ||
|| 15:23 || Observation Room 612 || Donaldson fires ██ rounds into Parker's hands. Several of these rounds go through her hands and strike the computers behind her. ||
|| 15:25 || Corridor || X5-7 fires ██ rounds into Wing 6 North. X5-7 is almost immediately killed by █ bullet wounds to the head and neck. ||

|| 15:07 || Corridor || Trapped personnel begin searching for pressure-sealed suits for the unarmed staff. Gunfire is audible from Wing 6 East. ||
|| 15:10 || Laboratory 665 || Staff locate several pressure-sealed suits and equip them. X5-25 leaves to assess the integrity of the airlock separating the North and East wings. Rottbauer begins to search rooms for any remaining personnel. ||
|| 15:15 || Corridor || Researcher Tennyson attempts to break through the airlock on the North entrance to Wing 4. Researcher Tamblin attempts to restrain him, fearing a containment breach. ||
|| 15:15 || Corridor || Tennyson removes Tamblin and beats him unconscious. X5-38 orders Tennyson to lie down on the ground, threatening him with termination, while she assesses the damage to Tamblin's uniform. ||
|| 15:15 || Corridor || Rottbauer is alerted by the rest of the group's state and runs back to them. ||
|| 15:17 || Wing 6 East/ Wing 6 North Airlock || X5-25 reaches the airlock and observes other agents congregating in the corridor. ||
|| 15:18 || Wing 6 East/ Wing 6 North Airlock || Grenades enter Wing 6 East corridor and detonate. X5-25 is unharmed by the blast but the airlock is damaged. ||
|| 15:18 || Corridor || Hearing the blast, X5-38 leaves Rottbauer with a pistol, ordering him to keep Tennyson face-down on the ground and shoot Tamblin if he shows signs of SCP-3698 exposure. X5-38 then leaves to investigate the blast. ||
|| 15:20 || Wing 6 East/ Wing 6 North Airlock || Researcher Donaldson's bullets compromise the airlock and strike X5-25 in the chest and arm. ||
|| 15:22 || Wing 6 East/ Wing 6 North Airlock || X5-38 reaches X5-25 at the breached airlock. X5-25 draws his sidearm and fires █ bullets at X5-38 at point-blank range, killing her. ||
|| 15:23 || Corridor || Tamblin awakens suddenly and shoves Rottbauer to the ground. The pistol falls from Rottbauer's hand and slides a short distance away. ||
|| 15:23 || Corridor || Tamblin begins attacking Tennyson, tearing at his suit and repeatedly smashing his head into the floor. ||
|| 15:24 || Corridor || Rottbauer retrieves the pistol and fires █ rounds at Tamblin, █ of which strike Tamblin in the head and back, killing him. ||
|| 15:24 || Corridor || Tennyson begins exhibiting signs of SCP-3698 exposure. Rottbauer fires a single round at each of Tennyson's kneecaps and orders him to "stay down" or Rottbauer will be forced to terminate him. ||
|| 15:24 || Corridor || Rottbauer proceeds toward the entrance to Wing 6 East. ||
|| 15:25 || Wing 6 East/ Wing 6 North Airlock || ██ bullets strike X5-25 in rapid succession from Wing 6 East. X5-25 briefly returns fire before dying of bullet wounds to the back. ||

|| 15:29 || Storage Room 609 || Donaldson and Parker fully enclose themselves within the ring of saplings. ||
|| 15:29 || Wing 6 East/ Wing 6 North Airlock || Researcher Rottbauer enters Wing 6 East and wanders past the corpses in the corridor, visibly nauseous. ||
|| 15:30 || Observation Room 612 || Rottbauer enters Room 612 and examines the large pool of Parker's blood in the corner. He vomits and sits down in a chair adjacent to the damaged computers. ||
|| 15:32 || Observation Room 612 || Rottbauer examines the Experiment Log, which is displayed on a nearby damaged monitor. Several of the files display corrupted or cognitohazardous information. ||
|| 15:40 || Observation Room 612 || Rottbauer finishes reading the Experiment Log and moves over to the intercom. ||
|| 15:41 || Observation Room 612 || Rottbauer announces that all other personnel in Wing 6 are exposed to SCP-3698 or dead and calls for additional assistance from MTF X5. ||
|| 15:41 || Storage Room 609 || Donaldson and Parker overhear the message on the intercom and step outside the ring of saplings. They proceed to exit the room. ||
|| 15:41 || Corridor || Donaldson fires █ rounds at Room 612. ||
|| 15:42 || Observation Room 612 || Rottbauer hides behind the wall separating Room 612 from the corridor and reloads his pistol. None of Donaldson's rounds make contact. ||
|| 15:43 || Observation Room 612 || Rottbauer fires █ rounds at Donaldson, striking him in the head and shoulder, killing him. ||
|| 15:43 || Corridor || Parker tries to pick up Donaldson's firearm. Rottbauer exits Room 612 and charges her. ||
|| 15:43 || Corridor || Rottbauer shoves Parker against a wall and grabs the submachine gun, firing █ rounds at Parker at point-blank range, killing her. ||
|| 15:45 || Corridor || After standing motionless in the corridor for one and a half minutes, Rottbauer places the gun on the floor and stumbles back into Room 612. ||
|| 15:46 || Observation Room 612 || Rottbauer sits down next to the computers, visibly in shock. ||
|| 15:50 || Wing 6 East/ Wing 6 North Airlock || Researcher Tennyson enters Wing 6 North, shuffling toward the airlock at the entrance to the Main Wing. ||
|| 15:55 || Corridor || Tennyson charges the Main Wing entrance head-first, attempting to break through the airlock. ||
|| 15:55 || Observation Room 612 || Rottbauer hears Tennyson impact the airlock and exits Room 612. ||
|| 15:56 || Corridor || Tennyson bashes his head into the airlock ██ times and begins bleeding profusely from the forehead. Rottbauer runs over to Tennyson and attempts to restrain him. ||
|| 15:57 || Corridor || Tennyson attacks Rottbauer, beating his head and neck. A small tear opens up on Rottbauer's neck, which Rottbauer immediately covers with his glove. ||
|| 15:57 || Corridor || Rottbauer knocks Tennyson to the ground and kicks him in the neck █ times, killing him. Rottbauer then sprints into Observation Room 612. ||
|| 15:58 || Observation Room 612 || Rottbauer inhales deeply and removes his suit. He withdraws a keychain with a small USB attached from his back pocket. ||
|| 15:59 || Observation Room 612 || Rottbauer inserts the USB into a nearby computer and copies over a file from the USB onto the Experiment Log's drive. ||
|| 16:00 || Observation Room 612 || Rottbauer ejects the USB from the computer and suddenly exhales. He grabs a nearby piece of printer paper and begins writing on it with a ballpoint pen. As he continues to write, his handwriting becomes increasingly illegible. ||
|| 16:00 || Observation Room 612 || Rottbauer starts tearing at the paper with the pen before abruptly ceasing all motion. He tapes the note to the hard drive and unplugs the drive from the observation room computers. ||
|| 16:01 || Corridor || Rottbauer exits Room 612, carrying the drive, and enters Room 609. ||
|| 16:02 || Corridor || X5 agents enter Wing 6 East from the Main Wing and proceed to sweep the wing room-by-room. ||
|| 16:05 || Storage Room 609 || X5 agents find Rottbauer in Room 609 encircled by the ring of saplings. Rottbauer surrenders and is promptly detained. ||

As of 24 May ████, SCP-3698-2 is the designation given to Researcher ████ Rottbauer, a human exposed to extremely potent doses of SCP-3698 during the May 24 Incident. SCP-3698 tends to exhibit extreme distress around Director Paulsen, but is otherwise docile. As of the current revision of this document, SCP-3698-2 has only expressed one symptom characteristic of SCP-3698-exposed individuals: attachment to coniferous vegetation.

SCP-3698-2 quickly forms symbiotic connections with coniferous plants, demonstrating a unique understanding of their biological needs despite having little prior botanical knowledge or experience. SCP-3698-2 often has long one-way conversations with coniferous plants placed in its room, though in an unidentified and currently undeciphered language. It is unknown why SCP-3698-2 did not succumb to other symptoms of SCP-3698 exposure. However, as of the current revision of this document, all experimentation on the nature of SCP-3698's traits or psychology is strictly forbidden by the O5 Council and the Ethics Committee.
