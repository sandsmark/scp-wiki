##green|**Phillips (Voiceover):**## Heyo, whoever's watching, you probably know me as pygmallion07, but you can call me Phillips. Doesn't matter if I doxx myself if we're all gonna die, heh. Noone in the chat yet?

**prestooge:** hi. whatre you doing

##green|**Phillips (VO):**## Ah, hey prestooge! Well, uh, I know I got a bit full of myself in my post. But I'm gonna try and-- uh, one second, still getting set up...

//Camera feed turns on, showing a shelf full of different pesticides.//

##green|**Phillips (VO):**## I have these. So... I'm gonna go out with a bang. I'm not the most committed to living anyways.

**prestooge:** theyre immune

##green|**Phillips (VO):**## Yeah. To most of these, actually. But they must have //some// effect. And I can't just do nothing. I've got to entertain you guys too. Least until... well.

//The camera is bought towards a window, showing a swarm of locusts in the sky.//

**prestooge:** oh. well

**prestooge:** what if...

**prestooge:** https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Flamethrower

**prestooge:** :)

##green|**Phillips (VO):**## Haha, that's a great idea! Wikihow, comin' in clutch! //(He pans the camera across his workshop.)// I don't think I have anything for those fancy ones in here though, my mom just liked gardening. But I do have a lighter, could do that thing you always see in TV where they hold it up to the spray...

**prestooge:** thatd be easier yeah

##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## Jesus, its the end of the world and you choose //this// garbage platform for your final livestream?

##green|**Phillips (VO):**## Hey soul! Damn, already getting more folks than I expected. Thought you'd all be dead. And, uh, I'm only using this 'garbage' because the other platforms are down. Bugs must've gotten to the servers or something.

##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## TouchÃ©.

**prestooge:** we are making flamethrower

##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## Heh, nice. I saw a bunch of military people mowing down the lo-shits with guns earlier. Pretty stupid.

**prestooge:** bullet too small

##green|**Phillips (VO):**## That doesn't seem smart, yeah. Also, lo-shits? Heh, I'm stealing that one.

##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## Yep. The, uh, Ravaging of the Lo-shits.

**prestooge:** or god skipped to the eighth plague. and the world is egypt

//Camera is bought towards a drawer, which Phillips begins to dig around in.//

##green|**Phillips (VO):**## Y'know, you've gotten me thinking, what even //caused// this?

##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## Ever heard of the Gaia theory?

**prestooge:** mother nature got mad?

##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## In simple terms, yeah. It's basically that Earth itself is self-regulating, and I think, well, we got too shitty to fix.

##green|**Phillips (VO):**## So we need a reset.

**prestooge:** weird

//Phillips removes a black zippo from the drawer and flicks it open, giving it a spark. The flame lights up.//

##green|**Phillips (VO):**## Well, the hardest part is done!

//Camera pans back to the shelf of pesticides.//

##green|**Phillips (VO):**## One of these must work.

##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## ...I think hair spray would be your best bet, friend.

##green|**Phillips (VO):**## Too late for that. I'm not going outside, not until I'm ready.

**prestooge:** poisoning is better than getting eaten by locusts imo

##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## I guess.

//Phillips grabs a yellow can of pesticide and sets the camera down. Holding the flame up to the spray, he presses down on the nozzle, and the spray catching fire. He quickly stops.//

##green|**Phillips (VO):**## Woohoo! We got it!

##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## You wanna use this against the locusts, right? Sure it's gonna work?

##green|**Phillips (VO):**## Not sure at all. But I'm ready to die trying.

##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## I'm afraid to die.

##green|**Phillips (VO):**## I... I kind of agree. But if everyone else is... what can I do? My life isn't that good anyways.

##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## Hm. Hey, do you think there are rich people in fancy apocalypse bunkers? What if, in the future, some fuckin Fallout protagonist emerges after all the locusts die off? That'd be cool.

##green|**Phillips (VO):**## Yeah, yeah. It's kind of unfair, though.

##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## How?

##green|**Phillips (VO):**## We're gonna die. For no reason. We didn't do anything. But nobody is gonna help us live. You know what I think? That LARPA is like, some secret organization. And they knew this was coming.

##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## I think we talked about that on the Parawatch forums, yeah.

##green|**Phillips (VO):**## And we're completely in the blank. Ugh... Hey, uh, prestooge? You still around?

##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## He's not on the userlist.

##green|**Phillips (VO):**## ...screw this. //(He sighs.)// Goodbye, soul.

##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## Goodbye...

//Phillips walks over to a door, which he pulls open. Stepping outside, he looks up to see a swarm of locusts covering the sky. A part of the swarm begins to fly towards him as he drops the camera.//

##green|**Phillips (VO):**## I'm ready for ya!

//Phillips starts up his makeshift flamethrower, shooting it towards the swarm. Locusts burn up in the air before they quickly surround Phillips, who screams in agony. A few minutes later, his body is completely gone.//

Â ##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## I can't go out like this.

//Minutes pass. The camera is eventually covered by dust.//

**prestooge:** im back sorry i had to go and help my mom get my grandparents into our bunker and

**prestooge:** oh

**prestooge:** f

Â ##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## Fuckin //really//, dude?

**prestooge:** sorry if f was disrespectful

Â ##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## I... I don't even know what to do at this point.

**prestooge:** :(

Â ##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## Hey, prestooge?

**prestooge:** yes?

Â ##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## If you ever come out of that bunker after all this and like, rebuild society, or whatever, please remember me.

**prestooge:** i will

Â ##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## Thank you. Goodbye.

**prestooge:** bye soul
