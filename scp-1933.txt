**Item #:** SCP-1933

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1933 is to be kept in a standard low-security cell equipped with basic furnishings. It is to be provided with one large bottle of Irish whiskey, two medium-sized cartons of double cream, and small amounts of powdered sugar and refined sunflower oil on a daily basis. It is to be showered and disinfected once a week for basic hygiene purposes. As it is unwilling to remove its Santa Claus costume, it must be forcibly stripped and restrained by Level 0 personnel in order to do this. SCP-1933's bodily fluids may not be consumed, even in quantities deemed to be safe, except by Class D personnel in controlled experimental conditions. 

**Description:** SCP-1933 is an obese, middle-aged Caucasian male in a constant state of moderate to severe alcohol intoxication. SCP-1933's bodily fluids (including both intracellular and extracellular fluids) consist entirely of a substance identical in composition to the alcoholic beverage known as Irish cream. This substance adequately fulfils the functions of the fluids it replaces in SCP-1933's tissues, despite the fact that it renders normal biochemical processes essential to life impossible. Foundation scientists have been unable to determine how it manages this.

SCP-1933 subsists on a diet of cream, Irish whiskey, sugar, and refined vegetable oil – the basic ingredients of most commercially produced varieties of Irish cream. It prefers to supplement its diet with small amounts of various herbs and "flavourings" (usually coffee), but these are not essential to its survival. It is incapable of digesting anything that it not a standard ingredient of Irish cream, including readily prepared Irish cream. SCP-1933 will display effects consistent with acute malnutrition if its blood alcohol content significantly falls below or exceeds the range of 15-20% (the typical ABV of Irish cream).  

SCP-1933's bodily fluids are safe for human consumption if intake is limited to 25ml or less within a 24 hour time period. If a subject exceeds this limit, there is a significant risk that all their bodily fluids will be transformed into Irish cream. This substance does not fulfill the functions of the fluids it replaces (as it does in SCP-1933), and as such, it is instantly fatal. The probability that a subject's bodily fluids will be transformed into Irish cream increases by approximately 5% for each additional ml of SCP-1933's bodily fluids. It is not known if the bodily fluids of SCP-1933's victims would have the same anomalous effects as SCP-1933's bodily fluids if they were to be consumed. 

Prior to containment, SCP-1933 was chronically homeless, sleeping either on the street or in derelict buildings, and stealing money with which to purchase the specific items of food and drink necessary to its survival. It would attempt to break into peoples' homes between 23:00 December 24 (Christmas Eve) and 05:00 December 25 (Christmas Day), and place wrapped bottles of its bodily fluids alongside other wrapped presents with the intention that they would later be unwrapped and subsequently consumed. For the rest of the year, SCP-1933 would devote its time to preparing bottles of its bodily fluids to give as "presents" at Christmas time. 

SCP-1933 claims that this activity was motivated by a benevolent desire to give people presents, and refuses to acknowledge that its bodily fluids are fatal if consumed in large quantities. It has not been determined whether it is genuinely unaware and unwilling to accept that this is the case, or whether it is trying to conceal malicious intentions, but the general consensus among Foundation staff who have studied SCP-1933 is that the former is more likely.
