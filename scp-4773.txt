**Item #:**

**Object Class:**

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4773-2 has been moved to a 4 metre by 4 metre by 4 metre containment cell[[footnote]]Size of chamber acts as a baseline for testing; see **Addendum.1** for more information.[[/footnote]] at Site-96 for the purpose of testing. Containment Team CT-4773 are to remain on standby during the initial Preliminary Analysis phase of containment, which is ongoing.

**Description:** SCP-4773-2 is a brown, stuffed bear composed of synthetic fur and cotton. SCP-4773-2 will periodically levitate between 10 and 70 centimetres from the ground, and move in irregular patterns. Objects, entities, and surfaces near SCP-4773-2 may be wholly or partially imperceptible. This is considered normal behaviour.

Due to events, it is suspected that the anomaly possesses some secondary mind-affecting effects. --This has been conclusively disproved.-- //This is considered --normal-- behaviour.// See below.

**Tentative Description:** The following properties which may or may not relate to circumstances surrounding SCP-4773-2 are currently unconfirmed. Reader discretion is advised.
* Mass, shape, etc. -- baseline, normal physical properties
* Movement (__verified__)
* Changes in environment (unspecified (__verified__))
* Removal of food.
* Triggering of //unspecified// subconscious instincts amongst personnel.
* Improper disposal of food --waste--//, which was fully edible at the time//(?) by personnel
 * Fate unknown.
 * Currently three (3) sandwiches, four (4) packets of salted potato chips, and various assorted confectionery.
* Movement (__unverified__)
* --Mind-affecting--[[footnote]] Invoking emotions
- sadness
- pity --for what?--[[/footnote]]
* It's difficult (__verified__)
* --An inability to properly co--
* --Staff are unable t--
* The existence of implications (__unclear__)(?)

**Addendum.1 | Testing Log:**

On April 10th, 1996, a proposal for testing involving SCP-4773-2 (intended to collect data on its anomalous visual effects) was approved by Site-96 staff, and conducted a week later.[[footnote]]During this time, SCP-4773-2's containment cell was designated off-limits and personnel were advised to create an acceptable baseline by keeping interaction with related anomalies to a minimum. Also of note, SCP-4773-2's visual properties did not correspond to its location.[[/footnote]] For the test, the east-facing wall of SCP-4773-2's containment cell was lined with numbered square tiles, 25 cm in length, and observed via closed-circuit surveillance systems. Every hour, a Researcher made note of which tiles they were unable to view, either partially or fully.[[footnote]] SCP-4773-2's location can be ascertained from the placement of the red tile. [[/footnote]] Five hours into testing, procedures were halted, as no conclusive evidence was able to be drawn. The data-sets can be found below.

Testing concluded on April 18th, 1996.

> SCP-4773-2 has been identified as non-anomalous and placed into storage. SCP-4773-1 was located in its containment chamber alongside the object, deceased due to dehydration -- cremation of the body is scheduled for 04-30, and decontamination of the chamber is ongoing
