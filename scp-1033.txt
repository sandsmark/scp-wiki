**Object Class:** Euclid
 
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1033 is to be held in a 15m by 5m standard cell, lined with 5cm thick lead plating, then reinforced with 10cm of steel alloy. The door to SCP-1033's cell is to also be made of 5cm of lead plating, with 10 cm steel alloy, with a three bolt redundancy lock, to only be opened by personnel with authorisation signed by staff with Level 4 clearance or higher only. Personnel entering SCP-1033's chamber must wear approved Level A hazmat suits. If SCP-1033's routine changes or if SCP-1033 attempts to escape, the two guards stationed outside SCP-1033's chamber are to be reinforced with eight more, all armed with Containment Kit 4-MK3 (consisting of a SCAR-L automatic assault rifle with under-barrel net launcher, two (2) 'flash bang' concussion grenades and one (1) M67 fragmentation grenade). If SCP-1033 attempts an escape, all efforts are to be made to stop it to prevent massive radiation contamination.

**Description:** SCP-1033 is a middle-aged Caucasian male, approximately 193 centimetres, or six feet and four inches tall. SCP-1033 was discovered in New York, having, according to several witnesses, "materialised in the middle of the road". Interviews with witnesses found that people in the area experienced a vision-encompassing white flash, accompanied by a two-second burst of static from an unknown source. Witnesses were administered a Class A amnesiac after the completion of the interview, followed by a media blackout regarding the incident. The Foundation was alerted to SCP-1033 by Agent F██████, who was stationed within the NYPD at the time. 

Upon initial inspection at the site of materialisation, Foundation researchers found that SCP-1033 was emitting three times the lethal limit of radiation, approximately 4050 mSv. To contain SCP-1033, field researchers placed a shipping container in his way, sealing it and moving it to Storage Site K█, where he currently resides.


In all physical aspects, SCP-1033 is a normal thirty-five-year-old male. He is dressed in a business suit and carrying a briefcase. Every 33.445 seconds, SCP-1033 begins his cycle. The following timeline is a transcription of that routine.

|| 0 - 10 seconds: || ||SCP-1033 walks thirty paces forward, glancing at his watch approximately every ten steps. ||
|| 10 - 15 seconds: || ||SCP-1033 stops, kneels, and opens his briefcase. Inside the briefcase is a single envelope, marked with an unknown seal and a prepaid █████ brand mobile phone, capable of sending and receiving text messages and calls. SCP-1033 opens the envelope and pulls out a sheet of paper, marked with the words "Cable: asymmetric cipher, 0uuT5LmoO22 lets ruffle feathers". ||
|| 15 - 25 seconds: || ||SCP-1033 types "0uuT5LmoO22" in a text message to the Australian mobile phone number 0404 ███ ███. Investigation shows that this number is yet to be assigned to any mobile phone. At 21 seconds in, SCP-1033 sends the message, puts the phone and letter back in his briefcase. ||
|| 25 - 33 seconds: || ||At 28 seconds, SCP-133 is observing writhing on the ground, screaming in apparent agony. Flesh is seen being stripped off and flying behind SCP-103, as other parts of him disintegrate. The injuries SCP-1033 sustains correspond with that of a victim of a 1.5 megaton nuclear device being detonated. ||

After completion of this routine, SCP-1033 immediately reappears at the start of his routine in mid-step and begins the cycle again. If an object, human or animal stands in the path of SCP-1033, he will make no attempt to [DATA REDACTED]ssive trauma.

Investigation into a possible connection between SCP-1033 and [[[SCP-176]]] is currently pending authorisation.
