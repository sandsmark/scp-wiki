To whom it may concern,

The world is a weird and wonderful place. Though my stay here was short, I could not have picked a better place to be. The earth, with its cultures, its peoples, its oceans, its continents. Its forests. Its deserts. Its tundras. The earth, where you can fly around the globe in two days. The universe, where stars and planets circle around us, or we circle them; sometimes it's hard to tell. I've met many on my journey. I feel blessed for each and every one of them. Both those who I befriended, and those who challenged me. If I could list one regret, it is that I could not do more.

And yet, though my body has stopped moving, and my lungs have stopped drawing breath, and my heart has stopped beating, and my mind has stopped thinking... though I've turned into dirt, and though there is a hole beneath a tree where I was buried. Though all these things, I am not fully dead. Without eyes, I can not see. Without ears, I can not hear. But I know someone who can. Someone whose hands even now steer what was once my ship, sailing by what were once my stars. My sweetheart, my... daughter.

I've never been much of a storyteller.

I've never been much of anything, heheh.

But don't hear it from me...
