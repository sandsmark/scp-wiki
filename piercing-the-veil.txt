Darlene Wuornos from that write-up ##violet|**two-egg**## did (By the way, great job, that was excellent.) had a run-in with that thing and took a hatchet to it, it didn't even blink. I think it's gonna take more than a few bullets to bring them down, and they'll have overrun the military before we know what happened.

Sweet rack, ##purple|**🗿 mr_sen**##. I love the work you put into presentation for us.

Anyways, my sister and I have recently taken up fletching to help us be more prepared for when SHTF. Neither of us knows how to use a bow yet though but we're working our way up. We also started pickling and pruning foodstuff, so we're increasingly ready. Thank you for all the useful guides!

As for what I think is gonna happen, I don't really know, global warming? My sister and I fucked because we're in florida lol.

Hello all. The following has just been confirmed by global news networks and my sources on the inside: The SCP Foundation is indeed responsible for the destruction of North Korea. They claim it's only spacially displaced, but they're also not sure if the civilians survived. 

On another note, I know most of you are panicked as hell right now (as I see on IRC) but I'd like to make an official post here for all of you here and now. We are a family here on the Parawatch Wiki and we will all get through this. The Paranormal has come and it was not what we expected, but we are still prepared nonetheless.

Our new goal is to learn everything there is to learn about the paranormal. We haven't lost our purpose, we've merely shifted our goals a bit. And yes, I do find it funny that this is all happening the very same day our yearly SHTF thread goes up. 

Stay safe out there, watchmen.
