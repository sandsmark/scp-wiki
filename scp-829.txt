**Item #:** SCP-829

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Any and all persons are to be considered armed and dangerous while under the effects of SCP-829. Unauthorized use of SCP-829 is grounds for immediate termination.

The bottle containing SCP-829 is to be kept in a locked, transparent Level-2 Security container of sufficient size, itself secured in [DATA EXPUNGED]. This room must be guarded by at least two (2) Level-3 Security personnel wearing Type-4 steel-reinforced full body armor and headgear, with standard armaments. The bottle itself needs only to be intact, large enough to contain SCP-829, and have a cap of sufficient size that will close securely. Two (2) spare bottles (uncapped, with spare caps) are to be kept in the container with SCP-829, with two (2) additional spare bottles (likewise uncapped) elsewhere inside the room. 

These guards and spare bottles and caps will accompany SCP-829 whenever it is removed from its containment room. SCP-829 may be transported in a Level-2 Security case filled with inorganic packing material (e.g. molded foam or polystyrene peanuts).

**Description:** Note: SCP-829 appears to be equally effective on both males and females. For clarity, this document will assume that the subject of SCP-829 is female.

SCP-829 appears to be a volume of nail polish in a color identical to [DATA EXPUNGED] (R187 G017 B026 color equivalent). SCP-829 is of variable volume, but is typically between three (3) and ten (10) cc in size. The primary component of SCP-829 is [DATA EXPUNGED], a brand of nail polish popular in the 1960s, but also variable amounts of water (up to ██% (█████████ per-cent)), human blood (from multiple individuals; up to ██% (█████████ per-cent)), and [DATA EXPUNGED].

In most respects, SCP-829 behaves like normal nail polish, and it can be applied normally to fingernails and toenails. SCP-829 is able to regenerate more of itself in two (2) ways: by absorbing water vapor from surrounding air, and by “drinking” human blood (usually dripped into its bottle). If neither water vapor nor blood are available, SCP-829 can become dormant, resembling a very hard disk of dried-out nail polish. This disk will automatically start absorbing water vapor whenever it becomes available, becoming fluid again usually in one to two hours, depending on humidity. To date, researchers do not know how SCP-829 can utilize so much water and still maintain its properties as a nail polish. While SCP-829 can affect subjects using ambient water vapor alone, its affects are both more potent, and more numerous, when it is given blood.

When SCP-829 is applied to the fingernails of a human subject, the subject undergoes a progressive series of physical and mental effects. Shortly after the initial application of SCP-829, the subject typically reports feeling “sexier” and “more seductive”, and will start to exhibit more flirtatious behavior. The subject will often attempt to seduce a person she finds attractive after a single application of SCP-829. In every known case, the subject will also feel compelled to prick herself and let her blood drip into the bottle containing SCP-829.

Once at least a drop of blood has been added to its bottle, and SCP-829 has been reapplied to the subject’s fingernails, existing effects are amplified in the subject, and new effects manifest as well. The subject actively tries to initiate a sexual relationship with another person, most often with someone the subject does not already know. The subject uses her fingernails prominently in her flirtatious behavior, dragging her nails lightly across the skin of the target of her seduction. Said targets later report that the subject’s nails across their skin felt “tingly”, “extremely pleasant”, and “like nothing [they’ve] felt before”. This tactile sensation appears to facilitate the subject’s attempts at seduction and sexual advances. The subject will also continue to “feed” SCP-829 more and more blood from small, self-inflicted wounds.

A subject who successfully initiates a sexual relationship with her target will, over a short time, attempt to introduce bondage and domination into the relationship. If the target is initially not willing, the subject will continue to utilize the heightened effects of SCP-829 to persuade the target. In most cases, the target is initially willing or becomes willing after a small amount of additional persuasion with the subject’s fingernails. Targets that do not become willing to introduce these elements either have their relationship ended by the subject, or, infrequently, [DATA EXPUNGED].

By this time, the subject will have fed a significant amount of blood to SCP-829. At this stage, the application of SCP-829 grants the subject the additional ability to consciously control the sharpness of her fingernails. The subject can make her nails sharp enough to shred standard fabrics, gouge wood, and easily slice through flesh. However, sharpened nails have so far exhibited little effect on metals or stones harder than bronze.

Once the subject has successfully introduced bondage and domination into the relationship with the target, she will assume the role of a dominatrix over the target. The target will usually willingly submit to the subject, in no small part due to the heightened tactile sensations of the subject’s fingernails on the target’s skin. The subject will also scratch the target with her nails, drawing blood in the process. The target appears to take pleasure in being scratched this way, or at worst simply ignore these wounds. The subject will usually collect a few drops of the target’s blood in SCP-829’s bottle, and will often lick up and swallow the target’s blood herself. This cycle of domination and bloodletting of the target can last from a couple days to several weeks, although no such relationship between the subject and target has been known to last more than thirty-eight (38) days.

After a period of between two (2) and thirty-eight (38) days, the subject will restrain the arms and legs of the target to a wall or table. This encounter will begin similarly to recent sexual encounters between the subject and target. However, after an initial period of bloodletting, the subject will cut deeper into the target with her nails, over more of the target’s body. Subjects have been known to cut and peel back the target’s skin; slice open the target’s torso and fondle the target’s internal organs; dig chunks out of the target’s flesh and swallow these chunks whole; if the target is male, cut off the subject’s penis and [DATA EXPUNGED]. The subject will also feed copious amounts of the target’s blood to SCP-829, often more than should appear to fit in the bottle with SCP-829.

For a considerable amount of time, the target will continue to take pleasure in the progressive evisceration administered by the subject. However, at some point, the physical anguish of being slowly disemboweled will overcome the pleasurable sensations of the subject’s fingernails, and the target will appear to realize just what the subject is doing. The subject will attempt to keep the target alive as long as possible, collecting much of the target’s blood in SCP-829’s bottle, drinking some of the target’s blood herself, and, seemingly, making the target feel as much anguish as possible for as long as she can keep the target alive.

When the target finally expires, the subject will cease all previous activities involving the target and will attempt to get rid of the corpse as quickly as possible. After no more than five (5) days after eviscerating her previous target, the subject will reapply SCP-829 and start the cycle anew. However, since SCP-829 will have been “well-fed” recently, the tactile effects of the subject’s fingernails will already be quite strong, and the subject will more quickly and easily initiate new sexual relationships.

After SCP-829 is given enough blood from between one (1) and five (5) different targets, the subject of SCP-829 will seduce a new target as normal, but instead of attempting to introduce bondage and domination into their sexual relationship, the subject will instead introduce the target to SCP-829 itself. The target will usually readily allow the subject to apply SCP-829 to the target’s fingernails, and will be affected by SCP-829 as well. 

The two (2) subjects will together continue the flirtation-to-evisceration cycle, seducing some targets individually, and others together. If sufficient blood from subsequent targets is given to SCP-829, then the subjects will eventually attempt to recruit another target as a new subject for SCP-829. However, if SCP-829 is not fed enough blood, then one subject (usually the most recent subject to be affected by SCP-829) will be treated as a standard target, with the remaining subject(s) proceeding to restrain and disembowel the former subject.

It is not known what the maximum numbers of subjects is that SCP-829 can keep enthralled. Theoretically, given sufficient blood, SCP-829 could maintain an unlimited number of subjects. However, since the amount of blood needed to maintain a certain number of subjects roughly follows a geometric progression, and there appears to be a host of other factors affecting this relationship, the practical upper limit for the number of subjects affected by SCP-829 at any one time is theorized to be between twelve (12) and twenty (20).

SCP-829 does not elicit these effects when applied to a subject’s toenails. The only apparent effect is that the subject insists on having her fingernail’s painted with SCP-829 as well.

**Addendum 1:**  

Foundation historians have recreated the history of SCP-829 using a variety of public, private, and classified records. For a complete record, see Document 829-H01, “History and Acquisition of SCP-829”. 

> **Abstract of Document 829-H01**
> 
> Lizzie Hawthorne was a suspected serial killer who had been connected to the disappearance of at least two dozen people in and around San Francisco, CA, between 1964 and 1972. Hawthorne’s modus operandi included seducing her target into a sexual relationship, introducing domination into the relationship (with herself as dominatrix), and, finally, slowly eviscerating her subject using custom-made gloves with razor-sharp “fingernails”. Police had finally caught up to Hawthorne in July 1972, but she had slashed herself to death before she could be taken into custody. Police reports noted that her blood was dripping into an open bottle of nail polish.
> 
> Since Hawthorne had no known next of kin, and her case had been closed for years, in September 1978, the state of California auctioned off many of the items collected from Hawthorne’s crime scenes, including the aforementioned bottle of nail polish. This bottle, along with several other artifacts, was bought by John Corbitt, a self-described “serial killer enthusiast”. Corbitt displayed these items in his home, but did not try to use them himself.
> 
> In 1983, Corbitt met Carrie Warwick, and after several months they became boyfriend and girlfriend. In early 1984, Warwick opened the nail polish bottle from the Hawthorne auction, and, surprised to find the contents still fluid, applied the nail polish to her fingernails. Warwick thus became Subject Zero of SCP-829 and started seducing other men, unbeknownst to Corbitt. Warwick soon introduced Corbitt to SCP-829, and the pair embarked on a cross-country killing spree. Corbitt and Warwick recruited at least two (2) new subjects for SCP-829, but could not give SCP-829 enough blood to keep them for more than a few weeks.
> 
> Police and the FBI trailed Corbitt and Warwick for several years, eventually catching up to them near Richmond, VA. Warwick was apprehended while disemboweling Corbitt and taken into custody. During interrogation, Warwick revealed the existence and effects of SCP-829. The Foundation soon became aware of Warwick’s statement and quickly seized Warwick and SCP-829.

**Addendum 2**

Due to recent incidents, experimentation of SCP-829 on animals requires Level 4 authorization. Experimentation on any member of the following taxonomic orders requires O5 authorization: Carnivora, Chiroptera, Crocodilia, Falconiformes, Piciformes, Primates (excepting humans), Proboscidea, Strigiformes, and Struthioniformes.
