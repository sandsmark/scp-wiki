**Item #:** SCP-829

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Any and all persons are to be considered armed and dangerous while under the effects of SCP-829. Unauthorized use of SCP-829 is grounds for immediate termination.

The bottle containing SCP-829 is to be kept in a locked, transparent Level-2 Security container of sufficient size, itself secured in [DATA EXPUNGED]. This room must be guarded by at least two (2) Level-2 Security personnel wearing Type-4 steel-reinforced full body armor and headgear, with standard armaments. The bottle itself needs only to be intact, large enough to contain SCP-829, and have a cap of sufficient size that will close securely. Two (2) spare bottles and caps are to be kept in SCP-829’s containment room. 

These guards and spare bottles and caps will accompany SCP-829 whenever it is removed from its containment room. SCP-829 may be transported in a Level-2 Security case filled with inorganic packing material (e.g. molded foam or polystyrene peanuts).

O5 authorization is required to access any video log of experiments involving SCP-829.

**Note:** SCP-829 appears to be equally effective on both males and females. For clarity, this document will assume that the subject of SCP-829 is female.

**Description:** SCP-829 appears to be a volume of nail polish in a color identical to [DATA EXPUNGED]. SCP-829 is of variable volume, typically between three (3) and ten (10) cc in size. SCP-829 is composed primarily of [DATA EXPUNGED] brand nail polish, but also variable amounts of water, human blood (from multiple individuals), and [DATA EXPUNGED].

SCP-829 is able to generate more of itself by absorbing water vapor from surrounding air, and by “drinking” human blood (usually dripped into its bottle). If neither water vapor nor blood is available, SCP-829 becomes dormant, resembling a very hard disk of dried-out nail polish. This disk will automatically start absorbing water vapor whenever it becomes available, becoming fluid again within hours. To date, researchers do not know how SCP-829 can utilize so much water and still maintain its properties as a nail polish. 

When SCP-829 is applied to the fingernails of a human subject, the subject undergoes a progressive series of physical and mental effects. On the initial application of SCP-829, the subject will typically feel “sexier” and “more seductive”, exhibit more flirtatious behavior, and often attempt to seduce a person she finds attractive. In every known case, the subject will also prick herself and let her blood drip into the bottle containing SCP-829.

Once blood has been added to its bottle and SCP-829 has been reapplied, existing effects are amplified and new effects manifest. The subject will actively attempt to initiate a sexual relationship with another person, usually a stranger. The subject will use her fingernails prominently while flirting, dragging her nails lightly across her target’s skin. The sensation of the subject’s fingernails feels “tingly”, “extremely pleasant”, and “like nothing [ever] felt before”, and appears to facilitate the subject’s sexual advances. The subject will also continue to “feed” SCP-829 blood from small, self-inflicted wounds.

When SCP-829 has been fed enough blood and is reapplied, the subject becomes able to control the sharpness of her fingernails. The subject can make her nails sharp enough to shred standard fabrics, gouge wood, and easily slice through flesh. However, sharpened nails have so far exhibited little effect on metals or stones harder than bronze.

A subject who successfully initiates a sexual relationship with her target will, over a short time, attempt to introduce bondage and domination into the relationship. The subject is usually successful immediately or after a bit of persuasion with her fingernails. Targets that do not become willing [DATA EXPUNGED]. Upon success, the subject will assume the role of dominatrix over the target. During encounters, the subject will scratch the target with her nails and draw blood, an act the target appears to take pleasure in. The subject will collect some of the target’s blood in SCP-829’s bottle, and will often lick up and swallow some of the target’s blood herself.

This cycle will continue for up to thirty-eight (38) days, at which time the subject will restrain the arms and legs of the target to a wall or table. This encounter will begin as normal, but the subject will cut deeper into the target with her nails, over much more of the target’s body. Subjects have been known to cut and peel back large sections of the target’s skin; slice open the target’s torso and fondle the target’s internal organs; dig chunks out of the target’s flesh and swallow these chunks whole; if the target is male, cut off the subject’s penis and [DATA EXPUNGED].

For a considerable amount of time, the target will continue to take pleasure in the progressive evisceration administered by the subject. However, at some point, the physical anguish of being slowly disemboweled will overcome the pleasurable sensations of the subject’s fingernails, and the target will realize in horror just what the subject is doing. The subject will attempt to keep the target alive as long as possible, sometimes for several days, collecting much of the target’s blood in SCP-829’s bottle (often more than should fit), drinking some of the target’s blood herself, and, seemingly, making the target feel as much anguish as possible for as long as possible.

A few days after the target expires, the subject will reapply SCP-829 and start the cycle anew. However, since SCP-829 will be “well-fed”, the tactile effects of the subject’s fingernails will already be quite strong, and the subject will more easily initiate new sexual relationships.

If SCP-829 is given sufficient blood from enough different targets, the subject will seduce a new target as normal, but will introduce the target to SCP-829 itself instead of following the standard pattern. The target will usually readily allow the subject to apply SCP-829 to the target’s fingernails, and will be affected by SCP-829 as well. The two (2) subjects will together continue the flirtation-to-evisceration cycle, seducing some targets individually and others together. As progressively more blood is given to SCP-829, the subjects will periodically attempt to recruit more targets as subjects for SCP-829. However, if SCP-829 is not fed enough blood, then one subject (usually the newest recruit) will become a standard target; the remaining subject(s) will then restrain and disembowel the former subject.

SCP-829 could theoretically maintain an unlimited number of subjects, given sufficient blood. However, the amount of blood needed to maintain a given number of subjects follows a roughly geometric progression, outside of many other mitigating factors. Thus, the practical upper limit for the number of simultaneous subjects of SCP-829 is theorized to be between twelve (12) and twenty (20).

SCP-829 does not elicit these effects when applied to a subject’s toenails. The only apparent effect is that the subject insists on having her fingernails painted with SCP-829 as well.

**Addendum 1:**  

Using a variety of public, private, and classified records, Foundation historians have compiled the history of SCP-829 into Document 829-H01, “History and Acquisition of SCP-829”. An [[[history-829-h01|abstract]]] is also available.

**Addendum 2**

Due to recent incidents, experimentation of SCP-829 on animals requires Level 4 authorization. Experimentation on any member of the following taxonomic orders requires O5 authorization: Carnivora, Chiroptera, Crocodilia, Falconiformes, Piciformes, Primates (excepting humans), Proboscidea, Strigiformes, and Struthioniformes.
