title:Exquisite Corpse Contest
[[image exquisite-corpse-logo.png]]


++ The Contest

According to Wikipedia, an exquisite corpse “is a method by which a collection of words or images is collectively assembled. Each collaborator adds to a composition in sequence, either by following a rule… or by being allowed to see only the end of what the previous person contributed.” In this case, we’re challenging you to write an exquisite SCorPse: you will enter an Object Class, then write Containment Procedures for someone else’s Object Class, and then write a Description for someone else’s Object Class bolted to yet someone else’s Containment Procedures.
And you won’t know what you’re getting until you get it. 

++ The Rules

# To enter, post a comment in the discussion thread of this page with an Object Class. That’s it. The Object Class must be one of the Primary Classes listed on the [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/object-classes |Object Classes]]] page. Explained is also allowed. Combinations of the six base classes are allowed, but you may only combine two classes. "Safe (Formerly Keter)" or "--Euclid-- Neutralized" are allowed, but "--Safe-- --Euclid-- --Keter--" is not.
 * Esoteric and Decommissioned classes are //not// allowed. The Risk & Disruption classes from the [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/anomaly-classification-system-guide |ACS]]] are also not allowed.
 * You may enter after the entry deadline closes, but you will be considered a //pinch hitter//: you will not be assigned an object class or containment procedures unless someone else has to drop out, at which point you will be PMed with details to fill in for them. Normal deadlines will still apply. Pinch hitters will be assigned on a first-come, first-serve basis.
# In the spirit of the contest, you must write something new. You may write an existing idea, but you may not use any material from a pre-existing draft. This includes multimedia. No exceptions.

# In the first phase of the contest, after entering, you will be given someone else's Object Class to write Containment Procedures for. You can, of course, solicit critique for this phase.
 * The Object Class you receive cannot be changed. 
 * You may include images and other multimedia in the Containment Procedures you submit. 
 * Instead of localizing the image in the Containment Procedures, you should simply add a link to the image. Your coauthor will localize the image. Creative Commons license requirements still apply.
 * To submit your Containment Procedures, send them to either ([[*user A Random Day]] or [[*user ProcyonLotor]]) in a Wikidot PM, with subject line “Exquisite Corpse Entry”. Before sending the PM, wrap your containment procedures in a code block like so:
[[code]] 
[[code]] 
raw text of containment procedures (including any wikidot formatting) goes here. 
[[/code]] 
[[/code]]

# In the second phase of the contest, you will be given someone else's Containment Procedures & Object Class to write a Description for. You can, of course, solicit critique for this phase.
 * You may include images and other multimedia in your description. Localize them and any images sent in the Containment Procedures.
 * Addendums are considered to be part of the Description.
 * You may edit the Containment Procedures you receive beyond image localization. Be aware that the submitter of the Containment Procedures should still receive coauthor credit. However, contest runners will look at entries  upon request to determine the extent of each author’s contribution and how much a coauthor’s contribution //needed// to be edited. 
 * If you recognize your containment procedures in someone’s draft, //keep it a secret!// Don’t tell them, or you’ll be disqualified. This does not, of course, extend to plagiarism. If you suspect someone is not your coauthor and has plagiarized your contribution, please contact a contest runner.
# To submit your Description, simply combine it with the containment procedures and post the entry as an SCP to the site. Upon posting, ask a contest runner for the name of your coauthor and have the author metadata updated accordingly.
# This is a //solo contest//. Although you will be coauthoring with someone, your contribution to the corpse must be done by //yourself//. No one entry will have more than 2 coauthors, and no one entrant will have no more than 2 coauthored entries.
# Only minor edits to entries are allowed after posting: spelling, grammar, image localization, etc. Major edits are prohibited until the contest ends. 
 * The rule of thumb is that if you would not do it to another author’s article without their permission, you must wait till after the contest to do it to yours.
# If at any time you feel unable to finish your submission, please let the contest runners know ASAP so they can arrange a pinch hitter for your would-be coauthor!
 
In summary:
* To enter the contest, post in the discussion page with an object class. Safe, Euclid, Keter, Thaumiel, Explained, Neutralized only.
* In about two weeks, you'll get someone's object class. You'll have two weeks to write containment procedures for it, which you will submit to [[*user A Random Day]] or [[*user ProcyonLotor]] directly via Wikidot PM.
* After all the containment procedures are submitted, you'll get someone's object class and someone else's containment procedures. You'll have three weeks to write a description for that and post it on the site as an article.
