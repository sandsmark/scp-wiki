**Item #**: SCP-3892

**Object Class**: Safe

**Special Containment Procedures**: SCP-3892 is to be kept in a standard Safe-class containment locker.

**Description**: SCP-3892 is a child's blanket, colored black and red and patterned with cartoon skulls. Destructive testing has revealed SCP-3892 to be made of a non-anomalous cotton-polyester blend.

SCP-3892's anomalous properties manifest when it is worn by a sleeping child of age 10 or under. Once the subject has reached N1 (earliest) stage sleep, SCP-3892-01 will manifest within 10 meters of SCP-3892 (typically within a closet or hallway in domestic trials).

SCP-3892-01 is a large (approx. 2.3 meters tall) skeletal humanoid figure, dressed in a spiked leather jacket, torn denim trousers, and black motorcycle boots. SCP-3892-01's eye sockets contain yellow lights, and luminous smoke can be seen issuing from its mouth and ribcage.

Upon manifesting, SCP-3892-01 will silently approach the target. The air temperature within a 10 meter radius will warm to approximately 27° C. 

SCP-3892-01 will then tuck the subject into bed, whisper “Good night, (name)"[[footnote]]The subject's first name.[[/footnote]], kiss the subject on the head, then demanifest.

SCP-3892-01 has neither harmed nor awakened any children during testing trials, and instantly demanifests if approached or interrupted.

**Addendum 3892-01**: On 10 May 2018, SCP-3892-01 looked directly into a testing chamber camera after kissing the subject and said "No more cold beds. No more scared kids. Stop fucking with them, and stop fucking with me, or labcoat bedtime is gonna get real shitty, real quick." SCP-3892-01 then loudly cracked each of its knuckles, then demanifested as normal.

SCP-3892-01 has not responded to any attempt at communication by Foundation personnel before or since this event. The significance of this is unknown.
