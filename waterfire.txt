//It has come to my attention that Researcher Waterfire has made a habit of using [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-684347/snippets-from-chat-you-had-to-save-for-all-time-11#post-1874809 mysterious symbols] in his notes regarding Incident-████-█. Though no memetic contamination has been confirmed, his notes have been confiscated as a precaution.//

[[[SCP-1363]]] - Possessed Virus
This was my first skip posted to the mainlist.
When I first wrote it up, it was this awful thing about contagious radiation sickness that made zombies, and had this really poorly executed historical reference. Initially, I had a lot of trouble figuring out what to do with it.
After a long time on the IRC, and about three iterations, I ended up with the disease that makes you talk to dead people.
Not a bad trade, I'd say.

[[[SCP-306]]] - The Frogs
This article was a rewrite of "Frog Rot", by DrGears. The original article is available [http://scpclassic.wikidot.com/scp-306 here].
I volunteered to rewrite this article, largely because it was one of the articles I had liked the most before joining. The biggest issue was trying to make this skip more unusual and interesting. I settled on building off that whole myth that frogs can cause warts, then (sort of) reversed it.
The article almost kicked the bucket within a few hours, but with some quick edits, I was able to keep the article afloat. It's currently hovering at about +20.

[[[SCP-1387]]] - Giant Seagull Airlines
I started writing this article just after finishing 1363, but put it on hold when rewriting 306. Overall, this was probably my favorite article to write.
The biggest problem I had with this article was getting the interview right, which took up the bulk of the time spent on the article. Once I finally got that worked out, the only thing left to do was to post.

[[[SCP-2333]]] - One Week To Live
This article was probably the most odd one posted in the 2000 contest, as it was not based on common Sci-Fi tropes. Instead, I approached the contest as a challenge to write "Fiction about Science."
Well, I wasn't hoping to win anyway.
