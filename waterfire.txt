//It has come to my attention that Researcher Waterfire has made a habit of using [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-684347/snippets-from-chat-you-had-to-save-for-all-time-11#post-1874809 mysterious symbols] in his notes regarding Incident-████-█. Though no memetic contamination has been confirmed, his notes have been confiscated as a precaution.//

[[[SCP-1363]]] - Possessed Virus
This was my first skip posted to the mainlist.
When I first wrote it up, it was this awful thing about contagious radiation sickness that made zombies, and had this really poorly executed historical reference. Initially, I had a lot of trouble figuring out what to do with it.
After a long time on the IRC, and about three iterations, I ended up with the disease that makes you talk to dead people.
Not a bad trade, I'd say.

[[[SCP-306]]] - The Frogs
This article was a rewrite of "Frog Rot", by DrGears. The original article is available [http://scpclassic.wikidot.com/scp-306 here].
I volunteered to rewrite this article, largely because it was one of the articles I had liked the most before joining. The biggest issue was trying to make this skip more unusual and interesting. I settled on building off that whole myth that frogs can cause warts, then (sort of) reversed it.
The article almost kicked the bucket within a few hours, but with some quick edits, I was able to keep the article afloat. --It's currently hovering at about +20-- Somehow it broke +30.

[[[SCP-1387]]] - Giant Seagull Airlines
I started writing this article just after finishing 1363, but put it on hold when rewriting 306. Overall, this was probably my second favorite article to write.
The biggest problem I had with this article was getting the interview right, which took up the bulk of the time spent on the article. Once I finally got that worked out, the only thing left to do was to post.

[[[SCP-2333]]] - One Week To Live
This article was probably the most odd one posted in the 2000 contest, as it was not based on common Sci-Fi tropes. Instead, I approached the contest as a challenge to write "Fiction about Science."
Well, I wasn't hoping to win anyway.

[[[SCP-2033]]] - Coincidental Tree
This skip, which at the time was my favorite one to write, is based on an odd tradition at a school near my house. Basically, people stick their gum onto this tree in the bus loop.
The only thing that I could think of about this tradition was how random it was. I thought, "how can I make it more random?"
The answer was simple: make the tree sing show tunes.

[[[SCP-2123]]] - I Accidentally the Whole Universe
Yes, I am extremely proud of that title. It's still not as good a title as 2137 though (see next tab).
What makes this one my favorite article so far was that fact that it was the first time I felt like I told a cohesive, complex story. Sure, my other articles do have a plot to them, but none of them were quite as complicated.
The idea behind this article, something that turns the universe into antimatter, was an idea I had early on after I joined the site. Actually conveying the idea was a challenge because of just how technical everything got. But I think I was able to do it pretty well.

These are the articles which left the biggest impact on me. Whether they were packed with feels, made me laugh, gave me nightmares, or just had an excellent story, these are the skips that I found most memorable.

There's 23 here because 23 is my favorite number.
