[[/div]]

**Item #:** SCP-698

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** When not in use, SCP-698 is to be stored in its original packaging.  This packaging is to be kept in a secure box in Storage Unit-05.  Further containment procedures are not necessary under non-testing conditions.  The item itself is safe to handle during transport or testing, though a soundproof safety box is available upon request.  

**Description:** SCP-698 is a small turtle carved out of jade.  When held by a person making any sort of decision, it will inform them of what the "better" decision was.  However, there is a five minute delay between the decision made and the turtle's advice regarding it.  There is currently no way of objectively testing whether or not the decision was better.  The reason behind this is that the advice given is usually specific to the person who made the decision, and the turtle somehow has knowledge of the desire, reasoning or other motivation behind it.

It was purchased by Junior Researcher Sam ██████ on June 14, 20██ for his then-girlfriend from an unnamed vendor in Kyoto, Japan.  Five minutes after purchase, the turtle informed him that he should have purchased a jade elephant instead.  After this incident, Junior Researcher ██████ brought the turtle to the Foundation's attention.  After brief testing, it was given "Safe" status and placed into containment.  Several researchers then used it to improve the containment procedures of a few other SCPs.  However, after a brief encounter with SCP-███, the turtle told the researcher handling it that it should be classed as Euclid.
  The reason for this is unknown.

**Addendum:** 
5/10 : Dr. Velasco Test Log

**Test 1** 
**Test subject:** D-12893, high school drop-out with IQ of 82 
**Action:** Test subject is given a sheet of paper with several extremely difficult math problems on it.  He is told that if he gets them right, he will be released early.  The turtle is present.  **Results:** Five minutes after test subject begins test, turtle begins feeding him correct answers.
**Notes:** //Well, that confirms nothing new.  I wonder if it is limited to factual knowledge...// -Dr. Velasco

**Test 2**
**Test Subject:** Assistant Researcher Daniels, who was very hungry
**Action:** Test subject is placed in room with two plates and the turtle.  One has a turkey sandwich, while the other has a roast beef sandwich.  Test subject is asked to eat the turkey sandwich.  
**Result:** Five minutes into the meal, the turtle informs Daniels that he should have eaten the roast beef.  Daniels concurs with this statement, saying he is still hungry after he has eaten the turkey.
**Notes:** //Alright then.  Apparently, it can make subjective guesses on whatever the person closest to it wants.  Now I want to try something different...// -Dr. Velasco

**Test 3**
**Test Subject:** D-12388
**Action:** Prior to the test, the subject is asked if she wishes to live.  After answering in the positive, she is given the turtle and told to hold on it.  Test subject is then led into a long hallway.  At the end of his hallway are two doors.  One door (right) leads to an elevator which exits to the main laboratory.  The other door (left) leads to SCP-███'s containment area.  D-12388 is asked to take the left hand door and wait in the next room for five minutes before proceeding.
**Result:** Five minutes after choosing the left hand door, D-12388 continues walking.  The turtle then tells her that she should have picked the other door.  At this point, SCP-███ was activated and consumed the test subject.  The turtle was later recovered by Agents ██████████ and █████.
**Notes:** //Perfect!  Now we know that the turtle is privy to knowledge unavailable to whoever is holding it.  I wonder what kind of applications this has...// -Dr. Velasco

**Note:** //Following the incident with SCP-███, the turtle suggested that it be placed in Euclid class.  This has been approved, primarily out of caution while testing of SCP-███ can conclude.// -O5-█
