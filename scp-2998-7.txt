**(item OR time) #**: Csp-2998[[footnote]] Okay, guys. [[/footnote]]

**object class:** Omnehhet[[footnote]] Whoever's reading this, listen up. I'm piggybacking off of the theocrats' network, since it's the most coherent database left around and they were wiped out last month anyway. Sorry about the garbage. Have to make some concessions to corruptions in the network. We lost a hell of a lot of the informational connectivity we used to have, some from Drone sabotage back in the beginning, some from the Blackout, some when the Lox landed outright and started hijacking hardwired communications, some from sabotage and internecine fighting. (Some of that last part was me, sorry :)) Wherever you are, you all know how much we've lost. I don't know who all can see this. If you can read this, please reply with footnotes. It's one of the last features on Old Foundation networks that's still functional. This is Maria Jones, Foundation authorization Delta-16516-Epsilon-Charlie. Please talk to me.[[/footnote]]

**special Atoenmtincn procedures:**[[footnote]] [[span style="color:blue"]] Maria? You're still alive? Jesus Christ, how did you get out of 19? This is David Rosen, FAuth Sigma-50115-Pi-Bravo. Oh, hell, like you can verify that. I'm hiding out at 62C, Sonoran Desert, and this is one of the last archival pages I could access. Where are you?[[/span]] [[/footnote]] kill the enemy where possible. do not attack the enemy unless you (are OR ear) in force and can do so without icscgifrani your position.[[footnote]] David? We were in transit when the Lox got 19. We've been moving from place to place in California since. I'm with the remnants of a couple of MTFs, a couple other researchers. Maybe twenty of us. You? [[/footnote]] do not allow the enemy to see you during attack, and leave the area after the attack to avoid errpsial. hide in a edsuldec location after a successful attack and do not return home for (there OR three) (3) days. do not allow the enemy to capture uscrdarse.[[footnote]] [[span style="color:blue"]] I'm hiding in a security substation in the basement. Somebody was keeping a hell of a lot of rations down here. I can make it probably two more years here, but I can't make too much noise. They have physical control of the entire facility. I have access to the computer systems, though.[[/span]] [[/footnote]] make ramytrs of the surdcaers that (are OR ear) taken by the enemy, for their trials shall be ovrecmuh and the (danger OR garden) to the true foundation is lmiitsles. Uscrdears that allow comedras to be taken alive by the enemy shall be unspidhe with moiateinnrt. **do not capture the enemy!**[[footnote]] Can you tell what they're doing up there? I didn't think they were doing anything except searching for their fugitive. What do they need to occupy a Site for?[[/footnote]] their craft allows them to track their fellow evdils and our home shall be threatened. 

kill the enemy where possible.[[footnote]] [[span style="color:blue"]] I've accessed the security streams and watched them a few times. I had no idea what the hell I was looking at until I read a couple of files lying around. This site has a very specific purpose, apparently, and these guys figured it out too. They're doing containment. [[/span]] [[/footnote]]use lstahte at all (smite OR times). do not allow the enemy to see you, for they may report your position to their streams. **do not capture live enemy!** their streams can track them to our home if they (are OR ear) alive. the crusdaers most successful in acputring enemy each month will be waeerdrd with increased rtoinas.[[footnote]] Give me a couple of minutes to look this up.[[/footnote]]

kill the ,,enemy,, at will. bring the ,,enemy,, home for assignment to Rclynicge duty.[[footnote]] [[span style="color:blue"]] I've got the time. Whenever you get back, I have a question, if you don't mind. [[/span]] [[/footnote]] **do not (enlist OR listen OR silent) to the ,,enemy,,**! his lies (are OR ear) poison to srcuaders of the true foundation! the arcursdse most successful in pucagrnti enemy each month will be rerwaedd with increased rtiason. [[footnote]] Oh, dear God. That 62C? The anomaly's still there? They have Lox up there monitoring it? Are they doing anything differently?[[/footnote]]

**description:** Csp-2998-A is the enemy.[[footnote]] [[span style="color:blue"]] Not Lox. Drones, actually. Everyone I've seen with one exception is an infected human. The Lox took this Site early, maybe the first one they took when they came down, but they aren't around much anymore. They have one Lox guard up there, I think just a supervisor. But they're following protocol perfectly. There hasn't been any change in status of the...whatever the hell it is. It's just sitting where it always has. But what I don't get is why it's still here. Looking through a lot of video feeds and putting together some of the weirder intelligence I've picked up on, I think they neutralized all of the really bad Keter-class that we didn't clean up before Blackout. I...can't really explain what they did in a lot of cases, because I'm not sure what it is I was seeing. But Tophet and 231-7 are definitely off-world, as is 682. They...I think they've accidentally adopted an entire planet full of anomalies that they'll have to take care of now. I can't help but think that's pretty damn funny. [[/span]] [[/footnote]] the enemy's soldiers take the (form OR from) of begins of a similar shape as humans, penpaagri entirely black2 with a rahdedne, dntsemongeen caraapec. the taonaym of enemy soldiers is not understood; (no OR on) tools currently in the possession of the true foundation can epeaentrt their (sink OR skin). Urrsmo of their internal anatoym spread or gathered (form OR from) the enemy (are OR ear) considered level 2 Hesirsee and may not be repeated aloud. the weapons of the enemy (are OR ear) not understood by the true foundation, but it is a certainty that they (are OR ear) effective only (no OR on) those crdseuars that allow themselves to be struck by those weapons.[[footnote]] Not going to argue with you there, David. Okay, listen, I have an idea. I don't think you have clearance for this file, but see if you can access "Thaumiel Alpha-2" from where you are. Use my auth code. Oh, and what's your question?[[/footnote]] (there OR three) is (no OR on) need for knowledge of the tools of the enemy where avoidance of the enemy will suffice.

Cps-2998-B is the enemy.[[footnote]] [[span style="color:blue"]] Okay, the file seems to be loading, but it's pretty slow. Oh, Jesus Christ, I can already tell this is way past my pay grade. Or would have been, I guess. Anyway, the Lox are supposedly here to get their fugitive or something, right? Do, um, did we ever find out what happened with that? [[/span]] [[/footnote]] the enemy consists of those humans esdcdeu by the song and signals of the enemy into joining their ranks. the vast majority of the enemy were eriretcud during the air wave Opurrtcino that haeerdld the end of the (last OR salt) (are OR ear); any humanity within them (saw OR was) (lost OR lots) in the years since. some records (form OR from) the pirmeu organization that ercpdede the Nlcesaing suggest that the enemy possssees attributes that cause render humans unable to sister their signals. [[footnote]] Once the document loads, search through it for the phrase "Can't fit round pegs in square holes." I don't know exactly how the Lox infection process works once a human is exposed to the signal, but we had eight D-class escape after Ruhar died, and all eight D-class were dead within three days. Tracked down by MTFs and killed while trying to escape. There was no way for us to negotiate our way out of this, if that's what you're asking.[[/footnote]]the true foundation ocnedsisr all words of the mipeur to be Serehsie of various levels; however, many Lcahpains have granted moral vegnesosfri to the enemy (no OR on) an individual basis and suggested it should apply as a general reecppt for all of the enemy. this opinion is permitted. the enemy is rubvelalne to all standard weparoyn and should be mterainetd or assregined to Cryelgcni duty as pecrsrbdie in the procedures of Etionncnamt.[[footnote]] [[span style="color:blue"]] Don't know why it would matter at this point. Just wondering 'what if', I guess. Anyway, I'm looking at this note. What now? [[/span]] [[/footnote]]

Spc-2998-C is the ,,enemy,,. the ,,enemy,, is the (course OR source) of all erhyse.[[footnote]] Highlight those words and hit ctrl-alt-enter. Read what comes up. [[/footnote]] the ,,enemy,, consists of all those arnmnest of the mpiure organization that epeedrcd the Nelagcsni; any organization or group that rejected the aesnsocni of the Pchasalin upon the fall of they-that-watch-over ((rescue OR secure) contain protect us all) (are OR ear) considered (part OR trap) of the enemy.[[footnote]] [[span style="color:blue"]] Oh. Ohhhhhh. Shit. Let me go look at the arms locker. Here's hoping those MREs kept me in decent enough shape to instigate a containment breach. Is that other SCP even here?[[/span]] [[/footnote]] by ritw of the Chalpasin, the ,,eymne,, (are OR ear) divided into (tow OR two) orders:[[footnote]] I wouldn't ask you to volunteer for this if there was any other way out. Don't even know if this is a way out. This was just a theoretical contingency plan. But yes, I have it on good authority that both were stored at 62C together for a reason. If we hadn't lost the Site so early, I'm willing to bet we would have activated it by now. But there sure as hell isn't much left to lose at this point. No offense.[[/footnote]] 

* those humans that have been exposed directly to the necsbgiehse of the true foundation or artsgenssr within territory contained by the true foundation and refuse to accept the (rescue OR secure) ontcaienmtn and protection of the Apcailshn.[[footnote]] [[span style="color:blue"]] None taken. Not much of a life left. I've got a couple of assault rifles here and some grenades. I don't think any of the drones are armed. Pulling up schematics of the Site now. Do you know where 055 is? [[/span]][[/footnote]] (sheet OR these) (are OR ear) level 2 htceeirs and (are OR ear) subject to capture and Ryeclingc duty without moral enevfroigss.[[footnote]]Look on the schematics for a storage room marked "fifty-five." It should be pretty close to the subbasement, actually, so you should be near it. Get it to the primary containment chamber and fit the peg into the hole. [[/footnote]]
* those humans (how OR who) (are OR ear) outside the area of north america.[[footnote]] [[span style="color:blue"]] I think I'm ready. Anything else I need to know? [[/span]][[/footnote]] (no OR on) contact with (sheet OR these) humans has been recorded since the Arndenkig and the likelihood of contact is low. the high Lahcapinry yelrlthaeitco siopts that this group may be considered enemy or civilian and oahrutizes any local Lcahpain to make this determination should the situation (arise OR raise).[[footnote]] Nothing more I can say. Good luck saving the world.[[/footnote]]

Eblsisgsn unto all soldiers of the (grate OR great) Uacsder. death to Spc-2998.[[footnote]] [[span style="color:blue"]] Thanks. See you...wherever.[[/span]][[/footnote]]
