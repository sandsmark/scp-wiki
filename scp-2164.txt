**Item #:** SCP-2164

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2164-A is to be kept in modified humanoid containment cell. A Foundation expert in Renaissance-era occult practices is to be assigned to SCP-2164-A at all times and review containment procedures every six months. All furnishings in SCP-2164-A's containment chamber are to be made of plastics or synthetic fibers, and //Agrimonia eupatoria// (agrimony) is to be planted along the perimeter of the cell. These plants are to be tended to by maintenance personnel weekly and any ailing plants replaced immediately. All personnel entering SCP-2164 outside of testing scenarios are to don protective garlands of //Laurus nobilis// (Bay laurel) or //Ocimum basilicum// (sweet basil).  Good behavior on SCP-2164-A's part may be rewarded with access to //Salvia officinalis// (Common sage), //Fraxinus excelsior// (European ash), one small white beeswax candle, and other plant and animal materials documented in Document-2164-A. Under no circumstances is SCP-2164-A to be supplied with black candles, //Artemisia absinthum// (Wormwood), //Juniperus communis// (Common juniper), //Santalum album// (Indian sandalwood), //Cedrus libani// (Cedar), //Rosa moschata// (Musk rose), or any of the other restricted herbs or materials listed in Document-2164-A. Female personnel advised to remain cautious around SCP-2164-A.

SCP-2164-B is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. SCP-2164-B's food is to be cultivated on-site to ensure that all its meals are organic, non-genetically modified, and completely gluten-free. SCP-2164-B may be rewarded for cooperation with various small quartz crystals, unprocessed amethysts, turmeric, red ginseng, the use of one yoga mat, and approved reading materials. A Foundation psychiatrist who has been briefed on New Age spirituality is to examine SCP-2164-A under the guise of an "angel therapist" and encourage its cooperation with the Foundation. Only D-class personnel scoring below 115 on the Stanford-Binet IQ Test and below +1σ on the Foundation Expanded Intelligence Test for Non-Anomalous Humans or born before 1994 are approved for testing with SCP-2164-B.

Under no circumstances are SCP-2164-A and SCP-2164-B to come within 100 meters of each other unless separated by soundproofed walls and accompanied by experts in negotiation.

**Description:** SCP-2164 is a phenomenon manifesting within a one meter radius of two humanoid entities. Within SCP-2164's event radius, scientific laws as commonly understood break down and can be manipulated according to set principles by the humanoids within SCP-2164.

SCP-2164-A is an elderly Caucasian male appearing around eighty years of age but claiming to be about ███ years old. SCP-2164-A can manipulate matter within its range of effect using occult rituals or herbal concoctions in the Renaissance tradition. All reality alterations (herbal mixtures, incantations, etc.) lose their effect outside the SCP-2164 effect radius.

SCP-2164-B is a Caucasian female in her early thirties formerly known as Jennifer █████████. SCP-2164-B spent its life before Foundation recovery in Orange County, California. SCP-2164-B can perform small reality alterations with the aid of common crystals and non-corporeal entities, as well as heal various illnesses using homeopathic techniques. It also displays anomalous knowledge of subjects within its effect radius. As with SCP-2164-A, these effects reverse outside the SCP-2164 zone.

SCP-2164-A and -B have knowledge of and are mildly antagonistic towards each other.


**Tests Involving SCP-2164-A**

__**Test 1**__
> **Procedure:** SCP-2164-A given 20 g each mercury, powdered iron oxide, lead(II) chromate, calcium carbonate, charcoal, 99.99% pure gold leaf, a crucible, and a pelican vessel.
> **Results:** SCP-2164-A took all provided materials except gold. Over the course of four weeks, SCP-2164-A conducted a complex series of alchemical procedures including [DATA EXPUNGED BY ORDER OF O5 COMMAND]. Resultant object leaks clear amber-colored fluid, which SCP-2164-A claims has a strong rejuvenation factor. Fluid administered to 75 year old D-Class with advanced Parkinson's Disease and chronic rheumatoid arthritis. Subject's tremors and joint pain vanished and subject displayed drastically increased visual clarity and endurance. All restorative effects of the fluid reverse when subject leaves SCP-2164. Subject terminated after resisting attempts to remove it from SCP-2164.

__**Test 2**__
> **Procedure:** Fluid from previous test taken outside SCP-2164-A's event radius and administered to 32 year old D-class with Parkinson's.
> **Results:** No initial effect. When D-class is brought within SCP-2164, tremors vanish and subject displays extra strength and improved focus. Restorative effects vanish when subject is removed from SCP-2164.

__**Test 3**__
> **Procedure:** SCP-2164-A given various common essential oils and dried herbs, along with one copper kettle.
> **Results:** SCP-2164-A chose one vial each of //Rosa moschata// oil (Musk rose), //Lavandula angustifolia// oil (Common lavender), //Cinnamomum verum// oil (cinnamon), and dried //Quercus robur// (English oak) leaves. SCP-2164-A waited until first day of the waxing moon before boiling the mixture in the kettle. Audio surveillance shows SCP-2164-A chanting periodically in an obscure dialect of Latin. SCP-2164-A then attempted to lure Junior Researcher Aaliyah Freeman into its event radius, claiming the fluid would increase her intelligence and attractiveness to male personnel. Junior Researcher Freeman alerted Senior Researcher Eric Stanton. D-23944 was dispatched and compelled to drink the fluid over the objections of SCP-2164-A. Subject immediately fell to the floor in front of SCP-2164-A, threw her arms around its ankles, and began to profess her infatuation with it. Effect disappeared outside SCP-2164 only to reappear when D-23944 re-enters perimeter. D-23944 expresses revulsion towards SCP-2164-A when outside effect radius. SCP-2164-A's privileges are revoked and containment procedures updated.

//This is ridiculous. SCP-2164-A's actions hardly present a breach risk if the effect reverses a few steps away. Discipline him for this infraction but we could still benefit from testing him. -Senior Researcher Eric Stanton//

//Request granted -Site Director Jacob DeLozier//

__**Test 4**__
> **Procedure:** SCP-2164-A requests round black wax pendant, essential oils of //Juniperus communis// (Common juniper), //Santalum album// (Indian Sandalwood), and //Cedrus libani// (cedar), and a small dagger made entirely of silver. Request granted with the exception of the dagger.
> **Results:** SCP-2164-A carved an intricate symbol into the black wax with a fingernail before anointing it with each of the three supplied oils. SCP-2164-A then tucked the wax into its pocket, anointed its left index and middle fingers with the remaining oil, and chanted in an unidentified language. Research Assistant Mark Wagner was accosted by SCP-2164-A and convinced to enter SCP-2164 in exchange for a power charm and control of the site. Once Research Assistant Wagner entered SCP-2164, SCP-2164-A touched him with his left index and middle finger while repeating its earlier chant. Wagner's higher brain functions immediately ceased, leaving Wagner unconscious but highly open to suggestion. SCP-2164-A moved to the edge of its cell and commanded Wagner to uproot the //Agrimonia eupatoria// hedge. The Foundation occult specialist and containment expert at the time, Dr. Elizabeth Perry, retrieved seven sprigs of basil from the site cafeteria and entered SCP-2164. When SCP-2164-A attempted to touch Dr. Perry, it lost consciousness, enabling Dr. Perry to retrieve Wagner. Wagner revived once outside SCP-2164, and SCP-2164-A regained consciousness thirty minutes later. Mark Wagner was demoted to Level 0 personnel, Senior Researcher Eric Stanton was issued a formal reprimand, and Dr. Perry was recognized for her quick thinking in preventing a containment breach.

__**Test 5**__
> **Procedure:** To test whether any sapient being could manipulate reality within SCP-2164, Dr. Elizabeth Perry entered SCP-2164 wearing one long purple tunic, one wreath of basil, and one tapered, sanded branch of //Ilex aquafolium// (Common holly) engraved with the astrological symbols for the seven planets.
> **Results:** SCP-2164-A produced a beam of glowing red light and aimed it at Dr. Perry. Dr. Perry chanted a Latin charm against evil and successfully deflected the beam with the //Ilex aquafolium// branch. The beam exited SCP-2164 and vanished. SCP-2164-A registered shock at this development. Dr. Perry chastised SCP-2164-A, referring to Foundation containment as "Limbo" and punishment for misuse of its powers. SCP-2164-A expressed remorse and has since fully adjusted to containment.



**Tests Involving SCP-2164-B**

__**Test 1**__
> **Procedure:** SCP-2164-B given a 20 mL vial of thyroxine, three seven-liter jugs of distilled water, and a one liter water bottle with a screw-on cap.
> **Results:** SCP-2164-B poured one liter of distilled water into the bottle and diluted 1 mL thyroxine in it before sealing the bottle and succussing it ten times against its open palm. After succussion it disposed of 990 mL water/thyroxine solution and mixed 990 mL fresh water into the bottle before succussing it again. SCP-2164-B repeated the process until all jugs of distilled water were empty. When questioned about the number of dilutions SCP-2164-B tilted its head and replied that it hated "weak-ass cures". It then administered mL of the diluted solution to D-99746, suffering from advanced Graves' disease with pronounced exophtalmos. D-99746's eyes immediately retreated back into their normal position in their sockets. Subject no longer experienced tremors and CT scans within the effect radius showed subject's thyroid had shrunk back to a healthy size. Effect reversed once subject left SCP-2164. Testing of the solution both inside and outside the effect radius showed that no molecules of the original thyroxine remained in the solution.

__**Test 2**__
> **Procedure:** D-3047 brought into effect radius. Subject has no known medical conditions.
> **Results:** Subject immediately takes on a dulled affect. SCP-2164-B attempts to engage subject in conversation. Subject demonstrates severe echolalia and begins to vigorously flap his hands. Symptoms reverse outside effect radius. Repeated tests with various D-class show a 55% occurrence of the phenomenon, with tests involving low-level Foundation personnel showing occurrences up to 85%. Upon reviewing medical records of test subjects, it was determined that about 60% of subjects who have received all recommended vaccinations displayed the above symptoms. When asked, SCP-2164-B rolled her eyes and stated "Love them, protect them, never inject them" in an exasperated tone. SCP-XXXX-B refused to elaborate further.

__**Test 3**__
> **Procedure:** D-34875 and a pack of "Angel Cards" sent into SCP-2164 to test SCP-2164-B's clairvoyant properties. The Angel Cards are a 44-card "oracle deck" devised by a self-proclaimed "angel therapist". Each card has the picture of angel and one or two sentences of an "angel message". Messages are uniformly vague and uninformative.
> **Results:** SCP-2164-B greeted D-34875, shuffled the cards, and called upon a group of non-corporeal entities it referred to as "guardian angels" to guide its hand. SCP-2164-B drew the Aimee card (I am your angel, Aimee. I represent the ones who hold you dearest), the Bethany card (I am Bethany, the angel of indulgence. Remember to take care of yourself), the Scholastica card (I am Scholastica, guardian of all seekers of knowledge), the Dolores card (I am Dolores, angel of tribulation. I am here to guide you through all life's struggles to make your spirit stronger), and the Azrael card (I am Azrael, angel of death and rebirth. Do not fear me, for all death is simply change, and I am here to comfort you no matter what change comes your way). SCP-2164-B was able to correctly deduce that the subject was protected from abuse and neglect by his mother's sister until her death when the subject was ten, that the subject was convicted for the murders of his two children under the influence of drugs, that the subject's purpose was to aid the Foundation in gathering knowledge about paranormal objects including itself and an SCP-[REDACTED] not yet cataloged, that the only obstacle towards this purpose was the subject's fear and mistrust of the Foundation, and that the subject would be dead about two weeks from that date. Interviews and the subject's criminal records confirmed SCP-2164-B's deductions. Seventeen days after this test, SCP-[REDACTED] was recovered by Foundation personnel. After several experiments failed to gain any understanding of SCP-[REDACTED]'s properties, Senior Researcher Xuan Chang proposed testing with D-34875. The first test involving D-34875 and SCP-[REDACTED] was instrumental in the Foundation's current understanding of SCP-[REDACTED], especially its reaction [DATA EXPUNGED]. When D-34875 was terminated, he expressed a calm awareness of the nature of the termination process and did not resist, stating that he'd "done what [he] came here to do".

__**Test 4**__
> **Procedure:** D-80044 was introduced to SCP-2164-B. D-80044 was born in 1994 and scored a 145 on the Stanford-Binet IQ Test and a +3.3σ on the Foundation Expanded Intelligence Test for Non-Anomalous Humans. D-80044 was twenty years old at the time of the experiment.
> **Results:** [DATA EXPUNGED] After killing ten guards, three researchers, and critically injuring the site director, D-800044 was ambushed by Junior Researcher Maekawa who managed to disengage the unconscious SCP-2164-B from D-80044's back. As the two separated, D-80044 reverted to his usual mental abilities and was summarily terminated. SCP-2164-B was successfully revived and treated for minor injuries. Although SCP-2164-B was physically unharmed, the incident caused it to sink into a state of depression for weeks afterward. SCP-2164-B made statements during this time such as, "How could this happen? His aura was so blue", "The children were supposed to bring peace", and "I thought I could help him achieve his true potential". SCP-2164-B has since recovered, but it refuses to interact with individuals matching the parameters in the containment procedures.

**Incident Log 2164-1**
SCP-2164-A and SCP-2164-B were introduced to each other in a controlled testing scenario. The following is an audio transcript of the encounter.

  
> **<Begin Log>**
>  
> **SCP-2164-B:** Hey! What the fuck are you doing here?
>  
> **SCP-2164-A:** Undoing the mockery unto nature that thou hast wrought. It is not a light endeavor, I assure thee.
>  
> **SCP-2164-B:** Mockery unto nature my //ass//. I can't believe these people haven't blasted you to smithereens. You're ruining everything, you know that?
>   
> **SCP-2164-A:** I know, strumpet, that I have been chosen to usher in a new age of fantastical things. The reign of angels and demons, of sprites and spirits, is nigh. My charge is to remake the world, and save it from the likes of charlatans such as thee.
> 
> **SCP-2164-B:** Charlatans?! I'm trying to save the world! We don't want any part of your dark ritual bullshit! Didn't you guys, like, cover you in leeches if you had a cough? Now we know if Monsanto kept their evil little fingers off our food we wouldn't even //have// coughs. This is the future, Methuselah. We're enlightened, higher beings now. No way I'll let the Age of Aquarius be stained with your blood sacrifice nonsense!
> 
> **SCP-2164-A:** This "Monsanto" warlock you speak of is foreign to me. How could he hex men of my day if he is of your era?
> 
> **SCP-2164-B:** Well, it's not just them. Everyone knows you guys had *way* low vibrations because of all that witch burning and Black Plague. You got everything wrong about guardian angels too! Like, with all your hellfire-and-brimstone shit? Us evolved people know angels are, like, all about love and peace and self-acceptance and stuff.
> 
> **SCP-2164-A:** May Albertus Magnus and all his disciples be blind to your ignorance! The angels of heaven are far more terrifying beings than your tame, lily-livered shades. Thine milk-minded //pets// of yours bear no true semblance to the servants of the Most High!
> 
> **SCP-2164-B:** That's it! I've had it with your psycho mumbo jumbo! You're about to get your chakras *all* out of alignment!
>
>
> **<End Log>**
>  
> 
> **Closing Statement:** //SCP-2164-A and SCP-2164-B charged into each other's SCP-2164 effect radius. SCP-2164-A was observed to raise his staff and shout a Latin incantation to Azrael, the angel of Death, as SCP-2164-B rolled her eyes upwards into their sockets, faced her palms towards SCP-2164-A, and vocalized a low "ohm". Observers of both the event itself and the video footage express extreme psychological distress after this point. Under extreme sedation, observers report simultaneously witnessing both SCP-2164-A's curse hitting SCP-2164-B directly in the sternum and killing her and watching SCP-2164-A suffer a massive aneurysm and collapse dead with SCP-2164-B victorious. Observers then report that both SCP-2164-A and -B appear blurry and out of focus [DATA EXPUNGED] fifteen separate simultaneous sightings of SCP-2164-A and -B throughout the site [DATA EXPUNGED] reported sightings of SCP-2164-A and -B falling up walls [DATA EXPUNGED].
> 
> [DATA EXPUNGED]
> 
> After three hours, SCP-2164 containment was reëstabilshed. Containment procedures updated accordingly.//
