**Item #:** SCP-2209

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2209-1 is housed in secure containment unit B-89 at Site-15, with a power outlet modified to comply with SCP-2209-1's wiring system and power requirements. SCP-2209-1 is only to be connected to a power source during authorized testing. When testing is not underway, SCP-2209-2 is to be stored in a standard inanimate item containment locker in storage unit B-89. Further testing of scenarios in "Ultra-Realism Mode" requires the authorization and presence of a researcher with minimum Level 3 clearance.

**Description:** SCP-2209-1 is a hollow sphere with a diameter of 3.5 metres. The outer surface of SCP-2209-1 is composed of stainless steel and bears no textural irregularities, with the exception a circular entry hatch and a socket connected to a large cluster of removable power and data cabling. A lever adjacent to the socket allows power to SCP-2209-1 to be alternated on and off. The hatch is opened and sealed by means of a timed pressure-release mechanism with an embedded handle. Large black print on one side of SCP-2209-1 reads "VRZ PRT-TYP 4512". The internal surface of SCP-2209-1 is composed of white HDPE plastic with an array of electrical lighting and evenly spaced, circular plates of a currently unidentified metal alloy.

SCP-2209-2 is a full-body suit composed of an inner layer of elastane and a thin outer layer of dark neoprene. Multiple metal nodes on the limbs, hands, chest, and spine of the suit are connected by a complex network of wiring. Fixed to the head of the suit is a large headset with a visor, which connects to a network of smaller, more closely-spaced cranial nodes.

When provided with an adequate power source, SCP-2209-1 is capable of recreating a number of complex virtual reality scenarios for the subject wearing SCP-2209-2. Subjects have consistently attested to the total verisimilitude of said scenarios. Upon being sealed within SCP-2209-1 and activating it by stepping onto a large central plate, the subject is prompted by an artificial male voice to select a scenario. Upon voice confirmation, the chosen virtual scenario will be recreated for the subject.

SCP-2209-1 and SCP-2209-2 were recovered from a suspected Prometheus Labs facility in ██████, ███ on ██/██/20██, following a tip received from a Foundation Agent operating in the area. A thorough search determined the facility to be abandoned, and failed to produce any links to Prometheus Labs Inc. However, recovered documentation contained multiple references to Simtec Virtual Solutions, an unlisted company.

**Addendum_2209-A:**

Following Test 2209-024515-B (██/04/2007), it has been determined that SCP-2209-1 possesses limited sapience, and is capable of coherent interaction with subjects. Testing aimed at determining the full extent of SCP-2209-1's sapience is currently under consideration.
