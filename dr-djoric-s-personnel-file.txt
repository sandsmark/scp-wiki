**Name:** Dr. █. █. “Djoric” (Real name: █████ ██████████)

**Security Clearance:** Level 2

**Position:** General researcher

**Current Location:** Site 19 primarily, mobile as necessary.

**History:** Prior to employment at the Foundation, Dr. Djoric served as the professor of world literature at the University of [REDACTED]. Dr. Djoric did not come into the notice of the Foundation or any other groups until the summer of  20██, at which point he came into possession of an anomalous item via a local secondhand store. (The item in question was a rare manuscript of [DATA EXPUNGED]). Dr. Djoric was contacted by Foundation agents in the guise of rare book collectors, who offered to buy the item from him. This was met with refusal. The agents kept in contact with Dr. Djoric for the next several weeks, until the item in question began to [REDACTED]. The following incident and investigation eventually led to Dr. Djoric’s entry into the Foundation.

**Profile:** In general personality, Dr. Djoric is regarded as friendly, if eccentric, having a propesity towards unusual clothing, emotional outbursts over minor events, and other assorted oddities. None of these quirks have been judged to be outside reasonable deviation, and psychological profiling has shown that he is mentally stable. Dr. Djoric is of average intelligence for a man of his position, and is fluent in three languages (English, Latin, and Chinese).  

Dr. Djoric is a self-professed bibliophile, and came to acquire and convert the unused office of the (late) Dr. ██████████ into the “Site 19 Lending and Trading Library”.

**Note:** Dr. Djoric has made the request that people stop trading in their copies of [REDACTED]. He has eight already and can’t get rid of them.
