**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4021 is to be contained in a Size-1 [[footnote]] 9m x 12m x 12m. [[/footnote]] Anomaly greenhouse with multiple growing beds for use by SCP-4021-2. SCP-4021-1 is to be misted for one hour daily with fresh water, and requires at least 7 hours per day of either artificial or natural sunlight. Personnel Level 1 or higher are permitted to interact with SCP-4021-2 and the crops they tend. Plant seeds are to be provided to SCP-4021-2 in order to keep instances content.


**Description:** The classification of SCP-4021 is applicable to two different entities:

SCP-4021-1 is a 7m tall mandarin orange (//Citrus reticulata//) tree.

SCP-4021-2 are sapient mandarin fruits with limbs that appear to be made of material analogous to non-anomalous plant stalk matter, with a series of interior organs that function similarly to ones found in humans. The average height for an SCP-4021-2 instance is 2.34 meters tall. SCP-4021-2 instances are gradually produced from SCP-4021-1. SCP-4021-1 appears to self-regulate the amount of SCP-4021-2 instances, maintaining a population that does not exceed 17 at any given time. When initially contained, the maximum population of SCP-4021-2 instances alive at one time dropped from 73 to 17, as evident from photograph taken at SCP-4021's initial retrieval site. Cause of this is unknown. SCP-4021-2 are typically peaceful and gentle, and seem to enjoy conversation amongst other SCP-4021-2 instances. SCP-4021-2 pray daily at dawn, and during births of SCP-4021-2 instances. The frequency of these praying rituals have been observed to be gradually increasing over time, sometimes straying from the common times when they pray.

While there are 17 SCP-4021-2 instances in existence, SCP-4021-1 seems to cease producing fruit until an SCP-4021-2 instance has expired, the remaining SCP-4021-2 instances have completed their burial ritual, and sufficient time has transpired for the buried instance to have completely rotted, typically 6-7 weeks. SCP-4021-2 has been found to have a sense of sight, taste, and hearing, however it is unknown if they have a sense of smell and touch. When an instance of SCP-4021-2 expires, the other instances of SCP-4021-2 will pick up the dead specimen and bury it under SCP-4021-1. When SCP-4021-2 instances are not tending to their crops, they are seen conversing with each other or staring outside of the containment area for long periods of time.

SCP-4021-2 are able to engage in communication through mouth-like structures. These structures seem to have an organ resembling a tongue. The language SCP-4021-2 instances speak is unknown. SCP-4021-2 instances have shown a significant interest in gardening, having been observed tending to all fruit crops in their containment cell. [[footnote]]Crops not classified as fruit were ignored by SCP-4021-2.[[/footnote]] The harvested crops have been tested by Foundation personnel and have shown no anomalous effects. When crops ready to be harvested, SCP-4021-2 instances will allow personnel to take as much as they want, provided that the fruit taken is not part of the orange family.

SCP-4021-1 routinely produces an average of 13.2 mL of transparent liquid, which has been found to have a consistent molecular structure with glucose. SCP-4021-2 instances have been observed drinking the liquid soon after the secretions occur, and it is hypothesized that this is all the nourishment that SCP-4021-2 requires.

**Additional note dated 04/22/██:** Proportionally less conversation and overall activity has been noticed between the SCP-4021-2 instances. It has also been noticed that SCP-4021-2 have not been tending to the crops within their containment chamber as often as usual, which requires assigned personnel take their place as caretakers to the crops.

**Additional note dated 05/03/██:** The population of SCP-4021-2 instances has decreased to 13, despite sufficient time having elapsed for SCP-4021-1 to produce further "offspring". The cause for this is currently unknown.

**Additional note dated 05/28/██:** SCP-4021-2 instances have been observed spending a significantly increased amount of time near the entrance to the containment area. Furthermore, the observed instances have begun taking on a more "wilted" appearance than previously noted. No signs of disease found.

**Additional note dated 06/19/██:** The population of SCP-4021-2 instances has again decreased to 9, despite sufficient time having elapsed for SCP-4021-1 to produce further "offspring". This population decrease has created cause for concern, and a request will be submitted for an eventual reclassification to Neutralized if trends have been observed to continue.
