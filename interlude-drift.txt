> = **0855, 9/18/19██** - Command Site-206 receives a transmission from SCPS //Jonah//. SCPS //Jonah//, formerly USS ████████, had recently been sent to the █████ █████████ archipelago with MTF Gamma-6 to investigate unusual phenomena around the area.
     
> **Ɣ6-0204:** This is ████ ███████ of Mobile Task Force Gamma-6, designation 0204, sending from SCPS //Jonah//. We think we've discovered the nature of the anomaly.
> 
> **Operator:** This is Command Site-206. What's the nature of your discovery, ███████?
> 
> **Ɣ6-0204:** Well, we have a doctor here, a Dr. ████████, who says the islands, uh, moved.
> 
> **Operator:**         Repeat that?
> 
> **Ɣ6-0204:** Command, they moved. A whole three kilometers. Dr. ████████ thought it might have just been some weird continental drift or something - the islands get tremors pretty frequently - but we went and did a full reconnaissance of the islands. We're pretty sure we know what happened.
>  
> **Operator:** And?
>  
> **Ɣ6-0204:** The islands aren't rock, Command. They're organic. Like, //alive//.
>  
> **Operator:** What exactly do you mean by that?
> 
> **Ɣ6-0204:** Alive, sir. We had a few people dive down and check the rock below. It's the same as low as we can go. We, uh, we think it's on top of something.
> 
> **Operator:** Stand by.
> 
> **Ɣ6-0204:** Roger.
> 
> **Dr. ████:** Gamma-6, this is Dr. ████. I've been told of the nature of your discovery. Resources are now en route to your position. Very specialized resources, with specialized equipment and specialized personnel.
> 
> **Ɣ6-0204:** Dr. ████, we still have men out on the islands. We're armed with researchers. We're fully capable of continuing investigation.
> 
> **Dr. ████:** Gamma-6, your assignment is, as of now, to maintain current position and await further orders. Please retrieve your team on the islands and wait for the arrival of SCPS //Guardian//. That is all.
> 
> **Ɣ6-0204:** Yes, sir.
