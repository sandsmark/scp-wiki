**Blackguard Feed 087-104**

> **1-1404** //MTF-Ω1 (Blackguards), enters Sublevel-C3 from Stairwell 46.//
> 
> MTF-Ω1-1: Stairwell 46 has become choked with debris. We are unable to proceed further. We will begin sterilizing Sublevel-C3 and head down through this section's sublevels from here.
> 
> OP-Ω1-1: Operator confirms.
> 
> **1-1407** //MTF-Ω1-4 and MTF-Ω1-5 open the electrical junction box for Sublevel-C3, revealing the interior circuitry, having since been heavily infested by SCP-229 and partially converted into a biological substrate by the effects of SCP-890. MTF-Ω1-4 begins severing SCP-229 using an oxyacetylene torch.//
> 
> **1-1408** //Lighting fails in Hallway 67, MTF-Ω1 members activate helmet-mounted maglites. Electrical disturbances in Sublevel-C3 begin increasing in intensity.//
> 
> **1-1410** //MTF-Ω1-4 has dislodged roughly 50 percent of the SCP-229 infestation.//
> 
> MTF-Ω1-6: Did you hear that? [Insufficient Audio to Confirm]
> 
> //MTF-Ω1-6 and MTF-Ω1-7 begin moving down Hallway 67, using the ignition flame of their XFOF7s to provide additional illumination.//
> 
> MTF-Ω1-7: We got the front, one-five.
> 
> **1-1411** //All electronic systems in Sublevel-C3 fail simultaneously. Wires and cabling begin erupting from the walls around MTF-Ω1, severally wounding MTF-Ω1-4. MTF-Ω1-6 and MTF-Ω1-7 barrage numerous SCP-229 instances with chemical fire propellant. MTF-Ω1-1 engages masses of wires in melee combat with a trench knife, while pulling MTF-Ω1-4 to relative safety.//
> 
> MTF-Ω1-1 [EXPLETIVE] they got the [EXPLETIVE] Intel wrong again. Since when has 229 been prehensile?!
> 
> //MTF-Ω1-2 retrieves oxyacetylene torch and continues severing the main junction box. MTF-Ω1-3 covers MTF-Ω1-2's position from the southern flank.//
> 
> **1-1412** //Instances of SCP-229 lose much of their cohesion as the main junction box is largely destroyed. Instances are observed to infest each other, however by this time the SCP-229 population has been decimated by sustained fire from MTF-Ω1-6 and MTF-Ω1-7.//
> 
> **1-1413** //Remaining SCP-229 entities rendered combat ineffective. MTF-Ω1-4 given first-aid, administered painkillers and an analgesic wrap to wounds sustained to the left arm and torso. MTF-Ω1-6 and MTF-Ω1-7 begin standard mop-up procedure while MTF-Ω1-1 through MTF-Ω1-5 begin searching for survivors and SCP objects.//
> 
> **1-1424** //MTF-Ω1 exits Sublevel C-3.//
