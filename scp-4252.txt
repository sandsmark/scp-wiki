**Item #:** SCP-XXXX
    
**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-XXXX-A is held in an airtight, windowless room, structurally disconnected from Site-46. The room filters into a 200,000L drum buried below Site-46. 

On the first of every month, SCP-XXXX's activation phrase, as found on SCP-XXXX-B, should be vocalized. Upon the manifestation of SCP-XXXX, all personnel present must bow, refer to it as "Lord Jethusent", and each recite one of the complimentary phrases provided below:

* "You are so wise, Lord Jethusent"
* "You are so brave, Lord Jethusent"
* "You are so kind, Lord Jethusent"
* "You are so small, Lord Jethusent"
* "You are so pure, Lord Jethusent"
* "Lord Jethusent, you spoil us with your grace"
* "Your smallness is immensely large, oh Jethusent the Mighty King"
* "I am lucky to be in your presence, Lord Jethusent"
* "Long live Lord Jethusent"

Once SCP-XXXX gives the command, all personnel are to avert their eyes, and all cameras are to be temporarily disabled for the duration of 30 seconds, at which point cameras are to be re-enabled and all activities are to resume as usual.

**Description:** SCP-XXXX-A refers to a collection of four objects, hereby referred to as SCP-XXXX-A1, SCP-XXXX-A2, SCP-XXXX-A3, and SCP-XXXX-A4, all of which are filled with baked beans. SCP-XXXX-A1 is a clock, identical to a Bernard Products brand quartz wall clock. SCP-XXXX-A2 is a brown leather briefcase of unknown make. SCP-XXXX-A3 is a cardboard coffee cup sporting the Starbucks Coffee Company logo. SCP-XXXX-A4 is a 2015 Toyota Highlander. Prior to Incident XXXX.1, all four objects had the same anomalous properties, but following the event, SCP-XXXX-A1 has been neutralized.

SCP-XXXX-A2, SCP-XXXX-A3, and SCP-XXXX-A4 infinitely produce baked beans via unknown methods. Probing the interiors has found no evidence of any physical passage through which the baked beans enter, indicating that they manifest directly within the objects. There is no known way to stop the beans from being produced. Without the help of SCP-XXXX, the beans would breach containment in less than three months. 

SCP-XXXX is a humanoid entity no more than half a meter tall. It wears a long, silk robe covered in jewels, and a crown made of bronze, with a single, ruby ovoid in the center. SCP-XXXX is able to manifest and demanifest, however, prior to Incident XXXX.1, it was only ever observed to appear when a magical phrase, found on SCP-XXXX-B, was spoken.

SCP-XXXX-B is a fabric ribbon of unknown origin. Written across the face, in gold sequins, is the following phrase:
> Jethusent the Mighty King
> Please bless our presence with your own
> Consume our Bubbling Beanous Bile
> From up atop your sparkling throne

Once every month, when the phrase is spoken out loud, SCP-XXXX will manifest nearby and request all those around it to bow and shower it with compliments. It will become increasingly agitated if these needs are not met swiftly, and has threatened to demanifest following further noncompliance. 

Once SCP-XXXX is satisfied with the bowing and compliments, it will locate SCP-XXXX-A and procede to consume all of the baked beans that have been produced. However, personnel attempting to monitor this, either through direct observation or via camera recording, are met with a request by SCP-XXXX to stop watching it, as it "can't do it when people are looking". Because of this, no visual evidence exists of SCP-XXXX's removal of the baked beans, but audio recordings indicate extremely loud and nauseating slurping noises. When all the beans are removed, SCP-XXXX will demanifest, leaving with a forceful belch, the loudest of which has measured at well over 120 decibels. Attempting to summon SCP-XXXX again by means of its activation phrase are met with a dial tone, and a voice recording of SCP-XXXX indicating that it is "not ready yet, give me like a month and I'll get back to you". Further attempts result in just a dial tone.

**Incident XXXX.1:**
[[collapsible show="Show Video Log XXXX.1" hide="Hide Video Log XXXX.1"]]
> **22:02:19:04 04-06-2019**
> //A humanoid figure, similar in size to SCP-XXXX, but with a tall pointed hat and a blue robe, manifests in SCP-XXXX-A's containment room. It looks frantically around before removing a long, red wand from a pocket in its robe. It points the object at SCP-XXXX-A1 and a bolt of green light shoots out of it, hitting SCP-XXXX-A1.//
>
> **22:02:38:27 04-06-2019**
> //SCP-XXXX manifests and tackles the figure. They wrestle for 30 seconds, at which point the intruder grabs SCP-XXXX's arm and breaks it. SCP-XXXX screams, kicks the figures head, and continues to do so until it stops moving. SCP-XXXX steps away to breathe, then collapses on the ground in front of the figure's body and begins to sob heavily.//
>
> **22:04:13:10 04-06-2019**
> //SCP-XXXX collects itself, and leans over the body of the figure. It gingerly closes the body's eyes, whispers something inaudible, grabs the corpse, and demanifests.//

//Note: Following this incident, SCP-XXXX-A1 remains in a neutralized state. SCP-XXXX continues to manifest as usual, but where its right arm was previously, there is now a mechanical replacement limb.//
