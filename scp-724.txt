**Item #:** SCP-724

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to its immobility, SCP-724 is located in the central vault of Site 54.  This vault is surrounded by a set of hinged shielding plates that can be closed to block signals from reaching SCP-724, and thus suppress the anomaly.

Site 54 maintains the outward appearance of a corporate office/research facility, in the name of a Foundation front company (S██████ C██ P███████, Inc.).  The lobby is to be staffed by Foundation security personnel posing as civilian receptionists and security guards.

**Description:** SCP-724 is a radiokinetic anomaly, located near the intersection of Interstate ██ and Route █ in ██████, ██.  It occurs only when all of the surrounding radio towers (designated SCP-724-1 through SCP-724-█) are broadcasting actively, and when the signals from these towers are able to reach the anomaly's location without significant interference.

While the anomaly is active, sounds emanate from its location, despite having no visible source.  These sounds have been found to correspond to radio transmissions from sources other than the towers surrounding SCP-724.  Transmissions captured by SCP-724 have been confirmed to originate from numerous locations throughout the Northern Hemisphere, and occur in a wide frequency band (a log of identified transmission sources can be found in Document 724-█).  Which transmission is intercepted appears to depend upon the incident signals triggering the anomaly; adjustments to the power and/or frequency band settings of the surrounding towers alter the location and tuning of the anomaly's remote "receiver".

**Addendum 724-1:** SCP-724 first occurred in 19██, when SCP-724-█ (the most recently-constructed tower) began broadcasting.  Foundation agents secured the site after investigation confirmed reports of "phantom voices" at the location.  The relationship between the surrounding radio towers was discovered when SCP-724-3 was taken offline for maintenance and the anomaly consequently ceased activity during the maintenance period.  After extensive discussion, it was decided to allow the towers producing SCP-724 to continue transmitting.

Research is ongoing to identify the relevant factors in the generation of the SCP-724 anomaly, so that no further anomalies are accidentally created.  A better understanding of the effects of the various contributing factors could also have significant practical utility in surveillance and communications applications.
