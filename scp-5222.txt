[[/div]]**Item #:** SCP-5222

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the latent abilities of people and things under the SCP-5222 designation or any sub-designations thereof, containment chambers shall be highly reinforced against pressure waves and, if facilities permit, entropy set to minimum[[footnote]]This is typically 500 µJ/K but may go as low as 5 µJ/K in EVERGREEN-class sites.[[/footnote]]. If entropy is not adjustable at the current site of the contained entities, please make arrangements with your site director to relocate the entities to a variable-entropy site via BOUNCE.

Any reports of ruggedly handsome men in sunglasses walking away from fiery explosions in slow motion should be cross-checked against GOI-2666.

**Description:** SCP-5222 is a collective designation for people (sub-designation α) and objects (sub-designation β) associated with Lord Explosion's Pyrotechnic Playground and Daycare[[footnote]]RAISA Link: [[span style="color: maroon; cursor: help"]]Bearpuncher Solutions (GOI-2666) and subsidiaries. (KB 11.2666)[[/span]][[/footnote]], a Type-16 Pocket Dimension[[footnote]]RAISA Link: [[span style="color: maroon; cursor: help"]]Types of Traversable Discrete Dimensions (KB 114)[[/span]][[/footnote]] and Multi-Tenant Conceptual Mindscape[[footnote]]RAISA Link: [[span style="color: maroon; cursor: help"]]T. Rutherford, //Shared Experiences across Multiple Sapient Beings: A Primer// (KB 4338)[[/span]][[/footnote]]. There are currently {{26}} different SCP-5222-α entities catalogued, and {{none}} contained. There are currently {{1326}} different SCP-5222-β items catalogued, and {{none}} contained.

**Discovery:** SCP-5222 was provisionally created by AIC.COLOSSUS[[footnote]]RAISA Link: [[span style="color: maroon; cursor: help"]]Artificially Intelligent Construct: Creation Of Log Of Site-Specific Urgent Scenarios (KB 6116)[[/span]][[/footnote]] on 2013-05-29 after Site-121 went offline with no [[[SCUTTLE]]][[footnote]]RAISA Link: [[span style="color: maroon; cursor: help"]]System To Contain Unsustainable Threats To Life and Existence (KB 10235)[[/span]][[/footnote]] heartbeat[[footnote]]RAISA Link: [[span style="color: maroon; cursor: help"]]SCUTTLE Dead Man's Switch Protocol (KB 10236)[[/span]][[/footnote]], which correlated to a concurrent spike[[footnote]]Defined as 3 σ or more.[[/footnote]] in anomalous background entropy per AIC.WARHAMMER[[footnote]]RAISA Link: [[span style="color: maroon; cursor: help"]]Artificially Intelligent Construct: Weighted-Average Report of Hume, Air, Mass, Matter, Entropy and Radiation (KB 6119)[[/span]][[/footnote]].

The nature of the spike and rapid return to baseline did not match any known emissions signatures, and was determined with high confidence to be a Ruhiel-class Transitory Phenomenon[[footnote]]RAISA Link: [[span style="color: maroon; cursor: help"]]R.

> **Ν-7-β-1 (Maj. L. Swain)**: Two minutes out, fellas. We're dropping to visual range. Eyes up, head on a swivel. We haven't heard shit from this site in two hours and the AIs think there's a hostile force on the ground.

Uh...okay, this may not be the right one, there's nothing going back to 1388, but this Dave apparently gets up to some weird shit so, maybe? Pocket dimensions and all, that matches. Says he claims to have...invented Thursday? Had a big cover-up operation that Damn Feds had to do after Bearpuncher Solutions appeared on the NASDAQ selling Service as a Service. If this //is// your guy, he's got a shitload of brothers, too. So, some kind of Type Green with an explosion school.

Let's see here, we've got Explosionology, Explosionography, History of Explosions, Explosion Appreciation, Theoretical Explosions, Lil' Sploder's Daycare...why's there a fucking daycare? Uh, then we've got Applied Explosions, this one just says Explosions but in big all-caps letters, Walking Away From Explosions In Slow-Motion, Team-Based Holistic Exploding Leadership, Expl--

After two weeks of reports from MTF Nu-7's Beta and Gamma teams, entropy levels localized around the perimeter of the traversable discrete dimension began to slowly increase again, indicating destabilization of the Transitory Phenomenon. Despite this transitory period taking roughly three days, and the relative location of the teams to the baseline world being traversable in only 20 minutes, both teams were lost. All 264 members are considered lost and have been awarded the Foundation Silver Star for Distinguished Service.
