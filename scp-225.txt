**Item #:** SCP-225

**Object Class:** Euclid/Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-225-1 is contained at Site 65 for study and experimentation. No guards are necessary for the object itself, as theft is impossible and the object is harmless for the moment. 

SCP-225-2 is as yet uncontainable and should be monitored as best as possible as it travels, with constant updates as to its current position, speed, and trajectory, along with accurate projections as to its estimated position for the next 50 years. 

As of this writing SCP-225 poses no immediate threat. However, in the event that a collision course with SCP-225-1 is detected, SCP-225 is to be immediately upgraded to Keter, and every effort must be made to find a way to alter 225-1 or 225-1 from their courses. 

All Foundation resources are to be made available for this objective should it ever become a possibility. Planetary evacuation plans are to be drawn up as a precaution, as are revised containment procedures for SCP items whose containment being compromised by [DATA EXPUNGED] would not also result in the SCP item's imminent destruction.

**Description:** SCP-225-1 and SCP-225-2 are shiny gray metallic spheres of unknown origin and composition, each with a diameter of 0.681 meters. 

225-1 appears stable and motionless, but is in fact moving in a geosynchronous orbit above earth, at the exact speed of Earth's rotation, maintaining its relative position at all times. 

Gravity, magnetism, and all other forces tested have had no effect upon it, it maintains position approximately 7.3 meters above the surface. No amount of force brought to bear on it in any direction has any effect upon its position, all tools and weaponry tested have no effect upon it physically.

225-2 maintains an orbit around the sun that is nearly synchronous with Earth's. It does not orbit Earth, nor is it affected by Earth's gravity, giving it the illusory appearance of travelling around the earth at velocities usually ranging from 1,600 - 2,000 kph, depending on its current relative altitude. 

Fluctuations in the Earth's orbit move the planet closer to or further away from 225-2, within a surprisingly small level of variance to date. Since it was first observed in ████ it has never reached a relative altitude of less than 2km, generally staying between 3km - 210km above the surface, though it has moved as far away as [DATA EXPUNGED] resulting in a temporary loss of contact in ████(contact re-established in ████). 

Similarly to 225-1, no force or weaponry brought to bear upon it have had any effect, though testing on it is significantly more difficult, time-consuming, and resource-intensive due to the variation in its relative position.

**Addendum:** To summarize: no effort to move or damage 225-1 has any effect, and no effort to stop or damage 225-2 has any effect. 225-2 destructively travels through any object in its path without pause and/or pushes it out of its way, regardless of that object's composition. 225-1 is unaffected by any amount of force brought to bear on it in any direction.

While individually each object is not as yet of any major concern, there are cataclysmic implications should the two objects collide. Projections based upon the estimated amount of material contained between the two objects(.33 cubic meters, est. 2,600kg) show that should the objects annihilate upon contact, then they would release at minimum the power of a 65 gigaton nuclear explosion, potentially much higher depending upon what materials they are in fact constructed of. 

All tests thus far have not shown that SCP-225-1 is capable of being damaged in any way however, so the possibility exists that said annihilation would not occur. Should the objects be incapable of variation from their respective courses, yet also unable to be damaged even by each other, then a collision may cause [DATA EXPUNGED]. 

In this circumstance planetary evacuation may not be sufficient and options involving using interdimensional SCP's may be considered, should time permit before [DATA EXPUNGED].
