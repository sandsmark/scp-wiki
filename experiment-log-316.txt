**Experiment Log of:** [[[dr-blast-s-personnel-file |Dr. ██████ "Blast" ████]]], testing [[[SCP-316]]] on sentient SCPs.

------

**Date:** ██/██/20██ - Exposure to aggressive humanoid SCPs.

**Experiment-01:**  Exposure to [[[SCP-213]]]

Full effects of SCP-316 confirmed after 25 seconds of exposure.  SCP-213 exhibits normal symptoms of exposure.  Subject is still able to disintegrate matter when ordered to do so, but to a diminished extent (approx. 9% normal speed).  Testing concluded.  After recovery, subject shows a willingness to comply with Foundation commands to avoid future exposure to SCP-316.

**Note:**  //My heart nearly jumped out when he started melting matter, but scares aside, this test has proven very useful.  We can use SCP-316 to ensure cooperation when these SCPs disagree with us, and then hold it over their heads like a whip when they think of doing it again.//  

------

**Experiment-02:**  Exposure to [[[scp-076 |SCP-076-2]]]

Full effects of SCP-316 confirmed after 30 seconds of exposure.  SCP-076-2 enters a catatonic stupor, still upright.  At 49 seconds, subject proceeds to dispassionately kill all nearby personnel.  Kill-switch activated remotely by Dr. Blast.  Assistants to Dr. Blast note him hammering kill-switch frantically for up to 16 seconds after SCP-076-2 was pacified.  Testing suspended.

After revival, when questioned, SCP-076-2 remarked that SCP-316 had made him feel "...extremely bored.  What else was I supposed to do?"

**Note:**  //Jesus!  I guess monsters don't react the same way to this thing.  It's a good thing I opted to stay in Site 17 during the procedure.//

------

**Experiment-03:**  Exposure to [[[SCP-691]]]

Full effects of SCP-316 confirmed after 150 seconds of exposure.  SCP-691-b disconnected from subject.  SCP-691 questioned in Russian about the circumstances of his creation.  Subject displays little knowledge regarding the subject.  Interview is cut short at 190 seconds; the effects of SCP-316 seem to be wearing off prematurely.  Subject becomes aggressive, and breaks the chains of unknown composition holding him, which had also been exposed to SCP-316's light and were somehow weakened.  Subject breaches containment.  Dr. Blast hits site containment breach alarm, despite that he is viewing the test remotely from a different site.  SCP-691 kills █ researchers and personnel before containment reestablished.

**Note:**  //They should stop trying to replicate that worthless metal.  And I should retire.//

------

**Date:** ██/██/20██ - Further exposure to aggressive humanoid SCPs.

**Experiment-04:**  Exposure to [[[SCP-019]]]

Full effects of SCP-316 confirmed after 18 seconds of exposure.  SCP-019 exhibits normal symptoms of exposure.  Electric potential and gamma radiation levels unchanged.  At 170 seconds, researchers notice effects of SCP-316 on previously unaffected parts of the testing area.  SCP-019 determined to be weakly broadcasting the effects of SCP-316.  Testing suspended.

**Note:**  //Would someone explain to me why haven't we tossed this human glowstick into the sun?  That aside, at least we confirmed that SCP-316's effect is probably EM-based, as opposed to some white, light-like goo or something.//  

------

**Experiment-05:**  Exposure to [[[SCP-056]]]

Full effects of SCP-316 confirmed after 30 seconds of exposure.  SCP-056 changes into a gray replica of one of the researchers in the testing room, shifting between several of them as tests are conducted.  Personality and effects of subject remain unchanged; only the physical form appears to be affected.  As researchers read out results for Dr. Blast (viewing remotely via camera), SCP-056 takes the form of Dr. Blast.  Microphone in Dr. Blast's area records him shouting an expletive and falling over with his chair.  Testing concluded.

**Note:**  //Nobody told me this thing could breach camera transmissions!  I've probably been mentally breached as well, I can feel it already, dammit!  My head's probably going to explode.  █████, this thing can destroy brains, right?  Who the hell designed fifty-six's containment procedures, anyway?  Dammit, I can't move.  I can't fucking move.  Wheel me down to the infirmary, █████!  Hurry!//

**Note:**  Medical personnel found no physical or mental problems with Dr. Blast.  Research assistant █████ has requested a transfer.
