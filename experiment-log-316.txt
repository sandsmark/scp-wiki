**Experiment Log of:** [[[dr-blast-s-personnel-file |Dr. ██████ "Blast" ████]]], testing [[[SCP-316]]] on sentient SCPs.

------

**Date:** ██/██/20██ - Exposure to aggressive humanoid SCPs.

**Experiment-01:**  Exposure to [[[SCP-213]]]

Full effects of SCP-316 confirmed after 25 seconds of exposure.  SCP-213 exhibits normal symptoms of exposure.  Subject is still able to disintegrate matter when ordered to do so, but to a diminished extent (approx. 9% normal speed).  Testing concluded.  After recovery, subject shows a willingness to comply with Foundation commands to avoid future exposure to SCP-316.

**Note:**  //My heart nearly jumped out when he started melting matter, but scares aside, this test has proven very useful.  We can use SCP-316 to ensure cooperation when these SCPs disagree with us, and then hold it over their heads like a whip when they think of doing it again.//

**Experiment-02:**  Exposure to [[[scp-076 |SCP-076-2]]]

Full effects of SCP-316 confirmed after 30 seconds of exposure.  SCP-076-2 enters a catatonic stupor, still upright.  At 49 seconds, subject proceeds to dispassionately kill all nearby personnel.  Kill-switch activated remotely by Dr. Blast.  Assistants to Dr. Blast note him hammering kill-switch frantically for up to 16 seconds after SCP-076-2 was pacified.  Testing suspended.

After revival, when questioned, SCP-076-2 remarked that SCP-316 had made him feel "...extremely bored.  What else was I supposed to do?"

**Note:**  //Jesus!  I guess monsters don't react the same way to this thing.  It's a good thing I opted to stay in Site 17 during the procedure.//


------

**Experiment-05:**  Exposure to [[[SCP-056]]]

Full effects of SCP-316 confirmed after 30 seconds of exposure.  SCP-056 changes into a gray replica of one of the researchers in the testing room, shifting between several of them as tests are conducted.  Personality and effects of subject remain unchanged; only the physical form appears to be affected.  As researchers read out results for Dr. Blast (viewing remotely via camera), SCP-056 takes the form of Dr. Blast.  Microphone in Dr. Blast's area records him shouting an expletive and falling over with his chair.  Testing concluded.

**Note:**  //Nobody told me this thing could breach camera transmissions!  I've probably been mentally breached as well, I can feel it already, dammit!  My head's probably going to explode.  █████, this thing can destroy brains, right?  Who the hell designed fifty-six's containment procedures, anyway?  Dammit, I can't move.  I can't fucking move.  Wheel me down to the infirmary, █████!  Hurry!//

**Note:**  Medical personnel found no physical or mental problems with Dr. Blast.  Research assistant █████ has requested a transfer.
