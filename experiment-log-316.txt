**Experiment Log of:** Dr. ██████ "Blast" ████, testing [[[SCP-316]]] on sentient SCPs.

------

**Date:** ██/██/20██ - Exposure to aggressive humanoid SCPs.

**Experiment-01:**  Exposure to [[[SCP-213]]] in response to a period of refusal to cooperate

Full effects of SCP-316 confirmed after 25 seconds of exposure.  SCP-213 exhibits normal symptoms of exposure.  Subject is still able to disintegrate matter, but to a diminished extent (approx. 9% normal speed).  After recovery, subject shows a willingness to comply with Foundation commands to avoid future exposure to SCP-316.

------

**Experiment-02:**  Exposure to [[[scp-076 |SCP-076-2]]]

Full effects of SCP-316 confirmed after 30 seconds of exposure.  SCP-076-2 enters a catatonic stupor, still upright, which persists for 18.7 seconds.  Subject then proceeds to dispassionately kill all nearby personnel.  Kill-switch activated remotely by Dr. Blast.  Dr. Blast noted to be pressing kill-switch repeatedly for up to 20 seconds after SCP-076-2 was pacified.

After revival, when questioned, SCP-076-2 remarked that SCP-316 had made him feel "...extremely bored.  What else was I supposed to do?"

------

**Experiment-03:**  Exposure to [[[SCP-691]]]

Full effects of SCP-316 confirmed after 150 seconds of exposure.  SCP-691-b disconnected from subject.  SCP-691 questioned in Russian about the circumstances of his creation.  Subject displays little knowledge regarding the subject.  After 30 seconds, effects of SCP-316 seem to be diminishing.  Subject becomes aggressive, and breaks the chains of unknown composition holding him, which had also been exposed to SCP-316 and were somehow weakened.  Subject breaches containment.  Dr. Blast hits site containment breach alarm, despite the fact that he is viewing the test remotely from a different site.  SCP-691 kills █ researchers and personnel before containment reestablished.
