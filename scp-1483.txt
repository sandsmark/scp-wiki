**Item #:** SCP-1483

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Only minimal security measures are necessary to contain SCP-1483 , due to both the nature of the property and the difficulty in accessing it. All entry and exit to U-B-1483 is to be regulated by Falcon and Dustside Stations, located on both sides of the transition zone. In the event of aggressive invasion of Baseline by SCP-1483, the emergency charges around Dustside Station are to be detonated, cutting off access to SCP-1483

All personnel assigned to the Foundation embassy or any other Sites within the boundaries SCP-1483 may only be held accountable to the provisions of their Basic Operations Charter by the Overseer Board. In all other matters, personnel are to be held to the laws of SCP-1483, and all provisions of the agreements made with the Throne of the Empress and the Imperial Institute of Paranatural and Esoteric Study, henceforth referred to as IIPES. 

Foundation sites within SCP-1483 are considered a semi-autonomous district of operations under the Exploratory Research Provisions (O5 Special Order 108-A). The position of High Commissioner has been instituted with Level-5 clearance to oversee Foundation operations within SCP-1483. The individual holding the position has no authority outside of this jurisdiction.

**Description:** SCP-1483 is the continent of Antarctica, as confirmed by local maps and day/night cycles, located in Universe B-10208-Alpha-1483, entered by means of passing through a small crevasse located in the Queen Alexandra Mountain range (Coordinates: [REDACTED]). The transition location is classified as a SSUIS2 (Stable/Stationary/Unaided/Instantaneous/Safe/Two Way) universal overlap.

SCP-1483’s environment is most notable in its lack of surface ice. The majority of the continent consists of a central desert, interspersed with seasonal rivers and lakes. Vegetation is sparse, and primarily consists of coastal forests and scrubland. Agriculture is carried out during the summer months through a complex series of irrigation canals and large plantations, taking advantage of glacial melts. 

The average summer temperature is approximately 35° C. (95° F), with winter temperatures reaching -35° C (-31° F). The cause of this temperature, and the implications on the rest of the planet's climate, are unknown at this time. Genetic sequencing of native flora and fauna native has revealed that all similarities to Baseline life are by convergence, rather than common descent. Many species of native life bear no resemblance to Baseline species, and several have been specially bred or otherwise modified by SCP-1483-1. 

The inhabitants of SCP-1483 are designated as SCP-1483-1, //Homo antarcticus//. The exact lineage of the species is unknown at this time, though the last shared ancestor with //H. sapiens// is considered to be //H. heidelbergensis//. A single sub-species and several clades exist, many through applications of specific anomalous properties to certain populations.

See Addendum-02 for a listing of major groups of SCP-1483-1.

    The government of SCP-1483 is a matriarchal imperialist monarchy consisting of seventeen provinces, with local governments answerable to a central bureaucracy. The current government was founded approximately four hundred years before contact, and is the third such ruling body to unify the continent. Few traces of these prior civilizations remain, and Imperial scholars have not provided any detailed information on the subject. The Empire’s technology level is roughly equivalent to that to modern Baseline.

    The existence of anomalous objects is common knowledge within the Empire, officially dealt with by the Imperial Institute of Paranatural and Esoteric Study. See Addendum-01 for a listing of major anomalous objects under Imperial control.

When questioned about regions outside of the borders of SCP-1483, an Imperial liaison responded: “The dealings of savages and their rotting lands are of no concern to us. Do not waste your time in asking after them.”


**Addendum-01:** The following are anomalous objects of specific note controlled or managed by the IIPES:

•	SCP-1483a: “Sanak Thiuh” – The mummified remains of an unknown organism measuring approximately fifty meters in length, currently in storage within the Institute. All requests to study the remains have been denied. The entity features heavily in local folklore, albeit in unproven and often contradictory accounts. However, all accounts point to the creature’s death as the founding of the First Empire.
•	SCP-1483b: “The Maws of Eser” – A series of UMUID1 (Unstable/Mobile/Unaided/Instantaneous/Dangerous/One Way) universal overlaps which will randomly manifest across SCP-1483. Overlaps are visible, though intangible, appearing as dark clouds at ground level. These overlaps will consume any material in their path, and will persist for 1-6 hours. Their appearance is accompanied by the manifestation of 3-20 SCP-1483-1c.
•	SCP-1483c: “The Blessings of Aqum” – No concrete information regarding this item exists at this time, outside of its apparent use in creating subspecies of SCP-1483-1 and its place in folklore as the weapon that killed SCP-1483a.

**Addendum-02:** Notable clades of SCP-1483-1 include:

•	SCP-1483-1b: “The Black Court” – A subspecies of SCP-1483-1, specialized to survive outside in winter conditions by means of a thick layer of body fat and fur.
•	SCP-1483-1c: “Feastlings” – Entities that will manifest alongside SCP-1483b instances. SCP-14831c will appear as emaciated SCP-1483-1, and are singularly violent in behavior, attacking and consuming any nearby organisms.
•	SCP-1483-1d: “Menders” – Individuals capable of dispelling SCP-1483b through currently unknown means. SCP-1483-1d possess a second pair of arms and have segments of a metallic exoskeleton encircling the limbs and torso. Connections with SCP-1483b have been stated by locals.
•	SCP-1483-1e: "Watchers-Upon-All" – The rarest clade of SCP-1483-1, generally found in high governmental positions or leading bands of SCP-1483-1d. SCP-1483-1e specimens stand approximately three meters in height, possess two additional pairs of arms and a full exoskeleton. SCP-1483-1e are reported by locals as having received “all blessings” of SCP-1483b.

**Addendum-03:**

A timeline of Foundation involvement in SCP-1483 is as follows:

•	██/██/1912 – The first evidence of SCP-1483’s existence can be traced back to the journal of one ████████ ██████, a member of the British Antarctic Expedition 1910 under Robert Falcon Scott. ████████ claimed to have seen dark-skinned humanoid figures emerging from a rift. He was unable to make contact with the entities, but nonetheless provided a detailed description of the figures. ████████  did not alert any other members of the expedition about the event.
•	██/██/1989 - ████████’s journal was recovered from a Marshall, Carter and Dark auction house. It is catalogued without study.
