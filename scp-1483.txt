**Item #:** SCP-1483

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Only minimal security measures are necessary to contain SCP-1483 , due to both the nature of the property and the difficulty in accessing it. All entry and exit to Universe B-10208-Alpha-1483 is to be regulated by Falcon and Dustside Stations, located on both sides of the transition zone. In the event of aggressive invasion of Baseline by SCP-1483, the emergency charges around Dustside Station are to be detonated, cutting off access to SCP-1483.

All personnel assigned to the Foundation embassy or any other Sites within the boundaries SCP-1483 may only be held accountable to the provisions of their Basic Operations Charter by the Overseer Board. In all other matters, personnel are to be held to the laws of SCP-1483, and all provisions of the agreements made with the Throne of the Empress and the Imperial Institute of Paranatural and Esoteric Study, henceforth referred to as IIPES. 

Foundation sites within SCP-1483 are considered a semi-autonomous district of operations under the Exploratory Research Provisions (O5 Special Order 108-A). The position of Commissioner has been instituted with Level-5 clearance to oversee Foundation operations within SCP-1483. The individual holding the position has no authority outside of this jurisdiction.

**Description:** SCP-1483 is the continent of Antarctica, as confirmed by local maps and day/night cycles, located in Universe B-10208-Alpha-1483, entered by means of passing through a small crevasse located in the Queen Alexandra Mountain range (Coordinates: [REDACTED]). The transition location is classified as a SSUIS2 (Stable/Stationary/Unaided/Instantaneous/Safe/Two Way) universal overlap.

SCP-1483’s environment is most notable in its lack of surface ice. The majority of the continent consists of a central desert, interspersed with seasonal rivers and lakes. Vegetation is sparse, and primarily consists of coastal forests and scrubland. Agriculture is carried out during the summer months through a complex series of irrigation canals and large plantations, taking advantage of glacial melts. 

The average summer temperature is approximately 35° C. (95° F), with winter temperatures reaching -35° C (-31° F). The cause of this temperature, and the implications on the rest of the planet's climate, are unknown at this time. Genetic sequencing of native flora and fauna has revealed that all similarities to Baseline life are by convergence, rather than common descent. Many species of native life bear no resemblance to Baseline species, and several have been specially bred or otherwise modified by SCP-1483-1. 

The inhabitants of SCP-1483 are designated as SCP-1483-1, //Homo antarcticus//. The exact lineage of the species is unknown at this time, though the last shared ancestor with //H. sapiens// is considered to be the B-10208-Alpha-1483 instance of //H. heidelbergensis//. A single sub-species and several clades exist, many through applications of specific anomalous properties to certain populations.

See Addendum-02 for a listing of major groups of SCP-1483-1.

    The government of SCP-1483 is a matriarchal imperialist monarchy consisting of seventeen provinces, with local governments answerable to a central bureaucracy. The majority of the population resides in urban areas or plantation settlements, connected by a train network. The current government was founded approximately four hundred years before contact, and is the third such ruling body to unify the continent. Few traces of these prior civilizations remain, and no accurate history of events preceding the early Second Empire has been compiled. The Empire’s technology level is roughly equivalent to that to modern Baseline. Nuclear and solar power are more prevalent than fossil fuels, while communication technologies lag behind the Baseline significantly due to the lack of satellites.

    The existence of anomalous objects is common knowledge within the Empire, officially dealt with by the Imperial Institute of Paranatural and Esoteric Study. The Foundation is treated as a public ward of the IIPES. The Foundation’s presence and purpose in SCP-1483 is tolerated by Imperial authorities: However, the Foundation is limited to operations within authorized areas. Access to Imperial records, specific information regarding items under the Institute’s control, and any information deemed sensitive by the Empire or IIPES and is likewise limited.

See Addendum-01 for a listing of major anomalous objects under Imperial control.

When questioned about regions outside of the borders of SCP-1483, an Imperial liaison responded: “The dealings of savages and their rotting lands are of no concern to us. Do not waste your time in asking after them.”

**Addendum-01:** The IIPES has cataloged over three thousand anomalous items and entities since its founding during the Second Empire Era. The majority of these items have been disposed of: Approximately five hundred are currently contained or monitored by the Institute. The most notable of these include:

•	SCP-1483a: “Sanak Thiuh” – The mummified remains of an unknown organism measuring approximately fifty meters in length, currently in storage within the Institute. All requests to study the remains have been denied. The entity features heavily in local folklore, albeit in unproven and often contradictory accounts. However, all accounts point to the creature’s death as the founding of the First Empire.
•	SCP-1483b: “The Maws of Eser” – A series of UMUID1 (Unstable/Mobile/Unaided/Instantaneous/Dangerous/One Way) universal overlaps which will randomly manifest across SCP-1483. Overlaps are visible, though intangible, appearing as dark clouds at ground level. These overlaps will consume any material in their path, and will persist for 1-6 hours. Their appearance is accompanied by the manifestation of 3-20 SCP-1483-1c.
•	SCP-1483c: “The Blessings of Aqum” – No concrete information regarding this item exists at this time, outside of its apparent use in creating certain clades of SCP-1483-1 and its place in folklore as the weapon that killed SCP-1483a.

**Addendum-02:** Notable clades of SCP-1483-1 include:

•	SCP-1483-1b: “The Black Court” – A subspecies of SCP-1483-1, specialized to survive outside in winter conditions by means of a thick layer of body fat and fur.
•	SCP-1483-1c: “Feastlings” – Entities that will manifest alongside SCP-1483b instances. SCP-1483-1c will appear as emaciated SCP-1483-1, and are singularly violent in behavior, attacking and consuming any nearby organisms.
•	SCP-1483-1d: “Menders” – Individuals capable of dispelling SCP-1483b through currently unknown means. SCP-1483-1d possess a second pair of arms and have segments of a metallic exoskeleton encircling the limbs and torso. Connections with SCP-1483b have been stated by locals.
•	SCP-1483-1e: "Watchers-Upon-All" – The rarest clade of SCP-1483-1, generally found in high governmental positions or leading bands of SCP-1483-1d. SCP-1483-1e specimens stand approximately three meters in height, possess two additional pairs of arms and a full exoskeleton. SCP-1483-1e are reported by locals as having received “all blessings” of SCP-1483c.
•	SCP-1483-1f: Minor Clades - This classification includes all minor clades native to outlying provinces that have yet not been studied by the Foundation.

**Addendum-03:**

A timeline of Foundation involvement in SCP-1483 is as follows:

•	██/██/1912: The first evidence of SCP-1483’s existence can be traced back to the journal of one ████████ ██████, a member of the British Antarctic Expedition 1910 under Robert Falcon Scott. ████████ claimed to have seen dark-skinned humanoid figures emerging from a rift. He was unable to make contact with the entities, but nonetheless provided a detailed description of the figures. ████████  did not alert any other members of the expedition about the event.
•	██/██/1989: ████████’s journal was recovered from a Marshall, Carter and Dark auction house. It is cataloged without study.
