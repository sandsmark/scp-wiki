**Object Class**: Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures**: SCP-4276 are to be held collectively within a glass observation chamber, and smoke exhalers are to be embedded within each corner, allowing quick neutralization and dispersion of the colony. SCP-4276 are to be fed a 250.0g mix consisting of 70% fruit and 30% dead insects, primarily small spiders, and ants, 4 times a week. No species larger than a common mouse are to be fed to SCP-4276. SCP-4276 is to be observed twice a month for any signs of colony growth, in which case, mandatory culling is to take place through smoking SCP-4276's containment chamber and extracting excess occurrences. Only 20 instances of SCP-4276 are to remain alive at one time.

Any testing of SCP-4276 must be performed by Class-3 personnel or higher, moreover, it must first be approved by Class-4-4276 personnel assigned to SCP-4276's containment. Any staff who interact with SCP-4276 must allow themselves to be subject to an MRI scan, medicinal treatment, and pyrethroid cleanse at any moment. Any and all recreational audio-visual appliances are to remain outside of SCP-4276's containment. In case of a containment breach of SCP-4276, all instances of SCP-4276 are to be terminated and the site is to be placed into lockdown. It is unknown if the entirety of SCP-4276 has been contained.

**Description**: SCP-4276 is a tribe of insects descending from the family of Chrysididae [[footnote]] More specifically the tribe Chrysidini. [[/footnote]], more commonly known as the cuckoo wasp. SCP-4276 shares many similarities to its relatives, including kleptoparasitic breeding habits and structural coloration. SCP-4276, however, appears to possess a greater diversity for structure amongst its family, allowing varied shades of green, blue, pink, red, yellow, magenta, and combinations of the group. Certain cases of SCP-4276 have also grown considerably larger than non-anomalous species, ranging from 1.2 cm (0.5 inches) to upwards of 5.1 cm (2.0 inches) [[footnote]] Largest known instance to date was 8.1cm (3.2 inches). [[/footnote]]. SCP-4276 possess an ovipositor to assist in egg insemination, although not only do they substitute the area and functionality of a stinger, males appear to lack both.

SCP-4276 is for the most part identical in behavior to their non-anomalous counterparts, save for an apparent quirk of newborn wasps to create 'colonies' near hatching points. Newborn SCP-4276 instances also appear to mature especially quickly, as most natural births take place after about 3 days, compared to a full week. SCP-4276 does not appear to prefer eggs to host their larvae in[[footnote]] As opposed to their non-anomalous counterparts, which are notorious for infesting spider dens. [[/footnote]], rather introducing its larvae to both living and freshly killed animals. SCP-4276 has been discovered having infected:
* (4) //White-Tailed Deer.//
* (2) //Desert Cottontail.//
* (1) //Red Fox, observed consuming a Cottontail.//
* (1) //Black Bear.//
* (1) //German Shepard.//
* (4) //Human males.//
**Discovery**: SCP-4276 was first discovered 8km east of Oak Creek, Colorado after 4 individuals (henceforth designated POI-4276-1 through 4) were reported missing. One such individual was a Jebidiah Carswell [[footnote]] POI-4276-1. [[/footnote]], an avid hunter, and a community spokesman for the area. Foundation agents found that Mr. Carswell had recently purchased a hunting cottage near Stagecoach State Park, and had emailed a select few of his colleagues to meet him that weekend. Foundation agents were successful in obtaining Mr. Carswell's property records and quarantined the cottage, which had become infested with SCP-4276. Mr. Carswell had allegedly scheduled a hunting trip for his colleagues and, after a failed night of searching, decided to celebrate instead. MTF Lambda-12 was dispatched.

**Exploration Video Log Transcript**

**Date: 1999/03/13 — 06:30 am**

**Exploration Team**: MTF Lambda-12 ("Pest Control")

**Team Lead**: Lambda-1 ('Lanie')

**Team Members**: Lambda-2('Colin'), Lambda-3 ('Jameson'), Lambda-4 ('Alan')

**Note**: MTF Lambda-12 agents are equipped with modified smoke blowers strapped to their backs as well as a sidearm.

[BEGIN LOG]
-----

00:00—//Personal body cams are switched to active, revealing agents stacked up on the cottage door.//

00:10—(//Lambda-4 casts a smoke grenade into the entryway as agents disperse within the room.//)

00:20—(//Smoke clears and POI-4276-2 is visible laying adjacent to the door face down.//)

**Lambda-1**: "Search the building. Remember protocol."

00:35—(//Lambda-1 investigates POI-4276-2. hoisting up the body reveals what appears to be numerous wounds in his back, resembling holes.//)

00:40—(//Lambda-3 likewise discover POI-4276-3 and a German Shepard in the kitchen area. POI-
4276-3's chest is visible having been opened outwards from the sternum. The pup [[footnote]] Recovery of a collar proposed the dog's name as 'Ringo'. Evidence supports relationship as POI-4276-1's companion. [[/footnote]] appears relatively sound save for a cavity in its head.//)

**Lambda-3**: "Found a dog and a body, still no sign of an anomaly."

**Lambda-1**: "Roger, continue search. Lambda-2, report?"

01:00—(//At the same time of Lambda-1 transmission, Lambda-2 opens the bathroom door. POI-4276-4 is discovered stooped inside of the bathtub, his innards [REDACTED]. A large number of SCP-4276 are present and begin droning loudly.//)

**Lambda-2**: "—Oh fuck. Bathroom! Bathroom! 315° West right fucking now!"

1:05—(//Lambda-2 activates his smoke blower as Lambda-4 releases a smoke grenade through the bathroom door, he then promptly slams it shut. Smoke is seen pouring out beneath the doorframe.//)

**Lambda-4**: "You're welcome."

**Lambda-2**: "Fuck off. Have you found POI-1?"

1:25—(//Lambda-4 nods and gestures towards the far eastern wall, where a large stereo had been overturned. Large amounts of alcohol are seen having been placed or knocked over around the system.//)

**Lambda-1**: "Have you located the final POI?"

**Lambda-4**: "Yes sir, eastern wall."

**Lambda-2**: "I don't see him."

**Lambda-4**: "Look closer."

1:40—(//Upon closer inspection POI-4276-1 was located, having been wedged between the wall and a loudspeaker, causing it to fall forward and become inoperable. POI-4276-1's head had been split open, and a single adult instance of SCP-4276 is acknowledged burrowing into his brain.//)

**Lambda-2**: "huh, You don't see that often. Bag up the bodies and let's get the hell out of here. Jameson, help me deal with the bathroom."

**Lambda-3**: "Roger that."

**Addendum**: Following a successful operation, MTF Lambda-12 was able to contain a number of living specimens of SCP-4276. 127 active instances have been contained.

SCP-4276 does not hatch easily in conventional conditions, as controlled trials using rats revealed only a ~20% [[footnote]] Subjects were placed into a glass container along with a single instance of SCP-4276, then left within the chamber for 5 days. [[/footnote]] successful birthing rate. Use of carcasses during trials reduced this number to ~16%. --It is currently unknown how to keep the size of SCP-4276 in containment at a stable number, as breeding seems unreliable at best.--

> 
> SCP-4276's primary anomalous properties were discovered during a routine cleaning of the facility after janitor ███ clocked into SCP-4276's testing chamber.
> 
> The janitor ███ had entered the chamber during a trial on grounds of 'routine sweeping' but had been listening to a Bluetooth speaker fastened to his belt, causing him to be unable to hear Researcher Calloway's shouting. Background noise within the chamber immediately spiked to about 95db, whereupon erratic shuffling was noticed from the subject.
> 
> Subject unexpectedly began convulsing before ██ instances of SCP-4276 violently erupted from its corpse and began hurling themselves against the glass. The janitor ███ did not appear to notice the incident, but Researcher Calloway was able to activate the smokers, neutralizing SCP-4276. The janitor ███ was commended for his contribution and then immediately demoted to D-class for negligence.
 

Following recent discoveries, it has been noted that auditory stimuli meeting certain qualifications (such as bass distortion and a 90db minimal requirement) appears to cause accelerated hatching [[footnote]] Henceforth titled a 'Genesis Event'. [[/footnote]] within subjects. Test trials commenced afterward included the presence of a speaker blaring audio. Birthing rates increased throughout said tests to ~92%. SCP-4276 can now reliably be replenished for testing. --It is still unknown if any further stimuli can accelerate maturation.--


[[collapsible show="+ Open Testing Log-4276" hide="- Close Testing Log-4276"]]
> **Preword**: All subjects are to be placed into a glass containment chamber 1m by 1m, along with select instances of SCP-4276. These tests are to determine how exactly SCP-4276 is able to accelerate its incubation process.
> -----
> **Subject**: (3) White rats. (1) SCP-4276 Instance.
> **Materials**: N.A.
> **Results**: Subjects are released into containment chamber and are immediately attacked by SCP-4276. SCP-4276 is successful in injecting one subject before being ripped in half by the pack. The injected subject was immediately removed from containment and a foreign body surgery was performed, which resulted in several surviving larvae being removed. Autopsy reveals the presence of numerous deceased larvae. No further damage is reported.
> -----
> **Subject**: (1) White rat. (2) SCP-4276 Instances.
> **Materials**: N.A.
> **Results**: Subject is released into containment chamber and immediately attacked by SCP-4276. Both are successful in injecting the subject, but instead of fleeing begin to grip to its backside. Eventually, one instance is successful in piercing the subjects' skin and burrows itself within the subjects lower back. Subject collapses and Genesis Event results in (5) instances of SCP-4276. Autopsy reveals the presence of fewer larvae than previous tests, but not significantly.
> -----
> **Subject**: (1) Black-footed ferret. (4) SCP-4276 Instances.
> **Materials**: (1) Portable Bluetooth speaker.
> **Results**: Bluetooth speaker is amplified upwards to 95db and placed inside the chamber, and the subject is released into containment. Two wasps are successfully able to inject the subject before it completely enters the chamber. (1) wasp, the only male of the group, is unable to inject or bite the ferret, instead deciding to enter the ferret's mouth. The male instance is successful and exits seconds later through the subject's skull. 30 minutes after initial contact Genesis Event begins and (25) instances of SCP-4276 emerge. Autopsy reveals significantly less deceased larvae than previous tests.
> -----
> **Subject**: (1) Desert cottontail. (2) SCP-4276 Instances.
> **Materials**: (1) Portable Bluetooth speaker. See Results Log.
> **Results**: Bluetooth speaker is amplified upwards to 100db and placed directly inside the chamber, the subject is released shortly afterward. Both are successful in injecting the subject just as it bashes the speaker, rendering it inoperable. The subject was later successful in terminating both occurrences of SCP-4276. Just as testing was to conclude a containment breach of SCP-████ occurred, prompting severe flickering in site power. During this time, a fluorescent light illuminating the test chamber began flickering violently, and the subject became erratic. after 10 minutes of violent thrashing, subject's upper back split open and (42) instances of SCP-4276 emerged.
> -----
> **Subject**: (1) Human male: D-9974. (6) SCP-4276 Instances.
> **Materials**: (1) Portable Bluetooth speaker. (1) LED strobe light.
> **Results**: [DATA EXPUNGED BY ORDER OF ETHICS COMMITTEE]
[[/collapsible]]

Visual stimuli also appears to have an effect on SCP-4276 events, as irregular or extreme illumination shows to accelerate gestation within host subjects. The exact reasoning behind these reactions is unknown, but it should be noted the incredible increase in growth that colonies experience upon encountering these circumstances. It should also be noted that containment procedures have been altered slightly in regards to the aforementioned information: //All shrubland within 8km of Discovery Site-4276 is to be tested for signs of SCP-4276 and cleansed of insect life.//

> **Incident Log-4276-1**:
> 
> On the date of 1999/06/22 Foundation observationalists overlooking the town of Oak Creek in Routt County, Colorado noted numerous jumbled police reports. Each report remarked complaints of a "loud buzzing noise" resonating from the local area. Local police were delayed by agents while surveyors attempted to triangulate the location in question. GPS tracking eventually led Foundation agents to Soroco High School, where the yearly prom night was being held. MTF Lambda-12 was dispatched.

I was gonna get a mop and then…There were these bees. No, wasps. Oh, I don't fucking know! but they were there! I watched them just, crawl all out of his face, and they were shining so bright, it was too painful to see what the hell was going on. Nobody but his date noticed, and she was trying so hard to scream over the music, but before you knew it they just started landing on people.
