**Object Class**: Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures**: SCP-XXXX instances are to be held collectively within a glass observation chamber, and smoke exhalers are to be embedded within each corner, allowing quick neutralization and dispersion of the colony. Instances are to be fed a 250.0g mix consisting of 70% fruit and 30% dead insects, primarily small spiders, and ants, 4 times a week. Absolutely no species larger than a common mouse are to be fed to SCP-XXXX. SCP-XXXX is to be observed twice a month for any signs of colony growth, in which case, mandatory culling is to take place through smoking SCP-XXXX's containment chamber and extracting excess instances. Only 20 instances of SCP-XXXX are to remain alive at one time.

Any testing of SCP-XXXX must be performed by Class-3 personnel or higher, moreover, it must first be approved by Class-4-XXXX personnel assigned to SCP-XXXX's containment. Any staff who interact with SCP-XXXX must allow themselves to be subject to an MRI scan, medicinal treatment, and pyrethroid cleanse at any moment. Any and all recreational audio-visual appliances are to remain outside of SCP-XXXX's containment. In case of a containment breach of SCP-XXXX, all instances of SCP-XXXX are to be terminated and the site is to be placed into lockdown. It is unknown if all instances of SCP-XXXX have been contained.

**Description**: SCP-XXXX is a tribe of insects descending from the family of Chrysididae [[footnote]] More specifically the tribe Chrysidini. [[/footnote]], more commonly known as the cuckoo wasp. Cuckoo wasps are related to over species of 3000 bees, wasps, and other insects, primarily through their physique and personality. One of the most striking physical features of the species is their shiny metallic carapaces, which have been designed with microscopic structures so thin they interfere with visible light. SCP-XXXX shares many similarities to its relatives, including kleptoparasitic breeding habits and structural coloration. SCP-XXXX, however, appears to possess a greater diversity of structure amongst its tribe, allowing varied shades of green, blue, pink, red, yellow, magenta, and combinations of the group. Instances of SCP-XXXX have also grown considerably larger than non-anomalous species, ranging from 1.2 cm (0.5 inches) to upwards of 5.1 cm (2.0 inches) [[footnote]] Largest known instance to date was 8.1cm (3.2 inches). [[/footnote]]. Instances of SCP-XXXX possess an ovipositor to assist in egg insemination, although not only do they substitute the area and functionality of a stinger, male instances appear to lack both.

SCP-XXXX instances are for the most part identical in behavior to their non-anomalous counterparts, save for an apparent quirk of newborn wasps to create 'colonies' near hatching points. Newborn SCP-XXXX instances also appear to mature especially quickly, as most natural births take place after about 3 days, compared to a full week. SCP-XXXX instances also do not appear to prefer eggs to host their larvae in, rather introducing its larvae to both living and freshly killed animals. SCP-XXXX has been discovered having infected:
* (4) //White-Tailed Deer.//
* (2) //Desert Cottontail.//
* (1) //Red Fox, observed consuming a Cottontail.//
* (1) //Black Bear.//
* (1) //German Shepard.//
* (4) //Human males.//
**Discovery**: SCP-XXXX was first discovered 8km east of Oak Creek, Colorado after 4 individuals (henceforth designated POI-XXXX-1 through 4) were reported missing. One such individual was a Jebidiah Carswell [[footnote]] POI-XXXX-1. [[/footnote]], an avid hunter, and a community spokesman for the area. Foundation agents found that Mr. Carswell had recently purchased a hunting cottage near Stagecoach State Park, and had emailed a select few of his colleagues to meet him that weekend. Foundation agents were successful in obtaining Mr. Carswell's property records and quarantined the cottage, which had become infested with SCP-XXXX. Mr. Carswell had allegedly scheduled a hunting trip for his colleagues and, after a failed night of searching, decided to celebrate instead. MTF Lambda-12 was dispatched.

**Exploration Video Log Transcript**

**Date: 1999/03/13 — 06:30 am**

**Exploration Team**: MTF Lambda-12 ("Pest Control")

**Team Lead**: Lambda-1 ('Lanie')

**Team Members**: Lambda-2('Colin'), Lambda-3 ('Jameson'), Lambda-4 ('Alan')

**Note**: MTF Lambda-12 agents are equipped with modified smoke blowers strapped to their backs as well as a sidearm.

[BEGIN LOG]
-----

00:00—//Personal body cams are switched to active, revealing agents stacked up on the cottage door.//

**Lambda-1**: "Stack up. Prepare some smoke. Ready for breach."

00:10—(//Lambda-4 casts a smoke grenade into the entryway as agents disperse within the room.//)

00:20—(//Smoke clears and POI-XXXX-2 is visible laying adjacent to the door face down.//)

**Lambda-1**: "Search the building. Remember protocol."

00:35—(//Lambda-1 investigates POI-XXXX-2. hoisting up the body reveals what appears to be numerous wounds in his back, resembling holes.//)

00:40—(//Lambda-3 likewise discover POI-XXXX-3 and a German Shepard in the kitchen area. POI-
XXXX-3's chest is visible having been opened outwards from the sternum. The pup [[footnote]] Recovery of a collar proposed the dog's name as 'Ringo'. Evidence supports relationship as POI-XXXX-1's companion. [[/footnote]] appears relatively sound save for a cavity in its head.//)

**Lambda-3**: "Found a dog and a body, still no sign of an anomaly."

**Lambda-1**: "Roger, continue search. Lambda-2, report?"

01:00—(//At the same time of Lambda-1 transmission, Lambda-2 opens the bathroom door. POI-XXXX-4 is discovered stooped inside of the bathtub, his innards [REDACTED]. A large number of SCP-XXXX instances are present and begin droning loudly.//)

**Lambda-2**: "—Oh fuck. Bathroom! Bathroom! 315° West right fucking now!"

1:05—(//Lambda-2 activates his smoke blower as Lambda-4 releases a smoke grenade through the bathroom door, he then promptly slams it shut. Smoke is seen pouring out beneath the doorframe.//)

**Lambda-4**: "You're welcome."

**Lambda-2**: "Fuck off. Have you found the last dude?"

1:25—(//Lambda-4 nods and gestures towards the far eastern wall, where a large stereo had been overturned. Large amounts of alcohol are seen having been placed or knocked over around the system.//)

**Lambda-1**: "Have you located the final POI?"

**Lambda-4**: "Yes sir, eastern wall."

**Lambda-2**: "I don't see him."

**Lambda-4**: "Look closer."

1:40—(//Upon closer inspection POI-XXXX-1 was located, having been wedged between the wall and a loudspeaker, causing it to fall forward and become inoperable. POI-XXXX-1's head had been split open, and a single adult instance of SCP-XXXX is acknowledged burrowing into his brain.//)

**Lambda-2**: "huh, You don't see that often. Bag up the bodies and let's get the hell out of here. Jameson, help me deal with the bathroom."

**Lambda-3**: "Roger that."

SCP-XXXX instances do not hatch easily in conventional conditions, as controlled trials using rats revealed only a ~20% [[footnote]] Subjects were placed into a glass container along with a single instance of SCP-XXXX, then left within the chamber for 5 days. [[/footnote]] successful birthing rate. Use of carcasses during trials reduced this number to ~16%. --It is currently unknown how to keep the number of SCP-XXXX instances in containment at a stable number, as breeding seems unreliable at best.--

> 
> SCP-XXXX's primary anomalous properties were discovered during a routine cleaning of the facility after janitor ███ clocked into SCP-XXXX's testing chamber.
> 
> The janitor ███ had entered the chamber during a trial on grounds of 'routine sweeping' but had been listening to a Bluetooth speaker fastened to his belt, causing him to be unable to hear Researcher Calloway's shouting. Background noise within the chamber immediately spiked to about 95db, whereupon erratic shuffling was noticed from the subject.
> 
> Subject unexpectedly began convulsing before ██ instances of SCP-XXXX violently erupted from its corpse and began hurling themselves against the glass. The janitor ███ did not appear to notice the incident, but Researcher Calloway was able to activate the smokers, neutralizing the instances. The janitor ███ was commended for his contribution and then immediately demoted to D-class for negligence.
 

Following recent discoveries, it has been noted that auditory stimuli meeting certain qualifications (such as bass distortion and a 90db minimal requirement) appears to cause accelerated hatching [[footnote]] Henceforth titled a 'Genesis Event'. [[/footnote]] within subjects. Test trials commenced afterward included the presence of a speaker blaring audio. Birthing rates increased throughout said tests to ~92%. SCP-XXXX can now reliably be replenished for testing. --It is still unknown if any further stimuli can accelerate maturation.--


[[collapsible show="+ Open Testing Log-XXXX" hide="- Close Testing Log-XXXX"]]
> **Preword**: All subjects are to be placed into a glass containment chamber 1m by 1m, along with select instances of SCP-XXXX. These tests are to determine how exactly SCP-XXXX is able to accelerate its incubation process.
> -----
> **Subject**: (1) White rat. (1) SCP-XXXX Instance.
> **Materials**: N.A.
> **Resul**t: Subject is released into containment chamber and is immediately attacked by SCP-XXXX. SCP-XXXX is quickly able to inject larvae into the subject before escaping to the upper-left corner of the container, where it remains for several days. The subject eventually collapses and a Genesis Event occurs; (2) instances hatch within the subject, exiting through its mouth. An autopsy later reports the presence of several deceased larvae.
> -----
> **Subject**: (3) White rats. (1) SCP-XXXX Instance.
> **Materials**: N.A.
> **Results**: Subjects are released into containment chamber and are immediately attacked by SCP-XXXX. SCP-XXXX is successful in injecting one subject before being ripped in half by the pack. The injected subject was immediately removed from containment and a foreign body surgery was performed, which resulted in several surviving larvae being removed. No further damage is reported.
> -----
> **Subject**: (1) White rat. (2) SCP-XXXX Instances.
> **Materials**: N.A.
> **Results**: Subject is released into containment chamber and immediately attacked by SCP-XXXX. Both instances are successful in injecting the subject, but instead of fleeing begin striking its backside. Eventually, one instance is successful in piercing the subjects' skin and burrows itself within the subjects lower back. Subject collapses and Genesis Event results in (5) instances of SCP-XXXX. Autopsy reveals the presence of fewer larvae than previous tests, but not significantly.
> -----
> **Subject**: (2) White rats. (2) SCP-XXXX Instances.
> **Materials**: (1) Portable Bluetooth speaker.
> **Results**: Bluetooth speaker is amplified upwards to 90db and placed directly outside the chamber, and both subjects are released into the containment chamber. SCP-XXXX immediately charges the rats, and Subject 1 is injected before it even fully enters the chamber. Subject 2 frantically scurries to the other side of the chamber and after only 1 hour a Genesis Event produces (14) instances of SCP-XXXX from Subject 1. Instances quickly swarm subject 2 and (12) additional instances emerge after an additional hour. Autopsies reveal significantly fewer larvae persisting in carcasses than previous tests.
> -----
> **Subject**: (1) Black-footed ferret. (4) SCP-XXXX Instances.
> **Materials**: (1) Portable Bluetooth speaker.
> **Results**: Bluetooth speaker is amplified upwards to 95db and placed inside the chamber, and the subject is released into containment. Two instances are able to inject the subject before it completely enters the chamber. 1 instance, the only male of the group, is unable to inject or bite the ferret, instead deciding to enter the ferret's mouth. The male instance is successful and exits seconds later through the subject's skull. 30 minutes after initial contact Genesis Event begins and (25) instances of SCP-XXXX emerge.
> -----
> **Subject**: (1) Desert cottontail. (2) SCP-XXXX Instances.
> **Materials**: (1) Portable Bluetooth speaker. See Results Log.
> **Results**: Bluetooth speaker is amplified upwards to 100db and placed directly inside the chamber, the subject is released shortly afterward. Both instances are successful in injecting the subject just as it bashes the speaker, rendering it inoperable. The subject was later successful in terminating both instances of SCP-XXXX. Just as testing was to conclude a containment breach of SCP-████ occurred, prompting severe flickering in site power. During this time, a fluorescent light illuminating the test chamber began flickering violently, and the subject became erratic. after 10 minutes of violent thrashing, subject's upper back split open and (42) instances of SCP-XXXX emerged.
> -----
> **Subject**: (1) Human male: D-9974. (6) SCP-XXXX Instances.
> **Materials**: (1) Portable Bluetooth speaker. (1) LED strobe light.
> **Results**: [DATA EXPUNGED BY ORDER OF ETHICS COMMITTEE]

Visual stimuli also appear to have an effect on SCP-XXXX events, as irregular or extreme illumination shows to accelerate gestation within host subjects. The exact reasoning behind these reactions is unknown, but it should be noted the incredible increase in growth that hives experience upon encountering these circumstances. It should also be noted that containment procedures have been altered slightly in regards to the aforementioned information: //All shrubland within 8km of Discovery Site-XXXX is to be tested for signs of SCP-XXXX and cleansed of insect life.//

> **Incident Log-XXXX-1**:
> 
> On the date of 1999/06/22 Foundation observationalists overlooking the town of Oak Creek in Routt County, Colorado noted numerous jumbled police reports. Each report remarked complaints of a "loud buzzing noise" resonating from the local area. Local police were delayed by agents while surveyors attempted to triangulate the location in question. GPS tracking eventually led Foundation agents to Soroco High School, where the yearly prom night was being held. MTF Lambda-12 was dispatched.

He was the valedictorian, y' know, always the proper and tidy kid. But, I see him on the dance floor and he just sorta doubles over and pukes all over his date's shoes! I was gonna get a mop and then…There were these bees. No, wasps. Oh, I don't fucking know! but they were there! I watched them just, crawl all out of his face, and they were shining so bright, it was too painful to see what the hell was going on. Nobody but his date noticed, and she was trying so hard to scream over the music, but before you knew it they just started landing on people. One by one they just picked their targets, and everyone just fucking danced! Then the first kid dropped dead."
