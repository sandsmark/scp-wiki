**Item #:** SCP-7000-J

**Object Class:** --Safe-- Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7000-J is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-58. The contents of SCP-7000-J are not to be read aloud under any circumstances. MTF Sigma-395 "Vandal Hordes" are to monitor all global networks for usage of SCP-7000-J-1 and terminate as needed.

**Description:** SCP-7000-J is a book bound in velociraptor skin with pages made of thin iron tablets. How the book came to use the skin of a long-extinct reptile is unknown. The book claims to contain a spell to summon the ████████ ████ Mc████ ████████erson, an extremely powerful and hostile reality-bending entity.

The majority of the book, around 70%, contains the "incantation," which is "Lorem Ipsum" nonsense-Latin placeholder text. --It is believed that this is due to a printing error of a copy of a more dangerous book.--

**Update:** During testing, D-5138 was instructed to speak the contents of SCP-7000-J aloud. This resulted in a dimensional gate materializing at Site-58, through which ████████ ████ Mc████ ████████erson began to enter. D-5138 was terminated and the gate was closed through the simultaneous use of 517 Scranton Reality Anchors duct-taped onto each other.

It has been shown through testing that the words "Lorem Ipsum' followed by vaguely relevant nonsense-Latin is a basic form of archaic reality-bending magic, henceforth known as SCP-7000-J-A.
