**Item #:** SCP-4094

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4094 is to be contained within a standard reinforced steel container, submerged in a liquid oxygen pool inside at a constant temperature of 25 K. If SCP-4094 is to be removed, it is to be packed into a container of spent uranium from decommissioned fuel rods in a standard lead lined container. All materials that come into contact with active SCP-4094 instances are to be destroyed within 1-4 hours of their exposure. Removal of instances of SCP-4094 from Site 94 at any time is strictly prohibited.

In the event of a containment breach, automated systems onsite will send out a distress signal to personnel stationed at Airstrip 40, 50 kilometers from Site 94. Modified air tankers equipped with a “slurry” mixture of supercooled oxygen and ice crystals will be sent to disperse these payloads over the site; all personnel onsite are to be considered lost due to the nature of SCP-4094. In the event of a wider scale containment breach, a rotating schedule of air tankers will attempt to keep the expansion rate of SCP-4094 in check until further assistance arrives.

**Description:** SCP-4094 is a designation for multiple anomalous instances of a single-celled organism of unknown origin. Ranging from 8 to 22 micrometers in size, instances of SCP-4094 share many characteristics with nano-robotic systems previously encountered and researched by the Foundation. However, analysis of SCP-4094 instances have revealed them to be purely organic entities, entering a dormant state of suspended animation at temperatures less than 50K (-223.15° C). At temperatures higher than that, SCP-4094 will emerge from this dormant state and begin to rapidly consume all matter for the sake of both its reproduction and environmental conversion. A short list of some of the byproducts from this process have revealed amino acid sequences, unknown vegetation and flora seeds, and conversion of atmospheric gases. This state will accelerate with rising temperatures until it plateaus at 150° C where it reaches maximum output.

The potential origins of SCP-4094 are currently unknown. Since its discovery in 19██ in Antarctica by a USSR research team conducting ice core drillings of the subglacial Lake Vostok, efforts of research into SCP-4094 in attempts to classify it have failed to concretely state what it might be. Despite being a single-celled organism, instances of it have been shown to work together with no known method of communication, and will not compete with each other for resources. It has alternated description of prokaryotic, eukaryotic, viral, or even bacterial, with further hypotheses including SCP-4094 being a motile environmental prion, an “enviro-phage”, or an non-terrestrial colonizer. It is currently unknown if SCP-4094 is sentient or not; attempts at testing this have been discontinued due to the risks that an active instance of SCP-4094 possesses. 

SCP-4094 has been shown to be highly resilient to multiple methods of destruction, including:
* Submersion in acids with a pH level of 1.3
* Submersion in molten tungsten at temperatures exceeding 7,500° C
* Subjection to 100G of atmospheric pressure
* Explosive force equivalent to 35 KT of conventional munitions

Freezing instances of SCP-4094 at temperatures in the dormant range and then subjecting them to a modified hydraulic press has been shown capable of destroying them. However, this method is inefficient for large scale cleanup operations of SCP-4094. Research attempts into large scale efforts to destroy or adapt SCP-4094 are underway (refer to ‘Project Grenadier’ for further information). Subjection of SCP-4094 to a constant radiation dosage of 50 Sv every hour will inhibit SCP-4094 and force it into a dormant state, but will not neutralize its instances. Further testing regarding higher doses of radiation have been proposed, but have not been conducted out of concern regarding contamination risks.

Despite testing, there is no temperature limit found that will inhibit SCP-4094’s growth. Temperatures in excess of 7,500° C have been applied to it previously, but will not inhibit it in a way similar to lower temperatures. At its active threshold, a single instance of SCP-4094 will consume a 1m x 1m x 1m cube of organic matter in approximately 4 hours, and produce 256 other instances during that time. Non-organic materials will take 2-3 times longer to be consumed and converted. Although new instances of SCP-4094 will take 24 hours to maturate, they will increase their potential consumptive capacity until they reach their full potential. Non-maturated SCP-4094 instances are capable of asexual reproduction within 30 minutes of their creation. Given the exponential growth rate of even the mere threshold of its active state, an uncontrolled SCP-4094 containment breach can poses an XK-class end of the world scenario if not properly contained.

As of the containment breach of April 21st, 199█, any testing of SCP-4094 with living multicellular organisms is discontinued.

Following the containment breach of 200█, further investigations into the origins of SCP-4094 were started by researchers at Site 94. Although a multiplicity of opinions emerged during that time, the most common thread among them that emerged was that SCP-4094 was non-terrestrial in origin. This was arrived at after multiple studies were conducted of the amino acid sequences that are observed in it, its conversion of the environment around it, and additionally the circumstances of its discovery.

**I) Origins and Risks of SCP-4094:** Further analysis of Lake Vostok and additional ice cores have revealed high concentrations of SCP-4094 instances in it. Its composition of liquid oxygen and hydrogen with no other mixtures or elements present, leads researchers at Site 94 to speculate that Lake Vostok is not a natural geographic feature. Its creation was likely done by a non-terrestrial entity or one that is no longer extant in order to curtail the growth and of SCP-4094. Discoveries of places of interest along the Voyeykov Ice Shelf and near Mount Erebus lead us to believe that 32 and 35 million years ago Lake Vostok was created as the result of a mass event we call the ‘Vostok Occurrence’, coinciding with a rapid global climate shift and mass extinction event. While the global climate was shifting towards colder temperatures during that period, the rapid change during the period of the Vostok Occurence paired with discoveries made since starting Project Grenadier indicate that an entity of unknown origin either began or greatly accelerated this process.

Lake Vostok thereby exists as a “lid” for further instances of SCP-4094. Given the density of SCP instances in core samples taken from Vostok since SCP-4094’s discovery, if the glacial ice sheet above Lake Vostok melts in accordance with our most conservative models it is likely that an XK-class end of the world scenario is nearly unavoidable. Even with the considerable resources that the Foundation possesses, should the Lake Vostok containment fail, our models indicate anywhere from a .37%-5% chance of successful post-breach containment using all available known Foundation assets. Biosphere recovery after a runaway SCP-4094 event will be incredibly difficult, if not outright impossible. Worldwide casualties that would result from an uncontrolled SCP-4094 release are hard to accurately gauge in the models examined by Project Grenadier, but can be assumed to be catastrophic if not outright apocalyptic.

**II) SCP-4094 and Interstellar Events:** On August 15th, 197█, a USA-based radio telescope recorded a significant extrasolar radio signal originating from the Sagittarius constellation. This event coincided with a containment breach at Site 94, in which SCP-4094 emerged from its dormant state despite it being cooled to 40 K. SCP-4094 began multiplying at a rate far higher than previously observed at its most efficient range, and in 6 hours, an estimated ██ personnel had been lost in the incident. A wider containment breach was avoided only by the deployment of a liquid oxygen mixture supercooled to 25 K, followed by SCP-4094 falling gradually into a dormant state once more.

At the time, this incident was chalked up to the erraticism of SCP-4094 and the poorly understood mechanics of it. Deducing the relationship of SCP-4094 and its response to radio signals like that of of the 8-15-7█ incident was complicated due to both the high staff turnover rate at Site 94, as well as the high casualty rate (estimated to be higher than 90% of all other sites in 2000). However, patterns began to emerge with repeated examination of SCP-4094’s periods of increased agitation and activity following extrasolar radio transmissions. Since the 8-15-7█ incident, there have been a total of 1█ incidents averaging an occurrence rate of 1 every 3.15 years that have put SCP-4094 into heavily agitated states. All of these incidents have coincided with extrasolar radio signals, all of which (with the exception of the one in the 200█ incident) have originated from distant star systems with stars extremely similar to Earth’s. The range of these stars from Earth have ranged from 9█.█ light-years from Earth, to 3.█ billion.

**Response:**
Given that SCP-4094 is demonstrably hostile to all Earth-based life, we propose that the researchers of Site 94 be tasked with reverse-engineering its genetic makeup. The purpose of this is manyfold:
* Containment - In the event of a containment breach by SCP-4094, a modified SCP-4094-A could be potentially deployed to combat the rapid spread of SCP-4094. By being tailor-made to combat and re-combinate materials in an Earth-friendly manner, SCP-4094-A would help alleviate some of the operating expenses of the Foundation and the difficulty in containing widespread outbreaks of SCP-4094.
* “Lazarus Initiative” - A modified SCP-4094 instance could be sent on Foundation satellites and deep-space probes to prospective worlds where, once deployed, SCP-4094-A could assist in preserving the human race. This would be beneficial both from the risks that SCP-4094-A proposes, as well as those posed by many other anomalous artifacts and instances.
* Retaliatory - Discussion of SCP-4094 carries the unbidden assumption that eventually containment procedures will fail at all levels. A modified SCP-4094-A will function essentially as the long arm of the dead, and will return the favor of SCP-4094 to its creators, wherever they are.

We eagerly await the Council’s deliberation on this topic, and look forward to further discussion regarding these points that we have made.

Sincerely,
Drs. Carter, Bormann, Heinkel, Kauf, Noe, Jordan, Volkov, Amur, and Golf

//Decoding of the September 1st, 200█ ‘Jacob’s Ladder’ signal took researchers at Site 94 thirteen months. The signal, lasting for 2 minutes and 4 seconds, was broadcast on several differing frequencies. Despite attempts to capture the message again, due to difficulties in recording the first half minute of broadcast from horizon blockage, researchers were unable to detect it again. A transcript of the decoded message follows://


**00:37** - {{... Vvarog sub-clade Ithun-clade at 7721-Urt non-invocd no return sig to Overt Vvarog-clade repeating pre-cast for continued directories at constant influx ...}} 

[previous message repeats twice]

**00: 59** - {{... Vvarog clade rcv directory influx type of [indecipherable] Overmind Conduit of Vaga-Vvarog trans-directs Vvarog sub-clade Ithun-clade at 7721-Urt procd sow and stand for continued directories at constant influx...}} 

[message plays once more]

**01:44** - {{...Vvarog sub-clade Ithun-clade at 7721-Urt salt sow stand for continued directories from Vvarog-Conduits continued directories procd 2-2.4 yyirn until 10 yyirn into 0 yyirn. Ostlam retains pri-desig remains [unknown]...}}

//The current meaning of this message remains unknown. Origin of the signal was recorded in the direction of  [REDACTED] with a G-class star and a single orbiting planet.//

//On May 15, 201█, another message came from the same star, a first since the Foundation began to monitor these transmissions. All records of this message were confiscated immediately by Foundation personnel, and Class-A amnestics administered. Records were falsified that indicated that the message received on May 15th was relatively minor, while Foundation personnel worked to decrypt the original broadcast. The decoded message follows.//

{{Invoc-VVAR - Determ of 7721-Urt non-dip with act extant forms. Vvarog sends continuous directories sow sow sow to Vvarog sub-clade Ithun-clade until directory which indics disembark Vvarog-Conduits and MAKDR. Without pri-indic directory cont attempts of directory sow sow sow. If indic of Vvarog-Conduits and MAKDR is rcv new trans-directs Vvarog sub-clade Ithun-clade into directory wait wait wait silence wait wait wait into prosper. Post-prosper await directory influx entails disembark. Retain Ostlam pri-desig and dis-r directory stems bearing Invoc-EROG -AVNA -UMST -DARK. Directory stems bearing pri-desigs stand Ostlam.}}

//The May 15th message repeated for 107 times over the next 3 hours and 44 minutes. Foundation personnel at Site 94 and at Airstrip 40 were on full alert and standby for the entirety of the broadcast. SCP-4094 was, however, unresponsive for the duration of the message and gave no indication of emerging from its dormant state.//
