**Item #:** SCP-693

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** --As all instances of SCP-693 are considered Safe, Researchers involved in testing may keep any instance of SCP-693 in their office.-- After Incident 693/A/050, all instances of SCP-693 are to be returned to regulation containment locker 12C-K when not in use. 

As of Incident 693/E, all instances of SCP-693 have been reclassified as Euclid. As such, each instance of SCP-693 is to be contained in a separate steel containment box, measuring 9cmx9cmx9cm. Each containment box is still to be stored inside regulation containment locker 12-C-K.

When testing on SCP-693, it is imperative that only hair from the head of the subject be used. At no point should any researcher directly access SCP-693 when it is in an attuned state. All hair should be removed from SCP-693 by the D-Class involved in its testing before it is returned to researchers
