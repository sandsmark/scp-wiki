**INVASION WARNING**

Okay folks, we've just had a visitor called HAGGER vandalise everything to the best of his ability.

But don't panic. Nothing is deleted. Only Admins have the ability to delete anything.

**I would like to give a big hand to resident member Snorlison who pretty much single handedly fixed most of the site. Thanks Buddy! I mean it!**

The site should be back to normal soon.

If you come across any come across any pages that aren't supposed to be that way, you can go to the bottom, hit histories, and revert the page to what it used be by hitting the "R" next to that version. If there is none, that means the original page has been renamed, and can be found in "Site Tools", under the "Orphaned pages" tab. You might have to troll through it to find the page you're looking for, but it's there.

There are still images of his on some of the more obscure forum pages, but whatever you do, do not delete the page, merely delete the the post b going into edit, and wiping the entire post.

If you can't do that, contact a mod or admin, and tell them where it is.

**MEMO TO STAFF**

Dear staff,

Today, the entire foundation came under attack.  SCP was breached in multiple areas, and a untold amount of documents have been leaked.  This damage has been repaired in the majority, however the final clean-up may take months.  The full damage done may never be fully totaled.

We have been lax.  Site security has been tightened.  Such a embarrassing breech of site security will not be allowed to happen again.  Thank you for your vigilance.  

Dr.Gears
