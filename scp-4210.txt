**Item #:** SCP-4210

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4210 is to be placed in a safe secure box at Site-██. SCP-4210 houses are to have 2m high fences installed around the perimeter of the land, under the guise of construction works. Buildings neighbouring and adjacent from SCP-4210 houses are to be purchased by The Foundation, with at least one building utilised as guard barracks and research laboratory. Four guards are to be placed on the perimeter of SCP-4210 in disguise as construction workers in six-hour rotating shifts. Any and all persons attempting to enter an SCP-4210 house without approval from on-site Level 3 researcher are to be detained and administered Class A amnestics. Windows are to be heavily tinted on SCP-4210 houses to prevent a security breach. Persons leaving SCP-4210 houses after being removed by other entities are to be interviewed and sent to Site-██ for Psychological Evaluation and amnestic treatment.

**Description:** SCP-4210 is an anomalous residential floor plan, printed on white A3 bond paper. It is supposedly produced by architectural company S███████ Inc., due to its stamped lettering on the bottom left corner, however, no records or evidence of the company ever existing can be found. SCP-4210 has a coffee mug stain on the bottom right-hand corner and two messages on the backside scribbled in blue pen ink, "The American Dream. Our Dream. 19██" and in the same but smaller more messy handwriting "Japan **[ILLEGIBLE]**-lesses me because this - **改善**[[footnote]] Translated from Japanese meaning, "Change for the better" [[/footnote]] - this is exactly what we've been looking for. I don't know Japanese, but my contact showed me and it works. **[ILLEGIBLE]** finally be perfect. - J". Houses built using SCP-4210 are identical in material, size and room numbers, only differing in furnishings. The Foundation is currently aware of 5 SCP-4210 houses, all residing in the USA.

SCP-4210 entities occupying an SCP-4210 house express strong desires to make themselves and other entities "perfectionists".[[footnote]] Identifying themselves as "family" [[/footnote]] The "perfection" the entities strive for, is directly reminiscent of American 1950s Nuclear family stereotypes as detailed below. At any one time these is only ever a maximum of four (one of each entity type) SCP-4210 entities in an SCP-4210 house.

[[collapsible show="▶ SCP-4210-A \"Father\"" hide="▼ SCP-4210-A \"Father\""]]
SCP-4210-A can only be the following criteria:
* Human
* Biological Male 
* Between the age of 25-50

SCP-4210-A exhibits behaviour typical of a fatherly figure towards SCP-4210-C and -D, referring to them as "Children" or "Son" or "Daughter". SCP-4210-A refers to SCP-4210-B as it's "wife" and shows symptoms known to be common with romantic attraction. SCP-4210-C and -D refer to it as "Father".

Daily routines often include; dressing itself into business attire, exclaiming objectively unamusing jokes, watching television programs and simultaneously consuming alcoholic beverages, and participating in "catch" with SCP-4210-C.

[[collapsible show="▶ SCP-4210-B \"Mother\"" hide="▼ SCP-4210-B \"Mother\""]]
SCP-4210-B can only be the following criteria:
* Human
* Biological Female 
* Between the age of 25-50

SCP-4210-B exhibits behaviour typical of a motherly figure toward SCP-4210-C and -D, also referring to them as "Children", "Son" or "Daughter". SCP-4210-B refers to SCP-4210-A as "Husband". SCP-4210-C and -D refer to it as "Mother".

Daily routines often include; producing meals and beverages for itself and other entities, cleaning previously used cutlery, plates and bowls, using vacuum to clean floor of entire SCP-4210 house, nurturing SCP-4210-C and -D appropriately for entities age, reading magazines and conversing with SCP-4210-A about its day.

[[collapsible show="▶ SCP-4210-C \"Son\"" hide="▼ SCP-4210-C \"Son\""]]
SCP-4210-C can only be the following criteria:
* Human
* Biological Male 
* Between the age of 1-17

SCP-4210-C exhibits typical behaviours befitting a child/teenager, depending on the age of the entity before the transformation. If SCP-4210-C is under 5 years old it will be completely dependent on SCP-4210-B for food and basic survival and as such will spend most of its time in SCP-4210-B's vicinity. 

Daily routines (ages 5-17) often include; Playing catch with SCP-4210-A, expressing hatred of the colour pink, fighting with SCP-4210-D, throwing sticks from the back garden and attempting to steal foods with high sugar counts without SCP-4210-B knowing.

[[collapsible show="▶ SCP-4210-D \"Daughter\"" hide="▼ SCP-4210-D \"Daughter\""]]
SCP-4210-D can only be the following criteria:
* Human
* Biological Female 
* Between the age of 1-17

Similarly to SCP-4210-C, SCP-4210-D exhibits typical behaviours befitting a child/teenager, depending on the age of the entity before the transformation. If SCP-4210-D is under 5 years old it will be completely dependent on SCP-4210-B for food and basic survival and as such will spend most of its time in SCP-4210-B's vicinity.

Daily routines (ages 5-17) often include; finding enjoyment using dolls and dollhouses, expressing hatred of the colour blue, braiding SCP-4210-B's hair, physically fighting with SCP-4210-C and running around its house making noises of the //Equus caballus// genus.[[footnote]] Commonly known as horses [[/footnote]]

------

A subject entering an SCP-4210 House, that fits criteria for an SCP-4210 entity that yet exists in the house, will gradually start to exhibit behaviours of the respective SCP-4210 entity. Should the subject remain inside SCP-4210 house for ~2 hours, they will become an SCP-4210 entity. Should the subject be removed at any time before this point, they will report feeling slightly dazed and return to their regular behaviour and personality within an hour. 

Should the subject match the criteria of an existing entity, the unmatching entities will unanimously decide if the subject or the matching entity is to "join the family", depending on which individual is more "desirable" for the entities. No verbal communication occurs for this to happen and it is theorised that the entities are telepathically linked or perhaps act as a hive mind during these decisions. (See Interview Log D-13564) Should the subject be accepted into the "family", it is designated SCP-4210-A through -D appropriately and the previous entity is removed from the "family" and house by the entities.

**Discovery:** On ██/██/19██ local police were called to the report of a disturbance in residential ██████, CA. Upon arriving at the scene police discovered a man running down █████ St. wearing only underwear, shouting "How could they replace me!" continuously for ~7 minutes. When brought in for questioning at the local police station, the man named M██████ Scratton explained that he was eating dinner with his family at his home, when a stranger knocked on his door. In under 15 minutes, Mr Scratton was removed from his home with only his underwear and SCP-4210 in his possession. 

The Foundation was alerted when an agent embedded in the police station notified local Site-██ agents about the anomaly. Witnesses and police involved were administered amnestics and Mr Scratton was questioned about the origins of the floor plan and any locations of other houses using its design. Mr Scratton refused to answer about the origins, however gave the location of 4 more houses. He was unwilling to share how he knew of these houses. Mr Scratton was subsequently administered amnestics and released to the public under Foundation watch.

[[collapsible show="▶ Interview Log D-13564" hide="▼ Interview Log D-13564"]]
On ██/██/198█, D-Class subject D-13564, a 34-year-old male, entered SCP-4210-05 and was instructed to remain inside for 3 hours in order to become SCP-4210-A. After a period of 4 hours, D-Class subject D-92873, a 29-year-old male who matched the same criteria as D-13564, but was more athletically built, was instructed to enter the house. After approximately 21 minutes D-13564 was observed exiting the house in a distraught panic. Interview follows:

> **Interviewed:** D-13564
> **Interviewer:** Dr. A████
> 
> **<Begin Log ██/██/200█ 13:02:44>**
> 
> **Dr. A████:** Hello D-13564, my name is Dr. A████, I'm going to ask you a few questions.
> 
> **D-13564:** My family literally just kicked me out, don't you people have any sympathy.
> 
> **Dr. A████:** We just need you to cooperate with us and tell us how you feel about everything that went on in those four hours.
> 
> **D-13564:** Perfect.
> 
> **Dr. A████:** Sorry?
> 
> **D-13564:** Perfect. It was perfect, we were perfect. We complimented each other so well, we flowed as a family, there was nothing that could stop us. If we couldn't do something together it was because it was impossible.
> 
> **Dr. A████:** What sort of activities could you do in such a short time to feel that way?
> 
> **D-13564:** We cooked together, played chasey with the kids, watched a movie together until.. well until he came in.
> 
> **Dr. A████:** Until D-92873 entered the house?
> 
> **D-13564:** I don't know his number but yeah I assume that's the piece of shit.
> 
> **Dr. A████:** What occurred when D-92873 entered the house?
> 
> **D-13564:** Well we welcomed him in, of course, we weren't going to be rude we were better than that. He came in and we started talking about everything that was going on with him and he was quite interesting, younger and probably more attractive than me. Which was exactly why I started to worry.
> 
> **Dr. A████:** What did you feel that made you worry about him?
> 
> **D-13564:** I had a feeling. I'm not sure what it was, just a feeling that something was wrong. I could see the way the kids and the wife were talking to him. They were more and more impressed with every word he was saying. I thought to myself that I was surely better than him in some way, right? //[D-13564 looks extremely distressed and stares at Dr. A████ for 14 seconds.]//
> 
> **Dr. A████:** What is it?
> 
> **D-13564:** It just that, as soon as I thought that. The immediate second I thought that thought. That I had to be better in some way, the kids and my wife looked at me, angrily and in at the same time said: "No, you aren't good enough." //[D-13564 begins to tear up, before getting visibly angry]// It was //you//.
> 
> **Dr. A████:** What was me?
> 
> **D-13564:** You sent in that son of a bitch to see my reaction. You knew this would happen. You knew I would lose my family.
> 
> **Dr. A████:** They weren't your family.
> 
> **D-13564:** How **fucking** dare you mess around with my family like that.
> 
> **Dr. A████:** D-13564 you need to calm down or there will be serious repercussions.
> 
> **D-13564:** I want a new one.
> 
> **Dr. A████:** You want a new what?
> 
> **D-13564:** A new family. A perfect family and I don't want you fuckers to mess around with it.
> 
> **Dr. A████:** We won't send you back in there in the foreseeable future, may I remind you of the agreement you have with the Foundation.
> 
> **D-13564:** I don't care about the agreement, you don't understand what it's like to be so close to perfection, only to have some other assholes take it from you!
> 
> **Dr. A████:** There's nothing to be done for you, you're to be psychologically evaluated and assigned elsewhere, per the agreement.
> 
> **D-13564:** At least someday I'll find that sort of perfection again, I'll make it mine and you eggheads will get none of it. //[D-13564 spits on Dr. A████ and is promptly subdued by supervising guards]//
> 
> **<End Log ██/██/200█ 13:07:56>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** Subjects exiting houses after being entities seem to have a need or almost an addiction to finding their perfect version of themselves and families. Class-B amnestic treatment is successful to reverse and remove this effect and as such should be used on all individuals exiting houses unless otherwise specified by researchers.

My Dearest E███,

I'm hoping this letter finds you well. It's gone wrong. Everything I dreaded would happen has come to pass. M██████ has taken the plans for himself. He says he's going to build the perfect America out of it. I told him that that wasn't the purpose of the plans, and in fact, the purpose couldn't be further from that. He says he can make improvements to it, tweak it, so everyone can strive to be better. To be perfect. 
@@ @@
All I wanted was for us to be together and raise a family we could be proud of. By the time you're reading this it may already be too late for me, but who knows right? Maybe I'll get another miracle from Japan. More a curse in disguise I guess now. When M██████ took the plans he threatened me with a gun, can you believe it? I don't think he meant to shoot, that damn idiot, but here we are. 
@@ @@
If you get this message please, try and get the plans back, but be careful. M██████ is doing anything he can to achieve his goals, and I couldn't stand the thought of you getting in harm's way for me. 
@@ @@
Have a wonderful life E███, but don't try to make it perfect. You never even had to try. 
I love you.
