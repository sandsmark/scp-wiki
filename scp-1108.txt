**Item #:** SCP-1108

**Object Class:** Euclid
 
**Special Containment Procedures:** The two centers of meteorological research closest to areas previously affected by SCP-1108 are under Foundation surveillance. All data recorded by these sites is transmitted to Research Sector-09, and should be consistently monitored for similarities to past data, so that a recurrence of SCP-1108 and its potential triggers can be promptly identified and studied. 
  
**Description:** SCP-1108 is a phenomenon local to the southwest coast of the United States, with the appearance and composition of a low-lying stratus cloud. To observers on the ground, either inside or adjacent to the formation, SCP-1108 has the same characteristics as a heavy fog. However, from the right angle and elevation the cloud formation has the distinct shape and relative proportions of an alligator. Prolonged observations indicate that this formation even moves, albeit slowly, with the same gait as the reptile it resembles.   

The first recorded appearance of this phenomenon is dated 19██, filed in Foundation records as an Extranormal Event. At least ten repeat-occurrences have since been verified, precipitating numbered status and closer observation. 

Appearances of SCP-1108 seem to take place around dawn, usually at a dew point and temperature consistent with fog formation, and never lasting for more than six hours. The effects of the phenomenon, however, do not become apparent until after its departure. These effects have so far included an abnormal rise in fresh water levels and, most notably, what appears to be an abnormal displacement of local wildlife.     

Specifically, in areas directly overshadowed by SCP-1108's passage, //Alligator mississippiensis// have been found to congregate in alarming numbers on private property or public spaces, particularly swimming pools. 

Because of the lack of data on prior occurrences, it is presently unknown whether the size, range, or extent of the phenomenon's influence have increased over time. As recorded appearances to not seem to follow any regular interval, possible causes-- whether natural or influenced by human activity --are likewise unknown. 

**Excerpt from Field Report 1108-16**
[[Collapsible show="+open"]]
> Notable events which took place within 24 hours of SCP-1108's appearance over P████ B████ County:
> * Within 2185.2 square meters of residential space, over thirty seven reports of juvenile and adult American alligators on private property were made, regardless of the properties' proximity to wetland, lakes, or canals. One woman woke to find an adult male specimen inside of her kitchen; reports estimated it to be 4m in length. 
> * Three non-fatal attacks on humans, one resulting in significant injury. 
> * Thirteen reports of missing pets.  
> The ███████ Water Management District recorded an average of 16.5 cm rise in local water levels, despite the lack of precipitation. 
>  
> Local wildlife control had sufficient manpower to prevent undue fatalities; however, it is uncertain whether the intrusion of //Alligator mississippiensis// was simply a displacement of existing creatures or indicative of a significant population increase.
>  
> Necessary information-control protocols were enacted without incident.

**Addendum:** During the latest occurrence of SCP-1108, field researchers reported hearing a series of low, drawn-out rumbles, sustained over several hours. 

Radiometric measurements taken during the course of these observations do not indicate temperature changes conducive to creating lightning. However, the subsequent recordings do bear a striking resemblance to the male alligator's [http://www.fws.gov/video/sounds/27alligator2bellow.mp3 bellow].
