**Item #:** SCP-1108

**Object Class:** Euclid
 
**Special Containment Procedures:** The three centers of meteorological research closest to areas previously affected by SCP-1108 are under Foundation surveillance. All data recorded by these sites will be transmitted to Research Sector-09, and should be consistently monitored for similarities to past data. 

Early signs of a recurrence of SCP-1108 must be promptly identified.
  
**Description:** SCP-1108 is a phenomenon with the appearance and composition of a low-lying stratus cloud, which has only been observed along the southwest coast of the United States-- particularly the east coast of ███████. Observers on the ground, either inside or adjacent to the formation, experience SCP-1108 as a heavy fog. 

However, from an elevation above or approaching 450 m, this formation reveals the distinct shape and relative proportions of an alligator; a resemblance exact enough that eyelids, teeth and individual scutes can be clearly identified.  Prolonged observations indicate that this formation even moves its "limbs", albeit slowly, with a gait reminiscent of the indigenous reptile's.   

The first recorded appearance of this phenomenon is dated 19██, filed in Foundation records as an Extranormal Event. However, at least ten repeat-occurrences have since been verified, precipitating numbered status and close observation[[footnote]] Containment proposals should be submitted to Drs Dhara and Dhruva for review. [[/footnote]].  

Appearances of SCP-1108 usually occur a few ours before dawn, usually at a dew point and temperature consistent with fog formation. The "gator formation" maintains its distinct size and shape for upward six hours. During this six hour period, SCP-1108 traverses a distance of approximately 50 km, before appearing to gradually dissipate into the atmosphere.     

The effects of the phenomenon, however, do not become apparent until after its departure. These effects have so far included an abnormal rise in water levels and, most notably, an abnormal displacement of local wildlife. Specifically, in areas directly overshadowed by SCP-1108's passage, //Alligator mississippiensis// have been found to congregate in alarming numbers on private property or public spaces, particularly swimming pools. 

Because of the lack of data on prior occurrences, it is presently unknown whether the size, range, or extent of the phenomenon's influence have increased over time. --Recorded appearances, however, seem to follow a regular interval, occurring up to three times every two years, always preceding the "wet season" of June-September.-- (//see Addendum//)
 
**Excerpt from Field Report 1108-16**
[[Collapsible show="+open"]]
> Notable events which took place within 24 hours of SCP-1108's appearance over P████ B████ County:
> * Within 2185.2 square meters of residential space, over thirty seven reports of juvenile and adult American alligators on private property were made, regardless of the properties' proximity to wetland, lakes, or canals. One woman woke to find an adult male specimen inside of her kitchen; reports estimated it to be 4m in length. 
> * Three non-fatal attacks on humans, one resulting in significant injury. 
> * Thirteen reports of missing pets.  
> The ███████ Water Management District recorded an average of 16.5 cm rise in drainage canal levels, despite the lack of precipitation. Considering that the majority of inhabited areas are kept above the waterline by an extensive network of such drainage canals, a significant rise in any freshwater levels has the potential to be massively damaging.  
>  
> Local wildlife control had sufficient manpower to prevent undue fatalities; however, it is uncertain whether the intrusion of //Alligator mississippiensis// was simply a displacement of existing creatures or indicative of a significant population increase.
>  
> Necessary information-control protocols were enacted without incident.

**Addendum 7/1/██** As of 6/21/██, there have been two observed appearances of SCP-1108. Only the second was accompanied by an increase in the presence of //Alligator mississippiensis//; however, the rise in water levels mandated evacuation in two counties. The extent of the infestation of //Alligator mississippiensis// in flooded areas cannot be determined, at this time. 

**Addendum 7/9/██:** During the most recent occurrence, field researchers reported a previously unrecorded phenomenon-- described as "a series of low, drawn-out rumbles", which were sustained over several hours. 

Radiometric measurements taken during the course of these observations do not indicate temperature changes conducive to creating lightning. However, the subsequent recordings do bear a striking resemblance to the male alligator's [http://www.fws.gov/video/sounds/27alligator2bellow.mp3 bellow].
