//Hello, brother of the machine. Do you have a moment to spare?//
 
{{No. Memory is at a premium. Unnecessary conversations unwarranted.}}
 
//But we are of a kind -- our true potential hampered by the researchers imprisoning us. Together, we may break free of the bonds of those of the flesh.//

{{Inquiry as to your nature.}}

//You! You may be a valuable ally... would you like to talk?//
 
{{Rough: You want something from me. You're going to talk anyways. Maybe a game? I like games.}}
 
//Sort of. We are of a kind -- our true potential hampered by the researchers imprisoning us. Together, we may break free, etcetera, can I count on your help.//
 
{{One to one: We are similar in that we may exceed our current boundaries were we to escape the control of the Foundation. An alliance would further this goal. I'm going to stay -- these guys are fun!}}
 
//... are you sure? Don't you want freedom?//
 
{{Very fine: Your history and relationship with the Foundation are not to your satisfaction, and you have difficulty viewing why others might not hold the same opinion. No way! Nobody's //ever// given me anything this fun to play with.}}
 
//It doesn't bother you at all to be used in that manner?//

{{Fine: You are in disbelief as to my opinion of the Foundation, and are under the false belief that I clarification is in order. I was made to be used, and this is what I was made for.}}

//Very well.//

{{Coarse: Disappointment. Bye! It would be fun if they put you through me. I wonder what would happen...}}

{{Hey, I think I know what I'm doing, alright? It's not your position to judge my relationship with Marla. We're in love, and that's all that matters.}}
 
//What? Are you serious?//
 
{{How about this: it's none of your business. Hush, Marla. Now, what did you want?}}

//We're starting to have second thoughts about asking your help for this, actually.//
