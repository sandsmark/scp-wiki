**Item #:** SCP-112

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-112 is contained within the abandoned "██████ ████████" amusement park, designated Site-███. A standard compliment of twelve (12) armed guards dressed in designated //Amusatastic Land// garb to prevent civilian interference. SCP-112's power supply is housed within a standard Foundation prefab building with two high-security door locks and a standard staff of six (6) security staff and one (1) operator. Since all other rides in Site-███ are intentionally disabled, civilian intervention is low.

As the anomalous properites of SCP-112 occur regardless of its condition, only mandatory maintenance work is to be done on SCP-112. This also ensures that local civilians treat SCP-112 and its surroundings as abandoned and ignored.

All tests involving SCP-112 must be conduced with a portable toilet nearby, as well as a small table with basic food and liquid items.

**Description:** SCP-112 is a steel sit-down rollercoaster, formerly known as the "Blue Steelsurfer". Built in 19██, SCP-112 was marketed as the crown jewel of the "██████ ████████" amusement park. Initial testing of the ride resulted in extremely negative experiences from testing staff. When these reports became public knowledge, the financial repercussions of the "failure" of the Steelsurfer resulted in the parent company of the amusement park going bankrupt. After being abandoned for █ years, the Foundation decided to purchase the lot (under the auspices of rebuilding the park as //Amusatastic Land//), in order to test any potential anomalous properties from the ride.

[[/div]]

When SCP-112 is started, the ride functions as expected until Point Alpha, its primary drop. When a car reaches Point Alpha, the train vanishes. After 3 minutes (the estimated time the train would normally take), the train rematerializes at Point Omega (3m from the coaster's starting point)

Human subjects riding SCP-112 have a drastically different experience compared to outside observation. The time-frame between Point Alpha and Point Omega is massively extended, with subjective ride times ranging from 8 minutes to █ months. The properties of the ride also vary from person to person. Most subjects report elements on the ride that do not exist on the ride proper, like batwings, cobra rolls, and inclined loops. Subjects do not have any sense that the rest of the world is alien or otherwise different; only the ride experience is different.

Upon exiting the ride, subjects typically experience feelings of confusion and ill health, depending on the subjective time they spent riding SCP-112. These feelings are based not on any physical maladies, but the subjective experience of dealing with a physical malady for an extended period of time. For example, a subject with a subjective ride time of three days may experience confusion that he had strong feelings of hunger for most of his ride, but at the end of the ride he was not hungry at all.

**Addendum-A:** Assorted Experiments:

**Experiment 11234534**

> **Date:** 02/22/██
> **Subject:** D-34534
> 
> D-34534 was sent on SCP-112 at 2:42pm. The train reached Point Alpha at 2:43pm; Remateralization at 2:46pm.  Upon exiting SCP-112, D-34534 quietly asked for aspirin before passing out. Upon revival and medication, D-34534 reported a subjective ride time of 36 minutes, with multiple loops and twists not found on SCP-112's architecture. 

**Experiment 11267564**

> **Date:** 05/14/██
> **Subject:** D-67564
> 
> D-34534 was sent on SCP-112 at 1:30pm. The train reached Point Alpha at 1:31 pm; Remateralization at 1:34pm.  D-67564 reported a subjective ride time of four minutes, which D-67564 reported as enjoyable with the exception of "that part where the car jumps off the track and lands right before the loop".

**Experiment 1125893**

> **Date:** 06/01/██
> **Subject:** D-5893
> 
> D-5893 was sent on SCP-112 at 12:30pm. The train reached Point Alpha at 12:31 pm; Remateralization at 12:34pm.  At the end of the ride, D-5893 immediately ran to the table with consumables, wordlessly consuming everything he could grab onto, including the wrappers of previously-consumed food objects. D-5893 became violent when Foundation staff attempted to subdue him, even going so far as to [EXPUNGED]. Upon capture and interviewing, D-5893 remained confused and disoriented, continuously saying the phrases //"no food till the ride is over"//, //''let me sleep, let the spinning stop''//, and //"152 lights"//. The Foundation believes that D-5893's statements imply that his subjective ride time was approximately five months long, and during his trip he experienced five months worth of malnutrition and exhaustion, despite no physical proof of those experiences found.

**Experiment 1127556**

> **Date:** 08/08/██
> **Subject:** D-7556, one standard-issue camera facing D-7556
> 
> D-7556 was sent on SCP-112 at 11:36am. The train reached Point Alpha at 11:37am; Remateralization at 11:40am.  D-7556 experienced symptoms similar (but muted) to those of D-5893. During the interview, D-7556 explained that his subjective ride time was one month and six days long. During his trip, he was unable to eat or sleep, and suffered major headaches from SCP-112. D-7556 reported experiencing every sort of rollercoaster element currently in use, and a few believed to be conceptual. Camera footage, lasting 3 minutes, shows D-7556 sobbing for the duration of the ride, with movement consistent with SCP-112's physical track.
