**Item #:** SCP-????-J

**Object Class:** i dunno 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-????-J's box is currently kept in a containment cell 200m x 200m x 200m in size. SCP-????-J's box is comprised of multiple layers of tele-kill shielding, tantalum hafnium carbide, an outer layer of a graphene/carbyne lattice, and decorated with a vantablack floral stencil pattern.

This container is locked with multiple redundant locking mechanisms that are presumed to decrease the likelihood of unauthorized access. These locks are labelled SCP-????-1 through SCP-????---41-- 44 and materialize and dematerialize in random intervals. At most times, the box appears as a 1m^^3^^ sheen black cube, bearing a single hinged compartment.


**Description:** SCP-????-J is the designation for an anomaly of unknown specification, currently locked in this fucking box. It's been in Site-44 for as long as anyone can remember, and, honestly, no one knows where the fuck it came from. It's locked in with a bazillion gizmos, and they all show up randomly on the sides of the box. Anything- keypads, combination locks, time-based Sudoku puzzles, you name it. The thing is locked --tighter than Clef's butthole--.


Anyway, we are making progress, probably. Every time we solve something, or we think we do, the box makes this tone and we never see that specific bastard lock again. I think it's working. Some of them have timers on their sides, counting down. Sometimes a little instruction is scribbled on the side, but usually, we're in the dark. If it weren't for some clues, we'd be going nowhere. How the else would we have known you had to send it a fax? //A fax?!//, what is this, 1870?

A full list of all these goddamn locking mechanisms are found here.

SCP-????-J's condition was brought to Site-44 director Yanni Belushi when O5-1 pointed it out during a leisurely stroll through the facility. The conversation is transcribed below:

**SCP-????-J Discovery Transcript Log:**

> **O5-1:** Oi, what the fuck is that thing?
> 
> **Belushi:** What, that? It's been around here for god knows how long. It's just a box, I think.
> 
> **O5-1:** There are no 'just boxes' in the Foundation. That thing probably has an Appolyon in it, lock that shit down.
> 
> **Belushi:** Yeah, you're probably right. Guard!
> 
> **Guard:** What's up, Belush?
> 
> **Belushi:** Don't call me that, that's not my name. Get this box out of here.
> 
> **Guard:** What, should I throw it in the trash?
> 
> **Belushi:** No, you fucktard, put it in a containment cell. Who knows what is inside the thing.
> 
> **Guard:** I dunno, Belush, thing feels empty.
> 
> **Belushi:** I said DON'T FUCKING CALL ME THAT. And stop rattling it around, you might piss off whatever is in there.
> 
> **Guard:** I'm telling you mate, this thing is totally empty.
> 
> **Belushi:** And I'm telling //you//, put that box in a bigger box or else I'll shove my foot so far up //your// box that you'll be having infant-sized Dockers in nine months.
> 
> **O5-1:** Jesus.
> 
> **Guard:** Alright! Calm your tits man.
> 
> //SCP-????-J was then transported to its current containment area. Guard was reprimanded and probably demoted, the cunt.//
