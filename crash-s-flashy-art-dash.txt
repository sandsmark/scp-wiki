+ Crash's flashy art-dash

**Hey guys! Welcome to my art hub!** Here is where I will post all my SCP related art.
I hope to use this to draw more often and improve more, so I hope this shines through.

I will try to do mostly newer SCP's/SCP's I have not seen a lot of fanart of, although I won't rule out the occasional "classic". Overall it is just based on my favourites though. :D

**By the way**: If you have any suggestions for underappreciated SCPs or are an author that would like to have some art I'd be very happy to take a look at them and see what I can do! :D



[[collapsible show="Taboo" hide=" Just repeat the last syllable of any name you use one additional time for everytime you use it! Tabooboo Taboobooboo Tabooboobooboo. "]]

To **start** things off, here is an SCP that I think about on an at least weekly basis: [[*user PeppersGhost]]'s [http://www.scp-wiki.net/taboo Woods Beyond Name].

[[Collapsible show="4104" hide=" What will be left after he did whatever it is he wants to do?"]]

Number **2** is [[*user KrySalems]]' [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4104 "He’s lying to you all."]. A cold and eerie story about nothing.

This is my first time really using a gif in an artistic way so I hope it came out well.

[[Collapsible show="4444" hide=" Tbh the only thing I knew about Gore before this was the Southpark depiction. "]]

And here goes number **3**! [[*user djkaktus]]' [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4444 Bush vs Gore]!

[[Collapsible show="3596" hide=" Go, Go SJCAS! doesn't roll off the tongue too well...]]

Nnnnnnnnnumber **4** is a cute story about superheroes and Saturday mornings: [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3596 SCP-3596] by [[*user IAmTheOoga]]!

[[collapsible show="4005" hide="It's an extra dimensional anglerfish ain't it?"]]

Nummer **Fünf** is [[*user Tufto]]'s [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4005 SCP-4005]. This one was especially interesting to me because it was described as an optimistic, "happy-end"-kinda story when to me it only grew more and more uncomfortable and scary.

[[collapsible show="4051" hide="Poor Rainer."]]


Número **seis** is special to me because my first idea for an SCP, before joining the site, was: "a guy that could produce anything out of the pockets of any coats he wore". And this is basically that concept but realized in proportions and with a complexity, I would have never been able to. It is [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4051 SCP-4051] by [[*user Nagiros]].
