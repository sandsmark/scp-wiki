**Special Containment Procedures:** 

SCP-4940's procedure corresponds to three different developmental stages that the object may be within.

* At //Stage One//, SCP-4940 is to be contained within a standard security locker, made primarily of steel. Said container is to be kept within a room capable of sustaining a constant temperature of 0°C or lower. 

* At //Stage Two//, SCP-4940 is to be held within a Foundation-made Organ Care System, capable of holding masses of 1.4kg, or higher.
 
* At //Stage Three//, SCP-4940 is to be contained within a Foundation-made Organ Care System, retrofitted to include approved modifications.

At //all// stages of SCP-4940's development, under no circumstances is introduction of non-living, solid, organic matter allowed without permission from a __Security Clearance Level 3__ researcher. SCP-4940 is to be housed within Research Site 87-Delta.

**Description:** 

SCP-4940's appearance depends on the stage of it's development.


* At //Stage One//, the object is a small, black, spherical object three centimeters in diameter. The object's outer composition is a hard, black substance, made of tightly packed neurons, which encompasses the sphere in a one centimeter thickness. The inner layer of the object is made of a material unable to be identified through Foundation research personnel, or matched with any anomalous material on-record. The inner material is incapable of being damaged, preventing any sample being taken, and emits constant oscillatory frequency of at 1.5 Hz. This coincides with a constant ψ-Wave rating of █. SCP-4940 is capable of locomotion, attaining a maximum speed of two meters-per-second, via rolling, although it is unknown how the object is able to move in any capacity. Upon the surface of SCP-4940 appears heavily faded text, only the subsequent examples being legible enough to be transcribed:

> SERIAL NO. 2286786 PROTOTYPE
> [REDACTED] LABORATORIES

* The object is regarded as being in //Stage Two// when an approximate 1kg of neural biomass has been attached to the outer surface of SCP-4940. When in this phase, the object has been observed emitting electrical pulses to the surrounding neurons, from specific areas on the outer surface. The non-anomalous neurons are physically attached to the outer surface of the object, and can only be removed with high-frequency laser-cutters, or in a bath of hydrochloric acid. The object is capable of manipulating any muscle tissue in contact with the neural biomass. The effective range of this manipulation, if physically connected to the tissue in some form, can range to one kilometer, although effective movement diminishes the farther from the object. The object is capable of exhibiting a considerable amount of intelligence, able to construct objects out of the biomass it has gained, typically in the effort to kill, or maim other organisms to amalgamate their biomass into its own. SCP-4940 exhibits an oscillatory frequency of 5 Hz, and a consistent ψ-Wave rating of ██.

* The object is regarded as being in //Stage Three// specifically when it exhibits full sapience similar to that of a human being. The intelligence of SCP-4940 can range from that of a human of five years, or of twenty-five, though the intelligence rapidly increases from the former when given enough time. SCP-4940 will have formed the neural biomass surrounding its core into that of a shape similar to a average human brain, developing from the brain-stem outwards, the last of the development forming the outer cerebral cortex. The object is capable of this development without any other type of biological material, but will typically have a large amount accompanying it due to the necessity in acquiring the required neural biomass. The object emits an oscillatory frequency of 30 Hz, and a ψ-Wave rating of ████.

**Discovery and Acquisition:** 

SCP-4940 entered Foundation possession after anonymous reports were received of a start-up anomalous technology manufacturing company known [REDACTED] Laboratories, a company founded by a Dr. [REDACTED], former head bio-technologies researcher for one of Prometheus Labs' bio-engineering facilities. The main laboratory of [REDACTED] was illegally constructed underground in ██████ State Park, ██████, ██. The company primarily deals with the engineering of anomalous objects though illegal and underground means. An investigation into black market transactions, the previously-unknown sources of SCP-████ and SCP-████, and missing-persons reports by MTF-Phi-1 ("Hostile Takeover") lead to a raid upon the facility, seizing it, and the remaining employees within. Of the reported anomalous items coming from the facility's inventory, a majority were missing, along with Dr. [REDACTED], leading to the formation of MTF-Delta-87 ("Hayflick Limit") to track down, and recover anomalous products produced by [REDACTED] Laboratories, as well as turning the laboratory into the now-established Research Site Delta-87

Heavily altered and censored digital documents concerning SCP-4940 were recovered from the lab's database, and were used to track down the object within the laboratory's perimeter. Using local animal population censuses, and higher-than-average carrion presence, the object was found within the corpse of an eastern ground squirrel, then subsequently retrieved and contained.


**Addendum 4940.1:** The following files were recovered from [REDACTED] Laboratories, and subsequently logged into the Foundation database.

[BEGIN LOG]
 
**[00:00]:** **VOICE 1:** This is Dr. ██████, of the oh-eight In-Facility Research team. The time is oh-six-thirty-eight. We are to examine the prototype's locomotion capabilities, and interaction with non-living biological material. (//Farther from the camera's microphone.//) Drop them in. 

**[00:10]:** //SCP-4940is placed into view of the camera, onto a white, flat surface. The camera looks down upon what is presumed to be a table.//

**[00:12]:** //The corpse of a euthanized Mus Muscullus (Lab Mouse) specimen is placed around half a meter away from SCP-4940.//

**[00:13-00:15]:** //SCP-4940begins to roll on its own, towards the mouse corpse. An unidentified gloved hand moves the corpse around a half a meter to the camera's left.//

**[00:16]** (Unintelligible speaking, assumed ██████'s voice, along with pen scribbling.)

**[00:20]:** //SCP-4940 ceases movement, before changing it's direction, and resuming locomotion towards the corpse.//

**[00:21-00:40]:** //The corpse is continually moved, just before the object can make contact. SCP-4940 turns immediately once the target has changed its position.//

**[00:42]:** //SCP-4940 makes physical contact with the corpse, and continues rolling.//

**[00:43-01:45]:** //SCP-4940 continuously rolls against the corpse of the mouse. Over time, the friction begins to tear and rip at the mouse’s fur, stripping away layers of epidermis and muscle. Blood from the corpse begins to leak onto the testing area.//

**[01:46-02:50]:** //SCP-4940 continues to remove layers of the mouse’s muscles, and burrows itself into the corpse, into the chest cavity. SCP-4940 ceases activity.//

**[03:00]:** **██████:** The prototype has stopped it's movement. █████████, cut the feed, and retrieve the corpse for me.

//The recording cuts off.//

----
**DATE:** 20██/██/██

**NOTE:** The following is a transcript of a [REDACTED] Laboratories on-site test recording, found among corrupted files within the headquarters computer database. SCP-4940 was introduced into the environment, and monitored. SCP-4940 had been left undisturbed for a six month period, and a team of researchers traveled to the area to perform more in-depth observational recording and analysis.

[BEGIN LOG]

**[00:01]:** (//Repeated crunching of leaves. Muffled sounds of metal impacting another surface.//)

**[00:10]:** //Camera pans upwards to reveal approximately nine personnel in [REDACTED] Laboratories CBRN suits, walking along a neglected trail covered in dead vegetation. With them are several containers, hand held devices, and portable station analysis equipment.//

**[EXTRANEOUS DATA REMOVED]**

**[16:56]:** //The camera is set on a metal table. 10 [REDACTED] Laboratories researchers in total are seen aiding in the final set-ups of the camp. Roughly 80m from the camp site, a large concrete structure (later identified as an abandoned weather research facility) is visible. A researcher approaches the camera.//

**[16:57]:** **█████:** This is Dr. █████, of the 05 Field Research Team. I'm told by Doctors ███, and ███████, that the prototype was placed within this specific structure.

**[17:05]:** //The researcher gestures to the construct.//

**[17:07]:** **█████:** The time is fourteen-oh-five, and we are currently setting up on-field tissue analysis stations, as well as bio-hazardous material storage containers.

**[EXTRANEOUS DATA REMOVED]**

**[38:40]:** //The view is of the inside of the previously seen concrete structure. The camera’s light reflects off of several growths.//

**[38:45]:** //Camera pans from left to right, then up and down. Walls, floor, and ceiling are covered in a bloody, sinew-like web, with several small bulbs. Camera zooms into one of these bulbs.//

**[EXTRANEOUS DATA REMOVED]**

**[56:21]:** //Camera cuts to another view inside of the structure. The webbing along the walls has increased in thickness, and the bulbs bigger. The bulbs have a vague cerebral texture. The camera follows ███ and another unidentified researcher down the structure’s hallway, each seen with portable bio-hazard collection and analysis equipment, as well as handheld light sources.//

**[56:25]:** **█████:** Why the hell is ███████ taking so long? He should’ve been at the check-in ten minutes ago.

**[56:27]:** **███:** He's probably still taking samples, and lost track of time. We did send him pretty far into here, might've just forgotten to check his watch.

**[56:28-56:40]:** //The three researchers silently walk through corridors, accompanied by sounds of their footsteps causing slight, muffled squelching sounds. The unidentified researcher rushes forward, screaming ███████’s name.//

**[56:42]:** **███:** █████████! What the hell are you screaming about? Don’t trample all over the samples! 

**[56:45]:** //█████ and ███ chase after █████████, turning a corner, and reveal him clutching his shin. Blood has stained the leg of his CBRN suit.//

**[56:50]:**  //The camera pans down, and zooms into a construct, made of several canine bones, held together by applied tendons and muscle tissues. Teeth and claws have been fused into the bones, standing around shin height.//

**[56:57]:** **█████████:** ███████! Something got ███████! The damn thing just flew out of the wall a-and it fucking busted a hole in the back of his skull! 

**[57:03]:** //The camera pans back up, zooming into ███████’s corpse. The body is covered in various fleshy growths, rapidly wrapping around its limbs, and entering a wound in the back of the head.//

**[57:07]:** //The camera rapidly pans over to the left, a blunt, bone-construct being retreated into the flesh-layer on the wall.//

**[57:11]:** //███ reaches at a holster strapped to his thigh, and retrieves a 9mm pistol (identified to be a 916 Hi-Point brand)//

**[57:14]:** **███:** █████, turn that camera off, and help █████████ get back to the field lab. Get everyone else down here, now!

//The recording cuts off.//

= **RECOVERED MEDICAL DOCUMENT TRANSCRIPT**

------
**NOTE:** The following is a transcript of a heavily censored medical document found within the same folders that contain other files relating to SCP-4940. Though exact relation is currently unknown, it is suspected the individual this document relates to was possibly a previously-unknown employee working on the product, or had other relations to said production of the object. Medical records found from other employees reveal that all examinations were conducted by in-house physicians. Other examinations conducted within the same month follow a similar pattern to the following document. 

------

**Name:** █████ ██████

**Age:** ██

**Occupation:** ██████ ███████████

**Date:** ████/██/██

**Patient Issue:** Patient describes severe depressive episodes, anxiety, paranoia, and hypochondria. Patient takes no medications, nor receives therapy for any mental conditions.

**Physician Recommendation and Reception:** Patient is told that he is to undergo several tests, including standard narcotics testing, medication-reaction testing, five separate blood extractions, cranial X-Ray examination, fMRI and EEG analysis, and tissue collection and analysis, under the guise of these being tests for any mental conditions, hereditary causes for said conditions, and brain analysis to observe any neurochemical symptoms. Patient experienced sudden anxiety and paranoia, but eagerly agreed to the testing in order to "fix what was wrong with him."

**Procedure:** Tests described above were conducted, with the medications given being entirely placebo, along with muscle relaxants.

**Findings and Reception:** Patient exhibits no physical abnormality or illness, and does exhibit every mental condition described by the patient. He shows higher-than-average reception to the placebos than average. Patient was told confirmation of his mental conditions, as well as given a diagnosis of "Neuromaterial Degenerative Disorder", told that his nervous system is quickly degrading, and would result in his death within two years, onset by his depression and anxiety destroying his neurons. The patient received the diagnosis with no suspicion, and agreed to any treatment recommended.

The corpse of the wolf began to disassemble, muscle being separated from bone, and the skull of the wolf splitting open, and a grey-matter-covered SCP-4940 emerging. SCP-4940 then remained motionless, manipulating the biomass to cover a surface area of one meter in radius, forming the bones and muscle into standing objects, teeth and claws fastened to it. The throat of the wolf was left undamaged, and began to emit vocalizations similar to a canine in distress.

**RHESUS MACAQUE (//Macaca mulatta//):** Corpse of macaque introduced into chamber. Object burrowed into carrion, then ceased activity for approximately one hour, until beginning again. The skin of the macaque sloughed and detached off of the musculature, the fur being left upon the floor. The musculature and skeletal structure of the macaque began to disassemble, limbs and cranial features becoming less distinct until the former corpse of the macaque had become a uniform pile of flesh. A single arm of the macaque was left unaffected, pulling the leftover skin over the pile of muscle and organs, and began to emit distress calls common of Rhesus Macaques.

= **FOUNDATION TEST 4940-083**
----
**DATE:** 20██/██/█

**OBJECT:** SCP-4940

**SUBJECT:** D-77564-87

**PROCEDURE:** Object is to be held within standard humanoid-containment chamber. D-Class corpse, referred to as "subject",  is to be introduced into the chamber, and left on the floor. All activity is to then be observed and recorded. Object is to be retrieved via autopsy if necessary.

**OBSERVATIONS:**

The subject's corpse is introduced into the chamber, and placed upon its back, one meter away from SCP-4940. Object began locomotion in the direction of the corpse, until physical contact was established. Once in physical contact, the object began to roll against the skin of Subject's scalp, for approximately two minutes and fifteen seconds. Object eventually begins to burrow through epidermis of Subject's scalp, and subsequent layers, until reaching bone. Object then continues rolling, and burrowing through the cranium for five minutes and thirty-five seconds. Object successfully burrowed into Subject's cranium, then inserted itself into the brain matter of Subject. 

After two minutes and twenty-seven seconds, the corpse of Subject began to seize up, spasming occurring in the arms and legs, along with facial twitching and rapid movement of the eyeballs. Spasming continued for four minutes and eleven seconds, until the corpse ceased movement. The corpse of Subject once again began movement, ambulating the arms and legs through rapid striking against the floor of the chamber. The strikes and ambulations occurred at random, with no discernible pattern, accompanied by random tensing and relaxing in the facial muscles. The ambulatory movement continued at its current pattern for another five minutes, forty-five seconds, until the Subject began to emit scratched and raspy vocalizations. 

No vocalizations were coherent, and consisted with sustained screaming in the voice of Subject, lasting for twenty seconds at a time, and short yelps, accompanied by the corpse scratching against the chamber floor, or its own face. The movement of the facial muscles were not consistent with any sustained emotion, suspected as distress, and were rapidly spasming, along with rapid blinking, and opening/closing of the jaw. Subject’s tongue sustained damage due to the closing on the jaw upon it, causing minor bleeding, indicated by blood leaking from the corpse’s mouth. This behavior lasted for ten minutes and thirty-two seconds, with the corpse’s movements becoming less erratic over time, before attempting to stand. 

Subject was unsuccessful in this attempt, resting upon its hands and knees, staring at the floor. Subject began to spew blood from the mouth, initially suspected to be from the wounds sustained on the tongue, but the profuse amount pointed to possible internal bleeding. After four minutes and fifty-two seconds, the subject began to vocalize once again, interrupted occasionally by spitting, or coughing out blood. Vocalizations were a majority incoherent, too quiet or drawn out to be understandable, with occasional audible expletives, albeit mispronounced, being emitted, including striking on the chamber floor with its fists. 

The examining research team called in for on-site guard personnel to stand by at the entrance of the chamber, as well as on-site medics. As striking continued for five minutes and twelve seconds, the subject's fists began to bruise and become bloody at a rapid rate, as well as causing further and more significant damage to the floor with each successive hit. Subject once again attempted to stand, standing upon both the hands and feet, before slipping on the blood previously excreted from the mouth, falling on its face, with an audible crunch. Subject raised itself after ten seconds, accompanied by vocalizations similar to aggressive human speech, though with no coherency. Subject immediately attempted to stand once again, this time successful, albeit unsteady, bracing itself against the wall. 

After fifteen seconds, in which the subject scanned the testing chamber, it began to breath rapidly, pupils dilating, and muscles twitching, in line with what is assumed to be an anxiety attack. The subject began to rapidly scratch, grasp, or examine any exposed skin on the subject, increasing distress accompanied by screaming, and partially coherent and louder vocalizations, including English words such as, "hurt", repeated vocalizations of "why" and "how". Subject excreted tears within thirty seconds of panicked state, rapidly poking and tugging at the exposed wound at the top of its skull. Subject's vocalizations became more coherent as it began to form sentences, screaming out accusatory statements towards no specific target, examples being, "Fuck, did this...", "[REDACTED], why?", "Kill, [REDACTED], fucker." Subject began to scream once again, vocalizations of accusatory statements continuing, before running towards the chamber door, stumbling, and striking it. 

The subject seemingly began to cry as it continued to strike the chamber door, emitting expletives and additional accusations. Each successive strike damaged the door further, denting and warping the metal. Guards beyond the door were instructed and terminate subject and specifically instructed to not damage the cranial area to avoid damage to SCP-4940. Subject was terminated after a volley of fire from from Security Staff. After ██ rounds, the subject ceased hostile behavior and vocalization. The subject's body continued to spasm after a recovery team was called in to bring the corpse to the autopsy center.

**NOTES:** An autopsy was shortly conducted after the retrieval of D-77564-87’s corpse, along with the removal of SCP-4940 from the body. Examination revealed that the Subject’s brain had recovered from cerebral hypoxia, and had shown signs of cessation of biological function at the time of termination, rather than when it was originally euthanized. The skin of the arms of the subject had partially calcified, specifically the fingers and back of the hand. Examination of arm and back muscles revealed that several of them, as well as the tendons and ligaments, had been torn and snapped, presumably due to the strenuous activity of the subject, further suggested due to the muscles on the shoulder and fore arm having shown signs of being torn off of the bone. The body continued with powerful spasms for about twenty minutes after removal of SCP-4940. The names mentioned by the subject corresponded to listed employees of [REDACTED] Laboratories, of which specifically worked on the project producing SCP-4940.

    ]]

**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP-4940-1 is to be held within a standard humanoid containment chamber, devoid of any loose items, non-fixed-position furniture, and outwards light fixtures. The object's meals cannot require utensils to consume, and must be monitored when eating. Once a day, SCP-4940 must be required to intake 60mg of Paroxetine orally, and 1300mg of Foundation-made ψ-Wave suppressants, by force if necessary. The object's containment cell is located in the preexisting underground laboratories of Research Site Delta-87.

**Description:**

SCP-4940-1 is a non-physical, sapient entity which inhabits SCP-4940. The object is a consciousness of that of a presumed mid-twenties male, developing fully in SCP-4940 within ten minutes. SCP-4940-1 can only manifest when SCP-4940 has gathered approximately one kilogram of neural biomass, and had within 12 hours of development time for SCP-4940 to develop the material, or SCP-4940 is implanted directly into an already-developed human brain. SCP-4940-1 shows signs of incredible distress when manifesting, initial panic attacks and bouts of aggression are common, especially towards individuals taking the appearance of lab research staff. When given time to adjust, SCP-4940-1 exhibits much calmer behavior, showing symptoms common of severe dysthymia, anxiety, and paranoia. The object shows signs of suicidal ideation, and continuously finds ways to cease its life, having done so ██ times. Due to SCP-4940's indestructible nature, SCP-4940-1 is incapable of dying, and continues to make attempts on its life, despite this knowledge.

SCP-4940-1 currently inhabits donated surrogate bodies of D-Class subjects which have been recently euthanized, and as such, its appearance may be subject to change.

----
**DATE:** 20██/██/██

**NOTE:** Three times a week, SCP-4940-1 undergoes psychological therapy with an in-house Foundation psychologist. Through these sessions, information is collected on SCP-4940-1 and his mental state. The following document is a transcript of an interrogation under the guise of a standard therapy session, Senior Researcher ██████ replacing the object's standard psychologist, Dr. ██████. SCP-4940-1 had been supplied muscle relaxants, and medications which increased the object's suggestibility, as well as given a bottle of water laced with the same latter drugs.

**INTERVIEWER:** Senior Researcher ██████

**SUBJECT:** SCP-4940-1

------

**[BEGIN LOG]**

**INTERVIEWER:** As a formality, we need you to state your full name, and age.

**SUBJECT:** █████ ██████, 25. 

**INTERVIEWER:** Thank you, 4940, now before we beg-

**SUBJECT:** At least call me by my name. Let me feel, at least slightly human?

//Senior Researcher ██████ nods.//

**INTERVIEWER:** Right, █████. How do you feel, in your current body? This is number...

**SUBJECT:** ██. I feel about as normal as someone can feel when they aren't in their own body.

**[EXTRANEOUS DATA REMOVED]**

**INTERVIEWER:** In order for the Foundation to better help you with your condition, we need to ask more personal questions about your history. Take a drink, if needed.

//SCP-4940-1 grabs the water bottle sitting on the nearby table, taking a drink, then setting it down.//

**INTERVIEWER:** Do you remember anything about your time at [REDACTED] Laboratories? Your job, your boss, what possibly could have happened to result in the state you are in?

**SUBJECT:** I...I was an assistant, to one of the higher-ups. One of my friends had connections due to his degree, and I didn't have any sort of formal education worth doing any sort of investigative work. I guess they needed an intern, some sort of coffee-runner. 

**SUBJECT:** My memory is hazy, I don't exactly remember much...can barely remember what my face looked like. I never met the boss, Dr. [REDACTED] I think, he never dealt with anyone lower than the project heads. But he sent me these, well, messages, when I started asking about my health insurance.

**INTERVIEWER:** Did [REDACTED] provide health insurance?

**SUBJECT:** No, but they still paid well, and I guess Dr. [REDACTED] didn't want any more of a problem besides all of the shit you told me they did. I never spoke up until then, I was afraid of getting fired, but he let me see one of the higher-up employees who was the sort of in-house physician.
