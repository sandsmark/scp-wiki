we took the damned thing
and wiped the blood and shit and piss and tears from its face
nothing was beneath

light shone through the cracks
reality itself bent to the wills of madmen
now remains only words

sliced through severed stones
redundancies enough to keep back a hidden king
trees in the forest

deep uncertainty
undirected hatred fear and loathing shapes it all
and remains unshaped

fresh porphyria
dry and wet and old and new and everything between
solemnly inept

a few swift stabbings
ten thousand steel doors broken down to scraps of concepts
moderately gnawed

knowledge lies in parts
puzzles upon ciphers upon riddles open doors
revolving in place

eternity now
all clocks and time compressed to an instant variance
cannot change again

PENDING XK CLASS END OF THE WORLD SCENARIO
THANK YOU AND FAREWELL**
