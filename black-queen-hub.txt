[[tab A Letter, Dated September 20th, 2011]]
To Alison Chao (Theta),
Known to her world as The Black Queen,

I hope this letter finds you well. I want to apologize for our behavior the other day. Although you're a strong person, discovering your true nature, as well as that of the Serpent's Hand, can be disorienting. It's been so long since I was first introduced to the other Little Sisters that I've forgotten what it's like. Feeling helpless is never a pleasant sensation, particularly when you're used to the feeling of being five steps ahead of everyone else in your world. Lashing out in the way that you did was understandable, if unfortunate. I hope that you will find it in yourself to rejoin us in the Library at some point in the future.

Hopefully this letter will help with some of the questions that were supposed to be answered at the Library. First, there is always a Gears. He always leaves his wife for some extranormal organization. He always loses his capacity to feel. Sometimes this can be fixed, sometimes it can't. Sometimes Gears will get caught up in something that ultimately destroys his universe.

Second, this Gears will frequently have a daughter. She is always shaped by his leaving. After a certain number of years, she begins to seek out her father. Sometimes she becomes a monster, human only in the loosest sense. Other times, she retains something of a conscience. Sometimes she succeeds and rescues her father, only to find him a broken shell. Other times, she saves him and rebuilds her family as it once was. Many times she remains an utterly unremarkable, if damaged woman. Other times she dies before she can even lay down her plans. And sometimes, a very few times, she learns about the Library.

Knowing that your circumstances are not unique, that your suffering is just one iteration of an infinite amount of identical suffering, or that the control you thought you had is non-existent, isn't pleasant to hear. Don't despair. Your influence over the worlds (not world. Worlds.) is far greater than you can ever know. Some of the daughters have limited themselves to their own worlds, using the Library as a safehouse and resource. Others have walked the ways, seeking out ancient and obscure worlds. Some ignore Gears, some obsessively seek him out. A few have decided that all of this convergence is the work of a god or gods. Sometimes people come into conflict. 

To call it a group is probably too charitable. More like a collection of individuals with similar experiences.

Whatever ultimately becomes of your plans, I hope you will try and find us again. You're scared and confused, and probably angry. At one point, I was too. But we know you better than anyone else ever can. If you choose to stay, there is no limit to what we can do.

Your Little Sister,
Alison Chao (Epsilon)
Known also to her world as the Black Queen

[[tab Overview]]

+ Who is the Black Queen?

Gears' daughter. Years ago, when she was still very young, her father abandoned her and her mother. No note, no packed suitcase, no nothing. Just there one minute, gone the next. Her mother promptly fell apart, leaving Alison to largely fend for herself. Over the years, she became fixated on the idea of finding her father. Through whatever means necessary, she will find her father, and bring to account those who stole her family from her.
> Note: The following is, by its very nature, spoileriffic. It is highly suggested that you read [[[Going Out Of Book]]], [[[Between Shelves]]], and [[[Queen's Gambit]]]. If you've done so, or don't particularly like surprises, then click onward...
[[collapsible show="Spoilers" hide="The more you know..."]]
This is simply the general framework for the Black Queens. There are hundreds of Black Queens scattered across thousands of universes. Most never become aware of the existence of other Queens and simply do their own thing in their universe. Or die or remain normal or whatever. However, a precious few discover this.


+ What does the Black Queen want?

To destroy the Foundation. To rebuild her family. To punish those responsible for all of the suffering caused to her and her mother. At least, that's usually what she wants initially. Sometimes she just wants to wander the Ways. Others, she seeks to rule the world with an iron fist. Black Queens rarely interfere with one another unless their goals are in direct opposition.

+ Where is the Black Queen?

The nexus of all of the universes, the Library contains all information ever recorded. It is the meeting place of the [[[serpent-s-hand-hub|Serpent's Hand]]]. It is also the central gathering point for the Black Queens; while in the Library, the Queens refer to one another and themselves as "Little Sisters," or L.S. Not coincidentally, the past few years have seen the rise of a shadowy figure known only as L.S. among the Serpent's Hand. It's amazing what one can do [[[scp-268|when no one knows who you are]]]. The Black Queens use the Serpent's Hand primarily as a listening post, but may also try to spur the group to direct action in service of their goals.


+ Who is Doctor Gears?

Doctor Gears is, depending on the universe, a robot, an emotionally dead man, an anomalous artifact, or something else entirely. Whatever he is, Gears always plays a pivotal role in the world of the anomalous in whatever universe he's in. Black Queens will frequently go out of their way to preserve the life of a Gears, although some may seek to destroy dangerous iterations of him.

+ Where are the Black Queen's secrets?

In the multiversal catalogs. Whenever a particular instance of an object is encountered on a different world, it is noted. Often, iterations of the Black Queen with a great deal of knowledge on or interest in the object will annotate the catalog to provide greater insight through updates, questions, comments, as well as logs of heists and visual information.
