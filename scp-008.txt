**Security Clearance Adequate: Access Authorized**

**Item #:** SCP-008

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-008 samples are an extreme biological hazard and all related protocols apply. Incineration and irradiation measures will be deployed in the event of political or military action which may result in the facility being dismantled, a power failure or zero communications from operatives or outside channels during any given eight hour period. The quarantine period for operatives leaving the facility is four months. If a breach has occurred, incineration and irradiation measures shall be deployed. It should be the policy of all facilities not to prepare an evacuation procedure.

**Description:** SCP-008 is a complex prion found stored in each of the known G2 sites. Research into SCP-008 is highly classified and primarily aimed at preventing research which may lead to the synthesis of SCP-008 in the distant future. Symptomatic functions of the SCP-008 prion will be given.

* 100% lethality.
* Transmission through exposed mucus membranes and all bodily fluids.
* Not airborne. Not waterborne.
* 100% infectivity.
* Theoretically symptoms will first appear at a maximum of 3 hours after infection.
* Symptoms are flu-like with high fever and severe dementia in later stages.
* Coma onset approximately 20 hours after first symptoms appear and 12 hours after noticeable dementia. Coma onset will be considered onset of death.
* A period of sporadic cellular necrosis occurs which will eventually resemble gangrene, surviving tissue assumes it's original function and is highly resilient.
* Red blood cells infected by SCP-008 increase oxygen storage capacity resulting in slower blood flow and increased muscle endurance and strength.
* Nervous and muscular systems are unaffected by total organ failure for several hours.
* Metabolism may decrease to extremely low levels allowing subject to survive for over 10 years without nutrition.
* High blood viscosity results in negligible blood flow from gunshot, puncture and slash related injuries.
* Conditioned behavior, motor controls and instinctive behavioral mechanisms are damaged, cognitive abilities are severely retarded and erratic. Animals experience excessive brain necrosis and are inactive.
* Subjects can adapt to their damaged nervous systems but are limited to basic physical activities including standing up, balancing on 2 legs, walking, biting, grabbing and crawling. Subject will energetically move towards sights, sounds and smells it associates with living humans. Subject will attempt to ingest living humans if physical contact is made.
* Neutralizing subjects requires significant cranial trauma.

There is strong evidence to suggest SCP-008 itself did not form naturally on earth, since variants of similar complexity would have displaced much of the ecosystem. In 1959 a short collaborative effort with the USSR to locate G2 sites and eliminate SCP-008 was negotiated following their discovery. The status of SCP-008 in Russian custody since collaboration ended is unknown.

**Addendum 008-1**: [[[SCP-500]]] has been found to be able to completely cure SCP-008 even in the advanced stages of the disease.
