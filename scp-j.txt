SCP-@@____@@-J is an extremely complex SCP to understand- as such, nearly 4 people collaborated together to create this explanation. Now, let us begin with the explanation. Do be warned though, SCP-@@____@@-J is //highly// complex, so if our explanation does not solve your question, please leave it in the comments below. Please note that this article is not satirical or sarcastic in any way, and we, as members of the SCPD moderation staff, will //never// let you guys down.

Fundamentally, SCP-@@____@@-J is a artistic/post-modernist/neo-deconstructivist literary piece designed to create a meta-meta-commentary on the nature of the community’s attitude towards so-called “format screws.” It has often been noted that the trend of SCPs throughout site history has been to become more innovative, to create more and more confusing symbolism that has to be read //through// the lines. The response of SCP@@-___-@@J is to point out the logical conclusion of the trend to imply rather than to show; to create a piece where every single piece of information is not said, and the SCP itself is purely a framing device for the reader to create their own conclusions.

> **Item #:** SCP-@@____@@-J

We shall commence with the item’s name itself: SCP@@-___-@@J. The J at the end signifies that this SCP falls under the “J” category of organization. Normally, this represents the fact that the opus to which the designation refers begins with the letter J, which is the tenth letter of the standard English alphabet. However, when pertaining to the SCP Foundation and containment of anomalous artifacts and entities, it refers to a standard of categorization dubbed “Joke”. Now, do not be offput by the name - Joke SCPs can still be just as complex as regular SCP articles (See [[[SCP-META-EX-J]]] for another perfect example of such), and, in fact, can take even more skill to write than a successful mainstream article.

The “Joke” classification itself can be thought of as a combining diacritic - to append the “joke” tag onto a draft deeply changes any inter-universal lore and implications with regards to the wider writing community as a whole. In this instance, the aforementioned tag pertaining to @@___@@’s designation creates a rift in the in-universe and out-of-universe perception of canon. Remember the line “//There is no canon//”? All the authors and staff say it like a mantra, and to this effect the item shown breaks the nature of canon by making you question whether the item being contained is real or purely part of the author’s perception. There is no canon, indeed.

It is now time to move on, to the actual name of the SCP. “@@___@@” This is offputting, to say the least. Why would the Item Number be blanked- maybe it’s being censored? Now, this will be discussed further in the explanation, but first we need to delve into //why// specifically the item number is **three** blanks instead of **four**. You see, SCP-@@____@@-J was uploaded in 2012, during the time in which Series II was in full swing. This means that SCP-@@____@@-J was not attempting to match the current trend of Series II- instead, providing a more powerful message into going against trends.

However, the concept of going against trends is a form of memetic-resistance. In fact, it is possible that SCP-@@____@@-J may have connections to [[[SCP-3125]]]- or more importantly, may host the key concept in which SCP-3125 will be destroyed, mentioned in [[[Your Last First Day]]]. This concept will be expanded on further into the article, as we explain more. Suffice it to say that the fact that SCP@@-___-@@J’s name is three blanks instead of four is, essentially, what allows us to ‘solve’ all the mystery surrounding this entity.

> **Object Class:** @@_______@@

The moment we click on this article, we instantly notice something is wrong- the object classification is missing. Similar to the item number, the number of blanks is extremely important to the overall meaning. If you count the number of blank spaces, you’ll discover that there are seven blank spots. Now, count the number of any object classes you can find. Did you discover one that has seven? No, because there **are no object classes with seven characters in them**. Like the item number, SCP-@@____@@-J’s object class plays a significant role in emphasizing the key message of SCP-@@____@@-J itself.


> **Special Containment Procedures:** In a box in my office.

This article is short, and to the point, especially seen here. The Special Containment Procedures are not detailed excessively: almost as if the article is a joke. But there is a mystery here: who is this “my”? What is this office, and what is so special about it? The box in here is clearly a metaphor for the writer’s struggle, judging by its context: inside his office, in a //box//. What else is in a box? The quantum mechanics state that anything with a non-zero probability will happen. Think Schrodinger's cat. Therefore, it is the metaphor for the existential existence of the concept of writing itself, and the uncertain nature of drafting an article for the wiki. //Meta//, isn’t it?

However, this could be in of itself, repressed criticism over the fanatic ideology that the Foundation displays. It’s true that, especially in the meta sense, the Foundation’s motto “Secure, Contain, Protect”, is simplified to “put it in a box”, to the point that object classes are characterized by the “box test” (yet again drawing emphasis to the point made in the Object Classes section of this very declassified). By drawing attention to this fact by cleverly isolating a slight modification of the phrase “in a box in my office”, the author is most likely providing satirical commentary on this element. However, readers may notice that it’s not just in a box, but also in his office. This plays into this analysis of the Foundation’s core elements, as the SCP Foundation is an organization, a bureaucracy. For what is a better representation of the kafkaesque nature of this company than the office, the workplace where souls are ground down for profit and financial benefit of the heads.

Additionally, the idea that this article is written in the first person is a notion shared by one other article on the entire website: [[[SCP-426]]]. A fundamental connection between be drawn between the two: SCP-426 is of itself described as “an eldritch abomination” in [[[Hello, I Am an Eldritch Horror]]], similar to the nature of SCP-3125. This, of course, means that SCP@@-___-@@J and SCP-3125 share a closer connection than expected- so much so as being //entirely related to one another//.

> **Description:** It's a rock that makes you procrastinate.

This will be further discussed later on, under the final note.

> **Addendum:** Probably memetic or something.

Notice the use of "probably" in this sentence- the Foundation is unsure of its major effects. This proves the object, in question, to be much more dangerous than originally discovered. In fact, this short statement holds terrible implications. “Probably memetic” seems to revolve around the idea that a memetic effect corresponding to the item in question. The sentence also states that its effect could entail “something” else. This is clearly an implication of something greater.

Another point to add is addressing an earlier statement, SCP-3125. This “memetic effect” of SCP-@@____@@-J shows that SCP-@@____@@-J actually //comes from// SCP-3125. Yes, SCP-@@____@@-J’s origin is is the meme-god himself. However, as we revealed earlier, SCP-@@____@@-J is actually fighting //against// SCP-3125. This not only proves SCP-@@____@@-J is sentient, but also shows it has an agenda- its motive is to save the world.

But let us on from these trivialities. None of these above points can hold a candle in significance against the true nature of SCP-@@____@@-J’s name. If you recall, near the beginning of the article, we identified that its name consisted of three blanks instead of four. Having now revealed @@____@@-J’s agenda (to combat SCP-3125 and other memetic infohazards), it makes sense to progress onto any memetic effects of the name. It is a well-documented phenomenon that the human eye is able to instinctively tell the difference between three and four objects - in fact, instinctive counting is thought to have been an evolutionary advantage from the days when humans were preyed upon by beasts. Therefore, SCP-@@____@@-J’s name is a key byproduct of our evolution- or rather, SCP-@@____@@-J //caused// our evolution. It is no coincidence that humans suddenly evolved to spread memes better than spreading genes- SCP-@@____@@-J needed allies in its fight against SCP-3125, something which could create //powerful memetic devices// to combat its effective spread. We are the backup in a war against a meme god.

--Note the use of italics. This signifies that an existential threat based on SCP-@@____@@-J is occurring, able to cause a PK-Class Lack-of-Productivity scenario in those around it: the only work done here is formatting, which is not very productive, further strengthening SCP-@@____@@-J’s agenda (see above).--

Or, is it?

You see, SCP-@@____@@-J’s agenda has already been described- fighting against SCP-3125, it’s “father”, to prevent an MK-Class Scenario. But that begs the question- why does it make people procrastinate? Isn’t that the //opposite// of what it’s trying to achieve? And that, my friends, is where the plot twist lies: **SCP-3125 is //killing// SCP-@@____@@-J.** SCP-@@____@@-J has been corrupted by SCP-3125, leaving it’s mission in our hands. We are the universe’s last hope, as the evolutionary cornerstone and son of a meme god leaves its duty to us.

----

In conclusion: SCP-@@____@@-J is a masterpiece; a sublime blend of in-universe references, it not only unifies the quantum mechanics and the Theory of Relativity, providing us with valuable insight into memetics and SCPs, but it also provides us an answer to the ever longing question, the burning in our hearts, the every yearning, ever growing fundamental idea, **//what is the meaning of life?**// And the answer? According to what we’ve seen today, in this article, which all of you have witnessed, the answer to this ever longing, burning question is quite clearly
