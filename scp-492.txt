**Item #:** SCP-####

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**
    Scp-####-01 is to be --surrounded by an opaque substance-- returned to its solid covering after testing and contained in an internally locked container in storage site-37. The combination to scp-####'s container is accessible only to personnel level-3 or higher.
    If any personnel show signs of stage 2 scp-####-02, they are to be apprehended and given Written Test-13-145. if the subject in question fails Written Test-13-145, they are to be designated scp-####-02-X and moved to the containment area for scp-####-02-X. Scp-####-02-X are to be held in individual, padded cells designed to negate the possibility of scp-####-02-X harming themselves. Termination of Scp-####-02-X specimens must be authorised by no more than four (4) senior research personnel assigned to scp-####, due to the continuous investigation of scp-####-02's duration.
    Scp-####-02-1 is not to be terminated without approval from one third (1/3) of O5 council. If Scp-####-02-1 breaches containment non-lethal methods of re-containment are to be implemented. Scp-####-02-1 is in possession of highly classified information and must be accounted for at all times. 

**Description:**
    Scp-####-01 is a metallic sphere with a radius of two and a half (2.5) centimetres. Material identification testing of scp-####-01 suggests that it is wholly comprised of titanium. Scp-####-01 shows the basic physical properties of an ordinary titanium sphere but, if scp-####-01 is damaged or destroyed it will repair itself over a period of time relative to the damage sustained (see testing log-####-B).
    Scp-####-02 is a psychological effect that has only been confirmed in humans. Scp-####-02 only manifests when scp-####-01 is observed being manipulated by human hands. If scp-####-01 is manipulated by someone wearing gloves with a thickness of 84 millimetres or more scp-####-02 does not occur.
    Stage 1 of scp-####-02 causes the victim (hereby referred to as the subject) to perceive various geometric changes in scp-####-01. These changes include vertices and edges that would ordinarily be attached to various forms of prism. These features are only hallucinations and physical objects will pass through them without resistance. These hallucinations are specific to individual subjects and no clear patterns have been observed.
    If the subject observes scp-####-01 for a period if time exceeding 90 seconds they will reach stage 2 of scp-####-02. It is believed that stage 2 is permanent but testing is ongoing. If the subject ceases observation of scp-####-01 before reaching stage 2 there are no ill effects (see Testing Log-####-A: Test A-5). Upon reaching stage 2 the  aforementioned hallucinations will be present on all geometric surfaces, even those represented in drawings or images. Subjects who become afflicted with stage 2 scp-####-02 are to be designated scp-####-02-X and moved to the scp-####-02-X containment area. 
    The scp-####-02-X containment area is a series of padded cells designed to stop scp-####-02-X from harming themselves in their delirium. 
    Stage 2 scp-####-02 is very easy to recognise, scp-####-02-X are often unable to move efficiently due to the perceived fluctuations in the surrounding environment. Scp-####-02-X are also generally incapable of solving basic geometric calculations. Written test-13-145 has been compiled as a test unsolvable to scp-####-02-X and is to be used to confirm or dissuade suspicion of scp-####-02 infection. 
    Scp-####-02-1 is a Caucasian male with brown hair and brown eyes standing at approximately 168 centimetres. Scp-####-02-1 is an exception to most characteristics of scp-####-02-X, displaying the ability to easily move throughout difficult obstacle courses, interpret geometric shapes (with difficulty, especially regarding diagrams of three dimensional shapes), and access information hidden by physical means by utilising scp-####-02. Some researchers are sceptical of scp-####-02-1, regarding scp-####-02 infection, for these reasons. 

**Recovery Log:**
    Scp-#### came to the knowledge of the foundation when a man masquerading as blind (scp-####-02-1) entered the foundation front company "Sam and Carl's Printing" and asked to speak to the manager. He then directly confronted  the manager (Field Agent ██ ███ "Cedar") about the foundation and showed Agent Cedar scp-####-01. Scp-#### was apprehended and scp-####-02-1 was interrogated (see interview log-####-A)

**Additional Notes:**
Cross testing with scp objects that disregard Euclidean Geometry is pending approval.

**Addendum-####-A:**
    Due to the marketing focus of Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd., specific documentation of scp-#### hasn't been recovered.  Several tests were devised to become as knowledgeable as possible regarding scp-####'s effects. This testing is documented in Testing Log-####-A.

> **Testing Log-####-A:**
>
> **Test A-1:**
> **Subjects:** D-9132 Vision: 20/20, D-36506 Vision: 20/20, D-5728 Vision: 20/20
> **Details:** D-9132 will be recorded picking up scp-####-01 with their bare hands and footage of scp-#### will be observed by D-36506 and D-5728
> **Results:** D-9132 picked up scp-####-01 with thumb and forefinger, subject immediately displayed, and verbally expressed, confusion. When asked to confirm anomaly subject answered affirmatively but not immediately, instead focusing on scp-####-01. After 30 seconds subject was told to place scp-####-01 back on the table, subject didn't comply. Command was repeated more forcefully, subject faintly vocalised in surprise and complied. In a separate testing chamber D-36506 and D-5728 were shown the footage, both subjects acted in confusion when scp-####-01 was interacted with but were able to rudimentarily describe what they were witnessing, each describing separate anomalies 
> **Note:** the footage was weakly encrypted before storage to lower the possibility of stage scp-####-02.
>
> **Test A-2:**
> **Subject:** D-47717 Vision: 20/20
> **Details:** this test will attempt to measure duration of scp-####-02 after interaction with scp-####-01 ceases. Example: subject will touch scp-####-01 for exactly one (1) second and measure the time before scp-####-02 stops manifesting.
> **Results:** The subject reported no anomalies while scp-####-01 was at rest. Subject touched scp-####-01 for approx. 1.0474 seconds and reported that scp-####-02 had ceased after approx. another 1.5128 seconds. Testing was continued with approx. 2, 5, and 10 seconds and repeated with multiple subjects. An equation has been formulated: √[√(5)•√(# of seconds observed)]=# of seconds scp-####-02 lingers.
> **Note:** further testing has supported this equation.

> **Subject:** 

> **Interview Log-####-A:**
> **Interviewer:** Agent ███ ████
> **Interviewee:** [Data Expunged] Scp-####-02-1
> **Interview conducted:** 12/██/19██
> **<Interview Begins>**
> **Agent:** Alright Scp-####-02-1 you claim to know about scp-████.
> **//Several lines of dialogue expunged//**
> **Agent:** -you were believed dead so amnestics weren't administered.
> **Scp-####-02-1:** Apparently.
> **Agent:** Continue.
> **Scp-####-02-1:** I [Data Expunged] after everyone had left and eventually found my way back home, [Data Expunged] of course. I spent the next few, days, weeks, I don't know, the next extended period of time, recuperating. Don't even know if I left my bed. But eventually I could think clearly and felt extremely hungry. So, I left the house to go buy something to eat, and I was stopped by a man who rushed out of his house as soon as I was outside of my yard. The guy was asking questions left and right but I was too hungry to deal with any crazies-
> **Agent:** -this doesn't seem to be important, please, stay on topic.
> **Scp-####-02-1:** Sorry, after I came back home he was there again, this time I was just annoyed but, when he mentioned SCP it definitely caught my attention.
> **Agent:** This man knew about the foundation? Do you know how?
> **Scp-####-02-1:** Yes but he died so he's not a threat.
> **Agent:** You're sure about that?
> **Scp-####-02-1:** Completely. He was an agent for Marshall, Carter and Dark Ltd. he told me I could get revenge on the foundation. But from my experience with scp-████ I had no reason to hate the foundation. You seemed like the good guys. *Chuckles* But I was curious, so I played along.
> **Agent:** You worked with Marshall, Carter and Dark?
> **Scp-####-02-1:** Not really, they thought I did, but I didn't actually //do// anything, just read their files and learned about them, and SCP. They did give me that, thing, though.
> **Agent:** Scp-####?
> **Scp-####-02-1:** Yeah, as a sort of leverage. To keep me loyal. Of course, you can't continue to do something that you never started. Which brings me to how I "died".
> **Agent:** died?
> **Scp-####-02-1:** That's what M,C, and D think. I had already soaked up all the information I could find in the agent's house and it was getting harder to avoid assignments so I decided to escape. Of course, escaping wasn't going to be a quiet expedition. These people were disgusting, allowing rich [Expletive Expunged] to hurt or kill people with unknown threats. So I used one of their "products" to annihilate the agent, his house, and everything inside. Sadly, some of the things inside didn't want to be destroyed and when I came to I was staring at the... What did you call it?
> **Agent:** Scp-####?
> **Scp-####-02-1:** Yeah, ####, anyway I found myself once again making my way home in a daze and spending an extended period of time recuperating. Luckily, this time, I remembered the techniques outlined by M,C, and D for dealing with #### and was able to master the disorientation.
> **Agent:** Alright then, how did you discover "Sam and Carl's Printing" as a front company?
> **Scp-####-02-1:** Well, part of M,C, and D's techniques regarding #### is learning to use it. Sometimes doors will bend independently of their frame, this can be used to see what's behind them. I used that combined with the same concept involving cabinets to find out your company's secret.
> **Agent:** So, Scp-####'s effect has patterns?
> **Scp-####-02-1:** They are incredibly difficult to recognise but with practice, they are the only thing that allows you to comprehend the world around you.
> **<Interview Ends>**
> **Note:** Most of scp-####-02-1's story coincides with known occurrences in the area in question, however, no patterns have been recognised in scp-####-02 as of yet.
> Also, scp-####-02-1 seems rather linguistically intelligent culminating in superfluous dialogue, interviews should be conducted by personnel with a "rigid" personality.
> scp-####-02-1 has gathered a large amount of information regarding Marshall, Carter and Dark Ltd. this information may be useful and must be acquired as quickly as possible.

**Energetic Foundation Employee**

**Item #:** SCP-####

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**

Scp-#### is to be escorted back to a standard humanoid containment chamber when not authorised to move about the facility with a minimum of five (5) members of Containment Force-Xi Thirty Six (CF-Ξ36) as escort or on active duty with a minimum of three (3) members of CF-Ξ36.
    Scp-####'s containment chamber is to be furnished as requested and approved, supplied with any requested and approved reading material and office supplies, and new bed sheets are to be provided twice weekly.
    Scp-#### is currently employed with the foundation as an acting containment specialist as well as working in conjunction with multiple mobile task forces and response teams.
    Scp-####'s security clearance remains level 4 but scp-#### is to be heavily and extensively investigated before any official requests are granted or denied. Due to scp-####'s known dissociative personality disorder and the danger associated with scp-####'s abilities.

//"Yes, we all know he is intimidating, even before we knew he was scp quality he was unnerving, but overriding the security check out of fear is grounds for disciplinary action" -(admin)//

Scp-#### is generally cooperative regarding requests but has experience with the foundation's regulation and will not comply to anything that is unnecessarily risky to the foundation. See Incident Log-####-2.
