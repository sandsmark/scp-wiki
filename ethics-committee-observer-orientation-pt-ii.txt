|||||| *** Now joining: #ecinit** ||
||> **##gray|ROFEBRON##** |||| Okay I believe that's everyone ||
||> **##gray|ROFEBRON##** |||| I count the right number of people ||
||> **##darkorchid|NATAWONG##** |||| this is everyone ||
||> **##red|ARCMITCH##** |||| This looks about right. ||
||> **##red|ARCMITCH##** |||| So, everyone here has been through orientation already. ||
||> **##red|ARCMITCH##** |||| If you haven't, I have no idea how you possibly got here in the first place. ||
||> **##darkorange|HZRDBHT##** |||| Hello everyone, new Observers.||
||> **##green|TRNROSNR##** |||| So, who wants to run real orientation this time?||
||> **##darkorchid|NATAWONG##** |||| me ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| absolutely not ||
||> **##gray|ROFEBRON##** |||| No ||
||> **##green|TRNROSNR##** |||| You are the last person allowed to run real orientation ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| I will ||
||> **##green|TRNROSNR##** |||| Chibi, I'll help. ||
|||||| *** CHYAMAG set mode +m on #ecinit** ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| questions can come later ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| but for now, we'll run orientation this way||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| first of all, welcome to Ethics Committee ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| and welcome to the Observers ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| I'm sure all of you know sirc from using it in your various departments ||
||> **##green|TRNROSNR##** |||| Observers rely heavily on Ethics Committee sirc for communication and collaboration. ||
||> **##green|TRNROSNR##** |||| As you could probably tell from the above conversation, we're a little more laid back about how we talk to one another. || 
||> **##green|TRNROSNR##** |||| Some of us do write as if our shift key is broken, though. || 
||> **##darkorchid|NATAWONG##** |||| some of us want to relax sometimes ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| you're gonna be working with each other relatively closely, likely in small groups such as the six of us you see in here ||
||> **##red|ARCMITCH##** |||| That would be us. ||
|| || //**##darkorchid|NATAWONG## waves**// ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| there's also the main observer room, which is __#ecobsm__ ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| you'll likely end up finding yourself with a group of a few others who you work together very well with ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| make a room for yourselves on ECsirc ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| we're all professionals with a very serious joob, ,sure, but there's not much of a reason to be so stingy about how you talk to each other ||
||> **##green|TRNROSNR##** |||| We have greater concerns beyond hyperprofessional emails. ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| now, with that part out of the way ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| on behalf of absolutely every Observer ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| we're sorry ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| I know that you've been prepped on what this job is, and you've been warned what it will do to you ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| and by both your consent and your mental profile, you've been determined to be a suitable Observer ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| I will say this righ tnow ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| things can and will be worse than you think ||
||> **##green|TRNROSNR##** |||| Your job is covert monitoring and investigation of Foundation activities regarding breaches in ethical protocol. ||
||> **##green|TRNROSNR##** |||| This is one of the hardest jobs in the Foundation, and not because monitoring and investigation is difficult. ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| Ethics Committee establishes what the Line We Do Not Cross is ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| and we watch that line ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| unseen by everyone else except for each other ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| you will see some goddamn awful things ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| and sometimes you will have to say "this is fine" even if it isn't ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| because if you don't do it, something worse will come ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| sometimes you will find things that are so clearly unnecessary, and yet ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| they continued ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| let me put it this way ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| we ain't optimists anymore ||
||> **##green|TRNROSNR##** |||| I doubt most of you are optimists anyway, since you're here, but the rose shades come off here ||
||> **##darkorchid|NATAWONG##** |||| theyre gonna snap right in half ||
||> **##darkorange|HZRDBHT##** |||| You're going to feel sick a lot. Physically and mentally. ||
||> **##red|ARCMITCH##** |||| This is why we talk to one another. ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| you are goign to make friends here in this department ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| you fucking hold onto them ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| they will keep you sane ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| nobody is going to look at the things you say to each other unless there's a damn good reason for it ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| this job is going to weigh on you like a fucking anvil ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| you talk to one another, you help one another ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| on the job and in private ||
||> **##green|TRNROSNR##** |||| Nobody in the Observers is a one-person team. ||
||> **##green|TRNROSNR##** |||| Take it from us. We're serious about not isolating yourselves. ||
||> **##gray|ROFEBRON##** |||| Don't try it ||
||> **##gray|ROFEBRON##** |||| You might die ||
||> **##gray|ROFEBRON##** |||| Not a joke ||
||> **##green|TRNROSNR##** |||| Your job is very g-ddamn crucial. ||
||> **##green|TRNROSNR##** |||| And you cannot talk about this with anyone other than other Observers. ||
||> **##green|TRNROSNR##** |||| Other Observers are the only people who can know that you're an Observer. ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| well, and the EthCom staff psychologists, but they're a busy bunch ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| for obvious reasons ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| well, now that we've scared you all shitless (sorry) I guess if anyone's got any questions? ||
||> **##green|TRNROSNR##** |||| You're free to disconnect if you don't. Remember to join __#ecobsm__  as well, and set it on your auto-join list. ||
||> **##darkorchid|NATAWONG##** |||| ill be ur friend if u dont have any friends mine are mean to me ||
|||||| *** CHYAMAG set mode -m on #ecinit** ||
||> **##green|TRNROSNR##** |||| For fuck's sake, Wong. ||
||> **##darkorchid|NATAWONG##** |||| see what i mean ||
||> **##dodgerblue|CHYAMAG##** |||| ANYWAY, questions? ||
||||||*** Leaving room...**  ||
||||||*** DISCONNECTED**   ||
