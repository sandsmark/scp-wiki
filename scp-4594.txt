**Item #:** SCP-4594

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** An appropriate number of Foundation agents must be embedded as sewerage maintenance personnel in affected London boroughs and are tasked with reporting novel instances of SCP-4594-1 and 4594-2 to Site-95. Non-Foundation personnel and civilians observing or otherwise interacting with SCP-4594 are to be amnesticised and released.

The location of the primary SCP-4594 mass must be tracked via ground-penetrating radar. A minimum of one drone-based exploration of SCP-4594's interior is to be conducted on a monthly basis with the purpose of identifying any deviation from the established characteristics of the object.

**Description:** SCP-4594 is a human esophagus, measuring approximately 380 km in length, located below the city of London, UK. SCP-4594 forms an uninterrupted loop that extends across the Greater London county. The majority of SCP-4594’s mass is located at an average depth of 25 m below the surface. However, shorter tubes extend upward from the primary structure at irregular intervals and terminate in either sphincters (SCP-4594-1), which expel matter from the object, or mouth-like cavities[[footnote]]Although vestigial jaws and teeth often accompany observed cavities, mastication does not occur.[[/footnote]] (SCP-4594-2), which accept matter. These structures are seamlessly connected to the city’s sewerage infrastructure and are the only conventional means of access to SCP-4594.

SCP-4594 is motile. In addition to undergoing continuous peristalsis[[footnote]]Peristalsis is the contraction and relaxation of muscles that propagates in a wave down a tube. In the process of digestion, peristalsis propels material along the gastrointestinal tract.[[/footnote]], the object is capable of large-scale movement by using its own mass to abrade the surrounding earth. In this manner, SCP-4594 has adapted to the changing subterranean infrastructural landscape of the city by selectively avoiding certain structures, including the London Underground, while remaining in proximity to the evolving sewerage network.

SCP-4594’s interior is host to an indeterminate number of rodents and other small mammals that use the object as a means of travel. Movement within SCP-4594 occurs by utilising the object's peristaltic contractions to achieve forward propulsion. The majority of the population consists of house mice (//Mus musculus//) and brown rats (//Rattus norvegicus//), but cats, dogs, foxes, moles, and Eastern grey squirrels have also been documented. Despite the high incidence of crowding, SCP-4594’s occupants are docile and do not actively interact with one another, instead remaining limp while within SCP-4594. There is no evidence to suggest that animals observed in SCP-4594 are anomalous in origin.

SCP-4594 has been known to the Foundation since 1994. However, the object is believed to have existed in some form since at least the advent of London’s modern sewerage system in the late 19th century based on an examination of administrative records and disparate personal accounts of city residents.

Direct observation of SCP-4594 has been largely unfeasible given the logistical challenges of accessing the object. As of September 2003, the Foundation has implemented ground-penetrating radar capable of distinguishing between SCP-4594 and the surrounding material. This remains the sole reliable method of observing the object and tracking its movements.

**Object Discovery:** An examination of the drainage pipes in the basement of a private residential property[[footnote]] Mbai was the subject of a missing person report which prompted the initial search of the residence.[[/footnote]] in southeast London on 26^^th^^ April 1994 revealed an instance of SCP-4594-2. At the time, the rapidly necrosing head of Nahas Mbai, the owner and sole of occupant of the property, was found lodged within the plumbing and further examination revealed a clean transition between Mbai's throat and SCP-4594. The rest of his body could not be located. Three hours following its discovery, Mbai’s head had decayed to the extent that only the jaws and several molar teeth remained intact, with the majority of decomposed matter falling through the throat into SCP-4594. By that stage, it had become largely indistinguishable from other instances of 4594-2.

The fate of Mbai's 47 pet fancy mice and rats[[footnote]]Mbai maintained detailed records, including physical descriptions, of every rodent he had bred over the course of 23 years[[/footnote]], could not be determined. This remains the only documented case in which SCP-4594 was found in the plumbing of a residential property.
