**Item #:** SCP-4594

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** An appropriate number of Foundation agents must be embedded as sewerage maintenance personnel in affected London boroughs and are tasked with reporting novel instances of SCP-4594-1 and 4594-2 to Site-95. Non-Foundational personnel and civilians observing or otherwise interacting with SCP-4594 are to be amnesticised where necessary.

The location of the primary SCP-4594 mass must be tracked via ground-penetrating radar. A minimum of one drone-based exploration of SCP-4594's interior is to be conducted on a monthly basis with the purpose of identifying any deviation from the established characteristics of the object.

**Description:** SCP-4594 is a tubular organic structure resembling a human esophagus located below the city of London, UK. SCP-4594 forms an uninterrupted loop approximately 380 km in length that extends across, and is limited to, the area of Greater London. The majority of SCP-4594’s mass is located at an average depth of 25 m below the surface. However, shorter tubes extend upward from the primary structure at irregular intervals and terminate in either sphincters (SCP-4594-1), which expel matter from the object, or mouth-like cavities[[footnote]]Although vestigial jaws and teeth often accompany observed cavities, mastication does not occur.[[/footnote]] (SCP-4594-2), which accept matter. These structures are seamlessly connected to the city’s sewerage infrastructure and are the only conventional means of access to SCP-4594.

SCP-4594 is motile. In addition to undergoing continuous peristalsis[[footnote]]Peristalsis is the contraction and relaxation of muscles that propagates in a wave down a tube. In the process of digestion, peristalsis propels material along the gastrointestinal tract.[[/footnote]], the object is capable of large-scale movement by using its own mass to abrade the surrounding earth. In this manner, SCP-4594 has adapted to the changing subterranean infrastructural landscape of the city by selectively avoiding certain structures, including the London Underground, while remaining in proximity to the evolving sewerage network.

SCP-4594’s interior is host to an indeterminate number of rodents and other small mammals that use the object as a means of travel. The majority of the population consists of house mice (//Mus musculus//) and brown rats (//Rattus norvegicus//), but cats, dogs, foxes, moles, and Eastern grey squirrels have also been documented. Despite the high incidence of crowding, SCP-4594’s occupants are docile and do not actively interact with one another, instead remaining limp while within SCP-4594. There is no evidence to suggest that animals observed in SCP-4594 are anomalous in origin.

SCP-4594 has been known to the Foundation since 1974. However, the object is believed to have existed in some form since at least the advent of London’s modern sewerage system in the late 19th century based on an examination of administrative records and disparate personal accounts of city residents.

Direct observation of SCP-4594 has been largely unfeasible given the logistical challenges of accessing the object. Since 2003, the application of specialized ground-penetrating radar has enabled the Foundation to track the approximate location of SCP-4594. This remains the sole reliable method of observing the object.

**Object Discovery:** An examination of the drainage pipes in the basement of a private residential property in southeast London on 26th April 1974 revealed an instance of SCP-4594-1 and SCP-4594-2. At the time, the body of Nahas Mbai[[footnote]]Mbai was the subject of a missing person report which prompted the initial search of his residence.[[/footnote]], the owner and sole occupant of the property, was found lodged between the plumbing in a way that blocked entry to the SCP-4594-2 instance. Mbai had expired due to blood loss caused by the partial consumption of his abdomen by 14 of his pet mice. It is hypothesised that the rodents were attempting to enter SCP-4594.

The original cause of the appearance of SCP-4594 on the property could not be determined, and this remains the only case in which either SCP-4594-1 or 4594-2 were found in the plumbing of a residential property.
