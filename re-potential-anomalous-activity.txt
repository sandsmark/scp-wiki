To: Wheeler, Marion<br></p>
<p>I don't remember everything. But I think I remember you. Where are you?</p>
<p>I think something is in my head. It is eating my memories. I don't know how to stop it. </p>
<p>And it thinks I am delicious.</p>

<p>I am <span class="vanish">not interested in any more of this behavior. As you've now decided to go over my head without authority, I'm rapidly </span> coming <span class="vanish">to the conclusion that this job is not </span>for you<span class="vanish">. You are insubordinate</span> and I <span class="vanish">cannot continue to </span> consume <span class="vanish">so much company time on </span>your <span class="vanish">behalf. Please begin clearing out your desk, if you don't </span> mind.</p>

To: Tom Scannell<br></p>
<p>Sir, I <span class="appear">refuse to </span>apologize for messaging you so late this evening<span class="appear"> because people's lives are at stake. Don't patronize me</span>. <span class="vanish">What I'm particularly concerned about is the impact in the event that </span>I'm right. We're talking about a whole department, integral to the structure of the Foundation's work in memetics, that disappeared overnight.</p>
<p><span class="vanish">Given what I feel is the urgency of the matter, </span>I have put in a request to see if I can get approval to pursue this line of investigation as a special project. <span class="vanish">I understand I am not a researcher, but the matter is constantly weighing on me.</span><span class="appear"> I don't care if you like it or not. I know what I'm doing. I was trained in antimemetic containment. I don't remember my training, but I know I was trained. And I am winning this fight.</span></p>

<p>Ms. Jones:</p>
<p>Have <span class="vanish"> you considered speaking to an onsite therapist? I don't know how to put this delicately, but </span> you <span class="vanish">are exhibiting erratic and unusual behavior. The other possibility is that you have interacted with something you should not have. Have you </span>forgotten <span class="vanish">where you stand in this organization? Or </span>what <span class="vanish"> clearances you are authorized? I am considering placing </span>you <span class="vanish">on administrative leave until you speak to a Foundation counselor. That's what they are </span>trained for<span class="vanish">. Handling people who get nosy and fuck their own heads up.</span></p>

<p>Ms. Jones:</p>
<p>You <span class="vanish">are making this unnecessarily difficult. I am sure you understand that, since you have been a foundation employee for as long as you have, you </span>are <span class="vanish">entitled to certain opinions about the way we operate around here. I ask you </span>del<span class="vanish">iver on certain tangible, reportable data, and you don’t. You constantly question decisions above your pay grade. And for the </span>ici<span class="vanish">ng on the cake, you make ludicr</span>ous<span class="vanish"> assertions about the management of budgets without any proof to back it up. This is unacceptable</span>.</p>
