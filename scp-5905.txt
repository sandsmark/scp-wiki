SCP-5905 "Gashadokuro" written by: [[*user ManyMeats]]

Credit where credit is due to Shigeaki Yamauchi's "World's Bizarre Thriller Complete Works 2: Monsters of the World" (1972) which is where the yokai known as Gashadokuro first appeared. Being a ravenous fan of mythology, I was happy to have consumed this idea for nightmare fuel and regurgitated it into this, even if it's a "modern creation" versus other myth and legend.

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-5905 is contained in a sensitive materials vault at Site-17. The consumption of any type of food or water, including those required for medical or emergency purposes, is strictly prohibited within five meters of SCP-5905. The study of SCP-5905 is limited to secondary sources only.

All known instances of SCP-5905-1 have been destroyed. If additional instances of SCP-5905-1 should be encountered, all directives and priorities below Code Black are rescinded until the entity's destruction has been secured.

**Description:** SCP-5905 is a leather-bound grimoire recovered from the Huang Shui basin in Qinghai, China. This book details the treatment of prisoners, the preparation of objects of sacrifice, and a number of other ritualistic practices of an unclear cultural origin. Prolonged exposure to SCP-5905 causes hyperstimulation of the hypothalamus, resulting in accelerated metabolism and dramatically increased feelings of hunger and thirst. The book describes this effect as the "Purity of Consumption" and encourages exploration of these feelings by practitioners.

Within the pages of SCP-5905 is a ritual that is believed to be responsible for the creation of instances of SCP-5905-1. Due to ethical concerns, this cannot be verified.

> **[2015.02.28]**
> //Foundation Site-36 received an urgent distress call from joint Chinese and GOC forces operating in the Qinghai province. Rapid response teams were dispatched while drone surveillance was deployed. GOC was notified of our intended assistance. The only intel provided was that they were engaged with a humanoid entity of unknown origin and intent.//
> 
> --**1301 hours:** MTF arrived at the last known location of GOC forces and followed a trail of destruction in order to locate SCP-5905-1 within the boundaries of a small fishing village. The total destruction of the GOC forces requesting backup is assumed. SCP-5905-1 was identified as a partially fleshed humanoid skeleton standing approximately 18 meters in height. The entity engaged MTF forces when they attempted to aid in the evacuation of local citizens.
> 
> --**1310 hours:** Deployed armaments are ineffective. MTF forces requested aerial strike and additional support. The rib cage of SCP-5905-1 expands and its thoracic cavity distends as a mass of tentacles explodes out from within. The appendages latch on to all available sources of organic matter including the GOC, MTF, and villagers, and adds them to its mass. SCP-5905-1 has increased in size by approximately 25%.
> 
> --**1328 hours:** Rockwell B-1 Lancer launched from Site-36 arrived at the conflict zone and fired precision-guided munitions at SCP-5905-1. Although the entity was impeded, it withstood the bombardment. Additional support requested.
> 
> --**1330 hours:** A Tomahawk Cruise Missile was fired from GOC Strategic Command Base #22 and MTF forces were advised to retreat to a minimum safe distance.
> 
> --**1335 hours:** Cruise missile arrived and detonated on target. MTF reports SCP-5905-1 was on fire but otherwise ambulatory and headed in the direction of another populated settlement. The Chinese government was notified and instructed to order an evacuation.
> 
> --**1358 hours:** Permission was given by the Chinese government to escalate the use of force. MTF was notified to vacate the area as a Boeing B-52 was deployed with a payload of 1 GBU-34/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB).
> 
> --**1420 hours:** SCP-5905-1 arrived at the farming village. The last recorded census puts the village at a population of 280; total casualties are unknown but assumed in totality. 
> 
> --**1501 hours:** Bomber signaled imminent arrival; Forces withdrew. SCP-5905-1 has finished feeding and is now 39 meters in height.
> 
> --**1508 hours:** MOAB detonates on target. SCP-5905-1 is destroyed as confirmed by MTF. Remaining biological fragments collected for incineration.

[[collapsible show="Addendum.2: Video Log" hide="Log off and return to the main file"]]
//After the events of Addendum.1, MTF operatives backtraced the path of destruction to a small farming community composed of 6 hovels and a central storehouse. The exterior door of the storehouse had been circumvented by percussive force, and several strips of flesh were found embedded in and around the door frame.//

//In the center of the storehouse was a ritual circle utilizing a number of thaumic sigils, pictographs, and cuneiform invocations centered around a beryllium bronze post one meter in height. Scattered among the debris were several implements of torture, three sets of manacles caked in an unidentified viscous compound, and various pieces of video recording equipment. These videos have been translated from a dialect of Hungarian known as Moldavian, transcribed, and attached to this file. Extraneous audio and video omitted.//

//Footage begins with the frame obscured by the upper body of the camera's operator as they adjust focus. The individual has been designated as POI-XXXX.//

> **POI-XXXX:** Tuesday, day 1. The prisoner is a healthy local male, aside from bruises sustained in apprehension. Chinese national. Vitals are good. Liver function so-so. We begin tonight at sundown. I've read the book a hundred times, I've said the words two hundred times. Nothing else sates me anymore. We will cut until I find satisfaction.

//POI-XXXX backs away from the camera and looks into the lens, smiles, nods, and steps to the side. Shackled to a metal post with their hands above their head is an adult male; name, age, and nationality unknown. Concentric rings of sigils surround the individual but the angle of the camera and poor lighting render them indecipherable. The subject's eyes are glazed over suggesting the use of a sedative or the side-effects of a concussion.//

//Video is fast-forwarded several hours. As the surroundings darken, unidentified accomplices in hooded robes place and light candles at various locations throughout the room. As these individuals place candles they rhythmically chant a four-line poem. The audio and translation have been redacted due to a suspected cognitohazardous link to SCP-5905. When the candles are lit, the five hooded participants and the ritual leader, POI-XXXX, assemble around the ritual's target and continue chanting. After nearly an hour of prayer, POI-XXXX retrieves an implement from off-screen and makes a series of small incisions on the torso of the subject in order to create cuneiform characters. The subject is screaming. The video ends.//

//This ritual practice is repeated for an additional 8 days, making 9 days in total.//

//By the 10th day, the ritual subject is severely emaciated. Cheeks, eyes, ribs are all sunken and his abdomen is distended. Legs and arms are visibly atrophied at a rate substantially more aggressive than expected for ten days of confinement. The ritual continues as normal except POI-XXXX retrieves a different implement. A hexagonal piece of metal is placed around the base of the ritual subject's index finger. When activated, cutting implements deploy and the metal band is twisted and pulled, ripping the subject's flesh from their finger and leaving behind only bone. While continuing to chant over the subject's screaming, POI-XXXX feeds the flesh to the ritual subject, placing it in their mouth and forcing them to swallow. The video ends.//

//Footage resumes on day 11 and the ritual repeats as it did on the 10th day with a different finger. The ritual repeats each day until all fingers have been consumed by the end of day 19. It is noted that after day 16, the subject no longer resists ingestion.//

> **Note:** Despite exposed wounds, severe malnourishment, and suspected dehydration, the ritual subject appears both alert and responsive during all interactions.

//Footage resumes on day 20. Each participant in the ritual enters the circle wielding an implement similar to a corkscrew, which they plunge into either the bicep or thigh of the ritual subject. Upon withdrawing the implement, they remove and eat the accompanying chunk of flesh while reciting an invocation. The ritual continues using the metal band to remove flesh from the toes and surrounding tissue on days 21 through 30.//

//On day 31, POI-XXXX begins by unshackling the ritual subject and reciting a final invocation. Ritual subject begins to claw at their own skin with the bones of their fingers, tearing strips and chunks from other wound sites as they begin aggressive autocannibalism. This continues for an additional two hours as more and more bone and soft tissue are exposed.//

//Shortly before what is assumed to be sunrise, the ritual subject goes limp as their breathing becomes ragged and inconsistent. Their last act before losing consciousness is to remove and eat their own eyes. Clothing and whatever skin remains visible on their body begin to dissolve as they slump against the post. Pronounced cracking and snapping sounds can be heard over the continuous chanting of participants as the ritual subject begins to grow in size, their skeletal structures bulging and bursting between remaining tissue. Ritual subject's limbs elongate as it pulls itself up, finishing its conversion to SCP-5905-1.//

//Ritual participants break from their chanting and try to flee. SCP-5905-1 lunges for one of the participants and grabs onto them, shoving the subject's head into its distended jaw and biting it off. Further cracking and snapping can be heard as SCP-5905-1 visibly increases in mass by approximately 5%. It then drops the deceased participant and exits off-screen in pursuit of the other ritualists. Wood is heard splintering and the camera is knocked onto its side. The footage ends.//
