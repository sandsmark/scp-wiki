**Item #:** SCP-777

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Even though SCP-777 can NOT be contained. He has decided to stay at the Foundation so he can complete his mission. He is to be supplied with any and all things that he asks for. He is to stay in a room resembling a Japanese dojo with a tank of sharks, except the tank is in the floor.

**Description:** SCP-777 or Darkblade (Blade for short), as he chooses to be called is white male of about 17 years old. He has flowing white hair with green highlights and crystal blue eyes that reflect a dark past. He is clad in ebony armor that he made himself. His effect on female personnel (which may not even be a supernatural effect) is very powerful. He is a smooth pimp, who gets all the ladies. He has chosen Iris as his bride though to wed when his mission is over. His element is water, which he has full control of, and he has a pet dragon, who must be referred to as "Set". Blade's power of water as well as his supernatural skill with a Katana protects him from all harm. When he is attacked in any way water shields will appear around him and deflect the attack back to the attackers.
