**Item #:** SCP-4559

**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** Studies that revolve around the psychology of customers within grocery stores are to be heavily monitored, and all information regarding SCP-4559's effect is to be removed under the guise of being incorrect information.

**Description:** SCP-4559 is a probabilistic anomaly associated with the choice on whether or not a person wants a receipt or not within most grocery stores. In the case where there are either rules that state that the customer always receives the receipt, or in the event that the customer is given the receipt without their prior approval, SCP-4559 will not trigger. 

If none of those events occur, if a person is asked by the clerk if they wish to receive a receipt, the choice on whether or not the subject accepts or denies the receipt is entirely random.  This has been determined to be a 50% chance for both outcomes. The subject's mental state, gender, or wealth will not influence this effect, and the choice will always be a 50/50 chance. 

Currently, SCP-4559 is the only truly "random" thing in the universe known to the Foundation. For example, quantum mechanics, weather, ocean currents, pseudorandom number generators, or an event as simple as a coin flip can be predicted in some way, but SCP-4559 cannot be predicted in any way.

**Addendum:** After a meeting with the O5 Council, SCP-4559 has been reclassified as Thaumiel for its use in the containment of numerous anomalies that require a random number generator. The Hensworth/Alice Number Generator uses security camera footage from nearly 20,000 grocery stores within the US, which analyzes footage from the checkout aisles and uses the information generated from SCP-4559 to create a truly random number. Currently, the Hensworth/Alice Number Generator is being used in the containment of 39 Safe-class anomalies, 21 Euclic-class anomalies, 8 Keter-class anomalies, and 2 Thaumiel-class anomalies.
