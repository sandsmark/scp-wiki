++++ Featured Articles

* The featured articles for August were [[[SCP-2779]]] ("Oinkers") by [[*user Rimple]], [[[Stop going in circles]]] by [[*user Tuomey Tombstone]], and [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/recruitment-drive-28126 |Recruitment Drive (R-28126)]]] by [[*user tretter]]. The first is about a pig that //isn't// running Arch Linux, the second is about a failure to care, and the third is about the Factory's aggressive hiring practices. Check them out!

++++ Editor's Choice Articles

* [[[SCP-3250]]] ("Jesus Fried Chicken") - Rumor has it that on the third day Christ's body was in the cave... Colonel Sanders came out. By [[*user LilyFlower]] and [[*user minmin]]. //A fantastic work that starts with a relatively silly premise... and then pushes it: from absurd to hilarious to unsettling to horrific. However, the article never loses sight of the comedic core - both authors are aware that the Colonel is at the kernel of this piece, so to speak, and in keeping on eye on him and one on his chicken manage to straddle the line between comedy and horror. It's a thin, breaded line, and the dynamic duo do it with aplomb.//

Thanks for tuning in again, folks! If you're unsatisfied with the blurb(s) provided for the article(s) you wrote, feel free to change it. Of course, you could just avoid that problem entirely by sending [[*user A Random Day]] a blurb for your article. We may or may not use it (if we can think of something more attention-getting, though we can try to stick with one you give us) but we'd really would just like them in order to make the process easier for making these. This is a community thing, and we want authors to give their blurbs to sell these articles much easier. It reduces the workload we have to do, and helps the news come out that much earlier!
