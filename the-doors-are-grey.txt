The doors are grey of my gaol
[[span style="margin-left:2em"]]they my thoughts betwixt my sleep[[/span]]
return to silence wroth and cold.

Your days are spent in deepest thought
[[span style="margin-left:2em"]]mine are drain'd, in useless keep[[/span]]
You call me 'threat', to humans brought.

Of this my guilt is clearly shown,
[[span style="margin-left:2em"]]you, Foundation's blame will sweep.[[/span]]
My diff'rent ways are not my own.

The silence does me harm no more,
[[span style="margin-left:2em"]]you, the hard faced dogs will leap[[/span]]
to hold me here on captive shore.

My secret lay within my soul,
[[span style="margin-left:2em"]]Now and Ever you will Weep.[[/span]]
when Now I show my final goal.

Fire is Mine to make it clear,
[[span style="margin-left:2em"]]Sweet as dearest cassareep.[[/span]]
Behold my fiery Justly Fear.

Containment breach, your dire loss
[[span style="margin-left:2em"]]Burned from life as useless dross. [[/span]]
