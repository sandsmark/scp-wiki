**Item #:** SCP-1057

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1057 is kept in a concrete containment pool approximately 3.7 meters deep, 15 meters long, and 9 meters wide. The pool is filled with water treated in a manner consistent with that of public swimming pools. The containment pool is located in a locked and bolted concrete room in Site 17; the room may only be entered for research and feeding purposes. Upon entering the containment block a motion sensor will activate two industrial strength fluorescent light fixtures that are focused on the pool to ensure that SCP-1057 is in sight at all times. If the lights lose power during feeding or experimentation at any time, for any reason, personnel are required to evacuate the room immediately and remain outside until power returns. Contact with water in the pool must be avoided at all costs. SCP-1057 is to be fed one live adult pig per month. 

**Description:** SCP-1057's only visible form is a shadow that roughly mimics that of a tiger shark. Depending on the size of its enclosure SCP-1057 may shrink to as little as 1 meter or grow to ██ meters in length. It can only be seen in bright light; dim lighting makes SCP-1057 difficult to distinguish from ordinarily occurring shadows. Attempts to determine if there is some invisible organism casting the shadow have failed to find any evidence of SCP-1057’s presence other than the shadow. 

 SCP-1057 appears to be sentient though not particularly intelligent; it is able to detect any small disturbance in the water in its enclosure, though it will ignore disturbances caused by inanimate objects. It appears to have some method of detecting vital signs. Attempts to provoke a reaction with robotic probes have proven unsuccessful. The introduction of plant matter initially drew interest from the SCP-1057 however, after several replications of the initial experiment, it has ceased responding to plant material. 

If a living creature is introduced into the pool SCP-1057 will immediately move towards the organism. Due to the limited size of its habitat it is difficult to determine its maximum speed, but in the years since its containment it has been clocked at speeds in excess of ██km/hr with a maximum observed speed of ██km/hr. Its prey will, in most cases, attempt to flee. In past experiments the prey was placed at the edge of the pool and it attempted to escape by climbing out; this escape attempt always failed. Humans have been observed to pound at the air above the pool's edge, and some may even attempt to climb from the pool by clawing at the air; audio recordings seem indicate that SCP-1057’s prey sees the sides of the pool growing taller. It is unclear whether this is a memetic or spacial function of the shadow. It appears that, once spotted by SCP-1057, prey is unable to leave the pool. Once the shadow touches the prey large chunks of flesh will be ripped away from it and will disappear into the water above SCP-1057. Slow-motion footage from security cameras placed in the containment room show that they prey is being eaten by something, presumably SCP-1057. 

 In most cases the prey is devoured in less than a minute though the exact amount of time varies depending on the victim's size. Blood from larger kills dissipates within two minutes of their death. After all traces of its prey are gone SCP-1057 returns to its previous pattern of behavior. Previous to containment SCP-1057 would only consume one victim in a month's time and, because of its infrequent attacks, proved capable of inhabiting a public pool in ███████, ████ for ██ months without detection. Since its capture and subsequent containment SCP-1057 has become increasingly aggressive and will attack anything that enters its pool regardless of how recently it has been fed.

SCP-1057 was initially retrieved from a public pool in ███████, ████. An investigation of the facilities was launched 27 people disappeared while swimming over the course of ██ months. After review of the security footage revealed that the victims never left the pool the SCP foundation was alerted by an embedded agent and began investigation and retrieval protocols immediately. Upon further review of the footage it was discovered that SCP-1057 only attacked during peak hours when the pool was crowded and the screams of its prey would be difficult to hear. Other patrons would often fail to notice the prey’s absence for minutes or even hours. It seems improbable that they would have failed to notice its attack under normal circumstances; there is a possibility that, while attacking, SCP-1057 exhibits memetic properties that prevent others from noticing it or its victim.
 
Initial containment was achieved by closing the pool to the public for one month. At the beginning of SCP-1057’s next feeding period a portable containment block containing a pig was lowered into the pool. Once SCP-1057 “swam” into the block and began to attack the pig the door was closed, successfully trapping SCP-1057 and it was transported back to Site 17. It is unknown how SCP-1057 arrived at the pool however it seems likely that, due to its ability to alter its size, it was living in the water system prior to its arrival.
