**Item #:** SCP-1616

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1616 is contained in a ventilated 60 x 30 cm cage lined with small grates on the bottom for waste materials. On the inside of this cage are photographs of food and water taken at the site.

At no time is SCP-1616 allowed to view photographs or illustrations of anything save for its daily food supplements.

As of Testing Event 1616D6, no testing subjects with tattoos are permitted to enter the area.

**Description:** SCP-1616 is a common hamster with no genetic abnormalities. The subject appears to behave as a normal hamster would.

Anomalous properties of SCP-1616 present themselves when SCP-1616 begins feeding. One or both of SCP-1616's cheeks will expand, containing an object previously seen by SCP-1616. If the object in question is inorganic, SCP-1616 will remove the object from its mouth and ignore it. Similar feeding has been observed for most organic materials save for wood, which SCP-1616 will not completely consume, but return to and nibble like a common hamster would for dental upkeep.

SCP-1616 consumes organic matter which appears in its cheek over a course of time long enough to consume it. SCP-1616 has been observed producing carrots, hamster feed, candy, and substantial amounts of flesh from its cheeks. SCP-1616 cheeks will expand to accommodate any matter it produces, in one case the cheek expanded to a size accommodating for one baby elephant weighing of 105 kilograms.

SCP-1616's jaw will retract and expand to remove the object from its mouth. If the object in question is unable to be moved by SCP-1616's power alone, it will usually be emancipated by SCP-1616 moving backwards away from the object. If SCP-1616 lacks the ability to move away from the subject due to lack of traction, it will simply retract its jaw and regurgitate it, pushing itself away. As assumed SCP-1616 has difficulties consuming a still living object depending on its size.

In the case of biological matter emancipated from organic subjects, nervous tissue seems to respond as if it were still in the host body. Subjects report feeling pain as if it were happening under normal circumstances and nervous tissue was not disconnected at all, suggesting a sort of connection between the inside of SCP-1616's mouth and the host subject.

Due to its nature it is recommended SCP-1616 not be exposed to any photographs or illustrations, especially those considered dangerous. It is not confirmed whether or not SCP-1616's feeding process will be harmful, or successful to SCP-1616 with hazardous objects.

SCP-1616's jaw appears to retract and expand, SCP-1616 is observed pulling the respective eye out of its cheek, cleaning it, and nibbling on it for a few moments before placing it back in its mouth. An optic nerve is also visible attached  to the eye and leading into SCP-1616's mouth.//
