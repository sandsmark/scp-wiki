**Item #:** SCP-363 

**Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-363 specimens are contained in a 2m x 2m x 2m room that is to be constantly illuminated by high-powered lighting. This lighting must be connected to multiple redundant sources of power, and in case of total system failure, Mobile Task Force Eta-Seven is to be dispatched to assess the threat.

SCP-363 is to be fed twenty (20) lab mice, administered once every fourty-eight (48) hours.

**Description:** Ostensibly, SCP-363 are identical to //Scolopendra gigantea//, or the Amazonian giant centipede. Dietary needs are identical, and DNA inspection has proved no dissimilarities to normal //Scolpendra gigantea//. 

SCP-363 has been observed to actively seek out dark places when in normal shape. Start of transformation usually occurs approx. 5 minutes after SCP-363 is fully immersed in darkness. SCP-363 will attack and devour any mammal above the size of of a rabbit that it encounters. SCP-363 must be targeted with machine-gun fire for a prolonged period of time to be eliminated. 

SCP-363 is, under normal circumstances, the appropiate size for //Scolopendra gigantea//. In darkness, however, (darkness defined as: the level of light one would normally encounter outside, at night, away from any open light sources), SCP-363 will grow rapidly and eratically, to sizes of approx. 10 meters long, up to 2 meters high. SCP-363 does not retain the form of a centipede under these conditions. So far, reports have documented: proboscii, tentacles, highly elongated mandibles, an erratic number of eyes and legs, and, in one case, [DATA EXPUNGED]. SCP-363 will revert back to normal size and appearance after 2-3 hours of complete illumination. 

**Addendum 1:**  Note from Dr. Skalder: //We've determined that fire seems to scare or ward SCP-363 off. In light of this, we have equipped three of the members of MTF-Eta-Seven, "Creepy Crawlies", with millitary-issue M2A1-7 flamethrowers.//

> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **I.**: Hello,  ███. Please sit down. Thank you, now, you said you saw “something” after the firebombing. Care to expand on 
> that? 
> 
> ███: It was...well, one of those guys from the MTF you had stationed there. Eta-7. One of those guys, yeah.

> ███: //(Short silence)// No. No, I ain’t sure. It...it looked like him, for sure. But there were all these things...growing out of him. 
> Like insect legs, but, all in random places...from his chest, his arms, and...one of ‘em was pokin’ out of of his eyeball. His eye was
