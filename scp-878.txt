**Item #**: SCP-878

**Object Class**: Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures**: The precise nature of SCP-878 is complex. It appears by all evidence that SCP-878-1 has no special abilities separate from SCP-878-2, but 878-2 has shown a primitive sort of willingness to protect 878-1 Their primary effect can be abated by disrupting distribution and broadcast of any media containing SCP-878; Foundation personnel will monitor television, film, or any other media containing SCP-878 for purposes of suppression.

**Description**: SCP-878 is a professional actor, alias "████ ████████" (SCP-878-1), and a knife, specifically a 6^^th^^ century sidearm from the ███████ dynasty in ███ (classified as SCP-878-2). SCP-878-1 has never had a permanent role on any television show, nor a role of any real importance in any film. SCP-878-1 appears approximately once every █ months on the set of various television shows or films during production; the crew forgets SCP-878-1 was ever absent, and alters the script to include "him."

After SCP-878-1's appearance, at some point throughout the course of the plot, the character played by SCP-878-1 will find itself in a situation that brings it into conflict with a more major character. The conflict will develop into blows, which always ends similarly; SCP-878-2 is produced, SCP-878-1 will strike the other character with the back of its left hand (always decorated with an emerald ring of some sort), leaving them sprawled on a desk or some other elevated surface, then plunge the knife fully into the other character's heart. SCP-878-1 will turn towards the camera; at the moment his eyes meet the camera, the show will go to commercial. SCP-878-1 will not be seen again.

At the moment the knife enters the victim, a relatively minor CK-class reality shift occurs. The lesser changes affect the show's plot: the character will now be on the floor, the cause of death will either be changed or the knife will have changed to a more conventional one, and the victim will be played by a different actor or be a different character altogether. 

The vital change occurs to the actor playing the murdered character; namely, the actor will no longer exist. In the new reality, the actor's parents will either never have conceived the actor or a miscarriage will prevent birth. The sole exception to this last point only occurred in an instance when Foundation containment was attempted but failed (see Addendum 878-A). On no recorded occasion has an actor considered culturally important been lost; as such, SCP-878 is considered mildly dangerous but not a major threat, and Keter-level reclassification has been denied.

After the shift, some copies of the original script still exist; copies of SCP-878-affected scripts came into the hands of the Foundation, giving first indication of the abilities of SCP-878. Nothing will appear amiss during filming to anyone, despite the fact that the episode as scripted will contain neither the character SCP-878-1 portrays nor any interaction resembling the fight. The fight as filmed uses a stunt knife and is portrayed as simple acting; only when the event is broadcast does any change occur. 

To the extent that they are a single entity, SCP-878's motives are unknown. All attempts to capture either the actor or the knife have failed to date, though efforts continue.

**Addendum 878-A**: On February 11, 20██, interception failed against SCP-878-1 while filming an episode of popular crime show [REDACTED] and all attempts to delay or prevent broadcast were unsuccessful. When the episode aired, the fight scene was more graphic than when originally filmed (in addition to being far more graphic than FCC regulations or network standards allow). At its climax, after SCP-878 presented its knife, it turned to face the camera and spoke several words in Latin (later reported as “Vide opera vestra, vos fortes, et desperatio”) and plunged the knife into the victim's chest. After the shift concluded, rather than the actor never having been born, the actor's past was altered to that of a serial killer. When reports from both sides of the shift were compiled, it was found that the former actor had murdered █ Foundation agents who had been present on the set, as well as ██ relatives of various Foundation personnel SCP-878 had never encountered. This number includes both children of [REDACTED], who never became a Foundation Overseer as a result of the shift. SCP-878 is classified as Euclid due in part to the apparent impossibility of capture as well as this sudden demonstration of power.
