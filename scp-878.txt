**Item #**: SCP-878

**Object Class**: Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures**: Efforts to physically contain either SCP-878-1 or 878-2 have as yet been unsuccessful. It appears by all evidence that SCP-878-1 has no special abilities separate from SCP-878-2, though 878-2 has shown a primitive sort of willingness to protect 878-1. Their primary effect can be completely abated by disrupting distribution and broadcast of any media containing SCP-878; Foundation personnel will monitor television, film, or any other media containing SCP-878 for purposes of suppression. This has successfully prevented 878's effect in 78% of containment attempts since discovery of SCP-878. Barring this, iterations of SCP-878-3 can be contained and prevented from harming others; this raises containment effectiveness to 95%.

**Description**: SCP-878 is an actor, alias "████ ████████" (SCP-878-1), and a knife, specifically a 6^^th^^ century iron dagger from the ███████ dynasty period in ███ (classified as SCP-878-2). SCP-878-1 has never had a permanent role on any television show, nor a role of any real importance in any film. SCP-878-1 appears approximately once every █ months on the set of various television shows or films during production; the crew forgets SCP-878-1 was ever absent, and alters the script to include "him."

After SCP-878-1's appearance, at some point throughout the course of the plot, the character played by SCP-878-1 will find itself in a situation that brings it into conflict with a more major character. The conflict will develop into blows, which always ends similarly. SCP-878-1 will beat his opponent mercilessly, far beyond both what is necessary to disable the character and beyond the level of brutality typically expected from the film or show in question. Once the other character stands for the last time, SCP-878-1 will strike the other character with the back of his left hand, leaving them sprawled on a desk or some other elevated surface, remove SCP-878-2 from an unknown location, then plunge the knife fully into the other character's heart. SCP-878-1 will turn towards the camera; at the moment his eyes meet the camera, the show will go to commercial or the film will change scenes. SCP-878-1 will not be seen again, and no explanation will be given for his absence.

From this point on, the actor who was "killed" may be identified as SCP-878-3. Once either the show is first broadcast or the film is first screened, SCP-878-3 will begin to display behavioral abnormalities uncharacteristic of their previous personality. This will begin with minor sex scandals and drug addictions, degenerating within a matter of weeks into paranoia and homicidal tendencies. If SCP-878 is observed at work, SCP-878-3 can be contained by Foundation personnel, though the symptoms will never abate and the actor will typically find a way to kill either others or themselves.

To the extent that they are a single entity, SCP-878's motives are unknown. No records of SCP-878-1 appearing in any media without SCP-878-2 exist, and his real identity is unknown. All attempts to capture either the actor or the knife have failed to date, though efforts continue. SCP-878 appears aware of Foundation efforts and, on at least one occasion, has acted with hostility towards the Foundation in particular (see Addendum 878-A).

**Addendum 878-A**: On February 11, 20██, interception failed against SCP-878-1 while filming an episode of popular crime show [REDACTED] and all attempts to delay or prevent broadcast were unsuccessful. When the episode aired, the fight scene was more graphic than when originally filmed, including the almost complete destruction of his victim's [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. At its climax, after SCP-878-2 was plunged into the victim's heart, SCP-878-1 turned to face the camera and spoke several words in Latin (later reported as “Vide opera vestra, vos fortes, et desperatio”) before the show went to commercial. Despite awareness of the event, Foundation personnel proved unable to contain this iteration of SCP-878-3, as symptoms accelerated far more rapidly than usual; the actor had abandoned his former life and began a killing spree within a matter of days. This iteration of SCP-878-3 was successful in killing family members of █ Foundation agents who had been present on the set. Additionally, he was able to [REDACTED] both children of [REDACTED], who was not on the set and later resigned her position as a Foundation Overseer as a result of this loss. SCP-878 is classified as Euclid due in part to Foundation inability to contain it, as well as this sudden demonstration of power.
