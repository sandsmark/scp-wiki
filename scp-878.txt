**Item #**: SCP-878

**Object Class**: Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures**: The precise nature of SCP-878 is difficult to ascertain; to date, it has evaded all attempts at capture. Its primary effect can be abated by disrupting distribution and broadcast of any media containing SCP-878; Foundation personnel will monitor television, film, or any online source containing SCP-878 for purposes of suppression.

**Description**: SCP-878 takes the form of an actor, given name usually ████ ████████. SCP-878 has never had a permanent role on any television show, nor a role of any real importance in any film. SCP-878 appears approximately once every █ months on the set of various television shows or films during production; the crew forgets SCP-878 was ever absent, and the script changes to accept its effect.

After SCP-878's appearance, at some point throughout the course of the plot, the character played by SCP-878 will find itself in a situation that brings it into conflict with a more major character. The conflict will develop into blows, which always ends similarly; SCP-878 will produce a knife, identified by Foundation scholars as a 6^^th^^ century sidearm from the ███████ dynasty in ███. SCP-878 will strike the other character with the back of its left hand (always decorated with an emerald ring of some sort), leaving them sprawled on a desk or some other elevated surface, then plunge the knife fully into the other character's heart.

The timing of what happens next has been confirmed by Foundation personnel immune to SCP-878's effect. At the moment the knife enters the victim, a CK-class reality shift ensues. After the shift, numerous details are always changed: while SCP-878 will still have murdered a character, the character will now be on the floor, the cause of death will either be changed or the knife will have changed to a more conventional one, and the victim will be played by a different actor or be a different character altogether. The original actor who played SCP-878's victim will, in conventional instances, no longer exist, and no records will exist indicating the actor was ever born. Exceptions to this last point only occur in instances when Foundation containment is attempted but fails (see Addendum 878-A).

Nothing will appear amiss during filming to anyone, despite the fact that the episode as scripted will contain neither the character SCP-878 portrays nor any interaction resembling the fight. The fight as filmed uses a simple stunt knife and is portrayed as simple acting; only when the event is broadcast does any change occur.

**Addendum 878-A**: On February 11, 19██, interception failed against SCP-878 while filming an episode of popular crime show “███ & █████” and all attempts to delay or prevent broadcast were unsuccessful. When the episode aired, the fight scene was more graphic than when originally filmed (in addition to being far more graphic than FCC regulations or network standards allow). At its climax, after SCP-878 presented its knife, it turned to face the camera and spoke several words in Latin (later reported as “Vide opera vestra, vos fortes, et desperatio”) and plunged the knife into the victim's chest. After the shift concluded, rather than the actor never having been born, the actor's past was altered to that of a serial killer. When reports from both sides of the shift were compiled, it was found that the former actor had murdered █ Foundation agents who had been present on the set, as well as ██ relatives of various Foundation personnel SCP-878 had never encountered. This number includes both children of [REDACTED], who never became a Foundation Overseer as a result of the shift. SCP-878 is classified as Euclid due in part to the apparent impossibility of capture as well as this sudden demonstration of power.
