title:Scp 239
**Item #:** SCP-239

**Object Class:** Euclid (Potentially Keter)

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-239 is to be kept within a two room cell furnished with whatever SCP-239 requests as long as they do not violate standard SCP procedure. Under no circumstances is SCP-239 allowed to leave her containment area at any given time. Only class-2 personnel with certified degrees in child psychology are allowed any verbal contact with SCP-239 at any time.  All personnel guarding SCP-239 are to be equipped with low dosage tranquilizer guns (vaccine should be made of [[[SCP-148]]]. SCP-239 is to be educated in a manner identical to that of a normal child. SCP-239 is allowed to stay awake from 0700 hours to 2000 hours (2100 on Fridays).  SCP-239 is to be referred to as her proper name: Sigurrós Stefánsdóttir. Under absolutely no condition should Subject ever be informed that she is not in fact a "witch". Any personnel found giving this information will be immediately terminated. 

**Description:** SCP-239 appears to be an eight year old girl 1 meter in height, and 20 kilograms in weight. Subject has shoulder length blond hair and gray eyes.  There are no visible abnormal physical characteristics. However she seems to emit a previously undiscovered form of radiation, which have been named Kappa Waves.  These waves seem to be harmless in low concentrations but in higher concentrations they could break down matter on a subatomic level.

SCP-239 seemingly has the ability to do whatever she expresses a will to do.  Put quite simply Subject can do anything that she truly wants to do on a basal psychological level as long as she is conscious. Fortunately she only seems to be able to affect herself and her immediate surroundings. Therefore "If she can see it, she can change it." However it would not be the most prudent course of action to try and test how powerful she can be.  She seems to be able to create and affect living matter, for example when a D-class personnel accidentally kicked her, she simply wished him away, and, fortunately, when SCP made her feel guilty for what she had done, she wished him back. SCP-239's self preservation instinct makes her virtually invincible while she is conscious. Subjects skin can not be punctured by anything excepting SCP-148.  

As a method of controlling Subject's ability, she has been told that she is a witch. This, besides improving morale greatly, makes her believe that she is unable to use her abilities outside of a pre-approved list of "spells" given to her by the SCP foundation.  This will hopefully prevent any and all attempted escapes.  However, Subject is to be kept calm at all times to prevent any subconscious wish of harm to herself or others.

**Origin:** SCP-239 came to to the attention of the SCP foundation very soon after her birth in Reykjavík Iceland.  Approximately three hours after subject's birth, the ███████ █████ Hospital was destroyed by an unexplained explosion. The press was informed that it was due to a gas leak. SCP teams were dispatched soon afterwards to search the site for any abnormalities.  The only living person they were able to locate was SCP-239.  For the next eight years Subject was raised under SCP care.

**Note from Dr. Ishimura Dated 12/26/04:** //Who the hell thought it would be a good idea to tell her about "Santa Clause" and then subsequently tell her that it was just a story?! Now we have another potential SCP to deal with, but we can't catch him because he is "magic".//
