**Item #:** SCP-3243

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** An area of the Florida Everglades National Wildlife Refuge has been purchased by the Foundation, under the guise of a private philanthropist-funded conservation effort. A research cabin has been established in the area most frequently visited by SCP-3243 and is currently staffed by three research personnel and one containment specialist with experience in botany or invertebrate biology. This cabin is to receive monthly allotments of supplies from nearby Foundation sites.

The research staff is to conduct various experiments on water and air quality, as well as compile indexes of plant population and health to aid in conservation efforts. Reports of these experiments are to be made available to any local inquirers who happen to encounter Foundation personnel elsewhere in the Wildlife Refuge and express interest in the private activity occurring. Any trespassers on the Foundation-held land are to be turned away under the guise of maintaining the delicate natural ecosystem and scientific conditions of the area. 

Research personnel[[footnote]]The current primary contact for the SCP-3243 case is Dr. Hunter Miles, Cryptozoology dept.[[/footnote]] are to meet with SCP-3243 twice weekly, and carefully document all interactions with the entity. Field cameras have been installed in nearby trees to monitor the entity's location. Requests may be made weekly for additional materials to aid in SCP-3243 containment, including fertilizers, plant seeds, saplings, and curriculum to teach reading. 

Care is to be taken to avoid inadvertently stepping on SCP-3243-1 instances.

**Description:** SCP-3243 appears to be a genetically-unique member of the species //Limax Maximus// (great grey slug), measuring 3 meters long and 1 meter wide. SCP-3243 possesses two 1-meter-long forearm-like appendages, terminating in hands with two fingers and opposable thumbs, which allows it to communicate in rudimentary sign language. SCP-3243 has two black eyes on its eyestalks, both of which are 5 centimeters in diameter. The coloring of SCP-3243 resembles that of its apparent species, consisting of a gray skin tone mottled with brown and cream spots on the stomach which allow for camouflage. 

SCP-3243 currently resides near the Shark River area of the Florida Everglades. SCP-3243 has demonstrated an extensive knowledge of medicine-making utilizing natural ingredients, as well as familiarity with various aspects of wilderness survival; this has been observed in SCP-3243's interactions with civilians (often those involved in boating or swimming accidents) prior to Foundation intervention. SCP-3243 generally exhibits a placid demeanor and seems to regard humans with curiosity, often floating in the water and trailing scientific research and conservationist vessels from a distance when they pass. Possibly due to its physical shape, SCP-3243 rarely travels more than 30 meters from its usual resting spot in an average day. 

The skin on SCP-3243's back is almost entirely covered with a layer of moss and greenery measuring 6 centimeters at thickest. The entity is believed to carry a complex miniature plant-focused ecosystem on its body; various species of grasses, ferns, and reeds have been identified from samples[[footnote]]Of note, some of the plant species observed on SCP-3243 are variants of ferns and orchids believed to have gone extinct in the recent decade.[[/footnote]]. SCP-3243 has been observed to additionally carry decomposers upon itself as well: as dead plant matter accumulates, various mushroom species will manifest. 

When this occurs, the decomposing plant matter will sometimes animate, forming autonomous simple humanoid figures which fulfill roles as caretakers or servants for SCP-3243. These miniature anomalous entities are classified as SCP-3243-1, and possess no identifiable features aside from their varied plant base composition. Each SCP-3243-1 instance has been noted to possess a mushroom cap atop its head.

SCP-3243-1 appear to have a limited lifespan, and will perform tasks such as redistributing slime on SCP-3243, cleaning its eyes, tending to the plants on SCP-3243's back, and pulling weeds and removing other pest species. SCP-3243-1 instances also engage in a primitive "surveillance", leaving SCP-3243 for periods of time and returning, upon which they will provide a report to SCP-3243 through pantomime and a form of sign language that SCP-3243 is believed to have invented by itself. //[Note: SCP-3243 has demonstrated the action of giving names to each of its active instances of SCP-3243-1 by assigning a specific hand sign to each instance. SCP-3243 has additionally shown preference to give certain tasks to certain SCP-3243-1 instances.]// 

> **Background Information and Incident Report:**
> 
> The first documented sighting of SCP-3243 occurred on July 23, 1994, involving locals describing a "giant swimming garden" in the Everglades fending off an alligator to allow a young child to escape to safety. Within weeks of the first sighting, expeditions led by the grateful family and curious acquaintances led to the consideration of SCP-3243 as a local legend. Repeated civilian attempts to locate SCP-3243 remained inconclusive, and eventually its existence became known as a guarded secret, with community reverence for the supposed "monster" becoming an unremarkable normality.
> 
> During this time, the Foundation was made aware of SCP-3243's alleged existence, but did not initiate any surveillance or recovery attempts until an incident occurred on August 4th, 2009, involving SCP-3243 directly interacting with a civilian. During the event, two individuals, locals of the area, were engaged in barefoot waterskiing when their boat's engine failed. The waterskier, ████ ██████ (age 19), had accelerated beyond the boat and whiplash caused his arm to dislocate. Upon making contact with the shallow water, ██████ suffered a fractured left tibia. He was then thrown far enough that his companion, ██████ █████████ (age 56) was unable to locate him. 
> 
> Several minutes later, SCP-3243 is reported to have encountered ████ ██████, and then carried the unconscious individual on its back to his companion's boat. ██████ █████████ then quickly returned his companion to the mainland to seek medical attention[[footnote]]Per medical records, ████ ██████ had stated he did not feel any pain upon arriving initially arriving at the hospital, despite his injuries. Hospital staff were not able to determine the cause for this. Mr. ██████ later made a full recovery.[[/footnote]], reporting the sighting to local law enforcement, prompting further Foundation investigation. After three months of scouting, Foundation operatives located SCP-3243 and began preparations to establish containment. 

**Addendum SCP-3243-1:** When contact with SCP-3243 was first established, Dr. Hunter Miles (assigned to the case as of 04/09/2010) had begun attempting to approach SCP-3243 via airboat by following SCP-3243-1 instances congregating nearby. SCP-3243 exhibited a familiarity with common hand signals used by waterskiers, using its appendages to form the "I'm okay" and "stop" signs in response to questions in the yes/no format. Over the course of the following conversation, Dr. Miles was able to determine that SCP-3243 appeared to possess a high level of intelligence and comprehension, and associated humans with the recent conservation efforts occurring throughout the Everglades area.

Prior to Dr. Miles returning to the cabin to prepare his daily report, SCP-3243 swam closer the airboat and proceeded to point at Dr. Miles's ID badge, the lettering on the side of the boat, and then itself in succession. After additional conversation, Dr. Miles interpreted this as a request to be taught how to read, and promised SCP-3243 he would return. 

**Addendum SCP-3243-2:** As of 12/26/2013, SCP-3243 has shown significantly rapid development in reading comprehension and has begun to request writing implements from Dr. Miles. The Foundation has since provided a set of eco-friendly writing pads and styluses for SCP-3243, which it currently stores on its back.

In a recent meeting with SCP-3243, Dr. Miles was presented with a garment made of woven reeds, resembling a life vest. When asked what the purpose of the item was, SCP-3243 gestured to Dr. Miles's ID card, and then proceeded to write the word "protect" on its writing pad.

Analysis of the garment has identified an anomalous effect incorporated into the woven pattern of the reeds (though the organic material of the item seems non-anomalous). Further testing has indicated that the vest is resistant to rot, lightweight as well as buoyant in water, and possibly bulletproof. Further investigation of the weaving pattern and whether it can be replicated for Foundation use has begun. 

It has been noted that when Dr. Miles indicated interest in learning from SCP-3243 how to make the vests to "protect his friends", SCP-3243 immediately exhibited excitement. It then instructed SCP-3243-1 instances to begin removing reeds from its back to demonstrate the construction of a preliminary woven pattern.

Site Director Shenberger has approved Dr. Miles's request to wear the vest during every subsequent visit to SCP-3243 as a show of good faith and respect.

Author post notes: I would like to say a kind thank you to Zyn for helping me fully realize and publish this! The ideas put forward and the help given on the magnificent containment procedures and addenda helped bring this whole wholesome thing together! 

Thanks as well to TheManhattenProject! His help in finding the image, (which is a derivative work I produced from a free stock image licensed under the CC0 Public Domain License) was a great help!

**Zyn:** Here we goooooooooooo nananananana so do you want to start with the description? That way, I can write the containment procedures when you have the creature's properties down. And then we can both get the addendum together.

**Bardeenboi:** HERRRRREEE WE GOOOOOOOOOO so yeah I'll get those done with the incident and the descriptions

**Zyn:** Okay, I'm going through making edits and trimming some stuff out. I took out some of the details of the slug's appearance/body so it doesn't feel like a monster manual entry, and I trimmed out some other bits so the audience isn't overwhelmed with too many details:

//These "servants" are shown to be incapable of individual thought, and at any given moment, in the event that SCP-XXXX snaps its fingers or claps its hands, each servant will pay full attention regardless of whatever position it happened to be in. The only personal activity witnessed by the servants appeared to be cooperation with other servants to accomplish a task given by SCP-XXXX.//

[[tab Notes]]
maybe have it grow some like reeds and things so when it lies down it just looks like a patch of regular plants or something then the gators will leave it alone and the humans

23:36	Zyn	thought: have it be like... the benevolent swamp-looker-outer or something
23:37	Zyn	everglades water is shallow as heck
23:37	Zyn	if you tried to cannonball into it you'd break bones
23:37	Zyn	also there's gators and snakes everywhere
23:37	Zyn	maybe it sort of floats around in one of the protected areas
23:37	Zyn	and keeps the gators away
23:37	Zyn	it likes people because they keep the water clean

23:38	Zyn	people start telling stories about seeing it around
23:38	Zyn	keeping the gators away from boats and people with their families
23:38	Zyn	the Foundation goes after it after there's a story of someone hitting the water hard and almost drowning in the shallows after their boat tips over or something?
23:39	Zyn	I personally prefer the idea of them containing it in the wild though
23:40	Bardeen	Maybe the Foundation hears about it saving someone from being attacked by wild animals, and then slugging them to a place to get back to civilization, and then The FOundation comes and protects the area it sits in
23:40	Bardeen	and then they come and try to test what it can do and attempt to communicate with it
23:41	Bardeen	Perhaps an interview in sign language translated?
23:46	Bardeen	So maybe that is the reason for its fondness and willingness to speak and accommodate 

23:50	Zyn	https://www.sea-doo.com/owners/guides-and-information/boating-and-watercraft-glossary.html
23:50	Zyn	https://www.boaterexam.com/safety/safety-common-hand-signals.aspx
23:50	Bardeen	I see isee
23:51	Zyn	wow, people barefoot waterski in the everglades sometimes
23:51	Zyn	that seems ideal for your incident.

23:56	Zyn	I was thinking that the description would describe what the thing is
23:56	Zyn	where it lives
23:56	Zyn	how it interacts with the people/its background of being an urban legend
23:57	Zyn	and end with mentioning how the Foundation first discovered it

23:57	Zyn	the addendum would then have follow-up stuff
23:57	Zyn	like the Foundation trying to communicate with it
23:57	Zyn	and then end with the entity like
23:57	Zyn	using its arms to make a hat or something
23:57	Zyn	and a Foundation agent gestures to it
23:57	Zyn	trying to convey that they want to learn
23:57	Zyn	it gets all excited
23:58	Zyn	picks some reeds, makes a hat
23:58	Zyn	shows the Foundation researcher how to make a hat
23:58	Zyn	and then it takes his badge or something
23:58	Zyn	points at the letters
23:58	Zyn	points at the boat the Foundation researcher drove to get into the swamp
23:58	Zyn	and then the Foundation teaches it how to read while it teaches the Foundation about its little servant thingies
23:59	Zyn	then you establish the entity as a sort of otherworldly nature spirit of wisdom

23:59	Zyn	and maybe end with it trusting the Foundation enough to impart some more secrets
23:59	Zyn	that they can use for containment
