My first skip, [[[SCP-3052|Disturbed]]], was inspired by the works of digital animators David Firth and Don Hertzfeld. Watching characters like Salad Fingers made me think 'what if the Foundation had a living version of that?' It started out as just the stick figure, then expanded into the voices/monsters and the tragic origin. I was incredibly lucky to have been spared the Failed First SCP curse, and this skip in particular is my highest rated, so I'm quite proud.

[[[SCP-1-800-J|SUPPLIES ARE LIMITED]]] started out as a joke centered around the infomercial trope of people fucking up simple, everyday activities, no matter how stupidly easy they are. After some consideration, however, I decided to play it safe and went with a format screw instead, and it paid off quite well. It works best as a joke, but the mystery that stems from the origin of the object itself could potentially lead to something...

[[[SCP-3111|Fingerball]] Was an interesting one. I got the idea from a rather [http://ideagenerator.creativitygames.net interesting] idea generator. From the word 'finger' and a picture of a stick figure with a baseball bat came the idea for this oddity. I pondered a few possibilities before settling on this strange combination. Like my joke, there's some potential for mystery, and possibly a new GOI. What sort of company does Thomas's friend work for, anyhow?
