||||||||~ Initial Report||
||~ Author || Teodor Nordskov ||~ Date || February 08, 1979||
||~ Interest||Low||~ Identifier||Lego MiniThinkers||
||||||||Items were discovered after the sub rosa corporate takeover which was managed under orders from Mr. Carter. Upon review of the company's inventory, the items and their properties were discovered. Previously, Lego A/S had been automatically neutralizing the items via placement in large tubs of water for 1 hour and selling the unremarkable variant. Practice continues due to inexpensive bulk supply and the supplier's insistence on only providing the current version of the items. ||

||||||||~ Memo 01||
||||||||~ 8Y9D5/2X4H7/S89M2 ||
||~ Sender || Anthony Young ||~ Recipient || Teodor Nordskov||
|||||||| Concerning the attempted return of the items by Angelina Baar. _
 _
While her request was denied, I fear that we may have lost one of our more reliable customers. Specifically, she expressed concerns over the actions of the items as time progressed. _
 _
According to her written complaint, she's upset about the items participating in "miniature lynch mobs and general barbarism". I don't think she'll be buying anything else in the foreseeable future - not until this is resolved, at least.||
