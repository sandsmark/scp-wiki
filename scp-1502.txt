**Item #:** SCP-1502

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1502 is kept in a secure object containment locker isolated in a cell. An identical locker is to be positioned next to the containment chamber and fitted with a pressure sensor wired to notify staff when activated.

**Description:** SCP-1502 is a humanoid construct measuring 25cm in height. Its body has been crudely assembled from leather, wire, and bone fragments of unknown sources. The head and upper torso are concealed by a burlap sack fastened with metal wire around the object's waist. Unlike the rest of its body, its arms are mechanical, and have been constructed from surgical steel. The forearms contain an array of tools, including scalpels and a stitching needle, which can be released on folding appendages and locked into place. The left arm also contains a grasping tool which has been hooked to a line of thread running to a spool on its back. The right arm can produce a hypodermic needle which has been connected via plastic tubing to a steel reservoir located underneath the spool of thread.

SCP-1502 possesses a limited teleportation ability, and is capable of relocating itself instantaneously to the interior of the nearest drawer, chest, cabinet, or similar piece of furniture within a range demonstrated to span at least a 100-meter radius and a minimum observed interval between uses of twelve (12) seconds. It uses this property to enter homes and other residential areas during the night, at which point it attempts to locate the nearest human. If successful,[[footnote]] Though SCP-1502 prefers subjects which are asleep, it can, with effort, work upon conscious subjects. [[/footnote]] it uses its syringe to inject the subject with an anesthetic substance of unknown composition that produces numbness, unconsciousness, and paralysis in greater doses. Then it stands nearby (usually on the subject's chest) and performs extensive cosmetic surgery on the subject. 

The procedure includes measures such as the injection of a concentrated solution containing collagenase and elastase into parts of the face, the severing of certain tendons to cause facial skin to droop, and stitching hair from the subject's head over their upper lip. This procedure is intended by SCP-1502 to alter the subject's appearance to resemble William Daniels in his role as "Mr. George Feeny" in the television series //Boy Meets World// [[footnote]]Aired on ABC Television from 1993 to 2000.[[/footnote]] as closely as possible. 

The object does not display any sense of preference among age, ethnicity, gender, or any other factors beyond proximity in its selection of subjects. Once the procedure is complete, it attempts to escape the premises.

SCP-1502's exact motivations in doing this are unknown. Interviews have been inconclusive, as the object communicates through the playback of recordings of actor Rider Strong in his role as the character Shawn Hunter from the aforementioned television series. All documented vocalizations made by SCP-1502 have been attributed to existing episodes of //Boy Meets World//. The source and medium of these recordings is unknown, and they often display degradation in the form of static and pitch distortion. 

**Interview Transcript 1502-1**

> 
> **Foreword:** //This interview was conducted in a standard interview chamber by Researcher Murphy with Security Officer Clarke and Assistant Researcher Bramwell in attendance. SCP-1502 was allowed to move freely on the table. Positioned at each of the four corners of the table was an open cabinet; before questioning began, SCP-1502 attempted twice to teleport away from handlers before becoming cooperative.//

> **Interviewer:** SCP-1502, do you know why you're here?
> 
> **SCP-1502:** //[turns to face security officer]// Did you hear what he called me?
> 
> **Interviewer**: //[repeats the question]//
> 
> **SCP-1502:** Detention! I've been going through a lot of changes lately. I've got nothing to wear.
> 
> **Interviewer:** How do you produce those sounds?
> 
> **SCP-1502:** That's what he's done for me. And I've got a radio face.
> 
> **Interviewer:** "He?"
> 
> **SCP-1502:** Something creepy.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Where were you constructed?
> 
> **SCP-1502:** Back at the center. It was all the things you taught me that made me wonder if it was the right place for me or not. The only signal I sent him was "stop". He just started yelling like a crazy man. //[with severe distortion]// You're just telling me that so I can put you back together again. //[static plays, then normal sound quality resumes]// Did it ever occur to you that I might be a nice girl?
> 
> **Interviewer:** Do you know who you are?
> 
> **SCP-XXX:** Yeah. Virgins. Virgins never die. I'll get as sick as you can get without actually dying. I just wanted to look nice.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Can you explain why you've performed those procedures on people in the area?
> 
> **SCP-1502:** Yeah. They were out there in the real world. We haven't been there much. And you didn't ask to take the test. Feeny did.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Why are you fixated on this Feeny character?
> 
> **SCP-1502:** Feeny. Are you kidding? You, uh, you never give up on me. Never once. I'm not going to forget you. You're the best person I know. I'd take a bullet for you. Not for him. Too much ugly.
> 
> **Interviewer:** //[to Assistant Researcher]// Do you think we can get it to explain anything better this session? //[The assistant shakes his head "no".]// We might want to wrap up for now and follow up later.
> 
> **SCP-1502:** //[faces the assistant researcher]// You're not talking, but I know you're here. Who are we?
> 
> **Assistant Researcher:** I've never seen that thing before.
> 
> **SCP-1502**: Of course not. Come on, you remember. I never asked you for anything before and I never wanted to come to you like this, but... //[unintelligible]// Because I've watched you for so long and I've always dreamed of telling you how I feel about you. I was cute then, huh?
> 
> //[The assistant researcher begins to respond, then shakes his head silently.]//
> 
> **SCP-1502:** Come on, you know we're your favorites. You kind of see where I'm going with this? The killer is one of us.
> 
> **Interviewer:**: Bramwell, do you understand what SCP-1502 is talking about?
> 
> **Assistant Researcher:** I have no idea. This doesn't make any sense.
> 
> **SCP-1502:** It does if you've seen as many horror movies as I have. As a matter of fact... //[unintelligible]// Hey, idiot. I want you to take the test. Oh, yes, yes, yes.
> 
> **Interviewer:** I think it's just being belligerent now. Let's follow up later.
> 
> **SCP-1502:** Do we upset you? That is the least of your problems. You didn't teach me enough. Feeny locked us in.
