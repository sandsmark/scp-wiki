+ DR. MANFRED J. LITTLE

++ LEVEL 3 ● NON-SITE ● GENERAL PRACTITIONER ● AMBASSADOR TO THE MUONIC REALM

------

The most senior physician currently employed by the Foundation, Dr. Manfred Little enjoyed a lengthy career in the public service before being recruited in 1994 as a Site-197 researcher. Specializing in immunology, he was reassigned to be Foundation General Practitioner in 2001 and currently evaluates the health of humanoid anomalies and anomalies containing human-organ analogues at a variety of Sites. Due to the large number of humanoid anomalies contained therein, Dr. Little has provisional offices at Site-88, Site-309, and Site-667.

On March 4, 2009, during the routine treatment of a humanoid anomaly at Site-309, Dr. Little was affected by a poorly-understood memetic agent that causes all documentation referring Dr. Little or his position to refer to him as the "Ambassador to the Muonic Realm". After being removed from active duty for a period of approximately six months, it was determined that the memetic agent had no obvious additional effects on Dr. Little or his performance, and he was reinstated in his previous position. Further interrogation of the humanoid anomaly have revealed no clear connection between it and the memetic agent; and, according to current scientific theory, the instability of muons and the size of subatomic particles means that the establishment of any kind of subatomic infrastructure that would lead to a so-called "Muonic Realm" is infeasible.
