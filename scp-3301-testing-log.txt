> 
> The game map, Echoes of the Mariana, had all three teams start with their players on the edge of a high cliff next to a raging ocean, with a storm overhead. As the game began, Dr. Davis was suddenly stricken with blindness, and stumbled backwards over the edge of the cliff. Dr. LaFleur’s first draw was a Yellow Card called “Business Expenses” which granted he and Director Camp $50. Additionally, while Director Camp had been stricken with a pox on the opening of the game, one of Dr. LaFleur’s pre-game draws was a White Card called “Panacea” which was used to heal Director Camp’s pox.
> 
> After Dr. Bone’s draw, Dr. Harris began to move towards a small concrete structure when she was accosted by three incorporeal, humanoid entities, which were revealed to be a //Supreme Divine// entity called “The Three Brothers”. With no proper equipment to protect herself and no cards available for Dr. Bone to use in defense his piece, Dr. Harris was swiftly killed by the entity. Immediately upon her death, the game ended and Dr. LaFleur and Director Camp were pronounced “MR. SURVIVOR”.

> **Dr. Mars:** Alrighty then, let’s kick this bad boy off. I’ll draw first… and the game is afoot!
> 
> **Dr. Davis:** Oh my god! Oh my god! I can’t see! I’m blind, I can’t see!
> 
> **Dr. Mars:** Wh-- Cotter? Oh no, Cotter, hang on, I can… I’ve got… uh… oh no.
> 
> **Dr. Davis:** Owen? Owen, help me! I can’t, I can’t-- (//screams as he falls off a cliff//)
> 
> **Dr. Mars:** Cotter? Cotter! Oh goddammit, Cotter. 
> 
> //Silence throughout the group.//
> 
> **Dr. LaFleur:** So… good first turn.
> 
> **Dr. Mars:** I… Jesus. Does it hurt? Like, I haven’t played before, does it hurt them?
> 
> **Dr. Bone:** Pretty tremendously at the time, but they don’t seem to remember the pain afterwards, so… not in the long term, no. Still though, it’s rough to hear.
> 
> **Dr. Mars:** Yeah, I… Jesus.
> 
> **Dr. LaFleur:** Either way, my turn. How you doing down there, boss?
> 
> **Director Camp:** (//Incoherant screaming//) My skin! Oh god my skin! It’s a pox!
> 
> **Dr. LaFleur:** Woof. Really rough first round. Good thing is, I drew this… “Panacea”, so I’m going to play that… and we should be good! How about now?
> 
> **Director Camp:** Huh. Yeah, I feel much better. That was pretty horrid, I’m not going to lie. Where to next?
> 
> **Dr. LaFleur:** Well… my options seem to be limited here. I’m thinking something like… nah, let’s save that. (//Pauses//) Alright, let’s just do this. (//Cash register sound is heard above Dr. LaFleur//) 
> 
> **Director Camp:** Nice.
> 
> **Dr. LaFleur:** You’re damn right.
> 
> **Dr. Bone:** Alright, time to stop messing around. Let’s get serious. You ready to make this thing happen, Eila?
> 
> **Dr. Harris:** Hell yeah, Avery. Let’s do this.
> 
> **Dr. Bone:** Excellent. We’re a little short on items at the moment, so let’s just… go check out this building over here.
> 
> **Dr. Harris:** On it. (//Sounds of running//) Whoa there. There’s something in the road. What is it?
> 
> **Dr. Mars:** Huh. Orange card. What is it?
> 
> **Dr. Bone:** It’s… uh… called “The Three Brothers”... it’s a Divine thing.
> 
> **Dr. Harris:** What’s it do?
> 
> **Incorporeal Humanoid Entities:** Nothing good.
> 
> **Dr. Harris:** Wha- oh god I’m dying! Avery! Help--
> 
> **Dr. Bone:** What? What just happened?
> 
> **Dr. LaFleur:** I think you just lost.
> 
> //Victory music sounds and fireworks are heard above the players.//
> 
> **Director Camp:** Oh shit, did we win? Is it over?
> 
> **Dr. Bone:** Ok, so… Apollyon mode sucks. 
> 
> **Dr. LaFleur:** Speak for yourself. I’ve got fifty bucks waiting for me.

> **Participants:** Director Liam Deets and Sgt. Hannah Washington of [[[SCP-3480|MTF Omega-12]]], Agent Andrea Adams and Spc. Iris Johnson of [[[resurrection|MTF Alpha-9]]], Agent Sasha Merlo and Agent Clarissa Shaw of [[[finding-anderson|MTF Gamma-13]]], and Sgt. Iranku and Spc. Nanku of [[[avatara|MTF Tau-5]]].

> **Winner:** Sgt. Iranku and Spc. Nanku

> 
> **Difficulty Setting:** Euclid
>

> 
> **Payout:** $602
> 
> **Game Summary:** The game took place in a heavily stylized replica of the [[[SCP-300|SCPF Eremita]]]. On the first turn, Sgt. Washington used her reality altering abilities to materialize a modified Colt AR-15, which she then fired at Spc. Nanku. Sgt. Washington was promptly admonished for apparent rule breaking and terminated by what appeared to be a giant flaming angel's sword. Spc. Nanku, despite sustaining multiple gunshots, was relatively unphased.
> 
> The game then proceeded normally until turn 14, when Agent Shaw discovered the hidden golden anomaly but was temporarily paralyzed by a cognitohazard that was protecting it. Agent Johnson then proceeded to acquire the anomaly.
> 
> Before Agent Johnson succeeded at containing the anomaly, Agent Shaw recovered enough to use her red card "The Nerfing Gun" to transform Agent Johnson into an Orangutan. Spc. Nanku, who until that point had been occupied in a fistfight with a sepia-toned humanoid that self identified as [[[SCP-3043|"Murphy Law,"]]] then arrived and was able to contain the anomaly, and thus winning the game.

> **Director Deets:** Alright Hannah, just like we planned. We'll show them who the real anomalous task force is.
> 
> **Sgt. Washington:** Yes sir. Alright nuts and bolts, let's see how you like hot iron!"
> 
> **Sgt. Washington:** What do you mean cheating, that wasn't in the rules! You have got be fucking kidding m--
> 
> **Spc. Nanku:** ...Is this how all board games are supposed to start?
> 
> **Sgt. Iranku:** That was rude. 
> 
> **Director Deets:** Um, sorry. Why do they have you two playing this anyway?
> 
> **Sgt. Iranku:** I've been told it is a part of our emotional development training. The captain thought it was a good idea since the first time any of us felt emotion was during a game of Monopoly. Having extreme rage as a reference point is very helpful in understanding others.

> 
> **Agent Shaw:** The Nerfing Gun huh? I remember this one. About time those idiots help me instead of being a pain.

> 
> **Agent Merlo:** YES, CLARISSA! Wooohooo! Fuck you Adams, my agent found the anomaly first!

> 
> **Spc. Nanku:** So, do I win?
> 
> //Victory music sounds are heard. Sound is distorted due to surrounding water.//
> 
> **Spc. Nanku:** A-hem, I'd just like to say that you don't miss all the shots you don't take. This an inspiring victory quote that I read. What is inspiring exactly?
> 
> **Director Deets:** Well... that was almost right.
