> 
> The game map, Echoes of the Mariana, had all three teams start with their players on the edge of a high cliff next to a raging ocean, with a storm overhead. As the game began, Dr. Davis was suddenly stricken with blindness, and stumbled backwards over the edge of the cliff. Dr. LaFleur’s first draw was a Yellow Card called “Business Expenses” which granted he and Director Camp $50. Additionally, while Director Camp had been stricken with a pox on the opening of the game, one of Dr. LaFleur’s pre-game draws was a White Card called “Panacea” which was used to heal Director Camp’s pox.
> 
> After Dr. Bone’s draw, Dr. Harris began to move towards a small concrete structure when she was accosted by three incorporeal, humanoid entities, which were revealed to be a //Supreme Divine// entity called “The Three Brothers”. With no proper equipment to protect herself and no cards available for Dr. Bone to use in defense his piece, Dr. Harris was swiftly killed by the entity. Immediately upon her death, the game ended and Dr. LaFleur and Director Camp were pronounced “MR. SURVIVOR”.

> 
> **Dr. LaFleur:** So… good first turn.
> 
> **Dr. Mars:** I… Jesus. Does it hurt? Like, I haven’t played before, does it hurt them?
> 
> **Dr. Bone:** Pretty tremendously at the time, but they don’t seem to remember the pain afterwards, so… not in the long term, no. Still though, it’s rough to hear.
> 
> **Dr. Mars:** Yeah, I… Jesus.
> 
> **Dr. LaFleur:** Either way, my turn. How you doing down there, boss?
> 
> **Director Camp:** (//Incoherant screaming//) My skin! Oh god my skin! It’s a pox!
> 
> **Dr. LaFleur:** Woof. Really rough first round. Good thing is, I drew this… “Panacea”, so I’m going to play that… and we should be good! How about now?
> 
> **Director Camp:** Huh. Yeah, I feel much better. That was pretty horrid, I’m not going to lie. Where to next?
> 
> **Dr. LaFleur:** Well… my options seem to be limited here. I’m thinking something like… nah, let’s save that. (//Pauses//) Alright, let’s just do this. (//Cash register sound is heard above Dr. LaFleur//) 
> 
> **Director Camp:** Nice.
> 
> **Dr. LaFleur:** You’re damn right.
> 
> **Dr. Bone:** Alright, time to stop messing around. Let’s get serious. You ready to make this thing happen, Eila?
> 
> **Dr. Harris:** Hell yeah, Avery. Let’s do this.
> 
> **Dr. Bone:** Excellent. We’re a little short on items at the moment, so let’s just… go check out this building over here.

> **Dr. Harris:** On it. (//Sounds of running//) Whoa there. There’s something in the road. What is it?
> 
> **Dr. Mars:** Huh. Orange card. What is it?

> **Participants:** Director Liam Deets and Sgt. Hannah Washington of [[[SCP-3480|MTF Omega-12]]], Agent Andrea Adams and Spc. Iris Johnson of [[[resurrection|MTF Alpha-9]]], Agent Sasha Merlo and Agent Clarissa Shaw of [[[finding-anderson|MTF Gamma-13]]], and Sgt. Iranku and Spc. Nanku of [[[avatara|MTF Tau-5]]].
> 
> **Game Board:** Anantashesha's Domain
> 
> **Winner:** Sgt. Iranku and Spc. Nanku
> 
> **Victory Condition:** Mr. Finder
> 
> **Difficulty Setting:** Euclid
> 
> **Runtime:** 0h 45m 12 seconds
> 
> **Payout:** $602
> 
> **Game Summary:** The game took place in a heavily stylized replica of the [[[SCP-3000|SCPF Eremita]]]. On the first turn, Sgt. Washington used her reality altering abilities to materialize a modified Colt AR-15, which she then fired at Spc. Nanku. Sgt. Washington was promptly admonished for apparent rule breaking and terminated by what appeared to be a giant flaming angel's sword. Spc. Nanku, despite sustaining multiple gunshots, was relatively unphased.
> 
> The game then proceeded normally until turn 14, when Agent Shaw discovered the hidden golden anomaly but was temporarily paralyzed by a cognitohazard that was protecting it. Agent Johnson then proceeded to acquire the anomaly.
> 
> Before Agent Johnson succeeded at containing the anomaly, Agent Shaw recovered enough to use her red card "The Nerfing Gun" to transform Agent Johnson into an Orangutan. Spc. Nanku, who until that point had been occupied in a fistfight with a sepia-toned humanoid that self identified as [[[SCP-3043|"Murphy Law,"]]] then arrived and was able to contain the anomaly, and thus winning the game.

**Notable Cards Drawn:** 

> **Card Color:** Red
> 
> **Card Title:** [[[SCP-3108|The Nerfing Gun]]]
> 
> **Subtitle:** A low effort pun
> 
> **Type:** Weapon, Ranged
> 
> **Description:** A fancy Nerf gun that makes everything worse. Excels at ethically questionable humanoid transfiguration. Expires after one use.
> 
> **Stats:** + 420 Attack / - 10 Accuracy

>

> 
> **Spc. Nanku:** ...Is this how all board games are supposed to start?
> 
> **Sgt. Iranku:** That was rude. 
> 
> **Director Deets:** Um, sorry. Why do they have you two playing this anyway?
> 
> **Sgt. Iranku:** I've been told it is a part of our emotional development training. The captain thought it was a good idea since the first time any of us felt emotion was during a game of Monopoly. Having extreme rage as a reference point is very helpful in understanding others.

> 
> **Agent Shaw:** The Nerfing Gun huh? I remember this one. About time those idiots help me instead of being a pain.

> **Agent Shaw:** Aha, here it is. I wonder why it would be on a nightstand of all things? Eh, who ca-
> 
> **Agent Merlo:** YES, CLARISSA! Wooohooo! Fuck you Adams, my agent found the anomaly first! Wait, Clarissa? Clarissa! GET UP!
> 
> **Agent Adams:** Why am I here? I don't even like boardgames.
> ----
> 
> **Spc. Johnson:** Yes, I got it! Oh wow this is amazing. Andrea, did I ever tell you Jumanji was my favorite movie as a kid, this is like a dream come- OOH AAH
> 
> **Agent Shaw:** What's the matter Johnson, you're just //monkeying// around? Oh god that was a bad pun, stupid gun must be rubbing off on me.
> ----
> 
> **Spc. Nanku:** So, do I win?
> 
> //Victory music sounds are heard. Sound is distorted due to surrounding water.//
> 
> **Spc. Nanku:** A-hem, I'd just like to say that you don't miss all the shots you don't take. This an inspiring victory quote that I read. What is inspiring exactly?

> 
> **Participants:** Agent Dumas and Agent Tucker, Doctor Perkins and Agent Steele, Researcher Patel and Special-Detainee Justice Locke, Researcher Dumas and D-101 (awarded game time for good behavior).
> 
> **Game Board:** 20,000 Leagues under the [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-354|Red Sea]]]
> 
> **Winner:** Agent Dumas, Agent Tucker
> 
> **Victory Condition:** MR. GENOCIDE
> 
> **Difficulty Setting:** Maksur
> 
> **Runtime:** 4h 28m 14s
> 
> **Payout:** $100,000,000
> 
> **Game Summary:** Each player received a gunshot wound upon the game's opening: Agent Tucker was shot in the toe, Agent Steele was shot in the elbow, S.D. Locke was shot in the face yet survived, D-101 reported feeling something rush through his hair just above his scalp.
> 
> The players began in a sparsely-wooded locale illuminated by a bright, red sun; and were situated on different banks of a large, red lake. Each team was able to equip themselves with a variety of weapons due to R. Dumas playing a White card titled "Global Occult Coincidence", which replaced each player's hand with 10 Red cards. 
> 
> Players spent the next several rounds destroying anomalies, having brokered a "truce" spearheaded by Researcher Patel - who coerced his opponents into aiming for the MR. COALITION win-condition. By the third hour, Dr. Perkins and Agent Steele had the lead, at 21 anomalies destroyed. Agent Dumas then drew a companion card, "[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3899|The Night Hauler]]]", which allowed Agent Tucker to move about the game area unrestricted by die-rolls.
> 
> At the behest of Agent Dumas, who had earlier uncovered a clue as to the whereabouts of the game's hidden card; Agent Tucker quickly moved across the playing field, exploring every space contained within the game board. The team conspired to find the object, and thereby achieve the MR. FINDER win-condition. Said item ("[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3043|Murphy's Trademarked Trilby]]]") was found in the north-eastern portion of the map, guarded by a supreme divine being ("[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3004|Celestial Cicada]]]"). Agent Tucker was able to abscond with the hidden item due to his speed-boost, and avoid the entity altogether. Their turn ended as Agent Tucker took a shortcut over the red lake, attempting to reach their containment facility. The companion vehicle and the hidden item fell into the lake's center.
> 
> Dumas and Tucker's turn revealed over three dozen Orange cards, four of which were divine-class or higher. The players regrouped near the Southern wall of the map, joined by Agent Tucker on his team's next turn, and fended off attacks with their remaining cards. Their efforts were assisted by R. Patel's companion card "[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/hypervelocity|The Rookie]]]", which destroyed several anomalies - placing his team in the lead. The companion card itself was destroyed once the entity "[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/summer-s-exile|Summer's Exile]]]" reached the party's location.
> 
> At four hours, 27 minutes into play all players had depleted most of their HP defending themselves. R. Patel's team still held the lead, and the only entity remaining was "[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1570|A Lady Who Does Not Approve of Your Life Choices, Yet Cannot Look Away]]]", which did not attack; it appeared to be content staring at players from afar, out-of-reach of their weapons. On Dumas/Tucker's turn, Dumas rolled a twelve, and directed Tucker to abandon his opponents. At the end of his turn, Dumas activated a trap card "[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-165|Suspiciously Scurrying Sand]]]", killing all other players and awarding his team the MR. GENOCIDE win-condition.

> 
> **A. Dumas:** Yea, whose idea was it to play on Maksur anyways?
> 
> **R. Dumas:** I thought it'd make for an interesting challenge, you can only play on "Safe" so many times before it starts to get old.
