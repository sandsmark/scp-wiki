> **Game Summary:** In the shortest run of SCP-3301 thus far, Dr. Avery Bone and Dr. Owen Mars of the SCP-3301 research team ran the first test thus far of the “Apollyon[[footnote]]The meaning of this and the Maksur difficulty is unknown, as neither are officially registered object classes.[[/footnote]]” difficulty setting. 
> 
> The game map, Echoes of the Mariana, had all three teams start with their players on the edge of a high cliff next to a raging ocean, with a storm overhead. As the game began, Dr. Davis was suddenly stricken with blindness, and stumbled backwards over the edge of the cliff. Dr. LaFleur’s first draw was a Yellow Card called “Business Expenses” which granted he and Director Camp $50. Additionally, while Director Camp had been stricken with a pox on the opening of the game, one of Dr. LaFleur’s pre-game draws was a White Card called “Panacea” which was used to heal Director Camp’s pox.
> 
> After Dr. Bone’s draw, Dr. Harris began to move towards a small concrete structure when she was accosted by three incorporeal, humanoid entities, which were revealed to be a //Supreme Divine// entity called “The Three Brothers”. With no proper equipment to protect herself and no cards available for Dr. Bone to use in defense his piece, Dr. Harris was swiftly killed by the entity. Immediately upon her death, the game ended and Dr. LaFleur and Director Camp were pronounced “MR. SURVIVOR”.

> **Dr. LaFleur:** So… good first turn.
> 
> **Dr. Mars:** I… Jesus. Does it hurt? Like, I haven’t played before, does it hurt them?
> 
> **Dr. Bone:** Pretty tremendously at the time, but they don’t seem to remember the pain afterwards, so… not in the long term, no. Still though, it’s rough to hear.

> 
> **Director Camp:** Huh. Yeah, I feel much better. That was pretty horrid, I’m not going to lie. Where to next?

> **Participants:** Director Liam Deets and Sgt. Hannah Washington of [[[SCP-3480|MTF Omega-12]]], Agent Andrea Adams and Spc. Iris Thompson of [[[resurrection|MTF Alpha-9]]], Agent Sasha Merlo and Agent Clarissa Shaw of [[[finding-anderson|MTF Gamma-13]]], and Sgt. Irantu and Spc. Nanku of [[[avatara|MTF Tau-5]]].

> 
> **Winner:** Sgt. Irantu and Spc. Nanku
> 
> **Victory Condition:** Mr. Finder
> 
> **Difficulty Setting:** Euclid
> 
> **Runtime:** 0h 45m 12 seconds
> 
> **Payout:** $602
> 
> **Game Summary:** The game took place in a heavily stylized replica of the [[[SCP-3000|SCPF Eremita]]]. On the first turn, Sgt. Washington used her reality altering abilities to materialize a modified Colt AR-15, which she then fired at Spc. Nanku. Sgt. Washington was promptly admonished for apparent rule breaking and terminated by what appeared to be a giant flaming angel's sword. Spc. Nanku, despite sustaining multiple gunshots, was relatively unphased.
> 
> The game then proceeded normally until turn 14, when Agent Shaw discovered the hidden golden anomaly but was temporarily paralyzed by a cognitohazard that was protecting it. Spc. Thompson then proceeded to acquire the anomaly.
> 
> Before Spc. Thompson succeeded at containing the anomaly, Agent Shaw recovered enough to use her red card "The Nerfing Gun" to transform Spc. Thompson into an Orangutan. Spc. Nanku, who until that point had been occupied in a fistfight with a sepia-toned humanoid that self identified as [[[SCP-3043|"Murphy Law,"]]] then arrived and was able to contain the anomaly, and thus winning the game.

> 
> **Difficulty Setting:** Maksur
> 
> **Runtime:** 4h 28m 14s
> 
> **Payout:** $100,000,000
> 
> **Game Summary:** Each player received a gunshot wound upon the game's opening: Agent Tucker was shot in the toe, Agent Steele was shot in the elbow, S.D. Locke was shot in the face yet survived, D-101 reported feeling something rush through his hair just above his scalp.
> 
> The players began in a sparsely-wooded locale illuminated by a bright, red sun; and were situated on different banks of a large, red lake. Each team was able to equip themselves with a variety of weapons due to R. Dumas playing a White card titled "Global Occult Coincidence", which replaced each player's hand with 10 Red cards. 
> 
> Players spent the next several rounds destroying anomalies, having brokered a "truce" spearheaded by Researcher Patel - who coerced his opponents into aiming for the MR. COALITION win-condition. By the third hour, Dr. Perkins and Agent Steele had the lead, at 21 anomalies destroyed. Agent Dumas then drew a companion card, "[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3899|The Night Hauler]]]", which allowed Agent Tucker to move about the game area unrestricted by die-rolls.
> 
> At the behest of Agent Dumas, who had earlier uncovered a clue as to the whereabouts of the game's hidden card; Agent Tucker quickly moved across the playing field, exploring every space contained within the game board. The team conspired to find the object, and thereby achieve the MR. FINDER win-condition. Said item ("[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3043|Murphy's Trademarked Trilby]]]") was found in the north-eastern portion of the map, guarded by a supreme divine being ("[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3004|Celestial Cicada]]]"). Agent Tucker was able to abscond with the hidden item due to his speed-boost, and avoid the entity altogether. Their turn ended as Agent Tucker took a shortcut over the red lake, attempting to reach their containment facility. The companion vehicle and the hidden item fell into the lake's center.
> 
> Dumas and Tucker's turn revealed over three dozen Orange cards, four of which were divine-class or higher. The players regrouped near the Southern wall of the map, joined by Agent Tucker on his team's next turn, and fended off attacks with their remaining cards. Their efforts were assisted by R. Patel's companion card "[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/hypervelocity|The Rookie]]]", which destroyed several anomalies - placing his team in the lead. The companion card itself was destroyed once the entity "[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/summer-s-exile|Summer's Exile]]]" reached the party's location.
> 
> At four hours, 27 minutes into play all players had depleted most of their HP defending themselves. R. Patel's team still held the lead, and the only entity remaining was "[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1570|A Lady Who Does Not Approve of Your Life Choices, Yet Cannot Look Away]]]", which did not attack; it appeared to be content staring at players from afar, out-of-reach of their weapons. On Dumas/Tucker's turn, Dumas rolled a twelve, and directed Tucker to abandon his opponents. At the end of his turn, Dumas activated a trap card "[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-165|Suspiciously Scurrying Sand]]]", killing all other players and awarding his team the MR. GENOCIDE win-condition.

> 
> **A. Dumas:** Yea, whose idea was it to play on Maksur anyways?
> 
> **R. Dumas:** I thought it'd make for an interesting challenge, you can only play on "Safe" so many times before it starts to get old.

> 
> **Game Summary:** The game was set within the Mare Imbrium crater, with an unmanned facility located in the approximate centre of the map. Each player's "containment facility" featured an underground portion with a high-speed rail tunnel connecting to the central facility; they were otherwise wholly independent from each-other. 
> 
> At the start of the game, a flare of light occurred on the board and a ten-minute countdown appeared above the primary players; secondary players reported that the sun was undergoing a supernova event. All secondary players reported impediment or ailment: Agent Arch and Agent Quinzeen reported blindness; Cpl. Winston and Agent (D.) Kadowski reported [[[SCP-008 | flu symptoms and severe fever]]]; Agent Karlyle reported [[[https://web.archive.org/web/20170616194145/http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2684 | nausea, internal pain and difficulty moving]]]; D-93017 reported all symptoms.
> 
> Researcher Pentach equipped D-93017 with the Blue Card "████ ███", manifesting a human male with no apparent in-game function; the entity was amnesic and was mostly unaware of the game in progress. Researcher Pentach directs D-93017 towards the underground rail tunnel; D-93017, impeded by blindness and severe fever, repeatedly ignored directions and travelled in incorrect directions. At the end of the turn, Researcher Pentach drew the Black Card [[[SCP-2271 | "Eternal Interest"]]], forcing him to discard one card every turn or D-93017 would be automatically killed. (Time remaining: 9m 27s.)
> 
> Sgt. (S.) Kadowski used the Yellow Card [[[SCP-2630 | "Never Overestimate The Use of SCPs"]]], to grant his team $500. Cpl. Winston was then instructed to find a spacesuit before Sgt. (S.) Kadowski drew to end his turn. (Time remaining: 9m 20s.)
> 
> Agent Samson equipped Agent Karlyle with the Red Card "Rayman's Laygun", then directed them to the medical wing of their facility. Agent Samson drew the Black Card [[[SCP-2821 | "Chaos Hole"]]] at the end of their turn, permanently disabling their high-speed rail. (Time remaining: 9m 11s.)
> 
> Agent Peterson equipped Agent Quinzeen with the Red Card [[[SCP-2493 | "Anti-matterman's Perfecto-suit"]]], enabling them to traverse the lunar surface. Agent Quinzeen's training with cognitohazards assisted them in navigating despite blindness, and they reach the surface exit. Agent Peterson draws the Black Card "Neutralised", expending "Anti-matterman's Perfecto-suit".
> 
> Agent Chang instructed Agent Arch to find supplies; impeded by blindness, they encountered the Supreme Divine Orange Card [[[SCP-3125 | "Mysterious Mega-Malicious Meta-Meme"]]], which immediately killed them. (Time remaining: 9m 05s.)
> 
> Sgt. Wyte equipped Agent (D.) Kadowski with the Red Card "Night Vision Goggles". Agent (D.) Kadowski discovered and equipped themselves with the Red Card "Spacesuit", enabling them to traverse the lunar surface. Sgt. Wyte then drew the Purple Card [[[SCP-REDD | "Mr. Redd O. P. Discontinued C. P."]]], which attacked and killed Agent (D.) Kadowski. (Time remaining: 8m 54s.)
> 
> Researcher Pentach equipped D-93017 with the Red Card "Map Map", enabling them to see (but not identify) all active cards on the map. An Orange Card — assumed to be the second Supreme Divine entity spawned on the fourth turn — was seen navigating towards D-93017. Researcher Pentach directed D-93017 to the high-speed rail, but D-93017 again failed to follow instructions.
> 
> At this point, Researcher Pentach attempted to cheat by introducing a foreign card — "Pot of Greed", from the Yu-Gi-Oh card game — to the game. SCP-3301 accepted the card, dispensing two cards; both cards were copies of the Black Card "Pot of Weed", forcing Researcher Pentach to immediately draw two more cards for each. All four drawn cards were additional copies of "Pot of Weed"; all cards that Researcher Pentach drew using "Pot of Weed" were, invariably, additional copies of "Pot of Weed".
> 
> Researcher Pentach's behaviour rapidly degraded in a manner indicative of a psychoactive drug overdose; upon reaching 256 copies of "Pot of Weed", Researcher Pentach became incapable of any further action, apparently lapsing into a vegetative state.[[footnote]]As "Pot of Weed" has not been encountered outside this event, it is unknown if this was an intentional function of the game or not.[[/footnote]] Other players were unable to execute any tasks, as Researcher Pentach had been unable to end their turn.

> Once the timer reached zero, the entire map — and all items and players on it — was simultaneously vaporised, ending the game with no victor and no payout.

> **Game Board:** Appleseeds
> 
> **Winner:** Dr. King and D-93017
> 
> **Victory Condition:** [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/interval-2 | Mr. Appleseeds]]]
> 
> **Difficulty Setting:** Safe[[footnote]]Despite being set to Safe, the game functioned more akin to Neutralized; all exposed blood was replaced with an equal volume of apple seeds, and no functional anomalies were encountered.[[/footnote]]
> 
> **Runtime:** 75h 43m 29 seconds 
> 
> **Payout:** 400,000 appleseeds
> 
> **Game Summary:**
> 
> Map was a flat, featureless plane comprised entirely of appleseeds; only the top ten centimetres of appleseeds were loose, with the remainder compacted into a solid surface.
> 
> All cards in both player's hands are variously coloured copies of "Appleseed".
> 
> Dr. King uses a Green Card "Appleseed." A single appleseed manifests in the air next to D-93017. D-93017 begins searching the map; Dr. King draws a Black Card "Appleseed", manifesting another single appleseed next to D-93017.
> 
> Researcher John equips D-85493 with a Blue Card "Appleseed"; a single appleseed manifests in D-85493's hand. Researcher John draws a Red Card "Appleseed".
> 
> No remarkable events occurred for the following seventy-five consecutive hours, as all cards drawn and encountered on the map were universally colour variants of "Appleseed"; although Researcher John and Dr. King could identify map tiles containing Orange or Purple "Appleseed" cards, D-93017 and D-85493 were unable to distinguish their in-game appearance from other loose apple seeds.
> 
> The game abruptly ended when Dr. King equipped D-93017 with a Red Card "Appleseed", thereby filling all available slots with various copies of "Appleseed" and achieving the previously unknown "Mr. Appleseed" victory condition. The room SCP-3301 was used in was progressively filled with an estimated 400,000 apple seeds following the conclusion of the game.

> 
> **Game Summary:** This iteration was notable for including several anomalies not known to the Foundation. It is unclear whether these were generated for the game, or whether equivalent real-world anomalies are currently undiscovered or may arise in future. 
> 
> Each team started the game within an underground Foundation facility. Within moments, a containment breach alarm sounded, and all teams were chased by a large humanoid and an aggressive canid entity.  Agent Candle retreated behind a bulkhead, closing it behind him and locking out the other players, who continued to flee. 
> 
> At the suggestion of AIC-Glacon, Agent Pankin logged into a computer terminal, activating an effect card ("[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2115 |Swipe Left - No, your other-other-Left]]]") which attached to Dr. Agarwal. The card caused all monsters in the game to become companions of Dr. Agarwal.  It also caused an unexpected error to AIC-Glacon, which shut down. Dr. Agarwal advanced with her new [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-082 |humanoid]]] and [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/whoa-here-she-comes |canid]]] companions, and Agents Smith and Pankin ran towards the Site exit. 
> 
> As Agent Smith emerged from the Site, her entry into the sunlight triggered a Green trap card ("[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/shaggydredlocks-proposal |Sunshine, Lollipops and Rainbows]]]"). Agent Smith's Hit Points were reduced to zero, but she remained active in the game, her body melting into a glutinous mass. Agent Pankin, trapped by the approaching companions of Dr. Agarwal, attempted to use a Red Card ("[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-447 |Green Goo Gun]]]") on the remains of Agent Smith, but the weapon's only effect was to lubricate the creature, delaying its efforts to breach the Site entrance. Agent Pankin was eventually attacked and consumed - his Hit Points were also reduced to zero, and his body fused into the liquid mass. 
> 
> The amorphous biomass spoke to Dr. Agarwal, stating that it was her companion and encouraging her to join it. Her companions attacked the creature, but were absorbed by it.  Dr. Igotta used a final companion card: "[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-179 |Sister Semaphore]]]", a cosmic being which flew upwards into the atmosphere and disappeared. And then the sun went out. 
> 
> The gelatinous biomass collapsed, losing all function. However the previously absorbed bodies of Agents Smith and Pankin remained at zero Hit Points, and their coating of green goo suddenly [DATA EXPUNGED]. 
> 
> As the remaining players panicked, and mere seconds from [DATA EXPUNGED], Agent Candle arrived, and combined the Green Goo Gun card with his one remaining red card ("[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/amnestic-orientation-manual |Don't forget your eel juice]]]"), firing the resulting weapon upwards at the primary players. 
> 
> All players awoke simultaneously with no memory of the events of the game, or of the reason for their presence in the game board.  No prize money was awarded. 
> 
> Participants have professed no recollection of game events, which have been reconstructed entirely from recordings. For security and psychological reasons, events of this iteration remain classified to participants.

> **Game Summary:** Each player received a gunshot wound upon entering. However, instead of a random location, each player was shot in their left eye. Eyepatches manifested near their vicinity, which they eventually put on.
> 
> Each team started on a beach on an island in the middle of a large body of water. No other land is seen by the players. Dr Westrin draws the card [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-455 "Deep Below The Reef"], which allows him access to a secret area of the game board. A loud foghorn is heard in the distance, and a large sunken cargo ship appears at the beach.
> 
> Dr. Messer immediately plays the card "Starry Night", which reduces visibility of everyone in the area. This allows Dr. Messer to draw and play a card, which is revealed to be [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1522 "Lost Love at Sea"]. Another foghorn, this time slightly louder, is heard in the distance, and two boats appear that try and attempt to hinder Dr. Westrin's advancement to the cargo ship.
> 
> While this plays out, D-1886 plays green card [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1174 "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald"], which summons an oil tanker off the coast of the island. Another foghorn is heard, even louder than the last, in the distance once more. The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald prepares to destroys the cargo ship. JR Kim plays the card "Yin-Yang", which allows the user to play two divine beings in one turn. 
> 
> With this, she summons the supreme divine card [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-169 "The Great Leviathan"]. Due to its immense size, it causes the nearby terrain to change; mountains, crevices, and large earthquakes appear on the island and volcanic activity begins to rise. JR Kim also plays a supreme divine card called [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3000 "The Eel"]. The Eel and The Great Leviathan charge at D-1886 and the oil tanker, instantly annihilating them both.
> 
> Dr. Westrin successfully makes it to the cargo ship, and finds a small lockbox inside. Opening the lockbox, Dr. Westrin discovers the supreme divine card "The S-C-P-S Midnight Jacket", and immediately plays it. One last foghorn is heard in the distance, and a supremely large wormhole is seen in the distant at an unknown distance. A large metal spacecraft is seen exiting the wormhole. It is currently theorized that the spacecraft was approximately the size of Trenton, New Jersey.
> 
> An unidentified object around the size of a human is seen being detached from the spacecraft, which appears to be an escape pod. Once it lands on the island, an entity exits it. The entity appears as an extremely large orangutan in stereotypical sailor's clothes, smoking a pipe, and holding a finished Rubik's Cube in their hand. A [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-963 necklace] is seen around their neck.
> 
> The entity speaks through American Sign Language, and speaks with the players for a short time. After 15 minutes, the entity reenters the escape pod. It begins to fly back into the spacecraft. Eventually, several large objects that resemble anchors are shot out of the spacecraft and begin to impale The Eel and The Great Leviathan, and begin to drag them up into the craft. Immediately afterwards, the game ends and Dr. Westrin and Junior Researcher Kim are rewarded the "Mr. ESCHATOLOGY" win-condition.
