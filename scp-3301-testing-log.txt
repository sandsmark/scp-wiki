> **Game Summary:** In the shortest run of SCP-3301 thus far, Dr. Avery Bone and Dr. Owen Mars of the SCP-3301 research team ran the first test thus far of the “Apollyon[[footnote]]The meaning of this and the Maksur difficulty is unknown, as neither are officially registered object classes.[[/footnote]]” difficulty setting. 
> 
> The game map, Echoes of the Mariana, had all three teams start with their players on the edge of a high cliff next to a raging ocean, with a storm overhead. As the game began, Dr. Davis was suddenly stricken with blindness, and stumbled backwards over the edge of the cliff. Dr. LaFleur’s first draw was a Yellow Card called “Business Expenses” which granted he and Director Camp $50. Additionally, while Director Camp had been stricken with a pox on the opening of the game, one of Dr. LaFleur’s pre-game draws was a White Card called “Panacea” which was used to heal Director Camp’s pox.
> 
> After Dr. Bone’s draw, Dr. Harris began to move towards a small concrete structure when she was accosted by three incorporeal, humanoid entities, which were revealed to be a //Supreme Divine// entity called “The Three Brothers”. With no proper equipment to protect herself and no cards available for Dr. Bone to use in defense his piece, Dr. Harris was swiftly killed by the entity. Immediately upon her death, the game ended and Dr. LaFleur and Director Camp were pronounced “MR. SURVIVOR”.

> **Participants:** Director Liam Deets and Sgt. Hannah Washington of [[[SCP-3480|MTF Omega-12]]], Agent Andrea Adams and Spc. Iris Thompson of [[[resurrection|MTF Alpha-9]]], Agent Sasha Merlo and Agent Clarissa Shaw of [[[finding-anderson|MTF Gamma-13]]], and Sgt. Irantu and Spc. Nanku of [[[avatara|MTF Tau-5]]].

> 
> **Winner:** Sgt. Irantu and Spc. Nanku
> 
> **Victory Condition:** Mr. Finder
> 
> **Difficulty Setting:** Euclid
> 
> **Runtime:** 0h 45m 12 seconds
> 
> **Payout:** $602
> 
> **Game Summary:** The game took place in a heavily stylized replica of the [[[SCP-3000|SCPF Eremita]]]. On the first turn, Sgt. Washington used her reality altering abilities to materialize a modified Colt AR-15, which she then fired at Spc. Nanku. Sgt. Washington was promptly admonished for apparent rule breaking and terminated by what appeared to be a giant flaming angel's sword. Spc. Nanku, despite sustaining multiple gunshots, was relatively unphased.
> 
> The game then proceeded normally until turn 14, when Agent Shaw discovered the hidden golden anomaly but was temporarily paralyzed by a cognitohazard that was protecting it. Spc. Thompson then proceeded to acquire the anomaly.
> 
> Before Spc. Thompson succeeded at containing the anomaly, Agent Shaw recovered enough to use her red card "The Nerfing Gun" to transform Agent Johnson into an Orangutan. Spc. Nanku, who until that point had been occupied in a fistfight with a sepia-toned humanoid that self identified as [[[SCP-3043|"Murphy Law,"]]] then arrived and was able to contain the anomaly, and thus winning the game.

> **Difficulty Setting:** Maksur
> 
> **Runtime:** 4h 28m 14s
> 
> **Payout:** $100,000,000
> 
> **Game Summary:** Each player received a gunshot wound upon the game's opening: Agent Tucker was shot in the toe, Agent Steele was shot in the elbow, S.D. Locke was shot in the face yet survived, D-101 reported feeling something rush through his hair just above his scalp.
> 
> The players began in a sparsely-wooded locale illuminated by a bright, red sun; and were situated on different banks of a large, red lake. Each team was able to equip themselves with a variety of weapons due to R. Dumas playing a White card titled "Global Occult Coincidence", which replaced each player's hand with 10 Red cards. 
> 
> Players spent the next several rounds destroying anomalies, having brokered a "truce" spearheaded by Researcher Patel - who coerced his opponents into aiming for the MR. COALITION win-condition. By the third hour, Dr. Perkins and Agent Steele had the lead, at 21 anomalies destroyed. Agent Dumas then drew a companion card, "[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3899|The Night Hauler]]]", which allowed Agent Tucker to move about the game area unrestricted by die-rolls.
> 
> At the behest of Agent Dumas, who had earlier uncovered a clue as to the whereabouts of the game's hidden card; Agent Tucker quickly moved across the playing field, exploring every space contained within the game board. The team conspired to find the object, and thereby achieve the MR. FINDER win-condition. Said item ("[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3043|Murphy's Trademarked Trilby]]]") was found in the north-eastern portion of the map, guarded by a supreme divine being ("[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3004|Celestial Cicada]]]"). Agent Tucker was able to abscond with the hidden item due to his speed-boost, and avoid the entity altogether. Their turn ended as Agent Tucker took a shortcut over the red lake, attempting to reach their containment facility. The companion vehicle and the hidden item fell into the lake's center.
> 
> Dumas and Tucker's turn revealed over three dozen Orange cards, four of which were divine-class or higher. The players regrouped near the Southern wall of the map, joined by Agent Tucker on his team's next turn, and fended off attacks with their remaining cards. Their efforts were assisted by R. Patel's companion card "[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/hypervelocity|The Rookie]]]", which destroyed several anomalies - placing his team in the lead. The companion card itself was destroyed once the entity "[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/summer-s-exile|Summer's Exile]]]" reached the party's location.
> 
> At four hours, 27 minutes into play all players had depleted most of their HP defending themselves. R. Patel's team still held the lead, and the only entity remaining was "[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1570|A Lady Who Does Not Approve of Your Life Choices, Yet Cannot Look Away]]]", which did not attack; it appeared to be content staring at players from afar, out-of-reach of their weapons. On Dumas/Tucker's turn, Dumas rolled a twelve, and directed Tucker to abandon his opponents. At the end of his turn, Dumas activated a trap card "[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-165|Suspiciously Scurrying Sand]]]", killing all other players and awarding his team the MR. GENOCIDE win-condition.

> 
> **A. Dumas:** Yea, whose idea was it to play on Maksur anyways?

> **Runtime:** 0h 10m 00 seconds 
>

> 
> **Game Summary:** The game was set within the Mare Imbrium crater, with an unmanned facility located in the approximate centre of the map. Each player's "containment facility" featured an underground portion with a high-speed rail tunnel connecting to the central facility; they were otherwise wholly independent from each-other. 
> 
> At the start of the game, a flare of light occurred on the board and a ten-minute countdown appeared above the primary players; secondary players reported that the sun was undergoing a supernova event. All secondary players reported impediment or ailment: Agent Arch and Agent Quinzeen reported blindness; Cpl. Winston and Agent (D.) Kadowski reported [[[SCP-008 | flu symptoms and severe fever]]]; Agent Karlyle reported [[[SCP-2684 | nausea, internal pain and difficulty moving]]]; D-93017 reported all symptoms.
> 
> Researcher Pentach equipped D-93017 with the Blue Card "████ ███", manifesting a human male with no apparent in-game function; the entity was amnesic and was mostly unaware of the game in progress. Researcher Pentach directs D-93017 towards the underground rail tunnel; D-93017, impeded by blindness and severe fever, repeatedly ignored directions and travelled in incorrect directions. At the end of the turn, Researcher Pentach drew the Black Card [[[SCP-2271 | "Eternal Interest"]]], forcing him to discard one card every turn or D-93017 would be automatically killed. (Time remaining: 9m 27s.)
> 
> Sgt. (S.) Kadowski used the Yellow Card [[[SCP-2630 | "Never Overestimate The Use of SCPs"]]], to grant his team $500. Cpl. Winston was then instructed to find a spacesuit before Sgt. (S.) Kadowski drew to end his turn. (Time remaining: 9m 20s.)
> 
> Agent Samson equipped Agent Karlyle with the Red Card "Rayman's Laygun", then directed them to the medical wing of their facility. Agent Samson drew the Black Card [[[SCP-2821 | "Chaos Hole"]]] at the end of their turn, permanently disabling their high-speed rail. (Time remaining: 9m 11s.)
> 
> Agent Peterson equipped Agent Quinzeen with the Red Card [[[SCP-2493 | "Anti-matterman's Perfecto-suit"]]], enabling them to traverse the lunar surface. Agent Quinzeen's training with cognitohazards assists them in navigating despite blindness, and reaches the surface exit. Agent Peterson draws the Black Card "Neutralised", expending "Anti-matterman's Perfecto-suit".
> 
> Agent Chang instructs Agent Arch to find supplies; impeded by blindness, they encounter the Supreme Divine Orange Card [[[SCP-3125 | "Mysterious Mega-Malicious Meta-Meme"]]], which immediately kills them. (Time remaining: 9m 05s.)
> 
> Sgt. Wyte equips Agent (D.) Kadowski with the Red Card "Night Vision Goggles". Agent (D.) Kadowski discovers and equips themselves with the Red Card "Spacesuit", enabling them to traverse the lunar surface. Sgt. Wyte then draws the Purple Card [[[SCP-REDD | "Mr. Redd O. P. Discontinued C. P."]]], which attacks and kills Agent (D.) Kadowski. (Time remaining: 8m 54s.)
> 
> Researcher Pentach equips D-93017 with the Red Card "Map Map", enabling them to see (but not identify) all active cards on the map. An Orange Card — assumed to be the second Supreme Divine entity spawned on the fourth turn — is seen navigating towards D-93017. Researcher Pentach directs D-93017 to the high-speed rail, but D-93017 again fails to follow instructions.
> 
> At this point, Researcher Pentach attempts to cheat by introducing a foreign card — "Pot of Greed", from the Yu-Gi-Oh card game — to the game. SCP-3301 accepts the card, dispensing two cards; both cards are copies of the Black Card "Pot of Weed", forcing Researcher Pentach to immediately draw two more cards for each. All four drawn cards are additional copies of "Pot of Weed"; all cards that Researcher Pentach draws using "Pot of Weed" are, invariably, additional copies of "Pot of Weed".
> 
> Researcher Pentach's behaviour rapidly degraded in a manner indicative of a psychoactive drug overdose; upon reaching 256 copies of "Pot of Weed", Researcher Pentach became incapable of any further action, apparently lapsing into a vegetative state.[[footnote]]As "Pot of Weed" has not been encountered outside this event, it is unknown if this was an intentional function of the game or not.[[/footnote]] Other players were unable to execute any tasks, as Researcher Pentach had been unable to end their turn.
> 
> Once the timer reached zero, the entire map — and all items and players on it — was simultaneously vaporised, ending the game with no victor and no payout.

> **Log ID:** 3301|028
> 
> **Participants:** [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/long-live-the-king | Dr. King]]] and D-93017, Researcher John and D-85493
> 
> **Game Board:** Appleseeds
> 
> **Winner:** Dr. King and D-93017
> 
> **Victory Condition:** [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/interval-2 | Mr. Appleseeds]]]
> 
> **Difficulty Setting:** Safe[[footnote]]Despite being set to Safe, the game functioned more akin to Neutralized; all exposed blood was replaced with an equal volume of apple seeds, and no functional anomalies were encountered.[[/footnote]]
> 
> **Runtime:** 75h 43m 29 seconds 
> 
> **Payout:** 400,000 appleseeds
> 
> **Game Summary:**
> 
> Map was a flat, featureless plane comprised entirely of appleseeds; only the top ten centimetres of appleseeds were loose, with the remainder compacted into a solid surface.
> 
> All cards in both player's hands are variously coloured copies of "Appleseed".
> 
> Dr. King uses a Green Card "Appleseed." A single appleseed manifests in the air next to D-93017. D-93017 begins searching the map; Dr. King draws a Black Card "Appleseed", manifesting another single appleseed next to D-93017.
> 
> Researcher John equips D-85493 with a Blue Card "Appleseed"; a single appleseed manifests in D-85493's hand. Researcher John draws a Red Card "Appleseed".
> 
> No remarkable events occurred for the following seventy-five consecutive hours, with all cards drawn and encountered on the map were universally colour variants of "Appleseed"; although Researcher John and Dr. King could identify map tiles containing Orange or Purple "Appleseed" cards, D-93017 and D-85493 were unable to distinguish their in-game appearance from other loose apple seeds.
> 
> The game abruptly ended when Dr. King equipped D-93017 with a Red Card "Appleseed", thereby filling all available slots with various copies of "Appleseed" and achieving the previously unknown "Mr. Appleseed" victory condition. The room SCP-3301 was used in was progressively filled with an estimated 400,000 apple seeds following the conclusion of the game.

> **Card Title:** Appleseed
