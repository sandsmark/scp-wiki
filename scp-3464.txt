**Item #:** SCP-3464

**Object Class:** Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** As no new instances of SCP-3464 have been produced, containment is dedicated to the suppression of information regarding SCP-3464's true nature. 

449 instances of SCP-3464 are contained in the Low-priority Safe Containment Wing of Site-82.

**Description:** SCP-3464 was a large quantity of garlic bread disseminated throughout the United States and Canada between the months of April and September 2018.

Each instance of SCP-3464 was baked using ingredients typical of garlic bread, which includes mozzarella cheese, garlic shavings, parsley, and yeast. SCP-3464 instances vary in mass from a 0.2 kg slice to a 2 kg loaf. 449 total instances of SCP-3464 have been located.

SCP-3464's anomalous properties manifest upon serving, prior to consumption. SCP-3464 expands to 10 times its initial size; a proportionate mass of garlic bread is newly generated[[footnote]]It has been noted that establishments containing SCP-3464 during anomalous expansion typically discover the loss of organic waste proportional to the amount of garlic bread generated. Persons consuming the garlic bread are unaware of this change.[[/footnote]]. After its growth, SCP-3464 vocalizes about the impact of food waste using the voice of acclaimed voice actor Don LaFontaine. Vocalizations occur for up to 5 minutes. The following is an excerpt from one such vocalization:

> In a world, where we could have our cake and eat it too, we savoured every last bite. Now, when the stakes have risen, our final feast may be eaten alone. Every day, we face hunger. Paranoia. Shortage. And the most horrifying struggle of all. Sharing. With our final meal fast approaching, we look to you as the last line of defense. Take the bite, or suffer the consequences.

SCP-3464 is safe for consumption before, during, and after the anomalous effects manifest. Approximately 15% of persons consuming SCP-3464 report feeling pressured against wasting food for 1 month after consumption.

**Incident Log 3464-450-Kerala**: On September 27th, 2018, the 450th instance of SCP-3464 (SCP-3464-450) was discovered in an Olive Garden restaurant in Toronto, Ontario.

**<Begin Log>**

**<0:00:00>** Two individuals in long grey overcoats (Kerala/K-1 and K-2) enter the restaurant and are promptly greeted. 30 other patrons are present in various stages of dining.

**<0:05:20>** An attendant leads the pair towards a table in the centre of the restaurant and asks if they require the menu, to which they deny. They emit a pungent scent, later identified as consistent with geas binding.

**<0:05:51>** K-1 orders a pajata[[footnote]]A dish made from the milk-filled intestines of a calf.[[/footnote]] seasoned with basil and shredded bay leaves. K-2 orders flame-broiled capretto[[footnote]]Domestic goat meat.[[/footnote]] cooked in benzoin oil and seasoned with black pepper and asafoetida spice[[footnote]]Notably, the two main orders do not exist in any Olive Garden restaurants worldwide and contain herbs used in spiritual evocation.[[/footnote]], as well as a side order of "sempiternal Empyrean garlic bread".

**<0:26:14>** The attendant returns with the requested orders. The garlic bread (SCP-3464-450) emits a green glow indicative of ectoplasm. The attendant fails to mention the state of the garlic bread.

**<0:27:02>** K-1 prepares a thaumaturgical circle. K-2 places the garlic bread in the middle. The two dishes are ritually sacrificed and summarily consumed. The garlic bread grows as the table collapses beneath it. Witnesses are rendered immobile due to geas binding.

**<0:30:51>** At this point, the garlic bread has expanded to fill the room. A Foundation thaumatologist (K-0) enters the restaurant, ordering all patrons to evacuate. K-1 tells patrons to consume the garlic bread. The patrons comply with K-1.

**<0:31:24>** As patrons consume substantial amounts of garlic bread, it radiates a blue glow. The souls of patrons that have consumed the garlic bread (which includes 11 adults, 4 children, and 1 infant) are forced into SCP-3464-450 while their bodies collapse. K-0 vocalizes containment incantations, allowing unaffected patrons and Olive Garden staff to evacuate[[footnote]]All members of the public were amnesticized and released following the incident.[[/footnote]].

**<0:33:10>** K-2 begins a summoning ritual using a vial of an unidentified crimson liquid. K-0 attempts to stop K-2 but is assailed by the bodies of the damned.

**<0:36:49>** K-2 summons Allumgh'tha, an incorporeal Type-III Tartarean entity. K-0 returns 7 souls to their owners.

**<0:37:09>** Allumgh'tha manifests within SCP-3464-450. K-1 and K-2 consume the garlic bread[[footnote]]The ingestion of Allumgh'tha would grant K-1 and K-2 with soul consumption capabilities, the procurement of which appears to be their goal.[[/footnote]].

**<0:38:15>** K-0 is successful in returning 15 of the 16 souls. As K-1 and K-2 continue consumption, their bodies convulse; their souls assimilate esoteric energies from Sheol and the 16th patron's soul.

**<0:39:19>** K-0 deploys a portable electro-thaumic exorcism device and attempts to banish Allumgh'tha. Due to the 16th soul having been absorbed, the entity cannot be banished. 

**<0:39:51>** SCP-3464-450 expands into the street, destroying the building in the process. The manifestation of multiple arthropod appendages and a corrosive liquid similar to olive oil indicate Allumgh'tha's heightening control.

**<0:40:36>** K-0 attempts astral body expulsion, sacrificing their soul's energies to aid in the exorcism. 

**<0:45:17>** Allumgh'tha is banished, taking the souls of K-1 and K-2 with it in vengeance. SCP-3464-450 erupts, dispersing garlic bread across the nearby Yonge-Dundas Square.

Over the next month, garlic bread within Italian-themed restaurants in Downtown Toronto vocalized with the voice of Don LaFontaine, warning about the dangers of garlic bread. A dedicated Foundation media coverup team implanted in Olive Garden has been charged with maintaining the guise of SCP-3464 being an elaborate social experiment conducted to raise food waste awareness.

The souls of K-0, K-1, and K-2 cannot be located. Their bodies have been contained in the Humanoid Containment Wing of Site-82.

On October 13th, 2018, the creation and dissemination of SCP-3464 was confirmed to be the work of independent Dutch anartist Ignaas Markus (PoI-4312). PoI-4312, a known demonologist specialising in demonic edibles, is a rising figure in the North American anomalous art scene. His extensive use of infernal entities has made him a target of paranormal manipulation and sabotage. The hijacking of SCP-3464-450 by an unknown rogue faction is the latest in a string of attacks against PoI-4312's work.
