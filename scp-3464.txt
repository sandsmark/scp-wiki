----
**Special Containment Procedures:** All 449 instances of SCP-3464 are kept in a cold storage unit at [[[scp-4631|Site-201]]]. As no new instances of SCP-3464 have been produced, and all instances have ceased to display anomalous properties, further containment is dedicated to the suppression of information about SCP-3464's true nature.

Mobile Task Force Delta-13 ("Undead Bread Redemption") is currently implanted within Toronto Public Health to assess irregularities in bread production and preparation in the city of Toronto.

**Description:** SCP-3464 was a large quantity of garlic bread disseminated throughout the Toronto area between April and September 2018.

Each instance of SCP-3464 was baked using ingredients typical of garlic bread, which includes mozzarella cheese, garlic shavings, parsley, and yeast. SCP-3464 instances vary in mass from a 0.2 kg slice to a 2 kg loaf; in total, 449 instances have been located.

SCP-3464's anomalous properties manifest upon serving, before consumption. Each instance expands to 10 times its initial size; a proportionate mass of garlic bread is newly generated.[[footnote]]Establishments containing SCP-3464 during anomalous expansion typically discover the loss of organic waste proportional to the amount of garlic bread generated. Persons consuming the garlic bread are unaware of this change.[[/footnote]] After its growth, SCP-3464 vocalizes about the impact of food waste using the voice of acclaimed voice actor Don LaFontaine. Vocalizations occur for up to 5 minutes. The following is an excerpt from one such vocalization.

> In a world, where we could have our cake and eat it too, we savoured every last bite. Now, when the stakes have risen, our final feast may be eaten alone. Every day, we face hunger. Paranoia. Shortage. And the most horrifying struggle of all. Sharing. With our final meal fast approaching, we look to you as the last line of defence. Take the bite, or suffer the consequences.

SCP-3464 is safe for consumption before, during, and after the anomalous effects manifest. 15% of persons consuming SCP-3464 reported feeling pressured against wasting food for 1 month after consumption.

= **INCIDENT 3464-450-KERALA**
----
**Note:** On September 27, 2018, the 450th instance of SCP-3464 (SCP-3464-450) was discovered in an Olive Garden restaurant in Toronto, Ontario. The following log was compiled from the restaurant's surveillance system and testimonies from patrons and Olive Garden staff.
----
= **<Begin Log, 01:26 PM>**

**«01:26:»** Two persons in long grey overcoats (Kerala/K-1 and K-2) enter the restaurant. 30 other patrons are present in various stages of dining.

**«01:28:»** An attendant leads the pair toward a table in the centre of the restaurant and asks if they need the menu. They decline.

**«01:29:»** K-1 orders a pajata[[footnote]]A dish made from the milk-filled intestines of a calf.[[/footnote]] seasoned with basil and shredded bay leaves. K-2 orders flame-broiled capretto[[footnote]]Domestic goat meat.[[/footnote]] cooked in benzoin oil and seasoned with black pepper and asafoetida spice. The pair also orders "sempiternal garlic bread".

**«01:39:»** The attendant returns with the requested orders.[[footnote]]Notably, the two main orders do not exist in any Olive Garden restaurants worldwide and contain herbs used in sacrificial rituals. Surveillance footage reveals the orders spontaneously emerged atop a counter within the kitchen. The garlic bread has been identified as SCP-3464-450.[[/footnote]]

**«01:40:»** Using the table's condiments,[[footnote]]Tabasco sauce.[[/footnote]] K-1 prepares a thaumaturgical summoning circle. K-2 places SCP-3464-450 in the middle. The two dishes are ritualistically offered to and consumed by the garlic bread. The garlic bread grows in size as the table collapses beneath it.

**«01:42:»** SCP-3464-450 fills the room.

**«01:43:»** Field Thaumaturge Δ-7 -- a tactical food and safety enforcement operative working with MTF-Δ-13 out of Site-201 -- bypasses the entrance to the restaurant,[[footnote]]Further investigation reveals that FT-Δ7 was dispatched to detain K-1 and K-2 for food-related health offences.[[/footnote]] ordering all patrons to evacuate.

K-1 commands patrons to consume the garlic bread. Some comply.

**«01:45:»** SCP-3464-450 radiates a bright blue as patrons consume it. Patrons that have consumed the garlic bread (11 adults and four children) collapse -- SCP-3464-450 absorbs their [[[goc-supplemental-arad|Elan-Vital]]] essences.[[footnote]]Elan-Vital essence: Otherwise known as the "human soul".[[/footnote]] FT-Δ7 vocalizes containment incantations, allowing unaffected patrons and Olive Garden staff to evacuate safely.

**«01:46:»** K-2 commences a summoning ritual using a vial of unidentified crimson liquid. FT-Δ7 attempts to stop K-2 but is assailed by the bodies of collapsed patrons, which have become necromantically controlled.

**«01:48:»** K-2 summons an incorporeal Tartarean entity of unknown typology. FT-Δ7 returns seven Elan-Vital essences to their owners.

**«01:49:»** The entity manifests within SCP-3464-450. K-1 and K-2 consume the garlic bread.[[footnote]]It is ultimately unknown what the significance of this ritual is, or if it has even been fully completed.[[/footnote]]

**«01:50:»** FT-Δ7 is successful in returning 15 of the 16 patrons to their bodies. As K-1 and K-2 continue consumption, their bodies convulse.

**«01:51:»** FT-Δ7 attempts an exorcism to banish the entity.

SCP-3464-450 expands into the street, destroying the building in the process. The instance grows arachnid appendages and leaks corrosive olive oil.

**«01:52»** FT-Δ7 sacrifices their own Elan-Vital essence to aid in the exorcism.

**«01:57:»** K-1 and K-2 disappear into the garlic bread mass. SCP-3464-450 erupts; garlic bread disperses across the nearby Yonge-Dundas Square.

= **<End Log, 01:58 PM>**
----
**Closing Remarks:** A dedicated Foundation media coverup team implanted in Olive Garden has been charged with maintaining the guise of SCP-3464 being an elaborate social experiment conducted to raise food waste awareness.

On October 13, the creation and dissemination of SCP-3464 was confirmed to be the work of Dutch para-chef Ignaas Markus (PoI-4312). Ignaas -- a known demonologist specializing in demonic edibles -- is a rising figure in the [[[ambrose-restaurant-hub|North American anomalous restaurant scene]]]. His extensive use of infernal entities has made him a target of paranormal manipulation and sabotage. The hijacking of SCP-3464-450 by an unknown rogue faction is the latest in a string of attacks against Ignaas' cooking.
