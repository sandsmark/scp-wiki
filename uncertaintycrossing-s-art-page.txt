Heya, seems you've stumbled across my art page. I'm UncertaintyCrossing, owner/Agent Leader of the SCP Amino for anyone who knows what that is. Probably also know me as The Director or Gatekeeper depending on where you're from. Uncertainty will do just fine for now.

Regardless of all of that though, I specalize in digital art and I finally found the time to actually contribute to the Wiki. Hooray! 

I'm just getting back into drawing SCP content, so apologies if things are a bit sparse. 

If you're an author and would like art of your SCP/tale/whatever, please do send me a message! Otherwise, thanks for stopping by.

All the art here has been done within the last six months or so.  It's a bit sparse, yeah, so I am taking free requests (or commissions, if you're generous) of SCP content.

[[tab SCP Amino.]]
Items I've made as the primary graphic designer for the Amino. If you don't know what the SCP Amino is, I don't blame you. It's a fandom app meant for the younger side of the community, aged between 13-16. There's a lot of OCs and RPs and whatnot there, but consider it a place where people enjoy the fandom and learn and grow.
I more or less own the place now, and run it with the rest of my staff team. If you have any further questions about the place, feel free to reach out.

Site Director Basar, aka my persona on the Amino. The Site he runs is meant to represent the Amino itself.

[[tab Wanderers Library pieces.]]
--Pieces for The Wanderers' Library. Will most likely be moved to that site sometime soon, but for now they're also placed here.-- 

Hey, I now have an art page over on the WL site! Please head [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/the-gatekeeper-s-sketchbook there] if you're interested in seeing works that relate to the Library!

--Okay but while you're here take this piece of a very cursed staff member.--

[[tab Older and Archived.]]
All the art here is old and I do not like much of it at all anymore, lmao, but I keep seeing them reposted and whatnot so figured I may establish that yes, these are my art pieces. I also keep them saved to see how much I've grown over the years. Hopefully y'all can see the growth too, lmfao.
