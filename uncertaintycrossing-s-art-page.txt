Heya, I'm UncertaintyCrossing, owner of the SCP Amino for anyone who knows what that is. I specalize in digital art and I finally found the time to make an art page.

Some of these pieces are a bit older and have my old signature/are in my old style. I plan to replace them with more recent art sometime soon, but figured I would share them as well anyways. I would love some suggestions of things to draw as I'm currently trying to get back into drawing SCP content. Thanks for stopping by!
