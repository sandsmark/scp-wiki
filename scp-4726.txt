**Item #:** SCP-4726

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4726 is contained in a humanoid containment chamber with direct access to a shower.

SCP-4726-1 may be collected as necessary and is stored in Site-17's Chemical Laboratory. Consumption of SCP-4726-1 is currently permitted but discouraged. 

**Description:** SCP-4726 is a tall, obese human male of Hispanic descent. The subject has been diagnosed with hyperhidrosis.[[footnote]] A condition causing abnormally excessive sweating involving the extremities, underarms, and face, usually unrelated to body temperature or exercise. [[/footnote]]

SCP-4726 secretes an opaque liquid substance (hereafter referred to as SCP-4726-1) at a rate of 1.4 liters per hour. The chemical composition of SCP-4726-1 consists of caffeine, sugar, taurine, and other folic acids.
