[[/div]]

**Name:** Researcher/Landscaper David Eskobar

**Security Clearance:** Level 3

**Duties:** Principal researcher for Group of Interest Alpha-388, "Alexylva University," assistant director of Site 38, landscaping duties as needed

**History:** Mr. Eskobar was employed at Site 38 during a search for possible landscapers to maintain SCP-████ once it became apparent that D-class personnel often deliberately exposed themselves to its effects to avoid other duties. Mr. Eskobar was hired away from a private landscaping firm in ██████, Tennessee with offers of both increased compensation and superior benefits due to his experience in maintaining SCP-████'s non-anomalous analogue, //Berberis canadensis.// Provisional Level 1 clearance granted.

09/02/██: Massive containment breach at Site 38 leads to deaths of most personnel involved in containment of SCP-████.
11/02/██: Mr. Eskobar reports to Site 38 in possession of SCP-████, delivering to appropriate authorities. Lacking any other practical option, Eskobar is promoted to Level 2 and given oversight of SCP-████ on the condition that he not request a pay increase.
██/13/██: In light of continued good performance, Junior Researcher Eskobar promoted to Level 3, transferred to Site 19 for experimentation with [[[SCP-877]]].
██/██/██: Incident 234-900 Tempest Night results in a massive containment breach at Site 19. Junior Researcher Eskobar --, like a goddamn idiot,-- [http://www.scp-wiki.net/game-day-1:smilers attempted to] --clusterfuck the Foundation-- initiate multiple containment breaches, planning to weaponize them for --self-aggrandizement-- containment purposes --, because that completely makes sense, asshole-- .

"And that, Eskobar, is why I despise you." --Dr. Mackenzie

Researcher Eskobar experienced an attack by SCP-993 during the containment breach, only being recovered two days later, at the end of Site 19's primary security failure. Eskobar remanded to psychiatric care for █ months.
12/02/██: Researcher Eskobar requests transfer back to Site 38. Transfer approved. Due to standing Foundation requirements, Researcher Eskobar was retained at Level 3 status at Site 38 only and placed over all Safe and Euclid-class objects related to GoI Alpha-388, then numbering █.
11/08/██: Researcher Eskobar given position of provisional director of Site 38 due to retirement of the previous officeholder, with understanding that he is to retain job only so long as he can continue his preexisting responsibilities. Due to the low-priority status of Site 38, no replacement has been assigned to date.

Additionally, Researcher Eskobar remains the only person --willing to trim that goddamn thornbush-- authorized for direct contact with SCP-████.
