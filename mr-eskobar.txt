**Name:** Junior Researcher/Landscaper David Eskobar

**Security Clearance:** Level 3

**Duties:** Principal researcher for Group of Interest Alpha-388, "Alexylva University," landscaping duties as needed

**History:** Mr. Eskobar was employed at Site 38 during a search for possible landscapers to maintain SCP-████ once it became apparent that D-class personnel often deliberately exposed themselves to its effects to avoid other duties. Mr. Eskobar was hired away from a private landscaping firm in ██████, Tennessee with offers of both increased compensation and superior benefits due to his experience in maintaining SCP-████'s non-anomalous analogue, //Berberis canadensis.// Provisional Level 1 clearance granted.

09/02/██: Massive containment breach at Site 38 leads to deaths of most personnel involved in containment of SCP-████.
11/02/██: Mr. Eskobar reports to Site 38 in possession of [[[SCP-961]]], delivering to appropriate authorities. Lacking any other practical option, Eskobar is promoted to Level 2 and given oversight of SCP-████ on the condition that he not request a pay increase.
██/13/██: Junior Researcher Eskobar promoted to Level 3, transferred to Site 19 for experimentation with [[[SCP-877]]].
██/██/██: Incident 234-900 Tempest Night involves a massive containment breach at Site 19. Junior Researcher Eskobar --, like a goddamn idiot,-- [http://www.scp-wiki.net/game-day-1:smilers attempted to] --clusterfuck the Foundation-- initiate multiple containment breaches, attempting to weaponize them for --self-aggrandizement-- containment purposes --, because that's a logical statement-- . 

"And that, Eskobar, is why I despise you." --Dr. Mackenzie

Researcher Eskobar experienced an attack by SCP-993 during the containment breach, only being recovered two days later, at the end of Site 19's primary security failure. Eskobar remanded to psychiatric care for █ months.
12/02/██: Junior Researcher Eskobar requests transfer back to Site 38. Transfer approved. Eskobar placed over all Safe and Euclid-class objects related to GoI Alpha-388, then numbering █.

Researcher Eskobar remains the only person --willing to trim that goddamn thornbush-- authorized for direct contact with SCP-████.
