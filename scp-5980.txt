**Item #:** SCP-5980

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5980 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site 45. SCP-5980 does not require sustenance. SCP-5980 is allowed outside of its containment cell once per day for two hours for recreational activities, but is strictly prohibited from entering the cafeteria. 

Food offered by SCP-5980 should be declined by personnel in order to maintain their mental health.

**Description:** SCP-5980 is the designation given to Ethan Chin, age 33. 

SCP-5980 is capable of perfect cellular regeneration and is, by definition, biologically immortal. Given the regenerative properties of SCP-5980's cells, research into utilizing SCP-5980 for medicinal treatment is currently underway.

Extensive testing of samples taken from SCP-5980's body has revealed that its skin, as well as its organs, nerves, and fingernails, possess a flavour that is universally enjoyed by those that consume it. The flavor of SCP-5980 will vary depending on the consumer. SCP-5980 exhibits a pleasant aroma regardless of the seasoning it's cooked with.

SCP-5980 is amicable and will often encourage Foundation personnel to "have a bite" of it when they pass by. It is important to note that SCP-5980 does not exhibit any congnitohazardous properties.

Consumption of SCP-5980, while safe, is often detrimental to a subject's mental health. 

**Discovery:**

SCP-5980 was discovered after several complaints were made in an establishment called Cannibal Chin's in northern New Jersey. A food critic claimed to have witnessed SCP-5980 remove its fingers with a kitchen knife before deep-frying them. These were later served as french fries. Several other civilians claimed to have caught glimpses of SCP-5980 self-mutilating in the kitchen moments before serving them food, and a Foundation investigation was instigated.

When questioned, SCP-5980 claimed to have no idea what it was doing wrong, and insisted that Foundation operatives try a meal called "Chin's Special Dessert". Its requests were ultimately denied but Agent [[span class="bblock"]]Louise[[/span]], who was unaware of SCP-5980's anomalous properties, consumed the entirety of a large fry, dipping it in a dark green milkshake. Agent [[span class="bblock"]]Louise[[/span]] was psychologically evaluated and later requested an amnestic. His request was approved.

SCP-5980 willingly came into Foundation custody once apprehended.

Cannibal Chin's was shut down using Cover Story 14 ("Health and Safety Violation") after four years of continuous operation.

> 
> **SCP-5980:** Oh, that's easy. I crank up the heat real high if the water's running low, and I keep all my spare meat n' shit in the cooler. God, I think I'd die if I made every order at once.
> 
> **Dr. Andrews:** And what did people say to you when they found out that //you// were the source of their meals?
>
