**Cross-SCP Termination Testing for SCP-682**

Due to the highly aggressive, adaptive, and intelligent nature of SCP-682, termination testing has been ordered, with clearance from 05 Command.  With major concerns raised about possible developed immunities (due to the failure of SCP-409) and possible adaptations, all tests must first be carried out on tissue samples taken from SCP-682.  This step may be bypassed only by 0-5 Command order.

**Item:** [[[SCP-689]]]

**Tissue Test Record:**
Overridden by 05-Command
**Termination Test Record:**
SCP-682 exposed to SCP-689.  Lights shut off in containment area.  Lights remain extinguished for 5 minutes.  Lights are switched on.  SCP-689 remains in its original position.  SCP-682 is in a pool of grey and black liquid, with no observable life signs.  D-Class issued to physically verify SCP-682 termination, with two Agents supervising.  D-Class enters three steps into the containment area when SCP-682 rapidly rises and attacks D-Class personnel.  SCP-682 breaks containment and escapes, killing one Agent in the process.  Remaining Agent terminated by SCP-689 due to accidental observation during testing.

//Notes:  It appears that SCP-682 is not “alive” in a way that is currently understood, or is immune to SCP-689.  In addition, it appears SCP-682 has prior knowledge of SCP-689, or was somehow able to understand its function in order to “play possum” and escape.//

**Item:** [[[SCP-017]]]

**Tissue Test Record:**
Sample “swallowed” by SCP-017 without incident.
**Termination Test Record:**
SCP-682 exposed to SCP-017.  SCP-682 issues several sounds at extremely high volume, damaging several recording devices.  Sound extends across several wavelengths, reported as “the most god-awful roar” by staff.  SCP-017 appears to stumble, then return to a far corner of the containment area.  SCP-682 attempts to break containment of both SCP-682 and SCP-017.  SCP-682 suppressed by Agents, and removed.  SCP-682 states “You foul bags of tissue; you don’t [DATA EXPUNGED]

//Notes: It is unclear if SCP-682 somehow damaged SCP-017, or communicated with it.  Analysis of the recorded sound is ongoing.//

**Item:** [[[SCP-096]]]

**Tissue Test Record:**
Sample frozen without incident.
**Termination Test Record:**
SCP-682 exposed to SCP-096.  SCP-682 immediately froze solid.  All testing shows SCP-682 to be in the frozen low-energy state consistent with SCP-096 exposure.  SCP-682 held under 48 hour observation before being classified as neutralized.  63 hours after exposure, SCP-682 begins emitting high levels of heat and radiation.  SCP-682 “shatters” out of cryogenic suspension, causing massive damage to all tissues.  SCP-682 escapes containment, manifesting a “radiation aura” and emitting a napalm-like substance from its mouth not previously observed.  SCP-682 appears to move much more quickly then standard.  Samples taken after eventual recapture show cellular activity to be 238% above the normal level for SCP-682.  “Aura” and “Napalm Breath” appear to dissipate after three months.

//Notes: There is debate at this time, regarding the time SCP-682 spent frozen.  It is assumed that was the time needed to adapt to the new environment, while some feel it was “biding it’s time” and waiting for security to be reduced.//
