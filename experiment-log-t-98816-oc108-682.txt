**Cross-SCP Termination Testing for SCP-682**

Due to the highly aggressive, adaptive, and intelligent nature of SCP-682, termination testing has been ordered, with clearance from 05 Command.  With major concerns raised about possible developed immunities (due to the failure of SCP-409) and possible adaptations, all tests must first be carried out on tissue samples taken from SCP-682.  This step may be bypassed only by 0-5 Command order.

**Item:** [[[SCP-689]]]

**Tissue Test Record:**
Overridden by 05-Command
**Termination Test Record:**
SCP-682 exposed to SCP-689.  Lights shut off in containment area.  Lights remain extinguished for 5 minutes.  Lights are switched on.  SCP-689 remains in its original position.  SCP-682 is in a pool of grey and black liquid, with no observable life signs.  D-Class issued to physically verify SCP-682 termination, with two Agents supervising.  D-Class enters three steps into the containment area when SCP-682 rapidly rises and attacks D-Class personnel.  SCP-682 breaks containment and escapes, killing one Agent in the process.  Remaining Agent terminated by SCP-689 due to accidental observation during testing.

//Notes:  It appears that SCP-682 is not “alive” in a way that is currently understood, or is immune to SCP-689.  In addition, it appears SCP-682 has prior knowledge of SCP-689, or was somehow able to understand its function in order to “play possum” and escape.//

**Item:** [[[SCP-017]]]

**Tissue Test Record:**
Sample “swallowed” by SCP-017 without incident.
**Termination Test Record:**
SCP-682 exposed to SCP-017.  SCP-682 issues several sounds at extremely high volume, damaging several recording devices.  Sound extends across several wavelengths, reported as “the most god-awful roar” by staff.  SCP-017 appears to stumble, then return to a far corner of the containment area.  SCP-682 attempts to break containment of both SCP-682 and SCP-017.  SCP-682 suppressed by Agents, and removed.  SCP-682 states “You foul bags of tissue; you don’t [DATA EXPUNGED]

//Notes: It is unclear if SCP-682 somehow damaged SCP-017, or communicated with it.  Analysis of the recorded sound is ongoing.//

**Item:** [[[SCP-096]]]

**Tissue Test Record:**
Sample frozen without incident.
**Termination Test Record:**
SCP-682 exposed to SCP-096.  SCP-682 immediately froze solid.  All testing shows SCP-682 to be in the frozen low-energy state consistent with SCP-096 exposure.  SCP-682 held under 48 hour observation before being classified as neutralized.  63 hours after exposure, SCP-682 begins emitting high levels of heat and radiation.  SCP-682 “shatters” out of cryogenic suspension, causing massive damage to all tissues.  SCP-682 escapes containment, manifesting a “radiation aura” and emitting a napalm-like substance from its mouth not previously observed.  SCP-682 appears to move much more quickly then standard.  Samples taken after eventual recapture show cellular activity to be 238% above the normal level for SCP-682.  “Aura” and “Napalm Breath” appear to dissipate after three months.

//Notes: There is debate at this time, regarding the time SCP-682 spent frozen.  It is assumed that was the time needed to adapt to the new environment, while some feel it was “biding it’s time” and waiting for security to be reduced.//

**Item:** [[[SCP-162]]]

**Tissue Test Record:**
Sample entangled without incident
**Termination Test Record:**
SCP-682 exposed to SCP-162.  SCP-682 begins rapid thrashing, emits several roaring noises and issues profanity directed at testing staff.  SCP-682 becomes entangled, primarily in the lower body, head, and left “arm”, entangled areas undergoing massive trauma due to SCP-682 thrashing.  After four minutes of continued exposure, SCP-682 lunges away from 162, severing its left “leg”, lower jaw, and causing serious tissue damage/removal to areas of the body.  SCP-162 remains attached to the left “arm” of SCP-682.  SCP-682 breaks containment, using SCP-162 against several Agents, staff, and researchers, resulting in eleven deaths and eighty-six injuries.  Arm and SCP-162 removed from SCP-682 during re-establishment of containment.  Two additional deaths incurred during the re-containment of SCP-162.

//Note:  General ██████ has requested that Dr. Noaqiyeum and the members of staff involved with the approval of this test report to Site Command for a disciplinary hearing.//

**Item:** [[[SCP-061]]]

**Tissue Test Record:**
Overridden by 05-Command
**Termination Test Record:**
SCP-682 exposed to SCP-061.  SCP-682 enters the “relaxed” state consistent with SCP-061 exposure.  SCP-682 is given the command “Lie down”.  SCP-682 remains unresponsive.  Command repeated twice before SCP-682 lowers itself to the ground.  Movements noted to be very sluggish and jerky.  SCP-682 given the command “roll onto your back”.  SCP-682 unresponsive.  Command repeated three times.  SCP-682 shudders several times, partially rolling over before returning to former position.  Command repeated six times.  SCP-682 appears to undergo a violent seizure, partially rising before collapsing to the floor.  SCP-682 given the command “stand up”.  SCP-682 rapidly rises and breaches containment.  SCP-682 ignores all commands given to it.  Several Agents and staff respond to re-establish containment.  SCP-682 emits a high-pitch “screech”.  All human beings in a fifteen yard radius suddenly enter the “relaxed” state consistent with SCP-061 exposure.  SCP-682 consumes several members of staff before being re-contained by specially equipped Emergency Response Teams.  “Sonic Stun” adaptation lost from SCP-682 after two weeks.

//Note:  Study into how SCP-682 integrated SCP-061 into its biology is ongoing.//

**Item:** [[[SCP-053]]]
**Tissue Test Record:** 
N/A, overridden by 05-Command
**Termination Test Record:**
SCP-682 introduced to SCP-053 containment area.  SCP-682 appears to be very confused, and shows no sign of being affected by SCP-053.  SCP-053 appears to be afraid of SCP-682, and hides behind a chair in her containment area.  SCP-682 lowers itself to the ground, resting it’s head on the floor.  SCP-053 approaches SCP-682, and after several seconds of hesitation, briefly touches SCP-682 before rapidly returning to her hiding place.  SCP-682 does not react in any way.  SCP-053 approaches SCP-682 and pats its head, causing it to exhale through its forward nostrils.  SCP-053 claps and hops in place several times before embracing the head of SCP-682.  For the remainder of the testing period, SCP-682 appears to be in a very docile state, with only two low-level escape attempts being made.  SCP-053 is observed to bring toys and other items to SCP-682, and makes several drawings on its forward carapace with crayons.  

Staff entering at the end of the test phase are immediately attacked by SCP-682, resulting in two deaths and five injuries.  SCP-682 contained and moved to separate containment unit.  SCP-053 observed crying for several minutes after SCP-682 is removed.

//Notes:  The reaction of SCP-682 is notable for several reasons.  First, it is one of the few incidents where SCP-682 has come in contact with biological tissue and not entered a “rage” state.  Second, it has raised questions as to the physical make-up and composition of SCP-053, in regards to the lack of response of SCP-682.  Third, it has provided a possible solution to long-term containment.  However, approval for the mutual containment of two highly dangerous SCP items in a single containment unit is not likely.//

**Item:** [[[SCP-123]]]

**Tissue Test Record:** 
Tissue sample absorbed by the core.
**Termination Test Record:**
Test canceled after review of testing done between SCP-162 and SCP-682.  The potential issues arising from SCP-682 gaining control of SCP-123 are too great at this time.  Review of this proposal will be made if SCP-682 is totally incapacitated by some means, with no potential of escape or sudden adaptation.

**Item:** [[[SCP-173]]]

**Tissue Test Record:** 
N/A, overridden by 05-Command
**Termination Test Record:**
SCP-682 introduced into the containment area of SCP-173.  SCP-682 makes several screeching noises, and quickly presses against the wall farthest from SCP-173, staring at it the entire time.  SCP-682 continues to stare at SCP-173 without pause for six hours.  Agents equipped with large-caliber sniper rifles dispatched, and shoot out the eyes of SCP-682, at the same time stopping all observation of SCP-173 and SCP-682.  

After resuming observation, SCP-682 is shown to be on the floor, with several injuries around its head, neck and legs.  SCP-173 is seen to have tissue from SCP-682 on its “hands”.  SCP-682 rapidly regenerates damage, and moves to a different wall, developing several sets of eyes on various parts of its body, many covered by thick, clear “caps” of armored carapace.  SCP-682 maintains observation of SCP-173 for an additional twelve hours, despite additional efforts of Agents and Foundation staff.  SCP-682 allowed to exit containment area, and recaptured in temporary containment.

//Notes:  After review, it appears SCP-173 was unable to do lethal damage to SCP-682 due to a major difference in physical size.  A possible repeat of this test may be made of SCP-682 is damaged enough to reduce its physical mass to a level equal with SCP-173.//

**Item: [[[SCP-285]]]**

**Tissue Test Record:**
N/A
**Termination Test Record:**
SCP-682 introduced to testing area.  SCP-285 is turned on, being utilized by Dr. Kondraki.  Several songs are broadcasted by SCP-285, inter spaced with insults and ridicule from Dr. Kondraki.  Songs include "Never Gonna Give You Up", “Peanut butter jelly time”, several songs by the band ABBA, and the techno remix of “The Doom Song”.  SCP-682 appears unaffected, moving at random around the containment area.  SCP-682 suddenly stops, and rams several times into the security wall separating SCP-682 and Dr. Kondraki.  Several stress fractures appear, and a large crack forms between the testing area and the secured personnel station.  SCP-682 roars into the crack for a sustained eight minutes.  Dr. Kondraki observed to shout curses for an almost equal amount of time.  Dr. Kondraki rapidly exits the secure area with SCP-285, still swearing.  SCP-682 recaptured.

//Notes: Dr. Kondraki is no longer allowed to self-approve termination requests.//

//Memo:  “Honestly, what was the plan here, annoy it to death?  Besides observation of the upper limits of the rage state of SCP-682, this accomplished nothing.  Also, I am sending Kondraki the bill for all the glass broken on-site from that damn thing’s screaming.”//
