**Cross-SCP Termination Testing for SCP-682**

Due to the highly aggressive, adaptive, and intelligent nature of SCP-682, termination testing has been ordered, with clearance from O5 Command.  With major concerns raised about possible developed immunities (due to the failure of SCP-409) and possible adaptations, all tests must first be carried out on tissue samples taken from SCP-682.  This step may be bypassed only by O5 Command order.

------

**Item:** [[[SCP-689]]]

**Tissue Test Record:**
Overridden by O5-Command

**Termination Test Record:**
SCP-682 exposed to SCP-689.  Lights shut off in containment area.  Lights remain extinguished for 5 minutes.  Lights are switched on.  SCP-689 remains in its original position.  SCP-682 is in a pool of grey and black liquid, with no observable life signs.  D-Class issued to physically verify SCP-682 termination, with two Agents supervising.  D-Class enters three steps into the containment area when SCP-682 rapidly rises and attacks D-Class personnel.  SCP-682 breaks containment and escapes, killing one Agent in the process.  Remaining Agent killed by SCP-689 due to accidental observation during testing.

//Notes:  It appears that SCP-682 is not “alive” in a way that is currently understood, or is immune to SCP-689.  In addition, it appears SCP-682 has prior knowledge of SCP-689, or was somehow able to understand its function in order to “play possum” and escape.//

------

**Item:** [[[SCP-017]]]

**Tissue Test Record:**
Sample “swallowed” by SCP-017 without incident.

**Termination Test Record:**
SCP-682 exposed to SCP-017.  SCP-682 issues several sounds at extremely high volume, damaging several recording devices.  Sound extends across several wavelengths, reported as “the most god-awful roar” by staff.  SCP-017 appears to stumble, then return to a far corner of the containment area.  SCP-682 attempts to break containment of both SCP-682 and SCP-017.  SCP-682 suppressed by Agents, and removed.  SCP-682 states, “You foul bags of tissue; you don’t [DATA EXPUNGED]”

//Notes: It is unclear if SCP-682 somehow damaged SCP-017, or communicated with it.  Analysis of the recorded sound is ongoing.//

------

**Item:** [[[SCP-162]]]

**Tissue Test Record:**
Sample entangled without incident

**Termination Test Record:**
SCP-682 exposed to SCP-162.  SCP-682 begins thrashing violently, emitting several roaring sounds and issuing profanity directed at testing staff.  SCP-682 becomes entangled with SCP-162, primarily in the lower body, head, and left forelimb. Entangled areas undergo massive trauma due to SCP-682 thrashing.  After four minutes of continued exposure, SCP-682 lunges away from SCP-162, severing its lower jaw and left hind limb, and causing serious tissue damage to many areas of its body.  SCP-162 remains attached to the left forelimb of SCP-682.  SCP-682 breaks containment, using SCP-162 against several Agents, staff, and researchers, resulting in eleven deaths and eighty-six injuries.  Forelimb and SCP-162 removed from SCP-682 during re-establishment of containment.  Two additional deaths occurred during the recontainment of SCP-162.

//Note:  General ██████ has requested that Mr. Noaqiyeum and the members of staff involved with the approval of this test report to Site Command for a disciplinary hearing.//

------

**Item:** [[[SCP-061]]]

**Tissue Test Record:**
Overridden by O5-Command

**Termination Test Record:**
SCP-682 exposed to SCP-061.  SCP-682 enters the “relaxed” state consistent with SCP-061 exposure.  SCP-682 is given the command “lie down”.  SCP-682 remains unresponsive.  Command repeated twice before SCP-682 lowers itself to the ground.  Movements noted to be very sluggish and jerky.  SCP-682 given the command “roll onto your back”.  SCP-682 unresponsive.  Command repeated three times.  SCP-682 shudders several times, partially rolling over before returning to former position.  Command repeated six times.  SCP-682 appears to undergo a violent seizure, partially rising before collapsing to the floor.  SCP-682 given the command “stand up”.  SCP-682 rapidly rises and breaches containment.  SCP-682 ignores all commands given to it.  Several Agents and staff respond to re-establish containment.  SCP-682 emits a high-pitch “screech”.  All human beings in a fifteen-meter radius suddenly enter the “relaxed” state consistent with SCP-061 exposure.  SCP-682 consumes several members of staff before being recontained by specially-equipped Emergency Response Teams.  “Sonic Stun” adaptation lost from SCP-682 after two weeks.

//Note:  Study into how SCP-682 integrated SCP-061 into its biology is ongoing.//

**Item:** [[[SCP-053]]]

**Tissue Test Record:** 
N/A, overridden by O5-Command

**Termination Test Record:**
SCP-682 introduced to SCP-053 containment area.  SCP-682 appears to be very confused, and shows no sign of being affected by SCP-053.  SCP-053 appears to be afraid of SCP-682, and hides behind a chair in her containment area.  SCP-682 lowers itself to the ground, resting its head on the floor.  SCP-053 approaches SCP-682, and after several seconds of hesitation, briefly touches SCP-682 before rapidly returning to her hiding place.  SCP-682 does not react in any way.  SCP-053 approaches SCP-682 and pats its head, causing it to exhale through its forward nostrils.  SCP-053 claps and hops in place several times before embracing the head of SCP-682.  For the remainder of the testing period, SCP-682 appears to be in a very docile state, with only two low-level escape attempts being made.  SCP-053 is observed to bring toys and other items to SCP-682, and makes several drawings on its forward carapace with crayons.  

Staff entering at the end of the test phase are immediately attacked by SCP-682, resulting in two deaths and five injuries.  SCP-682 contained and moved to separate containment unit.  SCP-053 observed crying for several minutes after SCP-682 is removed.

//Notes:  The reaction of SCP-682 is notable for several reasons.  First, it is one of the few incidents where SCP-682 has come in contact with biological tissue and not entered a “rage” state.  Second, it has raised questions as to the physical make-up and composition of SCP-053, in regards to the lack of response of SCP-682.  Third, it has provided a possible solution to long-term containment.  However, approval for the mutual containment of two highly dangerous SCP items in a single containment unit is not likely.//

------

**Item:** [[[SCP-123]]]

**Tissue Test Record:** 
Tissue sample absorbed by the core.

**Termination Test Record:**
Test canceled after review of testing done between SCP-162 and SCP-682.  The potential issues arising from SCP-682 gaining control of SCP-123 are too great at this time.  Review of this proposal will be made if SCP-682 is totally incapacitated by some means, with no potential of escape or sudden adaptation.

------

**Item:** [[[SCP-173]]]

**Tissue Test Record:** 
N/A, overridden by O5-Command

**Termination Test Record:**
SCP-682 introduced into the containment area of SCP-173.  SCP-682 makes several screeching noises, and quickly presses against the wall farthest from SCP-173, staring at it the entire time.  SCP-682 continues to stare at SCP-173 without pause for six hours.  Agents equipped with large-caliber sniper rifles dispatched, and shoot out the eyes of SCP-682, at the same time stopping all observation of SCP-173 and SCP-682.  

After resuming observation, SCP-682 is shown to be on the floor, with several injuries around its head, neck and legs.  SCP-173 is seen to have tissue from SCP-682 on its “hands”.  SCP-682 rapidly regenerates damage, and moves to a different wall, developing several sets of eyes on various parts of its body, many covered by thick, clear “caps” of armored carapace.  SCP-682 maintains observation of SCP-173 for an additional twelve hours, despite additional efforts of Agents and Foundation staff.  SCP-682 allowed to exit containment area, and recaptured in temporary containment.

//Notes:  After review, it appears SCP-173 was unable to do lethal damage to SCP-682 due to a major difference in physical size.  A possible repeat of this test may be made if SCP-682 is damaged enough to reduce its physical mass to a level equal with SCP-173.//

**Item:** Dr. Clef

**Tissue Test Record:**
N/A

**Termination Test Record:**
SCP-682 introduced to testing area. Dr. Clef introduced to testing area. Dr. Clef and SCP-682 stare at each other for approximately three minutes. Dr. Clef slowly backs out of the testing area as SCP-682 continues to stare. Dr. Clef attempts to open door of testing area. Door of testing area determined to be locked. Dr. Clef reportedly uses several loud expletives, and then attaches an unknown device to the door, keeping his eyes on SCP-682 the whole time. SCP-682 continues to stare. Dr. Clef detonates a small plastic explosive charge on the door, causing a containment breach. SCP-682 continues to stare. Dr. Clef engages emergency secondary lockdown doors and declares a partial containment situation. SCP-682 does not react. Dr. Clef proceeds to experiment observation center.

Two minutes later, SCP-682 somehow kills Dr. ███████, the project head, by broken neck caused by blunt force trauma against the control panel, despite remaining in the testing area.

//Notes: This is the official story and we're sticking to it. The alternative, that someone tried to murder Dr. Clef by deliberately putting him in the same room as SCP-682, is completely inconceivable.// O5-7

**Item:** One ordinary human child

**Tissue Test Record:**
n/a

**Termination Test Record:**
Child began to scream and cry when SCP-682 was introduced into the cell. Subject was immediately and messily devoured by SCP-682.

//Notes: Okay, so that didn't work so well. Maybe the fact that the kid was crying made 682 perceive it as hostile intent. . .// Guest Researcher Dr. W

**Item:** One ordinary human child, drugged to cancel extreme emotional reaction

**Tissue Test Record:**
n/a

**Termination Test Record:**
Child stood and smiled, giggling at SCP-682 with no sign of fear. SCP-682 devoured the subject messily.

//Notes:  Hmmm. . . maybe we can try that again. I'm sure somewhere out there there's a kid who'll make friends with it like SCP-053 did. . .// Guest Researcher Dr. W

**Termination Test Record:**
Subject screamed in terror and pounded on the door to the test facility, begging to be let out. SCP-682 devoured it messily three minutes after being introduced.

**Item:** █████W ██████████ cutting laser

**Tissue Test Record:**
Tissue sample was successfully bisected 13 times before adopting a mirrored finish.

**Termination Test Record:**
After multiple attempts, the main body of SCP-682 was successfully bisected into parts that were equal in mass at T+7:13 hours. Dead scraps were removed from the room while the two halves (subsequently designated SCP-682-A and SCP-682-B) regenerated. After the recovery period, SCP-682-A and -B appeared to survey the area and evaluate each other, presumably in anticipation of attack. Surface fluctuations indicative of internal modification were noted, but all external changes occurred and disappeared far too quickly to be adequately described. High-energy bioluminescent organs on the face, spine, and forelimbs were observed as well on both specimens, usually forming, pulsing, and disappearing again over the course of a few seconds.

At T+35:42 hours, SCP-682-A and -B simultaneously collapsed on the floor and all vital signs ceased, remaining in this state for the following 48 hours. At T+84 hours, the laser was used again in an attempt to cut SCP-682-A and -B into more manageable pieces, leading to minor structural damage to the room as the laser beam reflected off their skin. As both -A and -B remained immobile despite the increased potential for escape, two D-class personnel were released into the room. Immediately upon their entry, [DATA EXPUNGED].

Technical failure of the observation equipment and test chamber breach was detected from outside, activating Safety Protocol T-98816-OC108/682-N147. Containment was successfully reestablished at the cost of ███ security personnel, ███ D-class personnel, and ██ researchers, including Doctors [DATA EXPUNGED]. The majority of the testing area was considered unsalvageable and demolished for later reconstruction. Experiment supervisor Dr. █████████ was found unconscious and in critical condition outside the observation chamber (see medical logs for ██████.██/██/████); medical staff succeeded in sufficiently reviving him to be debriefed by Agent ██████, whereupon he was harshly reprimanded and [DATA EXPUNGED].

//Note: Only one SCP-682 was found in the locked-down area surrounding the wreckage, apparently at near-full mass rather than the expected 50% (scattered tissues within the facility account for the missing mass). Dr. █████████'s testimony indicates that SCP-682-A and -B exhibited a high degree of coordination following the security breach, but that once SCP-682-B became heavily damaged by security personnel, it was immediately devoured and reabsorbed by 682-A. Total loss of one of the SCP-682 specimens is considered highly improbable, and searches have been called to a halt.// Agent ██████

//Note: Much as our department would love to know whether SCP-682 retained a single consciousness during its dissection, or whether the two counterparts were actually able to cooperate until the stalemate was ended by external forces, for practical purposes we do not under any circumstances advise trying that again.// - Dr. Noaqiyeum

**Item:** 60 MT thermonuclear bomb

**Tissue Test Record:**
None

**Termination Test Record:**
Testing denied by O5-█

//Notes: One would think that putting SCP-682 in the epicenter of an explosion that can cause third-degree burns at a distance of 300 km is a good idea, but as long as there are odds of survival we simply cannot go through with it. Yes, it's a goddamn nuke, but if 682 survives and adapts we'd be boned beyond belief.// O5-█

**Item:** [[[SCP-914]]]

**Tissue Test Record:**
[DATA EXPUNGED]

**Termination Test Record:**
[DATA EXPUNGED] of "Fine" or "Very Fine" is no longer to be used by any personnel having contact with SCP-682 at any point.  In addition, any objects that have come in contact with SCP-682 at any point are not allowed to be processed by SCP-914.  Any attempt to subvert this directive [DATA EXPUNGED].

//Notes:  SCP-682 is too large to fit in to the booths, in most forms.  In addition, the tissue tests have shown that SCP-682 has... unpredictable reactions to SCP-914.  Finally, SCP-914 is too valuable a research tool, and too delicate, for this type of test.  It was nearly damaged after the incident (CN: 682-119857), and [DATA EXPUNGED] be repeated.  Should the results be recovered [DATA EXPUNGED].//

//Notes:  Does this really surprise anyone, given what 914 does to normal organics? - Dr. G//

**Item:** [[[SCP-826]]], equipped with one (1) copy of "__The Generally Nice, Friendly Thing That Can And Will Kill SCP-682 Permanently if it So Much As Spots That Damn Lizard__", a 12-page short story written by Dr. ██████, detailing a large, friendly monster that is stated to be capable of permanently killing SCP-682, and 1 (one) D-Class personnel (D-682-32) equipped with 1 (one) 2010 Ducati Multistrada motorcycle for the purpose of evading SCP-682.

**Tissue Test Record:**
N/A

**Termination Test Record:**
Story is put between SCP-826, and placed into large, empty room ██m X ██m X ██m in dimension, with a remotely operated doorway large enough to send SCP-682 through. SCP-682 is brought in front of the entryway securely.  Once researchers clear the area, door is remotely opened, exposing a green pasture similar to the one described in the story.  SCP-682 is reluctant to go through, so D-682-32 is sent through as bait. 682 follows through doorway, whereupon the doorway closes behind them. 30 minutes later, SCP-682 bursts back through the door it was sent through, somewhat worse for wear, killing ██ researchers and ██ agents in the process. Recovery personnel describe the story's pasture as having become a "Battleground", featuring impact craters with enormous body parts scattered around. Parts are thought to be from the story's "Thing". Recovered story is retitled "__The Generally Nice, Friendly Thing That Tried To Kill SCP-682 Permanently But Failed__", and is noticeably thicker, with 209 individual pages that detail an epic battle between the two monsters.

Additional attempts to coax SCP-682 into SCP-826 have been met with non-compliance on SCP-682's part.

**Item:** [[[SCP-743]]]

**Tissue Test Record:**
Sample consumed without incident.

**Termination Test Record:**
Mobile container with SCP-743 was transported to testing chamber, into which SCP-682 was released from primary containment. SCP-743's container was opened remotely. SCP-743 observed resting; SCP-682 appears to ignore SCP-743. After █ minutes, SCP-743 started flowing; SCP-682 appeared to notice within seconds. SCP-682 cautiously approached SCP-743 and tasted its flowing liquid. SCP-682 started to lap up the liquid from SCP-743. After ██ sec, SCP-682 grasped SCP-743 with its forelimbs and started pouring the liquid straight from SCP-743 into its mouth. SCP-682 drank for ██ minutes, at times [DATA EXPUNGED] on its back. SCP-743 stopped flowing and started feeding. SCP-682 tried to fight off ant swarm, but was soon covered. Swarm started to feed on SCP-682, who stopped moving. 

██ minutes later, after SCP-682 had been reduced to 79% of its original mass, SCP-682 opened its mouth and stuck out its tongue. SCP-682's tongue had become 5 m long and sticky, like an anteater's tongue. SCP-682 started to lap up ants off of itself with its tongue, eating thousands of ants at once. SCP-682 and SCP-743 continued to feed off of each other for █ hours until testing was terminated. SCP-682 displayed faster-than-normal regeneration for ██ days afterward. Adapted tongue remained for █ days.

//Note: SCP-743 treated SCP-682 as organic, but that's hardly conclusive proof. More significant is the question of whether consuming 743's liquid contributed to 682's heightened regenerative abilities. If, as suspected, it did, 743 and 682 need to stay far, far away from each other.// --Dr. Lambert

**Item:** [[[SCP-063]]]

**Tissue Test Record:**
Sample eradicated. No traces above molecular level remain.

**Termination Test Record:**
SCP-063 was refitted to the end of a rotatory arm, which was deployed into 682's enclosure. Initial approach proves partially successful, with SCP-682 losing more than 20% body weight before regeneration overtakes the destruction process. Newly regrown tissues are not vulnerable to SCP-063's eradication effect: 682 destroys the deployment arm and 063 digs a hole through the enclosure's ground, where it is later recovered. 682 succeeds in extending a long prehensile limb through the hole and maiming two security personnel before containment is reestablished.

//Hypothesis: 682 is not bound to base Earth biological chemistry and can adapt itself to be 'organic' or 'inorganic' as necessary. Some of the boys on the lab are arguing whether we can even classify it as 'living', at least as we understand life.  This worries me, because an unliving, undying intelligent monster... well, that's where you start getting sacrifices in your name.// -- Dr. Zara

**Item:** [[[SCP-807]]]

**Tissue Test Record:** 
N/A

**Termination Test Record:**
A "682 special" (10 kg of rotten meat and sharpened bone splinters, 10 L of rancid mayonnaise, 1 L potassium cyanide, and 1 kg morphine hydrochloride, combined into a solid mass then transmuted via SCP-807) was dumped into the testing room.

SCP-682 devoured "special", then began loudly demanding more. Nine minutes later, SCP-682 collapsed.

After forty-five minutes of observation, SCP-682 had not moved. Two D-Class personnel in anti-807 environment suits were sent in to verify that SCP-682 was in fact terminated; D-class were equipped with further "specials" in case SCP-682 required further distracting.

"Specials" were placed on ground in front of SCP-682's head; in response, SCP-682 opened its eyes and began gnawing weakly on nearest "special".

D-Class personnel began touching SCP-682, believing that it had been rendered harmless; at this point, SCP-682's skin ruptured in at least eleven locations, releasing ultra-high-pressure (estimated 2.7 MPascals) jets of blood in all directions. Contact with SCP-682's blood breached the integrity of the anti-807 environment suits, and both D-class personnel were contaminated.

D-Class personnel began [DATA EXPUNGED]; by the time SCP-682 had finished consuming the second "special", its skin had healed over and both D-class personnel had terminated. SCP-682 then devoured the third "special" with the same speed and enthusiasm as it had devoured the first.

**Item:** [[[SCP-662]]]

**Tissue Test Record:** 
N/A

**Termination Test Record:**
Mr. Deeds is summoned, and asked if he can destroy SCP-682 permanently.

Mr. Deeds' response: "I'm terribly sorry, sir, I'm afraid I can't."

Mr. Deeds is asked if he can kill SCP-682.

Mr. Deeds' response: "Again, sir, I'm terribly sorry, but I'm afraid I can't."

Mr. Deeds is asked if he can incapacitate SCP-682.

Mr. Deeds' response: "As a matter of fact... depending on how sir means the word 'incapacitate', and depending on how long sir wishes the creature to //be// incapacitated... yes."

Mr. Deeds is asked to expand on how he would perform such an action.

Mr. Deeds' response: "Sir, the simplest and quickest method -- which I must point out would not be the most efficient -- would be for me to offer myself up for the creature to devour me; certainly its offensive capacities would be lessened whilst it is occupied in consuming my flesh. This would be simplest as it requires no preparation on my part, sir, but I'm certain you'll understand that the overall effect on the creature would be insignificant. Were I to engage the creature in combat, either with or without weapons, I could certainly occupy its attention and offensive capacities for a longer interval; unfortunately, I'm afraid the creature would eventually defeat me, at which point it would begin consuming my flesh as I have previously described. However, I could certainly booby-trap my person with a variety of noxious substances - soporifics, perhaps, or explosives, or perhaps encapsulated neurotoxins, or even [REDACTED], so that when the creature //does// inevitably consume me, it sustains further damage. That said, sir, I must remind you that the creature's tendency towards regeneration means that any damage I inflict would be sadly temporary."

Mr. Deeds is thanked and dismissed.

//Note: Mr. Deeds' knowledge of [REDACTED] is not to be considered a security breach.//

**Item:** [[[SCP-738]]]

N/A

**Termination Test Record:**

Researcher sits in SCP-738-2, and asks "What would you want in exchange for permanently destroying the entity which we refer to as SCP-682 while leaving this planet, its biosphere, its human population, its human civilization, the SCP Foundation, and the rest of the universe intact?"

Entity takes form of the same entity as Test 203, states "Your Foundation couldn't afford it, and //you personally// **definitely** couldn't afford it," and does not respond further.

**Item:** [[[SCP-272]]]

**Tissue Test Record:**
N/A

**Termination Test Record:**

SCP-682 is released into enclosure amidst a circular array of thirty (30) two-thousand-watt (2,000W) stadium lights, of which only one (1) is switched on. SCP-272 is dropped onto SCP-682's shadow, and embeds itself in the reinforced concrete as expected. SCP-682 quickly discovers that it is trapped by SCP-272's presence in its shadow, and starts to attack SCP-272.  SCP-682 then stops midway through its attack, examines 272 closely, bellows an incomprehensible string of words, and slowly backs away from 272.

All thirty stadium lights are then switched on and off in random stroboscopic "disco" pattern, at 4 Hz. SCP-682 is forcibly hurled around the enclosure in random directions, in accordance with the stroboscopic pattern, and sustains heavy damage.

After fifty-five (55) minutes of this process, >95% of SCP-682's epidermis has been abraded away, its anterior left limb has been severed, sixty-three (63) of its teeth have been broken out of its jaw, and its skull has been fractured to the point that both its eyeballs have been dislodged from their sockets. At this point, SCP-682's exposed sub-dermal tissue begins to luminesce. The luminescence rapidly increases until it is brighter than the stadium lights, which eliminates SCP-682's shadow entirely. SCP-682 then collapses, and is no longer affected by the stroboscopic pattern.

SCP-682 continues luminescing for forty-eight (48) hours, remaining immobile for the duration; D-class personnel who recovered SCP-272 from the enclosure were not attacked, but sustained permanent retinal damage from SCP-682's luminescence despite wearing eye shields.  After 48 hours, SCP-682 resumes normal activity.

//Note: How did 682 know not to attack 272? Did it recognize the artifact? Was it able to read the glyphs carved into 272's surface? If 682 is literate, is it vulnerable to textual memetic-kill agents? Suggested methods for a viability study are welcome.//

**Item:** [[[SCP-702]]]

**Tissue Test Record:**
Tissue sample offered as trade item to SCP-702-1. 702-1 accepted, trading it for what appears to be a two-patty hamburger as commonly sold by the [REDACTED] franchise.

**Termination Test Record:**
SCP-682 is contained and offered as a trade item to SCP-702-1. 702-1 considers the tank for roughly 13 minutes before taking it. Item left in exchange is a metal cage, containing a specimen of //Psittacula krameri manillensis// (rose-ringed parakeet).

16 hours later, SCP-682 is returned to the chamber where the trading was effected, without its containment tank. SCP-702-1 is reluctant to divulge information regarding this event. Examination of debris regurgitated by 682 during the proceeding re-containment reveals fragments from a number of curious items, including [DATA EXPUNGED]. The parakeet is currently being kept at Dr. Quater's office.

**Item:** [[[SCP-096]]]

**Tissue Test Record:**
N/A

**Termination Test Record:**
Containment tank containing SCP-096 was placed in SCP-682's cell. Personnel vacated vicinity and the tank was opened remotely.

Screams of the two entities continue for twenty-seven (27) hours, at which point the noise abruptly stops. Sonar-based video feeds reveal SCP-096 severely "wounded" and huddled in the southwest corner, apparently upset. Feed shows SCP-682 on the north end of the room, approximately 85% of its initial mass absent. Re-containment teams retrieve both entities with relative ease.

Further attempts to expose SCP-096 to SCP-682 cause it to turn away from 682, jumping in place while clawing at its face and screaming.

**Item:** [[[SCP-536]]]

**Tissue Test Record:**
Tissue divided into samples and subject to the individual effects of SCP-536's dials. Notable results follow:
* Increase in //g//: Tissue restructures itself into neutron degenerate matter. 
* Decrease in //e//: Tissue maintains loose integrity as a cloud of ions, regenerates upon reestablishment of normal laws of physics.
* Decrease in //Theta//: Tissue disintegrates.

**Termination Test Record:**
SCP-682's containment tank inserted into SCP-536. Speed of light, strong nuclear force and fundamental charge dials decreased progressively. 682's containment tank is nearly immediately destroyed, and 682's body begins disintegrating.  Due to intense light and radiation, visual is lost. Free neutrons, pions, kaons and more exotic mesons (described in [REDACTED]) are detected. 55s into the experiment, the primary detection equipment fails.
Upon bootup of the secondary detection equipment, dials are at minimum levels. 682 is again visible in the chamber, reduced to roughly 1% of its normal size. Analysis suggests 682 has reformed into a previously unknown form of matter, kept together by quantum effects.
Asst. Researcher ███████ becomes aggressive and turns the dials randomly and violently before being removed from the premises. 682 recovers its original shape upon restoration of standard physics.

//Note: I don't blame him. I could swear, at one point, that thing looked like it was actually enjoying the experience.//

SCP-524 and SCP-682 introduced into testing chamber. SCP-682 examines SCP-524 suspiciously, at which point SCP-524 begins gnawing on SCP-682's anterior right limb. SCP-682 jumps backward, bellowing. SCP-524 pursues SCP-682 for two minutes, at which point SCP-682 climbs four (4) meters up the wall of the testing chamber and is beyond SCP-524's reach. SCP-524 ceases pursuit and begins washing its face with its paws; it continues this activity for 15 minutes, during which time SCP-682 remains 4 meters up the wall and beyond SCP-524's reach.

SCP-524 then crosses to the other side of the test chamber and begins breaching containment. Test aborted.

**Item:** [[[SCP-811]]]

**Tissue Test Record:**
Sample consumed without incident.

**Termination Test Record:**
Direct exposure of SCP-811 to SCP-682 disallowed due to unreasonably high risk of specimen loss. Instead, mucus from SCP-811's palmoplantar surfaces is collected over a course of ██ months, and then sprayed on SCP-682 with high-pressure hoses. SCP-682's body mass is reduced by 27% before the mucus reaches a complete bone covering of the remaining body mass, and is unable to decay it further.

**Item:** [[[SCP-1237]]]

**Tissue Test Record:**
N/A

**Termination Test Record:**
A deliberate containment breach was induced which an SCP-1237-1-L specimen was permitted to observe from a safe distance. Thirteen security personnel were killed before containment was re-established. Subject was dosed with ████████████ to encourage REM sleep and onset of SCP-1237 and instructed to dream that SCP-682 was a small housecat with no special abilities, and that the security team had been able to destroy it easily.
7 seconds after onset of SCP-1237 event, subject began to seize violently. Subject was declared dead after 32 seconds. Autopsy discovered the subject's body covered with scratch and bite marks and infected with bubonic plague, toxoplasmosis, and subacute regional lymphadenitis ("cat scratch fever"). The bodies of the deceased security personnel displayed similar characteristics. A small housecat was found in SCP-682's containment chamber cleaning blood off of its coat; said cat regenerated into SCP-682 within 3 hours.

**Item:** [[[SCP-1361]]]

**Tissue Test Record**:
Sample consumed without incident. DNA markers from SCP-682 present in SCP-1361 sample afterward. Sample showed increased resistance to incineration.

**Termination Test Record**:
A secondary sample of SCP-1361 was allowed to grow to 1,000 kg in mass. SCP-682's containment chamber was purged of acid and SCP-1361 was poured onto SCP-682 from above. SCP-1361 covered and fully engulfed SCP-682 and no activity was observed for 3 hours. In the period from 3 to 7 hours following exposure, SCP-1361 began to develop legs, jaws, and a physical appearance similar to SCP-682. SCP-1361 breached containment and attacked Foundation staff in a manner consistent with an SCP-682 breach and killed 17 personnel. SCP-1361 proved immune to small arms fire in this state; aerial dispersal of napalm was necessary to destroy sample by incineration, after which a skeletal and circulatory system identical to SCP-682 was retrieved from its remains. Remains were returned to SCP-682's containment chamber, where they regenerated into SCP-682 within 6 hours. Subsequent tissue testing indicated that SCP-682 temporarily contained DNA markers from several species present in SCP-1361, as well as temporarily exhibiting a mild scent similar to pork rinds.

**Item:** [[[SCP-1933]]]

**Tissue Test Record**:
Sample immersed in 1 liter of bodily fluids from SCP-1933. Sample fully converted into Irish cream.

**Termination Test Record**: 200 liters of bodily fluids were collected from SCP-1933 over a 3-month period. Fluids were introduced into SCP-682's containment chamber in bulk.

SCP-682 begins consuming fluids rapidly, and manifesting apparent signs of intoxication far more rapidly than a human would after consuming an equivalent amount of Irish cream. This has been hypothesized to be the result of portions of SCP-682's anatomy being transsubstantiated into Irish cream; however, instead of dying, SCP-682 continues consuming the fluids. When it has finished consuming all the fluids, SCP-682 collapses on the floor, and begins loudly vocalizing while clawing spasmodically at its face and abdomen. After 5 minutes of this, SCP-682 begins vomiting up what appears to be the bodily fluids of SCP-1933, but in much larger quantities; as well, the floors and walls of the containment chamber are instantly converted into Irish cream upon contact with the vomitus, resulting in structural failure and containment breach. Test aborted; remainder of vomitus incinerated. SCP-682 subsequently manifests no further signs of intoxication.

**Item:** [[[SCP-507]]]

**Tissue Test Record:** 
N/A

**Termination Test Record:**
SCP-507 was physically attached to SCP-682's left forelimb with nylon zip ties while SCP-682 was inactive due to physical destruction incurred during an unrelated containment breach. Attending personnel continued to spray SCP-682's body, with the exception of the limb to which SCP-507 was attached, with hydrochloric acid provided via high-pressure hoses. After 7 hours and 52 minutes, SCP-507's anomalous properties activated and it and SCP-682 both disappeared. 

SCP-507 remanifested in an unpopulated area adjacent to Site ██, approximately 8,000 kilometers away, 63 hours later, attached to an entity possessing large fangs and a pair of vestigial wings but otherwise identical to SCP-682, by nylon zip ties of a different color than the ones applied by containment personnel at the beginning of the test. A handwritten note was found pinned to SCP-507's chest, reading as follows;

> //Dear Universe 5802-Sigma-Blue-Romeo;//

> //It's __your__ problem now, suckers.//

**Item:** [[[SCP-2599]]]

**Tissue Test Record:** 
N/A

**Termination Test Record:**
SCP-2599 was ordered to attack SCP-682 "until it is 200% dead". SCP-2599 proceeded to engage SCP-682 in combat for 42 minutes, at the end of which three of SCP-682's limbs had been severed, its thorax had been crushed, and both its eyeballs had been ruptured. SCP-2599 then seized SCP-682's head, apparently in preparation for pulling it off of SCP-682's body. In response, SCP-682 vocalized the phrase "KILL ME, YOU SACK OF ORGANS, DO IT."

SCP-2599 immediately released SCP-682, and stood unmoving until security personnel removed it from the testing chamber. Subsequent attempts to terminate SCP-682 before it could regenerate from its injuries were ineffective.

//Note: It is hypothesized that the concrete "kill me" in some way took precedence over the more abstract "attack it until it is 200% dead".//

**Termination Test Record:**
1/22/██, 1500:  SCP-682 temporarily incapacitated via incineration and transferred to a video monitored soundproof containment chamber.

1/22/██, 1600:  SCP-513 introduced to room affixed to robotic arm.

1/22/██, 1630:  SCP-682 regenerates fully.

1/22/██, 1635:  SCP-513 is rung three times via robotic arm, after the first ring, SCP 682 howls and covers its 'ears' (due to the difference of anatomy and lack of visible ears, it can be safely assumed that the motion of covering the sides of its head accomplishes this).

1/22/██, 1636:  SCP-513 and robotic arm retracted from test chamber and returned to containment.

1/22/██, 1640:  SCP-682 uncovers its 'ears' and begins pacing the test chamber.

1/23/██, 1640:  SCP-682 continues pacing.

1/24/██, 1640:  SCP-682 continues pacing.

1/25/██, 1640:  SCP-682 continues pacing.

1/26/██, 1640:  Mass amounts of aerosolized sedatives and tranquilizers introduced to containment chamber via ventilation.

1/26/██, 1645:  SCP-682 loses consciousness.

1/26/██, 1646:  SCP-682 begins sleepwalking.

1/26/██, 1647:  SCP-682 breaches containment.  Hallucinations of a pale, thin, large clawed entity resembling SCP-682 stalking the containment site were reportedly experienced by all present site personnel.  Security footage shows no such entity on site.  Due to mass hysteria, security teams were unable to reestablish containment of SCP-682 and are seen on footage firing repeatedly at walls before being dismembered by thin air.

1/26/██, 1800:  Mobile Task Force Eta-10 ("See No Evil") is deployed, equipped with HUD video enabled enclosed helmets.  SCP-682 is located in SCP-513’s containment cell, still unconscious, curled around SCP-513’s gelatin containment cube.

1/26/██, 1830:  SCP-682 returned to containment and awoken via high pressure HCl spray.  SCP-682 complains that it was having a ‘such a lovely dream’.

//Persistent monitoring and separate testing of both SCP-513 and SCP-682 since the experiment has shown no lasting effects on either object.//

Post testing observation:  Based on what appeared to be an initial adverse reaction from SCP-682, we don’t know if the entity incorporated SCP-513 to itself, or if it worked the other way around.  Either way, in light of the loss of 67% of site staff and 45% of site D-class, requesting that cognitohazardous item testing for SCP-682 be suspended until we understand just what the hell happened here.  - Dr. Kerboros.

Piecemeal analysis of the partial glyph drawn by SCP-682 indicates that while it was a 2140-1-D instance, it contained significant apparent errors that would likely prevent it from functioning. 

Since SCP-682 hasn't deployed these glyphs in the past, it is likely not able to do so and does not pose an immediate ontological threat. It remains possible that it could rediscover the methods of SCP-2140-1 construction.

**Tissue Test Record:** N/A

**Termination Test Record:** An SCP-2305-A instance generated involving SCP-682, and has been transcribed here by order of O5-██.

>  **Item #:** SCP-682
> 
> **Object Class:** Keter
> 
> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** OPERATION FAIL-SAFE-TANGA-34 would be enacted upon successful removal of approximately 90% of SCP-682's body mass, while incapacitated in a space shuttle that has been set to land on the Moon. OPERATION FAIL-SAFE-TANGA-34 consists of the following procedures:
> 
> **1):** 20,200,500,000 RDS-220 hydrogen bombs and 750 [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2195 SCP-2195-1] instances will be transported to the Moon, spread out across the surface. It will be detonated with 10 separate inputs at Site-19. Materials for bombs would be generated from [[[SCP-2400]]] and collected stillbirths for SCP-2195-1 instances.
> 
> **2):** 300 Tilda/Cimmerian Reality Vacuum Attachments have been attached in an hexagonal pattern on the Moon, with approximately 35 km of space between each one. TCRVAs will maintain the explosions occurring on the Moon to prevent any debris from hitting Earth.
> 
> **3):** Area-0-TANGA has been constructed 4,000 km into the Earth and currently houses a large spheroid approximately the size of the Moon, constructed from SCP-2400 materials. [[[SCP-1056]]] will be used to lower the size of the spheroid for easier transportation. 
> 
> **4):** Amnestics would be administered to approximately 80% of the human population after detonation through use of a modified [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2111/offset/1 RED TALISMAN] algorithm to produce non-lethal cognitive hazardous amnestics. Amnestics will be applied to every source of common media, such as newspapers, television, billboards and several popular internet sites.
> 
> 
>  **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** Once the weakened SCP-682 arrived at the Moon's surface, all explosives were detonated. The TCRVAs successfully dampen most of the explosion, causing approximately 150 large meteorites to land on Earth. Spheroid was successfully transported to the Moon's orbit field and grown to its original size. Amnestics were successfully administered to approximately 78% of the Human population. However, 0.03 milliliters of blood belonging to SCP-682 survived the termination attempt, and adapted from it. SCP-682 grows to approximately the size of Saturn, and proceeds to destroy and eat multiple planets within the Solar System.

**Item:** [[[scp-241|SCP-241]]]

**__NOTE__**: Further testing of SCP-241 was required to determine if its anomalous properties allowed it to be used against SCP-682.  Skin tissue was removed from D-class personnel D-682-39, with the tissue then being wrapped around one end of a short steel rod.  D-682-40 used the rod to open SCP-241, manipulating such that only the skin tissue touched SCP-241.  SCP-241 displayed different recipes than when it was previously opened.  D-682-40 prepared one of the recipes, which was then eaten by both D-682-39 and D-682-40. D-682-39 died of anaphylactic shock six minutes later, while D-682-40 showed no ill effects.

SCP-241 was deemed suitable for use against SCP-682.

**Tissue Test Record:** N/A

**Termination Test Record:** SCP-682 tissue sample was affixed to end of a steel rod, and the rod was used by D-682-40 to open SCP-241.  SCP-241 showed different recipes than the previous time it was opened.  Of the 99 recipes, three were in unknown languages, two were incomprehensible "word salad", and one was a memetic kill agent.  Of the remaining 93 recipes, 100% had at least one instruction or ingredient which made it impossible to follow the recipe with complete faithfulness.  Examples include:

* "Chill to -10,000F°  before serving."
* "Garnish with antimatter parsley."
* "Marinate for 900 trillion years."

D-682-41  was tasked with cooking the 93 usable recipes, using SCP-241 plus a "correction sheet" (written by Dr. █████) which replaced impossible ingredients and instructions with the closest feasible analogue, with the results being delivered to SCP-682 containment cell upon completion.  SCP-682 has shown no ill effects after having eaten all 93 meals.

**Tissue Test Record:**
Not attacked by SCP-2617-A instance. 

**Termination Test Record:**
SCP-682 was released in the abandoned village of █████████, Russia via airlift, and proceeded to attack the village. Coordinates were set to correspond with SCP-682's position, thus generating up to █,███ SCP-2617-A instances holding ███ unique variants of SCP-2617-B. SCP-2617-A instances attack SCP-682, destroying up to 45% of its body mass. 

Five hours after the beginning of termination test, SCP-682 released a series of radio waves. SCP-2617-C dissipated, and all SCP-2617-A and SCP-2617-B instances underwent spontaneous sublimation. Personnel supervising the termination test were also exposed to the radio waves. Interviews with these personnel suggest that they are unable to recognise the concept of Russia.

**Item:** [[[SCP-2722]]]

**Tissue Test Record:** N/A

**Termination Test Record:**
SCP-682 exposed to SCP-2722. The wielders of the ship were quickly secured by the use of the ship's lockdown measure, and are ordered to try and use any of the methods available to them in an attempt to terminate 682. With the use of SCP-2722's reality bending ability, the ship is teleported to the ████████-██ star system in the Andromeda Galaxy in the Local Group. SCP-2722's subatomic-destruction sphere is immediately fired at SCP-682, seemingly annihilating the subject, but it was shown to adapt and regenerate overtime. SCP-682 adapts its size in order to match SCP-2722's own, and suddenly attacks the ship at velocities too fast for SCP-2722's radars to detect, throwing the ship off the bounds of the star system and across the galaxy in seconds, with SCP-682 following quickly after. However, the forcefield around SCP-2722 withstands the attack. The wielders are instructed to try and fire 2722's grand wave motion cannon at the subject, which is immediately accomplished by the ship. The beam hits 682's shell and dashes past the galaxy, violently impacting against the constellation of Cassiopeia and reducing it to atomic bonds.

The remnants of SCP-682's body are instructed to be collected by OTF 7 ("Rama Repairmen") as the ship uses the ability of reality bending to return to the Earth. The termination is deemed a failure, as SCP-682 regenerated from the blast approximately [DATA REDACTED] hours later inside its cell.

SCP-682 seemed to be under SCP-012's effects, as it began to claw at itself in an attempt to draw blood, which seemed ineffective. After several minutes, SCP-682's left forearm, back left leg, and approximately 32% of the mass of its main body had been removed before SCP-682 realized the composition could not be completed. SCP-682 then entered a rage state and breached containment, causing ██ casualties before SCP-682 could be recontained.

**Termination Test Record:**
SCP-682 introduced to testing chamber under heavy sedation. SCP-372 introduced to testing chamber. SCP-682 woke up and proceeded to wander the testing chamber, apparently confused. Approximately 10 minutes into the test, SCP-682 expressed sudden distress, implying it had become aware of SCP-372's presence. Exactly 5 minutes later deep lacerations and cuts appeared on SCP-682, eventually reducing 25% of its body mass. SCP-682 emitted loud distressed bellows and started to randomly attack the air in any direction, apparently trying to defend itself against SCP-372. Six minutes after, while still being attacked, SCP-682 is seen to make contact with SCP-372 via its tail, seeming to knock out SCP-372. SCP-682 proceeded to approach SCP-372, before being heavily sedated to prevent the likely loss of SCP-372.
