**Item #:** SCP-545

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**

**Description:** SCP-545 may be determined as three separate parts.

**SCP-545-A** appears to be an elderly woman, presumably of Eastern European descent. 5 ft (1.5 m)in height, and 163 lbs (73.9 kg) in weight, giving her a short, plump build. Her skin, although deeply tanned and heavily lined, it is devoid of blemishes or liver spots otherwise common with age. Her hair is thick and completely white, and past her waist when let down, although 545-A prefer to keep it up in a tight bun. Her eyes, despite her age, are a bright, clear blue and devoid of cataracts or fogginess. She prefers to dress simply, liking very traditional-styled, simple dresses and eyeglasses, although she has no need for them. Despite appearing to be 80+ years old, 545-A is in exceptional health, with no weakening of the heart, bones, or respiratory system, and although of average human strength, even this takes people by surprise for her appearance. Her senses are noted to be above-average and she scores a general 115 on a standard IQ test.
545-A's age and health is considered especially surprising considering that she claims to be over 800 years old, and has yet to be disproved.

**Addendum:**
