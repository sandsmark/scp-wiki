**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**

**Description:** SCP-545 may be determined as three separate parts.

**SCP-545-A** appears to be an elderly woman, presumably of Eastern European descent. 5 ft (1.5 m)in height, and 163 lbs (73.9 kg) in weight, giving her a short, plump build. Her skin, although deeply tanned and heavily lined, it is devoid of blemishes or liver spots otherwise common with age. Her hair is thick and completely white, and past her waist when let down, although 545-A prefer to keep it up in a tight bun.

**Addendum:**
