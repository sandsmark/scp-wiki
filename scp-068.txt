**Item #:** SCP-068

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**
Object is to be kept in an electrically resistant box made preferably of tetrafluoroethene (teflon) and rubber. Said box is to be stored in security locker 26, on Site 11. Key is kept with Dr. Wacey. Any requests for testing are to be redirected to him.

**Description:**
    SCP-068 is an approximately 1.8cm tall wire stick figure, made of an unknown metal. The figure is composed of a single wire looping back to the center. The wire itself appears to have been bent numerous times in multiple places. 
    	
    When an electric current is introduced to the object it begins to animate. 068's "joints" are where a normal human beings would be. Once animated, 068 begins to search for any metals. After a metal has been found, the object will begin to knead it and pull a thin strip of the metal off. 068 will then construct another figure similar to itself. The newly created figure will begin to knead the remaining metal along with the original, creating new figures until the metal runs out. The figures will then move onto the next source of metal until no more can be found. Having exploited all of the metal available, the figures will begin to knead each other. They will form together to create larger and larger figures. The resulting end figure is to be known as SCP-068-1. 068 itself does not participate in this kneading. 068 will then knead itself into the intersection of the arms, torso, and the base of the head of 068-1, remaining distinct from the rest of the figure. Once this has been completed, gamma, beta, and theta waves are detected being emitted from 068. 068-1 will remain animate for 4 minutes and 32 seconds. After such time, 068-1 becomes inanimate, falling to the ground.
    
    SCP-068 is capable of kneading and manipulating any metal presented to it, regardless of properties.
It also seems to be impervious to any attempts to damage or destroy it. Its copies, however, have the same vulnerabilities of whatever metal they were constructed from.

**Addendum 068-a:** A proposal has been made to use 068 to dispose of dangerous metal-based SCP's.

**Addendum 068-b:** //Please see attached document 068-a//

**Document #068-a:** //The proposal to use 068 for disposal of dangerous metal-based SCP's has been denied. Seeing as how many, if not all of our dangerous metal-based SCP's are also invincible, the only thing we would have is a bunch of invulnerable wire figures running about. Honestly, who even thought this up?//
