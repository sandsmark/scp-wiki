**Item #:** SCP-068

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-068 is to be kept in an electrically-resistant box, preferably made of polytetrafluoroethene (teflon) and rubber. Said box is to be stored in security locker 26 at Site 11. Key is kept with Dr. Wacey. Any requests for testing are to be redirected to him.

**Description:** SCP-068 is a wire stick figure, 1.8 cm tall, made of an unknown metal. The figure is composed of a single wire looping back to the center. The wire itself appears to have been bent numerous times in multiple places. 
    	
When an electric current is introduced to SCP-068, it begins to move about on its own. SCP-068's "joints" are where a normal human being's would be. Once animated, SCP-068 begins to search for any metallic material. Once metal has been found, SCP-068 will begin to knead it and pull a thin strip of metal off. SCP-068 will then construct another figure similar to itself. The newly-created figure will begin to knead the remaining metal alongside the original, creating new figures until the metal runs out. The figures will then move onto the next source of metal until no more can be found. 

Once all available metal has been used, the figures will begin to knead each other, forming together to create larger and larger figures, although SCP-068 does not itself participate in this process. This process continues until all figures except the original have been integrated into a single large figure, designated SCP-068-1. SCP-068 will then knead itself into the intersection of the arms, torso, and the base of the head of SCP-068-1, remaining distinct from the rest of the figure. Once this has been completed, gamma, beta, and theta waves start emanating from SCP-068. SCP-068-1 will remain animate for 4 minutes and 32 seconds, after which time, SCP-068-1 becomes inanimate and falls to the ground.
    
SCP-068 is capable of kneading and manipulating any metal presented to it, regardless of properties. It also seems to be impervious to any attempts to damage or destroy it. Copies of SCP-068, however, have the same vulnerabilities as whatever metal they were constructed from.

**Addendum 068-a:** A proposal has been made to use SCP-068 to dispose of dangerous metal-based SCPs.

**Addendum 068-b:** //Please see attached document 068-a//

**Document #068-a:** //The proposal to use 068 for disposal of dangerous metal-based SCPs has been denied. Seeing as how many, if not all, of our dangerous metal-based SCP's are also invincible, the only thing we would have is a bunch of invulnerable wire figures running about. Honestly, who even thought this up?//
