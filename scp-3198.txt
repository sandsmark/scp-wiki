**Item #:** SCP-3198

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Standard Containment Procedures:** At the first available opportunity, contact must be established with SCP-3198 to make it aware of its situation. Once SCP-3198 has confirmed its compliance, it should be contained for transport and moved to a secure site. 

Currently, SCP-3198 is contained in its original discovery location which has been repurposed as Site-1394. Any instances seen outside of Site-1394 are to be contained, or if containment fails, destroyed.

Site-1394's windows have been boarded up under the guise of a lethal asbestos exposure.

Personnel entering Site-1394 must be wearing full tactical body armor. Weapons are not to be discharged at SCP-3198 unless absolutely necessary. 

Research into a way to return SCP-3198 to a normal state is ongoing.

**Description:** SCP-3198 is the collective designation for the Mobile Task Force formerly known as Lambda-9 ("Big Fucking Guns"). This task force was created specifically to contain Keter level objects that required high damage output ordinance in the event of a containment breach. Being one of the largest MTF teams, Lambda-9 is comprised of:

* 100 foot soldiers armed with M4 assault rifles, M249 light machine guns, fragmentation grenades and 2 FGM-148 Javelin missile launchers
* 20 OSHKOSH M-ATV scout vehicles fitted with M2 Browning heavy machine guns
* 2 AH-64 Apache Longbow helicopters with 2 crew members in each
* 30 combat trained support personnel
* 4 M970 fuel trucks carrying Diesel
* 2 OSHKOSH M978A4 Fuel Servicing Trucks carrying JP8 Jet fuel
* 4 MK25 Standard cargo trucks carrying food, water and general supplies

All units (both human and vehicular) of SCP-3198 have been reduced dramatically to a ratio of approximately 1:64 of their original size with a similar reduction in mass. SCP-3198 seems to be aware of having been altered by an anomalous effect but is not aware of specifically what effect has occurred. SCP-3198 is unable to correctly perceive its environment, believing materials, lifeforms and its current location to be anomalous in nature. SCP-3198 is also extremely hostile to almost all lifeforms[[footnote]]Likely due to being attacked by local wildlife as well as its contact with the pest exterminator that discovered SCP-3198.[[/footnote]]. SCP-3198 has begun to consume small invertebrates that inhabit the area surrounding its current location for sustenance despite Foundation attempts to provide SCP-3198 with a more viable food source (which have been met with extreme hostilities from SCP-3198).

Communication with SCP-3198 has so far not been possible. The voices of SCP-3198 members have become extremely high pitched, audible as "squeaking" with some words occasionally being discernible. SCP-3198 speech can only be understood by lowering the pitch and speed on recordings. It is also assumed that normal Human voices cannot be understood by SCP-3198, describing them as a deep booming sound, both in person and via radio contact[[footnote]]Attempts to raise the pitch on recordings of human speech and play them back to SCP-3198 have so far been unsuccessful.[[/footnote]]. 

The vehicles used by SCP-3198 function exactly like their normal sized counterparts though they require significantly less fuel to run. Handheld weapons and weapons attached to both the scout vehicles and attack helicopters are considerably less powerful than their full sized counterparts but are still capable of causing significant damage to structures and living targets[[footnote]]Whilst no human deaths have occurred, 3 personnel have been attacked by SCP-3198 and received life threatening injuries.[[/footnote]].

SCP-3198 largely inhabits the west side of Site-1394's attic, having created a fortified base out of wood, cardboard and insulation. SCP-3198 is able to access the first floor of 1394 by using the sides of the attic's stairs as a ramp, which has allowed the scout vehicles to be driven to the first floor. SCP-3198 has created a small tactical wall using //Jenga Blocks// at the top of the stairs leading from the ground floor. This wall is usually guarded by one scout vehicle containing between 3-4 foot soldiers. 

[[include component:image-block name=matv.jpg|caption=Lambda-9 scout vehicle prior to Incident 682-I]]

MTF-Lambda-9 was last active during a containment breach of SCP-682 (See Incident-682-I). This breach had occurred after an attempt to shrink 682 to a manageable size using SCP-1056. En route to ██████████ ████████ ████, SCP-682 ambushed Lambda-9, expelling a wave of unknown energy[[footnote]]Believed to be a manifestation of SCP-1056's anomalous effect however SCP-3198 shows no adverse effects associated with resizing via SCP-1056.[[/footnote]]. Contact was lost; all units of MTF-Lambda-9 were presumed KIA.

SCP-3198 was discovered 4 days later, 2 kilometers from the location of Incident 682-I[[footnote]]It is not currently known how SCP-3198 ended up in this location.[[/footnote]] after agents responded to an incident at what is now Site-1394. The prior residents of 1394 had reported to a local pest exterminator of hearing "buzzing" and "scratching" coming from the attic, assuming the noise to be caused by wasps. When the exterminator investigated, they were attacked by SCP-3198. The exterminator sprayed pesticides over a small portion of SCP-3198's fortification before exiting the attic and contacting local authorities. The Foundation then took over control of the property to contain SCP-3198.

The following is the transcript of radio contact between MTF-Lambda-9 and Task Force Control during Incident-682-I. Lambda-9's order were to head to ██████████ ████████ ████ and set up a Forward Operations Base from which units could be sent to re-contain SCP-682:

The following is a log of Incident-3198-A. The log is a transcription of events captured by Site-1394 video feeds on 25/06/████. Video footage is captured on Camera 4 which is situated on the west side of 1394's roof, just outside SCP-3198's location[[footnote]]It is theorised 0582 was relaying information back to SCP-3198 about the surrounding area.[[/footnote]]:

> <10:14:25> Attack Helicopter 0582 is seen to depart Site-1394 through a hole in the roof.
> 
> <10:14:31> 0582 proceeds to slowly turn 180 degrees before flying alongside the roof for approximately 40 centimetres. 
> 
> <10:15:15> 0582 proceeds back inside Site-1394.
> 
> <10:25:38> 0582 departs Site-1394 again. A Blackbird can be seen approximately 1.3 metres from 0582. The Blackbird slowly approaches 0582.
> 
> <10:25:51> 0582 turns to face the blackbird as it flies towards 0582. 0582 discharges its main gun at the blackbird, killing it. 
> 
> <10:26:23> 0582 hovers in places for 15 seconds before moving south of Site-1394.
> 
> <10:26:59> A number of seagulls fly towards 0582 from the roof of Site-1394 and attack 0582 off camera. 0582 reappears on camera shortly before one of the seagulls destroys 0582's tail. 0582 then falls and hits the ground resulting in its destruction.

What remained of 0582 was recovered by Foundation personnel shortly after the incident. 

Foundation personnel outside of Site-1394 at the time were unaware of this incident. When questioned, they advised that the seagulls had been seen but due to 0582's size, it had not been seen, assuming the birds were fighting over food. 0582 was only noticed after it exploded upon impact with the ground. 

The hole SCP-3198 breached containment through has since been sealed.

The following is a transcript from 20/06/████ where researchers attempted to re-establish communication with SCP-3198 after it was discovered.

++ __Log-3198-B__

On 28/06/████, Foundation communications analysts based at Site-1386 recorded a brief interchange between 2 instant message devices located at Site-1394. The devices were in use by SCP-3198. It was not known prior to this event that any members of MTF-Lambda-9 had been equipped with such devices when deployed during Incident-682-I[[footnote]]Investigation into how this went unnoticed is ongoing.[[/footnote]]. The recording of this conversation is below:

+ Addendum 3198-3: Recovered media

On 30/06/████ a scout vehicle was captured by Foundation personnel after the main weapon had been disabled. Inside the vehicle were 4 foot Soldiers later identified as Private Lang, Private Pimm, Sergeant Emmerson and Corporal Betson. As Foundation personnel were lifting the vehicle to remove the occupants, all 4 jumped from the vehicle resulting in their deaths. 

Upon later inspection of the bodies, a Mobile Task Force field document was found in Betson's clothing with a letter having been written on the back. Due to the size of the item, a microscope was required to view it. Below are transcriptions of both sides of the document:
