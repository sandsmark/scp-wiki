**Item #:** SCP-224

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Item SCP-224 is to be stored in a soundproof enclosure with acoustic destructive interference nodes. Nodes must be replaced on a weekly basis by remote means due to the erratic nature of SCP-224’s effect; non Class-D personnel are not to enter the enclosure.  Additionally, SCP-224’s enclosure must be kept free from moisture to avoid rapid oxidation.

**Description:** SCP-224 is a wooden grandfather clock, accented with a black lacquer and gold leaf.  Markings remotely observed date its origin at the end of the 19th century.  Though internal examination of its components has been done, the density and construction of its gears make method of function impossible to interpret.  

The hands of the clock do not move with any known consistency, though the tendency seems to be generally clockwise. Additionally, chimes occur at non-regular intervals, ranging from approximately one minute to several months.  To further complicate matters, the numbers on the clock also have a tendency to move and shift, though they generally retain ascending order.

In the event that the clock begins to chime, all personnel must evacuate the area, and the location should secured following procedure █████.   Each chime has an anomalous acoustic signature that causes a drastic localized temporal acceleration. People and objects in range of the sound begin to age.  The amount of time is not consistent with the chimes, ranging from essentially inconsequential amounts to several years, though the amount aged during any single event is consistent for all objects within the field of effect.

The enclosure and the acoustic nodes dampen this effect to negligible levels within the facility, but the nodes must be replaced often due to the artifact's effects.

SCP-224 was originally found in the ████ ████ Antique Shop and purchased by Mr. ████ ██████████ as a gift for his wife.  When brought home and wound, the anomalous properties were noticed, though not acted upon, both apparently considering the object broken.  Their bodies were discovered in their collapsed house two days later, aged significantly.  Foundation personnel monitoring ██████ took interest, and SCP-224 was subsequently recovered.  Agents ███████ and █████ were unfortunately [DATA REDACTED].

//Any instances of SCP-224 retaining any numeric pattern for an extended period should be reported to O5-█.  Failure to do so will result in suspension and possible demotion.//
