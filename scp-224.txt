**Item #:** SCP-224

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Item SCP-224 is to be stored in a soundproof enclosure with acoustic destructive interference nodes. Nodes must be replaced on a monthly basis by remote means; personnel are not to enter the enclosure until a safe method of close study is developed.

**Description:** SCP-224 appears to be a black and gold grandfather clock. Its hands do not move with any known consistency, and chimes occur at non-regular intervals ranging from approximately one minute to several months. The chimes have an anomalous acoustic signature that causes a drastic local temporal acceleration. Objects in range age centuries in a matter of seconds. The enclosure and the acoustic nodes dampen this effect to negligible levels within the facility, but the nodes must be replaced often due to the artifact's effects.

**Addendum:** Personnel are not to enter the enclosure. These precautions have been put in place since the regrettable incident wherein facility personnel were present when the artifact's properties first manifested.

Dr. ████████ has requested permission to attempt the termination of SCP-682 using SCP-224; ████████ believes that the extreme aging might prevail in destroying the creature where all other attempts have failed. Conversely, Dr. ███ suggests that not enough is known of SCP-682, and that its powers might increase with age. The request is currently pending approval from the ████████.

SCP-224 has also been found useful in negating the effects of SCP-333.
