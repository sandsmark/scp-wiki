**Item #:** SCP-1270

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Entrance into SCP-1270 is forbidden except for approved test subjects, although only entrance to the third floor creates a present threat. As a security measure, the SCP Foundation has purchased office spaces adjacent to the location, allowing covert monitoring. If monitoring agents hear shots or unusual noises from the SCP, suggesting a disruption, stabilization of the surrounding area takes priority.

**Description:** SCP-1270 is an office building in █████████, constructed in 1979, and currently owned by the Foundation under a subsidiary company. It was originally built and deserted by the [REDACTED] corporation and left vacant for 15 years. 

At some point during the vacant period, Entity SCP-1270-1 began manifesting whenever the building became occupied. SCP-1270-1 is visually identical to a human, specifically a human male carrying a shotgun, except that it does not exist when the building is not occupied. Infrared and motion-sensing cameras confirm this. When the building is empty, it may be present somewhere else, or cease to exist altogether. (See Document 1270-411: "Alternate Hypotheses.")

When a human enters the building, and uses the elevator, stairs, or other method to reach the third floor, SCP-1270-1 will attempt to shoot them to death, pursuing them to other parts of the building if necessary. It has a high rate of accuracy.

**Addendum A:** As a test, a remotely operated robot (equipped with camera) was sent into the building and onto the third floor. SCP-1270-1 appeared from a doorway, and fired, hitting non-critical portions of the robot. This allowed it to send several pictures to the ground team. Within several seconds, the entity shot out the camera's lens, and contact was lost.

The photos included clear shots of SCP-1270-1 wearing distressed camouflage clothing and carrying a Mossberg 500 shotgun, suggesting a military connection. When compared to database pictures, however, the recovered likeness produced no matches.

The other object of interest in any of the recovered photos was of several empty food cans inside the doorway from which SCP-1270-1 appeared. No signs of habitation have been observed before or since.
