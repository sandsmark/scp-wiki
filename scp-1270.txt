**Item #:** SCP-1270

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Entrance into SCP-1270 is prohibited. As a security measure, the SCP Foundation has purchased office spaces adjacent to the location, allowing covert monitoring. If monitoring agents hear shots or unusual noises from the SCP, suggesting a disruption, stabilization of the surrounding area is a priority.

**Description:** SCP-1270 is an office building in █████████, currently owned by the Foundation under a subsidiary company, originally deserted by the [REDACTED] corporation and left vacant for 15 years. At some point during the vacant period, Entity SCP-1270-1 began manifesting whenever the building became occupied. SCP-1270-1 is visually identical to a human, specifically a human male carrying a rifle, except that it does not exist when the building is not occupied. Infrared and motion-sensing cameras confirm this.

When a human enters the building, and uses the elevator, stairs, or other method to reach the third floor, SCP-1270-1 will appear attempt to shoot them to death. The entity has never ran out of ammunition thus far and has good aim.

**Addendum A:** As a test, a remotely operated robot equipped with camera was sent into the building and sent to the third floor. SCP-1270-1 appeared from a doorway, and fired at non-critical portions of the robot, allowing it to send several pictures to the ground team. Within several seconds, the entity shot out the camera's lens, and contact was immediately lost.

The photos included clear shots of SCP-1270-1 wearing camouflage clothing and carrying a Mossberg 500 shotgun, suggesting a military connection. When compared to database pictures, however, the recovered likeness produced no matches.

The other object of interest in any of the recovered photos was of several empty food cans inside the doorway from which SCP-1270-1 appeared. No signs of habitation have been observed before or since.
