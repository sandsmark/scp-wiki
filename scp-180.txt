**Item #:** SCP-180
 
**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**  All head wear (including hairclips and bows) are restricted in Reliquary Research and Containment Site-76 for all outside security.  Anyone violating this rule is subject to complete physical search, auditing of travel within Site-76 and DNA identity testing.
 
SCP-180 is not to leave its research laboratory.  The current appearance of SCP-180 is to be reported to Security daily.  Security is to be notified immediately should personnel encounter someone they don't recognize in their department, performing or dressed as if they belonged there (as their identity might have been stolen).

 
**Description:**  SCP-180 is a hat that appears to take various forms depending upon the subject wearing it.  This ability is thought to be related to the effect of putting on SCP-180.  Seemingly at random, any individual who places SCP-180 on their head risks having their identity 'stolen' by the hat.  The effect is that when SCP-180 is placed upon any other subject's head, the identity of the first subject (host) is imprinted on the second subject.  This is possible not only for people, but for animals and inanimate objects.  For example, subjects have mistaken dogs, statues and coffee tables for the host of SCP-180 when the hat is placed on these objects.
 
The original host who had their identity stolen, will for a time be unrecognizable to people who knew him or her.  Friends and family will not be able to acknowledge the individual as the person they once knew.  Instead, people are only able to give a vague impression of the person in their presence; hair and eye color, skin tone and clothing.  Identity-less hosts are unable to convince others of their true identity.  The effect lasts until SCP-180 randomly selects a new host.

[[/div]]SCP-180 changes its appearance when it changes hosts, however, the effect is only visual.  The object has appeared as a top hat, a skull cap, a baseball cap, a bandanna, a hair clip, a hajib, a motorcycle helmet, and more.  In reality, imaging using MRI and 3D ultrasound has shown that SCP-180 is nothing more than a worn length of linen or cloth resembling a nun's habit, veil or shroud.  Placing SCP-180 on the head properly actually covers the face.  Research has been unable to explain how and why radiation (visual and infrared) are manipulated by SCP-180 to produce false images.

**Addendum:  Acquisition:** The first verified account of SCP-180 occurred in the mid 19██s when it was discovered belonging to a high school student.  The student claims that in an effort to become more noticeable at school, he purchased SCP-180 at a yard sale, thinking he was buying a used fedora.  Regardless of its affect on his popularity the first day, he found that to his dismay, not even his own parents recognized him when he took the hat off.  His experiences with SCP-180 fueled his fevered interest in the paranormal.  Though his popularity at school never increased, his interest led him to the SCP Organization where he excelled, grew in stature and today he is now known as [DATA EXPUNGED].
