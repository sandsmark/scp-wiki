title:Object Classes
[[tabview]]
[[tab Overview]]
[[f>toc]]
All anomalous objects, entities, and phenomena requiring Special Containment Procedures are assigned an Object Class for purposes of research priority, budgeting, and other considerations. The class assigned to an object is generally determined by a number of factors, but most importantly by a combination of its difficulty to contain as well as the danger posed to Foundation personnel and humanity at large.

A particular anomaly's classification is subject to update and modification as research and our understanding of the object, entity, or phenomenon improves.

+ Primary Classes

These are the most common Object Classes assigned to anomalies, and make up the bulk of the Foundation's database.

++ Safe

Safe-class objects are those anomalies that are either sufficiently understood that they are now completely and reliably contained on a permanent basis or otherwise do not trigger their anomalous effects unless intentionally activated.

Classifying an anomaly as Safe, however, does not mean that handling or activating it does not pose a threat, and personnel are to be reminded that all Special Containment Procedures and safety protocols are to be observed at all times.

++ Euclid

Euclid-class objects are anomalies that are either insufficiently understood or inherently unpredictable, such that reliable containment is not always possible, but do not pose sufficient threat to qualify for Keter classification. The vast majority of anomalies cataloged and contained by the Foundation are initially classified as Euclid until they are either sufficiently understood or exhibit sufficient danger to qualify for reclassification.

In particular, any anomaly that exhibits [/system:page-tags/tag/autonomous autonomy], [/system:page-tags/tag/sentient sentience] and/or [/system:page-tags/tag/sapient sapience] is generally classified a Euclid-class entity at minimum, due to the inherent unpredictability of an object that can act or think on its own.

++ Keter

Keter-class objects are anomalies that pose an inimical threat to the safety of Foundation personnel and the rest of mankind and either require extensive and complex procedures to contain or cannot be fully contained by the Foundation's current technology and knowledge.

These anomalies are generally considered the most dangerous ones in Foundation containment, and all research efforts are directed towards enabling more reliable containment of such anomalies or, as a last resort, the timely neutralization or destruction of its anomalous effects.

+ Secondary Classes

The following Object Classes are sub-classes that supplement the object's primary (or former) classification.

++ Neutralized

Neutralized anomalies are those that are no longer anomalous, either through having been intentionally or accidentally destroyed, disabled, or otherwise no longer function or exhibit anomalous effects.

The documentation for Neutralized anomalies is archived for posterity in case the anomaly regains its anomalous properties or otherwise recurs in the future.

++ Explained

[[[scp-ex|Explained]]] anomalies are those that are completely and fully understood to the point where their effects are now explainable by mainstream science, have been debunked as a false or mistaken classification, or are so widespread and publicly disseminated such that containment is no longer possible.

+ Esoteric Classes

The following Object Classes fall outside of the purview of standard classification.

++ Thaumiel

Thaumiel-class objects are highly classified and extremely rare anomalies that are utilized by the Foundation to contain or counteract the effects of other highly dangerous anomalies, especially Keter-class objects. Even the mere existence of Thaumiel-class objects is classified at the highest levels of the Foundation and their locations, functions, and current status are known to few Foundation personnel outside of the O5 Council.

[[tab Writing Guide]]
**[[size 120%]]What is an Object Class?[[/size]]**
An Object Class is a part of the [[[how-to-write-an-scp|standard SCP template]]] and a rough indicator of an object's difficulty to contain and danger posed.

**[[size 120%]]What is the Locked Box Test?[[/size]]**
The Locked Box Test is an informal guideline used to determine an object's most appropriate Object Class. It goes like this:

* If you lock it in a box, leave it alone, and nothing bad will happen, then it's probably **Safe**.
* If you lock it in a box, leave it alone, and you're not entirely sure what will happen, then it's probably **Euclid**.
* If you lock it in a box, leave it alone, and all hell breaks loose, then it's probably **Keter**.

As of the inclusion of Thaumiel as a generally accepted Object Class, the following has also been appended to the Locked Box Test:

* If it //is// the box, then it's probably **Thaumiel**.

Note that as a special consideration, something that is autonomous, alive, and/or sapient is almost always //at least// Euclid-class. That is, if you lock a living thing in a box and forget about it, it will eventually suffocate or starve to death, and that's not a good outcome. Something that is intelligent could also end up being smart enough to outwit our containment procedures and/or stop cooperating with our attempts to contain it, making it more dangerous than it otherwise might be.

**[[size 120%]]What is Thaumiel, anyways?[[/size]]**

First introduced in [[[roget-s-proposal|SCP-001: Keter Duty]]] and most famously used in [[[SCP-2000]]], [/system:page-tags/tag/thaumiel Thaumiel]-class objects are considered "Super-Keter" or "Anti-Keter" objects, ones that are either capable of containing or counteracting Keter-class objects or dealing with the aftermath of an uncontrolled Keter-class containment breach either by retroactively altering history or otherwise "resetting" reality such that the disaster never occurred.

As with all parts of the Foundation narrative, selective canon means that you do not necessarily have to address the existence of any particular piece thereof. Many authors choose not to believe in Thaumiel-class objects, and you are free to write with or without the implications of their existence.

**[[size 120%]]What is a Decommissioned object?[[/size]]**

Decommissioned SCPs are a non-canon Object Class that was used by senior staff in the past to not only delete unwanted articles but place them in a sort of "Wall of Shame" to serve as examples of what not to do.

Decommissioning articles is generally not done anymore, partly because such heavy-handed edits by SCP staff are no longer done and partly because decommissioning ended up backfiring. See the [[[History of the Universe Hub]]] for more historical information about Decommissioned SCPs and their usage in the past.

**[[size 120%]]What about other Object Classes?[[/size]]**

It is highly recommended that objects use one of the standard Object Classes listed here. While some authors choose to introduce exceptions to these rules, they are only very rarely done and are considered a form of "[[[mackenzie-glossary|format screw]]]", and thus need to justify their existence and placement. Many site members will downvote for non-standard Object Classes if used without merit.

**[[size 120%]]What if I find an SCP that is the wrong Object Class?[[/size]]**

The Object Classes are intentionally left vague as to not limit the author's creative freedom; a rigid, defined system of classes might hinder an author's ability to write the way they would want to, and as such multiple proposals to create better-defined systems in the past have been turned down by SCP Wiki staff.

If you find an SCP article that you feel might be inappropriately classified, feel free to raise discussion on the topic and see what other community members think. If the explanation is not to your satisfaction, then feel free to express your opinion on the matter and vote accordingly on the page.
