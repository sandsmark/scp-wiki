++ Welcome to Site 234's Internal database. Credentials recognized, Access Approved.

**Current Site Director:** Co-Directors Dr. and Dr. Andrews

**Head of Security:** Agent  ██████

**Head of Research:** Dr.  Regina ██████

**Resident MTF:** Chi-7 "Plague Tamers"

**Description** Site 234 is one of the Foundations youngest facilities, having been constructed in the fall of 1983. Site 234 serves as a center for research and containment of Micro, Molecular, and Biochemical anomalies, and was constructed with 13 separate BSL-4 and 26 BSL-3 laboratories, as well as more than 200 BSL-2 facilities. Site 234 currently houses more than 200 contained anomalies, 1000 personnel that live on site, and another 8000 that commute to site 234 from the major city of Birmingham, Alabama. 

Site 234 serves as a leading source of biomedical research for the Foundation, pioneering medicinal compounds in use by many Foundation medical personnel which have yet to be leaked to the public. Next to site 19, site 234 is one of the foundation's largest facilities, and is expected to grow larger in the near future as the number of small scale biological anomalies increases. For further information on wings, site layout, and topography please consult our secure facility dossier.

[[tab Profile Dr. and Dr. Andrews]]

**Name:** Dr. Leep and Dr. Sherry Andrews.

**Age:** 29 and 25 respectively.

**Marrital status:** Married to each other.

**Degrees:** PhD's in Virology and Immunology

**Clearance Level:** Level 4

**Description:** Dr. Leep and Dr. Sherry Andrews are the current Co-directors of Site 234 after the site founder, Dr. Reginald Star, retired from his position after serving as director for 31 years. Dr. Leep and Dr. Sherry are foremost experts in their respective fields, having both risen through the Foundations ranks by exhibiting a strong consistent work ethic, a thorough understanding of the anomalies and their respective dangers, and groundbreaking discoveries for the biomedical fields. 

Dr. Leep and Dr. Sherry currently split responsibility as deemed by the regional oversight committees, having determined that that their relative strengths and weakness offset each other in a manner that makes them an effective administrative team. Further information can be found on their respective profile pages.

[[tab MTF Chi-7 "Plague Tamers"]]

**MTF Chi-7 "Plague Tamers":** Chi-7 is a specialized hybrid Mobile Task Force responsible for combating, containing, and undercover investigation of anomalies related to the fields of micro and molecular biology, and biochemistry. Due to overlaps with MTF Beta-7, Chi-7 is often deployed for small scale control of anomalous viral/bacterial/protozoan epidemics, as well as containment of large scale microscopic organisms.

Chi-7 is broken into 3 subdivisons:
* Chimera 1: Composed of five, 6 man combat teams for tactical insertion when combating hostile biological entities or known GoI's responsible for anomalous outbreaks. 
* Chimera 2: Composed of three, 8 man squads of researchers, engineers and highly trained security personnel responsible for design and deployment of containment procedures in the field.
* Chimera 3: 15 small 3 man groups deployed as undercover physicians, researchers, engineers, and occult members as needed.
