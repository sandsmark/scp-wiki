**Current Site Director:** Co-Directors Dir. and Dir. Andrews

**Head of Security:** Agent  ██████

**Head of Research:** Dr.  Regina ██████

**Resident MTF:** Chi-7 "Plague Tamers"

**Description** Site 234 is one of the Foundations youngest facilities, having been constructed in the fall of 1983. Site 234 serves as a center for research and containment of Micro, Molecular, and Biochemical anomalies, and was constructed with 13 separate BSL-4 and 26 BSL-3 laboratories, as well as more than 200 BSL-2 facilities. Site 234 currently houses more than 200 contained anomalies, 1000 personnel that live on site, and another 8000 that commute to site 234 from the major city of Birmingham, Alabama. 

Site 234 serves as a leading source of biomedical research for the Foundation, pioneering medicinal compounds in use by many Foundation medical personnel which have yet to be leaked to the public. Next to site 19, site 234 is one of the foundation's largest facilities, and is expected to grow larger in the near future as the number of small scale biological anomalies increases. For further information on wings, site layout, and topography please consult our secure facility dossier.

[[collapsible show=">Show Author Commentary SCP-2378" hide="Hide Commentary"]]
Where do I even begin with 2378? The beginning I guess. So, after the success of Overly Large //E. coli// I found myself in a bit of a conundrum. How do I follow up a successful first SCP? Do I continue on the logical path with Microbiology? Do I tread outside my comfort zone? It's pretty obvious, in hindsight, that I was going to continue with the same extremely technical and detailed approach that I hit in just the right way with 2946. 

So where did the idea come from? Well, that's a little tough to say to be honest. I had kind of wanted to make a giant SCP which would become a hub for future anomalies, a sort of microbiological SCP generator if you will, but it had to be something where it's obvious the effects of the parts will be so radically different from the origin point that the reader is like "Ok, yeah that's new." So, continuing with the same avenue of thought with 2946, I went for large scale microbiology, except this time a human digestive system scaled up by 5 orders of magnitude. It took some time to nail the details down, to trim and clip extraneous information, not as much as 2946 mind you, but still. When I posted, I was quite surprised by the response, and the accumulation of votes over time. For awhile, it was my second highest scp, until 2491 came along.
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=">Show Author Commentary 2946" hide="Hide Author Commentary"]]
It would be a lie for me to say that 2946 was truly my first SCP idea, though it definitely wasn't my last. In reality, I had another draft, and another concept that I was looking at and working on. I ended up scraping that draft due to mixed feedback and the controversial nature of the subject on which the concept was based. Ultimately, I think abandoning the concept was a good move on my part. 

The fallback concept centered around something I hadn't noticed a lot of on the wiki. There are a great number of articles here, many of them interesting, which address things of the microscopic nature. However, the majority of them are based around anomalous infectious disease, especially highly communicable and strange diseases. This gave me a rather odd idea, what if the Foundation found a model bacterial Organism, like //Escherichia coli// that was absurdly large, to the point that it violates many of the basic principles we know about possible cell sizes. From there I utilized my in depth knowledge and experience working with //E. coli// in the lab to construct a highly detailed and technical set of containment procedures, outlining how the organism is to be contained, how it's maintained and propagated, and how the Foundation takes advantage of it's size and metabolic properties to move it's medical research forward. 

The current 2946 is about the 5th iteration of the article. The first couple were heavily drowned in biological terminology and technical terms, and ultimately I probably trimmed 3 times the articles current length out. From that point, I began attempting to weave some sort of narrative, and fell into the "Rogue researcher does something nuts category" before ultimately scrapping that narrative line. The final iteration came about when minmin suggested I go for the hyper mutation route, and with //E. coli's// properties I was able to make it sufficiently work, and now it's my second highest rated Article.

[[collapsible show=">Show Author Commentary 2431" hide="Hide Author Commentary"]]

This article has a relatively special place in my heart, and my collection as the first piece I wrote for the site that had a narrative. It's one of my lower rated articles, and that remains relatively disappointing as I feel it has a strong emotional centerpiece.

With that said, as I look back over it, there are certain weak points in the structure and style that I may go back and fix one day. This was the first of several SCPs inspired by in chat shenanigans, and the first Idea that Shaggydredlocks encouraged me to pursue. Fortunately, it paved the way for some of my better articles.

[[collapsible show=">Show Author Commentary SCP-2381" hide="Hide Author Commentary"]]

Alright, lets be real for a second. 2381 is mediocre. People in chat tell me its great, and not to delete it, but that's not why it is still on the main list. Its there as a reminder to myself that rushing a concept, and rushing execution don't work out well. This is also the primary reason I don't rewrite it, because it's an example to myself and to other writers that "This is the bare minimum." 

So, the idea originally came from chat, and is infamous known as Keter Mushroom Dicks. The basic premise of the article is that a giant fungus beneath Niche France gains sapience at some point along the way, and becomes convinced that the Trees of western europe are in a dick measure contest with it. Essentially, the fungus begins pumping out yeast spores which infect, and turn humans into Mushroom forests. Its not a bad concept, my execution of it at the time was just...sub par. It doesn't help that I rushed it.

[[collapsible show=">Show Author Commentary SCP-1347-1353-J" hide="Hide Author Commentary"]]

Lets talk about Yerry for a moment. This is my only -J article, though it arguable that 2491 and 3500 would have been appropriate as -J's, this is the only article in my collection that I believe could only have been executed in this manner. Unlike a great number of -J's about "Hahaha common trope of person is funny but also really shitty towards the other party" I wanted to turn the shitty roomate trope onto its head. So how did I do that? I made the roommate a giant goddamn bacteria.

Content wise, this was one of the most enjoyable pieces to write. Every line, and every joke work to paint a ridiculous image of a giant //Yersinia pestis// behaving in the most absurd, and jawdropping way possible. As much as I loathe 049 and 008 as articles, I believe their use here is an accurate portrayal of how comedically bad/ they've aged. 

Among my favorite lines written, is the last bullet point addressing Yerry's habits with his significant other. 

"Moans at the pitch of a clarinet during amorous activities."

[[collapsible show=">Show Author Commentary SCP-2491" hide="Hide Author Commentary"]]

When I look back at what I've written for the wiki so far, there are one or two things that stand out for each article, some of them are things I did really really well, some of them I did really really poorly, and some of them are just examples of middle of the road competent writing. 

Throw all of that shit out the window with this piece. 2491 is as close as I've gotten to writing a "perfect" article for myself. Every line, every little piece of description is carefully placed, and constructed to maximize the "WHAT THE FUCK DID I JUST READ" effect. It's a perfect storm of absurd, creepy human-hybrid insect imagery, and cheesy dialogue serving as a facade for a weird and disturbing ritual. 

After my first five articles, I slowed down and got busy at work. Shaggydredlocks, the man with a million concepts at any given time, suggested I write a Hive of James Bonds. The first couple drafts pitched either too far to the Bond side, or too far into the Bee stuff. I ran into some speed bumps, both writing and work wise, and decided to take a break, and let the concept Ruminate. When I came back around to it 3 weeks later, I just started writing and editing, and before I knew it, I had crafted together something beautiful. 2491 currently has the second most comments among my articles, and the majority are people's jaws hanging open.

Now, 2491 has a problem in that its almost too predictable. I understand some of the comments regarding that, but the predictability isn't because its /actually/ predictable, its because the article has an inherent internal logic. Without that internal logic, the concept doesn't work. It's just a random assortment of Bee behaviors and Bond things thrown together.

[[collapsible show=">Show Author Commentary SCP-2546" hide="Hide Author Commentary"]]

Of everything I've written, this, and it's sole accompanying tale, are pieces that make me somewhat bitter. I spent quite a bit of time writing and honing the material in this article, ended up deleting and reposting it 2 times. There are definitely issues with this piece, and in some respects, I understand the dislike of its angle of horror. Loss of sense of self is fairly terrifying, and I'm just not sure I ever properly executed it. The tables are sadistic, and I think that is where the piece shines best. Ultimately, the idea for 3500 originated here.

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=">Show Author Commentary SCP-2497" hide="Hide Author Commentary"]]

I honestly don't know what to say about 2497. It was an absolute blast to write, and it took about 30 minutes to do so. The fact that this article is still on the mainlist and at //+50// is astounding to me, because the entire article is just one bizarre thing after another. If I had not written it, you sat me down in front of the article, told me to read it and I did, I would ask what kind of drugs were you on when you wrote this. 

I think, like 2491, 2497 exemplifies that the Foundation encounters and contains some //weird// fucking shit. Angry Christmas cactus's that turn people into Plasticine Christmas trees while they are on the toilet? The Foundation containing the Cacti by attaching Christmas stockings? The Plasticine trees attracting //more// of the cacti? It's just a caucophony of weird, silly, and bizarre that just works. I think, if nothing else, timing was probably the reason 2497 is only at +54. Posting right before the start of the 3000 contest was a really poor decision on my part.

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=">Show Author Commentary SCP-3456" hide="Hide Author Commentary"]]

Ok, I'll start off by saying, I'm not good at horror writing. 

Ha. This is a horror site, and you're not good at horror writing? Why the fuck are you here?

Sorry to say it, but the days of the site being solely horror are long gone. With that said, 3456 is the only article among my collection that falls within the horror genre in the truest sense of the word. 3456 is a classic, movie monster type entry based on the Orcadian Myth of Nuckelavees. By all accounts, its current rating is a result of the 3000 contest. I originally had no intentions of entering the contest, but users within chat continually pushed me to do so. 

I'd been toying, for quite some time, with writing the Nuckelavee as a cryptid, and had even talked to Rimple several times about utilizing one of his project "Areas" to contain it. The 3000 contest changed it, and I had to adapt the idea to be more horror based. So what came of it? Well, the article before you now. 3456 has one of my favorite pieces of personal writing in the WWI vignette logs. They paint a picture of how terrifying it would be to have some ancient, demonic centaur standing in no mans land watching, taunting, and stalking you. 

I won't talk about the incident log because I have mixed feelings in that regard. 3456 was a serious change in the direction I was writing. I was no longer writing SCPs to get them up on the mainlist. I was now writing to tell stories, and paint a fleshed out, coordinated world. 3456 was the foundational building block for the canon I'm now building.

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=">Show Author Commentary SCP-3500" hide="Hide Author Commentary"]]

You see the title, and you stop. You can't help but think, "WTF". And then you realize, its clickbait.

3500 is one of those weird, controversial pieces of writing that makes you stop and ask "Why." I'm here to ask "Why not?" A lot of criticism of the concept comes at the article's heavy focus on specifically Ralph Roget, Site Admin Roget's author avatar. It's a fairly valid piece of criticism in that the article utilizes Roget's own articles, and twists them so that it appears that each time he posts an article, manifestations of the article's anomaly in the visage of an additional Ralph Roget appear. 

This is the surface level appearance, and in actuality is a cover plot for the real theme of the article, which is that a combination of in universe meddling via the pataphysics division, and the out of universe Wikiwalk, an effort to link articles to other similar articles in the same vein as TV tropes, are causing all the canons to crunch down upon one another, creating ruptures through which other canonical versions of characters and author avatars leak through. The situation gets worse with each article by big name authors, and is leading towards a single completely flat canon. Most of the //actual// narrative in the article was written by Rimple, as Pataphysics and operation OverMeta were his babies.

As A Random Day said, ultimately leading to the articles title, "This is so much meta wankery you might as well rip your own dick off."

[[collapsible show=">Show Author Commentary SCP-3700" hide="Hide Author Commentary"]]

Everyone has coveted spots within the Mainlist that they want. The fact that I have two of the 00 articles in Series IV is pretty cool, but whats even more satisfying for me is that one of them is arguably my best piece of writing on the Site. 

3700 is the most complex article I've written to date, with multiple running themes, and a huge scale. Every piece, and every element of the article was considered, every description designed to invoke specific images. The log was crafted with careful consideration towards how best to depict two giant creatures going all out. What came out of the fire was an epic brawl, a depiction of two entities of magnificent power tearing at each other repeatedly, until they both die. 

The result? The Foundation has no idea what is coming next, and it scares the hell out of them. This piece is a very important cornerstone in my Seas of Orcadian Canon as it is the quintessential turning point where the Foundation demonstrates its vast resources and capabilities, and in spite of it all, they are still tossed about like ants in a bath tub. Its also, indirectly, implied that by doing what they are doing, the Foundation is making things //worse//. By not allowing 3700-1 to rest, they are inadvertently weakening it over time, and strengthening 3700-2. This eventually leads to the Incident log ending in a draw, where both entities die.

[[tab MTF Chi-7 "Plague Tamers"]]

**MTF Chi-7 "Plague Tamers":** Chi-7 is a specialized hybrid Mobile Task Force responsible for combating, containing, and undercover investigation of anomalies related to the fields of micro and molecular biology, and biochemistry. Due to overlaps with MTF Beta-7, Chi-7 is often deployed for small scale control of anomalous viral/bacterial/protozoan epidemics, as well as containment of large scale microscopic organisms.

Chi-7 is broken into 3 subdivisons:
* Chimera 1: Composed of five, 6 man combat teams for tactical insertion when combating hostile biological entities or known GoI's responsible for anomalous outbreaks. 
* Chimera 2: Composed of three, 8 man squads of researchers, engineers and highly trained security personnel responsible for design and deployment of containment procedures in the field.
* Chimera 3: 15 small 3 man groups deployed as undercover physicians, researchers, engineers, and occult members as needed.

+ Character Profiles
[[tabview]]
[[tab Personnel Dossier Co-Director Sherry Andrews]]

**Name:** Sherry O'Keeffe Andrews

**Age:** 25

**Height:** 175.26 cm

**Weight:** 60 kg

**Relationship Status:** Married

**Organization:** The Foundation

**Clearance Level:** 4

**Employee ID:** ██████-████

**Degree (if applicable):** Bachelors of Science, Microbiology; PhD, Immunology.

**Position(s):** Co-Director Site-234, Oversight MTF-Chi-7 ("Plague Tamers"), deputy chair Foundation Department of Medical and Biological research. 

**Appearance:** Slim but athletic build. Green almond shaped eyes, small pointed nose, thick bottom lip, prominent high set cheekbones, freckles across the face and shoulders. Hair is long, and ranges from a dark maroon to a fiery crimson in color depending on the amount of recent sunlight exposure. Is in peak mental and physical condition for her age.

Dr. Andrews prefers clothing/apparel that is both stylish and comfortable. She avoids overtly formal wear barring events that absolutely require it, and despises heels of any kind. 

Work Attire: Boots, either knee high riding boots or standard issue combat boots, flats, and occasionally athletic/tennis shoes. Wears either slacks or jeans, skirts are reserved for more formal events. Tops consist of either a blouse or button up shirt, underneath a blazer, vest, or more formal cardigan. 

Casual attire: Boots, knee high, Athletic shoes, primarily during runs or trips requiring lots of walking, and occasionally flip flops. Jeans, leggings, and sweatpants. Tops are usually less dressy blouses, T-shirts, sleeveless/strapless tops, cardigans, and occasionally just a sports bra. 

**Personality:** Sherry Andrews is an ambitious, willful woman, with a no-nonsense attitude towards her subordinates. She's efficient, ambitious, and extraordinarily intelligent, calculating every move and word. Outwardly, she can be cold, emotionless, callous, and at times, sadistic. She appears to take pleasure from others discomfort, especially in subordinates, and either antagonize or harass them if they open themselves to it. Certain parties within Site-234 refer to her as "The Crimson Witch of the Southeast" due to this behavior.

Despite the rough exterior, Sherry Andrews is inwardly an empathetic and emotional person, and often displays this with subtle, even unconscious actions, such as saving Leep, her husband, from a potentially fatal mugging before they began dating. To friends and loved ones, Sherry Andrews is known for witty, groan inducing puns, and her addiction to adrenaline, specifically rollercoasters. 

**Background:** Sherry O'Keeffe Andrews was left at an orphanage in ██████, Ohio on February 3rd 1992. No records of Dr. Andrews parents are known to exist, and Foundation genetic databases have not been able to identify any living relatives. Dr. Andrews grew up in the American Foster Care system, often bouncing between homes due to poor funding and/or abusive sponsors. During her time within the system, Dr. Andrews developed a cynical, and cold exterior to protect herself and others from the harsh realities of her day to day life. 

Despite this rough childhood, Dr. Andrews excelled in academics, skipping 3 grades and launching straight into High School at the age of 11 years old. Her prowess with mathematics, and especially biology drew the attention of some within the Foundation, especially those at the relatively young Site-234. Dr. Andrews graduated Salutatorian, later claiming that she didn't receive valedictorian due to being disinterested in the rather non-rigorous nature of her inner city high school classes, preferring to pursue personal research into the hard sciences.

Dr. Andrews was accepted into a number of schools, but decided to attend a small private university in Memphis Tenessee. She secured her Bachelors degree within two and a half years, graduating //summa cum laude//. Dr. Andrews then applied and was accepted into The University of Alabama's Immunology Doctoral program. During the duration of her Doctoral program, Sherry Andrews became enamored with another PhD candidate in the competing Virology program, Dr. Leep Andrews. Initially only having a few classes together, and having a 4 year age difference between them, their relationship remained platonic for the duration of their first year within their respective programs. 

By the second year, Sherry had begun developing serious romantic feelings for her new friend, and settled on pursuing those feelings in the most characteristic way possible: Harassing the shit out of him until he agreed to go on a date. Eventually, said actions lead to a joint PhD thesis involving the complex interaction of human immune cells in response to a variety  of retroviruses, leading to a full published transcript and receival of their Doctorates after 3 years of work. 

Following their graduation, Sherry and Leep Andrews were approached by Foundation representatives. Both parties jumped at he opportunity and soon found themselves working through the ranks, until they were named Co-directors of Site-234. 

[[/tab]]
[[tab Personnel Dossier Co-Director Leep Andrews]]

**Name:** Leep Thomas Andrews

**Age:** 28

**Height:** 176 cm

**Weight:** 65 kg

**Relationship Status:** Married

**Organization:** The Foundation

**Clearance Level:** 4

**Employee ID:** ██████-████

**Degree (if applicable):** Bachelors of Science, Microbiology; PhD, Virology.

**Position(s):** Co-Director Site-234, Anomalous Pathogens committee, Chair Foundation Department of Medical and Biological research.

**Appearance:** Thin build, round hooded eyes, small round nose, thin lips, subdued cheek bones with a strong jaw. Hair is short, with a golden color as a result of a mixture of blond and strong red tones. Is in peak mental condition for his age, and in moderate physical health. 

Leep Andrews prefers business casual attire at work, and like his wife, avoids formal wear unless absolutely necessary. 

Work Attire: Slacks/khakis, black mens shoes, and either a polo or button up shirt. 

Casual Attire: Jeans, athletic shoes and sandals, and usually T-shirts. Leep Andrews is self conscious and does not go without a top unless going swimming. 

**Personality:** Leep Andrews is an ambitious, intelligent and compassionate. He is colloquially known amongst Site-234 personnel as "The Cinnamon Roll" due to his compassionate and empathetic approach to problems and situations. Such attributes allow Dr. Andrews to achieve a different type of efficiency with his subordinates than his wife, as he is often described as warm and friendly, unafraid to show his true emotions to those around him. 

Leep is infamously loyal to his friends, willing to withstand even the harshest punishments to prevent others from being hurt. Among friends, he is known for his laugh, often resembling a hyena. Despite these traits, Dr. Leep Andrews is often reserved, cautious, and hesitant to make aggressive and immediate actions, preferring instead to evaluate every variable before acting. Like his wife, he has a love of witty and groan inducing puns, and the occasional adrenaline based thrill. 

**Background:** Dr. Leep Andrews was born on September 13th, 1988 in the suburbs of Birmingham Alabama. Dr. Andrews was an only child, and grew up in an upper middle class household. Dr. Andrews had a generally happy childhood, and excelled early in his academic career before plateauing due to high expectations and pressure from his parents. 

Despite these Issues, Dr. Andrews attracted attention from Foundation Personnel and academic research institutions when at the age of 14 he began applying and successfully gaining entrance to volunteer programs centering around Virological research, showing an aptitude for many complex techniques that even the most experienced personnel struggled with. Dr. Andrews graduated from High School within the top 20 of his class, and accepted a full scholarship to the University of Alabama at Birmingham where he secured his Bachelors of Science within 2 and a half years at the age of 20. 

Leep Andrews applied and was accepted to the Virology program at the same university, where in his first year he met Sherry Andrews. Sherry's rough and cold exterior initially put Leep at odds with her, but over the duration of the couple classes they had together in their first year he became more familiar with the real woman beneath the iron exterior. It wasn't until the beginning of his second year in the PhD program that Leep realized he'd silently fallen romantically for his classmate. Despite this realization, Leep did not pursue a romantic relationship, believing his feelings to not be reciprocated, and thus pursued a platonic relationship until Sherry made the first move. 

Following their graduation, Sherry and Leep Andrews were approached by Foundation representatives. Both parties jumped at the opportunity and soon found themselves working through the ranks, until they were named Co-directors of Site-234.
