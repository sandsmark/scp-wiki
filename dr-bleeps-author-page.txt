++ Welcome to Site 234's Internal database. Credentials recognized, Access Approved.

**Current Site Director:** Co-Directors Dr. and Dr. Andrews

**Head of Security:** Agent  ██████

**Head of Research:** Dr.  Regina ██████

**Resident MTF:** Chi-7 "Plague Tamers"

**Description** Site 234 is one of the Foundations youngest facilities, having been constructed in the fall of 1983. Site 234 serves as a center for research and containment of Micro, Molecular, and Biochemical anomalies, and was constructed with 13 separate BSL-4 and 26 BSL-3 laboratories, as well as more than 200 BSL-2 facilities. Site 234 currently houses more than 200 contained anomalies, 1000 personnel that live on site, and another 8000 that commute to site 234 from the major city of Birmingham, Alabama. 

Site 234 serves as a leading source of biomedical research for the Foundation, pioneering medicinal compounds in use by many Foundation medical personnel which have yet to be leaked to the public. Next to site 19, site 234 is one of the foundation's largest facilities, and is expected to grow larger in the near future as the number of small scale biological anomalies increases. For further information on wings, site layout, and topography please consult our secure facility dossier.

[[tab Profile Dr. and Dr. Andrews]]

**Name:** Dr. Leep and Dr. Sherry Andrews.

**Age:** 29 and 25 respectively.

**Marrital status:** Married to each other.

**Degrees:** PhD's in Virology and Immunology

**Clearance Level:** Level 4

**Description:** Dr. Leep and Dr. Sherry Andrews are the current Co-directors of Site 234 after the site founder, Dr. Reginald Star, retired from his position after serving as director for 31 years. Dr. Leep and Dr. Sherry are foremost experts in their respective fields, having both risen through the Foundations ranks by exhibiting a strong consistent work ethic, a thorough understanding of the anomalies and their respective dangers, and groundbreaking discoveries for the biomedical fields. 

Dr. Leep and Dr. Sherry currently split responsibility as deemed by the regional oversight committees, having determined that that their relative strengths and weakness offset each other in a manner that makes them an effective administrative team. Further information can be found on their respective profile pages.

[[collapsible show="Show commentary" hide="Hide Commentary"]]
Where do I even begin with 2378? The beginning I guess. So, after the success of Overly Large //E. coli// I found myself in a bit of a conundrum. How do I follow up a successful first SCP? Do I continue on the logical path with Microbiology? Do I tread outside my comfort zone? It's pretty obvious, in hindsight, that I was going to continue with the same extremely technical and detailed approach that I hit in just the right way with 2946. 

So where did the idea come from? Well, that's a little tough to say to be honest. I had kind of wanted to make a giant SCP which would become a hub for future anomalies, a sort of microbiological SCP generator if you will, but it had to be something where it's obvious the effects of the parts will be so radically different from the origin point that the reader is like "Ok, yeah that's new." So, continuing with the same avenue of thought with 2946, I went for large scale microbiology, except this time a human digestive system scaled up by 5 orders of magnitude. It took some time to nail the details down, to trim and clip extraneous information, not as much as 2946 mind you, but still. When I posted, I was quite surprised by the response, and the accumulation of votes over time. For awhile, it was my second highest scp, until 2491 came along.

[[collapsible show="Show Author Commentary" hide="Hide Author Commentary"]]
It would be a lie for me to say that 2946 was truly my first SCP idea, though it definitely wasn't my last. In reality, I had another draft, and another concept that I was looking at and working on. I ended up scraping that draft due to mixed feedback and the controversial nature of the subject on which the concept was based. Ultimately, I think abandoning the concept was a good move on my part. 

The fallback concept centered around something I hadn't noticed a lot of on the wiki. There are a great number of articles here, many of them interesting, which address things of the microscopic nature. However, the majority of them are based around anomalous infectious disease, especially highly communicable and strange diseases. This gave me a rather odd idea, what if the Foundation found a model bacterial Organism, like //Escherichia coli// that was absurdly large, to the point that it violates many of the basic principles we know about possible cell sizes. From there I utilized my in depth knowledge and experience working with //E. coli// in the lab to construct a highly detailed and technical set of containment procedures, outlining how the organism is to be contained, how it's maintained and propagated, and how the Foundation takes advantage of it's size and metabolic properties to move it's medical research forward. 

The current 2946 is about the 5th iteration of the article. The first couple were heavily drowned in biological terminology and technical terms, and ultimately I probably trimmed 3 times the articles current length out. From that point, I began attempting to weave some sort of narrative, and fell into the "Rogue researcher does something nuts category" before ultimately scrapping that narrative line. The final iteration came about when minmin suggested I go for the hyper mutation route, and with //E. coli's// properties I was able to make it sufficiently work, and now it's my second highest rated Article.

[[tab MTF Chi-7 "Plague Tamers"]]

**MTF Chi-7 "Plague Tamers":** Chi-7 is a specialized hybrid Mobile Task Force responsible for combating, containing, and undercover investigation of anomalies related to the fields of micro and molecular biology, and biochemistry. Due to overlaps with MTF Beta-7, Chi-7 is often deployed for small scale control of anomalous viral/bacterial/protozoan epidemics, as well as containment of large scale microscopic organisms.

Chi-7 is broken into 3 subdivisons:
* Chimera 1: Composed of five, 6 man combat teams for tactical insertion when combating hostile biological entities or known GoI's responsible for anomalous outbreaks. 
* Chimera 2: Composed of three, 8 man squads of researchers, engineers and highly trained security personnel responsible for design and deployment of containment procedures in the field.
* Chimera 3: 15 small 3 man groups deployed as undercover physicians, researchers, engineers, and occult members as needed.
