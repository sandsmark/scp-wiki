**Head of Research:** Dr.  Regina ██████

**Resident MTF:** Chi-7 "Plague Tamers"

**Description** Site 234 is one of the Foundations youngest facilities, having been constructed in the fall of 1983. Site 234 serves as a center for research and containment of Micro, Molecular, and Biochemical anomalies, and was constructed with 13 separate BSL-4 and 26 BSL-3 laboratories, as well as more than 200 BSL-2 facilities. Site 234 currently houses more than 200 contained anomalies, 1000 personnel that live on site, and another 8000 that commute to site 234 from the major city of Birmingham, Alabama. 

Site 234 serves as a leading source of biomedical research for the Foundation, pioneering medicinal compounds in use by many Foundation medical personnel which have yet to be leaked to the public. Next to site 19, site 234 is one of the foundation's largest facilities, and is expected to grow larger in the near future as the number of small scale biological anomalies increases. For further information on wings, site layout, and topography please consult our secure facility dossier.

[[collapsible show="Show commentary" hide="Hide Commentary"]]
Where do I even begin with 2378? The beginning I guess. So, after the success of Overly Large //E. coli// I found myself in a bit of a conundrum. How do I follow up a successful first SCP? Do I continue on the logical path with Microbiology? Do I tread outside my comfort zone? It's pretty obvious, in hindsight, that I was going to continue with the same extremely technical and detailed approach that I hit in just the right way with 2946. 

So where did the idea come from? Well, that's a little tough to say to be honest. I had kind of wanted to make a giant SCP which would become a hub for future anomalies, a sort of microbiological SCP generator if you will, but it had to be something where it's obvious the effects of the parts will be so radically different from the origin point that the reader is like "Ok, yeah that's new." So, continuing with the same avenue of thought with 2946, I went for large scale microbiology, except this time a human digestive system scaled up by 5 orders of magnitude. It took some time to nail the details down, to trim and clip extraneous information, not as much as 2946 mind you, but still. When I posted, I was quite surprised by the response, and the accumulation of votes over time. For awhile, it was my second highest scp, until 2491 came along.

[[collapsible show="Show Author Commentary" hide="Hide Author Commentary"]]
It would be a lie for me to say that 2946 was truly my first SCP idea, though it definitely wasn't my last. In reality, I had another draft, and another concept that I was looking at and working on. I ended up scraping that draft due to mixed feedback and the controversial nature of the subject on which the concept was based. Ultimately, I think abandoning the concept was a good move on my part. 

The fallback concept centered around something I hadn't noticed a lot of on the wiki. There are a great number of articles here, many of them interesting, which address things of the microscopic nature. However, the majority of them are based around anomalous infectious disease, especially highly communicable and strange diseases. This gave me a rather odd idea, what if the Foundation found a model bacterial Organism, like //Escherichia coli// that was absurdly large, to the point that it violates many of the basic principles we know about possible cell sizes. From there I utilized my in depth knowledge and experience working with //E. coli// in the lab to construct a highly detailed and technical set of containment procedures, outlining how the organism is to be contained, how it's maintained and propagated, and how the Foundation takes advantage of it's size and metabolic properties to move it's medical research forward. 

The current 2946 is about the 5th iteration of the article. The first couple were heavily drowned in biological terminology and technical terms, and ultimately I probably trimmed 3 times the articles current length out. From that point, I began attempting to weave some sort of narrative, and fell into the "Rogue researcher does something nuts category" before ultimately scrapping that narrative line. The final iteration came about when minmin suggested I go for the hyper mutation route, and with //E. coli's// properties I was able to make it sufficiently work, and now it's my second highest rated Article.

[[tab MTF Chi-7 "Plague Tamers"]]

**MTF Chi-7 "Plague Tamers":** Chi-7 is a specialized hybrid Mobile Task Force responsible for combating, containing, and undercover investigation of anomalies related to the fields of micro and molecular biology, and biochemistry. Due to overlaps with MTF Beta-7, Chi-7 is often deployed for small scale control of anomalous viral/bacterial/protozoan epidemics, as well as containment of large scale microscopic organisms.

Chi-7 is broken into 3 subdivisons:
* Chimera 1: Composed of five, 6 man combat teams for tactical insertion when combating hostile biological entities or known GoI's responsible for anomalous outbreaks. 
* Chimera 2: Composed of three, 8 man squads of researchers, engineers and highly trained security personnel responsible for design and deployment of containment procedures in the field.
* Chimera 3: 15 small 3 man groups deployed as undercover physicians, researchers, engineers, and occult members as needed.

[[tab Personnel Dossier Co-Director Sherry Andrews]]

**Name:** Sherry O'Keeffe Andrews

**Age:** 25

**Height:** 175.26 cm

**Weight:** 60 kg

**Relationship Status:** Married

**Organization:** The Foundation

**Clearance level:** 4

**Employee ID:** ██████-████

**Degree (if applicable):** Bachelors of Science, Microbiology; PhD, Immunology.

**Position(s):** Co-Director Site-234, Oversight MTF-Chi-7 ("Plague Tamers"), deputy chair Foundation Department of Medical and Biological research. 

**Appearance:** Slim but athletic build. Green almond shaped eyes, small pointed nose, thick bottom lip, prominent high set cheekbones, freckles across the face and shoulders. Hair is long, and ranges from a dark maroon to a fiery crimson in color depending on the amount of recent sunlight exposure. Is in peak mental and physical condition for her age.

Dr. Andrews prefers clothing/apparel that is both stylish and comfortable. She avoids overtly formal wear barring events that absolutely require it, and despises heels of any kind. 

Work Attire: Boots, either knee high riding boots or standard issue combat boots, flats, and occasionally athletic/tennis shoes. Wears either slacks or jeans, skirts are reserved for more formal events. Tops consist of either a blouse or button up shirt, underneath a blazer, vest, or more formal cardigan. 

Casual attire: Boots, knee high, Athletic shoes, primarily during runs or trips requiring lots of walking, and occasionally flip flops. Jeans, leggings, and sweatpants. Tops are usually less dressy blouses, T-shirts, sleeveless/strapless tops, cardigans, and occasionally just a sports bra. 

**Personality:** Sherry Andrews is an ambitious, willful woman, with a no-nonsense attitude towards her subordinates. She's efficient, ambitious, and extraordinarily intelligent, calculating every move and word. Outwardly, she can be cold, emotionless, callous, and at times, sadistic. She appears to take pleasure from others discomfort, especially in subordinates, and either antagonize or harass them if they open themselves to it. Certain parties within Site-234 refer to her as "The Crimson Witch of the Southeast" due to this behavior.

Despite the rough exterior, Sherry Andrews is inwardly an empathetic and emotional person, and often displays this with subtle, even unconscious actions, such as saving Leep, her husband, from a potentially fatal mugging before they began dating. To friends and loved ones, Sherry Andrews is known for witty, groan inducing puns, and her addiction to adrenaline, specifically rollercoasters. 

**Background:** Sherry O'Keeffe Andrews was left at an orphanage in ██████, Ohio on February 3rd 1992. No records of Dr. Andrews parents are known to exist, and Foundation genetic databases have not been able to identify any living relatives. Dr. Andrews grew up in the American Foster Care system, often bouncing between homes due to poor funding and/or abusive sponsors. During her time within the system, Dr. Andrews developed a cynical, and cold exterior to protect herself and others from the harsh realities of her day to day life. 

Despite this rough childhood, Dr. Andrews excelled in academics, skipping 3 grades and launching straight into High School at the age of 11 years old. Her prowess with mathematics, and especially biology drew the attention of some within the Foundation, especially those at the relatively young Site-234. Dr. Andrews graduated Salutatorian, later claiming that she didn't receive valedictorian due to being disinterested in the rather non-rigorous nature of her inner city high school classes, preferring to pursue personal research into the hard sciences.

Dr. Andrews was accepted into a number of schools, but decided to attend a small private university in Memphis Tenessee. She secured her Bachelors degree within two and a half years, graduating //summa cum laude//. Dr. Andrews then applied and was accepted into The University of Alabama's Immunology Doctoral program. During the duration of her Doctoral program, Sherry Andrews became enamored with another PhD candidate in the competing Virology program, Dr. Leep Andrews. Initially only having a few classes together, and having a 4 year age difference between them, their relationship remained platonic for the duration of their first year within their respective programs. 

By the second year, Sherry had begun developing serious romantic feelings for her new friend, and settled on pursuing those feelings in the most characteristic way possible: Harassing the shit out of him until he agreed to go on a date. Eventually, said actions lead to a joint PhD thesis involving the complex interaction of human immune cells in response to a variety  of retroviruses, leading to a full published transcript and receival of their Doctorates after 3 years of work. 

Following their graduation, Sherry and Leep Andrews were approached by Foundation representatives. Both parties jumped at he opportunity and soon found themselves working through the ranks, until they were named Co-directors of Site-234.

[[tab Personnel Dossier Co-Director Leep Andrews]]

**Name:** Leep Thomas Andrews

**Age:** 28

**Height:** 176 cm

**Weight:** 65 kg

**Relationship Status:** Married

**Organization:** The Foundation

**Clearance Level:** 4

**Employee ID:** ██████-████

**Degree (if applicable):** Bachelors of Science, Microbiology; PhD, Virology.

**Position(s):** Co-Director Site-234, Anomalous Pathogens committee, Chair Foundation Department of Medical and Biological research.

**Appearance:** Thin build, round hooded eyes, small round nose, thin lips, subdued cheek bones with a strong jaw. Hair is short, with a golden color as a result of a mixture of blond and strong red tones. Is in peak mental condition for his age, and in moderate physical health. 

Leep Andrews prefers business casual attire at work, and like his wife, avoids formal wear unless absolutely necessary. 

Work Attire: Slacks/khakis, black mens shoes, and either a polo or button up shirt. 

Casual Attire: Jeans, athletic shoes and sandals, and usually T-shirts. Leep Andrews is self conscious and does not go without a top unless going swimming. 

**Personality:** Leep Andrews is an ambitious, intelligent and compassionate. He is colloquially known amongst Site-234 personnel as "The Cinnamon Roll" due to his compassionate and empathetic approach to problems and situations. Such attributes allow Dr. Andrews to achieve a different type of efficiency with his subordinates than his wife, as he is often described as warm and friendly, unafraid to show his true emotions to those around him. 

Leep is infamously loyal to his friends, willing to withstand even the harshest punishments to prevent others from being hurt. Among friends, he is known for his laugh, often resembling a hyena. Despite these traits, Dr. Leep Andrews is often reserved, cautious, and hesitant to make aggressive and immediate actions, preferring instead to evaluate every variable before acting. Like his wife, he has a love of witty and groan inducing puns, and the occasional adrenaline based thrill. 

**Background:** Dr. Leep Andrews was born on September 13th, 1988 in the suburbs of Birmingham Alabama. Dr. Andrews was an only child, and grew up in an upper middle class household. Dr. Andrews had a generally happy childhood, and excelled early in his academic career before plateauing due to high expectations and pressure from his parents. 

Despite these Issues, Dr. Andrews attracted attention from Foundation Personnel and academic research institutions when at the age of 14 he began applying and successfully gaining entrance to volunteer programs centering around Virological research, showing an aptitude for many complex techniques that even the most experienced personnel struggled with. Dr. Andrews graduated from High School within the top 20 of his class, and accepted a full scholarship to the University of Alabama at Birmingham where he secured his Bachelors of Science within 2 and a half years at the age of 20. 

Leep Andrews applied and was accepted to the Virology program at the same university, where in his first year he met Sherry Andrews. Sherry's rough and cold exterior initially put Leep at odds with her, but over the duration of the couple classes they had together in their first year he became more familiar with the real woman beneath the iron exterior. It wasn't until the beginning of his second year in the PhD program that Leep realized he'd silently fallen romantically for his classmate. Despite this realization, Leep did not pursue a romantic relationship, believing his feelings to not be reciprocated, and thus pursued a platonic relationship until Sherry made the first move. 

Following their graduation, Sherry and Leep Andrews were approached by Foundation representatives. Both parties jumped at the opportunity and soon found themselves working through the ranks, until they were named Co-directors of Site-234.
