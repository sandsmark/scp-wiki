**Item #:** SCP-2646

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Instances of SCP-2646 are to be contained at their original locations as novelty devices and the slots for accepting currency locked off. MTF Nu-5 ("Nu Edition") is responsible for locating and alerting Foundation authorities to new instances of SCP-2646.

Due to Site-43's location and the number of corpses processed at the Subject Interrment Facility, SCP-2646 instances have begun appearing at a significantly higher rate. As such, corpses should be incinerated in order to prevent further SCP-2646 manifestation.

Should SCP-2646-B instances attempt to communicate with Foundation personnel, the conversation is to be transcribed and recorded on **Supplementary Document SCP-2646-1**.

**Description:** SCP-2646 is the collective designation for --17-- --19-- 23 different Telstra-branded payphones located at various locations across the countryside of New South Wales, designated SCP-2646-1 to 17. SCP-2646 instances are believed to spontaneously appear, as no external force has ever been observed actually installing them.

An SCP-2646 instance may manifest near any human corpse which has been left intact (i.e. not damaged significantly following death) and unobserved for more than 26 hours. Such corpses are designated SCP-2646-A. If said corpse is above ground at the time of manifestation, the corpse will promptly disappear and reappear approximately 4 meters below ground.

Examination of the telephone line used to connect an SCP-2646 instance shows that the line extends towards SCP-2646-A and terminates at an unidentified point within the body itself. Disturbing SCP-2646-A appears to neutralise the anomalous properties of the corresponding SCP-2646 instance.

Inserting a valid Australian coin into the appropriate slot on an SCP-2646 instance will allow the user to hear audio, apparently from an unknown location (designated SCP-2646-X', where X is the designation of the corresponding SCP-2646 instance). The location of these listening stations appears to vary with each SCP-2646 instance, although multiple calls made from a single SCP-2646 instance results in audio from the same location.

SCP-2646-B is the collective designation for presumably human entities who occasionally communicate through SCP-2646. Interviews conducted via SCP-2646 instances have established that the SCP-2646-B population is most likely to be composed of SCP-2646-A instances.

||~ Typical Audio Heard || SCP-2646'-13 is believed to be located in an urban area, as evidenced by the sound of footsteps and cars picked up by the receiver. Soft rain is typically heard in the background. The sound of human voices is occasionally heard, although the quality of the audio is too poor to accurately identify the majority of these voices. ||
