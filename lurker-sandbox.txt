**Dr. Lurker** 
------

**Researcher**

**Security Class:** █

**Current Status:** ACTIVE

**Current Location:** Site ██

**Previous Involvements:** [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Current Assignment:** //Classified - Level 4 Security Clearance or higher only.//

------

**History:** Dr. Lurker is one of the few SCPs we permit to carry the same title and clearance as a researcher after careful consideration and recommendations from Dr. █████████ and Dr. ████████. Dr. Lurker came to the Foundation seeking sanctuary after an incident with Foundation staff in ████████, Alberta. It has expressed interest in assisting the Foundation with whatever means to protect the human species from harm, and has a particular interest in physics. 

Since arrival at the Foundation, Dr. Lurker has assisted in numerous retrievals, as well as documenting and experimenting on several SCPs. Dr. Lurker’s request of being able to go and actively track SCPs has been denied due to the nature of its appearance, and the fact that a public appearance could result in unfavourable scenarios. It is currently located in Site ██ and has taken to being an assistant for Dr. ████████, Dr. ███████, and Dr. ████████. It has been provided with its own office, which has been filled with numerous textbooks and log files, as well as a unique lighting system that allows it to [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Notes:**
 //I don’t see why you’re letting this freak walk around like it’s human, what if it decides it’s going to eat us one day? Then what? I vote we decom it as soon as possible, or at least stick it somewhere where it can’t hurt us.// -Dr. █████
//I sincerely hope you’re aware that I have a laptop in my office, Doctor. Rest assured if I wanted to eat you, I’d have a very difficult time doing so. Besides, what would I do without the protection that the Foundation kindly offers me? Please rethink your opinion of me.// -Dr. Lurker
// I think this is a fascinating opportunity for us to learn about another species without immediately jumping to our normal conclusion of examine, slice, and dice. Plus, he's a nice guy. Less likely to hurt anybody than most of the human staff around here.// -Dr. Rights

**Dr. Simon A. Reia** 
------

**Researcher and Object Recovery Agent**

**Security Class:** █

**Current Status:** ACTIVE

**Current Location:** ████████, ███████

**Previous Involvements:** ████████████ Research Facility (██████, NM, USA),  Silver Castle Research Center (██████, IN, USA), ██████████ Center for the ███████ (██████, NB, Canada)

**Current Assignment:** [[DATA EXPUNGED]]

------

**History:** Dr. Reia grew up in a small city south of ██████, Oregon. At the age of 14 he had his first contact with a non-terrestrial life form; it is at this point we believe that he developed his ██████████, as well as his increased luck. Reia graduated from M.I.T. in 19██ and promptly got accepted at █████████ Research Facility in New Mexico. Following an accident that caused the facility to shut down, Reia was then approached by the ██████████ Corporation in 20██, offering him a job as a Chief of █████████. He was relocated once before a second accident caused his program to be shut down. It is at this point that he was approached by the Foundation, as his involvement with non-terrestrials made him a useful asset and he has assisted in the retrieval and discovery of several SCPs in his short time with the Foundation.
