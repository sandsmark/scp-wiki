**Item #:** SCP-584

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Specimen is currently contained in a 50cm x 50cm terrarium treated for cold. When handling, wear temperature insulated gloves. Currently being fed Anoles every other day.

Subject's bite injects an endothermic venom, if bitten seek medical assistance immediately, while non-lethal to humans, it can still result in minor to severe frostbite if left untreated.

**Description:** Subject is an Arachnid, resembling a cobalt tarantula, its body is about 7cm in length, its legs are about 11cm. It possesses a venom with endothermic properties, upon being bitten the area starts to cool rapidly and if a major blood vessel is hit, it can freeze parts of the circulatory system. Against victims smaller than itself, this is usually lethal.

It normally feeds by biting its prey, then while the victim cools, it drags it to a safe place. When it reaches such an area, it proceeds to eat its frozen victim.

**Addendum:** Subject normally avoids contact, but if cornered it quickly turns aggressive, attempting to bite its perceived attacker before fleeing.
