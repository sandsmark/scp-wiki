**Item #:** SCP-548

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Specimen is to be kept at 24 degrees Celsius  in a 50cm x 50cm terrarium that must be able to resist breaking at sudden temperature drops of about -50 degrees Celsius. When handling, wear heavy insulated gloves. Currently being fed Anoles every other day.

Subject's bite injects an endothermic venom, if bitten seek medical assistance immediately, it can potentially kill a human if the bite reaches a major artery, even if it is not in a major area, it can still result in minor to severe frostbite if left untreated. If subject starts displaying aggressive behavior, cease handling immediately.

**Description:** Subject is an Arachnid, resembling a cobalt tarantula, its body is about 7cm in length, its legs are about 11cm. It possesses a venom with highly endothermic properties, causing an average temperature drop of about -38 Celsius. This is enough to cause frostbite, and if a blood vessel is affected, it can freeze parts of the circulatory system stopping blood flow through that area. If the bite reaches a major vein, it can potentially freeze the heart, with lethal results. Victims smaller than itself can be easily frozen solid.

It normally feeds by biting its prey, then while the victim cools, it drags it to a safe place. When it reaches such an area, it proceeds to eat its frozen victim, by grinding it with its mandibles.

**Addendum:** Subject normally avoids contact, but if cornered it quickly turns aggressive, attempting to bite its perceived attacker before fleeing.

Subject has shown to be capable of surviving being frozen, entering a state resembling hibernation at such an event. This could be exploited for storage purposes, further research is required.
