**Item #:** SCP-548

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-548 is to be kept at 24° Celsius  in a 50cm x 50cm terrarium that must be able to resist breaking at sudden temperature changes of about 50° Celsius. When handling, wear heavy insulated gloves. Currently being fed Anoles every other day.

Subject's bite injects an endothermic venom. If bitten, seek medical assistance immediately. SCP-548's bite can potentially kill a human if the venom reaches a major blood vessel. Bites in areas with lower blood flow can still result in severe frostbite if left untreated. If SCP-548 starts displaying aggressive behavior, cease handling immediately.

**Description:** Subject is an Arachnid, resembling a cobalt tarantula. Its body is about 7cm in length, with legs at roughly 11cm. It possesses a venom with highly endothermic properties, causing an average temperature drop of about 38° Celsius over a matter of seconds with only one injection. This is enough to cause frostbite, and if a blood vessel is affected, it can freeze parts of the circulatory system, effectively stopping blood flow through that area. Should a bite reach a major vein, it can potentially freeze the heart with lethal results. Victims smaller than SCP-548 can easily be frozen solid.

Subject normally feeds by biting its prey, then while the victim cools, dragging it to a safe place. When it reaches such an area, it proceeds to eat the frozen victim by grinding it with its mandibles.

**Addendum:** Subject normally avoids contact. If cornered, it quickly turns aggressive, attempting to bite its perceived attacker before fleeing.

SCP-548 has shown to be capable of surviving being frozen, entering a state resembling hibernation in such an event. This could be exploited for storage purposes, further research is required.
