**Item #:** SCP-446

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-446 is to be kept locked in its case and only removed for testing. SCP-446 will no longer be put on display in the facility lobby due to complaints of uneasiness and paranoia from personnel. Any clothing and accessories must be removed from SCP-446 when not in use (see Incident 446-A).

**Description:** SCP-446 in its normal state appears to be a Caucasian female, early twenties, brown hair 17.78cm at its longest point, unusually bright blue eyes, light skin, 1.75m tall and weighing 52.16kg. SCP-446 is anatomically correct, at least on the outside. All physical characteristics are consistent with a living human, including skin tone and texture, eye color and clarity of the sclera, even body heat. SCP-446 does not respond to any communication however, and also does not breathe or exhibit a pulse.

SCP-446 is normally stored lying on its back inside a long aluminum box with a hinged lid. SCP-446 and its storage box were discovered in [REDACTED] by agents ███████ and █████. The storage box itself is unremarkable, aside from a plain white label listing SCP-446's clothing sizes. When they attempted to lift SCP-446 by the shoulders into a sitting position, SCP-446 responded to their touch by sitting upright on its own. A gentle push on the its shoulders from the front encouraged it to lie back down. Further coaxing can compel SCP-446 to stand up on its own, and it will remain standing until downward pressure is applied to the top of its head, encouraging SCP-446 to sit again. SCP-446 generally does not move without prompting of some kind, although its eyes will follow the nearest person and it will make eye contact if possible.

Moving and posing of SCP-446's limbs is also possible; once moved into position they will hold the established pose indefinitely. This works even in cases where delicate balancing would be required for a person, such as standing on one foot or even one hand. Attempts to push SCP-446 over have exactly the expected effect; it makes no attempt to preserve its balance and simply falls over.

Initial testing and a medical examination of SCP-446 revealed additional information. See the documentation below for details.

**Incident 446-1**

**SCP involved:** SCP-446

**Personnel involved:** Guard ██████, Dr. Sunderland

**Date:** 9/2/2010

**Location:** Storage Room 6, Site ██

**Description:** In the spirit of modesty, SCP-446 was initially stored clothed in a standard Class D personnel uniform. A guard later investigated reports of a "thumping noise" in Storage Room 6 where SCP-446 is kept. SCP-446's case was found to have moved several inches from its normal resting place as the result of rhythmic blows to the lid from the inside. Dr. Sunderland was called in, and upon opening the case, found that SCP-446 was attempting to rise to a sitting pose. It would bang its head against the lid, lie back down, and attempt to sit up again.

Once the lid was opened, SCP-446 stood on its own without coaxing. SCP-446 then put its hands together at the wrists, lowered its head, and hunched its shoulders.  SCP-446 also changed its expression for the first time since entering Foundation control; its face took on a subtle mixture of sadness and fear. It held this pose until Dr. Sunderland touched its shoulder, which prompted SCP-446 to return to a normal standing position, expressionless. SCP-446 could not be encouraged to lie down however until the Class D uniform was removed.

**Document 446-2-A**

**Results of Initial Experimentation**

**Test series conducted by:** Dr. Sunderland
**Date:** 9/3/2010

**Test 1:**
**Materials used:** 1 pair of women's jeans, 1 white t-shirt
**Test and results:** SCP-446 was dressed in a pair of jeans and a t-shirt in order to establish a testing baseline, as this is a rather standard outfit with no particular associations. Subject assumed a casual stance, head tilted slightly to the side and left hand propped on its left hip. The pose is suggestive of a clothing display mannequin.

**Test 2:**
**Materials used:** 1 white skirt, 1 white blouse, 1 tennis racket
**Test and results:** SCP-446 was dressed in the listed clothing and assumed a similar post as described in Test 1. Once the tennis racket was placed in its hand, however, the subject took hold of it and changed poses. The subject leaned forward slightly at the waist, head up, racket held ready in the right hand and the left hand out for balance. The subject's expression suggested focus and concentration.

**Test 3:**
**Materials used:** 1 Site ██ guard uniform, 1 standard issue semi-automatic pistol
**Test and results:** SCP-446 was dressed in the guard uniform. The subject assumed an alert pose, feet together and back straight, with its chin held high. Once the gun was placed in the holster, the subject [REDACTED].

//Note from Dr. Sunderland:// Testing involving SCP-446 and dangerous weapons is now strictly forbidden. Personnel can be replaced, but having the O5s shut down open testing of SCP-446 because some fool gave it a loaded gun would be a //real// tragedy. Use common sense, people!

**Test 4:**
**Materials used:** 1 red silk cocktail dress
**Test and results:** After the dress was placed on SCP-446, it posed with its arms up, hands behind its head, and its head resting lightly in the crook of the right arm. The stance is suggestive of a model posing for a photo. Rather than "deactivating" the pose by touching its shoulder, the subject was re-posed by moving its arm manually. The limb responded readily and did not resist. The subject's right arm was folded across its chest below the breasts. At this time the left arm moved of its own accord and crossed the right arm against the chest. The subject's legs shifted slightly, assuming a haughty pose with its right foot moved forward and upper body leaned back slightly.

//Note from Dr. Sunderland:// Interesting. SCP-446 can be partially reposed and will automatically adjust the rest of its body to conform to the suggested pose. Does it somehow "know" a catalog of poses to assume? Testing with unusual combinations of props, clothing, and poses could be used explore the limits of this behavior.

**Log 446-1-A**

**Personal Log of:** Dr. Sunderland

**Date:** 9-18-2010

SCP-446's behavior reminded me of something, but for weeks I couldn't figure out what it was. It finally came to me just a few minutes ago while I was reviewing the documentation again. SCP-446 is very much like a Japanese Karakuri ningyō. These were clockwork figures, basically simple robots constructed of gears, levers, and springs, made to look like dolls in traditional Japanese dress. The most common example is a zashiki karakuri tea-server. When a cup of tea is placed in its hands, it moves forward and bows to offer the tea. When the cup is returned to its hands it returns to its starting position. I saw some on display in Tokyo during [REDACTED], but it certainly wasn't a good time for shopping, so I didn't get a chance to pick one up.

The similarities to SCP-446 are obvious, excepting the fact that, according to Dr. ███████'s medical examination, SCP-446 was once human. Is The Factory actually converting humans into semi-living Karakuri ningyō? Its reaction to different types of clothing suggest that it is more complex than that; perhaps it is intended to be a hyper-realistic mannequin? This is certainly an intruiging specimen, and the Factory stamp suggests that there might be more of them. If we had another specimen maybe I could persuade management to let Dr. ███████ dismantle one of them completely to see what we might learn from its inner workings. In the mean time, we will continue experimenting with props and clothing to explore the limits of SCP-446's functions.
