**Item #:** SCP-481

**Object Class:** Safe/Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-481 is currently contained in Sector-25, in a specially designed dormitory for the affected D-Class subjects. Two D-Class are to be assigned to carry the SCP, with a third on stand-by for replacement. The dormitory is built to modified D-class specifications, with space for two occupants. Besides the standard sleeping quarters, there is a living space for each dormitory and an adjacent room fitted with full body restraints, accessible through an outer isolation room, and attached to the individual living spaces through locked and reinforced hallways. Mounted cameras and speakers are used to monitor and communicate with the D-Class. They are to be told they are taking part in an isolation experiment.

Subjects are allowed to live in the dormitories until the progression of SCP-481 reaches its Critical point, and allowed written and recorded entertainment that are available from local sources and do not violate containment procedures. No excessive funds are to be spent on this. Subjects must not be allowed to self-terminate, and all measures are acceptable to prevent this event. The Critical subject must be moved to the restraint room by Level 3 Security personnel in full NBC gear. Security personnel must be examined in the outer isolation room after the restraint event for breaches and infection. Once the Critical subject expires, the body is to be immediately incinerated. 

A new D-Class should then be introduced to the dormitory of the surviving subject, and moved to the now empty dormitory once physical contact has been made.

**Description:**SCP-481 is a clustered pattern of scars, roughly corresponding to a variably partial map of ████████, India. When SCP-481 first manifests on a victim, it appears as a small series of criss-crossing scars that has been found to correspond to the neighborhood of ██████████████ in ████████. After intensive investigation, it is still not readily apparent what relationship SCP-481 has to the city it appears to be mapping. The scars are always described as “itchy” during the first weeks of infection. At a time ranging from 10 to 12 weeks after initial infection, the scars will begin to spread and seem to double every 2 days. This is referred to as the Critical stage. 

The growth of new scars is described by infected personnel as very painful, similar to being cut by a dull blade according to infected D-Class. The SCP will continue until it covers 100% of the skin, including the scalp. At this point, the infected subject will begin to have difficulty breathing in conjunction with hallucinations of vaguely [DATA EXPUNGED] of approximate human size watching and studying them. Death will follow shortly from spontaneous exsanguination through the scar tissue. Most subjects will self-terminate before SCP-481 reaches 100% coverage and information regarding this stage was gathered from restrained subjects. Should an infected subject self-terminate, a Critical event occurs.

Critical events consist of a loud sound, similar to a sonic boom, that can be heard in roughly a 2 km radius of the corpse. All humans within range of this sound will develop the initial scar pattern within 12 hours, and become carriers.

SCP-481 cannot be contained by death caused by a second party, as this causes the same Critical event. Should SCP-481 be isolated to one victim and that victim allowed to die of exsanguination, SCP-481 will manifest in the closest blood relation to the victim. Should no one be in range of the victim during a Critical event, the same transference occurs.

**Addendum: 481-01:** The SCP was discovered on 01/01020██ in ██████, Montana after a Critical event traced to the home of a Dr. E████ M██████. Dr. M██████ had apparently been recently home-ridden by an accident, and had not spread the infection until self-termination. When she did self-terminate via shotgun, the resulting infection was brought to the Foundation’s attention and contained. Fortunately, due to the sparse population, the infection was not wide-spread. Infected subjects were placed in full-body restraints after a self-termination infected ██ Foundation personnel.

**Addendum: 481-02:** At Dr. █████’s suggestion, the current containment procedures were adopted on 03/11/20██.
