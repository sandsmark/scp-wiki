**Item #:** SCP-2545

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-2545 is to be emptied and stored in the low value item storage facility at Site-███.-- SCP-2545 is to be stored in a low-priority Safe-class containment cell at Site-███. Upkeep is to be assigned to a Level 2 researcher. 500 grams of food are to be inserted into SCP-2545 three times per day. Once per week, SCP-2545 is to be emptied until it is 10% full, and the extraneous material delivered to the on-site cafeteria for consumption by staff. The cafeteria staff are to incinerate any leftovers after a period of one week. Under no circumstances should SCP-2545 be kept empty for more than 24 hours.

**Description:** SCP-2545 is a plastic and wooden barrel that stands 120 cm tall with a diameter of 40 cm. It is sealed with a hinged plastic lid. The inside of the barrel has 9 black rings spaced equally along it that indicate 10% increments of the barrel's volume. Prior to recovery, it also possessed a metal scoop attachment on one side, which has since been removed. 

The only contents that have thus far been able to demonstrate anomalous qualities when placed within SCP-2545 are gummy bears. When the barrel is roughly 10% full of gummy bears, some of them will begin to animate and attempt to exit the barrel. These animate gummy bears are classified as SCP-2545-1. Animation occurs at random, although typically only a few dozen are active at any given time. 

Upon animating, instances of SCP-2545-1 gain the ability to manipulate the adhesive properties of their body, which they manipulate to scale the interior of their chamber and attempt to exit. Units of SCP-2545-1 move at an average rate of 1 meter every 90 seconds. While their strength is far from threatening, they are at least capable of opening the lid of SCP-2545 if they possess the strength of numbers. 

After exiting SCP-2545, all instances of SCP-2545-1 will attempt to locate nearby foodstuffs and return them to SCP-2545. Instances of SCP-2545-1 act in a fashion indicative of a primitive hive-mind, and will cooperate to carry larger foodstuffs back to SCP-2545. Once a foodstuff has been placed inside SCP-2545, all instances of SCP-2545-1 present in the barrel will submerge it below the layer of gummy bears. Once the foodstuff is completely submerged, it will be converted into an equivalent mass of gummy bears which retain the original coloration and flavor of the food. This foraging behavior will temporarily cease once SCP-2545 is 90% full. However, if SCP-2545 remains 90% full for a period of 24 hours, it will resume producing SCP-2545-1 to continue foraging, to the point that it will overflow.

**Test Log:**██/██/20██ Testing performed by Junior Assistant Researcher ██████████, under supervision of Researcher █████████. One D-Class will be present for testing as well. SCP-2545 will be kept at 50% capacity for the duration of testing.

**Test #1:** Apple placed inside SCP-2545. Apple proceeds to sink below layer of gummies, and is then rapidly replaced with multiple red and white gummy bears of identical mass. White gummy bears confirmed to taste like apple, while red ones confirmed to taste like apple skin.

**Test #2:** Wax apple placed inside SCP-2545. Apple submerges, then rapidly reemerges and is ejected from the barrel at a velocity barely high enough to clear the edge of the barrel.

**Test #3:** Live mouse placed inside SCP-2545. Mouse submerges, then is ejected at a low velocity, as with Test #2.

**Test #4:** Dead mouse placed inside SCP-2545. Mouse submerges, then is replaced by mass of red gummy bears with lower mass than the mouse. This was shortly followed by the ejection of a mouse skeleton and clump of fur. Red gummy bears disposed of without taste-testing.

**Test #5:** Cucumber submerged halfway under the layer of gummy bears with the non-submerged portion being held onto by D-67583. Instances of SCP-2545-1 begin scaling cucumber and attempt to wrench it from D-67583’s grip. They are unsuccessful. After roughly 2 minutes, the submerged portion of the cucumber snaps off and is converted into an equivalent mass of cucumber-flavored gummy bears.

**Test #6:** D-67583 ordered to submerge arm, up to the elbow, in SCP-2545. D-67583 is hesitant, but concedes after several minutes of convincing. D-67583 submerges his arm up to the elbow. He is allowed to pull it out after 5 minutes with no noticeable changes occurring.

**Test #7:** 150 grams of gummy worms placed inside SCP-2545. [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Test #8:** D-67583 applies knife to external surface of SCP-2545, slightly damaging the wood. No response.

**Test #9:** D-67583 points Beretta 9mm at SCP-2545. A tendril of gummy bears coalesces and deposits a large clump of SCP-2545-1 at the point D-67583 is aiming at. The clump rapidly contracts from a diameter of 50 cm to a diameter of 10 cm. This process takes less than 2 seconds, far faster than any instances of SCP-2545-1 have been recorded moving up until this point. D-67583 is ordered to aim at a different portion of SCP-2545. As he shifts his aim, the sphere rolls along the surface in  time with him, blocking his shot. D-67583 ordered to fire. Bullet lodges in sphere of gummy bears and is ejected back at D-67583 at a high velocity. D-67583 sustains severe bruising and a cracked rib. Testing halted for the day.

**Addendum #1:** ██/██/20██ Item first came to Foundation’s attention on██/██/20██ after Junior Assistant Researcher ██████████ noticed it while grocery shopping at a ██████ ████ in ███████. Though the lid was closed upon discovery, several instances of SCP-2545-1 had breached the confines of SCP-2545 and were searching for foodstuffs to convert. The artifact was recovered and Class-A amnestics administered to any witnesses.

**Addendum #2:** ██/██/20██ Containment breached in low value item storage at Site-███. Shortly following the breach, several thousand instances of SCP-2545-1 were seen rolling SCP-2545 down the hallway away from storage. They were halted and re-contained just before entering the cafeteria. Investigation of the storage room revealed both the container door and the storage door to have been forced open from the inside, with approximately 600 kg of gummy bears in various states of animation trailing between the two points. Extraneous bears were incinerated and containment procedures were revised.

**Addendum #3:** What follows is a transcript of the security footage recovered from the containment breach on ██/██/20██:

> 0125-0133 hours, Site-███, low value item storage
> 
> 0125: Recording starts.
> 
> 0126: The locker containing SCP-2545 groans. The door begins to bulge, then is blown off its hinges by the internal pressure. A torrent of SCP-2545-1 pours forth and slowly moves towards the exit while a secondary group rolls SCP-2545 behind them. 
> 
> 0127: The primary group reaches the exit and begins forming an amorphous mass which slowly extends a primitive limb from the top. 
> 
> 0132: Mass stops growing. The main pile, which forms the base, is approximately 2 meters across and 1 meter high; the limb is roughly 2.5 meters tall and 500 cm thick. The limb proceeds to batter the storage room door with a strength and speed not previously exhibited by instances of SCP-2545-1, even in great numbers. 
> 
> 0133: After seven strikes, the storage room door is forced open, and the initial pile collapses. The secondary group of SCP-2545-1 proceeds to exit the storage room with SCP-2545 in tow.

**Addendum #4:** //The abilities demonstrated by SCP-2545 during Test #9 and the breach strike me as some sort of last resort. I think it's safe to assume that while capable of doing... that, it seems to prefer the usual slow-paced foraging/converting routine.// - Researcher █████████

**Addendum #5:** Following the containment breach on ██/██/20██, it was discovered that all gummy bears within a 75 km radius extending from Site-███ had vanished.
