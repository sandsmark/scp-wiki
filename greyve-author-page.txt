**███:** What exactly is going on?

**Greyson:** Frankly, I have no clue.

**███:** What?

**Greyson:** I mean, it’s //my// author page, but I literally don’t know how this is supposed to go...and at any rate, I have no idea how to do fancy coding stuff.

**███:** Huh.

**Greyson:** But...it’s going alright so far, right?

(//███ remains silent.//)

**Greyson:** ███?

**Greyson:** Oh well. It’s a work in progress anyways.

[[/size]]
[[collapsible show="▼ Commentary" hide="▲ Close"]]
**Summary:** A really forced article with wordplay and a deflated balloon dog.

**Commentary:** My first SCP. Honestly, this doesn't deserve to exist, let alone have a rating of +31 as of writing, but...well. It does. How it came about, I have no clue. I found myself in a really tight spot trying to write a shaggy dog story for Jam Con 2019, but I had told myself that I would actually write something. I spent a lot of time checking out other SCPs for inspiration and formatting ideas. The email transcripts thing took forever to do. They're based on the iOS Mail app, since I wrote SCP-4937 in between and during classes on my school-issued iPad.

Ultimately, not really that proud of it, but...it's a start.

Oh yeah, also, this was my first article to be translated. Thanks to [[*user Xiao Tian]] for approaching me about that. Check it out [*http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/scp-4937 here], if you can read Chinese. He did an incredible job working with the puns and stuff.

[[collapsible show="▼ Commentary" hide="▲ Close"]]
**Summary:** A story about two friends drifting apart.

**Commentary:** This is what I really consider my first SCP. It's executed much better, that's for certain, especially with the cleaner formatting from djkaktus' themes and ACS.

SCP-5117 is based on a single throwaway line from an old idea pitch, but I somehow managed to work it into a relatively cohesive and emotional article. I actually spent a really long time on this one and had no expectations as to how well it would do. I'm not sure how well it would have fared if I'd posted my first draft, but thanks to invaluable help from a lot of people, especially [[*user HammerMaiden]].

The story was sort of personal, since the guy who used to be my best friend IRL started drifting away from me...on the other hand, I'm still in high school as of writing, and I have absolutely no experience with relationships so I have no clue how I managed to characterize Noah. :P

[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5103 The Spiral's Axis]
[[/size]]
[[collapsible show="▼ Commentary" hide="▲ Close"]]
**Summary:** Just short of an SCP-001 proposal, about the machine that allows reality to stay human.

**Commentary:** This one started out as a really ambitious SCP-001 proposal, but I chickened out at the last second and posted it as SCP-5103. No clue how it would have fared there, but I don't trust myself enough...

SCP-5103 is sort of about what makes reality //real//. I tossed this one into the IRC quite a bit, where it was commonly referred to as "recycling reality". I guess that's a pretty accurate description, but I stuck with "Spiral's Axis" because it sounds cooler.

Halfway through writing it, I became really unsure what the heck I was doing because of all the fancy time travel stuff, so I decided to make it half as short as I intended. Probably a good choice, honestly.

But yeah, this has still got a lot. Pattern screamers, reality distortions, Scranton Reality Anchors, and time travel. Originally was going to have some Church of the Second Hytoth stuff, too, since it just makes sense, but I ended up cutting that since it weakened the narrative. 

By the way, if any Ortothan writers feel like it, please reference it. It would make my day!

[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5089 Don't Think About Me, I Won't Kill You]
[[/size]]
[[collapsible show="▼ Commentary" hide="▲ Close"]]
**Summary:** Mind = blown

**Commentary:** Originally wrote this for Jam Con 2020, but I added a pretty graphic image so it was removed and disqualified. Still though, I liked the idea enough to try to make it something worthwhile, so I fixed it up into what it is today.

SCP-5089 probably makes sense if you read the whole thing, but that's not to say it's an easy read. My favorite part is definitely the hidden almost fourth wall break.

**Summary:** Site-49 Cafeteria Director Thomas Assange is the universe's Chef Supreme.

**Commentary:** Wrote this for Jam Con 2020. "Delicious" is a pretty interesting word to use for a prompt, and I was initially pretty put off by it. However, after seeing other people's posts being kind of all over the place as well, I decided I might as well finish the darn thing. I'm most happy with the ending.

Fun fact, in the original version, the third contestant was none other than Gordon Ramsay. That led to a bunch of fun dialogue, and a really interesting interview. But that was cut because it just felt really forced.

[[collapsible show="▼ Commentary" hide="▲ Close"]]
**Summary:** Me.

**Commentary:** A short work that I consider my magnum opus. It's really about me, so yes, all that data is basically true. Please don't stalk me.

Obviously I had a lot of inspiration for this one. The original idea came over a year ago, and additional inspiration came in the form of [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3999 SCP-3999]. I'm realy on the fence about this article because it almost feels to contrived, and hardly an SCP, but...well. It's pretty meta, I guess. +1 or -1, thanks for reading.
