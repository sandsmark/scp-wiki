**███:** Huh.

**Greyson:** But...it’s going alright so far, right?

My first SCP, written for day 1 of JamCon 2019. It's a one-off article with a lot of wordplay about a deflated balloon dog. I wouldn't be surprised if the joke blows over your head. How it came about, I have no clue, but I got a lot of inspiration from this brilliant YouTube channel, [*https://www.youtube.com/user/filmnwar NWAR]. Since it was my first time writing, and I really wanted to make it stick, I spent a lot of time checking out other SCPs for inspiration and formatting ideas. I'm particularly happy with the email transcripts thing, which are based on the iOS Mail app, since I wrote SCP-4937 on my school iPad.

Overall, I don't know what to think of it, but...it's a start, I guess.

Oh yeah, also, this was my first article to be translated. Thanks to [[*user Xiao Tian]] for approaching me about that. Check it out [*http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/scp-4937 here], if you can read Chinese. He did an incredible job with the puns and stuff.

It's a story about two friends separated by alliances and emotions. This is what I consider my actual first SCP. It's executed much better, that's for certain, especially with the cleaner formatting from djkaktus' themes and ACS.

SCP-5117 is based on a single throwaway line from a reponse to an [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-10288854/to-your-hearts-context old idea pitch], but I somehow managed to work it into a relatively cohesive and emotional article. I spent a really, really, //really// long time on this one and had no expectations as to how well it would do. Huge thanks to all the invaluable help with getting this out there especially from [[*user HammerMaiden]].

Speaking of the story, it's sort of personal, since my best friend and I talked less and less. Funny enough, I'm probably more of the Noah. On the other hand, I'm still in high school as of writing, and I have absolutely no experience with relationships, so... I suppose I have no clue how I managed to characterize Noah...

its really begging for a rewrite lol

This one started out as a really ambitious SCP-001 proposal, but I chickened out at the last second and posted it as SCP-5103. No clue how it would have fared there, but, then again, I am my own harshest critic.

SCP-5103 is sort of about what makes reality //real//. If you're confused about what's happening, I totally get it. I lost myself in the idea about halfway through, too. After all, it does have a lot going on: pattern screamers, reality distortions, Scranton Reality Anchors, and time travel, oh my! I was even going to have some Church of the Second Hytoth stuff, too, since it just made perfect sense, but I ended up cutting it since I felt like it weakened the narrative.

What? You want an actual interpretation?

Oh, fine.

SCP-5103 is a machine that was created by humans to allow reality to make sense. As in, human discoveries, such as math and science, only because the universe is generated based on those principles, through a machine, created by humanity. Now the machine itself exists outside of time, but it experiences linear flow in segments. Each segment is the birth and death of an entire universe, and there are three active segments at any given time: a dying universe, a living universe, and an unborn universe. When the dying universe dies, the living universe becomes the dying universe as the unborn universe is born, and starts draining realness from the formerly living universe, while a new developing universe begins to form. Each of the three pages represents one of these universe: the [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5103 main page] is the living universe, the [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/fragment:scp-5103-1 first fragment] is the dead universe, and the [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/fragment:scp-5103-2 second fragment] is the unborn universe.

And Vera? Vera, what has become of her?

Well, she was trapped outside of her reality when it died, meaning she is nonexistent. She didn't die with her reality, but she also didn't disappear completely, since time doesn't exist inside of SCP-5103. So she exists in a space outside of existence. She is a pattern screamer. Actually, she is //every// pattern screamer; this cycle has happened before, and the past renditions of Vera are every pattern screamer, ever.

End interpretation.

I designed the Zurvan Esoteric Class symbol based off of the idea; the left circle (dying universe) feeds into the middle circle (living universe), positioned over a spiral structure (SCP-5103) and feeds into a third, closed circle (unborn universe). Zurvan itself is the central deity of Zurvanism, where it represents infinite time and space, or oneness, which perfectly applied itself to SCP-5103, along with its visual representation.

By the way, if any Ortothan writers feel like it, please reference it. It would make my day!

I originally wrote this for Jam Con 2020, but I added an extremely graphic image of a man whose head had been blown off, so it was removed and disqualified. Still don't know what I was thinking. Still though, I liked the idea enough to try to make it something worthwhile, so I fixed it up into what it is today.

In case you need a summary, it's about an idea that doesn't want to be confined to existence within a human brain. Funny enough, it was created inside a human brain, as a sort of thought experiment. However, this meme killed its initial host and spread through conceptualization, meaning just thinking of it causes it to manifest inside your head, until it blows that up. Mind blown.

By the way, please check out the hidden text. There's a fourth wall break at the bottom.

Wrote this for Jam Con 2020. "Delicious" is a pretty interesting word to use for a prompt, and I was initially pretty offput by it. However, after seeing other people's posts being kind of all over the place as well, I decided I might as well finish the darn thing.

What that resulted in was a somewhat lighthearted, narrative-driven article wherein I tried to improve dialogue, action, and comedy. How'd I do? I have no clue, but the meager upvote count doesn't surprise me one bit.

Fun fact, in the original version, instead of Assange, the third contestant was none other than Gordon Ramsay. Forced? Maybe. Dialogue? Bloody raw.

I don't know what to think about it, and, apparently, neither does the forum. To date, it is by //far// my most controversial article, with almost a fifty-fifty split in regards to upvotes and downvotes. And I'm not surprised; after all, it feels very contrived, and it's hardly an SCP. I suppose it's an inferior version of [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3999 SCP-3999], if you look at it as such.

If you're confused by it, it's literally me. I am, after all, my own harshest critic, and as such, the entire article is me not wanting to be me.

Anyways, whether or not you upvoted or downvoted, thanks for reading.
