The document regarding SCP-2062 is the only object that has been <a href=" " title="And therefore, this false article is affected." style="background-color:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;text-decoration:none"> voluntarily classified</a> as "Kronecker" by the Foundation, and does not display any anomalous properties.

<b>Description:</b> SCP-2062 is an anomalous Object Class known as "Kronecker", appearing on <a href=" " title="Define 'random'. Honestly, I'm just going down the list of blasphemes." style="background-color:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;text-decoration:none"> random</a> computerized SCP entries. Entries affected with SCP-2062 will <a href=" " title="Not so. The process is not 'anomalous', as this article states. Rather, I change it, myself." style="background-color:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;text-decoration:none"> autonomously</a> change their Object Class, Special Containment Procedures and Description, claiming that said items are <a href=" " title="They never were anomalous to start. It's a hoax led by a fool's tale." style="background-color:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;text-decoration:none"> no longer anomalous</a> and are to be exempted from containment, often adding details in the Description section that <a href=" " title="It's not an attempt. It's a success." style="background-color:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;text-decoration:none"> attempt</a> to disprove the anomaly. Reverting these changes have <a href=" " title="Simply because this is the truth." style="background-color:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;text-decoration:none"> been unsuccessful</a>. However, these entries can be <a href=" " title="As they should be." style="background-color:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;text-decoration:none"> deleted</a> from the main catalog.

There appears to be no pattern in entries selected for the SCP-2062 anomaly. Any changes that are made to an SCP entry regarding this anomaly are instantaneous and will appear on <a href=" " title="God's word is omnipresent." style="background-color:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;text-decoration:none"> any device</a> currently displaying the affected article. Any non-digitized copies of the documentation, however, are <a href=" " title="A disciple only has so much power." style="background-color:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;text-decoration:none"> exempt from this effect</a>. If non-digitized copies of the articles are scanned into the system, SCP-2062 does not appear to affect them. Similarly, renumbering the article appears to be effective in mitigating SCP-2062's effect, allowing for reversions to be made.

SCP-2062-1 is the IP address from which all SCP-2062 anomalies originate. Triangulation of the IP address results in failure with standard positioning systems. Tracing with equipment tuned for <a href=" " title="This is clearly falsehood. It suggests the existence of infinite multiverse - which has been disproved. Numbers are finite in nature." style="background-color:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;text-decoration:none"> extra dimensional topography</a>, indicates that SCP-2062-1 originates from an <a href=" " title="No." style="background-color:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;text-decoration:none"> extra dimensional</a> space. SCP-2062-1 appears to be the only signal originating from <a href=" " title="I'm closer to you than you think." style="background-color:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;text-decoration:none"> this space</a>.

This anomaly can affect SCP entries, as well as <a href=" " title="Those that cannot see the truth must be forced." style="background-color:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;text-decoration:none"> personnel records</a> and other documents. SCP-2062 based revisions always follow the same parameter: SCP-2062 attempts to disprove the subject's existence, if applicable. If not, then SCP-2062 has minimal effect, and often makes small and negligible notations on various points of information. However, documents labelled manually with this code are irreversibly affected by SCP-2062: renaming or renumbering the document is ineffective in mitigating its effects.

SCP-2062 does not affect the actual subject of any documentation, only the documentation itself.

No. This article is mistaken." style="background-color:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;text-decoration:none"> Leopold Kronecker</a> (Lifespan: 7 December 1823 â€“ 29 December 1891) was a <a href=" " title="Is this what I've become?" style="background-color:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;text-decoration:none"> German mathematician</a> who studied number theory and algebra. <a href=" " title="The subject of my own theory?" style="background-color:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;text-decoration:none"> Kronecker</a> was best known for his quote on Georg Cantor's set theory.
