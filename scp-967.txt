**Item #:** SCP-967

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-967 is to be secured by no less than ten (10) on-site personel disguised as members of "[REDACTED] Recycling". SCP-967 is also to be barricaded with a two meter (2m) high electric fence, with one (1) staff member in control of the electromagnetic crane that is to be kept within 967's perimeter to contain and terminate breaches. 

**Description:** SCP-967 is an abandoned scrapyard located in  ███████, Colorado. Flyovers have shown that SCP-967 is approximately 200m x 500m. The site was abandoned in  ████/████ following a rash of disappearances and anomalous activity. On ██/████, SCP-967 was secured by the Foundation.

SCP-967 is much larger than its outside dimensions would suggest. Researchers who have entered SCP-967 report an anomalous area of land, of apparently infinite dimensions, composed entirely of items consistent with a scrapyard: old cars, abandoned locomotives, mountains of disused watercraft and appliances, and a constant "snow" of fine slag drifting down from a red sky. The passage of time within SCP-967 is consistent with the flow of time outside. Extended incursions into SCP-967 have revealed the presence of detritus and derelict vehicles inconsistent with the current level of human technology.

Teams have also reported the presence of ambulatory creatures within SCP-967, hereby designated SCP-967-1. Specimens apear to be constructed from the same materials as the landscape and generally trend toward an anthropomorphic shape, although quadrupeds and hexapods have also been sighted. All known specimens of SCP-967-1 are inimical towards organic life. Coordinated packs of SCP-967 have attempted to breach containment ██ times. D-class personell attacked by packs of SCP-967-1 are usually [DATA EXPUNGED] before being ritually buried in the scrap.

**Addendum 967-1:** 

//Taking into account a series of coincidential "landslides" and "earthquakes" that appear to disorient and/or trap prey being pursued by 967-1, it has been suggested that 967-1 be reclassified.- Dr. ██████████//
