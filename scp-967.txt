**Item #:** SCP-967

**Object Class:** Euclid. Reclassification to Keter recommended. 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-967 is to be secured by no less than twenty (20) on-site personnel disguised as members of "[REDACTED] Recycling". SCP-967 is also to be barricaded with a twelve meter (12m) high electric fence. All staff members are to be equipped with electromagnetic weaponry.

**Description:** SCP-967 is an abandoned scrapyard located in  ███████, Colorado. Flyovers have shown that SCP-967 is approximately 200m x 500m. The site was abandoned in  ████/████ following a rash of disappearances and anomalous activity. On ██/████, SCP-967 was secured by the Foundation. 

SCP-967 is much larger than its outside dimensions would suggest. A region located in the very center of the area is only accessible by foot, and extends beyond this dimension into an anomalous area of space. Researchers have described this area as consisting of "trash as far as the eye can see". This landscape is composed entirely of items consistent with a scrapyard: old cars, abandoned locomotives, and mountains of disused watercraft and appliances. A precipitation of finely-ground slag has also been sighted on several occasions.  Extended incursions into SCP-967 have revealed the presence of detritus and derelict vehicles inconsistent with the current level of human technology. 

Research teams have also reported the presence of ambulatory creatures within SCP-967, hereby designated SCP-967-1. Specimens apear to be haphazardly constructed from the same materials as the landscape and generally trend toward an anthropomorphic, human-sized shape. All known specimens of SCP-967-1 are inimical towards organic life, and will aggressively pursue and subdue any intruders. Coordinated packs of SCP-967 have attempted to breach containment ██ times. 


Organic creatures attacked by packs of SCP-967-1 are usually [DATA EXPUNGED] before being ritually buried in the scrap. 

**Addendum 967-1:** 

//Taking into account a series of coincidential "landslides" and "earthquakes" that appear to disorient and/or trap prey being pursued by 967-1, it has been suggested that 967-1 does not warrant a separate designation.- Dr. ██████████//
