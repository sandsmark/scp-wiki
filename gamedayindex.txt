//So what is this anyway?//
"Game Day" is a collaborative writing project, in the style of the old "War of the Doctors" massive clusterfucks. It revolves around a massive containment breach at an SCP Foundation containment site and the events that follow.

//So who can participate in this?//
Anyone! "Game Day" is open to any writers who express an interest in participating. The only requirements are that you be a member of the wiki with proven writing ability, either in the form of a positively-rated SCP article, or a Foundation Tale.

//So I've got this fantastic idea for Dmitri and Clef killing everything. . .//
That would be nice if they weren't both lying in a hospital bed hooked up to tubes.

. . . 

Oh, did I forget to mention? All of the senior staff are out of commission for this storyline. "Game Day" posits that these events take place when the major movers and shakers of the Foundation are either injured during the initial attack, or otherwise occupied with other considerations. The heroes of this event are going to be the junior staff members: the nameless L2s and L3s who step up when the shit hits the fan. 

//So why don't we just have SCP-343 fix everything?//
We could. But what's the fun in that?

In the course of writing this story, you're sure to come across "spoilers" that would instantly solve everything. Why it doesn't work, I'll leave up to you to explain.

//So is this official canon?//
Everything involved with Game Day is officially canon within the Game Day storyline. How much of it is canon outside of Game Day is up to you.

//So how do I get involved in this?//
Post on the comment page asking to join up. Dr Gears or Dr Clef can approve your inclusion into the approved writers' pool. 

//So when does this start?//
Soon. . .
