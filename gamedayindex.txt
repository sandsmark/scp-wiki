> Attached, please find my compilation of materials related to the security breach that took place at Site-17 on ██-██-████, and the events that followed. It is my hope that this report will serve as a comprehensive and definitive record of the events that occured on this date, as well as the subsequent series of events leading to the "Bloody Friday" attacks on ██-██-████. . .

//So what is this anyway?//
"Game Day" is a collaborative writing project, in the style of the old "War of the Doctors" massive clusterfucks. It revolves around a massive containment breach at an SCP Foundation containment site and the events that follow.

//So who can participate in this?//
Anyone! "Game Day" is open to any writers who express an interest in participating.

//So I've got this fantastic idea for Dmitri and Clef killing everything. . .//
That would be nice if they weren't both lying in a hospital bed hooked up to tubes.

. . . 

Oh, did I forget to mention? All of the senior staff are out of commission for this storyline. "Game Day" posits that these events take place when the major movers and shakers of the Foundation are either injured during the initial attack, or otherwise occupied with other considerations. The heroes of this event are going to be the junior staff members: the nameless L2s and L3s who step up when the shit hits the fan. 

* //So what constitutes "Junior Staff" anyway?//
It's hard to say, but here's a rule of thumb: Go [[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/SCPFoundation| to this page.]]] The more bullet points your character has under their name, the higher the chance that they're not Junior Staff.

//So why don't we just have SCP-343 fix everything?//
We could. But what's the fun in that?

In the course of writing this story, you're sure to come across "spoilers" that would instantly solve everything. Why it doesn't work, I'll leave up to you to explain.

//So is this official canon?//
Everything involved with Game Day is officially canon within the Game Day storyline. How much of it is canon outside of Game Day is up to you.

//So how do I get involved in this?//
Start writing. Game Day is now an open metaplot that can be joined by any writers who want to contribute to it.

//So when does this start?//
Soon. . .
