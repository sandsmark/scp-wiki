**Secondary Testing Phase**
Objects tested by Agent "Mister" Bibs

**Object:** Beretta 92FS (9 mm handgun). Weight is 951 grams (34 oz). Unloaded.
**Result:** Gun has increased in size and weight, now weighing approximately 2 kg (4.4 lbs). The gun is no longer capable of firing 9mm bullets, owing to its expanded barrel diameter of 2.5 cm (approximately 1 inch). Firing pin is in the shape of a human skull.
**Notes:** //"Is this thing still a pistol? A shotgun? I'd call it a hand cannon, myself, but I know a few people will go into conniption fits over the term."// - MrB

**Object:** AR-15 (Semi-automatic rifle). Weight is 3.9 kg (8.5 lbs). Loaded with 5.56 NATO rounds.
**Result:** As with previous test, gun shows increase in size and weight, weighing 7 kg (15.4 lbs). Steel rod bayonet, 45cm long, is attached. Barrel fires bullets 15 cm long (6 in) and 2.5 cm wide (1 in), which explode on contact with a target.
**Notes:** //"As of this test, Bibs is not allowed to operate firearms, modified or not, on Foundation property."// O5-█

**Object:** A computer printout, listening the differences and standard containment protocols for Safe, Euclid, and Keter-class SCPs.
**Result:** A computer printout listening how to 'process' Safe, Euclid, and Keter-class SCPs. Safe SCPs are to be utilized in ways that allow their abilities to benefit the Foundation. Keter SCPs are to be deployed as weapons against Foundation enemies. Euclid ones are to be destroyed.
**Notes:** //"It's like the Foundation got drunk, hooked up with the GOC, had a kid, locked it in a closet until its 18. Jesus wept."//  - MrB

**Tertiary Testing Phase** 
Objects tested by other Foundation personnel

**Test Author:** Dr. Aeish
**Object:** One (1) Landrover, painted in standard Foundation field operation colours.
**Result:** Vehicle appears to be powered mainly by crude oil, and several pipes that appear to have the sole purpose of venting thick black smoke are also found. Paint colour appears to have changed to red. Structure of vehicle appears to mainly be of riveted iron plating, with several large weld seams visible. Tyres altered from common vulcanised rubber to metallic treads.

**Test Author:** Dr. Welter
**Object:** D-83394, a 35-year-old Caucasian male, temporarily promoted to Provisional Overseer O5-99 for experimental purposes.
**Result:** P-O5-99 ages visibly by an estimated fifty years, gaining a markedly gaunt appearance and hunched stature. Eyes appear sunken. Ordinary Class D garb changes form and colour, becoming a hooded black cape. P-O5-99 immediately calls for security personnel: when none are forthcoming, he attempts to attack research personnel with invisible projections from his fingers. When no effect occurs, P-O5-99 withdraws into the corner of the room, uttering ominous threats regarding humanity's future and promising the execution of all present. Subject demoted and tentatively returned to duties.
**Notes:** //Jeez, I hope this means nothing bad. -O5-██//

**Test Author:** Dr. King
**Object:** A WWII German Army flamethrower.
**Result:** Flamethrower dissolves into two hundred (200) black, spike-covered apple seeds 
**Notes:** //Dr. King removed by medical personnel.//
