**Secondary Testing Phase**
Objects tested by Agent "Mister" Bibs

**Object:** Beretta 92FS (9 mm handgun). Weight is 951 grams (34 oz). Unloaded.
**Result:** Gun has increased in size and weight, now weighing approximately 2 kg (4.4 lbs). The gun is no longer capable of firing 9mm bullets, owing to its expanded barrel diameter of 2.5 cm (approximately 1 inch). Firing pin is in the shape of a human skull.
**Notes:** //"Is this thing still a pistol? A shotgun? I'd call it a hand cannon, myself, but I know a few people will go into conniption fits over the term."// - MrB

**Object:** AR-15 (Semi-automatic rifle). Weight is 3.9 kg (8.5 lbs). Loaded with 5.56 NATO rounds.
**Result:** As with previous test, gun shows increase in size and weight, weighing 7 kg (15.4 lbs). Steel rod bayonet, 45cm long, is attached. Barrel fires bullets 15 cm long (6 in) and 2.5 cm wide (1 in), which explode on contact with a target.
**Notes:** //"As of this test, Bibs is not allowed to operate firearms, modified or not, on Foundation property."// O5-█

**Object:** A computer printout, listing the differences and standard containment protocols for Safe, Euclid, and Keter-class SCPs.
**Result:** A computer printout listing how to 'process' Safe, Euclid, and Keter-class SCPs. Safe SCPs are to be utilized in ways that allow their abilities to benefit the Foundation. Keter SCPs are to be deployed as weapons against Foundation enemies. Euclid ones are to be destroyed.
**Notes:** //"It's like the Foundation got drunk, hooked up with the GOC, had a kid, then locked it in a closet until it was 18. Jesus wept."//  - MrB

**Tertiary Testing Phase** 
Objects tested by other Foundation personnel

**Test Author:** Dr. Aeish
**Object:** One (1) Landrover, painted in standard Foundation field operation colours.
**Result:** Vehicle appears to be powered mainly by crude oil, and several pipes that appear to have the sole purpose of venting thick black smoke are also found. Paint colour appears to have changed to red. Structure of vehicle appears to mainly be of riveted iron plating, with several large weld seams visible. Tyres altered from common vulcanised rubber to metallic treads.

**Test Author:** Dr. Welter
**Object:** D-83394, a 35-year-old Caucasian male, temporarily promoted to Provisional Overseer O5-99 for experimental purposes.
**Result:** P-O5-99 ages visibly by an estimated fifty years, gaining a markedly gaunt appearance and hunched stature. Eyes appear sunken. Ordinary Class D garb changes form and colour, becoming a hooded black cape. P-O5-99 immediately calls for security personnel: when none are forthcoming, he attempts to attack research personnel with invisible projections from his fingers. When no effect occurs, P-O5-99 withdraws into the corner of the room, uttering ominous threats regarding humanity's future and promising the execution of all present. Subject demoted and tentatively returned to duties.
**Notes:** //Jeez, I hope this means nothing bad. -O5-██//

**Test Author:** Dr. King
**Object:** A WWII German Army flamethrower.
**Result:** Flamethrower dissolves into one thousand two hundred (1200) black, spike-covered apple seeds 
**Notes:** //Dr. King removed by medical personnel.//

**Test Author:** Dr. Edison
**Object:**One (1) plastic figurine from the  __Warhammer 40K__ series, identified as a //"Chaos Space Marines Terminator Lord"//, borrowed from Dr. Clef's office.
**Result:** Figurine is now built of an extremely dense metal of unknown construction. No physical change to the figurine itself, although observers feel hesitant to touch the object for reasons they can't define.
**Note:** //Dr. Edison last seen on the next transport to Site-██.//

> **Incident Report - ██/██/████**
> On ██/██/████, the miniature from the above test was accidentally used in a match at a local G████ W███████ store. Upon introduction to the playing field, the store clerk had an apparent seizure. While medical help arrived, clerk was heard to mutter nonsensical sentences such as "But metal //can't// be worth more than plastic" and "That's not in the rules!". After Foundation cleanup of the scene, the rest of the army which had contacted the piece had also turned into a similar metal. Request for SCP status pending, location of Incident does not warrant future surveillance.

**Test Author:** Dr. Welter
**Object:** [REDACTED]
**Result:** [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Test Author:** Dr. Kensington
**Object:** One (1) SLR, one (1) canister of film (unexposed) - Film is placed inside the camera and set up appropriately.
**Result:**  Camera is dull gray in appearance, constructed of iron with Christian symbols etched crudely onto the surface. Images taken with the camera are monochrome, with the exception of red tones.
**Notes:** A similar effect was found using a digital SLR.

**Test Author:** Dr. Zara
**Object:** One (1) steel hunting knife
**Result:** Blade sides carved with a representation of a woman's face, crying dark tears. Blade's edge is notched with hook shapes, making removal from a thrust wound more traumatic. Handle is now of black metal, covered with sharp spikes in such a way that it is impossible to wield the knife effectively without the wielder damaging their own hand.

**Test Author:** Agent Henderson
**Object:** One (1) [[[SCP-1550]]] egg removed from it's plastic casing.
**Result:** [[[SCP-1550]]] specimen possessed enlarged and sharpened teeth compared to other specimens. A spiny, grey and segmented exoskeleton covered its back although legs remained uncovered. Temperament was highly aggressive, attacked Agent Henderson [DATA EXPUNGED] shot repeatedly before expiring. 
**Notes:** Agent Henderson expected to make a full recovery.
