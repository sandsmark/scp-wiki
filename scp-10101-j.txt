**Item #:** SCP-10101

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-10101 is to be given a luxury residence with at least 120 rooms, 15 bedrooms and 10 Jacuzzis inside, and a personal butler. All requests made by SCP-10101 are to be fulfilled immediately, no matter what the cost. So far, SCP-10101 has requested:
* Collected works of his favorite author, Terry Pratchett, hardbound in only the finest skin from endangered species of animals (approved)
* At least 5 incredibly nubile women every evening, for sexual purposes (approved)
* Food of finest quality, including: fugu, caviar, and other expensive foodstuffs (approved)
* A million zillion dollars of pocket money each week (approved)
Under no circumstances is hip-hop or rap music played in the vicinity of SCP-10101. This is because all hip-hop and rap music is absolutely horrible, and SCP-10101 despises it. 

A field of sheer awesomeness emanates from SCP-10101 at all times. This is not harmful most of the time, but it is recommended that non-awesome staff (such as D-class personnel) refrain from approaching SCP-10101, for fear of having their brains fried. 

**Description:** SCP-10101 is an incredibly handsome teenager, 18 years of age, wearing metal glasses. Hair is blonde, eyes are blue. SCP-10101 likes to wear black and dark blue. He prefers wearing jeans. He likes to be called "Jack, the King of Everything". It should be noted that all female staff find SCP-10101 incredibly sexy. 

SCP-10101 loves pineapples and likes sausage. He dislikes chicken and tomatoes. 

SCP-10101 is friendly towards humanity and has helped in capturing or terminating various evil SCPs many times. SCP-10101 has several superhuman abilities, including: 
* Sheer awesomeness; he's like Chuck Norris, Jackie Chan and Bill Gates combined
* The ability to lift 48736598346587.3 tonnes of burden over his head
* The ability to run with the speed of a hojillion km/s
* An IQ of 9873857, and then some
* Immunity to diseases, poison, fire, cold, radiation, acid, disintegration, erasure from reality, any physical harm, death, tofu, your mom, and everything else you can or can't think of
* The ability to (by mere force of will) heal all diseases that afflict any being, instantly
* The ability to transform/manipulate matter and reality in any way he wishes

It should be noted that in the past, for some reason, a certain stupid girl named K████ A████████ has rejected SCP-10101 as her boyfriend, instead choosing another boy who was stupid, uncool and not at all as sexy as SCP-10101. It is theorized that K████ A████████ is a stupid bitch who will one day be sorry for this. 

SCP-10101 had a difficult childhood: his parents were total squares who didn't allow him to play videogames and insisted he come back home before noon. 

Since the beginning of his stay in the Foundation, SCP-10101 has challenged several Keter-level SCPs to battle and won effortlessly. Drat, my butt is already hurting from all that sitting and typing. He has once fought [[[SCP-076]]], despite having - at his own request - bound eyes, tied arms and legs, and plugs in his ears. After the battle, which took a whole of 2 seconds and - of course - ended in SCP-10101's victory, SCP-076 proposed him to join the Mobile Task Force Omega-7, to which SCP-10101 replied: "More like, YOU join my team I'll make one day, wuss!" and laughed in SCP-076's stupid face. SCP-076 was later reprimended for making such absurd propositions to SCP-10101, and was really embarrassed, and apologized. 

[[[SCP-056]]], upon seeing SCP-10101, turned into a small, pitiful man and fell to the floor, weeping, since obviously it couldn't match the awesomeness that SCP-10101 is practically made of. 

SCP-10101 has also effortlessly won several duels with [[[SCP-177]]]. He didn't even look at the board, and just dictated his moves from another room while - at the same time - preparing an omelette, playing Doom III (on the hardest difficulty level and with the monitor turned off), and balancing (barefoot) on a 0.5mm thin barbed wire over a river of lava (with spikes in the river). What's more, SCP-10101 was not informed of the moves that SCP-177 was making, and just guessed them. During each game, the scientists have carefully observed SCP-177's reactions to each loss; it appears that I whistled for a cab, and when it came near, the license plate said "fresh" and there were dice in the mirror. If anything I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought "naw forget it, yo home to Bel-Air!" I pulled up to the house about seven or eight and I yelled to the cabbie "Yo homes, smell ya later!" I looked at my kingdom, I was finally there. To settle my throne as the prince of Bel-Air.
