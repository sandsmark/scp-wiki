**Item #:** SCP-312

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-312 is currently targeting Dr. ███████, who is advised to stay indoors without a view of the sky whenever possible and has been provided with an assortment of wide-brimmed hats to wear outdoors.  He has also been provided with a  security escort to ensure that he never looks directly upwards.

If possible, SCP-312 should be re-bonded to a D-class personnel upon Dr. ███████’s death, as this would greatly simplify research on SCP-312. 

**Description:** SCP-312 is an organism of unknown origin, composed of very thin layers of tissue and filled with slightly warmed air.  It typically floats approximately ███ meters above the ground, although it will vary this in order to follow a bonded subject.

SCP-312 is 98% transparent and able to camouflage itself as a cloud formation, making it difficult to observe. However, based on what we have observed, it seems to be composed of a large ‘cap’ approximately two and a half (2.5) meters in diameter, from which trails a long tube of tendrils approximately twenty-five (25) meters in length.

SCP-312 shows an unusual behaviour pattern when exposed to human beings.  It will select the first human being who passes directly beneath it (hereafter the target) and move to remain at all times directly above the target.  SCP-312 has a limited ability to manipulate the air currents around it, and will use this to maintain its position in strong winds or follow a fast moving target, creating a vortex that grows larger with increased speed.  As [DATE EXPUNGED] targets are no longer permitted to travel by air.

[[/div]]SCP-312 appears to have a single gap in its effective camouflage: the core of the creature can be seen clearly through the tube of tendrils from directly below (the position of the target).  So long as this core remains unobserved, SCP-312 will remain docile.  However, if the target looks directly upwards or the core is observed by any other method (including a bystander above the subject or a recording device), SCP-312’s camouflage will vanish and it will drop to about ten (10) meters above the target and fan its tendrils outward, delivering a paralyzing sting to everything within a radius of about ten (10) meters.  

SCP-312 will then engulf the target and any other animal within about a meter thereof with its tendrils, then rise until it can no longer be seen.  Within about a week, partially digested body-parts and bones will fall from the sky where SCP-312 disappeared.  This indicates that it is ready to bond a new target (the natural death of the target will also cause it to enter this phase).  If no new target passes under the point where the last died within about a day, SCP-312 will begin to slowly drift toward the nearest center of human habitation.

Attempting to prevent SCP-312 from capturing its target after being observed is no longer advised as of Incident 312-2.

Based on incident reports, the Foundation believes there are at least three (3) uncontained instances of SCP-312 in the wild.  Recovery efforts are difficult because SCP-312 often follows a single person for months or years before its effect is triggered.

**Incident 312-2:**  Attempt at remote observation of SCP-312.
D-312-0035, the current target of SCP-312, moved to an underground bunker.  Cameras set up on the surface.  D-312-0035 moved into a direct line vertical line with the cameras.  Footage of SCP-312’s core successfully recorded and stored for later study.  SCP-312 descended as per normal and attacked the cameras with its tendrils, rapidly destroying them.  Instead of returning, however, SCP-312 remained at a very low altitude, beginning to secrete a highly corrosive substance and generate a vortex around itself.  After five (5) minutes the vortex had taken on the appearance of a tornado.  Over the next ten (10) minutes the tornado rose to F5 class.  Twenty (20) minutes after the original observation [DATA EXPUNGED] loss of over ██ personnel and the transfer of SCP-312’s bond to Dr. ███████.
