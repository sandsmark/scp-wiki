**Item #:** SCP-3951

**Object Class:** Keter 

**Special Containment Procedures:** Monitoring of SCP-3951 should be conducted through unmanned drones. SCP-3951-1 is not to be entered without first requesting permission from SCP-3951. SCP-3951 should be monitored for signs of imminent movement so that seismic activity warnings can be issued. Engaging in conversation with SCP-3951 should be avoided. No domesticated dogs should be brought into the presence of SCP-3951 while the dog is accompanied by a human. 

**Update:** After the events of 12/14/16, no unnecessary contact is authorized at this time.

**Description:** SCP-2871 is a 362 meter long white Arctic wolf, capable of speech in Inuktitut. SCP-2871 is located in the Arctic Circle at ██ degrees North, ███ West. SCP-3951 will tolerate the presence of humans, but engaging it in conversation on subjects that it dislikes will often result in it consuming the person talking to it. It will often consume its victims in a drawn-out and prolonged manner - it has been hypothesized that this is a method of retribution rather than a desire for sustenance. 

A roughly hemispherical cavern in the ice has formed around SCP-3951, with an entrance facing south. This formation has been designated SCP-3951-1. Occasionally, herds of caribou or downs of arctic hares will appear within SCP-3951-1; SCP-3951 will then consume them. The survivors will escape into cracks in the ice and dematerialize. These herds appear to be SCP-3951's food source, generated at will.

Embedded in the eastern side of SCP-3951-1 is a waterfall 80 meters in height that generates a mixture of caribou blood, rendered seal fat, and fermented reindeer milk. This feature is designated SCP-3951-2. Pods of harp seals can sometimes be found swimming in the pool that has formed below SCP-3951-2, which SCP-3951 will then consume. It is theorized that, much like the aforementioned caribou and rabbits, these seals appear only when SCP-3951 is hungry.

 SCP-3951 never exits SCP-3951-1 and exhibits little movement, mainly shifting from laying on its back to laying on its side and vice versa. However, if SCP-3951 were to actually leave SCP-3951-1, the resulting seismic damage would be catastrophic. Its paws are oversized and its legs appear to be thicker relative to its body than a non-anomalous wolf, suggesting it could be capable of supporting itself despite its immense size and weight. 

SCP-3951 continuously drinks from SCP-3951-2, showing the ability to start and stop the flow of liquid at will. Due to the alcohol content of the substance, SCP-3951's behavior shows signs of severe inebriation - specifically, slurred speech and a tendency towards publicly airing its grievances.

SCP-3951 was located after satellite imagery found enormous canid footprints leading to SCP-3951-1 dating back to the Holocene epoch. SCP-3951 does not appear to have left SCP-3951-1 since.

> **Interview Log 1:**  
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Arnatsiaq
> 
> **Interviewed:** SCP-3951
> 
> **Date:** 12/11/16
> 
> **Information:** SCP-3951 had remained awake for 2 months. This was the longest period of wakefulness exhibited by SCP-3951 since its discovery in 1964. Previous times had been far shorter in duration - usually 3 to 6 days. Contact was initiated in hopes of gaining coherent information about SCP-3951. It is of note that SCP-3951's eyes were closed when Dr. Arnatsiaq approached.
