Have you ever had that feeling? When you drive home from work, or walk home from the store, or do just about anything you've done a thousand times in your life. And you are almost home already, when you suddenly realize that you don't remember how you got there. 

No, that's not right. 

You remember how you finished your work, remember how you walked to the parking lot. 

And then...you must have driven home. 

But details are vague and blurred and when you try to remember them there is just nothing there. 

You say to yourself that this is just a quirk of your mind. You've been driving that same path for years now. Today your mind just shut itself off and let your body do the deed. The price of routine. The only escape from everyday life you have left. Happens to everyone once in a while. Perfectly normal. Nothing to worry about.

You're wrong. 

This is what a class-A amnesiac feels like.
