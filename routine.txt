title:Routine
Have you ever had this feeling. When you drive home from work. Or walk from store. Or do any other thing you've done thousand times in your live. And you are almost at home already when you suddenly realize that you don't remember how you got there. No, that's not right. You remember how you finished your work, remember how you walked to the parking lot. And then you must've drove home. But details are vague and blurred and when you try to remember them there is just nothing there. You say to yourself that this is just a quirk of mind. You've been driving that same path for years now. Today your mind just shut himself off and let your body do the deed. The price of routine. The only escape from everyday life you have left. Happens to everyone once in a while. Perfectly normal. Nothing to worry about.

You are wrong. This is how class-A amnesiac feels like.
