**Item #:** SCP-427

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** 

SCP-427 displays no means of self-locomotion or malicious intent at this time, and requires only minimal containment. Due to SCP-427's adverse effects, only medical staff of class 3 or above may handle or utilize it.

All personnel using SCP-427 must record their total time using it in order to avoid unwanted mutations.

Flesh Beasts created by SCP-427 must be killed immediately as it is impossible to communicate with or experiment on them safely.


**Description:** 

SCP-427 is a small, spherical, ornately carved locket made of a polished silver material. Why it has such an artistic appearance is unknown. Its circumference at widest point is roughly 3cm. 

SCP-427 was created after placing a pill of [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-500 SCP-500] in the Input booth of [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-914 SCP-914] and using the Fine setting. It displays no unusual activity when closed. When opened, A small glowing orb is visible at the center. The orb emits no radiation or energy aside from the visible spectrum.

When SCP-427 is opened and exposed to organic tissue, it rapid regenerates cellular damage and somehow is able to purge invading compounds or infections. As a standard of measure, the Common Cold takes 3 to 10 days to be worked through the human immune system and eventually removed. In the presence of an opened SCP-427, this time is reduced to 2 to 4 minutes. Its healing abilities are directional, and anything not in a line of sight with the central orb experiences no effects.

However, long term exposure produces a significant health hazard. As the locket heals damage, it optimizes the body's natural systems. Resistance to disease and toxins is increased by 500% after a total 10 minutes of exposure, and 1000% after 15. After 15 minutes of exposure, muscular systems begin optimizing, increasing strength and pain tolerance by 200-300%. All other systems continue to evolve and advance towards a "biological singularity". Class-D personnel  exposed to the device for over and hour total began mutating into a shapeless mass of tissue. The conversion time accelerates with even further exposure. 
The "Flesh beasts" created by SCP-427 are incredibly aggressive, attacking any and all personnel on sight with lethal results. They are highly resistant to most known weaponry, but can be disabled with sufficient shock trauma or heat in excess of 2000 degrees Fahrenheit. Intelligence cannot be accurately gaged, but mapping of biological enhancement of the brain as a direct relationship with optimization of other systems suggests IQ could be in excess of 400 when fully transformed. 

SCP-427 is currently being used as a partial replacement for SCP-500 pills, as it can cure most anything SCP-500 is able to. Oversight has deemed the side effects an "acceptable risk" but users must carefully record their total exposure time as sufficient mutations are grounds for termination.
