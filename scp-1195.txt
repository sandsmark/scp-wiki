**Item #:** SCP-1195

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1195 is to be stored in a 6m by 6m by 3m standard containment chamber.  Due to the generally amicable disposition of SCP-1195, only a single guard is to be stationed at the entrance into the chamber, whose purpose is primarily to prevent unauthorized access by personnel.  The chamber is to be locked by keypad, the combination known to the current researcher, and changed in the event of a new researcher.

--SCP-1195 is to be placed on a standard lecture podium for ease of reading, unless being dictated to or otherwise being used in experimentation-- SCP-1195 is to be placed on a 1.3m steel podium which is to be bolted to the floor of the containment chamber.  It is to remain on this podium during testing.  Any experimentation involving intentional provocation of SCP-1195 is to be conducted in accordance with standard foundation Thermal and Kinetic Safety protocols.  Personnel are instructed to cease any oration that is seen to provoke an unintended negative response.

**Addendum:**  SCP-1195 is only to be accessed for experimentation purposes.  No further recreational use by site personnel is permitted.

**Description:**  SCP-1195 is a leather-bound book (approx. 25cm x 17cm) of indeterminate but unquestionably ancient origin.  The pages, and the outer cover itself, carbon date to approximately ███ B.C.  The cover itself has sustained substantial cosmetic damage, but still fully functions.  It seems to have a variable number of pages, averaging approximately at 400.

SCP-1195's unique properties become apparent whenever it is opened.  Most often, the first page is found blank, and after a moment, the object will attempt to communicate via written text "bleeding" onto the page.  It will always initially communicate using a variation of the █████ language, but upon being responded to in any other language, it will continue to interact with the spoken/written one instead.  Its method of instantaneously understanding and learning new languages is unknown, and recommended for further study.  SCP-1195 has demonstrated an ability to converse in braille in experiments with blind test subjects.

Upon being "activated" in this way, SCP-1195 will express (with some phrasing variation) a desire to be told a story.  It will not be specific as to what sort of story is being requested, but experiments show a predilection for medieval fantasy, heavy action and ███████████, and varying degrees of disinterest or dislike regarding nonfiction, romance and political writings.  SCP-1195 appears either unwilling or unable to interact with recitations primarily about mathematics and scientific theory.

When a story, allegory or other similarly descriptive speech is directed towards it, SCP-1195 will begin transcription.  If it is not told in a general readable format, SCP-1195 will reformat without noticeable loss of speed in the process.  If allowed pauses during the story, SCP-1195 will offer criticism, encouragement or other comments, depending on the oratory skill, imagination or interest of the speaker.  Generally, SCP-1195 will be willing to continue this process indefinitely, creating new pages as needed for extremely long stories (Though few experiments have reached this length).  SCP-1195 rarely will express open disinterest or anger in what is being spoken (With the exception of ████████████ ██ █████), but it will be noticeably less "vocal" during recitations it seems to have little interest in.

SCP-1195 appears to be sentient.  It does not identify itself by any name or designation (Including SCP-1195) but appears to have a friendly, encouraging personality which enjoys "reading" new literature.  It has expressed no needs or desires other than the continued supply of new stories, although it does not seem to suffer any ill effects from an extended period without interaction.  Although it responds violently to negative input or provocation (see below), these behaviors are understood, predictable and avoidable, making interaction relatively safe as long as guidelines are adhered to.

SCP-1195 has no direct means of locomotion, however it does possess the ability to control the covers and pages of itself.  It generally allows itself to be handled by anyone, save those who have physically damaged it or angered it previously.  In this case, the book will close itself, though it does not become unable to be reopened.  Repeated disturbance by offending individuals almost invariably results in [DATA EXPUNGED] up to ███°C, causing rapid air expansion which generates an outward force of roughly ███ Newtons.  The effect terminates at a 2m radius from SCP-1195.

Any attempts to coax SCP-1195 into divulging information about its origins, history or other personal data have meet with failure.  Both empathy and threats of violence have been wholly ineffective in eliciting results, with SCP-1195 at first politely declining to share personal history, then becoming increasingly terse, expressively angry, and finally [DATA EXPUNGED] are now constructed of steel and bolted to the floor of the containment chamber.

Stories transcribed into SCP-1195 will in most cases not remain long, with the exception of stories of subjectively high quality or substantial length, which may stay for up to █ weeks.  Most often, any previous story is erased as soon as a new subject arrives.  SCP-1195 appears to remember certain individuals, and, based on previous story quality and other experiences, will show varying levels of excitement and cooperation during subsequent sessions.

Attempts to damage the book have met with varied results.  It is clear that cosmetic and superficial damage to the exterior is lasting.  As such, experiments must adhere to a guideline that they do not cause further damage to this area.  The pages, however, seem able to be replicated with no upward limit.  SCP-1195 generates additional pages as needed.  If a page is torn, text fades from it instantly and all intact pages shift to make room for the removed text.  Any stub left in the book is "pulled in", and SCP-1195 will [DATA EXPUNGED] often fatal.  In the event of survival, SCP-1195 refuses to interact further with the subject, and voice masking devices have failed to trick SCP-1195 into cooperating with said individuals.

Writing into the book has the same communicative results as speaking orally during initial interaction.  Once the recitation process has begun, however, text handwritten in will be absorbed after a moment and responded to.  For example, a written in note about SCP-1195's choice of formatting a particular paragraph will be considered, and either disregarded, or the format changed. 

**EXPERIMENT LOG**

**Experiment Log 1195-A**
**//Purpose**:  Determine SCP-1195's reaction to different literary subjects.//

**Date**: ██/██/20██
**Summary**:  SCP-1195 Was dictated a fairly cliche medieval fantasy involving dragons, knights and a princess.
**Results**:  SCP-1195 expressed repeated interest and encouragement.  Resulting transcript remained until replaced.

**Date**: ██/██/20██
**Summary**:  SCP-1195 Was dictated an official, commercially sold biography of Ted Kennedy.
**Results**:  SCP-1195 showed little interaction, only pausing briefly 26 minutes in to suggest the subject give it something "original", and eventually refusing to continue.  Resulting transcript incomplete and disappeared shortly after cessation of copying.

**Date**: ██/██/20██
**Summary**: SCP-1195 Was dictated a particularly raunchy erotic fiction story written in the style of a women's romance novel.
**Results**:  SCP-1195 was initially reluctant to participate, but with additional urging, acquiesced.  SCP-1195 was unresponsive beyond basic transcription for the duration of the experiment.  Resulting Transcript disappeared shortly after subject left the chamber.

**Date**: ██/██/20██
**Summary**:  SCP-1195 was dictated an excerpt from the book 'Fahrenheit 451' involving the actions of the firemen.
**Results**:  [DATA EXPUNGED] cleanup crews were dispatched without further incident.

**Experiment Log 1195-B**
**//Purpose**:  Determine SCP-1195's reaction to different forms of physical interaction.//

**Date**: ██/██/20██
**Summary**:  SCP-1195's pages were written on with a standard ballpoint pen.  The words "How are you?" were inscribed by the subject.
**Results**:  Written text was absorbed and responded to with the phrase "I am well, how are you?  Do you have any interesting stories?" by SCP-1195.

**Date**: ██/██/20██
**Summary**:  SCP-1195's page was written on with a standard ballpoint pen.  This occurred mid-session during the transcription of a story involving spies and secret Russian nuclear weapons.  The note written was regarding the spacing of a conversation taking place between 2 characters.
**Results**:  Written text was absorbed and, after 9 seconds, the conversation in question was altered according to subject's written note.

**Date**: ██/██/20██
**Summary**:  Medical staff on stand-by outside chamber.  SCP-1195 first page was torn out after initial greetings were exchanged.
**Results**:  [DATA EXPUNGED] partially outside effect radius, medical team was able to resuscitate and stabilize D-class subject.  SCP-1195 closed itself, although it was able to be opened again.  The page removed, over a duration of 12 seconds, rapidly disintegrated in a similar manner to an accelerated aging process.  Upon opening, the remaining stub of the page retracted into the spine of the book.  D-Class subject later recovered sufficiently for testing and was reintroduced to the chamber.  SCP-1195 refused to interact any further with subject.  The subject was then given a voice modulation device, and again attempted to reestablish communication.  Attempt was unsuccessful.

**OVERSEER NOTE:** //Until further notice, no experimentation is to take place regarding SCP-1195's interaction with other literary-themed SCPs, especially SCP-423 and SCP-826.  The dangers inherent in introducing a sentient intelligence to another SCP must be approached with due caution.// -O5 ████████
