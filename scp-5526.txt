**Item #:** SCP-5526

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** All findings of SCP-5526 will be taken to the Exclusionary Site-08 and monitored by the Overseer Council. Subsequently, all information on SCP-5526 shall be deleted from the historical, religious and folkloric records.

If a personnel member from the Exclusionary Site-08 submits a false event related to SCP-5526, they will be sanctioned at the discretion of the Overseer Council, including lethal methods.

**Update:** To preserve the status of normality, the Ennui Protocol should be enforced when 10% of the world's population is aware of the performance of SCP-5526.

**Description:** SCP-5526 is a ritual whose performance allows an entity or collective, conceptual or not, to attain the state of divinity. The steps to perform SCP-5526 vary according to the dominant culture in the area practiced, but they follow the following patterns:
* The entity or collective must be subjugated to a culture contrary to itself
* The entity or collective must initiate a war against the dominant party
* The entity or collective must shed the blood of the dominant party. Although not specified, it is believed that a greater amount of blood ensures a higher prevalence of SCP-5526
* The entity or collective must worship solar or light elements

When SCP-5526 is successfully performed, the entity or collective will die. An outburst of Akiva radiation originating from the entity or collective will occur, spreading radially through the territory of the dominant party.

It was believed that the entity or collective would additionally cause a CK-Class Restructuring Event. Further studies have concluded that it is a non-anomalous integration, consistent with mankind's history.
