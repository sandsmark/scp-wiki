> **Item(s) Given:** The item exchanged, an estimated value in USD if necessary, and any quirks with the exchange itself.

------

> **Customer:** Junior Researcher David Patel
> **Test Conditions:** Dr. Patel had requested 'extra luck with the lottery'.
> **Item(s) Given:** The $100 voucher from installing a computer.
> **Associated Event:** Dr. Patel won a consolation prize of $50.
> **Notes:** SCP-4602-1 was the originally given voucher, now stamped with the word "REDEEMED".

> **Customer:** Junior Researcher Edward Ramirez.
> **Test Conditions:** SCP-4602 was singing to Ramirez about potential good assignments for career advancement.
> **Item(s) Given:** 1 Credit card (maxed out). When SCP-4602 absorbed the credit card, it was silent for several seconds, before emitting a high-pitched screech and ejecting the card at ███ mph.
> **Associated Event:** The ejected card embedded itself in the middle of Ramirez's forehead. Ramirez would start to experience numerous unfortunate events, mostly resulting in mild injuries. Analysis of the attached card found that all debts related to the card had been paid. SCP-4602 responded to attempted deals by ejecting coins in a similar manner, usually bouncing off of the target's forehead and returning to SCP-4602. This continued until Ramirez compensated SCP-4602 for the payment.
> **Notes:** The message '**PAY ME BACK**' appeared in Dr. Ramirez' apartment. A depiction of SCP-4602, wearing an angry expression with its mouth open, was included. Each unfortunate event would cause the message to reappear, sometimes with exaggerated depictions of the event showing SCP-4602 as the direct instigator. 

> **Customer:** Security Agent James ██████, later revealed to be a double agent for █████████
> **Test Conditions:** Agent ██████ approached SCP-4602, and requested that SCP-4602 assist him by allowing him to steal [REDACTED] and escape the facility undetected.
> **Item(s) Given:** Numerous diamonds and assorted other gemstones, with an estimated value of $10,000
> **Associated Event:** Agent ██████ successfully located and retrieved [REDACTED], and escaped to outside the walls of Site 57 without alerting security.
> **Notes:** SCP-4602-1 instance manifested as a 1m x 1m sheet of cardboard, with an audio device shaped like SCP-4602 attached. The audio device began to play a recording of SCP-4602 loudly congratulating Agent ██████ for his successful theft. The SCP-4602-1 instance was also coated in an adhesive substance, which became glued to Agent ██████'s hand. SCP-4602-1 proceeded to play a 'congratulatory' rendition of //Yakety Sax// while Agent ██████ attempted to escape the pursuing Foundation security. Agent ██████ was promptly recaptured.
> //SCP-4602 seems to possess some level of loyalty to the Foundation, or at least a certain level of cunning to interpret the request in a manner that both allowed it to take Agent ██████'s jewels and avoid significant Foundation backlash.// - Dr. Patel

> **Customer:** Researcher James Kapoor
> **Test Conditions:** SCP-4602 had requested the names of the O5 council. Dr. Kapoor denied, but questioned SCP-4602 further about its ability to trade in information. SCP-4602 offered to demonstrate.
> **Item(s) Given:** The location of a Serpent's Hand gathering. Upon agreeing to this, a trail of green mist was sucked from Dr. Kapoor's mouth and into SCP-4602. Dr. Kapoor was unable to recall the given information after the 'exchange' was made.

Following these directions lead to a small waterfall, where the bones of Benjamin Mendez were recovered.

> **Customer:** Junior Researcher Harvey
> **Test Conditions:** Researcher Harvey had requested luck in the game Fortnite, as to winning in the game.
> **Item(s) Given:** SCP-4602 requested any money Researcher Harvey had on him at the moment. This was only £1.50 GBP, but SCP-4602 still complied with the donation.
> **Associated Event:** SCP-4602 instead did not provide luck with the game Fortnite, but instead on his son's Roblox account, gaining £300 worth of the game's currency, Robux.
> **Notes:** The receipt said, "I'm not going to do much for so little."


> **Customer:** Junior Researcher Dr. Felteich

> **Item(s) Given:** 1 USD, in cash.
> **Associated Event:** 3 hours later Dr. Edison found a pack of chewing gum on his desk, with a single piece of gum missing from the pack. After through tests, the gum proved to be non-anomalous, and was consumed without incident.
> **Notes:** The SCP-4602-1 instance was written on a chewing gum wrapper. Shortly after the manifestation of SCP-4602-1, security footage recorded a piece of gum appearing in SCP-4602's mouth. SCP-4602's mouth then proceeded to make "chewing" motions for ten minutes, followed by several unsuccessful attempts to blow a bubble. 

> **Customer:** Dr. King (unauthorized test)
> **Test Conditions:** Burst into the room in a panicked state, and shouted "JUST FUCKING TAKE IT!"
> **Item(s) Given:** 500 apple seeds, sourced from the "Golden Delicious" cultivar. 
> **Associated Event:** Despite not being a form of currency, SCP-4601 accepted the apple seeds as payment. Dr. King was then escorted out of the containment chamber by security. 17 hours later, Dr. King opened his sock drawer to find that it was full of exactly 500 1-yen coins.
