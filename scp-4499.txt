**Item #:** SCP-4499

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All 19 known instances of SCP-4499 are contained at Ocean Site-7's marine protected area (MPA). Instances are affixed with tracking devices, and are implanted with waterproof shock microchips to deter containment breaches. In preparation for potential future sightings, Foundation webcrawlers are to monitor social media for reports of talking sharks in the Pacific Ocean, and undercover Foundation agents are to be permanently situated at all major fishing and ocean tour hubs. A joint task force between Foundation operatives and members of the Shark Punching Center, designated JTF Sigma-2 ("Adblockers"), has been established to respond to and contain confirmed SCP-4499 appearances.

**Description:** SCP-4499 refers to an anomalous variation of the //carcharodon carcharias// (great white) genus of shark. Instances of SCP-4499 appear identical to their non-anomalous counterparts. Autopsies have revealed the presence of a human-like larynx in subject's throats, hypothesised to be responsible for the anomalies' abilities to produce human vocalisations. Notably, the presence of a standard, immobile basihyal in place of a human tongue should still impede the pronunciation of numerous sounds, particularly velar and alveolar consonants, however listeners universally report clear and concise speech, often describing it as "smooth" and "charismatic". Research into the possibility of cognitohazardous methods of information transfer are ongoing.

Electroencephalography on SCP-4499 instances reveals increased activity in the left frontal lobe, atypical of standard variants, likely responsible for the ability to process and articulate complex phonetics. Despite speech capabilities however, SCP-4499 instances do not respond to conversation prompts, instead engaging in infomercial-style "sales pitches" for various anomalous objects[[footnote]]Refer to addendum 4499/A.1 for a list of SCP-4499 sponsored products.[[/footnote]] directed towards any humans in close proximity. How SCP-4499 obtains information on these anomalies is currently unknown, and priority status has been assigned to the containment of advertised products not currently in Foundation custody.

The length of an advertisement varies significantly: common sales pitches last anywhere from 30 seconds to 60 minutes, however on █ occasions a monologue was recorded lasting in excess of ██ hours. Post-test interviews reveal that approximately 85% of subjects report a vested interest in buying the advertised product, stating they were "thoroughly convinced" of its necessity by SCP-4499. This is not believed to be the result of any anomalous influence, but instead the highly convincing nature of SCP-4499's advertisements.

**Addendum 4499/A.2: Unusual documented activity**
On ██/█/20██, surveillance equipment monitoring SCP-4499's MPA detected audio patterns consistent with speech. Video recording confirms the following conversation occurred exclusively between two SCP-4499 instances, designated SCP-4499-1 and SCP-4499-2.
> **SCP-4499-1:** I dunno, man, I just don't think a statue that kills you when you blink has much of a market.
> **SCP-4499-2:** No no trust me: this thing is //cool//. I can name 10, 20 anomalous zoos that would //kill// to have one of these things!
> **SCP-4499-1:** Dude it literally smears faeces everywhere, nobody's paying to see that. Besides, it won't do anything if everyone's watching it.
> **SCP-4499-2:** Shit, you've got a point. What about that chainsaw that turns inanimate objects into ghosts?
> **SCP-4499-1:** I think you've got something there - imagine the aesthetic appeal for goths, or haunted house owners.
> **SCP-4499-2:** Yeah, that's my angle. Here's what I've got so far:
> //[SCP-4499-2 makes a sound resembling a throat clear//]
> **SCP-4499-2:** Have you ever looked at the bright, colorful world around you and thought "this happy-go-lucky crap is really cramping my vibe"? Then do we have the product for you! Introducing the chain-saw: the number one product for making what you see, what you saw!"
> **SCP-4499-1:** Oh that's nice, man. Loving the tongue-in-cheek slogan, really catchy.
> **SCP-4499-2:** Yeah, I think I've got a best seller here. Commission's gonna be through the roof! Definitely gotta see what Steve has to say about this.
> //[Both SCP-4499 instances depart and the conversation ends.]//
> **Concluding Statement:** No further conversations have been recorded between any SCP-4499 instances. Foundation attempts to identify the chainsaw in question are ongoing.
