title:Clef Dies
**Disclaimer**  This was a joke. Please don't shoot me.



 Alto Clef waited. The lights above him blinked and sparked out of the air. There were demons in the base. He didn't see them, but had expected them now for years. His warnings to Docter Broight were not listenend to and now it was too late. Far too late for now, anyway.
      Clef was a agent for fourteen years. When he was young he watched the containment and he said to dad "I want to be in the Foundatin daddy."
      Dad said "No! You will BE KILL BY SCPS"
      There was a time when he believed him. Then as he got oldered he stopped. But now in the space station base of the UAC he knew there were demons.
      "This is Broight" the radio crackered. "You must fight the SCPs!"
      So Clef gotted his palsma rifle and blew up the wall.
      "HE GOING TO KILL US" said the SCPs
      "I will shoot at him" said 682 and he fired the rocket missiles. John plasmaed at him and tried to blew him up. But then the ceiling fell and they were trapped and not able to kill.
      "No! I must kill the SCPs" he shouted
      The radio said "No, Clef. You are the SCPs"
      And then Clef was 076.
