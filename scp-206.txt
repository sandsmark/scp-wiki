**Item #:** SCP-206

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** As SCP-206 is currently unable to be secured, an information suppression plan has been put into effect to conceal its existence. Frequencies known to be used by SCP-206 are to be monitored, and all images relayed to Earth via other probes or satellites deleted from non-Foundation assets after they have been retrieved. Technology and astronomy websites, journals and periodicals are to be monitored for discussion of the rover or the receipt of unusual photographs (see Document 206-AA12 for complete list). Persons who become aware of the existence of SCP-206 are to be administered amnesiacs.

**Description:** SCP-206 is an exploratory rover (Designation - //Invictus//) that was sent to Mars on 12/08/20██ in a joint Russian Space Research Institute / European Space Agency effort. Exact object specifications are listed in Document 206-AA1. //Invictus// was successfully launched into space on a //Soyuz-FG// rocket. On 16/01/20██, telemetry data from the craft was lost, roughly halfway to Mars. Attempts to re-establish communication failed, and on 10/02/20██ both the rocket and rover were declared lost.

On 07/06/20██ (the date //Invictus// was planned to arrive on the Martian surface) a connection was established with ESA flight control on //Invictus//' assigned frequency. Before terminating at the source, 38 photographs were transmitted, appearing to show views of the expected landing zone in the Victoria Crater. Three days later, a further batch of 11 images was received, showing a drastically different location (later determined to be in the Cydonia Mensae, roughly 2500km due south).

The Foundation was informed of the incidents by operatives at the ESA shortly thereafter, and moved to investigate. Containment procedures were instituted on 21/06/20██, when ESA Control received a batch of 5 images showing panoramic views of the Martian surface, apparently taken from its satellite Deimos. How the rover (which, as designed, is rated at maximum speed of 90m per hour on flat ground) travelled between these locations is currently unknown.

SCP-206 contacts Earth sporadically, utilising its original channel, [DATA REDACTED]. Once a connection is established, it uploads a number of images in varying formats. Tracking stations have received a total of ████ images (See addendum 1). Most of these images (roughly 38%) appear to be have been taken on Earth, or worlds similar to it (differing in some detail). The remaining photographs seem to have been taken on various celestial bodies, only a small percentage of which are currently known. Periods between transmission vary considerably; the shortest registered to date is 26 hours, the longest 511 hours. 

NOTE: Though SCP-206 generally uses [DATA REDACTED], on at least 5 occasions images have been transmitted to (or via) civilian or military space assets. No connection between the image sets in question has been found. See Incident Log SCP-206 for more details.

At the time containment was instituted, it was unknown whether the transmissions originated from the probe itself, or if an unknown entity had simply co-opted the frequency and was impersonating the rover. Pictures received do not always correspond to the hardware originally installed on //Invictus//, though the signature and session initiation packets match.

However, on 13/08/20██, SCP-206 transmitted a photograph of what was identified as a profile view of one of the Apollo program Lunar Laser Ranging Experiments. Nearby orbital assets were re-tasked to survey the relevant regions, revealing tracks closely resembling those a rover the size and shape of //Invictus// could be expected to leave. On 30/11/20██ Japanese lunar orbiter //SELENE// captured the vehicle itself during a camera calibration session over the Shackleton Crater. Four hours later, SCP-206  uploaded a new image showing a view of the same region. Since then, SCP-206 has been captured by several satellites in various locales - see Sighting Log SCP-206.

Despite visual confirmation of the existence of something resembling the rover, no trace of it has been found in the received images, even when the scene includes a reflective surface. Further, a number of photographs show locations exceedingly difficult, if not impossible for a rover the size and shape of //Invictus// to access.

//**UPD 15/02/20██:** As a result of Incident 206-1 the majority of the images and descriptions were lost. Remaining data listed below.//

||~ Date ||~ Amount of images||~ Description ||~ Images ||
|| 07/06/20██ || 38 || The images seem to have been taken during SCP-206's landing on Mars. The first image is taken 3 kilometers above Victoria Crater (the intended landing point) and shows the crater itself. The rest of the images show the same crater from lower positions. The last image looks like it was taken after the landing and depicts Cape Verde (north-eastern part of Victoria Crater). || [DATA LOST] ||
|| 10/06/20██ || 11 || Mars, Cydonia Mensae || [DATA LOST] ||
|| 17/06/20██ || 1 || The image depicts the //Spirit// Mars rover, which at the time was heading to Mount Independence (about ████ км from Cydonia). Nothing unusual was recorded on //Spirit// sensors that day. || [[image http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img11s.jpg link="*http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img11.jpg" width="100px"]] ||

|| 14/12/20██ || 1 || Racetrack Playa, Death Valley, USA. Image shows the trace of one of the "sailing stones". Judging by the lower part of the image, as well as the stone's trajectory, the image seems to have been taken from one of the sailing stones. || [[image http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img15s.jpg link="*http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img15.jpg" width="100px"]] ||
|| 07/02/20██ || 1 || 29 boxes with light bulbs. The place was not actually determined; judging by the doors it's a subway entrance in one of the Northern hemisphere cities. || [[image http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img1s.jpg link="*http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img1.jpg" width="100px"]] ||
|| 11/02/20██ || 1 || A metal construction of a humanoid figure on a horse-like four-legged creature. Both the "rider" and the "horse" seem to be composed of multiple small details. || [[image http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img2s.jpg link="*http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img2.jpg" width="100px"]] ||
|| 21/04/20██ || 1 || A device, later recognized to be an //Universal// tractor residing on the porch of Belgorod regional study museum (Belgorod, Russia). || [[image http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img17s.jpg link="*http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img17.jpg" width="100px"]] ||
|| 11/09/20██ || 41 || Thirteen images show a funeral mass in a church (later determined to be St. Jerome, Noordwijk, Netherlands). The rest depict a burial of a man in the aforementioned church graveyard. The man was later determined to be D█████ I████████, chief structural engineer of the //Invictus// Mars rover project. || [DATA LOST] ||
|| 12/09/20██ || 1 || Gravestone of D█████ I████████. The image is smudged; some dark liquid stains were present on the camera lens at the moment of filming. Later investigation found SCP-206 tracks near the grave and two [REDACTED] of unknown breed. || [DATA LOST] ||
|| 24/02/20██ || 1 || Mount Rushmore with the face of Jefferson Davis instead of Abraham Lincoln. One of the first photographs to depict an Earth different from the 'original'. || [[image http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img6s.jpg link="*http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img6.jpg" width="100px"]] ||
|| 03/07/20██ || 1 || Moscow Kremlin. The image appears to be taken from the Greater Stone Bridge. The walls and towers are white, although judging by the vegetation and people caught on film, the time the image was taken is consistent with the time it was received. || [[image http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img7s.jpg link="*http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img7.jpg" width="100px"]] ||

|| 15.09.20██ || 1 || Taj Mahal, Agra, India. Judging by the perspective, the image was taken from the main spire. The structure doesn't look any different from the one we know, but the domes are adorned with gilded symbols that don't belong to any known alphabet. || [DATA LOST]  ||
|| 30/11/20██ || 8 || The Moon, Copernicus crater. Japanese space probe //Kaguya// has caught SCP-206 on camera here approximately at the same time. || [[image http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img12s.jpg link="*http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img12.jpg" width="100px"]][[span style="color:white"]].[[/span]][[image http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img13s.jpg link="*http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img13.jpg" width="100px"]] ||

**Addendum 206-02:**
[[collapsible show="Incident 206-1" hide="Incident 206-1"]]

On 12/02/20██ Dr. Karazin, the SCP-206 research project leader destroyed every copy of the archive of SCP-206 images. Only a few images and some descriptions were restored. He explained his actions as a response to "SCP-206 threatening him and his children". Dr. Karazin is currently under arrest, pending the results of the investigation. It should be noted that not long before the incident Dr. Karazin has started to analyze the image archive as a whole and began development of a method for capturing SCP-206.

**Post-Incident 206-1 interrogation log of Dr. Karazin:**

> **Interviewee:** Dr. A. Karazin, ex-project leader for SCP-206
> **Interviewer:** D. ███████, Site 7 security chief
> 
> **<Begin log>**
> 
> **D. ███████:** Good day, doctor. You already know who I am, so let's cut to the chase. Why did you delete the SCP-206 images?
> 
> **Dr. Karazin:** Because I had no choice. The skip made it clear that if I continued my research, I'd die, as would my children. This way, only I will come to harm.
> 
> **D. ███████:** And how did it "make it clear"?
> 
> **Dr. Karazin:** It started a month ago. I found two pictures in my mailbox. One was of the Victoria Crater on Mars - I've checked that later, it was an exact copy of the very first photo sent by 206. The second image was more interesting - it showed //Invictus// itself in one of our containment cells, surrounded by some strange devices. Sure thing, I ran to Site 7 to check it out. To my disappointment, SCP-206 was not captured and no new images came from it.
> 
> **D. ███████:** That was confirmed by others. Why didn't you report the found photos and place a copy into the archive?
> 
> **Dr. Karazin:** Frankly, I thought that was some stupid prank played by my colleagues. After all, I wasn't the only one who had access to the archive. I thought the second picture had to be a fake. And by the time I finally understood that the photos were actually coming from 206, it was already too late - it made it clear that if I want my children to stay alive and well, reporting to the Foundation is out of question.
> 
> **D. ███████:** What actually happened? 
> 
> **Dr. Karazin:** The photos started appearing in my mailbox on a daily basis. They came in pairs - one always showed SCP-206 in a containment cell, another was different all the time. For a few days they were just copies of the archived images. Then came photos of me - me walking out of my home, getting into my car, waiting in a traffic jam... That was the time I became completely sure this is an idiotic prank.
> 
> At first I tried to pay no attention, but when a picture of my daughter in kindergarten appeared one day, I got angry and tried to find the prankster. There's an electric switch box in front of the mailboxes in my house. I planted a miniature spy cam there. The next day there were three pictures. One, again, with the Mars rover in a containment cell. Another was a picture of me brushing my teeth, and it looks like it was shot from behind of my bathroom mirror. The third one was a picture of me, too. A picture of me installing the spy cam. I ran into the bathroom, removed the mirror and pried the tiles away. Sure thing, not a trace of anything in the wall, or in the mirror. By that time I was sure things are a lot more serious than I expected. Still, I checked the spy cam record. Guess what was there?
> 
> **D. ███████:** I'm the one asking questions here, doctor.
> 
> **Dr. Karazin:** Hell, there was nothing! Not. A. Thing. No one coming to my mailbox. The pictures just... appeared. But that's not all. When I decided it's high time to let Site 7 Overseer know about it, someone rang at my door. [EXPLETIVE REDACTED], it was like I'm in a freaking horror movie. I found a pile of photos on the doormat. Unlike the ones I got earlier, these were double-sided. The front sides had all the same picture - a report of everything that happened, signed by me. The back sides, though... First one was of my son - chained to heating radiator, eyes gouged out, mouth sewn shut. I dashed to the kids' room, saw them sleeping peacefully. I got back to the hallway and started browsing the pictures. The second was of me - throat slit, body lying in some alley. My daughter, hanging in a noose. My son, being ripped to pieces by some dog-like beasts. Me again, hanged by my legs above a steaming pit. My kids' heads on poles. Me again, belly split open, guts hanging outside.
> 
> It was horrible. I don't remember the rest, but it didn't repeat even once. As I laid the last picture aside, there was another ring at my door. I was too shocked by what I saw, so I opened the door without thinking. Again, no one in sight and another pile of photos on the floor. This one had an image of SCP-206 in its chamber on the front sides and my family murder scenes. Another ring and another photo. On the front side was me, sitting in front of a computer in my office. A deletion process can be seen on the desktop - the SCP-206 image archive being deleted. On the backside - clearly these were my kids, more grown up, having fun in a theme park of sorts. I got the point.
> 
> **D. ███████:** So you deleted all the data we had on the object?
> 
> **Dr. Karazin:** Yes, I dropped the whole image database and relevant stuff - analysis results, my preliminaries on its capture, the backups. 206 was pretty clear on what it wanted. It wants to be left alone.
> 
> **D. ███████:** What did you do to those images you received? And the spy cam video?
> 
> **Dr. Karazin:** Oh, these I got rid of in the first place.
> 
> **D. ███████:** That's really sad, because there is no proof to make me believe you. Judging by the polygraph, you're telling the truth, but what you said contradicts most of the information we have on SCP-206 behavior. There wasn't a single instance of it sending pictures in person. There are no traces of the object in your house, and usually we can find some. Last but not least, 206 always appears on imagery, yet you say there was nothing on the camera. I'm left with two options. Either you are trying to confuse us intentionally so as to hide something, or someone confused you. Doctor, I sincerely hope it's the second, so please try to remember something more before we meet again. That's all for today.
