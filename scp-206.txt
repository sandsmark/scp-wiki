**Item #:** SCP-206

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The current location of SCP-206 is currently unknown, therefore there are no actual containment procedures. A complex information suppression plan was devised to conceal its existence. It includes jamming SCP-206 radio frequencies, scheduled deletion of the images it sends to Earth via space probes and satellites (although, all image are to be copied and sent to SCP-206 research team) and administering amnesiacs to space agency employees that somehow detected the object's existence.

**Description:** SCP-206 is a Mars rover named //Invictus// that was sent to Mars on 12.08.20██ in a joint Russian Space Research Institute / European Space Agency effort. Exact object specifications are listed in attached document. //Invictus// was successfully launched into space on a //Soyuz-FG// rocket. Halfway to Mars, on 16.01.20██, the connection with SCP-206 was lost. Attempts to reestablish it have failed. On 10.02.20██ both the rocket and the Mars rover were deemed lost.

On 07.06.20██ (which is the estimated date of //Invictus//' arrival to Mars) it went online, reestablished connection with ESA flight control and uploaded 38 photographs that confirmed its arrival and successful landing on Mars. After that the connection was lost again. Judging by the images, the rover landed as intended in Victoria Crater. Three days later a new batch of 11 images was uploaded, showing a drastically different location. Research has determined the place to be the //Cydonia Mensae//. This is impossible for a rover with a top speed of 90 meters per hour on a flat surface, as it had traveled a ████-kilometer distance in that time.

Foundation employees working undercover in the ESA then informed their superiors, but //Invictus// was only recognized as an SCP after 21.06.20██, when the fourth batch of images was received. There were five images, all of them showing a view of Mars from its satellite Deimos. Containment procedures were developed shortly after. After some time it was finally confirmed that SCP-206 is somehow able to travel between locations at a great speed. The actual speed was never determined, as time spans between contacts and distances traveled do not correlate in any way.

SCP-206 contacts Earth from time to time and uploads one or several images that can theoretically depict any location. There are currently ████ known images (See addendum 1). Most of these images (circa 38%) were taken on Earth or places similar to Earth that differ from it in a way (see addendum 1 for details). The rest of the photographs depict various places on unknown space objects in unknown regions of space. Time spans are not consistent; the shortest registered to date is 26 hours, the longest is 511 hours, SCP-206 only contacts ESA flight control and uploads the images either directly (mostly in cases of Earth photographs) or via space probes and research satellites.

Earlier an assumption was made that //Invictus// is in no way responsible for the transmissions and the connections are forged data transfers made to look like the Mars rover communications. That can be further confirmed by the pictures that do not always correspond to the hardware installed on the rover; only the signature and session initiation packets correspond to //Invictus//' protocols. This version was put in question on 13.08.20██, when SCP-206 transmitted a photograph of the [REDACTED] corner reflector on the Moon. Space probe //Smart-1// was employed by the Foundation to take pictures of the relevant region. The pictures showed tracks that looked like the tracks //Invictus// could have left. On 30.11.20██ Japanese satellite //Kaguya// depicted //Invictus// itself on one of its pictures. At the same time SCP-206 has uploaded a new image showing exactly the region //Kaguya// was observing. Afterwards the rover was caught by several satellites on the Moon as well as on some other objects including Earth.

Despite everything mentioned above, there are no traces of SCP-206 on the images it sends, even when it photographs reflective surfaces. Some of the images show locations impossible for a rover the size and shape of //Invictus//.

//**UPD 15.02.20██:** Due to Incident 206-1 most of the images as well as their descriptions were lost. Remaining data listed below.//

||~ Date ||~ Amount of images||~ Description ||~ Images ||
|| 07.06.20██ || 38 || The images seem to have been taken during SCP-206's landing on Mars. The first image is taken 3 kilometers above Victoria Crater (the intended landing point) and shows the crater itself. The rest of the images show the same crater from lower positions. The last image looks like it was taken after the landing and depicts Cape Verde (north-eastern part of Victoria Crater). || [DATA LOST] ||
|| 10.06.20██ || 11 || Mars, //Cydonia Mensae// || [DATA LOST] ||
|| 17.06.20██ || 1 || The image depicts the //Spirit// Mars rover, which at the time was heading to the so-called //Mount Independence// (about ████ км from Cydonia). Nothing unusual on //Spirit// sensors that day. || [[image http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img11s.jpg link="*http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img11.jpg" width="100px"]] ||

|| 14.12.20██ || 1 || Racetrack Playa, Death Valley, USA. Image shows the trace of one of the "sailing stones". Judging by the lower part of the image, as well as the stone's trajectory, the image seems to have been taken from one of the sailing stones. || [[image http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img15s.jpg link="*http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img15.jpg" width="100px"]] ||
|| 07.02.20██ || 1 || 29 boxes with light bulbs. The place was not actually determined; judging by the doors it's a subway entrance in one of the Northern hemisphere cities. || [[image http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img1s.jpg link="*http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img1.jpg" width="100px"]] ||
|| 11.02.20██ || 1 || A metal construction of a humanoid figure on a horse-like four-legged creature. Both the "rider" and the "horse" seem to be composed of multiple small details. || [[image http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img2s.jpg link="*http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img2.jpg" width="100px"]] ||

|| 11.09.20██ || 41 || Thirteen images show a funeral mass in a church (later determined to be St. Jerome, Noordwijk, Netherlands). The rest depict a burial of a man in the aforementioned church graveyard. The man was later determined to be D█████ I████████, chief structural engineer of the //Invictus// Mars rover project. || [DATA LOST] ||
|| 12.09.20██ || 1 || Gravestone of D█████ I████████. The image is smudged; some dark liquid stains were present on the camera lens at the moment of filming. Later investigation found SCP-206 tracks near the grave and two [REDACTED] of unknown breed. || [DATA LOST] ||
|| 24.02.20██ || 1 || Mount Rushmore with the face of Jefferson Davis instead of Abraham Lincoln. One of the first photographs to depict Earth different from the "original". || [[image http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img6s.jpg link="*http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img6.jpg" width="100px"]] ||
|| 03.07.20██ || 1 || Moscow Kremlin. The image appears to be taken from the Greater Stone Bridge. The walls and towers are white, although judging by the vegetation and people caught on film, the time the image was taken is consistent with the time it was received. || [[image http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img7s.jpg link="*http://scpfoundation.ru/local--files/scp-206/img7.jpg" width="100px"]] ||

**Addendum 206-02:**
[[collapsible show="Incident 206-1" hide="Incident 206-1"]]

On 12.02.20██ Dr. Karazin, the SCP-206 research project leader destroyed every copy of the archive of SCP-206 images. Only a few images and some descriptions were restored. He explained his actions as a response to "SCP-206 threatening him and his children". Dr. Karazin is currently demoted and under arrest. The incident is being investigated. It should be noted that not long before the incident Dr. Karazin has started to analyze the image archive as a whole and began development of a method for capturing SCP-206.

**Post-Incident 206-1 interrogation log of Dr. Karazin:**

> **Interviewee:** Dr. A. Karazin, ex-project leader of SCP-206
> **Interviewer:** D. ███████, Site 7 security chief
> 
> **<Begin log>**
> 
> **D. ███████:** Good day, doctor. You already know who I am, so let's cut to the chase. Why did you delete the SCP-206 images?
> 
> **Dr. Karazin:** Because I had no choice. The SCP made it clear that if I continue my research, I will die, as will my children. This way, only I will come to harm.
> 
> **D. ███████:** And how did it "make it clear"?
> 
> **Dr. Karazin:** It started a month ago. I found two pictures in my mailbox. One was of the Victoria Crater on Mars - I've checked that later, it was an exact copy of the very first photo sent by 206. The second image was more interesting - it showed //Invictus// itself in one of our containment cells, surrounded by some strange devices. Sure thing, I ran to Site 7 to check it out. To my disappointment, SCP-206 was not captured and no new images came from it.
> 
> **D. ███████:** That was confirmed by others. Why didn't you report the found photos and place a copy into the archive?
> 
> **Dr. Karazin:** Frankly, I thought that was some stupid prank played by my colleagues. After all, I wasn't the only one who had access to the archive. I thought the second picture to be a fake. And by the time I finally understood that the photos were actually coming from 206, it was already too late - it made it clear that if I want my children to be alive and well, reporting to the Foundation is out of question.
> 
> **D. ███████:** What actually happened? 
> 
> **Dr. Karazin:** The photos started appearing in my mailbox on a daily basis. They came in pairs - one always showed SCP-206 in a containment cell, another was different all the time. For a few days they were just copies of the archived images. Then came photos of me - me walking out of my home, getting into my car, waiting in a traffic jam... That was the time I became completely sure this is an idiotic prank.
> 
> At first I tried to pay no attention, but when a picture of my daughter in kindergarten appeared one day, I got angry and tried to find the prankster. There's an electric switch box in front of the mailboxes in my house. I planted a miniature spy cam there. The next day there were three pictures. One, again, with the Mars rover in a containment cell. Another was a picture of me brushing my teeth, and it looks like it was shot from behind of my bathroom mirror. The third one was a picture of me, too. A picture of me installing the spy cam. I ran into the bathroom, removed the mirror and pried the tiles away. Sure thing, not a trace of anything in the wall, or in the mirror. By that time I was sure things are a lot more serious than I expected. Still, I checked the spy cam record. Guess what was there?
> 
> **D. ███████:** I'm the one asking questions here, doctor.
> 
> **Dr. Karazin:** Hell, there was nothing! Not. A. Thing. No one coming to my mailbox. The pictures just... appeared. But that's not all. When I decided it's high time to let Site 7 Overseer know about it, someone rang at my door. [EXPLETIVE REDACTED], it was like I'm in a freaking horror movie. I found a pile of photos on the doormat. Unlike the ones I got earlier, these were double-sided. The front sides had all the same picture - a report of everything that happened, signed by me. The back sides, though... First one was of my son - chained to heating radiator, eyes gouged out, mouth sewn shut. I dashed to the kids' room, saw them sleeping peacefully. I got back to the hallway and started browsing the pictures. The second was of me - throat slit, body lying in some alley. My daughter, hanging in a noose. My son, being ripped to pieces by some dog-like beasts. Me again, hanged by my legs above a steaming pit. My kids' heads on poles. Me again, belly split open, guts hanging outside.
> 
> It was horrible. I don't remember the rest, but it didn't repeat even once. As I laid the last picture aside, there was another ring at my door. I was too shocked by what I saw, so I opened the door without thinking. Again, no one in sight and another pile of photos on the floor. This one had an image of SCP-206 in its chamber on the front sides and my family murder scenes. Another ring and another photo. On the front side was me, sitting in front of a computer in my office. A deletion process can be seen on the desktop - the SCP-206 image archive being deleted. On the backside - clearly these were my kids, more grown up, having fun in a theme park of sorts. I got the point.
> 
> **D. ███████:** So you deleted all the data we had on the object?
> 
> **Dr. Karazin:** Yes, I dropped the whole image database and relevant stuff - analysis results, my preliminaries on its capture, the backups. 206 was pretty clear on what it wanted. It wants to be left alone.
> 
> **D. ███████:** What did you do to those images you received? And the spy cam video?
> 
> **Dr. Karazin:** Oh, these I got rid of in the first place.
> 
> **D. ███████:** That's really sad, because there is no proof to make me believe you. Judging by the polygraph, you're telling the truth, but what you said contradicts most of the information we have on SCP-206 behavior. There wasn't a single instance of it sending pictures in person. There are no traces of the object in your house, and usually we can find some. Last but not least, 206 always appears on imagery, yet you say there was nothing on the camera. I'm left with two options. Either you are trying to confuse us intentionally so as to hide something, or someone confused you. Doctor, I sincerely hope it's the second, so please try to remember something more before we meet again. That's all for today.
