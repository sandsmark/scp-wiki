**Item #:** SCP-4752

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** A 5000km^^2^^ exclusion zone has been established around SCP-4752. Exploration and research teams that come within 100 kilometres of this exclusion zone are to be re-directed to their basecamp under the guise of "seismic activity".

**Description:** SCP-4752 is a large mountain located at the southern end of the Transantarctic Mountain Range resembling a right angle triangle with a curved hypotenuse. Geological studies have indicated that since the late 16th century, SCP-4752's mass has been slowly concentrating beneath its peak, at the far west of the mountain, with no non-anomalous geological explanation. The rate of transfer has been accelerating since the 1980s. As of 2019, 44% of SCP-4752's mass was concentrated beneath its peak.

**Addendum-4752-001:** Geological studies have indicated significant shifts in mass on the following dates, amongst others:

* 33 CE
* December 1792
* 1873 - 1879
* 24/10/1929
* 19/10/1987
* 15/09/2008
* 20/02/2020

**Addendum-4752-002:** On 06/09/2020, GoI-3425 ("Anochists") launched an assault on the west side of SCP-4752 during which an estimated 30% of SCP-4752's mass was lost. Members of GoI-3425 planted a nuclear explosive at the base of SCP-4752's west side and detonated it after a retreat. Following this, world economic output suffered a decline of 26%.
