**Special Containmen' Procedures:** The entrance ov SCP-2935 'as been sealed wiv concrete, an' access ter SCP-2935 is forbidden. 

**Descripshun:** SCP-2935 is a space-time anomaly existin' wivin a limestone cave benearf a cemetery near Joppa, Indiana. The cemetery, whose last in'erred individual died in 1908, was discovered by Foundashun personnel after radio signals was discovered emanatin' from SCP-2935 (//see Addendum 2935.1 below//). 

The SCP-2935 anomaly is a nearly exact replicate reali'y ov modern Earf in da year 2016, wiv da primary excepshun bein' what all life, includin' bof biological an' non-biological, as well as any sentien' entities, machines, computers an' uvver "life-like" phenomena, wivin SCP-2935 ended on April 20th, 2016. 

Infawmashun garfered by da mobile task force who initially en'ered SCP-2935 fer reconnaissance purposes points ter da conclusion what all lifefawms wivin SCP-2935 suddenly an' wivaaaht warnin' expired sometime between da 'aaahrs ov 0300-0400 EST. The reason fer dis is currently uncertain. 

**Addendum 2935.1:** Discovery 

On April 28th, 2016 at roughly 0500 EST, a radio signal was detected by communicashuns personnel at Site-81 near Bloomington, Indiana. This signal, thuff distorted an' unin'elligible, was traced ter da unincorpawated area ov Joppa, Indiana near US In'erstate 70. Site-81 personnel in Indianapolis was dispatched ter determine da saaahrce ov da signal as per Foundashun policy, an' discovered SCP-2935 durin' their examinashun ov da area. 

Upon initial en'ry in'er SCP-2935[[footnote]]By means ov a standard remote surveillance drone.[[/footnote]], da afawermun'ioned personnel was uncertain what they 'ad actually discovered an anomaly, instead believin' their drone 'ad exited da uvver side ov da cave. This was quickly corrected durin' observashun ov da surroundin' area, an' upon pickin' up da undistorted radio broadcast they 'ad been searchin' for. The broadcast, which appeared ter 'ave been repeatin' on a loop since April 20th, was an automated message originatin' from Site-81 wivin da SCP-2935 reality. The full transcripshun ov da message is as follows: 

> This is an automated emergency broadcast from da SCP Foundashun an' yaaahr nashunal governmun'. One awer mawer ov aaahr sites is experiencin' a communicashun breakdown, likely due ter a containmen' breach ov unknown magnitude. All citizens are ordered ter stay in their 'omes as containmen' teams work ter secure da breach. This message'll broadcast from April 20th, 2016 until-- (//message cuts aaaht suddenly an' then repeats//) 

Afterwards, da [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-81|Site-81]]] personnel contacted site command. Mobile Task Force Epsilon-13 "Manifest Destiny" was immediately assigned ter examinashun an' explorashun ov SCP-2935. Know what I mean?

**Addendum 2935.2:** Explorashun ov SCP-2935 

Explorashun ov SCP-2935 by MTF Epsilon-13 an' allk place over faaahr separate missions, free manned an' one unmanned. Durin' deese missions, several artifacts an' pieces ov infawmashun was recovered, an' a full list wiv descripshuns is available in Addendum 2935.3. Nuff said, yeah?

> **Indigo:** Hear what? 
> 
> **Daniels:** Exactly. Shouldn't we be 'earin' a breach alarm? 
> 
> **Roy:** Not necessarily. Breach alarms are automated, but only if any ov da containmen' cells trigger it. Otherwise, they 'ave ter be executed manually. 
> 
> **Keller:** Somebody 'ad ter 'ave gotten ter da office, ter start da emergency broadcast. 
> 
> **Roy:** It was an automated response. If I 'ad ter wager, i' was probably triggered by vital monitors goin' flat. 
> 
> **Indigo:** Vital monitors can trip da emergency response?

> **Roy:** Yeah, we should expect a lot ov that. Anybody recognize 'em?

> **Daniels:** I mean, they're really dehydrated... But that's Desiree Clark, an' Max Westminster. John Cabin over there... This one is Elisa Watson. They're all staffed at 81. 
> 
> **Olmann:** And probably workin' what day, an' all. 
> 
> **Roy:** Anybody know what time they mark off their calendars in da office? 
> 
> **Straight:** Not until first shift shows up. 8AM local? 
> 
> **Roy:** Makes sense. Last check off is April 19th. Keller, patch in'er da system again an' 'ry ter find aaaht what triggered da emergency broadcast. Olmann, yew an' Indigo go check da break room over there. Vada if... I don't know. OK?
>

> 
> **Roy:** Sorry. Shit. I wasn't expectin' dis... Not like dis, anyway. I thought i' would be messier. Breaches usually are, but dis is... 
> 
> **Daniels:** Clean. I mean, they're pret'y obviously corpses, but they're clean. No blood, slight post-mortem excreshuns, but it's all dried up at dis point. Think i' was a disease? 
> 
> **Roy:** Let's get some samples. Swab surfaces, use Indigo's ki' ter check fer microbes. Juno's boys found a 'ouse wivaaaht a trace ov 'em, an' command wants ter know if that's consistent.

> 
> **Keller:** Got it. 
> 
> **Roy:** What's i' say? 
> 
> **Keller:** Butcher's Hooks like da system was triggered at... 0400 'aaahrs, durin' a routine vitals check. Apparently there was a malfuncshun, awer rarfer, da system thought there was a malfuncshun. All ov da vitals transmitters 'ad stopped respondin' since da last check. 
> 
> **Roy:** That doesn't frow up a breach alarm? 
> 
> **Keller:** No, I don't fnk so. It would probably pin' main'enance first, an' then system command, an' then... Site command? If nobody responded, i' would probably trigger a message ter 17, an' if what wen' ignawerd... Maybe Overwatch Command. After those all timed out, i' dropped in'er da automated failsafe, locked down da site, an' began broadcastin' fer 'elp. Then i' waited. 
> 
> **Roy:** Waited fer what? 
> 
> **Keller:** A response from anuvver site. Or literally anybody on staff. I fnk even Gary Neville 1s can rescind timeaaaht lockdowns. Hypothetical, though, I've never seen i' used like that. 
> 
> **Roy:** So nobody came calling. 
> 
> **Keller:** Nobody but us, a couple days later.

> **Keller:** (//In'erfaces wiv terminal again//) Bobkes. It says da program is still running, but no response at all. I'll 'ry... (//pauses//) 'uh. Bobkes from Thorn either. They've all gone quiet. 
> 
> **Roy:** That's odd. Will us bein' 'ere wake da uvver sites up since we rescinded 81's lockdown? 
> 
> **Keller:** Assumin' they're all in da same lockdown as dis one, maybe? No doubt some ov 'em 'ave protocols what require somebody ter be on-site ter break a lockdown. I know Site-27 does, but they've got a pret'y substantial Keter wing. Of caaahrse, we could get ter Overwatch an' unlock 'em what way, I know they can remotely rescind securi'y measures at all da sites.
