+ This page has been temporarily blanked to prove a point

Hey SCPObserver, djkaktus here. I'm the one who wrote 2935, so I can blank the article if I want to. It's really not hard, because it's not a secret government file, it's a piece of fiction on the internet.

Please don't trespass on people's property in order to prove some delusion about this SCP being real. It's not. The most you'll ever find down there is some old beer cans and empty packs of cigarettes. There's no secret anomalous cave. The people who own that property are really nice and it's not cool to creep around their place uninvited.

If you really want to do SCP stuff, join a creative writing club at school or something, and work on your fiction. Trust me, writing collaboratively is a lot more fun than trespassing.

Anyway, if you have any other questions I'll be in #site17. I'll revert this page back after a few hours, so don't freak.
