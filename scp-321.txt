**Item #:** SCP-321

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-321 is to be kept in a regulation containment chamber. It has been outfitted with extensive braces, to make up for weaknesses in bone structure and muscle mass. SCP-321 is to be fed three times daily. Solid foods are excluded from its proscribed diet.Three staff members are on temporary SCP-321 assignment at this time.  SCP-321 is to be given three hours a day of exercise and physical therapy, with the rest of its time not involved in experiments to be confined to its cell. While 321 is incapable of asking for anything, it has been allowed several stuffed toys. 
 
**Description:** SCP-321 is a human female, born on July 4, 18██. SCP-321 is currently 3.1 meters tall, and weighs approximately 110 kilograms. Subject is devoid of melanins in hair, eyes and skin. It is incapable of speech, but can still vocalise, and has proven to have problems with spacial recognition and awareness. SCP-321 has displayed a low degree of intellect, and has problems adjusting to new situations.

SCP-321 was the child of Junior Researcher Adam █████ and his wife, Medical Assistant Evelyn █████. Child was delivered still born. Junior Researcher █████ took it upon himself to make use of several SCPs, including [REDACTED] in an effort to bring his daughter back to life. The procedure worked, but SCP-321 was taken into Foundation custody, for examination.

SCP-321 was quickly found to have recuperative abilities, capable of healing injuries inflicted upon it at approximately five times the normal rate. Subject was at this time entered into Foundation records as SCP-321. In the time since, 321's body has continued to age at a decelerated rate, half that of a normal human.  Although its aging has been slowed, 321 has continued to grow, showing no signs of stopping despite now being taller then any recorded human. At this point in time, it is believed 321's recuperative abilities stem from over abundant production of stem cells, a result of its interaction upon death with [REDACTED].

SCP-321 has a very low intelligence. Every day activities are a chore for it, and it can take several months, to years, to teach it to do such things as use utensils for eating. While SCP-321 has fully developed vocal chords, it seem incapable of learning speech, instead crying and making nonsense noises as of those typically heard from infants under the age of six months.
