Anomalous items errata:

Item Description: An olive wood cup, dated to 1st century B.C. Analysis indicates trace residue of Levantine grape wine, myrrh and human blood in the cup. An Aramaic-language inscription reads "Joseph of Arimathea". The letters "GALAH" appear roughly carved near the base, with the style of lettering indicating a pre-Norman British origin. Cup was found in a bejeweled reliquary case. Anomalous properties include [DATA EXPUNGED].
Date of Recovery: 07-██-18██
Location of Recovery: ████████████████████
Current Status: Lost, presumed destroyed during SCP-682 containment breach on 08-██-████

Item Description: Cylinder of unknown metal, approx. 4 cm in length, 1.2 cm in diameter, which cannot be moved from its present position.  Apparently indestructible.  Geological analysis of the rock in which the item was located indicates that it has occupied its present position relative to the Earth's center for at least 700 million years, notwithstanding thrust faulting and continental drift.
Date of Discovery: ██-██-████
Location of Discovery: ████████████, Kentucky in the course of mountaintop removal coal mining by means of high explosives.  Item was suspended in midair after removal of the surrounding rock.
Current Status: Used as a coathanger peg in new Foundation facility constructed at that location.

Item Description: A laser printer (HP LaserJet 5550dtn Workgroup model) which, due to an apparently unreproducible error, continually produces pages of printed text consisting of seemingly random characters and symbols at a rate of 25 pages per minute when printer is powered on, whether or not any paper is fed into the printer.
Date of Discovery: ██-██-████
Location of Discovery: Accounts payable department of administrative offices at Foundation Site ██.
Current Status: Object remains on site.  The Foundation has applied the apparently infinite supply of paper to a number of useful purposes such as scratch paper (using the unprinted back of the pages), in shredded form as cage lining for animals, and as fuel.
