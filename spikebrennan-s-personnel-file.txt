I created:

* [[[SCP-089]]] (Tophet)
[[Collapsible show="Commentary" ]] 
This is not as old an article as its low number might suggest: the number became available due to the deletion of an older article, and I jumped on it.

While reading about the religion of the ancient Carthaginian culture (why, how do you spend //your// afternoons?) I came across references to child sacrifice.  Specifically, it seems to have been their practice for parents to sacrifice their own children.  The scholarly consensus is still out on how prevalent this was, but there you go.  I'm the father of two wonderful young children, so this practice struck me as the most repugnant and awful thing imaginable.

To make it work as an SCP article, I wanted to play up the psychological horror.  The concept here isn't merely that a child is being painfully murdered- rather, the concept is that the child's parent has to do it.  What's worse, this isn't a case where the parent who is committing the murder is insane, or indoctrinated as some kind of demon-worshiper, or under some kind of outside compulsion.  Rather, the parent has been put in the position of having to //choose// to do this, for the greater good.  I think that at some level, the ancient Carthaginians went through the same process.

But for the Carthaginians, they thought that their sacrifice was necessary in order to obtain the favor of the gods and avert a crisis affecting their own society.  It seemed to me that as an SCP article, the sacrifice would be made even more poignant if the crisis were on the other side of the world, so to speak.  The point of the sacrifice wouldn't be to save the mother's own society, but that of a bunch of strangers.  

Photosynthetic, in the discussion pages for the article, correctly figured out the redacted events that are described in the addendum: the Great New Orleans Fire of 1788 (destroyed virtually the entire city), the Taiping Rebellion (to which tens of millions of deaths in mid-19th century China are attributed), and the 1970 Bhola cyclone in Bangladesh (one of the deadliest natural disasters in modern times).  The 1951 volcanic eruption is nothing specific-- the whole point is that there's nothing in particular that anyone remembers about such an event, because the prompt sacrifice to the Tophet solved the problem.  I'm not going to say anything about the "ongoing" event.

My first draft of the piece involved a somewhat more complicated sacrifice (based on the historic sources) involving turtledoves, cattle, etc. in addition to the human.  But my first draft was poorly received, and for good reason- the lengthy discussion of various animal sacrifices distracted the reader from the intended gut-punch of the child sacrifice.

My next draft only involved sacrificing the child... and was also poorly received.

For my third draft (which is what you're reading here), I simply re-organized the article and buried the lead.  Specifically, I moved the wham line ("For each locution event, SCP-089-A is a healthy, unblemished human infant or child between eight months and six years of age, and SCP-089-B is that child’s natural mother.") further down the article.  

It seems to work.

Yes, at its heart it's an "evil idol demands sacrifice, or else" concept.  I think it's the presentation that actually sells it, and I'm delighted that the article has been well-received.  Djoric featured it in his [[[etdp-hub-page Mary-Ann and Salah]]] tale series.

The inscription on the back is a quotation from Allen Ginsberg's poem "Howl".  Maybe I'll delete the quote- it's intended more as an easter egg.

* [[[SCP-831]]] (Tinker bugs)
[[Collapsible show="Commentary" ]] 
Of all my articles, this is the one I'm most pleased with.

Termites are creepy to begin with, and the notion of termites with an agenda...

This piece pre-dates Smapti's similar [[[SCP-1942]]] by nine months or so.  The two articles approach the same general concept (tool-using bugs) from different angles.  His bugs are basically cute (relatively speaking): they have communicated with researchers and there's no indication that they've ever hurt anyone.  I think mine are creepier because they don't talk to us.  (They're talking to //somebody//, but not us- which is creepier still).
[[/collapsible]]
* [[[SCP-908]]] (Colocated rock)
[[Collapsible show="Commentary" ]] 
Sometimes articles take a long time to write.  This was not one of those.  This fell out of my head almost fully-formed, and I wrote the first draft in about an hour.  I've subsequently played with the test log a bit.

The thing that I like most about this one is the way that I've tried to present how the Foundation would systematically study a phenomenon like this.  Change one thing at a time; try to explore the attributes of the subject in an orderly basis.  In my headcanon, //every// SCP item has this type of documentation.
[[/collapsible]]
* [[[SCP-920-EX]]] (evil workgroup printer) 
[[Collapsible show="Commentary" ]] 
The cutesy premise that I started with was "what if there was a parasite that affected organizations, rather than organisms?"

[[/collapsible]]
* [[[SCP-926]]] (//Guqin//)
[[Collapsible show="Commentary" ]] 
This is another attempt by me to do a non-Western-culture-based SCP article.  I hadn't know about [[[SCP-580]]] when I wrote it up.  (I like 580).  It's not based on any particular existing legend or folklore that I'm aware of, and it's certainly not based on Terry Pratchett.
[[/collapsible]]
* [[[SCP-955]]] (Mr. Sillybug)
[[Collapsible show="Commentary" ]] 
My first SCP article.  (Actually, my second.  My first was- no kidding- the zombiefied body of former US president James Garfield.  It was terrible.)

This one almost got deleted because as initially presented, it lacked the "kids perceive it differently" feature. In other words, it was basically an ugly but friendly animal.  Once I realized that this wasn't enough of a hook to make it worthwhile, I edited it to add the "kids think it's cute" attribute.  This seemed to capture readers' imagination.  Still, I'd like to think that I've improved since this one.
[[/collapsible]]

* [[[SCP-1012]]] (the Secret Chord)
[[Collapsible show="Commentary" ]] 
This is a re-write.  The first draft played a much more Abrahamic religious angle: playing the chord would cause various Old Testament/Book of Revelation types of phenomena to manifest.  Some of the writing that I did for those parts subsequently got worked into other articles such as SCP-1844.

The "it destroys the world at the particle level" part was, therefore, a concept that came later to the process.  Since that's so over-the-top, I figured that the best way to make it work would be to make the containment process over-the-top as well.  So I provided for the deliberate extermination of a (fictional) species of whale, and a worldwide conspiracy to cause speakers and media broadcast signals include cancellation tones.  (Yes, I know that the physics don't really work that way.)
[[/collapsible]]
* [[[SCP-1036]]] (//Nkondi//)
[[Collapsible show="Commentary" ]] 
(placeholder)

[[/collapsible]]
* [[[SCP-1060]]] (Penanggalan)
[[Collapsible show="Commentary" ]] 
This was my entry for the "contest for SCP-1000" (http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-376556).  The challenge was to create an SCP object based on folklore or an urban legend.  My first thought was to submit an entry based on the Jersey Devil, but (1) that isn't much more interesting than a generic cryptozoological beast, and (2) somebody at the time had mentioned on the discussion forums that we have relatively few non-Western culture based articles.  So I decided to borrow something from Malay folklore.  Yes, the D&D Fiend Folio has a similar monster drawn from essentially the same source.  Yes, it's a relatively straight SCP-ification of the folklore beastie.  Not really my best work.

[[/collapsible]]
* [[[SCP-1322]]] (Glory Hole)
[[Collapsible show="Commentary" ]] 
(placeholder)

[[/collapsible]]
* [[[SCP-1512]]] (Irrational Root)
[[Collapsible show="Commentary" ]] 
See discussion of SCP-1844 below.
Yes, Dexanote, the title was intended as a pun with a double meaning.

[[/collapsible]]
* [[[SCP-1746]]] (Anomalous weather pattern)
[[Collapsible show="Commentary" ]] 
I decided that what the SCP Foundation staff really needs is a squirrel wrangler.
More generally, I fell in love with the concept of the Foundation being required to very precisely re-create a very specific series of mundane actions, including something as silly as the behavior of a squirrel.

It's kind of the mathematical inverse of Procedure 110-Montauk.  Where Montauk is (presumably) monstrous, the Foundation must perform it for the greater good.  Conversely, there's nothing particularly special or interesting about Protocol 1746-Aleph.  What's important is that it- whatever it is- be carried out exactly according to plan.  And if you think about any given sequence of mundane events, think of how difficult it would be to replicate that sequence again, exactly, to the level of precision that I mean to imply here.  Especially when it involves things like melting ice cream and squirrel behavior.

This article is a re-post.  First time around (see top of http://sandbox.scp-wiki.net/spikebrennan-storm ), I actually tried to include a long, technical blow-by-blow description of Protocol 1746-Aleph.  And the commentary that I got, before the article was downvoted below -20, was that it was too long.  

That commentary was correct: what this thing needed was for the article to //imply// the content of Protocol 1746-Aleph without stating it outright.  Instead of seeing the machinery, all you get is a brief glimpse of the man behind the curtain- just enough to see that he's wearing clown shoes.

And he's worried.

* [[[SCP-1844]]] (Crater at 31.7███° N, 35.1███° E)
[[Collapsible show="Commentary" ]] 
Want to know what I hate?  [[[SCP-616]]], that's what I hate.  Particularly the fact that (1) "just kidding, it really isn't an actual religious metaphysical phenomena", and (2) whoever wrote the pseudo-"religious" parts just Did Not Do the Research.

I made up my mind to correct that.  But the result was http://sandbox.scp-wiki.net/spikebrennan-scp-616 .  

So I decided to re-work the concept, by keeping the "religious people praying with all their might to hold something at bay" concept, but I decided to put it on a derelict upside-down submarine instead.  Because submarines are creepier than airplanes.  Thus we have the top half of http://sandbox.scp-wiki.net/spikebrennan-submarine .

But that didn't work either- there was too much of a disconnect between the praying, the eldritch thing that was being held at bay, and the submarine setting.  And lots of people hated the "centiakivas" concept.

So I shelved it for a few months, tinkered with it some more, and ultimately broke up the content into two separate, not-obviously-related articles: [[[SCP-1512]]] (the Irrational Root) and this one.  Taken separately, they both seem to work.  I guess the lesson is not to try to pack to many disparate concepts into a single SCP work: pick a limited number of ideas, and use your excess ideas for a different piece.

I still hate SCP-616.

[[/collapsible]]
* [[[SCP-2008-J]]] (Cryptozoological life form)
[[Collapsible show="Commentary" ]] 
Sometimes I come up with a single line, and then I write an entire SCP article around that line.  I know, a good writer is supposed to "murder his babies," but I can't help myself.

In this case, the line was "SCP-2008-J's diet is unknown; however, a rectal probe of the specimen that was conducted under sedation indicated the presence of a whole, undigested human in the life form's body cavity."

Other tales:
* [[[Spring Cleaning]]]
[[Collapsible show="Commentary" ]] 
This is more of a puzzle-box than an actual work of fiction.  I tried to be clever and do SCP-style write-ups of certain famous historical and legendary artifacts.  At one time I just had a stand-alone "cabinet of curiosities" section to this personnel file, meaning to do something with the write-ups at some point.  Then I constructed a somewhat lazy and half-baked narrative to go along with them.

I shouldn't provide an answer key, but what the hell (most of them have already been figured out):

* [[[Scroll fragment 13Q29]]]
[[Collapsible show="Commentary" ]] 
I hate SCP-682.  Hate, hate, hate.  Sorry, but it's true.
But I had always wanted to do a Bible-speak style writeup of an SCP article or tale, kind of like [[[Page 285 of the Guild Ledger]]] but specifically in Biblical prose.  I opened up the Book of Daniel and the piece basically wrote itself.  I figured that Dead Sea Scrolls-type physical damage to the document could be used in place of traditional redaction.  Unfortunately, the formatting means that the piece looks ugly on certain browsers.

[[/collapsible]]


I added some stuff to a few other articles, including [[[observation-log-709|Observation Log 709]]] (the Dr. Garcia bit), [[[SCP-294]]] (//"Hic est enim Calix Sánguinis mei"//), [[[SCP-738]]] (specifically, the Sheldon Katz bit), [[[log-of-anomalous-items|Log of Anomalous Items]]], [[[experiment-log-261-ad-de|Experiment Log 261-AD-DE]]] (the Dr. Garcia bit) and [[[SCP-887 Log ]]] (the Dr. Garcia bit).

I don't have an "alter ego" character.  Dr. Garcia and Dr. Patel are my Rosencrantz and Guilderstern.  Sheldon Katz, Esq., of the Foundation's legal department, is an extremely self-centered lawyer.
