I created:

* [[[SCP-089]]] (Tophet)
[[Collapsible show="Commentary" ]] 
This is not as old an article as its low number might suggest: the number became available due to the deletion of an older article, and I jumped on it.

While reading about the religion of the ancient Carthaginian culture (why, how do you spend //your// afternoons?) I came across references to child sacrifice.  Specifically, it seems to have been their practice for parents to sacrifice their own children.  The scholarly consensus is still out on how prevalent this was, but there you go.  I'm the father of two wonderful young children, so this practice struck me as the most repugnant and awful thing imaginable.

To make it work as an SCP article, I wanted to play up the psychological horror.  The concept here isn't merely that a child is being painfully murdered- rather, the concept is that the child's parent has to do it.  What's worse, this isn't a case where the parent who is committing the murder is insane, or indoctrinated as some kind of demon-worshiper, or under some kind of outside compulsion.  Rather, the parent has been put in the position of having to //choose// to do this, for the greater good.  I think that at some level, the ancient Carthaginians went through the same process.

But for the Carthaginians, they thought that their sacrifice was necessary in order to obtain the favor of the gods and avert a crisis affecting their own society.  It seemed to me that as an SCP article, the sacrifice would be made even more poignant if the crisis were on the other side of the world, so to speak.  The point of the sacrifice wouldn't be to save the mother's own society, but that of a bunch of strangers.  

Photosynthetic, in the discussion pages for the article, correctly figured out the redacted events that are described in the addendum: the Great New Orleans Fire of 1788 (destroyed virtually the entire city), the Taiping Rebellion (to which tens of millions of deaths in mid-19th century China are attributed), and the 1970 Bhola cyclone in Bangladesh (one of the deadliest natural disasters in modern times).  The 1951 volcanic eruption is nothing specific-- the whole point is that there's nothing in particular that anyone remembers about such an event, because the prompt sacrifice to the Tophet solved the problem.  I'm not going to say anything about the "ongoing" event.

My first draft of the piece involved a somewhat more complicated sacrifice (based on the historic sources) involving turtledoves, cattle, etc. in addition to the human.  But my first draft was poorly received, and for good reason- the lengthy discussion of various animal sacrifices distracted the reader from the intended gut-punch of the child sacrifice.

My next draft only involved sacrificing the child... and was also poorly received.

For my third draft (which is what you're reading here), I simply re-organized the article and buried the lead.  Specifically, I moved the wham line ("For each locution event, SCP-089-A is a healthy, unblemished human infant or child between eight months and six years of age, and SCP-089-B is that child’s natural mother.") further down the article.  

It seems to work.

This was my entry for the "contest for SCP-1000" (http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-376556).  The challenge was to create an SCP object based on folklore or an urban legend.  My first thought was to submit an entry based on the Jersey Devil, but (1) that isn't much more interesting than a generic cryptozoological beast, and (2) somebody at the time had mentioned on the discussion forums that we have relatively few non-Western culture based articles.  So I decided to borrow something from Malay folklore.  Yes, the D&D Fiend Folio has a similar monster drawn from essentially the same source.  Yes, it's a relatively straight SCP-ification of the folklore beastie.  Not really my best work.

Sometimes I come up with a single line, and then I write an entire SCP article around that line.  I know, a good writer is supposed to "murder his babies," but I can't help myself.

In this case, the line was "SCP-2008-J's diet is unknown; however, a rectal probe of the specimen that was conducted under sedation indicated the presence of a whole, undigested human in the life form's body cavity."

This is more of a puzzle-box than an actual work of fiction.  I tried to be clever and do SCP-style write-ups of certain famous historical and legendary artifacts.  At one time I just had a stand-alone "cabinet of curiosities" section to this personnel file, meaning to do something with the write-ups at some point.  Then I constructed a somewhat lazy and half-baked narrative to go along with them.

I shouldn't provide an answer key, but what the hell (most of them have already been figured out):

I hate SCP-682.  Hate, hate, hate.  Sorry, but it's true.
But I had always wanted to do a Bible-speak style writeup of an SCP article or tale, kind of like [[[Page 285 of the Guild Ledger]]] but specifically in Biblical prose.  I opened up the Book of Daniel and the piece basically wrote itself.  I figured that Dead Sea Scrolls-type physical damage to the document could be used in place of traditional redaction.  Unfortunately, the formatting means that the piece looks ugly on certain browsers.

I added some stuff to a few other articles, including [[[observation-log-709|Observation Log 709]]] (the Dr. Garcia bit), [[[SCP-294]]] (//"Hic est enim Calix Sánguinis mei"//), [[[SCP-738]]] (specifically, the Sheldon Katz bit), [[[log-of-anomalous-items|Log of Anomalous Items]]], [[[experiment-log-261-ad-de|Experiment Log 261-AD-DE]]] (the Dr. Garcia bit) and [[[SCP-887 Log ]]] (the Dr. Garcia bit).

I don't have an "alter ego" character.  Dr. Garcia and Dr. Patel are my Rosencrantz and Guilderstern.  Sheldon Katz, Esq., of the Foundation's legal department, is an extremely self-centered lawyer.
