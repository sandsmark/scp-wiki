**Item #:** SCP-3027

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3027-1 is to be kept in a standard Humanoid Containment Cell at Site-19. It is not to have any contact with Junior Researcher Green, nor may Junior Researcher Green be made aware of any information regarding SCP-3027. To prevent this from occurring, she has been reassigned to Provisional Site-███.

SCP-3027-2 is to be stored in the High-Security Archives of Site-19. Access to SCP-3027-2 is permitted for research personnel of clearance level 3 or higher, but no personnel, regardless of clearance level, may attempt to memorize or internalize its contents. Similarly, the information in this document is to be considered Eyes Only and may not be copied or memorized.

Despite SCP-3027-1's misuse of [[[SCP-3022]]], no disciplinary action is to be taken, pursuant to a vote by the Ethics Committee, citing SCP-3027-1's Foundation-aligned intentions in its violation of regulations.

**Description:** SCP-3027 is a spoken and written language,[[footnote]] Which, according to SCP-3027-1, also has a standard signed form [[/footnote]] brought to the Foundation's attention by an alternate version of Junior Researcher Green, hereafter designated SCP-3027-1. SCP-3027-1 intentionally used [[[SCP-3022]]] without authorization to enter our reality from a parallel reality, designated PR-3027-Babel, in order to preserve knowledge of SCP-3027 and study it in a controlled environment. 

Unlike this reality's version of Junior Researcher Green, who is a monolingual English speaker, SCP-3027-1 is fluent in both English and SCP-3027. Much of the Foundation's information concerning SCP-3027 was provided by SCP-3027-1.

SCP-3027-2 is a copy of //Complete Grammar and Dictionary of ███████ for English Speakers//, published by Oxford University Press in 1950 in PR-3027-Babel, brought to this reality by SCP-3027-1. The number of pages within, as well as the content of those pages, has been observed to vary while SCP-3027 is being spoken or written by SCP-3027-1.

SCP-3027 itself is believed to have originated in the northern Italian peninsula in PR-3027-Babel. In all other known realities, it was supplanted by Indo-European languages many centuries ago. Based on information provided by SCP-3027-1 and a short interview with SCP-3027 itself, it seems that SCP-3027 is sentient, and perhaps sapient. In general, it is known not to be hostile to humans; however, it is extremely territorial, viewing its 'territory' as the entire domain of human communication.

SCP-3027 is capable of exerting its will by changing the meaning of words and morphemes in its lexicon at a presumably unlimited speed in the minds of any or all of its speakers. In this way, it manipulates human communication and indirectly plants ideas in the minds of its speakers to serve its own purposes.

> 
> **Dr. Akesson:** But how can a language, even an anomalous one, attack another language? Don't they only exist as media of communication?
> 
> **SCP-3027-1:** It doesn't attack other languages, //per se//. It manipulates its speakers into doing its bidding.
> 
> **Dr. Akesson:** Manipulates? Like controlling you?
> 
> **SCP-3027-1:** Oh, no, not like that. It deceives them-- us, I suppose. Sorry, what number did you give this language? I'd rather not say its name.
> 
> **Dr. Akesson:** 3027.
> 
> **SCP-3027-1:** Right. One person, let's say it's a political leader where SCP-3027 is spoken, gives a rousing speech about something. Right?
> 
> **Dr. Akesson:** Right.
> 
> **SCP-3027-1:** It doesn't even matter what that person says. SCP-3027 changes its meaning for a little bit, and everyone in the crowd hears something like "the Indo-Europeans are invading our homeland, we have to drive them out." And it's a really great, convincing speech. So they go to war.
> 
> **Dr. Akesson:** And win?
> 
> **SCP-3027-1:** And win. And they conquer some territory, force their subjects to speak their language.
> 
> **Dr. Akesson:** I see.
> 
> **SCP-3027-1:** It's close to achieving its goal in my world. It's taken centuries, but it finally got enough momentum to leave [REDACTED], starting in the nineteenth century or so. Now it's gotten a lot of people just mad enough for that last genocidal push before it rules human language.
> 
> **Dr. Akesson:** Sorry, enough momentum to leave where?
> 
> **SCP-3027-1:** Its homeland, somewhere in the south of Europe? It might have a different name in your reality. Do you call it Europe in your reality?
> 
> **Dr. Akesson:** We do.

**Interviewer:** Dr. ██████, head of Foundation linguistics

**Subject:** SCP-3027-1

//Extraneous data redacted.//

> [BEGIN INTERVIEW LOG]
> 
> **SCP-3027-1:** I'm serious when I say it should be reclassified as Keter.
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** I disagree. It doesn't pose much of a containment risk, if you don't speak it.
> 
> **SCP-3027-1:** But it manipulates human thought! It shaped centuries of my world's history, and there's nothing we can do to stop it, if it gets out.
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** Exactly. If it gets out. There's no question that it would be dangerous, but seeing as you're the only speaker here, and you're cooperating...
> 
> **SCP-3027-1:** It's staying Euclid.
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** That's right. Sorry, but I'm not passing your request along. Now, is there anything else I can help you with?
> 
> **SCP-3027-1:** No. [three seconds of silence] You know, back home, I had your job.

> As the only living speaker of SCP-3027 in this reality, I propose that I aid Dr. Akesson in interviewing it, as it may provide some valuable information regarding its origins and intentions. The Foundation in my reality (PR-3027-Babel) interviewed it using procedures which I have slightly modified for our purposes. My procedures are as follows:
> 
> Dr. Akesson asks a question for SCP-3027 and I translate it, then record myself asking the question in the language. I then play back the recording, and translate it back into English. Due to SCP-3027's anomalous lexical shifts, this 'back translation' will serve as an answer to the question. If, at any time, I feel that we are threatened, I will be able to end the interview by simply refraining from speaking SCP-3027.

> //Submitted for review by SCP-3027-1, formerly Dr. Green, head of Foundation linguistics.//
> 
> //Proposal approved by Dr. ██████.//

> **Dr. Akesson:** Does this work? Can you answer my questions?
> 
> **SCP-3027:** Are you stupid? Can you give me some statements?
> 
> **Dr. Akesson:** What do you want to do to humans? I'll give you two statements to answer with. This is the second statement I'll provide.
> 
> **SCP-3027:** Why do you think I care about humans? You took away my rightful home. Now your purpose is as my tool.
> 
> **Dr. Akesson:** My purpose-- your speaker's job-- is to contain you. I know you have killed people just to destroy their languages. I have reason to believe you are hostile. Are you?
> 
> **SCP-3027:** Your purpose-- your species' history-- has destroyed all I love. Your languages have killed all my siblings. I have reason to believe Other-speakers are hostile. Are you?
> 
> **SCP-3027-1:** This is me speaking English now. I think we should stop here. I don't much like the thought of letting it manipulate my perception like this.
> 
> **Dr. Akesson:** Agreed. This has got to be the weirdest interview I've ever conducted.
