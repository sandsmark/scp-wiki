**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation WebCrawler-Q9/4708 is to continuously monitor video streaming platforms for all videos titled "Mike Tyson's Magic Minute". The origin point will be traced and MTF Epsilon-32 ("Lennox's Boys") are to investigate and apprehend SCP-4708, if possible. Foundation contacts within the entertainment industry will propagate the idea that these videos are "deepfakes"[[footnote]] A video editing technology used to combine and superimpose existing images and videos onto source images or videos using a machine learning technique.[[/footnote]] created to humiliate SCP-4708.
