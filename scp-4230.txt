**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Barbed metal fencing is to be constructed in a 6 meter circular formation around SCP-4230-1’s activation point, as SCP-4230 is immobile and cannot be relocated without retaining severe damage. Instances of SCP-4230-A outside of SCP-4230’s radius are to be melted down and/or destroyed within 72 hours. Instances of SCP-4230-A within SCP-4230’s radius are to be destroyed using long-range objects or weapons within this same time span. Foundation medical researchers are currently developing a cure for SCP-4230-1.

In the event that more than 20 instances of SCP-4230-B are present in one area, Site 02 is to enter lockdown mode immediately preceding the dispatch of MTF-Delta-14, "Winter Wonderland”.

**Description:** SCP-4230 is a crudely constructed snowman measuring 1.5 meters in height, and consists of packed snow and traces of various natural debris such as dead leaves, mulch and soil. SCP-4230 does not appear to deteriorate or melt, unlike ordinary snowmen. When human and animal organisms[[footnote]]SCP-4230-1 can occur in plants, however, no anomalous transformations or effects have been witnessed.[[/footnote]] enter within a 4 meter radius of SCP-4230, anomalous activity occurs following SCP-4230-1’s activation[[footnote]]SCP-4230 appears to be the only trigger capable of activating SCP-4230-1.[[/footnote]]. 

SCP-4230-1 is an anomalous event capable of restructuring the skeletal system alongside controlling organ and cell functions to distort the host’s body to appear as a featureless snowman. SCP-4230-1 has been noted to be extremely painful to the subject, and, in all recorded instances, lasts around 7-8 days in humans, and 13-15 days in large animals. SCP-4230-1 may take effect within 11 days following an interaction with SCP-4230-1. Once SCP-4230-1 has completed the process of transforming the host's body, these bodies are to be designated as instances of SCP-4230-A. 

Instances of SCP-4230-A have been shown to host white, spherical eggs. These eggs can hatch into SCP-4230-B instances within the span of 72 hours. Each SCP-4230-A instance may produce up to 19 instances of SCP-4230-B. Destroying instances of SCP-4230-A, along with the eggs they contain, has been classified as an essential process to contain SCP-4230-B.

SCP-4230-B instances are extremely hostile organisms, and resemble 0.6 meter tall snowmen with bloodied mouths and eyes similar in design to those of an insect. All attempts to communicate with SCP-4230-B instances have been met with aggression. Upon being born, instances have been shown to reach adulthood in the span of 15 seconds. The exact lifespan of an SCP-4230-B instance appears to be 24 hours, as all instances seem to melt away approximately one day after being born, regardless of the environments they are present in at the time.

SCP-4230-B instances have been observed to be carnivores, and, in all recorded instances, hunt in packs. Instances of SCP-4230-B strongly dislike warm temperatures, and will actively avoid areas with a temperature of 40°F or above. Attempting to retaliate against an SCP-4230-B attack with snow or ice will result in [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Note:** D-19375 remains conscious and aware from days 1-7. Despite being subject to extreme structural distortion and physical pain, D-19375 never perishes during this process until day 8.

||~ Day # ||~ Visual Changes ||~ Symptoms ||~ Notes ||
|| 1 || None || Common cold || D-19375 complains to Senior Researcher █████████ that he feels "colder than usual".  ||
|| 2 || D-19375 has become similar in appearance to a severely anorexic human. D-19375's skin also has been altered to an unnaturally pale shade of white. || Common cold, dizziness, || None ||
|| 3 || D-19375's femur and fibula begin dissolving due to the presence of a chemical produced within the body, now designated █████████████.|| Common cold, dizziness, lower body pains|| D-19375 reported to foundation personnel that every movement made during this stage causes extreme physical pain to the host.||
|| 4 || All the blood and fat in D-19375's body has pooled to the lower body and solidified.  || Common cold, dizziness, lower body pains, dehydration || None ||
|| 5 || D-19375's upper skeletal system and skull begin restructuring to take on a spherical appearance. D-19375's arms extend out and calcify within 14 minutes. || Common cold, dizziness, lower body pains, dehydration, immobility || None ||
|| 6 || [DATA EXPUNGED] || [DATA EXPUNGED] || [DATA EXPUNGED] ||
|| 7 || D-19375 begins to secrete large amounts of an unknown liquid. Due to D-19375's extremely low body temperature, the liquid freezes upon contact with D-19375's skin. The result is similar in appearance to snow. || Common cold, dizziness, lower body pains, dehydration, immobility, blindness || None ||
|| 8 || D-19375's corpse is now visually identical to a featureless snowman. || N/A || Though the exterior layer of D-19375's corpse resembles a snowman, an autopsy revealed that the interior of D-19375's corpse still consists of human flesh and skeletal structure. ||

**Aftermath:** D-19375's corpse produces 7 instances of SCP-4230-B. The instances are terminated on sight.

**Note:** Per the results of experiment 4230-B-D, testing on instances of SCP-4230-B is forbidden. Any personnel attempting to test on instances of SCP-4230-B are to be reported to Senior Researcher ████████ immediately.

||~ Experiment Identifier ||~ Experiment ||~ Result ||~ Notes||
|| A || An instance of SCP-4230-B was provided with one head of //Lactuca sativa//, more commonly referred to as lettuce, along with one //Citrullus lanatus// fruit, more commonly referred to as a watermelon. || The instance expressed disinterest to the food it was provided with, and did not attempt to consume it. The instance also refused to consume the food when presented with it. || //Looks like they're explicitly carnivores. Explains the blood on the mouth and eyes all too well, though.// -Senior Researcher ████████||
|| B|| D-13909 was armed with a lighter, one emergency flare, and one gallon of gasoline. D-13909 was then sent into a holding cell containing ten instances of SCP-4230-B. || All ten SCP-4230-B instances initially advanced towards D-13909. Upon noticing D-13908’s lighter, seven of the ten instances attempted to retreat. The remaining three instances were killed by D-13909 in an act of self defense.  || //Seems like the little demons are scared of fire. I think we should contact Delta-14 about this ASAP.// -Senior Researcher ████████ ||
|| C || An unarmed D-39023 was released into a holding cell containing three instances of SCP-4230-B.|| Almost immediately following the acknowledgement of D-39023's presence, the instances ran towards D-39023, injured them, and began scraping and tearing at their body until they died of blood loss. The instances then proceeded to consume D-39023's corpse. || None ||
|| D ||A 0.07 m x 0.07 m x 0.07 m snowball was thrown at one instance of SCP-4230-B. || [DATA EXPUNGED] || [DATA EXPUNGED] ||

**Discovery Report:** On 1/12/19, Robert and Mikaylah P. Anderson, residents of Grain Valley, Missouri, contacted the Grain Valley Police Department, claiming that their son had been attacked by an instance of SCP-4230-B while playing outside in their house's front yard. When police officers arrived at the scene, foundation personnel were contacted after an officer was wounded by an instance. Mobile Task Forces arrived at the scene and safely contained the anomaly fifteen minutes after receiving the call. Amnestics were administered to the officers present at the scene as well as the Anderson family. Following the administration of amnestics, a cover story was fabricated about Michael Anderson, 9-year old son of the Anderson family, accidentally getting himself stuck in a pothole, and officers having to rescue him.

**Incident Report:** On 1/24/19, Agent ██████ failed to terminate an instance of SCP-4230-A within the 72 hour time span, as proposed by Senior Researcher ████████. The following assault carried out by 9 SCP-4230-B instances resulted in the death of 27 Foundation personnel. Agent ██████ was promptly reprimanded for the incident.
