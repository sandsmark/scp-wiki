**Item #:** SCP-258

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-258 is to be kept in a standard storage vault with a keycard lock to be accessed only on approval from the supervisor of site ██.  While is not directly harmful in any way, all who have utilized it have expressed a desire to do so again, ranging from the wistful to the vehement.  Applicants for use are to be screened for underlying mental instability.

**Description:**  SCP-258 was recovered from ██████████, Maine after parents of local schoolchildren reported that stories of a 'haunted bouncy frog' their children had been spreading were true.  Agent T███ confirmed the nature of the object and Foundation personnel replaced it with a replica without incident.

SCP-258 appears to be a simple bouncing playground rider, seemingly designed to fit children of elementary school age and shaped like a stylized green frog with rotating handles on either side of its head.  SCP-258 has milky-white eyes with what appear to be streams of white paint running down its face, as though it were weeping.  Numerous attempts have been made to remove paint from SCP-258; the green paint comes off with normal paint removal techniques, but the white substance cannot; it only fades with time, observed to depend on various factors including length of time utilized and the extent of the emotional burden 'relieved'.

When a subject sits on SCP-258, grasps its handles, and begins rocking back and forth, they report that a feeling of peace and contentment washes over them; the 'eyes' of the object then begin to leak what appears to be white paint.  Though this substance cannot be removed from SCP-258 once the seat is vacated, it remains in liquid form during use, and will drip from the object onto the ground.  Testing of this material afterward has determined it to be unremarkable paint in every way.  How SCP-258 generates this substance is unknown.  The direct effect of SCP-258 only lasts for as long as the subject remains seated, though several subjects suffering symptoms of chronic depression have reported a lasting positive effect, resulting from some 'insight' they gained while riding SCP-258.

Repeated use of SCP-258 by a subject has shown to be mildly addictive, and Agent W████████ had to be restrained and struck before regaining self-control.  The results of allowing mentally unstable subjects access to SCP-258 is unknown, pending further testing.  It is unknown whether SCP-258 has any measure of sentience, as no means of communication has been devised.

**Addendum:** //[[[SCP-132]]] has requested permission to ride SCP-258 for a few minutes.  My inclination is to let the poor girl, but we don't know what will happen if the two interact.  We could all drown in paint.  It's your call, boss.
