||||||||~ Initial Report||
||~ Author || Gerald Chapman ||~ Date || May 27, 2018||
||~ Interest||Medium||~ Identifier||Art by //Oswaldo// ||
|||||||| I was visiting the estate of a personal associate when, in their lounge, I found myself enthralled with a particular painting upon their wall. As such frivolous diversion typically fails to attract my attentions, I felt compelled to ask my host more about it. This was my first exposure to the art of //Oswaldo//. _
 _
//Oswaldo// was not one man, he told me, but rather the self-styled name for a collective of artists. It so happened that the creator of this particular piece currently worked out of a studio in the city nearby. Whether it was some latent instinct for business within me, or a lingering remnant of that painting's magic, I sought out the artist in their workspace soon after. _
 _
Emma Martin defied my initial expectations. She was mature, she knew very much about the techniques of such work; but what's more, she had a keen insight to "the anart scene" at large. Though it took some persuasive charm on my part, we came to an arrangement which should be beneficial for all parties involved. The artists of //Oswaldo// receiving financial support and a platform for exposure, and our own clients having the opportunity to purchase these attractive items. ||

||~ Listing |||||| **You** - Anomalous Sculpture by Emma Martin _
 _
From the visionary Melbourne-based //Oswaldo// collective, confederates of renowned anartist movement Are We Cool Yet?, comes this stunning piece. _
 _
A full-scale sculpture of a man (height: 2.3m, base: 1.0m x 0.6m) made entirely of glass, with capricious and ornate marbling patterns throughout. The item is mounted upon a handsome block of polished granite. _
 _
More than just a visual marvel, this piece offers an accurate reflection of the viewer's own inner disposition. See how colour and form alter themselves in accordance to emotion and desire! Perfect for gleaning insight when on public display, or for moments of private introspection. _

||~ Sender || Gerald Chapman ||~ Recipient || Emma Martin ||
|||||||| I do hope that the success of the other night's event has dispelled any lingering reservations you may have had about our new arrangements. The remunerative commissions have by this time already been deposited in the accounts of yourself and your fellow artists. _
 _
While the intimate atmosphere provided by the venue did add a certain degree of ambiance, I would like to see an increase in creative output moving forward. There is potential for larger auctions to be supported, if the demand can be met. ||

 _
From //Oswaldo//, currently the fastest rising stars of the Are We Cool Yet? anart movement, we bring you this piece. _
 _
On first glance, we see an obelisk of flawless polished dark marble (height: 3 m, base: 1.2 m x 0.9 m). But come closer, and bear witness to the reshaping of reality itself. One will be entranced by surreal and amorphous changes in shapes and angles. Solid stone moving fluidly in air! _
 _
And now, this deeply thoughtful statement on the nature of firmness of adaptability can be yours. ||

||~ Method of Acquisition |||||| Request for materials forwarded to Mr. Chapman by members of //Oswaldo//. ||
||||||||~ Document ||
|||||||| Mr. Chapman; _
 _
Here is the full list of anomalous materials needed for the upcoming auction: _
 _
Please note that once again James has elected to construct his memetic drives with 'found materials' and will not be needing materials provided, just straight cash. He requests $8500. _
 _
Ivan requires a further 500mL of the anomalous dye as used in the sculpture 'You' and a Class II Scranton Reality Anchor. _
 _
I (Emma Martin) will require a Class III Scranton Reality Anchor, the left forelimb of a six-year-old, pure white rabbit which lives in Denmark and a live Australian Fruit Bat. _
 _
In addition to this, James has mentioned the existence of anomalous, programmable, reality-bending sheets of glass capable of displaying abstract images and scenes. An amount of glass which could be molded into a replacement set of windows and windscreens for a 2004 Bentley Continental would be greatly appreciated for use in an interactive installation. _
 _
 Thanks in advance. _

Best regards, //Oswaldo//: AWCY? Melbourne Branch. ||

||||||||~ LB7RE/C9Y9A/ND5E3 ||
||~ Sender || Gerald Chapman ||~ Recipient || Emma Martin ||
|||||||| Is your colleague really serious about this latest request? Do you realize that the material costs of the glass alone practically negate any potential profit for such a limited novelty? _
 _
We are trying to entice clientele of particular tastes with these items. They must be attractive to the prospective buyer, and something that they will want to take home with them. I will encourage you to keep these details in mind as we move forward. ||

||||||||~ Memo 20 ||
||||||||~ LB7RE/C9Y9A/ND5E3 ||
||~ Sender || Emma Martin ||~ Recipient || Gerald Chapman ||
|||||||| Gerald, I'd like to remind you of our conversation last winter. You promised opportunities; for exposure, for money, for a chance to expand the scope of our artistic projects. But the direction of things lately is troubling to me. _
 _
This was supposed to open doors for //Oswaldo//, let us broaden our creative horizons and make even our boldest visions manifest. Instead we are being boxed in; finding not an open field of possibilities to roam in, but a narrow corridor of permitted expression! _
 _
Even with young new talent joining the core group of //Oswaldo//, it's becoming a strain to fill the number of spaces asked for at each auction. If we must produce some number of pieces for the sake of your sales, I should expect you to indulge us in at least a few passion projects of our own. ||

||||||||~ Memo 21 ||
||||||||~ LB7RE/C9Y9A/ND5E3 ||
||~ Sender || Gerald Chapman ||~ Recipient || Emma Martin ||
|||||||| Please, let me assure you that to stifle your creativity is the opposite of my intent. I do appreciate how you've accomplished the increased production; I applaud the depth of your creative abilities. _
 _
Having considered the matter further, I will arrange for this particular 'passion project' of yours to be supplied as requested. You certainly do deserve a fair degree of creative input in our partnership. To that end, I am also exploring options to accommodate your request to stage [http://www.scp-wiki.net/creative-differences our next event in Australia.] _
 _
Some of my associates felt that it was a bit of a step down, after the European scene. But by coordinating with the broker handling a seperate venture of ours, we should be able to reach a satisfactory agreement. You're welcome. ||
