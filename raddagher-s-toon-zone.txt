+ Hi!

++ It's me again.
[[/=]]
+++ Here are some facts:
* I have a degree in Film Animation
* I'd love to be a professional character designer but really don't have the chops for it realistically
* I worked in a haunted hotel for 3 months
* my spine can bend backward at a perfect 90 degree angle
* the first I ever heard of SCP was in 2012 when my friends and I read 087 in an abandoned paintball barricade in the woods behind my house
* I just want everyone on this site to laugh and be happy and have a fun time

> Hey? I like to draw. Want me to draw somebody for you? Your tale? Your avatar? Your illegitimate child? I do commissions and sometimes I do things for free. Hit me up. We'll talk about it.
