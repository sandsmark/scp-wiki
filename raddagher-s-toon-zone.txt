+ Hi!

++ It's me again.
[[/=]]
+++ Here are some facts:
* I have a degree in Film Animation
* I'd love to be a professional character designer but really don't have the chops for it realistically
* I worked in a haunted hotel for 3 months
* my spine can bend backward at a perfect 90 degree angle
* I'm writing an SCP podcast that will probably be live in July 2019
* the first I ever heard of SCP was in 2012 when my friends and I read 087 in an abandoned paintball barricade in the woods behind my house
* I just want everyone on this site to laugh and be happy and have a fun time

[[collapsible show="Click here for commission info!" hide="hide"]]
Hi! I like to draw people and sometimes things. Do you have a person or a thing you would like me to draw? Ask me if I'm currently taking commissions! Usually I am. Just tell me what you're interested in getting and I'll give you a quote. My starting rate is 25$/hour, so full-color full-body art is usually $50, just as a frame of reference.

+++ Disclaimer!
I am best at drawing humans/humanoid things. While I can draw animals, mechanics, landscapes, locations, etc, I am not very good at it and rates will probably be a bit higher for things like that. My honest recommendation is that if you're looking for something in that realm, commission a different artist who can make something that is worth the money because for real mine probably won't be.
