**Special Containment Procedures:** A misinformation campaign is being undertaken by [http://www.scp-wiki.net/task-forces#gamma-5 MTF Gamma-5 ("Red Herrings")] to disprove all attempts to discover and/or disclose the true nature of SCP-4509 and SCP-4509-01 through -13. Any individuals and/or organizations found to be attempting to subvert the misinformation campaign are to be apprehended and handled according to Veil Breakers Protocol 3-6[[footnote]]For information regarding Veil Breakers Protocols, refer to section 23 of the Level 3 Employee Handbook.[[/footnote]].

**Description:** SCP-4509 refers to an anomalous entity reported to have either been or resembled a creature from Algonquian folklore known as the "Windigo[[footnote]]A bipedal creature described as having an exposed skull, cervine antlers, and being in an early state of decay.[[/footnote]]". The entity is believed to have been the cause of a series of 13 recently solved disappearances and murders known publicly as the "Windigo Cold Cases" and hereafter referred to as SCP-4509-01 through -13. The cases occurred between 1971 and 2008 in the vicinity of the Windigo Ranger Station on Isle Royale[[footnote]]A large island on Lake Superior, north of the US state of Michigan.[[/footnote]]. SCP-4509 was first brought to Foundation attention after several posts involving the Windigo Cold Cases from a user known as "cutecanine511" on the conspiracy forum "[http://www.scp-wiki.net/parawatch-hub Parawatch]" were discovered by an MTF Gamma-5 web crawler, resulting in a re-examination and subsequent investigation by Foundation field agents.

The following is a list of known data regarding SCP-4509-01 through -13 compiled during the re-examination of the Windigo Cold Cases. Absent entries should be treated as having no known information.

The initial investigation into SCP-4509 was carried out by Agents Devorah Adani and Gregor McWilliam, who posed as investigative journalists for the fictional blog "Anomalous Songs in the Dark" with the goal of gaining information from the residents of Windigo Station. After arriving on the island, they were directed to National Park Service Ranger Betty Scott by a tour guide. Ranger Scott proceeded to discuss the nature of the Windigo Cold Cases with the Agents. The following is a transcript of the conversation Agents Adani and McWilliam had with Ranger Scott.

**Interviewer(s):** Agent Devorah Adani, Agent Gregor McWilliam

**Agent Adani:** Thanks for meeting with us, Ranger Scott.

**Ranger Scott:** You can just call me Betty! And it was my pleasure, it's not like there's much else to do out here.

**Agent Adani:** Alright. We just wanted to ask you some questions about the Windigo Cold Cases.

**Ranger Scott:** Well of course! That's all you young folks come here to talk about nowadays.

**Agent Adani:** I'm twenty-three.

**Agent McWilliam:** Devorah.

**Agent Adani:** Anyways, you must know about the legend surrounding the Cases, right?

**Ranger Scott:** The one about the Asian carp?

**Agent Adani:** Asian carp? No, that a Windigo was the cause of them.

**Ranger Scott:** A Windigo!

**Agent McWilliam:** Yes Rang- Betty. A Windigo.

**Ranger Scott:** You think a Windigo was the cause of the Windigo Cold Cases? Hah! Shows what you know. No, it was actually a goddamn gnome.

**Agent Adani:** A gnome? How can you be sure?

**Ranger Scott:** Because I went out, hunted it down, and killed it myself.

**Agent McWilliam:** Do you have proof of this?

**Ranger Scott:** Nope. I burned its body. You never know with these monsters whether they're really dead or just fooling.

**Addendum 4509-1:** Following the interview, Agents Adani and McWilliam chose to investigate the areas in which SCP-4509-01 through -13 occurred. The first seven locations lacked any evidence of anomalous occurrences. At the location in which SCP-4509-08 occurred, the Agents found gashes on a nearby pine tree resembling claw marks. The gashes did not match any existing animal or known entity found on Isle Royale.

No further evidence was discovered until the Agents investigated the location in which SCP-4509-13 occurred, where they found the burned cadaver of an anomalous entity within the adjacent area. The following is a transcript of Agents Adani and McWilliam first examining the cadaver.

**Recording Device Transcript**

**Date:** February 4th, 2011

**Subject:** Anomalous Entity Cadaver

**Involved Personnel:** Agent Devorah Adani, Agent Gregor McWilliam

**Agent Adani:** Is it recording?

**Agent McWilliam:** Yeah.

**Agent Adani:** Alright. This is Agents Adani and McWilliam doing an initial examination of an anomalous cadaver we discovered during our investigation on Isle Royale. The cadaver is roughly a meter in height, maybe less. It appears to have been burned and then buried at some point. Looks like the soil above the cadaver was recently eroded by rain runoff. The head, upper torso, and right arm are currently visible. Here, Gregor, get a good look at the skull with the camera.

**Agent McWilliam:** Alright. Is that a bullet hole?

**Agent Adani:** I'd say so. It doesn't look like it went out the other side. Could I have your flashlight? Thanks. Yeah, I think I can see something metallic in there. We'll have to let the docs take a look at this. Hey, take a look at the fingers, they end in claws.

**Agent McWilliam:** Could this thing have made the gashes we saw?

**Agent Adani:** Possibly.

**Ranger Scott:** It's a certainty.

**Agent Adani:** What the-

**Ranger Scott:** I see you young folks didn't believe me. I'll have you know that I may be old, but I'm no liar. There haven't been Windigos on Isle Royale since '68 when the government came and chased them all north. After that this here gnome started attacking the campers.

**Agent McWilliam:** Well then.

**Agent Adani:** God damnit.

**Ranger Scott:** I suggest you two get on the first boat out of here. You wasted the only hospitality the island was willing to give you.
