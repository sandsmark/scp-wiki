@@                    @@"Someone once told me that they had a pet peeve about hubs that didn't explain what they were about. I didn't like putting anything up at the top, so I decided to end this hub with a small little letter. So, what is... Vend-a-Friend?
@@                    @@"Vend-a-Friend is a story about a character, named Brainy Brian, who might really not be the good guy. He's no hero, he does a lot of bad things... but he does some good things too. He's just... a guy. Really. And he starts as an employee at Dr. Wondertainment, but quickly gets thrust into the 'real world', and soon after, the anomalous world. When I started writing this, I didn't expect it to get to be the length of a real novel. I mean, Christ, this is over 60,000 words long! It was supposed to end after five chapters, but it just... kept going. It's officially over, now that it's fifteen chapters long, but man did it go on and on.
@@                    @@"When I started writing this, the goal was to make a dark Dr. Wondertainment series. Well, that had been done before. So then it became to redesign all of Dr. Wondertainment, because I wasn't happy with any headcanons of Dr. Wondertainment on the site. I did that, and then it just became... well, an exercise in actually writing a big long story! This is, at the time of writing, the longest thing I have ever written. I mean, it's a proper... story. And that's insane. It's probably my proudest work as well, because people have enjoyed it. I got to flex my characterization muscles, see how I handled an overarching plot, //tons// of worldbuilding for a world that I just //adored// writing in (and will likely return to), and most of all I just had... so much gosh darn fun with this one.
@@                    @@"And did I handle all of this well?
@@                    @@"Holy heck, who even knows. You tell me. My guess is that it's pretty clearly amateurish. I mean, jeez, this is my first story longer than three parts //ever//. So. There. That's what this hub is about.
@@                    @@"Enjoy."
