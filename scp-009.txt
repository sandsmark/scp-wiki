**Item #:** SCP-009

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Subject is to be contained within a sealed storage tank of heat-resistant alloy with dimensions not less than 18m x 14m x 14m. Any viewing windows added to the tank must be made of the highest grade plastics available, and must not exceed 2 meters in diameter. 

Under no circumstances should SCP-009 be exposed to temperatures in excess of 0°C when not undergoing testing, and no mundane liquids in a solid state (especially frozen water) shall be allowed within 30 meters of the subject's containment area. Subject's chamber is to be fitted with temperature sensors which shall be monitored at all times, and is to be kept refrigerated by no less than three (3) redundant cooling units. Any malfunction of sensors, or of coolant systems, is to be reported and repaired immediately. 

If at any time the temperature in the containment area climbs above -5°C, the chamber is to be locked down immediately, and flooded with coolant until temperature has been brought back down to between -30°C and -25°C.

All personnel interacting with or observing the subject must wear full environmental protection gear which is completely water-tight. All personnel leaving the containment chamber must undergo dehydration of all gear, research materials, and other objects contacting SCP-009's chamber. If contamination is discovered, no material or personnel shall be permitted to exit, and a Level 2 lock-down of the containment area shall commence. Lethal force is authorized in cases of dire need, but all security forces are strongly suggested to remain as far away from their targets as possible, to minimize the chance of contact with fluids contaminated by SCP-009.

**Description:** SCP-009 is a volume (currently approximately 3,700 liters) of a substance which exhibits a number of unique properties. While small amounts of the substance, in all phases, is as colorless as mundane water, en masse it takes on a distinct deep red hue. It's most notable property, however, is the fact that SCP-009's reaction to temperature extremes is exactly opposite that of standard H2O. 

The subject assumes a liquid phase at temperatures between -100°C and 0°C, and converts into a solid state above those temperatures. At temperatures below -100°C, SCP-009 vaporizes into a gaseous phase similar to steam, though it still retains its red coloration when put under high pressure. While the assimilation of ambient moisture takes place readily in gaseous and solid states, it has shown a decreased ability to contaminate natural water supplies while in liquid phase, hence the preferred method of containment.  

Examinations of the atomic structure of SCP-009 have proved inconclusive. Tests indicate that the subject is composed of the same combination of Hydrogen and Oxygen as normal water, leaving researchers to speculate that the source of the subject's abnormalities may be the atoms themselves. Dr. ██████ has suggested that the subject may have originated in or been altered by another reality in which the laws of physics are inverted. 

This theory may have some merit in light of SCP-009's marked ability to "assimilate" natural water into its mass, thereby contaminating any source of H20 with its properties. Unlike mundane liquids, its ability to mix with other water sources is most prevalent in its solid form, and subject will transfer its properties (fortunately signaled visually by the spread of its red color) to any frozen aqueous substance with shocking speed if given the opportunity. 

If the subject comes in contact with any source of heat (most notably a warm-blooded animal), it begins an explosive runaway reaction in which the victim's bodily fluids are rapidly converted to SCP-009. Experiments on D-Class personnel have shown [DATA EXPUNGED]

Subject was found in ████, Alaska, in a cave just outside a village which, according to the local ███████ tribe, had been known as cursed ground for centuries. Reports were obtained from the natives of [REDACTED] with the eyeballs [DATA EXPUNGED] and massive hemorrhaging of [DATA EXPUNGED]. The foundation was called in when a number of teenagers were reported missing to the authorities, and search parties dispatched to the area failed to report back in. Agents ████ and ███████ were killed in the extraction operation due to lack of reliable intel on what they were dealing with; autopsies found massive [DATA EXPUNGED] and total destruction of the mucosa by [REDACTED] up the throat and chest cavity, exposing [DATA EXPUNGED] with a consistency described as "frozen strawberry jam".

Subject was located in a depression (50cm at maximum depth) within one of the innermost caverns within the cave complex. A pool of SCP-009 was found in liquid form within the depression, but much of the surrounding ice and snow had been contaminated, and several large and vaguely humanoid ice formations were found near what was calculated to be the epicenter of the spread. 

Blood samples were reclaimed (with some difficulty) from the formations, and tests confirmed they were the remains of the missing persons from the area. It is speculated that the body heat of the victims stimulated [DATA EXPUNGED] natural cooling [REDACTED] before total liquefaction.
