**Item #:** SCP-009

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Subject is to be contained within a sealed storage tank of heat-resistant alloy with dimensions not less than 18m x 14m x 14m.

Under no circumstances should SCP-009 be exposed to temperatures in excess of 0°C when not undergoing testing, and no mundane liquids in a solid state (especially frozen water) shall be allowed within 30 meters of the subject's containment area. Subject's chamber is to be fitted with temperature sensors which shall be monitored at all times, and is to be kept refrigerated by no less than three (3) redundant cooling units. Any malfunction of sensors, or of coolant systems, is to be reported and repaired immediately. 

If at any time the temperature in the containment area climbs above -5°C, the chamber is to be locked down immediately, and flooded with coolant until temperature has been brought back down to between -30°C and -25°C. Atmosphere must be evacuated from the containment area when personnel are present within, and any water vapor present must be filtered and kept in the same conditions as detailed herein for no less than 24 hours. Any vapor displaying properties of SCP-009 are to be quarantined and added to the containment area as soon as possible.

All personnel interacting with or observing the subject must wear full environmental protection gear which is completely water-tight. All personnel leaving the containment chamber must undergo dehydration of all gear, research materials, and other objects contacting SCP-009's chamber. If contamination is discovered, no material or personnel shall be permitted to exit, and a Level 2 lock-down of the containment area shall commence. Lethal force is authorized in cases of dire need, but all security forces are strongly suggested to remain as far away from their targets as possible, to minimize the chance of contact with fluids contaminated by SCP-009.

**Description:** SCP-009 is a volume (currently approximately 3,700 liters) of a substance which exhibits a number of unique properties. While small amounts of the substance, in all phases, is as colorless as mundane water, en masse it takes on a distinct deep red hue. 

It's most notable property, however, is the fact that SCP-009's reaction to temperature extremes is exactly opposite that of standard H,,2,,O; the subject assumes a liquid phase at temperatures between -100°C and 0°C, and converts into a solid state above those temperatures. At temperatures below -100°C, SCP-009 vaporizes into a gaseous phase similar to steam, though it still retains its red coloration when put under high pressure. While the assimilation of ambient moisture takes place readily in gaseous and solid states, it has shown a decreased ability to contaminate natural water supplies while in liquid phase, hence the preferred method of containment.  

Examinations of the atomic structure of SCP-009 have proved inconclusive. Tests indicate that the subject is composed of the same combination of hydrogen and oxygen as normal water, leaving researchers to speculate that the source of the subject's abnormalities may be the atoms themselves. Dr. ██████ has suggested that the subject may have originated in or been altered by another reality in which the laws of physics are inverted. 

This theory may have some merit in light of SCP-009's marked ability to "assimilate" natural water into its mass, thereby contaminating any source of H,,2,,O with its properties. Unlike mundane liquids, its ability to mix with other water sources is most prevalent in its solid form, and subject will transfer its properties (fortunately signaled visually by the spread of its red color) to any frozen aqueous substance with shocking speed if given the opportunity. 

If the subject comes in contact with any source of heat (most notably a warm-blooded animal), it begins a runaway reaction in which the victim's bodily fluids are rapidly converted to SCP-009 and promptly frozen by their own body heat. SCP-009 has also been shown to produce heat while freezing, at the same rate mundane ice consumes heat while melting, resulting in a self-perpetuating process which, if not halted by external means, would result in the subject spreading uncontrollably until all available moisture has been converted to SCP-009.

Experiments on D-Class personnel have illustrated the process of conversion by the subject, which has been condensed down to a series of steps;

1. Initial Exposure: Subject is exposed to SCP-009, and it begins converting any water present on the exposed surface (usually skin) to exhibit it's properties. Presence of mist, fog, snow, or other solid or vaporous water greatly accelerates this process.

2. Surface freezing; a thin layer of frost forms on the exposed area as body heat and heat produced by SCP-009 raise its temperature above freezing. Progression to this step can take anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour, depending on victim's body temperature.

3. Deep Tissue freezing; Exponential increase in temperature of SCP-009 causes expansion of ice crystals throughout the victim's body, resulting in [DATA EXPUNGED]. Water in the lungs [DATA EXPUNGED] especially the vitreous humour [DATA EXPUNGED] and penetrates the intestinal wall.

4. [DATA EXPUNGED]

5. Death by internal hemorrhaging and massive cell membrane perforation due to freezing cytoplasm. 

Testing on D-Class personnel was discontinued as of 4/23/20██.

**Addendum: Circumstances of Retrieval:** Subject was found in ████, Alaska, on 11/05/19██. The Foundation got involved after reports were obtained from the native ████ Tribe, who came across the mangled bodies of several missing persons from the area. All victims were found encased in [DATA EXPUNGED] protruding from the eye sockets and mouth [DATA EXPUNGED] death via extensive internal bleeding. Of the victims whose features were left moderately intact, expressions of severe agony and fear were observed. It is surmised that the low ambient temperatures in the area caused the assimilation to mostly proceed inward toward the highest sources of body heat, resulting in [DATA EXPUNGED] at a greatly reduced speed.

**Addendum:** 12/16/120██

Super-cooling of SCP-009 for the purposes of experimentation have been discontinued until further notice. Personnel are advised that liquid nitrogen is only to be used on the subject in controlled amounts, and only until temperatures have reached acceptable levels. 

Related note: Possible application of SCP-009 in cold fusion research pending evaluation.
