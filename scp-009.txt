**Item #:** SCP-009

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Subject is to be contained within a sealed storage tank of heat-resistant alloy with dimensions not less than 18m x 14m x 14m. Any viewing windows added to the tank must be made of the highest grade plastics available, and must not exceed 2 meters in diameter. 

--Extreme care must be taken to ensure all seals are water-tight. Containment area should be evacuated of all atmosphere when not in use, with a single entrance linked to at least two airlocks the only means of ingress and egress. All air removed from SCP-009's chamber must be filtered to remove all water vapor, which must be stored under similar conditions as the subject itself for at least 24 hours. Water (in any phase) observed duplicating the properties of SCP-009 are to be immediately added to its containment tank.-- //Contamination has been found to exclude gaseous and liquid phases. Standard procedures for filtration of ventilated gas should be observed unless otherwise noted.//

Under no circumstances should SCP-009 be exposed to temperatures in excess of 0°C when not undergoing testing, and no mundane liquids in a solid state (especially frozen water) shall be allowed within 30 meters of the subject's containment area. Subject's chamber is to be fitted with temperature sensors which shall be monitored at all times, and is to be kept refrigerated by no less than three (3) redundant cooling units. Any malfunction of sensors, or of coolant systems, is to be reported and repaired immediately. If at any time the temperature in the containment area climbs above -5°C, the chamber is to be locked down immediately, and flooded with liquid coolant. 

All personnel interacting with or observing the subject must wear full environmental protection gear which is completely water-tight. All personnel leaving the containment chamber must undergo surface dehydration (without applying heat) of all gear, research materials, and other objects contacting SCP-009's chamber. If contamination is discovered, no material or personnel shall be permitted to exit, and a Level 2 lock-down of the containment area shall commence. Lethal force is authorized in cases of dire need, but all security forces are strongly suggested to remain as far away from contaminated subjects as possible, to minimize the chance of [DATA EXPUNGED] bodily fluids. 

**Description:** SCP-009 is a volume (currently approximately 3,700 liters) of a substance which exhibits a number of unique properties. While small amounts of the substance, in all phases, is as colorless as mundane water, en masse it takes on a distinct deep red hue. It's most notable property, however, is the fact that SCP-009's reaction to temperature extremes is exactly opposite that of standard H2O. 

The subject is in a liquid state at temperatures between -100°C and 0°C, and converts into a solid state above those temperatures. See attached documents for further information on SCP-009's reactions to extreme temperature variances.

Examinations of the atomic structure of SCP-009 have proved inconclusive. Tests indicate that the subject is composed of the same combination of Hydrogen and Oxygen as normal water, leaving researchers to speculate that the source of the subject's abnormalities may be the atoms themselves. Dr. ██████ has suggested that [REDACTED] inverted the resonance pattern [DATA EXPUNGED] quantum filaments were [DATA EXPUNGED] tests resulted in [REDACTED] manifested 11th Dimensional properties [REDACTED] and a bioluminescent parrot.

SCP-009 has displayed a marked ability to "assimilate" natural water into its mass, thereby contaminating any source of H20 with its properties. Unlike mudane liquids, its ability to mix with other water sources is most prevalent in its solid form, and subject will transfer its properties (fortunately signaled visually by the spread of its red color) to any frozen aqueous substance with shocking speed if given the opportunity. As such, the subject is to be stored in its liquid form to aid in containment. 

Subject was found in ████, Alaska, in a cave just outside a village which, according to the local ███████ tribe, had been known as cursed ground for centuries. Reports were obtained from the natives of [REDACTED] with the eyeballs [DATA EXPUNGED] and massive hemorrhaging of [DATA EXPUNGED]. The foundation was called in when a number of teenagers were reported missing to the authorities, and search parties dispatched to the area failed to report back in. Agents ████ and ███████ were killed in the extraction operation due to lack of reliable intel on what they were dealing with; autopsies found massive [DATA EXPUNGED] and total destruction of the mucosa by [REDACTED] up the throat and chest cavity, exposing [DATA EXPUNGED] with a consistency described as "frozen strawberry jam".

Subject was located in a depression (50cm at maximum depth) within one of the innermost caverns within the cave complex. A pool of SCP-009 was found in liquid form within the depression, but much of the surrounding ice and snow had been contaminated, and several large and vaguely humanoid ice formations were found near what was calculated to be the epicenter of the spread. 

Blood samples were reclaimed (with some difficulty) from the formations, and tests confirmed they were the remains of the missing persons from the area. It is speculated that the body heat of the victims stimulated [DATA EXPUNGED] natural cooling [REDACTED] before total liquefaction. 

**Addendum:** SCP-009-AX3

Subject has been moved to Site █ for study, testing on temperature variances has begun. Results to follow.

**Experiment 1:** 9/23/19██

Materials: One (1) liter of SCP-009, one (1) glass holding tank, one (1) heating implement

SCP-009 was added to tank in liquid state. Temperature slowly raised from -10°C to 10°C. Freezing began immediately above 0°C, and progressed at the normal rate expected for H2O. No complications. Testing concluded, SCP-009 sample returned to containment.

//Notes: Yeah, that's pretty much what we expected. But, you never know with these SCPs. ~Dr. ██████//

**Experiment 2-A:** 9/23/19██

Materials: One (1) liter of SCP-009, one (1) glass holding tank, one (1) previously euthanized frog (//Rana catesbeiana//)

SCP-009 was added to tank in liquid state. Frog was added to tank. Some minute freezing was observed in close proximity to the frog, but did not progress. Dr. ██████ observed the frog had been stored in a refrigeration chamber for the test, and suggested using a frog kept at room temperature. 

Testing discontinued.

**Experiment 2-B:** 9/23/19██

Materials: Same as above, but with frog's core temperature at approx. 20°C 

Same results as above, except the freezing was observed to extend roughly 3mm father from the frog's body, and parts of the frog's torso experienced some minute frost formation. 

**Experiment 3:** 9/25/19██

Materials: Same as above, but with a live frog.

Freezing began immediately upon introduction of the living frog. Subject leaped up to escape the chamber, and landed on researcher Dr. ████, whom was instantly contaminated by SCP-009. Surveillance shows frost formation progressing rapidly along the forearm and hand, and Dr. ████ displayed severe pain and began to panic. Subject spread until [DATA EXPUNGED], Dr. ████ terminated upon her own request. clean-up crews were dispatched, and contained SCP-009 with liquid nitrogen. Frog killed by internal hemorrhaging. 

Upon study, the body of Dr. ████ displayed a far higher volume of frozen SCP-009 than should've been formed by her estimated body heat. Further testing is suggested. 

//Notes: Okay, seriously, who the hell thought it was a good idea to put a live frog in a tank with no lid? Frogs jump, numb-nuts! What, did you think it would be a good boy and let itself be frozen? ~Dr. ██████//

**Experiment 4:** 9/27/19██

Materials: Same as above, but with a lab rat (Rattus norvegicus), and a lidded tank.

Subject added to tank. Rat then added by robotic arm. Freezing observed instantly, and progressed rapidly, resulting in the death of the test animal in approx. 30 seconds. Freezing continued at a gradually accelerating rate for a further 3 mins before testing was discontinued and the room cooled to below 0°C to prevent further expansion of ice crystals. Sensors recorded increases of heat production in SCP-009, which created a self-sustaining reaction resulting in exponential growth of the red ice. 

Extraction of rat from SCP-009 mass deemed impossible at present time; test animal's [DATA EXPUNGED] converted entirely to SCP-009 and, due to cellular damage, is essentially liquefied. filtration in order to remove rat remains from SCP-009 containment tank is scheduled for 9/28.

//Notes: This is ridiculous! Even if you take into account the way water expands when it's frozen, the volume of ice we got is totally out of proportion to what we put in. It's got to be drawing more water from somewhere... ~Dr. ██████//

**Experiment 5:** 9/12/19██

Materials: 0.4 kg of frozen SCP-009, 1 standard child's wading pool, filled to the brim with H2O, heated to 40°C.

Using robotic arm, SCP-009 was added to the wading pool. Explosive contamination of the ambient water supply began, with all liquid observed to turn red mere seconds after introduction. Freezing continued and accelerated exponentially until a mass of red ice approx. 3 meters tall and 6 meters wide had spread across the floor and began climbing (and cracking) the glass of the observation window. Emergency cooling of the testing room via liquid nitrogen was enacted, and crisis contained. 

After analysis of this and other data, it has been determined that SCP-009 produces heat upon freezing at the same rate that normal water consumes heat while melting, proportional to the temperature of the affected material. 

//Note: This stuff definitely produces heat. Hmmm... that gives me an idea. ~Dr. ██████// 

**Experiment 6:** 10/07/19██

Materials: One (1) "red ice cube", approx 5cm square, encased in plastic, one (1) cup of hot soup.

Subject added to soup. No freezing observed. Observation continued for two
(2) hours, during which gradual melting of SCP-009 was observed, but no change in the ambient temperature of the soup was detected. Soup displayed no unusual properties after testing. 

//Notes: Haha! Success! It looks like SCP-009 will gradually lose heat after a while if it can't contaminate more water. We could so market this... Think about it, SCP-009 thermoses, SCP-009 heating blankets, SCP-009 warming condoms, the possibilities are endless! ~Dr. ██████// 

**Experiment 7-A:** 1/03/20██

Materials: One (1) Liter of SCP-009, one (1) cryogenic freezing unit.

SCP-009 was added to inactive unit in liquid phase. Unit was activated, and temperature lowered to -100°C. SCP-009 vaporized into gaseous state. Red coloration still observable in gas when compressed. 

//Notes: Again, pretty much what we expected. ~Dr. ██████// 

**Experiment 7-B:** 1/03/20██

Materials: Same as above, plus one (1) liter of H2O

H2O added to container of SCP-009 gas via robotic arm. No observed effect. Exposed water kept for 24 hours for observation. Experimentation continued. 

//Notes: Hmm...looks like it can't spread in gaseous state either. That's good to know. ~Dr. ██████//

**Experiment 7-C:** 1/03/20██

Materials: Same as experiment 7-A

Cooling unit increased to full capacity. As SCP-009 approached absolute zero, volatility was detected in the compressed gas and [DATA EXPUNGED] impaled by his own [DATA EXPUNGED] especially around the mucus membranes [DATA EXPUNGED] were all dead, with frost burns over ██% of their bodies. 

**Addendum:** SCP-009-B34

Low-temperature testing of SCP-009 disallowed until further notice. Body of Dr. ██████ is to be preserved for study.
