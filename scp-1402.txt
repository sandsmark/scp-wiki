**Item #:** SCP-1402

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1402 is to be contained in storage locker ███ on Sector █.  Any staff ranked level 3 or higher may be granted access, as long as reports are made for all tests and documents are submitted for review.  However, testing on other SCPs require Senior Staff approval before they may be carried out.

All documents received as a result of testing will be reviewed by a level 4 staff member who is not in relation to the document itself, before either being filed in filing cabinet ██ or kept by personnel upon request approval by reviewing level 4 staff, provided the document relates to said requesting personnel.
**(See [[[Experiment Log 1402]]])**

**Description:** SCP-1402 is a plastic brown Royal Traveller brand briefcase.  It measures 45 cm across, 30 cm in height, and 10 cm in width.  It can be opened by unlatching two (2) stainless steel clips found on either side of the rubber handle.  Each clip is outfitted with a key lock, yet the key has so far not been found.

If presented to any object or living thing (done by facing the opening toward said subject) and opened, SCP-1402 will dispense a number of documents providing explicit detail of the object or living thing's history up until SCP-1402 was presented to the subject.  These documents are in 8 point, Times New Roman font on A4 printing paper with 1 cm margins on all sides, printed in black India ink.  Testing has shown that SCP-1402 may only distribute 1000 pages per presentation.  The content is always written in the form of biography, e.g., "Dr. John Doe was born on January 1st, 1950."  In spite of this, documents are not always printed in English, but rather languages that may coincide with the subject it is presented to (Presentation to a citizen of Germany will result in the document being written in German, etc.).
