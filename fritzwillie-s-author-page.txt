**Quotes and Commentaries:**

"I'm tired of others always whining about originality, as if that was the most important thing, like something isn't creepy or interesting if you didn't think of it first. Anyway, it seems that no matter what you come up with, someone, somewhere, probably in Japan... has come up with it first or beaten it do death. For every one of my favorites, I can give you at least one example where its already been done, (on probably either Star Trek or the Twilight Zone).

That doesn't mean that they aren't good. For me, someone who puts their time into researching it, structuring it, making it believable but still pulling me into it. That's work you can take pride in, that's the work that I enjoy."
