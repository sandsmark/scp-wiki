It'd be a lie to say Ad Astra Per Aspera isn't bulky canon. There's a lot of worldbuilding that goes on and a lot more technical sci-fi than other canons normally have. However, with the right introduction it can be far less daunting than it may outwardly seem.

For some articles that require no background lore to understand:

* **[[[SCP-4774]]] - The Ninth Planet ^^@@[@@//citation needed//@@]@@^^** -- A fun mindscrew about a hypothetical planet in our solar system and its hypothetical existence. (//by MaliceAforethought//)

* **[[[SCP-3841]]] - Death & Rebirth** -- A short and punchy article about the remnants of another civilization's K-Class event. (//by NatVoltaic//)

* **[[[ghost-story|RAISA-007710]]]** -- A ghost story. (//by MaliceAforethought//)

Critical in establishing the causes of Earth's abandonment, the [[[amnesticization|ED-K Lethe series]]] is one of the most important canon parts to understand. The articles are, in posting order:

# **[[[SCP-3484]]] - Missing Pieces** (//by WrongJohnSilver//)
# **[[[SCP-3848]]] - History Exists for the Memorable** (//by Cyantreuse//)
# **[[[Excerpt from the Astrolabe Institute Journal]]]** (//by LordStonefish//)
# **[[[schulman-ny-programmable-mnestic-device-ac34d-nc77q-95dcs|'Schulman-NY Programmable Mnestic Device']]]** (//by WrongJohnSilver and Cyantreuse//)
# **[[[Paperpushing]]]** (//by Cyantreuse//)
# **[[[that-buzzing-behind-Your-eye|Headache]]]** (//by Rimple//)
# **[[[when-the-time-comes-i-do-not-want-to-be-forgotten|Oceanus, Father to All]]]** (//by Cyantreuse//)

For one last article that introduces the style of spacefaring humanity, reliant on the ED-K Lethe series:

* **[[[25-12-2047|25/12/2047]]]** -- A short tale about asteroid mining and handling loss. (//by NatVoltaic//)

++ What to read from there?

If the above is enough to get you interested in Ad Astra Per Aspera, it's recommended to read through the canon in chronological order. This way you can have a clear progression in technology, the status of humanity, and the Foundation's advancement. Significant details created elsewhere will likely be crosslinked to (though some reference of the Misc. tab in the Information section may be necessary).

Happy reading, and remember: //to the stars through hardship.//

//Over the course of the early 2040s, Earth is abandoned.//

//Following a continuous rise in the number and severity of [[[scp-3848|Lethe Events]]], the Foundation evacuates what's left of Earth's population and brings them to colonies throughout the solar system. This is not humanity's first foray into the void, though. Since the 2020s mankind has been leaving its cradle, staking claims around the sun with the assistance of the anomalous. First contact after first contact has come and gone. Extraterrestrials are no longer science fiction -- they are mundanity.//

//Outside the public's view the Foundation still keeps to their secrets. Beyond permitted colonizing territory, the Extrasolar Activities Division has been launching fleets of FTL ships far from the solar system, streaking from Neptune into the far reaches of interstellar space. Alien realms and wars and horrors unlike anything that could've been imagined. An entire galaxy of wonders, all an arms-length away.//

//With normalcy no longer a necessity the Foundation evolves to survive the cosmos: ruthless, expansive, and more driven towards scientific and corporate advancement than ever before.//

{{At the Space Race's end the Foundation takes a greater interest in the stars. Extraterrestrial anomalies make it clear that Earth is not the only world affected by the anomalous, and as human space exploration continues the need for research grows. Beginning with joint space agency ventures, the Foundation slowly establishes a network to monitor the solar system, all the while exploiting paratech and other anomalies to establish a physical presence beyond Earth.}}

{{Come the 2000s. Orbital Task Forces, containment stations, lunar areas and outposts on other planets form and expand. Progress is slow, space still being a challenge to traverse, but it is no matter -- the first steps out of the cradle have been made.}}

[[tab Canon Overview]]

[[span class="h-span"]]AD ASTRA PER ASPERA[[/span]] is a space opera set in the not-so-far future of the Foundationverse. Pushed by the threat of K-Class scenarios on Earth, the Foundation elects to transfer humanity off-world, spreading mankind throughout the solar system while, in secrecy, exploring the stars to find further worlds that could become homes. The setting is a blend of hard sci-fi and urban fantasy, where the anomalous is the mundane, the paratechnology is simply technology, and the aliens are no longer alien.

It's nothing like the world that was left behind.

It's only going to escalate from here.

[[/tab]]

[[tab Contributing]]

++ Where to Start

Before all else, read through the canon. Nothing familiarizes you with the setting better than engrossing yourself in it. Reading every article (especially as Ad Astra Per Aspera grows in size) isn't necessary, though reading a good sampling from each timeframe is recommended.

If this seems like something you'd be down to write for, next step is to check out the rest of the Writer's Guide tabs here, which will provide pointers on how to fit within the style and themes expected of all canon content.

Then you can check out the Information section below. Skimming is fine, so long you pay attention to what parts of the lore are likely to be relevant to your ideas.

++ Been there, done that. Now what?

By now you should be set for brainstorming. If IRC suits your fancy you can join **#aapa**, the official chatroom for the canon. If not, [[*user NatVoltaic]] is always open for WikiDot PMs and is available on Discord -- she's active in the [[[scpdeclassified|SCP Declassified]]] server, among other places. Canon contributors can examine your ideas and check to ensure they adhere to continuity, fit the canon style, and align with established lore.

Got your ideas greenlit? Then, write! Drafts can be run by #aapa and contributors for any critting and refining that's needed.

++ For Posting

Once the drafting process is done, you're ready to post! Ideally any issue will have been worked out beforehand so there won't be much else for you to do. It's highly recommended that canon articles use the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/component:ad-astra-theme Ad Astra Theme]. Import it by copy-pasting this piece of code to the top of your article:

> @@[[include :scp-wiki:component:ad-astra-theme]]@@

This will work in sandboxes as well, so do try it out there first!

If the article is surviving once it is posted, then you can add it to the hub in the relevant time frame with a short blurb or quote from the article. All entries are arranged chronologically, so be sure to check if it's placed alongside articles with similar dates. NatVoltaic is happy to sort things out if there's any confusion.

If you want to tag the article on your own, be sure include the "[http://www.scp-wiki.net/system:page-tags/tag/ad-astra#pages ad-astra]" canon tag.

[[/tab]]

[[tab Tone]]

+ Genre

Ad Astra Per Aspera is a hybrid of urban fantasy, cyberpunk, hard sci-fi, and space opera. It's colorful and flashy but with an undercurrent of realism and struggle. Magic and the anomalous are a facet of everyday post-Veil life, integrated with technology for massive advances in technological prowess. Most people don't directly use it but everyone is aware of it.

The engineering is realistic for what space has to offer: instead of space stations having artificial gravity generators you'll have [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_torus spinning ring stations]; instead of spacey fighter jets you'll have glorified tin cans strapped with heat radiators and fuel tanks. However, anomalies inherently break the laws of physics. FTL travel and FTL communication exist, and, if given the proper treatment, even the artificial gravity generators can too. The extraordinary is not only possible -- it's common.

Dystopian fiction also makes frequent appearances, such as in the Foundation's management of regions such as Mars and in the corporate sprawl of Luna Korea. Eldritch horror rears its head with the sheer density of alien life but is often subverted -- the unknown isn't as bad as the Foundation makes it out to be.

+ Tone and Themes

Pinning down an exact tone for Ad Astra Per Aspera is nigh impossible. The wide scope leads to massive variation in content, so setting a singular core theme is an impossible task.

The canon's about discovery. About frontiers, the ways we explore them, exploit them, and either wall them off from others or open them. It's about learning, handling new circumstances and the advancement (or lack thereof) that results. It's about the unknown, and whether we embrace it with open arms or reject and combat it. It's about how the old tries to keep power over the new. How we exploit the world. Each other.

Most importantly, it's about hope. No matter how bleak the dystopias, no matter how grim the wars or how dark the future seems, there is always a hope that the world will improve, a rebellious push against the systems in control and the powers that be. Some will give in to the circumstances. Many will fight back.

No matter what, the human spirit stays strong -- even when home is far from sight.

[[tab Related Continuities]]

As a reference for figuring out what can be referenced in/connected to Ad Astra Per Aspera, here's a list of what's explicitly compatible to the canon's continuity:

+ Canons

* **[[[broken-masquerade-hub|Broken Masquerade]]]** -- Much of Ad Astra Per Aspera is a direct continuation from Broken Masquerade content, specifically its ED-K Lethe stories and the themes regarding Foundation corporate expansion. Differences in continuity exist, the biggest being with the date of the Veil's loss.

* **[[[aiad-homescreen|AIAD]]]** -- AIC units make regular appearances in Ad Astra Per Aspera as ship-navigating intelligences. The rest of of the canon's content isn't inherently in continuity.

* **[[[project-heimdall|Project Heimdall]]]** -- Project Heimdall exists in-universe as part of the Extrasolar Activities Division, and is highly connected to the research of extraterrestrial civilizations. Not all articles in the Project Heimdall canon are expected to be fully canonical, though.

* **[[[third-law-hub|Third Law]]]** -- Much of the events and virtually all of the paratechnology in Third Law (prior to 2020) is canon to Ad Astra Per Aspera. However, **//Ad Astra Per Aspera is not canon to Third Law.//** Its events are past the scope of Third Law and come into conflict at numerous points.

+ Articles

* **[[[secure-facility-dossier-lunar-area-32|Secure Facility Dossier: Lunar Area-32]]]** -- All details on the site history and the Ethics Committee Bulletin are canon to Ad Astra Per Aspera.

+ What about crosslinked articles?

While all articles directly in Ad Astra Per Aspera will comply to the canon, ones they link to from outside of the canon likely won't be. Aside from whatever details are made use of in the articles, all other information should be considered variably canonical unless it has absolutely no conflict.

[[tab The Solar System]]

+ ##ccc|The Solar System##

The Solar System is mankind's new cradle.

From Mercury up to the asteroid belt, the Inner Solar System is the most controlled region of the system. The Foundation keeps a tight grip on all activities, monitoring the planets closest to the habitable zone and spreading influence as far as they can reach. With the sheer density of habitable space stations, colonies, and people, the Inner System has become the new heart of humanity.

From Jupiter onwards, the Outer Solar System is where the Foundation's influence sharply drops. The action is dominated by interplanetary politics, driven by ice mining as a source of profit or the hope of discovering exploitable anomalies. Where governments lack influence organizations such as MC&D reign. The Foundation failed to properly oversee the area during the initial bursts of post-evacuation colonization, and the impact of it reverberates today.

Past Uranus habitation cuts short. To avoid civilian encounters with the extrasolar operations conducted at Neptune, the Foundation forbids all forms of colonization past Uranus' orbit, restricting all expansion to the Outer and Inner system. While pockets of activity exist the majority of the solar outskirts are desolate. Unexplored. All that exists out there is yet to be known.

------

[[collapsible show="▷ Venus" hide="- Venus"]]

Venus is a resort planet. While no terraforming has been undertaken, the upper atmosphere provides comfortable conditions, with temperatures cooler than the surface and with atmospheric pressure at tolerable levels. Using technology retrieved from SCP-████, the Foundation has constructed sets of aerial cities unlike anything else they have to offer. Luxurious, gleaming, expensive. It's the Foundation's reward for those in the solar upper class who follow full compliance with their rules, and they make it known.

[[/collapsible]]

------

[[collapsible show="▷ Earth" hide="- Earth"]]

Home.

Formerly. By the time the Veil collapsed the Foundation had come to the realization that, with threats such as SCP-3848 events looming, the only route out is to leave. Colonization steadily lowered the population on Earth and, once the evacuations of the 2030s and 2040s ended, only half of the now interplanetary world population was left. With ED-K Lethe events those left don't even realize that they lost.

What had been built is falling apart. The abandoned containment sites have fallen into disarray, releasing anomalies into the emptied world or turning anomalous themselves. Nature is returning through the collapsing cities. While the Foundation allows people to "revisit" by controlling and watching through the eyes of drones on the surface, the threat of Lethe mind-wiping is enough to ward off any potential return trips. The planet is now left to the paranormal, the few humans left behind, and nature. We no longer have our birthplace.

[[/collapsible]]

------

[[collapsible show="▷ Luna" hide="- Luna"]]

+++ Luna Korea

Luna Korea is a lunar nation and a giant in interplanetary politics. Initially formed by South Korean lunar colonies in the 2020s and 2030s, its territories rapidly expanded, using networking between corporations, allied governments, and lunar mining companies to accumulate massive amounts of resources and capital. The capital and largest city is New Seoul, built inside the Marius Hills lunar lava tube, sealed off from the outside environment. The central government is entirely run by the Eun M1 Presidential AI.

Tensions with the Foundation are high. The Veil's loss broke the trust between South Korea and the Foundation, which had not informed the nation on the hazards formerly in neighboring North Korea. Subsequent Foundation expansion has been taken as a threat to national security, resulting in laws criminalizing any Foundation activity in Luna Korean territory -- a safe haven for those who have fought against Foundation control. To avoid interplanetary political backlash no direct action by the Foundation has been taken, though undercover intrusions are performed frequently.

[[/collapsible]]

------

[[collapsible show="▷ Mars" hide="- Mars"]]

Mars is humanity's first stop from Earth. The sudden activation of a temporal weapon on the Martian surface reverted the planet to a state from millions of years in the past, a state where the planet was lush and inhabitable, ripe for easy colonization. A perfect replacement for Earth in the event of apocalypse. Civilian travel is opened by the Foundation and the native Martian inhabitants, resurrected by the temporal incident, are enlisted for their insight on the landscape. The first interplanetary colonies rise.

In the decades since, the United Mars settlements have turned to slums. Foundation-run megacities span the coastlines, housing those who can't afford to move to better-off space stations, anomalous individuals cast out from their prior homes, people who simply have no other options in life. The control is tight and monitoring is everywhere. Areas of limited Foundation influence in the form of independent settlements and nations in the deserts past the coasts, though few are stable. All attempted revolutions have failed.

The Foundation is careful that they stay in power, no matter what the circumstances may be.

[[collapsible show="▷ Callisto" hide="- Callisto"]]

Following the exodus of the taronyu, the species quickly begins to colonize and terraform the Jovian moon of [[span class="h-span"]]Callisto[[/span]]. Callisto had been one of the next planned colonies of the Foundation, and was given to the taronyu to settle. Ironically, the taronyu government (known as the Tìhawnum) is resistant to Foundation control and influence over the colony.

The first colonies were little more than the docked spaceships that the taronyu used to leave Mo'ara, but a full city was established by 2036, four years after their arrival to Callisto. Terraforming is slower, but the moon becomes fully inhabitable (with an artificial sun and atmosphere) by 2065. A cloned ecosystem that mimics that of Mo'ara is reintroduced to Callisto in 2085.

Callisto is governed by the Tìhawnum, which have transitioned from a Foundation analog with the goal of preserving taronyu life into a proper democracy, following the destruction of every other taronyu institution.

[[collapsible show="▷ Interplanetary Space" hide="- Interplanetary Space"]]

Past the planetary colonies is a sprawl of space stations, spanning a range of orbits between the worlds and around the sun. In the Inner System these are ordered, registered with the Foundation and compliant to their every rule. In the Outer System it's a chaotic mess.

Some stations are Foundation-run, serving for containment, civilian life, or for imprisonment. Some are independent, being entire nations or single states in wholly space-borne countries. Some are designed for those who have fled Foundation rule or are working against it. Some are bases of criminal operations. Some are abandoned.

For over a third of humanity, this now home.

[[collapsible show="▷ Neptune" hide="- Neptune"]]

Neptune is under full Foundation control. Shipyards and containment satellites and security outposts riddle its orbit, constantly on patrol for intruders. While the station density isn't as high as it is for planets such as Mars, the security is far tighter. The operations being run here can't be found by the public.

+++ Orbital Area-11

Orbital Area-11 is Extrasolar Activities Division HQ. On the advent of the Lang Distortion Drives, the Foundation found that their FTL ships would commonly be tugged into the strongest gravity wells at their destination as they arrived. For ships returning to the edge of the solar system, this would always be Neptune. Ships launched from there and returned there.

With the planet being a hub for extrasolar travel, it was only fitting for EAD to construct their main base there. The station runs no containment of its own, instead being a massive command center in constant contact with probes and researchers traveling across the galaxy. The Astronomy Department operates in the station as well, checking in on their arrays of telescopes. Orbital Area-11 is the Foundation's eye on the sky, on lookout for what lies in the extrasolar expanses ahead.

+++ Zeta-01

Location of Interest Zeta-01 is an extradimensional city-state with entrances strewn throughout the cosmos with a massive extraterrestrial population. The locale has picked up hundreds of groups and entities, ranging from the evacuees of war-torn star systems to groups of wandering tradescreatures. Dozens of layers segment the interior, containing ranges of atmospheres and compositions to accommodate a range of species. The main entrance within the Solar System is in the Kuiper Belt, though others exist.

Since the 2040s the Foundation has managed extraterrestrial immigration from Zeta-01 into the solar system. All travel is directed through Transit Compound Naught-11, built into the cavern walls encompassing Zeta-01, and exits via Way at the Red Zeta Kuiper Belt outpost. From there ships distribute the arrivals throughout inner system areas. On occasion, some are recruited into the Foundation.

More importantly than simply managing immigration, though: managing Marshall, Carter & Dark. Next to Saturn the organization has a heavy influence, not directly impacting the communities there but rather enlisting them for aid. How much alien tech they've attained this way is unclear. All that's clear for the Foundation is that they need to be on constant watch, lest they obtain something they should never have control of.

The Milky Way is a busy place. While the Foundation carefully hides evidence of it from the public, the truth is that the galaxy is teeming with life. Our area has been (relatively) quiet, with few major civilizations and little of interest to bring outsiders our way, but past that is an active stellar realm. There are empires, megastructures, derelicts, alliances, wars, and more that Foundation explorers are yet to uncover. What we can see from the solar system is only the tip of the iceberg.

Globular Cluster Terzan 2 is a dense star cluster, ~28,000 ly from Sol and orbiting the Milky Way within the galactic core. The region is one of the most active interstellar regions in the galaxy, the short distances between star systems enabling fast transit for transportation, colonization, and combat. It's also host to among the largest extraterrestrial Ortothan sects and a war that has been waged for as long as the Foundation knows. //See the __Groups__ tab.//

Extragalactic space is unknown. While the Foundation has the ability to explore the Milky Way with ease, no FTL engine to date can cross the gap between galaxies, let alone overcome the constant expansion of spacetime due to dark energy.

There are signs of what lies out there: information trickling in from extragalactic residents of Zeta-01, telescopes spotting galaxy-sized impossibilities in the night sky, astronomers detecting faint signals from faraway points. No need for thorough investigation exists -- all that happens is too distant from the galaxy to ever leave an impact on humanity.

Until the technology arrives or until intergalactic events reach us, no interaction will occur. All we can do is watch.

[[/tab]]

[[tab FTL Travel]]

The spine of the Extrasolar Activities Division is its FTL technology. While reaching nearby stars at speeds of 0.999999999999//c// and higher is feasible for human time spans, on the order of tens of light-years to hundreds it rapidly drops into impossibility. Rapid interstellar transit is needed for any meaningful scouting of the interstellar neighborhood, but the speed of light is in the way. Physics is the ultimate barrier.

Fortunately, the anomalous exists. Physics is broken daily.

+ ##ccc|Engines##

------

[[collapsible show="▷ Lang Distortion Drives" hide="- Lang Distortion Drives"]]

Lang Distortion Drives were the first FTL engines invented by the Foundation. Through a series of heavily redacted deific bargains, the schematics for a set of propulsion rituals were obtained, which, once put into use, sent the very first human interstellar vessels to the stars.

The methods the engines use are unusual. In order to bypass the speed of light the engines actively //break// the laws of physics. Activating the propulsion rituals triggers ontokinetic phenomena that shatters reality in a shell around starships, accelerating them towards their destination at rates otherwise impossible in normal reality. The Lang Drives shred the rules to force themselves to work.

However, the Lang Drives aren't stable. At low multiples of //c// the engines function properly, but when their velocity goes too high? They glitch. Several ships have been slingshot out of the galaxy and out of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Group Local Group], crews have succumbed to endlessly looping temporal anomalies, and several vessels have shot through reality itself. Even at normal speeds the occasional error can send a ship into an ontokinetic death plunge. Understanding how the propulsion rituals work to avoid glitches is out of the question -- they're too complex and nonsensical for even the best engineers to comprehend. No repairs can be made.

The 2020s saw the greatest use of the Lang Drives. As glitch after glitch emerged through the 2030s, ships using the drives were all but abandoned by the end of the 2040s. The replacement came in 2047, in the form of Bifrost Superluminal Engines.

[[/collapsible]]

------

[[collapsible show="▷ Bifrost Engines" hide="- Bifrost Engines"]]

Bifrost Superluminal Engines are the second generation in Foundation FTL tech: stable, fast, and efficient.

Their methods vary from the rule-smashing of the Lang Drives, instead using loopholes in physics to avoid encountering the speed of light. On engine activation the ships are encompassed in a spacetime bubble, twisting to wholly isolate them from the outside spacetime of the universe. This bubble is then accelerated to faster-than-light velocities, dissipating and returning the ship back to normal spacetime on arrival. The importance of this is that, inside the reference frame of the bubble, the ship //never reaches or surpasses light speed//. The bubble's twisting of spacetime lets it do the heavy lifting.

The Bifrost Engines still carry catches to this, though:
* The bubble interiors are closed systems. Excess heat radiation from the ships and other waste will accumulate the longer a single FTL jump is in progress.

* The bubble itself is still affected by the gravity of the surrounding universe. For example: if a Bifrost Engine ship tries to jump to a planet near a massive black hole, the ship will be dragged towards the black hole and arrive there, not the planet. //The strongest gravity well at the intended destination is going to be the actual destination.// Gravity will affect the trajectory ships follow while in FTL transit, too.

* All bubbles encounter //something// while in FTL transit. The incidence of cognitohazardous phenomena sharply rises, and all crew of a Bifrost ship need sensory isolation in order to shield their minds.

* The engines themselves are massive. The earliest Bifrost Engine Mk.1 comprised 90% of the mass of its ship, dwarfing it in sheer size, and newer models have done little to improve on that.

Non-superluminal travel exists through sets of propulsion rituals performed by the engine -- no additional engines are needed for it.

However, there is a far, far greater issue with the Bifrost Engines.

What the engines actually are isn't known.

Information on technical details, the processes used to create the spacetime bubble, and how the Engines are even constructed is left unexplained to virtually all researchers. Any repairs to the engine interior and exterior are carried out by AI aboard the ship. No humans are ever allowed to enter themselves, and any who do are amnesticized and demoted. Even the lead engineers on the engines had their memories on the design project scrubbed.

Something important is being hidden, and the Foundation wants nobody to know about it.

[[collapsible show="▷ Taronyu Psionic Warp" hide="- Taronyu Psionic Warp"]]
One of the many xenoplants on Mo'ara was SCP-4547-C1, an sapient and psionic species. A taronyu that consumes a specific part of this plant receives significantly enhanced psionic capabilities, allowing them to see a greater world. Their ability to see mental connections is amplified 10,000 fold, as they briefly become host to a powerful soul.

In addition to this xenoplant, there exists a reality alongside our own known as subspace. This is a chaotic realm, one that is almost impossible to navigate and emerge from. It has been hypothesized that a powerful psion would be capable of navigating this realm, but there are no humans with abilities strong enough to do so. They would need to be capable of connecting to thousands of minds, and using those connections as anchors in an alternate dimension.

But while there are no humans with this ability, there are //taronyu// with this ability.

A taronyu who has consumed SCP-4547-C1 can successfully navigate to the location of another sapient mind they are familiar with while in subspace, as brain waves are reflected from real space into subspace, and then reemerge close to that location, using the inconsistent geometry of subspace to travel faster than light.

There are of course limits to this transportation: the first being the need for SCP-4547-C1, a now extinct xenoplant. Attempts at cloning SCP-4547-C1 are not successful until the late 2060's, and until that time, only stockpiles can be used. Additionally, this method is not useful for exploration - the operator must know a living soul at the other end of their transit.

+ ##ccc|Communication##

As important as FTL travel is, ensuring superluminal communication is just as important.

The most widely used solution is with [[span class="h-span"]]**Thaumic Communication Gateways**[[/span]]. With the right sets of rituals, Ways to a Foundation-controlled pocket dimension can be temporarily torn open. Transmissions are beamed into the pocket dimension, AI databases inside process the information, and responses are sent back through the way.

This comes with the catch that this pocket dimension is "localized" within the Solar System. Greater distances from the Solar System means greater energy requirements for creating the Ways and leaving them open. If distances are far enough, FTL ships may only be able to contact home once a week to not exhaust their energy supplies -- possibly longer. Similar methods have been used for long-distance transportation, though the same issues apply.

[[collapsible show="▷ The Foundation" hide="- The Foundation"]]

With the Veil gone, the Foundation has forced its way into an expansionist existence to maintain relevancy in the face of a nonexistent "normalcy."  The organization took full reigns over interplanetary colonization during the initial boom of the 2020s, establishing themselves throughout the inner solar system as a source of security, outputting propaganda on the dangers of the anomalous and the occult all the while.

By the modern interplanetary age they are one of the dominant forces of the Solar System. The Martian and Venusian government are effective puppet states, and swaths of space stations are allied to the organization for protection and containment benefits. Limited control over their own personnel has been heightened with the development of neural implants and other monitoring programs. The Foundation refuses to lose its seat of power -- what cost this brings is unimportant.

Foundation departments include:

* **Exobiology Department** -- A department concerned with the studying of extraterrestrial life, their culture, their biology, and their origins.

* **Extrasolar Activities Division** -- The chief division that manages all extrasolar explorations and operations.

* **Project Heimdall** -- The first project for investigation into extraterrestrial entities and threats, incorporated into the Extrasolar Activities Division as the Heimdall Council in the 2020s. The Council currently oversees extrasolar alien interactions and diplomacy.

* **Solar System Oversight Department** -- A department dedicated to the monitoring of the Solar System as a whole, interplanetary politics, interplanetary logistics, and large-scale anomalous incidents.

The interstellar nature of the Ortothan religion further reinforced their significance in extraterrestrial interactions. As of the 22nd century it is one of the largest religious organizations in the Solar System, only growing further as more extraterrestrial adherents migrate in.

[[span class="h-span"]]The Terzan 2 Ortothan Coalition[[/span]] is a loose militaristic alliance of Ortothan civilizations and entities within Globular Cluster Terzan 2. The group is among the largest Ortothan sects in the galaxy, largely confined within the boundaries of the cluster yet still exerting a reach on the outlying space. 

The Coalition was founded in response to [[span class="h-span"]]Twelve Stars[[/span]], an expansionist civilization native the cluster. Repeated territorial conflicts in the past built animosity between the two, and as of the early 21st century Twelve Stars launched a massive campaign to eradicate all Ortothan settlements in the star cluster. Primary tactics have been surprise attacks, sending warships through wormholes to prevent tracking and limit preparation time. Further attacks by Twelve Stars ships are known to have occurred outside of the Coalition's territory -- the farthest has come from Andromeda.

Despite the force Twelve Stars exerts, it's unknown where they reside. The civilization was known to be an alliance between the civilizations of twelve neighboring stars, but all traces of these stars and their inhabitants have vanished.

They are refugees from the planet [[span class="h-span"]]Mo'ara[[/span]], which was devastated by several dozen apocalyptic events. A single bunker contained thousands of taronyu in suspended animation survived until a Foundation exploration discovered Mo'ara and brought the taronyu to Earth.

Since then, they have begun to integrate into Sol System society, primarily settling on the now terra-formed moon Callisto. Taronyu are rare throughout the galaxy, as only a small number survived, but their numbers increase as time passes from their exodus.

Physically, the taronyu are a humanoid species with longer body proportions than the average human - this causes them to generally be taller and more slender than the average human. Their skin tones vary from yellowish-tans to dark greens, all of which are visibly non-human in appearance. They do not have external ears or noses. While they have body hair, it rarely grows more than a few millimeters long and is not generally noticeable. Finally, the taronyu have six biological sexes, each of which can mate with any other sex.
