Yay! Apparently I have collected enough page to warrant an Author Page!

I'm Rigen. Well I pretty much only used that nick here, elsewhere you might find me by the name "riyangendut" which is kinda lame and unwieldy, hence I shorten it into Rigen--RIyan GENdut. As you can see by my ownership of this page, I'm an author for a couple SCPs and a tale, the bare minimum of owning an author page.

My first article was [[[SCP-3056]]], a virus that makes you sneeze fire. It's a basic X that does Y thing, and I over-detailed it with technobable, basically. Nothing interesting.

My second surviving article was the "[[[be-a-wizard-they-said|It Will Be Fun, They Said]]]" that's a tale, I intended it to be formatted like internal communication buletin for GOC operatives. I wanted to make it bizarrely normal article where the writers and readers are expected to talk about magic and centuries old magician etc with poker face. But it ended up being not really interesting. Maybe I should revisit the concept sometime.

My third surviving article was [[[SCP-4916]]] featuring three square numbers on its title! Oh and an ancient Assyrian statue. In space. But who cares, it got three square numbers 4, 9, and 16!

Yeah I'm just an all-around boring guy leave me alone >_<
Will update if I post new article.
