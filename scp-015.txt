**Item #:** SCP-015

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-015 is to be kept in confinement at all times. Cell block must always be locked and secured. All cells used for SCP-015 must be made from refined, impenetrable metal and one window with iron clad bars. If for some reason he is to be transferred, at __least__ four personnel must escort him. Subject must not come near anyone within a radius of two meters unless granted access to.

No potential weaponry or items that could pose a threat can be brought into his cell, in the case of any attempt of breaking out or killing personnel. Anyone entering his cell, let alone going near him, must wear protective clothing at all times. After interaction, protocol requires decontamination of anyone whom was in proximity of SCP-015.

Subject is now confined in Containment Area-██ until further action is taken. SCP-015 requires constant surveillance throughout the night. Subject is nocturnal, and is known to wail and scratch during the night. This is considered normal, and if this behaviour changes, it requires immediate reporting to an active supervisor.

**Description:** SCP-015 has the appearance of a jester, yet the skin tone and characteristics of a goblin. According to an interview, he is ███ years old. Subject’s eyes have been known to glow in the darkness, and decaying teeth are present. He is known to bear striped braces and a pyramid shaped hat. He responds to the name “Jester”.

Subject has been known to slaughter his victims using objects around him or his long fingernails. When SCP-015’s enemies have been assimilated, Jester will use their blood and write a tally mark upon his cell wall. One, two, three, four…

Jester can scale walls using his adhesive palms, not unlike a spider effect. This was once seen during [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Addendum:** //It seems we aren’t that different, Subject 015. We both have some “humanity” left in us. – Dr. Nicole Berry before termination, due to contact//
