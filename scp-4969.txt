**Item #**: SCP-4969

**Object Class**: Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures**: A small batch of SCP-4969 is contained in Cryo-Storage Locker 4969 in Wing E3 of Site-56. Search conditions for all "LiveFeel" Products and known product terminology are to be added to Foundation web crawlers. MTF Nu-63 (Safe Sects) are to be dispatched to locations suspected to be producing SCP-4969. All Affected individuals are to be taken into Foundation custody for research and neutralization. Any SCP-4969 found for sale are to be removed from circulation and destroyed.

**Description**: SCP-4969 are a species of parasitic Gelatinous Zooplankton. SCP-4969 are extremely resilient compared to other zooplankton and greatly resemble male condoms. Instances are capable of living in a hibernated state for up to 2 years in their birth environment, which is primarily comprised of a saline and nutrient emulsion. When placed on a human penis, SCP-4969 will fuse to the host and bond with its nerves and blood vessels. Using this process, SCP-4969 will obtain all further needs until its natural death after 12 hours, after which, all bonds are severed and the instance can be removed from its host. SCP-4969 instances will expire within 10 minutes if exposed to air without being attached to a host. 

Hosts, hereafter referred to as SCP-4969-1, describe a slight burning sensation during the short bonding process. After bonding, SCP-4969 will then flood the host's system with a concoction of chemicals[[footnote]] Refer to Report-4969-Alpha for a summary of chemical composition and their effects on human physiology. [[/footnote]] with a highly aphrodisiac effect. Additionally, whenever a host has conscious or subconscious sexual urges or tendencies, high amounts of dopamine are infused into the host to further promote sexual activity. SCP-4969 is noted to greatly amplify the pleasure of sexual intercourse. Due to the narcotic nature of the anomaly, hosts are prone to wearing SCP-4969 instances constantly.

If an SCP-4969-1 instance successfully engages in sexual activity with another human, regardless of sex or reproductive abilities, an outer layer of cells from the bonded SCP-4969 instance will shed off and enter the partner's bloodstream, beginning the organism's breeding process. After a period of two weeks, the partner will show signs of abdominal swelling, caused by the gestation of the shed SCP-4969's cells. Inspection of partner individuals, now designated SCP-4969-2, will invariably show them to be spawning more instances of SCP-4969[[footnote]] Place of gestation varies but is always located in the abdomen, with multiple batches capable of being carried simultaneously. [[/footnote]]. Gestation lasts approximately 2 months per batch, whereafter an amount of between 50 to 300 SCP-4969 instances will be expelled. [[footnote]] Methods of expulsion are variable and include vomiting, defecation and expulsion via the urinary system[[/footnote]] from the carrier, along with a large amount of gestational fluid. Hosts are often confused, disturbed and fearful of this process.

During the month of July 20██, planted Foundation Agents in a rural South African township noticed an above average drop in visible female civilians. This, combined with strange behaviour and lack of concern from the remaining members of the public, was considered sufficient for the approval of further investigation and additional assets.

A small team of agents raided a home suspected of containing information regarding the missing females and discovered a makeshift facility using female hostages to produce what is now known to be SCP-4969. After a short investigation involving host interogation, the origin of SCP-4969 was traced to Gauteng, a major city in the country. 

Using information received from undercover agents posing as civilians interested in SCP-4969, Foundation agents infiltrated and destroyed multiple locations producing SCP-4969 and, in the process, discovered most of the invaluable information about the anomaly. Notable details are seen below:


* The SCP-4969 organism is theorized to have originated from the coastal area of KwaZulu-Natal. However, no wild SCP-4969 instances have been found since the discovery of its existence.


* During their partner's "pregnancy", SCP-4969-1 individuals will display an unnaturally gleeful demeanor and show an intense affinity for SCP-4969. After gestation, SCP-4969-1 will attempt to spread SCP-4969, Encouraging friends and family to try them for enhanced sexual pleasure


* After SCP-4969-2 expel a batch, they are coerced into either producing more or assisting SCP-4969-1 individuals to spread SCP-4969, resistance is not met peacefully.


* It has been discovered that a group of SCP-4969-1 individuals have begun selling SCP-4969 as condoms under the Brand "LiveFeel Plus". Due to the low-cost/high-yield potential, most SCP-4969-1 individuals will establish facilities in their former homes with the intention of selling the products in large quantities to retailers and/or individuals. This causes a cycle in which the victims of these purchases will often approach the Sellers and begin working for them, together with their respective partners, creating a "multi-level marketing" business model. 


* The largest production site found to date was in ███████ ████, ████████, consisting of a commune with over 20 gestating individuals. They were found to be [REDACTED]. Only 3 Individuals were able to be removed without expiring. 

* MTF Nu-69 are currently searching for the leader of the LiveFeel scheme.

At the conclusion of the interview, a team of standby agents successfully cleared, amnestized and freed the kidnapped civilian. Further investigation revealed the location used as SCP-4969-1-56's breeding facility. Nine gestating individuals were found being held unwillingly. SCP-4969-1-56 was successfully apprehended but expired in custody as a result of unidentified blunt force injuries.
