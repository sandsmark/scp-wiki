**Item #:** SCP-2319

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to its depth and otherwise lack of interest to the international community, SCP-2319's containment is considered //de facto//. In order to maintain this in perpetuity, an international cordon has been established around SCP-2319.

At this time, the Foundation does not agree on the long-term survivability of SCP-2319, owing to the environment being hostile to the materials composing SCP-2319.

**Description:** SCP-2319 is the location and contents of a shipwreck off the southern coast of Australia. Its specific co-ordinates are latitude -39.458127°, longitude 132.424794°. The wreckage and materials recovered appear to be identical to the wreckage of the RMS Titanic, which sank on April 15 1912. All materials returned from SCP-2319's wreckage have been dated to specifications that would have been in use in 1912, with the exception of one item (see Addendum). 

SCP-2319 was discovered by outside sources on October 7th ████, and contained by the Foundation three weeks later under the guise of a low-level ecological disaster. Historical maps show no hints of SCP-2319 dating back decades, but the current surface terrain is as identical to the ones found at the Titanic wreckage.

Compared to the wreckage of the Titanic, SCP-2319 is mirrored along the X axis. Existing maps of the Titanic, once flipped east/west, are identical to SCP-2319 in all major landmarks[[footnote]]For example, the Titanic's bow points broadly North-East, with the aft section south, with a large debris field to the east. In SCP-2319's case, the bow points broadly North-West, with the large debris field west of the aft wreckage.[[/footnote]] . All text on or recovered from SCP-2319 is also mirrored. For example, the signage marking the ship's name is //ƆIИATIT ƧMЯ//. This includes more contemporary commemorative plaques. The only other noticeable difference between SCP-2319 and the remains of the Titanic is that the remaining paintworks on the hull hint that instead of a red underside, SCP-2319's lower hull coloring is green.

As with the Titanic wreckage, a unique ecosystem of anemones, crabs, shrimp, starfish, and rattail thrive within the wreckage of SCP-2319. As of this writing, all attempts at bringing samples of the fauna to the surface for further study have failed, as all samples die within 3.2km of SCP-2319[[footnote]]Initial findings hint that the creatures have died, inexplicably, of asphyxiation, despite being stored in waters directly from SCP-2319.[[/footnote]]. 

**Addendum SCP-2319-A:** Originally deemed an aberrant system malfunction, reports of submersible navigation issues have become more consistent while exploring SCP-2319. Pilots report random moments where commands to move to port result in starboard motion, or upwards translating to downward motion. Complete repair of MROVs does not solve the issue.

**Addendum SCP-2319-B:** Foundation experts studying artifacts recovered from SCP-2319 have reported increased feelings of nausea and disorientation from mid-to-long term exposure to all artifacts. The effect is described as disorienting but not incapacitating. As of ██/██/██, all teams studying artifacts from SCP-2319 are to work in 24 hour shifts. 

**Addendum SCP-2319-C:** A recent exploration of SCP-2319 has revealed a unique artifact, dubbed SCP-2319-2. Buried under a bulkhead with age-appropriate debris and weathering was a contemporary air-tight safe, it contained a clear plastic plate with the following phrases etched onto it:
