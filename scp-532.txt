**Item #:** SCP-532

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Standard bio-hazard containment procedures are to be followed for all research samples of SCP-532. Samples are to be kept at a constant temperature of -8°C. Any personnel encountering instances of SCP-532 outside of Foundation custody are to evacuate all outdoor areas immediately and contact Dr. ██████████.

**Description:** SCP-532 is a pathogenic bacteria most similar in composition to //Pseudomonas oryzihabitans//. SCP-532 shows an increased tolerance for low temperatures, showing peak reproductive rates at -25°C. The full tolerance range of SCP-532 is approximately -52°C to -5°. Furthermore, SCP-532 shows several mechanisms in order to cope with high temperatures.

Several small flagella line the cell membrane, allowing SCP-532 to be carried by air currents into the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere. Due to a lack of energy source, SCP-532 will enter into a state of hibernation for an indefinite amount of time while in the atmosphere.

SCP-532 will leave its hibernating state once it detects warm air currents coming from the troposphere. SCP-532 will then retract several of its flagella and descend into the troposphere. The heat provided by the troposphere generally causes several instances of SCP-532 to turn into a "clump", similar in view to a snowflake. If the heat provided by the troposphere is above 0°C, SCP-532 will typically die before reaching the Earth's surface. Instances of SCP-532 reaching any inorganic material or a non-exothermic organism will spread their flagella and be carried by air currents back into the upper stratosphere.

Instances of SCP-532 that land on a heat-providing organism will produce a natural freezing agent, causing affected cellls to freeze and die. Victims of SCP-532 describe this sensation in a similar manner to the cold produced when any natural snowflake touches human skin. SCP-532 will then break-down the dead cell and reproduce.

[[/div]]
SCP-532 shows a tendency to break-down and ingest the dermis, and will not enter the body until the surrounding dermis has been covered. SCP-532 will then enter the blood-stream, causing major damage to the circulatory system due to the freezing and subsequent expansion of water molecules. Typically the victim will die of blood-loss.

Following the death of a host victim, SCP-532 will migrate back into the upper stratosphere.

SCP-532 shows a 98% mortality rate if left untreated, 100% if SCP-532 is "caught on the tongue". Treatment of victims of SCP-532 may be conducted through exposure to water heated to 20°C or more, however this results in massive tissue damage to affected areas. Extreme cases of SCP-532 infection may require amputation of affected limbs.
