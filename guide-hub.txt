+++ __Useful Guides__

++++ The following guides are not mandatory, but come highly recommended by the staff and users. You must submit a guide for approval to have it added to this list. 

* **[[[About the SCP Foundation]]]**: An in-universe explanation of what the SCP Foundation is at the most basic level.

* **[[[Doing the Safety Dance]]]**: A guide to making reasonable, interesting containment procedures.

* **[[[zen-and-the-art-of-data-redacted| Zen And The Art Of DATA REDACTED]]]**: A very useful guide to redaction, expungement, and censorship.

* **[[[technical-writing| Technical Writing]]]**: Writing about technical matters for the non-technical. Most of us are authors, not scientists. This might be useful if you're wanting to get that technical twist in your writing that you're having problems with.

* **[[[technical-words| Technical Words]]]**: Various science-y and engineering-y words and what they mean. Useful for making your writing sound more scientific and professional.

* **[[[Expert Witnesses]]]**: Which users to go to for certain information, and what their credentials are.

* **[[[The Big List of Overdone SCP Cliches]]]**: A list of things that have either been done to death or don't fit in with the tone of the Foundation. Done in a comical tone, and certainly not canon. If someone points you to this page and tells you that your SCP sucks without other explanation, you are free to sass back.
