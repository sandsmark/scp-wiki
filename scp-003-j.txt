**Item #:** SCP-:3

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-:3 infected individuals are to be contained in high-security humanoid containment cells at Site 3. Personnel may not directly interact with SCP-:3 infected individuals, and any personnel suspected of being infected by SCP-:3 must be terminated immediately and their remains incinerated to prevent any possibility of an outbreak.--

Due to widespread epidemic of SCP-:3 infestation, Foundation efforts are now directed merely at locating and terminating terminal-stage SCP-:3 infectees. Please see Addendum-:3-05 below.

**Description:** SCP-:3 is a highly virulent memetic agent spread primarily via written, especially electronic, text. When exposed to SCP-:3, subjects are affected by a compulsion to seek out an infected subject and ask what SCP-:3 is. Once explained to, subjects enter the second stage of SCP-:3 infection, wherein they begin to insert duplicates of SCP-:3 into written and typed text, ostensibly to 'portray emotion'. SCP-:3 is polymorphic, and has been documented in over █,███ unique forms. Subjects will gradually develop variations on the standard SCP-:3 forms and spread those in the standard method as outlined above.

Infected subjects will invariably enter a third terminal stage of SCP-:3 infection, wherein SCP-:3 progressively replaces all forms of textual communication. There is no known cure for terminally infected subjects at this time.

SCP-:3 was first encountered [REDACTED BY ORDER OF O5 COUNCIL]

**Addendum :3-01:** Updated Information

With the introduction of the Internet, SCP-:3 infections are now propagating at an exponential growth rate. Current models show that SCP-:3 may outgrow the Foundation's ability to suppress it by 199█.

**Addendum :3-02:** Researcher Note

> I don't know about this, guys. :\ I don't really see anything wrong with :3, and I certainly don't see why we're throwing away so much money to keep :P contained.

**Addendum :3-03:** Incident :3-17

Dr. S█████ has been terminated following confirmed terminal infection of SCP-:3.

**Addendum :3-04:** Incident :3-38

Mass SCP-:3 outbreaks have been reported by Foundation assets in Japan. The new instances of SCP-:3 documented have massively increased virulence, and were described as "cute" by initial contact agents before self-termination.

**Addendum :3-05:** Memetic Counter-Agent :3-01B

By O5 Council order, Memetic Counter-Agent :3-01B has been introduced into all major population centers. :3-01B introduces a subtle aversion to elements of SCP-:3, causing individuals who view them to consider them "silly" or "immature" as well as embedding a slight compulsion to roll their eyes. This effect has been proven to prevent progression to terminal stage in 99.97% of inoculated subjects.
