   I've got the thing behind me right now. How many tests did they do on this thing? And who on? Maybe some random D-Class? 

   After looking at the evidence you sent, I've got to agree with you whole-heartedly. This game isn't anomalous whatsoever. It's just a couple of people getting too involved in a goddamn board game. I've shown your work to junior researchers Syrek and Wright. They both agree. We've got a plan to make a report to the Director and we'll need your help. Reply ASAP if you are interested.

   Jack,  
   Regarding those initial questions, documents suggest they took "friendly" D-Classes to test this thing. Twice. Clearly not enough to prove any anomalous effects. I can help you with your report. 

When going through the logs, I found where it came from. Some kid was selling it because he blamed it for "ruining mommy and daddy's marriage". He'd gotten it for his birthday, but when his parents played it, they got in an argument over real money and divorced. Kid dead hated that game. I don't blame him, although it's not like that marriage would have lasted if you ask me. 

Anyways, what do you need? A co-witness? Report verification? It can't be on-shift though, I've got to lead research on my current skip. 
   - Piet

   Thanks for your interest. We aren't planning to send a //normal// report, per se. We're gonna play the thing ourselves and take a video of it. Saves us at least two weeks of paperwork just to clear this thing. We package that up with the report, send it off to the Director. He's a man of common sense. I've got Wright, Syrek, me, and hopefully you. Eckhart's gonna videotape it. Let me know if that's fine with you. If so, meet at the recreation room tomorrow in Sector 17.

I can't believe I ever trusted a person like you. You saw. Syrek nearly tore Wright's throat out. I'm talking to the Director about this.

I don't fucking care what you do or who the fuck you talk to. If I ever see your miserable ass with another miserable plan, I swear I'll send you to the miserable infirmary. Wright fucking deserved it. What maniac puts 2 hotels on a property?

That goddamn "non-anomalous" bullshit you were spouting about obviously isn't fucking true whatsoever. That's why we can't stop goddamn fighting, I bet. I wouldn't be surprised if we get shipped to goddamn Alaska, you Russian fuck.
