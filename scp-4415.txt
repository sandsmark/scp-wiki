**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4415 is self-contained within Site-17's Humanoid Containment Wing. All explorations of SCP-4415 must be performed by anomalous persons contained within its vicinity; as a result of this, there exists the possibility that said anomalous persons may become lost during an abortive exploration. To prevent an egregious breach of informational security, each humanoid has been administered a Class-S ("Slow Burn") amnestic, to be activated after each successful mission.

**Description:** SCP-4415 is a set of extradimensional locations accessible through the door of the former Humanoid Containment Unit #λ045 at Site-17. Due to the variable nature of SCP-4415's interior, it has been hypothesized that the containment unit serves as a waypoint for multiple extra-spatial and extra-temporal locations. Additionally, SCP-4415 is only accessible to anomalous humanoids; attempts to enter SCP-4415 by non-anomalous persons have been unilaterally unsuccessful.

The purpose of exploratory missions into SCP-4415 has primarily been to discover the nature, origin, and intent of its hypothetical creator; [[[SCP-4051]]][[footnote]] A male humanoid who has been used by Site-17 on several occasions to explore anomalous locations. [[/footnote]] has been used to achieve this end. Explorations have determined that each extradimensional location is generally inhabited by one anomalous humanoid per location.

The following are brief summaries of the extradimensional spaces explored by SCP-4051:

------
> **Database Index:** 1B7-4415-001
> **Description:** A heavily forested area of deciduous trees, surrounding a small pond and clearing.
> **Inhabitant:** A female humanoid which has demonstrated anomalous arboreal manipulation and possesses numerous lacerations to the hands, torso, and scalp. Subject demonstrated an extreme aversion to human contact.
------
> **Database Index:** 1B7-4415-002
> **Description:** A world composed of semi-physical objects resembling free-floating digital polygons.
> **Inhabitant:** A young, male humanoid possessing potent ontokinetic capabilities. Subject seemed to be of inconsistent physical form, involuntarily demanifesting at random intervals.
------
> **Database Index:** 1B7-4415-003
> **Description:** A modest, two-story domicile overlooking an ocean cliff.
> **Inhabitant:** An elderly humanoid male with many thaumaturgic and occult symbols inscribed onto its body. Subject possessed significant physical trauma from an unknown source.
------
> **Database Index:** 1B7-4415-004
> **Description:** Location exists in a state of spatial flux, but is generally described as possessing a purple hue.
> **Inhabitant:** An amorphous entity demonstrating metamorphic capabilities, oftentimes presenting as two female humanoids. Subject(s) possessed mild clairvoyance, but could rarely communicate intelligibly.
------
> **Database Index:** 1B7-4415-005
> **Description:** A stone spire, inside of which is an unoccupied and unremarkable library.
> **Inhabitant:** //N/A//

Dr. Graham,

You may recognize my name from a project we collaborated on nearly a month ago, you being an Operational Overseer and me being a consultant from the Department for Extratemporal Studies. The project in question was an exploration of a non-normative space within SCP-4415, designated 1B7-4415-005, which contained a library of books ostensibly written by SCP-4415's creator. It is of interest to me that this detail has been omitted from SCP-4415's documentation and that a transcript of a text retrieved from 1B7-4415-005 has been restricted to Level 4/4415 clearance.

Fortunately, I saved a personal copy of the text during the exploration, which I've attached below.

> [[[He Who Screws With Reality | The old man stopped coming to see me after a while.]]] I think he was promoted to a position as an Overseer, which seems about right. I hope he's doing well now.
> 
> After he left, they brought in a new Site Director named Graham. Dr. Weathers must have kept me hidden well enough, because no one's ever come to my containment unit in all these years. My neighbors are probably the closest things to visitors I'll ever get.
> 
> The first one was a girl, fairly young. She seemed scared, and I think she could control plants. I'm not really sure about that, though — I'm omnipotent, not omniscient. What I do know is that Graham wanted her to grow the drugs for their amnestics, and if she couldn't perform, they'd try to cut her open and see if they could do it themselves. After a while, she wasn't in the cell next to mine. I try not to think about her.
> 
> Next was a boy in a computer. He was a lot like me, but smarter. He didn't want to kill the whole world, just show people what he could do in his little virtual reality. Graham wanted him to run this system they have set up here — I think they call it [[[APAS]]]. They essentially flood the office memos with memetic agents and send amnestics through the ventilation to keep their personnel in line. If I were on the Ethics Committee, I'd be investigating that shit, but hey, stones from glass houses and all.
> 
> They messed around with his hardware for a bit, but I don't think it came to anything. They must have damaged him, because they ended up scrapping the computer one day.
> 
> Third was an old man with a ton of tattoos. When you saw him, you got the sense that he'd been around the world and seen a lot. Graham must have wanted what was in his head, too, because he'd be escorted out of his cell every morning and be returned in the evening with a few new injuries. He didn't come back one night.
> 
> I'm pretty sure my last neighbor was actually two people. I'm not sure what their deal was, but the researchers tested a lot of psychic anomalies on them. I think one of the experiments messed their heads up a lot, and they were never the same after that. Before the accident, I could hear them comfort one another after every experiment. I could tell they really loved each other.
> 
> I haven't heard from them in a while, so I think they were terminated like the rest. It got me thinking about the rest of my life, though. I'm probably stuck in here until someone manages to kill me or the Foundation falls, which won't be any time soon. I don't think I can live like that anymore. My neighbors were five people who deserved life a whole lot more than I ever did; it'll take almost everything I've got, I think, but if it means protecting them from harm, I'm willing to make the sacrifice.
> 
> So I'll bring them back, give them a paradise, and hopefully someone will help them back into the real world after a while. Shouldn't be that hard.
> 
> Weathers, if you're reading this, just know I ended up as a good guy.
> 
> Bye, I guess.

Naturally, the contents of this transcript are rather incriminating. I've done a little more digging on my own after working with SCP-4051 on the SCP-4415 project, and what concerns me is that, of fifteen attachments, only one is available to researchers of Level 2/4051 clearance. He's not a god, Graham. What is the Foundation trying to hide about him?

Every document involving you seems to be contaminated by redactions and memetic kill agents, and judging by Dr. Cimmerian's note in [[[SCP-4175]]]'s documentation, the Ethics Committee has begun to notice your methods, and they aren't pleased. If someone were to forward the attached transcript to them, it would most likely set off an extensive investigation into your activities as Site Director.

Naturally, I wouldn't do something like that to you without hearing from you first. What I need to know is that there's a rational, ethical explanation for what you've been doing. If you can give that explanation to me, and I find it convincing, I'll hold off on drafting the petition to the Committee.

Best wishes,
Dr. Natalie Reems

Dr. Reems,

Naturally, there is always a rational explanation. An ethical explanation is harder to determine, given our own confusion over the matter of morality.

Do you know why the Overseers are petrified by the thought of a Lifted Veil scenario? Why they spend several million dollars a year to fund amnestic production? It's because the public would crucify us, if they discovered what we do here. Our mission sometimes mandates that we place living, thinking humans into boxes for the crime of being abnormal, and that would not sit right with many people. The public would not find that behavior particularly ethical.

But to dissolve the Foundation would mean to doom the world to anomalous damnation. It is undeniable that our efforts have saved Earth from countless demises, and will continue to do so in the future. So we must do whatever we can to contain these threats, a necessity deemed to be very much ethical by the Overseers and the Ethics Committee alike.

You'll notice that my reply, thus far, has not been particularly convincing. I have not conjured up excuses for what I've done or manifested directives from the Overseers to pin the blame on them. This is because I do not care all that much about convincing you. As with the public and the Foundation, the true arbiter of ethics is the one with the bigger stick.

My stick, in this case, is the latent memetic agents scattered through this email and the Class-A amnestics currently flooding your office space. Just let the induced paralysis run its course as the drugs take your mind away.

I really did enjoy working with you on the SCP-4415 project, Natalie. I could see why Tonya fancied you so.

Best wishes,
Dr. Thomas Graham, Director of Site-17
