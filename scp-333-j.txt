**Item #:** SCP-333-J

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-333-J has been purchased from the owner through a front corporation and staffed with agents and researchers, who will keep detailed records of all anomalous events happening within SCP-333-J. **Due to the high volume of transfer requests, no further agents will be stationed at SCP-333-J until further notice.**

**Description:** SCP-333-J is a bar called Skippy's Corner Pub, located ten miles west of █████ ███, ██. Periodically, persons of various backgrounds and professions will be drawn into the bar to interact with either bar staff, patrons, or one another. Occasionally, various animals and objects have manifested to assist in these interactions. There seems to be no observable correlation between those affected to date, and the majority of affected persons have shown no ill effects due to exposure to SCP-333-J following their interaction with its effect.  

The following log is a record of various interactions observed within SCP-333-J. Researchers are encouraged to investigate further and add their own findings.

> A man walks into the bar with a metal box under one arm and a duck under the other. The man walks up to the bar and says to the bartender, "If you give me a free bottle of beer I'll show you my dancing duck". The barman is surprised, but gives the guy a Bud and asks the bloke to show him the duck dancing. So the guy puts the metal box on the bar, and stands the duck on top of it. A few seconds later the duck starts to jump around, as if he's doing an Irish jig.
> 
> Everyone in the bar is now watching this duck dancing, and the barman offers the guy $50 for the duck and the box. The bloke accepts, and the pub is filled day and night for 3 days with people watching the amazing dancing duck.
> 
> So 3 days after he sold the barman the duck, the guy walks back in to the pub and sees his duck dancing on the box on top of the bar.
> 
> The barman sees the guy and offers him a bottle of Bud on the house. As he gives the guy the Bud, the barman asks, "Could you tell me how you stop the duck from dancing on top of the box?"
> 
> The man replies, "Oh that's easy, you just take the hot coals out."

> "What? You have to speak up!"

> A blind man walks into the bar with a seeing-eye dog. When the blind man reaches the center of the bar, he snatches the dog up by his collar and starts swinging him around and around.
> 
> The bartender speaks up and says, "Hey, what the hell are you doing?"
> 
> The blind man says, "Just taking a look around."

> **Date: █-██-████**
> 
> A guy walks into the bar and sees a dog lying in the corner licking his balls. He turns to the bartender and says, "Boy, I wish I could do that."
> 
> The Bartender replies, "You'd better try petting him first." 
> 
> 
> **Notes:** //I got nuttin' for that.// -Agent █████

> **Date: █-██-████**
> 
> A guy walks into the bar with a newt on his shoulder and orders a drink.
> 
> The Bartender says, "Nice pet, what's his name?" 
>  
> "His name is Tiny," the man replies.
> 
> "Why do you call him that?"
> 
> "Because, he's my newt."

> **Date: ██-██-████**
> 
> An elderly man and woman enter the bar and ask the bartender for their usual drinks.
> 
> The bartender serves them, speaking to the man, "Mr. Johnson, it's been awhile since we saw you last, how are you and your wife doing?  We were worried about you, the last time you came in you didn't seem to recognize or remember anyone."
> 
> The elderly gentleman responds, "Well, you know how it is when you start getting up in years. . . but I've been seeing a fantastic memory therapist.  She's taught me some mental exercises that have helped me to remember all the important things in life."
> 
> The bartender says, "That's great!  What's the therapist's name?"
> 
> The elderly gentleman looks confused before snapping his fingers, "What's that flower?  The red one with thorns on its stem?"
> 
> The bartender answers, "A rose?"
> 
> "Yes, that's it," the older man smiles before turning to his wife, "Rose, what's the name of that therapist I've been seeing?"

> 
> A man walks into the bar. He has a seat, and the surly bartender stomps over and rudely asks the man what he wants. "Actually I don't want a drink", says the man. "I want to make a bet. I bet you fifty dollars I can lick my left eye." Confused, but knowing the improbability, the bartender says, "You're on!" The man proceeds to remove his glass eye and lick it. Angry but admitting defeat, the bartender pays him.
> 
> "I'd like to make another bet," says the man. "I bet $100 I can bite my right eye." Knowing he couldn't possibly have two glass eyes, and wanting to win his money back, the bartender agrees. The man takes out his false teeth, then uses them to bite the other eye. Now really angry, the bartender gives him $100. The man then leaves the bartender alone and walks around the bar chatting it up and drinking with the other patrons.
> 
> They all talk, drink, and share a huge laugh while the bartender stews about his lost money. The man staggers back and says, "Tell ya what, I'll bet you all the money I won, but DOUBLE, that I can pee in that shot glass from here without spilling a drop!" The bartender looks at the shot glass, which is a good 10 feet away, and knows for a FACT this cannot be done. He boldly replies, "Double? $300 and not a single drop outside the glass? You have a bet!"
> 
> The man positions himself on the bar, unzips, then begins to urinate. The urine goes all over the bar, the counter, even the bartender himself. The bartender laughs and says, "All right, you lost fair and square, now pay up!" Calmly, the man pulls out $300 and hands it to the bartender. He goes around the bar talking to the patrons again, and comes back looking joyful. The bartender asks, "Why are YOU so happy? You just lost $300!"
> 
> "Because I bet everyone else here $100 each that I could piss all over your bar, on your counter, even on you, and you wouldn't get mad."
> 
> **Notes:** //Next time something like this happens I'm intervening.// Agent ██████
> **Notes:** //Go for it. Better they piss on you than me.// -Agent █████

> 
> A Monkey, a Vampire, and a dozen soldiers walk into a bar. The monkey says, "What is this, some kind of joke?"
> 
> **Notes:** //I don't get it.// -Agent █████
> **Notes:**  //Dr. Bright is no longer allowed to --request the use of [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-076 SCP-076-2] or Mobile Task Force Omega-7 for testing-- test SCP-333-J under any circumstances.

> 
> A man walks into the bar and pulls from his jacket a tiny man and an equally tiny piano. The tiny man plays the piano perfectly, to the amusement of the crowd. The bartender asks the man how he got him.
> 
> The man shows the bartender a magic lamp and offers to sell it for one hundred dollars to which the bartender agrees. A genie appears from the lamp and offers one wish. The bartender asks for "a million bucks".
> 
> Moments later, the entire bar is filled with an insane number of ducks. After the bar is evacuated, the bartender tells the man, "Dammit, I asked for a million bucks! Not ducks! Bucks!"
> 
> The man says, "Tell me about it. Do you really think I asked for a twelve inch pianist?"
> 
> **Notes:** //Damn right. What am I supposed to do with this room full of gorgeous snowmen?// -Agent █████
> **Notes:** //The location of both lamp and genie after destruction of the megaflock could not be determined. Provisional designation SCP-███ has been made, pending retrieval.//

> 
> A priest, a rabbi, and a humpback whale walk into the bar. After a few minutes, they've got the bartender's attention and are ready to get their drinks. The bartender asks them, "What'll you have?"
> 
> The priest says, "Well, I've accepted Jesus Christ as my lord and savior, so I'll have some sacramental wine."
> 
> The bartender serves him his drink and then looks to the rabbi and asks him what he'll have.
> 
> "Well," the rabbi orders, "I believe that our messiah has not yet comes, so I'd like a glass of your finest manischewitz."
> 
> The bartender nods and then, finally, looks at the humpback whale. "And what about you, big guy?" he asks with a friendly smile.
> 
> And the whale says, //"OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO~!"//
> 
> **Notes:** //So I served him Seagram's.// -Agent █████
> **Notes:** //In retrospect, we should have noticed something was up as soon as a whale walked into the bar.// Agent ███████

> **Notes:** //We've sure lowered the bar around here.// -Agent █████

> 
> Two men are drinking at the bar on the top floor of a tall building. The first man says to the second, "I bet you one hundred dollars I can jump out the window on this floor and get sucked into the open window on the next floor below."
>  
> The second man agrees, and they go over to the window. The first man jumps out the window, and amazingly, he is swiftly pulled into the open window of the floor below. He returns up the stairs to the bar and smugly asks for his money. The second man refuses, claiming that there is some sort of trick involved. He jumps out the window, crashing fatally to the asphalt several stories down. 
> 
> The bartender turns to the first man, shaking his head, and says, "Superman, you're an asshole when you drink."
>
> **Notes:** //The first man in the incident is being tracked and observed to determine what other anomalous abilities he may possess. Plans and a mobile task force are being assembled for his capture, protocols and classification level to be determined by abilities displayed during containment proceedings, current SCP designation SCP-███.// -Agent ██████
