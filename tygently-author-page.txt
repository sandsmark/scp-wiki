**Name:** Dr. Ty███ S. Gently

**Security Clearance:** Level 3

**Position:** Researcher, Department of Memetics and Cognitohazards

**Current Location:** Mail Room, Site-77

**History:** Dr. Gently was recruited by the Foundation following the ██████ University incident, of which they were the only survivor (Gently cites "not looking at the dreadlords, seriously, did anyone else see raiders of the lost ark?" as the primary reason for their survival). Deemed a possible asset to the Foundation, Gently received an education in memetics and cognitohazards. They are, by definition, unable to comprehend or process this education in any way except through recurring nightmares.
