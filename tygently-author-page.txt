**Name:** Dr. Ty███ S. Gently

**Security Clearance:** Level 3

**Position:** Researcher, Department of Memetics and Cognitohazards

**Current Location:** Mail Room, Site-77

**History:** Dr. Gently was recruited by the Foundation following the ██████ University incident, of which they were the only survivor (Gently cites "not looking at the dreadlords, seriously, did anyone else see raiders of the lost ark?" as the primary reason for their survival). Deemed a possible asset to the Foundation, Gently received an education in memetics and cognitohazards. They are, by definition, unable to comprehend or process this education in any way except through recurring nightmares.

**[[[SCP-644]]]:** Mr. Hot
> **SCP-644:** And I'd say that to him, and he'd say to me "Hot, you have quite the melon on your shoulders" and I'd say "Wow, thanks, boss" and then he'd put a miniature melon on my shoulder and we'd both laugh. It's our little joke, see?

**[[[SCP-2524]]]:** No Strings
> When a living human being's shadow is cast by SCP-2524's flame, the shadow appears as if the human subject casting the shadow were instead a life-sized marionette puppet resembling the subject in size and build.

**[[[Loss and Nostalgia]]]**
> She was only partially whole, of course, having long shed the modifications that marred her face during her time in 'captivity'. Her left eye was glass but it may as well have been a window.

**[[[Under Control]]]**

**[[[A History of Reaction]]]**
> The woman told the task force something that they were later unable or unwilling to recall. When she finished, the task force began to vomit live, non-venomous snakes.

**[[[What's The Deal?]]]**
> "Mr. Seinfeld, even with your magic powers, there's no way you could beat Tim Allen in a fight."

**[[[Clash of the Cosmic Comedians]]]**
> "Prepare to die, Seinfeld." Tim Allen closed his eyes as countless rocket pods sprouted from his back like wings. "To infinity…" he yelled, "and //BEYOND//!"

**[[[Death Perception]]]**
> “In my books, the medium rubs the ball and coaxes the ghost out. If we gently cradle the orb, the ghost might appear. Like a ghost egg.”
