]]

**Name:** Dr. Ty███ S. Gently

**Security Clearance:** Level 3

**Position:** Researcher, Department of Memetics and Cognitohazards

**Current Location:** Mail Room, Site-77

**History:** Dr. Gently was recruited by the Foundation following the ██████ University incident, of which he was the only survivor (Gently cites "not looking at the dreadlords, seriously, did anyone else see raiders of the lost ark?" as the primary reason for his survival). Deemed a possible asset to the Foundation, Gently received an education in memetics and cognitohazards. He is, by definition, unable to comprehend or process this education in any way except through recurring nightmares.

Hi, I'm TyGently (pronounced "tie-gently"). I've been a part of this community since late 2014 and writing articles since spring 2015. I'm male and Canadian, and can typically be found in the SCP IRC channel #site19 or #site17. I'm generally willing to critique article drafts whenever I can, tale drafts somewhat less so because I have less experience with tales.

**Currently working on:** Two tale drafts, both for [http://www.scp-wiki.net/third-law-hub Third Law].

**Author Commentary:**
[[collapsible show="+ SCP-2330 - A Convincing Whiteboard" hide="- SCP-2330 - A Convincing Whiteboard"]]
**Summary:** A whiteboard that forces you to believe whatever's written on it.

**Commentary:** My first article, I think it's a decent effort, albeit one with many flaws. It goes on way too long, and while I was originally proud of thinking the thing through so well, I later came to the realization that it's to the detriment of the narrative. The ending is too much infodump, as well, and isn't written very well. Someday I'd like to rewrite this, make it deserve the rating it has. It should also be mentioned: without the extensive help of reddit and wikidot user Aurabek, this //never// would've gotten off the ground, and I most likely never would've continues writing for the wiki. So thanks for that, dude.

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-2660 - An object that removes darkness" hide="- SCP-2660 - An object that removes darkness"]]
**Summary:** A lamp that is simply unforgettable.

**Commentary:** I liked this one a lot more than my first one. This is perhaps the most complex base concept I've ever written in an article, and I tried my best to fill the article with subtext, hidden implications, and fridge horror. It is also my opinion that this is the most dangerous object I've written about, and should be Keter. This article was the best example of a theme I liked to write about: objects that test the Foundation's abilities to its limits. This one seems innocuous, but in a broad sense it's the antithesis to the misinformation the Foundation uses as a weapon, and there is essentially no way to counter it. And with the implication of what a human observer can do when they study it for long enough... they better hope they can keep this one locked up.

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-2548 - The Friendly Vacuum" hide="- SCP-2548 - The Friendly Vacuum"]]
**Summary:** Something odd's going on between Uranus and Neptune.

**Commentary:** My highest rated article (as of this writing), this was essentially my first foray into a format I'd use extensively in articles following it: a short description, followed by oodles of addenda that tell the //real// story. This draft sat unfinished for a long time, mostly because I struggled to depict something that was both relatable and truly alien. I think I struck true with some interesting implications, my favorite of which being that, when a massive, immortal, omnipotent-within-itself god-creature searches an earthling's memories for things that are similar to itself, it decides that the Foundation is the perfect match.

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-2985 - Anart, Author of The Scream" hide="- SCP-2985 - Anart, Author of The Scream"]]
**Summary:** Anomalously good forgeries, and an oral history of an event the Foundation would rather redact.

**Commentary:** This may be my favorite thing I've written, or it may be tied with SCP-2548. Inspired by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Menard,_Author_of_the_Quixote Borges' short story of a similar name] and spurred by [http://www.scp-wiki.net/metacritique-two Kalinin's fantastic essay on the depiction of anomalous artwork], this article is basically an extended discussion of artistic influence, inspiration, and ownership, set among a situation of vague tensions and rising violence. This was also my first foray into trying to consistently characterize someone, and make an interesting story from their characterization and little else, at which I think I did pretty well. If I could pick a gripe, it'd be that I didn't make the implications of what happened after or during the event quite as clear as they maybe should've been.

[[collapsible show="+ Loss and Nostalgia" hide="- Loss and Nostalgia"]]
**Summary:** Three mini-tales about how SCP-2548, POI-2985, and a disgraced Foundation doctor deal with loss and change.

**Commentary:** This was something I'd wanted to write for a while. The first section was inspired by a reddit post on one of my drafts of 2548, which posits that the vacuum might... take some initiative, to put it lightly. I liked the idea, but felt it didn't mesh with the article I was trying to make, so I decided to put it in here, not as an official "this totally happened after" but as "here's something that could've happened". 

The middle tale was perhaps the thing that motivated me to write the whole thing: continuing the story of Adrian Baudin as he deals with his art being stolen and his preferred way of life being up-heaved. I also got to slide in a bunch of easter eggs regarding the group who ever-so-graciously host him, The Cool Kids, and indicate some more about their purposely-ill-defined purpose. I definitely want to return to this story somewhere down the line.

The final tale was meant to deal with some of the implications of the ending of SCP-2660. It ends with dozens of people getting locked up, and the Foundation just throwing away the key. So what happened to them? I thought this was a question worth answering, in some capacity.

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-644 - Mr. Hot" hide="- SCP-644 - Mr. Hot"]]
**Summary:** A Little Mister with a special place in Doctor Wondertainment's heart.

**Commentary:** My contribution to a longstanding site tradition, Mr. Hot was something I got //really// into while I was writing it. Part of my process for this one was just to pace around my room, talking to myself until I said something funny. Then, I'd write it down and try to include it when I started writing the interview logs. Interestingly, pretty much all the dialogue is the same in the final copy as it was in the first draft. It all flowed rather naturally from my head to the page, and I feel that shows in the cohesiveness of the dialogue. While not everything I wanted to include about the backstory of Wondertainment and Mr. Hot got in, I'm quite happy with how it turned out.

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-2524 - No Strings" hide="- SCP-2524 - No Strings"]]
**Summary:** A candle that casts odd shadows.

**Commentary:** Not too much too say about this one. It was an idea I had for a while, and I wanted to try a format that focused more on implicit storytelling than explicit storytelling through addenda or interviews. I think it went quite well, and I'd definitely consider writing something in the future in the same "classic scp" format.
