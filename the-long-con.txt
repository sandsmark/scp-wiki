Two old men sat at a dinner table, directly across from each other. Above, an old glass chandelier hangs, ornamented with beautiful lights. On the north wall stands an impossibly large portrait of the same two men – shaking hands and smiling, their once jet black hair now dull gray. 

There's the sound of cutlery moving about, of cups being lifted and then replaced. 

“Keats,” one says. 

“Hm?”

“We need to stop.”

“Oh? Oh! I agree completely, the Oracle stock is played out and useless to us now. We should look to invest in clean -”

“Not stocks, Keats.”

Both men put their cutlery down in unison and look at each other. They've been friends for so long that neither manages to muster up one hundred percent of the steel possible in their gaze. 

“What are you talking about, Bill? I have to say, your train of thought is sometimes too fast for me to catch.”

“You know exactly what I'm talking about.”

“I'm afraid I don't.”

“I guess I have to spell it out for you, then.”

“I suppose.”

And here the first speaker -Old Wild Bill, if that matters- looks genuinely angry. He almost stands, thinks better of it, and stops himself. Silence hangs about the room like a condemned man. 

“You...this, Keats.” He spreads his arms out around him in exasperation, showing off their grand surroundings. Indeed, the room seems better suited for the upper class streets of London, Washington, Tokyo, or Moscow. Who'd believe it was buried meters deep in Australian dirt? Who'd believe above these men's heads was a statue that would kill you, an immortal lizard, and perhaps worst of all, something red? Who'd believe that below them, even deeper still, was a nuclear warhead with a 20 megaton yield? 

As it turns out, quite a lot of people. 

“Are you unsatisfied with the Retreat Room, Bill?”

“Listen to me, you little shit.” Bill had taken this tone with the other man only a handful of times in their long, long acquittance, and it slaps Keats awake.

“This whole stupid idea of yours needs to end, Keats. It was an interesting idea at first – exciting at times, I admit. And I would be fool to deny I did not enjoy the money.” He puts his hands to his head and stares at the other man through his fingers. An accent, long forgotten and exotic, starts to creep into his voice.  “Do you remember the first time we met,  Keats? The day you rode into my camp on a fine black horse, obviously brought from England? Do you remember my tribe welcoming you, giving you our richest tobacco, and treating you for those brief days like a king? I saw you then, and I saw that your greed for that life had already poisoned your heart, even before we showed you the relic. I should have killed you then and there. But no – I calmed myself, told myself it was tradition. I showed you that damn relic, led you out into the wild, showed you that FUCKING...FACTORY!”

Bill is standing now, his tanned leather hands on the table. He's positively livid. Keats, too, has regained much of his composure, and sits impassively, waiting for the other man to finish. 

“Have you nothing to say for yourself, Keats?!”

“I'm waiting for you to finish this tired little tirade. Or would you rather me continue this story?  
Should I recount the tale of how the metal in your backwards little tribe's sacred 'relic' responded to my touch? Or should I yell loudly about what we found there?”

“Shut up, Keats! You...lied to me, tricked me -”

“I did nothing of the sort. I simply told you what we could do with all those lovely things and creatures. Your people did not have a word for it at the time, but mine did – extortion, Bill. Blackmail. I realized then, how much people would pay to stay safe. Stay safe from me. I offered you a piece of that. And you gave in, did you not? I have been nothing but honest with you. You have grown angry in your old age, Wild Bill.” The last two words are spat with all the smugness of the serpent in Eden.

“Old age? We are crimes against the heavens, Keats. Do you know how old I am today, you old snake? Two hundred and ten. Ever since I drank your damn water -”

“Ah, the Fountain of Youth. Not my most graceful or original creation, but it works.”

Bill's rage was growing. He just looked at the other man and gritted his teeth.  Keats noted this and grinned. 

“And who would you tell about this grand conspiracy theory, Bill? Your lackeys? What were their names again? Don't look so confused; surely you know of whom I speak. After all, you hand crafted them. Beat their meat and flesh into shape with my Factory. Ah, now I remember -

“Shut up, Keats.”

“- Alto and Jack, right? Wasn't there another? The first one? The one you broke? He looked somewhat like your dead son...what was it's name...ah, right. Gears.”

“You'll shut up now, Keats.”

“Or what, Wild Bill? Will you kill me?”

“Yes.”

“Big words from an old Indian. Excuse me, Native American.”

“You piece of shit -”

Keats had been thumbing the action on his gun since Bill had begun speaking. Two shots rang out, and Wild Bill suddenly found he no longer had knees. There was a scream, and Keats stood, wiping at his mouth with a napkin. In his other hand was a smoking matte-black revolver. 

“And history repeats, it seems. The noble English have once again prevailed against our savage foes. ” He presses an intercom button built into the table, and a quiet speaker crackles to life.

“Yes, Mr. One?” An extremely chipper female voice echos throughout the room.

“Mrs. Escot? Which Sites are Alto Clef and Jack Bright currently stationed at?”

“One minute please, sir.” Keyboard taps. “Dr. Clef is stationed at Site 19 sir, but he is currently visiting Dr. Bright at Site 23.”

“Ahhh, 23. The renegades. How convenient; three birds with a single stone. Mrs. Escot, please arrange for SCP-173 and one of our cloning devices to be transferred to Site 23. Once they are inside, please remotely seal the exits and arrange for the two to interact. You have my permission to use our sleeper agents.”

“Yes, sir! Sir, shall I detonate Site 23's nuclear warhead afterward?”

“Hmmm...no, but please ensure that the Site's entrance is buried. And see to it that a cleaning crew is set down to the Retreat Room. Tell them to bring mops.”

“Yes  sir! Thank you, sir!” Click. The speaker turns off. 

Wild Bill lays on the floor, bleeding and barely holding onto to consciousness. Keats walks over and stands over him, the gun still in his hand. 

“Any pithy last words, Bill?”

Bill's left hand weakly extends a middle finger.

“How predictable.” There is a single crack, and the world's second oldest man dies. 

Keats looks at the broken body of his only friend, shrugs, and pockets the gun. He removes a cigarette and a lighter from his breast pocket, and lights up. The smell of tobacco mixes with the smell of gun smoke, and for a brief second, William Keats, pride of his father and light in his mother's eyes, feels a deep sense of nostalgia and accomplishment. 

“You ran a good con. Happy birthday, Bill.”

He throws the lit cigarette unto the other man's body and leaves the room. 

Ten minutes later, a crew in orange jumpsuits with mops enters the same room, and wordlessly cleans up the body. Thirty minutes later, every single man and woman in Site 23 is trying not to blink. An hour later, and Keats is sitting across from the President of the United States and calmly informing him how easily SCP-682 could be transported into Washington.

The next day, a large amount of funds are transferred into the Foundation's coffers. 

Ignoring death and tragedy, the con, and the Foundation, goes on.
