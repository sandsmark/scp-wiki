**Item #:** SCP-305

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** 
SCP-305 is contained at its present location, a wooded canyon near ██████, ███████, in the Balkans. The nature of SCP-305 precludes extraction to a secured Site, requiring the construction of Station-317 to house a security contingent, support staff, and no fewer than seven personnel certified by prior contact with the entity. Personnel who have been certified should be rotated to other facilities on a monthly basis if possible for psychological recovery and evaluation.

Station-317’s communications room is to be constructed as a soundproof panic room and equipped with a two-way communications hotline to Site 19. This room should contain one (1) standard-issue sidearm, one (1) jar of stimulants, and sufficient air and food supplies to last for at least one week, along with one (1) standard-issue cyanide pill. In the event of a containment breach, Station-317 is to trigger a localized electromagnetic pulse to destroy any nearby external communications devices. In the event that SCP-305 or SCP-305-1 obtains access to Station-317's communication device, Site 19 is to undergo communications blackout until neutralization or successful recapture.

In the event of a containment breach or radio silence exceeding four hours, heavily armed containment teams are to be dispatched to Station-317. Personnel are to carry holy symbols consistent with the individual’s religious creed or a symbol of personal inspiration or dedication applicable to their beliefs. 

Barring specific instructions to the contrary, instances of SCP-305-1 are to be terminated on sight. No capture attempts are to be made without O5 approval. In the event of a direct SCP-305 containment breach, [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Description:** SCP-305 is a humanoid entity exhibiting gross anatomical irregularities approximately two and a half meters tall. Its facial features, while reported by staff as aesthetically appealing, are blurry and soft. SCP-305’s coloration alternates between a pearly sheen and papery off-white. Its epidermis is splintered by large, jagged cracks emitting intense waves of Cherenkov radiation. Tissue samples quickly decay into powdered, irradiated sodium chloride. SCP-305 displays a serious aversion to loud human voices. 

SCP-305 displays intermingled and contrasting secondary sexual traits of both sexes, but no bodily orifices beyond the mouth and eyes. Even deaf subjects have reported hearing SCP-305, and its lip movements do not match its speech. SCP-305 appears to use more than one voice at a time, often saying multiple things simultaneously. All other noise in SCP-305's presence seems muffled and hollow. Observers always describe the entity’s voice as familiar, friendly, and trustworthy. Observed behavioral tendencies suggest it is erratic, nihilistic, enjoys inflicting both physical and emotional pain, and appears to enjoy deceiving and manipulating others.

Upon coming into contact with any sapient individual, SCP-305 will attempt to ingratiate itself with the subject, displaying detailed knowledge of the subject’s personal history and self-esteem. Over time SCP-305 will subtly attempt to demoralize and destroy a subject’s self-image, though in an apparently kindly fashion. Subjects have displayed extraordinary susceptibility to SCP-305’s arguments, even if on latter examination they often exhibit serious logical fallacies or unfair judgments. Shouting and screams appear to disrupt SCP-305’s influence, as do sources of personal inspiration and reassurance. Personnel exposed to SCP-305 have described feelings of inadequacy, loneliness, and serious hallucinations including [REDACTED].

Subjects succumbing to SCP-305's influence exhibit evidence of severe psychological and physical trauma, including malnourishment, discoloration, and bleeding from the eyes, nose, and mouth. These symptoms gradually worsen over time, usually ending in death after a period between ten minutes to an hour. One in five afflicted victims seem to recover with appropriate medical treatment, but often suffer from suicidal depression and require psychiatric care. Ideally, Class A Amnesiacs should be used to remove the memories of the encounter.

**SCP-305-1**
Upon the expiration of a victim of SCP-305’s mental assault, an instance of SCP-305-1 will come into existence. Instances of SCP-305-1 vary in appearance, although their physical form is usually a hybrid between SCP-305 and the subject’s original appearance. They appear to possess similar, if inferior, capabilities to SCP-305 itself. No instances of SCP-305-1 have been safely contained without termination; Station-317’s staff is to regularly sweep the surrounding mountains for any escaped SCP-305-1 specimens. It is believed this is SCP-305’s normal form of reproduction.

**Addendum 305a: Regulations on Personnel**
D-class Personnel are not to be exposed to SCP-305 except in experiments approved by no fewer than █ O5 personnel, in writing. Any proposal to introduce new personnel must also be approved by Station-317’s commanding officer and chief researcher, with full-scale preparation for a possible containment breach.

Under no circumstances are assigned pursuit units of SCP-305 or SCP-305-1 to be accompanied by D-Class personnel. Individuals with a past history of severe personal guilt or unresolved emotional trauma should not be assigned to SCP-305 for research, staff, or pursuit without support.

**Addendum 305b:**
SCP-305 is most likely to cooperate with personnel previously exposed to it, and has been very forthcoming in interviews with Dr. ██████ about its supposed exploits and knowledge. However, given its behavior, any statements from SCP-305 regarding its history, nature, or relationship to other contained items must be independently verified. It is most likely that SCP-305 is learning of other SCPs from its interviews with personnel, and claiming a relationship after the fact to distort studies into its nature.

**Addendum 305c:**
After the containment breach in [REDACTED] on  █-██-████, no original recordings of interviews with SCP-305 are to be allowed contact with any personnel not already certified for contact with SCP-305. Original tapes are to be copied twice and then destroyed with directed electromagnetic pulse followed by incineration.

SCP-305 was uncooperative with interviewers for several weeks afterwards and continues to gloat and mock Foundation personnel about the outbreak. This indicates it somehow shares awareness with SCP-305-1 entities.

**Addendum 305d:**
After the containment breach in [REDACTED] on █-██-████ any personnel previously exposed to SCP-305 complaining of night terrors, hallucinatory encounters with SCP-305 or SCP-305-1 entities, or [EXPUNGED] must attend mandatory counseling. This outbreak indicates that some victims of SCP-305 may delay exhibiting symptoms, and that Class A Amnesiacs may be ineffective in removing the memetic link between SCP-305 and its victims. Factors determining this variation remain unknown. Study continues.

SCP-305 was subjected to unauthorized punishment through the use of physical trauma and [DATA REDACTED]. The perpetrators have been reprimanded.
