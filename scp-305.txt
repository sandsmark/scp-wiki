**Item #:** SCP-305

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-305 is contained at its present location, a wooded canyon near ██████, ███████ in the Balkans. The nature of SCP-305 precludes extraction to a secured Site, requiring the construction of Station-317 to house a security contingent, support staff, and no fewer than seven personnel certified by prior contact with the entity. Personnel who have been certified should be rotated to other facilities on a monthly basis if possible for psychological recovery and evaluation.

All recordings of interviews with SCP-305 are to be copied twice before any personnel not certified are allowed access to them. The originals are to be destroyed immediately by directed electromagnetic pulse, followed by incineration.

Station-317’s commanding officer must remain in regular communications contact with a randomly-assigned Foundation Site, hereby deemed the Monitoring Facility, delivering situation reports every three hours. Monitoring Facilities are to be rotated monthly. Station-317's radio communications array is to be modified so that it may only communicate with this facility. Ideally, assigned communications officers at the Monitoring Fascility will be personally acquainted with Station-317's current commanding officer.

Station-317’s communications room is to be hermetically sealed during reports. It is to be constructed as a soundproof, windowless panic room containing one (1) standard-issue sidearm, one (1) jar of stimulants, and sufficient air and food supplies to last for at least one week, along with one (1) standard-issue cyanide pill. In the event of a containment breach Station-317 is to trigger a localized electromagnetic pulse to destroy any nearby external communications devices.

If radio silence from Station-317 exceeds four hours, or if the assigned communications monitors believe there is a possibility of compromised reporting personnel, the Monitoring Facility is to assume containment breach and dispatch containment personnel to Station-317. Dispatched personnel are to be heavily armed and carrying holy symbols consistent with the individual’s religious creed or a symbol of personal inspiration or dedication applicable to their beliefs. In the event that SCP-305 or SCP-305-1 obtains access to Station-317's communication device, all communications from the Monitoring Facility must cease until Station-317 is neutralized.

Barring specific instructions to the contrary from 05-level personnel, instances of SCP-305-1 are to be terminated on sight. No capture attempts are to be made without O5 approval. In the event of a direct SCP-305 containment breach, [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Description:** SCP-305 is a humanoid entity exhibiting gross anatomical irregularities approximately two and a half meters tall. Its facial features, while reported by staff as aesthetically appealing, appear blurry and soft. SCP-305’s skin alternates between a pearly sheen and papery off-white, and has the apparent texture of stone. The surface is splintered with large, jagged cracks; these, alongside its eyes, emit intense pulsing waves of Cherenkov radiation. Other than voices, all sounds in its presence sound both muffled and hollow. Physical samples have revealed that it is composed primarily of inorganic materials in a crystalline lattice, notably exotic, highly radioactive isotopes of sodium and chlorine.

SCP-305 displays intermingled and contrasting secondary sexual traits of both sexes that seem to shift between visits. It possesses no bodily orifices beyond the mouth and eyes. Its speech is partially a psychic phenomenon; even deaf subjects have reported hearing SCP-305, and its lip movements do not match its speech. SCP-305 appears to use more than one voice at a time, often saying multiple things simultaneously. Observers always describe the entity’s voice as familiar, friendly, and trustworthy unless they have succumbed to its influence. SCP-305 has never been subjected to any IQ tests, but observed behavioral tendencies suggest it is erratic, nihilistic, enjoys inflicting both physical and emotional pain, and appears to enjoy seeding outright deceptions and lies.

SCP-305 is contained within a pocket of space-time seemingly out of sync with the rest of the observed universe. It does not appear capable of leaving at this time, a fact at which SCP-305 has displayed intense frustration. Visitors have described [DATA EXPUNGED] All travel within the pocket seemingly bends towards SCP-305’s location, meaning escape from the pocket without encountering SCP-305 is very difficult. Human subjects can typically remain safely in this pocket for up to 90-150 minutes. Individuals who have confronted SCP-305 will awaken where they entered the canyon unless [DATA EXPUNGED] 

SCP-305 exhibits consistent behavior and appears to somehow sustain itself with human contact. Upon coming into contact with any sapient individual, SCP-305 will attempt to ingratiate itself with the subject, displaying detailed knowledge of the subject’s personal history and self-esteem. Invariably, SCP-305 will subtly attempt to demoralize and destroy a subject’s self-image, though in an apparently kindly fashion. Subjects have reported SCP-305’s arguments seemed convincing: even if on latter examination they often exhibit serious logical fallacies or unfair judgments of circumstances. The speed in which it can inspire emotional breakdown in vulnerable subjects suggests a psychic component. Shouting and screams appear to disrupt SCP-305’s influence, as do sources of personal inspiration and reassurance. 

SCP-305 will rarely allow the conversation to turn to discussion of its own nature, but it appears to respect prior visitors and will be more cooperative in interviews. However, given its unstable and alien psyche, any statements from SCP-305 regarding its history nature, or relationship to other SCPs must be independently verified. It is most likely that SCP-305 is learning of other SCPs from its interviews with personnel, and claiming a relationship after the fact to increase its own mystique and confuse study of its nature.

If a subject succumbs to SCP-305’s psychological assault, they emerge from the temporal pocket containing SCP-305 exhibiting mental and physical trauma. Victims often complain SCP-305’s voice is somehow inside their head, urging them to act. Symptoms include [EXPUNGED]. Most victims rarely survive longer than several hours. They often display increasing mental instability and violent or suicidal tendencies. 

On multiple occasions, personnel have been forced to engage SCP-305 or instances of SCP-305-1 in direct combat. Defeating SCP-305 will safely eject a visitor from the temporal pocket in which it has been imprisoned, but is to be reserved for a last resort. Its physical capabilities appear to be at least partially based on the fears and insecurities of normal humans present and its degree of influence over them. Destruction of SCP-305 appears to have no long-term effects; the entity will be present in future visits and fully aware of past encounters (usually more amused than annoyed.) Fortunately, destroyed instances of SCP-305-1 show no signs of reanimation and their corpses can be analyzed for study.

**SCP-305-1**
Upon the apparent death of the contaminated subject, an instance of SCP-305-1 will come into existence. Instances of SCP-305-1 vary in appearance, although their physical form is usually a hybrid between SCP-305 and the subject’s original appearance. They appear to possess similar, if inferior, capabilities to SCP-305 itself. No instances of SCP-305-1 have been safely contained without termination; Station-317’s staff is to regularly sweep the surrounding mountains for any escaped SCP-305-1 specimens. It is believed this is SCP-305’s normal form of reproduction.

Instances of SCP-305-1 have been encountered on several occasions within SCP-305’s confinement.

**Addendum 305a: Regulations on Personnel**
D-class Personnel are not to be exposed to SCP-305 except in experiments approved by no fewer than █ O5 personnel, in writing. Any proposal to introduce new personnel must also be approved by Station-317’s commanding officer and chief researcher, with full-scale preparation for a possible containment breach.

Under no circumstances are assigned pursuit units of SCP-305 or SCP-305-1 to be accompanied by D-Class personnel. Individuals with a past history of severe personal guilt or unresolved emotional trauma should not be assigned to SCP-305.for research, staff, or pursuit without support.
