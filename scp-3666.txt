**Item #:** SCP-3666

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Each individual affected by SCP-3666 is to be confined within a standard humanoid cell. Several researchers are to study the immune system and DNA of affected individuals to further understanding of SCP-3666. Doctors are to analyze affected immune systems for potential health risks and damage.

--Alternative amnestic treatments are to be utilized-- Research is to be conducted to find or create new medicine with the capacity to alter memories.

**Description:** SCP-3666 is an allergic inflammatory reaction to the presence of amnestic proteins and substances within the bloodstream of affected individuals. Immune systems modified by SCP-3666 are unable to change or adapt to both normal anti-allergy treatments and those developed by the Foundation. As of now, no gene or allele has been correlated to the creation of SCP-3666 within the genome of affected individuals.

Currently, 147 individuals from Slav, Baltic, and Scandinavian origin have been diagnosed with SCP-3666. This corresponds to the total population of the former town of Ahni, Norway. The town did not exhibit any anomalous properties which could lead to the activation of SCP-3666 within unaffected or affected individuals. Since the arrival of Foundation forces, the town has been shut down.

Individuals affected by SCP-3666 show regular symptoms of digestion or skin related allergies when exposed to Class-B to Class-F amnestics which are ingested or inserted into the patient. Individuals affected by SCP-3666 show symptoms of respiratory related allergies to Class-A amnestics which are inhaled.

Affected immune systems effectively eliminate all amnestic substances while inside or before they can reach blood vessels within the brain. Due to this effect, all affected individuals are effectively impervious to the main effects and side-effects of all amnestic treatments. SCP-3666 is capable of adapting itself to protect the central nervous system from memetics and cognitohazards which target regions of the brain processing long-term and short-term memory.

**Discovery Log:** SCP-3666 was discovered following Incident-█████-O near Ahni, Norway. Foundation forces were quick to administer Class-A amnestics to residents exposed to the incident. Exposed residents did not forget the incident following the administration. All residents were found to possess the same SCP-3666 properties and were relocated to a nearby Foundation site for further examination.

**Item #:** SCP-3666 

**Object Class:** [[span style="color: blue"]]Keter[[/span]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** [[span style="color: blue"]]All border exits from and entrances to Norway are to be closed immediately. All Norwegian airlines are to be dissolved.[[/span]]

[[span style="color: blue"]]All phone lines, social media, and internet connections from and to Norway are to be cut off. A disinformation campaign led by the Foundation is to create and spread rumors of a lethal virulent pathogen in Norway on social media, television networks, and radio stations. All information found contradicting the campaign is to be removed.[[/span]]

[[span style="color: blue"]]All Foundation personnel stationed at Site-52 or who have come into contact with individuals affected by SCP-3666 are to remain in Norway. All personnel who have travelled to other countries after being stationed at Site-52 are to be traced and located and are to remain in their respective countries. These countries are to be locked down in a manner similar to that of Norway.[[/span]]

[[span style="color: blue"]]Foundation resources are to be invested or redirected to research into vaccines or cures for SCP-3666 infection. When or if a vaccine is found, the population of all non-lockdown countries is to be vaccinated. When or if a cure is found, the population of all lockdown countries is to be cured before SCP-3666 is capable of contaminating non-lockdown countries.[[/span]]

[[span style="color: blue"]]Foundation sites, areas, anomalies, and personnel which have not come into contact with SCP-3666 and are within lockdown countries are to be relocated to non-lockdown countries through Foundation forces. Foundation sites and areas which have come into contact with SCP-3666 are to become "independent" while receiving funding from the Foundation. "Independent" sites and areas are to never come into contact with non-lockdown countries or non-independent sites and areas.[[/span]]

[[span style="color: blue"]]The Foundation is to search for alternatives to standard amnestics and memory altering products. All information concerning SCP-3666 is restricted to Level 4 Clearance personnel and above. The disinformation campaign led by the Foundation is to also apply to Level 3 Clearance personnel and under.[[/span]]

Due to this effect, all affected individuals are effectively impervious to the main effects and side-effects of all amnestic treatments. SCP-3666 is capable of adapting and modifying the central nervous system to protect it from memetics and cognitohazards which target regions of the brain processing long-term and short-term memory. [[span style="color: blue"]]Alternative amnestics and memory altering products are completely ineffective at suppressing SCP-3666 in affected individuals. [[/span]]

[[span style="color: blue"]]SCP-3666 is capable of spreading from person to person through unknown means. Due to its rapid spread, the cause of SCP-3666 is hypothesized to be a virus or a meme. The virus or the meme would be unable to be detected by the host's immune system and would be successful at perturbing it to create the effects of SCP-3666. As of 04/09/2020, SCP-3666 contaminates the entire population of Norway.[[/span]]

**Item #:** SCP-3666

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** [[span style="color: blue"]]All countries are to integrate Procedure-065-Abschirmung. Procedure-065-Abschirmung ensures:[[/span]]

[[span style="color: blue"]]

* The removal of all border exits and entrances from and to other countries.

* The independence of all autonomous regions.

* The removal of all international communication lines. This includes all social media, phone connections, radio stations, e-mails, mail and television networks. All countries are to have an internet network isolated from other countries.

* Monthly analyzation of citizens by Foundation forces to detect the presence of SCP-3666.

* The relocation of unaffected sites, personnel, anomalies and areas from countries affected by SCP-3666 to unaffected countries.

* Worldwide effort to suppress and negate the effects of SCP-3666.

* The autonomy of all sites and areas affected by SCP-3666. Contact with affected sites and areas is to be cut off. Affected sites and areas are to still receive funding from the Foundation.[[/span]]

Information concerning SCP-3666 is restricted to Level 4 Clearance personnel and above. [[span style="color: blue"]]All analyzation of individuals affected is to be automatic and never manual. Personnel are to always stay 50 meters away from affected individuals.[[/span]]

**Description:** SCP-3666 is an allergic inflammatory reaction to the presence of amnestic proteins and substances within the bloodstream of affected individuals. Immune systems modified by SCP-3666 are unable to change or adapt to both normal anti-allergy treatments and those developed by the Foundation.

SCP-3666 is capable of adapting and modifying the central nervous system to protect it from memetics and cognitohazards which target regions of the brain processing long-term and short-term memory.

[[span style="color: blue"]]If an individual comes within a 30 meter area of an individual affected by SCP-3666, the healthy individual will be contaminated by SCP-3666. This area is expanding in size since its discovery. The growth of the area is not proportional to its time of growth, it is accelerating rapidly. No direct causes to SCP-3666 have been found. All attempts to reengineer immune systems to suppress SCP-3666 have failed. Immune systems of subjects have become stronger following these attempts.[[/span]]

[[span style="color: blue"]]SCP-3666 is capable of reconnecting memories to the central nervous system following its infection of amnesticized individuals with standard amnestics. Standard amnestics only "freeze" and isolate certain parts and memories of the brain to produce memory loss. SCP-3666 has recently been discovered to reverse the aforementioned amnestic treatment.[[/span]]

[[span style="color: blue"]]As of 01/01/2021, only nine areas remain unaffected by SCP-3666, these include:

* Greenland (Denmark)

* Canada

* Siberia (Russia)

* Iceland

* Svalbard (Norway) 

* French Polynesia (France)

* Antarctica

* Alaska (United States)

* Franz Josef Land (Russia)[[/span]]

> We have tried so many ways to cure SCP-3666, to find a way to stop its spread, but we failed each time. We have tried to connect it with some imperfections within the human DNA, but to no avail. We have blamed memes, viruses, and bacterias, but there were no scapegoats to burn. There is no cure, no vaccine, no gene or brain editing that can be made. There is only SCP-3666 and we are powerless against it.
> 
> Many of our SCPs cannot live within the conditions imposed by regions of the world which aren't affected by SCP-3666. With the exception of French Polynesia, they're desolate and cold environments. Another problem arises when sites centered around location-based anomalies are infected by SCP-3666.
> 
> We will find new ways to fight SCP-3666. The world is still not ready.

**Item #:** SCP-3666

**Object Class:** [[span style="color: blue"]]Gevurah[[/span]][[footnote]]SCP-3666 was reclassified as Gevurah by O5 Council vote due to its ability to influence the Foundation's inner structure and secondary objectives.[[/footnote]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** [[span style="color: blue"]]Procedure-065-Abschirmung successfully executed. The Foundation is to enter an emergency state. All methods to circumvent amnestic usage are to be utilized, such as:[[/span]]

[[span style="color: blue"]]

* Execution of personnel.

* Increases in deployment of Mobile Task Force Gamma-5 ("Red Herrings")

* Removal of all information found to be cognitohazardous or infohazardous or critical to the Foundation on radio stations, television, news papers, and social media.

* Installment of martial law within countries through puppet or shadow governments if necessary.

* Monthly reevaluation of containment procedures.

* Reevaluation of the Ethics Committee.[[/span]]

**Incident-A (12/01/2025):** Several Level 1-2 Clearance personnel were made aware of 27 controversial O5 Council documents due to a breach of information from the Foundation archives. All members of the former O5 Council were executed before Foundation forces were capable of overcoming the attack. Further methods to protect the O5 Council and critical files have put in place.

**Incident-B (09/01/2029):** The entirety of Site-87 and Area-45 were exposed to broadcasts of a Level 4-5 Clearance meeting from an unknown source. To avoid an attack similar to Incident-A, all personnel having viewed the broadcast were executed by a firing squad with the exception of Level 4-5 personnel. Executed personnel within Site-87 and Area-45 were replaced. The decision destabilized relations between higher and lower personnel following breaches of information of the event. Terminating lower personnel made aware of the event is still in question.

**Incident-C (05/05/2031):** The population of Turkey, France, Norway, and Australia were made aware of the Foundation's existence through several breaches of information on their respective internet networks. Aforementioned information was published by Dr █████, a Foundation insider who was later found and executed. All mentions of Dr █████'s reports were rapidly removed. The information was memetic in nature; informed individuals were unable to forget or believe that the information was false. Several counter-memes were initiated, all were unsuccessful at preventing destabilization of governments and government trust within the aforementioned countries. Sites, areas, and Foundation officials were relocated.

**Incident-D (07/09/2035):** The Ethics Committee was charged for several crimes of fraud, corruption, and high treason against the O5 Council and the Administrator. All of its members were executed. The Ethics Committee was reformed under stricter guidelines. All decisions concerning administrative laws or executive orders proposed by the Ethics Committee are to be reevaluated by the O5 Council and the Administrator. In order to replace roles maintained by the Ethics Committee, the Administrator was given supplementary and emergency powers within the council.
