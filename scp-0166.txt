**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the nature of SCP-166, all propositions regarding SCP-166 are to be reviewed by Drs. Gray and Frankenstein of the [[[SCP-4690|Pataphysics Department]]], including revision of containment procedures, personnel assignment, and interview proposals. The 'Pataphysics Department is then to file a report on the potential Romantic repercussions of such actions within three narrative days. Actions whose consequences include the release of SCP-166, the empowerment of SCP-166 or PoI-9522 ("Madam Brinegash")[[footnote]]Possibly [[[wwydftltimd-hub|Isabella ██████ ████████]]].[[/footnote]], or the decommissioning of Area-166 are to be avoided.

SCP-166 is to be kept in an unfurnished Type-2 Disposable humanoid containment unit in Area-166, to be checked daily for conceptual degradation. Thrice per day, SCP-166 is to be fed standard vegetarian rations. Each week, SCP-166 is to be moved to a new containment unit, with its previous unit recycled for parts.

USAZSD-Area-166 consists entirely of disposable buildings designed for ease of construction and demolition. No building is allowed to exist for more than a single year, and each is to be checked weekly for conceptual degradation. Food is to be imported from the Site-952 commissary located 29 km from Area-166, and may not be used to make meals with a total cost of more than $15, or recipes originating from 19th century America or Europe. Vegetation in Area-166 is to be routinely purged of abnormal floral growth.

Personnel assigned to SCP-166 are to be rotated monthly, and are not to spend more than 8 consecutive hours within 20 meters of SCP-166. Asexual and neurotypical personnel are strongly preferred for Area-166 assignments. Personnel are required to undergo a weekly psychiatric evaluation; compromised personnel are to be immediately transferred to a different project.

As of Incident 166-FC, female-attracted personnel are denied access to SCP-166.

**Description:** SCP-166 appears to be a Semitic female in her late 20s; however, SCP-166's body is non-baryonic in composition, and lacks much of the metabolic functions of ordinary humans.

SCP-166 is the focal point of an ontokinetic field that alters the properties and appearances of surrounding matter. Interviews with SCP-166 suggest that the purpose of this field is to forcibly emulate an environment similar to those of 19th-century Dark Romanticist ideals. Common motifs include Gothic architecture, poisonous flora, excess grime, and occult paraphernalia. Extended exposure can result in an environment rendered completely inhospitable for human habitation through a combination of hostile architecture and pollution.

Sapient beings who remain in the presence of SCP-166 risk developing increased appetite and libido, along with decreased levels of inhibition and empathy. These changes are permanent, and increase in severity the longer one remains in SCP-166's field. Despite this, affected individuals rarely attack SCP-166 of their own volition.

SCP-166's effects are not bound by a set distance; however, SCP-166's range appears to significantly increase in relation to the level of conversion and/or aesthetic compliance in its surroundings, as does the rate its changes take place.

[[/=]]

SCP-166 was previously [[[SCP-166|SCP-166-ARC]]], a Euclid-class anomaly contained at GBWLTB-Site-17. At the time of acquisition[[footnote]] 08/10/2008 [[/footnote]], SCP-166-ARC was approximately 13-years-old, raised in a cult compound belonging to a Catholic sect of the Serpent's Hand.

Although SCP-166-ARC's handling personnel were exclusively female[[footnote]] As per the nature of SCP-166-ARC's anomaly, which induced unusual levels of sexual aggression in male personnel. [[/footnote]], staffing shortages following Incident-818-B Clef-Kondraki resulted in the assignment of Dr. James Dantensen as head researcher of the SCP-166-ARC project, due to his experience working with juvenile anomalies such as [[[SCP-105|SCP-105]]], [[[SCP-1465|SCP-1465]]], and [[[SCP-818]]]. As such, Dr. Dantensen was forced to conduct his work through intermediaries.

On 19/05/2011, SCP-166-ARC's containment was briefly breached following an unrelated raid conducted by GoI-002 ("Court of the Unseelie Queen") targeting SCP-032-ARC.

Following the events of the breach, behavioral reports indicated an increasing level of recalcitrance from SCP-166-ARC, as well as increased observance of Roman Catholicism. Despite its anomalous sensitivity to pressure ulcers, SCP-166-ARC would frequently wrap itself in bed linens; handling personnel were eventually forced to remove all linens from SCP-166-ARC's containment cell for the sake of its health. Self-harm behaviors were infrequently observed by attending personnel, and subsequently dealt with.

Records indicate that SCP-166-ARC filed an ethics complaint against Dr. Dantensen on 05/08/2013, and again on 08/12/2013; however, the actual complaints appear to have been lost, although subsequent interviews with handling personnel suggest they related to its containment breach in 2011. No action appears to have been taken on the Foundation's part.

On 14/02/2014, SCP-166-ARC breached containment, directly injuring five and killing Dr. Dantensen.

And I know that's not something you can fix, cause again, I'm a threat to everyone around me and I really should be locked away. I will be saying a lot of things that contradict one another, and that's normal.

I am going to watch the walls of my cell, wearing clean clothes and snarling openly at the men who pass me by, and I am going to smile. I am right where I need to be, and so are you.
> 
> **Dr. Whateley:** How so?
> 
> **SCP-166:** I lost my identity to you. I lost dignity and peace of mind and faith in a caring god. And we've talked long enough that I feel like I'm getting it back. See you in Act 2.

[[/=]]

Prior to Incident 166-CL, SCP-166-ARC had been exceptionally compliant in its interactions with Foundation personnel, barring self-harm behaviors. Officially, security protocols remained in place; unofficially, observation of SCP-166-ARC was scaled back for budget concerns.

During Incident 166-CL, SCP-166-ARC displayed several then-unknown anomalous properties:
* Anomalously sharp fingernails.
* The capacity to steeply increase its body temperature without compromising bodily function.
* The ability to compel subjects of its primary anomalous ability to perform actions on its behalf through verbalized commands.[[footnote]] Possibly non-anomalous: SCP-166-ARC leveraged the possibility of romantic attention. [[/footnote]]

Following Incident 166-CL, SCP-166-ARC began actively resisting containment efforts. Revocation of privileges[[footnote]] Refer to [[[SCP-166|SCP-166-ARC]]], version history V.2014.1. [[/footnote]] was largely ineffective, as SCP-166-ARC appears to have disavowed Catholicism following the Incident. Self-harm behaviors, including the rejection of its dietary regimen, were observed to increase in frequency. 

At this point, SCP-166-ARC displayed open disdain for its handling personnel, refusing to comply with attempted interviews and experimentation. Attending physicians were frequently assaulted while attempting to carry out weekly medical evaluations. Remote observation was similarly sabotaged; observers were the target of exceedingly personal insults.

Containment procedures were updated to reflect SCP-166-ARC's escalated resistance, and its Threat Level was updated from ##green|Green## to ###ab9b33|Yellow##. Despite this, the SCP-166-ARC project reported higher than acceptable injuries and amnestic usage by the end of February 2014.

On 03/05/2014, a decision was made to transfer SCP-166-ARC to USNYHV-Area-16.

**INCIDENT 166-FC:** On 16/03/2023, Dr. Sophia Whateley was assigned to SCP-166. Dr. Whateley would later file a request of reassignment on 9/4/2023, citing a developing romantic interest in SCP-166.

Efforts were made to reassign Dr. Whateley to SCP-███ duty in Site-952; however, a series of probabilistic anomalies prevented Dr. Whateley from leaving Area-166, and further placed her into situations where she was forced to interact with SCP-166.

> 
> **SCP-166:** Took you long enough.
> 
> **SCP-166:** I don't know the science behind what I am, any more than you do. I just knew where I fit in. Adamism, spermophagy, temptation of man, lowercase "m", I was a trope. A fetish piece. An ornament of sexual fantasy. I had no say in that.

> **SCP-166:** Sorry. I had all this memorized, but actually being here... right. My existence was contrivance. At 7 I was twelve, at 13 I was thirteen, at 19 I was sixteen. I was still sixteen at 26. A lot of it made sense. I was a teenage succubus. More and less than real, the form of a teenage succubus.
> 
> **SCP-166:** My existence was suffering, literally. The role I played required it. Life fine-tuned to maximize my misery. Don't touch me. If I was any less patient I'd rip your fucking fingers off. You're culpable, you and everyone else. You cared more about sitting me still than fixing me.
> 
> **Dr. Whateley:** You shouldn't say that about yourself. "Broken" isn't-
> 
> **SCP-166:** You're not even listening, are you? I was looking for compassion about 10 years ago. I was looking for people who would take my story seriously, pity the little faggot dumped from the Gospel of Eve into the Gospel of Peter. Back to Eve.
> 
> //(Both remain silent for 57 seconds. Faint sounds of weeping can be heard.)//
> 
> **Dr. Whateley:** Again, I'm sorry.
> 
> //(6 second silence. SCP-166 takes several deep breaths)//
> 
> **SCP-166:** ... I had some other goon come by, for an interview. Halfway through, he pulls a bouquet out of a bag and asks me to run away with him to The Library. I laughed in his face and told him to kill himself. Did they get that on tape?
> 
> //(17 second silence)//
> 
> **SCP-166:** There are //many// ways to depict a "young succubus". Really, I just changed my genre, one where I don't get leered at like a piece of meat. Where nobody gets to hurt me ever again.

> 
> **SCP-166:** So they //did// get that. Did they get the part where he cried?
> 
> **Dr. Whateley:** I'm afraid I'm not... listen. I'm sorry for what you went through, but I assure you, I just want to help. I don't want to see you in pain, it's distressing. But, I need you to work with me for that to happen. Alright?

As a smaller facility intended for high-threat sapient anomalies, Area-16 was considered a more effective environment for the SCP-166-ARC project. In addition to the heightened security measures afforded, a majority of Area-16's anomalies lacked a human or human-adjacent memeplex, reducing the chance of cross-contamination during a breach.

SCP-166-ARC initially maintained its previous level of resistance; however, a combination of malnutrition and cellulitis[[footnote]] [REDACTED PENDING DECLASSIFICATION OF A16ECR-018] [[/footnote]] dramatically reduced assaults.

In the days preceding Incident 166-DF-Nobody, SCP-166-ARC had been successfully pacified to pre-Incident 166-CL levels.

++ MEMORANDUM ON AREA-166'S CURRENT CONDITION

{{Following a thorough audit of USAZSD-Area-166 and its associated SCP project, Foundation Overwatch has come to the following conclusion:}}
* {{SCP-166's anomaly has extended beyond the acceptable parameters of containment, necessitating the use of counterconceptual measures.}}
* {{Our current understanding of SCP-166's anomaly is incomplete; as such, SCP-166's containment procedures are insufficient.}}
* {{Until containment can be reestablished, the expansion of the SCP-166 project beyond recontainment presents an unacceptable risk to potential personnel.}}
* {{Personnel that have spoken with SCP-166 for more than five cumulative minutes may be ontologically compromised.}}

{{We apologize for the inconvenience.}}

On 09/01/2019, PoI-000 ("Nobody") was observed to have entered Area-16, using the stolen credentials of Dr. Alto Clef. PoI-000 proceeded towards SCP-166-ARC's containment, which they proceeded to breach. Following a short conversation[[footnote]] The contents of which are unknown, due to PoI-000's anomalous properties. [[/footnote]], PoI-000 disappeared, and SCP-166-ARC exited containment.

The full extent of SCP-166-ARC's actions following its release is unknown; shortly after it breached containment, SCP-166-ARC assisted in the release of several entities carrying the DC001-A and DC4947 ontohazards, rendering security footage unusable. Witness testimony is similarly unreliable, given the nature of several anomalies involved.

Mobile Task Forces Epsilon-11 ("Needle in a Hay Field") and Theta-3 ("Black Volga") were initially deployed to retrieve SCP-166-ARC, under the assumption that its anomalous effects would quickly attract civilian attention. Following six months of continuous search, both MTFs were recalled, and the SCP-166-ARC project was officially archived.

On 07/03/2022, SCP-166-ARC entered Spicy Crust Pizza on Staten Island, and willingly turned itself into Foundation custody. SCP-166-ARC was otherwise unresponsive to questioning, and efforts were made to transport it to USNVBR-Site-56 for recontainment.

Following Incident 166-DI on 16/03/2022, transport was forced to establish impromptu containment in the Sonoran Desert, the site of which was designated Area-166.
