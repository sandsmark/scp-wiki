+ So, what is the Art Exchange?
The Art Exchange is a chance for artists and authors on the wiki to give and receive awesome gifts during the Christmas/holiday season. Participants indicate what general sorts of gifts they can give, such as illustrations, tales, readings, or poems, and what sorts of gifts they want to receive. This can be anything as generic as "something relating to my stuff" or as specific as "a science fiction tale involving a wax apple and SCP-106."

People are then assigned a someone to create something for, Secret Santa-style. They then turn in their gifts and receive their own gifts in turn, just before Christmas. After a few days, the organizer reveals who made everyone their gift.

+ Why is the Art Exchange awesome?
First of all, members of the community, old and new, get together to give one another awesome gifts, which is cool in and of itself. Second, people frequently go all out; we've had ambient albums, fully-fledged RPG splatbooks, and videogames, all made to fit another user's wishes for the holiday. Third, some of the things that people write end up on the site, adding to the awesome richness and rich awesomeness of the site in general.

+ What's this page for?
To keep track of things people have posted to the site from previous exchanges. Also, to provide an easy way to find previous exchanges. In addition to all of the work that has been posted to the site, there has been tons of amazing art, music, writing, and reading that has been made that ultimately wasn't posted for one reason or another. So check out the threads as well as the articles linked below. And if you create an article based on something you gave for one of the exchanges, feel free to add yourself and tag the article "//[http://www.scp-wiki.net/system:page-tags/tag/art-exchange#pages art-exchange]//."
