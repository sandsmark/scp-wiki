**Item #:** SCP-2135

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** As SCP-2135 is located in a highly trafficked area, isolated containment of SCP-2135 is not feasible at this time. Instead, Foundation agents will work with the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to prevent unauthorized access to SCP-2135 by civillians. SCP-2135 is currently closed to the public and inaccessible by conventional means; as such, this is considered to be a reasonable request that does not require excessive coercion on the part of the Foundation. The interior of SCP-2135 is to be monitored via closed-circuit camera, but as it is plainly visible to civilians travelling within the New York City Subway system, Foundation personnel are discouraged from directly guarding SCP-2135's interior.

Any incursions into SCP-2135-B are to be conducted by D-Class Personnel under the supervision of Foundation researchers; direct incursion into SCP-2135-B by researchers requires the approval of the current Region 38A (New York City/Long Island) Director. D-Class Personnel entering SCP-2135-B must adhere to the following restrictions: 

* No items manufactured after February 1959 (including clothing, recording equipment, entertainment media, etc) may be taken into SCP-2135-B. 
* When interacting with instances of SCP-2135-C, personnel must avoid using words or phrases that were not commonly used prior to 1959 (e.g. "hippie," "wicked," etc). 
* No more than 24 hours may be spent inside of SCP-2135-B. 

**Description:** SCP-2135 is the former 91st Street Station, a station of the New York City Subway system located in Manhattan. Prior to its closure in February 1959, SCP-2135 was served by the 1 and 2 trains of the IRT Broadway - Seventh Avenue Line, bounded by the 96th Street Station to the north and the 86th Street Station to the south. SCP-2135 was closed after platform expansion on the 96th Street Station rendered it impractical to continue servicing it. 

SCP-2135's anomalous properties manifest twice a week, at unpredictable intervals. During this time, a train  car (which varies by make and model, but is always a car that was in use by the New York City Subway system during or prior to 1959), hereafter SCP-2135-A, will stop at the station for approximately fifteen seconds. SCP-2135-A is only perceivable to those standing on the subway platform at the time it arrives; non-anomalous trains in service will pass through it as if it were not there, and passengers on those trains are unable to perceive SCP-2135-A's presence as they pass through it. 

Should any subject board the train during this time, they will remain in a state of transit for approximately fifteen minutes, and will be unable to exit the train. No other passengers are present onboard the train, nor is a conductor. After fifteen minutes have elapsed, the train will come to a halt, and subjects will arrive within SCP-2135-B.

SCP-2135-B is a replica of the island of Manhattan as it appeared on 1 Feb 1959. Persons, events, and buildings present in Manhattan during this time are all replicated in a nearly identical fashion within SCP-2135-B, with the following exceptions:

* Persons present inside of Manhattan during this time are replaced by instances of SCP-2135-C (see below).
* All written material present inside of SCP-2135-B, including advertisements, books, newspapers, etc. consist solely of the words "SAFE WORLD" repeated over and over, in capital letters. The exception to this are the signs carried by SCP-2135-C. 
* Subway stations other than the 91st Street Station are inaccessible to all subjects. Instead, an instance of SCP-2135-C guards each subway station entrance, remaining still while holding a sign with the word "SECURITY" written on it. Subjects attempting to enter these stations will be forcefully impeded from doing so by the SCP-2135-C instance. 
* Any area beyond the island of Manhattan is rendered inaccessible by a white void surrounding the entire island. Subjects attempting to leave Manhattan will be blocked by an impermeable barrier. SCP-2135-C instances leaving Manhattan will appear to vanish into the void; likewise, SCP-2135-C instances entering Manhattan appear to spontaneously emerge from it. 
* Subjects universally report perceiving SCP-2135-B as monochromatic. 

SCP-2135-C are faceless humanoid entities that inhabit SCP-2135-B. SCP-2135-C instances lack eyes, noses, and mouths, but otherwise are replicas of people that were in Manhattan on 1 Feb 1959. All SCP-2135-C instances carry with them a blank white canvas board and a marker; if in a car or other vehicle, they will have one within close proximity of them. Despite their lack of facial features, SCP-2135-C instances appear capable of sight and scent, and can interact with subjects if prompted via the blank canvas boards, albeit only one or two words at a time (see inteview log below). 

Should a subject enter SCP-2135-B with any items that were manufactured after February 1959, or exhibit speech patterns or another mannerisms anachronistic to the period upon exiting the 91st Street Station, SCP-2135-C instances will stop in place and continuously "stare" at the subject until they leave. While SCP-2135-C instances do not exhibit any hostile intent, subjects will generally express a strong desire to leave if SCP-2135-C instances enter this state, citing discomfort and unease. Subjects may leave SCP-2135-B by returning down the 91st Street Station entrance; SCP-2135-A will appear within ten minutes and will return the subject to baseline reality. 

After twenty four hours have passed within SCP-2135-B[[footnote]]91st Street Station was closed on 2 Feb 1959, as it is within SCP-2135-B.[[/footnote]], the 91st Street Station will be closed, and subjects will be unable to leave SCP-2135-B. [REDACTED] although said reports remain unconfirmed, and the similarities may be superficial or coincidental.

> **Date:** 23 Aug 2007 (baseline time)
> 
> **Test Subject:** D-3425 (29 years old; Caucasian female)
> 
> **Equipment Outfitted:** Handheld audio recorder, c. 1956; period-appropriate clothing; notepad and two (2) pencils, both manufactured c. 1958. 
> 
> **Notes:** To avoid shocking or upsetting D-3425 (thus potentially making data collection problematic), subject was informed of the nature of SCP-2135-B beforehand. Subject is instructed to find nearest SCP-2135-C instance and engage it in conversation, taking care to avoid using contemporary jargon, and transcribe the responses produced via the canvas board. Subject was given a list of pre-approved questions, but was given permission to deviate from this list if necessary.
