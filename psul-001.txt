If you're reading this, then you've taken a look at this page during the 30 minutes or so that it's going to take me to set things up.  Please come back later to read and vote.

If you feel the need to vote on something urgently, can I please suggest that you do so by selecting something from [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/psuls-author-page |my author page]]].  Hopefully that also is enough evidence that this is not trolling or flailing.
