++++ **__Special Containment Procedures__**
Two SCP-5507-1 instances are held within Biological Containment Unit-41 at Site-701. Automated systems will dispense their basic daily food requirements, which consists of 56 grams of meat product. Testing of SCP-5507-1 instances must meet SK-BIO Type 004 safety standards and be approved by the current HCML supervisor.

The organs, tissue samples, heads, and blood samples of two SCP-5507-2 instances are stored within Biological Storage Locker-49. The autopsy report for either of these instances is available upon request. Any living SCP-5507-2 instances that are recovered are to be held within Euclid-class humanoid containment chambers.

SCP-5507-3 is stored within High-Security Artifact Locker-8 at Site-51. Testing is limited to Biomancy Research Team personnel with clearance level 3/5507 or higher.

The investigative branch of Mobile Task Force Zeta-8 is to continue monitoring GoI-0707. All action taken against GoI-0707 must be approved by the Director of Site-701 and the Japanese Department of External Affairs Chief Liaison. Under no circumstance are Foundation assets to directly target high-profile members of GoI-0707, without the explicit approval of O5 Command.

++++ **__Description__**
[[include :scp-sandbox-3:image-zoom name=sig|caption=Monshō belonging to the House of the Blood Lotus.|width=100px|align=right]]
SCP-5507 is the designation for several anomalies with connections to GoI-0707 ("House of the Blood Lotus[[footnote]] 血蓮家  [[/footnote]]"). GoI-0707 is a multifaceted Neo-Sarkic organization based in Japan, with significant ties to the Japanese government and financial sector. Originally discovered by the Foundation in 1978, the true scope of their influence and membership is currently unknown. The federal and prefectural governments of Japan have been consistently uncooperative and, in some instances, confrontational regarding GoI-0707 and its activities. Esoteric practitioners of the group typically specialize in three forms of biomancy (pheromancy, faunal transfiguration, and Fumeiniku[[footnote]]Meaning "Hidden Flesh"; little information is known about this biomantic form of ninjutsu.[[/footnote]]), as well as traditional carnomancy typically employed by Neo-Sarkic sects.

SCP-5507-1 are carnivorous cephalopodic SK-BIO Type 004 organisms of varying size and composition[[footnote]]With all known instances possessing approximately 75% human genetic material.[[/footnote]], typically used as concealed traps within GoI-0707 compounds. Unlike non-anomalous cephalopods, SCP-5507-1 instances do not require water and are capable of deriving oxygen through spiracle-like orifices throughout their body. SCP-5507-1 instances possess neither auditory nor visual organs, rather utilizing a combination touch and hyper-sensitive olfaction to sense their surroundings. Instances typically have twelve to eighteen tentacles, each with hundreds of mouth-like orifices lined with serrated teeth. In order to be stored within small containers, SCP-5507-1 instances are capable of constricting their bodies into spaces several times smaller than their own size.

SCP-5507-2 is the collective designation for a group of female humanoids employed and created by GoI-0707. Individual instances vary in age, ranging from approximately 20 to 30 years old. Each instance has received the following identical modifications:
* Lack of facial features and orifices.
* Compact musculature, allowing for greatly increased strength and speed.
[[include :scp-sandbox-3:image-zoom name=gir|caption=An SCP-5507-2 instance.|width=150px|align=right]]
* Wrist orifices lined with venom sacs that secrete toxins through a specialized mucus membrane.
* 25 cm bone spike formation within the forearms, capable of retracting through the wrist orifices.
* Ten organic sphincters located on the back, utilized in the release of various airborne chemical compounds.
* A series of complex internal organ systems capable of creating and storing a near-infinite variety of chemical and pheromonal compounds.
SCP-5507-2 instances are highly obedient and will instantly respond to any command given by their superiors. For this reason, GoI-0707 typically uses the SCP-5507-2 as personal attendants and bodyguards.

SCP-5507-3 is an 85 cm curved single-edged blade composed of an unknown carbon-based organic metalloid, only capable of being correctly wielded by practitioners of biomancy. When the mekugi[[footnote]]Section of the blade on which the tsuka, or handle, is mounted.[[/footnote]] is gripped by a biomancer, SCP-5507-3 will fuse with the wielder's hand and forearm, integrating fully with their appendage. When used on a biological organism, SCP-5507-3 does not cause injury in the manner typical of a sword, instead causing drastic biological mutations to the organic tissue within its immediate vicinity.

++++ **__Addendum 5507/1__**
On 1996/05/22, Mobile Task Force Kappa-26 ("Wake Watchers") uncovered evidence that a major transaction was to take place between Vivian Durant-Croÿ (presumed leader of the reformed
GoI-0490 - "Adytum's Wake") and a ranking member of GoI-0707. The exact cargo was unknown at the time, but agents discovered the time, date, and location of the delivery. The item (later revealed to be SCP-5507-3) was shipped from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to Narita International Airport (NRT) by members of GoI-0490, at which time SCP-5507-3 was remanded into the custody of GoI-0707 operatives.

Operation Red-Handed was to be carried out by the newly formed MTF Zeta-8 ("Izanami's Spear")[[footnote]]In response to the Foundation's updated engagement policy regarding GoI-0707, Zeta-8 was created to directly counteract, contain, and/or eliminate threats and anomalies with connections to the GoI. [[/footnote]], on 1996/05/29. Reconnaissance specialists were instructed to monitor the delivery of SCP-5507-3 and then track the GoI-0707 operatives to their destination, at which time MTF Zeta-8 would evaluate and raid the location. 

At 19:35 GMT, SCP-5507-3 arrived as scheduled and was hand-delivered to a man accompanied by two SCP-5507-2 instances. From the airport, the GoI-0707 operatives traveled south by car for 1.5 hours, to a remote residential property in the southwest of the Chiba Prefecture. The reconnaissance team reported at least 25 individuals were on the premises, seemingly gathered for some sort of event. Two four-man teams of MTF Zeta-8 were deployed to raid the compound, the following is a partial transcription of the event:

**ζ-7/01:** North sealed.

**ζ-7/04:** East sealed; one guard down.

**ζ-7/05:** South is sealed, but, uh, have you had a look inside ζ-7/01? Aside from the faceless chicks, this looks like a normal party.

//[ζ-7/01 slowly moves to the window nearest the door. The scene inside correlates with an average dinner party, a few dozen men and women drinking and engaging in conversation. A total of four SCP-5507-2 instances can be seen in each corner of the room.]//

**ζ-7/07:** Take a look at the thermal scan.

**ζ-7/02:** So, we've got three rooms, the middle has three people. The other two have one each. I'm going to assume they're keeping it in that center room.

**ζ-7/06:** What's the plan?

**ζ-7/02:** ζ-7/06, go around and take the front room; ζ-7/08, you take the back. ζ-7/07, we're going through the roof, right into that center room. Okay, in positions, we'll breach at the same time.

**Kurata:** Now that we're all here, I will speak in your native tongue, as such you may not misunderstand my words. You, whom we have never interfered with, have interrupted a joyous occasion. The return of a most sacred item.

**Kurata:** Like many of the relics of my homeland, it was lost to us after the war, and we have merely returned it to its rightful home. So, tell me– why have you chosen to interfere? Have you no reverence for these lands?

**Kurata:** You look surprised– did you really think these dolls //[Kurata pats one of the SCP-5507-2 on the head.]// were the only security we had?

**Kurata:** Let's have a demonstration.

**Kurata:** //You//, will wait your turn!

//[ζ-7/02 slouches back as ζ-7/07's severed arm grows patchy orange fur. The arm morphs and grows, taking on a mutated vulpine appearance. A smaller version of ζ-7/07's face appears where the vulpine organism's head should be. Its facial expression twists into a pained sneer as the organism screams. Its raspy voice distorting and echoing as it quickly scurries from the room.]//

**Kurata:** //これで貴方は逃れられますまい!// (You won't get away with this!)

**Afterword:** Shortly after MTF Zeta-8 engaged the GoI-0707 operatives, a 50-man detachment of the Special Forces Group (SFG)[[footnote]] The Japan Ground Self-Defense Force's specialized counter-terrorism unit.[[/footnote]] seized control of the property. Of the eight Foundation agents on the property, all but ζ-7/07 survived the encounter.
[[/collapsible]]

Among the civilians present during Operation Red-Handed were several prominent government officials (including PoI-0707/5[[footnote]] A known GoI-0707 member, Oshita Masahiro, Japan's Deputy Minister of Economy, Trade, and Industry.[[/footnote]]) and over a dozen notable Japanese businesspeople. The SFG arrested all Foundation personnel on the property under suspicion of domestic terrorism. While on its way to the property, the concealment team was stopped by a second SFG team and was similarly arrested. In total, 28 Foundation personnel were detained by the SFG.

During the SFG raid, the reconnaissance team remained undetected and witnessed four members of GoI-0707 (two of which were SCP-5507-2 instances) leave the premises with SCP-5507-3. A third four-man team from MTF Zeta-8 was deployed to intercept the item while being transported. The following is a partial transcript of the recovery:

The SCP-5507-1 and SCP-5507-2 instances were transported to Site-701; due to the risk of a GoI-0707 recovery attempt, SCP-5507-3 was transported to the United States to be stored at the Site-51 Maximum Security Facility.

After 32 hours of negotiations, the Foundation was able to secure the release of all 28 personnel incarcerated during the operation.

On 1996/05/25, the corpse of Director Ryo Osaki[[footnote]] The Director of Site-701 prior to his death.[[/footnote]] was found within his home office. The top section of Director Osaki's skull was removed and an SCP-5507-1 instance was placed within his cranial cavity. The phrase 刀を返せ (Please return the sword) was branded on his chest. Analysis of footage captured by Director Osaki's home surveillance equipment was inconclusive in discovering the identity or point of entry of the assailant.

The internal security protocols of Site-701 were upgraded immediately following this event. Due to the incidents involving SCP-5507, the GoI-0707 Engagement Risk Value (ERV) was raised to Level-5.
