hi. i'm CadaverCommander. i write stuff. i don't have a lot to say about me. if you're interested in reading what i have to say about the stuff i write, or you want to find other items i did, you can... find both of those down there. if for some delightfully insane reason you have questions about the horrible things i've done, you can put them on the discussion page here and i'll answer with the speed and grace of the mighty water buffalo.

im just gonna do these in the order that i wrote them so //alright here we go//

this is the first thing i wrote and is probably the one that people still know me best for. 

me and my friend were driving home from work one day and a weird mental image just came over me. i imagined a huge, burning truck that babbled insane shit over its CB radio and teleported around wildly while tearing up the asphalt, driven by some mad, inhuman beast.

i really have no idea why. i have an overactive imagination and i just roll with it.

he and i had some fun coming up with the wacky shit that this dude would say to other drivers on the road and spitballing about what this hypothetical "void trucker" would actually do. i even made the character a twitter account to try to explore his mentality a bit more (no, you will never find it). i was just having fun daydreaming about this thing i thought was badass, and considered adding the character to a tabletop RPG me and my friends were playing when i remembered that the SCP foundation existed.

well, i just had to, didn't i? i had to at least //try//.

i'd been reading the foundation since about 2012 and never thought i was good enough to actually write for it. but there was something about this character that sang to me, and i thought that as long as i wrote him honestly, he could probably entertain people enough with his raving, part-spooky part-goofy antics to not be deleted.

and the rest is history.

so.

this one.

i really, really don't like this one. this is hands-down the worst thing i've ever submitted to the site, for a buuuuunch of reasons, bar none. there's a reason why i almost never talk about it and why i have no real interest in doing anything with it ever again.

i have no idea why, but after my first thing //didn't// get deleted and generated a bit of positive buzz, i went kind of haywire. my ego is a bloated, delicate thing and i think the reception went to my head or something. so i hatched what i //thought// was a brilliant plan, but turned out to be a hilariously misguided exercise in masturbatory wish-fulfillment that not only embarrassed me but made a mockery of the idea it was originally based upon.

i decided to make one of my DnD characters into a skip.

i understand, dear readers, that some of your ocular nerves are now dislocated from rolling your eyes at torques only attainable by high-powered diesel engines. i am sorry for what i've done to you and i hope your surgeries are as successful and painless as possible.

there's really not that much more to say about wilhelm. he's just an idea that i've had in my skull for years, and not a particularly good idea at that. just something that i personally thought was //rad as hell// that i for some reason thought i was talented enough to shoehorn into a skip. (you will begin to notice a pattern here if you decide to continue reading these.)

a mutated man that bleeds fossil fuels. connected to a suit of power armor that's run by an engine that literally burns his blood to function. equipped with flamethrowers powerful enough to vaporize steel.

yeah, i'm not really sure what i was thinking either.

i ended up having to turn him into a somewhat sympathetic, cursed thing, with a pleasant personality and a tragic backstory. because... well, why not at this point. i have this weird obsession with knights, both aesthetically and philosophically, and i thought i could ooze some of that onto this and have it come out as being... i dont know, heartwarming? it didn't. it's an awkward, desperate bucket of hamfisted lame characterization and it's just //terrible//.

one of these days i might go back and redo him, because as stupid as the idea is, i still love it and i want to at least try to make it into something serviceable. 

oh, and the deity that "cursed" him and gave him his armor was 3899. 3899 sometimes hijacks mortals he thinks are neat and gives them a "tune up", i.e. transform the shit out of them in ways that are often impressive but unfortunate or misguided.

let's... let's just move on.

after 3988 exploded horribly (even the forum crit staff told me i shouldn't have posted it) i decided you know what, fuck it, let's just go back and channel something i already know people like. let's write a 3899 tale. people like him, so this'll be great!

it wasn't, really!

i don't like this much. it's awkwardly paced, a lot of the dialogue is forced and absurd, and the ending is jarring and kind of weak. the intent was to show what happens when 3899 stops fucking around, and i... sort of did that? but not with a lot of grace or intelligence. (again, you may begin to notice a theme, dear readers.)

fortunately no one's really read it, and i have (eventual) plans to replace it with something a little more impressive. here's hoping i do a better job next time.

so this is where things start to... either go down- or uphill, depending on your perspective.

i'll get into more of the actual... mythology and crap at play here further down, but this was the first step in constructing my... i don't fucking know, mythos? series? misguided, hamfisted attempt at writing something impressive and amazing? whatever you want to call it.

basically, this thing is a recruitment tool. the Sorrow sprinkled these artifacts all over the world at some point a while ago to try to get people to help him carry the weight of the world and maintain the ambient magical energy field that stops his opposite, Mother, from taking over the world. 

this energy field puts an enormous amount of strain on mortals trying to support it, and most of them end up getting flattened in various weird and fun ways if they try. the pure //weight// of this thing radiates from it and will warp your pitiful human psyche if you get too close. if you //touch// it, you get connected directly to the Sorrow himself, and... well, most people can't handle that.

the ones that //can//, however, end up being whisked away somewhere else.

all-in-all, i'm alright with this one. it's not brilliant, but it has a couple moments that i like. not my best work, but not my worst either. it worked out okay as a tool to get people to start asking questions, and i'm sort of shocked that it's where it is considering it's really just a bad series 1 style "thing that fucks you up".

the rest of my mistakes would come later.
