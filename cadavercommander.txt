hi. i'm CadaverCommander. i write stuff. i don't have a lot to say about me. if you're interested in reading what i have to say about the stuff i write, or you want to find other items i did, you can... find both of those down there. if for some delightfully insane reason you have questions about the horrible things i've done, you can put them on the discussion page here and i'll answer with the speed and grace of the mighty water buffalo.

these aren't in any particular order so //alright here we go//

this is the first thing i wrote and is probably the one that people still know me best for. 

me and my friend were driving home from work one day and a weird mental image just came over me. i imagined a huge, burning truck that babbled insane shit over its CB radio and teleported around wildly while tearing up the asphalt, driven by some mad, inhuman beast.

i really have no idea why. i have an overactive imagination and i just roll with it.

he and i had some fun coming up with the wacky shit that this dude would say to other drivers on the road and spitballing about what this hypothetical "void trucker" would actually do. i even made the character a twitter account to try to explore his mentality a bit more (no, you will never find it). i was just having fun daydreaming about this thing i thought was badass, and considered adding the character to a tabletop RPG me and my friends were playing when i remembered that the SCP foundation existed.

well, i just had to, didn't i? i had to at least //try//.

i'd been reading the foundation since about 2012 and never thought i was good enough to actually write for it. but there was something about this character that sang to me, and i thought that as long as i wrote him honestly, he could probably entertain people enough with his raving, part-spooky part-goofy antics to not be deleted.

and the rest is history.
