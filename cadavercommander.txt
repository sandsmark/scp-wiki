hi. i'm CadaverCommander. i write stuff. i don't have a lot to say about me. if you're interested in reading what i have to say about the stuff i write, or you want to find other items i did, you can... find both of those down there. if for some delightfully insane reason you have questions about the horrible things i've done, you can put them on the discussion page here and i'll answer with the speed and grace of the mighty water buffalo.

im just gonna do these in the order that i wrote them so //alright here we go//

**[[[SCP-3899]]] - The Night Hauler**
[[collapsible show="commentary" hide="YEEEEEEHAWWWW"]]
this is the first thing i wrote and is probably the one that people still know me best for. 

me and my friend were driving home from work one day and a weird mental image just came over me. i imagined a huge, burning truck that babbled insane shit over its CB radio and teleported around wildly while tearing up the asphalt, driven by some mad, inhuman beast.

i really have no idea why. i have an overactive imagination and i just roll with it.

he and i had some fun coming up with the wacky shit that this dude would say to other drivers on the road and spitballing about what this hypothetical "void trucker" would actually do. i even made the character a twitter account to try to explore his mentality a bit more (no, you will never find it). i was just having fun daydreaming about this thing i thought was badass, and considered adding the character to a tabletop RPG me and my friends were playing when i remembered that the SCP foundation existed.

well, i just had to, didn't i? i had to at least //try//.

i'd been reading the foundation since about 2012 and never thought i was good enough to actually write for it. but there was something about this character that sang to me, and i thought that as long as i wrote him honestly, he could probably entertain people enough with his raving, part-spooky part-goofy antics to not be deleted.

and the rest is history.

[[/collapsible]]

**[[[SCP-3988]]] - A Fire in the Knight**
[[collapsible show="commentary" hide="ugh god not this one hnnnngh"]]
so.

this one.

i really, really don't like this one. this is hands-down the worst thing i've ever submitted to the site, for a buuuuunch of reasons, bar none. there's a reason why i almost never talk about it and why i have no real interest in doing anything with it ever again.

i have no idea why, but after my first thing //didn't// get deleted and generated a bit of positive buzz, i went kind of haywire. my ego is a bloated, delicate thing and i think the reception went to my head or something. so i hatched what i //thought// was a brilliant plan, but turned out to be a hilariously misguided exercise in masturbatory wish-fulfillment that not only embarrassed me but made a mockery of the idea it was originally based upon.

i decided to make one of my DnD characters into a skip.

i understand, dear readers, that some of your ocular nerves are now dislocated from rolling your eyes at torques only attainable by high-powered diesel engines. i am sorry for what i've done to you and i hope your surgeries are as successful and painless as possible.

there's really not that much more to say about wilhelm. he's just an idea that i've had in my skull for years, and not a particularly good idea at that. just something that i personally thought was //rad as hell// that i for some reason thought i was talented enough to shoehorn into a skip. (you will begin to notice a pattern here if you decide to continue reading these.)

a mutated man that bleeds fossil fuels. connected to a suit of power armor that's run by an engine that literally burns his blood to function. equipped with flamethrowers powerful enough to vaporize steel.

yeah, i'm not really sure what i was thinking either.

i ended up having to turn him into a somewhat sympathetic, cursed thing, with a pleasant personality and a tragic backstory. because... well, why not at this point. i have this weird obsession with knights, both aesthetically and philosophically, and i thought i could ooze some of that onto this and have it come out as being... i dont know, heartwarming? it didn't. it's an awkward, desperate bucket of hamfisted lame characterization and it's just //terrible//.

one of these days i might go back and redo him, because as stupid as the idea is, i still love it and i want to at least try to make it into something serviceable. 

oh, and the deity that "cursed" him and gave him his armor was 3899. 3899 sometimes hijacks mortals he thinks are neat and gives them a "tune up", i.e. transform the shit out of them in ways that are often impressive but unfortunate or misguided.

let's... let's just move on.

[[/collapsible]]

**[[[SCP-3898]]] - The Burden**
[[collapsible show="commentary" hide="oof ouch it's so heavy jeez"]]
so this is where things start to... either go down- or uphill, depending on your perspective.

i'll get into more of the actual... mythology and crap at play here further down, but this was the first step in constructing my... i don't fucking know, mythos? series? misguided, hamfisted attempt at writing something impressive and amazing? whatever you want to call it.

basically, this thing is a recruitment tool. the Sorrow sprinkled these artifacts all over the world at some point a while ago to try to get people to help him carry the weight of the world and maintain the ambient magical energy field that stops his opposite, Mother, from taking over the world. 

this energy field puts an enormous amount of strain on mortals trying to support it, and most of them end up getting flattened in various weird and fun ways if they try. the pure //weight// of this thing radiates from it and will warp your pitiful human psyche if you get too close. if you //touch// it, you get connected directly to the Sorrow himself, and... well, most people can't handle that.

the ones that //can//, however, end up being whisked away somewhere else.

all-in-all, i'm alright with this one. it's not brilliant, but it has a couple moments that i like. not my best work, but not my worst either. it worked out okay as a tool to get people to start asking questions, and i'm sort of shocked that it's where it is considering it's really just a bad series 1 style "thing that fucks you up".

the rest of my mistakes would come later.
[[/collapsible]]

**[[[SCP-3889]]] - The Greatest Fisherman Who Ever Lived**
[[collapsible show="commentary" hide="hooray for sad old men with terrifying powers!"]]
this is one of the only ones that i can say i really, genuinely like.

while i was laying the groundwork for all this... stuff, i reasoned that there would probably be demigods to go along with my gods i was audaciously building. hank is one such demigod. he was given great power and a terrible duty by the Sorrow, befitting his chosen profession.

hank's a fisherman, and his job is to catch things. in this case, he catches the incomplete, juvenile scions that Mother spawns, before they have the chance to grow up and annihilate the entire planet.

however, hank isn't the smartest human being on the planet, and he occasionally makes mistakes, which result in casualties. he's also not really geared to //fight// the things directly, so he had to spend a few decades pulling out the //really// tiny ones to kill for himself before the world developed military strength enough to tackle the big ol' baddies. around WWII these conditions were set, so hank started pulling out the ones that were closer to... reaching adulthood. hank saves the world every day, more or less, but it's hard to see that from the Foundation's perspective.

hank's not a happy guy. he's over 170 years old and he misses his wife. he'd //really// like to die and be reunited with her, but the Sorrow won't let him go. 

and now that the war is really breaking out, he has more work to do than ever.

like i said, i really do like this one. i fell in love with hank's character, and i hope i was able to make that apparent in the writing. i'd probably delete every other article i've ever done before i deleted hank. i'd like to include him in some tales one of these days, once i figure out how to write them without them being completely stupid.

so don't hold your breath or anything, basically.
[[/collapsible]]

**[[[SCP-3983]]] - To Petition the Dead**
[[collapsible show="commentary" hide="yay corpses!"]]
this is where i had to beef up the mythology a little bit and actually introduce the mechanics and characters at play, here. while setting up a bit of thematic... whateverness.

so, as you may or may not be aware, people die. most of the time, those people have the sense to move on from this plane of existence and go to wherever the next place is. some people... don't. they either don't have the sense, they have unfinished business, or can't deal with the fact that they're dead, or any number of reasons you've heard before.

these discontented dead come to a threshold, where they're given a choice to make.

option 1: sacrifice yourself and willingly sign on for an eternity of pain helping the Sorrow hold up the metaphysical and conceptual framework upon which all Humanity is constructed. this will not be fun. it will not be easy. but you will know that you are the bedrock that supports human existence, and you get to fight an endless war for justice against the forces of mankind's fouler nature. if you're into that kind of thing.

option 2: throw yourself into wild abandon and be embraced by Mother, where you will live an unlife of fury, hatred, hunger, and gleeful slaughter, fighting desperately for a chance to commune with the Unrest herself and become one with the darker, more visceral side of mankind. it's a lot of fun, if your soul is strong enough to avoid being crushed or devoured by those who have been there longer.

option 3: move on. nobody knows what'll happen to you. it's death, nothing's certain. but good luck anyway.

secret option 4: refuse //everything// and choose to persist for yourself. this will attract the attention of the entity known to some as the Night Hauler, who finds that kind of thing really, really admirable. i'm not sure what'll happen to you, but chances are it'll be totally badass.

ultimately this article confused people more than it drew them in, i think. raised more questions than it answered. which i think isn't a bad thing, but some people don't have the patience for that kind of thing. this was where things started to really take shape, though, and there's really no point lamenting what's done, i guess.
[[/collapsible]]

**[[[SCP-3897]]] - Mother's Eye is Upon You**
[[collapsible show="commentary" hide="even! more! corpses!"]]
this is where things started getting really big and really dumb, and would only continue to get bigger and dumber.

if this one feels sort of rushed and threadbare, that's because it basically is. i literally just had an idea for a monster that i thought was cool and wrote it. there's not much more to it than that. 

in terms of my... canon? whatever, this thing is basically a corpsey weather balloon. Mother releases these from the sea to keep an eye on the surface world, collect data, and identify living people that are likely to accept the Sorrow's burden (and therefore make Mother's existence more difficult) and devour them before they get the chance to properly die. because Mother's a cheating bitch and she doesn't give a shit about the rules.

i still //really// like this one, but let's be honest: it belongs in a DnD monster manual, not here. 
[[/collapsible]]

**[[[SCP-3896]]] - The Knights Grow Weary**
[[collapsible show="commentary" hide="magical ghost knights fighting mutant zombie leviathans"]]
and so the escalation continued. by this point people were starting to get //really// upset with me for being really vague and unclear about what the fuck i was doing on this website, so i decided that i had to make things clearer. and that ended up being this.

so, it's not readily apparent, but the souls that merge with Mother have a kind of hierarchy, determined by the strength of one's soul. if you're weak, you get turned into a mindless drone or used as raw materials to make something like 3897 up there. if you're //not// weak, and you fight like a son of a bitch, and tap into the ferocity that lives in the heart of every human person, Mother might reward you for it. -03 here is an example of one of the guys that's basically as high as one gets.

he's a node tender. a node is kind of like a hyperspatial hernia: a little bit of Mother that's squirted into realspace. the tender is attached to the node, and from there gets to experiment with crafting horrible nasty beasts (Scions) out of the Dross, or the lowest, most pathetic and mindless of those souls within Mother. these scions then get released, to consume and destroy everything in their path. 

however, the Sorrow's contingent of Knights, the Bearers of the Burden, kind of take exception to that, so they sit and they watch these nodes, waiting for the tender to release its next necrotic nasty and slay it before it can escape and eat a town or something. that's really what's happening here.

or at least that's //supposed// to be what's happening. for whatever reason, the Knights are getting weaker, and they're no longer strong enough to keep these things boxed in. so the Foundation is having to lend an assist.

this article is okay, i guess. i like the imagery that i was able to put forward and it was fun writing -03's dialogue, but ultimately this is a weird scuffle between things that doesn't have a lot of context unless you're already familiar with at least a little of the backstory followed by an awkward infodump at the end. it's not very clever, or elegant, but for those that like magical ghost warriors engaging in eternal combat with gross corpse monsters, i... guess it works.

or not. i don't really have any fucking clue what i'm doing here.
[[/collapsible]]

**[[[SCP-3894]]] - Our Sorrow**
[[collapsible show="commentary" hide="ffffffffffuck."]]
and this is where, in my opinion, i began to make my most damning errors.

you tell me if this sounds like a good idea, reader.

write a humanoid. okay? those are given a little extra scrutiny, and are considered by most to be a little trickier to pull off than other forms of skip, because they're //people//. tough, but not impossible, people do it pretty frequently, and it can go over just as well as anything else as long as you write it honestly.

now take your humanoid and literally make it a god.

not like, a pretend god, or even a really powerful reality bender. no, that would be too tame for you, you hilarious fool. an actual, no shit, fully-fledged fucking //god//. the kind of thing that, if it were to disappear, would result in human civilization no longer being able to support itself. a genius loci for //all life on earth//.

okay. that's going to take some doing. you probably shouldn't even //attempt// something like this unless you're an extremely experienced, established author and you know //exactly// how to sell it.

now make it a thaumiel. make it an //ally// to the foundation. a good guy. an anomaly for the foundation to //be partners with//.

then staple a bunch of other wacky magical crap to it in a hackneyed, pitiful attempt at justifying its existence.

i know. i stopped listening to me a while back too.
[[/collapsible]]

**[[[SCP-3895]]] - Our Unrest**
[[collapsible show="commentary" hide="nope."]]
yeah. you're not like, hallucinating. you probably //wish// you were, and honestly so do i at this point.

3895. my season 1 finale, if you will. and without a doubt the biggest, dumbest, clumsiest, most completely fucking ridiculous article on this site as far as i can tell.

and not in a good way, either.

looking back, i'm not entirely sure what led me to believe that this was a good idea. a combination of a lot of things, i think. this article, i think, is the absolute epitome, the logical conclusion if you will, of someone writing with their heart at warp factor 11 while their //brain// is effectively atrophied to the point where it looks more like a sticky red peanut. 

i bit off //so// much more than i was ever capable of chewing. and i've still got pieces in my teeth.

there's a lot i could say about this. there's a lot i //want// to say about this. because ultimately i still love this project and i wrote it for a reason. i could sit here, literally for days, and type nonstop about all the backstory and lore and psychological and philosophical underpinnings and inspirations and all the reasons why i decided to write this gigantic pile in the first place.

but at this juncture i don't think it's warranted anymore. i wasn't ready for this but went ahead and did it anyway. 

more fool me.

**[[[SCP-3588]]] - Cheers**
[[collapsible show="commentary" hide="anyone want a drink?"]]
well that was depressing! let's move on to something that doesn't involve me spiraling into a whining cycle of self-loathing.

i really, really like this one. i put this one, 3889, and 3899 all in the same general category, even if they're conceptually very different. these are, really, just character pieces.

i'm addicted to characters. i like inventing people that don't exist, and i love the feeling of breathing life into them and making them seem as real as possible even though they only exist in the form of words on a page.

i also really like drinking, and i like drinking with the people that are close to me.

those feelings resulted in jack. this article is a departure from my other latest stuff, and i think you can tell. mostly because it's actually close to //good// instead of... otherwise.

this article isn't complicated and there's not a lot to say about it. it's a manifestation of some very simple ideas and feelings that mean a lot to me, told simply, with as much honesty as i could muster. i realize this kind of puff piece sort of thing isn't everyone's bag, but i really enjoyed writing it and i'm glad it gets to exist here.

i have no idea how you people let me get away with putting a non-malicious omniscient bartender on this horror website, but come to think, you've let me get away with a //bunch// of stuff i probably shouldn't have, and it's been a wild ride so far. so here's to you.

cheers.

**[[[SCP-3885]]] - The High-Octane Full-Throttle Adventures of the Exploding Zombie Gearheads**
[[collapsible show="commentary" hide="HEAVY METAL, DUDE"]]
this is the first one in a long time that i can say i'm honestly proud of.

i understand that this kind of thing is absolutely not for everyone, and it doesn't //really// match the overall tone of the site well, but if there's an article i have that sums up my entire writing philosophy, it's this one.

this is big, loud, //extremely// stupid, and more or less constantly on fire. and it was fun as hell to write.

this is the kind of thing that i wish i could write all the time. it's unintelligent, it's the opposite of subtle, and it's as elegant as a dead pig in a kimono, but it's //fun//. or at least i think it is. 

i love my exploding zombie knuckleheads, and hopefully you guys like them too.

[[/collapsible]]


ok, that's uh... that's it. i don't know what else to put here. if by some vast ocean of improbability there's something you'd want me to add, let me know in the comments? i suppose?

oh, and thanks for reading my awkward, inadvisable articles. hopefully you were able to get at least a modicum of entertainment out of some of it. ♥
