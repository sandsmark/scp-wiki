hi. i'm CadaverCommander. i write stuff. i don't have a lot to say about me. if you want to find other things i did, you can find them down there. if for some reason you have questions about the horrible things i've done, you can put them on the discussion page here and i'll answer with the speed and grace of the mighty water buffalo.

not only do i write for scp and for Wanderer's Library, but i'm also writing a novel! woah! if you're a real cool guy/gal and want to give it a read, everything i've done so far can be found [https://www.wattpad.com/story/193722517-the-featherlight-transmission right here]. it's about an 800-pound cyborg wizard mutant detective that has to solve some murders. i post a new chapter every few weeks, probably. if you don't want to read, that's ok. i still think you're cool. ♥

i also have a ko-fi account! if you like my stuff, you can tip me! i would be super duper thankful if you did! it keeps me writing! and powers the crystal matrix that sustains my dread unlife! heck yeah!
