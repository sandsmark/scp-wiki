hi. i'm CadaverCommander. i write stuff. i don't have a lot to say about me. if you want to find other things i did, you can find them down there. if for some reason you have questions about the horrible things i've done, you can put them on the discussion page here and i'll answer with the speed and grace of the mighty water buffalo.

i don't write for the site anymore, really. i might again one day. this is mostly because i'm writing a novel at the moment, which is taking up most of my brain zone. if you're a real cool guy/gal and want to give it a read, everything i've done so far can be found [https://www.wattpad.com/story/172671077-the-blade-thief right here]. it's about magic swords and cyborgs and stuff. i post a new chapter every few weeks. if you don't want to read, that's ok. i still think you're cool. ♥
