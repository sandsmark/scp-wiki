We're doing a bunch of new things for this month's Site News! Changes include a revamped Fan-content area, a contest recap, and an editor's choice section! Feedback on all of these things would be greatly appreciated, so please let us know in the comments what you think about it. 

Before we start though, I just want to give a huge thank you to [[*user TSATPWTCOTTTADC]] and [[*user Uncle Nicolini]], without whom none of this would have been possible. Seriously, they're amazing.

[[size 75%]]This is a series showing off news from the site, articles from the past month[[footnote]] with a rating above 0 [[/footnote]], and fan-content for you to check out and discover! Be sure to leave a comment with your thoughts![[/size]]

++++* Fandom Stuff
* [[[scp-oct-hub| SCP OCT Hub]]] - In the void left by March Madness, a new unofficial site arena has opened up. Original Characters vs Original Characters, the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny and Posting has begun. Organized by [[*user PeppersGhost]].
* [[[scp-series-5| SCP Series 5]]] - The 4000 contest has finally concluded (check out the post-game stats page below) and Series 5 is finally open to contributions! Get out there and start making articles!

++++* Event Featured Articles

This month had no theme! Instead, winners from the previous [[[Doomsday Contest]]] got their articles featured! Check them out below!

++++* Featured Articles

* The featured articles for August were [[[SCP-3379]]] ("D-11424 and the Arctic Meat Hole of Infinite Wonders") by [[*user Darkstuff]] and [[*user Weryllium]], [[[SCP-3564]]] ("The Immortal Bard, Act Ⅱ: Return of Shakespeare") by [[*user MaliceAforethought]], [[[SCP-3934]]] ("For Sale: Loch Ness Monsters") by [[*user Modern_erasmus]], and [[[Parts]]] by [[*user Fieldstone]].
 * In [[[SCP-3379]]], D-11424, inter-dimensional free-man, is put through a series of challenges, possibly for the right to his kidneys. I'm not sure though, don't speak walrus.
 * In [[[SCP-3564]]], Shakespeare comes back from the dead to do...something. Certainly something.
 * In [[[SCP-3934]]], MC&D play fetch with the Foundation using the Loch Ness Monster.
 * In [[[Parts]]], sacrifice is made apparent in the face of overwhelming good.


++++* Editor's Choice Articles

* [[[SCP-3009]]] ("Hi, I'm Your Snappelganger!") by [[*user Keyii]] - Wonderful characterization of lovable characters will have you attached to Stacey Lee quickly.
* [[[SCP-3758]]] ("The Last Dodo") by [[*user daveyoufool]] - A very predictable article until it very much isn't. 
* [[[SCP-3844]]] ("To Slay a Dragon") by [[*user Captain Kirby]] - Science cannot truly kill whimsy.
* [[[SCP-4028]]] ("La Historia de Don Quixote de la Mancha") by [[*user The Great Hippo]] - Huge bias here, but I love Don Quixote and this meta-narrative is truly incredible.
* [[[SCP-4239]]] ("Project Kenowhere Central Volunteer Hub...") by [[*user scarhaver]] and [[*user Dolphinslugchugger]] - Pretty much a GAW 001 proposal. 
* [[[SCP-4113]]] ("Long is the Way You Must Wander") by [[*user Doctor Cimmerian]] - Rule of cool reigns supreme here. Vikings, space, and lightsabers.
* [[[Inside the Wall]]] by [[*user Taylor Itkin]] - This is truly inspired and I highly suggest it.
* [[[Intermission]]] by [[*user tygently]] - I had no idea what Third Law was prior to this, but the article got me interested in exploring the canon.
* [[[ListPages Magic and You]]] by [[*user Croquembouche]] - The most helpful tool once could imagine for learning Listpages wizardy.

Congratulations to

For winning the SCP-4000 Contest!
With: [[[SCP-4000 | Taboo]]]

[[/div]]

**##green|Taboo##** is a dark, twisted expansion on [[[scp-001-o5 | that time the Foundation committed genocide.]]] **##green|The contest winner##** has caused quite a stir within the community, with many people talking about it! Here are some notable creations!

* Do you have questions about SCP-4000? Well, look no further than [https://www.reddit.com/r/SCPDeclassified/comments/920z3u/scp4000_taboo_contest_entry/ r/SCPDeclassified on SCP-4000] and [[*user Doctor Cimmerian]]'s [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65ZOteo-Pvo Object Class Explained: SCP-4000.]
* Speaking of [[*user Doctor Cimmerian]], he also narrated the article. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyFuSYbLtLc Check it out!]
* [[*user pastarasta1]] made an SCP-4000-inspired animation. [http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/pastarasta1-s-simply-epic-artpage/taboo2 Here it is!]
* [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4000-j SCP-4000-J], or '2boo' by [[*user djkaktus]] is a funnier take on SCP-4000!

@@@@
[[*user Varaxous]]
> [[[SCP-4069|SCP-4069: Out of Range]]] by [[[sexycontainmentprocedures|Cyantreuse]]] is a pretty excellent read. Don't let the beginning fool you, this isn't a failed self-deletion. There's a lot going here, much of it deeper than it may seem. 100% worth a second read through, 200% worth reading through the follow up.
> 
> [[[SCP-4999|SCP-4999: Someone to Watch Over us]]] by [[*user CadaverCommander]]. All I need to say about this one is that it's been a long time since I've read something and gotten chills because of it. 
>
> [[[SCP-4017|SCP-4017: An Epilogue, Too Late to Matter]]] by [[*user NatVoltaic]]. There's a LOT of stuff here and all of it is extremely interesting. Exploring some aspects of Volt's own Second Hytoth, this piece really takes the 'History' theme to the max, exploring a lot of the Foundationverse through out. Warning: reading it may cause you to spend hours reading the other Church of the Second Hytoth articles.

[[*user Uncle Nicolini]]
> [[[scp-4007|SCP-4007: Kagemusha]]] by [[*user weizhong]] is by far my favorite article in the entire contest. It's expertly written and does everything to make you say 'Wait, what?' before the big reveal. I won't spoil it for you, so I highly encourage you to give it a read.
