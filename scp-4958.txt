**Item #:** SCP-XXXX

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Current containment efforts focus on the implementation of an international counseling program designated "Specialized Counselors and Psychiatrists." As SCP-XXXX is not currently contained, members of MTF Theta-4 ("Gardeners") are reminded to be wary of //Lycoris radiata// blooming on inorganic matter. Such instances should be retrieved immediately.

Agents that discover instances of SCP-XXXX are encouraged to converse with the individuals referred to in SCP-XXXX's notes. Said individuals are encouraged to reunite with their loved ones or attend counseling.

**Description:** SCP-XXXX refers to //Lycoris radiata// (more commonly known as red spider lilies) that bloom near individuals who have had a falling out with their loved ones. SCP-XXXX is distinguished from normal //Lycoris radiata// in that it blooms only on inorganic matter, such as tiled floors. Each instance of SCP-XXXX contains a folded piece of paper.

The paper contains a short, handwritten letter directed towards the individual. Letters are written in the native language of the individual. The handwriting matches that of a person whom the individual had a major dispute with. If SCP-XXXX is uprooted, but the conflict has not been reconciled, another instance will bloom within a month, carrying a different message. 

Analyses of SCP-XXXX instances has revealed two possible explanations for such phenomenon. The first is that the usage of an unusual and bright flower is to attract the attention of passing civilians, drawing their attention towards an individual in order to incite interaction. The second possible explanation is that the phenomena acts as a way to provide emotional support to the targeted individual.
