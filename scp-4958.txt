**Item #:** SCP-4958

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Current containment efforts focus on the implementation of an international counseling program designated "Specialized Counselors and Psychiatrists." Agents that discover instances of SCP-4958 are encouraged to converse with the individuals referred to in SCP-4958's notes. Said individuals should seek counseling or be reunited with their loved ones.

**Description:** SCP-4958 refers to //Lycoris radiata// (more commonly known as red spider lilies) that bloom near individuals who have had a major conflict with their loved ones. SCP-4958 is distinguished from normal //Lycoris radiata// in that it blooms only on inorganic matter, such as tiled floors. Each instance of SCP-4958 contains a folded piece of paper.

The paper contains a short handwritten letter directed towards the individual, which is written in their native language. The handwriting matches that of a person whom the individual had a major dispute with. Should an instance be uprooted, but the conflict has not been resolved, another instance will bloom within a month with a different message.
