title:Warning Labels
The following page contains various warning labels used by the Foundation to append to SPC case documents, in order for agents and researchers to quickly determine what safety precautions they must prepare for when handling or interacting with a given SPC.

All labels, as per Procedure FLS-2002-4, must be presented in a manner similar to the 'DIN 4844-2' standard, voted on and approved by a majority of Operatives on [[DATE EXPUNGED]]. This will replace the previous labeling system, based off of the North American standard 'NFPA 704', which was determined to be deficient in categorizing the threat profile of certain SPCs.
