title:Warning Labels
The following page contains various warning labels used by the Foundation to append to SPC case documents, in order for agents and researchers to quickly determine what safety precautions they must prepare for when handling or interacting with a given SPC.

All labels, as per Procedure FLS-2002-4, must be presented in a manner similar to the 'DIN 4844-2' standard, voted on and approved by a majority of Operatives on [[DATE EXPUNGED]]. This will replace the previous labeling system, based off of the North American standard 'NFPA 704', which was determined to be deficient in categorizing the threat profile of certain SPCs.

|||| [[image spc_self-rep.png ]] ||

[[div style="float:right; margin:0 2em 1em 2em; width:240px; border:0;"]]
|||| [[image spc_spacetime.png ]] ||
||||~ ^^Object presents non-standard space time properties or effects that do not behave according to our current understanding of general relativity, quantum physics, and other established scientific principles.^^ ||
[[/div]]


[[div style="float:left; margin:0 2em 1em 2em; width:240px; border:0;"]]
|||| [[image spc_topology.png ]] ||
||||~ ^^Object presents inconsistent or seemingly impossible topologies. Examples include object that are bigger on the inside than on the outside, portals to distant locations, etc. This is a more specific instance of a non-standard space-time.^^ ||

|||| [[image spc_auto.png ]] ||
