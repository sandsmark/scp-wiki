**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4298-A must be positioned in the middle of an appropriately sized containment cell, and is to be closed every day at 3:32 PM, local time. Only level 2 or higher foundation staff are allowed to enter SCP-4298-A when it is active, if given permission by the Project Director Dr. Romagnoli.
No experiments are to be taken place without supervision of the Project Director, Researcher Luciana Amati or Field Researcher Dr. Robin Texas Walker.

**Description:** SCP-4298-A is the former door and doorframe of containment cell #546 in Containment sector-87[[footnote]] Note: Cell #546, along with Containment Sector-87, has been removed from site-446 since 19/08/2003 during improvements of the facility in order to get space for new offices, and subsequentially relocated to the new Containment Sector-87. The room where SCP-4298-N was originally located has been defined as non-anomalous.[[/footnote]] of Site-446 located in █████, Italy. The containment cell was used for what was formerly catalogued as SCP-4298, a Type-Green entity, neutralized after the 04/02/19██ breach via two gunshots to the cranium and declassified on 17/06/19██.

SCP-4298's effect occurs between 3:32 and 3:33 PM, wherein it will unlock and open automatically.
Attempts were made to keep SCP-4298 closed for one day without human interaction, resulting in total failure. Subjects cannot enter the door through the side facing interior, instead, encountering a smooth, black wall of unknown material that prevents entry and observation into SCP-4298.
An event can be stopped by closing the door and locking, or automatically when it is 3:33 PM local time. Autonomous drones are reported to stop working when nearby SCP-4298-A, but audio and camera equipment mounted on experimental subjects can pass through unaffected.

When entered through the side facing chamber exit, the subject (referred hereby on as SCP-4298-B) will observe an exact duplicate of Site-446, identical  in details, of the 04/02/19██ breach, including Foundation personnel (SCP-4298-C). All copies of personnel within SCP-4298-C will perceive the subject as the former SCP-4298 upon entrance. This will incite the staff to attack SCP-4298-B, although the subject displays resistance to this damage. During the time spent in SCP-4298-C, the subject will always kill five researchers and three security guards, in addition to injuring eight more security guards and destroying the site's cafeteria. These incidents occur either out of self-defense[[footnote]]In which SCP-4298-B displays enhanced strength and stamina.[[/footnote]] or through unintentional means, recreating the casualties, damages and events of the 04/02/19██ breach.[[footnote]]Attempts were made to divert the path of events, always encountering failures. Test subjects who went inside SCP-4298-A and came out with result number 2 reported to not to be able to move on their own will, which contrasts with the first recorded event.[[/footnote]]

45 minutes after the beginning of the event, SCP-4298-D, recognized as a replica of then Senior Security Officer Attila Szabó, will appear and shoot SCP-4298-B in the head twice, effectively "neutralizing" SCP-4298-B. No recorded case has ever outlasted the 45 minute limit, either dying preemptively or being caught by SCP-4298-D before the time limit.
After being incapacitated within SCP-4298, SCP-4298-B will step out of SCP-4298-A, with one of the three events occurring: 

#	SCP-4298-B will have no recollection of the event. However, SCP-4298-B will report the sensation of being hunted or followed, lasting from 30 minutes to ten days. 
#	SCP-4298-B will retain all the memories and details of the event, including the layout of Site-446, faces of personnel, and actions taken during the event.
# 	SCP-4298-B will exhibit memories, personality traits, or abilities from SCP-4298-N, in which case the subject is to be terminated, unless testing is permitted.

**Discovery:** SCP-4298 was discovered 5 years after the breach, after Dr. Annabella Milani was reported missing at 3:33 PM on date 17/04/████. Dr. Milani was reported to enter cell #546 to retrieve an object she had left there and was reported found at 4:18 PM outside cell #546, shaking in fear and paranoia, with difficulties into describing what happened. Interview logs with Dr. Milani initially suggested that SCP-4298 was the entire containment cell. the cell was catalogued as the anomaly, until further testing concluded that the cell's door and door frame to be the cause of the anomaly.

**Addendum-4298-1:** On 26/03/20██, knocks were heard from behind SCP-4298-A, along with a voice, asking in Italian "Is anybody there?". Is uncertain how the door was capable of emitting sounds of its own, as is not attached to any room. Object upgraded to Euclid Class in case a specimen of SCP-4298-C somehow breaches containment.

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4298 has been considered neutralized after the 04/02/19██ containment breach. SCP-4298 is henceforth referred to as "SCP-4296-N".
Document is set to be decommissioned on date 17/06/19██ by order of the O5 council. Former containment procedures of SCP-4298-N are listed below.

 [[collapsible show="Former Containment Procedures prior of the 04/02/19██ breach" hide="Access Granted" ]]Due to the nature of SCP-4298, special containment procedures are not needed. However, for safety precautions, at least two (2) Senior Security officers are to be located nearby cell #546 in Containment Sector-87 of Site-446, place where SCP-4298 is reported to be located. If any change happens to SCP-4298, it must be reported to Project Director Dr. ██████ to discuss about further containment procedures.[[/collapsible]] 

**Description:** SCP-4298-N is a 1.87 meter tall humanoid, androgynous figure with reality bending abilities.[[footnote]]Information regarding the height of SCP-4298-N has been calculated by the recordings from Security Cameras when subject entered the cafeteria and was confronted the late Dr. Yves LeBlanc-Gandolfi. Height is to be considered an approximation. The gender of SCP-4298 is still currently unknown.[[/footnote]] Much of what the Foundation knew about SCP-4298-N prior to the 04/02/19██ breach was lost due to a fire created during SCP-4298-N's rampage. The majority of this document was compiled from recovered fragments of the document, eyewitness accounts, and expeditions into the current SCP-4298 and research into the alternate dimension's documentation of the entity. All of the information from the current SCP-4298 appears to not contradict the recovered information the Foundation has compiled so far.

Thought to be what was inside Security Cell #546, SCP-4298 appears to have features similar to [REDACTED], is capable of complex speech mimicry to the point of mimicking existing Foundation personnel's voice, has limited chronal and spatial abilities[[footnote]] such as creating non-Euclidean space, dilating relative time in a certain radius, creating timeloops, creating pocket dimensions, and extended lifespan.[[/footnote]], ██████████ and, although being relatively physically human, has an enhanced resistance to blunt damage in all areas of the body except the cranium, which is abnormally soft, and often compared to the fontanels of an infants skull. 
SCP-4298-N has been shown to exhibit extremely high intelligence, charisma, and very high hostility towards Foundation personnel.

**Termination:** SCP-4298-N was terminated by Senior Security Officer Attila Szabó at 4:18 PM local time after a containment breach which lasted forty-five minutes and killed eight personnel, including Junior Researchers Killian Havendoll and Carolina Manini, Senior Researcher Pietro Gabbani, Researcher Assistant Yves LeBlanc-Gandolfi, Medical Researcher Dr. Annalisa Fiammini and Senior Officers Anthony Ermani, Adamo Mastrosimone and Daniele Celauro.

[[collapsible show="Former description of SCP-4298" hide="Access Granted"]]SCP-4298 is an unspecified entity of unknown origins or containment procedures history that is located in Standard Humanoid Security Cell #546 in Containment Sector-87 of Site-446.
SCP-4298 has been described to be an unspecified entity by thermal scanners, even if mounted video surveillance tools  inside the cell haven’t been able to confirm the nature of the entity due to an internal malfunction. Attempts have been made to enter the cell, repair and retrieve the video surveillance equipment, encountering failure in the process of opening the door of the cell itself.
SCP-4298 has been noted to produce multiple human noises such as speech in the English language, suggesting the subject or the subjects inside are humans or humanoid in nature. Voices do appear to be identical to the one of Assistant Researcher Dr. Romagnoli, Assistant Researcher Luciana Amati and an unidentified voice referred by the two other voices as Field Researcher Dr. Robin Texas Walker, all talking about opening the door of cell #546, despite attempts were done to open the door containing the entities.
SCP-4298, due to the nature of the entity being unknown and the cell being unable to be opened, even for basic maintenance, cannot be given essential human treatment such as food or water. So far, no requests have been reported from the entity, besides.[[/collapsible]]

> 
> **[BEGIN LOG]**
> **Dr. Williams:** Please, identify yourself for the sake of this interview, and state the current date.
> 
> **Dr. Romagnoli:** My name’s Dr. M████ Romagnoli, and I am an Assistant Researcher of Site-446. Today's date is June 4th, 19██.
> 
> **Dr. Williams:** Dr. Romagnoli, do you have any clue why SCP-4298 was imitating your voice as well as Dr. Amati’s voice? Have you been around cell #546 before the containment breach?
> 
> **Dr. Romagnoli:** I honestly have no clue, nor any idea why SCP-4298 was imitating my voice, as I have never been in Containment Sector-87. Dr. ██████ and I are assigned to SCP-████, which is in Research Sector-21, pretty far from Containment Sector-87. I wasn’t even aware of the existence of SCP-4298 until the breach happened. I cannot even answer why, by what you tell, that thing was mimicking Dr. Amati's voice, I barely know that doctor.
> 
> **Dr. Williams:** SCP-4298 was conversing alone calling another voice Dr. Robin Texas Walker. Do you have any relation with such person the entity was claiming to speak to?
> 
> **Dr. Romagnoli:** I haven’t heard of anyone named that in my entire life. As I stated, I haven’t been in Containment Sector-87, nor I ever was near cell #546. Dr. ██████ always told me to not to go to Containment Sector-87 alone, as it is not fit for new assistant researchers, and Dr.[REDACTED] never went there.
> 
> **Dr. Williams:** Is it true that you were in the cafeteria when the breach happened? What were you doing in the cafeteria? What do you remember of SCP-4298?
> 
> **Dr. Romagnoli:** Well, I was taking a break along with Dr. ██████, as it was my birthday. Dr. Gandolfi was with me when that… thing entered the cafeteria. And I remember its look. How angry it looked, and was trying to say something, but all I understood were words like “stop shooting me” in an angry manner to the nearby Security Guard.. I saw that thing just [DATA EXPUNGED] to Dr. Gandolfi. It was gruesome. I saw my friend Yves get eviscerated in front of me with my very eyes. I was hiding, but I saw him and the still-living Dr. Gandolfi both become immobilized. It was like Dr. Gandolfi saw a ghost, and the same feeling would have been what that thing experienced, seeing as the both were immobile for a few seconds. After killing him, that thing moved away, I do not know where. Seeing the body of my closest friend lying on the ground, with his head detached from the rest of the body, in a devastated cafeteria place where your birthday was happening, placed upon the table where I was sitting along with him was… I do not know how to describe it. Terrible? I have no idea.

> **Dr. Williams:** Do you remember how SCP-4298 looked like?
> 
> **Dr. Romagnoli:** I do. I couldn't tell if it was a man or a woman, but it kind of reminded me of Dr. Milani, and its voice was in between a male one and a female one, even if very monotone. I cannot exactly remember its features correctly, but I can definitely say it was a-
