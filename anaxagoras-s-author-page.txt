title:Anaxagoras's Author Page
By popular demand, I've finally put together an author page!

This is not an in-universe document, for a couple of reasons. I'd like to include some explanations for my writing and articles that simply aren't possible in-universe, and the only Anaxagoras that maybe exists in the Foundationverse is actually a Chancellor in the Universiverse.

First, SCPs I have posted, in chronological order:
[[[SCP-833]]] — Charity Worms
[[[SCP-997]]] — Vermin Suppressor
[[[SCP-962]]] — Tower of Babble
[[[SCP-1088]]] — The Eternity Ward
[[[SCP-838]]] — The Dream Job
[[[SCP-1014]]] — Jonah Crusoe
[[[SCP-1700]]] — Debtshop
[[[SCP-1500]]] — Zachary Callahan
[[[SCP-1900]]] — Dr. Bryshevskiy's Book

If you've read my articles (You haven't? For shame!), you may have noticed some general stylistic consistencies. They tend to be rather short, SCPs tend not to be very deadly, and there tends to be a decent amount of research behind them. The research is because I feel it's always nice when you can learn something from an article. For instance, I learned from 087 to take the elevator. And now for some notes on my articles, my thought processes, and other things:
[[collapsible show="A brief history of Anaxagoras" hide="Briefer, please"]]
I've been reading this site for years. I found it long ago, back in the halcyon days of high school, and was immediately hooked. I don't remember where I was first linked to it; possibly TVTropes, possibly not. In short order, I read the whole list (a feat that was much easier in those days). My favorite articles back then were [[[SCP-035]]] and [[[SCP-342]]]. The site was more inconsistent then, but I have a certain amount of nostalgia for the less enforced structure and kookier articles.

I've always thought of myself as a good writer, but I'm lazy and a perfectionist. Every word must be right, every sentence perfectly constructed. As you can imagine, this takes a while, which is where the laziness kicks in. I've also tried to maintain a fairly small internet presence, so I didn't join the site. But I continued to read it regularly, as the mass edit was conducted and, er, seafood became harder to buy.

College helped with my weaknesses as a writer, forcing me to be faster and more confident, as well as purging the bloviating that plagued my writing through high school. When my hard drive crashed the summer of 2011 without me having any backups, I chose to treat this not as a calamity, but rather as an opportunity to begin new era in my computer use. Except not quite that grandiose. And so, I joined the site I'd been reading for three or four years, and here we are today.

I have a somewhat nonstandard view of the Foundation and the universe it inhabits. First off, the supernatural is not the best kept secret. Consider: The Foundation may try to keep the general populace from learning about the paranormal, but they aren't the only force out there. Many other groups of interest have no problem letting random people know about the things man was not meant to know. Clever enough? Rich enough? Curious enough? You'll be able to figure it out, and the Foundation doesn't have any easy way to know that you know.

Similarly, the Foundation itself is not a perfect secret. Most of the other GoIs know about, along with most governments, and they aren't all as secretive. It's ludicrous for any secret organization to operate without the knowledge and consent of the world's major governments. Similarly, it's kind of silly for a secret organization to have more resources than, say, the US government.

Consequently, I view the Foundation as being something like a cross between NIH and special forces. The Foundation has to do a ludicrously broad array of things, and as a result, even with extensive subcontracting (utterly unavoidable), they still can't have much depth. They must have respectable research in nearly every field, including some that they can't recruit anyone with a background in. They must have elaborate and nonstandard facilities at numerous locations across the globe, and have a moderate military capability.

With this many different things it must be able to do, my Foundation can't do any of them at a particularly superior degree of capability. It's also crippled by its secrecy, dangerousness, and moral ambiguity, both of which make recruiting the best a much harder task. It's worse at nearly every research field than top-tier research facilities that specialize in that field. Its agents are well-trained, but tragically few. The only advantage it has is technological, thanks to advances gleaned from studying anomalous objects.

To counteract this, the Foundation has been growing more and more rapidly. And it still tries to remain secret. The problem is, with modern advances in communications technology, and the difficulty of quashing information once it gets out onto the internet, secrecy is soon becoming impossible. Soon, very soon, the public will learn of the existence of the paranormal, because it would be ludicrous for them not to. Class A amnesiacs can only go so far. Whether the Foundation has planned for this or not remains to be seen.

As for the Foundation itself, it's important to remember that it's made up of people like you or I. Not all the researchers are like Dr. Gears. Hell, Dr. Gears isn't like Dr. Gears, if you've read his profile and early stories with him in it. You can't make an organization as massive as the Foundation as cruel and ruthless as it is sometimes portrayed as being. The reason why certain dictatorships can grow so vast is because people live in a sea of propaganda. In contrast, the Foundation is dealing with people who would probably react like you would to callous sacrifice of lives for trivial gain. There aren't many Mengeles out there. Additionally, even the most repressive organizations have defectors, and to remain secret, the Foundation can hardly afford any.

This is not to say the Foundation isn't powerful and ruthless. Only the GOC may wield more direct power among the GoI, and the Foundation is willing to do terrible things for the greater good. But they are far from omnipotent, and when they make hard decisions, they are indeed hard.

To the average citizen in the Foundationverse, there are rumors of the supernatural far beyond those present in our world. With enough effort, it's possible to pierce the veil of secrecy and discover what the Foundation would prefer you didn't. Of course, the lengths to which you'd probably need to go would probably distance you from everyone but those who already know, so at least the information wouldn't spread. There are plentiful rumors of the men in black, but they're highly contradictory, considering the existence of at least three opposing organizations whose agents are being described.

It's a mad world, but it's intact for now. Still, when the time bomb of public knowledge of the paranormal goes off, all bets are off.

[[collapsible show="SCP-833 commentary" hide="SCP-833 commentary"]]
My very first SCP. I didn't have a sandbox, because I thought then that you needed three successful articles to make one, so I made a [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-373927/first-scp-idea:altruism-roundworms thread] in which to run the idea by the community. I'd like to thank thedeadlymoose for having aided and advised me since the very start of my tenure here.

I would say this one turned out fairly well. Some things in the writing are awkwardly phrased, and I'm still not sure about Addendum 833-3, but the interview turned out okay, and the concept I think is a strong one. In my eyes, this one isn't actually anomalous, just strange enough that the Foundation wants to keep it contained.

[[collapsible show="SCP-997 commentary" hide="SCP-997 commentary"]]
This one started out in my head as a "better mousetrap". I had this idea a few weeks before I joined the site, and in its original form it was an object that drove out all mice and rats in a large area, and that the Foundation gradually discovered was something far, far more horrible. The object class would have been --Safe-- --Euclid-- Keter. This seemed on review to be a bit silly, so the idea eventually evolved into this. A little bit of it also lived on in 962 in the whole "only dangerous to nonhumans" bit. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemispatial_neglect Neglect] is a real thing, and it's one of the creepier things I know of. You know something, but your consciousness refuses to be aware of it.

The rest of the test log is redacted in-universe because the Foundation figured out that this thing can also function as a powerful mind control device under the right circumstances. I'm reasonably satisfied with how this ended up.
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="SCP-962 commentary" hide="SCP-962 commentary"]]
My most popular article. This one also started out rather differently, as a medium-sized robot that ate nature and excreted literature. This was, shall we say, poorly received in chat. After some revisions, it ended up in more or less the current form, but without the rant component. I was on the fence about adding that one, and a big thank you to all those people in the thread who told me I should.

One thing I like about 962 is the object class. It has never harmed anyone, even in self-defense. Yet it's also demonstrated capabilities that indicate that if it changed its mind on that, we might all be screwed. Pair that with a less than stable (and fun to write) form of insanity, and you have something awfully dangerous for something that really, really likes you. Also, I like how it's one of the most easily visible objects the Foundation contains, and how its sheer size makes containment a bit trickier.

[[collapsible show="SCP-1088 commentary" hide="SCP-1088 commentary"]]
This was for a time my worst and least favorite article. I made this one for the 1000 contest based on an urban legend someone alluded to in the contest thread. But the original version of the article had no hook whatsoever. It was just something horrible, and horribleness isn't interesting. It wasn't until someone brought up the baby living that I figured out what I now think is actually a pretty decent hook. I think this article kind of got forgotten, thanks to its prehook form.

Incidentally, this also contains my only use of [DATA EXPUNGED] or [REDACTED] in any of my articles. Though it is of the squick-concealing variety, I think it's a reasonable use of one, all things considered.

[[collapsible show="SCP-838 commentary" hide="SCP-838 commentary"]]
This went through two prior iterations. One is the first version I posted, where you didn't get paid, getting fired did nothing, and it gave you bad sleep deprivation. That one was kind of blah. The version before that, which mercifully existed only in my head, was a skyscraper that stalked you and eventually devoured you. Glad I didn't post that one. In it's final form, this is one of my favorite articles, because the analogy came through so clearly and nicely. The title really sums the whole thing up so nicely.
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="SCP-1014 commentary" hide="SCP-1014 commentary"]]
Right now, this is probably my least favorite article of mine. It just doesn't have a hook, and I'm not sure if it makes any sense under examination. The closest thing to a hook is the repeated ominous phrase in different languages, but that's honestly kind of dull. The main thing I like about this is how it's going extinct because it's schtick (sinking wooden ships) has become obsolete.

[[collapsible show="SCP-1700 commentary" hide="SCP-1700 commentary"]]
Fun Anaxagoras fact of the day: most names I use in articles are combinations of the first and last names of different people I know. Or find when randomly searching the internet.

This article attracted a bit of controversy in chat and in its thread over the decision by the Foundation to not even bother trying to contain SCP-1700-A. My logic is that there are potentially millions of them scattered all over the world, and that they're indistinguishable from mundane scarves, at least to someone without knowledge of the supernatural. It would be impossible for the Foundation to search the house of literally everyone who could have bought one or been given one even without bothering with secrecy. Even if they could somehow, it would cost such a prohibitive amount of resources, it just wouldn't be worth it. Besides, SCP-1700-A aren't terribly visibly anomalous.

As for the article itself, I feel the interesting thing is that we have some fully human SCP creators in custody. Since the change to SCP-100, that I believe makes SCP-1700. I was going for some banality of evil with the interview. Bland's comment midway down the first page of comments sums up exactly what I was going for. Might the Foundation have filed this as two objects? Possibly. But we're telling stories here, not working for a nebulous secret organization. I think.

[[collapsible show="SCP-1500 commentary" hide="SCP-1500 commentary"]]
The hardest part of writing this one was coming up with the cover story. It had to be something that could be left alone, would be placed in a secure cell, and that no one would try to rescue or mercy kill. Someone in chat suggested the plant thing, which worked out great. I put at least as much thought into writing the cover story as the truth. I deliberately violate some rules of writing humanoid SCPs, especially in the last paragraph. The containment procedures are designed to come across as a little bit off. I want someone confused and suspicious by the time they click on the concealed part. The pun at the end of the cover story is deliberate. I couldn't resist.

I, just for fun, came up with a sketch of the origin of this thing, and threw in a couple fairly subtle hints to it in the article. I had meant this to be an easter egg for myself, but I let slip that there was something hidden in the article, and people responded as I should have figured they would. The easter egg is now an omelet, and so an origin story is forthcoming.

[[collapsible show="SCP-1900 commentary" hide="SCP-1900 commentary"]]
I did a lot of research on this one, and it has a lot of stuff I like. The concept is cool, the implications are creepy, and I had so much fun writing the letter. But there's an elephant in the room with this one, that was brought up by everyone I described this to: What's the mechanism for human-computer or computer-human transmission? I still haven't been able to come up with a satisfying answer to that, and that's the main thing that's holding this article back. The other thing that might be hurting this article's rating is the title. Quick, without looking up, try to spell it.

[[collapsible show="Mr. Headless commentary" hide="Mr. Headless commentary"]]
One day in chat I receive a message from Salmander asking me if I want to be a part of his secret project. I accept, and am told that it's a Canterbury Tales style collection of stories about the Little Misters, as they each journey in search of Mr. Redd, who's shtick is that he's poorly defined right now. I chose three Misters — Moon, Headless, and Thin. Mr. Thin never got written. I wanted to do him as a poem, but I couldn't get it to work.

This was actually the second story I wrote, just a few hours after Mr. Moon. I decided to take a very straightforward approach to Mr. Headless. The stories of the headless horseman actually didn't occur to me until well after this was posted. I think the old fashioned creepypasta writing style works well on this one.

This one was chosen to be the lead-off for the series, which was posted one per day over about three weeks. Unfortunately, I was off chat for a few days, so Salmander wasn't able to inform me, so he posted it himself. That's why I'm not technically the author, even though I am the writer.

[[collapsible show="Mr. Moon commentary" hide="Mr. Moon commentary"]]
Mr. Moon always bothered me. He, alone of the original Little Misters, had a power that was entirely a drawback. And not even a very interesting one either. He was just an old man who was blind half the time. I also wanted one of the stories in the collection to be about an SCP already in containment. The idea came to me quickly, and then it was simply a matter of putting it in a story with the right tone. It's short, but I think I did a good job at capturing the essence of Mr. Moon as he should be. This is one of my favorite articles.
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="Epilogue commentary" hide="Epilogue commentary"]]
I decided to add this fairly late to the Tales. Seeing as this is a fairly major addition to the lore of the Little Misters, I ran this by Sal and Dexa first. I hate second person, and I'm not too big on present tense, but they seem like the only good option here. In the first draft of this, I placed the two twists far closer together, but I'm happy with the spacing now.

[[collapsible show="Address to the Students and Faculty commentary" hide="Address to the Students and Faculty commentary"]]
I researched the crap out of this one. Almost everything in there is a reference to some actual piece of Greek philosophy. They weren't all forward-thinking advocates of democracy. I also had some fun constructing the arguments the Chancellor (probably Anaxagoras) uses here. Some of them are fallacious for rather different reasons than they would be in our universe. I wrote this at about the time there was a surge of popularity for Alexylva-related articles, in an attempt to flesh out the Universiverse and give some idea what was going on over there besides the production of creepy artifacts.

[[collapsible show="On the O5's Secret Service commentary" hide="On the O5's Secret Service"]]
This isn't very good. I didn't self-delete it because I think there's some good lines, but honestly, it's not too good. The main thing I like about this is the use of SCPs. Self-defense sugar is a cool item that fit well, and just consider what SCP he kills in this. What number should it be?

[[collapsible show="Gods of Money commentary" hide="Gods of Money commentary"]]
I wrote this way back in high school after I got bored in econ class and combined fiat currency with the notion that gods derive their power from the faith of their believers. It's a cool idea, and it could probably get a better execution than this, but it's what I wrote.

I originally posted this to the SCP wiki, but it was considered to have too little to do with the Foundation and I was told to repost it over to the Serpent's Library wiki. A pity how empty that place is. But what is there is generally quite good.
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="Ideas I want to work" hide="The brilliance blinds me!"]]
I've posted some drafts for ideas I think have potential but don't know how to work [http://sandbox.scp-wiki.net/anaxagoras-s-shelf here]. All of these could be great, but currently suffer from crippling problems.

For the Moccasins, I think the log is quite strong, but the article itself is a bit on the weak side. But I really want to make the core of an SCP college sports team work. I have a few ideas. I'm keeping the eldritch horror for sure.

Fringe Theories is adapted from an article by someone who posted one rather cool article that had major tonal problems, then vanished. It might work as an 001; I don't know. I think that article is the closest of the three to prime time, but just a bit lacking in some way.

The Invisible Fist has a really clever name, and I like the idea of a Keter that poses only an economic threat, albeit an existential one. But like SCP-1900, the mechanism is too poorly defined, and the thing itself is a bit bland and unstoppable. I think I don't know enough about the stock market to be able to write this article just yet, but I will one of these days.
