**Item #:** SCP-1602

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** As it only exhibits anomalous qualities when spread out, SCP-1602 must remain folded a minimum of 5 times when not undergoing testing. When SCP-1602 is removed from its container to undergo testing or cleaning, no fewer than three personnel are to be in a room with it at any given time. It is currently kept at Storage Site-██ inside a safety deposit box, secured with a standard combination lock. Researchers seeking to conduct additional tests involving SCP-1602 must have written approval from a Level-3 staff member before removing the item from containment. 

All instances of SCP-1602-B are to be terminated by security personnel after research staff has made sufficient notes regarding its behavior, with remains incinerated after autopsy. 

**Description:** SCP-1602 is a plastic shower curtain patterned with stylized sea turtles. When it is spread and placed in a room with a single human subject, SCP-1602 will enter its active state. If these conditions are not met (e.g. SCP-1602 is compressed or folded, or there is more than one person present), it will remain dormant until such time that it is spread and all additional parties leave the room.

Once SCP-1602 has entered its active state, a faint light will appear roughly 3m behind the side of SCP-1602 opposite to the subject. This phenomenon will still occur even when SCP-1602 is placed against a wall or other solid object, as SCP-1602 appears to generate an extradimensional space behind it when active. 5 to 30 minutes after activation, an instance of SCP-1602-A will be generated, its silhouette visible behind the curtain. SCP-1602-A will remain stationary for a brief period before drawing back SCP-1602 and approaching the subject. Pre-test counseling sessions conducted with D-Class subjects has shown that instances of SCP-1602-A take on forms that are representative of the subject's insecurities (see Experiment Log). 

If an additional party enters the room to intervene, SCP-1602-A and any traces of its existence will instantly vanish and SCP-1602 will reenter its dormant state. If left uninterrupted, SCP-1602-A will restrain the subject and force them to return with it behind SCP-1602. Instances of SCP-1602-A have consistently proven capable of outrunning,  overpowering, and subduing the subject through nonlethal means. Once the subject has been taken behind SCP-1602, SCP-1602-A will draw the curtain and SCP-1602 will reenter its dormant state, causing SCP-1602-A to disappear along with the captured subject. 

In 88% of tests conducted, SCP-1602 will spontaneously reactivate 10 to 60 minutes after the subject's disappearance. It will then generate an instance of SCP-1602-B, which are identical to the most recent version of SCP-1602-A except that they will not disappear when viewed by a person other than the subject. SCP-1602-B can be easily terminated with a standard firearm, even in cases where there is no discernible reason for its animation.

[REDACTED FOR BREVITY]

__**Test 1602-5**__
**Subject:** D-1602-5, a Caucasian male, age 20. During conversations with on-site counsellor Dr. ██████, subject confessed that he that had coerced his girlfriend into having an abortion. Subject expressed profound feelings of regret surrounding this event.
**Procedure:** SCP-1602 hung on a plastic shower rod suspended from the ceiling in the middle of the test chamber. Subject was instructed walk around SCP-1602 and view the other side once it entered an active state.
**Results:** SCP-1602 entered an active state after approximately 5 minutes, consistent with activation time in previous tests. The subject noticed a faint light emanating from behind SCP-1602 and walked around to view the other side. Subject reported that upon viewing the other side, SCP-1602 apparently reentered its dormant state: the light vanished and was no longer visible from either side of SCP-1602. No other anomalous activity reported.


__**Test 1602-6**__
**Subject:** D-1602-5, same as previous test.
**Procedure:** SCP-1602 hung on a plastic shower rod suspended from the ceiling in the middle of the test chamber. Subject was instructed to stand in place and observe only one side of SCP-1602.
**Results:** SCP-1602 again entered an active state after approximately 5 minutes. 10 minutes and 23 seconds into the test, a small, undefined silhouette appeared at the base of the curtain. An instance of SCP-1602-A (SCP-1602-A6) emerged precisely 3 minutes later, taking the form of a newly born child covered in vernix caseosa and blood. SCP-1602-A6 crawled out from beneath the curtain in the direction of the subject. 

Upon observing SCP-1602-A6, the subject screamed and stumbled backward, losing balance and collapsing on the floor. Additional instances of SCP-1602-A6 continued to emerge; many of these were identical to the original instance, but 22% of duplicates had umbilical cords trailing behind them. Acting as a group, SCP-1602-A6 converged on the subject. Subject fought back but was overpowered by SCP-1602-A6 and was subsequently dragged behind the curtain, followed by all remaining SCP-1602-A6.

A single instance of SCP-1602-B6 emerged after 15 minutes. Autopsy confirmed that its anatomy was consistent with that of a typical infant, although its internal organs were found filled with live maggots. Samples of the maggots were preserved and placed in storage.

**Additional:** Any traces of vernix caseosa and blood left on the floor by SCP-1602-A6 ceased to exist the moment Research staff entered the room.
//Note: The presence of multiple instances of SCP-1602-A at one time suggests that SCP-1602-A are entities generated each time SCP-1602 enters an active state, rather than a single entity that assumes different forms, as had been previously theorized. - Dr. Lindquist//


__**Test 1602-7**__
**Subject:** D-1602-6, a Hispanic female, age 33. Subject had a history of bulimia and self-image disorders.
**Procedure:** SCP-1602 placed in a spread position against the wall of the test chamber with a mild adhesive.
**Results:** Subject exhibited high levels of anxiety and panic upon SCP-1602 entering its active state, repeating the phrase, "I can't do this." This pattern of behavior continued until SCP-1602-A7 appeared behind SCP-1602, at which point subject began banging on the wall opposite to SCP-1602 while shouting incoherently. 

SCP-1602-A7 pulled back the curtain, revealing a cavity in the wall that had not previously existed. SCP-1602-A7 was identical to the subject in height and race, but appeared to possess no muscular tissue whatsoever, with skin stretched directly over its bones and ligaments. Lack of musculature notwithstanding, SCP-1602-A7 still possessed a high level of mobility and strength, grabbing the subject by the ankles and pulling the subject behind the curtain.

An instance of SCP-1602-B5 emerged within 5 minutes of the subject's disappearance. SCP-1602-B5 was observed to claw at its own body, its jaw fully extended but making no vocalizations. Researchers called for termination after 4 minutes of observation. Autopsy deemed unnecessary as SCP-1602-B5 had peeled back most of its own skin, confirming its lack of muscle tissue. Retrieval of SCP-1602 showed the wall to be in the same condition as it had been at the beginning of the test. 

__**Test 1602-8**__
**Subject:** D-1602-7, a Caucasian male, age 58. Subject had been a high-ranking employee of ████████, a Fortune 500 company, prior to incarceration. Dr. ██████, who provided counseling for the subject in the weeks prior to testing, noted that the subject expressed significant frustration over the fact that his dedication to his work had led to his estrangement with his children and ex-wife. 
**Procedure:** SCP-1602 placed on the floor in a spread position. 
**Results:** SCP-1602's horizontal orientation did not appear to alter its effects, activating within the standard timeframe. SCP-1602-A8 emerged from beneath it, climbing from a perfectly round hole in the floor that had not existed prior to SCP-1602's activation. SCP-1602-A8 took the form of a clown in a loose, polka-dotted suit. While its body seemed to be that of a natural human, its head was disproportionally large and made from what appeared to be papier-mâché, with areas of the face cut out in locations where prominent facial features would typically be (eyes, nose, ears, etc.). A reflective substance (later confirmed to be confetti) poured continuously from these orifices for the entire duration of the test.

This test marks the first time an instance of SCP-1602-A has made vocalizations, despite its lack of visible means of articulation. SCP-1602-A8 approached the subject very slowly, repeatedly expressing a desire to 'play' and encouraging the subject to 'loosen up and live a little'. Subject attempted to engage SCP-1602-A8 in conversation, making numerous inquiries about its nature, albeit with a significant amount of profanity.

34 minutes after the subject's capture, SCP-1602-B8 was generated and proceeded to stumble around the room in a state of extreme distress. Like SCP-1602-A8, it made numerous vocalizations, though most of its statements were requests to see Dr. Lindquist and questions regarding its own nature.

The following is the subsequent exchange between SCP-1602-B8 and Dr. Lindquist.

> **<Begin Log>**
>  
> **Dr. Lindquist:** We'll start by confirming your identity. What is your name?
>  
> **SCP-1602-B8:** (//Confetti still pouring from its facial orifices//) [REDACTED].
> 
> **Dr. Lindquist:** What are the names of your children?
>  
> **SCP-1602-B8:** [REDACTED]. What's happened to me?
> 
> **Dr. Lindquist:** Please remain calm and answer the questions. Do you have any pets?
> 
> **SCP-1602-B8:** I have a Great Dane named Dorothy. Please, Doctor, I need help, I'm blind and—
> 
> **Dr. Lindquist:** What did you see after you were taken behind the curtain?
> 
> **SCP-1602-B8:** I didn't see anything. What's happened to my face? Why am I blind? What did that [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] clown do to me?
> 
> **Dr. Lindquist:** That's what we're trying to figure out. We want to help you, but you need to answer our questions. Did SCP-1602-A8 say anything to you after—
> 
> **SCP-1602-B8:** You're a [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] liar! You let that thing do this to me! For the love of God, Doctor, what's it done to me? Why can't I see anything? Why is everything so cold? Why does my head feel so. . . (//SCP-1602-B8 raises its hands to its face and makes vocalizations similar to weeping.//)
> 
> **Dr. Lindquist:** Please try to remain calm. I only have a few more questions—
> 
> **SCP-1602-B8:** (//Still weeping//) Nothing's changed. Nothing's changed. 
>  
> **<End Log>**
>  
> **Closing Statement:** SCP-1602-B8 refused to respond to any further questioning and was terminated shortly after interview. It is unknown if D-1602-8 was physically transmuted into SCP-1602-B8, if the subject's consciousness was transferred, or if SCP-1602-B8 was impersonating the subject. Much of the confetti produced by SCP-1602-B8 was incinerated, with a small amount stored in a small plastic container and placed in storage.

Further testing with SCP-1602 has been suspended indefinitely at the request of Dr. Lindquist.
