**Name:** Ivan Petrovich Derinsky

**Security Clearence:** Level 2

**Affiliation:** Department of Extra-Universal Affairs

**Position:** MUTA-NT Aperture Stability and Universe Habitability Technician
- Containment Specialist (retired)

**Site of Operations:** Site 87

**Profile:** Derinsky was born in Потёмкиногорск, Karelo-Finnish SSR, designated NEXUS-14 for its regular physics violations, extreme political credulity, and abnormally high rate of bureaucratic error. He received extended 5-year training in electrical and radio engineering during his mandatory military service. Derinsky was identified and recruited during an early [[[scp-2477|SCP-2477]]] incident, spending the next ██ years as a Containment Specialist focusing in spatial and temporal anomalies.

Due to repeated exposure to anomalies under containment breach conditions or lacking safety equipment, Derinsky has been subject to dozens of temporal contractions, dilations, reversals, timeline excisions, divergences and re-convergences, and has been listed as MIA for multiple extended periods. As a result, his personal chronology and biological age are essentially impossible to determine.

> //Yes, Petro is completely ignorant of current events, political realities, popular culture, cell phones, the internet... pretty much all of it. Unfortunately, I'm having trouble determining how much of this is RVW Effect[[footnote]]Rip Van Winkle Effect, the diagnosable lack of era- and timeline-appropriate knowledge.[[/footnote]] and how much is based on compounding factors. These include his --being an obstinate yokel-- rural upbringing and attitudes, --spending 60% of the time half-lit on reactor coolant-- probable high-functioning alcoholism, and --singular focus on getting on my nerves-- distrust of modern "Western" psychological practice. See if a neurological and biological assay tells us anything, and if that doesn't work just push him through the system. He's cleared all standard batteries and does not otherwise pose a risk. - Dr. Alger, Class-E Evaluation and Rehabilitation Specialist//

Derinsky was forced to retire in 2010 in spite of excellent health due to Human Resources policy. He requested and was granted a part-time Knowledge Retention Assignment to Site 87, where he uses his familiarity with spacetime instability and 70's-era Foundation electronics to attempt to ensure that nobody undergoes catastrophic eversion when utilizing the Multi-Universal Transit Array.
