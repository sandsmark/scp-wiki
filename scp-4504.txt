**Item #:** SCP-4504
 
**Object Class:** Keter
 
**Document Current as of 17/09/2019**
 
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4504 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██, with a secondary containment cell kept empty in readiness for an attempted containment breach. SCP-4504’s primary and secondary cells and the immediate corridors around them are to be fitted with Halothane gas dispersal systems, which should be activated immediately if SCP-4504 attempts to breach containment.
 
In the event the Halothane dispersal system is insufficient to incapacitate SCP-4504, staff are to avoid entering its reach and instead should attempt to incapacitate it from a distance using flash-bang grenades, stun grenades and Halothane gas grenades. Staff are to avoid engaging SCP-4504 with kinetic weapons, water cannons, standard-issue tasers and pepper spray. Staff approaching after it has been incapacitated should do so cautiously, as SCP-4504 has feigned unconsciousness in the past in order to lure security staff close enough to strike them. 
 
SCP-4504 is to be spoonfed two 50mg ███████ tablets twice daily in order to treat its chronic pain and maintain its mental health. Medical staff are to ensure that the tablets have been swallowed before leaving the containment cell.

As of 29/11/2017 Site Director Sandoval has ended testing with SCP-4504 in order to prevent future staff casualties. SCP-4504 is no longer allowed socialisation privileges. In the event that SCP-4504 displays non-compliant behaviour, staff should remind it that it will lose leisure privileges if it continues in that behaviour.
 
**Description:** SCP-4504 (Formerly known as Dennis Huang) is a thirty-five year old Chinese-Australian human male. As a result of its use of its anomalous abilities on itself, SCP-4504 stands 2.64m tall, possessing distorted features and greatly elongated limbs. These distortions render it resistant to both kinetic impacts and extreme pain. SCP-4504 is missing both of its hands as a result of an encounter with [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-082|SCP-082]]] during a previous containment breach.

SCP-4504 can manifest two invisible ‘hands’ at the ends of its arms. Their shape is proportionate to SCP-4504’s distorted body, each ‘palm’ approximately 20cm in diameter and each ‘finger’ being between 45cm and 60cm in length. These ‘hands’ warp space, allowing SCP-4504 to mould solid objects it touches with them as if they were only semi-solid. SCP-4504 can manipulate any solid physical substance it touches with them, including glass, stone, steel, lead, beryllium bronze and flesh, as they distort the space containing the substance as opposed to acting on the substance itself. Affected substances are rendered sturdier and more solid than they once were, making them difficult to break or damage with kinetic strikes. SCP-4504 cannot interact with solid objects with its manifested hands without distorting them. SCP-4504’s hands have reduced effect on non-solids such as liquids or gases.
 
Currently, there is no known way to reverse these distortions in space. Attempts by SCP-4504 to repair affected areas simply create a second, overlapping distortion. Staff and test subjects whose bodies have been affected by SCP-4504 report extreme, chronic pain to the affected area. Affected areas of flesh will continue to function as normal unless the distortion disconnects parts of the subject’s body or exposes internal organs. Foundation medical staff have found conventional painkillers to be only partially effective in mitigating the subsequent pain.
 
SCP-4504 readily admits to a deep-seated hatred of the Foundation, particularly its security personnel and past psychiatrists. SCP-4504 has repeatedly expressed a desire to escape containment. To date it has attempted to breach containment 83 times, resulting in four successful escapes from Site-██. During its more recent containment breaches, SCP-4504 has not attempted to flee the facility, instead seeking out and maiming specific members of Foundation staff it bears a grudge against. These have typically been senior security officers who have made decisions about SCP-4504’s containment it objects to, such as restricting its contact with other humanoid SCP objects, interfering with its painkiller regimen or revoking its leisure privileges. To date, SCP-4504 has not harmed a member of on-site medical staff with the exception of its own psychiatrists, and has discouraged other humanoid SCP objects from doing so during containment breaches.

**Special Containment Procedures:** ##blue|SCP-4504 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. SCP-4504 must be fitted with Midas-class water cuffs before any transportation through the site, with the cuffs being removed upon arrival.##
 
##blue|To date, SCP-4504 has not harmed a member of Foundation staff. In the event of a potential containment breach, staff should remain out of reach of SCP-4504 and incapacitate it using pepper spray, standard-issue tasers and water cannons.##
 
##blue|As a result of good behaviour, SCP-4504 is currently allowed socialisation and leisure privileges.##
 
**Description:** ##blue|SCP-4504 (formerly known as Dennis Huang) is a twenty-five year old Chinese-Australian male standing 1.77m tall. SCP-4504 possesses the ability to warp space with its hands, moulding solid objects as if they were semi-solid. SCP-4504 can manipulate any solid substance it touches with them, including glass, stone, steel, [DATA REDACTED] and flesh, as the effect distorts space as opposed to acting on the substance itself. Affected substances are rendered sturdier and more solid than they once were, making them difficult to break or damage with kinetic strikes. SCP-4504 struggles to distort non-solids such as liquids or gases.##

At present, there is no known way to reverse these distortions in space. Attempts by SCP-4504 to repair the affected areas simply result in a second, overlapping distortion. Animals subjected to SCP-4504’s effect have reacted in ways indicating extreme pain and distress. However, the distortions do not impact the function of biological tissue they unless said distortion exposes internal organs or removes part of the flesh in whole. ##blue|SCP-4504 has refused to participate in testing on human subjects.##
 
SCP-4504 was acquired by the Foundation on 12/3/2008. Foundation agents detected a report of several small spatial distortions discovered in a shed in suburban Brisbane. The properties’ landlord directed them to SCP-4504, who had lived there previously. When apprehended by Foundation agents, SCP-4504 entered Foundation custody willingly and without resistance, believing them to be agents of ASIO.

> **Interviewed:** SCP-4504
> 
> **Interviewer:** Doctor Weber
> 
> **Foreword:** An excerpt from SCP-4504’s fortnightly interview with its appointed psychiatrist on 04/07/2008. SCP-4504 was reporting good mental health and often used these interviews to make formal requests regarding its containment. Two site security officers were also present.
> 
> **<Begin Log, 14:40>**
> 
> **Dr Weber:** I’m glad the plants are helping you, Dennis. We’re almost out of time, but when we were starting you mentioned you had another request.
> 
> **SCP-4504:** Uh, yeah. Look, I’m really grateful to you guys for keeping me safe like this. You explained to me about the dangers for people like me out there, with guys like the GOC or the, uh… Marshall… guys?
> 
> **Dr Weber:** Marshall, Carter & Dark?
> 
> **SCP-4504:** Yeah, the rich fucks. I get it. The P in SCP stands for protecting me as much as protecting the world from dangerous people like me. I get it.
> 
> **Dr Weber:** Dennis, we cannot give permission for you to leave Site-██.
> 
> **SCP-4504:** Aw, come on!
> 
> **Dr Weber:** I’m sorry but it’s simply not possible.
> 
> **SCP-4504:** Look, you said no to contact with family. Fine. You need to protect the Matrix, or normality, or whatever. Sure. But you can’t keep me locked up like this. I need to get out, to be outside.
> 
> **Dr Weber:** If you would like to request more time outside in the exercise area I’m sure we can-
> 
> **SCP-4504:** No I don’t want time in the exercise area!
> 
> //SCP-4504 leans forward out of its seat aggressively. Security staff instruct SCP-4504 to return to its seat and calm down.//
> 
> **SCP-4504:** Okay, okay. Look, I just- huh, I- the yard fucking sucks, okay? I go outside to stand on some fucking astroturf and run around in circles for an hour or two. I’m still surrounded by four concrete walls. I’m still standing on concrete no matter how much fake plastic shit you layer on top of it. And I’m still being stared at by the same fucking prison guards with guns. //SCP-4504 gestures to the attending security officers.// It’s depressing! I want to go somewhere where I can see the horizon. I wanna feel real grass under my feet. I wanna see an actual fucking tree, not just a potted plant in my room. Even- even if security just walks me around the outside of the facility walls, or something. Anything! I’m not a criminal, you shouldn’t treat me like this!
> 
> **Dr Weber:** I’m sorry Dennis, but we simply cannot take that risk. If you would like, we can discuss alternatives, like painting a horizon mural on the inside of the wall-
> 
> **SCP-4504:** Fuck! No! I don’t- look, it’ll be fine. I promise. I’ll do whatever you want. It only has to be for an hour or two, I’ll do exactly what the guards say-
> 
> **Dr Weber:** I’m sorry, Dennis. But its simply not possible. Was there anything else you wanted to discuss?
> 
> **SCP-4504:** Huh… No.
> 
> **Dr Weber:** Then we’re finished for the day. I’ll see you again next week.
> 
> **<End Log, 14:50>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** SCP-4504 was escorted back to its containment cell immediately afterwards. Shortly thereafter, it used its art supplies to deface the wall of its containment cell with the words “YOU'RE HERE FOREVER”. SCP-4504 was subsequently ordered to remove the vandalism by security staff. Per the advice of staff psychiatrist Dr Weber, the Site-██’s exercise area was closed for three days while staff painted a mural resembling the horizon on two walls.

> 
> **Purpose:** To determine the effects of SCP-4504’s anomaly on a living creature.
> 
> **Preparation:** The Sus Domesticus was restrained on a table with leather straps. Researchers Gosse and Al-Harthi were to observe the test through a one-way reinforced window.
>

> **Experiment:** //SCP-4504 is introduced to the testing chamber and is instructed to approach the subject, place its hand on it and use its anomaly. SCP-4504 hesitates. Research team prompts SCP-4504 to approach the subject. SCP-4504 expresses reluctance and is reminded that if it does not comply it will be reprimanded. SCP-4504 complies, placing its hand on the creature’s thigh and pushing into it.//

> //The subject immediately begins screaming and thrashing against its restraints. SCP-4504 retreats to the far corner of the room. The subject continues to scream, struggling hard enough to shake the table. SCP-4504 requests permission to leave the testing chamber, although this is not heard by the research team due to the subject’s volume. After twelve seconds, SCP-4504 repeats its request, loud enough to be heard.//

> //Research team instructs SCP-4504 to approach the table again and touch the subject, this time pushing its hand into its brain. SCP-4504 expresses distress and asks permission to leave the testing chamber. Research team reminds SCP-4504 that if it does not comply with instructions it will be reprimanded.//
> 
> //SCP-4504 re-approaches the table and moves to place its hand on the subject’s head. The creature twists its head around and bites SCP-4504 on the palm. SCP-4504 vocalises distress and retreats from the subject, holding its bleeding hand. Testing cancelled and SCP-4504 given permission to leave the testing chamber.//

> [END LOG]
> 
> **Closing Statement:** SCP-4504 was escorted to Site-██ infirmary by security staff. En route to the infirmary, SCP-4504 reported feeling faint and lost consciousness. This was likely a result of security staff following containment procedures and placing SCP-4504 in Midas water cuffs, preventing SCP-4504 from putting pressure on its wound. Research team reprimanded for improperly restraining the test participant.

Over the next 20 minutes, SCP-4504 was able to breach walls and floors using its anomaly, freeing thirteen other humanoid SCP objects. Although almost all were recontained, SCP-4504 and four other humanoid SCP objects breached containment and escaped from Site-██.
> 
> During the containment breach, SCP-4504 refused to use its anomaly on security staff even in situations where it would have directly benefited from it. It also attempted to discourage other humanoid SCP objects from harming staff, although this was ineffective in the case of SCPs-████ and -████, resulting in 16 casualties among site staff.

**Item #:** SCP-4504

**Object Class:** Euclid
 
**Document revised as of 14/01/2013. Staff should consult newest version for up-to-date containment procedures**
 
**Special Containment Procedures:** ##blue|SCP-4504 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The walls, door, floor and roof of SCP-4504’s cell are to be interwoven with a grid of live electrical wires. These wires should be permanently charged with the same voltage as a standard-issue taser, to prevent SCP-4504 from exiting its cell through the walls. The spaces in the grid should be no larger than 6cm by 6cm, to prevent SCP-4504 from reaching its hand through them.##
 
SCP-4504 must be fitted with Midas-class water cuffs before any transportation through the site. These cuffs are not to be removed until it returns to its cell.
 
In the event of a potential containment breach, staff should remain out of reach of SCP-4504 and incapacitate it using pepper spray, standard-issue tasers and water cannons.
 
##blue|On 28/11/2010, SCP-4504 breached containment and escaped in cooperation with 2 other humanoid SCP objects, evading recontainment for a period of 7 months. As such, SCP-4504 is denied socialisation privileges although leisure privileges may be provided to it dependant on good behaviour.##
 
**Description:** SCP-4504 (formerly known as Dennis Huang) is a twenty-eight year old Chinese-Australian male standing 1.77m tall. SCP-4504 possesses the ability to warp space with its hands, ‘moulding’ solid objects as if they were semi-solid. SCP-4504 can manipulate any solid substance it touches with them, including glass, stone, steel, [DATA REDACTED] and flesh, as the energy fields are distorting space as opposed to acting on the substance itself. Distorted substances are rendered sturdier and more solid than they once were, making them difficult to break or damage with kinetic strikes. SCP-4504 struggles to distort non-solids such as liquids or gases.
 
At present, there is no known way to reverse these distortions in space. Attempts by SCP-4504 to repair the distortions simply result in a second, overlapping distortion. Animals subjected to SCP-4504’s distortion effect have reacted in ways indicating extreme pain and distress. However, the distortions do not impact the function of biological tissue they unless said distortion exposes internal organs or removes part of the flesh wholesale.

> **Incident:** Over the course of the five days indicated, SCP-4504 attempted to breach containment of its cell nine times. Each time it failed, contacting one of the electric wires and receiving a painful shock. After the third, fifth, sixth and ninth attempted breaches SCP-4504 received treatment from medical staff for second-degree electrical burns.

> __**Incident Report 50/L**__
> **Date:** 21/06/2011
> 
> **Incident:** While in-transit to its first session with staff psychiatrist Dr Weber since re-entering containment, SCP-4504 attempted to breach containment by assaulting its security officers and fleeing from them while restrained with Midas-class water cuffs. Security officers swiftly subdued SCP-4504 using pepper spray and physical force.
> 
> At their discretion, security officers returned SCP-4504 to its cell, postponing its session with Dr Weber for another fortnight in order to discourage future attempts to breach containment. Site medical staff treated SCP-4504 in its cell for a concussion and two fractured ribs. Security staff reported negligible injuries.

> **Assisting Staff Member:** Dr Herman Weber
> 
> **Request:** SCP-4504 formally requests the holes in its cell caused by its breach attempts be repaired. SCP-4504 states that they often spark loudly causing him anxiety and difficulty falling asleep, and that they are unsafe to move around due to the electrical hazard.
> 
> **Response:** Request denied. We do not have another cell prepared to house SCP-4504 while repairs are made. The chance is too great that this is another attempt to breach containment, and those holes only exist because SCP-4504 attempted such in the first place. We reap what we sow. - //Site Director Sandoval//

> **Assisting Staff Member:** Dr Herman Weber
> 
> **Request:** SCP-4504 formally requests the re-instatement of its socialisation privileges. SCP-4504 states that the removal of these privileges for so long has caused it significant distress and that the return of its ability to converse with non-staff persons would be greatly beneficial to its mental health.
> 
> **Response:** Request denied. SCP-4504 has breached containment with the assistance of other humanoid SCP objects in the past. Allowing it this contact would inevitably lead to another attempted containment breach. SCP-4504 will have to content itself with conversations with security staff and its assigned psychiatrist. - //Site Director Sandoval//

SCP-4504 was careful to avoid the tip of its finger so as to not distort its own flesh. Security staff believe testing to see if it could distort parts of its own body is the reason why SCP-4504 has been refusing to allow medical staff to cut its hair or nails for the past several months. Senior Security Officer ██████ recommends medical staff cut SCP-4504’s fingernails at the next opportunity.

> **Response:** Senior Nurse ████████ cannot authorise the cutting of SCP-4504’s nails. The nature of SCP-4504’s anomaly makes interacting with its hands without its consent unwise at best. If left alone, it is likely that SCP-4504’s nails will break on their own or SCP-4504 will ask staff to assist it cut its nails.

> **Incident:** At 1220 hours while eating lunch at the Site-██ cafeteria, SCP-4504 was overheard by security staff discussing the layout of Site-██ with SCP-███. Security staff immediately removed SCP-4504 from the cafeteria and returned it to its cell. Senior Security Officer ██████ recommends the immediate revocation of SCP-4504’s socialisation privileges.

> __**Containment Breach Report 79/P**__
>  
> **Date:** 10/08/2012
> 
> **Incident:** At 1350 hours SCP-4504 breached containment. While it was being transported by two site security officers to its fortnightly psychiatric session with Dr Weber, SCP-4504 covertly used its anomalous ability on itself, stretching out the ring finger on its right hand within the Midas-class water cuffs it was wearing. Once its finger was approximately 45cm in length, it used this finger to breach the Midas cuffs with its anomaly and slashed both security officers with it, killing them.
> 
> SCP-4504 then extended its ring finger to over 1.3 metres in length and proceeded to the nearby humanoid containment cells. It maimed and killed the security officers it found there and freed the contained SCP objects, initiating a site-wide containment breach.
> 
> Although most of the freed SCP objects were re-captured, SCP-4504 succeeded in escaping the site along with SCP-████, SCP-████ and SCP-████.
> 
> Mobile Task Force Epsilon 10 (“Manhunters”) have been assigned to pursue the escaped anomalies.

At the time of the interview, it had been three years since SCP-4504 was returned to containment after its most recent successful containment breach. Two site security officers were also present.
> 
> **<Begin Log, 14:30>**
> 
> **SCP-4504:** Please! I can’t take it anymore.
> 
> **Dr Weber:** Now Dennis, you’re exaggerating. We talked about “awfulizing” thought patterns. You have to be mindful of your mental illness-
> 
> **SCP-4504:** It’s not a fucking mental illness!
> 
> //SCP-4504 struck the table between Dr Weber and itself with its fists. The attending security officers intervened, warning SCP-4504 that if didn’t calm down it would be returned to its containment cell.//
> 
> **SCP-4504:** Sorry, sorry. But it’s not a fucking illness! I don’t have depression! The reason I’m fucked up is I haven’t talked to another human being in three. Years. Three years!-
> 
> **Dr Weber:** Now, Dennis-
> 
> **SCP-4504:** No! Listen! For once, just listen! Huhhh. //SCP-4504 pauses for four seconds.// I spend all day everyday locked in a tiny little concrete room. The only times I even see other people are when the guards bring me my food, and they aren’t exactly conversationalists. I can’t remember the last time I got to talk to someone who listens. I can’t remember the last time I saw the sky. Because I’ve been standing on concrete constantly for the last… God I can’t even remember how long its been since you first locked me up. Because I’ve been standing on concrete 24/7 since then my feet are in constant agony. Animals at the zoo get treated better than me! They get whole enclosures to roam around in, full of soft grass and beautiful plants under the open sky-
> 
> **Dr Weber:** Dennis you’re being irrational. You have plants in your room, as well as the rest of your leisure privileges-
> 
> **SCP-4504:** Three potted plants and an Xbox don’t make up for a total lack of human contact!
> 
> **Dr Weber:** Dennis, remain calm, or you will be returned to your cell. //Dr Weber pauses for five seconds.// Good. Now let’s see what we can do to help you. If you’re suffering from chronic foot pain, we can discuss options to help with that. We can provide you with softer slippers and carpeted mats for your containment cell-
> 
> **SCP-4504:** Can I go back to my cell? I’d like to go back to my cell.
> 
> **Dr Weber:** Dennis, we still have twenty minutes remaining. Please don’t interrupt me, it’s very rude-
> 
> //SCP-4504 rises from its chair and overturns the table between it and Dr Weber. The attending security officers respond, subduing SCP-4504 with pepper spray and tasers. Dr Weber exits the room. Site security officers then escort SCP-4504 back to its containment cell.//

SCP-4504 has stated that it has developed chronic foot pain as a result of standing on Site-██’s concrete floors. It is the opinion of its assigned psychiatrist that granting this request will assist with SCP-4504’s mental health.

> 
> **Incident:** At 1440 hours after being provided with its requested mats and slippers in its cell, SCP-4504 moved to the wall of its containment cell and attempted a containment breach. It made contact with an electrical wire and received a painful shock. After a moment’s hesitation, it contacted the same wire again, receiving another painful electric shock. It then contacted the wire five more times. Security officers entered SCP-4504’s containment cell and moved it away from the wire, subduing it with pepper spray when SCP-4504 struggled against them. SCP-4504 repeatedly vocalised that it wanted to die.
> 
> **Response:** SCP-4504 was transported to Site-██ infirmary where it received treatment for second-degree electrical burns. Once its initial treatment was complete and its cell had been repaired, it was returned there to prevent a possible containment breach from within the infirmary. Security officers were instructed to respond immediately if SCP-4504 attempted self-harm or a containment breach again. An emergency meeting with its assigned psychiatrist Dr Weber was arranged immediately.

> 
> **Dr Weber:** What the devil is the matter with you?
> 
> **SCP-4504:** It’s the suicide watch. I can’t- the guards come in every half an hour to check on me. They shout at me when they do and say I gotta answer- like with words, answer them with words, to make sure I’m not- not dying or nothing. But they keep- they come in every half an hour, even when I’m trying to sleep. They keep waking me up, I haven’t got more than half an hour’s sleep for a week. It’s really fucking with my head.
> 
> **Dr Weber:** I’m sorry to hear that, Dennis, but these measures are necessary for your safety. We can’t leave you alone unless we’re sure you aren’t going to try and harm yourself again. Have you considered trying the medications? Once you feel better we’ll be able to take you off suicide watch.
> 
> **SCP-4504:** No- it’s- the meds won’t work, it’s not me. There’s nothing wrong with me, its this place-
> 
> **Dr Weber:** I’m sorry, but that’s simply not true, Dennis. You can’t keep using your mental health to try and breach containment. It’s clearly not healthy for you and is only making things worse. I strongly recommend taking your medications and complying with staff directions from now on. You might not understand, but we’re doing this with your best interests at heart. Now, tell me- how are the slippers and mats? Are they making things easier on your feet?

> 
> **SCP-4504:** Huh, no- wait, I mean-
> 
> **Dr Weber:** Making light of the situation with sarcasm and mockery doesn’t help anyone. If you’re still having problems you need to be honest about them. Or else you’ll never get better.
> 
> **SCP-4504:** Wait- No, I really mean it. You’ve really helped me, I- I haven’t had a suicidal thought all week, I swear!
> 
> **Dr Weber:** I’m sorry, Dennis, but this is for your own good. I’m afraid you’ll have to stay on suicide watch until-

> 
> **Dr Weber:** Hang on a moment, Dennis. I’d like to ask you some questions first.
> 
> **SCP-4504:** Why?
> 
> **Dr Weber:** I’m just curious. You say you no longer feel suicidal, but I received two reports during the week that you attempted self-harm again. Is this true?
>

> **Dr Weber:** I’m not sure that’s a good idea Dennis.
> 
> **SCP-4504:** What?
> 
> **Dr Weber:** You say you feel better, but you’re still demonstrating psychomotor impairment and depressed affect. You’re unresponsive. Combined with the two attempts you made during the week, well, I’m not sure if your mental state is alright. My concern is that you may be malingering, uh, lying, in order to be taken off suicide watch.
> 
> **SCP-4504:** I’m not mal- lying. I don’t- I’m being honest. I don’t feel like dying anymore. Been taking the meds. I’m good now.
> 
> **Dr Weber:** Is that so?
> 
> **SCP-4504:** Yes. Took them everyday. Like you asked. Feel better now.

I’m going to recommend you remain on suicide watch until two weeks after you start consistently taking your medications.

> 
> **Date:** 18/10/2015
> 
> **Incident:** After being returned to its containment cell prematurely as a result of its assault on its psychiatrist, SCP-4504 removed the mattress and sheets from its bunk and moved them into a position leaning against the wall besides the door into its cell. It sat down on the bottom of the mattress with its head resting on a pillow placed against the upright portion of the mattress. From this position it proceeded to strike at any security personnel attempting to enter into its room. Three attempts by security personnel to force entry ended in security officers being maimed by SCP-4504, once while attempting to enter while SCP-4504 was asleep. Security personnel concluded the risk of forcing their way into the cell was too great and resolved to wait until it moved away from its cell door the following morning. Given the risks involved in entering its cell, SCP-4504 was taken off suicide watch but was still observed via the cameras in its cell. SCP-4504 slept in this position for the next two weeks, striking any personnel who entered its cell between the hours of 9pm and 6am.
> 
> The five security personnel injured by SCP-4504 were transported to Site-██ infirmary. After painkillers and somnic medication proved ineffective in treatment, Site-██ medical personnel amputated the areas where SCP-4504 had distorted the bodies of Security Officers ███████, ████████, ███████and ████████. Security Officer █████████’s injury was to their abdomen and could not be treated.

> After being released, SCP-4504 moved through the facility, navigating directly to SCP-082’s containment cell. Once there, security cameras observed the two SCP objects conversing for several minutes, though the camera’s audio was unfortunately unavailable. During the conversation, SCP-4504 kept its distance from SCP-082 but bowed low to it twice. SCP-082 was also observed to laugh and smile several times during their conversation.
> 
> Their encounter was interrupted at 1050 by site security. When it observed security officers approaching, SCP-4504 approached SCP-082 and offered up its hands. Before security officers could intervene, SCP-082 bit cleanly through SCP-4504’s wrists, severing both hands.
> 
> SCP-082 was subdued by site security. SCP-4504 was swiftly relocated to Site-██ infirmary in critical condition.

> 
> **Request:** SCP-4504 formally requests that it be reclassified from “Euclid” to “Neutralised” and released from Foundation containment. SCP-4504 has reported that since the loss of their hands during Containment Breach U/9 it has been unable to utilise its anomaly in any form. SCP-4504 has stated it understands that any such release would require an amnestic treatment to remove its memories of its time in containment, and consents to such a procedure. It states that it does not expect an explanation or backstory for its disappearance or the loss of its hands and will be content with a simple return to its family.
> 
> **Response:** Request granted. SCP-4504 is to be held in containment for three months in order to ensure its injuries are stable and that it is truly no longer anomalous. If these conditions are met, it is to undergo a class Sigma amnestic treatment on 05/08/2016 and subsequently be released in Brisbane, Australia. SCP-4504 is to be dressed in the same manner it was when it was acquired by the Foundation and released three streets away from its family’s residence at [DATA REDACTED]. - //Site Director Sandoval//

SCP-4504 quickly moved to cover the distortion with its bedsheets and denied the existence of the distortion. When Nurse Park asked it to remove the bedsheets so she could check that there was no distortion, SCP-4504 initially refused, but relented when she informed it she would have to call Site-██ Security if it did not. SCP-4504 moved the blankets but attempted to conceal the anomaly by manipulating the bed’s fitted sheet. Nurse Park observed the anomaly and contacted Site Security, which caused SCP-4504 to become distressed and repeatedly state that it was no longer anomalous.

It placed the end of its right arm, where its hand formerly was, against the wall and used its anomaly while drawing back its arm. By doing so it was able to remove a section of the wall the approximate size and shape of its former hand. The wires contained inside the wall did not impede this motion, as they were not contacting SCP-4504 directly.

> After a four second pause, SCP-4504 then repeated this motion two dozen times more within 30 seconds, tearing a hole in its cell wall and breaching containment. It exited its cell and began breaching any other containments it found, using this new application of its anomaly to dismember and decapitate any security staff it encountered.

Security attempted to intervene by threatening to activate the cell’s Halothane dispersal system, but SCP-4504 stated that after it woke up again it would resume its anomalous activity. Unsure if this was a genuine attempt to self-harm or a new manifestation of SCP-4504’s anomaly, security officers remained outside SCP-4504’s containment cell and called for its assigned psychiatrist.
> 
> During SCP-4504’s self-mutilation, it frequently expressed severe distress and pain. It began by elongating its limbs before moving onto its own torso, neck and head. The process was crude, especially on its torso which required almost 30 minutes to elongate as its hands were not large enough to easily manipulate it.
> 
> SCP-4504’s on-site psychiatrist, Dr Strickland, arrived part-way through the process. He attempted to negotiate with SCP-4504, asking it why it was self-mutilating and reminding it that poor behaviour would result in the revocation of its leisure privileges again. SCP-4504 responded with laughter, pointing out it still had not regained leisure privileges after a previous attempt to breach containment.
> 
> Dr Strickland then stated that if it continued to self-harm it may be placed on suicide watch again. SCP-4504 responded with aggression and threats, stating it would kill Dr Strickland and that it knew the Foundation had been hiding antidepressants in its food. Dr Strickland again pleaded with SCP-4504 to stop mutilating itself, stating that he and the other Foundation personnel cared about its wellbeing, to which SCP-4504 again responded with laughter. Dr Strickland asked SCP-4504 why it was self-mutilating and what it thought it would accomplish, to which SCP-4504 responded “Why not?”
> 
> Dr Strickland continued to try and talk SCP-4504 down until it completed the process. It then breached containment, using the increased reach of its arms to disable the Halothane dispersal system inside its cell before breaking out. Its distorted body shrugged off attempts to subdue it, allowing it to kill Dr Strickland and several security officers. SCP-4504 then proceeded to rampage through the facility, maiming 12 security officers and killing 29 others. It was eventually subdued using flashbangs, stun grenades and Halothane grenades.

> __**Test Log 4504/15-3**__
> 
>**Date: 29/11/2017**
> 
> **Research Team:** Senior Researcher Muhammed Al-Harthi, Junior Researcher Albert Vargas
> 
> **Subject:** SCP-4504
> 
> **Participants:** D-72894, a 177cm tall Indigenous Australian male
> 
> **Purpose:** To determine the size and shape of SCP-4504’s energy fields, which had been observed during its most recent containment breach to be larger than its hands were previously.
> 
> **Preparation:** D-72894 restrained in chair using leather straps. Researchers Al-Harthi and Vargas were to observe the test through a one-way reinforced window.
> 
> [BEGIN LOG]
> 
> **Experiment:** //SCP-4504 enters testing chamber. D-72894 begins vocalising distress and expletives, telling SCP-4504 to stay away from him. The research team instructs SCP-4504 to approach D-72894 and use its anomaly on him.//
> 
> //SCP-4504 approaches D-72894. D-72894 continues to vocalise distress and expletives, asking SCP-4504 to stay away and not to harm him while struggling to escape from his restraints. When SCP-4504 reaches D-72894 it bends down, shushing him. It places the end of its forearm on top of D-72894’s head and reassures him that it will not harm him.//
> 
> //SCP-4504 then straightens, steps towards the room’s reinforced observation window and asks the research team if they “want to see what [he] can do?”. SCP-4504 then rushes the window and breaches containment while laughing. It proceeds to kill the research team and the attending security officers with before escaping into Site-██.//
> 
> [END TEST LOG]
> 
> **Closing Statement:** Security footage and post-mortem examination of the research teams from resulting containment breach confirms SCP-4504’s ‘hands’ are enlarged to be proportionate to its new body, with its “palms” being approximately 20cm in diameter and each “finger” being between 45 and 60 centimetres in length. It is unknown if this is the result of SCP-4504 using its energy fields to manipulate each other or if they have grown in proportion to the rest of it. In light of this new information, SCP-4504’s containment procedures should be updated as soon as possible.
> 
> All future testing with SCP-4504 has been prohibited by order of Site Director Sandoval. Information about SCP-4504’s anomalies should instead be observed during its containment breaches to prevent future mishaps such as this.
> 
> D-72894 was returned to its cell unharmed.

> __**Excerpt from Psychiatric Interview with SCP-4504**__
> 
> **Interviewed:** SCP-4504
> 
> **Interviewer:** Doctor White
> 
> **Foreword:** An excerpt from SCP-4504’s first interview with its most recent appointed psychiatrist on 18/09/2019. Two site security officers were also present, as well as four more security officers waiting outside.
> 
> **<Begin Log, 09:00>**
> 
> **Dr White:** Hello, Dennis. My name is Dr White, but you can call me Angela, if you’d like. Please take a seat.
> 
> //SCP-4504 chuckles.//
> 
> **SCP-4504:** “Angela White”, huh? Your parents musta been so proud of that one.
> 
> //SCP-4504 moves to the chair opposite Dr White and takes a seat.//
> 
> **Dr White:** Yes, yes, I’ve heard it before. Now Dennis-
> 
> **SCP-4504:** 4504.
> 
> **Dr White:** I’m sorry?
> 
> **SCP-4504:** 4504. It’s my name. SCP-4504.
> 
> **Dr White:** I didn’t realise you preferred to be called that. Your file states you prefer to be addressed as your birth name.
> 
> **SCP-4504:** I haven’t been “Dennis” in a long time.
> 
> **Dr White:** Alright, I’ll keep that in mind. Treating you with respect is important to me. I'm here as your friend-
> 
> //SCP-4504 snorts.//
> 
> **SCP-4504:** You ain’t my friend. You’re one of them, tryna grind me down so I’ll be a good skip and sit quietly in my little concrete box without bothering anyone. You don't care about my mental health, you only care about keeping me contained. Let me ask you something. You read my file, yeah?
> 
> **Dr White:** Yes, that’s correct.
> 
> **SCP-4504:** So you know what I did to my three other psychiatrists?
> 
> **Dr White:** Yes. I certainly hope our relationship goes better.
> 
> **SCP-4504:** Well, that depends on you. You gonna put me on suicide watch?
> 
> **Dr White:** According to what I read in your file, suicide watch was largely ineffective, was mainly used to punish you for non-compliance and was the precipitating factor in a number of your violent episodes. So no, I don’t think I will be recommending it.
> 
> **SCP-4504:** You gonna try and hide drugs in my food?
> 
> **Dr White:** No.
> 
> **SCP-4504:** You gonna take away my leisure privileges if I talk back?
> 
> **Dr White:** No.
> 
> **SCP-4504:** If I tell you something’s wrong, are you gonna listen or are you gonna argue and say its really my fault?
> 
> **Dr White:** Wha- No! Of course not! How is that supposed to help you?
> 
> **SCP-4504:** Well fuck me then. You might be the best shrink I’ve ever had.
> 
> **Dr White:** I don’t want to jinx myself, but if your other psychiatrists did that then yes, I might be. Is there anything else you wanted to ask me before I get started?
> 
> **SCP-4504:** Can you draw me a map from here to Site Director Sandoval’s office with all the security patrol routes marked on it?
> 
> **Dr White:** No.
> 
> **SCP-4504:** Aaaahh, dangit. My cunning plan was foiled. I was so close, but you witty Foundation types managed to outfox me again. My search for Site Director Sandoval’s office continues.
> 
> **Dr White:** Yes, well. Going back to the subject of your file, I noticed there were a few important pieces of information missing from it.
> 
> **SCP-4504:** Please don’t say “we don’t know exactly how big your imaginary hands are”. Cuz let me tell you now, that ended //badly// for the last guys.
> 
> **Dr White:** No. It's about your… transformation.
> 
> **SCP-4504:** Oh?
> 
> **Dr White:** I looked through your file, but you’ve never really explained why you chose to mutilate yourself like that. I can’t even begin to imagine how painful a small area of your distortions must feel, and you chose to do that to your whole body. Why?
> 
> **SCP-4504:** What do you mean, why? I’m bulletproof. Regular guns don’t hurt me. Tasers bounce off me. It hurts so much I can’t even feel it if I get pepper sprayed. I’m stronger than any normal man and my long legs and arms mean I can run faster and reach further than I ever could back when I was normal. Well, sorta normal.
> 
> **Dr White:** But despite all that, you’ve never used them to escape. You did this to yourself, but your file says during containment breaches you’re more interested in hurting security staff than you are in actually escaping.
> 
> **SCP-4504:** Well, where would I go? I’m nine feet of freak. I could never hide like this. If I walked into any town with people in it they’d scream and run away. There’d be an MTF on me so fast they’d break the land speed record.
> 
> **Dr White:** But then why do it? Was giving up your chance at getting away really worth getting back at security officers?
> 
> **SCP-4504:** Oh, fuck off.
> 
> **Dr White:** I’m sorry? Have I said something that upsets you? I didn’t mean to-
> 
> **SCP-4504:** You said you read my file, yeah? You see how many of those escapes were working for me before I did this to myself?
> 
> **Dr White:** They weren’t as successful, yes. It’s why I thought you did it. To make your breaching containment more likely.
> 
> **SCP-4504:** Wrong. I kept hoping I’d get away again. First time I got out, I was outside for seven months. Seven whole months, where I could down a street with normal people, stand under the sky, go into shops. I got to eat whatever I wanted, drive cars, look at fuckin’ trees. Then I got caught and brought back here. The next time I only managed to stay away for eight weeks. Then one. Now I’m lucky if I get a few hours outside of containment. By the end there I wasn’t even making it all the way off Site-██ before I got caught and dragged back. I realised I was never going to escape. I looked around that little concrete box and I realised I was never going anywhere else. I was gonna die in Site-██, probably in that cell.
> 
> **SCP-4504:** You guys took everything from me. //Everything.// I even gave up my hands, watched ‘em get ripped off me by an ogre, and that didn’t even get me outside. The prosthetics you give me are crap, so I have to eat food like a dog. I was hurting so much. I couldn’t remember the last time I talked to someone who wasn’t staff. I couldn’t remember the last time I’d seen the sky. You guys took that from me.
> 
> **SCP-4504:** But you know something? You know what you can’t take from me? No matter how hard you try? You know the one thing I’ll always be able to enjoy?
> 
> //Pause for three seconds.//
> 
> **Dr White:** Vengeance?
> 
> **SCP-4504:** Fuckin’ vengeance. Lashing out at people who’ve hurt you so they hurt is something so basic, so fundamental, that even dogs understand it. I had nothing to lose. Worst case scenario, you keep me isolated from people, keep me trapped in my cell. I already deal with that shit, so why not? I’m already hurting so bad, it's not like it could make my pain worse. So why not?
> 
> **Dr White:** I see. Why not make yourself into a monster, if you already get treated like one?
> 
> **SCP-4504:** Exactly! Fuckin'- exactly. This way I can kill way more security, which is the only thing I get to enjoy anymore.
> 
> **Dr White:** What about leisure privileges? Your file mentioned you were something of an artist.
> 
> //SCP-4504 snorts.//
> 
> **SCP-4504:** Like that helps. Watching a TV in a dingy little room? Watching a shitty little pot-plant slowly wither and die? And how’m I supposed to paint something good when I only ever see the inside of this place? Plus most of it is really fucking awkward to use when you’ve got no hands.
> 
> **Dr White:** Well, we can start with that. I’m going to recommend a review of your leisure privileges to make them more accessible and enjoyable for you. I’m also going to recommend you be awarded socialisation privileges again, and that you be escorted around the outside perimeter of Site-██ once a week.
> 
> //Four seconds of silence.//
> 
> **SCP-4504:** //What?//
> 
> **Dr White:** That was something you asked for, years ago when you first joined us, wasn’t it? Being escorted around the facility once a week so you could see the outside world? And you said it yourself. A lot of your violence occurs as a result of your feelings of powerlessness and emotional distress, which are in turn caused by your social and physical isolation. I haven’t known you long, but it seems like letting you have these small privileges would vastly decrease both your distress and your violent tendencies. Of course these privileges would be contingent on your good behaviour, but you would understand that by now. I also can’t guarantee Site Director Sandoval will allow any of this, but I certainly intend to argue for it. Uh- with your permission of course.
> 
> //Four seconds of silence.//
> 
> **SCP-4504:** //Jesus Christ,// Angela! Fuck yes, I want this! Where have you been all this time? Shit, I’d kiss you but I’m fairly certain that’d start shit with the guards.
> 
> **Dr White:** Yes, probably. Now I had a few other things I thought you might like to talk about, if you don’t mind.

> __**SCP-4504 Formal Request 18/09/2019**__
> 
> **Assisting Staff Member:** Dr Angela White
> 
> **Request:** SCP-4504 formally requests the return of socialisation privileges. SCP-4504 also requests a review of its leisure privileges so they can be personalised so they are made more appropriate and more accessible for it, as well as the opportunity to be escorted around the perimeter of Site-██ once a week.
> 
> **Response:** SCP-4504’s leisure privileges will be reviewed. The rest of this request is denied. Too much chance of a flight risk with this one. – //Site Director Sandoval//

> 
> **Subject:** SCP-4504 Formal Request
> 
> **Body:** Greetings Site Director.
> 
> I know you have already responded to SCP-4504’s request, but I would ask that you review your decision. As indicated in the attached documents and my interview with it yesterday, SCP-4504 is far less of a flight risk than it once was. Further, almost all of its violence is precipitated by feelings of isolation, powerlessness and distress. Alleviating these would undoubtedly reduce its violent outbursts.
> 
> I would also draw your attention to its history regarding its medication. Never once has it attempted to breach containment or harm staff while its medication was being delivered. Why? Because it understands that if it was to do this, it would lose access to the painkillers it needs. SCP-4504 has repeatedly stated that it needs to socialise with non-staff and it needs time outside. I believe if you fulfil these requests, SCP-4504 will regard them the same way as its medication and will behave.
> 
> It’s for these reasons I’m asking you to review your decision regarding SCP-4504’s formal request.

[[collapsible show="+ Excursion Report A/1" hide="- Excursion Report A/1"]]
> __**Excursion Report A/1**__
> 
> **Date: 23/09/2019**
> 
> SCP-4504 was escorted to the exit to Site-██ by four security staff, led by Security Sergeant ████████. They were met by Staff Psychiatrist Dr Angela White.
> 
> Before commencing the excursion, Dr White asked SCP-4504 how it was feeling. SCP-4504 stated it felt anxious, and that it believed the excursion was more likely to be part of a complex decommissioning procedure than it was to be genuine excursion.
> 
> Security Sergeant ████████ informed SCP-4504 that it was genuine, but he would turn it into a decommissioning procedure if SCP-4504 attempted to escape Foundation custody. SCP-4504 attempted to respond with aggression, but Dr Angela White interrupted and was able to redirect both parties by beginning the excursion.
> 
> SCP-4504 and Dr White were escorted twice around the perimeter of Site-██ over the course of an hour, as planned. SCP-4504 did not attempt escape. The only occurrence of note was that at approximately fifteen minutes after commencing the excursion SCP-4504 began to weep.
