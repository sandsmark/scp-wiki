+++ Welcome to my, [[*user AlanDaris]]', author page.

++++ Here you'll find a list of my works, some author commentary about them, etc. Including SCPs, both successful and not, my translations and... Well, some other stuff, I guess 乁(◔ ͜ʖ◔)ㄏ. It's not like I'm writing a lot of tales or GoI formats (nonclinical prose is hard people).

+++++ I originally wanted to use tables for this page, but tables are overdone and overrated.
++++++ We don't need any tables here. (╯⚆ ͜ʖ⚆）╯︵ ┻━┻

++++ ##243678|You know what "Astral" is, right?##
I like to call this one "My sleep disorder - the SCP". Pretty much all the properties this anomaly possesses are one way or another inspired by the issues I either had in the past or have to this day. Some scenes are directly referencing my IRL experiences too, //and when I think about it like this... I guess you can call Dr. Bishop a self-insert to an extent//. Although I can't say that the disorders described in this skip are that unique. I'm sure that insomnia, nightmares, and symptoms usually associated with depression are pretty familiar to a lot of people (which is not fun at all). 

Another source of inspiration for this skip was the whole "Astral spiders" topics you can find on various lucid dreaming/astral/esoterics sites and forums. Seriously, there are [[[https://sorendreier.com/astral-spiders-looking-for-a-home/|a lot]]] of [[[https://www.auntyflo.com/Superstition-dictionary/astral-spiders-and-scorpios-invertebrates|those]]]. The astral spiders are pretty much always portrayed negatively in those stories. People perceive them as something scary and harmful, some believe that they either trap person's "astral body" while it travels through the astral plane or parasite on it, sucking our energy out and causing us to have bad moods, mental issues, etc. I wouldn't say that I believed in all this mysticism, but it surely gave me a lot of inspiration. Also, helped me to differentiate it from [[[SCP-3966]]] enough. I've read this article while writing mine and was worrying that people will think that I've taken too much from there.

Overall, this is a pretty personal piece, and while the imagery it deals with is very negative, I'm glad how the article itself turned out (for the most part at least, there are bits that could've been better in my opinion). This is also the first of my SCPs that reached +20 and established me as a contributor, so that's cool too.

Oh God, this one. A jamcon2018 entry for the "Shaggy dog" theme and my first ever contest article. I still remember that I haven't planned to write anything on this day, but the energy in IRC chat was so powerful that I felt like I __must__ contribute. 

Looking back at it, I don't consider this one very significant. I just thought of something that would be weird enough for people to like it and short enough to deliver the punchline in a reasonable timespan. Then, I also decided to make the title a pun that would be related to what happened in that addendum. And, to be fair, that article did better than I expected it to (I was actually doubting that it'll survive).

Also, fun fact: Originally, the dogs weren't "remarkably small". I just wanted to make the imagery more remarkable, and since giant dogs [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4464|were already a thing]]], I decided to take the opposite route. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Two dog articles in a row, what? Well, anyway, third article and an entry for the International GoI contest. The idea of this skip existed in my head long before the contest, and then I saw the opportunity to write it by tying it into the German Branch's GoI.

The concept and the article itself had undergone //a lot// of changes during the writing phase. It was also one of the hardest works for me to write. In retrospect, think there was some potential in this concept that I didn't utilize because I was way too tired of trying to put this article together. TLDR; I think it could've been better and maybe I'll rewrite it some time, but I'm not sure.

++++ ##454549|Upon SCP-4165-1 approaching the subject, a large, vertical cavity formed on the entity's head, and black ink started to flow out of it in large quantities.##
A very spontaneous work and, to be fair, I'm still not exactly sure where the idea for it came from. My best guess is that it was inspired by the writing block I had while trying to put together another article. I've spent almost three weeks on it and ultimately abandoned my attempts to write it because the concept didn't go anywhere.

SCP-4165, on the other hand, was very easy to write, which is ironic given the concept. It did undergo some changes during the writing phase though: originally, that addendum was a video log and involved skip and the ink monster talking to each other with the monster repeating the word "Write" several times before assaulting the poor guy. Then, it came to me that if I cut that dialog and some details out, the article won't lose anything valuable, and so it was done.

++++ **Rating: +%%rating%%**
++++ ##461DA5|What a strange, yet at the same time, obvious question to ask in a dream. Is any of it real?##
The first half of the storyline that I and Arbelict came up with for CollabCon. One of the main thoughts behind this particular piece was "how would MC&D find a way to ask such a mysterious and strange GoI as Oneiroi for help?" We've decided that the most logical thing would be to have some kind of business dinner that would also happen in a dream (for obvious reasons). The main goal of the tale was to introduce readers to the story we were going to tell in the upcoming SCP object, but I think that at the end some people were able to enjoy it as a standalone piece, of which I am very happy.

I have to say that although I've co-authored this piece, Arbelict did a lot more to put it together than I did. This tale is up there mainly because of his writing skill and ability to write tons of words in incredibly short amounts of time.

++++ ##40C4BE|I remember it approaching me, trying to do something to me. Something bad. Very bad.##
Writing process for this one was pretty tough. Me and Arbelict had a very clear idea of what we wanted to do with the tale, but the skip's concept was a lot vaguer, which resulted in us changing the general idea, the logs, and various parts of text numerous times. Sort of a "breakthrough" in our brainstorming happened when we decided to utilize the concept of subjectivity regarding dreams. Originally, there were supposed to be more logs, but then the idea of making only one log while describing it through the eyes of each test subject stuck with us. We don't know what //exactly// happened in that dream, but there is definitely some truth behind all that mess.

Actually, we barely finished the skip in time and uploaded during the last posting day (and I'm sure some other collabcon teams experienced the same thing).

+++ --Wait why tf scpper stores data about deleted articles. I can see my old stuff and I hate it--
[[/=]]

+++ Lucas "The Great"
My first attempt to write something for this community. As you can probably tell judging by the word "Deleted" above, this attempt wasn't the best one. I've tried to upload this article both to the Russia branch (from which I've originated) and then to the -EN when it failed there. Well, the article itself undergone some changes, but it didn't help a lot. It was already obvious to me that this skip wasn't very good and it wouldn't get a very high rating.

This article told a story about comedically dumb memetic virus who tried to take over a Foundation Site only because it wanted to be loved. I tend to not forget my old concepts, because if I thought that they were good back then, maybe there is something that can be salvaged. But I'm not sure about this one. Maybe there is a theme that can be used in the future, but the premise seems kinda generic in retrospect and my execution of it was pretty mediocre. 

------

+++ Ethereal Spiders

And now to the article that actually //was// salvaged. "Ethereal Spiders" was the older version of SCP-4241 which I've tried to post somewhere during summer 2018. Unfortunately, due to the lack of my experience in both writing and English language, it didn't go that well. But some people told me that the concept is worth pursuing anyway, and so I've tried my best.

Fun fact: This skip was originally numbered "3749" (just like the previous one). So, the PoI is designated "3749" because of it. But now the slot is occupied with [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3749|a cool article about an edgy sword]]], so the reference is pretty much meaningless. Not going to remove it though. 乁( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)ㄏ

------

+++ The Past Is Perfect

Dunno what to say about this one. It was just a pretty mediocre piece that didn't work that well because I wasn't willing to put enough effort into it. The concept also wasn't that great: it was a park that turned adults that entered it into children, the piece also attempted to tell some story through inscriptions found in different places of the park, but there wasn't a lot to it.

For some reason, I thought that writing a short skip will be easy and I'll be able to create a vision that there is more to it to get upvotes. With such a mindset, it's no wonder that the skip failed. ಠ_ಠ
