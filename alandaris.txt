++++ ##243678|You know what "Astral" is, right?##
I like to call this one "My sleep disorder - the SCP". Pretty much all the properties this anomaly possesses are one way or another inspired by the issues I either had in the past or have to this day. Some scenes are directly referencing my IRL experiences too, //and when I think about it like this... I guess you can call Dr. Bishop a self-insert to an extent//. Although I can't say that the disorders described in this skip are that unique. I'm sure that insomnia, nightmares, and symptoms usually associated with depression are pretty familiar to a lot of people (which is not fun at all). 

Another source of inspiration for this skip was the whole "Astral spiders" topics you can find on various lucid dreaming/astral/esoterics sites and forums. Seriously, there are [[[https://sorendreier.com/astral-spiders-looking-for-a-home/|a lot]]] of [[[https://www.auntyflo.com/Superstition-dictionary/astral-spiders-and-scorpios-invertebrates|those]]]. The astral spiders are pretty much always portrayed negatively in those stories. People perceive them as something scary and harmful, some believe that they either trap person's "astral body" while it travels through the astral plane or parasite on it, sucking our energy out and causing us to have bad moods, mental issues, etc. I wouldn't say that I believed in all this mysticism, but it surely gave me a lot of inspiration. Also, helped me to differentiate it from [[[SCP-3966]]] enough. I've read this article while writing mine and was worrying that people will think that I've taken too much from there.

Overall, this is a pretty personal piece, and while the imagery it deals with is very negative, I'm glad how the article itself turned out (for the most part at least, there are bits that could've been better in my opinion). This is also the first of my SCPs that reached +20 and established me as a contributor, so that's cool too.

Oh God, this one. A jamcon2018 entry for the "Shaggy dog" theme and my first ever contest article. I still remember that I haven't planned to write anything on this day, but the energy in IRC chat was so powerful that I felt like I __must__ contribute. 

Looking back at it, I don't consider this one very significant. I just thought of something that would be weird enough for people to like it and short enough to deliver the punchline in a reasonable timespan. Then, I also decided to make the title a pun that would be related to what happened in that addendum. And, to be fair, that article did better than I expected it to (I was actually doubting that it'll survive).

Also, fun fact: Originally, the dogs weren't "remarkably small". I just wanted to make the imagery more remarkable, and since giant dogs [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4464|were already a thing]]], I decided to take the opposite route. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

++++ ##454549|Upon SCP-4165-1 approaching the subject, a large, vertical cavity formed on the entity's head, and black ink started to flow out of it in large quantities.##
A very spontaneous work and, to be fair, I'm still not exactly sure where the idea for it came from. My best guess is that it was inspired by the writing block I had while trying to put together another article. I've spent almost three weeks on it and ultimately abandoned my attempts to write it because the concept didn't go anywhere.

SCP-4165, on the other hand, was very easy to write, which is ironic given the concept. It did undergo some changes during the writing phase though: originally, that addendum was a video log and involved skip and the ink monster talking to each other with the monster repeating the word "Write" several times before assaulting the poor guy. Then, it came to me that if I cut that dialog and some details out, the article won't lose anything valuable, and so it was done.

++++ ##40C4BE|I remember it approaching me, trying to do something to me. Something bad. Very bad.##
Writing process for this one was pretty tough. Me and Arbelict had a very clear idea of what we wanted to do with the tale, but the skip's concept was a lot vaguer, which resulted in us changing the general idea, the logs, and various parts of text numerous times. Sort of a "breakthrough" in our brainstorming happened when we decided to utilize the concept of subjectivity regarding dreams. Originally, there were supposed to be more logs, but then the idea of making only one log while describing it through the eyes of each test subject stuck with us. We don't know what //exactly// happened in that dream, but there is definitely some truth behind all that mess.

Actually, we barely finished the skip in time and uploaded during the last posting day (and I'm sure some other collabcon teams experienced the same thing).

An idea that came to me during a vacation on Rhodes. We experienced some minor problems with our room and other things while being there, which I think is the case for most vacations, and I thought it'd be pretty fun to somehow embed this concept into SCPverse. That was the skeleton of the article, and the story was built from there. Still, I suspected that jokes about misunderstanding the situation can only get so much reader's attention, so I added a twist at the end, which suggests why everything happened the way it did. The current story is more about getting scammed than about hotels, but I think it fits well enough. SCP-4915 really did nothing wrong, the guy just trusted the wrong people, which resulted in them taking away his money and him ending up contained. It's probably one of the worst things that can happen to you during traveling.

++++ ##BE610E|The images won't stop. They're all around me. I want to stop this, but I don't know how. I can't see people. Please respond.##
The storyline for this one is pretty heavily inspired by [[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iO0ZXo3ORqc|this video (kinda NSFW)]]]. Mainly, it was the concept of someone seeing scary illusions and then, by the very end, realizing that the illusions were actually their true surroundings, which they couldn't accept. So I watched this weird, edgy Luigi video and decided that something like this could potentially work in the Foundationverse, where imagery like this was [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/k-class-complete-list|pretty common]]].

The idea of conveying this concept through messages came to me a little later, mainly because I really didn't think I could write normal prose well enough, lol. I think there are certainly ways this tale could've been improved, but still, I feel fine about it, especially looking at it as an attempt to write in a slightly different format.

++++ ##461DA5|What a strange, yet at the same time, obvious question to ask in a dream. Is any of it real?##
The first half of the storyline that I and Arbelict came up with for CollabCon. One of the main thoughts behind this particular piece was "how would MC&D find a way to ask such a mysterious and strange GoI as Oneiroi for help?" We've decided that the most logical thing would be to have some kind of business dinner that would also happen in a dream (for obvious reasons). The main goal of the tale was to introduce readers to the story we were going to tell in the upcoming SCP object, but I think some people were able to enjoy it as a standalone piece, which is very nice.

I have to say that although I've co-authored this piece, Arbelict did a lot more to put it together than I did. This tale is up there mainly because of his writing skill and ability to write tons of words in incredibly short amounts of time.

++++ ##A81B0B|{{I listened closely and heard loud whimpering coming from underground. Those hits I wrote about earlier… It was that thing, no doubt about it. It was trapped there, below the burger place. And it was in agony.}}##

From the moment I saw various people jumping on the Parawatch bandwagon (as they tend to put it), I knew that eventually, I'd want to write for this hub too. I have a soft spot for creepypastas since I used to read lots of them when I was younger. I was very fearful back then, so most of those stories tended to have a giant impact on me. Usually, it wasn't me fearing for my life or thinking that something might hurt it. It was more of an uncanny feeling of weirdness that was going on in those stories.

In this work, I've tried to at least partially convey that feeling of having something weird happening nearby, but out of sight. For some reason, I knew from the start that I'll be writing in some kind of cafe/fast-food location. I guess it's a psychology-related thing: you tend to associate places like this with more positive, light-hearted emotions, so adding something creepy there results in a more polarizing imagery. Besides [[[SCP-2915]]], which gave me an idea for the background of what could possibly happen in Red and Maroon, I've also drawn my inspiration from other sources. Sources like FNAF's predecessors -- Chuck E Cheese creepypastas, and various other stories.

[[/module]]

One of the rare occasions when I've tried to write actual prose (emphasis on "tried"). The tale is heavily based on [[[SCP-4319]]], the article which inspired me with its potentially interesting concept. I'm not a fan of articles that are too heavy on politics/social commentary, so I mainly thought about "Just Girly Things" as one more Foundation monster, although a more unusual and intangible one. The idea that there's a lunatic reality bender that basically turns people into zombies, bending their will just so they would fit into her distorted worldview is pretty chilling, so I decided to write about that.

The setting for this tale is kinda a mix between two earlier tales that were written for JGT (not by me) but didn't survive. Some ideas, such as the Foundation employee being affected by the anomaly, were borrowed from there.

+++ --Wait why tf scpper stores data about deleted articles. I can see my old stuff and I hate it--
[[/=]]

+++ Lucas "The Great"
My first attempt to write something for this community. As you can probably tell judging by the word "Deleted" above, this attempt wasn't the best one. I've tried to upload this article both to the Russia branch (from which I've originated) and then to the -EN when it failed there. Well, the article itself undergone some changes, but it didn't help a lot. It was already obvious to me that this skip wasn't very good and it wouldn't get a very high rating.

This article told a story about comedically dumb memetic virus who tried to take over a Foundation Site only because it wanted to be loved. I tend to not forget my old concepts, because if I thought that they were good back then, maybe there is something that can be salvaged. But I'm not sure about this one. Maybe there is a theme that can be used in the future, but the premise seems kinda generic in retrospect and my execution of it was pretty mediocre. 

------

+++ Ethereal Spiders

And now to the article that actually //was// salvaged. "Ethereal Spiders" was the older version of SCP-4241 which I've tried to post somewhere during summer 2018. Unfortunately, due to the lack of my experience in both writing and English language, it didn't go that well. But some people told me that the concept is worth pursuing anyway, and so I've tried my best.

Fun fact: This skip was originally numbered "3749" (just like the previous one). So, the PoI is designated "3749" because of it. But now the slot is occupied with [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3749|a cool article about an edgy sword]]], so the reference is pretty much meaningless. Not going to remove it though. 乁( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)ㄏ

------

+++ The Past Is Perfect

Dunno what to say about this one. It was just a pretty mediocre piece that didn't work that well because I wasn't willing to put enough effort into it. The concept also wasn't that great: it was a park that turned adults that entered it into children, the piece also attempted to tell some story through inscriptions found in different places of the park, but there wasn't a lot to it.

For some reason, I thought that writing a short skip will be easy and I'll be able to create a vision that there is more to it to get upvotes. With such a mindset, it's no wonder that the skip failed. ಠ_ಠ

------

+++ Heart of a Dog

The article that previously occupied the [[[SCP-4240|4240]]] slot and was written by me for the International GoI contest. Unlike the previous ones, it had a passable rating of 35 when I self-deleted it. I wasn't very fond of the article at the time because, while the concept was good enough, I don't think I really nailed the execution. It had lots of interviews and an ethical dilemma for the Foundation, but there were parts that could really use some improvement. Also, I think me disliking how International contest turned out also played a role. It was, according to me, ran pretty poorly, and the voting system wasn't thought through at all. I have mainly bad emotions associated with it, so I wasn't very pleased with having 4240 on my author page.

This one is also on rewrite schedule, but I have no idea when I'll get to it (if at all).

++++ My nickname is AlanDaris, I'm 19 years old. My house is in Kyiv, Ukraine, where all the apartment buildings are, and I am not married. I study Germanic philology in a university, and I get home every day by 7 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 3 AM, and almost never make sure I get eight hours of sleep. After browsing the web on my phone for about an hour before going to bed, I usually have some problems sleeping until morning. Unlike a baby, I wake up with plenty of fatigue and stress in the morning. I was told there were plenty of issues during my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who does not wish to live a very quiet life. I take care to trouble myself with enemies and things like winning and losing, which sometimes causes me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness.
