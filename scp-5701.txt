**Item #:** SCP-XXXX

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-XXXX is stored in a standard containment locker at Storage Site 23. All (authorized) SCP-XXXX-# instances are held in the neighboring filing cabinet. PoI-XXXX-3's confiscated anartist tools are held in Research Site 174.

After Ethics Committee ruling 9502-XXXX, all remaining SCP-XXXX-# instances containing Foundation staff members as subjects have been incinerated and testing with SCP-XXXX has been suspended indefinitely.

**Description:** SCP-XXXX is superficially similar to a Polaroid™ Sun 600 LMS instant camera built by Matthew Tebbe (PoI-XXXX-3). SCP-XXXX functions in the exact same manner as other identical models, except for the fact that it prints SCP-XXXX-# instances instead of normal photos.

SCP-XXXX-# instances are any photographs created by SCP-XXXX. If any person, henceforth referred to as "subject," is photographed within an SCP-XXXX-# instance and later either do a present action that they regard as a "mistake" or have a noticeable regret of a past action, said SCP-XXXX-# instance will change to depict a scene of the subject making said mistake or regret. Additional specifics of the behavior of SCP-XXXX-# instances can be seen below:

[[collapsible show="+ Show Advanced SCP-XXXX-# Description" hide="- Hide Advanced SCP-XXXX-# Description"]]

* If multiple SCP-XXXX-# instances are taken of a subject and said instances are activated, only the earliest created SCP-XXXX-# instance will be affected. The other instance(s) will then be activated by later incidents as normal. However, said later instances must have different trigger events than said first instance.
* If there are multiple subjects photographed within a single SCP-XXXX-# instance, the first one to trigger the effect edits the SCP-XXXX-# instance as normal. The other subject(s) is/are ignored.

__**Test A - Date**__ 3-17-2005
> **Foreword:** The function of SCP-XXXX had already been crudely depicted by PoI-XXXX-1. The following tests were made to confirm his description.
> **Subject:** D-5152
> **Procedure:** Junior Researcher Mason was ordered to use SCP-XXXX to create an SCP-XXXX-# instance with D-5152 as the subject, then shake D-5152's hand with a joybuzzer (the "mistake").
> **Results:** SCP-XXXX printed SCP-XXXX-1. D-5152 initially showed hostility toward J. R. Mason, but calmed down after being informed of SCP-XXXX-1, which at that moment depicted D-5152 recoiling from J. R. Mason's joybuzzer.
> **Analysis:** After additional tests redacted for brevity, PoI-XXXX-1's description of SCP-XXXX was confirmed to be accurate. Testing with staff subjects has been approved.

__**Test B - Date**__ 3-19-2005
> **Foreword:** Subject had volunteered for testing "just in case it helps you guys." After all official paperwork had been filled out, testing was approved.
> **Subject:** Kyle Hart, Site 23 Custodian
> **Procedure:** Kyle Hart was ordered to use SCP-XXXX to generate an SCP-XXXX-# instance of himself.
> **Results:** The next day, SCP-XXXX-11 had been observed to now depict Kyle walking away from Site 23. His keychain was noticeably missing.
> **Analysis:** When asked about the contents of SCP-XXXX-11, Kyle confessed that after realizing he had forgotten his keys at home, he decided to return home without cleaning his section of the Site. He was later reprimanded for his actions.

__**Test C - Date**__ 3-20-2005
> **Foreword:** Despite the semi-unprofessional reason for testing, since testing applications were officially filled out, testing was later approved due to the (initially presumed) harmlessness of SCP-XXXX.
> **Subject:** Dr. Hedrick
> **Procedure:** Senior Researcher Lance used SCP-XXXX to create SCP-XXXX-13 with Dr. Hedrick as the subject. Senior Researcher Lance was then asked to inform the Site Director as soon as SCP-XXXX-13 changed. 
> **Results:** Two hours after testing, SCP-XXXX-13 changed to depict Dr. Hedrick falling down a the flight of stairs between floors 2 and 3 of Site 23. Dr. Albro was also depicted in the picture with an expression of surprise on her face, being the first instance of a non-subject person appearing in an SCP-XXXX-# instance.
> **Analysis:** N/A

__**Test D - Date**__ 3-19-2005
> **Foreword:** Dr. Marley was asked in advance if he would be willing to comply with testing, which he later agreed to after being informed of its presumed harmlessness.
> **Subject:** Dr. Marley
> **Procedure:** Dr. Marley was asked to use SCP-XXXX to generate an SCP-XXXX-# instance of himself.
> **Results:** 21 days later, SCP-XXXX-12 instance depicted a scene of Dr. Marley performing a heart surgery on an unidentifiable patient later confirmed as ██████████. Dr. Myers was visible in the background of the scene. Dr. Marley had an expression commonly associated with shock on his face, and his scalpel was freefalling above said patient. When asked about the contents of SCP-XXXX-12, Dr. Marley confessed that after the event depicted, his scalpel sliced an artery in the patient, leading to significant blood loss, which put the patient in a critical condition for approximately seven minutes. Dr. Marley and his assistant were demoted to Junior Medical staff.
> **Analysis:** N/A
> **Notes:** "You damn sons-of-guns lied to me. You told me that this camera wouldn't even hurt me. Well, then it goes on to hurt, if not shred apart, my career. Next thing you know, the whole God-forsaken Foundation's getting spied on. Stop doing this to people. Now." - Dr. Marley, 3-31-2005, from an interview on the same day as his confrontation.

__**Test E - Date**__ 3-31-2005
> **Foreword:** MTFU Epsilon-11-59 was asked in advance if he would be willing to comply with testing, which he later agreed to after being informed of its harmlessness.
> **Subject:** Mobile Task Force Unit Epsilon-11-59
> **Procedure:** MTFU Epsilon-11-59 was asked to use SCP-XXXX to generate an SCP-XXXX-# instance of himself.
> **Results:** Ten seconds later (setting the record for least time between SCP-XXXX-# creation and activation), SCP-XXXX-16 instance depicted the subject firing his standard issue pistol at MTFU Epsilon-11-57, who was KIA on "RCM (Re-Containment Mission) #462: 6-9-1992." When asked about it, MTFU Epsilon-11-59 initially denied the incident, but later admitted that he did accidentally commit fratricide in the mission for fear that MTFU Epsilon-11-57 was infected with [[[SCP-008]]], then convinced Overwatch to expunge the incident after a diagnostic confirmed that MTFU Epsilon-11-57 was perfectly healthy. MTFU Epsilon-11-59 then had an emotional breakdown, and was unable to continue with questioning. Punishments were declined to the fact that MTFU Epsilon-11-59's actions were demanded by emergency protocols pertaining to anomalous diseases.
> **Analysis:** N/A
[[/collapsible]]
> **Notes:** "It's clear that after these two testing logs that testing needs to be ceased immediately and permanently. Due to the risk of Site Directors using SCP-XXXX for excessive surveillance, or worse yet, blackmail, as well as the emotional damage that subjects consistently receive after being confronted by information from their respective SCP-XXXX-# instance, we, the Ethics Committee as a whole, unanimously vote to indefinitely suspend testing with SCP-XXXX, as well as incinerate any SCP-XXXX-# instances involving Foundation staff members. I also, as a personal request, ask that any staff member not confront any of these individuals with any of the information in any of the testing logs. We may have allowed worse things, but no more testing is needed, and it clearly causes a level of emotional damage to the subjects, so we are willing to suspend it.
> We do what we can because we must." - Gina Reagan, Speaker for the Ethics Committee, 4-2-2005

> *2-19-2005, 10:00*: PoI-XXXX-1 arrives on time for his appointment.[[footnote]] PoI-XXXX-1 did not use a vehicle, and later admitted that he did not inform his parents of his appointment. [[/footnote]] Possessions included $90 cash to pay for the therapy session, a map of the local area, and a phone.
> 
> *10:02*: PoI-XXXX-1 begins his appointment and soon informs MTFU Epsilon-6-13 of SCP-XXXX and Conner Miller (PoI-XXXX-2). See below for full interview:
> 
>> **Interviewed:** PoI-XXXX-1
>> 
>> **Interviewer:** MTFU Epsilon-6-13
>> 
>> **Foreword:** Confirmed existence of SCP-XXXX and PoI-XXXX-2.
>> 
>> **<Begin Sub-log.>**
>> 
>> **MTFU Epsilon-6-13:** So, what's been on your mind?
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-1:** It's a school bully, but... well, he's more than that. Like, a lot more. Almost freaking psychic. Basically... look, I don't know how to describe it, but he's... he's breaking physics, if you know what I mean. He's not normal. And he's hurt everyone else I've gotten help from, too. Just to ruin everything for me. For no reason... please help...
>> 
>> **MTFU Epsilon-6-13:** I'm hoping I understand. Go on.
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-1:** So here's the thing: he's somehow getting these really personal photos of me and posting them on the school billboard. They're always me making some really stupid mistakes, like forgetting a backpack or something else like that. Now here's the part where it gets really crazy: half of them are literally impossible! Like, I'm home alone, I drop and break a dish, and he has a photo of me right inside the same room! It's just... he's... look, does any of this sound easy to you?
>> 
>> //MTFU Epsilon-6-13 briefly pauses.//
>> 
>> **MTFU Epsilon-6-13:** Well, let's see what I can do to help... 
>> 
>> //MTFU Epsilon-6-13 begins Anomaly Report note.//
>> 
>> [REDACTED FOR BREVITY. RESUME 40 MINUTES LATER.]
>> 
>> **MTFU Epsilon-6-13:** And by the way, you said it was a camera, not the kid?
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-1:** I think so. He takes these photos of me, and the next time I do something embarrassing, he already has a photo of it. I have no idea how it's happening, but I just know he's got something up his sleeve.
>> 
>> **MTFU Epsilon-6-13:** Thank you for your time. Do you think you can call your parents?
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-1:** I... Look, can we... Just... Remember what I said about "hurting everyone else that's helped?" Please don't get them into this.
>> 
>> **MTFU Epsilon-6-13:** They won't be involved with him. They'll be fine.
>> 
>> //PoI-XXXX-1 considers for a while, then replies://
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-1:** Fine. I'll call them.
>> 
>> **MTFU Epsilon-6-13:** Thank you.
>> 
>> //PoI-XXXX-1 leaves the room to contact his parents. MTFU Epsilon-6-13 uses his emergency Foundation contact and requests help with the following://
>> 
>> **MTFU Epsilon-6-13:** We have a safe-vlam-notice anomaly, believed to be a Polaroid™ instant camera. Medium public exposure. Location: [REDACTED]. Do you think you can help?
>> 
>> **<End Sub-log.>**
>> 
>> **Closing Statement:** When informed that his parents would need to be notified before he would be moved into Foundation custody "for more extensive therapy sessions,"[[footnote]] Unlike most cover stories, said therapy sessions were actually administered. [[/footnote]] PoI-XXXX-1 eventually used his phone to inform his parents of the appointment. They eventually drove over to the office and approved transfer seven minutes after arrival.
> 
> *2-20-2005, 9:01*:MTFU Epsilon-6-30 contacted [REDACTED] High School in person. "Apparently PoI-XXXX-1 managed to blackmail every single teacher in the school with SCP-XXXX, so we'll have to 'correct' him for everyone. We might be able to keep others safe from this megalomaniac if we do it right." - MTFU Epsilon-6-30.
> 
> *11:11*: PoI-XXXX-2 was put under Foundation custody with minimal suspicion by MTFU Ɛ-6-30, -31, -32, -33, -34, -35, -36, and -37. The following interview was conducted at Protected Site 67:
> 
>> **Interviewed:** PoI-XXXX-2
>> 
>> **Interviewer:** Dr. Mason
>> 
>> **Foreword:** Confirmed existence of SCP-XXXX-X# and PoI-XXXX-3.
>> 
>> **<Begin Sub-log, 2-21-2005, 8:00>**
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-2:** I'm just gonna say it: I've gotten every single teacher's darkest secret, and you just let everyone in the world see them. Poor choice.
>> 
>> **Dr. Mason:** We confiscated those photos.
>> 
>> //PoI-XXXX-2 briefly pauses, then mutters to himself://
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-2:** Well, there went my only backup.
>> 
>> **Dr. Mason:** Yep. So, knowing you're up against us, who will do whatever it takes to know what's going on, what happened?
>> 
>> //PoI-XXXX-2 hesitates.//
>> 
>> **Dr. Mason:** You heard us.
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-2:** Fine! I bullied someone with a camera! Is that enough? Just let me go!
>> 
>> **Dr. Mason:** You know what that camera can do, right?
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-2:** Yeah, take pictures, duh.
>> 
>> **Dr. Mason:** You know what we meant.
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-2:** Fine! It changes photos so that it shows people messing things up. Is that enough?
>> 
>> **Dr. Mason:** Where did you get it from?
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-2:** I'll never tell you.
>> 
>> //Dr. Mason stands up from his chair, abruptly leans toward PoI-XXXX-2, and slams his fist onto the table.//
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-2:** It was a friend! What do you want?
>> 
>> //Dr. Mason returns to his chair.//
>> 
>> **Dr. Mason:** Well, thank you for finally answering. Could you tell us more about him?
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-2:** His name is Matthew, only one at my school, same grade as me... is that enough?
>> 
>> **Dr. Mason:** Thanks for telling us about him. Do you happen to know how he gave you that camera?
>> 
>> //PoI-XXXX-2 briefly pauses.// 
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-2:** This'll take a while.
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-2:** So you know about, Luke, the kid that snitched on me? Well, he'd actually been bullying me like he would anyone else. Now, one day I say enough's enough, and ask my bud for some help. Get some sweet revenge. So he asks how I wanna get it; I tell him "the same way I got it."
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-2:** So he goes home, and a few days later he has this weird camera I've never seen before. He tells me it's an 'instant camera,' shows me how it works, and then gets to the good part: turning into mistakes. He also tells me to be nice with that camera, like that wasn't even the point of all this-
>> 
>> **Dr. Mason:** Sorry to interrupt, but what did he say exactly?
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-2:** "So you're gonna use this camera, post the pictures, have your laughs, get him off your back, and then you'll leave him and the camera alone."
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-2:** Pffft, like that'll stop him! I needed to make sure he would never do it again. So that's what I did. The teachers found out soon that it was me, of course. I just had to keep them quiet with good ol' blackmail. That was easier than I would've guessed, actually.
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-2:** So anyway, my friend started freaking out a little later, so I just did the same to him. Yes, it wasn't nice, but I stayed out of trouble, so...
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-2:** Of course, Luke could've asked for help whenever, but I just had to keep doing what I had been doing and he kept quiet. I could've kept on doing that maybe endlessly.
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-2:** Then you guys showed up and undid the whole thing! You've just doomed me into letting him get back! What now?
>> 
>> **Dr. Mason:** We'll handle that. Just keep with us and you might be okay.
>> 
>> **<End Sub-log, 8:17>**
>> 
>> **Closing Statement:** PoI-XXXX-2 was kept in Foundation custody while PoI-XXXX-3 was brought into Foundation custody under PoI-XXXX-2's "behavior correction" cover story.
> 
>> **Interviewed:** PoI-XXXX-3
>> 
>> **Interviewer:** Dr. Dawkins
>> 
>> **Foreword:** Confirmed PoI-XXXX-3's relations with GoI "Are We Cool Yet?", PoI-XXXX-3's anartist tools and supplies, and the existence of an additional SCP-XXXX-X#
>> 
>> **<Begin Sub-log, 2-22-2005, 8:00>**
>> 
>> **Dr. Dawkins:** So, before we begin-
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-3:** Get that camera out of that demon's hands now.
>> 
>> //Dr. Dawkins briefly pauses.// 
>> 
>> **Dr. Dawkins:** Well, we've already done that. So, getting back on-
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-3:** And he won't get it back after this, right?
>> 
>> **Dr. Dawkins:** Will you please stop interrupting? Of course he won't, he's been hugely irresponsible with it.
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-3:** That's all I needed to hear. Thanks. So, how can I help?
>> 
>> **Dr. Dawkins:** Well, first, how did you find that camera?
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-3:** I didn't find it; I built it. You see, you won't be familiar with it, but I'm part of this group known as "A.W.C.Y.", which stands for...
>> 
>> **Dr. Dawkins:** "Are We Cool Yet." Interesting.
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-3:** Yeah! Tha... how did you know what that means?
>> 
>> **Dr. Dawkins:** Let's just say that's my job.
>> 
>> //PoI-XXXX-3 briefly pauses.//
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-3:** Okay...
>> 
>> **Dr. Dawkins:** So, how exactly did you build it?
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-3:** I honestly have no idea. I just build it and it just works. I mean, I know I'll need a normal camera, some other things, and some tools, but not like, 'so then I put this and this together so that they do this.'
>> 
>> **Dr. Dawkins:** All right. So, why did you just give it to your friend? Did you know what it could do?
>> 
>> **PoI-XXXX-3:** I trusted him. I trusted him and he went crazy and if it weren't for you guys, the whole world would be toast.
>> 
>> **Dr. Dawkins:** We're told that a lot. Thank you for your time.
>> 
>> **<End Sub-log, 8:17>**
>> 
>> **Closing Statement:** Before Dr. Dawkins left the interview room, PoI-XXXX-3 said the following: "And by the way, in case you're curious, when he put me under blackmail, my photo didn't even have to change. It just printed as me building that God-forsaken camera. Because I regret it. I regret it and all the harm that I've caused and all the people that got hurt by him and everything... you guys sound like some global secret ops people. Do you guys do anything like, wipe memories if needed? Or at least something to clean up this mess, because I'd appreciate it."
> 
> *2-23-2005, 10:00*: Additional interviews were conducted with PoI-XXXX-3 for possible leads about GoI "Are We Cool Yet?", but did not yield any significant information.
> 
> *2-25-2005, 4:23*: All PoI's and persons in the nearby area were administered Class A amnestics, except for PoI-XXXX-3, who was administered Class C amnestics. PoI-XXXX-3's anartist tools/ supplies were confiscated as well.
