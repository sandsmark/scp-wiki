title:Document 2216-X1999-1
**Document Type:** Supplemental (XC-2216/1999)

**Security Clearance Level:** 4-2216/1999 Eyes Only, Need to Know Basis.

**Abstract:** Since roughly 1940, the name "Loewes" has been known to anomalously appear on objects found in museums in and around the New York area. In 1982, as part of ongoing MTF-Iota 9 operations, the digital video disc now classified as SCP-2216-2-1 was taken into foundation possession by Agent █████ as an instance of SCP-1999. Upon routine testing of the DVD,  Dr. ██████ began to experience anomalous symptoms, consistent with SCP-2216-2 exposure. Upon the discovery of additional SCP-2216-2 instances, SCP-2216-2-1 was reclassified as an instance of SCP-2216 (at the time, SCP-2216-1 was undiscovered).

[[/collapsible]] is a focus of cross-SCP research for two reasons:
* It represents the prime example of an SCP-1999 instance in video form.
* It represents the prime instance of SCP-2216-2.

For these reasons, SCP-2216-2-1 is classified at the highest levels and only available to researchers appointed by unanimous O5 decision. This document exists as a database of pertinent information for the discovery of the presumed connection between SCP-1999 and SCP-2216

**Background Data:**

> A DVD labeled 'Loewes'. Video appears to be a 12 minute home movie taking place in a wooded area. Refer to document 2216-11A for transcript of the video. At this time, research is ongoing to determine any connection between SCP-2216-2-1, SCP-1999 and the GOI "Are We Cool Yet".

At this point it is believed that "Are We Cool Yet?" is limited to imitation of SCP-1999 and not believed to be responsible for any anomalous instances.

> SCP-1999 is a phenomenon whereby the name "Loewes" (sometimes stylized "LOEWES" or less frequently, "loewes") inscribes itself on the surface of objects through unknown means. [REDACTED FOR BREVITY]. Objects so far discovered with SCP-1999 written on them have had no similarities to one another other than having been located inside museums, a feature which has been instrumental in identifying fabricated instances. [REDACTED FOR BREVITY].
> 
> An object marked with the name produces an effect whereby subjects consider it the property of another person, even if it was originally theirs. [REDACTED FOR BREVITY]. Museum staff have on numerous occasions removed items from exhibits without prompting, later stating the object in question "is Elfie's". Seeing the name or knowing about its existence on the object is unnecessary for the effect to take place.
> 
> Analysis of affected objects suggests a frequency of occurrence between one and three months.

SCP-2216-2-1 was discovered in the home of ██████ H███, a resident of Syracuse, New York on the 17th of August, 1983. Mr. H███ was apprehended by local authorities after security footage from the Musée d'Art Moderne (Trans: Museum of Modern Art) in Brooklyn, New York confirmed him as the perpetrator of an ongoing theft case filed by a Mr. ██████ D██████, a local artist and patron of the museum. At present it is believed that Mr. H███ was under the influence SCP-1999's anomalous effects when the theft occurred. Embedded agents recovered the DVD in accordance with SCP-1999 containment procedures, but remained unaware of its anomalous properties until it was viewed by Dr. ██████, who displayed symptoms consistent with SCP-2216-1 exposure. Due to the time frame for the onset of these symptoms, SCP-2216-2-1 was classified as an anomalous object by foundation agents (effective ██/██/19██). Upon discovery of additional SCP-2216-2 instances and SCP-2216-1 within, the DVD was reclassified as SCP-2216-2-1 (effective  ██/██/19██).

**Test Data:**

[[collapsible show="+ Test Log 2216-TL1.1: TE-2216-2-1 [Uncensored]" hide="- Hide"]]

__**Test:  - Date: January 14th, 19██**__
> **Subject:** D-15117
> **Procedure:** Subject D-15117 was placed in secure testing chamber with one (1) 32" flat screen television manufactured by ███████, one (1) VCR manufactured by █████████, one (1) DVD player manufactured by ████, one (1) Blu-ray player manufactured by ████, one (1) USB connection, capable of MPEG-4 playback and SCP-2216-2-1. All devices were connected to the television and checked for playback using non-anomalous media. One (1) closed circuit camera was placed over the door of the chamber with its lens obscured by an appropriate mirror. D-15117 was seated facing the door and television to avoid potential transmission vectors. D-15117 was informed to make note of any figures in the film which appeared abnormal or out of place in the video, insert SCP-2216-2-5 into the VCR, and begin playback.
> 
> **Results:** D-15117 did so with minimal rejection. D-15117 watched for approximately seven (7) minutes before noticing a humanoid figure walking behind the group shown in the video. Subject appeared unaffected by the presence of SCP-2216-1. Subject was instructed to cease playback but made no indication of having heard research team. Armed guards entered testing chamber to find D-15117 starting directly at them, suffering from severe epistaxis. Monitoring equipment in the chamber was interrupted for approximately 0.3 seconds by a blinding flash after which the chamber was empty. Carbonization consistent with that demonstrated during SCP-2216-3 events was discovered inside the testing chamber.
> 
> **Analysis:** D-15117 had no known connection to SCP-1999 or Mrs. Loewes prior to TE-2216-2-1 leading researchers to believe there is a significant relationship between SCP-2216-2-1 and SCP-1999 --and the group "Are We Cool Yet?"-- (Dr. █████, ██/██/19██) Following TE-2216-2-1, testing of SCP-2216-2-1 is strictly forbidden by order of O5-█.

__**Test: - Date: July 17th, 19██**__
> **Subject:** D-10224
> **Procedure:** Subject D-10224 (previously a court stenographer, convicted of [REDACTED]) was placed in a secure testing chamber identical to the one utilized in TE-2216-2-5. D-10224 was asked to transcribe the video in accordance with New York judicial transcription standards.
> 
> **Foreword:** Video begins with static for approximately twenty two (22) seconds. Over the next eight (8) seconds, video normalizes in a wooded area at night. Camera first depicts two individuals (hereafter A [male] and B [female]) facing the camera waiting to speak. Figures are illuminated by a light source from the operator's (hereafter C [male]) point of view.
> 
> **<Begin Log, [00:00:30]>**
> 
> **C:** Go ahead, we're rolling.
> 
> **A:** Okay, So were out here looking for signs of the witch...
> 
> **B (to A):** Give them some background.
> 
> **A:** Right, So we've been rolling up the east coast for about two weeks now and finding small towns with urban legends. We wanna go ahead and see if there's any truth to them, or at least if we can learn about the history behind them.
> 
> **B (to camera):** Right. Today we're in upstate New York about 15 miles east of Ithica exploring the Hammond Hill State Forest. We found a small local legend about a witch who lives in these woods. It was a little weird though, no one would tell her exactly what she does, or why they're scared of her. We're really just buying time on the trip to Boston but it should still be fun to explore.
> 
> **C:** Good.
> 
> **00:01:45:** [Camera pans down, C begins walking. Incomprehensible talking can be heard from the three subjects.]
> 
> **C:** Strange they wouldn't even tell us much about where to start looking. [A and B agree]
> 
> **00:03:01** [Camera pans up, focus on B while still moving forward]
> 
> **B:** Yeah, as you just heard from Francis, it was really hard to get the folks in this town to tell us anything. Not like it was much of a secret, just that they didn't seem to know. We did some digging in the local library and found that she seemed to have a big old house at the end of a road called Red Man Run. The one person we were able to get to say something mentioned that the house will only appear under a full moon, which, lucky for us, was tonight. Couldn't resist...
> 
> **00:03:47** [Subjects A and B arrive at a sharp embankment, beyond which lies a road.]
> 
> **A [to B]:** This is [indecipherable], right.
> 
> **B [to A]:** yeah, but I [indecipherable] need [indecipherable] south.
> 
> **00:04:21:** [Camera pans right, then downward as C traverses the embankment. A and B can be heard doing the same. Camera remains in this position as C proceeds forward]
> 
> **00:05:37:** [Camera pans up to A and B infront of a metal park services gate. Gate is closed. A jumps the gate and helps B follow. Camera pans down as C does the same.]
> 
> **00:06:01:** [Camera pans up, focus on A while still moving forward, A to camera] So this is Red Man Run. Supposedly the witch lives at a house at the end that will only appear--
> 
> **B [to A]:** They know that, Will! 
> 
> **A [to B]:** Right, so we'll head down here, see if we can find the house. Hopefully our witch is home...
> 
> **A:** What is that?
> 
> **00:07:03:** [Camera pans up showing a large victorian style house. House appears in good condition. At this point, per D-15117 during TE-2216-2-1, SCP-2216-1 moves past the left side of the camera, roughly thirty (30) meters from A and B. C makes no indication of it's presence.]
> 
> **A [to B]:** This is our house... [Subject A takes his phone from his pocket and proceeds to take several photographs]
> 
> **00:07:49-00:10:17** [REDACTED]
> 
> **B:** [camera seems to be held by B, taping herself. Background is shrouded in darkness] Where are we? Why did we come here? How do we escape? Let us out. Let us out! [B repeats phrases for approximately 2 minutes until video abruptly cuts (research conjecture suggests a state of parataxis).]
> 
> **<End Log, [00:12:11]>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** It is unclear whether any of the three subjects in the video had connection to SCP-1999 or GOI-"AWCY?". All three subjects were found at the end of Red Man Run with their hearts removed (Site awaiting classification as an instance of SCP-████) and the camera was discovered on top of a small pile of stones at a point concurrent to the northwest corner of the house in the video. The house mentioned in the video has yet to be located as presently satellite surveillance shows no house at the coordinates described. Until such a time as the nature of the video can be determined, no link between SCP-2216-1 and the events of the video has been established.

**Photographic Data:**

Following TE-2216-2-1, SCP-2216-2-1 was digitally copied to a foundation laptop and broken down by video forensics experts into individual still frames. At the time of TE-2216-3-1, SCP-2216-2-1 displayed the following image where D-15117 had spotted SCP-2216-1. (Image has been confirmed as non-anomalous).

Foundation proprietary facial recognition software has determined a 77% match between the two photographs. In light of this evidence, researchers █████ and ███████ suggest the existence of a link between Ms. Loewes and SCP-2216-1. Research is ongoing and further discoveries will be included as entries in this document.
