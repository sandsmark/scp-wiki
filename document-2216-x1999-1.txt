**Document Type:** Supplemental (XC-2216/1999)

**Security Clearance Level:** 4-2216/1999 Eyes Only, Need to Know Basis.

**Abstract:** Since roughly 1940, the name "Loewes" has been known to anomalously appear on objects found in museums in and around the New York area. In 1982, as part of ongoing MTF-Iota 9 operations, the video cassette now classified as SCP-2216-2-1 was taken into foundation possession by Agent █████ as an instance of SCP-1999. Upon routine testing of the cassette,  Dr. ██████ began to experience anomalous symptoms, consistent with SCP-2216-1 exposure. Upon the discovery of SCP-2216-1, SCP-2216-2-1 was reclassified as an instance of SCP-2216.

SCP-2216-2-1 is a focus of cross-SCP research for two reasons:
* It represents an instance of SCP-1999 attributed to a video storage device.
* It represents the prime instance of SCP-2216-2.

For these reasons, SCP-2216-2-1 is classified at the highest levels and only available to researchers appointed by unanimous O5 decision. This document exists as a database of pertinent information for the discovery of the presumed connection between SCP-1999 and SCP-2216. Additional information will be added as research progresses.

> A video cassette labeled 'Loewes'. Video appears to be a 12 minute home movie taking place in a wooded area. Refer to document 2216-11A for transcript of the video. At this time, research is ongoing to determine any connection between SCP-2216-2-1, SCP-1999 and the dadaist collective "Are We Cool Yet?".

At this point it is believed that "Are We Cool Yet?" is limited to imitation of SCP-1999 and not believed to be responsible for any anomalous instances.

[[collapsible show="Excerpt from SCP-1999 Description" hide="-Hide"]]

> SCP-1999 is a phenomenon whereby the name "Loewes" (sometimes stylized "LOEWES" or less frequently, "loewes") inscribes itself on the surface of objects through unknown means. [REDACTED FOR BREVITY]. Objects so far discovered with SCP-1999 written on them have had no similarities to one another other than having been located inside museums, a feature which has been instrumental in identifying fabricated instances. [REDACTED FOR BREVITY].
> 
> An object marked with the name produces an effect whereby subjects consider it the property of another person, even if it was originally theirs. [REDACTED FOR BREVITY]. Museum staff have on numerous occasions removed items from exhibits without prompting, later stating the object in question "is Elfie's". Seeing the name or knowing about its existence on the object is unnecessary for the effect to take place.
> 
> Analysis of affected objects suggests a frequency of occurrence between one and three months.

SCP-2216-2-1 was discovered in the home of ██████ H███, a resident of Syracuse, New York on the 17th of August, 1983. Mr. H███ was apprehended by local authorities after security footage from the Musée d'Art Moderne (Trans: Museum of Modern Art) in Brooklyn, New York confirmed him as the perpetrator of an ongoing theft case filed by a Mr. ██████ D██████, an aspiring local artist and patron of the museum. At present it is believed that Mr. H███ was under the influence SCP-1999's anomalous effects when the theft occurred. Embedded agents recovered the cassette in accordance with SCP-1999 containment procedures, but remained unaware of its anomalous properties until it was viewed by Dr. ██████, who displayed symptoms consistent with SCP-2216-1 exposure. Due to the time frame for the onset of these symptoms, SCP-2216-2-1 was classified as an anomalous object by foundation agents (effective ██/██/19██). Upon discovery of additional SCP-2216-2 instances and SCP-2216-1 within, the DVD was reclassified as SCP-2216-2-1 (effective  ██/██/19██).

**Test Data:**

[[collapsible show="+ Test Log: TE-2216-21-1 [Uncensored]" hide="- Hide"]]

__**Test: TE-2216-21-1 - Date: January 14th, 19██**__
> **Subject:** D-15117
> **Foreward:**  SCP-2216-2-1 is a video cassette labeled 'Loewes'. Video appears to be a 12 minute home movie taking place in a wooded area. Refer to document 2216-11A for transcript of the video. At this time, research is ongoing to determine any connection between SCP-2216-2-1, SCP-1999 and the dadaist collective, "Are We Cool Yet?".
> **Procedure:** Subject D-15117 was placed in secure testing chamber with one (1) folding metal chair, one (1) folding card table, and one (1) Sharp brand LCD television, and one (1) Panasonic VCR connected via component RCA cables to the LCD television and SCP-2216-2-1. All device connections were checked for playback using non-anomalous media. D-15117 was instructed to insert SCP-2216-2-1 into the VCR and begin playback, making note of any figures  in the video which appeared abnormal or out of place.
> 
> **Results:** D-15117 did as instructed without objection. D-15117 watched for approximately seven (7) minutes before noticing a humanoid figure walking behind the group shown in the video. Subject appeared unaffected by the presence of SCP-2216-1. Subject was instructed to cease playback but made no indication of having heard research team. Armed guards entered testing chamber to find D-15117 starting directly at them, suffering from severe epistaxis. Monitoring equipment in the chamber was interrupted for approximately 0.3 seconds by a blinding flash after which the chamber was empty. Carbonization consistent with that demonstrated during SCP-2216-3 events was discovered inside the testing chamber.
> 
> **Analysis:** D-15117 had no known connection to SCP-1999 or Mrs. Loewes prior to TE-2216-2-1 leading researchers to believe there is a significant relationship between SCP-2216-2-1 and SCP-1999 --and the group "Are We Cool Yet?"-- (Dr. █████, ██/██/19██) Following TE-2216-2-1, testing of SCP-2216-2-1 is strictly forbidden by order of O5-█.

__**Test: - Date: July 17th, 19██**__
> **Subject:** D-10224
> **Procedure:** Subject D-10224 (previously a court stenographer, convicted of [REDACTED]) was placed in a secure testing chamber identical to the one utilized in TE-2216-2-5. D-10224 was asked to transcribe the video in accordance with New York judicial transcription standards.
> 
> **Foreword:** Video begins with static for approximately twenty two (22) seconds. Over the next eight (8) seconds, video normalizes in a wooded area at night. Camera first depicts two individuals (hereafter A [male] and B [female]) facing the camera waiting to speak. Figures are illuminated by a light source from the operator's (hereafter C [male]) point of view.
> 
> **<Begin Log, [00:00:30]>**
> 
> **C:** Go ahead, we're rolling.
> 
> **A:** Okay, So were out here looking for signs of the witch...
> 
> **B (to A):** Give them some background.
> 
> **A:** Right, So we've been rolling up the east coast for about two weeks now and finding small towns with urban legends. We wanna go ahead and see if there's any truth to them, or at least if we can learn about the history behind them.
> 
> **B (to camera):** Right. Today we're in upstate New York about 15 miles east of Ithaca exploring the Hammond Hill State Forest. We found a small local legend about a witch who lives in these woods. It was a little weird though, no one would tell her exactly what she does, or why they're scared of her. We're really just buying time on the trip to Boston but it should still be fun to explore.
> 
> **C:** Good.
> 
> **00:01:45:** [Camera pans down, C begins walking. Incomprehensible talking can be heard from the three subjects.]
> 
> **C:** Strange they wouldn't even tell us much about where to start looking. [A and B agree]
> 
> **00:03:01** [Camera pans up, focus on B while still moving forward]
> 
> **B:** Yeah, as you just heard from Francis, it was really hard to get the folks in this town to tell us anything. Not like it was much of a secret, just that they didn't seem to know. We did some digging in the local library and found that she seemed to have a big old house at the end of a road called Red Man Run. The one person we were able to get to say something mentioned that the house will only appear under a full moon, which, lucky for us, was tonight. Couldn't resist...
> 
> **00:03:47** [Subjects A and B arrive at a sharp embankment, beyond which lies a road.]
> 
> **A [to B]:** This is [indecipherable], right.
> 
> **B [to A]:** yeah, but I [indecipherable] need [indecipherable] south.
> 
> **00:04:21:** [Camera pans right, then downward as C traverses the embankment. A and B can be heard doing the same. Camera remains in this position as C proceeds forward]
> 
> **00:05:37:** [Camera pans up to A and B infront of a metal park services gate. Gate is closed. A jumps the gate and helps B follow. Camera pans down as C does the same.]
> 
> **00:06:01:** [Camera pans up, focus on A while still moving forward, A to camera] So this is Red Man Run. Supposedly the witch lives at a house at the end that will only appear--
> 
> **B [to A]:** They know that, Will! 
> 
> **A [to B]:** Right, so we'll head down here, see if we can find the house. Hopefully our witch is home...
> 
> **A:** What is that?
> 
> **00:07:03:** [Camera pans up showing a large victorian style house. House appears in good condition. At this point, per D-15117 during TE-2216-2-1, SCP-2216-1 moves past the left side of the camera, roughly thirty (30) meters from A and B. C makes no indication of its presence.]
> 
> **A [to B]:** This is our house... [Subject A takes his phone from his pocket and proceeds to take several photographs]
> 
> **00:07:49-00:10:17** [REDACTED]
> 
> **B:** [camera seems to be held by B, taping herself. Background is shrouded in darkness] Where are we? Why did we come here? How do we escape? Let us out. Let us out! [B repeats phrases for approximately 2 minutes until video abruptly cuts (research conjecture suggests a state of parataxis).]
> 
> **<End Log, [00:12:11]>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** It is unclear whether any of the three subjects in the video had connection to SCP-1999 or GOI-"AWCY?". All three subjects were found at the end of Red Man Run with their hearts removed (Site awaiting classification as an instance of SCP-████) and the camera was discovered on top of a small pile of stones at a point concurrent to the northwest corner of the house in the video. The house mentioned in the video has yet to be located as presently satellite surveillance shows no house at the coordinates described. Until such a time as the nature of the video can be determined, no link between SCP-2216-1 and the events of the video has been established.

Following TE-2216-21-1, SCP-2216-2-1 was digitally copied to a foundation laptop and broken down by video forensics experts into individual still frames. At the time of TE-2216-21-1, SCP-2216-2-1 displayed the following image where D-15117 had spotted SCP-2216-1. (Image has been confirmed as non-anomalous).

[[collapsible show="Image Recovered from TE-2216-2-1" hide="-Hide"]]

[[=image Loewes_Obscured]]

Foundation proprietary facial recognition software has determined a 77% match between the two photographs. In light of this evidence, researchers █████ and ███████ suggest the existence of a link between Ms. Loewes and SCP-2216-1. Research is ongoing and further discoveries will be included as entries in this document.

**Final Addendum:**

[[collapsible show="+ Addendum 2216-YKE104" hide="-Hide"]]

> To my successor,
> 
> Congratulations on making it this far. The fact that you've managed to reach this final addendum means you're unusually resilient to the temptations that ended your predecessors. While researching 2216, I'd imagine you noticed several inconsistencies in containment procedures; it's time you know the truth.
> 
> That truth is, we honestly know next to nothing about 2216, and its containment is more a bad joke than legitimate procedures. SlumberingHourglass does a good job of preventing its spread through connected networks but it's transmission is very poorly understood. It (or they) moves from medium to medium in instances where it should be impossible. One time, Iota-7 found it on a projector reel stored in a basement in Idaho. We just don't know what the extent of it's transmission abilities are; the ones we do know of are worse.
> 
> Early on we did tests on SCP-2216-3p individuals to determine what causes SCP-2216-3 events. While under observation, we performed EEG scans of the subjects' brains and discovered that the ones who didn't die bleeding out their ears and nose had their brains lit up like Christmas. The only explanation we have for this is that somehow 2216 is able to transmit itself through the human retina and cranial nerve and stores itself in the posterior parietal cortex.
> 
> If SCP-2216-1 is able to store itself inside a human mind, it means that every person who has ever seen it is a possible transmission vector. It means anyone could be infected without knowing, and simply looking an infected person in the eye could spread it.
> 
> As 2216-3 events began to proliferate, we discovered the carbonization in the immediate vicinity of the subject, indicated the presence of particle/anti-particle interactions most commonly found during FK-Class Temporal Misalignments. If our theory is correct, SCP-2216-1 is actually a temporally displaced version of the person watching the video. Somehow, something is creating a Type VI Temporal Paradox, creating an imprint of the subject within the video. When the subject becomes aware of SCP-2216-1, aware of their own figure, the paradox enters their mind and is able to project itself in reality. 
> 
> The quantity of particle/anti-particle pairs present within such a paradox is worrying. Based on my calculations, SCP-2216-3 events will irreversibly damage the quantum fabric which comprises our reality by the year 19██, spiraling us toward a YK-Class Reality Restructuring Event by the year 20██. 
> 
> We need to find Loewes. It's my theory that she somehow started all this. Somehow, when SCP-1999 imprinted to a storage device, it's memetic properties were able to expand beyond just the name. It's possible that she's the force causing the paradoxes. We need you to figure out how. 
> 
> And why.
