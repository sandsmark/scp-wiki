**Item #:** SCP-2473

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2473 is currently stored in Hangar 37 of Site-43. Efforts in restoration and reverse-engineering of the object are ongoing. Normal procedures for delicate artifacts such as those found within SCP-2473 are in effect. Exposure of SCP-2473's photovoltaic panel to sunlight is required for no less than four hours per week.

Testing with SCP-2473-1 instances is restricted to D-Class personnel, with a preference for neurologically healthy individuals. At this time, testing with the objects is suspended. Normal procedures for testing surgical apparatus are in effect for SCP-2473-1 instances. Restoration of SCP-2473-1 instances is the primary priority for restoration crews because of their fragility. Individual test subjects must be given at least two weeks to recover between experiments.

SCP-2473-2 is currently in cryogenic storage at Site-43. Removal for study by approved personnel must follow instructions outlined in general Foundation guidelines for mummified human corpses.

**Description:** SCP-2473 is a vehicle apparently designed for atmospheric re-entry. It has the following approximate specifications: a 51-meter length, a 30-meter wingspan, a 65-meter height, and a total weight of approximately 110,000 kilograms.

SCP-2473 has no external marks, and appears to possess a form of ion propulsion. Hardware for docking onto a presumed launch vehicle is present. Gravity and visual sensors have been identified, alongside an apparent living quarters/cockpit. No 'payload' has been identified; instead, much of SCP-2473's interior is filled with computer hardware, apparatus for recycling air and human waste products, and a retractable photovoltaic panel (hexagonal in shape and approximately 8 meters in diameter). The apparatus for recycling human waste failed before recovery, while the oxygen-recycling system was still operational. All internal markings are in a language not currently extant on Earth; translation efforts are ongoing.

SCP-2473-1 refers to eleven identical chairs designed as brain-computer interfaces (as evidenced by internal hardware found during restoration efforts). The devices are equipped with polymer catheters designed to remove waste and provide nutrients, alongside several electrodes seemingly designed to directly stimulate the nervous system of occupants. All hardware within SCP-2473 appears to have suffered several centuries of oxygen-induced wear. SCP-2473-1 instances are arranged in a "V" shape within SCP-2473's primary chamber, the apparent living-quarters/cockpit, with the "bottom" of the "V" (SCP-2473-1-6) being closest to the nose of SCP-2473.

Only one SCP-2473-1 instance (SCP-2473-1-11) appears to have been occupied. The occupant, SCP-2473-2, was found in a desiccated, mummified state. Radiocarbon dating, genetic testing, and chemical analysis of bones and teeth have proven inconclusive on racial identity, lifestyle, and age of SCP-2473-2; the current working estimate is of 20,000 years (±5,000 years) between death and recovery. SCP-2473-2 was female and approximately 60 to 70 years old at time of death. SCP-2473-2 seems to have spent at least several years in microgravity prior to death, as indicated by signs of atrophy within most muscles and severe loss of calcium within the skeletal system. The electrodes of SCP-2473-1-11 were embedded at various points within SCP-2473-2's body[[footnote]]Detailed mapping of the electrodes and their respective locations within SCP-2473-2's body can be found in peripheral documentation.[[/footnote]]; bone and muscle growth around the objects indicates that they were connected for an extensive period. SCP-2473-2 appears to have been heavily bandaged and wearing a loose-fitting garment of unknown composition at time of death; cause of death is unknown at this time.

All computer hardware and sensor devices appear to have been functional at time of recovery; as such, maintaining charge on SCP-2473's power cells is considered a priority.

**Recovery:** On 13 October 2000, NASA and ESA facilities detected a brief emission of gamma radiation from a point unassociated with any celestial bodies; further observation detected no objects of interest observable at this point, prompting Foundation investigation of the anomaly. Later investigation via use of SCP-███[[footnote]]See [[[SCP-1795]]] and attached documents for information regarding SCP-███'s utility as an observational tool for astronomical anomalies.[[/footnote]] detected the object now classified as SCP-2473.

Based on observations made via SCP-███, it was determined that SCP-2473 was likely maneuvering with ion-based propulsion systems and appeared to be navigating towards near-Earth orbit. Monitoring via SCP-███ continued until observation through non-anomalous means could be established, on 15 April 2015. On 4 December 2019, it was determined that SCP-2473 was likely to attempt to land at sub-orbital velocities on the west coast of the North American continent. Negotiations with the US, Canadian, and Mexican armed forces were made to ensure that the Foundation would maintain full custody of the object regardless of landing site in exchange for Gen+ technology prototypes.

On 29 February 2020, SCP-2473 landed at a discreet military base in the Nevadan desert, apparently having intentionally navigated there. SCP-2473 was successfully transported discreetly to Site-43, with further investigation of the object resulting in its current containment status.

**Preface:** On 13 June 2031, SCP-2473-1 restoration efforts had reached a point wherein attempted experimentation of SCP-2473-1-1 with a D-Class test subject was proposed. On 1 August 2031, the proposal was approved, with one D-Class test subject tentatively assigned for FY 2032.

Experimentation began on 13 October 2031 with D-2473-01 (a physically healthy 29-year-old female with a background in computer science, hereafter referred to as 'subject'). Upon the subject sitting in SCP-2473-1-1, the electrical probes of the device automatically inserted themselves into the subject's dermis at points corresponding to large collections of nervous tissue, including the spinal column and central nervous system. The subject was immediately rendered catatonic, with monitoring equipment indicating a state similar to REM sleep. Body-fluid loss due to puncturing of the skin was noted; the subject was administered an intravenous saline solution and bandages were applied at puncture points to minimize injury.

After approximately four hours, the subject regained consciousness and all electrodes disengaged from her body. The included interview logs followed this initial experiment and subsequent experiments with the same subject.


__**Interview 001:**__
> **Interviewed:** D-2473-01
> **Interviewing:** Researcher Trudy Begay, Dr. Samantha Moodley
> **Foreword:** Interview was conducted by Researcher Trudy Begay, a member of the SCP-2473 Technology Research/Restoration Team, with Dr. Samantha Moodley, Head of the Team, overseeing. Interview was conducted shortly after D-2473-01 had been medically examined and administered necessary treatment for her injuries.
> **Transcript:**
> 
> **Researcher Begay:** Can you tell us what you experienced after you sat in the chair?
> 
> **D-2473-01:** I felt the damn needles jab into me for a second, then everything went black. When I came to, I was in the same chair, but no needles, and everything else was gone. None of you, none of the monitoring equipment, none of the guards, none of the lights you had set up inside that thing, nothing. It was just me and the spaceship.
> 
> **Begay:** Did you see any other changes you think are important?
> 
> **D-2473-01:** I was wearing some sort of robe, not the scrubs I'd been given for the test. And it was light inside of there. I could see everything, but it felt natural, not like the floodlights sitting in there now. I could hear birds singing, and wind blowing.
> 
> **Begay:** What did you do?
> 
> **D-2473-01:** I stood up and followed the light. Just around the corner of the hallway, it looked like the ship had cracked itself open, letting the sunlight in. There was a ladder from the spaceship to the ground, and outside I could see a massive, rolling, green field. Outside the ship, it was just grassy hills and birds singing, and in the distance I could see mountains, surrounding the whole plain.
> 
> **Begay:** Do you think this place corresponds to a real location?
> 
> **D-2473-01:** I don't know if that place is real anymore, but I think it used to be. (//Subject pauses momentarily.//) I just walked through that valley until I woke up in the real world again. (//Subject pauses again.//) I think I was seeing a scene from someone's childhood.
> 
> **Begay:** Can you elaborate? What gave you the impression?
> 
> **D-2473-01:** I can't say for sure, but the entire place gave me that feeling. I felt a sort of nostalgia for that place, even though I've never been there before.
> 
> **Begay:** Was there anything else of significance? Can you tell us more about the experience?
> 
> **D-2473-01:** I don't think the shadows got any longer the entire time I was there. I don't know how long I was there. It could have been minutes or days, it wouldn't make a difference on the impression it gave. (//Subject pauses briefly before continuing.//) I think something or someone might have been watching me.
> 
> **Begay:** What precisely gave you that feeling?
> 
> **D-2473-01:** I don't know. It's like the childhood thing. The place just made me feel that way.
> 
> **Begay:** Do you think you might be able to discern more information if you were connected to the device again?
> 
> **D-2473-01:** Hell if I know, but it's not like I have a say in the matter, and I'm at your mercy, so there's not much I can lose if I'm sent back in.
> 
> **Begay:** Thank you. I think that'll be all for now.
> 
> **End Transcript**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** Assessment of D-2473-01's injuries and consultation with her physicians indicate that D-2473-01 should be sufficiently recovered from injuries sustained during the SCP-2473-1 experiment within two weeks; following an audit by the Site-43 Ethics Committee Liaison, further experimentation has been approved.

__**Interview 002:**__
> **Interviewed:** D-2473-01
> **Interviewing:** Researcher Trudy Begay, with Dr. Shoshanna (Site-43 Staff psychologist and Ethics Committee Liaison) overseeing.
> **Foreword:** Interview was conducted as debrief following a second experiment involving SCP-2473-1-1. SCP-2473-1-1's electrical probes had been sterilized prior to initiation of the experiment and engaged as observed in Experiment 1. D-2473-01 experienced a physical reaction similar to that observed in Experiment 1, with the notable difference that D-2473-01 was unconscious for approximately 211 minutes, as opposed to Experiment 1's 235. When D-2473-01 assumed consciousness, she reported a similar experience. A log of the debrief interview following medical treatment follows.
> **Transcript:**
> 
> **Researcher Begay:** So, what can you tell us about this session in the chair? What happened this time?
> 
> **D-2473-01:** Same thing as last time at first. I woke up in the chair with a robe on, spaceship was dark, light was pouring in. Exact same startup, at least.
> 
> **Begay:** Did anything happen differently this time?
> 
> **D-2473-01:** Like I said, nothing at first. I climbed down the ladder leading out of the spaceship and started walking. It seemed the same at first, but then I noticed that there were clouds over the mountains. Big, dark clouds, the kind you see right before the thunderstorms that cause floods. I thought that was strange, but kept walking.
> 
> **Begay:** Was that it? Did you see anything new besides clouds?
> 
> **D-2473-01:** No. I kept walking, watching the clouds and the sky and listening to the birds, feeling the grass between my toes, enjoying myself how ever I could. Eventually, I came up over a small rise and saw a little girl sitting on the next rise, facing away from me. (//Subject pauses briefly.//)
> 
> **Begay:** What did you do next? Can you describe the girl in more detail?
> 
> **D-2473-01:** Uh, she looked to be about 14 years old. Maybe a little older. I don't know where I'm getting that impression from, but it feels right. She had dark skin, but I don't want to say she was black. Her back was to me, so I didn't see her face, but she had long, dark, flowing hair. I don't know why, but I felt like I had to sit down next to her.
> 
> **Begay:** Did you see her face when you sat? Any other physical details you can think of?
> 
> **D-2473-01:** No, I -- I avoided looking at her face. I don't know why, but it seemed like a good idea. We laid down and watched the sky for a few minutes, then she sat up and pointed at the mountains. I could see those clouds rolling, moving. After a few seconds, there was lightning and rolling thunder. Then I woke up in the chair with the needles sticking me again.
> 
> **Begay:** Do you know if what the girl did had any significance?
> 
> **D-2473-01:** (//Subject hesistates momentarily.//) If I had to take any significance from that, I'd say that she was telling me that there's always a warning before a flood. I don't think she can speak English, so she's resorting to metaphors and hoping it sticks.
> 
> **Begay:** All right, thank you very much for your time.
> 
> **End Transcript**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** Further testing with D-2473-01 is recommended.

> __**Interview 003:**__
> **Interviewed:** D-2473-01
> **Interviewing:** Researcher Trudy Begay, with Dr. Shoshanna overseeing
> **Foreword:** Interview was conducted as debrief following the third experiment session with SCP-2473-1-1. SCP-2473-1-1 had remained active for approximately 300 minutes, the longest activation session to date. No other abnormalities were noted during the active session. Upon resuscitating, D-2473-01 showed signs of deep emotional distress.
> **Transcript:**
> 
> **Researcher Begay:** So are you ready to tell us what happened?
> 
> **D-2473-01:** Uh, yeah, I think so. (//Subject sighs.//)
> 
> **Dr. Shoshanna:** Take your time, there's no rush.
> 
> **D-2473-01:** Ok, I, uh, I -- I woke up in the chair again, but it was colder this time. I could hear wind blowing outside the ship. I stood up and walked to the ladder, but everything was different. Before, the grass was green and everything looked, uh, everything looked safe. This time, the grass looked brown and dead. There were clouds overhead. I think they were the same clouds that me and that kid saw over the mountains last time. And there was wind kicking up dust. I knew everything was in my head, but I was -- I was scared.
> 
> **Begay:** So what did you do?
> 
> **D-2473-01:** I climbed down the ladder and started looking for the kid. I tried to shout for her, but I couldn't, and I wouldn't know what to shout anyway. I knew there was about to be a big storm, and I had to get her out of it. I had to get her to the ship. It felt like I had searched for her for a long time when I felt a big raindrop land on my face. I knew it was time to give up and get back to the ship. When I turned around, she was right in front of me, facing back towards the ship.
> 
> **D-2473-01** (//Speaking rapidly//): I was about to kneel down and start talking to her, face-to-face, but -- I can't see her face, I'm not supposed see her face. Doc, where was her face? What was wrong with her face?
> 
> **Shoshanna:** It's all right, we're here. You're not there anymore. Please, just keep telling us about what happened.
> 
> **D-2473-01:** All right, all right. I, uh, I picked her up, started running for the ship as fast as I could. Every time we've done this, the ship's been sitting on a small rise. As I got closer to the ship, the rain came down harder. Water was puddling and flowing at the low point before the ship -- I jumped over that and put the girl down so she could go up the ladder. She climbed up before me, then sat in the chair closest to the hole in the ship.[[footnote]]This seat is believed to coincide with SCP-2473-1-11, the seat that SCP-2473-2 was found in.[[/footnote]] I wanted to drag her to the back, with me, but it seemed like it was a bad idea. I ran to my seat, but as I got there, the whole ship felt like it'd been picked up and tossed.
> 
> **Begay:** Is that when you came to?
> 
> **D-2473-01:** Yes, that's right.
> 
> **Begay:** All right. Do you think there's any significance to any of this? Any idea on what this means, if anything?
> 
> **D-2473-01:** I think the little girl is the pilot. I think she was trying to tell me about what the ship was built for, what she was running from. You have to tell me, was there something sitting in the chair where the girl sat in the simulation? Every chair besides the one you sit me in looks like it's falling apart, and the other folks on the team don't seem to like going back there.
> 
> **Begay:** I'm afraid we're not allowed to disclose that, sorry.
> 
> **End Transcript**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** Dr. Shoshanna and representatives of the Ethics Committee have approved one more experimental session with SCP-2473-1 instances. D-2473-01 will be moved onto other projects following this test.
-----
> **__Interview 004:__**
> **Interviewed:** D-2473-01
> **Interviewing:** Dr. Moodley, with Dr. Shoshanna overseeing.
> **Foreword:** This interview was conducted following the final scheduled experiment with SCP-2473-1-1. D-2473-01's injuries from the previous experiment had sufficiently healed for the experiment to be conducted safely. This experiment session is the longest so-far recorded with SCP-2473-1-1, with SCP-2473-1-1 having been activated for approximately 460 minutes.
> **Transcript:**
> 
> **Dr. Moodley:** D-2473-01, I was informed that this last session with the device was completely different for you this time around. Do you care to elaborate? Are you ready to talk about it?
> 
> **D-2473-01:** Uh, yeah. This time, I didn't wake up in the ship. It wasn't so much a simulation, a VR, as it was a -- I don't know how to describe it. It was just images, flashes, snippets. I remember flashes of someone playing games in a house on the plain from the last sessions. I remember seeing the girl from last time go to school, and come home, and do normal little kid stuff. The house didn't look like anything I'd ever seen, and none of the people there were speaking English. I recognized some of the writing that I saw in the ship -- it looked similar. I remember seeing adults having conversations, they seemed scared and angry.
> 
> **D-2473-01:** At one point, the little girl and a man -- I think it was her father -- got into a vehicle like nothing I've ever seen, and went on a trip. It felt like it lasted weeks for them. They drove through some of the most beautiful landscapes I've ever seen, but no cities. When they stopped, they got into a spaceship -- a rocket, not that thing -- after spending the night someplace strange. It felt like a hotel, almost. The rocket launched, and connected to a space station. It looked a lot like those old NASA videos, the ones with the astronauts going to the ISS or the Apollo astronauts? Like that.
> 
> **Dr. Moodley:** Do you think you'd be able to read the writing inside the spacecraft, if we gave you the chance?
> 
> **D-2473-01:** No. I only caught snippets, not enough to learn anything.
> 
> **Dr. Shoshanna:** What about the girl's face? This entire time, you've made a point of not looking at her face.
> 
> **D-2473-01:** I have? That doesn't seem right. As for this time around, I was seeing it through her eyes, I couldn't have seen her face.
> 
> **Dr. Shoshanna:** All right, I'll leave it. Please, tell us what happened next?
> 
> **D-2473-01:** The space station was big -- as big as a small city, I think. It was spinning, had simulated gravity. We were there for a few days, when I noticed it was docked to another spaceship -- dozens of ships, actually, just like the one we've done the tests in. Everyone on the station seemed busy. I remember, the girl was worried about her mother, her mother was still back on the planet we'd left. Not too long after I noticed the other ships, the shuttles, I was shoved into one in a big hurry. The girl's dad, he kissed us -- her, I mean. He kissed her -- and left the ship to go get more supplies. Then the door closed, the ship turned on, and it flew away from the station.
> 
> **Dr. Moodley:** Did anything happen after that? Can you tell us anything else?
> 
> **D-2473-01:** The ship was connected to something else, some sort of cylindrical -- thing on the outside, the top. I don't know what it was. After the ship took off, I remember feeling scared -- terrified, alone, helpless. I didn't know what to do. So I eventually sat myself in one of the chairs, and I felt the needles again.
> 
> **Dr. Moodley:** What happened after that?
> 
> **D-2473-01:** I'm not sure. It felt like something was talking to me, telling me to turn around, go back. But I didn't know how. And it felt like the people on the space station were calling for me to come back, too. But I didn't know how to speak, I didn't know how to turn around, and eventually, they quit calling for me. I could still hear them talking for a while, it seemed like, but that went quiet, too. And after a while, it didn't feel like I was sitting in the ship anymore, it felt like the ship was rocking me to sleep.
> 
> **Dr. Moodely:** Is there anything else you can tell us?
> 
> **D-2473-01:** If I didn't know any better, I'd say that the last thing I heard before everything went quiet sounded like screaming. After that, it felt like everything was quiet for a long, long time, but eventually, I realized where I needed to be, where I was supposed to go. So I started running. But it wasn't like running, it almost felt like -- swimming in a big, deep, dark ocean, but I knew where I was going. And then I woke up in the chair.
> 
> **Dr. Moodley:** Thank you very much, D-2473-01. This has been insightful.
> 
> **End Transcript**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** Full significance of D-2473-01's experience during the final experiment is unknown. Dr. Moodley has filed a request for further tests at this time.
