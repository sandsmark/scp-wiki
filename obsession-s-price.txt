//The journal entries included with this report were recovered from Researcher █████'s official research notes on [[[SCP-589]]] following Incident 589-40. It is believed that Researcher █████ was the first researcher to come under SCP-589's effect.//

> Assigned to work on a new project today, first one since the hearing. I can still feel my hand shaking as I type this. Everybody thinks it was my fault that SCP-███ broke out, but it wasn't. How was I supposed to know that you needed to keep it at that temperature at all times, I was new! 
> 
> I really shouldn't dwell on it. I have a new fresh start. The new project is some kinda animal thing, that makes you want it all of the time. It was kinda frumpy looking, almost looked like the one I had when I was living with dad, Freddy. They say only Level 4's are supposed to see it, so I dunno if I was supposed to...but I really don't need anymore trouble.

> Second week on the project, and things might be looking up. Paul has been complimenting me on my diligent work, and I haven't gotten one reprimand yet. But I hope they let me see the doll soon. If I work my best they might let me see the doll. What I've been thinking lately is that it might really be Freddy, and that would be something else. 

> This is taking too long. I have submitted 3 requests for access, and they have all been denied. Ridiculous. Nobody else has worked on this as I have, I deserve to be able to check for my childhood friend. I thought Paul was my friend. He looked at my paper and you know what he did? //He laughed.// if I can't find a way to get access this way, I'm going to have to find another way in. 

> I did it. I found a gap where security isn't around for a 4 minute window. I used my access pass to get in, and there it was. i think it really is freddy. I picked him up, and I helped him stand. I took a picture with my phone so I can have him with me. Everybody needs to see him. Everyone deserves to see it.

> Got Alan in today. He was just as enthralled as I was. Said it smelled like his grandmas house. Kind of weird, but whatever, he deserved to see it. Had a close call with security, but I managed to talk my way out of it. Alan's on board with showing more people, and I have an idea of who I want to show next.

> Something is wrong something is very very very wrong. Paul is asking me funy questins, and everyone on site seems to be on edge. Security was looking at our workstations today and Alan was taken away. The people we showed were being given funny looks. I don't know whats going to happen

> All gone. Freddy isn't in the cell. Nobody knows where he went. He isn't on my phone he isn't in the photos he isn't anywhere at all. I really hope that we can find him soon. Susan was starting to panic, but I calmed her down. We'll find it. 

> I can't find it. I looked everywhere. I looked inside the cell, outside the cell. I searched everybodys room. Went outside and scoured the area, couldn't find anything. People are starting to get unhinged. Susan jumped out a window and broke. Need to find it before someone else gets hurt.

> Paul must have it. he's the only one who I didn't search his room. he was the only one who we didn't show. It must be him. A couple of the guys and I are going to talk to him after hours today. Sure that he'll be cooperative.

> Went through Paul today. Nothing in his room, nothing in him. He told us he had it when we had him, but he didn't he is a liar. We hid him in Jess's room, and cleaned up the bathroom. Next one we search is the Director.

//Shortly after this entry was written, Researcher █████ and the remaining research staff attempted to access the Directors office. After a confrontation with security, Researcher █████ led a riot within Site-██, resulting in over 40 casualties, and the death of all SCP-589 personnel. Following this, the body of Paul Rothberg, lead researcher of SCP-589, was found in the dormitories. SCP-589's containment procedures have been updated, and reclassified as Keter.//
