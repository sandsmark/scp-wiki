    **Item #:** SCP-598

    **Object Class:** Safe

    **Special Containment Procedures:**
SCP-598 is contained in a five by five by five (5x5x5) meter room which has been painted solidly with Behr brand "Pearly White" paint. The floor is mirrored. Three (3)  bright lights are positioned on the ceiling in such a way so that all the room is lit. These lights are to remain lit for 24 hours every day and are attached to a backup generator in case of power outage. The room will be examined for mold or stains daily, and these will be immediately removed if found.

 Two level-2 guards, at least one of whom displays moderate extrasensory abilities, are to be stationed outside SCP-598’s room at all times. Supervised contact with SCP-598 is unrestricted to all personnel with Level-2 access. All are subject to searches before and after contact, and random psychoanalysis afterwards.

Unless permission is received from a Commander, tools such as knives, scalpels, mirrors, paint-peelers, or cameras are restricted.

    **Description:**
SCP-598 is a sentient color covering the whole of the inside of its room, similar in shade to blue-violet. Attempts to reproduce SCP-598 with paints, crayons, etc., have failed. SCP-598 can hear and see, to a limited degree, but cannot speak nor move autonomously, nor communicate using normal senses. SCP-598 is, however, telepathic, and has gained scores upwards of 200 on intelligence tests. It is capable of amplifying psychic abilities in other humans, so that it can hold extended mental conversations to those with even minor abilities. It enjoys the topics of music, art, and science. It displays a slight interest in the SCP foundation, although it is likely that this has to do with its immediate surroundings, and not for sinister reasons.

SCP-598 is not a physical organism. It is not paint, although it currently is living on white paint in its room. It does not move, grow, eat, sleep, or excrete waste. It reproduces by reflection- once it has been reflected onto another surface, it will remain there. SCP-598 does not remain on mirrors, nor does it remain on living organisms or clothing. It appears able to control what surfaces it remains on, unless it is reflected onto a mirror, from which point it can be directed.

An interesting phenomena occurs whenever short-wave radio is within 4 meters of SCP-598. They will begin to pick up a previously out-of-range station which can broadcast different noises. 
As of yet, the following have been recorded:
•	Wolf-like howling
•	Whale song
•	High-pitched chirping noises, revealed to be bat noises brought into human hearing frequencies

SCP-598 does not seem to know where these noises originate, yet enjoys a radio placed in the room and tuned to this frequency. The noises switch at random, and go on for hours at a time.


    **Addendum:**
It has been suggested by Dr. ███████████ that a sample of SCP-598 be introduced to [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-085 SCP-085]. Pending approval by Commanders and all involved parties.
