**[[[SCP-2904]]] - Pale Imitation**
//"SCP-2904 displays symptoms of major depressive disorder, including dangerously low self-esteem and a general inability to find pleasure in activities. Proximity to SCP-2904 leads to the development of the same symptoms in human beings. Symptoms usually first appear in human subjects after about one hour, and last for a duration proportional to an amount of time spent in SCP-2904’s presence after first onset. However, subjects possessing preexisting depressive disorders or family histories of depressive disorders experience these symptoms much more quickly and for greater periods of time, sometimes permanently. Recovery rates vary among human subjects, but thus far, SCP-2904’s mental state has not been noticeably improved by any amount of counseling, therapy, or psychiatric assistance."//

**[[[SCP-2520]]] - Dryer Messiah**
//"Any article of clothing that is dried by SCP-2520, hereby designated SCP-2520-1, gains the ability to move independently. Methods of locomotion vary depending on the article of clothing, but most instances of SCP-2520-1 move by contracting and expanding in order to pull themselves along the ground. Instances of SCP-2520-1 are incapable of communication, but demonstrate enough intelligence and sensory perception to recognize and differentiate individual human beings."//

**[[[SCP-2622]]] - Ambassador from the Mole People**
//"Subject claims to be an ambassador-at-large to humankind from a civilization that it calls 'the Terra Interia Empire'. According to SCP-2622, the Terra Interia Empire encompasses over 500 million kilometers of tunnels and caverns within the Earth’s crust, inhabited by animals, plants, and sapient species completely unknown to humankind...  SCP-2622 claims that humankind engaged in frequent diplomatic relations with the Terra Interia Empire hundreds of thousands of years in the past, and that a cataclysmic event – the nature of which SCP-2622 refuses or is unable to specify – permanently divided the two cultures. Foundation investigations have so far failed to substantiate any of SCP-2622’s claims."//
