**[[[SCP-2606]]] - Verminous Vessel**
//"SCP-2606's anomalous effects activate when a human subject ingests the tissues or bodily fluids of certain types of animals by eating or drinking them directly from SCP-2606. The animal in question must be one that the subject would not normally eat and that the subject regards with disgust, contempt, or irrational fear, or that the subject considers a threat to the health and well-being of human beings as a pest, a parasite, or a vector of disease. Animals that have induced the activation of SCP-2606 include bats, most rodents, many scavenging birds (crows, gulls, vultures, etc.), lizards, snakes, numerous frog species, and almost all invertebrates, with the only exceptions being those that subjects consider "edible" (crabs, snails, squid, etc.)."//

**[[[SCP-2622]]] - Ambassador from the Mole People**
//"Subject claims to be an ambassador-at-large to humankind from a civilization that it calls 'the Terra Interia Empire'. According to SCP-2622, the Terra Interia Empire encompasses over 500 million kilometers of tunnels and caverns within the Earth’s crust, inhabited by animals, plants, and sapient species completely unknown to humankind...  SCP-2622 claims that humankind engaged in frequent diplomatic relations with the Terra Interia Empire hundreds of thousands of years in the past, and that a cataclysmic event – the nature of which SCP-2622 refuses or is unable to specify – permanently divided the two cultures. Foundation investigations have so far failed to substantiate any of SCP-2622’s claims."//
