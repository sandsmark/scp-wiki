**Name:** [DATA EXPUNGED] alias "Mr. Smalls"

**Security Clearance:** Level 2

**Position:** Anomaly Documentation Specialist (Safe-class)

**History:** [DATA EXPUNGED].  At this point, Mr. Smalls was killed in action following a containment breach of SCP-████.

Following his death, Foundation agents involved in consolidating Mr. Smalls' records for archival purposes were able to find no history on Smalls, including that which would confirm or detail his employment in the Foundation, and no personnel involved in his recruitment were able to recall the circumstances under which he entered Foundation employ.  The prevailing theory among Foundation research staff was that Mr. Smalls was an anomalous cognitoparadox, ceasing to exist when not directly observed.  Consolidation of records relating to Mr. Smalls was cancelled.

Following the declassification of this information to Clearance Level 2 personnel, Mr. Smalls resumed work.  He was henceforth placed under 24-hour clandestine observation.

**[[[SCP-2622]]] - Ambassador from the Mole People**
//"SCP-2622 claims that humankind engaged in frequent diplomatic relations with the Terra Interia Empire hundreds of thousands of years in the past, and that a cataclysmic event – the nature of which SCP-2622 refuses or is unable to specify – permanently divided the two cultures. Foundation investigations have so far failed to substantiate any of SCP-2622’s claims."//
