**Name:** [DATA EXPUNGED] alias "Mr. Smalls"

**Security Clearance:** [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Position:** [DATA EXPUNGED]

**History:** [DATA EXPUNGED].  At this point, Mr. Smalls was killed in action following a containment breach of SCP-████.

Following his death, Foundation agents involved in consolidating Mr. Smalls' records for archival purposes were able to find no history on Smalls, including that which would confirm or detail his employment in the Foundation, and no personnel involved in his recruitment were able to recall the circumstances under which he entered Foundation employ.  The prevailing theory among Foundation research staff was that Mr. Smalls was an anomalous cognitoparadox, ceasing to exist when not directly observed.  Consolidation of records relating to Mr. Smalls was cancelled.

Following the declassification of this information to Clearance Level 2 personnel, Mr. Smalls resumed work.  He was henceforth placed under 24-hour clandestine observation.  All records on Mr. Smalls were expunged in an attempt to remove him from existence once more.  This attempt, and all subsequent attempts, have failed.

All records mentioning or involving Mr. Smalls are to be rewritten or destroyed.  Foundation personnel are urged not to speak to or make physical contact or eye contact with Mr. Smalls in case of cognitohazardous effects.  Foundation personnel are urged not to interact with or recognize Mr. Smalls.  

Do not engage with Mr. Smalls.  Do not acknowledge Mr. Smalls.  

Do not attempt to locate Mr. Smalls.

**[[[SCP-2328]]] - The Hoarder's Son**
//"SCP-2328 habitually contains the refuse it produces in bags, which it produces continuously from the green filter on the left-hand side of its gas mask. However, SCP-2328 will become sullen, withdrawn, and generally highly uncooperative at the prospect of the refuse it generates and contains being disposed of or destroyed."//

**[[[SCP-2622]]] - Ambassador from the Mole People**
//"SCP-2622 claims that humankind engaged in frequent diplomatic relations with the Terra Interia Empire hundreds of thousands of years in the past, and that a cataclysmic event – the nature of which SCP-2622 refuses or is unable to specify – permanently divided the two cultures. Foundation investigations have so far failed to substantiate any of SCP-2622’s claims."//
