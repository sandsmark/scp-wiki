**Item #:** SCP-726

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** A single pair of human SCP-726 samples are to be contained at site-17 in a padded cell for their own safety, cleaned of any waste matter at 24 hour intervals. A diet of mixed vegetable slurry is adequate for their nutritional needs. A jar of smooth peanut butter may be provided to pacify subjects during cleaning and examinations. On a quarterly basis, subjects shall be provided a pair of mixed sex cadavers and terminated after successful reproduction. Absolutely no other animal tissues of any kind are permitted in the enclosure at any time.

**Description:** SCP-726 are physiologically and genetically identical to the eggs and larvae of //Lucilia sericata//, a species of blowfly common world wide in warm climates. When larvae hatch on decomposing animal matter, they begin to consume nonliving tissues as normal until none remain, at which point they collect at a central point and begin to regurgitate a continuous stream of healthy, living cellular matter. If uninterrupted, SCP-726 will "reconstruct" a complete body matching that of the original tissue source. The reconstruction process occurs at high speed, resembling footage of maggot activity in reverse, and ends with the full restoration of life functions as all larvae abruptly vanish.

While otherwise restored to optimum physical health, any organism reconstituted by SCP-726 exhibits only the mental processes of a mature blowfly. Instances instinctively follow the wafting odors of decaying organic materials and attempt to consume them via licking and sucking actions. Instances of all species move clumsily and periodically spasm in an apparent attempt to beat nonexistent insect wings, with avian and chiropteran examples failing to achieve flight by their usual means. Proximity to any source of decaying flesh will excite subjects into mating behavior, coupling without regard to original species. Any mechanically successful copulation will produce a fertile clutch of SCP-726 eggs, which reconstructed females attempt to deposit on any appropriate food source.

SCP-726 has proven capable of replicating a complete body from any volume of flesh regardless of its condition, including multiple copies of the same body from disconnected fragments. Reconstructed bodies that have subsequently expired can be reconstituted again by SCP-726 like any other tissue sample, but are subject to an increasing degradation of accuracy (see attached Generation Log)

**Discovery:** On August 16th, 19██ a Mrs. ███████ of ███████, ████ ████████ was discovered nude in a dumpster behind a local ██████ ████, engaging in [REDACTED] with a large male [REDACTED] and subsequently hospitalized for acute dementia. Over the following weeks, locals reported outbreaks of abnormal animal behavior, including large numbers of domestic cattle, swine and poultry inconsistent with local livestock. Foundation operatives deduced the reproductive habits of SCP-726 and discovered animals reconstituting from meat scraps in the dumpster where Mrs. ███████ had been found. During containment sweeps, ██ identical instances of Mrs. ███████ were found wandering the woods near her property. Under interrogation, Mr. ███████ admitted to the murder and dismemberment of his wife.

**Test Log:** 8/17: Dr. ██████ SCP-726 Generation Log

**Sample:** porterhouse steak.
**Result:** mature steer, normal except for dipteran behavior and appetites. Eagerly consumed dung and raw, spoiled meat.

**Sample:** one (1) fillet of salmon.
**Result:** one (1) mature, male salmon. Spasmed violently as though "drowning" when placed in water. Flopped haphazardly when removed from liquid but did not display stress as it asphyxiated.

**Sample:** one (1) fried calamari ring.
**Result:** one (1) adult male squid, immediately placed in pool of water. Flailed and convulsed helplessly until removed from liquid. Dragged itself crudely with tentacles, actively consumed animal feces.

**Sample:** one (1) D-class with large infected gash on ankle, SCP-726 eggs applied to area following the traditional procedures of maggot therapy.
**Result:** dead tissues were consumed and reconstruction proceeded until wound was healed. Subject entered an apparent daze and did not respond to questioning, later revealed to be an instance of SCP-726. Subject terminated.
//Oh wow, how does THAT work?! I guess we can rule out any medical application.//

**Sample:** fine paste of ███ assorted insects and arachnids. 
**Result:** ██████ reconstructed arthropods behaving as flies. All females produced SCP-726 eggs.
//Thankfully, dead insects don't usually smell enough to attract blowflies in the wild, otherwise this would have already spread far out of control.//

**Sample:** fine paste of ███ blowflies. 
**Result:** single, abnormally huge fly. Quickly expired.
//Well, that was...weird. Too bad about the square cube law, I'd have loved to observe it further.//

**Sample:** one (1) freshly killed Norwegian rat, cut in half.
**Result:** SCP-726 reconstituted two versions of the same rat, their coat patterns mirror images of one another.

**Sample:** remains of duplicate rats from previous experiment, processed into a fine paste and mixed. 
**Result:** SCP-726 separated sample into two portions and reconstructed nearly the same two copies, one with a red right eye.

**Sample:** remains of least divergent duplicate rat, processed into fine paste.
**Result:** rat reconstituted with slight limp, blind in both eyes.
//I'm going to see how far I can take this little guy.//

**Sample:** heart from blind rat.
**Result:** reconstituted without eyes or pigmentation. Squeaks incessantly.

**Sample:** heart from eyeless rat, cut in half.
**Result:** two eyeless rats. One only walks in tight circles, other completely devoid of hair and unusually aggressive towards the first.
//The insect behavior appears to be degrading with the physiology.//

**Sample:** scrap of flesh from hairless rat.
**Result:** eyeless, hairless and limbless. Fails to return fully to life. Braincase found to contain a liver.

**Sample:** liver from "brainless" rat.
**Result:** eyeless, hairless and limbless with elongated "worm-like" midsection, nodules scattered throughout body appear to be incomplete eyes. Drastic increase in aggression, eventually begins to consume its own posterior end and expires from blood loss.
//Wow!//

**Sample:** fresh, complete remains from previous rat.
**Result:** large, formless mass of tissues and viscera, trembles until extinguished.

**Sample:** portion of previous result.
**Result:** large, slug-like, motile mass of undifferentiated cells. Appears to absorb nutrients through skin.

**Sample:** portion of previous result.
**Result:** identical to previous test.
//This went on for a while. I've decided to keep the latest "slug" for long-term observation. I'm calling him Brundle.//

**Sample:** beef from four separate cattle, finely processed into a bologna sausage.
**Result:** SCP-726 sorted sample into multiple small piles and reconstituted four complete cattle.

**Sample:** a slice of beef, pork and turkey bologna.
**Result:** [REDACTED]
//What the ███ were those even remotely supposed to be?//

**Sample:** single corpse from previous experiment, ground into paste.
**Result:** [REDACTED] exhibiting extreme hostility to moving objects. All termination attempts failed. Specimen frozen.
//I liquefied this thing and it kept moving.//

**Sample:** thawed sample of previous result.
**Result:** [REDACTED] exhibiting properties similar to SCP-███. Incinerated.
//Jesus H. Christ. I'm not messing around with these things anymore. I might even put Brundle down.//

 **Addendum:** testing of SCP-726 has been discontinued following Dr. ██████ recent findings. The samples at site-17 should be closely monitored for any inconsistent behavior or abnormal growth.
