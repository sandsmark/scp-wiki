**Item #:** SCP-855

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Four (4) members of security are to be present outside SCP-855's location at all times. No staff are to enter SCP-855 during "Horror", "Surreal", "Action", "Science Fiction" or "Disaster" phases. Any entities attempting to leave SCP-855 during the "Horror" phase are to be dispatched by security staff. 

Any personnel entering SCP-855 during its "Western" phase are to be monitored by security staff for signs of aggression. During all other phases, research staff are free to enter and monitor SCP-855.

**Description:** SCP-855 is the designation given to Lecture Hall ██, located at Site ██. SCP-855 is equipped to seat fifty (50) personnel. One reinforced skylight is present on the ceiling to allow the entry of natural light.

Each month, SCP-855 will redecorate itself and temporarily develop anomalous properties, seemingly themed after genres of films. This has manifested in:

* Manifestation of entities
* Mind-altering Effects
* Hallucinations
