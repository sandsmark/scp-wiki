[[size 120%]] **UIU File 1948-019:** Case File "Snail Shells"[[/size]]
**Summary:** Human-like creature, resembling a snail. When exposed to humans, covers them in slime. If successful, this slime will transform the person into a creature similar to the original, albeit without the irregular effect.

[[tab Suspect Description/Capabilities]]

**Irregularity Cross-reference:** Non-human, transfiguration, predatory, insect.

**Physical Description:** The creature is a human male, constantly excreting a thick slime. Has large antennae protruding from its face, which act as eye stalks and react similarly to the eye stalks on snails. Has a hunchback, with a large snail shell perched on its back. The material making up this shell scores a 7 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness.


||~ Sex ||~ Height ||~ Weight/Build ||~ Race ||~ Hair ||~ Eyes ||~ Identifying Attributes ||
|| N/A || 5' 7" || 143lbs, average || White || Black || Black || Resembles a human combined with a snail, covered in slime. ||

**Capabilities:** When it interacts with human subjects, it will attempt to cover them with its slime. It appears that, when used in this context, the slime acts as an intoxicating agent and makes reaction time sluggish. Once completely covered, they will emerge after a metamorphosis. This causes them to resemble the creature.

Humans are very grateful for the 'service' that the creature has provided for them, and will profusely thank them for their service. Humans altered in this way are unable to reproduce its effect, but will attempt to introduce others to the creature. Therefore, it has been deemed prudent to euthanize them.

**Purpose/Motive:** Self-propagation or reproduction, as no corresponding "originals" have been found, it is believed its effect is the only means by which it can reproduce.

**Modus Operandi:** Creature will attempt to lure humans to a secluded area by crying out for help, usually in a voice resembling the opposite sex. In addition, it may place goods such as cash or clothing from persons it has already transformed.

**Behavior:** Docile, but it will attempt to come after and transform any person it is capable of perceiving.

[[tab Evidence]]

**Slime Sample:** Slime appears to be benign once it is removed from the source. Any application by UIU agents onto test volunteers has resulted in no intoxicating or ill effects. However, the slime will stain clothing in a method which is not possible to remove, despite extensive testing. Possible field use in this regard is pending.

**Shell fragment:** As mentioned previously in file, tests at a 7 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness. Since this feature is reproduced onto the affected persons, it is possible to harvest the shells indefinitely, for possible use in future operations. However, this possibility has been ruled out due to the gross loss of human life it would require in order to produce a useful sample size.

**Dissected transformed persons:** Dissection following euthanasia has revealed that the internal structure of the hump holding up the persons shell is composed completely out of benign cancerous tissue. The eye stalks also appear to be made of this tissue, although how it properly functions is unknown. Several glands found inside the skull may produce the slime, however these glands were noted to decompose rapidly following the persons death, becoming non-existent after 8 days.

[[tab Bureau Record]]

**Current Status:** In a holding cell located within UIU HQ. Poses no threat. Under light surveillance.

**Crimes:** Criminal alteration of human bodies and minds, theft, indecent exposure.

**Sentencing:** Indefinite detention.

**History of UIU Action:**

01/19/1948: First notice of the creatures activities come from Baltimore, Maryland. Several police reports over a period of two months regarding missing persons turning up with bizarre changes to their memories and bodies. These persons were pressing for their loved ones and for law enforcement to go to an abandoned restaurant. After several law enforcement officers went missing, the FBI became involved.

03/22/1948: UIU agents enter Baltimore, and interview survivors and affected persons. Those affected are quarantined, and those aware of their condition are paid a substantial sum to prevent them from speaking out about the incidents. Newspapers reporting the incident are withdrawn voluntarily by the publishers, and do not leave the Baltimore area.

09/02/1948: A raid on the restaurant in question results in the capture of a suspect, as well as the recovery of the personal belongings of every missing person. Several misinformed transfiguration were also discovered, and several were summarily euthanized by supervising agents. Application for indefinite custody presented to the State Department.

02/17/1949: Indefinite UIU custody is confirmed, suspect moved to UIU HQ.

[[tab Additional Information]]

Interview with Victim-011.

AGENT FREDERICKS: Hello, Mister Alford. Are you feeling okay today?

VICTIM:(Pauses to wipe slime from face.) Yes, actually. I'm feeling fantastic.

AGENT FREDERICKS: Even with your current condition?

VICTIM: Can we not call it a condition? I prefer to think of it as a gift.

AGENT FREDERICKS: Why is that?

VICTIM: I was a loser before this. I took a long train ride to a boring job where I didn't talk to anyone, then came home to have a glass of milk and go to bed. Every day, in and out. Weekends I just stayed in bed. That was until I decided to break up the routine, and go out to a restaurant.

AGENT FREDERICKS: The restaurant you were rescued from?

VICTIM: Sure, sure. I went there, and it was out of business. I thoght it was rotten luck. But that's when I heard her, calling to me. I thought someone might be in trouble, so I peeked inside, and that's when the baptism started. I was born again! I... was changed, certainly, but it really let me get a new lease on life. I'm not some boring guy. I'm unique! I came out of my shell!

AGENT FREDERICKS: Out of your shell?

VICTIM: I've still got a sense of humor, sir. She left me with my faculties, and gave me a new lease on life. I can't thank her enough for that.
