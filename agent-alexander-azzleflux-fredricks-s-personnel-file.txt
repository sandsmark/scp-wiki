title:Agent Alexander "Azzleflux" Fredricks's Personnel File
**Name:** Alexander "Azzleflux" Fredricks

**Security Clearance:** 3

**Occupation:** Recovery Agent

**History:** Agent Fredricks was involved in the recovery of SCP-███, which resulted in the death of ███ whales. After showing remarkable mental resilience despite witnessing mass cetacean death, Fredricks was recruited by the Foundation on 08/20/97. However, further Foundation investigation revealed that approximately 50 deaths as a result of the incident were not due to the effects of SCP-███, as they were killed via [REDACTED] rather than [REDACTED]. Agent Fredricks was suspected of the unexplained deaths, but no evidence to this conclusion was found. As such, Fredricks is not to be assigned to any objects dealing with marine organisms and is permanently stationed at landlocked Site 23.

**Note:** //Please keep in mind that we are a mature community filled with the brightest minds and should act as such. Therefore, regardless of personal relations with Agent Fredicks, please refrain from referring to him as Agent Azzleflux, Agent Assholefucks, and especially Agent B███s██. All personnel found violating this note will be appropriately slapped on the wrist and required to have a personnel reevaluation meeting with Site Director Langley at an appropriate location. His treat.// -Site Director Roger L██████.

##white|Okay guys, so, this is where I'll talk a little about each of my articles, if I can. Just because I like the idea of doing so.##

##white|SCP-1357 was started by me joking around and throwing the picture up in chat and saying "scp fuel guys." Roget dared me to write a skip around it, so...I did. I put a lot of work into this one and got a lot of help from people, and I'm really happy with the result. EDIT: This was also my first +50 ^u^##

##white|SCP-1517 was born out of both my love for lollipops and jawbreakers and my horrible, horrible fear and revulsion towards cicadas and such. It's my first real successful article that I've come up with completely on my own (all of the rest of them so far have been based upon other peoples' ideas and articles ._. Hopefully, I can change that in the future).##

##white|SCP-1610 was conceived and written within about 24 hours. I'm pretty proud of myself for writing it in that short of a time. Anyways, it was just something I was playing around in my head with, and I thought, "Hell, let's write it up and see where it goes."--,,Also, this may or may not have been subconsciously influenced by my playing of Portal 2 for approximately 12 hours in the three days before I wrote up this article ._.,,-- REGARDLESS, I think it's one of my stronger articles, personally, and I'm damn proud of it.##

##white|SCP-1705 was originally based on the Pre-Mass Edit SCP-605, a Skeletal War Machine, which was pretty much what it sounds like. From there, I kind of just...ran with it. I liked the idea of biological machines, but I didn't want it to be a "everything is the same except they use these instead of this" type of thing. So, I loosely developed an idea of what I wanted the machines to be based upon. What did I choose? Frat boys. It evolved into objects of pleasure and tomfoolery for a city of slackers. More over, I wanted to be subtle, so...I made them ambiguously violent and had the researchers interpret this as a "warrior culture." Of course, they only found a small fraction of the bones that the //entire// civilization created, but they don't know that. I'm still kinda working on this one.##

##white|How the SPC Ruined Halloween should not have survived. I don't understand //why// it survived. It was a spur of the moment thing based on an overused Foundation meme that I thought could be an --okay-- entry to the 2012 Halloween Contest. I posted it right before work, I came back shocked when I saw that the rating was, in fact, //not// in the negatives, even when the first ten comments were "Downvoted because of SPC." Apparently, it was well written enough that some people didn't even care. This is what really encouraged me to start writing more for the site. At the moment, it's my highest rated piece. God knows why.##

##white|Rapture was my very, very first sticking article on the site, as well as my lowest rated one. It came from the idea //Hey, why hasn't anyone set up that angel that feeds on high pitched noises to that thing that constantly emits them? And while we're at it, it's an angel, why not give it a Church?// So yeah. I wrote it up, was too impatient for draft review, and it pleasantly wasn't received too horribly.##

##white|Sympathy for an Empath was written for the 2012 Christmas Trade. My gift recipient was Kalinin, who asked their gift-giver to make something weird out of one of their skips. So, I took their SCP-1097 (Liquified Empath) and turned it into an interpretation of a Mister. I do remember being afraid that it wouldn't be liked because "TOO MUCH DAMN WONDERTAINMENT," or shoehorning a GOI, or something out of irrational fear that I'm pleased has proven to be baseless.##

##white|Three's a Crowd is based on one of my personal favorite articles on the site, SCP-428 (The Crowd) by Dr Scooter.##
