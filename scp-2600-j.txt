**Item #:** SCP-2600-J

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2600-J is to be held within a standard containment chamber, located within Site-77. Personnel assigned to work with SCP-2600-J are to be given standard identity protection methods, such as fake beards and wigs. All personnel above D-Class assigned to work directly with SCP-2600-J should not be able to ride a bicycle, or have ever ridden any vehicle with fewer than three wheels.

All bicycles located within Site-77 are to be given protection from possible abductors.

**Description:** SCP-2600-J is a bicycle, manufactured by the Schwinn corporation in 1996. It is fully mobile, and will attempt to run down and abduct any personnel assigned to its containment, usually followed by an escape attempt. Other than this, SCP-2600-J displays no anomalous properties.

Occasionally, media appearing to demand SCP-2600-J's immediate release will be delivered to Site-77. These will usually be accompanied by portions of bicycles which have been removed very roughly, such as portions of the frames and torn-up chains. Media will usually consist of pieces of paper covered in menacing tire tracks, ransom notes composed of newspaper clippings signed by the "Bicycle Mafia," or videos depicting several fedora-clad bicycles spinning their wheels aggressively.

Personnel are advised not to let SCP-2600-J's cohorts intimidate them

The remains of the tricycle depicted in the video were delivered to Site-77 over the next 6 months. One piece at a time.

**Addendum:** The Site-77 bicycle rack was compromised, with over twenty bicycles being stolen. Only a single broken lock was found at the scene.
