title:Research Assistant Arnold Goldsheiner's Personnel File
**Name:** Arnold Goldsheiner

**Security Clearance:** Level 2

**Location:** Sites 19, 17, Area ██

**Biography:** Goldsheiner was from west Philadelphia, born and raised, on the playground is where I spend most of my days. Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool and all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school, when a couple of guys who were up to no good started makin' trouble in my neighborhood! I got in one little fight and my mom got scared and said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle to an international, top secret, multi-trillion dollar organization to slave the rest of your life away under the confines of a desk."

It is believed by many of the Junior Staff that Goldsheiner is the second-oldest member of the Foundation, right behind that really old dude who probably babysat for Moses or something. At the present time, Goldsheiner is too old to walk without assistance and always uses a cane or a walker, or is helped along by --another staff member-- a D-Class [see Incident 190F-F4-G55FW-H6F, “Jerry Expresses a Dislike of Oatmeal”].

Arnold Goldsheiner is colloquially called “Reject” rather than his given name due to the fact that nobody likes him and he has no friends. Rumors of his penis length vary from “none at all” to “20 inches, natural” to “no penis, just a hand holding a walker.” Goldsheiner is a senile bastard and a cynical old fart. No attempt should be made to communicate with the subject. And he smells like socks.

Since nobody likes him, Research Assistant --Loser-- Reject is not permitted to have a workbench. We make him stuff it all on to his desk, between the dentures and pill bottle.
