**Item #:** SCP-3589

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3589 is contained in a Standard Humanoid Containment Cell in Site-31. SCP-3589's current arms and upper body are to be immobilized in polymer gel #MCN119, replaced monthly. Nonbiological arms composed of valuable materials may be melted down or otherwise scavenged, while biological arms are to be cryogenically preserved when not undergoing research.

**Description:** SCP-3589 is Armando Rivera, a 34-year-old Mexican-American man. 

SCP-3589's anomalous properties manifest when one of its arms is severed or forcibly torn from it. At this point, an amorphous growth, composed mainly of stem cells, will appear on SCP-3589's stump. This growth will rapidly differentiate and grow into a new arm within 1.1 seconds. SCP-3589 claims to feel no pain during either this process or the initial removal. 

SCP-3589 is capable of forcibly pulling off its own arms with little resistance or difficulty despite the arm not exhibiting any uncharacteristic strength. However, attempts to remove arms by any other person, or by machinery, require approximately quadruple the tensile force otherwise predicted to dislocate a human shoulder. 

SCP-3589's detached arms can be composed of a large variety of materials and are not universally human in morphology[[footnote]]The first nonhuman instance resembled the right arm of a brown bear (//Ursus arctos//).[[/footnote]].

Approximate 30% of arms generated by SCP-3589 resemble nonanomalous human arms. DNA testing of these arms shows them to be genetically identical to living people; these people do not exhibit any anomalous properties or awareness of SCP-3589. Arms composed of gaseous, liquid, or amorphous materials retain their shape. Compositions of removed arms appear to be generated at random.

Detached biological arms remain viable indefinitely despite their lack of sustenance once removed from SCP-3589's body. The upper ends of these arms self-seal all blood vessels and grow a covering of similar material within 0.4 seconds of removal.

SCP-3589 remains capable of limited motor control of its arms after detachment, with the degree of coordination and control over them correlating inversely with the number of instances SCP-3589 attempts to control simultaneously. SCP-3589 receives limited sensory information from severed arms, mainly touch and proprioception.

**Addendum 3975-01:** During an unrelated containment breach, SCP-3589 attempted to escape in the ensuing chaos. SCP-3589 was noted to have discarded dozens of arms until it had generated several dense metallic ones. SCP-3589 interlocked these arms around its body to protect itself, and attempted to flee Site security while wielding more arms (corresponding to //Therizinosaurus//, scorpions, and various volatile chemicals) as makeshift weapons.

Dr. Rosa Marquez, critically injured in the initial breach, was attempting to activate Site lockdown procedures when one of SCP-3589's discarded human arms landed near her and fused itself to the stump of her severed arm. SCP-3589 lost control of all arms currently active, and the arms rapidly converged towards Dr. Marquez.

Dr. Marquez was surrounded by over 200 arms, dozens of which fused to her at their bases, while the remaining arms gripped each other to form a complex polyhedral cage. This cage contracted until it formed a spherical shell approximately 2m in diameter and remained in this state for about 4 minutes, after which all arms comprising the structure disengaged and fell to the ground motionless. SCP-3589 subsequently remained unable to feel or control any of these arms, although none of them have decayed. 

No trace was found of Dr. Marquez.
