**Item #:** SCP-2538

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** No weapons, armor, or other items generated by SCP-2538, are allowed outside of the containment chamber. At least 2 security personnel must guard SCP-2538 at all times. Security officers will rotate in shifts accordingly.

**Description:** SCP-2538 is a large van with a set of seats in the back, along with several containers. The vehicle has several crude steel plates attached to the sides and windows. SCP-2538 has no visible license plating and manufacturer labels. Due to this, manufacturer and previous owner of SCP-2538 are unknown. The left side of the vehicle has a spray painted rectangular symbol with the letters "R. S." written below.

When opened by an outside source, several objects will appear inside SCP-2538's back compartment. The objects known to appear include:

* 4 sets of tactical bullet resistant vests
* 4 loaded M4A1 carbine rifles
* 2 bags of plastic explosives
* 4 masks depicting various animals[[footnote]] The animal depicted on the masks are random. Common appearances include arachnid and insect species.[[/footnote]]
* 20 magazines of 5.56x45mm NATO cartridges 

Upon opening SCP-2538 again, a new set of the aforementioned items will appear, and will cause all previous items to disappear, regardless where they are. Any objects placed inside SCP-2538's back compartment will also disappear once a new set is created. Alongside this, any damage to SCP-2538 disappears after it is out of sight of human subject. 

SCP-2538 was first discovered by the Foundation during a sudden increase in certain crimes in Belgrade, Serbia. Each incident involved at least 4 criminals preforming armed robberies, or weapon trafficking. Serbian reported all evidence, such as masks, ammunition casings, and empty magazines, disappearing almost immediately after suspects evaded capture.

Foundation forces managed to track SCP-2538 to an abandoned warehouse near the waterfront. SCP-2538 was recovered along with a phone hidden inside the vehicle's glove compartment. After recovery the incidents of crime decreased. It's currently assumed SCP-2538 was involved in the crimes directly or indirectly.

**Addendum 2538/01 02/04/10:** The phone recovered from SCP-2538's glove compartment contained several audio recordings. Each recording dated from 3 months, to 2 days before recovery. These recordings are view-able by personnel of level 2 clearance and above.

> **Caller Name: Dragan**
> 
> Hello Marco, just calling in to check on the progress. Listen, I've got an idea what to do with those parts you got from those salesmen. Meet me in the warehouse in 2 hours, we'll talk there.

> **Caller Name: Dragan**
> 
> Nice job on the car Marco, just got the photo you sent me. You think we'll be able to use this for some jobs soon? The amount of cargo we could haul in this along with all the gear it makes is going to get us rolling in money! Call me back when you're ready to hear the pitch.

> **Caller Name: Dragan**
> 
> The job was a success man! You can use your old phone now, I've already "hidden" the ones we used for the job. Cops shouldn't know what we were up too. We're going to turn Belgrade into our own damn empire. Marco, let's do this! Call me if you find another job we can do.

> **Caller Name: Dragan**
> 
> Alright, the deal is in place. This syndicate's got deep pockets man, we could have hit a gold mine. The crates are already on their way, whenever you're ready, head for the warehouse and bring the van. Let's hit pay dirt.

> **Caller Name: R.S Rep.**
> 
> Greetings. Allow me to introduce myself, I am Markov of the Richter Syndicate. You and your partner Dragan's work has gotten our attention for a while. With the success of this deal, I'm happy to welcome you as one of our workers. Your paratech van will be useful in future missions. It will save us a fortune. I'll call you if any work comes up. Remember your place Marco.

> **Caller Name: Markov**
> 
> Marco, in light of your van's side effects on our goods, we're not allowing its use in transporting. This has displeased many of my superiors, but it must be done to maintain the status of our products.  We will allow you to continue working on our operations with the same pay. We apologize for anything inconvenient that may arise from this. Keep in touch Marco, maybe we'll allow you to use it as an escape vehicle in the future.

> **Caller Name: Contractor**
> 
> Marco, there is an offer that I believe you should made aware of. MC&D, the club in London, has asked to buy your van. They want to auction it off to the highest bidder. You recent jobs have drawn attention to it. According to them, there's plenty of people who would benefit from having it. In return, they'll give you 25% of the profits from the purchase. Now my, and now YOUR superiors, have accepted the deal. You'll have 2 weeks to get the van into top shape before the deal. Call me back if you have questions. 

> **Caller Name: Dragan**
> 
> Marco, don't go through with the syndicate's deal, it's a con. Their boss told me, said they just want your van so they don't have to rely on you "lending" it. They probably want to sell it to some heister gang or something, I don't know. He wanted me to try and trick you into going through with it, like I was going to betray my business partner. Whatever you do, don't let them take the van. If I call again, don't answer. Don't call me back after this, I need to try and go off the grid as soon as possible. I don't know if they've bugged your phone or not. This might be the last time we talk. If it is...then goodbye my friend.

> **Caller Name: Psychotic Bastard**
> 
> Marco, I understand you've been paranoid lately with the death of your partner, but we need you to continue with the MC&D deal. This could be a big profit, for you and my syndicate. Don't bail on us just because some idiot you're friends with tried to "prevent" a "con." Counting on you Marco.

> **Caller Name: Psychotic Bastard**
> 
> Marco, due to your sheer incompetence, crippling paranoia, and the fact you're purposely attempting to destroy syndicate property, I'm afraid to say you've become too much of a nuisance to bother with. That van was special to us, it could have been such a great deal for you and me. But for now, I eagerly anticipate your body bag arriving at my doorstep in at least a week. Goodbye forever you Serbian rat.

Research is currently underway regarding the "Richter Syndicate" mentioned in the recordings. Whereabouts of "Marco" or other POIs are currently unknown.
