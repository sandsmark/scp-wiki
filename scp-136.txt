**Item #:** SCP-136

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** No extraordinary containment procedures are necessary.  SCP-136 is to be kept in a standard 10x10x10 meter concrete containment room.  SCP-136-1 is to be kept in a transparent plastic case, measuring 0.5x0.5x0.5 meters, placed on a table in the center of the room.  Video surveillance is unnecessary when SCP-136 is not being actively examined (see Description).  As of incident I-136-c (see Incident Reports), only Class D personnel may enter the SCP-136 containment chamber more than once in any thirty day period without special direct authorization from Director ██████


**Description:** SCP-136 has no effect on non-humans.

SCP-136 is an entirely incorporeal phenomenon.  SCP-136-1 is of variable appearance, but generally manifests as a crude clay, wood, metal, or cloth doll, usually identifiable as female and usually between 20 and 30 cm in length.  The doll appears as male on approximately 10% of viewings.  The doll has on no occasion manifested with any sort of pigmentation or coloration, but rather as simply a misshapen figure.

SCP-136-1 does not physically exist.  It does not reflect or absorb any sort of light, and therefore is not captured on video.  When placed on a scale, it has no measurable mass.  It can not be detected or measured in any way besides human senses.  It does respond to external stimuli, as a gust of wind from a fan will move the SCP and it can be manipulated with any sort of instrumentation, but the air from the fan will pass through the doll uninterrupted and no measurable force is exerted by the manipulator.  The form of 136-1 changes upon each viewing.  Dr. Meyers has concluded that all stages of SCP-136 exist only as psychic projections.

SCP-136-2 manifests only when SCP-136-1 is viewed visually for approximately twenty minutes, though like 136-1 it has no measurable form.  The first indication of SCP-136-2’s presence is a sound of laughter of a gender corresponding to the appearance of 136-1.  Personnel who hear the laughter report it as sounding “creepy” or “scary.”  The laughter lasts for an interval of anywhere from five seconds to two minutes, after which is a period of silence, usually of about five minutes.  After the period of silence, the laughter returns  coming from no discernible direction, along with a visual figure that appears suddenly, along with the disappearance of 136-1.

The form, designated SCP 136-2, is of a nude or partially nude figure corresponding to the gender of 136-1.  136-2 is always posed in an obscene and usually graphic manner, and moves slowly through the air towards the subject(s).  If more than one subject is present, each will see the form as moving towards him or herself.  As it approaches, the volume of the laughter increases.  The figure is described as terrifying by all test subjects.  By the time 136-2 is within 1 to 2 meters, the subject will usually either go rigid in fear, collapse to the ground, or, for those with a stronger constitution, back up until they hit a wall and are forced to stop.  As it floats, the figure is completely rigid, not moving even its mouth to produce the sound of laughter, until it is within approximately 5 cm of the subject.  It will then open its mouth to emit a piercing scream before vanishing.  About ten seconds later, SCP-136-1 will reappear in its previous location in a different configuration.

The apparition has a very disturbing appearance.  It’s mouth is far too wide, frozen in a rictus of pain and arousal.  It will occasionally bare its teeth or lick its lips.  Its irises take up almost the entire sclera of its eyes, which appear mad and bloodshot.  If female, it will have an absurdly narrow waist and large breasts, and if male, an erect phallus of impossible proportions.  The experience of viewing 136-2 is profoundly upsetting and has universally caused night terrors for up to six months in every single subject, possibly as a result of its psychic intrusion.  After a viewing, most subjects are unable to leave the containment room without assistance.  Interestingly, Class D personnel with a history of sexual deviancy still experience a strong negative reaction to 136-2.

--At no point has SCP-136-2 been observed to move past the boundaries of its containment room.--  See Incident report I-136-a


**Additional Information:**

SCP-136 was recovered from the master bedroom of an abandoned house in [DATA EXPUNGED] that was reportedly haunted.  A routine sweep of such reported homes by Foundation personnel discovered 136 when Agent ████ fell from a second story window, screaming. 


**Incident Reports:**

**Incident I-136-a, ██/██/19██**

Dr. Simon was the twenty-fifth subject to view 136-2, and the fourth to do so voluntarily.  Nothing unusual happened during the viewing, which proceeded in the usual manner.  Approximately two hours after viewing 136-2, Dr. Simon, who was in the break room with several other researchers, screamed and dropped his coffee mug.  He incoherently indicated that he could see 136-2 floating down the hall towards him.  Drs. Morris and Harrison restrained him, assuming that he had simply been badly shaken by the experience.  After approximately two minutes, all present in the room fell unconscious.  Dr. Soboya recovered first and proceeded to awaken her colleagues.  Dr. Simon had lapsed into a coma, and died three days later.

--Dr. Meyers requests reclassification as Keter class
--Reclassification as Keter class denied.  We cannot dismiss the opportunity that the unfortunate incident wasn’t caused by some other telepathic SCP.

**Incident I-136-b, ██/██/20██**

//It happened again today.  Agent ████ had shoved a few Class D's into the room, and he was standing outside with █████.  136 had finished doing its thing, and I was helping them drag the subjects out of the room when everything went black.  I woke up to Agent █████ smacking me in the face and three Class D’s in comas.  This thing is killing people.  We haven’t learned anything new from this thing in ten years, and we can’t use it.  I request that we find a way to terminate 136, maybe get a psychic SCP in here with it.
--- Dr. Meyers//

Request for termination denied.  136 is proving valuable for enhanced interrogation.

**Incident I-136-c, ██/██/20██**
//This is out of control now.  You all saw what happened, hell, everyone in a thousand yards will never forget// [DATA EXPUNGED]//, and the Class D in the room with gone and nobody knows how.  At the very least, we need to do some more rigorous screening of the D’s before sending them in, we would have found out that he was// [DATA EXPUNGED] //ahead of time.  At least we know what set it off this time.  Request reclassification to Keter and attempts for termination of 136.
-- Dr. Meyers//

Request denied.  Dr. Meyers is to be removed from administration of SCP-136.  Oversight of 136 is to be given directly to Overseer ██████ and Dr. ███████ for exclusive use in enhanced interrogation.
