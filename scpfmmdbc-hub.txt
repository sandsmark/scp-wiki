+ Rules

[[collapsible show="+ Show 2017 Rules" hide="- Hide 2017 Rules"]]
In case you weren't around last year, or are unfamiliar with how this works, here's a brief breakdown of the process (copied (mostly) from last year's rules):

**STEP ONE:** Nominate SCPs

If we're going to host a deathmatch, we first need the --unwilling-- willing participants. If you would like to nominate an SCP, please do so in this thread; don't hesitate, because we'd like to get a full 64. You can nominate as many as you'd like, and myself and my crack team of deathmatch organizers will sift through the nominations and make the final decisions on which SCPs to enter into the tournament.

Some notes about nominations - due to the nature of certain SCPs, there are some that would pretty easily break the contest. To that end, a couple of rules are necessary:

No SCPs that are completely invulnerable.
No SCPs that are immortal.
No SCPs that are concepts or locations.
No SCPs that are super massive (think Hateful Star, the Leviathan, etc.)
-J's are totally fine.

**NOTE:** Additionally, no participants of last year's Sweet Sixteen are eligible. Those SCPs include:

* SCP-777-J - Darkblade [CHAMPION]
* SCP-2050 - Sciurine Crusaders
* SCP-2206 - Phoenix Firebirds
* SCP-1860 - Its Bleeding Song
* SCP-1784 - Skywriter Sloths
* SCP-2103-J - Hatbot
* SCP-466 - Mobile Veins
* SCP-1569 - Jumbo Shrimp
* SCP-2406 - The Colossus
* SCP-743 - Chocolate Fountain
* SCP-2521 - ●●|●●●●●|●●|●
* SCP-075 - Corrosive Snail
* SCP-2776 - Mr. President [RUNNER-UP]
* SCP-1360 - PSHUD #31
* SCP-553 - Crystalline Butterflies
* SCP-2030 - LA U GH IS F UN

**RULE UPDATE:** All entries in the 2015 SCPMMDBC, except the champion (SCP-1867) are once again eligible for entry.

**STEP TWO:** Organize Entries

All entries into the contest will first be organized and arranged so as to fit the format (for example, SCP-610 would not be the entire anomaly, but more likely an afflicted entity of some kind). Then, the aforementioned crack team of deathmatch organizational staff will review each of the entries, and give each entry a set of offensive and defensive stats. During the deathmatch, these stats will be fed into a ~~super sekrit combat simulator~~ which will determine the outcome of the match.

**STEP THREE:** Place Yer Bets

Once the field is set and the stats are in place, I'll link in here to a tournament bracket where you can review the matchups and make your predictions. All users will be able to create a maximum of 3 brackets.

**STEP FOUR:** BATTLE ROYALE

Then the contest starts! Each round will be completed within a single day, with a few days in-between before the next round. Winners of each match will be announced in this thread and on the tournament bracket website, and a special event will be held for the championship round.

**STEP FIVE:** Claim yer booty

Once the tournament has concluded, the organizers will review the user-submitted bracket predictions. The overall winner of the bracket challenge will be the user(s) with the most overall points in their bracket. Additional details as to how the scoring system works will be announced once the field is prepared and the bracket is opened.

That all being said, if you have any other questions, please feel free to ask below. I'll try to get to as many as I can, and if there are any good questions I'll edit them into this post.

I hope to get as many users as possible onboard this hype train, so start nominating SCPs and get ready for that sweet, sweet March Madness!
