**Item #:** SCP-4446

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4446 is saved on a computer originally owned by Dr. Fisher.
As SCP-4446 cannot be copied or otherwise replicated without its copy loosing its anomalous properties, the computer itself has to be stored and therefore named SCP-4446-a.

SCP-4446-a is an otherwise normal functioning computer and does not require additional containment procedures. SCP-4446-a is stored inside a standard damp free containment container located on Site-12.

**Description:** SCP-4446 is a 792x495 bitmap (.bmp) image of a common landrace pig. In most cases SCP-4446 behaves as a normal .bmp file. These cases include copy and pasting, moving inside of SCP-4446-a, renaming and observing its code via any method.

SCP-4446 can not be deleted or edited. Any attempt to do so is prompted by an alert, that sufficient administrative rights are needed, even if executed as an admin. Methods of bypassing this alert have so far been unsuccessful or resulted in non-anomalous duplicates of SCP-4446.

The anomalous effect of SCP-4446 occurs when observing it via any image viewing software that support zooming by mouse clicks, key binds or buttons, including photo galleries, image editing softwares, games that use SCP-4446 as a texture and browsers.
When zooming into SCP-4446 any sliders, numbers or equal information indicating how far zoomed in one currently is, are immediately set to their maximum possible value. These states won't change, unless zooming out again to SCP-4446's original pixel size of 792x495.

SCP-4446 can possibly be zoomed into indefinetly, as SCP-4446 is fractually defined. It's branches mostly equal that of the original Pig depicted by SCP-4446, but can take on other forms aswell.
These are mostly different breeds and species of pigs, including wild boars, various landraces, bearded pigs, SCP-████ and others aswell as text concerning pigs.

Zooming into any specific branch depicting something else than SCP-4446 will result in new sub-branches being related to that specific branch. See test logs for examples.

Zooming into SCP-4446 takes increasingly more effort for SCP-4446-a to process. SCP-4446-a becomes too slow to properly work after a magnitute of roughly ████.
