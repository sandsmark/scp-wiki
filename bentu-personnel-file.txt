title:Bentu's Personnel File
I'm Bentu. I write things from time to time. Here's some things I have written in the past:

Linville Arc

> [[[SCP-3025]]]: Lucidity (The Feather)
> [[[SCP-3058]]]: Concavity (The Mirror)
> [[[SCP-3066]]]: Absurdity (The Cabin)
> [[[SCP-3076]]]: Avidity (The Raven)


[[[SCP-3098]]]: Triviality (The Antenna)
[[[SCP-3148]]]: Tranquility (The End)

Some personal facts: 
I'm studying to be an Aerospace Engineer, and I'm loving it so far. I love hiking in the mountains and biking. Outside of writing, I also enjoy drawing. My favorite band is The Naked and Famous, with Logic as a close second. My favorite book is Ender's Game, and pretty much always has been. An unexpected truth: even though I've been a part of this site for a month or two, and have written 6 successful scips, I still feel new here. Bentu, AKA The Forever Novice. I like it.
