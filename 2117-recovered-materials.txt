The following is a log of items on [[[SCP-2117]]] either retrieved or documented by MTF-Omega-2. Anomalous technology (weapons systems and fuel sources) as well as non-technological anomalies (such as literature or food of extra-universal origin) are classified as SCP-2117-A instances. Instances are classified arbitrarily as opposed to sequentially.

**Instance #:** SCP-2117-A-03-0192
**Classification:** Thermal Exchange System
**Primary Language:** Sanskrit 
**Technical Contents**: Four 15 km by 2.5 km retractable radiator panels connected to a system of pipes filled with liquid sodium. Pipes connect to heat sinks fitted (in most cases retro-fitted) to approximately 60% of //Solidarity//'s systems.
**Notes:** In the event of damage to this system molten sodium is likely to be released into nearby compartments. Heat producing systems not currently connected should be evaluated and connected if deemed necessary.
**Local Inscriptions:**

> * "Warning: Molten Sodium Metal"
> 
> *  "They will die in the shadows of our wings."
> 
> * "What an over-engineered piece of crap. Why didn't they just use Maxwell's Demon?"
> 
> * "The beverage in this pipe is an intoxicant. I am now seriously impaired."

> * "This should work if it wasn't for the heretical symmetry. We will unfortunately need to build our own radiator system that is not offensive to the gods."

**Instance #:** 52-2312
**Classification:** Latrine
**Primary Language:** Papiamento, Classical Nahuatl and Marshallese
**Technical Contents:** Series of 36 watertight cubic booths, each with a door and containing various equipment. Four booths (numbered 6-9) contain standard Western-style commodes, two booths (numbered 28 and 29) contain squat-style floor toilets. Booths 33-36 have been combined into a single booth containing one oversized Western-style commode two meters in height. The other booths generally contain unrecognizable or unfamiliar equipment such as an apparatus resembling a treadmill, a live tree, a series of hoses and spigots which release a pungent thixotropic slime, a series of showerheads that release heated sulfuric acid, and a cylinder to which there are attached several lengths of artificial musculature resembling tongues.
**Local Inscriptions:**

> * (above the doors of particular booths) "Demi-Male," "Demi-Female" and "Demi-Neuter"
> 
> * (inside a booth) "Here I sit, broken-hearted" (rest is illegible)

**Instance #:** 58-8718
**Classification:** Unknown (possibly rations preparation?)
**Primary Language:** Khwarezmian and Quapaw (transcribed into Devanagari writing system)
**Technical Contents:** Large, rectangular open room with floor area in excess of 6 square kilometers but ceiling height of only 1.1 meters. Lighting apparatus in ceiling appears to simulate a night sky including several nearby but dim stars. Floor is covered with an irregular soil surface with several shallow puddles of water connected by natural-appearing waterways. Much of the soil surface is covered with moss-like plant life. Room is serviced by sophisticated climate control system capable of simulating rainfall, snow and other forms of weather, all on a miniaturized scale. Room contains an ecosystem of small animals, including large herds of mouse-sized ungulates and ant-sized pack predators. Life forms in room have been determined to be harmless to humans.
**Local Inscriptions:**

> * "Where the deer and the antelope play"
>

**Instance #:** 06-0233
**Classification:** Rations preparation
**Primary Language:** Yiddish, transcribed into Duployan shorthand (archaic shorthand formerly used to transcribe French)
**Technical Contents:** Hydroponic mushroom-growing facility. Facility is a zero-gravity cylinder, 6 meters in diameter and 18 meters in length which rotates to simulate gravity (acceleration of 10.2 m/s2 at internal surface). Facility contains a number of trays containing unremarkable soil, //Agaricus bisporus// (unremarkable, human-edible common white mushrooms), and an irrigation system.
**Notes:** System appears to be operational. Members of OTF 2117-Ω have harvested and consumed mushrooms to supplement their rations during expeditions to SCP-2117 without adverse result.
**Local Inscriptions:**

> * "Mortuary. Please behave decorously."
> 
> * "Fungus is dangerous. Do not mate with them."
>

**Instance #:** SCP-2117-A-0076/59-9103
**Classification:** Weapons platform manufactory, hangar, and catapult 
**Primary Language:** Pidgin comprising of romanized Japanese, Cyrillic script, and English.
**Technical Contents:** Massive zero-g hangar containing large, humanoid weapons platforms measuring 18-20 meters in height; said weapons are armored with unknown titanium-based superalloy containing Helium-3. Control system seems to be designed for use by a baseline human. Two catapults are located behind equally large blast doors, presumably for launching weapons. Similar door located at rear of hangar, leads to sub-hangar presumably used for constructing new units. 
**Notes:** Active weapons platforms act similar to a mild EMP. Hangar hardened against such attacks.
**Local Inscriptions:**  

> * "Okay, who the hell thought giant robots were a good idea?"
> 
> * "These things are weird as [REDACTED], but pretty powerful."
> 
> * "Contains the preserved bodies of fellow mechanoids. Rest in peace."
