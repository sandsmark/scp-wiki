The following is a log of items on [[[SCP-2117]]] either retrieved or documented by MTF-Omega-2. Anomalous technology (weapons systems and fuel sources) as well as non-technological anomalies (such as literature or food of extra-universal origin) are classified as SCP-2117-A instances. Instances are classified arbitrarily as opposed to sequentially.

**Instance #:** SCP-2117-A-03-0192
**Classification:** Thermal Exchange System
**Primary Language:** Sanskrit 
**Technical Contents**: Four 15 km by 2.5 km retractable radiator panels connected to a system of pipes filled with liquid sodium. Pipes connect to heat sinks fitted (in most cases retro-fitted) to approximately 60% of //Solidarity//'s systems.
Notes: In the event of damage to this system molten sodium is likely to be released into nearby compartments. Heat producing systems not currently connected should be evaluated and connected if deemed necessary.
**Local Inscriptions:**

> * "Warning: Molten Sodium Metal"
> 
> *  "They will die in the shadows of our wings."
> 
>  * "What an over-engineered piece of crap. Why didn't they just use Maxwell's Demon?"
> 
> * "The beverage in this pipe is an intoxicant. I am now seriously impaired."
