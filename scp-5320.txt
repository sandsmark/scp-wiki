**Item #:** SCP-5320

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Underwater drones 5320-A-D are to monitor their respective locations along SCP-5320’s body. Video feeds are to be checked once every 24 hours for any change in SCP-5320’s shape or location. SCP-5320’s current locations are mapped and may be accessed with permission from Dr. Keul. 

SCP-5320 can be formally referred to as The Fish That Just Goes On Forever, Our Merciful and Long Lord, or Its Glorious Infinitude, Hail Its Everlasting Fish Body. Chances of locating the head or tail of SCP-5320 may be increased by offering sacrifices in the form of vending machine snacks placed on top of the break room microwave. Removal of present offerings is strictly forbidden. [[footnote]] Offerings must be left on the microwave in order to preserve the site’s current internet speed. Internet may slow if offerings are removed, as proved by one test conducted by Researcher Avery. [[/footnote]]

**Description:** SCP-5320 most closely resembles a Liparidae [[footnote]] Snailfish [[/footnote]], but without a visible head or tail. Although width and height measure in normal ranges for its species, SCP-5320’s body extends as long as Foundation underwater drones have been able to follow it, concluding that the creature is either extremely long or limitless entirely. Efforts to locate the head or tail of SCP-5320 are ongoing. The creature was discovered during a routine bi-yearly sweep of the ocean floor. The drone responsible for the discovery examined the creature for approximately 50 hours and 38 kilometers before steps to anomalous classification proceeded. Underwater drones have been following the length of SCP-5320’s continuously for three years since, making the estimate for SCP-5320’s length between 37,000 and 39,000 kilometers long and perpetually increasing.

Additional side effects of viewing SCP-5320 include a heightened awareness of the passage of time, increased interest in ceiling tile number, and increased use of the phrase “long boy” in casual conversation, even when referring to things that are neither long nor a boy. Personnel monitoring SCP-5320 have reported feeling an unusual amount of excitement upon seeing one of SCP-5320’s occassionally-visible fins, as well as a compulsion to loudly cheer. 

**Addendum 5320-1:** The People’s Church Of The Fish That Just Goes On Forever has received a new addition to the Shrine in the form of two (2) fish-shaped novelty erasers, gifted to the Church by one Kenny Rosenfield, age 8, progeny of Researcher Margaret Rosenfield.

Dr. Keul,

I've noticed some strange occurrences happening among your staff recently. I'd like to check in with you this week to review the situation. If you can pull your staff's psychological records I would be appreciative. Please let me know your availability when you can.
 
Dr. Emily Mina

Things are a little slow on our end but everything is going smoothly, from my understanding. I have a meeting with Dr. Stephens on Wednesday at noon but I am otherwise free. Thank you for your concern, I hope to have your worries cleared up as soon as possible.

> 
> **Interviewer:** Agent Rachel Summers
> **Interviewee:** Dr. Lupe Keul, Head of Research on SCP-5320
> **Background:** Increasing amounts of unexplained behavior surrounding SCP-5320
> 
> **Keul:** Good morning, Agent Summers, it's my understanding that you have some questions for me?
> 
> **Summers:** Yes, we've received some evidence pertaining to SCP-5320 that we think may constitute an infohazardous effect, we're hoping you can shed some light on the situation.
> 
> **Keul:** Infohazardous? That comes as a surprise to me, I haven't heard anything about that kind of excitement happening in our neck of the... sea.
> 
> **Summers:** Our hope is that we won't find any excitement at all. "Excitement" usually translates to "more work for everybody."
> 
> **Keul:** You'd be surprised how willing I would be to take a little more work sometimes.
> 
> **Summers:** Wouldn't we all... shall we?
> 
> **Keul:** Absolutely.
> 
> **Summers:** Dr. Keul, how long have you been working on this assignment?
> 
> **Keul:** Two, three years?
> 
> **Summers:** Have you noticed any considerable behavioral changes since you began here?
> 
> **Keul** Had a brief stint with depression last year, but our Psych staff has done good work helping all of us work through our issues. 
> 
> **Summers:** So nothing that you have observed in yourself?
> 
> **Keul:** Nothing beyond the expected, no.
> 
> **Summers:** And your staff?
> 
> **Keul:** Nothing out of the ordinary. But... you know. "Idle hands" and all that.
> 
> **Summers:** Uh huh. And how long have you been a part of the- the "People's Church Of The Fish That Just Goes On Forever?"
> 
> **Keul:** How long have we-

[[collapsible show="Unofficial Closing Statement of Investigation SCP-5320 3/16/2018, Agent Rachel Summers" hide="Close"]]

//After following up with Dr. Keul and the rest of the staff assigned to SCP-5320, I have come to the conclusion that the tip concerning SCP-5320 having infohazardous abilities was a false alarm. I will finish due diligence to officially close this investigation upon arrival back at Site-211. The "effects" of SCP-5320's suspected additional ability turned out to be nothing more than a very elaborate running joke among the staff. Dr. Keul has promised to tone it down and keep any further tomfoolery out of the Foundation database.//

//Today marks the fourth consecutive false alarm I have had in the past several months. There was a part of me hoping this one would turn out to be real. But alas, I return to my desk. It appears not even Foundation staff are immune to the human drive to make up dumb superstitions when they're bored.//

//On a semi-related note, Peters better not have moved my wizard figure off his spot again. God knows I don't need 69 MORE years of bad luck.//

//- R. Summers//
