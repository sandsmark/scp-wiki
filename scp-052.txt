**Item #:** SCP-052

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Although it is not possible to remove SCP-052 from the New York City subway system, its predictable behavior allows The Foundation to prevent the public from encountering it.  The 59th St. A/B/C/D Station is to be closed to the public from 11pm-1am on Saturdays/Sundays under the pretext of “track maintenance.”  During that time, the station is to be staffed with agents from Mobile Task Force Gamma-6.  Agents have been ordered to prevent accidental public access to the station, and to capture anyone seen leaving SCP-052.  Anyone who has been on SCP-052 must be transported to Site-21 for debriefing and processing.  Members of the public who see SCP-052 may be released after the administration of a Class B amnesiac.

**Description:** SCP-052 is a type R4 New York City subway train.  Official records indicate this train was built in 1932 and decommissioned for scrap in 1975.  Nevertheless, it continues to appear on the Uptown A/D track at the 59th St. and 8th Avenue station at 11:57 p.m. every Saturday.  The train is in perfect condition and labeled as an “A” train.  SCP-052 appears at the designated time, opens its doors to accept/discharge passengers for approximately five minutes, then closes its doors and disappears.  It does not appear to ever contain passengers, except for those leaving the train during its appearance.

Most of the people entering SCP-052 have never been seen again.  Passengers leaving the train claim to have entered it on various dates, ranging from 1975 to 2204, and remember nothing about the train ride.

**Addendum:** Passengers leaving SCP-052 must be brought to Site-21 and interrogated to determine their origin and possible threat to the current timestream.  Generally, passengers from the past may be given Class A amnesiacs and reintegrated into society.  Passengers from the future must be held indefinitely (see order 69-A1 from O5-9).  Site-21 currently holds 26 passengers from dates ranging from 2011 to 2204; the latter claims he thought SCP-052 was a 300th Anniversary Special train.
