    **Item #:** SCP-757

    **Object Class:** Euclid

    **Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP-757 has been transplanted and will stay at Bio Site-103, guarded closely by selected personnel (12 to 16 subjects) residing in a nearby facility. Personnel will constantly patrol around SCP-757 (following a planned shift agenda), armed with non-lethal weaponry and physical constraint devices (such as handcuffs), to ensure there will be no unauthorized access to the tree. The electrical fence set up in a 4-meter radius around SCP-757 must remain active at all times, save for planned access to SCP-757. Personnel will also ensure that no fruit leaves SCP-757's pen, and in the case of voluntary consumption, for the fruit to be consumed on-the-spot, with no chances of any fruit segment and/or residue to be usable prior to ingestion. The pen is to be cleaned of all rotten fruit twice a month, and the fruit collected during this clean up is to be incinerated on-site.

    **Description:**

SCP-757 is a tree of unknown species (but close to the Prunus Persica species, also known as the peach) discovered at [DATA EXPUNGED] in ████████, which stands at approximately 11 feet tall. It was brought to attention after several reports of people regurgitating fruit started appearing in a local newspaper. It was only after several weeks of research that SCP-757 was discovered in the backyard of an abandoned house, where huge quantities of rotten fruit was found, along with several corpses which died due to lack of nutrition.

SCP-757 itself show very little paranormal effects: the wood has a texture and properties similar to an apple tree, easily broken, damaged or burnt, and the leaves show no special property. The only abnormal behaviour of the item is regeneration of broken branches at an accelerated rate. The fruit (labelled as SCP-757-1), however, is the main reason the SCP requires containment: Every dawn, the tree will grow different species of fruit within an amazingly short timespan (five minutes on average; the size of the fruit directly affects the growth time), which will remain in place for the day, not dropping until dusk, where they will fall to the ground and rot nearly instantly. The fruit, when in SCP-757, causes a rather strong desire to eat one to human beings looking at them. When eaten, it is reported to be "extremely sweet" and "delicious". Even the lemon, which is usually painfully bitter, lost all sour properties, giving a rich lemon flavour to the fruit.

However, consumption of SCP-757-1 is not recommended, as just one bite will cause changes in the victim's body, giving excruciating pain to the subject while a completely new organ forms at the front of the abdomen. This organ causes, over the course of a week, a fruit of the same type eaten to grow inside the victim (causing further pain and sometimes tissue damage for larger fruit), feeding off the nutrients of the subject, and showing visible swelling to the area. After a week, once the fruit is ripe, it is forced up a tube which leads up to the oesophagus, where it is ejected out of the mouth, bending (but never breaking due to the fruit squeezing itself to some diameter in order to pass) the organs and bones in order to pass, and dropping out, perfectly formed, although covered in bodily fluids. Eating the resulting fruit does not yield the effect the fruit of SCP-757 does, and is completely safe to do. As a matter of fact, victims are encouraged to eat the fruit produced, in order to eat back the nutrients lost during it's production.

SCP-757 has been reported, up to now, to produce these fruit: Plums, peaches (which are the most often grown), apples, pears, watermelons, bananas, pineapples, various berries, kiwi fruit, lemons, and in one case, pumpkins.

No cure is known against this as of now, as when the new organ is surgically removed, it is shown to regrow at the same speed it originally appeared. Analysis to determine a physical cause (such as traces of something in the body, alterations of the DNA or entity left inside subject) of the growth of the organ is pending. Awaiting approval on experimentations to know if the juice of the fruit produced by SCP-757 has the same effects as the fruit.



    **Addendum:**

Personnel desiring to eat a fruit from SCP-757 are greatly discouraged to do so, but if they decide to still do so, they can proceed to containment site and claim a fruit. As previously stated, such behaviour is GREATLY discouraged.
