**Item #:** SCP-757

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-757 has been transplanted to a garden plot at Bio Site-103, which is to be patrolled at all times by at least 4 guards armed with non-lethal weaponry and physical constraint devices (such as handcuffs). Access to the tree requires authorization from Level 3 personnel. The electric fence set up at a 4-meter radius around SCP-757 must remain active at all times, save for authorized access to SCP-757. No fruit is to leave SCP-757's containment unit; in case of voluntary consumption, the fruit is to consumed on the spot and all residue incinerated immediately. The pen is to be cleaned of all rotten fruit twice a month; the fruit collected is to be incinerated on-site.

**Description:** SCP-757 is a fruiting tree similar to //Prunus persica// (common peach tree), approximately 11 feet tall. It was discovered at [DATA EXPUNGED] in ████████, after several reports of people regurgitating fruit appeared in a local newspaper. After several weeks of research, SCP-757 was discovered in the backyard of an abandoned house. Huge quantities of rotten fruit were found at its base, along with several malnourished corpses.

SCP-757 itself has few anomalous properties. Its wood's texture and properties are similar to apple wood; it is easily broken, damaged, or burnt. Its leaves are identical to those of ordinary //Prunus persica//. Its only abnormal behaviour is accelerated regeneration of broken branches. The fruit (designated SCP-757-1), however, is the reason for containment. Every dawn, the tree produces edible fruit typical of a different species of plant. Growth takes five minutes on average, although the size of the fruit directly affects the growth time. Fruit remains in place for the duration of the day; at dusk, it falls to the ground and rots nearly instantly. Human beings viewing SCP-757-1, while it remains attached to SCP-757, display a strong desire to eat it. The fruit is universally reported to be "extremely sweet" and "delicious": even the lemon, which was expected to be painfully bitter, tasted instead of a rich lemon-flavored dessert.

Consumption of SCP-757-1 is not recommended, however, as one bite is sufficient to induce the painful formation of a new organ at the front of the subject's abdomen. Over the course of a week, a new fruit of the type consumed forms inside this organ, causing further pain and visible swelling (and in the case of very large fruit, tissue damage). When the fruit is ripe, it is forced up a tube leading to the oesophagus and ejected from the mouth, distorting the subject's tissue in order to pass. It never causes permanent damage in this passage, however, as the fruit itself is distorted to some degree in the course of ejection. The object regurgitated is always an ordinary, perfectly formed (although covered in bodily fluids) specimen of the fruit type initially consumed. It does not possess SCP-757-1's anomalous properties. Subjects are encouraged to consume the new fruit, in order to replenish the nutrients expended to produce it. 

SCP-757 has been observed to produce the following types of fruit, in decreasing order of frequency: peaches, plums, apples, pears, watermelons, bananas, pineapples, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, kumquats, kiwifruit, lemons, and (in one case) pumpkins.

There is presently no cure for SCP-757's effects. If the new organ is surgically removed before fruit regurgitation, it regrows at the same rate as before. Testing to determine a physical, chemical, genetic, or foreign cause of the effects is pending. Testing to determine whether SCP-757-1's juice retains its anomalous effects is pending approval.
