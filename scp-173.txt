**Item #:** SCP-173 

**Object class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** Item SCP-173 is to be kept in a locked container at all times. When personnel must enter SCP-173's container, no fewer than 3 may enter at any time and the door is to be relocked behind them. At all times, two persons must maintain direct eye contact with SCP-173 until all personnel have vacated and relocked the container. 

**Description:** Moved to Site19 1993. Origin is as of yet unknown. It is constructed from concrete and rebar with traces of Krylon brand spray paint. SCP-173 is animate and extremely hostile. The object cannot move while within a direct line of sight. Line of sight must not be broken at any time with SCP-173. Personnel assigned to enter container are instructed to alert one another before blinking. Object is reported to attack by snapping the neck at the base of the skull, or by strangulation. In the event of an attack, personnel are to observe Class 4 hazardous object containment procedures. 

Personnel report sounds of scraping stone originating from within the container when no one is present inside. This is considered normal, and any change in this behaviour should be reported to the acting HMCL supervisor on duty. 

The reddish brown substance on the floor is a combination of feces and blood. Origin of these materials is unknown. The enclosure must be cleaned on a bi-weekly basis.

**Document # 173-1:** December 19, 2008: During cleaning of SCP-173's container, an earthquake scoring 6.2 on the Richter scale, epicenter [DATA EXPUNGED] caused line of site on SCP-173 to be broken. Two cleaners were killed almost instantly. As █████ ███ was seized upon by SCP-173, a disposable camera fell out of his pocket, and struck the corpse of █████ ██████, causing the camera to take a picture. SCP-173 was frozen instantly, hands centimeters away from ███'s neck. Its left hand, however, remained mobile, and attempted to strangle ███, until his gaze returned to SCP-173. With the exception of its hand, SCP-173 was immobile for several weeks, even when not in a direct line of sight. It was at this time that the film in ███ was developed. All of SCP-173 but its left hand was visible in the frame. Once the photograph was developed and viewed, SCP-173 returned to its standard activities. Further research on the phenomenon is pending.
