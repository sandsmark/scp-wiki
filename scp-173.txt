**Item #:** SCP-173

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Item SCP-173 is to be kept in a fenced-off garden at all times. When botanists must enter SCP-173's container, no fewer than 3 may enter at any time and the fence-door is to be relocked behind them. At all times, two persons must maintain direct eye contact with SCP-173 until all personnel have vacated and relocked the garden fence.

**Description:** Moved to Conservatory-19 1993. Origin is as of yet unknown. It is constructed from woody stems and leaves with traces of pink and red roses. SCP-173 is animate and extremely hostile. The object cannot move while within a direct line of sight. Line of sight must not be broken at any time with SCP-173. Botanists assigned to enter garden are instructed to alert one another before blinking. Object is reported to attack by inflicting severe puncture wounds on the neck area via its thorns, or by strangulation. In the event of an attack, botanists are to observe Class 4 hazardous plant containment procedures.

Botanists report sounds of rustling leaves originating from within the garden when no one is present inside. This is considered normal, and any change in this behaviour should be reported to the acting HMCL supervisor on duty.

The reddish brown substance on the ground is a combination of feces, blood, and rose petals. Origin of these materials is unknown. The enclosure must be cleaned on a bi-weekly basis.
