Programme Laascaanood-1 will take place in the outskirts of Laascaanood, a city pertaining to the Sool region, Somalia. This region, currently disputed between Somaliland, Puntland and the Kathumo State, was scouted by the Sool-3 Mission Work Group in 1997, 1999, 2006 and 2007.

+++ [[span style="color:#6BAB30;"]]//Why?//[[/span]]

* Acute food insecurity and high levels of acute malnutrition, particularly in children.

* Inadequate and poor quality basic services.

* Emergent epidemic in the Sool area.

* Human rights violations against civilians.

* Minor displacement related to current conflicts. Predicted raise over 10%-30% in following months.

The humanitarian situation in Puntland, situated in the North-Eastern corner of Somalia, improved recently with the cessation of most combats in the area. However, it recently worsened anew by the arrival of internally displaced people affected by conflict and the sporadic fighting between Puntland and the Somaliland army.

Laascaanood (also called Las Anod or Laas Caanood), capital city of Sool, has become a necessary stop for IDPs trying to escape from the ongoing combats by traversing the region, which is subject to an unresolved boundary dispute with Somaliland. Current local conflict, inter and intra-clan clashes and banditry persist in rural areas of the region, and there have been reports of major military Somaliland operations in the area.

This, combined with other, preexisting humanitarian problems that affect all of Somalian territory, leave vulnerable groups (IDPs, the urban destitute and poor residents) in an even more exposed situation, that will certainly result in further infringements of their human rights.

Finally, a recent outbreak of a new infectious entity, Rupert's disease, that might quickly become epidemic have reached the MCF Mission Watch. This entity, known by local inhabitants as the "Sour" disease or "the Milking Maggot" disease has been deemed a priority by Mission Watch. If infected IDPs are treated or administered preventive measures before they enter Puntland or Somaliland, we will be preventing the spread of a dangerous epidemic and potentially saving thousands of lives.

If you wish to know more about the Sour disease, refer to the Mission Watch Report below these lines.

++ [[span style="color:#6BAB30;"]] //Mission Watch Additional Report - HEALTH CONCERN : "THE SOUR"// [[/span]]

[[span style="color:#6BAB30;"]]**Of Concern:**[[/span]] //**HEALTH CONCERN**, EMERGENT DISEASE, INFECTIOUS DISEASE, POSSIBLY ABNORMAL, Africa, human contagion, REGIONAL, EPIDEMIC, treatable, LETHAL.//

[[span style="color:#6BAB30;"]]**Concern Summary:**[[/span]] //Conclusions of an article about the Rupertine disease. Written by Dr. Sarah Desjeux, Health and Prevention Field Executive member.//

> The Sour is an emergent epidemic first identified in IDP camps in Niger, where UN-OCHA work clusters first encountered it. MCF personnel from the Ruperts-1 Work Group established a local Research-Health Programme with the approval of local authorities and African Union[[footnote]]Through the Specialized Technical Committee of Health[[/footnote]], GOC[[footnote]]Global Occult Coalition; see Known Abnormal Non-Governmental Organizations Report, Tome 3, Section 4.[[/footnote]] and UN-OCHA[[footnote]]United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs[[/footnote]] support. It has been repeatedly called since 'the Rupertine' or 'Rupert's disease" by the local media and scientific bulletins emitted from both GOC and MCF internal editorials, but in truth it should be called by the names the affected communities have given it, as they are much more descriptive.
> 
> The Sour, also called the Milking Maggots disease, is caused by a virus which can be caught from infected humans. It is transmitted mostly through skin contact. It has been theorized that its etiologic agent, a virus possibly pertaining to the //Herpesviridae// family, is capable of surviving in contaminated water by infecting //Giardia lamblia//, a very common free-life protozoan. This makes clean water supply a priority for any Mission dispatched to areas affected by it, and immensely complicates Concern management.

> [[size 90%]]When they woke me up, I was sure I had gotten blind because of that car that hit me, but then they said I had been down with the Sour. I had been playing with my brothers in the brook a couple of days before, and at first I thought we were just fine.[[/size]]
> 
> [[size 90%]]One day, I woke up seeing all those dead people around, like corpses, only covered with white writings, and they chanted 'drink, drink the maggots' milk, so they can feed their ilk' all the time. One of them looked like my mother, I thought she was my mother; my brothers were like them, too, so I run and got run by a car. My legs were bleeding a lot, but it did not hurt, so I run away from them.[[/size]]
> 
> [[size 90%]]I hid for a while, I do not know for how long. I started to bleed white from my legs, and I got thirsty, so I did as the chanting said and I drank it. I also ate the maggots. It tasted bad, like milk gone bad, but at the same time it was good, felt good.[[/size]]
> 
> [[size 90%]]Later, it started to hurt, so I went out and looked for help. The only person I found in the village was a tall stranger, a man from MCF. The man told me to stop running, to calm down, and gave something for my pain, then took me here, to the clinic.[[/size]]
> 
> [[size 90%]]They say I will be fine, but other people in the village are sick now, and I'm afraid my mother and brothers got the Sour too. I do not care if they lose their legs too, I just want to see them.[[/size]]
> -----
> [[size 90%]]//Daouda was one of the many children from a small village near Arlit, Niger, affected by the Third Sour Outbreak. While the village is now defunct, more than thirty percent of its population was safely evacuated and treated by the Geraldine-2 Mission Work Group.//[[/size]]
> [[/div]]
> 
> The Sour doesn't have early onset symptoms. However, after an incubation period of ten to twelve days after infection, all patients will suddenly suffer from acute psychotic disorders which mainly involve psychotic clinical and radically altered behavior. They will be followed by a secondary phase in which self-inflicted injuries and/or severe trauma due to reckless demeanor are frequent. 
> 
> A key symptom present in Sour patients is that most injuries occurred during this period will not heal nor bleed, releasing instead a pus-like white substance of a slightly floral smell and, reportedly, very sour taste. This usually dehydrates the subject, who quickly enters a state of passivity and delirium that may be accompanied by fever. Blood analysis has confirmed the presence of the likely etiologic agent in the bloodstream, but no satisfactory explanation for the apparent transmutation it undergoes when exiting the blood vessels due to traumatic injury larger than a pinprick.
> 
> It is infrequent, but not exceptional, to find small worm-like tumors in the edges of injuries suffered by the subjects; these characteristic growths give the Sour its other name, the Milking Maggot disease. 
> 
> Normally, these symptoms should subside in ten to thirteen weeks of natural development, provided the patient survives the behavioral alteration phase. After this, normal healing processes resumes; however, chronic pain and/or general loss of health are frequent after the illness has run its course, due to major scarification and internal injuries -- it is frequent to find injuries so complicated and/or extensive that normal healing processes cannot handle them. 
> 
> Currently, early diagnosis of this disease is considered difficult even with access to laboratory conditions. Focus on contagion prevention measures and isolation of known patients should be absolute priorities to all Work Groups.
> 
> However, the agent has proven to be sensitive to a combined treatment of generic //Aciclovir// and //Prometerine// -- see attached field manuals for dosage and viable administration routes, necessary material for the inoculation and possible alter-scientific uses --, and may be used as primary prevention, entirely stopping the development of the disease with an estimated 98% efficacy. Finally, if properly addressed and treated, the infection can be stopped in its early stages; actually, when combined with isolation and support measures to counteract the loss of fluids, even patients in deteriorated phases may survive! 
> 
> To sum it up, the Sour has proven to be a highly infectious process, a dangerous threat to human life and an extremely distressing phenomenon to behold, both for relatives of its victims, first responders and NGO workers. The Manna Charitable Foundation possesses the means, the experience and the on-site assets to respond to this health concern in a comprehensive, complete capacity.
> 
> With a new possible outbreak in Sool, we stand on the brink of a potentially catastrophic deterioration in the state of humanitarian concerns of the area and the permanent destabilization of its already suffering societies. I, with the full support of my team, motion that we intervene immediately.
>
