**Item #:** SCP-2748

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The Foundation has purchased SCP-2748 from the Chinese government for long-term containment. SCP-2748 is publicly recognised as a private property of a Foundation front company, and has been isolated from adjacent roads via Foundation-instigated landslides. Outside of approved tests, no land vehicle is to travel on SCP-2748. Prior to placing test materials onto SCP-2748, it is to be cleared of all other live and deceased vertebrate animals.

SCP-2748-A instances are to be kept in Anomalous Vehicle Sector at Site-316. Ignition keys for SCP-2748-A instances are to be stored in a secure locker at Site-316; access is restricted to Level 2 and above personnel. 

SCP-2748-A instances may only be activated as part of approved tests, and by D-class personnel. Prior to activation, a GPS tracking device is to be attached onto the instance. The D-class personnel is to be provided with a helmet, earpiece, protective vest and joint guards. D-class personnel are to keep the door of SCP-2748-A open when activating it, and jump out of the vehicle when the ignition key is turned. To guarantee compliance, personnel may inform the D-class personnel that activation of the ignition key would trigger an explosive device in the vehicle. 

**Description:** SCP-2748 is a section of a road approximately 1 km long, located in Guzhang County, Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Hunan Province, China. SCP-2748-A designates a land vehicle that has struck and terminated a live vertebrate animal while on SCP-2748. The vehicle will then undergo the following transformations into an SCP-2748-A instance: 

* Vehicle frame, doors and most interior equipment (e.g. wheel, brake) are transformed into intermediate filaments, while retaining the original shape of the components replaced. 
* Body coverings (i.e. fur, feather, scale) corresponding to the terminated specimen will grow on SCP-2748-A's vehicle frame. 
* Vehicle audio is limited to a single unknown channel, consisting of moaning sounds.  
* The exterior of car seats is transformed into skin tissues, while the interior is transformed with fat tissues.  
* Manifestation of Traditional Chinese characters in red ink on the bonnet of the vehicle. Characters correspond to excerpts from Daozang (Taoist Canon). 

This transformation sequence takes place for a duration ranging from three to seven days, depending on the physiology of the terminated specimen. During this period, the vehicle's functionality is unaffected. Transformation is usually deemed completed when the Chinese characters manifest on the bonnet. 

When the ignition switch of a fully-transformed SCP-2748-A instance is turned on, said SCP-2748-A instance gains the capacity for autonomous movement and will move on their own accord. At this point, the use of steering wheel and brakes have no effect on SCP-2748-A. Like non-anomalous vehicles, SCP-2748-A is incapable of movement if fuel supplies are depleted or if tyres are removed. 

Notably, instances that were transformed prior to the Foundation's containment of SCP-2748 tend to travel to areas in proximity to SCP-2748. This tendency is not observed with instances transformed due to Foundation-approved tests, which will instead travel further from SCP-2748. Therefore, it is hypothesised that SCP-2748-A will travel to locations that the terminated specimen associates as its birthplace. Below is an abridged list of SCP-2748-A instances.

**Note:** SCP-2748-A instances that were transformed as part of a Foundation-approved test are highlighted red.  

||~ SCP-2748-A instance ||~ Original Vehicle ||~ Terminated Specimen ||~ Description ||~ Notes ||
|| SCP-2748-A1 || Chery QQ3 || //Sciurotamias davidianus// (Père David's rock squirrel) || Covered in grey fur. || Found beside a sandstone pillar in Guzhang County; indentations on the pillar and instance's bonnet are suggestive of a collision between the two. Later investigations reveal that a colony of //S. davidianus// resides in the pillar. ||
|| SCP-2748-A3 || BMW X5 || //Rattus norvegicus// (Brown rat) || Covered in grey fur. Whisker-like growths on the bonnet. [[footnote]] This description was provided by eyewitnesses. It was subsequently verified when the Foundation conducted a test to validate the aforementioned description. [[/footnote]] || Found in ██████ Village, Guzhang County, where it had crashed into a house there. According to survivors, their house was prone to rat infestation. ||
|| ##red|SCP-2748-A8## || Honda Unicorn || //Gallus gallus domesticus// (Chicken) [[footnote]] Acquired from Site-319 Agricultural Sector. Instance was born inside Site-319. [[/footnote]] || Covered in brown feathers. Caruncle-like growths identified above and below the handlebars. || When activated, travelled to Site-319 Agricultural Sector. When arrived at the chicken coop, instance deactivated and remained non-functional since then. Fat tissues on the instance underwent decomposition. ||
|| SCP-2748-A12 || Honda Civic || //Eospalax fontanierii// (Chinese zokor) || Covered in grey fur. || Found in a forested area in Guzhang County, partially buried. Later investigations identify a network of underground tunnels and two deceased instances of //E. fontanierii// near the instance's position. ||  
|| ##red|SCP-2748-A15## || Cadillac Eldorado || D-3858 [[footnote]] D-3858 was selected due to the low population of his birthplace (████████ Village, Hunan Province, China) and his contraction of a terminal illness. He was informed that the Foundation will be conducting euthanasia on him, and he agreed to it under the condition that his corpse be cremated. [[/footnote]] || Roof is covered in black hair. Body takes on a deep peach colouration. Unlike other instances, vehicle audio consists of Chinese funerary music. || Activation occured two metres outside ████████ Village. Upon entering ████████ Village, instance spontaneously disintegrated into a pile of ashes. Initial temperature of the residue is at 1600 ºC. ||

SCP-2748 first came into the Foundation's attention on ██/██/2007 when multiple SCP-2748-A instances were identified. Several SCP-2748-A instances were acquired from their owners, under the pretence of defects found in those vehicles. After a period of investigation, SCP-2748 was identified as a source of the anomaly and the area was secured. 

**Addendum 2748-1:** Prior to its development as a road, SCP-2748 was originally an unmarked burial site allegedly interning early ethnic Miao settlers. Local legends asserted that these settlers were descendants of the Jiu-Li tribe. [[footnote]] A tribe which allegedly existed during the Three Emperors and Five Sovereigns period in China. Its most famous member is the warlord Chiyou, revered by ethnic Miao as a mythical king. [[/footnote]] However, since the graves were unmarked, the claim was widely regarded as dubious by government sources. 

The land was eventually acquired by the China Road and Bridge Corporation on ██/██/2007 for development, after local politicians investigated and determined that no bodies have been interred in the area. After which, SCP-2748 was constructed by the China Road and Bridge Corporation from ██/██/2007 to ██/██/2007.    

**Addendum 2748-2:** The location of SCP-2748 was associated with a separate anomalous event, which may or may not be related with SCP-2748. Said event was intercepted and resolved by the Global Occult Coalition.

The following document was recovered from Global Occult Coalition PHYSICS Division Threat Entity Database by undercover agents.

> __**Threat ID:**__ LTE-1985-Grey Bluechild "Xiangxi Horde"
> 
> __**Authorised Response Level:**__ N/A (Confirmed Destroyed, File Archived)
> 
> __**Description:**__ Approximately 80 subjects, each a reanimated human carcass in rigor mortis. Skeletons are composed of brass, and iron plates and spearheads have been grafted onto their bodies. Multiple talismans with Traditional Chinese characters written on them are pasted onto arbitrary parts of each subject, indicative of reanimation thaumaturgy of a Taoist superstrate. 
> 
> Locomotion limited to forward motion and achieved via jumping, travelling 0.5 metres in distance and 0.2 metres in height per jump. Due to the nature of locomotion, a point of origin has been triangulated to an alleged burial site in Xiangxi Prefecture, Hunan Province, China. At any given time in point, the subjects are equidistant from one another. This is suggestive that the reanimation thaumaturgy occurred simultaneously for all subjects, an oddity for Taoist-orientated reanimation thaumaturgy.
> 
> __**Liquidation:**__ Subjects identified in Xiangxi Prefecture, Hunan Province, China on the night of ██/██/2007 (GMT +8). Assessment Team 738 "Regal Probe" dispatched to confirm threat entities.  
> 
> Due to Second Mission Concerns regarding Type Grey outbreaks, Response Level was elevated to Level 4 (Severe Threat; Immediate Liquidation) and liquidation is spearheaded by Strike Team 8364 "Death Perception". All subjects liquidated via disabling locomotion, followed by incendiary devices. Due to the material composition of LTE-1985-Grey Bluechild, temperature of incendiary blasts was raised up to 1500 ºC to ensure liquidation. 
> 
> __**Appendix 1:**__ Inclusion of "Bluechild" code-phrase. 
> 
> Verified financial transaction between Chinese Communist Party Prefectural Committee office at Jishou, Xiangxi Prefecture and KTE-2732-Blue "Old Chin". [[footnote]] Suspected to be involved in the creation of [[[SCP-2372]]]. [[/footnote]] Nature of transaction is stated to be payment for mass exhumation of carcasses from an unspecified burial site within one night. 
> 
> __**Appendix 2:**__ Due to the unique composition of LTE-1985-Grey Bluechild, it is speculated that they might constitute a separate group of paranormal entities when alive.
