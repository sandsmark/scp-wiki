**About:** |[[*user xFox]] is currently a digital artist and concept designer that likes goats and weird things (both are related). As such, he is a sucker for any SCP article that is goat related (or weird). xFox is ready to learn from feedback and criticism, and will strive to make changes accordingly. Also, he currently lacks knowledge of means to access the chat feature, thus is limited to discussions in the forums.

But in fact, there are four,
And the fourth one is me."
