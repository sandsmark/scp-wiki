**About:** |[[*user xFox]] is currently a digital artist and concept designer that likes goats and weird things (both are related). As such, he is a sucker for any SCP article that is goat related (or weird). xFox is ready to learn from feedback and criticism, and will strive to make changes accordingly. Also, he currently lacks knowledge of means to access the chat feature, thus is limited to discussions in the forums.

[[tab The Fourth One]]
**Item #:** SCP-xXXx

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Known contact numbers for SCP-XXXX are stored on file, and are restricted to Level-4 personnel.

Information pertaining to the contact numbers for SCP-XXXX are to be confiscated whenever located and identified. Phone calls are to be monitored for conversations between individuals and SCP-XXXX-C. Individuals possessing or acquiring this information are to be administered amnestic treatment, or interrogated if required.

Any instance of SCP-XXXX-A or B are to be contained when located and identified. Agents assigned to retrieve these instances are to exercise caution, as SCP-XXXX-A are potentially bio-hazardous or infectious. As such, SCP-XXXX-A are to be kept within humanoid containment cells with the ability to be hermetically sealed. SCP-XXXX-B are to be kept within a BSL-2 storage unit, until the expiration of SCP-XXXX-A. When appropriate or necessary, the retrieval of the body of SCP-XXXX may be facilitated

Orders given by SCP-XXXX-C are to be recorded and submitted to Level-4 personnel. Investigations are ongoing to determine the identity and location of SCP-XXXX-C. Resources have been allocated to the containment of the individual.

**Description:** SCP-XxXx is an anomalous service which offers to facilitate the termination, injury, or illness, of targeted human subjects of a client's choosing. These targeted subjects are henceforth referred to as SCP-XxXx-A. The monetary price of SCP-XXXX varies, depending on the service requested.

SCP-XXXX is accessible through telephone contact, after dialing one of several numbers. Contact numbers are delivered by letter to individuals with hostile or negative intentions. The source of these letters have not been determined, and assumed to be anomalous in nature. If contact is successful, an individual, designated SCP-XXXX-C will converse with the client. The voice of SCP-XXXX-C is electronically concealed, however, a Hungarian accent is discernible. All attempts to identify this individual have been met with failure. Furthermore, attempts to trace the telephone call results in inconsistent and conflicting results.

Through the telephone call, the client is able to discuss the nature of the effects desired for SCP-XXXX-A. If the desired effects requested by the client are feasible, clients will be instructed to obtain one live sheep (//Ovis ariess//), terminate it, then remove a body part to be delivered to the target of their choosing, either directly or indirectly. The body part will henceforth be referred to as SCP-xXxX-B. SCP-XXXX-C will then instruct clients to remove the viscera of the animal, and insert a specified amount of cash into its abdominal cavity. The type of effect manifested in SCP-XXXX-A depends on the body part sent, as well as the specifications provided by the client. The effect of each body part is listed as follows:

* The head results in expiration, or unexplained disappearance.
* The tail results in an illness described by the client.
* Hooves result in one or more injuries.

These effects occur spontaneously, although a time period before manifestation may exist, and are irreversible through conventional methods. If a client attempts to extort SCP-XXxX-A, in order to regain the money lost to SCP-XXXX, he or she will experience the effects intended for SCP-xxxX-A. The original target will subsequently be exempt from any detrimental effects. After SCP-XXXX-A expires or is afflicted by the desired effect, the body of SCP-XXXX-B will vanish, along with the cash placed within. Any other object placed in the body, such as tracking or recording devices, will not vanish along with it.

Upon initial delivery, SCP-XXXX-C will contact SCP-XXXX-A, informing the subject that he or she has committed a transgression, and will be "punished", unless specific orders are followed. Any attempts to dispose of SCP-XxXx-B will be met with failure, with the object reappearing in various locations within the place of residence of SCP-XXXX-A.

The effects of SCP-XXXX can be neutralized if SCP-Xxxx-A successfully follows the orders of SCP-XXXX-C. Recorded orders include termination of individuals, usually family members, through specific methods[[footnote]]Known methods include, but are not limited to, strangulation, mutilation, exsanguination, and cannibalism.[[/footnote]], removal of the subject's non-vital organs, and self-amputation. Alternatively, it has been determined that affixing SCP-xXxX-B to its body will inhibit the development of detrimental effects on SCP-xXXX-A, unless the subject had already expired. As such, clients will often conceal the body to prevent this from occurring.

**Addendum:** The following text is an example of a letter, confiscated by a potential client of SCP-XXXX.

> We know you've been hurt, we know you've suffered injustice, we know how it feels.
> 
> We can make it go away, we can right the wrongs you have faced, we can deliver justice when others cannot.
> 
> All we ask for is a small payment in return.
> 
> We know you are interested.
> 
> Contact [REDACTED] for further instructions.
> 
> -The Fourth One-

The reverse side of all letters from SCP-XXXX contain a message of unknown context, accompanied by images depicting four decapitated goat or sheep heads. The text is listed as follows.

> Oracles are once more.
> Though once only three,
> Now there are four,
> And the fourth one is me.
