**Item #:** SCP-4496

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4496 is to be held in a secure anomalous item locker at [http://www.scp-wiki.net/secure-facility-dossier-site-64 Site-64]. SCP-4496 should be stored in its "robot" configuration to avoid accidentally triggering its anomalous properties. Foundation web crawlers are to monitor internet traffic for activity under the username "MxMaster".

**Description:** SCP-4496 is a //Beast Wars: Super Lifeform Transformers// action figure representing the character ランディー ("Randy"), produced exclusively for Japanese markets. The toy, as with its non-anomalous counterparts, is built around a primary gimmick of converting from a representation of an organic wild boar (//Sus scrofa//) to a bipedal "robot" with the use of a spring-loaded trigger. SCP-4496 is anomalously durable compared to other "Randy" action figures, lacking the excess fragility that typically characterizes the toys.[[footnote]]Commonly referred to by toy collectors as "Gold Plastic Syndrome".[[/footnote]]

SCP-4496's active anomalous effects manifest when its spring-loaded transformation is triggered. On conversion to its robot form, intermolecular forces within approximately 4.550 meters of SCP-4496 will be instantaneously and significantly weakened, rendering solid matter significantly more brittle and liable to crumble or tear under pressure. This effect is a permanent, one-time alteration of the surrounding molecules rather than an ongoing effect; other matter surrounding SCP-4496 after its conversion into "robot" will not be affected, and transforming it back to "boar" form will have no impact on matter it has previously affected.

Gases and liquids are also affected; while liquids will be subject to a reduction in surface tension, there is little practical effect on gases due to their already-weak intermolecular force. However, testing has shown SCP objects of anomalous durability or fragility to be unaffected by the effect.

**Discovery:** SCP-4496 was initially discovered by Agent Para of MTF Rho-40 ("Toys 'R' Us Kids") during routine surveillance of the dealer room at the 2004 Official Transformers Collectors' Convention in Rosemont, Illinois, after its activation during purchase from a dealer table caused the collapse of two tables and severe injury to the buyer.

Subsequent interrogation of the seller, Mr. █████ ████████, revealed that he was aware of SCP-4496's anomalous properties, having broken his right arm and leg as well as several other rare items in his Transformers toy collection after triggering it; he had been attempting to sell the toy purely out of desire to not be around it any more. The Foundation took SCP-4496 into custody, and administered amnestics and medical treatment to both Mr. ████████ and the purchaser, Mr. ██████ ██████, under the pretext of both men having undiagnosed osteoporosis. Convention organisers 3H Productions disseminated a Foundation cover story about a damaged table that collapsed and injured Mr. ██████.

On my way to completing my BWN collection - just picked up the Randy and Crazybolt 2pack - but i'm worried about "Gold Plastic Syndrome". How to best make sure Randy doesn't shatter whenever i pick him up? Don't want to have to hunt down a new one.

What the hell did you do? He's not crumbling sure but when  I transformed him its like everything around me shattered instead. My toy shelves collapsed and i've broken my leg AND my arm. Did you use some fucked up chemicals or something??
