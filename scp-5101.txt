**Item #:** SCP-5101

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All records detailing SCP-5101, including this document, are to be contained within three conceptual barriers hereafter referred to as Threshold Maya, Threshold Puimre and Threshold Yuf.

Threshold Maya is a circular formation five meters in diameter, which surrounds Threshold Puimre, Threshold Yuf and all SCP-5101 documentation. Threshold Maya is to be composed from a mixture of industrial-grade chalk and fresh grain. These materials are to be replenished twice a week. No personnel are to visually observe Threshold Maya while it is being replenished under any circumstances.

Threshold Puimre is a circular formation three meters in diameter, which surrounds Threshold Yuf and all SCP-5101 documentation. Threshold Puimre is to be composed from a mixture of pigeon blood and cement. These materials are to be replenished six times a month[[footnote]] The timing of these replenishments are not relevant, and can be performed in rapid succession at the start of every month. [[/footnote]]. During replenishment, personnel are to ignore any demands posed by Threshold Puimre.

Threshold Yuf is a circular formation one meter in diameter, which surrounds and contains all SCP-5101 documentation. Threshold Yuf is to be composed from a mixture of human spinal fluid and industrial-grade chalk. These materials are not to be replenished under any circumstances [[footnote]]Once Threshold Yuf has faded to such a degree that it cannot be visually recognized, personnel are to take care to ensure they keep track of its location. [[/footnote]]. Once a month, a humanoid entity will appear on the border of Threshold Yuf and inform personnel of any adjustments that must be made to these containment procedures. These instructions are to be followed without question, and the entity is then to be executed using a gunshot to the head.

Outside of the maintenance specified in these containment procedures, personnel are to make no physical contact with Threshold Maya, Threshold Puimre or Threshold Yuf.

**Description:** SCP-5101 is a set of anomalous containment procedures which, when properly enacted:

* Prevent any entity within its boundaries from interfering with the outside world.
* Prevent any sentient entities in the outside world from interfering with that which is contained.

Due to the lack of information on how SCP-5101 operates and the suspicious nature of its creation, it has been denied re-designation as Thaumiel and is instead currently being used to contain itself[[footnote]] See 'Special Containment Procedures'. [[/footnote]].

**Addendum 5101-1 (Circumstances of Creation)**
[[/=]]

SCP-5101 was created by Julius Green, a RAISA Containment Specialist[[footnote]] For full service record, including the successful reclassification of twenty-two anomalies from Keter to Safe, see Site-22 Personnel Archive. [[/footnote]], under orders from the Overseer Council to develop procedures capable of containing a highly dangerous object or entity. Due to security concerns, the Foundation is not at liberty to further discuss this anomaly.

However, the Overseer Council has declassified the following message exchange for use in tracking the development of SCP-5101.

> Note that this anomaly is classified 'Pitch Black' in terms of information control. As a result, the following measures will be taken upon your completion of this task:

> 
> * You will undergo amnestic therapy to remove all memories of your work with the anomaly.
> * You will be subject to additional cognito-agents designed to prevent you from reasoning what you have been doing during your missing portion of memory.
> * You are expressly forbidden from discussing your work with any colleagues. If this directive is not followed, severe consequences will ensue including possible termination of language privileges.
> * The anomaly you are working on will not be listed in any Foundation database, and you will not receive credit for your work.

> With all due respect, the information you've given me here is extremely limited, and I honestly can't see how I'm expected to draft up containment procedures when I don't have a full idea of //what// I'm containing. Quite frankly, the details you've given me access to aren't even enough to give it an Object Class.

I've started to consider the problem from a more general perspective - containment as a //whole// rather than containment for //one// specific thing, if that makes sense - but it takes a lot of focus, and quite frankly your constant reminders about the deadline isn't helping.

On 28/01/2020, the corpse of Julius Green was found in his office at Site-22. Autopsy determined the cause of death to be spontaneous combustion of his brain matter. A copy of SCP-5101 had been sent to Attendant JL, and a second copy was present in written form on his desk.

As Attendant JL had not yet been made aware of the situation and thus had no way of knowing of Mr. Green's death, an additional message was sent following the creation of SCP-5101:

> **From:** Attendant JL
