**Item #:** SCP-259

**Object Class:** Keter 

**Special Containment Procedures:** A single copy of a computer program capable of producing SCP-259 is to be kept on compact disc in the High Security Containment Vault at Site-25.  As discs containing SCP-259 are typically destroyed during experimentation, additional copies may be made for approved experiments.

Mobile Task Force Gamma-10 remains on standby to collect and neutralize any copies of SCP-259 found outside the Foundation.  Unauthorized media containing SCP-259 or the means to produce it are to be destroyed immediately.

**Description:** SCP-259 is a fractal image known as "The Weisenglass Spiral".  A completed rendering of SCP-259 acts as an Einstein-Rosen Bridge, opening a portal to an unknown location.  The locations accessed appear to vary depending on the size and orientation of the rendered image, and have included:

-- An area filled with superheated plasma (estimated temperature 20,000,000 degrees Kelvin). See Incident K-259-1.
-- An area populated with carnivorous spiders (species unknown; weight approximately 10kg).  See Incident K-259-2.
-- Deep space. See Experiment X-259-2.
-- An area possibly corresponding to the dimension opened by SCP-███.  See Experiment X-259-3.

Foundation mathematicians are working on determining why this specific fractal has anomalous properties, and whether other similarly anomalous images exist.  By O5 order, any image rendering related to SCP-259 experimentation must take place at least ████m from inhabited areas.

After Incident K-259-1, 41 copies of a CD capable of generating SCP-259 were confiscated from ██████.com, and a public warning issued that the CD, labeled “100 Fun Fractals You Can Print” contains a malicious virus that will destroy the user’s computer.  ██████.com claimed to have obtained the disks from a reseller's bankruptcy sale, and the Foundation was not able to trace the original producer.   Whether SCP-259 was released accidentally, or distributed with knowledge of its anomalous properties, is under investigation.

Incident K-259-2 makes it clear that SCP-259 is being used with malicious intent.   The Foundation is working with global anti-terrorism forces to retrieve SCP-259 from the organization responsible for this incident.

**Addendum:** 

**Incident K-259-1 –** A residence hall at ███████ University was destroyed by explosion/fire on █/█/20██.  Authorities were mystified that conditions at the center of the incident resembled the detonation of a small fusion-based device.  Graduate student █████ ███████ was completely vaporized, as were ██ others, including several who left shadows imprinted on the nearest standing walls.  Questioning of survivors indicated that ███████ had gone to his room with a CD he had recently ordered from ██████.com, “to play with some fractals.” leading to the eventual discovery of a program capable of rendering SCP-259 for sale on the site.

**Incident K-259-2 –** █/██/201█ Image of SCP-259, approximately 10m x 10m in size, appears on Diamond Vision screen during soccer game at ███████ Stadium, outside ██████████, ███████.  Approximately 60,000 people in attendance.  Survivors report a large circular anomaly appeared in front of the image, and spiders "poured out" from it, attacking anyone they could reach.   Approximately █████ casualties.  Spiders contained/terminated over the course of █ weeks by combined MTF effort.  Although the spiders averaged 10kg in weight, and correspond to no known terrestrial species, SCP classification denied.  Possible relation to SCP-8██ is being investigated.  ███████ ████ organization later claimed responsibility for the image.  Mass application of amnesiacs necessary to partially suppress public knowledge of this event.

**Experiment X-259-1 --** A battery-powered computer was set up in an uninhabited area of the ██████ Desert to render an image of The Weisenglass Spiral, with remote cameras and sensors set up to monitor the results. Foundation personnel observed at a safe distance.  Upon completion of the image, a circular area appeared in front of the computer, approximately 1m in diameter, emitting a blinding white light followed by a ball of superheated plasma.  Despite the immediate destruction of the computer, the portal remained for approximately 20 seconds.  The plasma dissipated after expanding to an area of ███ meters.  Given the interference provided by the building in Incident K-259-1, this is consistent with the damage observed.

//Dr. ███████ considers it interesting that SCP-259 took effect without direct human observation.//

**Experiment X-259-2 --** Experiment X-259-1 re-created, except the size of the rendered fractal was doubled.  Upon completion of image, a black portal approximately 3m in diameter appeared, and all matter within ███m was pulled into it.  This is consistent with an otherwise unexplained incident in ███████, ████ where an apartment building was described by observers as imploding and disappearing, leaving a ███m deep hole.

**Experiment X-259-3 –** Generation of an inverted version of SCP-259.  [DATA EXPUNGED] and area quarantined pending containment of multiple examples of SCP-███.
