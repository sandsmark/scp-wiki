**Special Containment Procedures:** Samples of SCP-5880 are currently kept suspended in a liquid nitrogen canister in the Anomalous Biohazard Storage wing of Site-49. Access to the item or information regarding the item is prohibited unless approved by the item's acting HMCL Supervisor, currently Senior Researcher Lukas Johansson.

Known instances of SCP-5880-1 are to be sedated for approximately 3 weeks. Recovered instances are to be quarantined until 24 hours after the cessation of symptoms, at which point they are to be subjected to amnestic therapy sufficient to eradicate all memories of the symptomatic period. 

Paravirology Division Unit 2 has been assigned to the investigation of SCP-5880 and other non-anomalous strains of influenza and develop vaccinations as necessary.

**Description:** SCP-5880 is an anomalous, highly contagious strain of Influenza B contracted through either physical or memetic infection. Initial infection of SCP-5880 progresses similarly to other, non-anomalous infections. Common symptoms include coughing, congestion, upper respiratory irritation, head/body ache, fever, and fatigue. Due to the anomalous effects of SCP-5880, infected individuals are significantly less likely to receive medical assistance, and thus more likely to suffer complications. The current fatality rate is approximately 32%.

SCP-5880-1 designates any symptomatic carriers of SCP-5880. Anomalous properties manifest with the onset of compulsory symptoms, approximately 48 hours after initial infection. Following this, individuals will begin to religiously worship the influenza virus, as well as related infections and symptoms. The specific actions varies between individuals, but in all instances, individuals will attempt to actively transmit SCP-5880 and proliferate instances of SCP-5880-1. Sedation during the symptomatic period of SCP-5880 infection has thus far been effective in preventing this effect.

**Addendum 5880-1:** Discovery

On 11/12/2019, Senior Researcher Lukas Johansson submitted a behavioral report regarding his assigned team of Foundation personnel investigating the global outbreak of Influenza B for potentially anomalous influences. The following records includes the report and subsequent documentation.

As the most senior researcher assigned to my team (after accounting for the condition of liable administrative personnel), I am submitting a report regarding the situation in Site-██. In short, personnel have taken a religious stance regarding our current investigation into the global Influenza B outbreak, and are actively //worshiping the flu//, including compromising the sanitation of the facilities by actively spreading infections.

Our whole site is in total disarray, and I am not completely sure how to describe the situation. I am requesting a formal retrieval and disinfection program, considering the severity of the situation.

Attached are several documents to corroborate my claims.

The current state of affairs is absolutely intolerable. Those infected are spreading the infection to others, the sanitation of the medical wing is simply nonexistent, and I am likely the last remaining medical doctor who is still sane. For goodness' sake, twenty or some medical personnel were chanting "Long live the Most High!" after poor Dr. Rizvi //died// of influenza. We've dealt with hundreds of superviruses and anomalous diseases, and what finally got him was //the flu.//

All of you in administration won't hold out for long. //I// already got infected, what with all the coughing that's going on, and I am //in charge of sanitation.//

**β-7B Lead Taylor:** Recorder's on. Everyone, check your mics.

**β-7B-1 Gwan:** Check.

**β-7B-2 Moore:** Check. 

**β-7B-3 Nelson:** Triple-check.

**β-7B Lead Taylor:** Command, can you hear me?

**Command:** Roger, Team Lead.

**β-7B Lead Taylor:** Alright. Remember, we're using //tranqs//, so don't get any funny ideas. Everyone should be with the Foundation.(//Pauses//) Everyone checked their suits, right?

**β-7B-1 Gwan:** Affirmative.

**β-7B-3 Nelson:** Affirmative.

**β-7B-2 Moore:** Hang on. (//Pauses//)Yeah, I'm set.

**β-7B Lead Taylor:** Alright. Think we're good to go, Command.

**Command:** Opening the door...now.

(//Command remotely opens the secure access entry to Site-██, and the team enters.//)

**β-7B-3 Nelson:** Well, good thing the power's still on. I definitely have a preference for being able to see a meter ahead of me.

**β-7B-1 Gwan:** Everything's better than the cave last time, Nelson.

**β-7B-3 Nelson:** You know, Gwan, I don't disagree.

**β-7B Lead Taylor:** Right. So, apparently, the thing we're dealing with isn't just viral, but also has some sort of compulsory component, so...be prepared for weird.

**β-7B-2 Moore:** Weird is always better than deadly.

(//Coughing is audible in the background.//)

**β-7B-3 Nelson:** Oh boy. Here we go.

(//Team turns the corner and approaches a group of around 20 infected Foundation personnel gathered in a circle and coughing profusely.//)

**Infected Personnel:** Praise be unto the Most High (//Coughs//)! May its Divine and Pleomorphic Virions return us all to its gracious hold!

**β-7B-1 Gwan:** What the fuck.

(//Infected personnel turns to face the approaching team.//)

**Infected Personnel:** The heretics have come for us!

(//Gathered infected personnel begin shouting and coughing intentionally, while running towards the team carrying knives.//)

**β-7B-3 Nelson:** Hey Moore, how 'bout weird //and// deadly?

(//Team begins retreating, occasionally stopping to fire tranquilizers at the mob.//)

**Infected Personnel:** Destroy the infidels' cladding, and bring the Most High (//Coughs//) unto-

(//Infected personnel is cut off when he is tranquilized by β-7B Lead Taylor.//)

**Command** Alright, head for the lockdown chambers, at the end of the hallway, on the left.

**β-7B Lead Taylor:** Roger that.

(//Several infected personnel reach for the team and slash at their suits, barely missing.//)

**β-7B-3 Nelson:** Who the //fuck// designed these and //didn't// make them puncture-proof?

(//Team reaches the end of the hallway and turns into the lockdown rooms. Command remotely activates the door as several infected personnel stumble into the room, who are quickly tranquilized by the team.//)

**β-7B-2 Moore:** (//Panting//) Well, what now, Taylor?

**β-7B Lead Taylor:** (//Pauses to catch breath//) Command?

**Command:** Exit from the side door and head towards the bathrooms. Then, wait for an individual to enter, and retrieve them.

**β-7B Lead Taylor:** Copy that.

**β-7B-3 Nelson:** Um, one question.

**β-7B Lead Taylor:** What's that?

**β-7B-3 Nelson:** Male or female? 'Cause Moore and I are male, so-

**β-7B-1 Gwan:** (//Sighs//) Just...shut up, Nelson.

**β-7B-3 Nelson:** It's a legitimate question! I'd like to know the logistics-

**β-7B Lead Taylor:** Moore and you can go into the male bathroom. Gwan and I will go into the female bathroom. 

**β-7B-3 Nelson:** And what if the infected take us on while we're split up?

**β-7B Lead Taylor:**  (//Pointing to security camera.//) Command can keep an eye on them.

**β-7B-3 Nelson:** A-alright.

**Command:** Opening doors...now.

(//Command remotely opens the lockdown chamber side door. Team rapidly exits, and covertly proceeds towards the bathrooms. Team then splits up, with β-7B Lead Taylor and β-7B-1 Gwan entering the female bathroom and β-7B-2 Moore and β-7B-3 Nelson entering the male bathroom.//)

**β-7B-2 Moore:** And now we wait.

(//Several minutes pass before an individual enters the male restroom. β-7B-2 Moore and β-7B-3 Nelson quickly apprehend him.//)

**Individual:** Wait. Wait, are you guys the Haz Matters?

**β-7B-2 Moore:** Maz Hatters. And wouldn't you like to know. (//To Command//) We got one.

**Individual:** Ah, here's the thing. I'm not...um...infected. Name's Lukas Johansson, Senior Researcher. I'm...ah, the guy who sent the report.

**Command:** Affirmative, individual identifies as Senior Lukas Johansson. Moore, Nelson, you can let him go.

**β-7B-3 Nelson:** (//Muttering//) Just our luck. Give us a whole site of literal sickos and the one guy we fetch is clean.

**Johansson:** Well, on the bright side, I'm not trying to get you guys infected.

(//Johansson steps to the side.//)

**Johansson:** Plus, I can get you guys samples, if you follow me.

**β-7B-2 Moore:** (//Nods//) Right then. (//To β-7B Lead Taylor over intercom//) Taylor, we got someone useful. Still seems sane. Says he can get us samples.

**β-7B Lead Taylor:** Roger that. (//To β-7B-1 Gwan//) Let's go.

(//Team regroups.//)

**β-7B-2 Moore:** This is Dr. Lukas Johansson. The guy who tipped the site off.

**β-7B Lead Taylor:** (//Nods towards Johansson//) Right. Nice to meet you. I'm Marissa Taylor, lead member of MTF-Beta-Seven, "Maz Hatters", Squad B.

(//Johansson extends a hand towards Taylor.//)

**β-7B Lead Taylor:** Save it for later. Let's get the samples and get out of here first.

**Johansson:** (//Retracting hand//) Right then. Follow me.

(//Johansson leads the team down the hallway.//)

**β-7B-1 Gwan:** So, doc, what exactly happened here?

**Johansson:** I'm still not completely sure. I know there's some sort of...compulsory aspect to it,  I think - it's outside of my field of expertise. Matter of fact, I'm probably the only one in my whole team that hasn't had to deal with memetic stuff, since I got transferred from Unit 4 after Unit 2 dealt with [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2559 SCP-2559], and half the team died. The past few weeks, our unit has only been studying influenza...hardly anything especially dangerous, or anomalous.

**β-7B-3 Nelson:** You mean to tell me that all those researchers-turned-crazed-cultists just have the //flu?//

**Johansson:** Again, I'm not completely sure. There's been some sort of mutation, is all I know. I've been working by myself the past few days. (//Pauses.//) Alright, we're here.

(//Johansson removes his keycard and opens the door. The team enters what appears to be an office, filled with misplaced laboratory equipment.//)

**Johansson:** This is my office, where I've been hiding out. I moved a bunch of lab equipment here to work on research. Feel free to help yourselves to some Coke.

(//Johansson turns back towards the team.//)

**Johansson:** Right. Suits. Can't drink. My bad.

**β-7B Lead Taylor:** We just need the samples, and any relevant documentation or information you have.

**β-7B-3 Nelson:** I'll take a can, if you don't mind-

**β-7B Lead Taylor:** I mind, Nelson. 

**β-7B-3 Nelson:** We only have Pepsi back at-

**Johansson:** (//Chuckles//) It's alright, I can carry some. (//Pointing//) The samples are in those Petri dishes.

(//β-7B Lead Taylor places the Petri dishes into her pack.//)

**β-7B Lead Taylor:** Alright. Let's move out.

**Johansson:** Not so fast. The Church has a prayer session in a few minutes, and it'll be much easier to sneak out then.

**Command:** Several hostiles are en route to your current location.

**β-7B Lead Taylor:** Never mind that. We need to go, now.

**Johansson:** What? Oh. Oh, right. The security cameras! They must be watching us-

(//Johansson is cut off by the sound of distant coughing.//)

**Johansson:** Shit! We need to go, //now!//

(//Johansson opens the door and ushers the team out, and then follows them as they run towards the exit.//)

**β-7B-2 Moore:** The closest exit should be the administrative exit.

**Johansson:** (//Shaking his head//) No can do. Admin sealed themselves in when they learned about the outbreak. The idiots locked themselves in, and the air vents got them all infected.

**β-7B Lead Taylor:** Then which exit?

**Johansson:** The service exit.

**β-7B Lead Taylor:** Got it.

(//The sound of coughing becomes louder, and team sees a crowd of around 30 Foundation personnel in close proximity.//)

**β-7B-3 Nelson:** Here we go again.

(//Infected personnel notice the team, and begin shouting and coughing loudly, before chasing the team.//)

**Infected Personnel:** Is that Johansson?

**Johansson:** Is that you, Keane?

**Keane:** Why do you resist the Most High (//Coughs//)?

(//β-7B Lead Taylor and β-7B-3 Nelson turn to fire at the mob while β-7B-2 Moore continues escorting Johansson towards the exit.//)

(//A number of infected personnel manage to catch up to Johansson, coughing profusely.//)

**Infected Personnel:** I've got you now, vile infidel!

(//Johansson throws the cans of Coca-Cola at the infected personnel, causing them to exclaim in pain and lose their grip on Johansson.//)

**β-7B Lead Taylor:** Alright, let's get out of here!

(//β-7B Lead Taylor and β-7B-3 Nelson turn and sprint to catch up with the team. Command remotely opens the service exit, and the team runs out of the site. Support unit stationed nearby tranquilizes the few personnel that manage to exit before the door closes.//)

**Johansson:** (//Panting//) We...we did it.

(//Johansson turns to face β-7B-3 Nelson.//)

**Johansson:** Sorry about the Coke, man.

[BEGIN LOG]

**Nguyen:** Please state your name for the transcript.

**Johansson:** Lukas Johansson, Senior Researcher. Paravirology. Co-lead of Unit 2.

**Nguyen:** Thank you, Dr. Johansson. Now, I'm sure you know what I'm about to ask you about.

**Johansson:** What's going on? Or why I'm not affected?

**Nguyen:** Both. Let's start with the former.

**Johansson:** As I'm sure you know, every year, one research team from the paravirology division is assigned to investigate influenza, since its pervasiveness makes it extremely susceptible to anomalous influences, or at the very least, compromises immune systems, allowing anomalous infections to occur. 

(//Johansson leans forward and places his palms together.//)

**Johansson:** This year, it wasn't a secondary infection, but the flu //itself.//

**Nguyen:** How so?

**Johansson:** I'm not completely sure //how//, but I //do// know is that it has something to do with influenza's genetic instability. You know how every year, the civilian population is administered a different vaccine?

**Nguyen:** Of course.

**Johansson:** Influenza develops mutations quite rapidly. This appears to be some...extreme mutation, allowing for optimal proliferation. Strain B infects basically only humans, or at least what resembles human organic material. And I think that somehow, this strain has adapted to human //intelligence.//

**Nguyen:** But the Foundation has dealt with superviruses before. They simply become immune to vaccines, or develop a counter-

**Johansson:** No, no, not like that. The vaccine for influenza has been available for, what, 80 years? Life //always// finds a way. Think about it. Why keep trying to fighting, if you can just convince them to //give up?//

**Nguyen:** Or better yet...to worship you.

**Johansson:** Exactly. And if it's already done it once, it'll probably be able to do it again.

(//Silence.//)

**Johansson:** Now that we've got the //bad// news out of the way, let me tell you the //good// news.

**Nguyen:** What's the good news?

**Johansson:** Well. As usual, when a contagious disease affects a population, individuals begin developing immunity.

(//Johansson leans back into his chair and crosses his arm.//)

**Nguyen:** You're saying you're immune.

(//Johansson returns to a normal sitting position.//)

**Johansson:** I've displayed absolutely //no// symptoms. No coughing, fever...no compulsive effects, either.

(//Nguyen furrows his brow.//)

**Nguyen:** So you're saying that...we can neutralize the flu?

**Johansson:** Not quite. Even the Foundation hasn't been able to completely neutralize the flu. Believe me; I was part of the 2009 flu team, and we all know how the //that// went. New strains pop up all the time. 

**Nguyen:** So what //are// you suggesting?

**Johansson:** We figure out what makes it work. Every non-anomalous disease, we can see //why// certain symptoms occur. Now we have a sample of the disease, and an individual that is immune. 

(//Johansson point to the door.//)

**Johansson:** Out there, there's dozens of people who we know are //not// immune. And if that's not enough, we have a few dozen more D-Class. We can compare our genetics, figure out how the hell it's getting into peoples' minds.

**Nguyen:** I see.

**Johasson:** First thing I'm doing when this is done, I'm submitting a request to the paravirology division administration. See if the Foundation can't vaccinate the damn flu.

**Nguyen:** Please state your name for the transcript.

**Sherman:** Field Agent Tori Sherman, Paravirology Division, Unit 2.

**Nguyen:** Alright. Now, Ms. Sherman, how's your memory?

**Sherman:** A bit...blurred. It's kind of like getting amnesticized...after, I mean. Obviously I don't remember //getting// amnesticized.

**Nguyen:** I see. So, you recall the events that occurred in November?

**Sherman:** Unfortunately, yes.

**Nguyen:** Right. What's your first memory of the incident?

**Sherman:** Well, I don't remember when I got infected. I think I started doing the "Church of Influenza" stuff around...let's see...Wednesday. In October.

**Nguyen:** So this began in October?

**Sherman:** I think...yeah. That's right. Must have started coughing and stuff around the same time. Hart - the doc in charge of sanitation - got on me about that. Pretty soon, I was coughing intentionally, but since I'm a field agent, I only met with a few people before the whole thing blew up. I think...hang on...

(//Sherman furrows her brow and appears to be deep in concentration.//)

**Sherman:** I think it was Bates or Watson next. Bates wrote up some flu bible, and Watson called in a sick day around that time. Since Watson was out, Johansson took full administration, and, well, after that, you know what happened.

**Nguyen:** What do you know about Johansson?

**Sherman:** I've never known much about the guy. He transferred over from some other unit a while back, and the records say our whole unit got amnesticized to save us from SCP-2559 - course, I wouldn't remember the specifics - so he isn't so close to the rest of the team.

**Nguyen:** Do you have any idea why he's immune?

(//Sherman shrugs.//)

**Sherman:** No clue. I know we definitely coughed on him, and at any rate, we got to the guys in administration after we sabotaged the air vents, so I have no idea how he's fine.

(//Nguyen closes his notes.//)

**Nguyen:** Alright, that's it for today. Thank you for your time, Ms. Sherman.

Cameron,

You said you figured something out?

Lukas,

The team's been trying to see what's different about your genome for ages. But I had a talk with Tori Sherman the other day, and she reminded me of something.

Paravirology Division Unit 2 was assigned to SCP-2559 a few years ago. In the end, every single member of the team was amnesticized. Half the team was replaced. And of the replacements, only one was still working in Unit 2 when Incident 5880-1 occured.

You.

Cameron,

The influenza vaccine has existed for 80 years. Modern amnestics? About 40. It's time these common, everyday contagions started responding to all the parabiological tampering the Foundation has done to its hundreds of thousands of personnel, let alone millions of amnesticized civilians.

Last week, I ran the tests with an unamnesticized D-Class. You were right.

What the fuck has the Foundation created.
