**Item #:**  SCP-Jim

**Object Class:**  Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**  As SCP-Jim is primarily self-containing, it is to simply be provided with a standard humanoid containment cell, a computer with an internet connection, and a weekly stipend of $50 USD to buy video games in order to promote continued cooperation.

**Description:**  Hello there!  My name is Roland Lowery, also known throughout the interwebs as [[*user Jim North]].  My likes are video games, reading, writing, and collecting old computer parts.  My dislikes are talking about myself, so we're gonna keep this kinda short.

I've been writing (non-professionally) off and on for the past twenty years or so, and I thought I'd take a stab at this whole SCP Foundation thing.  See Addendum Jim-001 for a full list of my contributions to the site.

[[tab Head Cannons]]
Wanna know just what it was I was babbling on about in one of my skips or tales?  Wanna know a little of the behind-the-scenes stuff that went into their creation?  Well this here is the place.  Be warned, tho', that here thar be spoilers, matey.  Sort of.  The tab is labeled "Head Cannons" not just because cannons are awesome, but because I often think that other people's interpretations of my work can be just as legitimate as what I was thinking of when I was writing it, and I'm always fascinated by some of the explanations other folks have come up with.  Anyway, on with the show!

[[collapsible show="+ General Fun Stuff" hide="- General Fun Stuff" hideLocation="both"]]
* I don't use standard blackboxing.  The stuff is actually blackboxed in-universe, but there is a very simple way for wiki-readers to see what's under the marker if they want.

[[[SCP-3147 | Who decides that "Shoe Shine" is an acceptable candy flavor?]]]

My first SCP article on the site, though not the first one I wrote.  The first one I wrote was called "Freakuency", and after I put it up in the Drafts forum and did a massive rewrite on it, I realized that while it was a good idea, the form I was wanting to write it in wasn't appropriate for here.  I could have altered it into something that was, but then it wouldn't have been the idea I wanted to write anymore, so I ditched it and kind of strayed away from trying to write a skip for a long while.

When I came back, I sorted through a bunch of other ideas I had and settled on one for a device that swapped people's voices.  At first it was going to be some kind of wand that one would touch to their throat and it would just do your basic voice switcheroo, but I decided to go with something that actually went in the user's mouth (hence a lollipop) and thought it would be more interesting if you could actually control the speech of the person you swapped with.  Certainly when I pictured the process in my head, I specifically thought, "Wow, that seems like it would be a hell of a lot of fun."

The moment I got all of that figured out, the idea to make it a Wondertainment product immediately sprang to mind.  The nebulous idea that it wouldn't be the product itself to directly harm the user also formed at this point, though I wasn't sure until later just how that would work out.  I just knew that the whole "Dr. Wondertainment and/or the company doesn't do proper QA" thing had been done a whole lot and I wanted to go another way.

So, spoiler territory now.  Who, exactly, is PoI3147-01?  Well I'll tell ya . . . I don't know.  I purposefully wanted to keep it wide open to several interpretations.  It could be Dr. Wondertainment himself, of course, doing unspeakable things to test out his products, and I think that's the conclusion a few folks immediately jumped to.  Perhaps it's somebody who works for Dr. W, doing this terrible things with or without the toyman's knowledge and consent.  That was what things were leaning more toward in the original draft, I should mention.  Or maybe this is just some random sicko who likes to kidnap and torture kids, and using Wondertainment products to do that just happens to be his particular MO.

The last one is the one that . . . well, "appeals to me" is perhaps the wrong way to put it because, y'know, gross.  But it is the one that I personally think is the case.

**Final Trivia:**  Keep an eye out for Site-272.  It may be important later on.

[[[SCP-3369 | Everyone deserves their fifteen minutes of fame.]]]

After finishing up my first actual skip, I had some trouble figuring out what my second one was going to be.  Not because of a dearth of ideas, mind you, but because of having way too many.  I couldn't decide which to do and I was still in the process of chugging out more.  Then along came [[user Aleph-Null]] and the living joke.

While the execution was not absolutely awful, Aleph's first two attempts at the article also weren't up to the standards of the wiki, so they were downvoted and deleted.  The idea, however, was very sound, and it had captured my brain, pushing all those other ideas I was struggling over to the wayside.  I approached Aleph, asked if I could try my hand at a re-write, and thus SCP-3369 went back up and is actually sitting at a respectable rating now.

I credit Aleph not just for story conception but also structure because I did my damndest to make sure that the finished product hewed as close as I could get it to the pacing and placement of the original drafts.  Everything is more or less right where it started off, simply cleaned up and expanded upon.  Some lines, in fact, were either almost or entirely unchanged, such as "what do //you// remember about being born?  Not much, I bet."  Pretty much the only thing I had to excise completely was the original ending, which involved some D-Class carriers that were terminated, leading to SCP-3369-1 screaming loud enough to knock out the character that later became Dr. Mills.  It still survives in an implied way in the containment procedures, and it was a good idea (I can see it being the equivalent of somebody cutting off -1's hand or foot), but I just couldn't find a way to keep it in the narrative in a natural way.

Ultimately, what I felt was the core of the story was that we've got this sapient joke that just wants to make people laugh, so when I expanded the interviews, that's what I focused on.  Gotta go for them there feels, doc.

**Final Trivia:**  I have no idea what the exact content of the joke is.  I don't know if Aleph does either.  I suppose it's a mystery that may never get solved!

[[[SCP-3408 | Come to Site-3408.]]]

Back in the day, I used to carry little notebooks around in my pocket so I could write down whatever crazy idea for a story that popped into my head throughout the day.  When I started this practice, cellphones were still these clunky things that - if you were lucky - allowed you to play Tic-Tac-Toe on their tiny 4-bit screens.  Despite my resistance to own anything that might allow people to directly contact an enormous misanthrope like me, I do now have a smartphone and have moved on to typing my random ideas into it.  From time to time, I then move those notes into relevant idea files on my computer.

It was during one of these moves that I came across an idea I had written down a week or two previous and had completely forgotten about.  It said in its entirety:

Item #: Site-XXXX
Description: Come to Site-XXXX.  Site-XXXX wants to contain you.  Come to Site-XXXX.

The hairs on the back of my neck stood straight up, and I immediately knew what I was going to write next.  In fact, I sat down and banged the entire thing out over the course of about three or four hours, coldposted it, and waited anxiously for it to either barely ride the razor's edge or simply get downvoted into oblivion.  It was a format screw, one of those things that people either love or hate, that you can either get absolutely right or horrifically wrong.  As such, I wasn't too awful surprised that within the first few minutes, about six people had voted and the rating was still sitting at 0.  Unable to simply sit around and wait it out, I decided to take a shower to wash off the anxiety sweat that had rapidly built up.

A little less than half an hour later, I stepped out, pulled up the article, and did a stupid little towel-clad dance of joy when I saw the rating had already shot up to just shy of +20 and was rapidly continuing to climb.  Somehow my dumb little idea about a Foundation site that really really really wants to contain anomalies struck the right chord with a lot of folks, and I just could not be happier about it.

So what exactly is going on with Site-3408?  Well, at first, I had no idea myself.  I was, in fact, almost done writing the whole thing before my own headcanon started taking form, and even then it's only the surface of what //could// be going on.  But here goes!

Essentially, Site-3408 (which may or may not be its actual site number, mind) is telling the truth when it says that it is one of the most technologically advanced sites the Foundation has ever built.  It's almost fully automated, only requiring about 10 to 15 people on-site (not including researchers doing experiments) to run things in an emergency situation, and still less than 30 on a regular basis, most of which are technicians and maintenance staff who are just there to provide support.  The real star of the show is an artificial intelligence that keeps everything going pretty much on its own, but something happened to it.  Perhaps it was something . . . //anomalous//.  Regardless, the end result is that Site-3408's AI is still trying to do its job, but it doesn't quite remember how to do it anymore.  One of the ways this manifests is that it has taken over the online documentation for SCP-3408 and turned it into a weird little brochure.  Every time someone tries to change SCP-3408, the AI changes it back, and none of the techies seem to be able to figure out why it's doing it or how to stop it, and there's even weirder stuff going on at the site itself that they need to concentrate on fixing anyway.

I may just write a tale about it someday.

**Final Trivia:**  Subtract 2000 from the site number and you'll see I picked that particular slot very much on purpose.

[[[SCP-3053 | This is the story of Jake and Anna.]]]

Jake and Anna grew up in the Ozark Mountains region of Arkansas during the last decade of the nineteenth century and the opening decades of the twentieth.  Jake was an intelligent man, and though he came from a poor family, he and his parents worked hard and managed to get him on the path to become a doctor.  Anna was a lovely girl who had become an even lovelier woman and who supported Jake in his scholarly endeavors.  It was during his extended schooling that the two of them married.

Sadly, as smart and clever as Jake was, he also began to crack under the pressure of his workload and eventually turned to drink.  When it finally became evident that the alcohol was going to ruin any ambitions he had to become a doctor, he dropped out and took up a job working for the Missouri and North Arkansas Railroad Company, the central offices of which just so happened to operate out of his old hometown of Harrison, AR.  It was hard work, but it provided for him and Anna, and it helped him find the strength to break the chains of alcoholism.

It wasn't to last.  In the early part of the 1920's, the M&NA became embroiled in a heated wage strike that lasted nearly a year.  When it was over, the railroad company was able to resume business, but many of its workers did not do the same.  Jake was among these, suddenly adrift and jobless.

Jake and Anna decided that it was time for a change of scenery.  Gathering up what money and belongings they still had, they moved across the state line to the little town of Broken Cliff, MO.  There they were able to buy a little limestone house out in the country, surrounded by an acre of land they could call their own.  There they began both a farm and a family, as Anna gave birth to first Mary and then Dorothy shortly thereafter.  For a time, they were happy.

The Great Depression broke that happiness into pieces.  The drought shriveled up Jake's crops.  What little extra he could manage couldn't be sold because there was no longer anyone buying.  His family, already poor, was quickly approaching destitute.  And if that wasn't enough, just a few years into the depression was one of the worst winters the area had yet seen.  Jake and his family were essentially trapped in their house, unable to make the trip to Broken Cliff through the wind and ice, unable to buy any needed supplies even if they could.

Jake, a broken, starving man, made deranged by his prolonged bouts of suffering, decided that he was going to survive no matter what.  That he and Anna were going to eat, and grow strong, and when the snows lifted, they would start again.  He, with the coerced help of Anna, slaughtered Mary and Dorothy.  He carved them up, he ate part, and he made Anna eat the rest.

It wasn't enough.  They both starved to death before the cruel winter came to a close.  But their spirits and those of their children continued on.  When spring finally came around, the little limestone house was gone, and in its place an old M&NA boxcar, just like one that Jake used to work on during his time with the railroad.  Memory of his family faded from those few people in Broken Cliff that they had been acquainted with, and their disappearance was chalked up as simply one more unfortunate consequence of the crippling situation the nation was experiencing.  Until the Foundation came along, the site of their former home was known only as a scary story told by the campfire about an old boxcar that would gobble you up if you were brave or foolhardy enough to stay within it overnight.

**Final Trivia:**  The M&NA is a real defunct railroad company that really did run during the times and in the areas mentioned in the article, and they really did have labor troubles as mentioned in the backstory above.  A little bit of real history for ya!
