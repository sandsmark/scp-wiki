**Item #:**  SCP-Jim

**Object Class:**  Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**  As SCP-Jim is primarily self-containing, it is to simply be provided with a standard humanoid containment cell, a computer with an internet connection, and a weekly stipend of $50 USD to buy video games in order to promote continued cooperation.

**Description:**  Hello there!  My name is Roland Lowery, also known throughout the interwebs as Jim North.  My likes are video games, reading, writing, and collecting old computer parts.  My dislikes are talking about myself, so we're gonna keep this kinda short.

I've been writing (non-professionally) off and on for the past twenty years or so, and I thought I'd take a stab at this whole SCP Foundation thing.  See Addendum Jim-001 for a full list of my contributions to the site.

**Addendum Jim-001:**  Here is a full list of my contributions to the site.
