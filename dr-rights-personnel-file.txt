[[/div]]

**Name:** Agatha E. █████
Known by Alias "Dr. Rights", and will respond to a number of names, nicknames, and random words, including "Yellow", "Drake", "Tai", and "Snookums"

**Security Clearance Level:** ██████████

**Profession:** SCP Researcher and Analyst. Also; Annoyance.

**Personal Log:** [[[Dr. Rights' Personal Log]]]

**Location:** Although having a civilian residence in her hometown of ████████,██ with her boyfriend, Dr. Rights travels from Facility to Facility, often times sleeping in her office at Site 17 or on staff room couches.

**History:** Dr. Rights first came to attention in the case of [[DATA EXPUNGED]] Several years later, Dr. Rights contacted the SCP organization to make good on it's offer. She has proved an interesting resource and her bizarre application of many SCPs has led to two assumptions. One being that she is mentally unstable, and the other being that she is possibly a savant-level genius. Both have potential to be proven true. Additionally, it should be noted that despite rumors of Dr. Rights having Dissociative Identity Disorder, these are false. She merely has bad mood swings and a hormonal disorder. Dr. Rights has also been under investigation as a potential reality-bending force, but so far all tests have proven inconclusive beyond the findings that Dr. Rights is not, in fact, bulletproof.

**Additional Notes:** "I am well aware that rumors are circulating that I was investigated as an SCP in my youth. I would like to clear things up by saying that this is true, but I am a normal human being with no SCP properties. I was simply in the wrong place at the right time and wound up shanking a [[DATA EXPUNGED]] and that's how I got this job in the first place. So stop replacing the nametag on my office door with SCP-XXX, thank you very much." - Dr. Rights

"Yes, I'm dating a boy. Yes, I have dated girls. Get over it. That is my official statement on the matter." - Dr. Rights, while rolling her eyes.

"I'm well aware that I have pictures of questionable content on certain websites. When I find out who distributed a calendar of these pictures, I will personally assign you to Keter Duty." - Dr. Rights, after a mildly annoying day.

**Note:**//Calendars are still available, for only 20 dollars a  pop. Please indicate which of the three calendars you desire when ordering, as each contains a different set of pictures.All procedes go to the 'Buy Rights a New Web Cam' fund, although she may not know she's got it. Please send all requests through interpersonal mail to Dr. Kain. // 

**Note:** //BRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT!...You better get me a damn nice Webcam. A really good one. The kind with a remote. D<//
-Dr. Rights

"This is my lamp. I will ████████ beat you with it, if you try to pull that again!" - Dr. Rights, during a particularly bad day.
