[[/div]]

**Name:** Agatha E. █████
Known by Alias "Dr. Rights", and will respond to a number of names, nicknames, and random words. Also reacts to any mentioning of genitalia, male or female.

**Security Clearance Level:** ██████████

**Profession:** SCP Researcher and Analyst. Also; Annoyance.

**Location:** ████████,██

**History:** The shrill but repressed Dr. Rights first came to attention in the case of [[DATA EXPUNGED]] Several years later, Dr. Rights contacted the SCP organization to make good on its offer. She has proved an interesting resource and her bizarre application of many SCPs has led to two assumptions. One being that she is mentally unstable, and the other being that she is possibly a savant-level genius. Both have potential to be proven true. Additionally, it should be noted that despite rumors of Dr. Rights having Dissociative Identity Disorder, these are false. She merely has bad mood swings and a hormonal disorder. Dr. Rights has also been under investigation as a potential reality-bending force, but so far all tests have proven inconclusive beyond the findings that Dr. Rights is not, in fact, bulletproof.

**UPDATE:** Doctor Rights had a beautiful baby girl on November 1st! Congratulations! **MTF TEAM ALPHA SIX MOVE INTO POSITIONS TO SECURE THE ASSET**
