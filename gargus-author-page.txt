Hello new writers,
Look at your article,
now back to mine,
now back at your article,
now back to mine. Sadly, it isn't mine. But if you'd stopped posting articles straight to the site and used the channels that generate proper feedback you could write it like mine.

Look down, back up. Where are you? You're on the mainlist, with the article your article could be written like. What's in your skip? Back at the article. I have it. It's a tale with two new GoIs. Look again. The GoIs are mostly canon!

Anything is possible when you have your article proofread and get proper feedback before posting. I'm on a formerly winged horse.

*whistle*
