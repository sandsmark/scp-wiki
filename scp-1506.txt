**Item #:** SCP-1506

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** High-resolution satellite imagery is to be processed by computer for possible SCP-1506-1 occurrences. Once confirmed as an occurrence, SCP-1506-1's position is to be monitored and checked against computer modelling of wind patterns. Should SCP-1506 rapidly descend or ascend into a wind current predicted to take SCP-1506-1 through human populated areas, MTF Phi-17 (aka "The Arachnophobes") are to be readied for Procedures 1506-A, 1506-B and 1506-C

Procedure 1506-A: Using mobile anti-smog fans MTF Phi-17 are to attempt to guide SCP-1506-1 into a wind current predicted to take SCP-1506 towards a local nature reserve populated with larger mammalia. If necessary to disguise the procedure from the public, cover will be provided  as cutting edge industrial agriculture testing in rural areas and as air quality specialists in urban areas.

Procedure 1506-B: Should 1506-A fail to keep SCP-1506-1 away from human population centres, MTF Phi-17 are to begin a type-B amnestic treatment as necessary for witnesses of predation.

Procedure 1506-C: MTF Phi-17 are to use SCP-███ to contain the area around SCP-1506-1 while flamethrowers and arachnocide-7 are used to disperse SCP-1506-1. Arachnocide-7's boiling point is above 1500° C making it safe to use with conventional flame throwers. Under no circumstances may arachnocide-7 be used without SCP-███ in use to contain the aftermath. Arachnocide-7 must not be allowed to enter the biosphere.

Procedure 1506-D: Following incident 1506 Sigma, any instance of SCP-1506-1 larger than 200 cubic metres in commercial flight paths are cleared for immediate barometric implosion using FAE detonation, contained via SCP-███

**Description:** SCP-1506 is the designation for the global phenomenon which spontaneously generates instances of SCP-1506-1. 

SCP-1506-1 is the designation for any colony of at least approximately 900 spiders of mixed species. By application of multiple varieties of spider silk, SCP-1506-1 is able to build a complex web-structure less dense than air in which the spiders may live. SCP-1506-1 exhibits remarkable behaviour as individuals of mutually predatory arachnid species exhibit anomalous cooperation. SCP-1506-1 also shows changes in predation behaviour, web tension strength and web adhesion. SCP-1506-1 has been found at altitudes of up to 18 km. In order to change altitude, the volume of SCP-1506-1 is increased or decreased, suggesting the web structure is being consistently maintained. So far it is unknown how SCP-1506-1 is able to survive the low oxygen environment or the cold temperatures of the high altitudes colonies reach during flight, as instances are far too aggressive to have their web structure examined internally.

When SCP-1506-1 descends below 500 m, it is to be assumed that the colony will soon begin predation behaviour. Thus far it is unknown how spiders are able to detect their prey at this height. Currently it is theorised the colony is using electrosense. SCP-1506-1's preferred method of predation is to spin a web to the ground from altitude. Any mammal touching the spider web will instantly adhere and be unable to remove the web. When enough food has been caught SCP-1506-1 will reel in the web at ██ km/h. Modelling shows the whiplash effect from this will kill human prey 50% of the time. When SCP-1506-1 has its food, the web structure will engulf the animal. Consumption of prey takes place over days, dependent on both the size of the prey and the colony. Humans take approximately 5 days for an average sized colony to digest. The largest single prey animal recorded has been an elk, taking 11 days to digest. Waste is allowed to fall freely. It appears the corpses are mummified, however impact makes study of SCP-1506-1 food waste difficult. Observation indicates that humans are the preferred prey of SCP-1506-1

SCP-1506-1 was first identified as SCP-1506 before the realisation of multiple instances. SCP-1506-1 was first brought to the Foundation's attention on ██/██/20██ when a viral video thought to originate in Chile showed a man walking through the streets of [REDACTED] at 0247 local time according to the time stamps. For 2 minutes he is followed, changing cameras 8 times until he suddenly stops, looking very startled. The subject of the video begins brushing as his arms and face before vanishing. High speed analysis shows that he has been dragged vertically out of frame. The poor resolution of security footage has made it impossible to determine the actual speed but ██ km/h is within estimations. The footage has been doctored to remove the 3 frames and has been publically revealed to be part of the viral campaign for █████ energy drink.

Little headway has been made as to the mode of transmission of SCP-1506, but the most favoured theory is communication of learned behaviour. Investigation is ongoing into how the spiders communicate. Research on //Mallos gregalis// and other social spiders has been promising but so far no headway has been made. So far SCP-1506-1 has appeared on all continents except Antartica and shows no preference for member spider species, either solitary or social.

**Event 1501 Alpha:**
The following is a transcription from recovery agent in field audio on ██/██/20██
> **Agent R.:** I think it's trying to pretend it's a weather balloon, but weather balloons don't float this low. Great, we found the killer low flying weather balloon. I guess we could pop it?
> **Agent F.:** Middle initial. C isn't just for cookie buddy. 
> **Agent R.:** Whatever. I'm going in for a closer look.
> **Agent F.:** Stay sharp.
> //3:42 minutes of radio silence as Agent R. approaches location//
> **Agent R.:** I've got the binoculars, I can see it pulsing, it looks like it's made of cotton?
> **Agent F.:** What do you think, butterfly net?
> **Agent R.:** I don't think we're bringing this one in ourselves. We're going to need nerds. Urgh. 
> **Agent F.:** Hey don't be like that, they're why we have jobs.
> **Agent R.:** Not them. I stepped in a spiderwe...

**Event 1506 Sigma:** On ██/██/20██, SCP-1506-1-9 collided with commercial flight [REDACTED]. SCP-1506-1-9 had been under observation due to it's significant volume. It has been theorised that SCP-1506-1-9 contained over █ million individual spiders. On contact with the plane, SCP-1506-1-9 [DATA EXPUNGED]. Flight [REDACTED] was over an uninhabited area for the crash, preventing further casualties. It is believed that the resulting explosion and dispersal of the spiders that made up SCP-1506-1-9  is responsible for the increased rate of instances of SCP-1506-1 generating.
