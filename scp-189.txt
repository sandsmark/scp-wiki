**Item #:** SCP-189

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Samples of SCP-189 are to be stored in Cryo-containment Facility ██, with any surplus destroyed by incineration.  Test subjects infected with SCP-189 are to be kept in a sealed containment chamber with an airlock that includes a chemical shower, and personnel interacting with test subjects must wear standard NBC hazard suits throughout their time inside the containment chamber, and submit to a chemical shower before exiting the airlock on their way out.  When test subjects expire or are terminated, their remains must be sealed in an airtight container or body bag, which is subjected to the same chemical shower as the personnel carrying it out of the containment chamber, and disposed of by incineration.

Staff members found to be infested with SCP-189 are to be quarantined according to the procedure outlined above for test subjects, and treated with anti-parasitic agent 189-A.  See Document 189-█ for treatment procedure.  If SCP-189 infestation is discovered on any individual or animal at a facility, all personnel and animals at that facility are to be inspected for the presence of SCP-189 as detailed in Procedure 189-█, any staff members treated as described above, any D-Class and/or non-SCP animals terminated and incinerated, and the facility subjected to a thorough cleaning with anti-parasitic agent 189-A.

**Description:** SCP-189 is a species of parasitic roundworm (tentative taxonomic classification [DATA EXPUNGED]) capable of infesting any mammalian life form.  Infection most commonly occurs as a result of direct skin contact with one or more egg sacs.  These egg sacs are covered with microscopic "hooks" similar to those on the cuticles of some species of nematode, which anchor the sacs to the skin's surface.  Contact with sebum then prompts the eggs inside to hatch, at which time the larvae seek out and burrow into one or more nearby hair follicles.

Once inside the follicle, the larva attaches itself at the base of the papilla and begins feeding off the capillaries supplying the papilla.  Over the course of 2-3 days, the larva grows larger and develops into an adult.  When it has fully matured, the new adult detaches from the papilla, severs the hair fiber from the root, and almost fully envelops the papilla and hair matrix.  From this point forward, the worm feeds on the cells shed by the hair matrix (which would normally form the hair fiber), and begins to grow longer.

Adult SCP-189 specimens grow only in length, extruding a "tail" which incorporate somes of the pigments and keratin from the cells they consume into an outer cuticle.  This, combined with the fact that the diameter of a specimen's "tail" is usually similar to that of the hair that would normally grow from the host follicle, causes SCP-189 to be visually indistinguishable from a normal hair, except upon microscopic inspection.  However, some specimens will occasionally flex, coil and uncoil, and/or lash their "tail", particularly in response to tactile stimulation.  The reason for this behavior is not currently understood, nor is why only some individuals behave in this fashion, though it has been proposed that [DATA EXPUNGED].

As with many other species of roundworms, SCP-189 is hermaphroditic, with both sets of genitalia contained in the "head" (the portion enveloping the papilla and hair matrix).  Fertilized eggs are produced in groups of 1-3 and enveloped in a protective egg sac, which is then incorporated into the growing "tail".  Egg sacs grow their microscopic "hooks" and the eggs typically mature by the time the portion of the tail containing them has extended approximately 1 mm beyond the surface of the host's skin.  Once fully developed, the egg sac passes to the exterior of the organism's tail, becoming loosely embedded in its cuticle.  At this point, if the egg sac is brought into contact with a suitable host surface (including the skin of the current host), it attaches to this surface and is pulled free from its parent.  This is the primary method SCP-189 uses both to infect new hosts and to further infest the current host.

The "tail" of an adult specimen of SCP-189 is no more durable than normal hair, and its "head" no more strongly attached to the host follicle.  The "tail" can be cut or broken, or the entire organism pulled out, by any method that would similarly affect hair.  Severed sections of an adult's tail can grow a new "head" and regenerate into a separate individual, but only if they can attach to a suitable host.  The death of a follicle infested by an adult SCP-189 (or any other event that would cause the loss of that follicle's hair) causes that individual to detach from its host.  Without a host, adult SCP-189 die within 1-6 hours.  Mature eggs can remain viable for up to █ years after the death of their parent, and as such even dead adults can present a risk of infestation.

When an infected host dies, any surviving adult specimens of SCP-189 continue to feed and grow, eventually burrowing into the host's tissues.  Once decay begins, however, the specimen is killed by the toxins produced.

**Addendum:** SCP-189 first came to the Foundation's attention in 19██, when Dr. A████ F██████ adopted a stray kitten she found wandering near Site ██.  She brought the kitten to work at the Site, not realizing that over 90% of the animal's hair follicles had been infested with SCP-189.  This fact came to light when Doctor B████ was petting the kitten and its "fur" began to move.  Site ██ was locked down until the nature of SCP-189 was ascertained and the current containment procedures developed.
