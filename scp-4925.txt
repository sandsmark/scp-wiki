**Item #:** SCP-4925

**Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** A cost-benefit analysis run by the SCP-4925 containment team has deemed that, due to the innocuous nature of the anomaly, active containment is not necessary. Designated personnel are to continue using aliased email addresses to send emails to Heather Hutchins indicating that she may receive an important call.

**Description:** SCP-4925 is the collective designation for all cellphones that have manifested, or will manifest, in close proximity to Heather Hutchins, herself not otherwise anomalous. SCP-4925 instances are all iPhones of varying make and model, capable of making and receiving calls despite containing invalid SIM cards. SCP-4925 instances always appear while ringing. When a call from an SCP-4925 instance is not answered, another SCP-4925 instance will manifest within 5m of Hutchins. SCP-4925 instances appear most often when there is not a cell phone within 5m of Hutchins (SCP-4925 instance or otherwise) that:

* Is turned on
* Is set to ring instead of silent
* Has the "Do Not Disturb" setting disabled
* Has GPS tracking enabled

If answered, an unknown entity designated as SCP-4925-A will respond. SCP-4925-A appears to know everything about Heather Hutchins, including her current location, daily activities, and intimate details about her personal life.

**Discovery:** Embedded agents within the AT&T mobile company reported a series of unknown, untraceable calls being sent to a single location. Dispatched agents discovered these calls were localized around one Heather Hutchins, a student at the University of Michigan. Individuals close to Hutchins, such as her roommate and peers, indicated that she exhibited a significant amount of stress and anxiety when answering these calls. 

**Addendum SCP-4925-1:** Before SCP-4925 was formally designated as an anomaly, Hutchins was requested to attend a meeting with Agent Tennison, who was under cover as a school therapist.

> **Hutchins:** Ok...

> 
> **Tennison:** Just before we start, can you turn off your phone for me? 
> 
> **Hutchins:** Do I have to? 
> 
> **Tennison:** I would hate for us to be interrupted. Besides, we're only going to be a few minutes. 
> 
> **Hutchins:** Alright... I guess this can be quick...
> 
> //Hutchins slowly takes her phone out of her pocket and turns it off.//
> 
> **Tennison:** Thanks.
> 
> **Hutchins:** So, why do I have to be here again? I don't think I requested a meeting...
> 
> **Tennison:** That's right, you didn't. One of your friends reached out to me. Your friends are worried about you Heather. I just want to see if I can help. If you don't want to come back, that's fine, it's just a preliminary meeting to see if this would be useful for you.
> 
> **Hutchins:** Oh. I, uh, I appreciate the concern but I don't think this will help.
> 
> **Tennison:** Can I ask why? We might be able to help if you tell us what's going on.
> 
> **Hutchins:** It's just sort of a, like a personal thing I—

> **Hutchins:**...I'm sorry... I'm at this appointment and— yes. I'll go back right now... I'm sorry, mom.

[[collapsible show="+ Call #1" hide="- Call #1"]]

> **SCP-4925-A:** What are you doing? Why didn't you answer my first call?
> 
> **Hutchins:** I'm sorry. My phone ran out of battery.
> 
> **SCP-4925-A:** Why didn't you charge it?
> 
> **Hutchins:** I— I forgot. Sorry... I'll charge it when I get back to my room.
> 
> **SCP-4925-A:** You can't be so forgetful all the time if you're going to survive on your own! Are you at least studying while you're out?
> 
> **Hutchins:** I'm getting dinner.
> 
> **SCP-4925-A:** Does it take you an hour to eat? How are you so slow? You can't do two clubs, research, class work //and// take an hour to eat. 
> 
> **Hutchins:** I know, I'm sorry. I'm heading back soon. I'm only a twenty minute walk—
> 
> **SCP-4925-A:** Twenty minutes? Where did you go?
> 
> **Hutchins:** Chipotle?
> 
> **SCP-4925-A:** Why are you off campus when I bought you that meal plan? Do you want to be on your own for meals? Just say the word and I'll stop paying for it.
> 
> **Hutchins:** No, no! I'm sorry!
> 
> **SCP-4925-A:** That cafeteria is right next to your dorm. No excuse to take an hour to eat. No excuse.

> **SCP-4925-A:** Is that really what you're wearing?
> 
> **Hutchins:** I... I think so? It's kind of hot out today. 
> 
> **SCP-4925-A:** You're showing far too much skin! You look like a slut. Those barely count as shorts, and I can see your bra strap.
> 
> **Hutchins:** But—
> 
> **SCP-4925-A:** Put on some pants, and a proper shirt. 
> 
> **Hutchins:** It's like eighty degrees outside!
> 
> **SCP-4925-A:** Women cannot focus on studies when boys are drooling over them! Your grades are far too important. 
> 
> **Hutchins:** ... you're right. I'll change.
> 
> **SCP-4925-A:** I'm happy you agree.

> **Hutchins:** Hello?
> 
> **SCP-4925-A:** Heather. I am deeply disappointed. I saw your mid-semester grades.
> 
> **Hutchins:** Oh.
> 
> **SCP-4925-A:** A "B" in differential equations? That class is supposed to be easy! I knew you shouldn't have joined the drama club.
> 
> **Hutchins:** I had just one bad homework. I'll get it up—
> 
> **SCP-4925-A:** Yeah, you better. You're not allowed to go to your clubs until you get that back up to an "A".
> 
> **Hutchins:** But I have a part in this semester's show! 
> 
> **SCP-4925-A:** Well, they better find an understudy then right? 
> 
> **Hutchins:** Our show is in only two weeks! I've told my friends about it and Darrel even put me on the posters already!
> 
> **SCP-4925-A:** There you go again talking about that Darrel boy! You spend far too much time with him.
> 
> **Hutchins:** He's just a friend from drama, that's all.
> 
> **SCP-4925-A:** It sounds to me like he's impairing your judgement. What has happened to your priorities?
> 
> **Hutchins:** I'm just trying to do something to break up the studying!
> 
> **SCP-4925-A:** I guess if you've stopped caring about your academics, then I don't have to keep paying your tuition, do I?
> 
> **Hutchins:** What? No please!
> 
> **SCP-4925-A:** I'm not paying twenty-eight thousand dollars a year for you to play pretend and hang out with someone named Darrel! You are going to be a goddamn engineer, and you're going to study like one!
> 
> **Hutchins:** ... fine.
> 
> **SCP-4925-A:** Fine what? Go on, be specific.
> 
> **Hutchins:** I'll quit the club.
> 
> **SCP-4925-A:** And?
> 
> **Hutchins:** I'll stop talking to Darrel.
> 
> **SCP-4925-A:** There we go. Just don't forget, I'm doing this for you, honey. Your mother knows what's best for you.

**Addendum SCP-4925-3:** Investigation into Hutchins' family showed that her immediate family consisted solely of Darrell Hutchins. Hutchins' mother, Agnes Everson, had divorced from Mr. Hutchins two months prior. She died on 04/12/2017 in a car accident while leaving a voice mail on Hutchins' inbox. The following is a transcript of the voice mail:

> **Everson:** I've been trying to call you for like, ten minutes! Why won't you pick up the phone? I miss you so much. It's lonely out here. I just want to hear from my daughter for once. Is that too mu— damn it. That was red wasn't it? Anyways, I want to hear how your day was. Ask how school's going. Maybe I could help you with some of your homework? You know, I was going to be an engineer too before I met your fa— Err never mind. I'm rambling. Still, please pick up your pho— Shit!
> 
> //A screeching noise is heard, followed by a crashing noise. Shaky breathing can be heard for three minutes.//
> 
> **Everson:** Heather? 
> 
>  //A violin plays quietly for three minutes until it cuts out. After twenty two minutes the sound of a siren can be heard, which remains for sixty three minutes. The call is silent for three minutes afterwards.//

An hour after Everson was pronounced dead, the following voicemail was left on Hutchins' phone from an untraceable number:
 
> **SCP-4925-A:** Stop ignoring my calls. Ungrateful bitch.
