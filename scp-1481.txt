**Item #:** SCP-1481

**Object Class:** Safe 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1481 is to be kept in a securely locked safe on the second floor of Site-██. Site security is to remain on standby in proximity to tests conducted on SCP-1481.
 
**Description:** SCP-1481 is a plastic recyclable coffee cup. SCP-1481 rests in an inactive state until it is physically rubbed by a sapient being. When SCP-1481 is rubbed, it will enter its active phase, in which it manifests a spectral humanoid hereby referred to as SCP-XXXX-1. Only one active instance of SCP-1481-1 is ever present at one given time. Observed instances of SCP-1481-1 always resemble a spectral incarnation of and wearing a style of clothing consistent with that of a homeless man. SCP-1481-1 manifests dressed in multiple coats and torn jeans stained with a variety of unknown substances. All worn articles of clothing are spectral along with SCP-1481-1. SCP-1481-1 carries a nervous tic, which occurs every few minutes.

SCP-1481-1 manifests from the open-ended side of SCP-1481. Once SCP-1481-1 manifests, it will communicate with whichever individual initially rubbed SCP-1481. 

Once SCP-1481-1 has manifested, it will offer an individual a set of three wishes. Acceptable wishes demanded of SCP-1481 can range from any action being done to any object being obtained. SCP-1481 is noncompliant with a large portion of wishes and will often independently change the subject of any conversation with it. However, before a demanded wish can be granted, SCP-1481-1 will ask for various items in return. The items SCP-1481-1 asks for are not consistent between tests, however a certain uniform theme between the items is distinctly present between each test. Requests by SCP-1481-1 usually range from various forms of drugs or alcohol to large sums of money or warm food. Due to vigorous testing, researchers have become familiar for the most part with the terms that SCP-1481-1 uses to ask for what it wants.

**Addendum:** 

An interview was conducted between SCP-1481-1 and Doctor ████. The goal of the interview was to establish a general knowledge of the capabilities of SCP-1481-1. 

> **Procedure:** Doctor ████ rubbed SCP-1481 with his left shirt sleeve. SCP-1481-1 manifested from SCP-1481. Doctor ████ requested various objects or actions be done by SCP-1481-1 and asked SCP-1481-1 that the requests are granted as his three wishes.

> SCP-1481-1 verbally responded to Doctor ████.

>  //SCP-1481-1 was provided with 40 grams of methamphetamine. At the moment the methamphetamine was provided, SCP-1481-1 began to speak to Doctor ████ and continued to speak for five hours and twenty-three minutes. Much of what SCP-1481-1 said was impossible to comprehend babble with words made up by SCP-1481-1. However, a significant excerpt of information that SCP-1481-1 dictated has been kept in this report, as it may explain possible ties to the origin of SCP-1481-1//

__Excerpt of speech from SCP-1481-1__

//-and so der I was, in f-f-f-front of this guy waiting for him to make his wishes an all he did was look at me and wish for me to be a j-j-j-j-junky. His second wish was that the first wish couldn't be unwished. He didn’t even make the final wish I don’t understand it. So here I am. My life is r-r-r-ruined. Y’know I used to give kings whatever they wanted. I used to live in a palace. Now my only f-f-f-friend is the cold nights and hard ground with nowhere to lay my head down and I…//
 

At the moment SCP-1481-1 finished its story Doctor ████ reminded it of his wish. A one hundred gram chunk of coal manifested one meter in front of Doctor ████. SCP-1481-1 assured Doctor ████ that the chunk was pure diamond. SCP-1481-1 was asked why it doesn’t just manifest the various narcotics, alcohol or food items it craves, but SCP-1481-1 responded by crying and subsequently re-entering SCP-1481.

Further testing of SCP-1481 has been halted. Experimentation on a means of sobering up SCP-1481-1 is underway.
