title:CSS Policy
The following policy concerns CSS themes, primarily those that are self-contained and may be imported onto other pages, but much of this policy also applies to embedded CSS on individual pages.

[[module CSS]]
.policy { border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; }
[[/module]]

[[div class="policy"]]
+ Creation

A CSS theme should be drafted on a sandbox page.

Once you feel the theme is ready, you may move it to the Wiki proper. Once you have recieved permission from a member of the Tech Team ([http://05command.wikidot.com/tech-hub-chat #site11 in IRC]), who will make sure that your theme is compliant with this policy, you may create a new page on the wiki in the {{theme:}} category with the {{theme}} tag.

Some older themes have been posted to the {{component:}} category. Please use the {{theme:}} category.

The theme must be compliant with the following restrictions, listed below.
[[/div]]

[[div class="policy"]]
+ Restrictions

In order to be allowed on the site, there are a few restrictions that your theme must abide by.

**Licensing**

The theme must be released under the same Creative Commons license as the rest of the wiki.

**What you can and can't change**

You may change any of the style components of the wiki other than stuff that's specified in this policy.

You can't remove, hide, alter, or "break" any navigation elements of the wiki or the rating module.

You can't break the structure or look of the wiki beyond realistic expectations. The site should still be recognisable and readable.

You may style the translation module ({{.scpnet-interwiki-frame}}) using CSS3 Filters or similar, but you can't remove it outright (even if it conflicts horribly and you already tried using filters).

**Basic functionality**

Your CSS theme must work well in the major browsers (Chromium, Firefox, Safari) and be at least functional in minor ones (IE 11 etc).

Your CSS theme must work well on mobile as well as desktop.

**Setting up the theme's page**

The theme's page is where the source code of your CSS theme is kept.

You must instruct users to add your theme to their page using Wikidot's [[include]] method (and set up your theme page accordingly. [http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/css-include-template Here's a template].

You may not instruct users to add your theme to their page via CSS's {{@import}} method.[[footnote]]If you see a page that uses a theme via the @import method, and an [[include]] method is available for that theme, you may edit the page to update it to the new method.[[/footnote]]

You must provide usage instructions on your theme's page. Note that this only refers to telling users what to type to get the theme to show up on their article. If your theme has any special features that an author should know how to use, these must be documented as well. You do not need to include examples of your theme's formatting -- although you totally can, and definitely should!

Your theme's page must have your theme applied to it -- i.e. your page must act as a preview of your theme. If you used the template linked above, this will be done for you.

The Tech Team member who's approving your theme will expect to see not only your CSS source code, but a draft of your theme's page.

**Bloat code**

A CSS theme cannot contain huge amounts of code that doesn't do anything. A CSS theme's source code should contain little, if anything, other than what this theme changes from sigma9 (the wiki's base CSS theme). Vast sections copy-pasted from sigma9 are strictly not allowed.

Someone familiar with CSS should be able to look at your theme and know exactly what your intent is. At the very least, you should be able to justify why you have chosen to include any given line.

Additionally, you should try to avoid using the {{!important}} marker unless you need to override something in sigma9 or to provide compatibility with other CSS.

**Accessibility**

Accessibility concerns should be considered when composing a CSS theme. For example:

* Is this theme readable for colorblind people? (e.g. it employs bad color combinations like red + green which make it difficult for colorblind users to navigate the site)
* Does this theme hamper the ability to use screen readers? (e.g. it adds 'invisible' content which gets read by screen readers but not sighted users)
* Are the fonts it uses legible for all users? (e.g. the body font size is too small, the font itself is difficult to read)
and so on. Best practices and recommendations to address all of these potential issues are easily available with a cursory Google search.

**Hotlinking**

Hotlinking is the practice of linking to files on another site, and is both incredibly bad practice and against site rules. It is incredibly bad manners to force someone's site to load images for your theme, and also introduces a degree of unreliability to your theme -- what if that site disappears?

To prevent hotlinking, all images, fonts and miscellaneous files used in a CSS theme must be files uploaded to the theme's page rather than linked from elsewhere on the internet.

However, you are permitted to use certain sites that explicitly encourage hotlinking for serving files to users. Notable examples include [https://fonts.google.com/ Google Fonts] and [https://picsum.photos/ Lorem Picsum]. If in doubt, play it safe and [http://05command.wikidot.com/tech-hub-chat ask the Tech Team].

Additionally, CSS should not be linked from sandbox pages or anywhere that isn't the main site (outside of workbenches). Please use a {{theme:}} page on the wiki for CSS themes. This isn't a hard rule, just try to avoid it. If you're going to use a CSS theme, might as well make it official!

**Being used**

CSS themes that aren't being used aren't allowed on the site. To get your theme approved you'll have to assert //at least one// of the following:

* That the theme is going to be used on an article that already exists on the wiki
* That the theme is going to be posted at about the same time as an article that will use it
* That the theme is going to be posted shortly before (up to a week) an article that will use it

For the purposes of this section, author pages do not count. Articles on other wikis do not count unless that wiki is an international SCP Branch.

Whoever is approving your theme may ask to see either the article or draft that the theme will be used on.

**Approval**

Before being posted, your theme must be approved by a member of the Tech Team. They will take a look at your theme and ascertain whether or not it is compliant with this policy.

Only Operational Staff and up can approve a CSS theme. The Technical Directory gets final say in any approvals.

You can find the Tech Team in [http://05command.wikidot.com/tech-hub-chat #site11 in IRC], or via [http://05command.wikidot.com/technical-staff-main Wikidot PM].

+ Deletion policy for CSS themes

CSS themes are treated like normal pages in that other users are not permitted to make major changes to your work. Small mistakes are considered equivalent to spelling and grammar errors and may be corrected by any well-meaning user.

CSS themes are affected by the regular deletion policy, and are eligible for deletion once they fall under -10 votes. Additionally, a theme that is not being used on any pages is eligible for deletion regardless of how many votes it has.

[[div class="policy"]]
+ Remediating non-compliant themes

If your theme doesn't function in the major browsers (Chromium, Firefox, Safari, mobile, IE11) in a way that completely breaks navigation, function, or accessibility, it needs to be **removed** (or at bare minimum, removed from include blocks) from the site, then fixed, in that order. Our first priority is compatibility, function, and accessibility.

[[collapsible show="Approval Checklist"]]
++ Requirements
The theme must be able to answer "yes" to all these questions.
# Is it clear what the theme does?
# Is the theme applied to its own page?
# Does it appear to work? Is it free of obvious errors?
# Does it work on mobile? (some sandboxes do not have a mobile version, you may need to use the theme on a page that does have one)
# Does it work on another browser? (try IE11)
# Are the navigation components all present and ok?
# Does the page still look like the SCP wiki?
# Are there usage instructions?
# Is the page using [[include]]?
# Is there a lot of bloat code? (e.g. large sections copied from sigma9 or other themes) (if in doubt, ask the author to explain what a section is for. If they can't, it's likely bloat)
# Is the CSS easy to understand? Where there are complicated parts, are they difficult commented? (there should be no parts that you don't understand AND the author can't explain)
# Is the theme free of any accessibility issues? (e.g. low contrast colour choices, unreadable or too-small fonts)
# Is !important used reasonably? (a few uses are ok, none is ideal)
# ctrl+f for http, are all external resources hosted on wikidot?
# Is the theme currently being used on any pages? If not, can the user demonstrate that it is soon going to be used?
# If the theme provides any custom divs, is their usage documented?
Make sure the author posts their theme to the theme category, and tags it theme. Log any co-authors in attribution metadata. 

++ Non-Requirements
If the theme can't answer "yes" to any of these questions, offer advice on how to improve it. They are not required for approval. 
# Is the code clean and easy to understand?
# Is the CSS properly indented? (poor indentation can be indicative of mass copy-pasting)
# Does the theme look good?
# Do you think the author understands what each part of their code does?
# Is it clear what the theme is for, and who should be using it?
