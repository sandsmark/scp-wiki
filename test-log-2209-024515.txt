> 
> **Dr. Davids:** What do you mean?
> 
> **D-5081:** It's like I'm looking at myself through a whole bunch of cameras. I'm in a big round room. Well, more like I'm inside a giant hamster ball. The walls are white and covered in all these little metal circles. And there's a big circle in the middle in front of me, with blue lights all around it.

> 
> **Dr. Davids:** What do you see? 
> 
> **D-5081:** (shouting) I'm on stage at a Slipknot concert! I am literally right behind Taylor! I can even feel how hot it is in here! It's frickin' incredible!

D-5081 emerged from SCP-2209-1 visibly shaken. Upon interview, D-5081 described encountering multiple tall, black, humanoid entities.

//I ran D-5081's description through the database - turned up multiple references to an existing item. Is it possible that SCP-2209-1 somehow managed to access one of our servers?// - Dr. ████████ Davids

//High unlikely; there have been no reported failures in the unit's electromagnetic isolation field since SCP-2209 was brought into containment, and our network is secure. I think the more appropriate question to ask would be "Who made this thing?"// - Dr. ████ Carter
