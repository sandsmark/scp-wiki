Ah yes, my first SCP. This one had to be a record for the longest time it took to write an SCP article. It took //two years// to get this sucker to something that would survive on the mainlist, and another six months to rewrite it into something that could maintain a double-digit rating. And that's not even mentioning that I had been an active member of this site for //four years// before posting a successful article. Yes, I am bad at giving up.

Unlike most people's first SCPs, I am definitely proud of this one. It has easily my favorite concept of any skip I've written. When I came up with it, I was starting to become interested in cyber security, and coincidentally the Mirai botnet was also wreaking havoc on the eastern seaboard. In an attempt to "write what I know", I came up with "botnets for people", which then evolved into "malware for people". After the shocking realization that nobody had written that yet, I went with it. The original article was quite a bit different from it is now (there was a way-too-long and not-that-interesting backstory that took up most of the original; a relic of my Series III christening), but most of the current article is just me taking that idea and running with it as far as I can.
