Placeholder until I think of something to put here.

Just be glad it's not that abomination I had before

Ah yes, my first SCP. This one had to be a record for the longest time it took to write an SCP article. It took //two years// to get this sucker to something that would survive on the mainlist, and another six months to rewrite it into something that could maintain a double-digit rating. And that's not even mentioning that I had been an active member of this site for //four years// before posting a successful article. Yes, I am bad at giving up.

Unlike most people's first SCPs, I am definitely proud of this one. It has easily my favorite concept of  any skip I've written. When I came up with it, I was starting to become interested in cyber security, and coincidentally the Mirai botnet was also wreaking havoc on the eastern seaboard. In an attempt to "write what I know", I came up with "botnets for people", which then evolved into "malware for people". After the shocking realization that nobody had written that yet, I went with it. The original article was quite a bit different from it is now (there was a way-too-long and not-that-interesting backstory that took up most of the original; a relic of my Series III christening), but most of the current article is just me taking that idea and running with it as far as I can.

This was my entry for ClicheCon. It's my most highly-voted SCP as of writing this, though I hold that that's because of the increased visibility rather than as a measure of quality.

I knew I wanted to do a monster SCP right away. I've always had a soft spot for monster SCPs - even if so few of them are done well - and I already had a concept floating around I thought could work. The crit process for this was a headache, though. Towards the end of my brainstorming phase, I started having doubts about the strength of the story, and so I tried to salvage it by making the storytelling very, very vague. I also hoped this would lead the readers to speculate about what was actually going on behind the scenes. Of course, this meant I had to find a balance between being too nebulous and showing my hand early, which made the crit process a living nightmare that took almost two weeks. 

On top of that, my attempt to drive the reader's imagination seems to have backfired spectacularly; almost all of the feedback I got upon posting was requests for an explanation, which I reluctantly put in my author post. I still regret doing that, and I encourage people to go with their own headcanon rather than taking my version as word of god.

This was a rewrite of Mew's original 4412 that we put together in about the span of a week. Mew's already immortalized most of this story in her author post, so I won't go into gritty details. Her side of the story is more interesting than mine anyways.

This SCP is definitely very different from the rest of the articles I've worked on. It's definitely not the kind of skip I would write by myself, or even that I usually care for. While most of my own concepts are based on concepts that intrigue me, this one was based around an simple, emotional, character-driven story. That's definitely not the kind of thing I would consider myself good at, so I'm surprised this didn't turn out to be a complete train wreck.
