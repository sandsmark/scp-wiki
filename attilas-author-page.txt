**Item #:** SCPun-1337

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCPun-1337 is to be held in a low-risk humanoid containment cell. In the event that it becomes violent, SCPun-1337 is to be subdued by site security using cringe comedy. Bouts of rage and threats to Foundation personnel are to be ignored.

**Description:** SCPun-1337 is a humanoid entity self-identified as "Attila The Pun (sic)". While SCPun-1337's appearance is consistent with descriptions of Attila the Hun[[footnote]]5th century tuler of a tribal empire consisting of Huns, Ostrogoths, and Alans among others.[[/footnote]], genetic analysis suggests SCPun-1337 is of predominantly Irish descent. Further confusing the matter, the entity primarily communicates in English with a heavy accent, but has been observed to speak fluent Serbian, Scots Gaelic, Comanche, Neo-Aramaic, and Pig Latin when enraged.

While it displays some elements of incorporeality, SCPun-1337 is fully capable of interacting with inanimate objects under most circumstances. Unable to be damaged through traditional means, SCPun-1337 appears to be physically harmed by "poor comedy". This includes explaining a punchline, repeating a joke several times with no modifications, use of poor timing, and other situations breaking common rules of comedy. Attempts to use this as a means of motivation have been inconsistent.

SCPun-1337 claims to be the leader of a nation called the Puns. While the entity's descriptions of this nation have been inconsistent, it is believed to be extradimensional in nature. The entity claims to have successfully led military campaigns against many other nations - typically with names associated with types of comedy, such as the Kingdom of Irony, Slapstigoth tribes, and Deadpan Empire - until it had conquered the vast majority of its home world. The entity then attempted to lead another campaign against Earth through unknown means, ending in a disastrous defeat. SCPun-1337 now believes itself to be a prisoner of war, and has continually made demands and attempts to return to its home dimension.
 
**Addendum 1337-1 - SCPs:** SCPun-1337 has displayed extensive knowledge of multiple SCP objects and events kept on file. It is not known how SCPun-1337 had access to this information.

Ah yes, my first SCP. This one had to be a record for the longest time it took to write an SCP article. It took //two years// to get this sucker to something that would survive on the mainlist, and another six months to rewrite it into something that could maintain a double-digit rating. And that's not even mentioning that I had been an active member of this site for //four years// before posting a successful article. Yes, I am bad at giving up.

Unlike most people's first SCPs, I am definitely proud of this one. It has easily my favorite concept of  any skip I've written. When I came up with it, I was starting to become interested in cyber security, and coincidentally the Mirai botnet was also wreaking havoc on the eastern seaboard. In an attempt to "write what I know", I came up with "botnets for people", which then evolved into "malware for people". After the shocking realization that nobody had written that yet, I went with it. The original article was quite a bit different from it is now (there was a way-too-long and not-that-interesting backstory that took up most of the original; a relic of my Series III christening), but most of the current article is just me taking that idea and running with it as far as I can.

This was my entry for ClicheCon. It's my most highly-voted SCP as of writing this, though I hold that that's because of the increased visibility rather than as a measure of quality.

I knew I wanted to do a monster SCP right away. I've always had a soft spot for monster SCPs - even if so few of them are done well - and I already had a concept floating around I thought could work. The crit process for this was a headache, though. Towards the end of my brainstorming phase, I started having doubts about the strength of the story, and so I tried to salvage it by making the storytelling very, very vague. I also hoped this would lead the readers to speculate about what was actually going on behind the scenes. Of course, this meant I had to find a balance between being too nebulous and showing my hand early, which made the crit process a living nightmare that took almost two weeks. 

On top of that, my attempt to drive the reader's imagination seems to have backfired spectacularly; almost all of the feedback I got upon posting was requests for an explanation, which I reluctantly put in my author post. I still regret doing that, and I encourage people to go with their own headcanon rather than taking my version as word of god.

This was a rewrite of Mew's original 4412 that we put together in about the span of a week. Mew's already immortalized most of this story in her author post, so I won't go into gritty details. Her side of the story is more interesting than mine anyways.

This SCP is definitely very different from the rest of the articles I've worked on. It's definitely not the kind of skip I would write by myself, or even that I usually care for. While most of my own concepts are based on concepts that intrigue me, this one was based around an simple, emotional, character-driven story. That's definitely not the kind of thing I would consider myself good at, so I'm surprised this didn't turn out to be a complete train wreck.

Oh look, it's this godforsaken abomination.

Yes, it's kind of cringey, but I haven't been able to come up with anything better, so this will probably be what we'll get for a while now.

**Addendum 1337-4 - ICE:** 
[[collapsible show="+ Okay, real talk" hide="- Here we go"]]
> Okay, so, it's possible that I may one day decide to leave the site, especially considering my relationship with the community has been a fairly rocky one. And while I would hope that I will ascend to my eternal home long after anyone will have stopped caring about my writings, it is possible that I may pass prematurely, and it is unlikely that anyone else on this site would hear about it. In the event that I disappear into oblivion, here's what to do with my stuff:
> 
> * I can't think of anyone who would care to take responsibility for my crud, so if any of my stuff needs editing and I have been inactive[[footnote]] i.e. No posts, comments, or edits over the time frame. Otherwise, assume I'm still alive.[[/footnote]] for a period of 4 months, go ahead and make them. If I ever make the decision to drop off the site for good, or just decide to take a long hiatus, I will probably leave an editing guide in my author post, so follow that.
> * If by some act of treachery any of my SCPs falls into the deletion range, anyone who has displayed competence as an author can attempt to rewrite it if I don't respond to a request within 7 days.
> * I trust the licensing team can take care of any issues on that front, if by some miracle any come up.
> * I typically draft off site, but anyone can use whatever's on my sandbox if I have been inactive for more than a year and as long as I am given credit.
