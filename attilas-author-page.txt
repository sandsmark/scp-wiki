**Item #:** SCPun-1337

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCPun-1337 is to be held in a low-risk humanoid containment cell. In the event that it becomes violent, SCPun-1337 is to be subdued by site security using cringe comedy. Bouts of rage and threats to Foundation personnel are to be ignored.

**Description:** SCPun-1337 is a humanoid entity self-identified as "Attila The Pun (sic)". While SCPun-1337's appearance is consistent with descriptions of Attila the Hun[[footnote]]5th century tuler of a tribal empire consisting of Huns, Ostrogoths, and Alans among others.[[/footnote]], genetic analysis suggests SCPun-1337 is of predominantly Irish descent. Further confusing the matter, the entity primarily communicates in English with a heavy accent, but has been observed to speak fluent Serbian, Scots Gaelic, Comanche, Neo-Aramaic, and Pig Latin when enraged.

While it displays some elements of incorporeality, SCPun-1337 is fully capable of interacting with inanimate objects under most circumstances. Unable to be damaged through traditional means, SCPun-1337 appears to be physically harmed by "poor comedy". This includes explaining a punchline, repeating a joke several times with no modifications, use of poor timing, and other situations breaking common rules of comedy. Attempts to use this as a means of motivation have been inconsistent.

SCPun-1337 claims to be the leader of a nation called the Puns. While the entity's descriptions of this nation have been inconsistent, it is believed to be extradimensional in nature. The entity claims to have successfully led military campaigns against many other nations - typically with names associated with types of comedy, such as the Kingdom of Irony, Slapstigoth tribes, and Deadpan Empire - until it had conquered the vast majority of its home world. The entity then attempted to lead another campaign against Earth through unknown means, ending in a disastrous defeat. SCPun-1337 now believes itself to be a prisoner of war, and has continually made demands and attempts to return to its home dimension.

> Okay, so, it's possible that I may one day decide to leave the site, especially considering my relationship with the community has been a fairly rocky one. And while I would hope that I will ascend to my eternal home long after anyone will have stopped caring about my writings, it is possible that I may pass prematurely, and it is unlikely that anyone else on this site would hear about it. In the event that I disappear into oblivion, here's what to do with my stuff:
> 
> * I can't think of anyone who would care to take responsibility for my crud, so if any of my stuff needs editing and I have been inactive[[footnote]] i.e. No posts, comments, or edits over the time frame. Otherwise, assume I'm still alive.[[/footnote]] for a period of 4 months, go ahead and make them. If I ever make the decision to drop off the site for good, or just decide to take a long hiatus, I will probably leave an editing guide in my author post, so follow that.
> * If by some act of treachery any of my SCPs falls into the deletion range, anyone who has displayed competence as an author can attempt to rewrite it if I don't respond to a request within 7 days. For the tales, just let those die quietly.
> * If you PM me a request to write something about my scips/characters, you have my implied permission if I don't reply within 7 days or if I have been inactive for 2 months.
> * I trust the licensing team can take care of any issues on that front, if by some miracle any come up.
> * I typically draft off site, but anyone can use whatever's on my sandbox if I have been inactive for more than a year and as long as I am given credit.
