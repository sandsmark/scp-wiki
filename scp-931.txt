Its **Item Number**
Is SCP Nine Three One;
**Object Class** is Safe.

Heed these **Procedures**,
To keep the item secure--
**Special Containment**.

Kept at Site-19
In a Level 2 locker,
But no extra guards.

Free access to it
Is prohibited to most:
Need Third-tier clearance.

Effects are triggered
By some images of it--
Depends on angle.

Writing about it
Will always be affected,
Despite ignorance.

A **Description** of
SCP Nine Thirty-One:
It is a rice bowl.

White, with a blue band,
And a crackled blue pattern
All inside the bowl.

Three inches in height,
Four point five inches across.
(Metric doesn’t fit.)

No makers’ marks found;
Suspected to have been made
Late Nineteen Hundreds.

When viewed or handled,
The item causes people
To write in haiku.

(Not the classic sense:
Natural motifs aren’t enforced,
Just Five-Seven-Five.)

Speech remains unchanged,
But trying to write or type
Ends up as haiku.

Exposure effects
Wear off within a few hours
(Varies by subject).

Anything written
About it-- also haiku,
Even if absent.

If written by one
Ignorant of its effect,
They’re unaffected.

Its affect appears
To be memetic in source--
Though not yet proven.

Evidence for this?
Those exposed who know haiku
Write “proper” haiku.

Most people exposed,
Who don’t know these requirements,
Just know the structure.
