+ JACKALRELATED'S COMMENTARY OF HORROR AND LOATHING[[footnote]] yes really [[/footnote]]
[[/=]]

[[collapsible show="» Do Not Collect $200" hide="« monopoly isn't even anomalous"]]
> You sold me out for Reading Railroad and Electric Company. Look who's fucking talking.

DNC200 was my first successful page on the wiki, after my failed draft of --SCP-3917, a bullet that turned other bullets into duds--. Initial reaction was pretty well-received actually, even though I honestly only spent a day on it. The divs I created were the email format, and the computer "WebNET" div was an edited version of SCP-2409's, albeit more clunky. It was written for the Tales of Anomalous Items challenge, created by Westrin. I had created another tale for a different Anomalous Item, the bangy MP5-K, but in the end I didn't like how it turned out and neither did the critters. So I wrote DNC$200. I'm fine with the article itself, but you guys really blew me away with the turnout I got from it. As quoted from Westrin:

> God damn, this is great.

Thanks so much for the positive response!

[[/collapsible]]
[[collapsible show="» Critter Profile: Genghis!" hide="« cute lil' locust"]]

> When he started calling the cute guy "Dschinghis Khan", however, I asked if he could shorten it to "Genghis". And that's how Genghis got his name!

'Critter Profile: Genghis!' was written for Doomcon 2018. Initially it was going to be a different format, but since the Critter Profile format was underloved and Genghis could fit into one, I decided to make it into a format. Now, the article's doing ok, but I think it's just too short for its substance. Not only that, but a lot of the information was repeated several times. I also think I got the Oregon accent wrong while writing, but what do I know? :P

[[/collapsible]]
[[collapsible show="» ARBH-Class Debrief File" hide="« is this even considered a page"]]

> "I hate spiders. Especially big, furry, anomalous, world-ending ones."

Actual quote of mine. I remember *ahem* ,,borrowing,, the format from another user's failed skip. This page was rather straightforward, and despite my creating random scientific names here and there it seems like it did alright!

[[/collapsible]]
[[collapsible show="» The Morality of Insects" hide="« fun fact: ant murder"]]

I'm not quoting these. They all have terrible quotes. The first in the literal trash series, The Morality of Insects is done on a TV show. If any of you have seen the classic '78 Dawn of the Dead, this was inspired by the opening scene at Fran's TV station. I actually cut quite a bit of the transcript, because in the end I found it was just basically filler. The break room scene at the end wasn't included in the initial draft (I write things out before actually doing theme), and was actually only added on because I thought it made a better closing.

[[/collapsible]]
[[collapsible show="» The Last of LARPA" hide="« oh god"]]

It's trash. Literally. The draft and its current version has so many things wrong with it I just can't even talk about it. After the contest is over it's going to get rewritten.

[[/collapsible]]
[[collapsible show="» Zero Hour" hide="« i actually like this one"]]

I actually rather like Zero Hour, especially after I failed to characterize Simmons and Petahn in the first two. Zero Hour isn't the best either, considering I lost the original draft and rewrote it on the last day of Doomcon. (shh, don't tell anyone) The Doomcon tale series I made were all coldposted - no one saw any of this before it had been posted. Thus, I'm grateful for the +10s you all gave me for the series. I'll improve on it, and I'll one day be a decent writer!

[[/collapsible]]
[[collapsible show="» SCP-WOW-J" hide="« madlad galore"]]

I only have several words for this.

//Dr. Fynegan and Agent Forelli's Bizarre Adventure.//

Thanks to [[*user Prototype_Toaster]] for creating the idea and letting me help out. SCP-WOW-J is IRC Chat ping terrorism.

[[collapsible show="» SCP-4917" hide="« law and order"]]
This is my first official SCP, and it's mainly [*user Uncle Nicolini]'s efforts that got this SCP up in the first place. This one is definitely dedicated to my main man nico! Written for the "_all-a-dream" theme in JamCon 2019.
[[/collapsible]]
[[collapsible show="» JackalRelated" hide="« ok dude"]]
Things I think I have a problem with:
* Quotation grammar.
* Storytelling with dialogue.
* Using too much dialogue.
* Using stale dialogue
* Thinking I've made something good to come back in an hour and hate it
* Spending forever on something trash
* Taking a day to write something "good"
* --existing-- not being ethereal
* not being able to show how much you all are great people
