**Item #:** SCP-822

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Specimens of SCP-822 are contained in an isolation chamber at Site ██. No personnel are allowed inside the chamber at any time. Watering must be performed by an automated mister, and any maintenance work must be done remotely or with robotic assistance.

**Description:** SCP-822 is a type of plant, similar in appearance to //Lophophora williamsii// (common name Peyote) but with significant differences as the plant reaches maturity within 30 days. As SCP-822 nears maturity, a large gas sac begins to form within the center of the plant as it reaches its typical maximum dimensions of 10cm in height and 25cm in diameter. This sac is filled with volatile gasses, including ████████, ████, and several substances not known to modern science. At the same time, the skin of SCP-822 begins hardening, until reaching a hardness not unlike sheet metal, and seeds begin to form just under the skin. Once the plant is fully mature, it flowers and begins extruding a pheromone that has proven to be effective at attracting nearly 87% of all mammals of sufficient mass to trigger its anomalous property.

Through an unknown mechanism, whenever any living creature of sufficient mass (approximately 10-20 kg) approaches within 3 meters of SCP-822, the central portion containing the gas sac violently detonates, causing shrapnel-like shards of SCP-822's skin to fly through the air. These razor-sharp fragments are capable of embedding themselves into the skin and flesh of any living creatures nearby, and thus carrying the seeds of SCP-822 away. Living creatures struck by these fragments that do not die from physical trauma eventually succumb to a potent neurotoxin synthesized by the fragments within three (3) to six (6) hours.

SCP-822 was first discovered at a military proving ground near [DATA EXPUNGED]. SCP-822 was reported to the Foundation after 3 personnel were killed when they drove a vehicle near a large patch of SCP-822, and a fourth managed to return to the base before expiring. Investigation of the infested area turned up hundreds of specimens of SCP-822, with the corpses of dozens of animals that had wandered into the area and been killed, some of which had SCP-822 growing directly from their flesh. After sample specimens were collected, the entire area was subjected to firebombing, incinerating all SCP-822 in the area.

**Experiment Log 822-1:**
Record of experimentation performed to determine limits of triggering mechanism for SCP-822.

**Date:** █/██/██
**Subject:** D-9912
**Procedure:** Subject equipped with heavy armor similar to that used by military bomb squads, then instructed to approach SCP-822
**Results:**
SCP-822 detonates as Subject approaches within precisely 3 meters of specimen. Shock sensors record blast as equivalent to the detonation of a ████ ███ land mine. Subject suffers injuries consistent with being in close proximity to high-explosives detonation, such as ruptured eardrums.

**Date:** █/██/██
**Subject:** Robotic rover, approximately 20 kg in mass
**Procedure:** Manipulation of specimen of SCP-822 using rover attempted
**Results:**
Subject successfully approaches SCP-822 and successfully uproots SCP-822 specimen. However, specimen is dropped while moving away, causing specimen to detonate. Rover badly damaged.

**Date:** █/██/██
**Subject:** D-9989
**Procedure:** Subject is restrained completely as to prevent any movement, specimen of SCP-822 is moved towards Subject via robotic rover
**Results:**
SCP-822 specimen detonates when brought within 3 meters of Subject. Subject survives initial detonation but succumbs to neurotoxin.

**Date:** ██/█/██
**Subject:** D-9989 (Deceased)
**Procedure:** Specimen of SCP-822 moved towards dead body of Subject
**Results:**
SCP-822 does not detonate, even when placed directly on body of Subject.

**Date:** ██/██/██
**Subject:** D-10021
**Procedure:** Specimen of SCP-822 placed against blank wall of isolation chamber designed to completely absorb all sound, vibration, and temperature fluctuation. Subject instructed to move towards SCP-822 while separated by wall of isolation chamber.
**Results:**
SCP-822 detonates when Subject approaches within 3 meters of specimen. Minimal damage to isolation chamber, no harm to Subject.

//"Apparently SCP-822 is capable of detecting living creatures within its trigger radius, despite not being able to "see" the target, detect its sounds, its movement, or any shifts in temperature. More experimentation needs to be done to determine how it does this." - Dr. █████████//
