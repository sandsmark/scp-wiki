**Project Codename:** Olympia

**Project#:** PRJOLM-000134

**Clearance and File#:** NPF-00051473

**Changes to Olympia Prime (//Production Model Template//):**
* Left eye is to come from [[[experiment-log-914-theta#toc1|Experiment 914 THETA Test Subject 2]]], rather than [[[experiment-log-914-theta#toc12|Experiment 914 THETA Test Subject 13]]].
* Lower left leg and foot, lower right leg and foot, and neck and head musculature and various organs of [[[experiment-log-914-theta#toc1|Experiment 914 THETA Test Subject 2]]], rather than [[[experiment-log-914-theta#toc4|Experiment 914 THETA Test Subject 5]]].
* Mental body is to be recreated via the processes outlined in [[[Experiment Log 158-AG]]], as [[[kain-pathos-crow-s-author-page|Professor Kain Pathos Crow]]] has disallowed direct copying of Olympia Zero.

**Security, Control and Containment Procedures:**
* A small audio device is to be implanted within the inner ear cochlear canals into all subjects. Implant is to be recharged via kinetic energy generated by the subject. Implant is to play [[[SCP-061]]] non-stop. Subjects are then to be "programmed" via complex verbal commands until a workable AI has been established.
* While in service, subjects are to be outfitted at all times with:
 * One (1) helmet, fitted with variable multipurpose goggles, and shielding against electromagnetic pulse, and a comm uplink for command and control purposes. Helmet is also internally fitted with a small electromagnetic explosive, as an instant kill device in case the subject is compromised.
 * A full body suit that allows for maximum movement ability, and constructed of variable heat retention polymers. Also available in camouflage varieties.
 * A variety of projectile and close combat weapons as situation warrants.

**Production Procedures:**
Subjects are to be cloned directly from Olympia Prime using [[[SCP-222]]], then modified and implanted with the cochlear audio device. Programming can then take place.
