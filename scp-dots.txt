Doctor Dots drums her fingernails across her keyboard. Her eyes wander down to the badge that lay on her desk. ‘Candi April Dots—Containment Specialist’. Containment specialist. Contain. Ment. Special. Ist.

> just because she has enough money to buy a bigger house, she doesn’t. SCP-DOTS is to be provided chocolate and chewy candy because she’s a cannibal

Would a Containment Specialist be messing around, writing themselves as an anomaly? She has things she could be doing. Plenty of actual anomaly files to finalize gave a slight call. The blueprints for an additional five humanoid containment cells at Site-27 were screaming pretty loud. Four standard, one non-standard. That blueprint seemed pretty proud of itself giving that it was bigger and pink instead of blue. Her supervisor seemed to agree considering the completion date of said pink blueprint was in two days. It’s not that she doesn't want to do it, that isn't the case at all. She loves her job. It is more exciting than most Foundation positions in her opinion. She likes to design, and anyone who took one look at her would be able to read that in multiple different ways.

> **Description:** SCP-DOTS is very girly. She is very put together. She likes to wear patterns and be fashionable. Many of her colleges ask if she was in school for fashion design. She was, at one point. Fashion was what she had wanted to do since 

She was a kid? No. That was who //someone// had wanted her to be, sure. What she wanted as a kid was to look at how things worked. Dots chuckles to herself as her thoughts play out in her head. She was the kid who would take the batteries out of the princess wand because she wanted to know //why// it worked like that. 'Candi April Dots' was a name the RoseWood Elementary School office staff knew all too well. Dots had been in there so many times, she could still put a name to each face. 

//"Ms Dots, would you like to explain why you kept taking the batteries out of all the classroom toys?"//

//"Ms Dots, would you like to explain why you wouldn't allow any of the boys to use the remote-control trucks?"//

Ah, that one was a special one. It was one thing when she was dismembering princess wands and talking pony toys. It was another when remote-control trucks and cars became her target. Dots pushed her chair back to allow access to the desk drawers. She opens the left most drawer, retrieving a small remote-control, and a hand-sized, half destroyed, poorly painted pink monster truck toy. She smiles, the nostalgia the toy brings feeling warm comfortable. It doesn't work anymore. Maybe it would if she would have just gave it some more thought. Maybe if she would have just stopped and gave chances. Maybe if she would have allowed for some help. Maybe then it wouldn't have been stolen. It wouldn't have been stolen and then

> sometimes? She likes cute stuff and pink stuff, but what she really wanted to do was big design. Like engineering. She can make some pretty impressive things, maybe that's her anomaly, hm?

Dots gives a sad laugh at her own writing, the small truck now in a tightly clutched fist. She releases the truck back into her desk drawer, and her knuckles from tightening pain. Dots uses her lab-coat sleeve to dry her eyes as she attempted to regain focus.

What is she //doing?// She has ideas. She has things she can do. Things she's started on. The blueprints for an additional five humanoid containment cells at Site-27 were screaming pretty loud. Four standard, one non-standard. That blueprint seemed pretty proud-- she's already said that. She'll probably say it again. But she can't remember. She puts her computer to the side, allowing room for paper documents to have their say. She pulls out one folder and hey, that one is almost done. She grabs a pencil, marks a few lines, and it's done. It was so simple. She was so close to completion on so many things yet...yet she wasn't. So many projects only require actively //doing// it. Just turn her brain on for a bit and it's done. But she can't do that, can she? For some reason, it is so difficult just to pull out a paper and be focused for ten minutes. Why is that so difficult? She loves this job. And she's said that before. She'll probably say it again.

Dots throws her head back in a laugh as she and some co-workers mess around with a new stock of anomalous objects in the Site-27 break-room. She's fine now.
