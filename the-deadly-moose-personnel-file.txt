**Object Class:** --Keter-- --Safe-- Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3500-M is to be contained within a level-3 ecological containment chamber, with foliage provided based on Nutrition Chart 3500-M-1.

**Description:** SCP-3500-M is a member of the species //Alces alces shirasi//, or the North American moose.

Dr. Tilda David Moose is not a real moose. She is, however, a real doctor.

Dr. Moose is the Site Director of Site-19. She is also the Acting Site Director of Site-17. She has inherited the positions from a string of previous Directors. It remains to be seen how long she will last in these positions.

Dr. Moose is a relative newcomer compared to others in administration. She possesses an outsized degree of influence given her length of tenure with the organization.

Psychological evaluation states that Dr. Moose is obsessive and prone to anxiety, and recommends a medication regimen.

Also Dr. Tilda D. Moose, Dr. Tilda David, etc.

------------------
**CLEARANCE 4/M REQUIRED FOR FOLLOWING SECTION** 

Dr. Moose is one of the Foundation's primary K-Class scenario researchers. She is notably associated with major incidents regarding [[[SCP-003]]], [[[SCP-1000]]], [[[SCP-1985]]], and [[[Serpent's Hand Hub|the Serpent's Hand.]]]

She has been closely associated with Agent Troy Lament on a number of classified projects, much to Lament's chagrin. Like Lament, she is a protege of Dr. Gears.

Considered possible future risk factor due to former association with the Serpent's Hand, and due to the stresses of her positions.
