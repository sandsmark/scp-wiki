**Item #:** SCP-3500-M

**Object Class:** --Keter-- --Safe-- Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3500-M is to be contained within a level-3 ecological containment chamber, with foliage provided based on Nutrition Chart 3500-M-1.

**Description:** SCP-3500-M is a member of the species //Alces alces shirasi//, or the North American moose. Although there do not appear to be any physical anomalies surrounding SCP-3500-M, it possesses the peculiar memetic effect of causing subjects who view it to believe it is highly dangerous. Further research is required into this phenomenon.

------------

Dr. Tilda David Moose is not a real moose. She is, however, a real doctor.

Dr. Moose is the Site Director of Site-19 (and co-Director of Site-17). She inherited the positions from a string of previous Directors. It remains to be seen how long she will last in these positions. Psychological evaluation states that Dr. Moose is obsessive and prone to anxiety, and recommends a medication regimen.

------------------

**CLEARANCE 4/M REQUIRED FOR FOLLOWING SECTION** 

[[collapsible show="Please enter credentials." hide="Welcome, Researcher."]]

Dr. Moose is one of the Foundation's primary K-Class scenario researchers. She is notably associated with major incidents regarding [[[SCP-003]]], [[[SCP-1000]]], [[[SCP-1985]]], and [[[Serpent's Hand Hub|the Serpent's Hand.]]]

She has worked closely with MTF Tau-9 ("Bookworms") and MTF Sigma-3 ("Bibliographers"), but is a member of neither. She has been closely associated with Agent Troy Lament on a number of classified projects, much to Lament's chagrin. Like Lament, she is an ex-protege of Dr. Gears. Considered possible risk factor due to former association with the Serpent's Hand, and due to the stresses of her positions.
