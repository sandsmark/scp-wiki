**Item #:** SCP-111

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**  All specimens of SCP-111 in captivity are housed at Site 19, ██████████ Wing, in a 50m x 50m x 50m plexiglass enclosure containing a temperate forest habitat transplanted from its natural surroundings. Habitat temperature will be maintained at 30° C. Feeding is to take place weekly by personal placing six (6) pounds of iceberg lettuce (Lactuca sativa) into the containment chamber. Water is to be supplied by an automatic misting system which regulates humidity levels at 50%. In event of SCP-111 specimens breeding, personal are to enter chamber, gather eggs and transport them to [DATA EXPUNGED] Biological Studies Wing for freezing.

**Description:** SCP-111 is an apparently artificial species of invertebrate vaguely resembling snails. Adult specimens of SCP-111 are approximately twenty (20) centimeters in length, twelve (12) centimeters in width, and fifteen (15) centimeters in height although exact size differs slightly between specimens. SCP-111 specimens differ from ordinary snails due to a warm-blooded metabolism, complex eyes, small "horns" consisting of cartilage-ridged tentacles, apparently increased intelligence (personal are requested to read Test Log ██████ for examples), a complex vertebrate-type jaw structure and the laying of eggs possessing hardened shells.

SCP-111 behavior is inconsistent with ordinary snail species, including whistling and hooting vocalizations easily audible to humans, high intellect seen in such tests as [DATA EXPUNGED] and care for young including infants imprinting on parents, other members of their own species or researchers. This is presumed to be a deliberate trait based on Document 111-a, as it would mean that infants sold would imprint upon owners.

**History:** On ██/██/████ a package containing twelve (12) SCP-111 eggs and Document 111-a was mailed to [DATA EXPUNGED] a foundation front organization. Mobile Task Force Alpha-4 have proven unable to locate the sender of said package.
