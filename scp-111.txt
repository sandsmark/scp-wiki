**Item #:** SCP-111

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**  All specimens of SCP-111 in captivity are housed at Site 19, ██████████ Wing, in a 5m x 5m x 5m plexiglass enclosure containing a temperate forest habitat transplanted from its natural surroundings. Habitat temperature will be maintained at 30° C. Feeding is to take place weekly by personnel placing six (6) pounds of iceberg lettuce (Lactuca sativa) into the containment chamber. Water is to be supplied by an automatic misting system which regulates humidity levels at 50% both for water required by SCP-111 and to prevent fires ignited by SCP-111. In event of SCP-111 specimens breeding, personnel are to enter chamber, gather eggs and transport them to [DATA EXPUNGED] Biological Studies Wing for freezing.

**Description:** SCP-111 is an apparently artificial species of invertebrate vaguely resembling snails. Adult specimens of SCP-111 are approximately twenty (20) centimeters in length, twelve (12) centimeters in width, and fifteen (15) centimeters in height, although exact size differs slightly between specimens. SCP-111 specimens differ from ordinary snails due to a warm-blooded metabolism, complex eyes, small "horns" consisting of cartilage-ridged tentacles, apparently increased intelligence (personnel are requested to read Test Log ██████ for examples), a complex vertebrate-type jaw structure and the laying of eggs possessing hardened shells. 

Most abnormally, SCP-111 specimens possess small hollow sacs below their lower jaws containing methane from digestive by-products. A series of [DATA EXPUNGED] along the inside of the trachea serves as a "lighter" igniting stored methane as the specimen exhales, blowing a small jet of flame from its mouth. Said "fire-breathing" generally occurs in event of stress or anger, although is not apparently used deliberately for destruction but rather as a warning. This is presumably due to limited size of methane sacs, rendering SCP-111 specimens limited in the amount of fire they can exhale at a time, and requiring both time and starch-rich food to refuel.

SCP-111's behavior is inconsistent with that of ordinary snail species, including whistling and hooting vocalizations easily audible to humans, high intellect seen in such tests as [DATA EXPUNGED], and parents caring for their young. Infants have been observed imprinting on their parents, other members of their own species, or researchers. This is presumed to be a deliberate trait based on Document 111-a, as it would mean that infants sold would imprint upon owners.

**History:** On ██/██/████ a package containing twelve (12) SCP-111 eggs and Document 111-a was mailed to [DATA EXPUNGED], a Foundation front organization. Mobile Task Force Alpha-4 have proven unable to locate the sender of said package.
