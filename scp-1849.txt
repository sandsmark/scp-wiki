**Item #:** SCP-1849

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1849 is to be contained in a standard indoor animal enclosure, with security cameras placed discreetly in the four corners of the ceiling. The enclosure floor should be standard concrete, covered with a layer of newsprint. Enclosure should be supplied with an assortment of sticks and branches every three days. Newsprint should be replaced daily, or more often if needed; all waste material is to be incinerated.

SCP-1849 should be given distilled water and fed a wide range of fruits. Any leftover fruit or vegetables must be removed from the enclosure after no more than three days. Personnel are not to bring food into SCP-1849’s enclosure that they do not intend to give to it.

Any personnel sympathizing with SCP-1849’s predicament are to be reassigned.

**Description:** SCP-1849 is a member of an unknown species of large bird, similar in morphology to both a parrot and emu, standing approximately 1.5 meters tall and weighing 55 kilograms. Subject appears to be female. SCP-1849 has three toes on each foot and uncharacteristically large wings that are unsuitable for flight, but which can be used like a hand to grasp objects loosely or gesticulate. Subject’s feathers are a shade of roan gray and cover its entire body, save for its neck and lower legs. Said feathers form a ‘ruff’ around SCP-1849’s neck and waist. Subject’s neck, body, wings, and legs are elongated and more reminiscent of a human’s features than a bird’s. However, its face is completely avian, possessing a long curving beak with a smaller lower jaw, wide-set bird-like eyes, and a sparse crest upon the top of its head. Subject stands bipedally with proper avian knees.

SCP-1849 possesses speech mimicry and mild telepathic abilities. These manifest as a constant, incessant ‘parroting’ of the thoughts it hears from people in its vicinity. SCP-1849 will parrot thoughts for as long as it is awake, except while eating. As is typical with birds, SCP-1849 can be induced to go to sleep by by darkening the lights in its enclosure.

When supplied with enough sticks and branches, SCP-1849 will build a nest approximately 2 meters in diameter and 0.5 meters in height. This will function as its bed.

SCP-1849 is mildly sapient, with an intelligence similar to a Kakapo parrot, but it is clearly aware of its surroundings. Subject has been observed making scratches on the walls of its enclosure, evidently a primitive method of keeping track of time. When not pacing back and forth, sitting in its nest, eating, or sleeping, SCP-1849 appears to count these marks out loud again and again, using Māori numerals; however, it cannot count past twenty.

SCP-1849 appears to form deep emotional bonds with humans (this is hypothesized to be the result of imprinting), and will regularly attempt to sexually present itself for human males. Such efforts may go as far as attempting to shred the human male's clothing. Subject does not fully comprehend its situation or identity and often tries to lure potential human mates into its nest. At this point in time, no tests of SCP-1849's reproductive capabilities are authorized.

SCP-1849 will eat nearly anything, but prefers fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as cooked and uncooked meats. Subject also likes alcohol, and will attempt to stockpile fruit for fermentation. 

On average once a month, SCP-1849 will lay an unfertilised egg, approximately 35 centimeters in length and 20 centimeters in mean diameter. These eggs are to be confiscated for research purposes.

**Addendum:** When secured by the Foundation during a series of noise complaints in the outskirts of W████████, New Zealand, SCP-1849 had an iron band wrapped around its left ankle, with writing in Māori that translated as “What would you do?”
