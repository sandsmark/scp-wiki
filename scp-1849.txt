**Item #:** SCP-1849

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1849 must be contained in a standard indoor animal enclosure. One wall should have a one-way mirror for observation. Security cameras must also be placed discreetly in the four corners of the ceiling. A small television screen should be set into the wall opposite the mirror, protected by safety glass. The enclosure floor should be standard concrete, covered with absorbent foam, covered with a layer of newspaper. Enclosure should be supplied with an assortment of sticks and branches every few days. Care should be taken when entering SCP-1849’s enclosure; all personnel must wear sound-blocking headphones equipped with radio links. Gas masks are optional but recommended. Eggs produced by SCP-1849 must be removed swiftly and sterilized by heat. SCP-1849 should be given distilled water and fed a wide range of fruits, both from its native habitat and elsewhere, with scraps of chicken as rewards for good behavior during testing. Personnel are not to bring food into SCP-1849’s enclosure that they do not intend to give to it. Any personnel sympathizing with SCP-1849’s predicament are to be reassigned.

**Description:** SCP-1849 is a member of an unknown species of large bird, similar in morphology to both a parrot and emu, standing approximately 1.5 meters tall and weighing 55 kilograms. Subject appears to be female. SCP-1849 has three toes on each foot and uncharacteristically large wings that, being unusable for flight, can be used like a hand to grasp objects loosely or gesticulate. Subject appears to have rudimentary opposable thumbs upon its wings. Subject’s feathers are a shade of roan gray and cover its entire body, save for its neck and lower legs. Said feathers form a ‘ruff’ around SCP-1849’s neck and waist. Subject’s neck, body, wings, and legs are elongated and more reminiscent of a human’s features than a bird’s. However, its face is completely avian, possessing a long curving beak with a smaller lower jaw, wide-set bird-like eyes, and a sparse crest upon the top of its head. Subject stands bipedally with proper avian knees.

SCP-1849 possesses speech mimicry and mild telepathic abilities. These manifest as a constant, incessant ‘parroting’ of the most immoral and socially unacceptable thoughts it hears from people in its vicinity. What qualifies as socially unacceptable appears to depend on the person being read. Typical topics include bestiality, pedophilia, rape, [DATA EXPUNGED], and murder. SCP-1849 will parrot thoughts for as long as it is awake. Subject can be fooled into thinking it is night-time by darkening the lights in its enclosure, and will go to sleep. This can be used as a way to placate it. When supplied with enough sticks and branches, SCP-1849 will build a nest approximately 2 meters in diameter and 0.5 meters in height. This will function as its bed.

SCP-1849 is nonsapient, only having an intelligence similar to a Kakapo parrot, but it is clearly aware of its surroundings. Subject has been observed making scratches on the walls of its enclosure, evidently a primitive method of keeping track of time. When not pacing back and forth, sitting in its nest, eating, or sleeping, SCP-1849 appears to count these marks again and again, using Māori numerals. Subject also appears to ‘read’ the newspaper lining its enclosure, but more often than not it is simply staring at the pictures. Subject likes to watch Animal Planet reruns on the television provided, but nothing of a graphic nature can be shown. It appears to especially enjoy jungle life documentaries.

SCP-1849 will eat nearly anything, but prefers fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as cooked and uncooked meats. Subject also likes alcoholic beverages, and becomes drunk very quickly. Subject must not be allowed to consume alcohol, for its telepathic ability becomes slightly more intense.

On average once a month, SCP-1849 will lay an egg, approximately 35 centimeters in length and 20 centimeters in mean diameter. These eggs must be confiscated immediately before they hatch. Autopsies of the eggs have revealed that SCP-1849 reproduces parthenogenetically. Eggs must be sterilized by heat. When an egg is confiscated, SCP-1849 will wail about abortion, eugenics, et cetera, and must be ignored.

SCP-1849 regularly produces an amount of guano consistent with a bird of its size. Its enclosure must be cleaned and the newspaper replaced once every 24 hours. Guano must be incinerated.

**Addendum:** When secured by the Foundation during a series of noise complaints in the outskirts of W████████, New Zealand, SCP-1849 had an iron band wrapped around its left ankle, with writing in Māori that simply translated as “What would you do?”
