**Item #:** SCP-412

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**
SCP-412 is currently contained within Storage Unit-11 at Site-19; removal of the item requires authorization by no less then three (3) personnel with Level-3 clearance, and may be vetoed by Site Security. Gloves should be worn when handling SCP-412 and the item should be transported in an opaque container.

Staff interaction must be carried out with full observance of Hazmat Protocol 7-R. Any and all staff making physical contact with, or direct observation of SCP-412 will submit to a full physical examination. Anyone found to exhibit physical alteration will be remanded immediately to quarantine.

**Description:**
SCP-412 is an antique silver hand mirror measuring 18 cm by 7 cm. The mirror has a 4 cm crack in the top left hand corner, and has a etched motif of roses and vines. Around ██% of subjects within direct line of sight of SCP-412 report a compulsion to pick up the item and view their reflection in it. There does not appear to be a discernible pattern to the "selections" - testing for possible genetic, mental, or other selection markers is ongoing.

Simultaneous observation and contact with SCP-412 causes the item to 'connect' with the subject, regardless of whether they have been coerced into doing so by SCP-412. Tests using restrained subjects have shown that both actions (touching and viewing the reflection) are necessary for a connection to be made. No means of 'severing' this connection have been found, short of complete isolation for a period no less then two years. 

Connected subjects are compelled to repeatedly view their reflection in SCP-412, initially only once or twice a day. Viewing frequency increases over a period of several weeks. By around day 55, the amount of time subjects spend viewing their reflection typically begins to exceed all other activities, including sleep.

Each viewing causes biological alterations to the subject, beginning with minor physiological changes such as enlarged lymph nodes, facial rash, or skin discoloration. Although the exact pattern differs between subjects, by day 90 almost all subjects show: downward extension of the ribcage, fixed open jaw by way of large cysts toward the rear of the mouth and severely compromised reproductive and immune systems. Subjects also show a continual loss of memory recall ability and emotional response; fMRI scans have shown a marked decrease in activity in subjects' amygdalae and parietal lobes.

Subjects in advanced stages of alteration (in excess of ███ days) begin to exhibit marked changes in behavior, and more drastic physical alterations. These include: degradation of speech facilities, total atrophy of all muscle below the waist, hypersensitivity to light and sound, increased mucus production and alterations in [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Addendum 412-1:** Circumstances of retrieval.
SCP-412 came to the attention of the Foundation following five unexplained deaths in ████████████, ██ matching the pattern described above. Three of the deceased owned a hand mirror of a similar age (the design varied considerably); only one mirror had reasonably intact glass. Once it had been established that the mirror was responsible for the mutations, it was taken into Foundation custody. The remains of the other two mirrors showed no unusual properties and were disposed of.

Testing and observation has led researchers to theorize that SCP-412 is not the mirror itself, but is in fact a outside force that 'anchors' to mirrors. This theory is unproven, but any mirrors suspected of exhibiting similar behaviour must be acquired and contained.

**Addendum 412-2:** Mutation/alteration theory.
Recorded audio and text documents recovered from the initial recovery site have led to the theory that SCP-412 may not be a focus of random alterations, but is in fact a guided effect. Interviews have reinforced this theory and shown that subjects have an obsession with an 'other', for whom they are being made 'ready'. When pushed for further details, subjects report [DATA EXPUNGED].

These behaviors, coupled with some of the more drastic physical changes, have led researchers to [DATA EXPUNGED] 'container', similar to a pressure suit used for deep-sea diving. Autopsies on extensively altered subjects have shown that their chest cavity could theoretically [DATA EXPUNGED].
