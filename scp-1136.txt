**Item #:** SCP-1136

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1136 is contained in a 1m x 1m x 0.5m terrarium secured within an isolated, soundproof 4m x 4m x 2.5m chamber at Site ██. All fixtures within SCP-1136's containment must be bolted down or otherwise secured against shifting during a localized directional event. Experimentation with SCP-1136 requires prior permission from at least two (2) Level 3 personnel, and personnel within SCP-1136's containment area must wear magnetized boots or otherwise be secured against possible shifting.

**Description:** SCP-1136 is a single specimen of //Hemidactylus frenatus//, or common house gecko, that is physically indistinguishable from others of its species. So far, attempts at breeding SCP-1136 have been successful, though offspring do not exhibit its anomalous property. SCP-1136 was discovered in 19██, and has far exceeded its expected lifespan with no sign of age-related illness or ailment to date.

When SCP-1136 is startled or frightened, it causes gravity within a radius of approximately 8 m to align itself with its orientation, without affecting SCP-1136 itself. This occurs instantaneously and without any measurable change in the physiology of SCP-1136 other than that which is normal for a surprise response for a normal //Hemidactylus// specimen. This effect continues as long as SCP-1136 remains frightened, and the direction of the gravity shift will change according to its current orientation.

SCP-1136 was discovered on ██/█/19██ following anomalous reports at a local hospital in [DATA EXPUNGED], wherein several children were admitted with minor injuries and limb fractures after reportedly chasing a gecko up the wall of their classroom. Amnesiacs were administered to all affected civilians, and after some difficulty, SCP-1136 was located and retrieved from the school.

**Addendum 1136-01:** Incident Log 1136-012

On ██/██/██, Dr. █████ accidentally dropped a clipboard while within SCP-1136's enclosure, startling it and causing it to run up the wall of its terrarium. During the subsequent gravity shift, Dr. █████ was thrown against a nearby wall, which further startled SCP-1136 and resulted in a cyclical gravity shift that continued for several minutes. Dr. █████ was finally removed and treated for multiple bone fractures and a severe concussion.
