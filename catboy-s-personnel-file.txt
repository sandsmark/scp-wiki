title:Catboy's Personnel File
**Name:** Edward "Catboy" Jones

**Security Clearance:** Level 3

**Position(s):** Researcher, --Minister--

//While technically a minister within the "World Union Church", Researcher Jones is not qualified to perform any religious ceremonies, including baptisms, last rites, and confession.  Personnel are allowed to attend "worship" at their own risk.//

**Location:** Site 37

**Information:** Edward "Catboy" Jones is employed by the Foundation as a researcher.  He was recruited from ████████ University in 20██ after his graduation, and promptly fired due to Incident 15673-A (see below).  After --grovelling like a little bitch-- a formal apology, he was rehired as a Level 3 Researcher.  

Over the course of his employment, Researcher Jones has shown an extreme interest, bordering on an obsession, with religious matters.  Though he has never expressed actual religious views, he has challenged many personnel on their beliefs, occasionally resulting in violent altercations.  Staff members are to avoid discussing any maters related to theology, theodicy, or holy scriptures within earshot of Researcher Jones.

Researcher Jones is generally referred to as "Catboy", though the origin of the name is unknown.  There are many theories among the staff, several of which have prompted a ban on interactions between Researcher Jones and [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/system:page-tags/tag/feline#pages|any feline SCPs]]].  

//None of those are true!  How would I even do that with a toilet paper tube? -Researcher Jones// 

**Incident 15673-A:** On 20██/11/21, Researcher Jones began a religious debate with Agent █████, a devout Catholic, and Doctor ██████, a Shia Muslim, on the nature of omnipotence.  The debate became heated, and eventually spread to two-hundred-thirty-five staff members at Site ██.  The resulting chaos ended in thirty-six deaths, seventy-one wounded, and the containment breach of █ SCPs.  

Researcher Jones was strictly reprimanded and removed from his post.  After three days, he was reinstated after a formal apology and signed a written contract forbidding him from discussing religion outside of situations approved by --two-- three Level 4 researchers.
