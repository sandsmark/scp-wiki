SCP-1339 was my first addition to the site, and it was admittedly posted with very little feedback.  It was originally incredibly melodramatic, and basically hovered around +10 for a few days while I rewrote it.  I learned not to use watermarked images and to take criticism.

SCP-1625 started as a story that was told differently every time, and it basically stayed just like that until I got some feedback.  The idea of having a reappearing corpse and missing persons was only added right before I posted.  

SCP-1419 probably required the most research I've ever done for anything.  I'm fascinated by the Aztec and Maya religions, and I decided to try my hand at creating my own religions.  Each of the examples has a backstory in my head, and I'm still considering using them in a tale or something.

Lessons from History is entirely inaccurate and obvious, and is my lowest rated article as of time of writing.  

If anybody ever tells you I wrote a 682-1548 rap battle, they are a liar and a bad person.
