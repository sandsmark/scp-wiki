Despite him saying it like an ass, gene has a point. @##orange|**TwixFoley**## this isn't really the best place to get helpful advice for that kind of issue. I'm going to lock this thread, I hope you find your answers elsewhere.

So someone could just push a button from anywhere in the world and make my PC do something? That sounds a lot like malware.

I'm not. I used to work electronics, that was the kind of stuff we used for sending/receiving remote signals, although that was only for smaller stuff like TV remotes and garage door openers. No idea why'd they'd stick something like that in a PC.

@##green|**geneTherapist**## No, it wouldn't send over anything besides a simple signal, it would pretty much just tell the computer to "do something". It's the same logic they use for detonating C4 and shit, although it's not like they could do that to a PC
