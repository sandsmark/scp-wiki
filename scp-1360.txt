**Item #:** SCP-1360

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1360-1 is to be contained in a humanoid containment cell at Site 19. The presence of --one-- two Level 3 security personnel is required prior to entry. Dr. Johnson must be notified prior to the collection of any samples of SCP-1360-2. A restraint table is required for any SCP-1360-2 collection procedures. 

**Description:** SCP-1360-1 is an animate fully jointed genderless mannequin with an aluminum frame. The subject stands at 1.83 m tall and weighs 100 kg. The eyes are represented by two white circles, approximately 3 cm in diameter. The subject’s body is comprised of plastic casings covered in a fabric of unknown composition referred to as SCP-1360-2. This covering acts like a skin and has a universal depth of 1 cm. The serial number 031 is sewn into the fabric of the subject’s left arm in a red variant of SCP-1360-2.

Testing to identify SCP-1360-2 has so far been met with limited success. The material is a type of aramid fiber with a tensile strength of approximately 4000 MPa, and a specific gravity of 1.1 making it both lighter and stronger than Kevlar. The material is also self-repairing, with adjacent SCP-1360-2 fibers reweaving and fusing back together until all damaged material is one solid piece. Substantial damage to SCP-1360-1’s body is able to be completely repaired when SCP-1360-2 fibers fuse over damaged areas. The process can be greatly accelerated by covering the damaged area with patches of SCP-1360-2. It is hypothesized that damaged areas repair in a similar manner to SCP-1360-2. All samples of SCP-1360-2 disintegrate after 48 hours of separation from SCP-1360-1.

SCP-1360-1’s fingers contain a series of tools. These tools are accessed by unscrewing the tip of the finger and include:
* A steel needle attached to a roll of red SCP-1360-2 thread. (Left thumb)
* A roll of SCP-1360-2 patches: 5.1 cm wide. (Left index)
* A pair of steel fabric scissors. (Right thumb)
* A steel scalpel (Right index)

The subject is intelligent and displays a clear knowledge of hand to hand combat and firearms use. The subject is obsessed with its release and subsequent return to an individual or group it refers to as “Anderson.” 

SCP-1360-1 claims to feel pain despite its apparent lack of a nervous system. As a result, the subject views itself as incomplete and makes efforts to escape in order to locate what it calls its “final component.” Current hypothesis holds that the pain the subject perceives is in reality a form of sensory feedback, which the subject understands as pain, correlating with the missing component. Request for extensive testing of this sensory system is currently under review.

Despite the subject being incapable of speech, it contains an apparent understanding of the English language and is able to read and write. Interviews have been moderately successful, thought the subject’s release and repair are favorite topics of conversation.

**Addendum: 1360-A:** Due to the initial escape attempt by SCP-1360-1, the subject is to be fully restrained by one additional security personnel in addition to the use of a restraint table. This additional security is required prior to opening the containment cell for SCP-1360-2 collection. (See Incident-1360-1)

**Addendum: 1360-B:** 
[[collapsible show="+ Interview Log 1360-01" hide="- Close Log"]]
> **Interviewed:** SCP-1360-1
>  
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Johnson
>  
> **Foreword:** This interview was done following the initial escape attempt by SCP-1360-1  which resulted in 14 personnel casualties (See Incident-1360-1). The subject’s responses were presented to a research assistant in written form and then read aloud to Dr. Johnson.
>  
> **<Begin Log>**
>  
> **Dr. Johnson:** Hello 1360-1, I’m here to talk to you about your recent escape attempt. 
>  
> **1360-1:** What do you want?
>  
> **Dr. Johnson:** I want to know what you want.
>  
> **1360-1:** I want completion. 
>  
> **Dr. Johnson:** And how would you be completed?
>  
> **1360-1:** I feel pain. That means that I am incomplete and unsuitable to serve a client. I must see Anderson for the missing component and reassignment.
>  
> **Dr. Johnson:** You refer to Anderson a fair amount. Are they you’re creator?
> 
> **1360-1:** Yes.
>  
> **Dr. Johnson:** Can you tell me more about them?
>  
> **1360-1:** No.
> 
> **Dr. Johnson:** And why not?
> 
> **1360-1:** Anderson forbids me from revealing any information that may endanger the operation.
> 
> **Dr. Johnson:** It must be quite an operation to produce machines like yourself.
>  
> **1360-1:** I am not a machine.
>  
> **Dr. Johnson:** If you are not a machine then what are you?
>  
> **1360-1:** Whatever the client wants me to be. However, I am capable of thought. That means I am not a machine. 
>  
> **Dr. Johnson:** I see. Perhaps you could answer this question then, the number 31 sewn into your left arm, is that a serial number?
> 
> **1360-1:** Yes.
>  
> **Dr. Johnson:** Then that must mean there are quite a few of you out there. Could you tell me how many?
>  
> **1360-1:** Anderson has forbidden me from revealing that information.
>  
> **Dr. Johnson:** Damn. Perhaps we could move in another direction then. You also frequently refer to your clients. What is it you do for them?
>  
> **1360-1:** Whatever task they assign me.
>   
> **Dr. Johnson:** Could you provide me any examples? What did your last client have you do?
>  
> **1360-1:** I was assigned to protect her. I have failed that assignment and must now be reassigned.
> 
> **Dr. Johnson:** I take it that it was during this failure that you became damaged and lost your final component.
>  
> **1360-1:** Yes. It was removed by my client’s father when I failed. That is why I need to be repaired. If I am compromised my assigned functions will also be compromised. You don’t understand. As a human you are not born with an objective. You are not given a higher goal that must be completed. I was, however. If I am given order that I cannot fulfill, then I am useless.
>  
> **Dr. Johnson:** So if you were released, you could find Anderson? You would know where he was? 
>  
> **1360-1:** Yes. Upon a client’s dismissal we are to return for reassignment. We are always aware of where we are to return to. 
> 
> **Dr. Johnson:** If you tell us where your return point is, Anderson could be brought to you. We can make arrangements 1360-1.
>  
> **1360-1:** Anderson has forbidden me from revealing the location of any return point.
>   
> **Dr. Johnson:** Of course. You are aware then that there is no other way for us to allow your repair.
>  
> **1360-1:** Yes. I am prepared to remove this obstruction if I must. 
>  
> **<End Log>**
>  
> **Closing Statement:** 1360-1 refused further communication at this point and was then returned to its containment cell.

**Addendum: 1360-C:** It is recommended that the collection of SCP-1360-2 be postponed until methods for increasing the material's lifespan are ready for testing.
(O5-██: Denied)

//- Provided that damage to the subject is kept to a minimum level during collection, SCP-1360-2 will continue to be gathered according to the current testing schedule. While the limited lifespan of SCP-1360-2 samples is a setback, there is no need to fully halt testing as a result. All damage done to SCP-1360-1 eventually does self-repair.// -O5-██
