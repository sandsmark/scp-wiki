**Item #:** SCP-1360

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1360-1 is to be contained in a humanoid containment cell at Site 19. The presence of --one-- two Level 3 security personnel is required prior to entry. Dr. Johnson must be notified prior to the collection of any samples of SCP-1360-2. A restraint table is required for any SCP-1360-2 collection procedures. 

**Description:** SCP-1360-1 is an animate fully jointed genderless mannequin with an aluminum frame. The subject stands at 1.83 m tall and weighs 100 kg. The eyes are represented by two white circles, approximately 3 cm in diameter. The subject’s body is comprised of plastic casings covered in a fabric of unknown composition referred to as SCP-1360-2. This covering acts like a skin and has a universal depth of 1 cm. The serial number 031 is sewn into the fabric of the subject’s left arm in a red variant of SCP-1360-2.

Testing to identify SCP-1360-2 has so far been met with limited success. The material is a type of aramid fiber with a tensile strength of approximately 4000 MPa, and a specific gravity of 1.1. The material is also self-repairing, with adjacent SCP-1360-2 fibers reweaving and fusing back together until all damaged material is one solid piece. Substantial damage to SCP-1360-1’s body is able to be completely repaired when SCP-1360-2 fibers fuse over damaged areas. The process can be greatly accelerated by covering the damaged area with patches of SCP-1360-2, it is hypothesized that damaged areas repair in a similar manner to SCP-1360-2. All samples of SCP-1360-2 disintegrate after 48 hours of separation from SCP-1360-1.

SCP-1360-1’s fingers contain a series of tools. These tools are accessed by unscrewing the tip of the finger and include:
* A steel needle attached to a roll of red SCP-1360-2 thread. (Left thumb)
* A roll of SCP-1360-2 patches: 5.1 cm wide. (Left index)
* A pair of steel fabric scissors. (Right thumb)
* A steel scalpel (Right index)

The subject is intelligent and displays a clear knowledge of hand to hand combat and firearms use. The subject is obsessed with its release and subsequent return to an individual or group it refers to as “Anderson.” Due to the subject’s ability to feel pain despite the lack of an apparent nervous system, SCP-1360-1 views itself as an incomplete model in need of repair and seeks escape to obtain what it calls its “final component.” This desire to escape makes the subject actively hostile to Foundation personnel. 

Despite the subject being incapable of speech, it contains an apparent understanding of the English language and is able to read and write. Interviews have had limited success, with the subject only caring to discuss its release and repair. 

**Addendum: 1360-A:** Due to the initial escape attempt by SCP-1360-1, the subject is to be fully restrained by one additional security personnel in addition to the use of a restraint table. This additional security is required prior to opening the containment cell for SCP-1360-2 collection. (See Incident-1360-1)

**Addendum: 1360-B:** 
[[collapsible show="+ Interview Log 1360-01" hide="- Close Log"]]
> **Interviewed:** SCP-1360-1
>  
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Johnson
>  
> **Foreword:** This interview was done following the initial escape attempt by SCP-1360-1  which resulted in █ personnel casualties (See Incident-1360-1). The subject’s responses were presented to Dr. Johnson in written form.
>  
> **<Begin Log>**
>  
> **Dr. Johnson:** Hello 1360-1, I’m here to talk to your recent escape attempt. 
>  
> **SCP-1360-1:** What do you want?
>  
> **Dr. Johnson:** I want to know what you want.
>  
> **SCP-1360-1:** I want completion. 
>  
> **Dr. Johnson:** And how would you be completed?
>  
> **SCP-1360-1:** I feel pain. That means that I am incomplete and unsuitable to serve a client. I must see Anderson for the missing component and reassignment.
>  
> **Dr. Johnson:** Anderson? Who is Anderson?
> 
> **SCP-1360-1:** Anderson has the final component.
>  
> **Dr. Johnson:** Where are they?
>  
> **SCP-1360-1:** I can’t tell you. Anderson is always on the move. There is much to complete and orders to give. Many of us needed to be assigned and reassigned. That is why you need to let me go.
> 
> **Dr. Johnson:** You keep referring to reassignment. What does that entail?
> 
> **SCP-1360-1:** I am given a new client to serve. That is why I need completion. If I feel pain I am compromised. If I am compromised I am weak. If I am weak I cannot protect my client. I cannot follow orders to the fullest extent.
> 
> **Dr. Johnson:** What do these clients have you do? What do you protect them from?
> 
> **SCP-1360-1:** I do anything my client asks. I protect them from anything they deem a threat. That is my purpose. That is why you must let me go. I must be completed. I must be reassigned.
>  
> **Dr. Johnson:** We can’t do that 1360, but if you let us know where Anderson is, they can be brought to you.
>  
> **SCP-1360-1:** I can’t do that. Please let me go.
>  
> **Dr. Johnson:** We can’t do that 1360. 
>  
> **SCP-1360-1:** Let me go.
>   
> **Dr. Johnson:** We can’t.
>  
> **SCP-1360-1:** I have nothing left to say.
> 
> **<End Log>**
>  
> **Closing Statement:** SCP-1360-1 refused further communication at this point and was then returned to its containment cell.

**Addendum: 1360-C:** It is recommended that the collection of SCP-1360-2 be postponed until methods for increasing the material's lifespan are ready for testing.
(O5-██: Denied)

//- Provided that damage to the subject is kept to a minimum level during collection, SCP-1360-2 will continue to be gathered according to the current testing schedule. While the limited lifespan of SCP-1360-2 samples is a setback, there is no need to fully halt testing as a result. All damage done to SCP-1360-1 eventually does self-repair.// -O5-██
