**Item #:** SCP-420

**Object Class:** Safe (Exception: See Special Containment Procedures)

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-420 is to be contained in storage locker 1014-420 at Site ██. Level 3 clearance is required to remove it from storage. Samples of SCP-420-1 not in use for testing should be stored in the beaker marked "SCP-420-1 for decontamination" in locker 1014-420 until they lose potency, at which time they can be disposed of with biohazardous liquid waste. Please make note of the time and date in the attached log when you add samples of SCP-420-1 to the decontamination beaker.

Condition SCP-420-2 infectees are non-contagious, and should be contained in standard solitary D-class secure confinement. On reaching phase 4, infectees' rations should be doubled. Phase 5 infectees should be kept under constant surveillance for signs of advancement to phase 7, in which case the infected must be destroyed by high-temperature incineration unless permission to contain the phase 7 infectee has been granted by a level 4 supervisor. Phase 7 infectees should be stored in a high-security containment cell guarded by no fewer than two (2) security operatives equipped with flame-based weaponry, and fed five times the standard ration for a D-class personnel. Phase 7 infectees should be treated as Keter-class items.

**Description:** SCP-420 is a dirty bottle of [REDACTED]-brand whiskey with no lid; when emptied, a small amount of whiskey-like liquid (SCP-420-1) always remains in the bottle, appearing as liquid adhering to the sides. This liquid pools back into a few milliliters of SCP-420-1 over time. Drinking SCP-420-1 will cause Condition SCP-420-2, a nonfatal but consuming degeneration and mutation of keratin and skin in the infected. Although extremely unpleasant, SCP-420-2 is only harmful to the infected. Cases of SCP-420-2 should be contained for further study. Early cases can be treated (see Treatment, below).

SCP-420 cannot be washed out; additional liquid added in simply turns into more SCP-420-1. When poured out, the SCP-420-1 retains its properties for up to 48 hours. Chemical analysis shows no anomalies in SCP-420-1 before or after loss of potency: it is identical to [REDACTED] brand whiskey when potent, and has all the same effects in addition to causing SCP-420-2. Oddly enough, when it loses its potency, the chemical structure changes to that of concentrated urine. Urinalysis of aged SCP-420-1 shows that it belongs to a human male, approximate age 50, with severe liver degeneration. Further analysis using [DATA EXPUNGED] shows that the urine contains trace quantities of [DATA EXPUNGED] consistent with infection by SCP-███. No explanation has been provided for this cross-contamination.

SCP-420-2's infection progress varies somewhat from patient to patient, but can usually be described in several phases. Detailed descriptions for therapeutic purposes can be found in Medical Document 420a-4 (attached). Brief descriptions for containment purposes follow:

* //Phase 1//: Immediately to 12 hours after consuming SCP-420-1. The infected's mouth becomes dry and swollen, making speech difficult. Speech becomes slurred and mumbling. Researchers are advised to note that this slurred speech is __not__ consistent with alcohol intoxication. Recording 420-c-004 (attached) contains a comparison of speech patterns of subject D-30915 pre-infection while sober and intoxicated, and post-infection.

* //Phase 2//: Typically within 24 hours of consuming SCP-420-1. Infected's finger- and toenails become extremely brittle, cracking up the finger and bleeding. Fingernail growth is at the same time accelerated, with lost tissue replacing itself. Ingrown nails are an inevitability; infection of these ingrown nails and open sores is consistent with similar damage from a more mundane source.

* //Phase 3//: 1-2 weeks after phase 2. Infected's hair and skin become brittle and dry. Like the finger and toenails, growth is also accelerated, so while skin and hair slough and crack off, they are quickly replaced with newly grown material. Genetic analysis of keratinocytes shows mutations similar to skin cancer, including partial loss of contact inhibition, accelerated telomerase activity, and immortalisation of replicating cells. The tissue undergoes additional vascularisation similar to cancer cell metastasis, but not to the same degree of invasiveness. Though apparently cancerous these cells have not shown any tendency for detachment resulting in systemic spread. Thus, phase 3 is not malignant: even if phase 3 keratinocytes are injected into the blood, they will reattach to the skin layer or die[[footnote]]Research is underway as to why these cells, though phenotypically cancerous, remain nonmalignant. Those with appropriate qualifications who are interested in joining this project should contact me. --Dr. Ersen[[/footnote]]. Gradually, the skin becomes heavier, falling off the subject in brittle, cracking folds. Pieces up to 500 grams in size have been observed to crack off, leaving open, bleeding wounds. Innervation of the site is fully functional: this phase is presumed to be very painful. Growth of the skin folds inside the infectee's mouth prevent communication, although growth always progresses in such a way that the infected can still breath and eat. Infectees' appetites appear to be slightly above pre-infection levels, but notable is a complete disregard for what they are eating, likely due to degradation of sight and taste receptors. Only one post-phase 3 infected has been observed outside laboratory conditions (see Recovery Log 420, below); the majority of SCP-420-2 infectees die due to malnutrition/food poisoning, infection of open wounds, or alcohol poisoning from overconsumption of SCP-420-1 in this or earlier phases.

* //Phase 4//: 3-6 weeks after phase 3. The infected loses innervation of the skin and other keratinous surfaces due to severance of connections to the nerves. Nerves in the skin layer begin to grow uncontrollably, but no longer send signals back to the central nervous system. Genetic analysis of skin samples from this time show mutations in keratinocytes so severe as to no longer resemble human DNA. This mutation level is loosely consistent with extremely old cancerous cell lines; however, such advanced-stage genetic mutation would normally take much longer. Further, though individual samples suggest the mutations are random, analysis of samples from different infectees shows a consistent mutational path leading to a final genotype with relatively little variation. In other words, the skin of the infected is a different organism entirely, possibly a different species, related only to other infectees' skin. At this stage, 'tumours' may form inside the skin layer, these tumours exhibiting differentiation analogous (although structurally dissimilar) to several types of tissue, including muscle and secretory cells. Also at this stage, the skin slows its cracking and falling apart, although it never stops entirely. It becomes a thick series of leathery folds with exposed, bloody tissue beneath. Fingernails and hair grow out from the skin at apparently random locations.

* //Phase 5//: 3-7 days after phase 4. The skin begins to twitch and writhe on its own, in apparently random patterns. Differentiated tumours extend further, into whole surfaces of contractile and other tissues. Small 'throats' begin to form leading from the outside of the skin to the circulation of the host, but are mainly vestigial at this point: the host's mouth still does most of the eating. The host itself doesn't appear to be eating now, the mouth is working on its own: CAT scans of the host's brain activity show panic and fear as the only dominant thoughts, and motor groups in the jaw muscle area are not recruited. Rather, chewing and swallowing is forced by the motions of the mutated skin.

* //Phase 6//: 1-2 days after phase 5. Phase 5 and 6 may overlap significantly, with different portions of the skin entering phase 6 faster than others. The twitching/writhing skin activity gives way to organised motion. The skin can now be considered a separate organism from the host; it moves the body like a puppet (albeit slowly), and exhibits intelligence on the level of a roundworm. It is a scavenger organism and opportunistic predator, much more robust in what it can eat than the host was. The skin digests food by excreting a clear enzymaceous fluid onto proposed food, leaving it to digest (and in the process sterilise: the digestive fluid has been shown to kill almost all microorganisms), and then folding the food into itself. Ingested food is taken into folds in the skin, which are lined with thick, heavy, toothlike hairs leading down into the 'throat' that began growing in phase 5; the folds serve to hide these mouths from public view, and even at this stage an infected may pass for a vagrant at a very cursory inspection. Inside the mouth, a grinding net of keratinous toothlike plates break down food, which is then filtered by several membranous layers and absorbed into the host's blood.

* //Phase 7//: Most infected remain at phase 6 indefinitely; the trigger which causes a shift into phase 7 is unknown. The skin begins rapidly growing hair and keratinous "teeth", increasing in mass, and [DATA EXPUNGED]. Infected patients who appear to be entering phase 7 should be destroyed immediately by total incineration. Permission to contain a phase 7 infected for experimentation may only be granted by level 4 personnel. See Special Containment Procedures, above.

**Treatment**: SCP-420-2 can be treated pre-phase 2 by aggressive radiation therapy and chemotherapy, coupled with the constant intravenous administration of formula 420-a09t-t174b (see Document 420-a09t-t174b for pharmaceutical and chemical properties and therapy description). This treatment has a 73% success rate (full removal of SCP-420-2) and 21% fatality. From phase 3 onward, constant administration of 420-a09t-t174b will slow the progression of the SCP by two to tenfold, but rarely removes it entirely (success rate of full removal of SCP-420-2 drops by about 25% per day after the skin shows signs of affectation). Additionally, 420-a09t-t174b appears to be at least part of the trigger to entering phase 7: 420-a09t-t174b treatment should be halted in phase 6.

**Recovery Log 420**: SCP-420 was found in the possession of an unidentified vagrant in ████ ████████, United Kingdom. Agents had been sent to investigate reports of a "bridge troll", which was revealed to be the aforementioned vagrant in phase 6 of SCP-420-2. The vagrant's skin appeared to be using SCP-420 to create and drink SCP-420-1 constantly through its mouths, although its primary sustenance came via local pets and [REDACTED]. The vagrant was collected and designated SCP-420-a. SCP-420-a perished during experimentation[[footnote]]Dr. Ersen has requested a small plaque be placed on the storage locker for SCP-420, reading "In memory of the unknown victim." The request is under review.[[/footnote]].
