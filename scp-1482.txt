**Item #:** SCP-1482

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Site-178 has been built around SCP-1482, with the cover story that the Site is a retirement home for elderly individuals affected by dementia maintained. A chain-link fence around the perimeter with CCTV monitoring is to be maintained.  Any unauthorised individuals attempting to access Site-178 are to be detained, interviewed and – if they present no clear threat – released after being provided with a Class-C amnesiac.

**Description:** SCP-1481 is a residential building located in ██████, Shetland, UK.

SCP-1481 appears to be composed entirely of over four-hundred (400) separate parts (collectively referred to as SCP-1481-1) attached together with string, rope, glue and conventional staples. These objects include: metallic objects such as knives, forks and sheet metal; wooden furniture; living, healthy and in some cases, partially vivisected specimens of //Bos primigenius// (domestic cattle), //Salmo salar// (Atlantic salmon), //Giraffa camelopardalis// (giraffe) and //Orcinus orca// (killer whale), as well as various members of the Orders Anura (frog) and Lophiiformes (angler fish). The living components of SCP-1481 have been determined to constitute under fifty (50) of its parts, the rest consisting of non-living and artificial objects. These living specimens do not appear to require sustenance or excrete waste.

At three (3) known locations on SCP-1481, organs resembling human vocal cords are attached directly to an animal instance of SCP-1481-1 with staples; these vocal cords are identified as SCP-1481-2. Periodically, SCP-1481-2 will produce intelligible vocalisations in heavily slurred Scots English. The content of these vocalisations vary, but will invariably be told from the perspective of SCP-1482, and will typically involve one of the following:

* Complaints of being unable to see or hear, often with the mention that SCP-1482 can feel and smell in detail.

* Complaints of the interior of SCP-1482 feeling “cold”, “cald”, or in some cases, “baltic”.

* Requests that a non-specific listener enter SCP-1482 to warm it up, provide company

* Attempts to convince residents of SCP-1482 to stay indefinitely, make extended contact with the organic parts of SCP-1482 to confirm their presence, and protect the structure.

* Requests that individuals exiting SCP-1482 cease doing so. Exclamations of this nature tend to be shouted or yelled with increasing urgency.

* Screaming, distorted sounds of distress and assertions that if an individual who has recently exited SCP-1482 does not re-enter, “the bad men” or “madmen” are "gonnae come and have an empty[[footnote]]A term in Scots slang referring to youths hosting a party in their place of residence while their parents, carers or guardians are temporarily absent.[[/footnote]]”.

SCP-1482 was recovered from the custody of Group of Interest 3BA-Alpha-C (“The Chaos Insurgency”), following apparent attempts to manipulate SCP-1482’s anomalous properties as a means of longevity and inducing non-reliance on nutrition in humans. Since the organisation had at that point largely abandoned projects involving SCP-1482, the Foundation's attempts at removing SCP-1482 from the CI resulted in only two (2) casualties, and no fatalities.

Analyses of files recovered from the CI have revealed limited information regarding SCP-1482. From these documents and testimony of witnesses, it has been determined that SCP-1482 was the former residence of █████ ████████, noted zoology enthusiast, and that the vocal apparatus of the residence at one point provided information on various animal species. Ms. ████████ has not been located since.

Furthermore, investigation has shown that, prior to CI involvement, the structure consisted entirely of over four-hundred (400) living animal parts.
