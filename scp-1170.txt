**Item #:** SCP-1170

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the incorporeal nature of SCP-1170-2, it is unable to be extracted a safe distance from local residents. As such, Area 1170 has been built around SCP-1170-1. The entire apartment complex has been blocked off; however, due to its rather public location, Foundation personnel are required to maintain disguises when in view.

Shift changes for stationed guards occur every three hours. No personnel are to be permitted entry to SCP-1170-1 --except in special cases-- under any circumstances.

**Description:** SCP-1170-1 is a windowless bedroom, located on the second floor of Apartment #21 in the ████ ███████ Apartment Complex, ██████, British Columbia. The room is 20m x 20m x 3.2m, and appears on all security footage to be an empty room with hardwood floors and concrete walls. The room is unable to be illuminated by standard forms of light (excluding the built-in light fixture), as the darkness within the room seems to re-direct certain waves of light away from the door, causing the room to be effectively unlit. The interior of the room appears to be pitch black when viewed without specialized equipment. --Certain waves of light entering the camera lens seem to encounter no resistance from SCP-1170-1 allowing infrared and night vision cameras to be utilized.-- All light wavelengths are in some way affected by SCP-1170-1, and as such, the room must be monitored with extreme caution for fear of memetic hazard. There is currently no confirmation as to whether radio waves are also manipulated. Audio recording devices have shown to work to an extent.

Upon triggering the built in light fixture, located approximately 3/4 meters away from the door on the western-facing wall, further anomalous behavior is characterized. At this point, subjects claim that the bedside lamps in the room activate, although security footage shows no change in luminescence and infrared cameras do not detect any heat source other than the subjects. In addition, subjects describe the room to have a bed, fireplace, two bedside tables, ████████████ and two lamps, none of which appear in security footage. --It is theorized that this effect may be purely psychic in nature--

[[/div]]
Approximately 1:30 (one minute and thirty seconds) into the examination, an entity (hereafter SCP-1170-2) appears visible to the night vision camera (though only barely, as wavelengths emitted are only up to 10^^6^^ meters in length). SCP-1170-2 shows humanoid bone structure sporting an inverted joint system. --Footage taken shows no interaction between the subject and SCP-1170-2--. At any time between 2 (two) seconds and 40 (forty) minutes after SCP-1170-2 appears, both it and any foreign objects in the room (be them cameras, external lights, or test subjects) vanish. SCP-1170-2 only appears to human subjects who have been present in SCP-1170-1 for the entirety of the time proceeding that appearance of SCP-1170-2. Exiting the room is not recommended while the spectre is present in the room, as [DATA EXPUNGED]. --It is uncertain as to whether or not SCP-1170-1 physically exists or is simply an illusion produced by SCP-1170 by manipulating wavelengths in the near infrared spectrum.--

Monitoring of SCP-1170-1 has shown that subjects in the room seem to be conversing with a partner during times that SCP-1170-2 is present, presumed to be the spectre due to information collected from audio recordings. It is possible that SCP-1170-2 has a memetic effect, due to the sharp changes in emotion experienced in subjects conversing with the spectre.

At random points, objects may appear in SCP-1170-1. Although must are mundane and have been tested negatively for anomalous properties, blood has appeared on the walls, roof, and floor of the room. Blood samples have matched that of D-Class personnel who have vanished with SCP-1170-2. Fecal matter, semen, saliva, and [DATA EXPUNGED] have also been recovered, all consistent with previous test subjects. SCP-1170-2 has avoided all directed questions about any subjects unrelated to love and romantic partnership.

**Foreword:** The audio receivers during this test were put on a frequency of [REDACTED], as well as being placed in new locations around SCP-1170-1 in hopes of receiving more intelligible audio. Log begins immediately after the manifestation of SCP-1170-2. D-20192 is the sole test subject.

**//Begin Log.//**

D-20192: Oh my god, what the fuck is that. What the fuck is that.

SCP-1170-2: Please don't be scared. I only came here for you.

D-20192: Wait, what? For me? I'm a criminal. What do you want with me?

SCP-1170-2: I want to love you. We can be together.

D-20192: Uh, are you even a chick? I'm not into that other thing...

SCP-1170-2: I am not sure what a chick is, but I can assure you that our love will fit well.

D-20192: Dude, this is fucking weird. Oh, //(pause)//, god, I... I just...

SCP-1170-2: We can do it. This is where we can live. No barren residence, filled with ungratefuls, don't appreciate you. I want to love you.

D-20192: I... I want... //(Sobbing is audible at this time)//

SCP-1170-2: I love you.

D-20192: //(Sobbing continues, D-20192 is visible moving to kneel beside SCP-1170-2)//

SCP-1170-2: I need you.

**//End Log.//**

**Afterword:** Less than four (4) seconds after the conclusion of this audio log, D-20192 disappeared from the room along with SCP-1170-2.
