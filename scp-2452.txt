**Item #:** SCP-2452

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-2452 are to be contained in Anomalous Gallery 27, located at Site-09, and kept behind reinforced glass at all times. All personnel entering and leaving Anomalous Gallery 27 are to be logged by on-site security.

In the event that an instance of SCP-2452 is destroyed and SCP-2452-1 released, agents armed with suitable photographic equipment are to be dispatched to the homes of individuals portrayed in the destroyed instance. Upon engagement with SCP-2452-1, photographic equipment is to be used to re-contain SCP-2452-1 and any casualties explained to the public using Misinformation Campaign 24332-D ('The ███████ Strangler'). Any witnesses to an SCP-2452-1 attack are to be dosed with a Class-A amnestic.

**Description:** SCP-2452 is, as of the time of writing, a collection of fifty-two printed photographs taken by deceased photography student Adrian [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1891 Saul] in 20██. All but one instance of SCP-2452 portray crowded streets and analysis of the portrayed locations show that they were taken in Mr. Saul's local area of ███████. The only exception to this is a photographic self-portrait taken by Mr. Saul in his apartment.

SCP-2452-1 is a headless humanoid figure wrapped in bandages which appears in every instance of SCP-2452. SCP-2452-1 generally appears in the foreground of shots, often reaching towards the camera in a threatening manner. However, SCP-2452-1 has been known to change its position in SCP-2452 instances when they are not under observation.

SCP-2452-1 will only physically manifest outside of SCP-2452 when an instance of SCP-2452 is destroyed to a degree where the image is no longer visible. When this occurs, SCP-2452-1 will disappear from every instance of SCP-2452, as well as all copies, and physically manifest in the vicinity of an individual portrayed in the destroyed photograph. Note that although SCP-2452-1 is present in every instance of SCP-2452, only one entity appears during manifestation.

Upon manifestation, SCP-2452-1 will attempt to eliminate every individual portrayed in the destroyed instance of SCP-2452. It typically accomplishes this through strangulation, but has been known to use blunt force when this usual method is not possible. If SCP-2452-1 is killed during a manifestation, its body will disappear and a new instance of SCP-2452-1 will appear at its location within five to ten minutes.

Although SCP-2452-1 will appear in the vicinity of its first target, it will move on to other targets via normal ambulation, and as a result can be tracked down between killings. When SCP-2452-1 has eliminated all of its targets, its physical form will disappear and it will reappear in each instance of SCP-2452. The original destroyed instance of SCP-2452 will also repair itself, no matter what level of destruction it went through.

The only known method of ending an SCP-2452-1 manifestation early is by capturing its image via photography.[[footnote]] Video recordings of SCP-2452-1 do not appear to be effective, despite being made of countless frames of what are essentially photos. [[/footnote]] When this occurs, SCP-2452-1 will disappear in the same manner as it would after killing all its targets, and the photograph taken of it will become a new instance of SCP-2452. The original destroyed instance of SCP-2452 will still repair itself under such circumstances. 

SCP-2452 was discovered in the apartment of Mr. Saul after neighbors reported he had not been seen for several days. Mr. Saul's strangled body was found by police along with a journal documenting the process of creating SCP-2452. Indications of anomalous activity in the journal led the Foundation to take over the investigation and bring SCP-2452 into containment.

**Addendum 2452-1, Journal Excerpts:**

> This is such bullshit. They don't get it. They look at my work and they don't even try to understand it because of course they can't understand it - they don't even try. How can they say that crowd shots aren't showing anything? Are they fucking stupid? It shows the banality of modern life, if you think about it for more than a few seconds. People getting up and performing the same routine, day in and day out. It has an actual message to it, unlike their artsy shit. I need some way to spice up my work so these idiots can understand it. //~ Adrian//[[footnote]] Note Mr. Saul wrote this signature after every message in the journal, even those on the same page. [[/footnote]]

> Managed to get in touch with Dad[[footnote]] A search for this individual is still ongoing. [[/footnote]] and he said he'd send me some stuff to help. Heard him chuckle with that smug laugh of his. Thinks he's better than me. Thinks photography isn't real art - he doesn't say that, but I know he thinks it. Get a clue, idiot. Anyone can shove a paintbrush up their ass and make a pretty picture, IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU SPECIAL. It's pathetic, really. I don't even care. //~ Adrian//

> Is this a joke? It's got to be a joke. Dad's sent me a few scraps out of one of his old books. Does he think I'm going to use some magic hocus pocus to make my work better? (it doesn't need to be better, anyway, it needs to be more accessible for IDIOTS) //~ Adrian//

> holy shit. I did the thing from the pages with the circle and the egg and the blood (hurt my finger like a bitch) and thats so fucking cool. There's this guy in the photo now, and he is fucked - he looks like he just got fucked and it's awesome. Oh shiiiiiit. I'm so fucking good. Gonna see if I can put this guy in all of them //~ Adrian//

> This class is such bullshit. I didn't doctor the fucking photos, you clowns, I used magic. There's no rule against magic. Ugh. They're so stupid they don't even get my work when I dumb it down for them. Fine. Even if they don't understand it, I know it's fucking fantastic and I'll finish it. //~ Adrian//

> My masterpiece is complete. //Cet art est mien et bon.// (Yeah, that's French. Surprised? I'm a pretty cultured guy.) Almost made a big mistake at the last second, putting a 'selfie' in it. Even great artists have their ego's, I suppose. It was me and the big guy, right in the center. What was I thinking, stooping down to the level of your common idiot with a phone? Going to burn that abomination, so I don't get tempted. Ah, the life of an artist...always full of difficulty! //~ Adrian//
