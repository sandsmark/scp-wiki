**Item #:** SCP-3797

**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/niveaux-de-menace-des-objets-scp Threat Level]:** White ○

**Special Containment Procedures:** As SCP-3797 does not yet exist, it does not require containment.

The [[[SCP-1780|Temporal Anomalies Department]]] is to build SCP-3797. They are permitted to use other SCP objects and temporal anomalies in this process, with O5 approval.

Once SCP-3797 has been constructed, it is to be used once, in order to terminate SCP-3797-ARC on 0742 UTC 06/13/2015. It is then to be dismantled.

**Description:** SCP-3797 will be a retrocausal weapon capable of terminating a target at a date in the relative past of activation. SCP-3797 will be used at least one time, at an indeterminate date in the future, to terminate SCP-3797-ARC at 0742 UTC 06/13/2015. It is currently unknown how SCP-3797 will function.

SCP-3797-ARC was an apex-tier pluripotent entity. SCP-3797-ARC possessed near-omniscience, but did not possess precognitive abilities. For more information gathered from SCP-3797-ARC's dormant state, see SCP-3797-ARC's ##red|main file##.

At 0739 UTC 06/13/2015, SCP-3797-ARC awakened, as predicted, and began to initiate a CK-Class Restructuring Scenario. Termination was authorized in order to prevent such an event. MTF Omega-9 [[[SCP-2639|("The Scrubs")]]] and MTF Omega-12 [[[SCP-3480|("Achilles Heels")]]] attempted to terminate SCP-3797-ARC, but all such efforts were prevented by SCP-3797-ARC's reality-altering capabilities.

At 0742 UTC 06/13/2015, several hundred instances of the Temporal Anomalies Department insignia appeared upon SCP-3797-ARC. Five seconds later, all of SCP-3797-ARC's flesh disintegrated. 72 further instances of the Temporal Anomalies Department insignia were discovered on the ground surrounding the previous location of SCP-3797-ARC.

At this time, sensors employed by the Temporal Anomalies Department detected a high-energy temporal displacement originating from the future.

The current prediction of future events is that the Temporal Anomalies Department will have been able to neutralize SCP-3797-ARC by placing the cause of its death after its death, preventing it from knowing of its termination and using its anomalous capabilities to prevent such an event.
