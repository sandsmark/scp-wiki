**Item #:** SCP-3482

**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** Independent wildlife rangers under contract with the Foundation are operating in the regions around SCP-3482, reporting any abnormalities in local terrain or wildlife which could be related to SCP-3482 activity. These rangers are to receive a class of amnestics relative to their exposure to the anomalous if follow-up operations uncover genuine SCP-3482 activity.

Manna Charitable Foundation ([[[Manna Charitable Foundation Hub|GoI-082]]]) and Wilson's Wildlife Solutions ([[[Wilson's Wildlife Solutions Hub|GoI-466]]]) are responsible for maintenance and upkeep of SCP-3482 with supervision from the SCP Foundation. Marshall, Carter & Dark ([[[Marshall Carter and Dark Hub|GoI-012]]]) is allowed to operate within SCP-3482 so long as GoI-466 reports their behavior to the Foundation and the Foundation retains 15% of all monetary transactions between GoI-012 and GoI-466. Foundation agents stationed in rural or remote outposts may be selected for SCP-3482 observation missions as necessary.

All specimens which escape SCP-3482 are to be held for study within Site-64, and then returned intact to GoI-466.

**Description:** SCP-3482 is a wildlife sanctuary located northeast of ███████, Oregon; due to spatial distortion anomalies the total area cannot be accurately measured. The method/location of entry is highly variable, maintained by Wilson's Wildlife Solutions and the Manna Charitable Foundation in an effort to prevent civilians or other outside groups from observing or interfering with the operations of SCP-3482.

The topography, geography, non-anomalous flora and fauna, and other aspects of the biome within SCP-3482 adapt to organisms introduced from outside SCP-3482. These changes inevitably benefit the survivability of introduced organisms. For example, when a small anteater population was introduced to SCP-3482 the population of ants within SCP-3482 greatly increased (from less than 8 colonies to over 300). Where the needs of organisms conflict, SCP-3482 appears to favor the most recently introduced organisms.

Foundation operatives and GoI-466 have determined that, in light of recent events[[footnote]]Such as their innovative and "clever" assistance in the containment of SCP-████.[[/footnote]], they will take full responsibility in handling larger scale anomalies, supported by Foundation contractors. 

> //Taking into account SCP-3482's relative isolation, the new leadership of Wilson's and their willingness to compromise in collaboration, limited assistance is to be given to their field researchers on a case-by-case basis. -- Director Holman, [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-64| Site-64]]]//

**History:** The earliest known records of SCP-3482's existence came from Native American tribes who regarded the area as dangerous. Early American western settlers were known to be directed towards SCP-3482 with the purpose of preventing white settlement in the region. As a result, there was sparse human habitation around SCP-3482 when it came to Foundation attention.

SCP-3482 was discovered by Wilson's Wildlife Solutions, who set up the initial preservation infrastructure. Due to the large cost in money and manpower required to maintain this posture, Wilson's contacted the Manna Charitable Foundation to form a partnership. It has been postulated that Marshall, Carter, & Dark assisted in forming this cooperation but this has not been confirmed.

Wilson's Wildlife Solutions and the Manna Charitable Foundation had been in communication due to their overlapping operations, collaborating outside of Foundation influence. Due to previous conflicts with all involved groups, the Foundation has taken an oversight role to ensure operational security.

||~ Notable SCP-3482 entities.||~ Habitat and Behavior ||~ Notes ||
|| [[[SCP-2895]]]  || Sandy and desert environments, despite their anomalous attributes generally serve as decomposers and scavengers, only utilizing their anomalous traits in self-defense. || Studied specimens lack SCP-2895's distinctive pigmentation, and perish once outside of SCP-3482 ||
|| Aquatic [[[scp-131| Eye Pods]]] || Main body is similar to SCP-131, with the addition of dorsal fins and gills for underwater breathing. || Foundation assets currently attempting to acquire a specimen for biological comparison with SCP-131. ||
|| [[[SCP-1513| Plant Entities]]] || Seeding similar to SCP-1513 with some variation due to natural genetic mutation. Strains with greater and lesser aggression, intelligence, and mobility have been noted. || As more humans have been regularly touring SCP-3482, it has been noted that a few disappearances have been linked to SCP-3482. The prospect of death has not deterred future SCP-3482 tourism, as MC&D has even begun emphasizing this in their marketing materials. ||
|| [[[SCP-745| Headlights]]] || Introduced by the Foundation, instances of SCP-745 have taken over habitat abandoned by the naturally occurring phenomenon due to human encroachment. || Night driving within SCP-3482 is prohibited for Foundation personnel due to the potential for crashing and death. Manna and Wilson's have imposed similar bans, and have requested the Foundation not introduce any additional wildlife to SCP-3482. MC&D has not altered any of their policies in reaction to SCP-745 related casualties. ||
|| Gigantic Cephalapod || No underground water reservoirs exist, with all chasms and spaces benath the surface which would normally contain water being filled by an octopus which excretes water and nutrients to the surface. || Water is being tested as a possible source of SCP-3482's anomaly. ||


**Addendum:** Recovered documentation pertaining to the relevant groups of interest. As the nature of their involvement with SCP-3482 has changed, due in part to events documented in these files, this document has been slated for major revision.

The following is not a complete list of documents related to SCP-3482, nor of those relating to GoI interactions. These items have been deemed sufficient in conveying the situation, as far as the Foundation is presently aware. Contact the on-site archivist(s) for further information.

I know most of us aren't such scholarly types, so I'm gonna try to write up what's happening in regards to the Reserve in terms that all of us farmers and farmhands can digest and comprehend. I feel it fitting that I translate, because my father was a lawyer and I am at least lightly acquainted in law practice. I hope that this summation of the contracts that were drawn up circulates until this is common knowledge. Let's begin.

We like them, they like us! We have similar goals: social justice, environmentalism, etc.. Just a perfect fit. And they're magical, too! Great allies to have. For anyone who doesn't know of them, as far as they have told us (and as much as the Supervisors have told us), they're an organization that uses magic to help people in need. Sometimes, the Supervisors and Manna get into a tizzy, but not over big enough things to make us not allowed to work with them.

We have had our [[[SCP-3465|differences in the past]]], and we still generally don't like them (let's hope they don't see this, but I doubt they would care all too much). They're a company that capitalizes on selling magic to the magical world, a world we live only on the very outer edge of. They're very, very rich, and they are basically funding the Reserve. So right now, we are taking no issue with them.

**How it All Comes Together**
[[/>]]
[[/div]]
[[div style="color:#665731; background: #d1ed9a;padding: 15px"]]
The Manna Charitable Foundation is responsible for the infrastructure required to keep the Reserve up and running. They've made the gates, the roads to and from, and all that jazz.

Marshall, Carter, and Dark provides advertising and travel packages for individuals looking to take a tour or engage in other, limited activities. This is in place because this is how we stay funded -- as long as they split their profits (at a begrudging 60/40), we (Manna Charitable and ourselves) have enough to keep in operation -- building structures, keeping up the wildlife shelter that we have right outside specifically for wildlife within the Reserve, and to clean up any unwanted traces of human presence (often left by uncaring MC&D patrons, if I felt like pointing it out).

Wilson's maintains the existing infrastructure and provides guidance to travelers once they're in the reserve. We all three jointly manage and divide earnings at the gates. Additionally, the Supervisors exercise some oversight over all proceedings, as well as providing security forces in case of an escape or if we need medical assistance. They're helpful, but they sure are paranoid!

//Someone// is putting up some unapproved buildings and structures, and we really don't know who yet! No one's claiming to be doing it, but we can know //for certain// it's none of //us//. Not just that I don't believe it's in our character, but let's face it -- we're the least capable of anyone to make a cottage out of the blue, or install pipes. Manna's been putting funds into disassembling the structures, and that only leaves one party here to be doing it. Not that it's such a stretch of the imagination, when suddenly you have a ticket booth that someone's claiming to have "spawned from mid-air". I don't know who they think they're fooling.

I don't know about you all, but I know this wouldn't have sat well with Tim. We should be standing up for ourselves a bit more. Being passive just ain't right.

NOTE: //Al, you've got to cool down. You make some good points, so I won't demand a revision, but you're doing a poor job at keeping a level head. Gonna put this in there both as a reprimand to you and a message to everyone else. We// are //doing things, and we// are //making headway. Not that we don't appreciate a little extra passion.//

||||||||I didn't expect to find much when I was told about a wildlife preserve in Oregon. Most American sites like this are pale shadows of what we see on the continental side of things. But I was impressed by the scale of their operations. A woman named Fae conducted my tour, talking up the potential of our investing in her facilities. Although they were operating at a higher level than I expected, they clearly needed our investment more than we need them. A good opportunity to have complete control of the business side of things if there ever was one. Recommending further inspection of their financial records for avenues of exploitation. There seemed to be a heavy commitment to keeping their hands clean, so working slow and steady would be best. ||

|||||||| The remains of #459 were discovered in a rotten state on the edge of the preserve. Drowned, from the looks of it. As the location of its discovery had been thoroughly canvassed by representatives from all involved parties, it appears as though it may have been placed deliberately after the fact.

A wildlife preserve managed by a joint operation of MC&D, MCF and WWS. The primary responsibility of our volunteers is construction of facilities to allow temporary or semi-permanent human habitation without disturbing the balance of wildlife in the region. Gating, accommodations and necessary facilities for medical, plumbing, and storage of supplies are all presently constructed with a reasonable ecological footprint.

[[size 130%]][[span style="color:#6BAB30;"]]**Maintenance and Operation:**[[/span]][[/size]] 

At present, the facilities maintained by the MCF are funded by our donor network. Each building has been sponsored by an organization or individual interested in wildlife preservation.

Present policy has been for all that is taken in to be taken out. This has become doubly important with the influx of development by an unknown party. All records of preserve materials are currently under audit.


[[size 130%]][[span style="color:#6BAB30;"]]**Security Restrictions:**[[/span]][[/size]] Volunteers must have a minimum of six years with the Foundation to be assigned to the preserve. Experience in the field of animal handling is a must. On-site security is provided by the SCP Foundation, so experience with the Peace Corps. is a better indicator of relevant experience than any jungle adventuring. 

[[size 130%]][[span style="color:#6BAB30;"]]**Safety Concerns:**[[/span]][[/size]] Several contractors working for MC&D have gone missing recently. However, as these were all in areas restricted to their customers only, Foundation volunteers should consult their standard regional advisory manuals.

The fatalities have been a severe handicap on MC&D's business activity. They have begun seeking additional development of attractions to shore up their touring side, as the hunters have dried up after they all began dying off. Their representatives have been pressuring Fae Wilson to allow zoological construction to take place. A cost-benefit analysis of having such a structure up-front, to allow the majority of the preserve to be undisturbed, is ongoing. Deconstruction efforts of unwanted infrastructure is also pending necessary funding.

As for our current facilities, the Woody Woodbury wooded preserve has been highly successful, and naming rights to unspoiled sections of wilderness are to be given for donation levels set at premiums comparative to that set.

There have been tremors recorded recently. Localized to the interior of the preserve. There's never been any kind of earthquake before. The ecological damage could be devastating. On the other hand, it has the potential to destroy the creeping infrastructure, which appears to be constructing itself faster than the Foundation's volunteers can deconstruct it. Things may be coming to a head soon.

The deconstruction efforts have been more successful as of late. However, this has led to a cyclical problem of the infrastructure required to disassemble the spontaneous infrastructure being just as disruptive as what's being taken away. Fae has had some suggestions for a more natural deconstruction, but it's a slow process.

I've never seen anything like it. Tentacled appendages with waterfalls pouring off of them ripped out of the ground and left everything in pieces. 

Everything we've built, the whole spearpoint of our support network has been wiped out all at once. 

I feel just awful. Then I feel awful about feeling awful. It's a blow for the Foundation and a blow for us. None of the donors are going to be happy. But without winning back their support, the natural splendor here is only going to be whittled away when people really start building houses around here, or if the other Foundation gets a little more hands on. 

I wish I could say I'd make it to see what happens. But the water is still rising. I've let the volunteers take the last lifeboat. Tell my husband I'm sorry. 

-- Volunteer Manager Armand Grey

//Faeowynn Wilson was rescued among the survivors. Her report corroborated what the late Armand Grey described, that early in the morning an enormous earthquake had struck. This was followed by the eruption of numerous tendrils from the ground. Water poured out, inundating the area. Humans and animals alike drowned. I thought the Eye Pods would be more buoyant. Poor things, they didn't even have a chance.//

//Rescue operations were able to find additional survivors. All human-constructed infrastructure had been destroyed. Not violently, but through natural means. Moss and vines were coating most walls which were still standing, and no evidence of the railway past the main entrance could be found.//

//The water had given to us, and now the water has taken away. We're going to have to rethink our approach here, I want to stay but things have to change. Too many cooks spoiled the broth.// -- Committee Chairwoman Rohter
