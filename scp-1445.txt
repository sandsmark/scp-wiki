**Item #:** SCP-1445

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1445 is to be kept in a standard storage chamber inside Storage Site-23, with standard humidity control mechanisms for antique preservation. The object is to be kept sterile and examined biweekly. Other additional antique preservation measures may be employed as necessary under the direction of hired curator Mr. C████. Because the object is susceptible to normal damage from mishandling, an expert curator is necessary to ensure the object's survival in the long term. Guards posted at the entrance of the chamber are to search for and confiscate incendiary tools from those who access it.

Because public knowledge of SCP-1445 existed prior to its containment in various degrees due to its history, information countermeasures have been deployed by the Foundation in order to prevent the spread of knowledge of its anomalous properties. In the Western world, where references to the object have been found in texts back to 19██ CE, the history of SCP-1445 is to be branded as a myth. References to the object as such have been disseminated into the media, discrediting the actual accounts of the object. In the People's Republic of China, the aid of the Chinese government has been enlisted to restrict access to contemporary accounts of SCP-1445 and to suppress the rumors of SCP-1445 in Chinese internet circles. Specifically, the government internet commentators colloquially known as the "5 Mao Party" have been instructed on the Foundation's behalf to disparage any users who allege the existence of the object, past or present, on the basis of the history of SCP-1445 being entirely made up of "superstitious beliefs". They were further instructed to redirect the attention to modern Chinese spacefaring achievements and divert the topic completely, using Chinese nationalism as a catalyst.

**Description:** SCP-1455 is a wooden chair approximately 0.75 meters tall, resting on top of a square base of 1.5 meters with a height of 3 centimeters. The base suffers minor burn damage, presumably from its first usage. All of the wood material used in SCP-1455 has been identified to be from //Dalbergia odorifa//[[footnote]]Commonly known as fragrant rosewood, a popular material for high-quality wooden furniture during the Ming and Qing dynasties.[[/footnote]]. When carbon dated, the object was to determined to be about 6██ years old and to have been made around 14██ CE, or during the early portion of the Ming Dynasty. On the sides of the base that correspond to the left and right sides of the chair are eleven rockets attached with animal glue adhesives, or twenty-two in total. The rockets have fuses that are suspected to regenerate after use, however no other parts of the object display such regenerative properties and can be damaged as expected. Mr. C████ noted the furniture as a whole to be extremely well maintained for its age, which can be attributed to the time the object has spent in the vacuum of space. However, it has suffered minor damage from what have been determined to be micrometeoroid impacts, though the damage was repaired and the object restored to the fullest extent possible after acquisition by the Foundation under the coordination of Mr. C████.

SCP-1455 first entered the Foundation's attention in 2███ CE, when Foundation personnel monitoring the Internet noted persistent rumors in the popular Chinese web portals ████ and █████ of the chair of the Ming Dynasty official Wan Hu being visible in space just outside the gravitational field of the Earth. The rumors were detailed to the point of providing apparent coordinates of [REDACTED] and very low-resolution pictures of the object. The Foundation immediately investigated the rumors with the Foundation telescope located at [REDACTED] and saw the object as well as what appeared to be a dead body seated in the chair. Contemporary records of the Ming Dynasty were also accessed after a search of Foundation historical databases that seem to confirm that Wan Hu had constructed and used the object in the year 14██ CE. After the confirmation of the rumors, the Chinese government was contacted, and the offending material was immediately removed, with information countermeasures then developed and deployed as per the Special Containment Procedures.

Extraterrestrial Retrieval Team █-█ was dispatched to the site and removed both SCP-1445 and the body for examination upon arrival at Storage Site-23. Storage Site-23 was chosen to be the destination of the object after extraterrestrial retrieval, due to general proximity and its standard storage chambers being suitable for its containment. After it was brought to Storage Site-23, the body was taken away and brought to the medical wing for an autopsy. At the same time, Mr. C████ had been contacted as an outside expert on his subject and was asked to give an inspection of the object based on his expertise. He had inferred correctly that the piece dated from the Ming Dynasty and noted the damage the object had received, then suggested measures that could restore the object and preserve it in the long-term. He offered to preform said measures to demonstrate their effectiveness, and after review he was hired shortly afterwards and inducted as a curator for SCP-1445, and has since led the effort in preserving the object.

Upon detailed examination of the retrieved objects conducted by scientific personnel on site, it was noted that neither the chair nor the body suffered the damage that they should have sustained upon traveling at escape velocity from atmospheric friction and drag. In addition, neither suffered any significant decomposition due to the time spent in the vacuum of space, though the body was frozen solid due to the extremely low temperatures it had spent time in. The body was noted to be wearing a //hanfu//[[footnote]]A traditional Chinese silk robe worn by the gentry.[[/footnote]] appropriate to the style of the Ming Dynasty and a //wushamao//[[footnote]]A hat worn by Han Chinese officials during the Ming Dynasty.[[/footnote]], providing further evidence of the object's time of origin. The clothes were then removed for the autopsy, which determined that the specimen had suffered from brain damage stemming from sudden deceleration, and that the final cause of death was asphyxiation. The specimen also appeared to have been damaged by micrometeroids as the chair had been.

A testing procedure for SCP-1445 has been proposed by Dr. A███, in order to discern the anomalous properties of the object directly through experimentation. After consultation with other departments of the Foundation and a week of consideration, the proposal was denied by Site Director ██████ (See Addendum-1445-A). However, based on contemporary documents in Foundation historical databases, the observed position of the object in space, and the information received from the autopsy conducted, some anomalous properties of the object have been hypothesized, for focused testing of the object should it be allowed in the future:

# The fuses of the object are capable of regeneration. The object was found with fuses whole and unburnt, but contemporary documents clearly describe a "[...] ceremonious lighting of the fuses".
# Upon the lighting of all of the fuses, SCP-1445 is capable of reaching escape velocity and generating an anomalous amount of propulsion from the rockets. The hypothesis is supported by the object's final position in space, just outside of Earth's gravitational field. The contemporary description of the event indicated that actual rocketry was involved, not some other as-of-yet unknown method, as the object was referred to as "[...] bringing Han Fu into the aegis of Heaven with a great deal of fire and smoke, to never be seen again."
# The object generates some kind of field around it to nullify the effects of atmospheric friction and drag. No damage has been observed on the object from such effects and any object reaching Earth's escape velocity should have suffered significant damage, even modern spaceships.
# The object comes to a sudden halt immediately after leaving Earth's gravitational field. The final position of SCP-1445 in space indicates that it left it, but logically it should have continued on after that. In addition, the deceleration damage that the specimen suffered from supports the hypothesis. Somewhat more dubiously, the contemporary documents noted Wan Hu's goal as "[...] [breaking] the reach of the Earth to join Heaven as one", which could be interpreted to have been accomplished if it meant leaving the gravitational field of the Earth.

After having consulted with the Accounting Department and the Information Control Department, I am afraid that your proposal for testing SCP-1445 will be denied. Let us review the reasons. According to the Accounting Department, the proposal that you have sent will cost approximately $███.█ million for retrieval alone (and this is in addition to taking valuable time out of Retrieval's busy schedule). Then, adding in the $██.█ million estimate the Information Control Department gave me (assuming a best-case scenario) up to $██.█ million (assuming a worst-case scenario), I am afraid that there is really no money to be put into the proposal you have made. Or, in fact, for any proposals you can make for this object, given the necessary expenses for testing it. The $██.█ million that has already been spent for its recovery is already far and beyond the total costs of most objects. While the Foundation's pockets are deep, and research is an important aspect of the Foundation, we hardly have the money to be spending for testing an easily contained Safe-class object that you already understand fairly decently. I respect your devotion to science and empirical data, but the potential benefits for the cost will be low, the amount of risk of losing the object or Foundation funds are high, and there are more urgent matters that draw the Foundation's attention and resources. Remember our priorities, Dr. A███.

Cordially,
Site Director ██████
