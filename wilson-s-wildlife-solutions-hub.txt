**Boring Agreement Prelude**

[[/div]]
[[div style="color:#665731; background: #d1ed9a;padding: 15px"]]
"In this world, normalcy is difficult to maintain. The regulation of the anomalous is a strain on all those involved, in all ways involved. Funds, personnel, our very humanity is taxed. However, it is of utmost importance that normalcy is maintained, as that has been, and continues to be, part of The Foundation's prime directive.

Due to the importance of normalcy, containment of anomalies is generally undertaken by The Foundation, with little exception that is within our control. However, due to rising anomalous activity, we have been forced to examine our own resources, and while they are plentiful, they are not infinite. It is because of this inherent, undeniable limit to our influence, that we make this proposition.

The Boring Agreement is not just an outline of steps and regulations, or contractual legalization that allows Wilson Wildlife Solutions to interact with anomalies. It is a pact. A pact that must be upheld, no matter the costs. The Boring Agreement is Wilson Wildlife Solution's pledge to maintain normalcy, and to bear all burdens that the duty entails.

Secure. Contain. Protect."

**Introduction**

[[/div]]
[[div style="color:#665731; background: #d1ed9a;padding: 15px"]]
Hello, pardner! It looks like you fine fellow have found yourself in Clackamas County and the town of Boring, Oregon, that can claim to have the least fitting name in all of the United States -- except maybe Hell over in Michigan. For those of us who grew up here, it sure may as well be boring as all boring can get, but we've recently run into some people who we affectionately refer to as the Supervisors, and through some conversations here and small talk there we know that we //apparently// live in what some call a "nexus". A nexus that gives us some weird animals 'round these parts.

I, myself, am Tim Wilson, the founder of this wonderful community funded organization that goes by the name Wilson's Wildlife Solutions! You have wildlife problems, and we solve them. Recently we've gotten some new sources of cash, so we're spreading our horizons all across Oregon, which is known (but not by most) as the world's greatest source of exotic fauna. The amazon may have its parakeets and tigers or whatever lives down there, but up here we got big supposedly extinct birds, cleverly calming turtles, money driven crows, time hopping coyotes, and the like.

We've been operational since 1997, when I was but a wee lad of 42 years, and we have been under //official// supervision since 2008 upon the signing of the legendary Boring Agreement (which came about after the infamous Ursus Maritimus Incident). Since then it has been cake eating and smooth sailing! Well, as of the time of writing. The world is a crazy place, and it's honestly a bit surprising just how well we have all been handling it. Let's hope that we stay that way.

**What We're All About**
[[/>]]
[[/div]]
[[div style="color:#665731; background: #d1ed9a;padding: 15px"]]
Our organizational structure is flimsy at best, but it works. I, Tim Wilson, am the founder, and some people are second in command, and some people are below them, and everyone does what they are best at and what they want to do. Officially, we can be called by anyone in Clackamas County to handle, say, a group of deer that consistently block the road or raccoons that keep getting into the trash. Unofficially, we can be called by anyone in Oregon and be expected to respond, for reasons much more esoteric than our website lists (we have a website, by the way). We're also officially a wildlife rehabilitation center. Get us some animals with broken legs or birds with clipped wings and we will get them back on their feet, guaranteed. It's what we do.

As a team, we're ecologists, zoologists, veterinarians, animal control specialists, environmentalists, passionate individuals, friends, and family. We're capable, we're innovative, and we're really, really nice most of the time. Come say hi!

**Loosely Followed Format(s)**
[[/>]]
[[/div]]
[[div style="color:#665731; background: #d1ed9a;padding: 15px"]]
Format! How would us geo-eyes even have identities without unique //formats//? Well we got just the darnedest, most clean format one can ever possibly hope for (so bland, in fact, that we've been silently hoping that some kind of graphic designers comes and helps us out some time soon). It's functional and the colors are pleasant, so we keep it around.

While we have plenty of different //formats// for all types of occasions, here are the divs we use to let us stand out and feel fresh (and minty).

**Border Div**
> @@[[div style="border:1px solid #665731;"]]@@

This is what gives us our crisp, nice borders. You would put this div before any other divs, and end it with @@[[/div]]@@ //after// ending all other divs. It's nice, and was gifted to us by a pal.

**Beginning & End Divs**
> @@[[div style="color:white; background: #a3c162;padding: 15px;"]]@@

These are bookends. The first one typically introduces a title and a prelude to what the format is gonna be, and at the end we tend to use them as short conclusions. Of course, we don't always end with them (take a quick look below and you'll see that), but we do //always// start with them. Titles are usually @@[[SIZE 150%]]@@.

**Sub-//div//-isions**
> @@[[div style="color:#665731; background: #c8e293;padding: 5px"]]@@

These things are used as subdivisions or subtitles under the bigger title. For example, right now you are reading under the "Loosely Followed Format(s)" subtitle. Everything under these divs are pushed to the right using @@[[>]]@@, and most often bolded.

**Main Bulk Divs**
> @@[[div style="color:#665731; background: #d1ed9a;padding: 15px"]]@@

This is what creates that nice minty color that you are reading over //right now//! Crazy, right? These are used for all the meaty actual ready (read as "read-y") bits. Not much else to say about them, you now know all the divs and what they do! Congratulations!

Now, there //are// some formatting things to expect in the future. As was said, we're hoping that at some point we may stumble upon a graphic designer to help us make some clean revisions to the divs, so they aren't so clearly just divs, but ah well. They look nice at the moment anyways. Maybe some borders, on the right and the left? May or may not happen.

What definitely //will// happen is, drum roll please... //A CSS theme//! Something nice to put over our Independent Projects (geo-eye formats, pure and simple) and our recorded Anecdotes From the Guys (stories we liked enough to bother recording for new recruits to read and / or retell around a campfire). Expect that in the future! Will it be the near future? The far future? Who knows! But the future it will be.
