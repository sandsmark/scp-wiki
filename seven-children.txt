Watching from a park bench on a lovely, sunny day
I noticed seven children who had gathered there to play

@@     @@Zeru was the eldest, and he led until his end
@@     @@Ursula was skilled, but filled with envy of her friend
@@     @@Eoghan was beloved, but could not avoid the fight
@@     @@Rachna is the only one remaining here tonight
@@     @@Nessa was forgotten by her friends and disappeared
@@     @@Yorick lasted longest, but still left as Rachna feared
@@     @@Myron is the mystery my observation cost,
@@     @@I know I saw him playing too, but now it seems he’s lost

Watching from a park bench on a dark and lonely night
Only one remains here to protect and give us light

I wonder how much longer Rachna can put up a fight.
