**Item #:** SCP-5269

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation assets within organizations that maintain lunar observational equipment are to suppress information regarding SCP-5269 through standard Immediate Celestial Anomaly protocol.

**Description:** SCP-5269 is a topographic anomaly located on the Haworth crater of the south pole of the Moon.
 
SCP-5269 is an unidentified humanoid figure of unknown age and origin embedded in the lunar surface. SCP-5269 remains in an immobile position with its arms outstretched. Rock and lunar soil have completely covered SCP-5269's lower limbs, securing SCP-5269's position in the Moon's regolith. The object has not been observed to decompose, age, or exhibit any other phenomena associated with life or death. Thus, the biological state of SCP-5269 is unknown.
 
SCP-5269 is capable of transmitting radio signals. The origin, purpose, and intended receiver of these signals is unknown. The contents of an SCP-5269 communication are presented in an anomalous, universally digestible system, capable of being comprehended and understood regardless of the listener's known language. SCP-5269 has been observed to transmit messages once every two years since the object's discovery in 2016.
 
All attempts to communicate with SCP-5269 have failed.
