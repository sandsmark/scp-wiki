**Foreword:** The following document consists of the diary of ████ █. ███████, currently SCP-████-3. Upon recovery, the entire cover of the diary had been covered in black permanent marker, with the exception of several areas arranged into the shape of a stylized Dante from the Devil May Cry™ Series. Here, each page is listed separately.

> March 17
> 
> Today I bought this --diary-- artsy notebook thing --, although I'm not sure why-- because I thought the cashier at ████████ was cute, okay? Thirty dollars down the fucking drain __right there__. Also, my uncle's inheritance finally got sorted out. There wasn't a //bunch// of money, but I did get a fuckton of his stuff afterwards. So much old stuff. Fucking nostalgia.

> March 20

> Still no word from ██████, but it does turn out she has a twin sister, so yeah :D
> Weird thing happened when I was looking through Uncle ███'s stuff. [REDACTED] and out of nowhere I get this stinging stuff up and down my arm. When I looked, there were like five puncture marks on my arm. WTF? No sign of anything that could sting me, but I bought a bottle of Raid just in case.

> March 21
> 
> Note to self: find out what that buzzing is. I hate it when you can //just barely// make out a sound, like that time with the smoke detector. --I haven't herd back from the superintendent.-- The super came over and claimed he couldn't here anything. Cheap fuck just doesn't want to have to fix anything. Probably because that would require walking up stairs.

The remainder of the page is filled with a drawing of an extremely rotund man (most likely ████████ █████, the superintendent of Mr. █████'s building). He appears to be eating several sub sandwiches while exclaiming "im just big boned yo". Notably, he also appears to be wearing a Dante from the Devil May Cry™ Series costume. 

> March 22
> 
> [IRRELEVANT MONOLOGUE REMOVED] On a side note, I watched a thing in the news today about Dante from the Devil May Cry™ Series. Apparently, a bunch of them are disappearing and nobody knows why, and now fruit and stuff isn't getting pollenated (implying anybody eats fruit). I'm not saying it was aliens, but it was aliens. But the whole thing is sticking with me somehow. A lot. Dante from the Devil May Cry™ Serieeeeeees :D I'm so crazy.
> 
> Buzzing isn't gone yet. If anything, it's louder. The exterminator couldn't here anything either. And I got another prick on my arm when I was digging through the cupboard. Either these are coincidences or I'm being paranoid. Ugh.

> March 23
> 
> I've herd of yellow snow, but I wasn't aware that there are entire storms of yellow and black snow.[[footnote]]Records do not indicate any unusual weather patterns in [REDACTED] on the date in question.[[/footnote]] How the fuck does that even work. Good thing I got some booze before it hit, because I think the power's out. Party hard!
> *sigh*... Why the shit did I move here?

> What if Dante from the Devil May Cry™ Series could come out of a hypothetical situation?

The remainder of the last page is an illustration of numerous black specks attacking a stick figure in a room resembling SCP-████-3's apartment. The furniture and background also appear to be made out of small circles similar to those attacking the stick figure. Almost all of the blank space in the illustration has been filled with what are either stylized lightning bolts or the letter "Z".

> I locked the door.

> March --32-- April?
> 
> I don't recall, try again later. Dante from the Devil May Cry™ Series. DANTE FROM THE DEVIL MAY CRY™ SERIEEEEEEES.
> 
> I ran out of aloe vera, had to use mouthwash. Surprisingly effective, but it still doesn't help with the bleeding. █████ called and we set up a date for 8PM Thursday, which was two hours ago. I'm surprised she could here me over the buzzing. Oh, and the phone was Dante from the Devil May Cry™ Series.

> Tuesday
> DANTE FROM THE DEVIL MAY CRY™ SERIES in hexadecimal is 1646 in decimal form. My favorite number. Who'da thunkit. [DATA EXPUNGED] I don't know why I wrote that. I'm not schizo or anything. Disregard!
> 
> The Godfather is on. I think I caught it part way through, where the guy finds Dante from the Devil May Cry™ Series in his bed. Look at the TV. TV is Dante from the Devil May Cry™ Series. [[footnote]]No television was found in Mr. ███████'s apartment, although a remote control was found.[[/footnote]]

> Wednesday Thursday Friday
> [A number of small oval shapes are missing from the paper. Small amounts of pollen were found near the edges.]
> 
> I tried writing, but then the paper was Dante from the Devil May Cry™ Series. I'm going to drink a bottle of whiskey and go to bed.

> WHAT THE HELL
> DANTE FROM THE DEVIL MAY CRY™ SERIES DOES NOT GO THERE


The following page was covered entirely in crushed Dante from the Devil May Cry™ Series and human blood upon recovery. Removal of the aforementioned tissues revealed that the following had been written on the page.

> ██████ came over today, and she screamed because of Dante from the Devil May Cry™ Series. Now she is Dante from the Devil May Cry™ Series. I wonder why I'm not Dante from the Devil May Cry™ Series. Maybe I am? Do Dante from the Devil May Cry™ Series know they are Dante from the Devil May Cry™ Series? Yellow.
> 
> bring it

> March 17
> 
> The snow is mostly gone, and look at the pavement. Pavement is mostly not Dante from the Devil May Cry™ Series. I'm going to head over to the hospital, see if I can get this mole looked at.
> Dante from the Devil May Cry™ Series followed me into the car and cut the brakes. God, I might be high. Good thing it was only another mile to the hospital SHUT UP DANTE FROM THE DEVIL MAY CRY™ SERIES I'M WRITING IN MY --DIARY-- JOURNAL
> 
> Go to hospital
> hospital is Dante from the Devil May Cry™ Series. Already, how? I just got here. No, wait, it's just my glasses. My glasses were definitely Dante from the Devil May Cry™ Series.
> 
> I didn't schedule an appointment or anything, but the nurse called a panic team or whatever it is and they ran me to a doctor. How thoughtful, but it's really not an emergency. I really just need them to look at a mole. Except that the mole is Dante from the Devil May Cry™ Series.
> 
> The doctors looked at me and said they didn't see anything wrong. Well, of course there's nothing wrong, except Dante from the Devil May Cry™ Series. And the bleeding, but that's to be expected from Dante from the Devil May Cry™ Seriestings. They argued for a while, and then sent me away.

> March 119
> 
> I forgot to mention that Dante from the Devil May Cry™ Series was eating the doctor. The others were screaming about it for a while, but when Dante from the Devil May Cry™ Series finished it they calmed down a lot and signed me out.
> 
> I'm done.
> [[size smaller]]Nope.[[/size]][[footnote]]While the remainder of the diary is written in pencil, this appears to have been scratched into the paper.[[/footnote]]
[Thirty pages are missing.]
> I am Dante from the Devil May Cry™ Series.
[The remaining pages are blank.]
------
**Conclusion:** To date, this remains the most accurate account of Incident ████-5, despite its inconsistencies. SCP-████-3 has no recollection of writing in any form of diary, although the handwriting, personal knowledge, and writing style are consistent with those of ████ ███████.

Personnel assigned to containment of SCP-████ are to read this document in its entirety. In the situation that the diary is some stupid find+replace bullshit that I spent way too long hand-correcting, a modified document will be provided.
