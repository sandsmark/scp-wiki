**Item #:** SCP-2772

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** As SCP-2772 is currently immovable, a soundproofed containment unit has been built around it.The property SCP-2772 manifested in has been purchased and Cryptography Task Force 2772-08 has been stationed on-site. Cryptography Task Force 2772-08 is to also to function as the containment unit's guard. Unauthorized individuals found attempting to enter the property are to be detained and questioned of any potential relation to SCP-2772 or Incident 2772.

Images and audio of SCP-2772 are to be recorded. Recordings are to be delivered to Cryptography Task Force 2772-08 for decoding. For a full list of recordings, refer to Document 2772-01 through -13. Testing on SCP-2772 has been relegated to Cryptography Task Force 2772-08. Exceptions are to be approved by Level 4 personnel or higher only. SCP-2772 is not to be tested with any living animal or human.

**Description:** SCP-2772 is an immobile spatial phenomenon occupying the lobby of the ██████ Library. It is approximately five meters in length, two meters in width, and seven meters in height, covering over 97% of the lobby. SCP-2772 can be most consistently identified through the appearance of an intangible visual phenomenon that resembles television static. Moving through SCP-2772 is most accurately described to be similar to the minor electrical sensation of touching a cathode ray tube television screen. The furniture, floor, and walls of the space that SCP-2772 occupies will change color, hue, and lighting seemingly at random. Solid objects such as furniture and decorations in SCP-2772 react abnormally to attempted physical manipulation; solid objects may become intangible, move vertically, or become elastic while still being fixed to the floor. Introduced liquids gained similar anomalous properties after twelve hours in SCP-2772; liquid-based anomalies include changes in color, opacity, and viscosity. 

SCP-2772 will produce sound identifiable as a series of multiple slow-scan television (SSTV) transmissions and audio clips every seventy-two hours. While the SSTV transmissions are believed to be unique to SCP-2772, the audio clips have been identified as originating from six hundred and seventy-four distinct sources thus far. The images from the SSTV transmissions are encrypted text along with what appears to be text-based art relevant to the decrypted message. The last SSTV transmission of every auditory event consists solely of text and uses a different, --currently unknown-- encryption method.

> **<06:14>** "Because we were not born, does that mean we [INDECIPHERABLE] to call ourselves?"

**Incident 2772:** On February █, 20██ at 06:12, a single white rose and a card appeared in front of SCP-2772. As SCP-2772 has not manifested objects before, it is currently theorized to have been caused by anomalous activity outside of SCP-2772. No personnel on duty reported having identified any anomalous activity during this time. On the card was a note written with blue ink in neat cursive containing what is believed to be the entire decoded transcript of Auditory Event 482, as follows, as well as a decryption key to the last SSTV transmission of SCP-2772's Auditory Events. Decryption is currently in process.

> I cannot bury data, but maybe this is close enough. Our time together never truly existed, but it was real enough to us. 
> The coming days will be lonely without you. The days we spent together would be lonelier having never met you.
> If there is some deity out there who can hear the prayer of a nonexistence,
> If there is a life beyond this one,
> Please let us meet again there.
