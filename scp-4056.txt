**Item #:** SCP-4056

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation Personnel are to be stationed outside of SCP-4056 to amnestize any civilians who encounter the anomaly. Select humanoids within SCP-4056 have been transferred to be contained at Site-17 (See Addenum 4056.2 for details). 

**Description:** SCP-4056 is a facility located in northern Alaska. SCP-4056 contains approximately 550 different humanoids in cryogenic stasis chambers. While each of these humanoids varies from each other slightly in appearance, genetic analysis shows that their DNA is identical to that of Director Charles Ogden Gears.

The stasis chambers in which each humanoid is housed appears to be powered by harnessing the cold temperatures and turning the lack of heat into an energy source. The technology used to do this is not well understood and theorized to be anomalous in nature. Additionally, each chamber is branded with a logo that resembles that of Prometheus Labs, except for a few key differences. Foundation contacts at Prometheus Labs have confirmed that no such cryogenic stasis cells have been developed by the company, nor have they developed technology capable of harnessing energy from the cold as these machines have. 

SCP-4056 contains a single furnished room that contains a bed, changes of clothes, a refrigerator with an apple and a single jar of strawberry jam in it, and a nightstand with a lamp and a picture of a man resembling Director Charles Ogden Gears at age 34[[footnote]] The main difference between the two being the man in the picture has significantly more hair.[[/footnote]] with a woman resembling his wife.  

**Discovery: Incident 4056-0.01:** On April 5th, 2049, PoI-4056 infiltrated Site-17 through unknown means. The subject was first detected by Foundation security systems at 21:02 outside Doctor Charles Gears' office. The following interaction was recorded between Doctor Gears and PoI-4056.

PoI-4056 has been added to Foundation registry. Subject is of mixed race, female and thaumaturgically capable. Additionally, PoI-4056 appears to possess detailed information on the Foundation and several members of its personnel. PoI-4056 was tracked to SCP-4056.

**Addendum 4056.2:** After locating SCP-4056 by following the tracker lodged in PoI-4056, Foundation personnel led by Dr. Gears waited until PoI-4056 was no longer detected within SCP-4056 before entering the facility. Below is a list of humanoids inspected by Dr. Gears and cleared for further investigation:

||~ Designation||~ Notes||~ Status||
|| AVN-98822||Subject's brain emits blue-colored bioluminescence and is slightly enlarged.|| Assigned to Site-34 research facility.||
||AVN-36241||Instance speaks in incomprehensible bird-like squawks. Hair possesses a feather-like texture.|| Stored in SCP-4056.||
||AVN-223647|| Body is an amorphous mass. Subject expressed overwhelming pain upon the de-activation of its pod.|| Stored in SCP-4056.||
|| AVN-64573|| Subject is genetically identical to Dr. Gears but shares no personality traits. Of note, the subject is in possession of a [[[SCP-963|starburst-cut ruby ring]]], which it wears on its right ring finger.|| Stored in SCP-4056.||
||AVN-95412|| Subject lacks a physical body and appears as a brain suspended in an unknown fluid within a seemingly indestructible tank. Behaves and speaks similar to baseline Dr. Gears|| In Site-17 storage. ||
||AVN-1221|| Subject physically appears similar to Dr. Gears, but moves stiffly and often speaks in non-sequiturs. Closer examinations of the subject indicate it is an autonomous robot installed with a presumably faulty AI, which is suspected to be the reason behind the subject's unusual speech patterns.|| In Site-17 storage. ||
|| AVN-966315|| No anomalous properties. Subject deemed closest to baseline Dr. Gears.|| In Site-17 confinement.||


**Addendum SCP-4056.3:** AVN-966315 was awoken from its cryostasis because it appeared to be one of the SCP-4056 instance that was closest to baseline Dr. Gears. The following interview took place between Dr. Gears and AVN-966315 to attempt to gain understanding into the purpose of SCP-4056.

> **Gears:** Afternoon.
> 
> **AVN-966315:** Afternoon, Dr. Gears.
> 
> **Gears:** Do you know where you've been recovered from?
> 
> **AVN-966315:** No. All I know is that, wherever I was being taken, it was for my own good. She'd awaken me when, and I quote, the coast was clear.
> 
> **Gears:** Why do you think this?
> 
> **AVN-966315:** Because that's what your daughter told me before the sedative kicked in. 
> 
> **Gears:** I must correct you, but I can assure you that whoever kidnapped you was not my daughter.
> 
> **AVN-966315:** Is this not your home dimension?
> 
> **Gears:** She did not come from here. We don't know where she came from, yet.
> 
>  **AVN-966315:** Regardless, she is still Allison.
> 
> **Gears:** She has been labeled PoI-4056 and is currently being investigated by the Foundation and is believed to be actively working to endanger its personnel. She is not my daughter and is likely not yours either. 
> 
> **AVN-966315:** Maybe not yours, or mine, but someone like us. And I know that I raised my Allison to be honest with her parents.
> 
> //[There is a 10-second silence as Doctor Gears takes notes.]//
> 
> **Gears:** Have you interacted with any other individuals sharing our identity?
> 
> **AVN-966315:** I have not.
> 
> **Gears:** Just Al... PoI-4056.
> 
> **AVN-966315:** Yes.
> 
> **Gears:** And you trust her?
> 
> **AVN-966315:** My daughter would not lie to me. And yours?
> 
> //[There is a 5-second pause.]//
> 
> **Gears:** She would not.
> 
> **AVN-966315:** Then we are in agreement.
> 
> **Gears:** That will conclude this interview.

**Addendum 4056.4:** Following the interview with AVN-966315, Dr. Gears authorized Operation ICEBOX.  MTF Alpha-99 "Fridge Raiders", led by Dr. Clef and Dr. Gears, were stationed at SCP-4056 in an attempt to ambush and capture PoI-4056X. On September 8th, 2049, PoI-4056 appeared, and Operation ICEBOX commenced.

> **Delta 5:** Hands up, lady!
> 
> **Echo 12:** Alpha, this is Echo 12, we found her! Track our signal!

> **Dr. Gears:** I have alerted our forces on-location. They will arrive shortly. I suggest you immediately surrender yourself. 
> 
> **PoI-4056:** Whatever. You coming here saves me a bunch of time.  I don't have a lot of time to explain but if you just trust me on this I can explain lat-
> 
> **Dr. Gears:** I am afraid that I refuse to go quietly.
> 
> **PoI-4056:** While I’m not surprised you'd say that, you don’t carry weapons on you so it’ll be hand to hand, I’m stronger and faster, so I’ll get the better of you. We've done this before and you've never come out on top.

> 
> **PoI-4056:** ... dad?
> 
> //[Dr. Gears fires, and then immediately drops the stun gun. PoI-4056 staggers, attempting to escape before falling. MTF Alpha-99 seizes and constrains PoI-4056.]//
> 
> **Dr. Gears:** Shit... shit!

> **<END LOG>**

Doctor Gears refused to comment on his interaction with PoI-4056 following here detainment. Foundation records indicate Doctor Gears' daughter, Allison Chao, died in a vehicle collision with her mother[[footnote]] Doctor Gears' wife[[/footnote]] in December of 2019.

**Addendum 4056.05:** Following the capture of PoI-4056, an interview was held by Dr. Gears to attempt to gain insight into the assailant's actions. PoI-4056 is being temporarily contained at Site-17 until a sufficiently secure containment cell is constructed at Site-34.

> **<BEGIN LOG>**
> 
> **Dr. Gears:** Greetings.
> 
> **PoI-4056:** Hi... dad.
> 
> **Dr. Gears:** Why do you call me this? 
> 
> **PoI-4056:** Well, even over all the different multiverses, you don't change all that much. I mean, the version of you from my universe has a little more hair on his head, but that's the biggest difference. I guess it just feels the same.
> 
> **Dr. Gears:** I would appreciate it if you refrained from referring to me as a family member. 
> 
> **PoI-4056:** Fine. You have questions I assume?
> 
> **Dr. Gears:** Why did you attempt to capture me?
> 
> **PoI-4056:** To save you.
> 
> **Dr. Gears:** Save me from what?
> 
> **PoI-4056:** I don't fucking know! There's so much terrible shit that goes on here that I could be saving you from. Being lobotomized, spending eternity in a nightmare slumber, probably something else? 
> 
> **Dr. Gears:** But you were not saving me from a known threat.
> 
> **PoI-4056:** No... but— no. There was nothing //known//.
> 
> **Dr. Gears:** And I infer from this that the facility we found in the north was a where you gathered other versions of me that you saved?
> 
> **PoI-4056:** Yes. Well, I didn't gather them all myself. I had help.
> 
> **Dr. Gears:** From other versions of you?
> 
> **PoI-4056:** Yes.
> 
> **Dr. Gears:** Why are you trying to save versions of me?
> 
> **PoI-4056:** I— What kind of a question is that?
> 
> **Dr. Gears:** I do not understand what vested interest you have in keeping me, or any other versions of me alive. If they are as similar to me as you say, they most likely lived lives detached from you.
> 
> **PoI-4056:** I mean... you're not wrong but... like— it's more than just that! 
> 
> **Dr. Gears:** Could you please elaborate?
> 
> **PoI-4056:** I don't want you to die! Or... or something worse! I've saved other versions of you from being locked up inside their own head, unable to communicate with the rest of the world. Another one I saved from being enslaved by a world of mutants. Or being digested forever in the stomach of a giant fucking bird! Just suffering. Forever. Which might happen to you now. I don't want my dad to live out his life as a brain in a fucking trash bag.
> 
> **Dr. Gears:** But I am not your father.
> 
> **PoI-4056:** But you're still... you're still him. You still have your own Allison. I don't want to see you suffer just like how she wouldn't want to see you suffer.
> 
> **Dr. Gears:** //[While continuing to take notes]// Actually, my daughter died with her mother in a car crash before the advent of Omega-k. 
> 
> **PoI-4056:** Oh... I see. That's why this universe wasn't responding to our communication...
> 
> //PoI-4056 looks into her lap as Gears finishes writing.//
> 
> **Dr. Gears:** I believe that is all I have for today.
> 
> **PoI-4056:** So, you're going to keep me here, right?
> 
> **Dr. Gears:** That is what we are supposed to do.
> 
> **PoI-4056:** Your own daughter.
> 
> **Dr. Gears:** You are not baseline, and technically, you are not my daughter.
> 
> **PoI-4056:** Heh, yeah. I guess I'm not. It'd be foolish for me to expect much else from you anyways.
> 
> **Dr. Gears:** Indeed. And as per standard Foundation protocol for humanoid anomalies, we'll have to build for you a social regimen with regular check-ups.
> 
> //[PoI-4056 nods.]//
> 
> **Dr. Gears:** As the lead on this project, that means that I'll be the one performing the weekly interviews.
> 
> **PoI-4056:** You're coming back?
> 
> **Dr. Gears:** I'll see you in seven days, Allison.
