title:Log of Anomalous Ducks

[[module Rate]]
[[/>]]
**Note:** Following Incident F-19██ and the recovery of [[[SCP-1356]]], Research Sector-09 was charged the evaluation and containment of resultant anomalies. Testing is ongoing, as relevant subjects are still being retrieved. Those items which display anomalous characteristics of a disruptive or exceptional nature, but not to a degree which merits further study or containment, are catalogued in this document. 

Unless otherwise specified, effects have only been observed to apply to subjects in physical contact with the object. Status of "missing" most likely indicates that item is in personnel possession. Newly identified items should be catalogued accordingly.

> **Duck Description:** Generic rubber duck, equipped with tiny sunglasses. When placed in floating depth of water, object replicates itself rapidly. Copies proceed to "swarm" any human similarly accessorized. (See Incident Report Zeke [http://www.scp-wiki.net/local--files/log-of-anomalous-ducks/DuckAttack.jpg WACDS-845].) 
> **Note:** //Removal of the original object (designated Duck-Zero) from water renders all spawned ducks inert.//
> **Status:** Stored
|| **Note 2:** //While copies of Duck Zero appear to have no anomalous properties themselves, distribution among staff as party favors is henceforth prohibited.//||

[[image duck6.jpeg width="90px"]] 
[[/div]] 
|| **Duck Description:** Identical to non-anomalous rubber ducks in design and composition; however, when left unattended in a room, item always appears in a location different from where it was originally placed. ||

[[image duck8.jpeg width="70px"]]
[[/div]] 
|| **Duck Description:** Despite being subject to the prolonged exposure to sunlight and seawater shared by all such anomalies, subject emits strong scent-- described by researchers as "artificial blueberry"; PVC composition contains no trace of any chemical sufficient to produce this scent. ||

[[/div]] 
|| **Duck Description:** Object is sun-bleached in the manner of other, non-anomalous variations; however, a pattern of zebra stripes were observed to appear after retrieval.

[[image duck10.jpg width="80px"]] 
[[/div]] 
|| **Duck Description:** Appears to be patterned after London landmark "Big Ben"; when placed in a room with any analog clock, clock will promptly align with GMT London time. On the hour, object emits a bell tone via unknown mechanism; volume of this bell tone has been informally estimated "as loud as the real thing". ||   
|| **Notes:** //Security footage dated to 3/11, 4:12am, reveals that object was destroyed by personnel; no official reprimand pending// ||
**Status:** Destroyed

|| **Duck Description:** When held by male subject, duck will be invariably described by the individual as strikingly similar to a female of subject's acquaintance.
