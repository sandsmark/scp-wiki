title:Log of Anomalous Ducks
[[>]]
[[module Rate]]
[[/>]]
**Note:** Following Incident F-19██, Research Sector-09 was charged the evaluation and containment of resultant anomalies. Testing is ongoing, as relevant subjects are still being retrieved. Those items which display anomalous characteristics of a disruptive or exceptional nature, but not to a degree which merits further study or containment, are catalogued in this document. 

Unless otherwise specified, effects have only been observed to apply to subjects in physical contact with the object. Status of "missing" most likely indicates that item is in personnel possession. Newly identified items should be catalogued accordingly.[[footnote]] [[Collapsible show="Form for New Additions" hide="-copy code directly from page"]]

|| **Duck Description:** Identical to non-anomalous rubber ducks in design and composition; however, when left unattended in a room, item always appears in a location different from where it was originally placed. ||

[[/div]] 
|| **Duck Description:** While duck does not appear to possess any clinically-acknowledged healing or painkilling properties, if held by a subject suffering from minor or significant injury, subject will subsequently find all injuries covered with a proportionate number of bandaids, regardless of the nature of the wound ||

[[/div]] 
|| **Duck Description:** Despite being subject to the prolonged exposure to sunlight and seawater shared by all such anomalies, subject emits strong scent-- described by researchers as "artificial blueberry"; PVC composition contains no trace of any chemical sufficient to produce this scent. ||

[[/div]] 
|| **Duck Description:** Object is sun-bleached in the manner of other, non-anomalous variations; however, a pattern of zebra stripes were observed to appear after retrieval.

[[/div]] 
|| **Duck Description:** Appears to be patterned after London landmark "Big Ben"; when placed in a room with any analog clock, clock will promptly align with GMT London time. On the hour, object emits a bell tone via unknown mechanism; volume of this bell tone has been informally estimated "as loud as the real thing". ||

|| **Duck Description:** When held by male subject, duck will be invariably described by the individual as strikingly similar to a female of subject's acquaintance.
