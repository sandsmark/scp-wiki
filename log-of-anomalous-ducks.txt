**Note:** Following Incident F-19██ and the recovery of [[[SCP-1356]]], Research Sector-09 was charged the evaluation and containment of resultant anomalies. Testing is ongoing, as relevant subjects are still being retrieved. Those items which display anomalous characteristics of a disruptive or exceptional nature, but not to a degree which merits further study or containment, are catalogued in this document. 

Unless otherwise specified, effects have only been observed to apply to subjects in physical contact with the object. Status of "missing" most likely indicates that item is in personnel possession. Newly identified items should be catalogued accordingly.

Object Classes: Keter

 [[image ghostduck]] 
**Duck Description:** Object has the appearance of a duck wearing a sheet, similar to a simplistic Halloween ghost costume. Duck has been observed to float 5-7cm above solid and liquid surfaces.
**Notes:** //Attempts to weight the object down result in duck phasing through solid materials.// 
**Status:** Stored

------

[[image candyduck]] 
**Duck Description:** Object is a tri-colored rubber duck with the coloration and scent of a popular Halloween candy. Subjects in close proximity to the duck express a strong desire to taste it.
**Notes:** //Taste described as "disappointing".// 
**Status:** Stored

[[image saxduck]] 
**Duck Description:** Object appears to be a duck holding a small saxophone, which it has been observed to "play" at random intervals-- emitting a single, drawn-out note followed by a series of melodically unrelated notes.  
 **Notes:** //Sounds produced by duck are significantly shriller than those produced by a traditional saxophone.// 
**Status:** Destroyed

------

[[image goldduck]] 
**Duck Description:** Item appears to convince any individual holding it that it is a duck made of solid gold, despite appearance suggesting spray-painted PVC surface. Materials tests inconclusive. 
**Notes:** //See Incident Report M████-4// 
**Status:** Destroyed

------

[[image hatduck]]
 **Duck Description:** Generic rubber duck design with the addition of a fuzzy green hat. Any subject holding this object perceives every living organism in their line of sight to be wearing a similar fuzzy green hat. 
**Notes:** //Effects so far observed in humans, insects, animals of known and unknown species, organic SCPs, and several species of plant and fungi// 
**Status:** Missing

------

[[image loveduck]]
**Duck Description:** Duck-shaped object affects the romantic feelings of human subject holding it. Subjects will be convinced the object is a "love charm", and persist in this belief regardless of any arising evidence to the contrary.
**Notes:** //Status as cognitohazard pending review.// 
**Status:** --Missing-- Stored

------

[[image willotheduck]] 
**Duck Description:** Identical to non-anomalous rubber ducks in design and composition-- however, when left unattended in a room, item always appears in a location different from where it was originally placed. 
**Note:** //Reports of uneasiness in the presence of this anomaly may warrant further testing. Duck's whereabouts should be promptly reported.// 
**Status:** Missing

------

[[image firstaidduck]] 
**Duck Description:** While duck does not appear to possess any clinically significant healing or painkilling properties, if held by a subject suffering from minor or significant injury, subject will subsequently find injured areas covered with a proportionate number of band-aids, regardless of the nature of the wound.
**Notes:** //Item is available to all personnel for use, provided it is eventually returned to Room 204 first aid kit.// 
**Status:** Stored

------

[[image blueduck]] 
**Duck Description:** Despite its prolonged exposure to sunlight and seawater, object emits strong scent described by researchers as "artificial blueberry". PVC composition contains no trace of any chemical sufficient to produce this scent. 
**Notes:** //Personnel have reported that close proximity of the object notably affects the taste of food and beverages.// 
**Status:** Stored

------

[[image zebraduck]] 
**Duck Description:** Object is sun-bleached in the manner of other, non-anomalous ducks, but with a pattern of zebra stripes that appeared after retrieval.

**Notes:** //Object's whereabouts are proving easily detectable.// 
**Status:** --Missing-- (//see note//)

[[image bigbenduck]] 
**Duck Description:** Appears to be patterned after London landmark "Big Ben". When placed in a room with any analog clock, clock will promptly align with GMT London time.

**Notes:** //Security footage dated to 3/11, 4:12 am, reveals that object was destroyed by personnel; no official reprimand pending.// 
**Status:** Destroyed

------

[[image flirtyduck]] 
**Duck Description:** When held by male subject, duck will be invariably described by the individual as strikingly similar to a female of subject's acquaintance.

**Notes:** //Object has no observable effect on female personnel.//
**Status:** Stored

------

[[image normalduck]] 
**Duck Description:** --There does not appear to be anything anomalous about this duck.--
