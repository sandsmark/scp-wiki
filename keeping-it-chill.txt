title:Keeping it Chill With Your Homies Down at The SCP Foundation
**Doctor Rosen:** Please grab a seat, thank you for coming in today. We're going to show you one of the videos we made as part of our public... public image restoration campaign. For those who were unaware, ever since Linda Ray, that undercover reporter from Crackle News leaked information regarding our use and treatment of D-Class personnel to the public, we've been trying to fix our image. We especially want to gear this towards the children, as they're going to be growing up in a world where the anomalous exists, and we control it. Now, I can tell you, this video isn't going to be easily understandable, but that's because we had some younger staff members write it, in the hopes that it will resonate with a more vibrant audience. For your viewing pleasure, "Keeping it Chill With Your Homies Down at the SCP Foundation."

//Hip-Hop music begins playing, as an animated SCP logo spirals into the center of the screen. The text "Keeping it Chill With Your Homies Down at the SCP Foundation," sparkles into view, around the logo. The screen fades into an outdoor setting, with a heavily graffiti-ed brick wall in the background. Two men enter from either edge of the screen, wearing baggy lab coats over colorful tee-shirts, alongside athletic shorts, Nike socks and sneakers, and most notably, generic blue baseball caps, worn with their rims facing backwards.//

**Doctor Chandler Wentworth:** Wuzzup, party people? I'm Foundation Researcher, Chaz Wentworth!

**Site Director Douglas Robertson:** And I'm his friend, Bobby-Doug! And together we are...

//Director Robertson and Dr. Wentworth each cross their arms, and lean against each other, facing out towards the camera, and either side of the screen.//

**Both in Unison:** The "Supah Cool Peeps"!!!

**Dr. Wentworth:** Today, Bobby-Doug and I want to talk to you kids about a lit organization made to keep all of you safe and able to go about your normal lives!

**Director Robertson:** That's right, Chaz! A lot of people have been saying some mean things about SCP that makes us very sad, but we want to tell you that it's all a bunch of yucky baloney! In fact, let me tell you guys a secret. The SCP foundation has stopped the world from ending like 800 times! That's more than I can count on both my hands!

**Dr. Wentworth:** How crazy cool is that? It makes me want to...

**Both in Unison:** Hit that da-da-da-daaaabbbbb!!!!

//Director Robertson and Dr. Wentworth each make their own shabby attempt at executing a popular dance move known as the "dab," wherein the performer points their flattened palms face down, and out to one direction, allowing their outermost armpit to come in contact with their lowered face.//

**Director Robertson:** But seriously, squad. The SCP Foundation tries its very hardest to make everyone on earth safer, by containing and securing dangerous or weird stuff.

**Dr. Wentworth:** Of course, that doesn't mean weird is a bad thing, but we wouldn't want something anomalous walking around, would we?

**Director Robertson:** Whoa there Chaz, nice use of the word "Anomalous". Do you kids know what "Anomalous" means? I could tell you myself, but I think I have a very good friend who would love to tell you instead! Come on in, 999!

//Dr. Rosen, wearing a large foam costume reminiscent of [[[SCP-999]]], shambles on screen.//

**Dr. Rosen:** Hiya kids, I'm SCP-999, and I love helping people! I want to help you by teaching you a big word. "Anomalous". That's A-N-O-M-A-L-O-U-S! Something is anomalous when it does not follow the general rules of normal society! Now, would a criminal be considered anomalous, since they do not follow the rules? Certainly! However, we're using it to mean something a little different. Here, the word anomalous means something that doesn't make any sense. Like myself! I am anomalous, because I am a living blob of slime!

**Dr. Wentworth:** Wow, that's a great description, 999! Thanks so much for coming!

**Dr. Rosen:** Oh, my pleasure Chand... I mean uhh, Chaz!

//Doctor Rosen turns, and begins to walk off screen. In the process, a large chunk of foam breaks off of the costume, and lands on the floor. He quickly bends down to remove it, and falls forward. Director Robertson helps him up, and ushers him out of the viewing area.//

**Director Robertson:** Now that you know what anomalous means, let's talk a little about some of the anomalous things we have at the foundation, and why our work is so important! Why just the other day, I had an interesting chat with [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2337 a crazy little bird who just loves to yell]. Chaz, what's something anomalous you saw this week, that you think the kids would want to hear about?

**Dr. Wentworth:** Bobby, I know just the thing. Last thursday, I was in charge of a monthly event with [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4252 SCP-4252], one of the resident anomalies here at Site-96. SCP-4252 is this wacky room full of - you won't believe this - baked beans! The room fills up with baked beans every month, and then we summon a magical bean leprechaun with a spell! And, wanna know the craziest part? He eats all the beans right there and then! And if you think I'm trying to fool ya, you'd be sorely mistaken.

**Director Robertson:** Ha, that is a really fire one, Chaz. One of my favorites. But, sadly, fam, a lot of the anomalies we keep are actually hecka mean, and don't like us. Our biggest job is to keep you all safe from them, but for some reason, haters keep telling us we are bad and we should destroy our company, and it makes us so sad.

**Dr. Wentworth:** But here's the thing, home-slices. We actually do a ton of great things for humanity as a whole. We [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4946 eradicated dysentery], [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4589 kept a fungal disaster from spreading], and we've trapped countless monsters who, without our help, would probably be hurting a lot of people right now.

**Director Robertson:** Now, I think it's about time we talk about the thing you all want to know about: D-Class Personnel. Here at the SCP Foundation, we get help from our epic D-Classes to test out the anomalous effects of various creatures and places that we want to know more about. In fact, we have someone you might want to meet. Come on out!

//A man in an orange jumpsuit walks slowly onto screen and stands in between Director Robertson and Dr. Wentworth. He is visibly uncomfortable.//   

**D-13745:** Uhhh... hi. I'm D-13745, but you can call me Derek. I uhh... I used to be a bad guy, I stole a bunch of stuff and injured some people trying to escape, but I got caught. I was in jail for 4 years before the SCP Foundation offered me a job. I've been here for like 2 weeks, and uhh... it's better than jail. Other than [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2496 taking a science test] and [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4281 talking to some old dude in a bathroom], I've just been chilling.

**Dr. Wentworth:** D-13745, is your life better now that you've become a D-Class Personnel?

**D-13745:** I mean, I guess. You know, I'm still not free, but at least I feel like I have a purpose. You know?

**Director Robertson:** Terrific. Well, thanks for Netflix and Chilling with us, D-13745, that was really swag of you!

**D-13745:** That doesn't... yeah okay whatever.

//D-13745 exits.//

**Director Robertson:** See kids, D-Class Personnel are actually treated great at the SCP Foundation! We take them out of prisons where they don't want to be, and let them stay with us, as long as they help with a few science experiments.

**Dr. Wentworth:** And yes, sometimes the experiments are dangerous, but we do them because we want you dope peeps to be chillin on Earth for a long long time, and if we didn't have our D-Friends to test stuff for us, we might not have enough information to keep everyone safe!

//A 1940's cartoon era "Aooga" sound effect is audible.//

**Director Robertson:** Well, fam, that's our cue to leave you guys alone. But I hope you dudes and dudettes keep everything we said in mind. And remember, as long as you focus hard and get a lot done, you, too, can save the world!

//Dr. Wentworth and Director Robertson wave at the screen, as it fades to black.//
