++++ Notice from the Records And Information Security Administration

As of 12/13/15, the database entry for SCP-2827 has been rewritten 73 times due to massive database corruption. While the possibility of tampering or sabotage has not been ruled out, it is currently believed that information about SCP-2827 is inherently unstable and subject to unpredictable, erratic changes. Although no major cognitohazards have been associated with this entry, it is advised that you proceed with caution.

**Item #:** SCP-2827 ##FFFFFF|Leviticus 11:12##

**Object Class:** [Pending]

**Special Containment Procedures:** Provisional Exclusion Zone-2827 has been established in a 3km radius around SCP-2827's current location, using a hazardous waste disposal area as a front.

Further containment procedures cannot be enacted until more information is known about SCP-2827. As such, research is to continue as a Delta-class priority to the Foundation.

**Description:** SCP-2827 is an entity that currently inhabits a 2m^^2^^ plot of grass. It is unpredictably variable in its abilities, size, mass, radioactivity, sentience, sapience, toxicity, mobility, speed, hostility, and other qualities. 

43 separate tests have been conducted by the Foundation to determine the properties SCP-2827, which resulted in 13 fatalities of researchers (as well as [REDACTED] fatalities of D-class personnel). As such, Dr. Jacobs, PEZ-2827 Site Director, has determined only two consistent factors regarding the nature of SCP-2827:
# SCP-2827 possesses anomalous destructive capabilities.
# The physical appearance of SCP-2827 is that of a member of the Nephropidae family of crustaceans, also known as lobsters. (The exact species of lobster is indeterminable at this time.)

Further information regarding SCP-2827 has yet to be determined, pending research.

**Partial Activity Log:**

On 2/24/14 at 12:39 PM, SCP-2827 displayed signs of physical discomfort. At the same time, a sealed envelope was discovered in the Director's office at PEZ-2827. Within the envelope was a letter containing three similar (but not identical) separate messages written in Swedish, French, and English:

[[code]]Jag ber om ursäkt för de problem jag har orsakat. 
Det är en lögn.

Jag försäkrar två utmaningar , eftersom ni alla är svag:

1. Jag kommer alltid att vara en hummer.
2. Jag är sjuk - snålla hjälp mig.

Avguda mig.

-----

Je n'apprécie pas les problèmes que vous avez apportés sur moi. 
Je continue à apprendre comment exister.

Il y a seulement deux choses que je peux garantir pour le futur:

1. Je serai toujours un homard.
2. Je vais tous vous tuer.

Vas au diable.

-----

I am sorry for the trouble that I've caused you. 
I'm still getting the hang of this "magic" thing.

Here are my laws:

1. I will always be a hermit crab.
2. I am hungry.

See you soon.[[/code]]

--**Item #:** SCP-2827--
##FFFFFF|Hello?##
--**Object Class:** Explained--
##FFFFFF|Can anyone hear me?##
--**Special Containment Procedures:** You're all fucking insane.--
##FFFFFF|I no longer have any idea what I am doing.##
--**Description:** Sometimes a lobster is just a lobster.--
##FFFFFF|Nothing I say is staying in one place. Every effort I make to put the pieces back together only tears reality apart further. There's only so much I can do with these damnable claws.##

##FFFFFF|I make no excuses for what I have done, but this experiment has long since gone out of my control. With any luck, my suffering will be over soon -- and with it, yours.##

##FFFFFF|For what it's worth, I am very sorry. If you would be so kind as to find a way to kill me, I would be most grateful.##
