**Item #:** SCP-047

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:*** SCP-047 is to be contained in a 0.5m x 0.5m x 1m hermetically sealed storage box at all times. This box is to be locked in storage locker 047a, inside P3-secure biohazard lab 047b. Any entrance to and activity inside 047b will be recorded by biometric scan, closed circuit camera, and [REDACTED].

Entry to 047b requires the authorization of the project manager, in addition to at least one O5 level clearance. SCP-047 is to be treated as a Priority 4 Contagious Biohazard in all protocols, including mandatory quarantine if exposed. Suite q047 has been provided, adjunct to lab 047b, for this purpose.

In the event of outside contamination of SCP-047-1, Lockdown Protocol 047-01 "Yersinia" must be engaged.

|| **Critical Containment Breach Alert:** Protocol 047-01 Yersinia is currently in operation. All involved staff are required to read [[[Operation Yersinia-047-01-2010]]]. ||

**Description:** SCP-047 is a heavily rusted, breached gas cylinder made of an iron-[REDACTED] alloy. When exposed to open air, the material of the cylinder evaporates slowly, producing a previously undocumented mutagenic gas. This gas has no effect on eukaryotic organisms (eg. humans), but profoundly alters prokaryotes, showing preference for common human microbiota - the natural microorganisms that live on the skin and throughout the body. Most of these mutations are fatal to the prokaryote affected; however, an estimated one in ten thousand mutations produces a "superbug" (collectively known as SCP-047-1), a natural commensal with enhanced survivability and therefore opportunistic pathogenicity. The pattern of changes induced by SCP-047 suggests that these highly infectious microbes are, at least to some degree, selected for.

Although the specifics of SCP-047-1 species are dependent on the base bacterium from which it is derived, there are several characteristics which appear to be generally consistent across all cases of SCP-047-1 mutation:
* Enhanced survivability in the bacterium's natural environment and similar environments;
* Full spectrum antibiotic resistance;
* Increased reproduction rate and consumption of available material;
* Development of a sporulation ability in gram positive bacteria;
* Increased ability to uptake, hold, and share plasmids, particularly in gram negative bacteria;
* Increased transmission, due to traits described above.

**Recovery Log 047:** SCP-047 was recovered from the Site-██ Secure Laboratory by a Foundation Biohazard Recovery Team in response to a full compromise situation on ██/██/199█. Testing logs indicate that the research team was attempting to contain [DATA EXPUNGED] in a class-██ SCP-stable pressure cylinder, which lead to [REDACTED] combining with [REDACTED]. A full molecular biological analysis of this is available in [REDACTED]. The initial release of gas when SCP-047 was structurally compromised was sufficient to cause a microbiotal "bloom" of uncounted species of SCP-047-1, killing all staff in the lab within █ hours. Exposed site-██ staff obeyed standard Foundation quarantine/containment protocol, and the infection was contained successfully.
