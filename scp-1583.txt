**Item #:** SCP-1583

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-1583 are to be held in individual pressurized containment units, located within Area-896. All chambers are fitted with devices preventing the SCP-1583 instances lids from opening. All instances of SCP-1583 must be held down with at least 14 MPa being pressed at all times. In the event that a containment breach event occurs within the Foundation or other groups, the pressure being placed upon SCP-1583 instances must increase by 60% for each confirmed breach.

Foundation liaisons monitoring the "Global Occult Coalition" group of interest will report any movement or activity from sites confirmed to hold SCP-1583 instances. If the possibility arises to seize an instance from one of these locations, it should be acted upon immediately. Currently, the Foundation has contained 31 instances of SCP-1583.

**Description:** SCP-1583 designates an aluminum barrel designed for use in fallout shelters, built by the U.S government at some point between 1960 and 1973. The exteriors contains the information originally printed on them, in addition to this notice:

[[=]]
> **Notice From Department of Defend**
> 
> This device can be used in your shelter or other places of refuge, to protect yourselves and your families from the horror of nuclear warfare. Simply enter your family into the shelter of choice, and open your container. Safety will follow. You will be protected and comforted with your family bit by bit, held safely until every other seeker of comfort is too. Then, we come out, rebuilding a burned world together. Blood and stone, flesh to wood, sweat and concrete. Build in your image.

When opened, instances of SCP-1583 will release thin, white threadlike organisms, which will bind together in order to form a large appendage. SCP-1583 will attempt to seize living subjects and bring them within its mass. Following this, the threadlike portions of its mass will disassemble the subject's body. Outer epidermis will be destroyed within 14 seconds of contact, followed by muscles and other tissue. The subject's skeletal structure will slowly dissolve over a period of 2-3 hours.

There is no observed limit to the quantity of this mass SCP-1583 is capable of releasing, with containment breaches in [REDACTED] reaching almost 600 meters above the instance. This organism is capable of opening SCP-1583 on its own, if there is nothing preventing it from exiting on the other side. 

These entities are possible to destroy through application of extreme heat, but if additional instances of SCP-1583 breach containment or if containment of other organizations fail, the energy required to neutralize SCP-1583 entities increases. In addition, the mass and speed of emergence has increased over time, currently being at 200 kilograms of matter every 15 seconds. 4 instances of SCP-1583 have been destroyed by the Foundation since initial containment.

If an instance of SCP-1583 is opened, the pressure exerted by the organisms within all other SCP-1583 instances will increase by 60%, requiring additional pressure to prevent containment breaches. This new increase in force will be permanent, and no way of reducing or removing it has been found. The destruction of emergent SCP-1583 entities has been found to have no effect on the new forces produced by other instances of SCP-1583.

SCP-1583 was recovered on 9/19/1989, after an SCP-1583 entity breached from an instance stored within the [REDACTED] campus. Foundation agents were able to destroy the entity, and contain 20 instances of SCP-1583. During this time, SCP-1583 was classified as Euclid and contained within Site-77. However, approximately 6 months into containment, an uncontained instance was apparently breached, causing significant damage to Site-77. SCP-1583 reclassified as Keter.

**Addendum:** On 11/15/1999, Foundation assets were able to confirm that the GOC possessed instances of SCP-1583. The GOC is believed to have breached one instance in a 1990 destruction attempt, which caused the initial reclassification to Keter. Locations believed to posses additional instances of SCP-1583 put under close observation.

**Addendum:** GOC assets have attempted to destroy 2 instances of SCP-1583 in their possession, resulting in the confirmation of several facilities suspected of holding SCP-1583 instances, in addition to the location of several previously unknown GOC facilities. The use of SCP-1583 as a counterintelligence device has been denied, due to the involved risk of containment.

**Addendum:** Documents recovered on 04/18/2013 regarding SCP-1583.

> ...lieve that destruction can be attained if the entity is removed from range of its attack, perhaps dropping it from a great height or into an immovable area. It is possible that area(...)fficient for this purpose. We believe that the simultaneous destruction of all objects in our possession will prevent the previous failure. They tried it one-at-a-time, which caused the remaining containers to become much more potent. We have them all now, and wont make the same mistake twice.
