**Item #:** SCP-517

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-517 is to be kept secured within Containment Locker 51164 in Storage Site-23, facing away from the doorway. A thick sheet is to be draped over the item at all times. Testing is currently prohibited, as nature of the manifestation invariably causes a low-level containment breach. If SCP-517-01 is triggered, personnel are instructed to report to their immediate superior to enact Protocol 517-001. 

**Description:** SCP-517 is a fortune telling machine. Item stands approximately 2 meters tall, containing a mechanical puppet and an electric candle within a glass and wooden case. Examination has shown an internal layout consistent with similar machines. On the top panels the words "Grandmother Predictions" are painted on built-in signage. The puppet within is in the shape of an elderly woman, with a white blouse and a blue shawl. Item's power cord has been been severed approximately 15 centimeters from its base; it appears to have been inexpertly separated from its original power source. No reaction occurs if a coin is inserted into the slot.

The item will energize automatically, once an hour, if an individual (hereafter the "Target") enters its field of vision. The puppet will turn to face directly at the Target, recite a short "fortune", and cease function. Process is fully mechanical, and item does not show signs of awareness. See Addendum for a transcript for examples of "fortunes".

The individual who "activated" SCP-517 will become the Target of an entity or number of entities who will attack at 1:43 AM local time the following morning. The Entity or Entities (hereby SCP-517-01) appear as a varying number of arms reaching from the bottom-most level of whatever structure the subject is within at that time, and will attempt to drag the Target to their point of origin and assault them until sunrise local time. 

At 1:43 AM, SCP-517-01 will appear in the lowest-elevation area within the vicinity of the Target and extend extremely rapidly towards it in an effort to assault them. Arms seem to be multi-jointed and fully corporeal, and will work to open doors and break locks to expose themselves. Furthermore, the entity will generate from multiple areas as if unable to immediately apprehend the target. In all instances, Target has been captured, dragged into SCP-517-01's point of origin, and been savagely beaten until sunrise. Entity has been documented maneuvering through ██ floors of an office building, drawing the Target through a sewage grate, and [EXPUNGED]. Attempts to intrude on this event will result in aggressors being drawn into the assault. To date there have been no survivors.

If more than one individual activates the item in the span of one day, all will become Targets of the following night's assault. Entity has also appeared from multiple areas while "hunting" multiple Targets. Pursuit has only ceased at sunrise.

Remote viewing of the expected point of origin of SCP-517-01 during testing revealed arms extending from points around corners and otherwise off-camera, eventually crowding out the video feed. Fragmented, unidentified human DNA has appeared in the areas utilized by SCP-517-01; ultimate origin are still currently unknown.
