**Item #:** SCP-517

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-517 is to be kept secured within Containment Locker 51164 in Storage Site-23, facing away from the doorway. A thick sheet is to be draped over the item at all times. Testing is currently prohibited, as nature of the manifestation invariably causes a low-level containment breach. If 517-01 is triggered, personnel are instructed to report to their immediate superior to enact Protocol 517-001. 

**Description:** SCP-517 is a fortune telling machine. Item stands approximately 2 meters tall, containing a mechanical puppet and an electric candle within a glass and wooden case. Examination has shown an internal layout consistent with similar machines. On the top panels the words "Grandmother Predictions" are painted on built-in signage. The puppet within is in the shape of an elderly woman, with a white blouse and a blue shawl. Item's power chord has been been severed approximately 15 centimeters from it's base; it appears to have been inexpertly separated from it's original power source. No reaction occurs if a coin is inserted into the slot.

The item will energize automatically, once an hour, if an individual (hereafter the "Target") enters it's field of vision. The puppet will turn to face directly at the Target, recite a short "fortune" and cease function. Process is fully mechanical, and item does not show signs of awareness. See Addendum for a transcript of the"fortune".

The individual who "activated" SCP-517 will become the Target of an entity or number of entities who will attack at 1:43 AM local time the following morning. The Entity or Entities (hereby 517-02) appear as a varying number of arms reaching from the bottom-most level of whatever structure the subject is within at that time, and will attempt to drag the Target to their point of origin and assault them until sunrise. 

At 1:43 AM, all doors within the shortest path between the Target and the point of origin of 517-02 will forcefully open. 517-02 will appear somewhere in the bottom level of the level of the structure occupied by the Target and rapidly extend towards it in an effort to assault them. If there are no lower basements, crawlspaces, or utility rooms, or Target is outdoors, Target will be dragged to the closest structure that is constructed below ground. Arms are multi-jointed and fully corporeal, and will reach as far as required to acquire their Target. In all instances, Target has been captured, rapidly dragged into 517-02's point of origin, and be savagely beaten until sunrise. Entity has been documented maneuvering through ██ floors of an office building, following a Target traveling inside a Foundation tactical vehicle up to ███ miles from point of origin, drawing the Target through a sewage grate, and following the Target into and through SCP-███. Attempts to intrude on this event will result in aggressors being drawn into the assault. Survivors capable of communication have reported only being able to remember the the scene of the assault as a blackened pit.

If more than one individual activate the item in the span of one day, all will become Targets of the following night's assault. Entity will appear from only one area while "hunting" multiple Targets.

Remote viewing of the expected point of origin of 517-02 during testing revealed arms extending from points around corners and otherwise off-camera, eventually crowding out the video feed. Fragmented, unidentified human DNA has appeared in the areas utilized by XXX-01; ultimate origin still currently unknown.
