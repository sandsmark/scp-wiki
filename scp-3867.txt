**Item #:** SCP-3867

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation web crawlers are to track and erase any mention of SCP-3867 on the internet. Artificial Intelligence Construct TSAT has been programmed to monitor the [[[the-dark-web-dke79-o2rg5-4jlw6|Dark Web]]] for any information relating to SCP-3867 or its creator(s).

**Description:** SCP-3867 is an anomalous website under the domain 'www.scpd.♡♡♡', named 'Sweet Cats & Perfect Dogs!'.

When visited, SCP-3867 will load a unique page displaying an image of its visitor's pet and describing the most recent actions taken by the subject of the image[[footnote]] Following extensive testing involving the surveillance of testing personnel's pets, the described actions were found to be accurate when not describing esoteric actions.[[/footnote]]. When visited by a subject without a dog or cat, SCP-3867 will instead display an image and the most recent actions taken by an animal available for adoption at the nearest animal shelter. Subjects will then be prompted to adopt the animal in question in order to 'experience these cute moments firsthand'.

Franklin just snored a little bit but didn't wake up. He seems to be dreaming about sleeping. What a lazy, lazy boy! Make sure to pet him as soon as you get home, he misses you and wants to sit next to you as you unwind!

Dexter is pretty sure he just saw something dart across the wall, but he thinks it might just be that weird bright thing he can never seem to catch. He decided that rather than waste his efforts in grabbing the sneaky culprit now, he's going to let things play out. Sorry Dexter, but that was just light coming in through the window!

If you like Dexter and want to experience such cuteness in person, you can adopt him from the Chattanooga Cat Rescue, where he is currently in a Foster Home!

Sommer's sunbathing was just interrupted by a raindrop. Uh oh, Sommer, you best find somewhere to hide before it really starts coming down! I hear underneath the porch it's nice and dry!

Nala wondered why her best friend was putting her in a sack, then wondered why she kept hearing all those funny noises, until she wondered why it was so hard to move all of a sudden. Nala stopped wondering after she stopped breathing.
