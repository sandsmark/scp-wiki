[[include component:image-block name=lostcatredacted.jpg| caption=An instance of SCP-5543-1 recovered from an uncontained event and cataloged.]]
**Item #:** SCP-5543

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Mobile Task Force Phi-20 ("Phi-do") personnel are to be embedded within population centers located inside SCP-5543's current area of effect. Personnel will be required to prepare for briefing each day at 04:30, local time. In the event that a distinct SCP-5543-1 Hume signature is detected, the nearest MTF personnel shall be dispatched to intercept the SCP-5543-1 instances. All recovered instances shall be scanned and cataloged. Instances are to then be destroyed via incineration.

If an SCP-5543-1 instance appears outside of the current known area of effect, any nearby Foundation agent shall receive emergency briefing and be tasked with collecting and documenting said instance. The known area of effect shall then be subsequently updated. 

If an SCP-5543-1 instance can't be destroyed before SCP-5543-2 can be contacted, personnel are to take custody of SCP-5543-A by necessary force until the SCP-5543 event spontaneously ceases. If an SCP-5543 event progresses to its second phase, owners of SCP-5543-A are to be taken into custody along with their reward money. Upon transmutation of reward money, appropriate cover stories will be fabricated and disseminated and Class-A Amnestics deployed as necessary. Owners are to be held until cognitohazard symptoms cease and are to receive appropriate therapy supplemented by low-level amnestics. 

**Description:** SCP-5543 is a phenomenon involving the anomalous manifestations of a series of lost pet fliers, collectively referred to as SCP-5543-1. On initial examination, the flier appears to be unremarkable in nature; it is printed on neon-colored paper (the exact color may vary between instances of SCP-5543-1), has an image of an animal, henceforth SCP-5543-A, and information regarding the supposed disappearance of SCP-5543-A along with a phone number to be called in the event of it being found. All flier text is written in English with no consistency in content between events except for the promise of a cash reward, ranging in value from a few US dollars to quantities exceeding the total value of currency currently in circulation at a global level. SCP-5543's first recorded event manifested in ████████ █████, Wisconsin and subsequent events have started to generate further from this epicenter at an indeterminate rate. The current area of effect has an estimated radius of 510 km. 

Instances of SCP-5543-1 will spontaneously appear in residential areas of population centers at approximately 08:30, local time. The exact method of SCP-5543-1 instances manifesting has not been determined and any witnesses of this event have stated that they do not find this manifestation in anyway abnormal. Continuous monitoring in affected areas has lead to the discovery that SCP-5543-1 instances emit a specific Hume level signature upon manifestation that can persist for approximately 3 hours.

An instance of SCP-5543-A is an animal currently under the care of an individual (henceforth referred to as "the owner") living within the area of effect. Presently, no criteria or patterns of selection for targets (both owner and SCP-5543-A instances) have been identified; analysis is ongoing (see Attachment-5543-1 for a sample of events).  

The first phase of an SCP-5543 event's primary effect commences upon the owner's visual recognition and comprehension[[footnote]]For example, if the owner cannot read English, they will remain unaffected.[[/footnote]] of an SCP-5543-1 instance. SCP-5543-1 represents a powerful cognitohazard toward the owner, along with anyone within the owner's household during the event. They will anomalously believe that SCP-5543-A rightfully belongs to SCP-5543-2. Owners affected by the cognitohazard presented by SCP-5543-1 will immediately take it home with them and dial the listed phone number. This phone number appears to be chosen at random, even if the number is already in use. When dialed by the owner, they are connected to SCP-5543-2, a sentient entity believed to be the source of SCP-5543 events. Owners have reported having a brief conversation over the phone with SCP-5543-2, who will arrange to meet the owner at their home the following evening at approximately 21:00, local time. At the designated time, a black 1942 Lincoln Continental convertible will spontaneously appear[[footnote]]This effect behaves in the same way as the manifestation of SCP-5543-1 instances.[[/footnote]] parked outside the owner's residence with SCP-5543-2 seated at the wheel. SCP-5543-2 will knock on the owner's door and enter their home once invited in. At this point, SCP-5543-1 will engage in conversation while the owner prepares to hand over SCP-5543-A. SCP-5543-2 will then present the cash reward to the owner in exchange for SCP-5543-A. If the quantity of currency is too great to be transported easily by a single person, the money will materialize inside the home of the owner.

Once the transaction is complete, SCP-5543-2 will return to its vehicle with SCP-5543-A and start the vehicle's engine. All efforts to track or apprehend SCP-5543-2 have failed, as the vehicle and its anomalous occupants will demanifest one second after the vehicle's engine starts. This marks the end of the first phase. If the transaction can't be completed by 00:00 the next day, or if the event is impeded until such time, all associated phenomena will spontaneously end.

At 05:00, local time on the following morning, the second phase of the SCP-5543 event will begin. The entirety of the rewarded currency will be inexplicably transmuted into biological material with a total mass equivalent to that of the original currency. DNA test results indicate that this biological material matches that of SCP-5543-A. If this conversion utilizes the entirety of SCP-5543-A's total mass, genetically similar biological material sourced from within a 80 km radius of the event will make up any remainder[[footnote]]For example, if a Chihuahua becomes an instance of SCP-5543-A, it will have its remains supplemented with those of other canines with a preference for other members of the Chihuahua breed[[/footnote]]. Most instances of biological material are mutilated with signs of mechanical separation. Despite the abnormality of this transmutation, the owner will accept the biological material as if it were still a form of currency. Owners under the effect of the second phase of SCP-5543 will display signs of acute paranoia and will become extremely protective of their "reward." They are often prone to episodes of seclusion dedicated to guarding the biological material. Amnestics have proven to be only a partially effective treatment at this stage. This mental state will persist for up to 3 weeks after the transmutation (though the event may leave behind long-lasting mental trauma), at which point, the SCP-5543 event is presumed to have concluded.

**Discovery:** Foundation agents were first alerted to abnormal events, now attributed to the SCP-5543 phenomenon, by reports originating from ████████ █████, Wisconsin during the summer of 199█. Local news organizations had begun covering possible cult activity in the area after the sudden disappearance of local feral cat colonies and the discovery of the remains of approximately ███ felines in the garage of a suburban family home. Foundation agents acquired all evidence from the crime scene and were able to obtain custody of two suspects. Interviews were conducted with both suspects, who were still partially affected by altered mental states associated with the second phase of SCP-5543 events. Through testing of acquired evidence and the subsequent occurrence of further SCP-5543 events, details provided by the subjects were corroborated.

**Addendum 01:** Incident Report #5543/20080823/01

Initially, MTF Phi-20 personnel tasked with SCP-5543 containment were each issued one lab rat with an implanted tracking chip for research purposes. This was done to potentially induce a SCP-5543 event with the MTF personnel as the target. Personnel's homes were fitted with adequate monitoring equipment to properly record an interaction with SCP-5543-2. The following is an excerpt from an audio recording collected from Incident #5543/20080823/01.

> **Excerpt of Audio Recording from Incident #5543/20080823/01**
> 
> **Subjects:** Agent B████████, SCP-5543-2
> 
> **Foreword:** Agent B████████ was under the influence of SCP-5543's cognitohazard properties (he was markedly more amicable while under these effects). The event was allowed to progress uninhibited and the results recorded. Visual recording devices experienced a malfunction for the duration of the event. Excerpt begins shortly after SCP-5543-2 is shown SCP-5543-A.

> **<Begin Excerpt, 2008/08/23 21:07 CST>**
> 
> **SCP-5543-2:** There's the little rascal! You know, I was going to name him "Alfalfa," after the Little Rascal, before I finally settled on SCP-5543-R-27[[footnote]]Agent B████████ chose not to name SCP-5543-R-27, reporting that it "was just a test subject."[[/footnote]]!
> 
> **Agent B████████:** I think I like SCP-5543-R-27 more. I can see why you picked it; it rolls right off the tongue!
> 
> //SCP-5543-R-27 can be heard enjoying recreational use of its running wheel.//
> 
> **SCP-5543-2:** Wow! Look at 'em go! He's really going bonkers! He's always been that way since I got 'em that wheel. And he's real smart, too! He can learn tricks! You should see him when [REDACTED][[footnote]]Here, SCP-5543-2 explains testing procedures involving SCP-5543-R-27 and SCP-████ in great detail. This represents a critical breach of sensitive information.[[/footnote]].
> 
> **Agent B████████:** That's quite the feat! Makes sense, though. He was able to sneak out on you, cage and all.
> 
> //Both SCP-5543-2 and Agent B████████ remain silent for 12 seconds, presumably to watch SCP-XXXX-R-27 in its running wheel.//
> 
> 
> **SCP-5543-2** Say, you're a real swell fella, Mr. B████████! I can't believe you live all on your lonesome. Maybe you use some of that moolah I gave ya to get yourself one of these fine rats!
> 
> **<End Excerpt, 2008/08/23 21:07 CST>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** During incident, SCP-5543-2 expressed knowledge of sensitive Foundation information. Agent B████████ was rewarded [REDACTED] as part of the transaction. SCP-5543-R-27 tracking chip stopped transmitting information at the moment of demanifestation associated with SCP-5543-2's departure. When reward money underwent transmutation, the entire population of lab mice at Site-██ was lost. Resulting biological material used to supplement D-Class food supply in an effort to cover the cost of training new lab rats for testing. Agent B████████ remarked that he felt like he "was having a little chit-chat with goddamn Mr. Rogers" while conversing with SCP-5543-2. Requisite amnestics and therapy were administered.  

Following the results of Incident #5543/20080823/01 and given the nature of the information breach, Site-██ Director firmly recommended that further testing involving SCP-5543 and Foundation property should be prohibited, citing the potential loss of valuable resources in test animals and the possibility of further informational breaches. This recommendation was accepted.

**Addendum 02:** Incident #5543/20140621/01

On June 21, 2014 at approximately 08:30 CST, an SCP-5543-1 instance in the form of a missing child poster was intercepted in ██████ County, Wisconsin. This is the first iteration of a human SCP-5543-A instance. Initial estimates place the loss of human life roughly equivalent to the population of █████████, Wisconsin had the event been allowed to progress. For this reason, MTF Phi-20 Commander has submitted a formal request for resources to be allocated for use in containing SCP-5543.
