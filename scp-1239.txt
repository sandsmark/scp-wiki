**Item #:** SCP-1239

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Site-███ has been established around SCP-1239-2. When not in use for testing, SCP-1239-1 and removable instances of SCP-1239-3 are to be kept outside of SCP-1239-2 in dedicated storage cells to prevent accidental activation. SCP-1239 should be soundproofed, with all windows obscured from the outside.

**Description:** SCP-1239 consists of three (3) components:

* SCP-1239-1, a lamp with a standard low voltage power cable, containing artificial flora with four (4) flower-like lightbulbs. The words “Hey Kids!” are engraved on the lid.

* SCP-1239-2, an area occupied by a residence in ██████████, ███████.

* SCP-1239-3, a number of objects present within SCP-1239-2 at time of recovery.

The anomalous effects of SCP-1239 manifest if SCP-1239-1 is powered and viewed by a post-pubescent human subject while both are within SCP-1239-2. Following this, the subject will evidently experience a series of conditional hallucinations until exiting SCP-1239-2, as follows:

* Subjects will perceive samples of SCP-1239-3 as unrelated objects. This is apparently consistent between subjects, as all subjects tested have misperceived respective SCP-1239 samples in the same way.[[footnote]]For an extensive list of SCP-1239 samples and their respective hallucinated appearances, please refer to Document 1239-B[[/footnote]] Objects present within SCP-1239-2 other than SCP-1239-3 will not be subject to this.

* Subjects will perceive any children present within SCP-1239-2 as highly amiable, despite prior dispositions, and will repeatedly experience invitations to take part in play activities.

* Subjects will perceive expressions of discomfort, pain or displeasure produced by pre-pubescent and pubescent subjects within SCP-1239-2 as expressions of pleasure or enjoyment.

Upon exiting SCP-1239, the hallucinatory symptoms caused by exposure to SCP-1239-1 will cease, and the subject will forget experiencing them (i. e., the subject will remember observing SCP-1239 samples according to their actual description, and will be unable to recall them according to the hallucinations caused by SCP-1239). Behaviour caused indirectly by SCP-1239, however, will be recalled with an expected degree of detail. As a result of this, subjects will be unable to recall the motivation for their actions.

**Summarised Recovery Log:** SCP-1239 was first identified shortly after an incident occurring in SCP-1239-2 on ████-07-██, in which the respective parents of ten (10) children, who had been introduced as part of a social event, were exposed to SCP-1239-1. The affected individuals (of which there were six (6)) were interviewed and dealt with as per Recovery Protocol 8. A cover story regarding a toxic gas leak was later circulated, and the remains of the children incinerated after analysis. The exact means by which SCP-1239's anomalous properties originally manifested at this time is uncertain.

**Note:** Testing regarding SCP-1239 has determined that no direct behavioural alterations result from exposure to SCP-1239-1. Why the surviving individuals acted in the manner they are known to have is unknown.
