[[tab Suspect Description/Capabilities]]

**Name:** Unknown, alias “Steven Scorsese” and “Mr. Get Anything For Free In Any Shop"

**Irregularity Cross-reference:** American, Biology, Human, Investigated, Visual

**Physical Description:**
||~ Sex ||~ Height ||~ Weight/Build ||~ Race ||~ Hair ||~ Eyes ||~ Identifying Attributes ||
||~ Male ||~ 62 in ||~ 151 lbs, medium ||~ American Indian ||~ Black ||~ Blue ||~ Tattoo across back of suspect's neck reading ‘Mr. Get Anything For Free In Any Shop, by Gamers Against Weed’.||

**Capabilities:** Suspect is an American Indian male in his mid-twenties, capable of causing others to experience visual hallucinations resembling various types of pop-up ads. These hallucinations appear when reading any digital, handwritten, or other types of text the suspect has previously affected with his abilities. Suspect 'plants' hallucinogenic properties into text by first reading the information, and then pointing at whichever section it wishes to make into a 'trigger' for one or multiple hallucinations. Hallucinations appearing on physical documents may be dismissed by touching the hallucinations 'close button'. Hallucinations appearing in a digital format may be closed using expected means such as a mouse cursor. Clicking on digitally formatted pop-ups will predominantly link the user to various spam-related webpages; however, Scorsese has proven himself able to create pop-ups which directly link to websites of his choosing. 

**Purpose/Motive:** Suspect utilizes his anomalous abilities to create ads for various 'fake products' to advertise a satirical online retailer site. Websites design and format are heavily influenced by sites such as 'Amazon' and 'eBay' but does not actually sell any of the products advertised. The site is entirely for entertainment purposes and contains various fake products it claims to sell of a satirical and humorous nature. The site has gained a significant increase in views and income since the implementation of Scorsese's anomalous capabilities.

  **Modus Operandi:** Suspect resides in a two-story house with several other males, all roughly within the same age category of himself. Residents are believed to be the website's original creators.
Scorsese is often seen with residents during social outings. Suspect accesses websites it chooses to affect using a standard laptop.
 
 **Behavior:** Suspect has applicable knowledge regarding the workings of retail sites. Scorsese is erudite in the use and application of his abilities. Actively enjoys and is efficient at his work, usually spending multiple hours a day using his abilities to affect numerous websites. Suspect occasionally targets websites which celebrate flagrant and heinous content in a sincere manner, creating a multitude of pop up ads designed to mock the site users.

Investigations have shown suspect to be rather meek, often showing signs of social awkwardness when interacting with strangers and occasionally appears outright withdrawn, never actively leaving his base of operations unless with someone else, and will appear rather anxious when doing so.

The nature of pop-ups created by Scorsese present him as having a rather satirical sense of humour,  and feelings of strong disgust towards various forms of hate crime, as websites celebrating such themes have been his most frequent target.

On close terms with his house occupants, all of which claim to consider him a friend and is much happier and self-confident around them, adopting a somewhat 'snarky' attitude and appears more confident interacting with others when around them.

 **History of UIU Action:**

27/04/2016: During a routine web search for possible information of irregularities or anomalies, UIU web crawlers located a web ad containing the phrase ‘Dr. Wondertainment’, an organization suspected by the UIU for the creation and distribution of anomalous items, children's toys and anomalous humans under the alias of ‘Little Misters’. UIU agents were able to track the location of the computer used to access the ad.

09/05/2016: Capture attempt of the suspect was initiated. UIU agents were sent to the suspect's location and attempted to apprehend them in a non-lethal manner. The suspect was able to evade capture using several hallucinations planted within several printed documents to confuse and distract agents. Hallucinations appeared as spasmodic imagery containing various coloring and patterns designed to cause hallucinogenic effects and major disturbance to agents visual stimuli. Houses tenants were brought in for inquiry but refused to answer any questions posed, repeatedly claiming to have no knowledge of Scorsese's abilities. Investigations failed to gather any evidence disproving the tenant's claims. Further investigation into the organization ‘Dr. Wondertainment’ is to be conducted.
