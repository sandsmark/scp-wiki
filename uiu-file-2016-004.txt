||~ Sex ||~ Height ||~ Weight/Build ||~ Race ||~ Hair ||~ Eyes ||~ Identifying Attributes ||

**Capabilities:** Suspect is an American Indian male in his mid-twenties, capable of making others experience visual hallucinations in the form of various types of pop-up ads. These hallucinations appear when  reading any digital, hand written or other type of text the suspect has previously interacted with. Suspect ‘plants' hallucinogenic properties into text by first reading the information, and then pointing at whichever section it wishes to make into a 'trigger' for one or multiple hallucinations. Those affected are able to interact with hallucinations as normal. Hallucinations appearing on documents may dismissed by touching the close button and those in a digital format may be closed using expected means such as a mouse cursor. Clicking on digital formatted pop-ups will predominantly link the user to an empty webpage, however Scorsese has proven himself able to create pop-ups which directly link to websites of his choosing. 

**Purpose/Motive:** Suspect utilizes his anomalous abilities to create ads for various 'fake products' to advertise for a satirical online retailer site. Websites design and format are heavily influenced by sites such as 'Amazon' and 'Ebay' but does not actually sell any of the products advertised. Site is entirely for entertainment purposes and contains various fake products it claims to sell of a satirical and humorous nature. The site has gained a significant increase in views and income since the implementation of Scorsese's anomalous capabilities.

  **Modus Operandi:** Suspect resides in a two-story house with several other males, all roughly within the same age category of himself. Residents are believed to be the websites original creators.
Scorsese is often seen with residents during social outings. Suspect accesses websites and it chooses to effect using a standard laptop.
 
 **Behavior:** Suspect has applicable knowledge regarding the workings of retail sites. Scorsese is erudite in the use and application of his abilities. Actively enjoys and is efficient at his work, usually spending multiple hours a day using his abilities to affect numerous websites. Suspect occasionally targets websites containing flagrant and heinous content discussing similar topics in a sincere manner, creating a multitude of pop up ads. Whether this is for personal gain or his own amusement is of yet unknown.

Suspect is quite meek and shrewd, showing signs of social awkwardness when interacting with strangers and appears outright withdrawn, never actively leaving his base of operations unless with someone else. On close terms with his house occupants, all of which claim to consider him a friend and is much happier and self confident around them, adopting a somewhat 'snarky' attitude and  usually interacts with others if asked to by them.

Suspect was able to evade capture using several hallucinations planted within various documents to confuse and distract agents. Hallucinations appeared as spasmodic imagery containing various colors and patterns, causing additional hallucinations and disturbance to agents visual stimuli. Houses tenants were brought in for enquiry, but refused to answer any questions posed, repeatedly claiming to have no knowledge of the Scorsese's abilities.
