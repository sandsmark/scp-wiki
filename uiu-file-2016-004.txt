**Name:** Unknown, alias “Steven Scorsese” and “Mr. Get Anything For Free In Any Shop"

**Irregularity Cross-reference:** American, Biology, Human, Investigated, Visual

**Capabilities:** Suspect is an American Indian male in his mid-twenties, capable of making others experience visual hallucinations in the form of various types of pop-up ads. These hallucinations appear when reading any digital, handwritten, or other type of text the suspect has previously interacted with. Suspect 'plants' hallucinogenic properties into text by first reading the information, and then pointing at whichever section it wishes to make into a 'trigger' for one or multiple hallucinations. Those affected are able to interact with hallucinations as normal. Hallucinations appearing on documents may be dismissed by touching the close button and those in a digital format may be closed using expected means such as a mouse cursor. Clicking on digital formatted pop-ups will predominantly link the user to an empty webpage; however, Scorsese has proven himself able to create pop-ups which directly link to websites of his choosing. 

**Purpose/Motive:** Suspect utilizes his anomalous abilities to create ads for various 'fake products' to advertise for a satirical online retailer site. Websites design and format are heavily influenced by sites such as 'Amazon' and 'eBay' but does not actually sell any of the products advertised. Site is entirely for entertainment purposes and contains various fake products it claims to sell of a satirical and humorous nature. The site has gained a significant increase in views and income since the implementation of Scorsese's anomalous capabilities.

  **Modus Operandi:** Suspect resides in a two-story house with several other males, all roughly within the same age category of himself. Residents are believed to be the website's original creators.
Scorsese is often seen with residents during social outings. Suspect accesses websites it chooses to affect using a standard laptop.
 
 **Behavior:** Suspect has applicable knowledge regarding the workings of retail sites. Scorsese is erudite in the use and application of his abilities. Actively enjoys and is efficient at his work, usually spending multiple hours a day using his abilities to affect numerous websites. Suspect occasionally targets websites containing flagrant and heinous content discussing similar topics in a sincere manner, creating a multitude of pop up ads. Whether this is for personal gain or his own amusement is of yet unknown.

Suspect is quite meek, often showing signs of social awkwardness when interacting with strangers and occasionally appears outright withdrawn, never actively leaving his base of operations unless with someone else. On close terms with his house occupants, all of which claim to consider him a friend and is much happier and self confident around them, adopting a somewhat 'snarky' attitude and appears more confident interacting with others when around them.

UIU agent were able to track the location of the computer used to access the ad.

09/05/2016: Capture attempt of suspect was initiated. UIU agents were sent to the suspects location and attempted to apprehend them in a nonlethal manner. Suspect was able to evade capture using several hallucinations planted within several printed documents to confuse and distract agents. Hallucinations appeared as spasmodic imagery containing various colors and patterns, causing additional hallucinations and disturbance to agents visual stimuli. Houses tenants were brought in for enquiry, but refused to answer any questions posed, repeatedly claiming to have no knowledge of Scorsese's abilities. Investigations failed to gather any evidence disproving the tenants claims. Further investigation into the organisation ‘Dr. Wondertainment’ is to be conducted.
