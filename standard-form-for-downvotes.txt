In order to simplify downvoting for common reasons, and to make it feel less personal, I have created:

**SCP Foundation Standardized[[footnote]] This is a joke, not standard, and not even a real form you should use [[/footnote]] Downvote Form 1040-EZ**

I am downvoting your SCP because: (check all that apply)

[ ] You forgot to spellcheck.
[ ] You forgot to proofread.
[ ] You did not read, or decided to ignore "How to Write an SCP."
[ ] You posted an incomplete SCP to the main site.
[ ] Your formatting is incorrect.
[ ] You do not know the difference between its/it's; your/you're; there/their/they're.
[ ] I am not sure if you know how to write in English.
[ ] You appear to have accidentally posted an article intended for the Shark Punching Center (SPC).
[ ] If you had posted your idea in the Forum, 20 people would have told you not to write it.
[ ] If you had posted a draft in your sandbox, 20 people would have told you not to post it on the main site.
[ ] Your SCP is too much like SCP-__, and is not written well enough to get away with it.
[ ] Your SCP is a straight rip-off of __.
[ ] Your SCP is on the Cliche List, and is not written well enough to get away with it.
[ ] There is no hook.
[ ] Meh.
[ ] Your -J isn't funny.
[ ] I had to read half of your SCP before I could figure out what it does.
[ ] I read your entire SCP and still don't even know what it IS.
[ ] You [REDACTED] part of the containment procedures.
[ ] You [REDACTED] other things in a way that is silly.
[ ] Please remove:
-- [ ] the incorrectly-edited title
-- [ ] the boring test log
-- [ ] the boring supplemental pages
-- [ ] the non-metric measurements
-- [ ] the 27MB off-site image
-- [ ] the "artists impression" of your SCP
-- [ ] the lolFoundation addendum
-- [ ] the Telekill reference
-- [ ] the crosslink to SCP-087/173/500/682/914 (circle as appropriate)
-- [ ] the lame joke about sharks and/or bees
[ ] You keep using the word "memetic." I do not think it means what you think it means.
[ ] Your SCP compels people to use it for no reason.
[ ] Your SCP is just a __ that kills people.
[ ] Your "real life" SCP is less interesting than the real thing that it is based on.
[ ] The story of how your SCP was found is unbelievable.
[ ] Your SCP breaks my suspension of disbelief. Specifically, because (of):
-- [ ] Incorrect science
-- [ ] Technobabble
-- [ ] Anachronisms
-- [ ] The combat scene should have "Yakety Sax" playing in the background.
-- [ ] Other:
[ ] Your SCP has a containment area that is:
-- [ ] a vastly-oversized cube
-- [ ] 2-dimensional
-- [ ] 6-dimensional
-- [ ] made of titanium (or other inappropriate materials)
-- [ ] nonexistent; the SCP is allowed to wander around the site.
[ ] Writings translated from ancient language.
-- [ ] ...and somehow still rhyme in English.

**Staff Notice: Please note, actual use of this form in discussion threads will not be tolerated.**
