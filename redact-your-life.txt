Something was following Foster. He was certain of it.

It was no foul beast, it did not prey on him in bloodlust nor hunger. It simply hung from him like a heavy chain on his form, a miasma. It plagued him from the background, and although he wasn't sure what it was exactly, he knew there was something inherently //wrong// about it.

He didn't know why it chose him, nor how long it had been following him before he caught on. It faded in on a slow gradient, leaking into his life and corrupting the very fabric that held him together as a human. As he drove back to his hotel room from his nightly run for hard liquor and empty carbs, the rolling hills of the Carrizo Plain in the distance, Foster felt the cool hand of paranoia on the back of his spine. Crawling and itching with restlessness and ants. Imaginary ants, just under the skin. He knew the feeling well.

Ignoring the usual cloud that followed his head on any given day, he allowed himself to grow hyperaware of his surroundings, his vision sharpening enough to pierce through the inky darkness around him- though nothing was there. The silence increased in volume to a deafening and oppressive hum, so Foster switched on the radio and tuned it to a random station, a talk show. He was still alone, yet oddly comforted by the company of a disembodied voice, listening to it mumble on about some conflict or other in whatever impoverished, war-torn nation it is nowadays. The presence was still there, lingering in the folds, and it exhaled its misery out into the aether with each invisible breath.

That thing had taken everything from him. It tore him from his family, his friends. His children. His home. Now, slowly, it fed on his sanity and sense of self, just outside of view, of knowing, and of form. Somehow, it was still everywhere; he saw the tracks it left behind as it consumed the world. The gaps and the blank pages, things between things, gone but for the space they left behind and nobody blinks an eye. He was not better for it. Ignorance is bliss.

Yet this ghost of an idea would not be ignored. Listening to the host drone on, Foster was caught off guard by a sudden change in the quality of the broadcast, like artifacts in an image, distorting and decreasing in pitch, warping into discordant ugliness, then to nothing. He changed the station, but static grew on that one as well, and the next, the music detuning and fading as chaos overcame the sound.

It would not be ignored.


Foster switched wildly through the stations until there was nothing left. Just emptiness and a harsh white noise. He turned it off with a sigh. This is how it is. Everything and everyone he ever had ties with, it would cut them loose and he would never see them again. Nobody would remember except for him, and life seemed to find a way to adjust history to fit that definition. Yeah, they didn't believe him either, presumably until they too vanished from the world. 

He checked the clock. ██:██. He should be tired, but he isn't. He was wired. And confused.

So confused.

In fact, it took him a minute to realize that he didn't actually know where he was going. He knew he was driving to a hotel, but he forgot the name, and how to get there. Pulling off to the side of the road, Foster checked his wallet for the room key. After a minute, he succeeded, although it looked foreign to him as he studied it closer. ██████████ Hotel. Okay. 

Foster pulled out his phone and searched the name, hands trembling. Luckily the place still exists. Relief was a strong word for how he felt, but it was a nice change. Glancing around for identifying street signs, he was startled to find that they are unreadable. Someone stuck tape or something over the words, leaving a white rectangle and a very useless landmark. Who does that?

It would //not// be ignored.

Right. 

Punching the address into his GPS, he found that he was close by, and breathed another sigh of half-relief. He pulled out onto the now unmarked road and sped down the freeway, ignoring speed limit signs he was pretty sure he couldn't read anyway.

The ride, although uneventful, was thick with unease. He couldn't help but feel the weight of it on his back. Looming. He didn't believe how unrecognizable the area was. It was near the home he lost, or where it had been in another life, surely he had gone through this area before?

How did he find the hotel in the first place? He tried not to think too hard about it. Even if he did, he would never find the answer. Approaching the address, Foster reached to shut off his GPS, only to find his phone with a black screen. It wouldn't turn on. How long had it been off? How long had he been driving? 

Glancing outside, he realized that he was obviously not in the right place. An abandoned strip mall, some empty lots and a restaurant or two. No hotel. He couldn't remember the name, or the address. He looked for the room key but it too was gone.

Panic gripping him, sense of direction waning, Foster decided to calm himself by heading into a neon-clad diner situated across the street from him for something to eat. He wasn't hungry, but it was a distraction and something real- that was all he needed.

The diner was about as run-of-the-mill as you can get, arguably how most diners are. It was themed in a half-hearted 50's fashion, and Foster was nonplussed by the furnishings but sat at a booth regardless. A waitress came over to him shortly afterwards, sporting bushy hair and a stained, white apron. She wordlessly handed him a menu and gestured with a pot of coffee. It took a minute for him to realize what she meant; his mind was on a million other things. He declined the caffeine. Probably wouldn't help his paranoia.

It wasn't so much paranoia as it was warranted caution now, though, right? He knew it was in the diner, eating the words off the menu. Good thing it has pictures. 

Glancing at the images of platters and sandwiches, he was reminded of the many times he ate at an establishment like this with his family. His wife, and his kids? He had kids, right? He tried to picture them, to envision just one feature he remembered, but nothing was there. He wasn't even sure if he had had a wife anymore. 

It was all too much. There was bile in his throat, his stomach in knots. He couldn't eat. The smells that wafted from the kitchen were wretched to him, as perfectly mediocre as they may be in reality. Getting up swiftly, head spinning, Foster made his way to the bathroom and locked the door behind him, buckling in front of the toilet and vomiting acid. It burned his throat and nose, making his eyes water as he continued to gag. It continued for some time, and when it relented, he laid on the filthy, tiled floor and tried to wish himself out of existence. It didn't work.

He didn't have the energy to right himself. Why would he try? Where would he go? He had nothing. He could barely remember himself, who he was before his mind was broken over the knee of uncertainty and terror. Foster reached for his wallet and dug inside for his license. An unfamiliar face stared back at him, laminated and real. There was a light in his eyes, a light he was sure had vanished eons ago. Even though he couldn't recognize the picture, a Foster █████ was indeed there. No address was present anymore, just a few lines of scratches that wore it down to illegibility. Did he do that? No, of course not. 

Touching his face, Foster felt for the features on the photo, still laying in defeat. He tried to reassure himself that he is who he is, even though he didn't really know what that meant anymore. Sitting up, he looked over at the sinks, and the mirror. He could look at himself. Would that help him remember who he was, this man on the card? He peered back down to find the picture black, no trace of his visage was seen. 

Now, he needed to know. 

He stood and moved towards the reflective surface, looking into it to reveal ████████████████ ████████████████████ ██████████ █████████████████████████ ███████████████ ███████████████ ██████████████████████████████████████████ ██████████  █████████████████████████ ████████████████████████████████████████ ████████████████████████████████████████████ ████████████████████
██████████ █████████████████████████ ██████████████ ████████████ ████████

And then he was no more.

++++ **//THE NEXT DAY//**
[[/=]]


Foundation Field Agent Markus Mcclanahan stepped cautiously over the shards of broken glass and upturned chairs that littered the tiled floor of the once-diner. His boots squelched against the ground as they waded through a shallow puddle that filled the area- the result of fire sprinklers being triggered in the early morning and running throughout most of the day. The scene was one of chaos, but nothing the agent hadn't experienced before. 

The stranger business was that of all the secrecy surrounding the event; there was no briefing, no coghaz programming upon his routine arrival into the Site-19 Dispatch for his daily assignment information, suggesting the answers escaped even Site Management. He had simply been instructed to "go to this address" and "report for damage assessment of anomalous event of unknown magnitude". The terminology used had made him snort audibly, giving the woman behind the glass a moment to shoot him a dirty look in response. He had reasoned at that point that he had possibly deserved it for making light of what was likely to be one of many fates worse than death.

Secrets weren't anything new to Markus, who had spent his last few years learning just how many things he //didn't// know. There was quite a bit, and there were forces on all sides of him working tirelessly to make sure he would //never// know. He had learned to live with it (and [http://www.scp-wiki.net/your-future-is-bright die with it], but that's another story), like many of his peers had done. You learn by what they can't tell you, using the process of deduction, and you meander through the field and try your best to use that information to not get annihilated in one of a million horrifying, unbelievable ways.

There's this common misconception that floats around the new hire pools for Foundation agents. It's said that if nonhazardous, classified knowledge of an anomaly's nature can help lower-clearance personnel in their investigative efforts that administration will always reveal that knowledge. Safety is the name of the game, after all. 

Unfortunately, this was not always the reality of the situation. In fact, this was //hardly// the case. 

The administration has their hands in the politics of a billion worlds. Parallel, distant, macro-and-microcosmic, future and past. The Foundation isn't subtle enough to not flex their reach internally. Markus had even heard rumors of in-house spacio-temporal gateways somewhere in the labyrinthine hallways of Nineteen that would allow for unified diplomacy across dimensions. If they would let one piece of vital information slip through the layers of black ink and red tape and into the multiversal ooze, the results could be... unforeseen. The Foundation's greatest fear- the unknown.

Markus' train of thought derailed as he noticed a stout woman staring at him with a sour look on her face, arms crossed against her chest to match her demeanor. She stood in the center of the ruined eating establishment, holding a stack of papers under her arm with significant tension. Her eyes looked through him, equal parts vacant and occupied, suggesting she believed her problems were more important than her immediate surroundings. They were, but this included Markus, who didn't like the idea she knew something he did not. He wouldn't reveal his disdain for the obvious disrespect, settling for a tone that was both cordial and dry. 

"Director", he uttered, and followed it with a curt nod that hid his surprise well.

Seeing a Site Director in the field is not a common occurrence. They are typically vital to the day-to-day operations of their assigned facility, and therefore are rarely risked out in the real world. Usually, the only time a Site Director oversees field affairs is when it pertains to a containment breach. Markus had answered his next question preemptively, but it didn't stop him from prying her to see just how much he was out of the loop. That's the process of deduction at work. 

"What are we looking at here?"

Site Director Phillips clicked her tongue, exhaling her words in sharp, impatient bursts.
 
"Fire erupted early this morning, no emergency response. No one was in the building when it happened, so luckily no cleanup detail for you guys today." He stared at her for an extra moment too long and she added, "That's it."

"So why are you here, then? Why are //any of us// here?", Markus wiped his brow and tried to piece it together from what she was allowed to tell him.

"Extranormal event. One time thing. No need to designate", she spoke with decreasing effort. Her mind was seemingly too preoccupied to come up with a Level Two explanation for him. Mcclanahan chuckled and glanced around. There was no way this was just a fire, anomalous or not, it looked like the place had been completely robbed of it's identity. //Conceptually gutted// would be a more apt comparison.

If it weren't for the layout, he probably wouldn't have known it was a diner. There were no identifying marks on exterior, the signage, the labels, nothing. Furniture was strewn about and without color. The entire building was in shades of gray and black.

Audrey piped up again, "If you're done admiring, I need the surrounding blocks canvassed for individuals who may have witnessed the fire."

Markus twinged inside at the idea of canvassing. No one had seen the fire because everyone that was present was dead. Or dead, //adjacent//. It was an assumption, but from the way Audrey tightened her form around her papers when he questioned the situation, it seemed to him like it was a safe assumption to make. 

A uniformed Task Force member walked by him with inherent purpose, carrying with him a stack of laminated menus in his arms. When he passed, one slid from the stack and fell at Markus' feet. As he reached to grab the paper, the Task Force agent snatched it from him coarsely, spun on his heel in one motion, and skulked off, leaving the two to themselves and the sounds of water dripping off ruined, colorless upholstery.

It didn't stop him from briefly glimpsing at the menu, and, in that same moment, to the partially-obscured stack, which revealed that the words and pictures were redacted off the pages. The black blocks burned an image into his brain, which he saw again, inverted and superimposed over his vision when he closed his eyes. The image faded with Markus' curiousity. 

//Sure, a fire.// He decided it wasn't his problem. Ignorance is bliss.

"Canvassing. You got it, Director Phillips."
