The location of SCP-5620's initial recovery.
[[/div]]
[[/div]]

------

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5620 is currently held in an outdoor biological containment cell with direct access to an outdoor wooded area. SCP-5620 is to be provided with a daily supply of meat[[footnote]] Beef, pork, and/or salmon. [[/footnote]] and water, as well as one barrel of ale per week. Singular pieces of paper and writing utensils are to be provided to the entity at its discretion. These items are to be confiscated once SCP-5620 has completed its writing.

------

**Description:** SCP-5620 is a seven-meter long, serpentine entity originally discovered in Northern Italy. SCP-5620's characteristics are as follows:
* A disproportionately large head, measuring 3 meters wide.
* Two red, oblong eyeballs without pupils.
* Two small horns extending out of its forehead.
* A large maw that extends to the middle of the entity's cheeks. Lining its mouth are two rows of serrated teeth.
SCP-5620 is coated in a thick layer of fur similar in composition to the Common Alpine species of goat.

SCP-5620 has shown a minor degree of sapience, though it is either unaware of the Foundation's attempts at conversing with it or is simply reluctant to comply. Should the entity choose to do so, it will write in metered poetry with its tail or writing instrument.[[footnote]] SCP-5620 accomplishes this by curling the end of its tail around the writing utensil and maneuvering the tail similarly to an arm. [[/footnote]] SCP-5620's writing shows minor anomalous properties: readers of any language are able to understand its poems; rhyme scheme, overall tone, and grammatical errors will translate as well. The subjects of these poems have differed, though are often related to Foundation personnel it has interacted with.


------

**Discovery:** SCP-5620 was discovered on January 6th, 1994 in the village of Andrista in Lombardy, Italy after multiple reports from the area of livestock being stolen by a large snake. Mobile Task Force Zeta-66 "Guardian Angels" was tasked with confirming these reports. They discovered the entity consuming a hog within a nearby forest where they tranquilized and captured it.

SCP-5620 awakened inside of its transport van and became belligerent, ramming itself into the side of its cell in an attempt to escape. It ceased this activity after ten minutes. Upon removal from the van, the sentences, 'Dirty soldier capture I. Little they know that one lie. Promote is what Garriolo desire. Captain, watch out for it may get dire.' were carved into a metal wall with its horn.

Captain Paolo Lucia later uncovered multiple false complaints written by Agent Garriolo in an attempt to usurp the role of team lead from him.

**Addendum One — Attempts at Interviews**
------
[[/=]]

Director Joseph Pasqua attempted to converse with SCP-5620 on five separate occasions. The entity refused to comply, even after being offered double its daily intake. Dir. Pasqua later returned to SCP-5620's containment chamber with writing utensils after witnessing SCP-5620 write a line of poetry in the soil below it. The entity accepted the writing materials but once again dismissed Pasqua's requests for an interview before delivering a finished poem.

Tired of his job, I see
Sir Joesph Pasqua comes to I
Droning on, does he stop? Nigh.
Annoying man sir Pasqua be
Go away, cease plaguing me.
Should he refuse, mad I get.
This I do so he no forget.
[[/span]]
[[/div]]
[[/=]]

Upon finishing the poem, Dir. Pasqua was soaked by SCP-5620's water bucket. The entity then tossed its pen at Dir. Pasqua's head and began consuming its daily meal.

Dir. Pasqua assigned the role of Head Researcher to Researcher Justin Thomas following this incident.

**Addendum Two — Researcher Thomas**
------
[[/=]]

Upon a single interaction with SCP-5620, Researcher Thomas was delivered a slip of paper. Security footage shows Thomas making multiple attempts against SCP-5620's life for at the time unknown reasons after reading the verse. An onsite security guard terminated Researcher Thomas to protect the entity and later recovered the poem.
