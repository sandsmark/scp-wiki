It was right in front of him.

He knew the danger he was in.

He knew that the entity could kill him instantly, if he blinked.

But he wasn't afraid.

He wasn't reluctant.

He didn't want to leave.

Instead he embraced the entity.

Felt its sorrow.

Felt its misery.

Felt its anger.

And then, he spoke.

"Good to see you again, old friend."

"It's been a while." 

"A while indeed."

"I wonder how you feel now."

"How you feel after we did this to you."

"For so long."

...

"Hey, I can't blame you,"

"I know the feeling."

"I wouldn't act any differently."

"Especially not knowing no matter how I treated them, they would Always treat me the same..."

"Lock me up,"

"Keep me in here."

...

"I... I've realized my sins now."

"Working here was a big mistake."

"Dedicating my Life to locking up things,"

"Working in an endless prison."

"And I know how this must feel."

...

"I get it now."

"I'm flesh,"

"You're conrete and rebar,"

"We're different."

"But what gives me the right to do all this..."

"I don't know."

...

"I Think its time I give you justice."

"I'm submitting."

"I'll leave a note,"

"Otherwise they'll just blame you..."

...

"I remember the first time I saw you."

"Fear, grasping me."

"I couldn't believe my eyes..."

"You were actually real"

"And I was so afraid."

"I never realized..."

"What if you were too?"

...

"I'm not even sure if you understand me,"

"But for once, I'll let you win."

"I can't get you out of here."

"You know they would just put you back, anyway."

"But I'll let you escape in Another way."

"I'll let you escape."

"From me."

"From my ignorance and intolerance,

"From my mistakes and my idiocy,

"From... Everything I did to you"

...

"I Think my time has come"

"I Think I want to go now"

...

"Goodbye."

...

He slowly lowered his eyelid

Expecting this to be his last sight

It was so Close

His vision almost gone

And then, it happened

His Eye, closed

He was no more

...

He saw only darkness

But it felt like a sweet release from all his sins

"This must be it" He murmured for himself

Opening his Eyes, expecting nothing

Expecting no World

No meaning

No Life

...

But there was something

There was an entity

Roughly as large as him

With a rounded head

An odd face

Two stumped arms

...

And Traces of Krylon brand spray paint

...

"..."

"Glad to see you feel the same way"
