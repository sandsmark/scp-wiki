**Agent Saul Kulzn**

//[FILES UNDER HEAVY ENCRYPTION - DECODING PROCESS AT 0%]//

------

**History:**
> //Prior record: Copy_Received; Setting//
Recruited into the active ranks of the Foundation at an early age after surviving the initial discovery and encounter of [DATA EXPUNGED], Kulzn became an agent of note within the British branch of the Foundation, eventually coming to lead MTF Kappa-42.
After the disappearance of three members and the subsequent suicides of two others, agent Kulzn did proceed to go A.W.O.L for approx. twenty eight (28) months. Intel of movements for this period is insubstantial.

After restoring contact with the Foundation, Kulzn was reacquisitioned and placed on diminished duty until such time as Overwatch saw fit to reassign him to the reactivation of Site 33.

Currently acting Head of Research at Site 33, replacing Dr. Kara (deceased).

I mean that you want to drown in something, you want to drown in liquid, you want to drown in noise, you want to drown in cold, darkness or fire. it#s something I can#t shake, somethign i don#t know when it started and I can#t see it ending.
> and it's infuriating, I want to scream and yell until my lungs tear and my wordsare as blood and flesh; my boneswant to stretchaand crack, my muscles feel like they need to tear themselves apart to feel relief.
> 
> getting worse as I wrtite this,c an't stop shaking, twitching, need to vent, to rage, to roar and rend and damage. self restraint holds me, as it alwayss  shas.on;ly ever slipped twice.
>
