**Addendum 16-04-2009:**

> There's something affecting me which i can't explain. you ever felt like drowning? I mean that you want to drown in something, you want to drown in liquid, you want to drown in noise, you want to drown in cold, darkness or fire. it#s something I can#t shake, somethign i don#t know when it started and I can#t see it ending.
> and it's infuriating, I want to scream and yell until my lungs tear and my wordsare as blood and flesh; my boneswant to stretchaand crack, my muscles feel like they need to tear themselves apart to feel relief.
> 
> getting worse as I wrtite this,c an't stop shaking, twitching, need to vent, to rage, to roar and rend and damage. self restraint holds me, as it alwayss  shas.on;ly ever slipped twice.
> 
> need more noise
