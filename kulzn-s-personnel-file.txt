//[FILES UNDER HEAVY ENCRYPTION - DECODING PROCESS AT 0%]//

------

**History:**
> //Prior record: Copy_Received; Setting//
Recruited into the active ranks of the Foundation at an early age after surviving the initial discovery and encounter of [DATA EXPUNGED], Kulzn became an agent of note within the British branch of the Foundation, eventually coming to lead MTF Kappa-42.
After the disappearance of three members and the subsequent suicides of two others, agent Kulzn did proceed to go A.W.O.L for approx. twenty eight (28) months. Intel of movements for this period is insubstantial.

After restoring contact with the Foundation, Kulzn was reacquisitioned and placed on diminished duty until such time as Overwatch saw fit to reassign him to the reactivation of Site 33.

Currently acting Head of Research at Site 33, replacing Dr. Kara (deceased).
