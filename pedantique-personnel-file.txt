My second article. I self-deleted the first with the intent to rewrite it when it hung around +25, but that hasn't panned out yet. I'm not at all surprised this article hasn't gone above +50. I still hadn't nailed down proper tone, some of the description and containment sections are overwritten, and the ending still feels a bit tacked on. There used to be a bit about the entire apparatus (star plus orbital factory) moving toward Earth, but a comment pointed out how similar that is to the Hateful Star's shtick. Now it's left with something about selling whatever it's been manufacturing. I never had a solid idea of what was actually being built there, maybe to the article's detriment.

I also self-deleted a middling tale related to this article. That one can still be found on scpper, but I plan on rewriting it some day too. There's just something about a giant burning sphere of pure capitalism that appeals to me. The concept still does, even if the execution fell a bit flat on this one.

Speaking of capitalism! I don't entirely remember what inspired me to write this article. I finished it a few months before I was subjected to econ classes for my master's degree, but maybe it was generally anxiety about them. I've also never worked in a company that has quite this tangled an organization chart, though my current position is messy enough that it's never been clear who my boss' boss is. Maybe it was something like that. Regardless, this remains one of my more popular articles, especially in terms of having minimal downvotes. I think the absurdity of the working world speaks to everyone. 

In terms of writing, I think I went a bit overboard with details again. I hadn't been on the site for very long when I wrote these first few articles, and I definitely struggled with the idea of telling a story as opposed to writing a Dungeons & Dragons source book entry. That said, there's much more narrative progression with the development of the anomaly over time. The implied Capitalism Deity bit is something I'd like to explore in the future too, but it's hard to find a good angle for it. Maybe someone else will pick it up and run with it. Also, I suspect the interview is entirely pointless. It's the last one I ever wrote for an article.

I've read plenty of interviews since then while giving feedback in the Drafts & Critique forum (and just while reading the site in general), and it's extremely rare for any of them to stand out positively. There's not enough time for me to relate to the characters, and recounting action after the fact is generally unsatisfying. I suspect the inclusion of an interview format in the How to Write an SCP page has led to a lot of spurious inclusions. That includes the one here.

I'm not sure I should have finished this article to be honest. I had the idea for 910 halfway through writing it, and it feels like that article covers plenty of the same ground in a more interesting way. I've mostly left it up as a fun little mystery (Dark Souls' implied stories by item descriptions was a big inspiration), and also because I still love the idea of a person's insistence being so strong that it alters reality. That being swept under the rug of secret histories was so repulsive to someone that this is the result. I don't consider my version of the Administrator to be a reality bender in the way that they're typically described. This is just how much they cared about their life's work.

This article is the first place where my love of cover ups, bureaucratic nonsense, and internal strife shows itself in my work here. It's also a notable reference to the Howling Pillar, a place mentioned throughout my work (including my now-deleted first article). My typical process of developing settings has always been sprinkling offhand references to people, places, and events, then picking them back up later. It works pretty well.

I'm still amused by the concept of Foundation-issued alcohol. It doesn't feel particularly realistic in retrospect, but it does suit the tone of the small setting.

It's the big one! At least, it was the big one for a while. About halfway through 3791 I realized that a more specific story about the betrayal implied by it would probably be more interesting. [[[SCP-2975]]] was a big inspiration in terms of showing that the branching format through Twine output attached to the article could actually function. The lack of real choice is still something I worry about, but it feels thematically appropriate to the article. Ahmadi is bound by her position and perceived duties even with her immense power, and the reader is subsequently bound to a limited amount of choice as a result. That was intended, and I'm sure it irks some readers, but it is what it is.

Coming up with a bunch of vague anomalies that could be used in the component disasters was probably the hardest part. I'm still partial to the nuclear hive mind (later referred to in [http://www.scp-wiki.net/maim-the-sky-slay-the-sun-hub Maim the Sky, Slay the Sun]) for similar reasons to my partiality toward the temporal nonsense in 3791. Belief imparting power, in this case fear of nuclear weapons in sum granting them some sort of sentience, is a theme I return to frequently. The bit about loss of identity in a chunk of Canada was sort of odd, the immolation cult in China is the first appearance of Egret and Dhole (even if I hadn't conceived of them as such at the time), and the Grand Canyon being a giant mouth all still stand out to me. The rest of them are generally unmemorable. Oh, and whale wizards. I'll have to return to the whale wizard skeletons under Hell, Michigan some time.

The monumental importance of Hell, Michigan is also a thing that's cropped up throughout my writing here. For the uninitiated, Hell is an unincorporated township in Michigan ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell,_Michigan Wikipedia page], for reference) that's relatively close to where I grew up. I've never actually been there. Regardless, I'm a firm believer that all places of power should have silly names.

Anyway, whale wizard skeletons teaching a kid Secret Thaumaturgy underneath that township is still an amazing scene, and I'm glad I wrote it. In terms of mechanics, a lot of my wording was definitely too flowery. The climax is probably too short as well, and Ahmadi's character beyond her exhaustion isn't elaborated on enough, but the piece was still received well overall. It has been a very passive short of positive reception though. With how much crap the cyborg mobile task force gets, I'm a bit surprised I never got complaints about an immortal wizard overseer.

Persistent thanks to [[*user shaggydredlocks]] for the 910 slot itself. I've become very partial to the number, and it's definitely more memorably than its original 3983.

This article actually started out explicitly being about the Administrator. It still relates to them, as quite a few people have rightly determined in their analyses, but they're obviously not the focus anymore. The expunged description and general course of the article came about as I realized that the original concept wasn't particularly interesting. If I recall correctly, I had been framing it around a sort of amorphous tumorous blob that was later revealed to be the Administrator? Regardless, I'm certain I made the right choice in changing it to the current structure.

This article is also the first time I elaborated on the general structure and atmosphere of the Foundation within my larger body of work. In my eyes and in my writing, it's become a sprawling organization full of argumentative power centers and people with starkly different ideas about the right way to approach any issue. This naturally includes the Ethics Committee and the Overseer Council, but has come to include MTF Alpha-1, the Administrator, and a number of regional directors and other bureaucrats. They also all have lots of guns. That last part's more personal preference in terms of the themes I like to write about most.

Sakarya's fun to write because she believes she's always right. Contradictory opinions are conspiracies. Contradictory facts are lies. From that self-assured air comes a certain kind of charisma, and from that charisma comes institutional power ([http://www3.nccu.edu.tw/~lorenzo/Allison%20Conceptual%20Models.pdf Graham Allison's third model], basically). If her emails read as a bit dramatic, it's only because she's writing for a future audience who will be looking back on her actions after a decisive victory.

The most frequently repeated complaints I've seen relate to believability and pacing. I wrote at length on the former issue in the discussion section, and I maintain that the course of events in the article are realistic in the context of the article's world. Realism and believability do seem to differ fairly often though. I probably could have smoothed out the pacing a bit by writing more, but that would have come at the price of lengthening the article beyond where I wanted it. Just some of those writer problems I suppose.

As a last note, I've always found it extremely interesting that a (apparent) majority thinks the Ethics Committee is in the right here. I didn't have a particular intention when it came to presenting one side or the other as right or wrong, but I would have assumed Sakarya's general grandstanding (and coup, I guess) to be more repellent. Even operating under the assumption that the previous Overseer Council had been unjust in their detention of the former Administrator, the new one continues that detention //and// expands it. It's always interesting as an author to see people coming away from a piece with different feelings than I expected.

Also, COMMANDMENT NOON is a great protocol name.

Hazard, Nebraska is another great name of a place for things to happen. 

If I recall correctly, I began drafting this soon after Doomcon was announced and published it before it started in earnest. Contests aren't really my thing in general, but it was a fun concept to work with. The first version was much shorter (somehow) and was rightfully shot down as being half-baked. This version's much better, though I still have some ideas for revising the overall presentation of redacted sections. The original intent of them was to show that the reader doesn't have high-level clearance, which in turn justifies why they can only see the titles of associated documentation. I'm sure there's a better way to get that across without outright stating it, but I haven't figured out what it is yet.

As I think some people could tell, I didn't have an incredibly solid idea of the events being described by the document titles other than things persistently getting worse. Maybe that's to its detriment, though I'm not sure it matters much. Overall, I don't have much else to say about this. The academic article title is great, SKYSCRAPER is also a clever name in context, and this article plays a role in my second tale series. It's one of my more divisive articles in terms of rating!

It somehow took me half a year to write this article. It started off as an 001 proposal about the immortality element, sidetracked into a more in-depth normal article about the exact means of immortality, and finally reached this form after an initial failure on the mainlist. The article's final form was largely inspired by the CIA's [https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/collection/documents-related-former-detention-and-interrogation-program RDI program] (see: torture) and some thinking on powerful institutions within the Foundation. There used to be a letter that spelled things out more clearly, but I cut it because... it spelled things out more clearly.

Sakarya really ends up in a bad place here, huh? You'd think she wouldn't have to put up with this kind of nonsense after getting that coveted seat on the Overseer Council. I don't usually feel bad for my characters, but I especially don't feel bad for her. I hope readers feel some pity at least, if only so the piece evokes //something//, but I'd feel worse if someone else was being put through this elaborate ringer. I think I might have made my own antagonist too much of a pain.

I wrote this in about four days total. The first draft was written in about 12 hours, and was much shorter than the current version. It didn't succeed, and you may be sensing a pattern here with my drafts. After I self-deleted that, I kicked it around for a week or so, asked a few people why they didn't like it the first time, and wrote a bunch more. Being able to spiral into increasingly surreal settings was a big incentive for me to keep working, which is probably apparent from the higher quality of writing in the deeper sections. The initial self-justifications are certainly the weakest part of the piece right now.

The conceit of the piece came to me when I was trying to think of how I could get away with redacting everything in an article. There's been a fairly clear trend through 3985 and 3649 with me and restricting information, but what really set my mind to this challenge was an episode of [[*user pxdnbluesoul]]'s [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-9506079/the-scp-cafe-podcast excellent podcast]. I don't recall the exact episode, but there was a discussion of redaction as a means to catch readers' attention and indicate that things were going to be different. In the end, that's already accomplished by its nature as an 001 proposal, but it's still a fun touch in my book. If anyone can think of a way to redact more of an article, I'd love to see it.

While some will disagree (and have), I don't think this article works half as well outside the context of an 001 proposal. There's no good in-universe justification for an empty article with a memetic kill agent otherwise, and adding an article at the start would slow the entire thing down in an unnecessary way. I personally think that its presence on the [[[SCP-001]]] hub also fleshes out the canon of that page by presenting an article that is clearly false in-universe. Variety would make sense in what's supposed to be a giant obfuscation of the truth.

I've said plenty on the structure of the article in the discussion section, but to sum it up: the Twine element is useful for presenting a shift in appearance to match the shift in perspective. It's intended to communicate that the reader is accessing a different narrative layer than they were before alone with the second-person point of view. Twine also enabled a lot of minute (and overt) changes in words, entire sentences, and whole paragraphs as the reader returned to a section. 

In terms of the story itself, Morgan and Grauer are technically named after two of the professors at my former graduate school, though I mostly picked the names because I think they flow well together. Emmet's name just sort of emerged. I'm sure I had some clever idea behind it, but it's escaping me for now. The characters of the characters largely flowed from their roles in the story. Morgan and Grauer are cold and authoritative because they're manifestations of cold authority. Emmet's generally pathetic because that's a trait that could motivate someone to toss away their life on something meaningless. The bureaucracy sludge is just doing its job. No one ever brings it the right forms.

Thematically, this draws on my general anxieties about career stasis, not achieving anything significant with life, and being small in the face of much greater things. The unpleasant feelings people have reported while reading it have been very validating. I'm glad I could properly convey those emotions through writing.

Finally, the way that the 001 proposals get treated by a segment of the site's readership is pretty corrosive. I think the in-universe security theater gets taken out-of-universe as a sign of inherent importance. They're still just stories. Don't go too nuts over it.

The third tale I wrote for the site, the second to survive, and the chronological first piece in [http://www.scp-wiki.net/maim-the-sky-slay-the-sun-hub Maim the Sky, Slay the Sun]. None of the characters in the series were particularly well fleshed out at this point, but the tale does a good job at establishing a few things:

The world of the series is one where issues are settled through violent means. The Overseer Council (or at least one overseer) is at the Ethics Commitee's throat, or maybe vice-versa. 

Egret is highly skilled, intentionally forgetful, and generally amoral. She substitutes direction for purpose, and feels good being useful.

Ahmadi is powerful in multiple ways, limited in others, and will do a great number of awful things to achieve her goals.

A few things raised in this tale are also intentionally never resolved in the series, including why half the night sky is absent stars and why exactly Egret was involved in selling secret information. She sure doesn't seem the type! This tale also has one of a few references to the Autumn Firm, a group formed by the merger and acquisition of most business-oriented groups of interest. Monopolies are dangerous things!

A new fighter joins the roster!

I'm incredibly partial to pairs of characters that play off each other in the way Dhole and her nameless accomplice do. Dhole's already-fun dialogue is even better when it's accompanied by another conversation line of the same type. Her bickering with Egret is good too, but characters being so synchronized that they're basically just two halves of a whole is even better. True friendship is a thing to be aspired to. Too bad that other half got murdered! 

I never quite got around to explaining what the pair where doing in the world aside from selling cognitohazardous books to people. I have some thoughts on it naturally, but it never quite seemed to come up in the course of a tale. I'll probably address it in the future, but I think it can be inferred from the content of my work and the conversations I've been slipping into my articles' infopages.

This tale also establishes a few new things in the setting, most predominantly that there's high levels of integration between the anomalous and mundane societies in some places. I imagine there are places throughout the world like that bar where people (and creatures) from both sides of the veil interact with relative impunity. They probably all have mysterious underground service elevators too.

Out of it all, I think my description of Egret beating back the cognitohazard is pretty great in terms of mechanics and imagery. Go me.

Shockingly, the pair doesn't get along.

I don't have a whole lot to say here, other than a humble request for everyone to feel bad for Dhole. Unlike a certain former chairwoman, she doesn't deserve most of what she's put through in this series. The fact that she's so easily beaten into doing awful things is almost certainly a reflection of suddenly being denied access to someone she'd spent her entire life with and relied heavily on to exist. Egret's an awful influence in contrast. That's not to say that she has no agency in all this, but I still think she's the closest thing this series has to a real victim. Her, and maybe the guy she shoots here.

This is the first tale I wrote involving any of these characters, and was the second I'd written for the site. My prose was pretty clunky at the time (at least in comparison to now), and I've revised it two or three times since posting.

I'm still very happy with this portrayal of Egret's internal workings. Her ability to cut away chunks of memory gets visualized, get aptitude for violence is continued, and it's just a weird place. The fact that it's all being used as a glorified fitness review is even better. I retroactively referred to it as 'weaponized mindfulness', and I wish I had figured out a way to work that into the story itself somehow.

The only connection this really has to the broader series is the main character. It does get at some of her history, mindset, and motivations, but that's still a pretty loose connection. I wouldn't have included it in the main series of tales, but it probably makes even less sense without that context. Egret's not exactly a character who is recognizable to most people on the site.

As always, the surreal nonsense bits (see: all of it) were the most fun to write. I especially liked the awful nightclub with a black hole in it. Writing all the dialogue as those distortion characters is a decision I'm still not particularly confident in, but it felt appropriate at the time. All that combined is probably why this is one of the lower rated (and commented-on) tales, but I like it all the same.

Watch some [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn_Notice Burn Notice] if you haven't. The setting and general atmosphere were inspired by it, and the first couple seasons are honestly just good TV.

I slotted this tale earlier in the series to do a better job explaining Sakarya's motivations and to set her up a bit stronger as the antagonist. Previously, the transition to the next tale has been very sudden and absolutely required reading 3985 to make sense. Reading that article still helps, but I'd hope this helped smooth things out. It also establishes that Sakarya is magic! This is relevant later!

Dhole listening to the news is always entertaining, I think some of the dialogue is pretty good as veiled threats go, and the entire thing is amusing if you imagine it happening with kids splashing around in the background.

It's Dhole's time to shine!

All my non-SCP fiction is firmly in the fantasy camp, so the setting of this piece came much easier to me than other things. People in weird masks getting stabbed with swords comes pretty easily too. Egret's bad influence is even more apparent here, especially after the influence manifests as a giant flock of birds. There's probably something poignant about Egret's only gift to Dhole being a pistol, but maybe not.

I do worry that the meaning behind all the mask switching gets a bit muddled somewhere in the middle of the story. They're supposed to be representations of how individuals in the society conceive of themselves at any given time as well as symbols of their personal aspirations. That most of the animals being represented in them have proxies on Earth is something that I don't explain mostly because I have no good explanation. It's //magic//.

This was originally the end to the series. I came back later after having some good ideas, but this still stands out to me as a pretty strong conclusion on its own.

It's pretty ambiguous in my eyes between it being Dhole's stressed mind manifesting a justification/guide for herself and an actual fragment of Egret's spirit, but I think the story works fine either way.

Some of the thaumaturgy throughout gets pretty handwavey, but I'm not generally interested in creating a perfectly explained magic system for people to try and understand as having internal rationality.
