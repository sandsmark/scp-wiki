**Item #:** SCP-1162-J

**Object Class:** Safe (pending review)

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1162-J must be stored under Biosafety Level 4 conditions. Under no circumstances may SCP-1162-J be handled without adequate BSL-4 protection or by personnel not in full Class A hazmat gear. Personnel who have been exposed to SCP-1162-J are to be subject to post-mortem incineration. In the case of containment compromise, full nuclear sterilization is considered automatically authorized.

**Description:** Inspection reveals SCP-1162-J to be similar in form to an ordinary bacon-and-cheese sandwich. Two slices of cheese are present within the sandwich, determined to be ████████ ████ and ██████ ████. Sauce of undetermined composition has also been located within the sandwich. SCP-1162-J's anomalous properties result from its bun, which is composed entirely of fried chicken. Despite this deviation from ordinary sandwich structure, SCP-1162-J maintains its sandwich designation through unknown means. 

SCP-1162-J was deposited into Foundation care on ██/██/████, by Agent ███████, who had spent the previous two weeks on leave. Agent ███████, after ensuring SCP-1162-J's prompt containment, left directions for immolation and promptly committed suicide. Elevated levels of sodium were indeed found within the corpse prior to destruction. The ultimate origin of SCP-1162-J is not known. Packaging originally found with SCP-1162-J at the time of containment identifies it as a Kentucky Fried Chicken "Double Down" sandwich, but Foundation scientists have judged it unlikely that any such product would have been designed by said company or produced on a large scale, being entirely inconsistent with all previous definitions of "sandwich" as well as its property of inducing violent revulsion in human subjects.

The effects of direct exposure to SCP-1162-J have never been observed, but are assumed to be rapid heart failure followed by death. Consumption in part or whole has been theorized to have the result of [DATA EXPUNGED] hazardous concentrations of sodium remaining in the corpses necessitating [DATA EXPUNGED] damage to nearby unprotected human subjects.

> It has only been in my sights for a few hours, yet I already understand the nature of this object. My I was warned about such things during my sabbatical at the Culinary Institute. They said that, at a certain time in every chef's life, the dark side would seduce us, trying to make us play their game. It tempts us with it's fatty, Grade-F meats and greasy cheeses. It promises money, power, influence; all this and more, all for the price of selling one's soul to the fast-food machine.

> **Observations**
> 
> Even as I type this sentence, it's artery clogging goodness is tempting me to break my every vow. Every tick of the clock brings me that much closer to denying my beliefs. But I must remain strong. You cannot tempt me, O' satan of foodstuff. I might not be a true chef, but I have the heart, no the //soul// of a true master chef! So bring it on, demon! Bring on your scrumptious brown crust and layers of moist processed cheese!

> **Conclusion**
> 
> I now know what I must do. This isn't a sandwitch, it's an ABOMINATION. As defender of all that is sacred in the culinary world, is falls upon me to cleanse the world of this nightmarish atrocity! I will slog through the pits of hell itself to ensure the destruction of the unholy one!  I WILL NOT BE STOPPED! I WILL NOT SURRENDER! I WILL- //(document becomes illegible)//[[footnote]]In light of Incedent ███-J, Dr. Edison is to be kept at least █ m from sharp objects while in the vicinity of SCP-1162-J.[[/footnote]]

**Addendum:** Testimony from research personnel assigned to SCP-1162-J has raised the possibility of a psychic lure effect emanating from SCP-1162-J, intensifying with exposure over time. This hypothetical effect manifests as a compulsion to consume part of SCP-1162-J, despite knowledge of health risks and the near-certainty of permanent physiological damage to be incurred by such an action, described as a "morbid curiosity". As a precaution, staff rotation has been instituted.

//Unverified reports have been forthcoming regarding sightings of additional instances of SCP-1162-J in the wild. I need not remind you of the potential hazard posed to the public by such manifestations. All agents have been cleared for unlimited funding with the aim of containing as many instances of SCP-1162-J as possible. Get these things off the streets and into an anomalous-object retrieval bag ASAP, people. You have your orders.//
