**Item #:** SCP-5757

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** A cartridge containing SCP-5757-A's data has been hardwired into an Atari Jaguar games console, in order to obtain a consistent video stream. Video output by SCP-5757-A is subject to algorithmic monitoring in order to ensure its accuracy.

Wildlife agents have secured the perimeter of the Everglades Agricultural Area C-139 Annex with unauthorized persons being refused access under the guise of ongoing restoration work.

Any attempt by SCP-5757-affected individuals enthralled by them to exit the C-139 Annex are to be repelled, lethal force is authorized for these efforts.

Attempts to recover those affected by SCP-5757 have been discontinued. Lethal force is authorized to enact these procedures, if that becomes necessary.

**Description:** SCP-5757-A is the data for an unreleased and unfinished piece of software. Entitled "Curse of the Everglade" it is written with the ICRDTA[[footnote]]"Incremental Code Routed Directly Through Arrays", a custom-built programming language that allows for the creation and execution of thaumaturgical computer programs.[[/footnote]] programming language and is only compatible with original Atari Jaguar hardware.[[footnote]]Attempts to run SCP-5757-A using emulation have been unsuccessful due to compatibility issues which may be arising from ICRDTA or the general difficulty in Jaguar emulation.[[/footnote]]

The game world of SCP-5757 appears to correlate directly to approximately 15,000 acres of land within an Everglades Agricultural Area, hereafter referred to as SCP-5757-B. Actions taken within SCP-5757's game space can and will change the physical landscape, topography, and population of SCP-5757.

]]

Any sentient or sapient entities within SCP-5757-B, including humans, will be represented as spherical sprites by SCP-5757-A. Within the game space there is a persistent text bubble displayed above any human-representing sprites, giving information on their status, mood, and occasionally brief transcripts of their vocalizations.

However, to date, it has proven impossible to play SCP-5757-A directly through the console - instead, it is believed that the game is played remotely by the first individual to gain physical access to SCP-5757-B with knowledge of its connection to SCP-5757-A.

[[collapsible show="Research Analysis" hide="Access Granted"]]

> Initially, we assumed that the threat from Subject 5757-1 would only grow as a result of it becoming more accustomed to its new capabilities. We did //not// anticipate the threat that would result from those capabilities expanding. I am writing, of course, of the skill tree that we found in the data of SCP-5757-A. As Subject 5757-1 expands its settlement and continues killing the local wildlife, it is gaining 'experience' - and it's using that experience to make itself more powerful.
>
> So far, we know it has access to these skills:
>
> * **Skill Share:** Skills possessed by one unit are shared by all controllable units. This is why they're all able to proficiently use the weapons they have access to.
> * **Vital Boost:** All of the units are much more durable than ordinary human beings - they move faster and hit harder, too.
> * **Revive:** If a living unit can get to a downed unit within a minute of it losing all its health, the downed unit can be revived.
> * **Fine Control:** We're fairly sure this is the latest skill Subject 5757-1 has acquired. Previously, SCP-5757-1's commands were limited to simple things like 'go here, move this there, attack this'. Now, we're not certain of the level of control it can achieve.
>
> The next skill to be achieved is **Animal Call** - which allows the player to recruit animal units as well as human ones. If Subject 5757-1 achieves control over //all// the local wildlife, I don't think I need to say how much more difficult containment will become.
>
> Tracking the rate of experience gain, we're fairly sure that Subject 5757-1 will unlock this skill in five days time. If we're going to eliminate this threat, this is our last chance.

> Mobile Task Force Delta-43, "Quarter Junkies" was mobilized on 1/16/2019 to carry out the neutralization of Subject 5757-1. All communications were broadcast through soundproof headsets with microphones.
> 
> Operational goal was to locate SCP-5757-1, activate targeting beacon, then retreat to a safe distance while HQ shelled the area. Equipment was standard for subtropical/jungle environments.
> 
> **<Begin Log>**

> **Agent Lent:** We've crossed through the perimeter. Check in, everyone.

> **Agent Decourcey:** One Quarter Junkie, Quebec, uniform, alfa, romeo, tango, echo, romeo...

> 
> **Agent Lent:** Squash it. We're going to have to get this stuff dry-cleaned anyhow.
> 
> **Agent Jesup:** Squashed. Let's go.
> 
> (//Approximately one hour of silence//)
> 
> **Agent Lent:** Command, we've got a problem. We're at the point, but not seeing any targets.
> 
> **Agent Jesup:** Doesn't look like anyone's been here in a hundred, two hundred years.
> 
> **Agent Decourcey:** Very scientific.
> 
> **Agent Jesup:** Bite me, Decs. I'm trying here.
> 
> **Agent Lent:** Shut up. Command, what are you seeing?
> 
> **HQ:** {{You should be able to see their position. What are you seeing?}}
> 
> **Agent Decourcey:** Mangroves, cypress trees, cypress knees, an orchid here, lot of mosquito. Expected fauna, no signs of habitation.

> **Agent Lent:** Wait, where's Davie?
