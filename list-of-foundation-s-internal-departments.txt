[[cell style="border: 1px solid white; text-align: left;"]]The Foundation's Medical Department is responsible for keeping employees in good health. Due to the Foundation's line of work, medics often encounter difficult and highly unusual cases of wounds, trauma, infections and disorders. Because of that, requirements for becoming a MD employee are very high. Some Foundation medics achieve a secondary area of expertise in working with cases of a particular object's influence.[[/cell]]

[[/row]]
[[row]]
[[cell style="border: 1px solid white; text-align: left;"]]The Foundation's line of work calls for a large amount of highly specialized professionals. This is usually related to SCPs that require much effort and unorthodox approach to contain them. For that, Mobile Task Forces are formed. MTFs are small teams (three to ten operatives usually, although groups with more than 20 operatives are not unknown) that specialize in specific roles or take care of specific situations. Every group has a name consisting of a Greek letter and a number; clarification prefixes and/or call signs may be employed in some cases. There is a total of ███ Mobile Task Forces.[[/cell]]

[[cell style="border: 1px solid white; text-align: left;"]]DEA is responsible for a wide spectrum of operations: planting disinformation, eliminating traces of SCP (both objects and the Foundation's) activity, D-class personnel enlistment and recruiting new employees in military and civil institutions. It is DEA who is responsible for covering activity of the Foundation's agents and facilities in populated areas. DEA is essentially the front line of the Foundation as it filters out all potential employees and is responsible for maintaining high standards among recruited personnel - this can also be called HR.[[/cell]]

[[cell style="border: 1px solid white; text-align: left;"]]ISD is a concealed "foundation within the Foundation", a sort of security police responsible for filtering traitors as well as light-minded and generally unreliable persons among the Foundation's ranks. The department is strictly hierarchical, therefore every verification is conducted in several steps. Potential ISD agents must have a perfect service record and a length of Foundation service of more than a year. Usually every ISD agent keeps his "official" position in order to provide his command a first-hand account of everything happening in a given department. The very existence of ISD is usually presented as a myth. The "official" responsibility of ISD is investigation and getting testimony from captured GOI agents, although that part of ISD officially belongs to Security Department for the purpose of secrecy.[[/cell]]

Manufacturing Department has several Sites and Zones wholly devoted to constructing a wide profile of custom-made or mass-produced items. Designing and manufacturing is often done on-site due to security reasons. For the same reasons neither the manufacturing staff nor the design documents ever leave the facility's limits. [[[site-45|Plant-45]]] is one of the largest of these facilities. These are usually stocked with modern equipment and are heavily guarded.[[/cell]]

Disposing of arising hindrances during shipments is also a top-priority action.[[/cell]]
