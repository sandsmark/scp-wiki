**Special Containment Procedures:** All satellite and flyover data of the SCP-4382 affected region must be actively censored. Blockades and checkpoints have been constructed along all roads leading to SCP-4382. Outpost 4382 will continue to monitor SCP-4382's rate of expansion.

All personnel assigned to SCP-4382 must work in paired teams; partners should be chosen with strong, preexisting relationships. If any member of staff begins to exhibit "looping" behaviors, contact the Outpost 4382 medical team immediately, then employ the following measures:

1. Speak their names loudly and clearly. Use varying titles and nicknames.
2. Use light physical contact such as shaking the shoulders or jostling. 
3. Make sudden, loud noises such as clapping, snapping, or shouting.
4. Elaborate on a shared experience or planned event. Focus on key sensory details.

**Description:** SCP-4382 is the town of Hulwick, Kentucky, U.S.A. Since October 18th, 2018, this town has been encased in a reality-altering anomaly, affecting 8.7km^^2^^ and expanding outward in a spherical radius at .5m^^2^^ per month. When viewed from the exterior, this sphere produces a mild visual distortion. Staff has described this phenomenon as "like the skin of a giant soap bubble."

All objects, animals, and people inside the town of Hulwick will continuously perform a single pattern of actions ad infinitum, and with total disregard for any physical laws. 

This effect is poorly documented, as the area of SCP-4382 causes severe aliasing and static interruption in all forms of visual data. Audio transmissions appear unaffected. On May 18th, 2019, MTF-Xi-5 "Newtons Bullies" [[footnote]] MTF-Xi-5 "Newtons Bullies" are a mobile task force specially trained and equipped for anomalous zones and alt-dimensional spaces deviating from baseline scientific principles. [[/footnote]] were dispatched to investigate this anomaly, and determine its source.

> **Site-9:** Roger, Xi-5. You are cleared to enter 4382. Locate the source of the anomaly, and contain if possible. If not, document everything you can. 
> 
> **Xi-5-1|Adamson:** You heard 'em Bullies. Let's get weird.
> 
> //The task force are observed by Outpost 4382 video-drones entering the distortion field; straight-line formation, five second delays.//
> 
> **Xi-5-1|Adamson:** Command, we're in. Looking up, the sun has completely changed position. It looks like early morning around here, and we're getting 3 ticks on the Hume already. Team, remember the protocols. No dwelling on anything. Vary up your sights, your sounds, and your thoughts. We've got a long hike into town.
> 
> **Xi-5-4|Saksa:** Yes Captain. 
> 
> **Xi-5-2|Higashi:** Confirmed, sir.

> **Xi-5-1|Adamson:** Good. Let's get moving. 
> 
> //16 minutes of radio silence; team chatter expunged.//
> 
> **Xi-5-1|Adamson:** Command, we're about 30 minutes out. We're coming up over a hill. I can see the main thoroughfare, and the clocktower. Anyone got eyes on a loop?
> 
> **Xi-5-2|Higashi:** Nothing yet, Captain. It's all baseline- I mean, except the fact we're walking through an October forest in May. This is kind of nice actually; I've always loved autumn. 
> 
> **Xi-5-4|Saksa:** I figure after eight months it gets old. Hold on- hey, Command? I've got a squirrel.
> 
> **Site-9:** 5-4, please repeat?
> 
> **Xi-5-4|Saksa:** Squirrel, Command; American Red, specifically. It's on a low branch of a nearby tree. I swear it's been chewing on the same acorn for the past twenty seconds.
> 
> **Xi-5-3|Banks:** I see it. I'm going to approach.
> 
> **Site-9:** Confirmed. Use caution, 5-3.
> 
> **Xi-5-3|Banks:** It's a friggin' squirrel.
> 
> **Xi-5-1|Adamson:** Banks.
> 
> **Xi-5-3|Banks:** I copy, Command.
> 
> //Xi-5-3 approaches the subject//
> 
> **Xi-5-3|Banks:** Huh. Yeah. It's not responding to my presence at all. I'm nearly touching the thing. The acorn...  woah, freaky. The squirrel is eating it in that typical turn-and-bite way, but the previous bites are growing back at an equal pace. It's like an endless acorn. I wonder wha- woah!
> 
> **Xi-5-4|Saksa:** Banks, you alright?
> 
> **Xi-5-3|Banks:** Uh, yeah, sorry. I just sort of, uh, flicked it. Now... yep. It's dead Command. It dropped right out of the tree. 
> 
> **Xi-5-1|Adamson:** You weren't cleared to engage, 5-3.
> 
> **Xi-5-3|Banks:** Sorry Captain; but it's good to know before we encountered any people, hey?

> 
> **Xi-5-1|Adamson:** 5-2. Higs. Higashi. Yasuo. Snap out of it, come on.
> 
> //Xi-5-2 does not respond. Very faint, repetitive mumbling is heard over Xi-5-2's coms.//
> 
> **Xi-5-4|Saksa:** Command, I think 5-2 is looping. He's crouched down by... a fern, I think. A drop of water is falling from one of the leaves, but before it reaches the ground, it re-appears on the leaf. It just forms, rolls, and drops. It forms, rolls, and drops. Forms, rolls, dro-

> **Xi-5-1|Adamson:** Lyydia!
> 
> **Xi-5-4|Saksa:** R- Ah! Fuck! I... sorry, Captain. I don't know...
> 
> **Xi-5-3|Banks:** Command, I think I've got 5-2. He's lucid, but he's a bit glossy-eyed.
> 
> **Site-9:** We've sent a retrieval team for 5-2. Should we scrub?
> 
> **Xi-5-1|Adamson:** Negative, Command. We're already here. Banks, Saksa, you're still green?
> 
> **Xi-5-4|Saksa:** That's a copy, Captain. Higs, hey buddy, keep looking at me, okay? Dispatch is coming; you'll be at the outpost in no time. You've got one of Molly's lunches waiting, remember? She always makes you the best lunches. You better wake up Higs, or I'm stealing your fucking lunch.
> 
> **Xi-5-3|Banks:** Hey! We've got a smile. Command, I'd like to report a smile here. I think he's alright... but all the same, tell that retrieval team to hustle up, hey?

>
> ------
> 
> **Xi-5-1|Adamson:** Command, this is Xi-5-1. We've reached the center of town. How's Higs?
> 
> **Site-9:** Copy 5-1. 5-2 is responding well. We've got him on the same treatment regimen as the recovered civilians from last year. We're seeing a good response to rapid visual stimuli.
> 
> **Xi-5-1|Adamson**: Thanks Coms, keep me posted. As for Hulwick... I have to tell you Command, this is one of the freakier ones.
> 
> **Site-9**: Please elaborate, 5-1.
> 
> **Xi-5-1|Adamson**: It looks like they were setting up a celebration when the anomaly occurred; that means they've been decorating for the last eight months non-stop. There's a woman ahead of me in a blue dress. She's climbing a ladder, and tying off one end of a banner. "Hulwick Harvest Festival", it says. She climbs down, moves the ladder across the street. Just as she finishes tying the other side, the first knot unravels, and the banner falls. She moves back across the street to string it up again, only for the other side to fall. She's repeated this pattern eighteen times now, and it's the same everywhere I look.
> 
> **Site-9**: Copy, 5-1. Remember, do not observe any single temporal loop for too long.
> 
> **Xi-5-1|Adamson**: I don't think this is temporal, Command. I'm not seeing any sudden "cuts" or speed deviations, and my Sandford is ticking on normally. Kant Counter is nearing a hard 8, though. I honestly think this might just be a Wildcat[[footnote]] An object or region defying one or more core scientific laws.[[/footnote]].
> 
> **Site-9**: Without a deviant temporal frequency?
> 
> **Xi-5-1|Adamson**: I'm telling you, we've got stable tempo in here. You almost wouldn't notice anything is wrong, if everyone wasn't doing the same thing repeatedly. Something must be actively maintaining the HUI[[footnote]] "Hume Pressure", or the amount of stabilizing force existing in a pocket of non-standard reality. [[/footnote]]. Something powerful. I can't imagine what though.
> 
> **Xi-5-3|Banks**: Neither can I Command, but I can guess where it is! Just did a quick 360 and, yep, guess what? The Humey is peaking when I aim it towards 4382's radial center. How nice, we were heading to Point Alpha anyway.
> 
> **Xi-5-4|Saksa**: Hey, guys, I've got a protracted loop here. Clocked it at six minutes.
> 
> **Xi-5-1|Adamson**: Damn, that is a long one! Report, Saksa.
> 
> **Xi-5-4|Saksa**: It's a kid on his bike. He's wobbling a bit as he rides; probably because of that big fuckin' shoulder bag he's got. He's riding along, then for a split second looks away from the sidewalk to re-adjust his bag, just in time for a group of boys to round out of an alley. They collide. 
> 
> One of the boys is knocked to the ground, and the kid falls off his bike. A bunch- like, six books fall out of his bag. The boys help their friend up, and start shouting at the bike kid. He scrambles to collect the books. One of the boys kicks a big red hardcover off the sidewalk, and it falls open-page on a sewer grate covered in wet clumps of leaves.
> 
> The boys laugh, and walk on. The bike kid is trying to dry the book off with his sleeve. He's crying, I think. I can't tell, and I don't want to get too close. He's wiping his nose a lot, at least. He gets back on his bike, and wobbles a bit before taking off. I've seen this exact scene play out three times already. The kid seems to be cycling around the block, and the alleyway boys keep doubling back. Cycle, collide, spill, kick, cry. Over and over.
> 
> **Site-9**: Thank you, 5-4. Please stop observing this loop.
> 
> **Xi-5-1|Adamson**: I'm seeing similar patterns, Command. Shorter loops. The same man forgetting his coat in the hair salon, going back for it, and walking out without it again. A trio of feral cats running between the legs of an old woman, making her stumble and drop a can of tomatoes from her grocery bags. A little girl skips by and helps her pick it up. Now cats run by again, she drops it again and- yep, there's the little girl. Command, I think the anomaly is causing closed loops; causal loops, actually. People are getting trapped in a cycle of actions. I'd almost say it's memetic, but, well, nobody has fallen over or starved. It's like the reality here is just allowing for it, until something stops it.
> 
> **Xi-5-3|Banks**: Like the squirrel.
> 
> **Xi-5-1|Adamson**: Yes, like the squirrel. Alright, let's group back up and head for Point Alpha.
> 
> //45 seconds of radio silence as the task force regroups.//
> 
> **Xi-5-1|Adamson**: 5-4, you with us? Lyydia?
> 
> **Xi-5-4|Saksa**: Hm? Oh, fine, Captain. Just thinking about that kid. What a fucking hell, huh? Eight months living that awful moment again and again.
> 
> **Xi-5-1|Adamson**: Not to him. None of the civilians we recovered from the outskirts remembered looping, Saksa. To that kid, it's just happening once.
> 
> **Xi-5-4|Saksa**: Once is too many.
> 
> //Task force begins moving through down again, heading for Point Alpha.//
> 
> **Xi-5-3|Banks**: Hey, Saksa? You still thinking about that kid? You're awful quiet.
> 
> **Xi-5-4|Saksa**: No, I'm just... there were boys like that in my home town too. Vicious little bastards. They'd always make fun of my hair.
> 
> **Xi-5-3|Banks**: Yeah, well, you're the Bully now, right? M.T.F. Xi-5 hey hey!
> 
> //Xi-5-4 does not respond.//
> 
> **Xi-5-3|Banks:** Hey?
> 
> **Xi-5-4|Saksa**: It's just- It's knowing that it keeps happening over and over, and there's nothing you can do about it. It's just like when I was a kid; I'd get to homeroom, sit at my desk and then Paavo's there pulling on my hair. He'd always do it so quick. The teachers never believed me. Every day, I'd just wake up, go to class, and there's Paavo pulling my hair. Every day, I'd just wake up, go to cla-

>

>

> **Site-9:** 5-3? 
>

Or… fuck, maybe he just can’t die? The man is trying to pull himself up towards a wall-mounted rotary phone. He keeps slipping back down the bloody wall, over and-... eugh. 
>

>

> **Xi-5-1|Adamson:** Holy fucking shit.
> 
> **Site-9:** Squad, report. What is it? What’s inside the garage?
> 
> **Xi-5-3|Banks:** It’s, uh... a machine, Command. I think. It’s like one of those spider web colonies that cover whole trees, just with wires and pipes and stuff. It's all scraps and pieces wrapped around this big metal stalk... you know those globes they have at the Science Museum? Van-De-Whatevers; the ones that make your hair stand on end. Its like one of those, except it has a glass sphere at the center with five metal balls inside. They’re all rolling around each other, over and over. Damn this is huge, Command. It's nearly touching the ceiling! 
> 
> **Site-9:** Confirmed. Do you see a power supply? Do the cables run anywhere? 
> 
> **Xi-5-3|Banks:** Yeah, everywhere. Hold on.
> 
> **Xi-5-1|Adamson:** Command, I’ve got something.
> 
> **Site-9:** A power supply?
> 
> **Xi-5-1|Adamson:** Negative. There’s a small desk tucked into the corner. I see some diagrams, a few equations- it’s all scribes but- huh. Command? I think this might be a journal. It’s signed "Seth McArthur”.
> 
> **Site-9:** Checking... confirmed, the home owners did have a son named Seth. 
> 
> **Xi-5-3|Banks:** That might explain who this is! I followed the cables around the back of the garage. There's a kid here, standing in front of a big... transformer, maybe? He doesn't look much older than 16. He keeps pressing buttons. Over and over. Red, orange, white. Over and over. Red, orange, white. Over a- gah! Damn it. The kid looks, I don’t know, panicked? He’s gritting his teeth, and his foreheads all sweaty… I can't be sure, but I think maybe he’s trying to shut it down.
> 
> **Xi-5-1|Adamson:** Or he might just be keeping it running, Command.
> 
> **Site-9:** What do you mean, 5-1?
> 
> **Xi-5-1|Adamson:** I’ve been skimming the journal, and it’s pretty clear the kid made this mess.  “January 5th, 2008. Nobody gets it. The world is wrong. Why can’t they see. Why doesn’t anyone listen to me. I’m the smartest kid in school. I skipped four grades. Even the teachers are stupid compared to me-“ Wow, seems like a nice kid.
> 
> **Site-9:** 5-1, does it say anything about the device?
> 
> **Xi-5-1|Adamson:** Hold on, there’s a lot here. It’s mostly nonsense. “I’ve read all the books. Every physics textbook in the school library, and it’s all wrong. I know it. It’s like we’ve skipped a number[[footnote]] It is currently unknown if this subject is/was aware of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-033 Theta Prime.] [[/footnote]]. All our predictions and theories are based on a faulty premise. I just know it. I don’t know how, but when I look at these equations, I just know they’re wrong. They’re all wrong. It’s all wrong.” Jesus kid, repeat yourself much? … aha! Here. “I can build it. It's so simple, that's how I'll show them all! Perpetual motion is possible, you just need the right machine. They just don’t get it; it's not about creating motion, it about creating a place where you change the constant of the universe.” Wait, what?
> 
> **Xi-5-3|Banks:** Command, hang on. I think I might have something here. The kid keeps hitting the same three buttons, but for a split second before he goes back to ‘Red’, his finger moves just a fraction closer to this little switch here. I think that might be the sequence!
> 
> **Site-9:** Negative 5-3, do not attempt to operate the device.
> 
> **Xi-5-1|Adamson:** “October 15th, 2010” Oh shit, Command, I think this is it! “I worked through the night. It’s nearly finished. I had to take apart nearly everything in the house. Dad was furious. He and mom confronted me this morning. They said I’ve been acting ‘queer’. They told me I need to stop skipping school. Dad knocked the microwave out of my hands. It was that moment I realized he'd never understand. Some minds are too small. Thankfully, I had my multi-tool with me. One more problem solved.” Jesus Christ.
> 
> **Xi-5-3|Banks:** Red, orange, white, to the switch. Red, orange, white, to the switch. Red, orange, white, to the switch. Re- ghuh! Command! I really think this is the sequence! I can shut this thing down!
> 
> **Site-9:** Negative 5-3. You are not to touch anything. Do you copy? 5-3, do you copy?

> **Xi-5-1|Adamson:** “October 15th, 2010, Part 2. It’s ready. The phone won't stop ringing in the house. I think my parents were supposed to help set up for that stupid festival. People must be wondering where they are. I need to hurry. None of it will matter soon. No one will care about two dead hicks when I've re-defined science. I've run through the first cycle, and it looks like the loop is stable. No energy in, no energy out, no energy lost. It's perfect. The diodes are rolling. Over and over. Over and Over. Over and over."

> **Site-9**: 5-1? Damn it. Captain Adamson, do you copy? We’re scrubbing the mission. Return to the evac point now.

> **Xi-5-1|Adamson**: Command, it’s fine. I’m just reading what he wrote. He just kept writing those words. “Over and over”. “Over and over. “Over and over.”

> **Xi-5-3|Banks**: Red, orange, white, switch. Red, orange, white, switch. Red, orange, white, switch.

> **Xi-5-1|Adamson**: “Over and over”. “Over and Over" "Something is wrong. The field is expanding. How can it be expanding?"

> **Xi-5-3|Banks**: Red, orange… hey! Command, this is 5-3! It looks like- yep, the lights are starting to flicker off. I think it’s shutting down! Even the kid seems to be waking up. Hah! We did it! Hey, kid, how in the hell-

> **Seth McArthur**: Wait! Wait oh fuck wait I need to-

> **Xi-5-3|Banks**: Whoa- whoa kid! Back away from the panel!

> //The high-pitched noise grows extremely loud. The sound of Xi-5-3 chambering a round in her gun is heard.//
> 
> **Xi-5-3|Banks**: Back away right now. Do not turn that fucking machine back on.
> 
> **Seth McArthur**: I’m not! You don't understand! I have to- oh, god, fuck, fuck!

> //The whine becomes overpowering. Garbled, panicked voices are barely audible.//
> 
> **Site-9**: Squad? 5-1, do you copy? Adamson, Banks, do you copy!?

> **Seth McArthur**: Whew, okay... I think that got it. I just needed to re-balance the-... I just-... oh... ohhhh.
> 
> **Xi-5-3|Banks**: What? What is it?

> **Seth McArthur**: I... just figured out where all the energy goes.

**Addendum 2019/05/18:** A helicopter fly-over of Hulwick shows a mushroom cloud originating from Point Alpha. No sound, or shockwave was detected by Outpost 4382. Most of the McArthur farm plot is enveloped. The cloud appears to be suspended in mid-combustion, fire continuously rolling beneath the upper cloud rim. 

**Addendum 2019/06/03**: The Hulwick explosion is still ongoing. Outpost 4382 reports the conflagration is animated, but the explosion itself is still static in shape and size. While the SCP-4382 anomaly has stopped expanding, the 8.7km^^2^^ "bubble" shows no signs of collapse. All testing and exploration of Hulwick have been suspended until a solution can be devised.

**Addendum 2019/08/19:** Outpost 4382, during an autonomous sonar sweep of the SCP-4382 interior, has detected a repeating communication signal from Captain Wes Adamson. Xi-5 Captain Saksa and Officer Higashi have filed an official request to mount an extraction mission. The Foundation has ruled that, due to their proximity to the explosion and length of time within SCP-4382, both Wes Adamson and Anna Banks shall be declared KIA. Xi-5's request has been denied.
