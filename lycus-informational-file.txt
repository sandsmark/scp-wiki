**Name:** Styles itself as a Doctor Lycus, although sources say its doctorate is made out of cardboard, glitter, and superglue. --Decided to mimic all the cool senior staff by including it in its name before realizing that shit was over.--

**Age:** Yes. SCP-[[image numerals.gif]]

**Gender:** Possibly

**Site of Operations:** Somewhere in the Northern hemisphere. Northern Ireland or Alberta, take your pick.

**Profile:** Some --guy-- --gal-- --entity-- --metafictional entity from Hell AKA New Jersey that spent way too long on making this page why did I do this-- that writes okay articles/tales for an online community. Claims of it actually being a sentient mass of //Lycus trabeatus// beetles in the shape of a 20 year old fan of pop music and irish mythology are currently under investigation.

**Commentary**

[[collapsible show="SCP-1322 "A Whole New World" (Cliche Contest Runner Up!) " hide="-"]]
My first SCP, and a joke to boot at that. I've tried writing for the wiki before at this point, but they mostly crashed and burned.

Then one day I was just kicking around in the IRC chatroom, when an idea came to me: wouldn't it be funny if there was a portal you could never enter, because you had another guy trying to come out? I got to work right away. 

Half way through, I had another bright idea: This would be hilarious if it was just an ordinary mirror. Roughly half an hour later I was getting some criticism, and then I posted it to the Cliche contest where I received widespread fame and recognition.

Almost won. Then a couple days later Woedenaz (sorry if I spelled that wrong) posted one of the best scp's I've ever seen, and rightfully won the category. If you guys haven't read 4205, go do that now.

This initially started as a containment breach which coincidentally led to Lilith and Cain meeting. The dialogue sucked, so that was benched and I wrote this instead.

Cain's perfect memory is something that's sometimes glossed over in his tales. Thousands of years that you can't forget? Gotta be something fun there. Initially I mused; how //exactly// would that happen? Part of his curse from God? From that came the Gate Guardian. He's always saying FORGET, what happens if he says REMEMBER? And I had my title.

Lilit's characterization in my headcanon (yes, I plan on using her in the future) is essentially summed up in this tale. Sure she got kicked out of the garden, but she's never been better. Part of that's because she didn't do what she did for selfish reasons, she did it for everyone, as blasphemous as they were. And I think He understands her viewpoint, at least grudgingly.

The Spear of Those Forgotten was something I made up for this tale. In my mind, it's something similar (or perhaps the same) as what the O5's did to wipe out the faeries and erase their Names.

This was a tale was somewhat an experiment of my writing skills. I had an idea, wrote it down, and then published it all in about 12 hours, including the time I took to sleep on it. I wanted to test myself, see if I actually had what it took to write interesting stories.

Remembrance, as you can probably tell from my first tale, is an interesting subject to me. I'm not sure why. 

Pangloss, is someone that I've always been fond of. He's a rare, benevolent figure. He appeals to me the same reason SCP-4999 appeals to everyone: he makes us realize that we're not alone. And while my view of Pangloss may be different from others, I'm satisfied with it.
