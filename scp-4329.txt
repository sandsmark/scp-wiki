**Item #:** SCP-4329

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4329-A is publicly listed as a communal property belonging to the ‘Escerpan’s Church of Saints’ sect.[[footnote]]A pseudo-religious Foundation front claiming to be a small denomination of the Latter Day Saint movement.[[/footnote]] 

Individuals attempting to access SCP-4329-A without permission are to be apprehended, questioned, then released to local law authorities if necessary; standard ‘Escerpanian’ doctrine can be cited to justify questioning.

SCP-4329-A is to be checked daily for unauthorised FM radio receivers tuned to SCP-4329-B’s radio band. Any encountered are to be logged and relocated outside SCP-4329-B’s broadcast range or destroyed if necessary.

Quotes recited by SCP-4329-B are to be recorded and logged, along with a record of the respective item/s. Items manifested by SCP-4329 must be located as soon as possible; on-site personnel must exhibit extreme caution as the items could be hazardous or lethal. 

SCP-4329-B is to be constantly monitored for any deviation in behaviour.

In the event inhibition of SCP-4329-B becomes necessary, the 9:00 AM news broadcast of ‘[DATA REDACTED]’ is to be delayed for as long as needed. If necessary, ‘[DATA REDACTED]’ is to be shut down indefinitely to potentially neutralise SCP-4329.

**Description:** SCP-4329 is an anomalous radio broadcast (SCP-4329-B) occupying the ███.█ FM band, localised to the property boundaries of [DATA REDACTED], Beerwah, Australia (SCP-4329-A).

External to SCP-4329-A, the ███.█ FM band is used by ‘[DATA REDACTED]’, a local radio station; --to date, no connection between SCP-4329 and ‘[DATA REDACTED]’ has been found.-- While within the property, the transmissions of ‘[DATA REDACTED]’ appear to be totally suppressed by SCP-4329-B.

Attempts to triangulate the source of SCP-4329-B have been unsuccessful; tests conducted indicate that SCP-4329-B originates a significant distance north-west of SCP-4329-A, rendering the source impossible to locate since the transmission cannot be detected outside of SCP-4329-A. Of note is that Mount Coochin, the closest mountain to SCP-4329-A, is located north-west of the property.

Each day --at 9:00 AM local time-- coinciding with the 9:00 AM news broadcast of ‘[DATA REDACTED]’, a male voice will recite a quote via SCP-4329-B. No theme or relation has yet been identified between these phrases; identified sources include book excerpts, (presumed) packaging labels, TV or video game dialogue, internet memes, song lyrics, sentences from confidential documents, jokes and brand slogans.

The remainder of SCP-4329-B’s broadcast time comprises entirely of continuous, faint breathing.

Immediately following the conclusion of an SCP-4329-B vocalisation, a random object will manifest somewhere within the boundaries of SCP-4329-A. No correlation between an object and its corresponding phrase, nor between each of the objects, has yet been identified.
