**Item #:** SCP-1787

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1787 is to be contained in standard living quarters with suitable furnishings, including a bed, a bedside table and a lamp, a recliner and a workbench. Other entertainment materials such as books and musical equipment are to be given at the discretion of the on duty researcher. SCP-1787 is only allowed access to its tools during its weekly (or daily for larger ‘projects’) whittling sessions. Otherwise they are to be kept in a locked drawer in Dr. Scooter’s office. 

All deliveries are to be taken to SCP-1787 living quarters after screening. One armed guard and one licensed veterinary physician are to be present when SCP-1787 ‘whittles’. Dog food and a water dish are to be provided during these sessions and any unfinished creations are to be transported to the on-site kennel and treated like a normal dog (as far as physically possible) until the next session and the creation is finished.

All of SCP-1787’s creations are to be physically and chemically analysed, before being euthanized, samples to be taken and frozen, and the remains incinerated. SCP-1787 is to be told that its creations are sent to caring homes.

SCP-1787 is to be made to believe he is in a retirement home in ██████, Italy.

**Description:** SCP-1787 is an Italian man, approximately 65-70 years old and is 1.7 meters tall. SCP-1787’s appearance is consistent with its age and remarked as being an ‘ordinary old man’.

Once per week, SCP-1787 will receive one (1) package regardless of its location. Packages are only marked with SCP-1787’s name █████ ████████, a breed of domesticated dog (//Canis lupus familiaris//), a sex and a return address [[footnote]] This return address leads to an abandoned dog kennel in ████, █████ [[/footnote]]. Packages ranges between ten (10) cm^^3^^ and seventy-five (75) cm^^3^^  and weighs between three (3) to eighty (80) kilograms (these ranges typically correspond to the average weight and size of the dog indicated on the package).

Inside the package is a cube of flesh, usually coated in fur that SCP-1787 uses as a sculpting media. DNA testing at this stage identifies it to be canine. SCP-1787 will use a variety of bladed instruments, such as planes, files, knives and chisels to carve out a dog in according to the desired specifications written on the package. This can take, depending on the size of the dog and the ‘quality of the material’, between 6 hours and 5 days.

During this process, SCP-1787 will carve out canine features. ‘Finished’ sections of SCP-1787s carvings will become animate and respond as expected for a domesticated dog to it’s master (I.e. a carved tail wags, a finished mouth and jaw area will bark and pant.) The animal shows no sign of pain whilst other parts of its body are being carved and sculpted (and have shown signs of boredom until it is finished.) A finished creation by SCP-1787 is identical, physically and genetically to a naturally bred canine of the same breed.

Who provides the packages and how they are made is unknown. SCP-1787 is unable to answer beyond that ‘an old friend’ sends it the materials. Whether he is unwilling to help or does not know due to memory loss in old age is still to be determined.  

SCP-1787 was discovered in ██████, Italy, after one of its unfinished creations bit a tourist. Local authorities were alerted and embedded agents retrieved SCP-1787 from its workshop without incident. Class-C amnesiacs were administered to the tourists and a cover story that the individual was attacked by a stray dog was easily planted.
