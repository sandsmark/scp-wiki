**Special Containment Procedures:** The town of Bend, Oregon has been evacuated and occupied by the Foundation. Major highways traveling through the town have been reconstructed away from the anomaly. A 3.6-meter tall steel fence has been constructed around the town to prevent civilian entry. The town is to be patrolled by STF-Lambda-17 (“Live Studio Audience”) for possible civilian entry and SCP-3462-A expansion. Personnel tasked with guarding SCP-3462 are to be housed in Temporary Site-5T1, located at the Southwest edge of the town. The borders of SCP-3462-A are to be marked by portable warning signs that state “DO NOT CROSS” in simplistic black lettering. Any distortion to this information is to be immediately reported. If SCP-3462-A is found to have expanded, D-Class personnel are to test the borders by placing one of the labeled signs and observing for possible degradation. VHS tapes thought to fall within SCP-3462’s restrictions are to be stored within Temporary Site-5T1. A VHS tape containing a list of films already provided to SCP-3462 is to be kept on site.

Once every week, one nonviolent D-Class personnel is to be given a VHS tape thought to follow SCP-3462’s restrictions, standard memetic resistance gear used by mobile task forces, and a trackable form of motorized transportation to ensure delivery. The subject is to then bring the tape to SCP-3462’s location and leave it at the entrance of the store. This is to be performed as soon as possible to prevent the possible expansion of SCP-3462-A. Once the film is delivered, SCP-3462 is to be observed from a safe distance to see if the film is rejected. 

Films considered for SCP-3462 are to be reviewed several times by multiple personnel familiar with SCP-3462’s presumed restrictions and previously rejected films. Films rejected by SCP-3462 are to be analyzed for any similarities in traits with other rejected and accepted films. Agents operating within the MPAA are to attempt to decrease the rating of older movies to increase the number of films accepted by SCP-3462. Research into a permanent method of mitigating or lessening the effects of SCP-3462-A is currently underway and considered a top priority. 

**Description:** SCP-3462 is a humanoid entity within a heavily damaged Blockbuster video rental store. SCP-3462 is constructed of the film reel of various destroyed VHS tapes located within the building. The only surviving tape within the store is a copy of //The Brave Little Toaster//, which is embedded within the entity’s chest. Despite its construction, SCP-3462 has shown to have the strength of a baseline human, along with being able to withstand severe damage to itself by replacing damaged portions of its body with nearby film reel. It is unknown if SCP-3462 is sentient, though its actions while in containment have suggested some form of sapience. It is unknown if SCP-3462 is able to leave its current location, as it has not made any attempt to do so.

[[include component:image-block name=Inside.png|caption=A photo of the store interior transmitted by a remote drone shortly before complete degradation took place.]]
SCP-3462-A is an effect surrounding SCP-3462 that causes the degradation of all recorded information exposed to it. Physical information within SCP-3462-A will show effects similar to exposure to extreme heat or caustic chemicals. This effect extends to things such as written words, drawn images, photographs, and electronic data. This will also cause damage to any surrounding material not containing information. The only objects found to be unaffected by SCP-3462-A is information contained on VHS tapes and a standard CRT television with a connected VCR[[footnote]]Videocassette recorder.[[/footnote]] located within SCP-3462’s building (tentatively designated SCP-3462-B). 

When an individual enters SCP-3462-A, they immediately begin to experience brain atrophy, particularly in the hippocampus. Subjects will also begin to experience a swelling of the vocal cords, resulting in significant difficulty when speaking. This results in symptoms similar to short-term memory loss. After 15 minutes of exposure, large portions of the medial temporal lobe will begin to atrophy, eventually causing the inability to form or recall memories. Once this stage is reached, the vocal cords will continue to swell, causing a blockage of the throat and invariably asphyxiation. SCP-3462-A had extended approximately 0.2 kilometers from SCP-3462 at the time of discovery. As of the last revision to the documentation, this effect currently extends approximately 4.1 kilometers from SCP-3462. 

At the end of every week, SCP-3462-A will extend a distance between 20 and 300 meters. To prevent this expansion from occurring, SCP-3462 is to be provided a movie during the week that meets to the entity's requirements. SCP-3462’s requirements are unknown and have only been interpreted through the VHS tapes that the entity deems to not follow them. Due to this, many requirements thought to exist have either conflicted with other requirements, were present in only certain films accepted by SCP-3462, or were unrelated to the film in question. The only requirements that have been proven to exist are that:
* The film was commercially released to the public in a VHS format.
* The film has not yet been incorporated into SCP-3462
* The film does not have an average score of less than 35% on a variety of online movie review websites
* The film does not have higher than a PG-13 rating by the MPAA
* The contents of the tape have not been edited or modified after its manufacturing
For a full list of theorized requirements, please see Document-3462-TR

Once the movie is provided, SCP-3462 will place the movie within SCP-3462-B and watch its contents. If the movie meets the requirements set by SCP-3462, it will forcefully remove the reel from within the tape and add it to SCP-3462’s mass upon the movie’s conclusion. If the contents do not meet the requirements, SCP-3462 will place the VHS on one of the remaining shelves within the store.

SCP-3462 was first discovered on 09/26/20██ following detections of a possible infohazard in the town of Bend, Oregon. Upon SCP-3462’s discovery by MTF-Lambda-14 (“One Star Reviewers”), several miscellaneous VHS tapes were found within a locked safe in the back room office. Select portions of these tapes have been transcribed below for the purpose of understanding SCP-3462’s origin. 

> **Tape Label:** Team Meeting for Jim
> 
> **[BEGIN LOG]**
> 
> //Several employees are seen gathered in the center of the store around a man dressed in a striped polo shirt and black pants.//
> 
> **Center Individual:** Alright, alright, listen up. Before I start, is anyone not here?
> 
> **Individual Recording:** Jim is taking a sick day but I’m recording it for him. Other than that, I think we’re all here.
> 
> **Center Individual:** So, I assume you’ve all noticed the lack of activity in the store lately. Customers have stopped coming in, we’ve had to lay off a few employees, just a general drought in sales. 
> 
> //Crowd begins to quietly talk among themselves.//
> 
> **Center Individual:** However, I’ve found a way to bring us back to the top! We’ll bring back the old joy of walking into Blockbusters and renting a movie with your family! The excitement of opening your mailbox and seeing a package from our store! But I need you all to help. I’ll be having inspectors come in to make sure we’re a good fit for their help, so all of you need to be at the top of your games. Whether it’s stocking the shelves, cashing out a customer, whatever you’re doing. Make sure it’s the best you can do!
> 
> //Applause from the crowd. One employee near the front of the crowd raises their hand.//
> 
> **Center Individual:** Yes Caroline, what is it?
> 
> **Caroline:** Uh, not to be rude or anything, but who are you making this deal with?
> 
> **Center Individual:** Never mind that. Just know that it took a lot of convincing for them to consider us for their program. Now that the issue is settled, get out there and be the best you can be!
> 
> //Employees begin to return to their jobs. The man in the center of the group makes his way to the back of the store. The camera is angled towards the ground, but continues recording.//
> 
> **Individual Recording:** (//Hushed tone//) What was that all about?
> 
> **Unknown Individual:** (//Hushed tone//) No clue. Probably just an attempt to stop employees from quitting because of the drop in purchases.
> 
> **Individual Recording:** Maybe.

**Tape Label:** Security Footage 07/12/20██

**Additional Information:** The footage shows the view of three cameras positioned within the building and the footage of an additional camera placed above the front entrance of the store.

**[BEGIN LOG]**

06:34:05 - An employee is seen standing behind the checkout counter of the store. Three separate individuals are seen walking through the aisles of the store. The employee at the counter is visible  packing VHS tapes into a cardboard box. 

06:36:18 - One of the individuals is seen walking to a back corner of the store. He proceeds to produce a black ski mask and a small handgun from the interior of his jacket. He then places the mask over his head and quickly walks up to the front counter.

06:36:45 - The masked man begins pointing the handgun at the cashier, demanding all of the money from within the cash register.

06:36:51 - The cashier complies and begins hurriedly pulling out large sums of money. The masked individual glances over to the cardboard box.

06:37:07 - The other two customers notice the commotion. Both individuals quickly exit the store, with one individual pulling a mobile phone out of their pocket. 

06:37:45 - The cardboard box begins visibly shaking. The masked individual slowly lifts one of the flaps on the box.

06:38:19 - Strips of film reel extend from the box wrapping around the masked individual. The man begins yelling obscenities while more film reel begins to appear. The employee yells and ducks under the counter. 

06:38:24 - The man shoots at the film reel to no apparent effect. The reel then constricts around the man, completely immobilizing him. 

06:38:44 - The man begins yelling obscenities while more film reel begins to extend from the box, completely constricting him. 

06:39:27 - The man is partially lifted into the air and is dragged into the cardboard box. Once the man is completely inside, the flaps on the box close the man inside. Muffled yelling is heard from within the box. 

06:40:31 - All sound and movement from the box suddenly cease. The employee slowly lifts herself from under the counter. She then steps around the box and quickly runs out of the store.

A voice is heard behind the door similar to the man in business attire observed in Team Meeting for Jim.//

> **Mr. Harding:** That’s normal around this time of year. People want to enjoy the summer before school starts, make sure they get one trip to the beach, that sort of thing. 
> 
> **Shannon:** No, not like that. I mean not showing up to work at all. Thursday I worked with Matt during the night shift and I haven’t seen him since. No note, no text, no letter of resignation. Nothing.
