**Subject:** We've been over this and over this...let me get some sleep.

**Interviewer:** //You'll get it...once your debrief is over.//

**Subject:** What have you done with Dr W██████?

**Interviewer:** //As I keep telling you, there's no such person. You've seen the personnel manifest...do you think I'm trying to mislead you?//

**Subject:** (no reply)

**Interviewer:** //You don't remember researcher B██████? You've worked with him a number of times before. According to him, you've developed a degree of friendship...//

**Subject:** I've never heard of him. I don't know who that is.

**Interviewer:** //But you acknowledge that he knows personal details about you. How could he know those things? Like who you dated at University? The name of your sister's children?//

**Subject:** (tiredly) I don't know. I don't know how.

**Interviewer:** //So you say.//

**Subject:** So I say... do you mind?

**Interviewer:** //Go ahead.//

**Interviewer:** //You said before about the change you used to buy the soda...you didn't recognize who's on the dime.//

**Subject:** (tiredly) That's right.

**Interviewer:** //According to you, who's supposed to be on the dime?//

**Subject:** FDR.

**Interviewer:** //Yeah, well, that's who's on the dime.//

**Subject:** No it's...it's not...he's not in profile. Can't you remember? It's famous for being a strange...portrait, picture, whatever. With his characteristic ... leer? You know what I mean.

**Interview:** //I can say I...//

**Subject:** (yelling) Why are you doing this? Is this a psychological .... are you trying to disorient me, see how much it takes to make me...

**Interviewer:** //You know that's not true.//

**Subject:** (unintelligible)

**Interviewer:** //It may be that the artifact has affected your memory.//

**Subject:** Sure.

**Interviewer:** //You think that's unlikely?//

**Subject:**...I don't know what I think. Can we....can we resume this tomorrow? I need to...I need some sleep.

**interviewer**: //Security will escort you to your quarters. Your security clearance is temporarily suspended. Let me emphasize 'temporarily'. You are not to discuss these events with anyone.//

**Subject:** I just want to go to bed.

**Interviewer:** //Drop by the pharmacy. They'll give you something.//

**Subject:** I don't want a tranquilizer.

**Interviewer:** //Suit yourself.//
