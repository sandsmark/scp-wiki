**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5330 is to be kept in a standard containment locker in the High-Security Anomalous Items Storage wing of Site-37, and is not to be removed from storage under any circumstances. Testing on SCP-5330 is forbidden.

**Description:** SCP-5330 is a small, engraved metal box, secured with a latch and displaying signs of slight oxidation. The material composing SCP-5330 is impermeable to physical force and the latch securing it cannot be released. The contents of SCP-5330 are uncertain; it is believed to be empty.

If SCP-5330 enters the potential field of vision (regardless of visual acuity or ambient light levels) of a human, they will become subject to a series of anomalous miniaturized detonations centralized in their cranium. These detonations originate in the cerebellum and move outwards, invariably resulting in severe cranial damage, brain hemorrhage and subsequent expiry within 5 to 10 seconds of initial observation. This effect does not extend to photographs or recordings of SCP-5330.

**Supplemental Material - Incident 5330-030920:** On 03-09-2020, severe seismic activity in the vicinity of Site-37 caused a total power failure and subsequent site evacuation and lockdown, during which a significant number of dangerous SCP objects breached containment. Additionally, numerous storage lockers were compromised, including that of SCP-5330, and their contents were scattered across the High-Security Anomalous Items Storage wing. 

Assistant Researcher Marcus Cromwell was unable to evacuate and was trapped inside the High-Security Anomalous Items Storage wing, which was rendered inaccessible by multiple automatically sealing bulkheads; he was not located for over a week, as the wing could not be breached.

Appended below are several audio logs recorded by Cromwell on an emergency terminal over the first 48 hours following Incident 5330-030920.

Useless for this specific terminal, but if I can severely overcharge them with the reserve power, I might be able to create a makeshift bomb and blast my way through the wall.
