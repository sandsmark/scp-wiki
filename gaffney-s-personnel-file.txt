[[/div]]
**Full Name:** Dr. Ali Zamir Kamelov

**Security Clearance:** Level 3

**Location:** Site 437

**History:** Born in Tashkent in 1891, Dr. Kamelov attained multiple PhDs from Moscow State University including Theoretical Physics (1913), Biological Sciences (1915), and Art Theory (1922). In 1924, he was selected to join the fledgling Комитет по Исследованию Аномальных Явлений (Committee For The Investigation of Anomalous Phenomenon) as a junior researcher. Over the course of the next decade, he rose to the rank of Assistant Chief Researcher for Central Asia. In 1934, Dr. Kamelov was recruited to the Foundation by Agent ██████.

Due to the cumulative effects of over ██ years of constant chain smoking, Dr. Kamelov's office is to be considered a Class-Two chemohazard.

**Note:** Due to Dr. Kamelov's ongoing obsession with Lysenkoism and refusal to accept modern genetic theory, all reports with relevant information regarding genetics and/or evolution are to be edited by Junior Researcher Gaffney. Under no circumstances is Dr. Kamelov to be made aware of this arrangement.
