**Item #:** SCP-257

    **Object Class:** Keter -- Neutralized

    **Special Containment Procedures:**

        [DATA EXPUNGED]

        [UPDATE]: SCP-257 no longer requires special containment protocols. SCP-257            
        has been sealed inside a 2 foot wide solid plastic cube and placed in secure 
        storage awaiting disposal via [[[SCP-101]]].

    **Description:**

       [DATA EXPUNGED]

       [UPDATE]: SCP-257 appears to be a several year old human sized skull, with the 
       addition of a pair of horns and writing on the more flat surfaces. The horns are in
       the middle of the parietal, off to either side of the skull. They are almost perfectly 
       smooth, and despite the actual shape of the horns being simple crescent moon 
       shape, all people viewing SCP-257 in person or via picture ascribe them as looking 
       humorous, while the exact shame shape in any other material or picture 
       draws no reaction.
 
       The writing on the the skull, covering most of the frontal, parietal, occipital, 
       sphenoid, maxilla, and mandible sections, is clearly legible, etched into the skull 
       with near laser precision. The words are easily readable, and seem to exist in 
       English, French, German, Latin, and Chinese simultaneously. The messages written 
       all seem to be curses and wishes of dark intent towards the reader of the words, 
       though the vocabulary, grammar, and syntax are juvenile at best. The 
       messages reference hell, demons, and the writer being tricked quite often.
