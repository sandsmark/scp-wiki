**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment for SCP-5511 is focused on investigating the cause of and attempting to prevent another occurrence of SCP-5511. All witnesses of the victims' deaths have been amnesticized, with the corpses being cremated to prevent investigation of the cause of death. Cover stories for their deaths have been disseminated. A disinformation campaign, painting the projection to the moon as a marketing stunt, is currently underway.

**Description:** SCP-5511 is an event that took place over the night of 2020/02/012 in which a total of 84 civilians died by having their heads spontaneously explode with a force of around one milliton [[footnote]] Equivalent of one kilogram of TNT. [[/footnote]]. This caused another 20 people to die from the force or resulting debris, with over 30 being left injured. During this time, a projection of red letters (SCP-5511-1) appeared on the surface of the moon, changing whenever a new victim appeared. No cause or pattern could be found in any of the victims that could lead to finding a possible perpetrator. 

Below is a list of a few notable victims, with the resulting change in SCP-5511-1. A full list is available to anyone assigned to this project with a clearance of Level 2 or higher.
