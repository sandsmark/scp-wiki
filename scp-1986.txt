**Item #:** SCP-1986

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** As SCP-1986 is immovable and located in a heavily travelled public building, security must be maintained covertly in order to prevent the public from becoming aware of its existence. Guards posing as library staff are to be deployed. Only non-lethal measures have been sanctioned.

**Description:** SCP-1986 is a cylindrical tunnel ~2m wide lined with volumes of books. Although the full extent of the tunnel is unknown, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (IfSAR) has established a minimum depth of 274,700km or nearly 1 light-second (expeditions have confirmed a depth of at least 4,441km). The conjecture has been advanced that the tunnel may be infinite. [[footnote]]SCP-1986's discovery was occasioned by a librarian trying to identify the source of a draft. Measurements indicate that the tunnel consumes roughly 400m^^3^^/h, i.e. a pressure differential of 25Pa (N/m^^2^^) and a draft velocity of 100cm/s. Where the air is being drawn to is unknown. _ [[/footnote]]

The volumes lining the tunnel often resemble known works, though with substantial alterations as to style, character, plot and subject matter. Authors are occasionally authentic ones, though often they are wholly unknown. The works range from being somewhat unusual to completely non-sensical, though nominally at least intelligible (see the section **Recovered Works**). All languages currently extant as well as extinct ones are represented. In no case has any volume borne any publication information. Dating techniques have established that the volumes originate from the era they would otherwise appear to, based on semantic and linguistic considerations. No discernible pattern[[footnote]]One researcher has put forth the evocative comparison that searching the tunnel for a recognizable book is like traversing the real number line in search of the rational numbers. _ [[/footnote]] has been found to the arrangement of the volumes.

The walls of the tunnel are made of ordinary limestone. Attempts at breaching them have shown that the tunnel is non-Euclidean i.e. to excavate through the floor is to emerge from the ceiling (topologically,[[footnote]]The 3-torus is a three-dimensional compact manifold with no boundary. It can be obtained by gluing the three pairs of opposite faces of a cube. (After gluing the first pair of opposite faces the cube looks like a thick washer, after gluing the second pair — the flat faces of the washer — it looks like a hollow torus, the last gluing — the inner surface of the hollow torus to the outer surface — is physically impossible in three-dimensional space and can only be accomplished in at least four dimensions.) _ [[/footnote]] it can be likened to a 3-torus). Attempts at reaching the tunnel at an angle have proven futile as the tunnel is absent unless approached from its entrance.

**Discovery Log:**
SCP-1986 was discovered in 1989 by a librarian[[footnote]]Before the librarian who discovered the artifact was voluntarily administered an amnesic, he brought to the attention of Foundation personnel a story by the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges entitled "The Library of Babel". It is noteworthy that Borges worked at the same library. He was unable to be interviewed as he died in 1986. The following is an excerpt from that story:

> ...These examples made it possible for a librarian of genius to discover the fundamental law of the Library. This thinker observed that all the books, no matter how diverse they might be, are made up of the same elements: the space, the period, the comma, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. He also alleged a fact which travelers have confirmed: In the vast Library there are no two identical books. From these two incontrovertible premises he deduced that the Library is total and that its shelves register all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd orthographical symbols (a number which, though extremely vast, is not infinite): Everything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels' autobiographies, the faithful catalogues of the Library, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of Basilides, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every book in all languages, the interpolations of every book in all books..."
[[/footnote]] in an unused basement of //La Biblioteca Nacional de la República Argentina// located in Buenos Aires. Foundation personnel administered class B amnesics to those who had been made aware of its existence and cordoned off the basement under the guise of performing emergency structural restoration.

> **Language**: //Various//
> **Depth of recovery**: 11,212m
> **Description**: A condensed novelization of another book that purports to contain the sum of human knowledge. The content appears to be a mixture of many languages including English, German, French, Farsi, and Sumerian.

> **Title**: //Hattard//
> **Author**: //Darius Jackson//
> **Language**: English, non-standard
> **Depth of recovery**: 12,447m
> **Description**: A dramatization of a purportedly true story that occurred during the Great London Earthquake of 2007. It follows the story of the Hattard triplets, residence of London at the time, and their successful attempt at reaching a refugee camp after two weeks of wandering the fallen city.

In the afterword, the author writes that the triplets were treated as national heroes and awarded the Damehood by King Albert III.

> **Title**: //Je Sais Que Vous L'avez Fait// (trans: I Know You Did it)
> **Author**: //Miriam Cotillard//
> **Language**: French
> **Depth of Recovery**: 1,083 meters
> **Description**: A novella written in the first person in which the author spends the entire story accusing the reader of having stolen her shoe. The novella is divided into twelve (12) chapters, each themed after one of the Zodiacal signs. An overarching theme throughout the text is the 'Seven Stages of Dying', with the writing style reflecting said stages (e.g. pages in the anger sections have been printed in boldface). An epilogue by the author acts as an apology, admitting she had since found her shoe underneath a sofa.

> **Title**: //The Last Words//
> **Author**: //Dutch Schultz (as channeled by Talaimal Langeshlem, PhD.)//
> **Language**: Hindi
> **Depth of Recovery**: 41,285 meters
> **Description**: Purports to be the lengthy record of a seance performed over 40 days between a self-styled clairvoyant and the late 20th century crime-figure Dutch Schultz (whose dying words were in fact transcribed by a police stenographer while he lingered between life and death from a gun-shot wound to the head). The text is identical to the words actually transcribed, but with the addition of considerable material, rendering it intelligible. This "unexpurgated" version recounts in heroic form the history of Man from the Bronze age to the beginning of the 21st century. The epilogue castigates the use by other authors of the "false" transcript in what it terms to be "derivative and heretical" works (notably, the author William Burroughs and the authors Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson).

> **Title**: //An English-Cetacean Phrasebook//
> **Author**: //Various//
> **Language**: English, Dolphin (presumed)
> **Depth of recovery**: 191,214m
> **Description**: A short publication consisting of English phrases alongside undeciphered symbols. An examination of the (hypothetically) Cetacean portions have suggested it to be an agglutantive, highly morphologically-rich language devoid of conventional grammatical structure. The English phrases are couched in unusually deferential language reminiscent of feudal Japanese (suggesting that human beings play a subservient role or hold a position of diminished authority).

> **Title**: //Grote Werken en Human Leugen// (trans: Great Work in Human Fiction)
> **Author**: //Gregori Beauchamp//
> **Language**: Dutch
> **Depth of Recovery**: 8,884 m
> **Description**: An encyclopedic analysis of what the author describes as 'the most important' works in fiction. Entries include: Winnie the Pooh, Beowulf, the lyrics of John Lennon, World War 1, Jimmy Carter, Atlantis, and the work of Isaac Newton. In addition, the author devotes a section of the book detailing certain revealed truths hidden behind these 'great fictions'. Such entries include: that Nazi Germany did not win WW2 as is commonly believed, that Polio is a disease and not an imbalance of humors as is currently thought, and that the Moon landing in 1969 was in fact a hoax fabricated on a sound-stage located on the surface of the Moon.

> **Depth of recovery**: 1,242m
> **Description**: The book begins with analysis and praise of the author's own poetry. The short literary critique ends abruptly after several pages and is followed by hundreds of seemingly random illustrations. They range from detailed sketches of indigenous artifacts to unintelligible graphs. At the conclusion of the book, there is a diagram labelled "Chinoodin Niboowin" ("Big Death Wind"). It depicts a series of dots that resemble the Orion constellation. The left-most star on Orion's belt is circled.

> **Depth of Recovery**: 16,357
> **Description**: A 1200-page 'sequel' to the 3-Volume Principia Mathematica written by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell published in the early 20th Century. The work is an attempt to extend the logical system of the original into a theory of "surrealist mathematics" wherein arithmetic can be applied to various heterogeneous objects (134 pages are devoted to the proposition that "a Yardstick in neither a yard long, nor is it -not- a yard long").


> **Title**: //A game-theoretic analysis of n-dimensional hyperchess and the effect of en-passant rules//

> **Description**: A generalized analysis of multidimensional chess, proving that Black has a winning strategy involving en passant when the number of dimensions n (n>1) is given by the formula [[$ n_x = \sum_{r=0}^{x} (r^2 - r + 1), \; x \in \mathbb{N} $]] (which includes the case where n=2, i.e. normal chess). The book does not go so far as to provide the winning strategy, instead only demonstrating that one must exist (i.e. a pure existence proof).
