**Special Containment Procedures:** As SCP-1986 is immovable, security must be maintained on site in order to prevent the public from becoming aware of its existence. Guards posing as library janitorial staff are to be used armed with non-lethal measures only.

**Description:** SCP-1986 is a circular tunnel 2.5m wide lined with volumes of books. The full extent of the tunnel is unknown, though Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (IfSAR) has set a minimum depth of 299,792km or 1 light-second (expeditions have confirmed a depth of at least 4,441km). The conjecture has been advanced that the tunnel may be infinite.

The volumes lining the tunnel often resemble known works, fictional or otherwise, though with substantial alterations as to style, character, plot and subject matter. Authors are occasionally authentic ones (though in every case the volumes in question fail to have ever been written), though often they are wholly unknown. The works range from being at the very least unusual to completely non-sensical. All languages currently extant as well as extinct ones are represented (see the section __Recovered Works__). In no case has any volume borne any publication information. Dating techniques have established that the volumes originate from the era they would otherwise appear to, based on semantic and linguistic analysis. The arrangement of the volumes follows no discernible pattern.[[footnote]]Before the librarian who discovered the artifact was administered an amnesic, he brought to the attention of Foundation personnel a story by the Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges's entitled "The Library of Babel". It is noteworthy that Borges worked at the same library. He was unavailable for interview as he died in 1987. The following is an excerpt from that story:

> "...These examples made it possible for a librarian of genius to discover the fundamental law of the Library. This thinker observed that all the books, no matter how diverse they might be, are made up of the same elements: the space, the period, the comma, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. He also alleged a fact which travelers have confirmed: In the vast Library there are no two identical books. From these two incontrovertible premises he deduced that the Library is total and that its shelves register all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd orthographical symbols (a number which, though extremely vast, is not infinite): Everything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels' autobiographies, the faithful catalogues of the Library, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of Basilides, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every book in all languages, the interpolations of every book in all books..."
[[/footnote]]

The walls of the tunnel are made of limestone. Attempts at breaching them have shown that the tunnel is non-Euclidean: excavating through the floor of the tunnel, for instance, results in a corresponding hole appearing in the ceiling. Attempts at reaching the tunnel at an angle have proven futile as the tunnel appears not to exist unless approached from its entrance. 
 

 

**Discovery Log:**
SCP-1986 was discovered in 1989 by a librarian in an unused basement of //La Biblioteca Nacional de la República Argentina// located in Beunos Aires. Foundation personnel administered class B amnesics to those who had been made aware of its existence and cordoned off the basement under the guise of performing emergency structural restoration.
