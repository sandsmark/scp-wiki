**Item #:** SCP-1986

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** As SCP-1986 is immovable and located in a heavily travelled public building, security must be maintained covertly in order to prevent the public from becoming aware of its existence. Guards posing as library staff are to be deployed. Only non-lethal measures have been sanctioned.

**Description:** SCP-1986 is a cylindrical tunnel ~2m wide lined with volumes of books. Although the full extent of the tunnel is unknown, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (IfSAR) has established a minimum depth of 274,700km or nearly 1 light-second (expeditions have confirmed a depth of at least 4,441km). The conjecture has been advanced that the tunnel may be __infinite__. [[footnote]]SCP-1986 original discovery was occasioned by a librarian trying to identify the source of a draught. Measurements indicate that the tunnel consumes roughly 400m^^3^^/h, i.e. a pressure differential of 25Pa (N/m^^2^^) and a draught velocity of 100cm/s. Where the air is being drawn to is unknown. _[[/footnote]]

The volumes lining the tunnel often resemble known works, though with substantial alterations as to style, character, plot and subject matter. Authors are occasionally authentic ones, though often they are wholly unknown. The works range from being somewhat unusual to completely non-sensical, though nominally at least intelligible (see the section **Recovered Works**). All languages currently extant as well as extinct ones are represented. In no case has any volume borne any publication information. Dating techniques have established that the volumes originate from the era they would otherwise appear to, based on semantic and linguistic analysis. No discernible __pattern__[[footnote]]One researcher has put forth the evocative comparison that searching the tunnel for a recognizable book is like traversing the real number line in search of a rational number. _ [[/footnote]] has been found to the arrangement of the volumes.

The walls of the tunnel are made of ordinary limestone. Attempts at breaching them have shown that the tunnel is non-Euclidean i.e. to excavate through the floor is to emerge from the ceiling (__topologically__,[[footnote]]The 3-torus is a three-dimensional compact manifold with no boundary. It can be obtained by gluing the three pairs of opposite faces of a cube. (After gluing the first pair of opposite faces the cube looks like a thick washer, after gluing the second pair — the flat faces of the washer — it looks like a hollow torus, the last gluing — the inner surface of the hollow torus to the outer surface — is physically impossible in three-dimensional space and can only be accomplished in at least four dimensions.) _ [[/footnote]] it can be likened to a 3-torus). Attempts at reaching the tunnel at an angle have proven futile as the tunnel is absent unless approached from its entrance.
 

 

**Discovery Log:**
SCP-1986 was discovered in 1989 by a __librarian__[[footnote]]Before the librarian who discovered the artifact was voluntarily administered an amnesic, he brought to the attention of Foundation personnel a story by the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges entitled "The Library of Babel". It is noteworthy that Borges worked at the same library. He was unable to be interviewed as he died in 1986. The following is an excerpt from that story:

> ...These examples made it possible for a librarian of genius to discover the fundamental law of the Library. This thinker observed that all the books, no matter how diverse they might be, are made up of the same elements: the space, the period, the comma, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. He also alleged a fact which travelers have confirmed: In the vast Library there are no two identical books. From these two incontrovertible premises he deduced that the Library is total and that its shelves register all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd orthographical symbols (a number which, though extremely vast, is not infinite): Everything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels' autobiographies, the faithful catalogues of the Library, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of Basilides, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every book in all languages, the interpolations of every book in all books..."

Foundation personnel administered class B amnesics to those who had been made aware of its existence and cordoned off the basement under the guise of performing emergency structural restoration.

> **Description**: A condensed novelization of another book that purports to contain the sum of human knowledge. The content appears to be a mixture of many languages including English, German, French, Farsi, and Sumerian, as well as others.

The narrative becomes more and more difficult to follow as it progresses.
