**Item #:** SCP-728

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-728 is to be kept within a class IV containment vault at Sector-██. To date the item has shown no activity to warrant anything other than standard security procedures to prevent unauthorised access.

**Description:** SCP-728 appears to be a standard shipping container, 12.19m by 2.44m by 2.90m. The exterior is painted red, and shows some signs of weathering. Markings and numbers on the exterior are consistent with the system used by [DATA REDACTED] however no such designation has ever been assigned to one of their containers.

The interior of SCP-728 is constructed from an unknown material, which has a gloss white finish and has proven to be completely impervious to damage. The interior space is 0.49m shorter than the outer measurements, but 0.78m wider and 0.34m higher. While the doors of SCP-728 are open, there is no observable effect beyond these impossible dimensions. While the outside of the container can be damaged, it has no effect on the dimensions or appearance of the interior (See addendum).

When the doors are closed, the interior space experiences the flow of time differently to the outside world. This difference is neither consistent nor predictable, with the flow of time capable of both speeding up and slowing down, and in some cases apparently reversing. All recording equipment which is sealed within SCP-728 ceases to function, including non-electrical devices such as hourglasses, making objective measurement of the flow of time within impossible. Despite this, it is clear that the effect is not merely a subjective one.

**Addendum:** //In my opinion, the interior of SCP-728 is not contained within the shipping container. Rather, the doors of the container act as a portal to the interior, which is located at another location. Seeing as my hypothesis can't tested without inflicting serious damage upon SCP-728, and I would rather not risk destroying such an intriguing object, I suppose we may never know.// - Dr. ██████

**Experimentation Log:** Experiments consisted of sealing a person/persons within SCP-728, measuring how much time passed in the outside world, and comparing this to the subject’s subjective experience.
