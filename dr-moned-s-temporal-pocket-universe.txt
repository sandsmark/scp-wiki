+ Me, Myself and I:
As an avid reader, I ran out of books one day and found SCP Canon tales! After reading tons of them, it got me inspired to create my own tales and contribute to this amazing story universe. I am a huge fan of tales and long SCP articles with narrative.

I also seem to have a neverending stream of ideas but not the big brains to pull them off, this creates a problem where I cannot write fast enough. I really ought to look at doing collabs with people, if anyone wants to collab I am probably down for it depending on what it is on. Although you may have to pull me away from my own GoI that should, by the time you read this, have a few more tales (The first one is my first jamcon tale down below).

I am almost always on IRC, they can't seem to get rid of me, feel free to give me a wave if you see me in there.

No idea how I managed to get an author page to be honest, but hurrah! Feast your eyes upon my blessed --cursed-- machinations.
