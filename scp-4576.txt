**Special Containment Procedures:**  Any seeds produced by SCP-4576 are to be preserved for future use within a hermetically sealed container. Live specimens of SCP-4576 are to be kept within a standard biological containment enclosure and closely monitored for any abnormal growth patterns.

**Description:** SCP-4576 is a subspecies of the //Papaver rhoeas//, or common poppy, flowering plant. When naturally grown, SCP-4576 exhibits no anomalous traits, apart from a significantly accelerated blooming duration. However, if fertilizer is applied to an instance of SCP-4576 at any point in its growth, it will develop to resemble the material and associated packaging or container from which it was fertilized.

**Addendum 4576.1 -- Discovery and Acquisition:** On 06/24/2017, a call made to the police department of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was intercepted by the Foundation. The caller relayed that she had heard screams emanating from an abandoned building across her street, along with witnessing numerous people exiting the premises in an apparent state of distress. As there had been multiple encounters with anartist activity within the region prior to the call, Foundation operatives initiated an investigation of the building and came across the remains of a recently held anartist exhibition.

Within the building, the following email logs were retrieved alongside SCP-4576.

Hello!

Cindy directed me to your email because she thought you'd be more experienced in handling this submission, so here I am. I'm interested in having one of my pieces, which you can find in the attached file, featured in the upcoming Philadelphia exhibition. In case you would like to see my other work, I've also included my portfolio. Thank you for your time and consideration!

Hello Lou,

I have taken a look at your submission, along with your other work. Already I can tell you've put some effort into this submission of yours, what with the detail you managed to put into recreating the clean shape and texture of plastic, especially with the limitation of organic material.

Unfortunately, as it stands, this work comes across as a little... gimmicky, in addition to being a little blunt in messaging. Because of that, I am currently holding off from giving you the go-ahead for the showing. However, I will not reject your submission outright, as I do think you could add a little something to your piece to make it work, so I'd be open to being persuaded otherwise. If you have any qualms with this assessment, please reply to this email with your response.

~ Sharon

Hi Sharon,

I'm very glad you took interest in my submission! While I'm not too sure about how I can deal with the "gimmicky" parts of my piece, I can definitely try to make the messaging a little more subtle. Right now, I'm thinking about possibly using more nondescript brands of fertilizer, or maybe more featureless fertilizer bags. That way, the piece might be a little less flashy, and maybe a little less blunt for you. Just throwing out some ideas, though!

In the meantime, I'll see if I can quicken the growing time of the plants a little to make sure I could get this in on time. Hope this convinced you!

All right, I think the changes you're planning to make with your piece alleviate a lot of my concerns. At this point, now that my worries have somewhat subsided, I'll be willing to give you a spot in the showing. And you know what, I'll do you a favor. I have a slight hunch this might be a breakout for you, so I'll tell you what: if this piece does well with the patrons, I just might slot your work in for a more permanent exhibition.

See you tomorrow,
Sharon

Thank you so much for the acceptance!!

Well, I'd obviously be glad to take up that offer of yours. Seems like a win-win to me! I'll also probably be able to drop off some seeds with some additional fertilizer by tomorrow so they can properly grow. Is there any designated spot I have to plant them, or can I just put 'em wherever I want? Just want to make sure...

Anyway, I have fiddled with the seeds a little, so they should be mostly grown by the time of the exhibition on Saturday. Very happy to get so much traffic on my work. Thank you for the opportunity!

For tomorrow, you can just drop off the materials for the piece before the exhibition, maybe with a brief sheet of instructions for how to set it up. That way, somebody else can get where the piece will be presented sorted out for you.

Anyway, glad to have you, and hope to see you Saturday.

Hi Sharon,

I just wanted to let you know that I'm very sorry I could not make it to the showing tonight. Started coughing a lot, decided I didn't want to go through the trouble of going to the exhibition. Working with fertilizer does that to you, huh?

I heard from a friend that it seems my piece is doing well, which is pretty awesome! Very unfortunate that I couldn't make it, though. Oh well, you can't have everything. If you can, please send the patrons my regards - so happy they liked it!

Yep, critical response is more than enthusiastic about your piece. The patrons seem to be really impressed with it, as far as I can tell, and are considering getting more of your work into future exhibitions. I didn't even tell them about the offer I made you, so that definitely says a lot about your art.

Anyway, I've got to tend to the showing. I will try to update you on anything new that comes up. Good job!

WHAT THE FUCK WHAT THE FUCK WHAT THE FUCK WHAT THE FUCK WHAT. THE. FUCK.

Okay, listen, there's no easy way to tell you this. Nobody here really knows what the hell happened, but something fucked up with your piece and now the whole goddamn exhibition is falling apart. Sorry you had to hear it first, but... you're disqualified. For the foreseeable future, you are barred from submitting any further works to any of our exhibitions. We don't tolerate these kinds of mistakes here.

Wait, what happened?

[[/div]]
[[/collapsible]]

In addition to these email files, a large growth of SCP-4576 specimens was recovered in the middle of the gallery. The mass, taking up most of the gallery at time of Foundation arrival, was composed of several putrefactive, desiccated bovine cadavers, overgrown with stacks of peat and strains of coconut fiber, and covered with a viscous, translucent slurry. Additionally, all other exhibits in the showing had been removed, and in an apparent attempt to incinerate the SCP-4576 specimens, multiple portions of the mass were heavily charred and scorched.

Since acquisition of SCP-4576, at least to the Foundation's knowledge, Mx. Abernathy (PoI-4576-1) has not demonstrated any further connections to the anartist movement.
