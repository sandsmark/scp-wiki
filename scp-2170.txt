**Item #:** SCP-2170

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**  Regular exposure to SCP-2170 is necessary for its continued existence and containment.

Site-2170 is publicly known as the Clown Motel, staffed by Foundation personnel for the purpose of memetic inoculation to prepare researchers and agents for SCP-2170 exposure. 

In order for the memetic inoculation to be effective all staff at Site-2170 must have a sincere appreciation of classical clown imagery and materials.  Agents or personnel who find clowns disturbing or not amusing must not be allowed to visit Site-2170.

Research personnel are to spend at least eight hours off-duty in Site-2170 before exposure to SCP-2170

**Description:** SCP-2170 are non-physical memetic entities which are experienced within the abandoned ██████ Mine in Tonopah, NV.  As memetic entities they exist within the senses of nearby sentient beings.  Exposed personnel describe them as whispering voices and fleeting images.

The entities themselves are non-malicious and only seek interaction for the purpose of self-preservation, but exposure is detrimental to the long term physical and mental health of those who perceive them unless, for undetermined reasons, subjects have recently enjoyed thoughts about clowns.  

There is no direct relation between clowns and SCP-2170 beyond this fact, and SCP-2170 expresses distaste for clown iconography.  

Symptoms of mild SCP-2170 exposure begin with an inability to accurately read written language due to auditory and visual hallucinations.  Continued exposure results in paranoia, increased hostility, self-harming and seizures.  

Sustained unprotected exposure to SCP-2170 leads to death in most cases except for individuals diagnosed with sociopathic tendencies.

SCP-2170 entities are dormant when not being perceived, and will cease to exist if not perceived on a regular basis.  SCP-2170 enjoys regular communication with trained Foundation staff.  Communication with SCP-2170 entities is best achieved indirectly via written messages.  Although SCP-2170 cannot physically alter written material, they can alter a reader's perception sufficiently to communicate.  This exposure is safe provided inoculation measures are carefully maintained.  

Most information regarding the history and nature of SCP-2170 has been given by the entities themselves.  Local historical records do not corroborate the testimony of SCP-2170 and despite the benign nature of the entities no information that they provide is to be taken as fact until physically verified off-site by unexposed personnel.

The following material are communications and claims by SCP-2170 entities that have been transcribed by on site staff, including annotations from independent research.  Please note that as SCP-2170 is memetic in nature even sanitized logs of communication with SCP-2170 can trigger symptoms of exposure.  If you experience any feelings of unease or confusion please stare at the following emergency image inoculation to counteract SCP-2170 exposure:
