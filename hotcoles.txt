+ [[[SCP-3407]]] - ¢10 Per Ticket

This was the second ever thing that I've submitted to the site, and I am honestly really proud of it. I couldn't have ever completed this one without getting plenty of support and encouragement from [[*user Uncle Nicolini]], who supported me all the way until it was posted.

The idea behind this was pretty simple at first, I just wanted to make a movie projector that would show creepy things. I was told that the concept was pretty good, but needed more to it. Making SCP-3407 was like putting pieces into a puzzle together; I slowly made a story that I was proud of.

I was actually a bit worried before posting that the article was bad, and I almost scrapped it entirely out of fear that it would fail. Gosh, am I glad I didn't do that. I remember trying to rework the concept into a guy who had a movie projector for a head, but I figured that what I had at the moment was good enough.

The rating isn't too great, but I'm still proud of myself for making this. I'm currently planning on rewriting this article, so the commentary here will probably change in the future.

I came up with the idea for this article by just eating grapes lol. I also was thinking about the old midwives tale of 'If you eat the seeds, it'll grow inside of you!' so I decided to write an article about that. Then this happened, a species of grapes that turns you into a grapes salesperson.

I also came up with my own minor GoI for this one called 'Dawn Farm and Ranch.' Their basic philosophy is to create healthy, lightly genetically modified anomalous food. It isn't just limited to fruits of veggies either, it can include meat, dairy, etc. I don't think that old Dawn will ever become an official Group of Interest, but one can dream, right?

I currently consider this to be the best article that I've ever written. This was a collaboration project between me and [[*user Uncle Nicolini]] and I couldn't have done it without him.

To put it simply, this is a story all about a sapient pink rose that just wants to make the world a better place, even if it deprives her of her own happiness. We were aiming to make this an emotional, bittersweet kind of article, and I definitely think it hits the mark.

We went through a ton of ideas for this piece, this really just started off as a garden that made you happy. One of the critics for the piece though that was kinda lame though, so I got inspiration for //'The Queen of Roses'// after looking at my rose bush while I was doing some yard work.

+ [[[SCP-4603]]] - The Ballad of Frank and Mia
[[/=]]

This was a bit of a palate cleanser for me. I was in a bit of a creativity rut for a short period of time during the inception of this article; I wanted to write a love-story sort of SCP for a while, and events that transpired in my life started to inspire to create the final product. I think that this article is likely the most creative I've been with the SCP format as of yet, as I added an audio file into the containment procedures that adds atmosphere to the piece while still holding relevance to the story.

The best way I can describe the article is the feeling of loss combined with the joy of music. I suppose the best way you can understand that phrase is by reading the article, as it's really one of the shortest, yet most quality things I've ever written.

Ah yes, [http://www.scp-wiki.net/wilson-s-wildlife-solutions-hub Wilson's Wildlife Solutions], such a charming Group of Interest. I remember first reading about WWS when I found an article called [http://www.scp-wiki.net/critter-profile-sampson Critter Profile: Sampson!] and having no clue what I was reading. Searched up the hub page, and I fell in love with the GoI on the spot.

Then this little guy came into fruition. I wanted to write a GoI format really badly, so I decided to use one of my favorite animals; a Kangaroo! I decided to name the fellow 'Ringo' after a cat that I used to have.

Of course, I figured that since this Kangaroo was crazy dangerous and could be used to destroy cities, I figured that the Chaos Insurgency would want to 'utilize' him so to speak. I thought that it would make for an empathic article that could definitely bum someone out.

[[tab Author's Will]]
Okay, serious talk for a second. This is a small list of things that are somewhat important in the event anything happens.

1. In the event I go inactive on the wiki for +3 years and there is no discernable method someone could communicate with me, I leave my articles in charge of the following users: [[*user Uncle Nicolini]], [[*user Alces_alces]], and [[*user DrAnnoyingDog]]. As for any collabs I have done, I leave the ownership of those works directly to the co-author. The only exception to this being the tale "Never, Ever Let It Cool", which I leave to [[*user DrCaroll]], since they were the creator of the original idea.

2. You are free to refer to any of my works in your own media so long as I receive credit. I would, however, be very appreciative if you contacted me and showed me the final product!

3. Rewrite: If any of my works hit below +10, you're free to contact me if you're interested in rewriting the article. I would like a copy of my work to be saved and sent to me after the rewrite it completed.

[[tab The 10 facts about coal]]
13. Coal is the world's most abundant fossil fuel - more plentiful than oil and natural gas. 
12. Canada exports about 28 million tons of coal each year to more than 20 countries. 
15. Coal generates approximately 40% of the world's electricity. 
31. Coal is the single largest commodity carried by Canadian railways. 
7. Coal is often used in fireplaces
8. Coal is seen as a black ore in Minecraft
9. My all-time favorite movie is La La Land, which was the original inspiration for SCP-4603 in its early stages. I really enjoy works of art that make me feel emotion. It might be part of why all of my works try to envoke some form of sadness or intrigue, but hey, what do I know.
4. If you want to read some of my failed articles as a lesson of what not to do, [http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/cole-s-scp-dumpster click here to see my dumpster]
1. And thank you, reader, for checking out my author page. It really, really makes me feel special to actually have one of these now.
