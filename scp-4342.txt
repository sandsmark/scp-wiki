**Item #:** SCP-4342

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4342 is to be contained in a secure storage locker located at --Site-22-- Site-44. Any individuals who wish to perform testing upon SCP-4342 are free to do so.

**Description:** SCP-4342 is a folded paper cube with a mild glow emanating from its interior. Incredibly, when exposed to external stimuli, SCP-4342 is capable of changing the colour of this glowing light as well as doing something on occasion. Due to the miraculous nature of these anomalous properties, SCP-4342 is currently under intensive testing.
