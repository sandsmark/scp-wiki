**Item #:** SCP-223

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-223 is kept in a locked containment vault in Site-19.  If the two (2) photos missing from SCP-223 are recovered, they should be stored in two separate, specially prepared vaults at Site-17.

Individuals affected by SCP-223 must have their romantic partners taken into Foundation custody and kept separate from them.  Under no circumstances should anyone in a romantic relationship be allowed to make any sort of contact with SCP-223.

**Description:**  SCP-223 is a photo album, capable of holding thirty (30) photos, bound like a small hardcover book.  The photos are attached to the pages with an unknown adhesive.  It matches the appearance of a product made by ██████████ but lacks any brand label.  “From danny with love” has been written on the back in blue ink.

SCP-223 contains twenty-eight (28) photos, which chronicle an engaged couple’s vacation to ██████ Beach.  The final two (2) pages of the album have been ripped out.

The couple in the photos has been positively identified as E███  ██████ and L███ ██████, who went on the vacation depicted June of 19██.  E███ and L███ died on June ██ in a murder-suicide by E███.  E███’s suicide note claimed he found his fiancée in bed with another man and killed her, however no evidence of such an affair was ever found.

There is one other person who frequently appears in the photos of SCP-223, a Caucasian male with attractive and somewhat androgynous features, designation SCP-223-1.  Based on his behaviour in the photos he seems to be a friend of the couple.  All attempts to determine the identity of SCP-223-1 have proven fruitless.

SCP-223-1 does not appear in photos and recorded footage of SCP-223, although careful comparative analysis of the photos and [DATA EXPUNGED].

Subjects not involved in a mutual romantic relationship are unaffected by SCP-223.  Subjects in such a relationship (including those with same-sex partners) will become obsessed with the album.  At first this is a mild and seemingly natural interest, but with continued exposure to SCP-223 subjects will begin to feel an overriding desire to find out who the people photographed in SCP-223 are, and particularly to find the two (2) missing photos.  At this point further exposure to SCP-223 is not needed to continue the process, although some subjects have been able to recover from beyond this point.

The subject who made contact with the book will next develop a firm, irrational belief that his or her significant other is cheating, and that the missing pages of SCP-223 will provide proof of this.  Subjects also will begin to converse with a non-existent person, whose physical description matches SCP-223-1, although the gender varies to match that of the delusional subject.  SCP-223-1 will speak to the subjects, collaborating their irrational beliefs and encouraging them to find the lost photos and repair the album.

At the same time, SCP-223-1 will also appear to the subject’s romantic partner regardless of whether the partner has any knowledge of or contact with SCP-223.  The subject’s partner will grow listless and depressed, and begin to believe that the original subject does not love them anymore, even if there has been no contact between the partners (if brought into direct contact they will argue and the process will radically accelerate.)  Once they begin to see SCP-223-1, the subject’s partners will also begin searching for SCP-223’s missing pages even if they previously were unaware of SCP-223’s existence.

SCP-223-1 will then seduce the original subject’s romantic partner.  If the partners are kept separate after this point, they can both still make a full recovery.  However, if at any point following the seduction event the partners come into direct contact, regardless of how many years have passed or how much they have recovered, the original subject will murder the partner and then commit suicide.  If the original subject is physically restrained the partner will commit suicide and the subject will follow suit as soon as possible.  If both are restrained, both partners will later commit suicide within one (1) minute of one another.

All persons killed as a result of SCP-223’s effect will appear somewhere in the photo album, usually as a member of a crowd in the background.  It is estimated that ██ new persons have been added since the album’s creation.

**Addendum:**  Further analysis of E███’s autopsy report indicates that several of the wounds found on his body could not have been self inflicted, therefore suicide has been ruled out as cause of death.  There is no evidence of anyone other than E███ entering or leaving the scene of the crime for at least twenty four (24) hours before and after his death, although [REDACTED] one of the walls.  Research on SCP-223-1 manifestations suspended until further notice.
