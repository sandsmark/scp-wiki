**Item #:** SCP-3443

**Object Class:** N/A

**Special Containment Procedures:** Owing to its complete non-existence, no containment procedures for SCP-3443 have ever existed. Protocol 00-Null Engram is in place to manage any hypothetical SCP-3443 instances. The existence of this protocol is in no way an assertion of the possible existence of any such phenomenon.

In accordance with Protocol 00-Null Engram, should evidence suggesting the existence of SCP-3443 ever be discovered it is of vital importance that it be ignored completely and no action or investigation taken in response. Even vague or circumstantial evidence is to be disregarded entirely regardless of source or type. This directive applies to all personnel regardless of rank, clearance, assignment, or any other considerations.

Any individuals, Foundation personnel or otherwise, who indicate any belief in SCP-3443 or demonstrate a clear propensity towards such belief, are to be immediately reported to Taskforce 03-Macaque. Taskforce 03-Macaque is trained to administer Frobisher-Gladstone personality restructuring (use of class D, E, and F Amnestics authorized as necessary) as a precautionary measure.

No research or investigation has been or is to be undertaken into any SCP-3443 candidate beyond those measures necessary for supporting the ability of the Foundation to comply with protocol 00-Null Engram, such as ensuring that integrity of this database entry and maintenance of Taskforce 03-Macaque. 

**Description:** SCP-3443 is a designation within the SCP Foundation database which serves as a placeholder for a class of hypothetical anomalous phenomena. The designation describes any memetic or cognitohazardous phenomenon or entity which in some way asserts an impossibility for knowledge about itself to either exist or be expressed. This could be by either direct interference with any knowledge relating to itself or prevention by some means of any communication regarding itself. It is the unequivocal position of the SCP Foundation that no phenomena of this type exist, however due to their nature confirmed total non-existence is insufficient reason not to deploy general safeguards against them.

Although multiple entirely mutually unrelated phenomena of this type could exist (rather than the none which do), only a single designation will be allocated. Given that no specific real instances could ever be described in any detail, no reason exists for reserving additional designations.

It is hypothesized that the existence of any knowledge of such a phenomenon, given that it would be a memetic cognitohazard of some kind, could have possible consequences including but not limited to:
* Inability of any person to acquire or to retain such knowledge
* Replacement of any expression of such knowledge with unrelated information
* Replacement of any expression of such knowledge with a direct denial of that knowledge
* Inability for any person holding such knowledge to continue to exist or have existed
* Inability for any form of information regarding any person holding such knowledge to be perceived
* Various AK-class end-of-the-world scenarios
* Various CK-class restructuring scenarios
 
The above examples are purely conjecture and serve only to illustrate the importance that containment of such a phenomenon might have if any existed.

The exact criteria to qualify as knowledge of any SCP-3443 candidate that would trigger these effects cannot be known exactly. It can only be inferred that non-specific suspicion, such as the mere suggestion that such phenomena might exist, is insufficient to initiate the effects of any extant SCP-3443. As no SCP-3443 instances exist, this inference is of little value.


**Addendum:**

> "Honestly what do we even have this entry for? It has never been Foundation policy to devote resources to managing problems which don't exist, we have more than enough trouble trying to keep up with things which can't exist but do...
> 
> Wow, it seems that even the person who put this here doesn't want to be associated with it. I think this might be the first entry in the database I've ever seen without any mention of previous researchers or even account names listed in the edit history. I guess it makes sense that no-one wants to admit to this garbage though. And what's this Taskforce it's talking about? I'm not sure it even exists, but if it does... are we seriously employing people for this crap?"

>  - Dr ████████

Dr ████████ has submitted a formal request that database entry for SCP-3443 be reviewed for deletion and expungement from all archives, along with review of any associated divisions or taskforces.

> "Staff are reminded that while requests to either modify Foundation archives outside normal editing channels or dissolve assets can be made, they are taken extremely seriously and only to be used where necessary. Wasting O5 time by ironically tricking the submission form into accepting an unsigned request to make a complaint about anonymous edits and wastage of Foundation resources is completely unacceptable conduct. This incident will be investigated. As SCP-3443 does not exist, however, the request for deletion will still be considered.
> 
> Entry for SCP-3443 will remain for the time being pending the outcome of that review, until then the 00-Null Engram protocol will remain in force. This will include the continued use of personality restructuring as prescribed. All staff are reminded that no instances of SCP-3443 exist and that all containment procedures are to be followed entirely."

> Ok guys, so whatever messed up the edit log seems to be wreaking havok with any links in or out of this article. 
> I've reported the issue to the I.T. guys, might take a couple weeks before they get to it though, so for now keep group notes on Audit Case #-3443-Felis-Defamiliaris here. We'll transfer them across when they get it fixed.
>  
> For now, preliminary work assignments are as follows:
> Procedural Compliance: Tania
> Precedent Review: Jacob (as usual, speak to me before requesting any 4/5 info)
> Containment Site Inspection: N/A
> Taskforce 03-Macaque Inspection: ███████
> File-To-Date Review: No-one for now, will put someone on it once IT is done

##E8E8E8|Ongoing corruption confirmed, remains highly unpredictable. Had assigned ████ to work on it and now ███ own profile is missing, I will be taking over personally now. Even the original service ticket is corrupted, can't even see who submitted the damn thing.##
##E8E8E8|In any case it looks like the Audit guys have the right idea, we'll keep notes within the article as well.##

##F4F4F4|Data corruption is getting pretty bad here, still not sure what's causing it. If I didn't have 15 years of dealing with lazy coding behind me I'd swear this is starting to feel like a scip at work. Hell we're weeks in and we still can't even find where the problem is, maybe I really have met real paracode at last instead of just hearing it as an excuse... anomalous computer virus with a sense of humor maybe? Oh who am I kidding, it's just an idiotic mistake someone made years ago. It's always an idiot.##

##F4F4F4|In any case this situation is getting to be a problem, the corruption is totally wiping linked accounts at random, I've lost touch with half my team now. I'm thinking we need to pull the article from the main archive and all active backups and just fix it up in quarantine. We'll work on fixing it there where it won't do any damage. We can copy it back afterwards if they decide they even want it.##

##F4F4F4|Request has been made to all 5 of the relevant O5 IT sub-committee requesting the change. O5-██ and O5-███ seem in favor, O5-██ and O5-12 haven't responded. We'll hear back soon I hope, until then carry on as before.##

> All work on SCP-3443 is suspended until further notice. Audit Case #-3443-Felis-Defamiliaris and DB_workID#-3443-04 are now closed. A detachment from Taskforce 03-Macaque will interview all remaining staff assigned to either case, please cooperate with them fully. No further investigations are to be conducted except if clear instructions are received from the O5 council.

##F8F8F8|Please disregard this. Accidentally created when revisiting DB_workID#-3443-04. Hadn't seen O5 directive, wish it had come sooner, I'm sick of this one... Still not sure what all the fuss is about anyway, whole damn scip isn't even real.##

##FFFFFF|**__WARNING: You are in breach of SCP-3443 containment protocols__**##
[[/size]]
##FFFFFF|Your account details and location have been logged in accordance with protocol 00-Null Engram. A retrieval team from Taskforce 03-Macaque has been dispatched to your location, please cooperate fully with them. We assure you that Frobisher-Gladstone personality restructuring is extremely safe, only in 2.3% of cases are amnestics of any kind required, and overall success rates are now above 99.8%.##

##FFFFFF|It will reassure you to know that no evidence of any SCP-3443-type phenomena has ever been observed. Although of course this can never be proved, the continued existence of you and many others before you while in a state of strong suspicion or belief in the existence of SCP-3443 strong enough to defy Foundation directives is a good sign. Use of the SCP-3443 entry has been granted to Taskforce 03-Macaque of the Foundation anti-memetic division by approval of the O5 council to assist with carrying out protocol 00-Null Engram. This protocol exists to improve overall procedural compliance and anti-memetic resistance across the Foundation. On the off chance any SCP-3443 does exist, it's probably helping us against that too.##

##FFFFFF|Please spend the next few minutes preparing a brief written summary of any critical duties that had been required of you over the coming days, restructuring may take up to 2 weeks to complete and this will ensure any impact from this disruption to your work is minimized. If it is impossible for any of your duties to be handled by another person you may discuss the issue with the Taskforce commander, however their directives must be followed.##

##FFFFFF|Lastly yes, this measure is being taken because you have failed to comply with direct instructions regarding handling evidence of SCP-3443-type phenomena, however we assure you that it is not a punishment. No mark will appear on any records apart from a classified 00-Null Engram completion report and you will remain a valued Foundation asset. Curiosity is a part of human nature and we do not expect you to have full control over it, that's our job.##
