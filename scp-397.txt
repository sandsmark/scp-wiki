**Item #:** SCP-397

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-397 is contained in a large, locked room on Site 20. The room should be stocked with vegetation native to forests in the African country of [DATA EXPUNGED] and the temperature set to accommodate SCP-397. SCP-397 is to never leave the room, unless under the supervision of at least two Class-D personnel and with the authorization of one Level 2 personnel. SCP-397 is to be provided with any  music and literature that she requests.  

**Description:**

SCP-397 is a female chimpanzee, standing at 1.27m (4ft,2in) in height and weighing 40.82kg (90lbs). SCP-397 exhibits sentience on the same level as human beings. She can read well, and she can write in a somewhat legible shorthand. She has learned to speak fluently in english, as well as the local dialect of [DATA EXPUNGED]. An aptitude test has revealed her IQ to be approximately 160. She shows, after a  time studying in the Foundation, an extensive knowledge on the topics of mountain warfare and classical music, her favorite composers apparently being Franz Liszt and Sergei Rachmaninoff.  

SCP-397 was brought to the attention of the Foundation after Dr. ██████ received reports from the small African village of [DATA EXPUNGED] that an unusual colony of chimpanzees were brutally hunting down the village's citizens. The chimpanzees were using intelligent tactics and human weaponry in their assaults. An investigation of the animals revealed a community of regular chimpanzees being lead by SCP-397. The structure of the chimpanzee colony was remarkably similar to the beginnings of a basic dictatorship.

After an unexpectedly difficult skirmish, that resulted in the loss of Agent R████, SCP-397 was apprehended and tranquilized. The remaining chimpanzees of [DATA EXPUNGED] were captured and terminated to ensure that the information taught to them by SCP-397 would not spread, and for the safety of humans living in the surrounding area. SCP-397 is continually violent to human beings, though she becomes civil if the situation suits her; specifically if she being taught something.

**Addendum** 
SCP-397 has been observed repeatedly attempting to copy human functions such as walking on two legs for long periods of time and table mannerisms; despite her deep distaste of human customs, which she admitted in the log between SCP-397 and Dr. ██████.

> Dr ██████: Could you describe, for the records, the colony of chimpanzees that you were discovered with in [DATA EXPUNGED]? 
> 
> SCP-397: Oh, them. What happened to them after you took me?
> 
> Dr ██████: ...that is beside the question.
> 
> SCP-397: //[The sound of chirping; speculated to be SCP-397 attempting to laugh.]// I see. I see. I suppose I would have done the same thing. I suppose I was doing the same thing.
> 
> Dr. ██████: Care to explain? 
> 
> SCP-397: You saw my society and so you destroyed it. Back in the forests of [DATA EXPUNGED], I saw your society, and so I was destroying your comrades, one by one. One by one. I hate your society still, doctor, but there is nothing I can do while I’m stuck in this... fake forest. Let me out, doctor. I have better things to be doing.
