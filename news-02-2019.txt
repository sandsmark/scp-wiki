* [http://www.scp-wiki.net/144-hour-jam-contest Jam Con!] - The 144 hour jam contest has been announced! This time, you have double the time to write! Be there or be square!
* We have officially hit 10,000 total articles on the site! If we assume an average word count of 1,000 words per page (which is probably a bit low), then site would be 10 million words 'long.' This is 2.8 times the the word count of the longest work of fiction (which is that one super smash bros fic). At the average reading spead (250 wpm), this would mean it would take 27.8 days straight to read the entire wiki. Here's to the next 10,000 pages.

You will notice little 'üìà' emojis besides some articles. That denotes SCP articles which were under 30 and tales which were under 20 when this edition of site news was posted. Give them a little love! Speaking from personal experience, the most frustrating thing that can happen to an article is not deletion, but stagnating below 20 without any comments. So try to read, vote, and comment on these articles! They're often hidden gems :)

+* Q&A:

++* Q: Can I replace a blurb that you wrote for one of my articles with my own? I'm not satisfied with it.

A: Absolutely. You will always have that option at any point.

++* Q: I noticed an error/typo/incorrect information and wish to correct it. May I?

A: Sure! If the changes are not limited to your own article(s) and/or are substantial changes across multiple entries, you should post in that month's discussion page and then make the changes.

++* Q: I wrote an article and it seems to have stuck. Can I send a blurb of mine to one of the frequent collaborators?

A: Yup! It's much easier if you come to us about it, and it gives you the control over what you want shown on the news page.
