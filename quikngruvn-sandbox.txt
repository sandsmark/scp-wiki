[[/div]]


**Item #:** SCP-829

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Any and all persons are to be considered armed and dangerous while under the effects of SCP-829. Unauthorized use of SCP-829 is grounds for immediate termination.

The bottle containing SCP-829 is to be kept in a locked, transparent Level-2 Security container of sufficient size, itself secured in [DATA EXPUNGED]. This room must be guarded by at least two (2) Level-2 Security personnel wearing Type-4 steel-reinforced full body armor and headgear, with standard armaments. The bottle itself needs only to be intact, large enough to contain SCP-829, and have a cap of sufficient size that will close securely. Two (2) spare bottles and caps are to be kept in SCP-829’s containment room. 

These guards and spare bottles and caps will accompany SCP-829 whenever it is removed from its containment room. SCP-829 may be transported in a Level-2 Security case filled with inorganic packing material (e.g. molded foam or polystyrene peanuts).

O5 authorization is required to access any video log of experiments involving SCP-829.

**Description:** Note: SCP-829 appears to be equally effective on both males and females. For clarity, this document will assume that the subject of SCP-829 is female.

SCP-829 appears to be a volume of nail polish in a color identical to [DATA EXPUNGED] (R187 G017 B026 color equivalent). SCP-829 is of variable volume, typically between three (3) and ten (10) cc in size. SCP-829 is composed primarily of [DATA EXPUNGED] brand nail polish, but also variable amounts of water, human blood (from multiple individuals), and [DATA EXPUNGED].

SCP-829 is able to generate more of itself by absorbing water vapor from surrounding air, and by “drinking” human blood (usually dripped into its bottle). If neither water vapor nor blood is available, SCP-829 becomes dormant, resembling a very hard disk of dried-out nail polish. This disk will automatically start absorbing water vapor whenever it becomes available, becoming fluid again within hours. To date, researchers do not know how SCP-829 can utilize so much water and still maintain its properties as a nail polish. 

When SCP-829 is applied to the fingernails of a human subject, the subject undergoes a progressive series of physical and mental effects. On the initial application of SCP-829, the subject will typically feel “sexier” and “more seductive”, exhibit more flirtatious behavior, and often attempt to seduce a person she finds attractive. In every known case, the subject will also prick herself and let her blood drip into the bottle containing SCP-829.

Once blood has been added to its bottle and SCP-829 has been reapplied, existing effects are amplified and new effects manifest. The subject will actively attempt to initiate a sexual relationship with another person, usually a stranger. The subject will use her fingernails prominently while flirting, dragging her nails lightly across her target’s skin. The sensation of the subject’s fingernails feels “tingly”, “extremely pleasant”, and “like nothing [ever] felt before”, and appears to facilitate the subject’s sexual advances. The subject will also continue to “feed” SCP-829 blood from small, self-inflicted wounds.

A subject who successfully initiates a sexual relationship with her target will, over a short time, attempt to introduce bondage and domination into the relationship. The subject is usually successful immediately or after a bit of persuasion with her fingernails. Targets that do not become willing either have their relationship ended by the subject, or, infrequently, [DATA EXPUNGED].

When SCP-829 has been fed enough blood and been reapplied, the subject becomes able to control the sharpness of her fingernails. The subject can make her nails sharp enough to shred standard fabrics, gouge wood, and easily slice through flesh. However, sharpened nails have so far exhibited little effect on metals or stones harder than bronze.

Once bondage and domination have been brought into her relationship with the target, the subject will assume the role of dominatrix. The target will usually willingly submit to the subject, in no small part due to the heightened tactile sensations of the subject’s fingernails on the target’s skin. The subject will also scratch the target with her nails, drawing blood in the process. The target appears to take pleasure in being scratched this way, or at worst simply ignore these wounds. The subject will collect some of the target’s blood in SCP-829’s bottle, and will often lick up and swallow the target’s blood herself.

This cycle of domination and bloodletting will continues for up to thirty-eight (38) days, at which time the subject will restrain the arms and legs of the target to a wall or table. This encounter will begin as normal, but the subject will cut deeper into the target with her nails over much more of the target’s body. Subjects have been known to cut and peel back large sections of the target’s skin; slice open the target’s torso and fondle the target’s internal organs; dig chunks out of the target’s flesh and swallow these chunks whole; if the target is male, cut off the subject’s penis and [DATA EXPUNGED].

For a considerable amount of time, the target will take pleasure in the progressive evisceration administered by the subject. However, at some point, the physical anguish of being slowly disemboweled will overcome the pleasurable sensations of the subject’s fingernails, and the target will realize just what the subject is doing. The subject will attempt to keep the target alive as long as possible, sometimes for several days, collecting much of the target’s blood in SCP-829’s bottle (often more than should fit), drinking some of the target’s blood herself, and, seemingly, making the target feel as much anguish as possible for as long as possible.

A few days after the target expires, the subject will reapply SCP-829 and start the cycle anew. However, since SCP-829 will have been “well-fed” recently, the tactile effects of the subject’s fingernails will already be quite strong, and the subject will more easily initiate new sexual relationships.

If SCP-829 is given sufficient blood from enough different targets, the subject will seduce a new target as normal, but will introduce the target to SCP-829 itself instead of following the standard pattern. The target will usually readily allow the subject to apply SCP-829 to the target’s fingernails, and will be affected by SCP-829 as well. The two (2) subjects will together continue the flirtation-to-evisceration cycle, seducing some targets individually and others together. 

If enough blood from new targets is given to SCP-829, then the subjects will attempt to recruit another target as a new subject for SCP-829. However, if SCP-829 is not fed enough blood, then one subject (usually the newest recruit) will become a standard target; the remaining subject(s) will then restrain and disembowel the former subject.

SCP-829 could theoretically maintain an unlimited number of subjects, given sufficient blood. However, since the amount of blood needed to maintain a given number of subjects follows a roughly geometric progression (outside of many other mitigating factors), the practical upper limit for the number of simultaneous subjects of SCP-829 is theorized to be between twelve (12) and twenty (20).

SCP-829 does not elicit these effects when applied to a subject’s toenails. The only apparent effect is that the subject insists on having her fingernails painted with SCP-829 as well.

**Addendum 1:**  

Foundation historians have recreated the history of SCP-829 using a variety of public, private, and classified records. For a complete record, see Document 829-H01, “History and Acquisition of SCP-829”. 

> **Abstract of Document 829-H01**
> 
> Lizzie Hawthorne was a suspected serial killer who had been connected to the disappearance of at least two dozen people in and around San Francisco, CA, between 1964 and 1972. Hawthorne’s modus operandi included seducing her target into a sexual relationship, introducing domination into the relationship (with herself as dominatrix), and, finally, slowly eviscerating her subject using custom-made gloves with razor-sharp “fingernails”. Police had finally caught up to Hawthorne in July 1972, but she had slashed herself to death before she could be taken into custody. Police reports noted that her blood was dripping into an open bottle of nail polish.
> 
> Since Hawthorne had no known next of kin, and her case had been closed for years, in September 1978, the state of California auctioned off many of the items collected from Hawthorne’s crime scenes, including the aforementioned bottle of nail polish. This bottle, along with several other artifacts, was bought by John Corbitt, a self-described “serial killer enthusiast”. Corbitt displayed these items in his home, but did not try to use them himself.
> 
> In 1983, Corbitt met Carrie Warwick, and after several months they became boyfriend and girlfriend. In early 1984, Warwick opened the nail polish bottle from the Hawthorne auction, and, surprised to find the contents still fluid, applied the nail polish to her fingernails. Warwick thus became Subject Zero of SCP-829 and started seducing other men, unbeknownst to Corbitt. Warwick soon introduced Corbitt to SCP-829, and the pair embarked on a cross-country killing spree. Corbitt and Warwick recruited at least two (2) new subjects for SCP-829, but could not give SCP-829 enough blood to keep them for more than a few weeks.
> 
> Police and the FBI trailed Corbitt and Warwick for several years, eventually catching up to them near Richmond, VA. Warwick was apprehended while disemboweling Corbitt and taken into custody. During interrogation, Warwick revealed the existence and effects of SCP-829. The Foundation soon became aware of Warwick’s statement and quickly seized Warwick and SCP-829.

**Addendum 2**

Due to recent incidents, experimentation of SCP-829 on animals requires Level 4 authorization. Experimentation on any member of the following taxonomic orders requires O5 authorization: Carnivora, Chiroptera, Crocodilia, Falconiformes, Piciformes, Primates (excepting humans), Proboscidea, Strigiformes, and Struthioniformes.
