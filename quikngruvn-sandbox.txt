**Item#:** SCP-241

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** [revised and expanded]

SCP-241 is to be kept using standard operating procedures for containing Safe-class book- and manuscript-type SCPs (see Document [DATA EXPUNGED]), with the following additional conditions: SCP-241 must be kept open on a flat surface, with restraints across opposing pages of the open book to keep it from closing accidentally. Containment devices must be checked at least once a week for structural integrity. Any anomalies must be reported immediately to [DATA EXPUNGED].

SCP-241 should be manipulated robotically whenever possible. In case this is not possible, personnel who must handle SCP-241 are required to wear Class 2 Hazmat suits. SCP-241 must be transported in an authorized bookstand such that it cannot accidentally be closed in transit. Anyone who touches or closes SCP-241 must immediately report to the nearest infirmary and [DATA EXPUNGED]. Anyone who opens SCP-241 must also [DATA EXPUNGED]. 

**Description:** [revised and expanded]

SCP-241 appears as a normal book, 33 cm x 23 cm x 3.5 cm, entitled __Good Home Cooking__. The cover of SCP-241 is a red and white checkerboard pattern, with the title in simple black letters on the front and spine. When open, SCP-241 contains 99 recipes, sorted into typical sections of a cookbook. Many of these recipes include a picture of the dish that is invariably appetizing, and a small percentage will call for rare or exotic ingredients.

Whenever SCP-241 is opened by a subject different from the one who last opened it, the recipes contained in the book change. Preliminary investigations concluded that if the last person to open SCP-241 eats a dish prepared from one of its recipes, that person soon dies from apparent anaphylactic shock. Others who eat the same dish are not similarly affected. Testing has been authorized to determine the exact nature of SCP-241’s effects.
 
**Acquisition Summary:** [totally revised]

The Foundation became aware of SCP-241 in April 19¦¦, while investigating reports of a “black widow” in ██████, ██, named ████████ █████████. Mrs. █████████ had been married four times, and all four of her husbands had died shortly after eating a meal at home. However, since authorities never found evidence of foul play, Mrs. █████████ was never charged with any crime. Subsequent interviews with Mrs. █████████ by Foundation personnel revealed the existence of SCP-241, at which time SCP-241 was seized by Foundation agents. Mrs. █████████ revealed that she had first realized there was something unusual with SCP-241 when [DATA EXPUNGED]. See document [DATA EXPUNGED] for transcripts of interviews with Mrs. █████████.

**Testing:** -- [expand into its own testing log]


--A cookie was made using a recipe from SCP-241 by a D class personnel and eaten. Subject suffered an anaphylactic reaction to the walnuts in the recipe and died shortly after.-- 

--A second D class test subject with a known allergy to peanuts was ordered to open SCP-241. 77 of the recipes contained a form of peanuts, while the other 22 recipes did not. When the subject was ordered to pick a recipe, he picked one that did not contain peanuts (cheese fondue). Upon tasting the fondue this subject experienced an anaphylactic reaction  as well.  Further testing revealed that certain oils 
cooked over a long period of time mixed with certain cheeses can make a polymer chain very similar to peanut oil.--  

--NOTE: Epinephrine had been administered to both subjects, but proved ineffective in halting the anaphylactic shock.--

--**Conclusions:** It is possible that new molecular processes can be discovered by examining some of the non-obvious allergenic recipes. In addition, some recipes might be usable as a non detectable form of assassination. Furthermore, some of the more dangerous humanoid SCP's might be able to be affected by the recipes. For these reasons, SCP-241 is not to be destroyed. Further experimentation on up to three Class D Personnel per month is authorized by O5-█.--


**11/13/20██**
Dr. Menendez of the medical team has asked for the use of the cookbook to diagnose any unknown allergies to all class 2 personnel and above. Permission granted (We want to make sure no one has any mishaps for Thanksgiving).

**12/17/20██** -- [revise w/ recipes w/ excess water]
It has been determined that SCP-241 may actually inflict additional allergies upon its subjects, in addition to diagnosing existing ones, and may, in fact, be sapient. Evidence for this is provided by the fact that Agent ████ ████████, upon opening SCP-241 as part of normal allergenic testing, discovered that the only recipes it contained for "A Glass of Water." Agent ████ ████████ has since 
developed [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquagenic_urticaria aquagenic urticaria]. Further testing is required.  As a result allergenic testing has been halted, suggest a reclassification to Euclid.

**2/3/20██** -- [replace w/ scorn from o5]
--SCP-241 is officially upgraded to Euclid.--

**7/8/20██** -- [remove]
--During regular testing of SCP 241 under more strict conditions there was an 
incident which proves the upgrade to Euclid status was warranted.  In one of the 
backgrounds of he photos, [[[SCP-118]]] became visible. Subject was affected as if 
he had seen the glass as half-empty.  Had this happened during the approved 
allergenic testing of important personel our mission could have been drastically 
hampered.--
