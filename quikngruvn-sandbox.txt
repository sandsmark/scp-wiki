**Item#:** SCP-241

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** [revised and expanded]

SCP-241 is to be kept using standard operating procedures for containing Safe-class book- and manuscript-type SCPs (see Document [DATA EXPUNGED]), with the following additional conditions: SCP-241 must be kept open on a flat surface, with restraints across opposing pages of the open book to keep it from closing accidentally. Containment devices must be checked at least once a week for structural integrity. Any anomalies must be reported immediately to [DATA EXPUNGED].

SCP-241 should be manipulated robotically whenever possible. In case this is not possible, personnel who must handle SCP-241 are required to wear Class 2 Hazmat suits. SCP-241 must be transported in an authorized bookstand such that it cannot accidentally be closed in transit. Anyone who touches or closes SCP-241 must immediately report to the nearest infirmary and [DATA EXPUNGED]. Anyone who opens SCP-241 must also [DATA EXPUNGED]. 

**Description:** [revised and expanded]

SCP-241 appears as a normal book, 33 cm x 23 cm x 3.5 cm, entitled __Good Home Cooking__. The cover of SCP-241 is a red and white checkerboard pattern, with the title in simple black letters on the front and spine. When open, SCP-241 contains 99 recipes, sorted into typical sections of a cookbook. Many of these recipes include a picture of the dish that is invariably appetizing, and a small percentage will call for rare or exotic ingredients.

Whenever SCP-241 is opened by a subject different from the one who last opened it, the recipes contained in the book change. Preliminary investigations concluded that if the last person to open SCP-241 eats a dish prepared from one of its recipes, that person soon dies from apparent anaphylactic shock. Others who eat the same dish are not similarly affected. Testing has been authorized to determine the exact nature of SCP-241’s effects.
 
**Acquisition Summary:** [totally revised]

The Foundation became aware of SCP-241 in April 19██, while investigating reports of a “black widow” in ██████, ██, named ████████ █████████. Mrs. █████████ had been married four times, and all four of her husbands had died shortly after eating a meal at home. However, since authorities never found evidence of foul play, Mrs. █████████ was never charged with any crime. Subsequent interviews with Mrs. █████████ by Foundation personnel revealed the existence of SCP-241, at which time SCP-241 was seized by Foundation agents. Mrs. █████████ revealed that she had first realized there was something unusual with SCP-241 when [DATA EXPUNGED]. See document [DATA EXPUNGED] for transcripts of interviews with Mrs. █████████.

**Testing:** -- [expand into its own testing log]

All tests were carried out in Test Kitchens at Site 19, using D-class personnel for test subjects, unless otherwise indicated.

__**Test 241-01**__

**Subject:** Subject 241-A was chosen from general population. No unusual traits selected for.

**Procedure:** Subject 241-A was presented SCP-241 while closed and instructed to open it, choose a recipe, prepare it, and eat it, while giving feedback during the entire process.

**Results:** Before exposure to SCP-241, subject declared that he had “never cooked anything more complicated than Ramen noodles.” Subject opened SCP-241, reporting nothing unusual. Subject looked through recipes in SCP-241, choosing Sautéed Scallops in a White Wine Sauce. Subject prepared the Sautéed Scallops from the recipe in SCP-241, and when complete, remarked that he did not know he could do that. Subject declared that the prepared dish smelled “fantastic”, and while eating it, declared, “This is the best thing I’ve ever eaten!”

Three minutes after completing the meal, subject started showing symptoms of anaphylactic shock. Subject was treated with emergency doses of epinephrine, but treatment was not effective. Subject died from anaphylactic shock six minutes afterward (later confirmed by autopsy). A subsequent examination of SCP-241 revealed that 81 of its recipes called for shellfish. SCP-241 was left open.

**Analysis:** Results are consistent with previous descriptions of the effects of SCP-241.

----

__**Test 241-02**__

**Subject:** Subject 241-B was chosen from general population. Subject reports no known allergies to scallops or other shellfish.

**Procedure:** SCP-241 was still open from Test 241-01. Subject 241-B was instructed to not close SCP-241, find the Sautéed Scallops recipe, prepare it, and eat it, while giving feedback during the entire process.

**Results:** Before exposure to SCP-241, subject expressed doubt that he’d be able to prepare the Sautéed Scallops recipe. After preparing the dish, subject expressed surprise that he had done so, similarly to the reaction of Subject 241-A, and said that the dish smells “pretty good”. While eating, subject declared that the dish was “pretty good” and again expressed surprise that he had cooked it. Subject did not suffer anaphylactic shock or any other adverse effect after completing the meal. Post-testing observation of subject revealed no long-term effects from eating the dish. SCP-241 was left open.

**Analysis:** Results are consistent with previous descriptions of the effects of SCP-241. Suspect that SCP-241 may somehow improve the cooking skill of whoever is preparing the dish.

----

__**Test 241-03**__

**Subject:** Subjects 241-C and 241-D were chosen from general population. Both subjects report no skill in cooking and no allergies to shellfish.

**Procedure:** SCP-241 was still open from Test 241-02. Subject 241-C was instructed to not close SCP-241, find the Sautéed Scallops recipe, and transcribe it to a standard sheet of paper. In a separate test kitchen, Subject 241-D was given the transcribed recipe and instructed to prepare and eat the dish prepared.

**Results:** Subject 241-C found and transcribed the recipe without incident. The transcribed recipe was visually compared to the recipe in SCP-241 and confirmed to be identical. SCP-241 was left open. Subject displayed no adverse effects from interaction with SCP-241.

Subject 241-D was given the transcribed recipe and attempted to prepare the Sautéed Scallops, but experienced difficulty and frustration, several times declaring, “I told you guys I can’t cook!” The completed dish did not look or smell nearly as good as in previous tests.

Subject balked at eating the dish, saying that “it smells like ████,” but was persuaded to eat it by [DATA EXPUNGED]. Subject ate approximately 40% of the meal before stating, “I’m gonna be sick,” at which time subject vomited. Subject was instructed to finish the meal, but subject responded [DATA EXPUNGED]. Termination of subject considered but rejected in favor of further testing.

**Analysis:** More evidence that SCP-241 can improve the cooking skill of its user. Subject 241-D retained for further testing.

----

__**Test 241-04**__

**Subject:** Subject 241-D.

**Procedure:** SCP-241 was still open from Test 241-03. Subject 241-D was instructed to not close SCP-241, find the Sautéed Scallops recipe, prepare it, and eat it, while giving feedback during the entire process.

**Results:** Subject vociferously protested to having to eat his own cooking, but was persuaded to cooperate with the promise that subject would not have to eat the resultant dish if it turned out like in the previous test. Subject expressed skepticism but proceeded to prepare the Sautéed Scallops recipe. While cooking the dish, subject experienced none of the difficulties he experienced from the previous test, instead expressing the now-familiar surprise that his cooking was turning out so well.

The completed dish looked and smelled similar to the results of Test 241-02. Subject was not nearly as reluctant to eat the prepared dish, declaring it “not bad… not bad at all.” Subject did not appear to suffer from any adverse effects after eating the dish. During post-testing interviews, subject was asked how he was able to prepare the Sautéed Scallops during this test when the results of the previous test were so unappetizing. Subject stated that he did not know, only that once he started cooking the dish, it became perfectly clear to him how to do it. Subject did not appear to have any additional knowledge of cooking, and even had trouble remembering the cooking techniques he used in this test.

**Analysis:** There is now little doubt that SCP-241 can turn people who know nothing about cooking into gourmet chefs, at least for the dish that’s being prepared.

----

--**Conclusions:** It is possible that new molecular processes can be discovered by examining some of the non-obvious allergenic recipes. In addition, some recipes might be usable as a non detectable form of assassination. Furthermore, some of the more dangerous humanoid SCP's might be able to be affected by the recipes. For these reasons, SCP-241 is not to be destroyed. Further experimentation on up to three Class D Personnel per month is authorized by O5-█.--


**11/13/20██**
Dr. Menendez of the medical team has asked for the use of the cookbook to diagnose any unknown allergies to all class 2 personnel and above. Permission granted (We want to make sure no one has any mishaps for Thanksgiving).

**12/17/20██** -- [revise w/ recipes w/ excess water]
It has been determined that SCP-241 may actually inflict additional allergies upon its subjects, in addition to diagnosing existing ones, and may, in fact, be sapient. Evidence for this is provided by the fact that Agent ████ ████████, upon opening SCP-241 as part of normal allergenic testing, discovered that the only recipes it contained for "A Glass of Water." Agent ████ ████████ has since 
developed [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquagenic_urticaria aquagenic urticaria]. Further testing is required.  As a result allergenic testing has been halted, suggest a reclassification to Euclid.

**2/3/20██** -- [replace w/ scorn from o5]
--SCP-241 is officially upgraded to Euclid.--

**7/8/20██** -- [remove]
--During regular testing of SCP 241 under more strict conditions there was an 
incident which proves the upgrade to Euclid status was warranted.  In one of the 
backgrounds of he photos, [[[SCP-118]]] became visible. Subject was affected as if 
he had seen the glass as half-empty.  Had this happened during the approved 
allergenic testing of important personel our mission could have been drastically 
hampered.--
