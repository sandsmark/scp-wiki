**Autopsy Report of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1026 SCP-1026]-B**

After the accidental neutralization of SCP-1026-B, its body lost its anomalous properties, appearing to be a normal human cadaver (identified as D-5582). Dr. ███████ requested permission to perform an autopsy on the entity. The following report is an audio log recorded during the autopsy.

> **[BEGIN LOG]**
> **Dr. ███████:** The date is ██/██/██. This is Dr. ███████, performing an autopsy on the body of SCP-1026-B, which was killed [DATA EXPUNGED]. I will begin by making an incision in the subject's abdomen.
> *15-second gap*
> **Dr. ███████:** I have just completed the first incision into the subject's abdomen. I can see no internal organs aside from a single large sac attached to the subject's vertebrae. I am attempting to open it...
> *9-second gap*
> **Dr. ███████:** The sac is full of... fog, for lack of a better word. It appears to be much denser than air, as it's not flowing upwards. I'm taking a sample of it for later analysis.
> *11-second gap*
> **Dr. ███████:** I am now attempting to open the subject's thoracic cavity.
> *34-second gap*
> **Dr. ███████:** Subject does not appear to possess a normal thoracic cage... Instead, there are two curved plates attached to the spinal column in its place. There appears to be a pair of organs beneath these. I will attempt to remove them.
> *69-second gap*
> **Dr. ███████:** The organs appear to be solid; I see no sign of any fluid or gas inside. I'm taking a sample for later analysis, and will then attempt to examine the skull.
> *173-second gap*
>**Dr. ███████:** The skull does not appear to conform to normal human morphology; the mandible appears to be fused to the temporal and maxilla, and the braincase is much smaller than normal. The brain itself has been replaced by a mass of "fog" similar to what I found in the abdominal cavity. I'm taking a sample fo- WHOA!
> *3-second gap*
> **Dr. ███████:** Sorry about that. When I attempted take a sample, the "fog" began glowing... I'm going to try again.
> *6-second gap*
> **Dr. ███████:** Just a minute... I've got a headache all of the sudden...
> *12-second gap*
> **Dr. ███████:** Jesus Christ, this hurts... What the-?
> **[END LOG]**

The log was ended due to an unexpected loss of power in the autopsy room. When a security team entered, they saw no sign that an autopsy had taken place. SCP-1026-B's body was intact, and Dr. ███████ claimed to have no memory of what had happened. A subsequent autopsy revealed that SCP-1026-B possessed normal human physiology and no anomalous properties whatsoever.
