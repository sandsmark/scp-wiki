My first published SCP. To be honest, I'm immensely proud with how it turned out, especially for my first article, and I was extremely happy when I saw how much it resonated with some people.

The inspiration for this article stemmed from a less-than-favorable trip to an old childhood park of mine. I was mostly expecting to be flooded with nostalgic warmth and happiness while traveling through it, but instead I accidentally uprooted a lot of bad memories (kids being shitty to me, other personal stuff). That was really the impetus for making this -- I wanted to tell a story which related to my own experiences during elementary school and spin it into a weird, shape-shifting anomaly.

The original drafts for this SCP actually included a subplot about a person of interest who made the park to perform a ritual in a nearby hotel to resurrect the memory of their dead friend and -- yeah, I ditched that. In those earlier drafts Poplar was less fleshed-out, and everything was in audio format, so you constantly had characters describing to other characters what happened to Poplar. That got real messy real quick, so I decided to keep it in video format.

One of the last structural changes I made to this was including the interview. Originally, I thought that ending the article at the exploration log would make the ending suspenseful. But then I found that it was way too open-ended of an... ending to be emotionally satisfying; hence, the interview. I'm actually the most proud of the interview, and I really think it helps give the piece some emotional depth.

My critters were incredibly helpful in bringing fruition to this article, so I'll list their lovely names here:

I'll admit it, my main motivation for making this SCP was to make a pun on my username. It was also my first attempt at a comedy-type article.

When I was first ideating about making this article, I originally wanted to make it about the owl and a junior researcher (her name was going to be Naomi Green or something like that) gradually coming to tolerate each other. As the owl gradually gave up the act of being William Shakespeare, the researcher would soon learn to have a warm spot for the fellow. I think the owl was supposed to attack one of the researchers by poking out their eye with their beak. Oh yeah, and the owl was supposed to //talk//. (shudder)

Anyway, after that, I started leaning into the group of interest storyline. Originally, the person chosen to become an owl was an unwilling participant, a businessman captured from off the streets, who gets more and more confused about his eventual fate of getting turned into an owl. However, in my drafts of this idea, I changed it into a more willing participant (a friend of the ritual setter), which made the storyline a lot less confusing and a lot more realistic (I mean, about as realistic as you could make a guy about to be transformed into an owl).

There are some parts which I do think could do with some cleaning up in the future, such as the incident log, but overall, I'm happy with the finished product. I do have to give due respect to the critters of this when it was still being drafted, who I will list here:

My first page submitted to the wiki. Actually, before making this, I wasn't too experienced with pixel art, and was way more comfortable with just regular drawing. However, after I tried out some stuff with the [[[https://lospec.com/palette-list|lospec palette list]]], I got a little more accustomed with using it to make art. A lot of the line art for the SCP drawings is a little rough, but other than that, I'm satisfied with how the art turned out.

This is, indeed, an author page.

[[tab Recommendations]]

++ SCP Authors

[[*user MaliceAforethought]]: If I had to say, probably my biggest inspiration as an author and one of my favorites. There's a certain kind of... logistical amusement I get from their work that you might get from an MC Escher print, tossing and turning around the ideas in my head. Most of this shines through in the excellent [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/domc-hub|Department of Miscommunications]]] series, and works such as [[[SCP-4517]]] and [[[SCP-4773]]] really demonstrate what I find so intriguing about their articles. 

**Recommended Articles:** [[[SCP-5790]]], [[[SCP-5856]]]

----

[[*user psul]]: The author of arguably some of the best uses of horror on the site. Something about their work just manages to get under my skin like nothing else, making you relate and sympathize with a certain character and pulling the rug out from under you. No better is this illustrated than in the wonderful tale [[[Until Death]]], one of my favorites in how it transforms the original [[[SCP-106]]] and mashes it with [[[SCP-3001]]] to make it delightfully terrifying. It's cool, check it out!

**Recommended Articles:** [[[SCP-2136]]], [[[SCP-3515]]]

----

[[*user The Great Hippo]]: Another great horror author. It feels like every one of their horror articles is a different flavor of scary -- be it monstery ([[[SCP-3035]]]), minimalist ([[[SCP-3561]]], [[[SCP-4087]]]), or just plain creepy ([[[SCP-2571]]], [[[SCP-2679]]]), Hippo's got you covered.

**Recommended Articles:** [[[SCP-3074]]], [[[SCP-4054]]]
