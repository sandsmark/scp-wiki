**Item #:** SCP-768

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-768 is to be stored without batteries in a reinforced, high-security locker with at least two (2) armed guards at all times. Access to SCP-768 requires approval from at least two (2) level-4 personnel, and Site ██ security must be notified of any experimentation to be performed on SCP-768.

Any experimentation using SCP-768 must be performed in a remote isolation chamber at least 300 meters away from any critical alarm systems. Researchers experimenting on SCP-768 must not bring any electronic devices with alert mechanisms or alarms into the testing area, and researchers with personal medical alarm systems must not experiment on SCP-768.

**Description:** SCP-768 is a Seiko-brand travel alarm clock that is physically identical to a regular unit of its model. Its anomalous properties manifest upon the triggering of the alarm.

SCP-768 produces no sound on it's own, but forcibly activates all alarm-systems within a 300 meter radius. How SCP-768 accomplishes this is not understood. Disassembly has revealed no anomalous properties in it's design.

Due to limited testing and potential usage, a fully comprehensive list of what systems SCP-768 is capable of remotely activating has not been developed. It has been recorded to actuate the following systems:

* Alarm clocks of any kind, whether analog or digital
* Phone alerts and ringing, both mobile and hard-line
* Car alarms
* Medical monitoring systems
* Fire and disaster alarms
* Computer hardware alerts, including beep codes and emergency shutdown actions
* Computer software alerts, including virus and critical update alarms
* SCP containment alarms (See Addendum 768-1)

SCP-768 will cause any automated responses to such alarms to trigger, but does not actually cause what might normally trigger these alarms to occur. Thus, a phone ringing due to SCP-768 may cause an answering machine to start, but once the line is picked up, it gives a dial tone as if no incoming call was placed.

SCP-768 came to the Foundation's attention after monitoring of municipal incident reports turned up a case in ███████ City, █████████ in which hundreds of fire and car alarms were set off simultaneously in a residential area. Investigation led to the discovery of SCP-768 in the possession of a Mr. ███████ ███████████. Subject claimed to have bought the clock from an online shop (████████████████████), which recommended the clock as being "fit to wake the dead". Subject passed a polygraph test, but agents failed to locate the shop in question, and Mr. ███████████ was released after being administered a class A amnesiac and given a replacement clock of similar make and model.

Research on SCP-768 to determine its method of operation and possible applications have been approved.

**Addendum 768-1:**

Initial experimentation conducted with SCP-768 caused the triggering of multiple containment breach alarms at Site ██, including that of Euclid-level SCP-███, SCP-███, and Keter-level SCP-███. Automated defense systems and self-destruct mechanisms were armed before the research team managed to alert site security and stop the response.

Due to the potential for triggering emergency responses, future research with SCP-768's effects must take place outside of the range of any alarm systems connected to critical systems or SCP containment alarms.

**Addendum 768-2:**

During experimentation on █████ ██, ████, Dr. █████████'s heart monitor was set to an alarm state by SCP-768, causing his pacemaker to increase his pulse rate to nearly three times his normal rate. Dr. █████████ was hospitalized but recovered fully after the incident. Future experimentation must be performed by research staff without pacemakers or personal medical alert systems.
