**Name:** Researcher ███████ Min

**Clearance:** Level 3

**Description:** --Researcher Min is a lazy little fucker who won't compile his own personnel file, and instead forces innocent co-workers like myself to do it for him. He is a complete and utter disgrace to the Foundation and can go die in a fire. A FIRE LACED WITH SADNESS AND BLEEDING INFANTS.--

--Sorry, I didn't know you meant //physical// description. Okay. Geez. Researcher Min is shorter than most doorways in Site-72, but can't fit through the service corridor without bending over. Or losing weight for that matter. He's also kinda Asian but he's never elaborated so I don't even give a fuck.--

**History:** --Dude, I wasn't even //here// when you joined. Ow. Fuck you. You know what? You can compile the rest of this shitty file yourself. Fine. Go on. Be like that, then.--

Researcher Min graduated from ███████ University with a degree in something important. Then a nice-looking guy in a suit asked him to join some aerodynamics firm and before he knew it he was slaving his ass off 50 hours a week in return for a salary that won't even cover the downpayment on his mansion. Seriously, boss? If you're reading this, try considering what they call a 'raise'. It helps a lot with the morale. Seriously.

God why am I even doing this shit

[[[SCP-632]]]

Headache spiders! Bog-standard Series I SCP, but I think it made the TvTropes page for "Nightmare Fuel" once, which I'm proud of.

Update: I found out recently that the article image is the only picture of its kind on the internet - god knows where I got it from years ago. Like, if you reverse image search it, all the results are SCP-632-related.

On that note, it's had a Youtube reading and a successful Plague Inc. mod (apparently the 2nd-most popular SCP mod, behind the clockwork virus). :D

However, I couldn't really bear to see it on the mainlist as it was, seeing as it was really just a very lethal spider... with creative reproductive methods, but all well within natural biology. It'd be quite hypocritical of me to leave it up there while also telling newbies in chat that their monster is completely within the bounds of Mother Nature and not that anomalous at all. It's been rewritten to be less generic parasite and more actual anomaly now; the original can be found in [*http://scpsandboxwiki.wikidot.com/min-min my old sandbox, at the bottom-most collapsible.] Unfortunately, I was careless enough to leave the comments unarchived, and they will be lost to time 5ever.

I thought of longsmile.wmv when I was walking home. Then one thing led to another. You see its smile, so you hear its eyes. Then you smell its ears. And then you taste its nose. And now it's got its nose. The object number, I feel, fits the entity rather well in a weirdly sensible way.

[[[SCP-2838]]]

This number was supposed to be 2211's, hence the containment locker in the previous article being labeled DAD-2838. The item itself came from a combination of "what if there were more stars in the sky, but only from where I stood?" and "tumblr star-kin ought to have their own scip". Eventually, it morphed into "hey, becoming a star isn't actually that great. It's hot and lonely and you can't move."

Vorcha, who has since galloped away into the sunset, challenged me and a few other people in chat to write an article with three tags that he chose, within 48 hours. I got 'equine, miniature, hostile', and banged this out in a day. There is no hidden meaning or plot twist here; it's just a weird thing. What's worth noting is that it's not only the first SCP to be tagged as a miniature equine.

I was finding unused tag combinations using Alexandra months ago, and discovered that the combination of the "avian" and "electronic" tags had never been used. Ireul gave me the birdphone idea in chat almost wholesale, and the rest was just dealing with the item mechanics and adding the addenda.

The description still has some gaps - where do the pelicans go? Why doesn't the incoming call come as a bird? The answers are simple: 1) all pelicans produced by SCP-2232 do not disappear. They are currently contained in the Site-77 aviary, and it's gotten very crowded. 2) the only reason the SCP turns into a bird to send signals in our universe is because in our world, the electromagnetic spectrum isn't birds.

Fun fact: Wingtel is a pun on a local telco, Singtel.

I'd always had a soft spot for urban legends like the Belmez house, on which this SCP was based, and dementia is one of my worst fears. This was originally an attempt to write a story-centric piece without the "convenient end note/interview" device, but it didn't seem to do very well and I added the last addendum on a whim to try and rescue the article.

Decibelle was passing around new rewrite opportunities and I took this one because I like cats.

Nothing much to say for this one. This definitely calls for a spin-off tale some day about a man and his ghost cat livin' it out on the streets, trying to start anew.

[[[SCP-2696]]]

This was originally a bit more bloated than it is now, with tedious architectural descriptions, a bit more technobabble than necessary, etc. The effect was never intended to be complete comprehension, more like a series of jargon that, when glossed over, should have given an overall gist of a catastrophe waiting to happen; words like unstable equilibrium, decaying, and ego death.

And when it isn't self-indulgent technobabble, it's classic Gothic tropes of madness and bad magic and dead families in dead houses... oh my. It was so much fun. Main references while writing this were Henry James' //Turn of the Screw// (for which poor little Miles Rosyth was named) and Shirley Jackson's //The Haunting of Hill House//, with a splash of //The Fall of The House of Usher// (from whose author I borrow the name of Miles' equally unfortunate twin). 

The overall tone is one that crops up a bunch of times in other articles, about supernatural forces kept barely at bay even with humanity's best at hand, a tone of desperation, where human ingenuity and sheer grit can barely hold onto the weight of the world... It's a tragic nobility I've always had a thing for, and I've tried to express it here for what it's worth.

The concept and general tone was inspired half by J. L. Borges and half by GEB: The Eternal Golden Braid, which I happened to be reading while writing this. The parallel was realised when I was half through reading GEB and half through drafting this out - the basic idea that symbol-systems contain the seed of their own deconstruction. The idea kind of hung in the air until I bashed it out with lots of help from Randomini, then it just started writing itself. At first, it was very much more technical and full of fake techno-speak; each subsequent critic I ran this by led to the cutting of ~100-200 words each time, paring it down to its current state (which, let's face it, is still pretty wanky).

Fun fact #1: prior to posting this, I had not known that Satoshi Kon actually did write a manga about a struggling manga artist confronting a blurring of fiction and reality's boundaries, with [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_(manga) a self-referential title].

Fun fact #2: I had never listened to Radiohead beyond Paranoid Android before writing this article. Now that I'm kind of into them, I'm amused as to how closely my fake album review seems to describe a sizeable portion of their songs.

Fun fact #3: The novel about the Dutch mystic is inspired by descriptions of Henry Darger's //The Story of the Vivian Girls, in What Is Known as the Realms of the Unreal, of the Glandeco-Angelinnian War Storm, Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion//, and the plot of //Somnium// by Johannes Kepler (yes, that Kepler); meanwhile, //ex lux// heavily draws from the Wikipedia article on //The Sargasso Manuscript// and //One Thousand and One Nights//.

First piece in which I really felt I did extensive research for, with massive encourage from vezaz. Finding historical events to rope into a long chain of secret shadow-organisation Cold War conspiracy is the closest I've felt to a History Channel expert. Huge fun to plan, draft, and write. Every reference to the Bane Plane Crash Scene is entirely intentional.

Rushed this in a blur, might come back to it someday, but not now. I don't remember much of it other than it draws from a lot of tropes and implies many things behind the curtain in many fancy words, but I don't think I actually had any explanation or resolution in mind (which I think is indicated by the middling response during the 3k contest).

[[[SCP-3099]]]

Standard horror monster that started from an idea and a hasty Photoshop - entity that lives in a porn film. "Public domain porn" remains my weirdest google search term to date. Victims of the monster were always planned to be male; the reasons thereof will be left to readers' speculation.

Ideas and content mostly by [[*user LilyFlower]], who as of the time of writing this is the love of my life. It's JFC, it's weird. That's all. Also, the townsfolk really did see Jesus in the clouds; the implication being that everything else that follows is natural mass hysteria.

A large portion had been written and removed detailing the dialogue between Agents Charlotte Lewis and Dale Tucker, and their handler referred to by Charlotte as "Bob", which is nowhere close to his real or actual name. Charlotte is irreverent and snarky throughout, while Dale is chipper, astutely deductive, and has jokes made about him regarding coffee. No guesses to which series I watched last before writing this.
