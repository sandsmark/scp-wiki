**Name:** Researcher ███████ Min

**Clearance:** Level 3

**Description:** --Researcher Min is a lazy little fucker who won't compile his own personnel file, and instead forces innocent co-workers like myself to do it for him. He is a complete and utter disgrace to the Foundation and can go die in a fire. A FIRE LACED WITH SADNESS AND BLEEDING INFANTS.--

--Sorry, I didn't know you meant //physical// description. Okay. Geez. Researcher Min is shorter than most doorways in Site-72, but can't fit through the service corridor without bending over. Or losing weight for that matter. He's also kinda Asian but he's never elaborated so I don't even give a fuck.--

**History:** --Dude, I wasn't even //here// when you joined. Ow. Fuck you. You know what? You can compile the rest of this shitty file yourself. Fine. Go on. Be like that, then.--

Researcher Min graduated from ███████ University with a degree in something important. Then a nice-looking guy in a suit asked him to join some aerodynamics firm and before he knew it he was slaving his ass off 50 hours a week in return for a salary that won't even cover the downpayment on his mansion. Seriously, boss? If you're reading this, try considering what they call a 'raise'. It helps a lot with the morale. Seriously.

God why am I even doing this shit

[[[SCP-632]]] - A Bad Headache/Intrusive Arachnid Thoughts (rewrite)

Headache spiders! Bog-standard Series I SCP, but I think it made the TvTropes page for "Nightmare Fuel" once, which I'm proud of.

Update: I found out recently that the article image is the only picture of its kind on the internet - god knows where I got it from years ago. Like, if you reverse image search it, all the results are SCP-632-related.

On that note, it's had a Youtube reading and a successful Plague Inc. mod (apparently the 2nd-most popular SCP mod, behind the clockwork virus). :D

However, I couldn't really bear to see it on the mainlist as it was, seeing as it was really just a very lethal spider... with creative reproductive methods, but all well within natural biology. It'd be quite hypocritical of me to leave it up there while also telling newbies in chat that their monster is completely within the bounds of Mother Nature and not that anomalous at all. It's been rewritten to be less generic parasite and more actual anomaly now; the original can be found in [*http://scpsandboxwiki.wikidot.com/min-min my old sandbox, at the bottom-most collapsible.] Unfortunately, I was careless enough to leave the comments unarchived, and they will be lost to time 5ever.

[[[SCP-2211]]] - A .wmv, a .wav, an .exe, and a Coffee Machine

I thought of longsmile.wmv when I was walking home. Then one thing led to another. You see its smile, so you hear its eyes. Then you smell its ears. And then you taste its nose. And now it's got its nose. The object number, I feel, fits the entity rather well in a weirdly sensible way.

[[collapsible show="SCP-2838"]]

[[[SCP-2838]]] - Stellar Reincarnation Column

This number was supposed to be 2211's, hence the containment locker in the previous article being labeled DAD-2838. The item itself came from a combination of "what if there were more stars in the sky, but only from where I stood?" and "tumblr star-kin ought to have their own scip". Eventually, it morphed into "hey, becoming a star isn't actually that great. It's hot and lonely and you can't move."

[[[SCP-2965]]] - A Pony Express

Vorcha, who has since galloped away into the sunset, challenged me and a few other people in chat to write an article with three tags that he chose, within 48 hours. I got 'equine, miniature, hostile', and banged this out in a day. There is no hidden meaning or plot twist here; it's just a weird thing. What's worth noting is that it's not only the first SCP to be tagged as a miniature equine.

[[collapsible show="SCP-2232"]]

[[[SCP-2232]]] - Birdphone. Think Different.

I was finding unused tag combinations using Alexandra months ago, and discovered that the combination of the "avian" and "electronic" tags had never been used. Ireul gave me the birdphone idea in chat almost wholesale, and the rest was just dealing with the item mechanics and adding the addenda.

The description still has some gaps - where do the pelicans go? Why doesn't the incoming call come as a bird? The answers are simple: 1) all pelicans produced by SCP-2232 do not disappear. They are currently contained in the Site-77 aviary, and it's gotten very crowded. 2) the only reason the SCP turns into a bird to send signals in our universe is because in our world, the electromagnetic spectrum isn't birds.

Fun fact: Wingtel is a pun on a local telco, Singtel.

[[collapsible show="SCP-2898"]]

[[[SCP-2898]]] - A Persistence of Memory

I'd always had a soft spot for urban legends like the Belmez house, on which this SCP was based, and dementia is one of my worst fears. This was originally an attempt to write a story-centric piece without the "convenient end note/interview" device, but it didn't seem to do very well and I added the last addendum on a whim to try and rescue the article.

[[collapsible show="SCP-796"]]

[[[SCP-796]]] - River Cat (rewrite)

Decibelle was passing around new rewrite opportunities and I took this one because I like cats.

Nothing much to say for this one. This definitely calls for a spin-off tale some day about a man and his ghost cat livin' it out on the streets, trying to start anew. 

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="SCP-2696"]]

[[[SCP-2696]]] - The Haunted Victorian Mansion of Dark Peak

This was originally a bit more bloated than it is now, with tedious architectural descriptions, a bit more technobabble than necessary, etc. The effect was never intended to be complete comprehension, more like a series of jargon that, when glossed over, should have given an overall gist of a catastrophe waiting to happen; words like unstable equilibrium, decaying, and ego death.

And when it isn't self-indulgent technobabble, it's classic Gothic tropes of madness and bad magic and dead families in dead houses... oh my. It was so much fun. Main references while writing this were Henry James' //Turn of the Screw// (for which poor little Miles Rosyth was named) and Shirley Jackson's //The Haunting of Hill House//, with a splash of //The Fall of The House of Usher// (from whose author I borrow the name of Miles' equally unfortunate twin). 

The overall tone is one that crops up a bunch of times in other articles, about supernatural forces kept barely at bay even with humanity's best at hand, a tone of desperation, where human ingenuity and sheer grit can barely hold onto the weight of the world... It's a tragic nobility I've always had a thing for, and I've tried to express it here for what it's worth.

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="SCP-2747"]]

[[[SCP-2747]]]- As below, so above

The concept and general tone was inspired half by J. L. Borges and half by GEB: The Eternal Golden Braid, which I happened to be reading while writing this. The parallel was realised when I was half through reading GEB and half through drafting this out - the basic idea that symbol-systems contain the seed of their own deconstruction. The idea kind of hung in the air until I bashed it out with lots of help from Randomini, then it just started writing itself. At first, it was very much more technical and full of fake techno-speak; each subsequent critic I ran this by led to the cutting of ~100-200 words each time, paring it down to its current state (which, let's face it, is still pretty wanky).

Fun fact #1: prior to posting this, I had not known that Satoshi Kon actually did write a manga about a struggling manga artist confronting a blurring of fiction and reality's boundaries, with [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_(manga) a self-referential title].

Fun fact #2: I had never listened to Radiohead beyond Paranoid Android before writing this article. Now that I'm kind of into them, I'm amused as to how closely my fake album review seems to describe a sizeable portion of their songs.

Fun fact #3: The novel about the Dutch mystic is inspired by descriptions of Henry Darger's //The Story of the Vivian Girls, in What Is Known as the Realms of the Unreal, of the Glandeco-Angelinnian War Storm, Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion//, and the plot of //Somnium// by Johannes Kepler (yes, that Kepler); meanwhile, //ex lux// heavily draws from the Wikipedia articles on //The Sargasso Manuscript// and //One Thousand and One Nights//.

[[collapsible show="SCP-2979"]]

[[[SCP-2979]]] - Observable Televised Feline Migration

This is me realising that it's cool to write SCPs that aren't localised objects, instead being rituals or phenomena only inches away from our everyday lives. It's an attempt to capture one of the original flavours of SCP that grabbed me as a younger teen: the idea that anything you do can be dangerous and anomalous, be it the pen you just picked up or the crack you just stepped on. 

The Borges vibe is still strong with this one (from one of his early bestiary entries on the fish trapped behind the mirror, I think).

[[collapsible show="SCP-2535"]]

[[[SCP-2535]]] - Printers that eat, eaters that print

I've grown up with a lot of printers in my life, and I find the sounds they make oddly calming. So it's especially squicky for me that they're paired with human screams in this article. Also probably inspired by intrusive childhood thoughts of sticking my hand in the printer to flatten it out into a colourful ribbon. Actualising these thoughts in humorously dry Foundationspeak was easily one of the most fun I've had in writing an article.

I can't remember who suggested the title to link back to [[[SCP-2030]]] (Laugh is FUn). That was an entirely accidental connection I didn't make until I had the part about people stuck into printers written out. What was deliberate, however, is the Hewlett-Packard link to 2211. An earlier version had one manager escape 2535's devastation only to flee to Shanghai, where fate caught up with her and she was conceptually splayed into electronic appliances. This has been excised in the final version due to brevity.

[[collapsible show="SCP-2498"]]

[[[SCP-2498]]] - The Rainbow Body

First piece in which I really felt I did extensive research for, with massive encourage from vezaz. Finding historical events to rope into a long chain of secret shadow-organisation Cold War conspiracy is the closest I've felt to a History Channel expert. Huge fun to plan, draft, and write. Every reference to the Bane Plane Crash Scene is entirely intentional.

[[collapsible show="SCP-3100"]]

[[[SCP-3100]]] - The Reliquary

For the SCP-3000 contest. Rushed this in a blur, might come back to it someday, but not now. I don't remember much of it other than it draws from a lot of tropes and implies many things behind the curtain in many fancy words, but I don't think I actually had any explanation or resolution in mind (which I think is indicated by the middling response during the 3k contest).

[[collapsible show="SCP-3099"]]

[[[SCP-3099]]] - High Impact Sexual Violence

Standard horror monster that started from an idea and a hasty Photoshop - entity that lives in a porn film. "Public domain porn" remains my weirdest google search term to date. Victims of the monster were always planned to be male; the reasons thereof will be left to readers' speculation.

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="SCP-3250"]]

[[[SCP-3250]]] - Jesus Fried Chicken

Ideas and content mostly by [[*user LilyFlower]], who as of the time of writing this is the love of my life. It's JFC, it's weird. That's all. Also, the townsfolk really did see Jesus in the clouds; the implication being that everything else that follows is natural mass hysteria.

A large portion had been written and removed detailing the dialogue between Agents Charlotte Lewis and Dale Tucker, and their handler referred to by Charlotte as "Bob", which is nowhere close to his real or actual name. Charlotte is irreverent and snarky throughout, while Dale is chipper, astutely deductive, and has jokes made about him regarding coffee. No guesses to which series I watched last before writing this.

[[collapsible show="SCP-3366"]]

[[[SCP-3366]]] - Man in Hole

Hi, this was another try at playing with the storyverse within the SCPverse, heavily inspired by sections of the //1001 Nights// I studied in my freshman literature class (in particular, the three dervishes' tales in the Tale of the Porter and the final nested story in the Tale of the Fisherman). The former is not so obvious a reference as the latter, I think, but I've tried to adhere to its flavour with the coincidentally similar injuries, coincidentally similar circumstances of disappearing (in subterranean chambers!), and quasi-mystical rambling. The implication here (that I hope is juuust obvious enough to be ominous) is that the corpse-sorceror's escaped the story into the real world, hence the blank pages and the similar circumstances + injuries to the men. I didn't think I could pull off making an actual lich scary within the SCP format, so I left it at that; there's definitely a sequel hook with the good guys battling an undead bone-conjurer in war-torn Iraq, though!

[[collapsible show="SCP-3414"]]

[[[SCP-3414]]] - Toilet Snake

This is an old draft I've had in some form or another since I joined the site -- I know I've tried to float a person-sucking toilet portal in chat back in 2012 or so (and was suitably lambasted for it), while the toilet-being-a-snake deal was written up probably in mid-2016 or so. You don't need a story to make an SCP article cool, you just need to tell shit at the right pace.

The setting was chosen on a whim, considering I'd just taken a class on urban planning in the global South. That said, it might be interesting to explore further the logistics of a Foundation operation in developing country cities: how would they drain the hazardous chemicals? Where would running water even come from? How would they even begin establishing a presence here? Or maybe they'd just upgrade the whole slum for the sake of containing one anomaly. Who knows?

[[collapsible show="SCP-3904"]]

[[[SCP-3904]]] - Two Cats in a Skin Suit

I'm just clearing out old drafts at this point. "Two cats in a skin suit" is a phrase that's been kicking around in my head for years, and I decided to write it up in mid-2017 or so just for the heck of it. In its original form, I was scared of posting because I didn't have an origin story in mind, but it turns out you don't really need them to be special nowadays. Finding and photoshopping an image was the harder part, and more rewarding for the article's substance IMO.

It greatly tickles me that 70% of cats in the SCPverse (and perhaps real life? one never knows!) prefer hollowed-out corpses to cardboard boxes and baskets.
