**Name:** Researcher ███████ Min

**Clearance:** Level 3

**Description:** --Researcher Min is a lazy little fucker who won't compile his own personnel file, and instead forces innocent co-workers like myself to do it for him. He is a complete and utter disgrace to the Foundation and can go die in a fire. A FIRE LACED WITH SADNESS AND BLEEDING INFANTS.--

--Sorry, I didn't know you meant //physical// description. Okay. Geez. Researcher Min is shorter than most doorways in Site-72, but can't fit through the service corridor without bending over. Or losing weight for that matter. He's also kinda Asian but he's never elaborated so I don't even give a fuck.--

**History:** --Dude, I wasn't even //here// when you joined. Ow. Fuck you. You know what? You can compile the rest of this shitty file yourself. Fine. Go on. Be like that, then.--

Researcher Min graduated from ███████ University with a degree in something important. Then a nice-looking guy in a suit asked him to join some aerodynamics firm and before he knew it he was slaving his ass off 50 hours a week in return for a salary that won't even cover the downpayment on his mansion. Seriously, boss? If you're reading this, try considering what they call a 'raise'. It helps a lot with the morale. Seriously.

God why am I even doing this shit

Things I've wrote!

* [[[SCP-632]]]: Headache spiders! Bog-standard Series I SCP, but I think it made the TvTropes page for "Nightmare Fuel" once, which I'm proud of.
* [[[SCP-932]]]: Invisible dwarfs which use sleep paralysis as a feeding method. 
* [[[SCP-1373]]]: Laser sharks. Highly divisive. Reached +50/-50. Saved by Voct, God bless his soul.
* [[[SCP-2211]]]: I thought of longsmile.wmv when I was walking home. Then one thing led to another. You see its smile, so you hear its eyes. Then you smell its ears. And then you taste its nose. And now it's got its nose. The object number, I feel, fits the entity rather well in a weirdly sensible way.
* [[[SCP-2838]]]: This number was supposed to be 2211's, hence the containment locker in the previous article being labeled DAD-2838. The item itself came from a combination of "what if there were more stars in the sky, but only from where I stood?" and "tumblr star-kin ought to have their own scip". Eventually, it morphed into "hey, becoming a star isn't actually that great. It's hot and lonely and you can't move." 
* [[[SCP-2965]]]: Vorcha, who has since galloped away into the sunset, challenged me and a few other people in chat to write an article with three tags that he chose, within 48 hours. I got 'equine, miniature, hostile', and banged this out in a day. There is no hidden meaning or plot twist here. It's just a weird thing. What's worth noting is that it's not only the first SCP to be tagged as a miniature equine, but it's also the first SCP set in my country, written over the National Day weekend.
* [[[SCP-2232]]]: I'll write something for this if it succeeds.

Tales

* [[[the-woven-man |Woven Man: A fairytale]]]. I secretly want to develop a canon, or at least a chain of tales and SCPs, that tie together a weird Germanic fairytale anomaly-verse.
* [[[the-other-side |The Other Side]]]. Uhhhhh. 
* [[[Love Springs Eternal |Love Springs Eternal: Definitely not a fairytale]]]. Uhhhhhhhhh.
* [[[hint-the-thing-is-173 |A Tale Of Five Offerings: a cautionary poem on why you should not give gifts to stone abominations]]]. Apparently I write good things when I don't think too hard about them.
* [[[clouds |Clouds: Why I Really Shouldn't Have Brought A Lovecraft Book Onto An Airplane]]]. Might or might not be just another atmospheric jellyfish.

In progress

* Something fairy-tale-based, probably a couple of SCPs linked together by a common theme: an anomaly hunter in the medieval days called the Woodsman.
* A thing involving a city where the lights began to fall.
