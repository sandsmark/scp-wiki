**Name:** Researcher ███████ Min

**Clearance:** Level 3

**Description:** --Researcher Min is a lazy little fucker who won't compile his own personnel file, and instead forces innocent co-workers like myself to do it for him. He is a complete and utter disgrace to the Foundation and can go die in a fire. A FIRE LACED WITH SADNESS AND BLEEDING INFANTS.--

--Sorry, I didn't know you meant //physical// description. Okay. Geez. Researcher Min is shorter than most doorways in Site-72, but can't fit through the service corridor without bending over. Or losing weight for that matter. He's also kinda Asian but he's never elaborated so I don't even give a fuck.--

**History:** --Dude, I wasn't even //here// when you joined. Ow. Fuck you. You know what? You can compile the rest of this shitty file yourself. Fine. Go on. Be like that, then.--

Researcher Min graduated from ███████ University with a degree in something important. Then a nice-looking guy in a suit asked him to join some aerodynamics firm and before he knew it he was slaving his ass off 50 hours a week in return for a salary that won't even cover the downpayment on his mansion. Seriously, boss? If you're reading this, try considering what they call a 'raise'. It helps a lot with the morale. Seriously.

God why am I even doing this shit

Things Researcher Min contained and catalogued and all that:

* [[[SCP-632]]]: Headache spiders
* [[[SCP-932]]]: Sleep-paralysis-thingers. Fuck, I'm bad at descriptions, I wish Bryan were here to help me do this. The lazy prick.
* [[[SCP-1373]]]: Laser sharks. Not sure what happened to them now, maybe got them all souped up for some O5 dinner party. With great help from Voct. Maybe I should buy him a drink sometime.

Things that would have been things that Researcher Min contained and catalogued except that all I've got are these stories and how the hell am I supposed to find SCPs that are stories good lord:

* [[[the-woven-man |Woven Man: A fairytale]]]
* [[[the-other-side |The Other Side: Not a fairytale]]]
