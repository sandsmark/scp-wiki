> The following documents and files are regularly updated to this day by an unknown transmission process or mechanism. Due to limited security risk and its isolation from the primary network, the terminal and files within are not a necessary target for termination. Documentations found within are notable in the sense that they are all but formatted improperly, and lack adherence to common tone guidelines. Some officials argue that the objects do not exist or are already existing objects categorized improperly.

[[tab Commentary]]

Do you like my stuff? Yes? Good! You might like [http://www.scp-wiki.net/ophite-s-personnel-file Ophite]'s stuff! 

[[[SCP-893 | SCP-893 "Asexual"]]] My first article, I think. There's not much to say about this, if only it was posted around the time I stopped writing purple poetry and started down the path to learning what makes a good story. TheDeadlyMoose played a big part in making this happen and was very understanding of my snowflake tendencies at the time. I probably wouldn't have been on the wiki much longer if it weren't for him and SalmanCorbette.

[[[SCP-1124 | SCP-1124 "Xenoplague"]]] Alien did not even cross my mind while writing this, if you choose to believe that or not. The idea was as simple as "682 eggs", and that was it. If anything these are modified and less effective //Mass Effect// Reapers.

[[[SCP-1200 | SCP-1200 "The Means to Delay"]]] Another earlier article that I wrote before I was completely immersed in the culture of the wiki. It's Left for Dead as the product of experimentation to improve containment for a very dangerous Keter class SCP. The idea was, "What if the Foundation intentionally created a skip?" or, "Skips that are the products of other skips.". 

[[[SCP-1203 | SCP-1203 "Ouroboros"]]] Admittedly, a 2012 apocalypse gimmick. This was posted on New Years day before the turn of the year. The idea I was exploring here (which I don't think I explored effectively) was a skip with an incomplete documentation. Effects that are hinted at, but the reader would be left to think at length about them.

[[[SCP-1286 | SCP-1286 "Sad Man"]]] A skip that isn't a skip. A completely mundane object with an SCP documentation. Who's fooling who here? Why does this exist?

[[[SCP-1519 | SCP-1519 "Renaissance Organism"]]] A skip created by mundane means. Threats to normalcy that are completely normal.

[[[SCP-1682 | SCP-1682 "Solar Parasite"]]] This one always has me torn. It's a problem I have with most of my articles - do I let you know everything, or do I leave you to guess? The argument to leave you in the blue goes something like this: "The Foundation can't possibly know everything, so why should you?".

[[[SCP-1735 | SCP-1735 "Kind of Impenetrable Barrier"]]] You don't have to bother reading this, because [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1584 1584] did it better. My intention was to experiment with what makes a skip interesting. The answer: not much.

[[[SCP-1782 | SCP-1782 "Tabula Rasa"]]] Based on a night terror I had a while back. One of my goals in writing is to convey a sense of //dread// in an organic way that is immediately relateable to the reader. If you've ever had a night terror you know it; false awakenings, fear of being trapped, then waking up into paralysis and finally screaming. I don't think I was entirely successful in capturing this; the most I got out of it was what I think is the interesting concept of an aborted reality bender.

[[tab Soundtracks!]]
Fantem did something like this on [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dr-fantem-s-personnel-file his page]. Basically what I have here is a bunch of songs that lyrically match or are just evocative of a skip article here on the site.
