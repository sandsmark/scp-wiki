[[tab Documentary Research Snippets]]
> One universe and two dimensions away, flying creatures made of light make their way toward ancestral breeding grounds.
> 
> Colorful streaks of light make their way down from space into a massive grey-purple electrical storm on a tiny ghost planet. At the same time, they make there way towards the small town of Peidmont, South Carolina.
> 
> When they pass through the clouds and reach the surface of the barren, dead planet, they are also at the foot of the Smoky Mountains, hurdling towards a festival near Peidmont's city hall.
> 
> The tails of the creatures show like eight rainbows in the sky, with all their colors mixing together. They join together with the humans, and the humans are altered so that the process could continue like it always had.
> 
> The light creatures all die, their legacy having been transferred. The pregnancies come to term on Earth, revealing nothing. Meanwhile on the ghost planet, bright orbs of light appear out of nothingness and pulsate for a short time before launching off into the sky.
> 
> This method of trans-dimensional cross-species reproduction is typical for light creatures of their size, and, in a dimension where physical, sentient life is impossible, it's a necessity.
> 
> This phenomenon is seen and not seen on Earth in several dimensions. Trans-dimensional species behave strangely. The light creatures evolved to exist in both places at once. Some creatures share the same ability, although they exist in both places physically. This can be tormenting for the creature, because it can't die and be alive at the same time, and will always be trapped by it's shadow.
> 
> Some are simply trapped in universes that aren't appropriate due to fault of their own, or the effect of something else. This can get chaotic. To explain these things here would be silly, as these things aren't as they should be, and in the traumatic process of traveling between universal laws they come out a bit strange. Their appearance is superficial, and they almost always behave erratically.
> 
> Of course, not everything that the Foundation has a hold of is the product of trans-dimensional wackiness. There are enough nooks and crannies in our own universe to contend with even the most complicated and confusing of the Escher-Housecat class dimensions.
> 
> How do you tell if an object is from our universe? Well, you can't, really, but you can get a very good idea. For example, a thing like a fortune telling machine with thousands of grasping hands is definitely exotic,  probably not what we perceive it to be, and the behavior suggests that it's having a really tough time adapting to our laws. Now,  I shouldn't have to explain that a violent man that can summon swords out of his hands is obviously something domestic, and in the very least a product of something else that's not incredibly different than the original.

[[tab Commentary]]

Do you like my stuff? Yes? Good! It's time for you to start reading [http://www.scp-wiki.net/ophite-s-personnel-file Ophite]'s stuff! 

[[[SCP-893 | SCP-893 "Asexual"]]] My first article, I think. There's not much to say about this, if only it was posted around the time I stopped writing purple poetry and started down the path to learning what makes a good story. TheDeadlyMoose played a big part in making this happen and was very understanding of my snowflake tendencies at the time. I probably wouldn't have been on the wiki much longer if it weren't for him and SalmanCorbette.

[[[SCP-1124 | SCP-1124 "Xenoplague"]]] Alien did not even cross my mind while writing this, if you choose to believe that or not. The idea was as simple as "682 eggs", and that was it. If anything these are modified and less effective //Mass Effect// Reapers.

[[[SCP-1200 | SCP-1200 "The Means to Delay"]]] Another earlier article that I wrote before I was completely immersed in the culture of the wiki. It's Left for Dead as the product of experimentation to improve containment for a very dangerous Keter class SCP. The idea was, "What if the Foundation intentionally created a skip?" or, "Skips that are the products of other skips.". 

[[[SCP-1203 | SCP-1203 "Ouroboros"]]] Admittedly, a 2012 apocalypse gimmick. This was posted on New Years day before the turn of the year. The idea I was exploring here (which I don't think I explored effectively) was a skip with an incomplete documentation. Effects that are hinted at, but the reader would be left to think at length about them.

[[[SCP-1286 | SCP-1286 "Sad Man"]]] A skip that isn't a skip. A completely mundane object with an SCP documentation. Who's fooling who here? Why does this exist?

[[[SCP-1519 | SCP-1519 "Renaissance Organism"]]] A skip created by mundane means. Threats to normalcy that are completely normal.

[[[SCP-1682 | SCP-1682 "Solar Parasite"]]] This one always has me torn. It's a problem I have with most of my articles - do I let you know everything, or do I leave you to guess? The argument to leave you in the blue goes something like this: "The Foundation can't possibly know everything, so why should you?".

[[[SCP-1735 | SCP-1735 "Kind of Impenetrable Barrier"]]] You don't have to bother reading this, because [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1584 1584] did it better. My intention was to experiment with what makes a skip interesting. The answer: not much.

[[[SCP-1782 | SCP-1782 "Tabula Rasa"]]] Based on a night terror I had a while back. One of my goals in writing is to convey a sense of //dread// in an organic way that is immediately relateable to the reader. If you've ever had a night terror you know it; false awakenings, fear of being trapped, then waking up into paralysis and finally screaming. I don't think I was entirely successful in capturing this; the most I got out of it was what I think is the interesting concept of an aborted reality bender.

[[tab Soundtracks!]]
Fantem did something like this on [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dr-fantem-s-personnel-file his page]. Basically what I have here is a bunch of songs that lyrically match or are just evocative of a skip article here on the site.

* **Rewrites:** I do not wish for anything I've done here to be rewritten. If a page falls to low ratings you may delete the article and use the concept after the original is gone from the wiki.

* **Reclaiming Authorship:** Roget and some other senior staff know my email address. Soulless (and whoever reads the Mugshots post) knows what I look like.

* **Attribution and Merchandising:** As long as I'm credited you can do what you want with my stuff. If you plan on doing anything with my stuff that falls outside of the creative commons license (such as merchandising), contact me directly.
