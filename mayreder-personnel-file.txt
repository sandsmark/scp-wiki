[[tab Personal Notes]]

> Dimensions
> 
> One universe and two dimensions away, flying creatures made of light make their way toward ancestral breeding grounds.
> 
> Colorful streaks of light make their way down from space into a massive grey-purple electrical storm on a tiny ghost planet. At the same time, they make there way towards the small town of Peidmont, South Carolina.
> 
> When they pass through the clouds and reach the surface of the barren, dead planet, they are also at the foot of the Smoky Mountains, hurdling towards a festival near Peidmont's city hall.
> 
> The tails of the creatures show like eight rainbows in the sky, with all their colors mixing together. They join together with the humans, and the humans are altered so that the process could continue like it always had.
> 
> The light creatures all die, their legacy having been transferred. The pregnancies come to term on Earth, revealing nothing. Meanwhile on the ghost planet, bright orbs of light appear out of nothingness and pulsate for a short time before launching off into the sky.
> 
> This method of trans-dimensional cross-species reproduction is typical for light creatures of their size, and, in a dimension where physical, sentient life is impossible, it's a necessity.
> 
> This phenomenon is seen and not seen on Earth in several dimensions. Trans-dimensional species behave strangely. The light creatures evolved to exist in both places at once. Some creatures share the same ability, although they exist in both places physically. This can be tormenting for the creature, because it can't die and be alive at the same time, and will always be trapped by it's shadow.
> 
> Some are simply trapped in universes that aren't appropriate due to fault of their own, or the effect of something else. This can get chaotic. To explain these things here would be silly, as these things aren't as they should be, and in the traumatic process of traveling between universal laws they come out a bit strange. Their appearance is superficial, and they almost always behave erratically.
> 
> Of course, not everything that the Foundation has a hold of is the product of trans-dimensional wackiness. There are enough nooks and crannies in our own universe to contend with even the most complicated and confusing of the Escher-Housecat class dimensions.
> 
> How do you tell if an object is from our universe? Well, you can't, really, but you can get a very good idea. For example, a thing like a fortune telling machine with thousands of grasping hands is definitely exotic,  probably not what we perceive it to be, and the behavior suggests that it's having a really tough time adapting to our laws. Now,  I shouldn't have to explain that a violent man that can summon swords out of his hands is obviously something domestic, and in the very least a product of something else that's not incredibly different than the original.

[[tab Files]]
> The following documents and files are regularly updated to this day by an unknown transmission process or mechanism. Due to limited security risk and its isolation from the primary network, the terminal and files within are not a necessary target for termination. Documentations found within are notable in the sense that they are all but formatted improperly, and lack adherence to common tone guidelines. Some officials argue that the objects do not exist or are already existing objects categorized improperly.
> 
> Agent Breen and Field Researcher Sanders are tasked with the reception of new information, forwarding of information, and scouting to confirm authenticity of Mayreder reports.
