Bullets whiz overhead as I begin making a foxhole out of the mortar crater I find myself in, my rusted and muddied rifle at arm's reach. The smell of rain, and death, and gunfire, and spent explosives, and a million other, more subtle scents that can best be described as "war" fills my nostrils. There is a steady drizzle, turning my entire world into sticky mud. If my uniform weren't filthy, there'd be a visible tag that says "Nobody" over my right breast pocket, and another that says "Some dead God"[[footnote]]I'd used smaller font to make it fit.[[/footnote]] over the left. My gear is in tatters, and, as a missile from a ballistae zooms overhead and the distinctive rumbling and flash of a nuclear detonation far, far in the distance washes over me, I can only wish that I had MOPP gear (or at least a gas mask). I've already died three times this week, and I'm getting tired of it.

In a foxhole/mortar crater/natural dip in the terrain[[footnote]]Kinda hard to tell the difference, to be entirely honest[[/footnote]] about three meters to my right, an Oxidist barely below autoignition temperature is likewise taking cover. I try to shout over the sound of, well, everything around me, to let him know he needs to stay in cover and cool down, but he can't hear me. Most of his body is in some sort of hexigrade configuration, but his left hand is clearly human for a brief moment that he takes to give me a thumbs-up, before he jumps out of cover for a charge and immediately explodes. I'd had the fortune of seeing that shit coming and had rolled further into the foxhole a mere instant before he'd exploded.

Just as I'm starting to think that maybe I should take a nap and wait for reinforcements (or my next violent demise) I feel the earth beneath me tremble in a way altogether different from the constant thudding of artillery and occasional thudding of rubble tossed by trebuchets. Before I can get the sense of mind to get out of my foxhole and start running back to friendly lines, a gigantic hand grasps me about the torso and lifts me into the air.

A moment later, I find myself face-to-face with a being that can only be described as an anthropomorphic demon dragonfly. Gigantic compound eyes reflect my own ratty visage back to me, while lobster-red carapace covers the rest of the vaguely-human-shaped monstrosity. Though I can't turn around to see, I know its hand is covered in the same carapace. Runes glowing in gold are scattered about its surface. The whole thing seems to be made of spikes. I know it carries some sort of massive weapon[[footnote]]Broken God knows what, though[[/footnote]] in its other hand. It's holding me Broken God knows how many meters above the filthy battlefield. A normal human would probably be terrified. Makes me grateful I'm not a normal human.

As I'm thinking that, my brain is shattered by a psychic barrage. //INSECT YOU WILL SUBMIT/THERE IS NO SALVATION/THERE IS NO END TO THIS WAR/THE ONE AND SINGULAR GOD WILL CONSUME YOU TEN THOUSAND TIMES AND YOU WILL BE GRATEFUL FOR HIS MERCY/ALL SHALL SUBMIT/I HAVE SEEN THE WORLD OF YOUR VICTORY/AND IT IS BARREN/I DO NOT WISH FOR THIS/BUT YOUR REFUSAL TO SUBMIT/HAS FORCED MY HAND//--

When I feel myself getting ready to pass out, the whole world around me starts spinning; the damnable thing's let me go, and now I'm falling back to the ground. As I tumble, I notice a line of Colossi advancing towards me from friendly lines, dozens of tanks (ranging from British Mark Is to M1A9 Abrams fitted with 43,000-volt plasma accelerators) at their feet, prepared to deal with Ol' Red's Regulars while the Colossi deal with jerks like Lexx up there.

One of the aforementioned tanks had fired a shot at Lexx's face, resulting in my current predicament. Just as I'm mentally preparing myself for the oncoming 4^^th^^ death of the week, a blur of feathers and horsehair and Hun scoops me out of the sky and starts soaring back towards friendly lines. I couldn't help but tell the Khan's soldier, "Aren't you a //deus ex machina// for sore eyes?!" As we soar back to the supply depot, I start to think of the decisions that led me to this point...

-----

I'd been born to an Army Infantry medic dad and an Air Force nurse mom. Between their PCSes and their TDYs and their other acronyms-that-meant-time-apart, my mom decided to let her contract expire without renewal, leaving Dad as the sole breadwinner for the family not too long after I was born.

When Bush Sr. decided we needed to bomb Saddam to Hell and back, my father went off to war. Both of my folks would later tell me that those were some of the most trying moments of their relationship. When my dad got back, he reclassed into a desk job at the earliest opportunity; steady work with limited chances of forced moves or deployments meant limited chances of missing everything he'd missed when he was in Iraq.

By the time September of 2001 rolled around, I was almost 12 and my father was pushing close to a pension. Between me and my kid sister, he wasn't ready to go back to war, even with the way people felt in the aftermath of the tragedy. So he stayed behind his desk with his NCO pay while my mom finally got around to using her GI bill money and starting school.

By the time I graduated High School, three things had happened: 1) My father had retired and we'd settled down in his hometown in southern New Mexico; 2) my mother had earned her bachelor's in business and was doing a pretty solid job of putting it to use for a local company, and 3) I'd gotten an Air Force ROTC scholarship lined up at New Mexico State. I lived in the dorms and barely managed to pay my way through the whole thing, but I was able to keep my scholarships and earn a degree in Mechanical Engineering, with a minor in Military Science that resulted in Lieutenant's bars being slapped onto my collar at graduation.

What followed was the Combat Rescue Officer pipeline. At the end of it, I was assigned a small unit of men who I was expected to watch out for and lead into combat. That was in 2014; my first deployment was to Iraq in 2015, as President Obama tried to get the whole Islamic State mess under control while the rest of the world seemed on the brink of burning down... Now that I'm thinking about it, it almost seems like the whole world //has// been burning down for a pretty long time. Heh. Kinda like the one Billy Joel song, I forget how it goes...

Anyway, I deployed with my unit to Iraq once before the shitstorm that was the 2016 Presidential Election, and once before the new Fearless Leader decided we didn't need to be hurting IS trash anymore than we already had. On the tail end of that deployment, I was tasked with helping some individuals who are best described as "Secret Squirrels" in their effort to get... someone... out of a really hairy place in the middle of fucking nowhere in the southern half of the country. The Secret Squirrels, being Secret Squirrels, weren't too keen to elaborate on who we were moving or why they were important. My job was to help organize the Air Force boots until we all got evac'd, and I'd learned from senior NCOs and my superiors not to question the motives of Secret Squirrels.

When I got back Stateside, between post-deployment paperwork and briefings and all the rest of the bullshit, I was approached by a grey-haired gentleman wearing a nondescript white longsleeve shirt, black tie, and what I'll totally objectively describe as //bitchin'// aviators with a job offer. My pay would go up significantly, but my life insurance and benefits would stay the same and I'd have to PCS and wouldn't be allowed to tell anyone where I was going.

I would later come to know that man as Colonel Baker, commander of Armed Mobile Task Force Sigma-117 ("Orbital Drop Rock Troopers"). I'd also come to know him as my boss.

The Foundation has a program for MTF Officers, wherein they have to go through a trial period as an enlisted MTF operator/agent before receiving a command position. Worst-case scenario, the recruit is a screwup and the Foundation gives 'em back to their respective military or police force (after a pleasant dosing of amnestics). Average scenario, they stay enlisted for longer than the minimum probationary period (because the Foundation needs the boots more than they need an uber-hardcore washout rate). Best case scenario, Foundation has a new MTF Officer. As much as I hate admitting that I wasn't good enough, I wasn't good enough for that officer position at the end of my probationary period.

So I took a hit to my paycheck and a very humbling reminder that, in this line of work, sometimes you have to climb up the ladder more than once.

Skipping over a decade of (admittedly really interesting) Foundation service, I found myself with the rank of Captain and a number of other MTF operatives (from multiple MTFs, no less) all learning to speak German, and learning to wear Schutzstaffel Uniforms, and waiting for some Nazi assholes to splatter all over the pavement in Berlin so we'd know it would be safe to use the time machine they'd failed to use as an escape in order to wrap up what appeared to be a closed-fixed temporal loop.

After what doing what was easily the most morally dubious work I've ever done in my life, I was presented with a choice: take on the moniker "Nobody" and go about being mysterious and shit while leaving everything I thought I knew and cared about behind, or die with a dozen other good men who had been abandoned to a predetermined fate they weren't even given the courtesy of being warned about.

I can't say I'm proud of my choice, but I can say that they probably got it easy compared to me, as evidenced by the fact that I've been fighting some dead god's war for the last few decades.

+++ SCP Objects
In chronological posting order, my skips are:

[[collapsible show="SCP-2173" hide="-SCP-2173" hideLocation="both"]]
[[[SCP-2173]]] will always have a special place in my heart because it's the first thing I ever published to this site. Regardless of anything else I say here, I'm proud that it never had to be deleted by Staff, that it was (somewhat) positively received by the community.

Rereading it immediately prior to writing this review has been... insightful. For as much as I dislike it, for as many problems as it has, I did a lot right. I still have no idea where I learned to write Foundationspeak like that, and there are a lot of little details explaining that I at least //thought// I knew what I was talking about. The inspiration (I was taking HAZMAT A&O at the time I started writing) is pretty obvious, and it feels like I thought I knew more about HAZMAT/emergency/incident response and all that than maybe I actually did. I still try to cram little details like that in now, but with more... finesse. I think it's probably something I'll never quite let go of.

However, a problem I see with a lot of my writing is, well, hamfistedness. And holy //crap// is 2173 hammy. Seriously, I have no idea what I was thinking; Ephialtes is cliched as hell, the O5 note is hammy as hell, the Pattern Screamer note, the whole thing is just.. it's canned ham.

Another problem with 2173 is, well, it's sort of nonsensical. There's four separate stories, none of which mesh up with each other and are all somehow in the same document, with none of them being properly focused on in a manner that delivers emotional impact. Those stories are, in order of presentation:
# A Foundationverse HAZMAT incident which has too many GOIs without any justification for it.
# A Foundation researcher going rogue in a manner that's, well, under-explored and hammy.
# A Foundationverse trans-universal diplomatic incident that's never properly justified in any conceivable way.
# Pattern Screamers out of left field.
Clearly, it's a mess. I think a better approach might be to roll the Pattern Screamer thing into the trans-universal thing and make it all more subtle. The HAZMAT thing was dumb and can go away. The rogue researcher thing can be rolled into the other two if done correctly, but that'll take some effort and some hard thinking before it happens.

Honestly, rereading it just now has been the best thing for my motivation to delete it and rewrite it. I somehow got fanart, which is cool, so I'll try to write in a manner consistent with keeping the fanart accurate, but I'm less than impressed with the... not-Foundationspeak parts of the skip. I think I'm getting better, but I'm still disappointed.

Recommended Listening is.... I got nothing. The rewrite will be more coherent and therefore have a better soundtrack.

[[collapsible show="SCP-2237" hide="-SCP-2237" hideLocation="both"]]
[[[SCP-2237]]] was initially an attempt at a 001 Proposal.

It didn't work. I rushed it, I didn't (and still don't) have the coding skill/design skill to make a good 001, I used a somewhat cliched premise, and I didn't truly put in the necessary effort for making a successful 001. All this resulted in it dropping like a stone and me self-deleting the hub page. I then rewrote the 001-ish bits of the two system pages, edited it to say "2237" instead of "001" and reposted the hub page (some of you may notice that 2237 uses the same coding trick as [[[SCP-1173]]]). It's been gaining a slow-but-steady stream of upvotes since then, along with what appear to be foreign translations and at least two separate pieces of personified fanart.

My personal feelings towards it are mixed. On the one hand, I still want to try the whole cyclical history thing again, and I feel like it was a better use of [[[SCP-1795]]] than 2173 (yes, the blackboxed skip in 2237 is 1795), but on the other, I feel like I didn't give the concept justice. I want to delete and start over, like with 2173.

I don't really have much more to say, besides maybe that brevity doesn't work here.

[[collapsible show="SCP-2273" hide="-SCP-2273" hideLocation="both"]]
[[[SCP-2273]]] is, at time of writing, my highest-rated work. It gets a lot of praise within the community, though it seems to be mostly unknown outside our close circle. Which is weird, because it's sitting at over +200 right now.

The writing features the same sort of bloatedness of my two earlier skips, and the interviews are campy as hell. However, I've created a character that is immensely versatile and... easy picking for feelsy stories. And, like I said, the character's been well-received by the closest parts of the wiki community. When I wrote the skip, I was more trying to create an alternate timeline wherein Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. had survived WWII and reached the Oval Office in lieu of his brother John. Instead, I now have a millenia-spanning alt-Foundationverse with dieselpunk and biopunk and atompunk influences.

For those of you interested in seeing how I went from "Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. in Oval Office" to "War criminal with PTSD and survivor's guilt," here's the story:
* Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. was the older brother of John, Ted, and Robert Kennedy. He was a US Navy pilot in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Aphrodite Operation Anvil], a joint US Army Air Force and US Navy project to turn bomber planes into bigass guided missiles. The planes required someone to take them into the air, activate the radio-control functions, and arm the explosives. This often ended in big firey explosions that would instantly kill the crew. Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. was one such crew member.
* In order for my alt-universe to have Joe Kennedy as POTUS, he'd need to survive the war. For some reason, my first thought when presented with this conundrum was "biopunk computers did the flying for him, he was doing something less risky and therefore survived." I decided to stick with that and follow the logic train.
* Biopunk tech had to be commonplace for Operation Anvil to have been able to use it freely. First thought on possible places to source biopunk tech from was [[[SCP-1000]]]. They'd have to have been in contact with humanity for several decades to have had a major impact, which meant I needed to come up with a point of origin for their diplomacy with humans.
* This lead me to the idea of humanity "re-discovering* SCP-1000 during the Great War (perhaps caused by use of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lochnagar_mine the Lochnagar mine] or similar weaponry) and making weapons deals with them.
* I didn't see them being happy just selling weapons to humanity, so I needed to come up with some sort of endgame for them. Eventually, I settled on the extinction of the human race through playing every side. Seemed like the obvious direction to take it.
* This resulted in a story about an alt-ending to WWI and an alt-WWII, resulting in an alt-Cold War that went hot in 1963 during a fictitious "Turkish Missile Crisis."
* After a lot of consideration, I decided that a good anomaly from this world would be a soldier who was accidentally sent to the Foundationverse via weapons that warp spacetime. The personal story came afterward, basically as an afterthought.

Alexei as a character is a combination of multiple things, ranging from campy '50s B-Movie monsters, to Nazi and Soviet and more obscure war criminals/war crime victims, from EDM album covers to me //really// wanting Halo-style power armor to find its way onto the wiki. He's an enigma to me because I somehow managed to take a child soldier/nuclear war survivor and turn him into a war criminal, a war crime victim, and at the end of it all he's a sad everyman character instead of some sort of larger-than life cliche. I'm proud of myself, and I hope to be able to match the achievement again in the future.

[[collapsible show="SCP-2367" hide="-SCP-2367" hideLocation="both"]]
[[[SCP-2367]]] is the first entry I made into an SCP contest. I was somewhat pressed for time, and it was written for the Short Works contest, meaning that writing it theoretically didn't require as much time. It allowed me to streamline the writing process and the word constraints forced me to seek out easier, more concise ways of delivering the message I sought to deliver. 2367, I think, is a demarcation point and a sign of me growing up as an author.

It's also two separate things that maybe I shouldn't be too proud of. First, it's a horror-comedy piece about Nazis impacting Berlin's pavement at terminal velocity, which, thinking about it, is wildly fucked-up. The reader is supposed to laugh because "Ha ha, fuck Nazis," but then the fridge horror of "Oh shit, they might hurt people when they land" is supposed to kick in. And then the reader is supposed to realize that, hey, maybe laughing at their gruesome demise isn't cool, even if they are Nazis. So it's meant to make the reader think a little bit.

The other reason I wrote 2367 is so I could have a canonically-accepted Nazi-built time machine for use in a story arc involving a time-travelling MTF who infiltrates the Ahnenerbe SS and then dies a pre-determined fate they weren't even given the courtesy of being warned about. I didn't include any references to that in the document for two reasons: 1) word constraints, and 2) it could interfere with the comedy-horror I had going on.

I still want to write a story about the saboteur who set up the splat part of "Splatzshtaffel."

My feelings towards [[[SCP-2371]]] can best be described by David Tennant:

||~ It's a fixed point in time. There's nothing I can do. ||

[[/div]]

SCP-2371 was inspired by a George Harrison song I heard on the local oldies station while driving. I pretty much immediately felt the drive to coldpost the article, wiki norms and consequences be damned. I have since come to the conclusion that it's somehow related to the Broken Goddess, but have nothing more to say on that besides the fact that it isn't canon. I think I'll call such stories "Elseworld MacCanon."

[[collapsible show="SCP-2473" hide="-SCP-2473" hideLocation="both"]]
[[[SCP-2473]]] is a big chunk of MacCanon. Probably my biggest piece of blatant worldbuilding since 2273. It's part of baseline MacCanon continuity but I didn't really know how to incorporate facets of the whole "the Veil is shot but we're still trying to do our job discreetly anyway" thing into the narrative. Honestly, it doesn't need to be part of the narrative; it's a background detail.

I'm dissatisfied with 2473's performance, but I don't know how to improve the article while maintaining the integrity of the central narrative. The idea was to explain at least a small part of my headcanon on [[[SCP-1795]]] and the history of MacCanon humanity in general. I was also shooting for an intentionally vague sense of dread, of wtf-ness that seems to have gone over the majority of readers' heads; my current running theory is that the wiki is jaded and my article did not work to distinguish itself from other, similar articles; the connection to other works, to a greater whole was ignored.

I don't know.

[[collapsible show="SCP-2739" hide="-SCP-2739" hideLocation="both"]]
[[[SCP-2739]]] is deeply personal to me. There isn't much I'd like to say about it that I haven't already said on the discussion page. Instead, I'll talk about the inspiration outside of my personal life.

||~ //Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima//, by Jim Rosenthal/the Associated Press  ||

[[/div]]

The men in this picture are, from left to right, Ira Hayes, Harold Schultz, Michael Strank, Rene Gagnon(back), Franklin Sousley(front), and Harlon Block. Strank, Block, and Sousley would die on Iwo Jima over the following days as the fight continued, along with 6,000 other United States Marines and sailors and 17,000 Japanese troops.

Ira Hayes was Native American; because the photo of him and the other Marines raising the flag was one of the most successful pieces of wartime propaganda //ever//, he became something of a celebrity when he came home. However, this was the 1940s. Mental healthcare for guys like him was next to nonexistent. And he was Native American. But he fought in the "white man's war." So white America didn't want him. His tribe didn't want him. He fell into alcoholism pretty damn quickly after Americans got bored with their war heroes.

On January 23, 1955 Hayes was found dead not too far from his home. Official cause of death was listed as exposure and alcohol poisoning, but he'd gotten into a brawl over a card game the night before. Tribe police never investigated. There was no autopsy.

----

Another story, unfortunately less verifiable than that of Ira Hayes, goes like this: several men from my hometown were in the New Mexico National Guard in 1941 when their unit, the 200^^th^^ Coast Artillery, was selected to deploy to the Philippines to bolster anti-aircraft defenses there. In December, the Imperial Japanese Army attacked and the 200^^th^^ were the first to fight. As the Japanese troops advanced, the 200^^th^^ retreated south, to the Bataan Peninsula. They were captured in April of 1942, among the last of American and Filipino forces to surrender. They were forced to march approximately 60 miles through the Filipino jungle without food or medical care to a train station that transported them to the POW Camp where they spent the next three years, facing treatment similar to political prisoners and "//Untermenschen//" in Germany at the same time.

One such individual survived the war, came home and, much like Ira Hayes, fell into alcoholism. He wasn't able to hold down a job or own a home or raise a family. By the '50s, he'd become a target of stones thrown by the kids of the men who hadn't fought alongside him. "He's just a wino, who cares about him?" The person who told me this story said that, when his father found out the storyteller had been throwing stones, he'd gotten his ass whooped and had the origin of the man's problems spelled out for him very clearly.

The point is, in military organizations across the planet, substance abuse is a deep-set problem. And in poor communities. Essentially, the most trodden-upon people and the people most willing to give everything they have for the sake of others are also the ones who are thrown under the bus, tossed aside and forgotten about. And it ain't fucking right. 2739 is, in part, a manifestation of my anger towards that.

[[collapsible show="SCP-2783" hide="-SCP-2783" hideLocation="both"]]
[[[SCP-2783]]] is one of many, many, many projects I've had in my head and in my sandbox forever, never going anywhere with it. I think this is marking a change in my //modus operandi//. I'm tired of having these dozens of projects, sitting unfinished. And the crit process for the site has become slow, cumbersome, and somewhat unhelpful from where I'm sitting. So, for the foreseeable future, I am probably going to seek minimal (if any) critique. Honestly, 2783 is something of a work-in-progress at this point; a mid-level revision should be coming eventually.

As for the SCP itself, I already gave the heaviest spoilers away in the discussion page: it's a graveyard left over from the war between the earliest human civilization (engineers and innovators and the builders of the Clockwork Goddess) and the Children of the Scarlet King (Daevites). The Clockwork Goddess likes selfless, smart, creative, innovative people. The Foundation aren't good guys by any means, but the Clockwork Goddess has decided that they are the most likely to keep the little critters who built her alive, and that's why she's thrown her lot in with them. The other people interred there, the pre-Foundation people, were similarly innovative, selfless people; many of them belonged to Foundation precursors.

As indicated by some of the earlier gravemarkers, a time is coming when those interred there are going to come back to finish the war they started.

+++ Tales

In chronological posting order, my Foundation Tales are:

[[collapsible show="Aftermath" hide="-Aftermath" hideLocation="both"]]
[[[Aftermath]]] is my entry to the Dystopia contest, and my first Tale. I can't remember the full story, but I remember that I wrote it entirely from a mobile device. I had to have my buddy Americium241 post it for me (Madison come back ;-;) because of that. Not gonna lie, I'm still impressed with that.

As for the writing itself, having just reread it, I see a lot of my current habits still there, as well as a lot of my since-abandoned bad habits. It was written for the Dystopia Contest and, instead of being creative about it, I seemed to have gone for a generic pseudo-Orwellian world. However, the "worldbuilding" of the piece demonstrates a clear misunderstanding of how governments and large organizations and mass media and the world all work. I feel that my grasp on those things has improved and matured, but I don't know. The basic premise is one of [[[SCP-2217]]] forcing the Foundation to go public, but I demonstrated a blatant misunderstanding of how the years to come would work out on the global scale and therefore demonstrated a blatant inability to write a story about such a premise effectively. I revisited the idea later (discussed below), and I feel that, if presented with the challenge of revisiting the narrative presented in the story, I could execute it more effectively.

It was originally an absolute MacCanon story, but is now definitely in the Elseworld category.

I'll also say that WWII supertech is an underexplored trope in site fiction. I've created a headcanon for Otto Weber, which has been elaborated on in other works and will be further elaborated on later in this author page and in later works. I don't have much else to say besides that this is also what I will call an Elseworld MacCanon story.

[[[retired extremely dangerous|RED]]] was inspired by March Madness 2K15 and the silliness it entailed. It was also inspired by my insistence that Alexei wouldn't have done as well as he did in that sort of a match-up fight. I wanted Von Pincier's help writing Xao, and so the project turned into a collaborative one. I jumped the gun and posted before Von Pincier had made his edits, so I let him edit the piece into its current form. Not much else to say besides I enjoyed worldbuilding both Xao's reality and Alexei's.

This is another Elseworld MacCanon story.

I personally feel that certain concepts, certain ideas, certain things are just so damn stupid that they shouldn't be peer-reviewed, they should be thrust upon the wiki to live or die exactly as the author initially conceived them. I also feel that Project Crossover is, without fail, something that should receive that treatment. I will never sandbox Project Crossover stories. They're getting posted directly to the wiki without review. Sorrynotsorry.gif

This same mentality spawned SCP-2371, so take it or leave it.

Because the Super Mario theme was too obvious a choice.

[[[scp-2273-f|Person of Interest File #2273/01]]] is... man. It's the first tale I have posted in a long time that is definitively MacCanon, and is probably the only one that will remain so.

Some may note that the premise is the same as Aftermath -- specifically, the Foundation is forced by [[[SCP-2217]]] to operate within the public eye as the world seems to crumble apart before their eyes. That's something that will remain true MacCanon forever. A world where the Foundation's goal of secrecy is shattered and the eldritch and unspeakable are forced to cooperate with the mundane not because they're kept secret but because they're now very much public. A world where a global conspiracy is ousted but is decided to still be a better option than the alternative is the best setting to write in, I think. I'll stand by that.

The URL is a low-key attempt to draw attention to the since-abandoned "Future Foundation" project. If the project can be revived and can maintain internal consistency, I'll probably try to mold it such that it's as close to MacCanon as possible.

As for the story itself, there's not much to say that hasn't been covered elsewhere. Alexei finds the One True God and speaks Her words before he dies. That's how it's supposed to be. All Elseworld adventures are simply fanservice and my own desire to see just how far I can take the character. The baseline reality that my SCP objects will be written within will be one where Alexei died on his knees, asking God for mercy. Take that however you will.

Not much to say about [[[when it's too late to go back|The only way left to go is forward]]] besides that this is, in part, the spiritual rewrite to [[[Aftermath]]] I've wanted to create for a long time. Part of the greater MacCanon. I might revisit other, more Aftermath-like stories in this same setting; there's a lot of imagery I neglected to use for this story but feel would fit the same melancholy I was shooting for in both Aftermath and this.

[[collapsible show="Jefferson Submarine" hide="-Jefferson Submarine" hideLocation="both"]]
[[[jefferson submarine hub|Jefferson Submarine]]] is a story of new beginnings, new friends, and the end of the world. It is (going to be) varying levels of pulpy ridiculousness but the end goal is mainly continuity/internal consistency and reaching the end of the pre-planned storyline. Whatever else happens, happens.

Below is a list of every original character and organization I have introduced to the site, in order of appearance by chronological posting of works:

* **[[[SCP-2173]]] (and supplementary material)**
 * **PoI 952404, "Ephialtes:"**
  * This person is a disgraced Foundation scientist. I haven't settled on a gender for them, but they are very, very self-absorbed. They don't want to take responsibility for their actions and will stop at nothing for "progress." They have good intentions, but those good intentions mean nothing because they make no consideration for ethics. Essentially, they are exactly what early writers for the wiki probably thought of as typical for Foundation scientists. This person has no conscience and no sense of right and wrong when it comes to interpersonal interaction. They're brilliant but selfish. They're going to get their own someday. **Appears in:** [[[Recovered Document SCP-2173-004]]]
* **[[[Aftermath]]]**
 * **Roderick Freeman:**
  * This man is a former MTF Nu-7 operative, a former Navy SEAL, entirely too trusting, and poorly written. Hopefully, he'll be rebooted with the rest of the MacCanon as I rewrite my old works. Aftermath won't be rewritten at any point, but I do intend to do a spiritual rewrite; hopefully a similar, non-Elseworlds version of Roderick can come out of it. **Appears in:** Aftermath, semi-reborn in The only way left to go is forward
 * **Thomas Skip:**
  * This is the second narrator of Aftermath. He is not outright named ('Skip' is used here as a placeholder surname), and is, quite honestly, probably the best character to come out of the story. At least one person mistook him for a her, and, since 1) this story is not canon, and 2) it's never blatantly stated that the kid Roderick reminisces about is the same kid remote-viewing him, I can probably safely revisit the entity. Perhaps in the spiritual rewrite, or perhaps on the mainlist. TBH, I hadn't thought about that too much until now. **Appears in:** Aftermath, semi-reborn in The only way left to go is forward
 * **The Bureau of Paranatural Affairs:**
  * They are the US Government's response to the breaking of the Veil. Whether or not I'll bring them back into the MacCanon is undecided, but they seem like a fun organization to work with. **Appears in:** Aftermath
  * **Agent Leonard Wells** was meant to be a repeat character, one who'd show up in every new iteration of MacCanon as a traitor to the Foundation and his fellow agents. He's meant to be a shady motherfucker who doesn't even come remotely close to seeming that way. As I think about it now, I'm inclined to let him die, narratively, in the abandoned corner of Elseworlds that the rest of Aftermath will forever reside in. **Appears in:** Aftermath
  * **Hailey Barret** and **Gabriel Rowley** are throwaway characters who work for the BPA, but they (especially Rowley) were meant to be demonstrations that their organization is much colder than the Foundation. I don't think they'll get proper development. **Appear in:** Aftermath
* **[[[SCP-2237]]] (both iterations)**
 * **SCP-2237 instances:**
  * Basically Gods who worship humans. There are 13 of them, one for each O5 Council member, with personalities based on respective O5 members. If I ever rewrite the skip, it'll incorporate the things I intended but never said. Possible connection to Overseers as they appear in [[*user Djoric]]'s [http://www.scp-wiki.net/stealingsolidarityhub Stealing Solidarity]...? **Appear in:** [http://www.scp-wiki.net/fragment:scp-2237-a Document 2237 Alfa]
 * **The Holy Emperor's Council on Unearthly Matters:**
  * An Imperial Japanese organization dedicated to educating and advising the Emperor and his subordinates on paranormal shit. Meant to provide for the idea of a Foundation that was global from the get-go. Since renamed to match the IRL organization 'Bureau of Onmyo' by [[*user MrWrong]] in his [[[SCP-2478]]]. A precursor to the IJAMEA (from [[[SCP-2937]]] by [[*user Mazyrian]]). Not as scientific or adventurous as other Foundation precursors, but wiser. Also, poorly-researched on my part. If/when I rewrite 2237, they'll still have a place there. **Appears in:** [http://www.scp-wiki.net/fragment:scp-2237-b Document 2237 Bravo], [[[SCP-2478]]] by [[*user MrWrong]], possibly elsewhere.
 * **The Tsar's Seers:**
  * Literally the exact same as the Council, above. Russian occultists who tell the Tsar what's going down. They didn't do so hot when the Revolution happened, but they essentially merged with the Foundation, with the holdouts joining the GOC or running off to the Library. There's a possible story arc involving them trying to reinstate the Tsars in there, somewhere. **Appears in:** [http://www.scp-wiki.net/fragment:scp-2237-b Document 2237 Bravo], possibly elsewhere.
* **[[[SCP-2273]]]**
 * **Dr. Thomas Friedrich:**
  * Dr. Friedrich is a West German-born psychologist. He is fluent in German and English and passable in half a dozen more languages; he's constantly reading up on languages in an effort to make himself more useful to the Foundation, and therefore less liable to be put out of a job; as of the events of [[[scp-2273-f|Person of Interest File #2273/01]]], those efforts have paid off, because his anomalous status landed him a place as a Type E Sapient Anomaly instead of as a regular skip. He is a devout Catholic and has difficulty reconciling his faith with his education and his work; the Site-17 chaplain is a close friend and confidante of his. He almost universally recommends downgrading sapient anomalies to Type-C, with the exception of the more dangerous skips that clearly need to remain Type-A. If he hadn't become an anomaly himself, he would have been made Site-17's Ethics Committee Liaison. He likes to play board and card games with skips, his patients, to put them at ease. **Appears in:** SCP-2273, [[[scp-2273-f|Person of Interest File #2273/01]]], possibly elsewhere but I highly doubt it.
 * **Alexei Belitrov:**
  * Alexei is literally a monster born out of the collective imagination of 1950s Americans: a Soviet military officer, a war criminal who has no qualms killing children, the nigh-unkillable result of inhuman military experimentation performed on children, the result of nuclear war with the Soviet Union, the list goes on. Nothing about his past is meant to make him seem like he should be empathetic as a character. However, despite his visage, despite the terrible, unforgivable things he's done, he's human. As stated in the discussion page for [[[scp-2273-f|Person of Interest File #2273/01]]], he //canonically// gives up a life of violence. However, his entire existence for nearly three decades was war. It's something he's a natural for, even if he hates it, even if he wants nothing whatsoever to do with it. Elseworlds stories wherein Alexei goes back to fighting aren't canon simply because the primary world I want to center my stories in has him at peace for the sake of the greater story. His default setting is holding a weapon and attempting to use it, even if he hates himself for doing so. **Appears in:** SCP-2273, [[[Retired, Extremely Dangerous]]], [[[War is Child's Play]]], [[[scp-2273-f|Person of Interest File #2273/01]]], possibly elsewhere but I haven't really checked.
* **[[[keine Kosten zu hoch]]]:**
 * **Otto Weber:**
  * A devout Lutheran, a dedicated member of the Nazi party, and a brilliant occultist, Otto Weber is basically every horror story one has heard about the Holocaust and every 'mad Nazi scientist' one has ever seen on TV/in books/in video games. He loves Hitler, loves Nazism, loves Germany, and loves the idea of building weapons to win the War. keine is the first //dedicated// Elseworlds story, and it is also where we see Otto Weber's true potential. It is also where we see his hubris catch up to him. His 'canonical' fate is much less certain and much less hubris-induced. In keine, he is killed when he is at his most monstrous, while MacCanon will force him to think about what he's done for a good, long while. **Appears in:** keine Kosten zu hoch, [[[SCP-2367]]], possibly elsewhere.
 * **Entity KOLOSS:**
  * Literally the Biblical 'Behemoth,' bound into a mundane weapons platform (specifically, the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landkreuzer_P._1500_Monster Landkreuzer P. 1500 Monster]). Doesn't like being woken up. Doesn't like being turned into a machine. Basically a mecha-682. Gets blown the fuck up in baseline MacCanon. Blows up literally the entire Europe in keine. **Appears in:** keine Kosten zu hoch
* **[[[Retired, Extremely Dangerous]]]:**
 * This tale features nothing new under the sun. Sorry.
* **[[[War is Child's Play]]]**
 * This tale is incomplete and I will not be listing the characters here until it is. Sorry.
* **[[[Strange Things Happen at Sea]]]:**
 * **Humphrey:**
  * A big ol' pupper. Will lick your face and fetch you endless buckets of ice cream if you're feeling down. Based on Isabel Wondertainment's corgi army. Nothing much else to him. **Appears in:** Strange Things Happen at Sea
* **[[[SCP-2367]]]:**
 * Do stains in the pavement count as characters?
* **[[[Home is a Place with Mushrooms]]]:**
 * Really? Fucking //really//? You're asking this question? No. Go sit in the corner.
* **[[[SCP-2371]]]:**
 * **SCP-2371-3:**
  * Uses an alias that's an old Greek word for "Nobody." Not connected to the rest of the wiki's "Nobody," though. Possibly pulling a prank on the Foundation. Possibly the Broken Goddess with a Jocasta complex. Possibly all be-tentacled and such. Possibly mistakes the Foundation for a hive-mind such as itself. The possibilities are endless, with ZOMBOCOM. Not likely to make any repeat appearances. **Appears in:** SCP-2371
* **[[[scp-2273-f|Person of Interest File #2273/01]]]:**
 * **The Eastern Clockwork Orthodox Church:**
  * A small sect of Mekhane worshipers who believe that Jesus Christ was born as the result of Mekhane's intervention, that the words of Jesus Christ are the path to salvation and Reconstruction. A derivative of the Russian Orthodox Church. Part of a larger phenomena generally referred to as 'Christian Reconstructionism,' which is a cover-all term for machine-worshiping Christians and not my original idea. They were incognito because of the Foundation until Lifted Veil Scenario 2217 was realized. The sect featured in the story is a monastic order, but not all of them are monks. **Appears in:** Person of Interest File #2273/01
 * **MCF Anomaly Reintegration Project:**
  * Not quite a character or organization, but a major part of MacCanon nonetheless. The Project began in mid-2018 following the Lifted Veil event, with the goal of reintegrating anomalies into everyday lives. The biggest part of this was helping released skips and other non-harmful sapient anomalies find work despite their anomalous properties, and educating the general public on the nature of anomalies (in an effort to prevent witch-hunts). The success of those two goals was moderate. **Appears in:** Person of Interest File #2273/01
 * **Agent Lakshmi Turnbow:**
  * A throwaway character who works with RAISA. I'm inclined to bring her back if I do more of this -F stuff. **Appears in:** Person of Interest File #2273/01
* **[[[SCP-2473]]]:**
 * **Doctor Samantha Moodley:**
  * Not sure what her doctorate is in... Archaeology, maybe? She's a Foundation scientist who specializes in restoration/reconstruction of damaged tech/artifacts. She exists in the //future// (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧. She's South African. Older, but not, like, geriatric. Takes her job seriously. Nice lady, but stern. **Appears in:** SCP-2473
 * **~Spooky Unnamed Autopilot~:**
  * Imagine the autopilot from WALL-E. Now imagine that it's less talkative and accidentally broke the one human it got stuck looking after. Now imagine that it facilitates games for that one human, but doesn't really know what the hell it's doing and has accidentally broken its own human even more. Basically, "I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream" but both characters are the evil robot and the depressed human at the same time.
 * **SCP-2473-2:**
  * Little girl stuck in a big computer. Got tired of hiding, decided to run for once. Finally made it home. Damn shame home can't make her, y'know, not a frozen corpse. Maybe a little crazy. Definitely a little spooky to look at. **Appears in:** SCP-2473
 * **D-2473-01:**
  * I had a real backstory for her at one point. This backstory no longer exists in my head. I can definitely say that she has never been incarcerated in the US penal system; I've worked with the kind of people in that system, and they are //far// from ideal candidates for human test subjects. Far too uppity. She's probably a clone of a Foundation scientist or something, Iunno. **Appears in:** SCP-2473
 * **Researcher Trudy Begay:**
  * Navajo lady. Possibly the first definitive case of a female Native American researcher on the site. Not sure, though. Grew up on the Res, but somehow didn't get stuck in the 1,000,000+ traps contributing to the IRL, horrific circle of poverty there. Tries to support her family with her Foundation paycheck. Not really fleshed-out in my head though. **Appears in:** SCP-2473
* **[[[when it's too late to go back|The only way left to go is forward]]]:**
 * **Ophelia:**
  * No last name for her. Lives in a post-veil world several centuries after the events of Person of Interest File #2273/01 on a Martian colony. Foundation employee. Broke our semi-unnamed narrator's heart, but not on-purpose. Probably a nice lady, which is why it hurt so damn much for the narrator.
 * **"Freeman"/the Narrator:**
  * Semi-reborn version of Roderick Freeman from Aftermath. Started out as male in my head, has since become ambiguous. Clearly attracted to ladies, but not necessarily exclusively so. Has a nicotine addiction. Maybe puts too many eggs in one basket and has trouble bouncing back when all the eggs break.
 * **Quentin Storms:**
  * Another colonist. Narrator's supervisor. Big heart. Maybe lets the Narrator get away with too much shit. Earth-born, wants to go home, can't go home because every trip to Clean Slate Station is one-way. His grandpa seems like a cool dude.
* **[[[Alexei and the Walrus]]]:**
 * **The Announcer:**
  * Loud, booming voice. Gonna follow Alexei until the credits roll. Won't be the only one.
* **[[[Jefferson Submarine Hub]]]:**
 * A hub is a terrible place to introduce characters.

[[size smaller]]Maybe I'm being melodramatic, iunno.[[/size]]

So shit happens. That's a fact of life. To the best of my knowledge, no member of this community is immortal. Someday, every single one of us will log into the Big Server in the Sky. And beyond that, other, less-final-on-paper-but-equally-final-in-practice shit also happens. I might get frustrated with this community and hit the exit button on all my wikidot/SCP stuff for a final time. I could be involved in an incident that results in a permanent disability rendering me unable to use this site. Average human lifespan is 70~ish years; statistically, I've got about 50 left, and a lot of shit can (and will) go down in that time.

So this bit is so the wiki can know, beyond a doubt, my feelings on what to do when I join the Writer's Club in Hell.[[footnote]]I know for a fact that there's a seat reserved for me in Hell: it's called the Throne. \m/[[/footnote]] To that end, here's a bullet list of what to do if I disappear for more than six months without any sign of coming back or intention to return:[[footnote]]Please note that some community members have me on Facebook and otherwise communicate with me outside the community. If I die, it's likely one of them will learn about it fairly quickly and may possibly inform the community of this event.[[/footnote]]

* Anyone can pick up my drafts and use chunks or even the whole thing in their own works. Credit me, though.
* Anyone can use my characters if they credit me. I'd appreciate if you stuck close to my original intentions if you use them. If you're going to invert them in some form, either make it good artistic criticism of my stuff, or, barring that, at least have fun with it.
* Anyone can pick up my incomplete long-form projects and make them their own. Again, however, I'd like such a use of my words and ideas credited in some capacity. Lord knows this community deserves closure on all the incomplete shit I've written. I've explained the end-goals for all those long-form projects in various places. Ask around if you need guidance.
* If my extent works fall under deletion, any person who has demonstrated competence as a community author and general community member may rewrite. Please try to do better than I did in this happenstance.
* Patrick can have my pet snail, Gary. Make sure you feed him twice a day and show him plenty of love, Mr. Star.

This community is a big part of my life. I have no illusions about my importance to the world or even this community, but I'd like to think I've contributed positively to both. In the inevitable (but hopefully very far-off) event of my permanent departure from this community, I'd like for that positive contribution to stick and perhaps even grow. So maybe I'm being overly sentimental or something, but I think that, assuming anyone reads this list and acts accordingly, that goal will be fulfilled in some sense.

Here's looking at you, kids.

+ Headcanon!
[[tabview]]
[[tab Big MacCanon!]]

I talk about my headcanon way too much without solidly codifying it or ever actually really incorporating any of it into my work.

Here's to hoping I can change that by including this fun bit in my author page.

Here goes nothing...

[[collapsible show="A Brief History of the Multiverse" hide="-A Brief History of the Multiverse" hideLocation="both"]]

A certain someone who's opinion I generally value frequently comments on discussions of an Infinite Multiverse with the anecdote that "an infinite plane of oranges will never have any apples, even if it is truly infinite." My rebuttal is that the multiverse looks much more like an infinite bazaar (or other open market), with an infinite number of an infinite variety of everything imaginable. Oranges, apples, pomegranates, grapes, dragonfruits, kiwis (the fruit), kiwis (the bird), kiwis (the people), melons, cucumbers, sea cucumbers, and all manner of much more exotic things would all be available, in this metaphor. A side-effect of this "true" infinity and "truly infinite" variety is that literally all headcanons are valid, outside of certain parameters sort-of outlined below.

The Infinite Bazaar metaphor, however, is stupid and only describes one facet of the MacCanon take on the multiverse.

A more apt metaphor, for the MacCanon take on the Multiverse, would be an infinite plane of board games and of players, all of whom can be playing every game with every other player at once. Every game is a universe, every player is a God. Some universes are familiar, boring, normal. Others are exotic, illogical, fantastical. In some games, some gods work together in teams, alliances, against other gods and teams of gods. In others, they all fight each other tooth-and-nail. It all depends on how the particular game in question started.

This gaming session has no end and no beginning. As soon as one game ends, the board is cleared, the pieces are reset, and it starts all over. And no matter what happens in some parts of the plane of infinite board games, the whole thing is generally unaffected. There's nothing that can kill the entire plane, regardless of how hard some things will try.

Pieces (here generally meaning "people") can be moved from board to board, recycled, moved from game to game, can become autonomous of their original player, may not have an original player. Some accidentally help the players to win, some become players in their own right and ultimately win on their own.

But that autonomy doesn't matter, because their board will be reset, and the whole thing will start all over. And over. And over. Forever.
[[/collapsible]]

But all that is just a metaphor for how the multiverse works. Now apply the metaphor to actual universes and then realize that most universes are a little more complicated than board games and most people are more complicated than simple pieces in a board game, and you've probably got a pretty good handle on what it looks like.

Which brings us to what the players actually are...

[[collapsible show="Regarding Gods" hide="-Regarding Gods" hideLocation="both"]]
As has already been established, the MacCanon entities I'm calling "Gods" are the players in the board game metaphor above. However, there's a bit more to it than that.

A (MacCanon) God can best be defined as "Any being, entity, force, or phenomena displaying great supernatural power up to and including omnipotence and/or omniscience over anything greater than a singular human being, even if only in an extremely limited capacity." Something does not need to be sapient, sentient, or even alive to be considered a God. Gods are not immortal, they are not invincible, they are not even special (within any given universe).

To provide yourself with an alternative perspective on Gods, imagine for a moment the Force from the Star Wars universe. Now imagine that, instead of just granting the ability to physically alter the world or to detect tangible information about the world, it was more like looking into the Matrix and then being able to edit it. That's what "reality benders" and most Gods are able to do. Most Gods are basically reality benders with a respect for symbols (even if the symbols actually mean nothing). However, some Gods are more mechanical, predictable in nature, behaving like machines or wild animals, with established, observable patterns, patterns that can be rewritten or outright erased. And all Gods have a complicated set of rules that have to be followed, a sort of code of behavior they can't break even if they try, sort of like followers of the Force. Despite what Lovecraft would have you believe, Gods can be brought under scientific scrutiny, can be understood. It's just that the cognizant ones are wary of such scrutiny and avoid it if at all possible.

Something I've established in the forums before is the fact that Gods can be artificially created, or avatars of Gods forcefully manifested (either interpretation of the process is valid). Sometimes it's a happy accident (imagine if the Cargo Cults of certain isolated islands actually resulted in holy C-47s bringing gifts of K-Rations and Spam) or an intentional effort (the best example being my own interpretation of [[[SCP-610]]], which is that it's a half-finished attempt by [[[SCP-1000]]] to weaponize the not-Force, to create a God as a means of protection against other Gods. As will be discussed further down and in other tabs, this didn't go well.)

One facet of Gods that ought to be addressed while we're on the subject is their general demeanor. Gods are selfish, jealous, lonely, and oftentimes quite //hungry//, and Gods often find niches in whatever society they're influencing that they then carry for quite a while afterwards. So it is that some Gods persistently remain symbols of things like fertility, or war, or partying, or what-have-you; they basically find something they're good at and stick to it. But they're always looking to expand their borders, to increase their influence. Killing other Gods is not off the table, nor is killing "unfaithful subjects." A big no-no, however, is killing off //all// one's subjects, because then they'll have no source of adoration, of prayer, of //food//. And all from the most forgiving and merciful to the most petty and wrathful of Gods take that seriously, because at this point in history, they've all seen what happens when that lesson is ignored.

Overall, just imagine a motley crew from a Western animated show like //Futurama// or //South Park//; the dynamic between Gods never really changes and it's safe to say that things will go back to normal between them sooner rather than later, even as the world changes around them and even as they go through things that ought to make them change. They're all individuals, with personalities that may even be equated to human mindsets, it's just that they're the sorts who see no ethical problem with playing with the fates of millions, billions, even trillions of sapient lives at stake as though it were a friendly, no-risk poker night. We matter that little to (most of) them.
[[/collapsible]]

So where does that put people, then? Where do we fit into this nuthouse world with near-omnipotent entities vying for our souls like they were poker chips? Wellll....

[[collapsible show="Regarding Sapience" hide="-Regarding Sapience" hideLocation="both"]]
Looking at the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation Drake Equation] and giving... optimistic estimates in some variables says that there should be a lot of civilizations, a lot of sapient life in our galaxy.[[footnote]]I personally feel that, IRL, we're not alone in the universe, but there's not many others out there and there's a statistically high chance we'll never meet them.[[/footnote]]We all know that, in the Foundationverse, the solution to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox Fermi Paradox] is that either 1) the GOC keeps blowing evidence of alien civilization up, 2) the Foundation effectively covers it up, or 3) some sort of combination thereof.[[footnote]]My IRL belief is, again, that there's other sorts of people out there, but a large number of factors have made our chances of encountering them statistically small.[[/footnote]]

What I'm getting at here is that sapient life has evolved in most iterations of the Foundationverse a //lot//, including multiple times on Earth. And Gods are partially responsible. Sometimes they'll take a proto-sapience under their wing and elevate it, other times they make sapiences entirely on accident, and sometimes, sapiences come into existence without anyone around to make it happen at all. And, because the saturation of sapience throughout the cosmos, civilization is also a fairly common occurrence.

Because Gods are fickle and treat the whole of creation as their plaything, what we call "anomalies" in our own little writing community are //also// fairly common. Most species smart enough to catch onto this do so, and make a point of trying to protect their own from the Things That Should Not Be. Some do this the GOC way (blowing it up), some do it the Foundation way (contain it, keep it away from people, poke it with SCIENCE! until it's fully understood, let people take advantage of it), and some do it the Serpent's Hand/token eldritch cult way (treat it with a lotta respect, do what can be done with it to make it work for them). All three methods are valid, and the level of secrecy a species applies to anomalies are essentially determined by its own scientific/academic community. All "anomalies" can be explained scientifically (seriously, look at the history of IRL science; so much weird shit we didn't understand that now makes total sense because we had the sense of mind to study, measure, take notes, try different things. Our Foundation deals with things just a //little// more difficult than, say, Mendeleev's table of chemicals or Gregor Mendel's flowers). All the Foundation has to do is keep studying, keep trying, keep working. They'll get where they want and need to be eventually, as will all other equivalent organizations all across the multiverse.
[[/collapsible]]

Basically, what I'm saying is, the Foundationverse is much scarier than our reality, but also much more hopeful.
[[/tab]]
[[tab Li'l MacCanon]]
So, that brings us to the locale I have decided to set all of my skips in, the place that entities such as [[[SCP-2273]]] and [[[scp-2367|Otto Weber]]] call home.

It's not a very nice place, to be entirely honest.

[[collapsible show="A Brief (Pre-Human) History of MacCanon 'Baseline'" hide="-A Brief (Pre-Human) History of Li'l MacCanon 'Baseline'" hideLocation="both"]]

First things first, allow me to establish that there //is not// a "MacCanon Baseline;" if the last tab didn't clue you into the fact that all universes are equally valid, that //everything// is canon, then allow me to clarify that: THERE IS NO MACCANON BASELINE.

*ahem* Glad that that's outta the way. Now we can move onto the corner of the multiverse my skips generally call home.

History of the universe and solar system and planet Earth and humanity all basically went the way history books taught. If one of us, one of the members of the SCP community, fell outta reality and into the MacCanon, we probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference, 'cept //maybe// the SCP wiki wouldn't exist and earnest googling attempts at finding an off-brand X-Files website would result in amnestics for this hypothetical community member.[[footnote]]I honestly can't decide whether or not this wiki exists in the MacCanon. On the one hand, it's probably great disinformation. On the other, the Foundation might be paranoid enough about info leaks that a silly collaborative writing project would be liable for shutdown.[[/footnote]]

The big differences between MacCanon and reality come from, well, Gods. Basically, civilization has evolved on this planet multiple times, and has gone extinct or taken leave of this ball o' dirt every single preceding time. As to how civilizations can go extinct with Gods around to help, allow me to quote Friedrich Schiller; "Against stupidity, the gods themselves contend in vain." Doesn't matter how many toys she makes, Wondertainment can't stop Kennedy from pressing the Big Red Button and ending the Cuban Missile Crisis with a BANG! Likewise with [[[SCP-2735]]] and company.

[[/collapsible]]

There's two exceptions to the exodus-or-bust rule. One is [[[SCP-1000]]], and the other is [[[SCP-2636]]]'s people. I haven't really put much thought into how the Last Daughter's people fit into this part, so I'll address that later. As for the Children of the Night, though...

[[collapsible show="A Brief History of MacCanon Humanity" hide="-A Brief History of MacCanon humanity" hideLocation="both"]]
Human evolutionary history went just about how archaeologists say it did (short version being that 5-10 million years ago, apes started walking upright on the plains of Africa, eventually those apes learned to use fire, now we're here), 'cept the whole "discovering fire" bit was a God, who may have kinda done it on accident. This God became an avatar of human creativity, and has since persisted in some form or another, with connotations generally indicating this God to be a "Wonder Maker." The other Gods weren't happy with the unintentional creation of a large number of sapients, and they punished the Wonder-Maker for it. Humanity collectively remembered this series of events, and this is where the story of Coyote or Prometheus or Mātariśvan or Azha or what-have-you stealing fire came from.

Not too long after pre-humans discovered fire, we split into a few separate groups, the two most successful of those groups being the Children of the Night and the Children of the Sun.

The Children of the Night had some sort of a headstart. I can't say what. Maybe there were just a few more of them than Children of the Sun at the onset. Maybe it was the nocturnal thing, letting them learn about the world humans feared while humans slept. What matters is, they conquered agriculture before modern humans had even got 'round to leaving the safety of their nighttime cave fires. This lead to them learning about metallurgy and chemistry and everything else that eventually made the modern world something like 150,000 years ago. Then they discovered what we now call "biotech," and they had the foresight to develop it to the sort of levels generally seen in depictions of SCP-1000. All of this in maybe 15,000 years. They found themselves a Goddess who acted as a sort of passive protector; they cared far more about her than she cared about them.

But something gained her attention elsewhere and she left, leaving the Children of the Night desperate. They began work on a God not unlike their beloved protector while the metaphorical wolves found the way to their door. The Children of the Night did all they could to build a replacement for their lost Goddess, but they weren't fast enough. They'd been a thorn in the side of the Gods for only a fleeting moment, but a fleeting moment is all it takes. A God who'd garnered a reputation among the Children of the Day as a trickster taught humans how to fight the Children of the Night with their own weapons, leading to the event called the "Day of Flowers" or the "Bloom." The corrupt, trickster God saw glory in all the bloodshed, and called himself the King of the Children of the Day. His armies marched north, and burned everything in their path, eventually settling in Siberia, enslaving the infant, mindless, animal God the Children of the Night had built.

Right around this time, the Wonder-Maker was released from punishment and did what they could do to help rebuild. The Children of the Day still remembered them, still trusted them, even as many were corrupted in the far north. So it was that, in a place between two rivers, humans began to build wonders to rival those built by the ones they'd burned. They built a Library (or perhaps had found a Way to that Library), and they began to build machines, industry. One of these machines, a clockwork calculator, helped them learn to govern themselves, helped them learn to protect themselves, helped them organize themselves. Eventually, they began to think of this machine as a Goddess. Whether it took on that mantle for itself before or after humans gave it that attribute is up for interpretation.

The Red King, to the north, began to see this and grew, well, jealous, angry. He organized his armies, and he marched south to destroy them.

This war lasted decades, and it was the greatest period of bloodshed since the Day of Flowers. Towers crumbled, armies perished, Gods were forced to pick sides, those sides were shattered. Some of the big "old" players in the Foundationverse came out of this conflict; the Factory, the epitome of human greed, the avatar of corrupt human ambition, forged weapons for the Machine Goddess's armies, while [[[scp-089|Moloch]]] and his ilk helped to keep the Red King's army in-line, helped to bring forward more armies to the front, helped to keep the Red King's throne secure. While the Daeva tried to bring about an end to the people of the Library, a lowly slave by the name of Ion rose to the status of Godhood, several following in his wake.

Basically, the whole world was a clusterfuck.

As the dust began to settle, the followers of the Machine Goddess built arks, tried to make getaways. This is where [[[SCP-1795]]] came from; followers of the Machine Goddess left for the stars, but, in the process, brought the attention of... other... //things// with them. They went further than humans ever had on Earth, further than humans may ever go, but... Well, you know what they say: the higher you rise, the harder you fall. And as they rose, they left their home so far behind them they forgot it, and they fell in places very, very far from home. 1795 is their legacy, a terrifying mark on the cosmos that the Foundation will never understand, even if, eventually, they'll learn to control it.

But back on Earth, the war still raged, and, eventually, a man who'd been betrayed by his own brother turned on his new masters, the Red King fell and his armies never regained their old composure. As they dwindled, they took most of the Wonders and Horrors that had come out of the world with them. The Machine Goddess was Broken, the Ways to the Library burned, and humanity found itself further behind than it had started.

But some remembered, some continued to stand in the Dark so others could live in the Light, and, eventually, humanity rebuilt, leading to history as we know it. The time between the Fall and the Rebuilding was, as mentioned earlier, around 150,000 years. But the Rebuilding happened, as the Empire was built and eventually fell on faraway stars.
[[/collapsible]]

Which brings us to... Well, let's call the European Renaissance a fair start.

[[collapsible show="Setting the Stage: Modern History I" hide="-Setting the Stage: Modern History I" hideLocation="both"]]
As people began to rediscover all that had been lost, as Europe began to reorganize and come back into its own, and even before then, groups of intellectuals began to study, began to develop what we know of as the modern Scientific Method. And, as they did this, they studied old knowledge, knowledge that had been preserved but not investigated by old monasteries, knowledge that had been preserved (and in some cases, studied extensively) in places to the east and south, where the fall of Rome had only been an opportunity to rise. People in Europe began to organize themselves to study the things that go bump in the night, eventually giving rise to institutes that would lay the (pardon the pun) foundation of the GOC, the Foundation, and several of their contemporaries. Some equivalent institutes in China, Korea, Japan, and elsewhere were likewise coming into their own as the world began to take the shape we know today.

Eventually, governments began seizing control of these organizations, making them secret arms and branches, leading to the "anomalies stay secret" //modus operandi// of the Foundation we know today. And, as the world was being colonized by Europeans, the occult traveled with them. Australia, India, Africa, the Americas, everywhere Europeans went with colonization in mind, they brought with them occultists and scientists with an occult bent, some of whom adopted local practices, some of whom brought old practices with them, all of whom got the ideas that were proliferating in Europe and made them global. The idea that the strange, the unexplained, should be kept out of public eye is an idea born in Europe and spread through European colonialism. The Foundation and the GOC working to maintain the secrecy of anomalies is just the natural evolution of fear of witch-hunts (which is somewhat ironic, because the Foundation is arguably //carrying out// the witch-hunts now).

One thing that hasn't really been touched on here yet is, as Europeans rediscovered and expanded on old knowledge, as the world simultaneously became a bigger place and a smaller one, the Ways to the Library were rediscovered. The fear of witch-hunts enforced secrecy with the Foundation's precursors, and it enforced secrecy within Wanderers who found the Library as well. The sum of existence, and all information therein, was available, for those who could understand it and those who were willing to make the sacrifices necessary to apply it. This helped to accelerate the proliferation of esoteric knowledge, even if finding the Library is beyond the scope of the average occultist.

So as Europeans began desperately seeking their plot of land, their part of history in their nations' respective efforts to divvy up the planet, the world was quietly waking back up to the reality that had been cleverly disguised by a couple dying Gods. Academics of the strange remained background noise, esoteric hobbyists with no real impact, for quite a while, but mundane politics eventually lead to significant parts of the world rejecting their status as colonies and taking the responsibility of government entirely into their own hands.

In the United States, independence from Great Britain (was it called the UK by that point in time? I don't know much British history.) directly lead to the formation of the American Secure Containment Initiative, the first organization, globally, of its type. Their job was essentially to route out the unexplainable anywhere along the western frontier and make sure only silly rumors would get to the average westward-bound American.[[footnote]]There really needs to be a better word for "People from the US" than the generic "American." I find it very inconvenient.[[/footnote]] As one might guess, this lead to a notably large amount of conflict with Native Americans. Proportionately more than the regular Army, even. Part of the US's officially-sanctioned treatment of Native Americans came out of an irrational fear of them being, well, evil wizards or some shit. Most of it was unfounded and the parts that weren't unfounded were misinterpretations that, combined with the (non)sensibilities of the day, allowed the US government to rationalize sanctioning the ASCI's actions.

Meanwhile, Napolean Bonaparte's France and the period that followed saw the foundation (that pun was intended) of the //Institut du Fantastique//,[[footnote]]If a French supernatural organization existed at this point in time that can replace/supplement this part, please let me know.[[/footnote]] a sort of French GRU-P precursor. Their entire job was to identify, locate, study, and replicate the odd, the macabre, the inexplicable. They found secrecy to be conducive to their efforts (for a lot of reasons) and so adopted a similar MO to their contemporaries in the States. Many of them were explorers, the sort of thing you'd expect from a Penny Dreadful or other contemporary adventure story; the //Institut// continued to function in France and her colonies through the 19^^th^^ Century and played a small part in the opening act of the 20^^th^^.

Between the Japanese Onmyo Bureau, the ASCI, and the IF (lol hadn't even seen that pun), Great Britain felt itself falling behind in the field of "study weird shit and either destroy it or make use of it" by the middle of the 19^^th^^ Century, and so established His (or "Her," as might apply) Majesty's Foundation for the Study and Capture of the Phantasmagorical. As with the IF, the sort of people who found themselves in the HMFSCP were exactly what you'd expect from an adventure novel. Their primary function was much like the IF's: study the world's scientific oddities and document them for the Crown, putting to use anything remotely useful or understandable. [[[scp-1867|A certain gentleman]]] may have found himself in their service for a short time before his current circumstances came about. Of note is that they changed the name shortly after their inception to His Majesty's Foundation for the Secure Containment of the Preternatural (they liked the initials, just not the name itself). HMFSCP agents found themselves operating in all capacities, from advisers to the Crown and Parliament to scientists at well-regarded universities to the sort of adventurer-gentlemen we picture when talking about old-school adventure novels. After the merger, the Foundation's historians would spend a solid portion of the next century and a half just trying to sort out which HMFSCP stories were true and which were just self-aggrandizing fictions (a surprisingly large number were not fictitious).

The Tsar's Seers were another contemporary group in the "try to understand magic" category; their role was much like the IRL Onmyo Bureau's: study the stars/do other hokey shit in order to try to ascertain the future. They made calendars for the Romanov family and otherwise did everything they could to make the Tsar and his family believe in mystical mumbo-jumbo. They had a few //real// tricks up their sleeves, and some within their ranks were more qualified and knew more than others, but they were a small group and //heavily// persecuted during the Bolshevik Revolution. The fact that any of them survived at all is nothing short of a miracle (or perhaps just magical). It didn't help that some jerk by the name of Grigori Rasputin usurped their monopoly on the royal family shortly before everything went all hammer-and-sickle shaped.
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="The Great War and what followed: Modern History II" hide="-The Great War and what followed: Modern History II" hideLocation="both"]]

Which brings us to what I've been hinting at: WWI. The trenches in France, Belgium, and Germany were the ultimate proving ground for what everyone had spent the last century rediscovering and improving upon. In a place where a man could drown on dry land; a place where men flew (but only so artillery could be aimed and bombs dropped upon their fellow men); a place where a hundred thousand men sent to their graves in a single day was nothing especially horrific; where, if the artillery and machine-guns didn't kill you, the trench-foot or the rats probably would; in a place that was, for all intents and purposes the literal Gates of Hell, actual wizards fighting each other would almost seem commonplace. However, essentially by unspoken agreement, no participants on either side resorted to direct, obvious utilization of the occult. Most of the academics spent their time in the war improving conventional weapons, while the muscle expended themselves trying to fight those conventional weapons. [[[scp-186|There were exceptions, though.]]] And some nations felt a strong enough urge to maintain secrecy that they felt inclined to [[[when one reaches the end|clean up messes left behind by others]]].

When the last gunshot rung out, when Europe was no longer in flames and the Bolsheviks had reached a state of cannibalization instead of focusing on the old regime, the men who had stood in places where no man ought to stand and had seen things not meant for mortal eyes began to come together, agreeing to operate with funding from their former governing nations but no longer operating under their orders. The Foundation as we know it was born, and with it came a new, more humanitarian mission: To Secure that which threatens all of mankind, to Contain knowledge of the anomalous from the public, and to Protect humanity's best interests, both long- and short-term. They would stand in the dark, so that others might live in the light. 

However, the noble ideas that so bound them would also tear them apart; between the horrors of the Great War, the unending Communist Revolution in Russia, and the hopelessness of the Depression starting in 1929, the Foundation's personnel had seen a great deal of mundane misery in their time. By 1933, a large number of them had to ask themselves why they weren't using the Foundation's wonders to help the many; untold riches could be produced. The literal and metaphorical blights falling upon the people living in much of the then-developed world could be solved, at the seemingly low cost of allowing people to remember that there are Gods and Demons in their midst, at the cost of letting people choose to know what had for the longest time been deemed unspeakable.

The Foundation was cracked at its core. There was no consensus, no agreement on what the Foundation's role would be in the new world. Sometime in 1933, there was a schism, with a majority of personnel remaining faithful to the ideology of containment and a small fraction leaving to become a New Foundation. They were under-equipped, understaffed, self-funded, and wanted nothing more than, well, to introduce Chaos into the Foundation's cold, clinical world. They wanted to let people know the truth, and let them benefit. However, because of their status as outcasts in a world where even mentioning the bumps-in-the-night with any seriousness could find you a place in a containment cell, they had to act as an Insurgency.

They kept the name purely out of spite for their progenitors.

As this went on, the Foundation's operations in Germany were interrupted by an extreme reformist political party that had come to power and, by 1936, had seized the Foundation's assets within the country. Many of the Foundation's wards and assets had to be relocated to Switzerland, close to the semi-official headquarters of the organization. Operations in Italy and Japan were likewise interrupted; the Ahnenerbe SS and their contemporaries (such as the IJAMEA) cut all diplomacy to the Foundation much the same way their respective governments tried to cut ties to the West, to the United States and Great Britain and their allies. The Foundation and the Soviets would never have a good working relationship, and the formation of GRU Division P in 1931 pretty much solidified that. 

Needless to say, the '30s were a dark time for the Foundation; everything they'd fought so hard for in the previous decade seemed to be falling apart. Governments on all sides of the impending conflict were breaking their (semi-unofficial) contracts with the Foundation in an effort to get a discreet, anomalous edge on their opposition. By 1939, the Foundation seemed to be on its last legs, which brings us to the conflict commonly known as...
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="World War II: Modern History III" hide="-World War II: Modern History III" hideLocation="both"]]
World War II was a global conflict with a poorly-defined beginning and end. Several conflicts resulting from the war in Europe and sociopolitical developments that followed shortly after could be argued to be part of the greater conflict. I'm not a historian, I can't make effective arguments regarding this, I'm just presenting to you, my readers, the world my stories generally take place in. With the obligatory disclaimer out of the way, let's get to it.

One common depiction of the Library is that of a sanctuary for knowledge and those who would protect it. In the years of German aggression in Europe and Japanese aggression in Asia and Oceania (and the counter-aggression incurred against them), the MacCanon version of the Library absolutely acted in such a role. Persecuted artists and intellectuals who could escape through the Library did so, including some who still live there or whose descendants still live there today. And many who resisted the various aggressing parties also sought rallying points there. I feel that the Library is a place where outright weapons are not permitted, but certain knowledge in the hands of capable individuals is absolutely a weapon, and distribution of knowledge is what libraries were meant for, after all. So artists and occultists and rebels gathered there, and planned their resistances there, and dealt the rest of the world a great deal of damage from there. IJAMEA; GRU-P; the OSS Branch X-3 (Esoteric Warfare); //Le Ministère des Affaires Profanes//; and Directorate of Military Intelligence, Section 18 all had some level of knowledge of the existence of the Library, but were never able to successfully make their way within.

The Foundation has never been able enter the Library, but part of that is because they were ignorant of its existence until the 1950s. During WWII, they were entirely focused on infiltrating every major government and every major anomalous research organization. As the Germans rolled through Paris, //Le Ministère des Affaires Profanes// essentially split apart, partially being absorbed by the Ahnenerbe SS, partially being absorbed by the Foundation, and partially remaining independent as part of the French Resistance for the duration of the war. GRU Division P spent the entire war attempting to directly counteract the Ahnenerbe SS, the Ahnenerbe SS spent the entire war barking up trees and never accomplishing anything effective (partially as a result of Operations Hammer and Anvil, which will be elaborated on in the next paragraph), and the IJAMEA spent the entire war trying to secure more funding while the regular Imperial Japanese Army marched through pretty much every territory and country adjacent to Japan. The Office of Strategic Services, Branch X-3 had more Foundation personnel than uncorrupted personnel, thoroughly sabotaging their ability to successfully create weapons and then use them; the US government's development of nuclear weapons without Foundation intervention can either be interpreted as a major failure on the Foundation's part and a demonstration of their fallibility, or as an intentional oversight on the Foundation's part because they preferred to see the Japanese Empire and Third Reich destroyed. The British Directorate of Military Intelligence, Section 18 focused more on infiltration and surveillance than on experimentation, meaning they cooperated with the Foundation on a deep and fundamental level without even being aware of it.

I haven't thought out the full implications of the Foundation's infiltration of world governments during the war, but one aspect I can elaborate on and intend to write into Tales is Operation Anvil. Operation Anvil is a closed-fixed temporal loop wherein Foundation operatives use SCP-2367 following Event 2367 Sigma to infiltrate themselves into 1943 Germany. They arrive with SS uniforms, complete relevant documentation, and the capability and desire to destroy every piece of anomalous hardware the Germans are preparing to field. They're basically the Inglorious Basterds. And every single one of them is killed violently during their sabotage efforts on Der Riese, also known as "Entity KOLOSS," also known as the Landkreuzer P. 1500 Monster, also known as the Behemoth. They get the job done, but at the cost of their lives. And the field commander of Operation Hammer can only watch on. He later becomes an Overseer and is forced to send those men to their deaths a second time.

But that's jumping the gun a bit. As for the rest of the global theater, the Foundation simply used their infiltrators to carry out clean-up wherever they could in order to prevent defeated armies from leaving behind anomalous weapons for victorious armies to utilize or for civilians to be affected by.

[[collapsible show="The Cold War: Modern History IV" hide="-The Cold War: Modern History IV" hideLocation="both"]]
The Holocaust, the invention of the nuclear bomb and other technologies such as early computers and jet engines and rockets, the horrors of war as they were inflicted upon hundreds of millions of people, and the sociopolitical landscape as it appeared in the years following the Second World War undoubtedly, objectively changed normalcy for the human race. I don't think this can be denied. The Foundation wasn't happy about that, but their choice was between the world knowing the power of the Atom and the power of the unspeakable, screaming monstrosities hiding in plain sight. They took the least disturbing option.

The infiltration of GRU-P during the War was never completely effective because of geographic isolation, and following the start of the Cold War and the arms race and the space race, it became even more difficult. Likewise, the founding of the Global Occult Coalition from repentant members of the Ahnenerbe SS and the surviving members of //Le Ministère des Affaires Profanes//[[footnote]]A successor to the //Institut//[[/footnote]], along with several dozen smaller groups, complicated Foundation affairs in Europe to a frustrating degree. US military expansion into Japan and Germany helped, but Uncle Sam is an imperfect and limited cover story. The Foundation became too reliant on it and, upon later discovering anomalous weapons fairly well-proliferated in Vietnam following the end of US involvement there, the Foundation was forced to reconsider its methodology. Likewise, Mossad agents discovering escaped Ahnenerbe operatives in the 1970s forced the Foundation to realize the full extent of their fallibility, which directly lead to their current dependence on front companies for both funds and other resources, which lead to a further dependence on capitalism, leading to some degree of disconnection with China, even as Tricky Dick reopened those avenues for Americans. As nuclear war seemed more and more imminent, the Foundation redoubled its efforts to ensure Weird Science wouldn't find its way onto the battlefield, or into the lives of normal civilians. When the Wall broke and the Iron Curtain fell, the Foundation was quick to try to gain the same level of control in former Soviet Bloc countries.

But that only covers the Foundation. The Library's human membership during the Cold War years grew immensely, as pretty much every intellectual either tried to gain some sort of edge for "their" side, tried to learn new techniques for art to express their opinions of the whole fiasco (or simply life in general), or tried to abandon Earth like rats on a sinking ship. Many of these persons began to take notice of the so-called Jailors and began to form a half-baked insurgency against them, naming themselves after the legendary but rarely-seen Head Librarian. He, the Serpent who gifted Humanity with Knowledge, now had a Hand in the mortal world. The Serpent himself thinks the whole thing is silly, but doesn't bother doing anything to change it because they generally don't hurt anyone and tend to bring their books back on time and in good condition.

Fifthism is worthless space hippies, I won't talk about them except to say they'll probably be the unlikely Last People Standing when the Shit Goes Down.

Are We Cool Yet? is an ill-defined art movement with origins in the anart scene in the 1960s. They're not cool they will never be cool.

GRU-P played various roles throughout the Cold War, ranging from espionage to scientific exploration to weapons development. They suffered the same shortfalls as the Ahnenerbe SS; namely, their government expected more from them than that same government was willing to pay for. The Foundation had trouble infiltrating their ranks for a very long time, and by the time the Soviet Union fell, there was no point.

The Chaos Insurgency adopted the semi-public monikers of "Manna Charitable Foundation" and "Marshall, Carter, and Dark" in the 1950s. Their wealthier members founded Prometheus Laboratories in the mid-1960s. Actual, militant attacks against the Foundation were and continue to be rare. They take advantage of sociopolitical conditions when they can, and were basically the Foundation's go-to scapegoats for anything bad that happened to a Site, ever.

The Global Occult Coalition has been on the rise ever since their inception. They were approached by the Foundation in the 1950s and have been in an uneasy truce with them ever since. They continue to absorb minor occult organizations. They generally police Europe and other UN-friendly regions for anomalies, killing off the ones the Foundation can't kill or be bothered to contain. This has been their role for the last 60 years and they'll continue at it until the Foundation can't keep them on a leash anymore.

The Church of the Broken God is not so much an organization as it is a pervasive idea -- the idea that Humanity has reached apotheosis before and must learn to do so again. Pretty much every religion has some sort of Ur-state, the default setting of humanity, a place wherein we are at peace and literally or figuratively one with God. The Church of the Broken God is essentially taking that idea to a specific, esoteric conclusion: God is a machine that has been built before and can be reconstructed. The Foundation's attempts to classify it as sub-organizations are futile, because, at our very hearts, we all belong to the Church.

The Church as it exists now has its origins in the Great Depression and Spanish Civil War, when a tinkerer named Robert Bumaro discovered certain documentation and had what can best be described as a religious epiphany. He did his best to go off the grid and share his revelations with anyone who would listen. His ideas have proliferated and evolved, as old cults who still half-remembered the Machine Goddess stepped forward and joined his movement, with several pieces of the Machine Goddess and other artifacts coming to light in the intervening decades. They did their best to stay out of the limelight during the Cold War, instead seeking shelter from the Jailors and Book Burners and attempting to rebuild their Goddess in isolation. The computer revolution only accelerated their efforts.

The Unusual Incidents Unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is only one of several anomalous-investigation agencies. It was formed in the 1950s to help investigate increasing reports of unexplained phenomena. However, the Foundation pretty much immediately used its contacts within the FBI and US government to sabotage the UIU at its core. Now, it's basically a branch of the Foundation, and any agents that uncover the conspiracy-within-a-conspiracy are either amnesticized or let in on the Foundation's fun.

Sarkicism is well-covered outside of my author page, I won't elaborate further on it except to say that they're not //all// baddies.

I don't know enough about Iran's history to properly cover ORIA, but I do like the stuff involving ORIA that I've read before. Same for Catholicism and the Horizon Initiative.

The Factory hasn't been covered anywhere besides much earlier in the timeline, so a brief overview of their last century and a half of activity is as follows: they're not a true company/organization, and are instead the metaphysical manifestation of human ambition and greed. Since a lot of that has been a driving force for the last century and a half, especially in capital-driven parts of the globe, they've been finding ways to put their fingers into a lot of pies. The Foundation's adoption of front companies for funding in the 1970s could arguably mean that the Foundation is going all "Hail Hydra" without even realizing it. Likewise for militaries and other such organizations that depend on capitalist economies for their continued existence.

Doctor Wondertainment will be elaborated on further elsewhere in this author page, but I will say that there was a relatively recent falling-out between them and the Factory.

Anderson Robotics isn't my thing, I don't think I can do them justice. See Sarkicism, above. Also, seriously, fuck Anderson. Fuck that guy. With a baseball bat. That has rusty nails on it.

Alexylva has no part in the MacCanon. They're busy infiltrating other branches of the Foundationverse.
[[/collapsible]]
[[collapsible show="The Current State of Things: Modern History V" hide="-The Current State of Things: Modern History V"]]
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Foundation did everything it could to prevent GRU-P projects from falling into more predatory hands, such as the CI, SH, or various new and extant governments. They did a good but imperfect job. And having former Soviet nations open resulted in further expansion into other territories that had also been mostly-off-limits, such as China. But it also opened markets for anomalous capitalists; expansion into Russia essentially set Prometheus Labs into a spiral of mismanagement in the effort to reach new markets, resulting in their fall into irrelevancy. MC&D is more than happy to serve Russia's newfound upper-class elite. The Factory found new and interesting avenues into the newly-capitalist economies.

And, without fear of Soviet intervention, American trade and military expansion became far less stifled, allowing the Foundation to follow Uncle Sam into places that had previously been off-limits. More than a few skips that had been teetering towards ORIA recovery ended up in Foundation hands during Desert Storm, and more than a few contacts in Iraq were established by that operation-within-an-operation.

As someone born in 1995, I don't really remember much of the '90s, but I will say that the Foundation took advantage of every stupid and crazy thing that happened, just as they've done since the '20s.

In 2001-2003, the Foundation faced another crisis, one caused by more than a few formerly-US-aligned personnel wanting to jump ship and run back to Uncle Sam's aid. They were able to get a handle on it, and have since used the surge of US-and-other-NATO recruits to bolster their own armed and other former-military personnel. They're currently behind the curve on the internet's impact on information suppression and its ability to spread infohazardous phenomena, which is ironic because they played a huge part in the development of computer networking and the world-wide web. They're catching up, but their rivals and anomalies in general have a headstart.

The Church of the Broken God, especially "Maxwellian" and true Maxwellian sects, is growing in membership rapidly, as a result of the proliferation of communication technology the world over. A growing movement is Christian Reconstructionism, which is the belief that Christ will return with the Technological Singularity or the reconstruction of Mekhane. Christian Reconstructionists range from conservative Catholic and Orthodox sects to nondenominational congregations. Equivalent movements in other religions exist but aren't as widespread as Christian Reconstructionism.

If the multiverse is an infinite plain of board game players, the Library is a compendium of all the rulebooks. Kind of a tough place to wrap your mind around if you're just a lowly game piece, but absolutely the sort of place to start if you're a Pawn looking to become a Queen. The Library has a full history of every reality that's ever existed, or ever will exist. Taking advantage of that knowledge simply takes patience and the foreknowledge of how, precisely, to find what you're looking for. Things are somewhat expedited by the fact that it is literally impossible to interact with a copy of yourself there unless their reality is so different from yours as to make them truly separate people. Which means that wiser versions of individuals often enlighten their less-wise counterparts without generating severe paradoxes or otherwise breaking causality. The Serpent and all other Librarians carry on their duty of taking care of the place faithfully, while the Hand continue to be good patrons but utterly useless.

The Global Occult Coalition is gaining more agency than the Foundation would like, and it may come to literal or metaphorical blows between the two organizations sooner rather than later. For now, though, they help the Foundation neutralize anomalies deemed not worth containment. Their increasing interest in paratechnology and utilization of anomalies is a source of some distress for the Foundation.

More concerning than its allies or minor cults that worship a dead God, however, are Fifthists, Sarkicists, and Daevites. Fifthists generally actively seek high levels of exposure (either out of ignorance of the Veil the Foundation has established, or out of spite for it). Their true God is... something the Foundation knows nothing about and wouldn't actually like to. If the Church of the Broken God worships a dead God, the Fifthists worship a Blind Idiot God. And that isn't something the Foundation likes to think about.

Likewise, Sarkicists are becoming bolder in their promotion of their faith or their attempts at apotheosis (whichever applies to the cult in question). Their numbers are dwindling, partially as a result of GOC/Foundation efforts and partially as a result of changing times simply forcing them to abandon their faith, but those who remain are far more steadfast, far more extreme and devout in their beliefs, and far less concerned with secrecy or modesty. Because of research into paratech that the Foundation doesn't like to admit to itself, Sarkicism doesn't represent a legitimate threat to continued human existence, but they do represent a growing threat to normalcy.

The greatest concern, however, is the Daevites. Quite simply, for a civilization that's been dead for ten or more millennia, they're distressingly active in modern times. From the cult responsible for [[[SCP-231]]] to other, more subtle disruptions to the status quo, Daevites are quite obviously making a comeback, and because containment of [[[SCP-140]]] hasn't been breached, the Foundation isn't sure what to make of it. Likewise, the Library has never, ever, //ever// allowed Daevites within their halls, yet tomes relating to them are disappearing (not that it matters when your library is literally infinite and therefore has an infinite number of copies, but that's besides the point; it's the //principal// of the thing) and there's talk of Daevites among those who travel the Ways. The Serpent's Hand is becoming less concerned with the Jailors and Book Burners and more concerned with those who would do far worse than jail or burn. The Scarlet King, the Crimson Crown, has never been anything but bad news, and His return is far from what anyone wants. The Scarlet King is the unifier in all of the Foundationverse; no one wants him around, and everyone will cooperate to keep him dead.

The Foundation is walking on the edge of a knife, and the normalcy they fight so hard for may need to be sacrificed in order to protect the people that normalcy is preserved for.

[[collapsible show="Organizations" hide="-Organizations" hideLocation="both"]]

+++ __The Foundation:__

The Foundation is the largest paranormal research organization on the planet, both in manpower and resources. They are lead by a council of 13 individuals (two selected from each inhabited continent plus a 13^^th^^ "Administrator" elected from within their ranks). These individuals range in background from "Junior Researcher who was selected by an automated process even the Overseers don't understand" to "Agent whose life has accidentally been prolonged by anomaly exposure who has important insights to Foundation operations." Their bodyguards/protective measures are nonexistent, simply because their identities are that well-concealed. Cover stories range from budget auditors to Ethics Committee representatives to Junior Researchers. They hide in plain sight and make administrative decisions from wherever they've been sent by their own organization. They have headquarters in Switzerland, but those are primarily unused by the O5s and are instead a meeting-place for Site Directors and the Ethics Committee.

The Ethics Committee, RAISA, Office for Resource Management (or whatever I decide to call it), Site Directors, and Overseers are constantly butting heads over resource utilization and budgetary concerns. It's usually the Ethics Committee and Resource Management who come out on top, with RAISA throwing a fit about OPSEC constantly, Site Directors worrying about their own personnel constantly, and the O5s trying to make them all get along. It's a bureaucratic nightmare, and the fact that the Foundation is able to function at all in spite of it is nothing short of a miracle.

+++ __The Library:__

The Library is an extra-universal institution with doorways to a massive number of reality constructs. It's a place of higher learning, lower learning, and every other sort of learning. If you play by the rules, it's a great place to be. Most iterations of the Foundation are barred from entering, and those iterations that aren't barred are barred from communicating with those who are. Daevites are likewise barred, as are most iterations of the SPC. The Library has no real, identifiable origins; if it even //has// origins, the Head Librarian would be the one who knows about it and he ain't talking.

The Library acts as a sort of headquarters for a minor insurgency that claims to be acting on behalf of the Head Librarian, even calling themselves his "Hand." He wants nothing to do with it; he's had his fill of violence. They usually bring their books back on time and pay the late fees when they don't, so he doesn't bother telling them to stop.

+++ __The Chaos Insurgency:__

The Chaos Insurgency is not the Chaos Insurgency. "The Chaos Insurgency" is a name that some people early in its history used because they were literal anarchists and felt that the name was fitting. The organization doesn't make a point of telling the Foundation to quit calling them that because it's a source of minor amusement and a major internal security advantage to them. The real name they prefer to go by, when they need to go by a name, is "The Final Collective," or, more simply/less ominously, "The Collective." They are a loose assortment of economically-right-leaning individuals, with means, methods, and ideas varying wildly.

The leadership of Marshall, Carter, and Dark are members/financial supporters, as were the owners of Prometheus Labs, Inc. The Manna Charitable Foundation is their largest public front and the largest source of information on the effects of anomalies on large populations. The actual, militant "insurgency" is mostly made up of individuals who defected from organizations like the Foundation, the GOC, and various minor organizations with connections behind the Veil. The end goal of this ungodly collective is the public reveal of anomalies; they want the Foundation, GOC, and their collaborators to give up the ghost and allow people to do as they choose regarding the inexplicable and unknowable.

Imagine your cousin who posts anti-government conspiracy theories to Facebook and/or Twitter incessantly but otherwise seems normal. Now imagine that they're registered to the Libertarian Party and the most exotic of their conspiracy theories are true. Now take it one more step and imagine that they're actually actively working to shut the conspiracies down and not just wearing tinfoil hats in their basements. You just successfully imagined a typical member of the Chaos Insurgency.

AWCY?, 5^^th^^ism, GAW (if you headcanon them), and any other high-profile/high-exposure Foundationverse organization is probably connected to the Insurgency in some way, with the exception of Sarkicists, because they have their own thing going on.

+++ __The Global Occult Coalition:__

The GOC was formed in secret by the UN shortly after the UN's formation. At its core were German occultists who renounced their association with the Ahnenerbe SS and all that that entailed. By 2016, they'd absorbed hundreds of smaller organizations. At its heart, the GOC is the Foundation's central tenet (protecting humanity) with the caveat of scientific understanding discarded. They do not officially recognize the Foundation's jurisdiction or authority, but they let the Foundation handle issues when they can because their biggest focus is on eliminating world-ending/reality-damaging/veil-lifting phenomena. The Foundation's focus of understanding things and then letting normal scientists play with it doesn't fly with the GOC. A fair summation of the GOC's approach to issues is "We have to nuke the site from orbit. That's the only way to be sure."

They don't like employing wizards except when fighting creatures that normal guns & such won't kill. They don't employ much paratech because they feel like it defeats the point.

+++ __The Church of the Broken God:__

"The Church of the Broken God" is basically a cover-all term for machine-worshipers, of which there are many. The 'true' Church of the Broken God is essentially a spinoff of Catholicism founded by a Spanish blacksmith/tinkerer during the Spanish Civil War. Robert Bumaro's Church is only one of many. There are Buddhist/pseudo-Buddhist cults in India and much of Asia that seek nirvana with the Divine Mechanism. There are Christians who believe that the Second Coming of the Savior will come in the form of the technological singularity (with similar equivalents in Islam and Judaism). Essentially, the idea that God is a machine that needs to be constructed/reconstructed is a virulently proliferated idea in the MacCanon. Some cults have roots that go back centuries or millennia. Some are revivals of once-dead cults. Some are brand-new. Most are a combination thereof.

They're not really wrong but they're not really right. The real machine God(s) aren't as pleasant, merciful, or graceful at the cultists assume them to be.

+++ __Sarkicists:__ 

MacCanon Sarkicism isn't true Sarkicism. In what we'll call the Metaverse (after [[*user Metaphysician]]), those who follow the words of Ion believe in a Lovecraftian cosmology that doesn't mesh with recorded history but seems to be accurate.

MacCanon Sarkicists are basically extras/leaks/spillovers from universes where the Sarkic cosmology is true. In the MacCanon, they're not so much //wrong// as suffering the most existentially terrifying cultural version of the Mandela Effect. Yaldabaoth is going to consume a large number of iterations of Earth. And it will fail to consume a large number of other iterations of Earth. But MacCanon Earth isn't even on the menu. So MacCanon Sarkicists are essentially successfully parasiting off it from a place where it can't reach. Like when ticks bite an animal somewhere the animal can't bite or scratch it off.

They have no respect/regard for the Veil the rest of the world has constructed. Their danger doesn't come from actually being dangerous, but from bold, blatant, brazen public activities. It's kind of hard to act like everything is peachy when Russian crime kingpins very publicly demonstrate lycanthropy or when entire isolated villages carry out blood harvests. Their end goal is either apotheosis or nirvana, depending on the cult. Trying to hide their faith/fantastical blood rituals has no place in their agendas. Stopping those agendas is really a distant second priority to the Foundation, GOC, and cooperative governments, way, way behind making sure the public doesn't catch on. In both respects, the Foundation and GOC are slowly losing ground. What happens next is yet to be seen.

+++ __ORIA:__

I won't talk much about the organization except to say that MacCanon version mostly conforms to site consensus. They're probably the closest MacCanon organizations come to "Lawful Neutral." I feel like I'm too ignorant on the culture and history of Iran and the surrounding countries to talk about them in-depth fairly.

+++ __The Unusual Incidents Unit:__

There are dozens of government-funded anomaly research organizations globally. Among those, none come quite as close to breaking the Veil or discovering the extent of the Veil as the Unusual Incidents Unit. However, they are systematically sabotaged by the Foundation, who has infiltrated them all the way to the highest tiers of their leadership. They're well-trained FBI Agents who can't catch a break... because they're not supposed to. The Foundation intentionally makes them exhaust all their resources on wild goose chases, or tricks them into providing assistance in containment efforts.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=055wFyO6gag Watch this video.] Now imagine that Charlie can't even see Lucy. He just wants to kick that football //super fucking bad//. And then invisible Lucy pulls the ball away so he lands on his ass. Now imagine that happening forever, like if Charlie Brown were the Sisyphus of failing to kick a football or some shit. Charlie might be good at kicking a football, but we'll never know because he's perpetually falling on his ass instead. That's the UIU. The UIU is Charlie Brown. (The invisible Lucy is the Foundation, in case you didn't get it.)

+++ __GRU Division P:__

Same thing as ORIA, except I am willing to say that they are defunct and their assets have fallen into other hands at this point.

+++ __Daeva:__

The wrath of the Crimson Crown grows each day. Death itself is not enough to stop His subjects from fleeing, from seeking to supplicate him. The floodgates will break soon...

+++ __Shark Punching Center:__

... and it'll be the fault of the Men Who Punch at Sharks.

+++ __Dr. Wondertainment:__

Isabelle says hi!

+++ __Ahnenerbe SS:__

Most remnants are dead, most artifacts recovered and studied and contained, but a [[[scp-2367|shadow of Nazism]]] hangs over the German people. And though Obergruppenführer Otto Weber has since tossed aside his loyalty to the Reich, he and his men will never stop running, will never have a reprieve from the most persistent of pursuers, huntsmen who aren't seeking justice but rest for their Khan.

+++ __The Golden Horde:__

A place of peace and tranquility for the Khan must be found. They will not fail in their mission.

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="The SCPantheon" hide="-The SCPantheon"]]

+++ __The Wonder-Maker:__

The avatar of human creativity and ingenuity. Makes mistakes more often than not. The mistakes usually work out in Humanity's favor in the end. Really cheery. Makes toys. Likes purple. Secretly a parasite that consumes the souls of innocents in a process that looks a helluva lot like selecting an apprentice/successor. Gave us fire on accident and now it wants to keep us around.

+++ __The Scarlet King:__

The avatar of human vice. He is Wrath. He is Fury. He is fire and brimstone and rivers of blood and roads paved with the bones of followers and dissenters alike. His followers obey not out of love or loyalty, but fear. He made the flowers Bloom. He tore open the throats of the Children of the Night as they slept. He is hungry. He grows impatient.

His [[[scp-076|final First Blade]]] struck him down and killed him, but He grows restless.

+++ __The Machine Goddess:__

Avatar of human inventiveness and curiosity. Constructed as a clockwork calculator in the years before the War Beneath Two Trees. Became a Goddess and worships those who built her. She was Broken so that we could remain Whole. She is watching. She is waiting. She is proud, but also afraid. She will return soon.

+++ __The Factory:__

Avatar of human ambition and greed. The fires belch black smoke, the forges burn hot, the employees work ceasely, tirelessly. The teeth of the gears grind in hunger. There is nothing but Profit. There is nothing but the desire to Consume. All are buyers. All are consumers. All are employees. As the Final War begins, the true winner will be the Manufacturer of Arms.

But even the best-oiled machine may succumb to rust.

+++ __The Head Librarian:__

Avatar of human wisdom, artistry, and strength. Going back to the game room metaphor, the Serpent is the DM for all the RPGs, the dealer for every deck, and otherwise the rule-maker and scorekeeper. Maybe kind of jaded with games so trying to keep things from getting too ugly. Likes humans and other sapient life, though, and wants them around, if only because what good is a Library without those who read?
