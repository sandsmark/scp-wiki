title:Tufto's Personnel File
Greetings. If you have found your way here, then you are interested in the SCP writings of [[*user Tufto]], purveyor of fine Skips since he finally worked out how to write one successfully three weeks ago. Um. He has now written 7 (!) in the last few weeks, because he enjoys writing these weird things. He is thus eligible for an author page. No, he will not stop writing this page in an obnoxious third-person voice, thank you very much.

These Skips quite often revolve around Iran and Iranian history, since that is one of Tufto's main interests. They can often revolve around weird pocket dimensions/temporal anomalies. They tend to include strange and broken people trying to do good things, with varying results.

Tufto's sandbox is [http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/tufto here]. Tufto is always happy to hear critiques of things he's working on, however damning they are. Tufto will now stop speaking in this obnoxious third-person voice, because even he's getting irritated by it.

**Things that Tufto has written:**

This table formatting was shamelessly stolen from Mortos' page.

**Notes on Tufto's writings:**

[[collapsible show="SCP-3941: The Major Occultation" hide="SCP-3941: The Major Occultation"]]

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3941 My first (successful) SCP]. This was inspired by the idea that the Foundation could just randomly happen upon the Twelfth Imam during his occultation. Then I thought that this could be played with a bit. I'm pretty pleased with how it turned out, and I'm very glad I got rid of the over-the-top ending, on the suggestion of Wogglebug in the drafts forum. I have learnt that understatement is better than overstatement.

[[collapsible show="SCP-3013: An Expression of Mourning" hide="SCP-3013: An Expression of Mourning"]]

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3013 My "sophomore slump", as an American would say]. This one wasn't as good, mostly because I wasn't able to tie the thematic elements together properly. Plus, as has been very validly pointed out by people in the discussion, making the manifestations revolve around violence probably wasn't the best idea, given how it was about expressions of grief and not just a random killing-frame. When I feel up to it, I'll probably make some serious edits to the experiment logs.

[[collapsible show="SCP-3150: The Caravanserai at the End of the World" hide="SCP-3150: The Caravanserai at the End of the World"]]

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3150 My personal favourite (of mine) thus far]. I really liked the idea of a caravanserai that existed across time, where people from all periods of history could meet together. From there, the story of the proprietor and the future times gradually grew up around it, and the idea of the caravanserai being the last relic of an apocalyptic timeline came into play. I'm much happier with its execution than either of the previous two; it has greater complexity than 3941, while having better thematic consistency than 3013.

Fun fact: Khushnavaz and the two Turkmen poets are (loosely) based on real historical figures with their names. I created the dialogue between the Turkmen poets because I was thinking about the interaction between modernist and nationalist thinkers and the forebears they often lionised, but who existed in an intellectula milieu that was totally different from their own. May expand that interview a bit one day. Or not. Haven't decided yet.

[[collapsible show="SCP-3997: In My End Is My Beginning" hide="SCP-3997: In My End Is My Beginning"]]

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3997 Gah. This thing.] It was extremely difficult to write, and I wasn't that happy with it at first, but I'm pretty pleased with it after a few edits. It was concieved when reading Eliot's poem Burnt Norton, and there are a few Eliot references scattered in it (the title, for instance).

It's probably the most ambitious thing I've done, but I honestly only posted it because there was nothing more I could do to it. I'm pretty pleased overall, though; I think I built up the atmosphere right. This one and 3250 were rather more narratively experimental than my previous skips, and I'm probably going to be a bit more straightforward in the future.

[[collapsible show="SCP-3250: Unconsecrated Waters" hide="SCP-3250: Unconsecrated Waters"]]

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3250 Yes, this was an incredibly screwed-up thing to write, why do you ask?]

This was a repurposed version of an earlier skip, which was a little low-key, lacked a narrative hook and relied too much on references to other skips, so I deleted it. Instead, I had this utterly horrific idea. Despite it being my least popular by quite some way, I am happy with it; it was an interesting little experiment in both narrative and short fiction.

[[collapsible show="SCP-3514: The Moment of the Mahdi and the Moment of the Mortal" hide="SCP-3514: The Moment of the Mahdi and the Moment of the Mortal"]]

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3514 I think this turned out pretty well]. It's a shade to similar to 3941 in its structure and themes, but I think the subject matter differentiates it enough. Safavid history is my main interest in, well, life generally, so I really got the chance to go to town on the historical details here. I'm fairly happy with the end result, even if I still haven't found a way to make my dialogue less overwrought :p.

Fun fact: The title is a blatant effort at greater exposure, since I read that skips with longer titles get more exposure :p I think it gets the greater meaning present in the article across pretty well, though. It was originally just called "The Chaldiran Variations".

[[collapsible show="SCP-3799: A Short History of Snowfall" hide="SCP-3799: A Short History of Snowfall"]]

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3799 Well. This was possibly overambitious.] Indeed, it's my most ambitious skip to date. It was concieved through looking at the feeling of quiet bliss one feels on a snowy day, and then twisting that into something horrifying.

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="SCP-3699: Memoirs of a Shingle Beach" hide="SCP-3699: Memoirs of a Shingle Beach"]]

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3699 I felt like doing something short and surreal.] I got to Norfolk quite often and am fond of Cley's beach, and I've always loved the feeling of being on a windswept beach, looking out into the endless ocean. I also collect pretty-looking rocks occasionally. So I thought I'd make that into a mildly melancholic and absurd skip about talking rocks.

In addition to these, I have attempted to publish the following: 

- A horribly failed first Skip about a demonic alarm clock a few months ago (which was quite rightfully downvoted into oblivion. 
-A very meta-Skip about colonialism, which was being mildly upvoted but which I deleted because of Kid F's and Communism will win's very legitimate criticism about how shallow my treatment of the subject matter was. I may revisit some of the ideas used there again one day. The meta ones, at least.
-The original version of what would become 3250. This one was set in a beach in Alaska, and featured the ghostly cadavers of past realities destroyed by the Foundation emerging from the waters instead. It was mildly upvoted, but failed to gain much traction. I deleted it because I wasn't that happy with it; aside from relying a great deal on other skips, it just didn't have much narrative to it.

For those interested in my favourite Skips, so they can see the kind of stuff that influences me most, they are [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2823 2823] (an atrociously underrated piece), [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2188 2188], [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2317 2317], [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2508 2508], and my absolute favourite [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2072 2072].
