title:Tufto's Personnel File
Greetings. If you have found your way here, then you are interested in the SCP writings of [[*user Tufto]], purveyor of fine Skips since he finally worked out how to write one successfully at the beginning of May 2017. He has now written 12 (!) in the last few weeks, because he enjoys writing these weird things. No, he will not stop writing this page in an obnoxious third-person voice, thank you very much.

These Skips quite often revolve around Iran and Iranian history, since that is one of Tufto's main interests. In more general terms, Tufto's skips often revolve around weird pocket dimensions/temporal anomalies. They tend to include strange and broken people trying to do good things, with varying results.

Tufto's sandbox is [http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/tufto here]. Tufto is always happy to hear critiques of things he's working on, however damning they are. Tufto will now stop speaking in this obnoxious third-person voice, because even he's getting irritated by it.

**Notes on Tufto's writings:**

//Tufto's Iranian History SCPs//

[[collapsible show="SCP-3941: The Major Occultation" hide="SCP-3941: The Major Occultation"]]

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3941 My first (successful) SCP]. This was inspired by the idea that the Foundation could just randomly happen upon the Twelfth Imam during his occultation. Then I thought that this could be played with a bit. I'm pretty pleased with how it turned out, and I'm very glad I got rid of the over-the-top ending, on the suggestion of Wogglebug in the drafts forum. I have learnt that understatement is better than overstatement.

[[collapsible show="SCP-3150: The Caravanserai at the End of the World" hide="SCP-3150: The Caravanserai at the End of the World"]]

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3150 Probably still my best SCP thus far, and my personal favourite]. I really liked the idea of a caravanserai that existed across time, where people from all periods of history could meet together. From there, the story of the proprietor and the future times gradually grew up around it, and the idea of the caravanserai being the last relic of an apocalyptic timeline came into play. I'm much happier with its execution than either of the previous two; it has greater complexity than 3941, while having better thematic consistency than 3013.

Fun fact: Khushnavaz and the two Turkmen poets are (loosely) based on real historical figures with their names. I created the dialogue between the Turkmen poets because I was thinking about the interaction between modernist and nationalist thinkers and the forebears they often lionised, but who existed in an intellectula milieu that was totally different from their own. May expand that interview a bit one day. Or not. Haven't decided yet.

[[collapsible show="SCP-3514: The Moment of the Mahdi and the Moment of the Mortal" hide="SCP-3514: The Moment of the Mahdi and the Moment of the Mortal"]]

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3514 I think this turned out pretty well]. It's a shade to similar to 3941 in its structure and themes, but I think the subject matter differentiates it enough. Safavid history is my main interest in, well, life generally, so I really got the chance to go to town on the historical details here. I'm fairly happy with the end result, even if I still haven't found a way to make my dialogue less overwrought :p.

Fun fact: The title is a blatant effort at greater exposure, since I read that skips with longer titles get more exposure :p I think it gets the greater meaning present in the article across pretty well, though. It was originally just called "The Chaldiran Variations".

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="SCP-3501: The Storyteller of Isfahan" hide="SCP-3501: The Storyteller of Isfahan"]]
[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3501 I really enjoyed writing this.] I was able to write a purple-y as I wanted, as well as indulging my love of Safavid history.[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="SCP-3722: The City That Was Half the World" hide="SCP-3722: The City That Was Half the World"]]

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3722 All the monuments we see are divorced from their context]. Buildings are built according to a certain need, pattern and design. When we look at the Hagia Sophia, we see a large, beautiful building; but it was once the centrepiece of the Byzantine state's religious-imperial program, and then a central part of the Ottoman one, and so on. The structure of cities alters, and you can never touch a building but still change its role completely.

So, with this in mind, I decided to do another Safavid history skip. It works particularly well with Isfahan because of the intrictate plan upon which Safavid Isfahan was formed. I considered having it similar to 3514, with 'Abbas wandering the city, but decided instead that it would be better to give the city its own voice, however small.

--Fun-- Depressing fact: The demolition of the Safavid bathhouse in 1995 was a real thing. Which is rather saddening, to my mind.

//Tufto's "Let's mess about with reality" SCPs.//

[[collapsible show="SCP-3997: In My End Is My Beginning" hide="SCP-3997: In My End Is My Beginning"]]

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3997 Gah. This thing.] It was extremely difficult to write, and I wasn't that happy with it at first, but I'm pretty pleased with it after a few edits. It was concieved when reading Eliot's poem Burnt Norton, and there are a few Eliot references scattered in it (the title, for instance).

It's probably the most ambitious thing I've done, but I honestly only posted it because there was nothing more I could do to it. I'm pretty pleased overall, though; I think I built up the atmosphere right. This one and 3250 were rather more narratively experimental than my previous skips, and I'm probably going to be a bit more straightforward in the future.

[[collapsible show="SCP-3799: A Short History of Snowfall" hide="SCP-3799: A Short History of Snowfall"]]

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3799 Let it snow...] 

This was concieved through looking at the feeling of quiet bliss one feels on a snowy day, and then twisting that into something horrifying.

It's perhaps a shade deriviative, and the final log is somewhat exposition-heavy, but overall I am very pleased with how it turned out. I think it's possibly the only one of my ambitious reality-bending skips that 100% works.

//Tufto's Surreal SCPs.//

[[collapsible show="SCP-3699: Memoirs of a Shingle Beach" hide="SCP-3699: Memoirs of a Shingle Beach"]]

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3699 I felt like doing something short and surreal.] I got to Norfolk quite often and am fond of Cley's beach, and I've always loved the feeling of being on a windswept beach, looking out into the endless ocean. I also collect pretty-looking rocks occasionally. So I thought I'd make that into a mildly melancholic and absurd skip about talking rocks.

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="SCP-3444: She Took The Midnight Train Going Anywhere…" hide="SCP-3444: She Took The Midnight Train Going Anywhere…"]]

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3444 So I was thinking about Hollywood musicals,] and thought about how all Hollywood films follow such similar archetypes. You see a similar plot structure repeated over and over again- and yet, it can so often come out entirely differently once you change the details.

This skip is kinda a love letter to all ridiculously over-the-top fantasy-fulfilling fiction, done in the most OTT way possible: by spinning a yarn about cinematic archetypes, descending into fantasy, and having to come out again. I do not think this is my best SCP (that's still the Caravanserai), but this is the one I'm most proud of for actually pulling off in a semi-coherent fashion.

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="SCP-3979: Will You Walk Into My Parlour?" hide="SCP-3979: Will You Walk Into My Parlour?"]]

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3979 So, I thought I'd try an AWCY? piece]. I liked the idea of taking one of their works of art, and then slowly taking it apart and pointing out how pretentious they can be at times :p.

Fun fact: The skip is consciously designed to be a twisted mirror of the poem in terms of structure: the spider tries to tempt the fly, the fly eventually accedes, and there's a cautionary message at the end. Except the point is different; the spider is possibly benevolent, the message is aimed at the creators rather than the reader/viewer, and so on.

//Tufto's other SCPs.//

[[collapsible show="SCP-3013: An Expression of Mourning" hide="SCP-3013: An Expression of Mourning"]]

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3013 My "sophomore slump", as an American would say]. This one wasn't as good, mostly because I wasn't able to tie the thematic elements together properly. Plus, as has been very validly pointed out by people in the discussion, making the manifestations revolve around violence probably wasn't the best idea, given how it was about expressions of grief and not just a random killing-frame. When I feel up to it, I'll probably make some serious edits to the experiment logs.

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="SCP-3553: They All Go Into the Dark" hide="SCP-3553: They All Go Into the Dark"]]

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3553 I love looking at the "list of people who have disappeared mysteriously" page on Wikipedia.] Seeing all these people whose lives have been taken is horrifying because we don't get to see how it ends. There's no closure, no ending, no understanding; they just disappear into a kind of oblivion.

And so, this skip was about people disappearing into a literal oblivion. It's what happens in "Endless Night" from the other side of the coin; the effect it has on those who disappear, and the desperate attempts to prevent it, and to know what will happen.

//Tufto's Tales.//


[[collapsible show="Some Are Born To Endless Night" hide="Some Are Born To Endless Night"]]
[http://www.scp-wiki.net/someareborntoendlessnight A retooled 001 proposal.] It had been pointed out by Wrong that this was basically just a tale, so I got rid of the skip portion and published it as a tale instead. I think it came out OK, though it's hardly going to win any awards for good prose. I might tidy it up at some point.[[/collapsible]]

**Things that Tufto has written, which either failed or were self-deleted:**

- A horribly failed first Skip about a demonic alarm clock a few months ago (which was quite rightfully downvoted into oblivion. 
-A very meta-Skip about colonialism, which was being mildly upvoted but which I deleted because of Kid F's and Communism will win's very legitimate criticism about how shallow my treatment of the subject matter was. I may revisit some of the ideas used there again one day. The meta ones, at least.
-A skip set in a beach in Alaska, and featured the ghostly cadavers of past realities destroyed by the Foundation emerging from the waters. It was mildly upvoted, but failed to gain much traction. I deleted it because I wasn't that happy with it; aside from relying a great deal on other skips, it just didn't have much narrative to it. I rewrote it to be about Catholic limbo babies, but the same problem afflicted it.
-A Jekyll-and-Hyde-esque skip. It was doing OKish, but I eventually came to the conclusion after posting that I could do more with the characters, so I deleted it. I rewrote it, but eventually decided that it wasn't good enough and was pretty unsalvageable, so I deleted it for good.

**Addendum TUFT-1:**

For those interested in my favourite Skips, so they can see the kind of stuff that influences me most, they are [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2823 2823] (an atrociously underrated piece), [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2188 2188], [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3043 3043], [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2508 2508],  [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2072 2072] and my absolute favourite [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2747 2747].
