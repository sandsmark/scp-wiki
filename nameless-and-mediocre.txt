**Item Number:** SCP-5000

**Containment Class:** Tipler-Barrow[[footnote]]Object is both the result and cause of intelligent observers within known existence.[[/footnote]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment of SCP-5000 is under the purview of Project Penrose.

**Description:** SCP-5000 is an unfolded biological macromolecule classified as a protein. Despite its folding having a negative Gibbs Free Energy at all recorded temperatures and pressures, SCP-5000 will not spontaneously fold itself into a functional protein until observation by a sapient being is attempted. Regardless of the surrounding temperature, pressure, and chemistry upon observation, SCP-5000 will invariably fold itself into a self-replicating protein capable of thriving in its environment. Observation of SCP-5000 in its unfolded state is theoretically impossible, with the protein folding into one of several billion eigenstates[[footnote]]One of the quantum mechanically allowed results from the collapse of a system in a superpositioned state via observation.[[/footnote]] within nanoseconds when attempted. Confirmation of new SCP-5000 instances in the wild is accomplished by scanning for the presence of N-terminus and C-terminus[[footnote]]The starting and ending sections of a peptide chain.[[/footnote]] peptides typically used in the creation of self-replicating biomimetic[[footnote]]Designed to imitate or take inspiration from nature.[[/footnote]] peptide sequences.
