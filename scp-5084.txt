**Item #:** SCP-5084

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Scp-5084 is to be contained within a standard safe storage locker held at Site-19. All Foundation personnel with level two clearance or higher are permitted testing of SCP-5084 at the discretion of the site director.

**Description:** SCP-5084 is the collective sum of 40 cherry tomatoes (//Lycopersicon lycopersicum var. cerasiforme//) invulnerable to decomposition. SCP-5084's anomalous capabilities manifest when an individual is made aware of the presence of SCP-5084 in their immediate vicinity. The individual will firmly believe that all instances of SCP-5084 are sentient. Individuals have experienced auditory hallucinations in which they report hearing SCP-5084 produce human-like vocalizations. Individuals describe SCP-5084 instances as "scared, nervous, and untrusting" due to their vocalizations being described as childlike. SCP-5084's anomalous properties do not manifest when exposed to Foundation personnel.[[footnote]]Any person who has been employed by the SCP Foundation for a period of more than one month[[/footnote]]

**Foreword:** D-38291 is instructed to make eye contact with SCP-5084 and transcribe SCP-5084's statements. Afterward, D-38291 is to test effects of SCP-5084 consumption.

**Begin Log:**

(//D-38291 makes eye contact with SCP-5084//)

**D-38291:** What the hell? How the fuck are you ta-

**Test Overseer:** Just follow what we told you, 38291.

**D-38291:** Fine, hello th- what? I can barely hear you!

(//D-38291 arranges pile of SCP-5084 instances into a row//)

**D-38291:** Dear God, how long have you guys been piled like that? A couple of weeks! No wonder you're crying!

(//D-38291 leans in and speaks in a noticeably quieter tone//)

**D-38291:** Don't worry, I'm not here to hurt you. I just need you to calm down. When were you first able to talk?

**Test Overseer:** Please transcribe their responses, 38291.

**D-38291:** They tell me that it's always been this way. They just don't know why the men in coats can't hear them. They're talking about you, aren't they?

**Test Overseer:** We told you 38291, they aren't sentient. This is all happening in your head, Foundation personnel just can't talk to them.

**D-38291:** I'm Foundation personnel, aren't I?

(//Test Overseer pauses)//

**Test Overseer:** Just continue.

**D-38291:** What do you guys do all day?

(//D-38291 pauses for several seconds//)

**D-38291:** They've just been rotting in a bin. They can't move, they can't talk, they can't even breathe. They're trapped.  Why can't you guys just let them out?

**Test Overseer:** That's outside of your control.

**D-38291:** Wait, I'm not the first guy they've tested these things on, aren't I? What have the men in coats done to you?

**Test Overseer:** It would be advisable to stick to the script before further action is needed.

**D-38291:** You've... oh dear god. You've sliced them, crushed them, diced them. What's next? Am I going to eat one of them or something?

**Test Overseer:** Actually, yes. You are to consume an SCP-5084 specimen.

**D-38291:** ...I'm not going to do that.

**Test Overseer:** We'll give you one more chance 38291. Consume the specimen or suffer the consequences.

**D-38291:** I... I'm sorry for what I'm about to do.

(//D-38291 consumes SCP-5084 specimen//)

**D-38291:** It tastes... like a tomato. What did you expect? I can hear it fucking screaming down my throat. It's crying.

**D-38291:** You burnt them, blended them, and torn them apart. They're begging for mercy, no wonder they trust no one.

(//D-38291 escorted out of testing chamber//)
