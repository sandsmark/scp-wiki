**Item #:** SCP-2312

**Object Class:** Keter  

**Special Containment Procedures:** Mobile Task Force Tau-20 ("Turkish Recon") is tasked with identifying SCP-2312 instances. Areas with identified SCP-2312 instances are to be cordoned off under the pretence of a Cyprus Turkish Peace Force Command training area. In cooperation with the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus' (TRNC) [[footnote]] A self-declared state based on the northeastern portion of Cyprus Island. [[/footnote]] government, appropriate counter-Extranormal Events measures are to be enacted against all 2312-Eris Events. 

**Update (05/05/2004):** TRNC's //de facto// sovereignty is to be upheld, as defined by the current borders claimed by it. 

**Description:** SCP-2312 refers to a series of carvings found on the surface of the Kyrenia Mountains referencing an individual named "King Pan" (designated SCP-2312-A); instances typically manifest once per month. SCP-2312 instances are written in Koine Greek, and styled as decrees from SCP-2312-A. Although its identity and existence cannot be ascertained, SCP-2312-A is inferred to be a monarch claiming rulership over a "Kingdom of All Cypruses". 

When an SCP-2312 instance manifests, a corresponding Extranormal Event will occur (designated 2312-Eris Event). All 2312-Eris Events are localised within TRNC-controlled territory. Removal of SCP-2312 does not prevent occurrence of 2312-Eris Events. Below are several examples of SCP-2312 instances and corresponding 2312-Eris Events; compilation is restricted to Level ≥3/2312 clearance. 

||~ Translated excerpt ||~ 2312-Eris Event ||~ Cover Story || 
|| "...All Cypruses shalt unite under I and render my crooked brother's singular Cyprus a petty kingdom..." [[footnote]] Analysis indicates it to be the earliest SCP-2312 instance chronologically. [[/footnote]] || N/A || N/A ||
|| "...let all Cypruses have meat..." || Fishes spontaneously rain over TRNC cities. || Fabrication of a Mediterranean tropical-like cyclone. ||
|| "...scriptures of my benefactor – who gave me infinity – shalt spread to all Cypruses..." || Advertisements of "Heavenly Antlers Properties" are mailed to every TRNC household. || Publicity stunt by author ██████ ████████. ||
|| "...birds in flight – the pleasure of my deceiving brother – shalt be cast down..." || All birds within TRNC-controlled territory lost control over their wing muscles. Estimated █,███ birds died via major trauma. || Fabrication of an avian neuromuscular disease. ||

Occurring since ██/██/1992, 2312-Eris Events were initially classified as individual [[[log-of-extranormal-events|Extranormal Events]]]. They were classified under SCP-2312 on ██/██/1998, upon discovering a causality between SCP-2312 manifestations and 2312-Eris Events. 

**Addendum 2312-1:** Excerpt from "Heavenly Antlers Properties" Ad 

> //Got the short end of the family inheritance? Want to invest in lands beyond the third dimension? Greener pastures are infinite! We at [[[letters-to-a-prophet|Heavenly Antlers Properties]]] provide a wide range of services to guarantee trans-dimensional acquisition and ownership of land.//

**Addendum 2312-2:** After negotiations with Cypriot, Greek, Turkish and TRNC governments, the following test is conducted. 

||~ ||~ Phase A ||~ Phase B ||
||~ Procedure || Sovereignty over █████ [[footnote]] An uninhabited Turkish island on the Mediterranean Sea. [[/footnote]] transferred to TRNC from 20/04/2003 to 20/04/2004. || After 20/04/2004, █████ is returned to Turkish sovereignty. ||
||~ Results || 2312-Eris Events manifested on █████. || 2312-Eris Events ceased on █████. ||
||~ Analysis |||| SCP-2312's area of effect apparently shifts to accommodate territorial or sovereignty changes involving TRNC. Request maintenance of status quo. ||
