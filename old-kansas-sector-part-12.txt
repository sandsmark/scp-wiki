Laugh is Best. Laugh is GOOD. Laugh is amazing, happy, good feelings and good time for ANYONE to see or have. Why is Laugh not good in the year of August 2119 After Death? Why don't I get appreciated on television anymore? Well nobody really knows, I can only speculate. Ratings fell off a LOT in 2014. A LOT of normal and good people like me stopped watching my show.

Scenario that you can imagine: Be me. Be a very residual spawn sibling, but have no excess fluids. Be a producer, host, and work a long time making underground shows. Be me and make a lot of underground shows in the style that does the "human humor". Be me and get criticized for making monkey shows. I don't care that they called me "street organist". Does you ever seen the human street organist use dead monkeys? No. I made it fun.

Listen I know I'm not being born on Earth right?  I just have been enjoying and watching human humor programs since the television. Human culture is my culture, and I learned human language from watching the human programs. Wisconsin Public Broadcasting. Youtube. CNN. Animal Planet. The Learning Channel. I have seen all of the Partridge Family episodes and know all of the words. "Hey reuben come here and go away". haha

Ball world is my home because the Klein world is stupid. Klein world is random - the human ball world is a better format. Klein world says the ball world is "normal", like that's the worst thing ever, and now klein world is flooding into ball world when they didn't even like it. but I DID. They are Hippocrates? i think so.

SO THAT IS WHY no one coming in, my ball world place, no random, no crazy stuff. If HUMAN want to come in, they can send me a private message my user name is WarmJuicyMan@msn.com or ExoticOrthodontist on skype. If you are interested in my body of work just ask and I can DIRECT send you new episodes. I have to send them direct or the fuck people will confiscate them. I think they will. It hasn't happened in a while, but I am very protective of my work. I don't like to produce an episode and then the fucks take it. You put all that funny stuff on the disc, and one of them dumb white shirt fucks takes it away. I don't stop making episodes because I run out of ideas, or like critics say "Is just all exploding and growths Laughy, is the same thing every time Laughy." That is not the case. The former is the case, the fucks, I am scared of them take it away.

It makes me for real angry. My slug fuck spawn sibling come here in their ugly human costume, and they makes all these very many terrabytes of human sex tapes. GROSS! But the fucks don't take their stuff away. No. They think my stuff is bad because it makes you feel good and happy. No, my spawnsib gets stabbed 3000 times on the internet for all the people to see and massage to and that's for some reason okay.

I'm just kidding I'm not mad though. :) I am very good at the ironic style of humor.

I wrote this episode last night. Hard to find people who watch my show now, but, I am glad my subscribers still want episodes. 

,,*Ignore the girl at the end, that is an actor actually, I paid her to say self mean things about me. I know it's weird thing but not like that.,,

**Old Kansas Sector - NIGHT**

Four guys including small furry guy and girl guy in 
helicopter.  Girl guy is SAD, helicopter pilot looks 
at girl guy like he is THIRSTY. Small FURRY guy 
looks out of helicopter with long tongue. 

The group hear a loud bubble pop type of noise. 
CORPSE appear in helicopter. FURRY guy looks at 
THE  new dead man next to CLEF and begins to panic. 
SWEATS come out of his feet!


,,//**KAIN** (4), Cream color, Japanese style of dog. Wags weird tail.//,,

,,//**CLEF** (??), good body and ugly. Hides his face with a hat or photo shop.//,,

CLEF Wakes up from dreams because the quadruped 
is talking. Looks at dead  guy next to him in helicopter. 
Quickly pulls his gun and ducks to opposite corner of 
helicopter interior. He licks his lips and looks at the 
KAIN nervously.

> (//slaps the brim of Seven's hat//) Shit, no, don't look. Fly the fucking helicopter.

> Hey isn't this the bastard I killed earlier?

DEAD MAN begins to BLOAT. Loud and squishy noises as 
another dead man come out of the behind of the first 
dead man. (//laugh track//) GERSHA turns to look at 
dead man. CLOSE UP of GERSHA's reaction!

,,//**GERSHA** (22), BRIGHT yellow teeth, can see ALL veins, fun exotic matted hair style.//,,

CLEF shakes his head and looks at GERSHA like she is blurry.

ANOTHER loud pop bubble noise and more dead man come out
of the dead mens. Now there are four dead men. THREE comes
out of the front of 1. FOUR comes out of the back hole of 2.
(Special fart noise and smell-o-vision when this happens.)

> [[=]]

> Too much weight. Seven, Fucking drop it down anywhere, I don't care.
> [[/=]]

,,//**KONDARKI** (4), BIG and ROUND, wears a smaller hat than CLEF.//,,

> [[=]]
> **KONDRAKI**
> Can't, dead zone. Nothing beneath us. There's nothing as far as I can see.
> 
> Shit. 
> 
> We're losing altitude anyway.
> [[/=]]

FOUR loud bubble pops. Now there are EIGHT dead mens. This 
exceeds the weight limit for the helicopter by 600 pounds! 
Helicopter begins wobbling! CLEF grabs a safety chute and 
dives out of the window.
(laugh track)

> [[=]]
> **GERSHA**
> (shouting) I know we're on the thing, come out now!
> [[/=]]

Helicopter falls into nothing. Dead bodies slide and shuffle all
around the helicopter as it spins around! KONDRAKI accidentally 
does a kiss on one of the CORPSE cheeks.
(aww track)

**FINALE:** BIGGEST pop noise. Laughy McLaugheson come out of
front of CORPSE mouth hole. Close up camera view on Laughy's suit.

GERSHA.
