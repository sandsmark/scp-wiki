> ##red|**jockjamsvol6:**## I'm sorry.
> ##red|**jockjamsvol6:**## One of our number, one of the young ones, killed herself. Dove. chereamie.
> ##blue|**polaricecraps:**## oh god. that's fuckin horrible. would I have known her from anything?
> ##black|**bones:**## This is a time of sorrow for us all. She was an exemplary human being. I regret that you did not all have the opportunity to know her.
> ##purple|**hetcopogg:**## i was just talking to her the other night. i knew her from the trans girl chat. she really was an angel.
> ##a8125a|**gaycopmp4:**## i knew her from the medical stuff and i was always so worried that the janitors would clean her up you know she was pretty free with what she could do at the planned parenthood and the clinics and fuck
> ##purple|**hetcopogg:**## i'm sorry guys. i'll be back later. i can't do this right now.
> **hetcopogg has left the chat.**
> ##ff00ff|**lesbian_gengar:**## it was the parents, wasn't it?
> ##red|**jockjamsvol6:**## I didn't hear much, but I think so.
> ##green|**bluntfiend:**## I knew her from one of the chats. Sweetest girl you ever knew, honest. Jesus Christ. Never knew anybody who was just so fucking willing to help.
> ##a8125a|**gaycopmp4:**## i know she was so good dove was so smart and funny and she really helped me a lot w/ the hugbox thing she knew so much about that shit so much about the body.
> ##ff00ff|**lesbian_gengar:**## i didn't get the chance to know her. i saw a few things she did. talented girl, honestly. i'll miss her. and what she would've done, i guess.
> ##ff00ff|**lesbian_gengar:**## may her memory be a blessing. what do you christians say?

> ##a8125a|**gaycopmp4:**## i never know what to say during these things im sorry guys
> ##black|**bones:**## It is alright.
> ##green|**bluntfiend:**## Do we know when the funeral will be? Or, the wake? Does she come from a wake family? @lesbian_gengar, if you're up to it, I think we should go there. I don't want Dove to be buried under another name.
> ##red|**jockjamsvol6:**## I'll PM you both.
> ##blue|**polaricecraps:**## is there anything I can do?
> **gaycopmp4 has left the chat.**
> ##black|**bones:**## I think the only suitable option we have at this juncture is to mourn. We mourn, and we strive to ensure it is never repeated.
> ##ff00ff|**lesbian_gengar:**## if i need anything, i'll ask. thanks, PIC.
> ##0c6362|**harmpit:**##  i hope there is some place else she can go where she will be happier than she was here, and i hope it doesn't take a long time for her to get there.
> ##green|**bluntfiend:**## You don't have to pull yourself together like that. I don't think she'd be mad if you made typos when talking about her.
> ##0c6362|**harmpit:**##  the least i can give her is my concentration.
> ##blue|**polaricecraps:**## I wish I had known her. I really do. I always meant to talk to her. she seemed so kind.
> ##black|**bones:**## @jockjamsvol6, when you receive news of her funeral, please send me the address. I wish to provide flowers. She enjoyed lilies.
> ##red|**jockjamsvol6:**## She'd've really liked that. Thanks, big guy.
> ##green|**bluntfiend:**## Hey, so. Apropos of nothing, but can we change the name?
> ##ff00ff|**lesbian_gengar:**## no.
> ##red|**jockjamsvol6:**## No.
> ##blue|**polaricecraps:**## I wish there was something I could do. I wish the world wasn't like this. why do our best keep dyin and the bad fuckers keep on livin?

> ##green|**bluntfiend:**## I'm back from Dove's funeral.
> ##ff00ff|**lesbian_gengar:**## me, too.
> ##red|**jockjamsvol6:**## I wish I could've been there. How was it?
> ##green|**bluntfiend:**## Not so good at first. Dahlia came with us. She wasn't doing so good.
> ##ff00ff|**lesbian_gengar:**## the monsters were going to bury her in a suit. they cut her hair.
> ##green|**bluntfiend:**## Nothing a little razzledazzle couldn't fix. We brought Dahlia in after. I couldn't let her see Dove like that.
> ##black|**bones:**## From there, it went smoothly?
> ##ff00ff|**lesbian_gengar:**## treated her like the woman she'd always been. i wanted to fuck with them.
> ##green|**bluntfiend:**## I told her that wouldn't be cool.
> ##ff00ff|**lesbian_gengar:**## bluntfiend had said yeah that it wouldn't be cool. dove wasn't about that life.
> ##red|**jockjamsvol6:**## I really do wish I could have come. I'll miss her until the day I die.
> ##black|**bones:**## We all will in the place where the truth of our heart is kept.
> ##green|**bluntfiend:**## It was a beautiful mass. Roman Catholic. They've loosened stuff about deaths from suicide, you know. Dahlia gave a eulogy. I don't know how everyone felt about it.
> ##ff00ff|**lesbian_gengar:**## it was beautiful.
> ##red|**jockjamsvol6:**## How'd they take it?
> ##green|**bluntfiend:**## Better than they would have if Esther and I weren't there, I guess.
> ##red|**jockjamsvol6:**## Yeah.
> ##ff00ff|**lesbian_gengar:**## anyways you shouldve seen jude in his big boy clothes.
> ##red|**jockjamsvol6:**## No pajama pants? No dirty shirt?
> ##ff00ff|**lesbian_gengar:**## fucking khakis, dude.
> ##red|**jockjamsvol6:**## Lmao when did you get khakis, Jude?
> ##green|**bluntfiend:**## I went to a Catholic high school. You guys know this. We had uniforms and everything.
> ##red|**jockjamsvol6:**## Oh yeah, shit. The pope would've wanted you to look slick. That's good.
> ##black|**bones:**## I do not mean to intrude upon owning Jude and remembering Dove, but I believe there are some things that we need to deal with.
> ##red|**jockjamsvol6:**## PIC thing?
> ##green|**bluntfiend:**## Shit, is he okay?
> ##black|**bones:**## Physically unhurt. That is not the issue.
> ##red|**jockjamsvol6:**## Got in an argument with harmpit. We think Dove's death is getting to him. He's just really fucking serious and mean lately.
> ##green|**bluntfiend:**## What was it about?
> ##black|**bones:**## Mostly, it was about killing.
> ##ff00ff|**lesbian_gengar:**## what?
> ##red|**jockjamsvol6:**## PIC was kind of mad about the whole no killing rule. Just got in a big row kinda with harmpit.
> ##green|**bluntfiend:**## And Armand didn't let it out?
> ##ff00ff|**lesbian_gengar:**## they're not an idiot.
> ##black|**bones:**## Armand did not reveal any secrets during the argument. Their argument was emotional but academic.
> ##green|**bluntfiend:**## I know I just had to ask. I think maybe someday I should tell them.
> ##red|**jockjamsvol6:**## Let's not rush to tell them their pacifist hero has a body count.
> ##ff00ff|**lesbian_gengar:**## don't be a dumbass.
> ##green|**bluntfiend:**## I'll talk to PIC, bones. Thanks for dealing with it.
> ##black|**bones:**## It has never been a problem, and I cannot foresee it becoming one.
> ##red|**jockjamsvol6:**## He's been banned for a couple days.
> ##ff00ff|**lesbian_gengar:**## when's it up?
> ##black|**bones:**## The ban has timed out. I have not seen him. I will notify you if he signs on.
> ##red|**jockjamsvol6:**## Think he'll be okay?
> ##green|**bluntfiend:**## I don't know. I hope so. Maybe. Probably.
> ##ff00ff|**lesbian_gengar:**## he'll be fine.
> ##green|**bluntfiend:**## Yeah, you're right.

> ##green|**bluntfiend:**## Their body was static, and I broke it apart, and I pulled it through cords and wire.
> ##blue|**polaricecraps:**## fuck blunt
> ##green|**bluntfiend:**## And I regret it everyday of my life. I think I did the right thing. I'd do it again, I think. But it's my sin. And I am sure, one day, I will be judged for it.

> ##green|**bluntfiend:**## Not like you. Nazis don't wave around guns unless they plan on using it. But, fuck.
> ##green|**bluntfiend:**## Remember this. I want you to always remember this.
> ##green|**bluntfiend:**## This is how it feels to take a life. It isn't one for another. It's not a system of trading. It doesn't make up for Dove. Nothing does. One Nazi is dead, and Dove is still gone.
> ##blue|**polaricecraps:**## im sorry
> ##green|**bluntfiend:**## It's okay.
> ##blue|**polaricecraps:**## are they gonna get me
> ##green|**bluntfiend:**## I don't know if the janitors are that good. It'll take them at least a day.
