**Item #:** SCP-1268

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1268 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell and fed regularly. Further, SCP-1268 is to be tethered to a fixed object in the room to prevent escape.

In the event of a containment breach, security personnel are required to detain SCP-1268 alive if at all possible; however, if personnel deem SCP-1268 an imminent risk, they are permitted to dispose of it by any means necessary.

**Description:** SCP-1268 appears to be a [REDACTED] human male with brown eyes and black hair. While SCP-1268 is capable of basic motor functions and self-maintenance, it does not appear to be capable of communication, nor does it show signs of --emotion or-- higher intelligence. It is currently believed to be nonsapient; however, it has demonstrated the ability to use stairs, door handles, and elevators.

When left to its own devices, SCP-1268 will wander aimlessly until it is in proximity to a large group of people[[footnote]]Due to the inherent expense of testing SCP-1268’s capabilities, the exact group size and conditions necessary to trigger SCP-1268’s anomalous effects is unknown. The phenomenon has been observed to occur in groups as small as ██.[[/footnote]]; in these situations, SCP-1268 will go into the crowd and slowly move through it. During this process, the behavior of those in the group who are within 60 meters of SCP-1268 will be altered in a predictable manner:

* 0 min to 2 min: No effects are visible.
* 2 min to 7 min: Persons in the crowd are visibly nervous, turning their heads frequently and moving more quickly than before SCP-1268 entered the crowd.
* 7 min to 14 min: Persons other than SCP-1268 begin to experience disorientation and confusion. Some will actively attempt to exit the crowd, although most will continue with whatever activities they were participating in.
* 14 min forward: Approximately 80% of all persons in the crowd panic and attempt to leave the area by any means necessary. Subjects affected this way show a distinct lack of concern for the safety of themselves and others. Anomalous effects will cease after SCP-1268 is no longer in the crowd.
    
The danger of SCP-1268 varies with group size, group density, accessibility of exits, and size of exits. On average, 30% of all persons in a group that has been affected by SCP-1268 will be killed from being trampled or from interpersonal violence. A further 35% will suffer injuries of various severity. SCP-1268 will remain unharmed --and show no apparent reaction to the event.--

**Addendum:** A review of available footage has found that, when in a crowd for fourteen minutes or more, SCP-1268 will exhibit a behavior that may or may not be laughter.
