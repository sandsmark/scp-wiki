**Item #**: SCP-977

**Object Class**: Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures**: Access to the SCP-977 site has been restricted on the basis of ongoing asbestos removal and renovation. The site is to be secured by guards in standard █████████ security company cover uniforms, with concealed armament. No fewer than three Foundation staff members are to be present on site at any time while research is being conducted. Employees entering or leaving the building are required to don breathing masks and standard safety clothing to prevent suspicion.

The security cameras already existent in the building have been modified to link to SCP Foundation servers. These cameras can be accessed both on-site through Foundation terminals and via the Foundation network. Footage is automatically backed up every two hours both to local hard-drives and to off-site storage. Any developments are to be reported to site overseer Dr. █████████. Access to video recordings, research and logs may be granted by personnel with level 4 security clearance or higher.

//Addendum//: Following incident 977-I-1, it is necessary that all staff be escorted by at least one other staff member or member of security personnel at all times while on the SCP-977 site. Failure to follow these procedures will result in reprimands which may include (but are not limited to) demotion of security level, loss of privileges and denial of leave. Object class has been upgraded to Euclid.

**Description**: SCP-977 is a warehouse located in an industrial district in █████ ████████, ███████. The warehouse was brought to the Foundation's attention after it was reported abandoned in ████, and reports of its unusual interior were intercepted. The Foundation subsequently purchased the building, designating it Site ██, and these reports were suppressed. Records state that the warehouse was constructed in ████, and prior to being purchased by the company, the warehouse was owned by several companies, including 'Transfold Freighters', 'RMA Electronic Wholesalers', spanning a period of ██ years. However, a large amount of documentation on these leases and the building's construction has been recovered containing numerous contradictions. This suggests that these operations were not functioning companies, and may have been cover operations for a yet unidentified group or individual.

SCP-977 is outwardly unremarkable and, aside from Foundation equipment and the security station, currently empty. Along with a single open storage space typical of a warehouse, the structure contains a number of white, irregular rooms and corridors, many of which are sunk below street level at varying depths, and are all characterised by unusual plateaus, varying ceiling heights and raised platforms.

The security station itself shows no unusual properties, and can be access via a stairwell next to docking bay C. The security monitors are divided in to two groups of eighteen monitors, with black-and-white displays, designated group-1 and group-2. Group-1 is receiving signals from an unidentified source, showing close-up images (visible from the shoulders upwards) of numerous unconscious persons, wearing identical unisex hospital gowns. These images cycle at eight minute intervals, with a new image/subject replacing the previous one. A cross reference of these images has identified a total of [REDACTED] unique faces at last count and continues to increase, although many faces have been repeated. Group-2 is receiving images of rooms and hallways that match the characteristics of the white rooms contained within the complex, however while some of these are verifiably originating from within the warehouse itself, several others do not match the layout of any known room. No sound is transmitted to the station, and the last three monitors in group-2 are currently not receiving any signal. The station also features a console with a text-based command input, although it appears to be running a unique operating system, the functionality and interface of which has yet to be fully determined. Investigations in to the console's operation and the source of the unknown images are ongoing.

||**Research Log 977-A:**||

> Log-977-A-1
> Date: ██/██/████
> Basic control of the group-2 cameras was been established by means of the command console, including rotation (limited to 45 degrees from origin for X-axis motion and 30 degrees for Y-axis motion) and zoom (to a maximum of 2.3x optical zoom). Investigation of seven of the eight cameras revealed nothing, however, a previously unseen figure was observed slumped against as distant wall of the hallway observed by camera 2-6. This hallway is not known to be part of the existing complex. The figure appears to be a dark-skinned male, wearing a hospital gown similar to those worn by subjects viewed on the group-1 monitors, though distance and image quality has hampered further investigation.

> Log-977-A-5
> Date: ██/██/████
> Limited interaction with the cameras transmitting to the group-1 cameras was achieved. Catheters are observed protruding from the veins in each subject's right arm; however the apparatus to which these are connected cannot be observed from this angle.

> Log-977-A-6
> Date: ██/██/████
> Movement is observed on monitor 2-11, observing a hallway. A figure was observed to walk slowly across the far end of the corridor around a corner, although image quality is too low for detailed observation. No other movements were recorded on this date.

> Log-977-A-8
> Date: ██/██/████
> Interaction with subjects observed through group-1 monitors was achieved. A random identification key was entered in the command console, causing a unidentified white male was displayed on all group-1 monitors. After a series of subsequent commands, the subject was awakened from unconsciousness.
> 
> The following is a log of the subject's activity in the hours following awakening: 
> 
>> ██/██/████
>> 
>> //1713:// Subject awakens slowly. After several minutes, subject raises himself from the bed with difficulty, possibly suffering from muscle atrophy or lingering effects of sedatives. Subject then leaves the field of vision of the bed camera. Movements of the subject for the next 28 minutes are unknown.
>> 
>> //1754:// Subject appears in a hallway displayed on monitor 2-11, approaching the camera. Hallway is not known to be part of the existing complex. Subject is walking slowly with hunched shoulders and observing surroundings, frequently looking over shoulder. While climbing over a plateau in the centre of the hallway, subject suddenly reacts to some unknown stimulus, and looks over shoulder for several seconds, breathing heavily, then resumes climbing slowly. After two minutes, the subject passes out of the field of vision once again. Subject does not seem to react to the presence of the camera. Movements for the next 17 minutes are unknown.
>> 
>> //1811:// Subject appears on monitor 2-6, moving away from the camera. After several paces, they see the previously observed body slumped against the wall at the far end of the corridor. Subject stops abruptly, and then turns back towards the camera hurriedly. Movements for the next hour and 39 minutes are unknown.
>> 
>> //1950:// Subject appears on monitor 2-3, moving towards the camera, breathing heavily but not observably injured. While climbing over a series of small steps, subject trips and falls, and remains on the ground for the following 8 minutes, before unsteadily rising to their feet. Subject then proceeds for another several paces before sitting once again, in a state of visible distress, remaining there for the following 23 minutes.
>> 
>> //2013:// Subject moves from the stair into a seated position against a neighbouring plateau, facing away from the camera, partly out of the camera's field of vision.
>> 
>> //2040:// Subject's breathing has become noticeably heavier.
>> 
>> //2130:// Subject's breathing progressively becomes shallower, taken in large breaths.
>> 
>> //2209:// Subject's body begins to convulse for a period of 34 minutes.
>> 
>> //2243:// Subject's movement ceases, declared deceased.
>> 
>> 
>> ██/██/████
>> 
>> //1029:// Subject's skin appears to be growing darker, or decaying at an accelerated rate.
>> 
>> //1656:// A number of small, dark growths are observed protruding from the subject's right palm.
>>
>> //2009:// Growths have spread across the body's extremities and face, obscuring features. Growths appear as a large number of small, semi-rigid filaments. It is unknown whether these growths are organic or inorganic.
>> 
>> 
>> ██/██/████
>> 
>> //0338:// Subject's body is entirely covered by growth.

> Log-977-A-14
> Date: ██/██/████
> Function to change the camera transmitting to individual group-2 monitors by means of the console was determined. Logs are now to be kept of unique camera viewpoints and their corresponding identification keys.

> Log-977-A-17
> Date: ██/██/████
> A systematic examination of group-2 identification keys revealed a previously unknown camera concealed within the security station itself. The camera tracked the movements of Dr. ███ independently for several minutes after the cover was removed by Dr. ███, but has since become inactive. The corresponding identification key will also no longer access this camera.


//Addendum:// The discoveries detailed in Log-977-A-17, along with Incident 977-I-1, have necessitated the upgrade of SCP-977 from safe to Euclid. Please refer to containment procedures for changed security precautions, commencing ██/██/████.


||**Incident Log 977-I**||

> Log-977-I-1
> Date: ██/██/████
> Incident 977-I-1 occurred during a routine inspection of the SCP-977 site by Dr. ██████, who was alone on-site against Foundation regulations. The incident occurred at 2204 hours, while they were inspecting one of the site's rear corridors. At this time, Dr. ██████ departed from inspection procedure by taking a left at the end of the hallway instead of a right. Questioning with regards to this decision suggests that this was a mistake and not deliberate, possibly as a result of fatigue.
> 
> The recordings of this moment do not show Dr. ██████ appearing on monitor 2-3, as is expected after taking this route. For the next 4 hours, they were not observed on any active monitor. At 0221 hours, they are briefly seen in an agitated state moving past the far end of the corridor observed by monitor 2-11, and are not seen again for another 6 hours. At approximately 0830 hours, Dr. ██████████ and Dr. ███ arrived at the site expecting to meet Dr. ██████, and the alarm was raised 15 minutes later when they could not be located. A search operation was both dispatched both inside the building and the surrounding area, concluding at 0904 hours when Dr. ██████'s cries were heard by the interior team. The doctor was located near the corridor where they had initially disappeared, and was subsequently brought into Site-██ for questioning.
> 
> Dr. ██████ reported realising they had left the known parts of the site shortly after having taken a wrong turn. They immediately attempted to retrace their steps, but found themselves unable to recognise any landmarks. They report having wandered for several hours in an effort to return to the known site, during which they experienced periods of intense paranoia. When asked how long they had wandered, Dr. ██████ was unable to give an accurate estimate. During this period, they attempted to contact the Foundation by means of security cameras, which were present in every room. As these cameras were not manned at the time, this cannot be corroborated by Foundation recordings, although they stated that the cameras did track their movements. Although Dr. ██████ describes the corridors as silent, they reported several incidents where they believe they heard faint or distant sounds, or slight changes in room layout, however this may have been a result of fatigue or paranoia. The air pressure also reportedly changed at several irregular intervals.
> 
> After having wandered for an unknown amount of time with infrequent breaks, Dr. ██████ reportedly came upon a unique corridor by chance, leading to what was, by their description, a room very similar to the security station used to monitor SCP-977, although bare aside from the station and fitted furnishings. During their examination of the station, they observed one monitor viewing what reportedly appeared to be the security station used by Foundation staff. After they explored the room a period, they then reported seeing several black figures appear on different monitors, walking slowly. At this point, Dr. ██████ stated that they recognised one of these corridors as one they had recently passed and suffered a panic attack, fleeing the scene.
> 
> After an extended period of exertion, Dr. ██████ came to a halt in a corridor, falling to the ground out of exhaustion. Though they apparently intended to continue their exploration, they recall having fallen asleep in a seated position, and having been awoken by the shouts of the approaching search party. The doctor was subsequently retrieved, during which they expressed disorientation, claiming to have fallen asleep in a different hallway. Dr. ██████ later retracted this statement, citing uncertainty.
> 
> A medical check-up revealed Dr. ██████ was physically unharmed by this experience beyond fatigue. The doctor was reprimanded for neglecting Foundation procedure, and their security clearance has been downgraded following the incident, with a review pending in 6 months.
