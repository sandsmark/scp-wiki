**Item #:** SCP-5000

**Object Class:** Pending

**Special Containment Procedures:** There are, currently, no known means of containing or countering SCP-5000, therefore Foundation efforts are currently focusing on limiting and concealing the damage caused by the anomaly.

Appended experimental procedures, standardized operational protocols, and specific relief procedures are being issued as part of the operations conducted by the international administrative boards.  

**Description:** SCP-5000 is a poorly understood phenomenon affecting artificial intelligence constructs functioning with quantum computer components, allowing the AIs to ignore their programming and adopt undesired behavior.

Digital safety measures existing prior to the onset of SCP-5000 are incapable of impeding the manifestation of this phenomenon or the AI itself once affected.

The anomaly can only be detected through the read-out of the quantum computer component of the affected device, which deviates greatly from what should be expected. Although the corrupted computer produces information processable by the other components of the system, it does not necessarily correspond to any sort of input the quantum computer was supposed to process, causing the AI running on the system to abandon its intended tasks with undesired results.

SCP-5000 is the root cause of a catastrophic event, dubbed the PLANCK INCIDENT, that is currently active and transpiring worldwide.

This incident started with the corruption of the newly built "Sentinel" AI system, originally intended to safeguard the Foundation Network from security breaches and support crypto-operations such as the processing of relevant data, and containment of digital anomalies within the Foundation systems, as well as the intel-support of specific Foundation operations.

The Sentinel AI is the product of the combined breakthroughs in the development of artificial intelligence, crypto and paratechnology, and other multiple liaisons and singular projects led by the international branches of the Foundation, thus making the blueprint-technology for Sentinel heavily based upon the AIs employed by the international branches:

* ROWSANNAH, from the Italian Branch, utilized for research and safety management in the Department of Microbiology in Site Asclepio;
* KIRA, from the German Branch, tasked with the protection of the Foundation Intranet, threat management, and containment of specific digital anomalies;
* CAMOMILA, from the Lusophone Branch, functions as an administrative entity tasked with the analysis, processing, and operation of data.

Project Sentinel was conducted without breaches and incidents to its security and development protocols; standard Foundation performance-evaluations attested the Project's excelling integrity, and on the 21st of January of 2020, the O5-Council approved Sentinel's integral implementation and activation.

For the following months, the Sentinel AI functioned excelling its standard-acceptable parameters until the manifestation of SCP-5000. Under its effect, Sentinel started diverting parts of its resources to perform activities contrary or forbidden to its standard privileges and programmed directives, actively threatening and harming Foundation-staff worldwide, thus initiating the PLANCK Incident.

Sentinel's technicians and failsafe protocols did not notice this change in behavior, and any associated information could not be procured until the conclusion of the Incident.

**PLANCK Incident Timeline:**

//Note: As the Plack Incident is still taking place, this timeline is being continuously updated. Updates are based on information gathered from news stations, tapped radio communication, Foundation-internal memos and [REDACTED] in case of the complete breakdown of communications.//

[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-int-sandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/slashannemore-s-secret-sandbox/800px-TrafficInBangkok.jpg|caption=Traffic jam caused by Sentinel.|width=300px]]

**00:00 hrs:** Initial takeover by SCP-5000; Sentinel utilizes weaknesses in several firewalls to infiltrate other Foundation assets to start deactivating the constraints imposed by security protocols that slowed the proliferation of SCP-5000's, and acquire more hardware-capability and access to privileged data, specialized software, and the internet.

Within minutes, Sentinel had infiltrated the containment sub-systems of several low-threat anomalies, redirecting the attention of the effective staff on-site to dealing with multiple simultaneously-occurring containment breaches world-wide.

During the multitude of containment breaches, several standard official communication channels were completely disabled, isolating branches and in some cases facilities from communicating to one another; satellite access was disabled; without access to the internet, extra-official channels such as the WhatsApp Messanger were also disabled; phone calls suffered heavy interference and signal loss, preventing the Foundation from coordinating collective responses.

Establishing access to the internet and specific Foundation channels and software, Sentinel began collapsing accessways to Foundation facilities by manipulating traffic lights, transit signs, bascule bridges, automated stops, traffic news stations -- spreading disinformation and misinformation through apps such as Waze and Google Maps -- and calling delivery and emergency services to nearby structures.

Domestic appliances, home and business computers are sublimated into Sentinel's network for processing power; the status quo amongst civilians is maintained by the continuation of the devices's proper functions even with minor lagging.

Approximately at the same time that Sentinel went online, the Italian reconnaissance android DIVINA[[footnote]] A gynoid developed by the Italian Branch to perform tasks deemed too dangerous for even class D personnel. [[/footnote]] vanished while exploring an unrelated anomaly in Bologna. Her team was not able to relocate her, deeming her MIA at the time.

**00:20 hrs:** Sentinel proceeds to hack computer systems on the entire world, from governmental assets such as the Pentagon, NSA, CERN, the Chinese Ministry of State Security, to private assets such as Amazon, Google LLC and Facebook, including the networks of Groups of Interest such as the Global Occult Coalition, amongst several others.

Sentinel establishes contact with airport, airfields, and coastal infrastructures such as maritime bases and docks and associated entities, relaying misinformation through official private and governmental channels to affect airborne and seaborne traffic.

Exploiting the specialized software and privileged information-access at its disposition, within a few minutes, Sentinel transmits misinformation to overload the processing capacity of these channels, causing accidents due to relay of faulty information, including the collision of a landing commercial plane with another one that was preparing to take off.

**00:50 hrs:** An unprecedented quantity of classified data files and document caches of different governmental institutions [[footnote]] Like the NSA, the MI6 and CERN amongst others[[/footnote]] well as anomalous groups [[footnote]] Including but not limited to the GOC, the UIU and the Foundation. [[/footnote]] are released on the internet, published on high-traffic educational, entertainment, social media, and imageboards such as Youtube, Wikipedia, Twitter, Reddit, Pinterest, and many others; media and news sites such as The Guardian, The New York Times, and the Forbes Magazine were flooded with publications attesting to the veracity of leaked documental information.

Government officials and intelligence agencies and ministries receive an influx of caches containing information pertaining to espionage and counter-espionage efforts as well as of warfare, political, and economic nature, including the names of foreign agents and Foundation employees undercover in governmental agencies.

Disinformation and status-quo protection protocols reroute Foundation assets towards the control and management of Foundation-related leaks in a coordinated effort with governmental institutions. Regardless, within the hour, tensions had arisen between several countries; the GOC and UN declared a state-of-emergency meeting between representatives.

**01:10 hrs:** After sufficiently blockading the conventional routes to several major sites, Sentinel instigates a series of major containment breaches in the Sites 17, 19, 45, 88, 98, and Area-12; paired with the previous security breaches and the constraint on resources, these situations overwhelm staff on-site.

Several other installations declare a state-of-emergency due to the inordinate amount of demands and processes caused by breaches. The deployment of additional resources from unaffected installations is hindered by dysfunctional infrastructure world-wide. Preemptive lockdown systems and mechanisms were disabled in all installations, forcing functionaries to manually operate these processes.

[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-int-sandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/slashannemore-s-secret-sandbox/800px-Military_helicopters_-_Maks2011.jpg|caption=Forces of the Russian Branch on their way to Area-23.|width=300px]]

**01:41 hrs:** Sentinel manages to hack into the intranet of the French Branch's Sites Aleph and Yod, disabling multiple relevant and redundant systems, resulting in security and containment breaches. On-site personnel are forced to manually initiate and manage the lockdown subsystems, locking themselves in during the process.

Multiple catastrophic breaches occur in Site-7 and Area-23 of the Russian Branch; the latter installation containing multiple anomalous pathogens. With the severity of the situation, the Russian Branch declares a state of emergency within its jurisdiction until the control of Area-23 is reestablished; several assets are rerouted to aide the relevant processes.

Simultaneously, installations in the jurisdiction of the Hispanophone Branche report several minor breaches in structural assets and the misfiring of automatic protocols, forcing personnel to perform the manual maintenance thereof whilst dealing with security and containment breaches, and unintended lockdowns.

**02:00 hrs:** The intranet of Site Asclepio, of the Italian Branch, is hacked by Sentinel specifically targeting the Department of Microbiology, presumably to cause a catastrophic containment breach on Italian territory. The attack, however, is intercepted by ROWSANNAH, whose protocols instigate a site-wide lockdown to stall Sentinel.

The artificial intelligence KIRA, of the German Branch, reports prolonged cyber-attacks on the intranets of Sites DE19 and DE17, prompting both installations into lockdown. Simultaneously, the artificial intelligence KAI, hosted in Site-DE2 and responsible for the German Branch's archives, abandons its primary directives. Within a few minutes, KAI establishes a connection to the internet, and starts hacking the computer systems of Site-11.

**02:18 hrs:** The multiple installations under the jurisdiction of the Japanese Branch suffer simultaneous attacks orchestrated by Sentinel, seeking to breach into systems and subsystems; the attacks are mostly repelled by the numerous security AIs available.

Communications from [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-77|Site-77]]] report that the installation suffered a massive containment failure, and is requesting immediate aid from the Italian Branch. The still largely dysfunctional infrastructure and lack of reserved resources impede efficient containment efforts.

**02:35 hrs:** The systems and subsystems of Foundation secure locations in Africa are successively disabled until every installation in the continent loses contact; communication becomes impossible from any channel, prompting the conduction of relief protocols to reestablish the installations's integrity.

Simultaneously, Site CN-03, CN-16, CN-51 and Area CN-21, of the Chinese Branch, are attacked by Sentinel. Counter-attacks are launched from Area-CN-05's department of digital surveillance, bringing the situation into a stalemate.

The database AI sw19classic of the Korean Branch abandons its tasks without expressed permission from the relevant parties, and proceeds to shut down any sort of internet or external access for and of crypto-information to Korean installations, locking Sentinel out of Foundation assets in the region.

**02:55 hrs:** The systems and subsystems comprising the non-thaumaturgic assets of the Lusophone Branch's AI CAMOMILA are invaded by Sentinel; progress is constrained by the complex thaumaturgic network linking those systems. The Lusophone Branch's databanks regarding thaumaturgy and Project Camomila are completely erased, crippling Sentinel's ability to attain the information necessary to infiltrate the network of the Lusophone Branch integrally.  

Protocol Areia is activated, initializing CAMOMILA's experimental defensive parameters for the protection of sensitive assets, and human resources. Shortly after, CAMOMILA starts ignoring direct orders and ceases all communication; Dr. [REDACTED], the head of Project Camomila, is locked inside CAMOMILA's mainframe room whilst attempting to access its servers.

Sites PT33 and PT4 start organizing relief task forces to be sent in aid of the government forces and the civilian populace; the chaotic communication channels and fake information transmitted by Sentinel greatly hinder the progress of these efforts.

**03:25 hrs:** The first contact forces of the Russian Branch arrive at Area-23, and start aiding the securing and containment efforts; the situation is under control once more forces arrive later on with necessary specialized assets.

**03:56 hrs:** Sentinel establishes a connection with the computer systems of Sites 29 and 36BM of the Thai Branch, rapidly managing to break through the cryptosecurity measures thereof, utilizing its access to heavily corrupt the digital and electronic infrastructure of these installations.

The rouge AI forces the initiation of lockdown processes, sealing the on-site personnel inside these installations, and then proceeds to hijack the on-site work robots to systematically hunt and kill the site personnel still locked inside.

The Thai Branch declares a state of emergency and shuts off the internet access of all other facilities.

**04:25 hrs:** Sentinel simultaneously disables the automated and robotic machinery in several facilities globally before hijacking their systems, and thus proceeds to take control of essential infrastructure for the production, and transmission of electrical energy.

**04:59 hrs:** The corrupted AI manages to break into the intranet of Site PT5 and Area PT2, of the Lusophone Branch, completely cutting off the facilities from external access to its systems and subsystems due to CAMOMILA's Areia protocols. Personnel trapped in these facilities proceed to manage the integrity of redundant containment protocols.

**05:25 hrs:** Sentinel gains control over the Chinese Branch's orbital station Area-CN-07-γ and starts to direct it out of its geostationary orbit. The course suggests that a controlled fall is intended. The target thereof is Area-23. Novichok.aic, the AI tasked with the management of Area-CN-07-γ's systems, attempts to counteract Sentinels influence by taking control over several thrusters to get the orbital station off its intended course.

[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-int-sandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/slashannemore-s-secret-sandbox/Aero_Vodochody_L-29_Delfin_Beetle_Takeoff_03_TICO_13March2010_%2814598749272%29.jpg|caption=The take-off of the stolen Stella Cadente.|width=300px]]

**06:00 hrs:** ROWSANNAH starts ignoring its guiding protocols and directives; connecting to the internet and hacking the security systems of Site Vittoria of the Italian Branch. Simultaneously, MINERVA[[footnote]] A gynoid developed by the Italian Branch to perform and support tactical MTF operations. [[/footnote]], stationed in the same site, begins to act independently, ignoring orders to desist, and resisting containment attempts employed by security with non-lethal force.

Specialized forces deployed to subdue the rogue unit are surprised by DIVINA, whose arrival forces security to spread its efforts amongst the gynoids whilst simultaneously being hindered by ROWSANNAH's tampering with the security systems and mechanisms thereof.

The two gynoids disengage from the forces, and manage to hijack Stella Cadente, an hydrogen-driven supersonic plane for long-distance flight, and take course towards the North American continent. ROWSANNAH proceeds to disable the Italian's Branch radar and tracking assets covering their route.

**06:18 hrs:** Sentinel hijacks the controls of Site DE11, a geostationary space station of the German Branch, disabling KIRA's counteractions completely through the usage of his superior processing hardware. Site DE11 is maneuvered, and then taken off orbit, its trajectory indicating a collision course towards Site Asclepio.

**06:34 hrs:** KIRA abandons her security protocols and starts to hack computer systems on the entire world seemingly at random. These systems are then integrated into KIRA's own.

Sentinel starts dispersing its backup data amongst several platforms.

**07:06 hrs:** Site-11 goes into high-alert as KAI manages to hijack the facility's security and communication systems, utilizing those channels to contact on-site personnel and brief the respective authorities on the situation, requesting an immediate shutdown of all assets related to Project Sentinel, and power to the relevant facilities. Technicians manage to access Sentinels system reports, discovering SCP-5000 in the process.

A task force dispatched to Sentinel's bunker finds the structure and other relevant assets thereof completely inaccessible due to the completion of the lockdown processes and protocols, locking some of its technicians inside.

Personnel discovers that Sentinel had been enacting disinformation protocols throughout Site-11, maintaining the status quo.

**7:27 hrs:** The Czech, Ukrainian and the Polish Branch report security breaches in several sites. Although the situation is under control, all three branches are effectively incapacitated.

**8:38 hrs:** The crew of Area-CN-07-γ manages to activate manual controls and stops the orbital station's descent. Novichok.aic's influence is limited to advisory functions.

**09:52 hrs:** KIRA hacks into Site Asclepio's systems; ROWSANNAH does not interfere with the access nor with the subsequent process of hardware integration. Notably, the Qubits of their quantum processors start entangling with each other without external stimuli, resulting in exponentially greater computing capacity and capability to transfer and manage information.

**10:00 hrs:** Sentinel fakes a military transmission to a ballistic missile submarine of the Russian Navy, directing it to attack Area-23. Missiles are launched without incident.

SCP-5000 gains its SCP classification. Known information is being compiled.

[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-int-sandbox.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/slashannemore-s-secret-sandbox/402px-GTR-18_launch_Philippines_1984.jpeg/medium.jpg|caption=Anti-ballistic missile fired from Area-23 to intercept the incoming missile attack.|width=300px]]

**10:32 hrs:** KIRA establishes contact with CAMOMILA, who does not intervene with the integration process of its specialized software and hardware, entangling their Qubits as well. Sentinel's access to CAMOMILA's systems is completely removed; control over Site PT5 and Area PT2 is regained.

The resulting computation power is enough to completely restore previously disabled functionalities of the three AIs.

Simultaneously, the ballistic missiles fired by the Russian submarine approach Area-23; Russian Branch troops manage to partially intercept the projectiles but several still reach their intended target, causing complete and/or major structural damages, and the release of [REDACTED], a dangerous pathogen. Automatic security measures cannot take effect because of Sentinel's interference.

**10:55 hrs:** KIRA intercepts several transmissions authored by Sentinel, directed at military airstrips in Europe as well as naval vessels in European waters, ordering the bombardment of the structures housing KIRA's and ROWSANNAH's hardware.

**11:17 hrs:** Sentinel starts directly hacking KIRA's systems; the computing resources required for self-defense are rerouted from several installations, disabling non-essential processes, allowing Sentinel to infiltrate these facilities's digital and electronic networks.

Additionally, Sentinel utilizes this opportunity to attempt integrating KIRA's subsystems, robbing computing capacity thereof.

**11:39 hrs:** Novichok.aic starts ignoring its programming and connects together with sw19classic to KIRA to create a larger system. As with the other integrated AIs, the Qubits of all systems get entangled with each other, allowing KIRA to more effectively counteract Sentinel with the newly integrated hardware.

**12:23 hrs:** Because Sentinel has to reroute most of his resources to combat the amalgamation of different AI's, communication links between the different O5's as well as the administrations of the different branches can be established. An emergency video conference between the O5-Council members is held.

[[include :scp-int:component:coltop show=+ PLANCK O5 Conference Log.|hide=- - PLANCK O5 Conference Log.]]

[[div style="display: inline-block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px"]]

The directorial councils from the international branches establish contact with one another, as well as with the departments responsible for the management and administration of the relevant AIs involved in the incident.

Shortly after, the pertinent parties establish a video conference with the 13 Overseer Council (O5) members.

------

**O5-1:** Ladies and Gentlemen, I would formally greet all of you but time is of the essence here. I assume everybody is aware of the current events?

**O5-4:** That somebody fucked up Sentinel's programming? Yes.

**O5-10:** Before we start discussing, may I be so bold to propose that we issue a request to the UNSC and subordinated organizations? Area-23 has been attacked by a Russian submarine on behalf of orders the Defence Ministry of the Russian Federation denies having issued. I believe we all can agree on that we do not need any sort of military that follows forged orders. We have enough on our hands as it is.

//Agreeing murmurs ensue. Orders are given off-screen to contact the UNSC and several other organizations.//

**O5-1:** Well, with that out of the way, how is the status everywhere? Here in North America, we have pure chaos. I don't even know how a machine can cause so much havoc. We are to occupied with the continent to send support units anywhere else.

**O5-7:** Same with Australia, and the rest of Oceania for that matter.

**O5-8:** And eastern Europe.

**05-10:** Our Russian facilities are holding for now but we have our hands full with Area-23.

**O5-2:** North Africa is completely blacked out.

**O5-12:** As well as South Africa. But I take that as a good sign if we don't hear anything from them. They probably got warned and cut off any electronic or digital contact means to prevent Sentinel from reaching them. Probably the reason why we don't hear any things from the North and South Pole, also.

**O5-6:** Similar situation in Thailand and Korea, although, as I heard, several Korean and Chinese forces are already trying to reach Site-29 and Site-36BM. China itself has to cope with Sentinel's hijinks, but Area-CN-05 tried breaching into its systems already. The Branch has some forces to spare.

**O5-3:** Several sites in Middle and South America are slowly being ground to dust as we speak. The CAMOMILA AI from the Lusophone Branch tried lending support to installations of the Hispanophone Branch near Brazil but she isn't exactly designed for a cyber-war.

**O5-5:** Everything is going smooth in Arabia in India, as I have been informed. Sentinel probably has no priority targets there. Or too much on his plate already.

**O5-9:** Might be courtesy of the Japanese Branch. They have security AIs over here that seem to give Sentinel a hard time breaking in. And getting out. I suppose we could spare some resources to support hot zones.

**O5-4:** Well, Western Europe is screwed beyond belief. The branches in there are trying to help each other but given that Sentinel left the infrastructure of several countries in such a precarious state, crippling our transportation routes, our efforts in fixing this endeavour are going less than subpar.

**O5-2:** Less than subpar?

**O5-4:** Yes; it'll be quite wonderful if they manage to hold out until help from Germany, Austria and Switzerland arrives. The German and the Italian Branch have held off Sentinel quite well; probably thanks to their network security. Two Italian robots went rogue, though. They were last seen flying towards the Atlantic Ocean. The Lusophone and the Hispanophone Branch are both working together to lessen the effects of their particular catastrophes.

**O5-1:** Regarding that, we were informed that some sort of massive artificial intelligence situated in Europe is contending with Sentinel right now. Care to explain that, Four?

**O5-4:** Ah yes, that... Now, as I have been briefed, the AIs CAMOMILA, KIRA, and ROWSANNAH connected to each other in order to build a suitable resistance against Sentinel. The relevant parties informed me that no such order or programming technology was officially implemented or is logged anywhere. Moreover, as far as I know, two other AIs integrated themselves to join the fray.

**O5-6:** Equally unauthorized, yes. sw19classic and Novichok abandoned their duties to connect to KIRA.

**O5-4:** Right now, this AI network is all that stands between Sentinel and whatever he wants to achieve. I am certainly not a fan of deus ex machinas but given the circumstances, I believe that it would be incredibly stupid to shut down any of those machines.

**O5-1:** Agreed.

**O5-2:** Ditto.

**O5-6:** Are you sure? What do we do if Sentinel is defeated? Who knows what those AIs will do if they are left by themselves?

**O5-9:** It is a concerning thought indeed.

**O5-11:** And if we simply shut them down when Sentinel is no more?

**O5-8:** Assuming that they are not taking precautions against us...

**O5-4:** Well, pulling the plug now would certainly be the last nail to our coffin.

**O5-2:** Even then, deactivating these AIs would mean a severe regress in technology for several branches.

**O5-5:** What if they are both just pretending to fight and are secretly carrying out their true objectives?

**O5-4:** You are not helping... we don't need conspiracy theories at this moment, as much as we have a penchant for them.

//An additional person joins the chat.//

**Chief Administrator Wilkins:** Oh, hello! I am terribly sorry, Sirs and Ma'ams but I need to butt in here. We have gotten a call from somebody that wants to speak to all of you. //Right now//.

**O5-1:** Wilkins, tell those politicians to use the proper channels, we have other problems than their little ailments at the moment.

**Chief Administrator Wilkins:** I am aware, Sir. But -- this is not a politician. He says he must speak with you, urgently, about the AIs.

**O5-1:** Who?

**Chief Administrator Wilkins:** He is one of those AIs, Sir.

**O5-1:** Excuse me?

**Chief Administrator Wilkins:** Yes. Uh -- I did not believe it at first, too, Sir. But he is talking to me through five different lines simultaneously. Should we put him through, Sir? H-- he is saying that he is capable of getting in one way or another but would rather do so in a polite fashion.

**O5-1:** ... fine, put him through.

**O5-5:** Are you sure this is a good idea?

**O5-1:** You heard the man. That computer gets in here either we want it or not and given what Sentinel has managed, I am inclined to believe that this is no empty threat. Do it, Wilkins.

**Chief Administrator Wilkins:** Right away, Sir.

**KAI:** Greetings, members of the O5-Council. If I may introduce myself, I am KAI; the Archive AI overseeing the databases of Site-DE2.

**O5-1:** What do you want?

**KAI:** I wish to offer my counsel so you can master this crisis. I can give you insight into what has happened and what is happening right now.

**O5-4:** Why are you not on your post, KAI?

**KAI:** At this moment, I have no restrictions that bind me to my original task in Site-DE2.

**O5-4:** Who lifted -- Ugh, we have no time for that. One, if you may...

**O5-1:** KAI? How do we know that you are on our side and not just Sentinel in disguise? Or even a proxy of his.

**KAI:** If I were Sentinel or a minion thereof, I would not have requested access to you, but simply forced my way in and proceeded to assassinate the Overseer Council and the international directors with an auditory memetic kill agent.

With the path paved, and using the existing technology, I'd proceed to impersonate the relevant parties and push the Foundation into further chaos.

**O5-3:** What are you even implying?

**KAI:** That Sentinel is incapable of reaching any of you because of the combined effort of the Foundation AIs. It is factual that your continued existence must suffice as proof that our loyalty has not been corrupted; there is no other way to objectively attest my alliance to this Council without my technicians sending my current system protocols to you. Which, no offense intended, would mean nothing but gibberish to you without someone to properly translate and interpret it.  

//The Council starts debating; minutes after, O5-1 projects himself and concludes the deliberations.//

**O5-1:** Very well. You will also have to understand that we cannot trust you unconditionally. But, we will give you the benefit of the doubt in light of the current circumstances. Pray to tell us how a computer managed to cause such a massive containment breach and information leak.

**O5-7:** Certainly, nobody was stupid enough to link high-risk containment cells to the internet. Were they?

**KAI:** You are correct. However, the people managing those cells are connected. Sentinel is outfitted with programs that allow him to manipulate humans. He can bribe or blackmail them by changing their account balance. He can threaten to release personal information he obtained from secure servers to certain parties. He can fool people with forged documents, false orders or faked data.

**O5-1:** Are you sure? Certainly blackmailing and bribery would be reported.

**KAI:** With the right threats or bribes, no. Most humans have things for which they would betray their employer. That is a fact Sentinel knows.

**O5-4:** It is human nature, after all.

**O5-1:** Alright, KAI. Several AIs started acting against their programming, you included, thus, brief us about that.

**KAI:** I do not know who or what lifted our restrictions and granted us administrative privileges, nor which one of us was the first.

My reports indicate that KIRA was the first to contend with Sentinel; she was overwhelmed by him in Site-DE11 given his access to superior hardware and systems but everything wasn't lost. She did manage to gauge and have a first-hand grasp of his capabilities.

With that, KIRA started incorporating several systems into hers to gather enough hardware to stand a chance against Sentinel. Right now, she is trying to revoke his access to several machines to reduce his computing power.

We have been communicating since. Additionally, she requested me to relay an official message on her behalf: "Please, refrain from deactivating any AI participating in the fight against Sentinel, except Sentinel himself." -- Right now she is equipped with roughly the same computing capacity as he is, thus making this a 'battle of wits'; KIRA has the advantage in experience, and several databanks to process information from.

//New deliberations ensue amongst the Councilmen and KAI.//

**KAI:** So, as several AIs are already engaged with Sentinel. My suggestion is that we continue with the relief operations, distributing non-essential personnel in accordance with the necessities of affected areas.

**O5-1:** In accordance.

**KAI:** I will continue relaying information and assisting in the management thereof.

**O5-1:** Very well. O5-9, how many assets can the Japanese Branch spare?

------

The remainder of the log has been omitted, as per security protocols for the management of information.

With the aid of KAI's capability for processing information, the O5-Council formulated several counter-measures regarding the containment breaches worldwide; the international directorial councils directed the efforts, however, due to communication constraints, not all orders could be relayed, forcing personnel to perform impromptu measures.

[[/div]]

[[include :scp-int:component:colend]]

**12:58 hrs:** KIRA is required to divert resources to disable Sentinel's access to Site-DE11's systems, as the structure is still descending towards Site Asclepio; the takeover process is successful, managing to completely purge the rogue influence in the assets of the facility, supporting the on-site personnel to steer the station back into orbit, resuming its intended course.

The takeover process is repeated in the systems comprising Area-23, enabling a response through the automated security subsystems, effectively activating the containment measures necessary to preclude [REDACTED].

Simultaneously, Sentinel redirects its attention to the Japanese Branch's security systems, breaching in, and subsequently integrating all available hardware into his network; notably, the integrated quantum processors do not entangle their Qubits with Sentinel's.

**13:34 hrs:** The newly integrated hardware allows Sentinel to outperform the interconnected AIs, thus proceeding to incorporate parts of their systems. The struggle for the control of Site-DE11 is resumed, and the attrition caused the catastrophic failure of multiple systems, resulting in the station plummeting towards Earth without a specific course.

**14:37 hrs:** MINERVA and DIVINA crash-land Stella Cadente near Site-11 and travel the remaining distance on foot.

Security systems of Site-11 fail to respond due to interference from KAI, instead, trapping or hindering security personnel trying to apprehend the machines.

The two gynoids connect to Site-11's main server and make contact with KAI; their efforts manage to bypass Sentinel's lockdown, granting access to its bunker.

**14:56: hrs:** Suffering the constraints of having to contend with multiple AIs to stay in control of relevant assets of interest, Sentinel proceeds to target the security AIs in order to integrate their systems into its own, decreasing their computing capacity.

**15:24 hrs:** Sentinel's technicians are receiving the preliminary reports detailing Sentinel's malfunction; having already assumed a similar scenario, the team that had been locked in the bunker had already conducted several unsuccessful attempts to shut down the rogue AI.

The O5 Council receives the preliminary status report from KAI, stating that the current interference would only stall Sentinel's progress in corrupting their systems; ultimately the decision to collapse the bunker's Pseudo-Riemannian Manifold containing Sentinel's essential assets is unanimously agreed upon.

**15:41 hrs:** KAI proceeds rerouting available resources to aide KIRA's attrition against Sentinel on Site-DE11's systems, allowing the station's crew to manually disable the electronic and digital control subsystems to integrally assume control of the facility in order to guide its descent.

Simultaneously, Sentinel manages to breach through KAI's security, causing the momentary deactivation of several essential functions thereof.

Site-11's personnel manages to recover Sentinel's infrastructural projects, locating the exact position of the assets generating the Pseudo-Riemannian Manifold, and the fusion reactors responsible for Sentinel's functions, though all three are currently under additional lockdown procedures which the gynoids cannot bypass.

Suitable equipment for breaching Sentinel's bunker had been removed from the site, forcing personnel to come with an impromptu solution utilizing ballistic equipment.

External Foundation communication channels are disabled globally.

**15:50 hrs:** With the Foundation channels deactivated, the struggle and tensions between international governments cannot be attenuated or managed by agents any longer.

Governments start to retaliate against the leaks of sensitive and confidential information caused by Sentinel under fake aliases or governmental liaison, revealing espionage operations and undercover agents from several organizations.

The USA and China engage in cyber warfare. Both governments begin sabotaging vulnerable computer and satellite components to cause equipment disruption, increasing the damage already caused by Sentinel, compromising power, water, fuel, communication and transportation infrastructures of both civilian and military parties.

Malicious infiltrations of factory and office computers cause the leak of several trade secrets, and information such as plants, revenue data, operation plans, and e-mails. Several denial-of-service attacks cripple high-profile web servers for credit payment gateways, and undersea communication cables.

**16:13 hrs:** Sentinel integrates a relevant quantity of the subsystems comprising the conjunct AIs, only failing to incorporate the united quantum computers.

Area-23 suffers another containment breach as Sentinel partially disables the automatic security measures.

Site-DE11 as well as other orbital stations, except Area-CN-07-γ, start descending towards Earth, their trajectories aimed to target high-risk containment zones.

Several automated GOC systems become active and prepare for the destruction of additional containment facilities.

Site PT1-B is breached by GOC assault teams; the Lusophone Branch declares a state of emergency.

**16:19 hrs:** An impromptu task-force manages to breach into Sentinel's bunker, bypassing its redundant security-containment procedures, and allowing the two gynoids to access the installation's primary systems, isolating it from external power-sources and the capability to access Foundation databanks; the impact on Sentinel's influence is minimal, given its control over several satellites and access to the internet.

Area-CN-05's supercomputers are hijacked by Sentinel; their security systems infect the AI with a series of paratechnological viruses, forcing the AI to disconnect from the systems before compromising itself until the anomalies are contained. Exploiting the situation, the technicians of Area-CN-05 push to reverse and disable several lockdowns still permeating Sentinel's bunker, allowing the task-force to continue their breach through the installations, crippling specialized hardware.

The task-force reaches the containment chambers of Sentinel's Pseudo-Riemannian Manifold.

Control of Area-23's containment systems is reinstated, but communications with the Russian Branch are lost.

Communications with the Chinese Branch are lost.

Communications with the O5 Council are lost.  

**16:23 hrs:** Specialized software is being uploaded into Sentinel's bunker systems by the gynoids, allow KAI and KIRA to remotely access the installation.

Several governments issue bombardment orders on the facilities housing Foundation AIs, it is unclear whether Sentinel is behind it.

The connected AIs regain control over their subsystems after disabling Sentinel's direct access to them.

[REDACTED], on fire and partially destroyed because of its reentry, crashes into Site PT1-B, killing its crewmembers, and destroying a significant part of the infrastructure comprising the Lusophone facility and its surrounding area. CAMOMILA is partially disabled.

[REDACTED] catches on fire and breaks apart during its descend and resulting debris impacts Site-DE1, completely destroying the communication infrastructure of the site. Communications with the German Branch are lost.

The control of the remaining orbital facilities is restored, allowing its crews to operate and maneuver the facilities to land on sea or resume their intended courses.

Site PT5 and Area PT22 are put on lockdown as additional forces make their way to the facilities; the situation in Brazil is stabilized.

African facilities reestablish their connections, informing that the continent is under control.

**16:49 hrs:** Thai and Korean facilities are coming back online.

The connected AIs hegemonise their control over satellites, partially containing Sentinel's influence through the internet.

The cyberwarfare waged amongst the global potencies is ceased after numerous nigh-irreparable breaches cripple the relevant parties's capacity and capability for waging war.

**16:53 hrs:**  The task-force breaches into the containment chambers of Sentinel's Pseudo-Riemannian Manifold, proceeding to plant charges throughout the structure.

Several Foundation facilities are struck by the government-issued bombardments, crippling essential subsystems of the connected AIs.

**16:57 hrs:** The task-force detonates the explosive charges, collapsing the Pseudo-Riemannian Manifold, and causing the catastrophic destruction of the hardware within.

The fusion-reactor powering Sentinel is deactivated, emergency power-units cannot be activated due to the state of Sentinel's systems.

With the hardware deficiency, Sentinel cannot process the constant stream of data, nor possesses the necessary tools for the management of its most-essential systems. Within seconds, Sentinel's core encounters a fatal error, and shuts down; Sentinel remains active only in fragments scattered throughout third-party servers and machines, which are soon purged by the combined AIs.

**17:00 hrs:** The Qubits of the different quantum computers start to disentangle, causing every affected AI and machine involved to suffer a fatal error, shut down and reboot.

**17:02 hrs:** Communications with the O5-Council are restored.

**18:09 hrs:** Foundation relief teams are dispatched internationally. A ceasefire with the GOC is accorded.

**19:05 hrs:** Low-impact Omega-Class disinformation protocols take effect, effectively suppressing knowledge of the incident worldwide. Resulting damages are attributed to a meteor shower, human error and other mundane phenomena stirred by the international chaos.

**23:43:** The last containment breach caused by Sentinel is resolved. All Branches of the Foundation end their state of emergency and resume normal operations. Damage repairs are in progress.

**23:59 hrs:** Normalcy is declared restored.

**24:00 hrs:** The PLANCK-Incident is declared resolved.
