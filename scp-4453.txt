**Item #:** SCP-4453

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4453 is contained at Site-92. Site-92 is to be manned by no fewer than four security staff at any time, who will pose as SCP-4453’s personal staff and employees to conceal the true function of Site-92 from the general public. SCP-4453 is permitted to make short excursions from Site-92 to nearby towns, provided it does not attempt to reveal its anomalous nature, does not stray more than one hundred kilometres from Site-92, does not stay away from Site-92 overnight and only travels when accompanied by at least one member of security staff.

Only personnel who score at least an 85 or above on the Sanders-Deusken Marital Happiness Scale are permitted to visit or hold positions at Site-92. Staff are encouraged to apply for positions at Site-92 alongside their spouse. Under no circumstances are staff who have committed adultery permitted to hold positions at Site-92. Because of this, potential staff are permitted to excuse themselves from consideration for this assignment without explanation.

Staff are not to attempt to contain SCP-4453 with physical restraints or violence. All prospective Site-92 staff must receive training in non-violent de-escalation techniques and emotional co-regulation, and must be familiar with SCP-4453’s Crisis Management Plan. No staff besides SCP-4453’s assigned psychiatrists are to mention or be drawn into conversations about SCP-4453’s family. In the event of a breach of the Covenant XLIX Agreement, Foundation staff are to prioritise maintaining the agreement over asserting Foundation authority or attempting punitive actions against SCP-4453.

In order to encourage SCP-4453 to remain on the premises during containment breaches, the wine required to fulfil the Foundation’s terms of the Covenant XLIX Agreement is to be kept in a locked on-site wine cellar. In the event of SCP-4453 accessing this cellar, staff are to immediately contact its assigned psychiatrist.

SCP-4453 is permitted to access the internet through devices it owns, as long as this access is monitored by the Foundation and complies with the Covenent XLIX Agreement. SCP-4453 mainly uses this connection to run a family advice blog and associated social media accounts, and to watch videos posted to the Youtube channel run by SCP-4453-3.

Site-92’s roof is to be fitted with no fewer than six Type-8 Scranton Reality Anchors (the lightning rod subtype). These are to be disguised as extraneous chimneys, weather vanes and satellite dishes.


**Description:** SCP-4453 claims to be the Greek goddess Hera. It is an Omega-class reality-warping entity. It is capable of assuming whatever form it so desires, but typically appears as a silver-haired 50 year old Mediterranean woman standing 1.6 metres in height.

SCP-4453 is immortal, ageless and indestructible. It is also capable of altering reality within its presence according to its will. SCP-4453 typically does not use its powers, except when it has to protect its own existence or when it is experiencing periods of high stress.

Due to the difficulties inherent in containing such an entity, the Foundation and SCP-4453 have entered into the Covenant XLIX Agreement. The agreement was negotiated and drafted in 2003. As long as the Foundation has maintained the terms of the agreement and assisted SCP-4453 with emotional co-regulation and de-escalation, SCP-4453 has remained in Foundation custody.

SCP-4453 is a goddess of family. It has knowledge of the families of anyone within its presence, who those families are, the location of each member of that family and the nature of their relationship. On occasion, SCP-4453 has offered advice to Foundation staff regarding marriage and child rearing. Staff are encouraged to take this advice as SCP-4453 enjoys being seen as an authority on family relationships.

SCP-4453 regards its containment as a “vacation” or “sabbatical” away from its own family, particularly its husband (hereafter referred to as SCP-4453-1), its other siblings, its two children (referred to as SCP-4453-2 and -3) and its daughter-in-law (referred to as SCP-4453-4). 

SCP-4453 has a pathological hatred of adulterers. Due to its nature, SCP-4453 can sense if a person has engaged in adultery upon entering its presence, and it can sense if anyone within that person’s family has engaged in adultery against them. When she personally encounters an adulterer, SCP-4453 becomes enraged, typically vaporising them or inflicting what it considers to be an “ironic” punishment. Its assigned staff psychiatrists have recently achieved some success in persuading it to undo these, but their success is far from assured.

Per the Covenant XLIX Agreement, the Foundation provides SCP-4453 with four litres of spiced red wine every week. In times of high stress, SCP-4453 will typically binge drink the wine it has been provided. Upon running out, SCP-4453 would formerly breach containment in order to seek more. To encourage it to remain on Site-92 premises, Foundation staff have filled the Site-92 wine cellar with the kind of wine preferred by SCP-4453 so that it will go there instead of fleeing the Site-92 premises. This cellar is typically kept locked by Site-92 staff and SCP-4453 does not have free access to it, however it has broken in during times of high stress in order to access more than its allowed four litres.

> **Interviewed:** SCP-4453
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Bianchi
> 
> **Foreword:** An excerpt from SCP-4453’s weekly interview with its assigned psychiatrist, Dr. Bianchi, dated 23/4/2018
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Bianchi:** I’m glad to hear your blog is going so well, Hera. I know it’s a sore subject for you, but I was wondering if we could discuss your family today, as well.
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Why? They aren’t relevant to anything.
> 
> **Bianchi:** I know your family is important to you. I know you’re a goddess of family. But your family also seems to be a source of considerable stress for you. You never talk about them. It's okay if you don’t want discuss the issue, I’m just… opening the door, if you did want to talk about them.
> 
> **SCP-4453:** I…
> 
> //Silence for seven seconds.//
> 
> **SCP-4453:** It would be nice to talk to someone who understands.
> 
> **Bianchi:** Alright. I’m glad you feel comfortable enough to talk. Why don’t you start? What is it about your family you’d like to talk about?
> 
> **SCP-4453:** I… I have a complicated relationship. With my husband.
> 
> **Bianchi:** Complicated how?
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Well, popular myths and knowledge about him are incomplete at best. He is more than the god of sky and thunder. He is the king of the gods, and the god of kings. God of rulers and priests and hospitality. To him all tributes are owed. He is, fundamentally, a god of power. A god of taking what he wants and getting what he wants. He’s also the cheatingest son of a bitch on the planet. And my biological brother.
> 
> **Bianchi:** That’s… unfortunate. You married your brother? I understand if your values are different from those of we mere mortals-
> 
> **SCP-4453:** No, it's gross for us too.
> 
> **Bianchi:** Oh. 
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Long ago, after we first triumphed against our father, it was the first time we were truly free to reach out and assume our places in the cosmos. My would-be husband became our liege and our ruler by dint of his nature. He sought me out as his bride. In my own way, I too am a goddess of power. Mine is a feminine power, the power of a woman holds in the household. The power a mother holds over a young life, shaping it, cultivating it and growing it. The responsibility and influence that comes with being the one others depend on for succor and support. Women’s work is the backbone of humanity and I am the goddess of that work. He was drawn to me, and I to him. 
> 
> **Bianchi:** I see.
> 
> **SCP-4453:** I was drawn to him because he was a fitting match for me, as a god of masculine power. He was drawn to me because I was the goddess of a kind of power he did not possess. It is an intrinsic part of his nature to hunger for more. To demand more. To desire dominion over all things.
> 
> **Bianchi:** And that hunger applies to his sex life?
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Yes. Once he had me under his thumb he spared not a thought for me. He hungers for other women. He wants things he should not have, because desiring them and taking them is an intrinsic part of his nature.
> 
> **Bianchi:** He sounds like a terrible husband.
> 
> **SCP-4453:** He is.
> 
> **Bianchi:** Well, have you perhaps thought of leaving him?
> 
> //A snapping noise sounds throughout the room. The lights dim and SCP-4453 darkens, while simultaneously glowing a red light. It rises from its seated position.//
> 
> **SCP-4453:** How dare you?! You would insult me, the queen of the gods?!
> 
> **Bianchi:** I’m sorry! I meant no insult. Please forgive me. I am simply trying to understand you and your situation.
> 
> //The lights in the room resume their normal function. SCP-4453 ceases glowing and returns to its seat. It is silent for five seconds.//
> 
> **SCP-4453:** I am… sorry too. I should not have gotten angry. It’s just… I am a wife and mother. I am the goddess of the very idea of the wife and mother. I have a duty to stand by my husband as his wife, no matter what. “Until death do us part” is an ancient and sacred tradition. To abandon him would be an unforgivable stain on my honor as a woman.
> 
> **Bianchi:** So you are honor-bound to remain at his side?
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Yes.
> 
> **Bianchi:** Though he frequently dishonors you with his infidelity?
> 
> //SCP-4453 straightens in its chair.//
> 
> **SCP-4453:** My husband’s conduct… I have no control over him. And his deeds reflect on him as much as me. It is more important that I remain the devoted spouse, so that if he ever returns my faithfulness we will be the perfect husband and wife.
> 
> **Bianchi:** That… Forgive me, but that doesn’t sound like it’s going to work.
> 
> **SCP-4453:** No.
> 
> **Bianchi:** As you said yourself, his very nature is to want more than what you offer. But you can’t leave him because it’s your nature to strive to be the perfect wife and mother.
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Yes! Exactly!
> 
> **Bianchi:** It must cause you a great amount of stress, to be the goddess of family and have your own family so disordered.
> 
> //SCP-4453 grimaces and places its head in its hands.//
> 
> **SCP-4453:** You have no idea. The Olympic Council is made up of the most prominent of our number. Out of the ten others who sit upon it, seven of them are his children, but only two of them are mine. My nature means I am constantly aware of every member of my own family, including all his bastard brats. He has fathered hundreds of them. They rasp at me like sandpaper on bare skin.
> 
> **Bianchi:** I see.
> 
> //Silence for four seconds//
> 
> **Bianchi:** You know, the Foundation would doubtless be interested in meeting your husband's other children. Could you… introduce us?
> 
> //Silence for three seconds.//
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Why, yes. Would you like to know where all of them are, right now?
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** As a result of this interview, the Foundation took into custody ██ anomalous individuals. ██ evaded capture by Foundation operatives and are being pursued by MTF Eta-3 (“Rattenfangers”).

> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Bianchi
> 
> **Foreword:** An excerpt from SCP-4453’s weekly interview with its assigned psychiatrist, Dr. Bianchi, dated 2/5/2018
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
>  
> **Bianchi:** I’m glad to hear you’re enjoying the wine, Hera. I was wondering if we could talk about something you brought up last week?
> 
> **SCP-4453:** What would that be?
> 
> **Bianchi:** You mentioned having two children of your own?
> 
> //Silence for four seconds.//
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Yes. Ares and Hephaestus.
> 
> **Bianchi:** I’m sorry, is something wrong?
> 
> **SCP-4453:** No. Well, yes. There is always something wrong, Helen. But… I think it would be nice to talk to someone about it. I haven’t really had anyone to speak to about these things and after last week’s session I felt better than I had in… a while.
> 
> **Bianchi:** I’m glad to hear you’re benefiting from these sessions. Please, start wherever you would like.
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Well, I suppose I should start with my eldest. Ares. 
> 
> //Silence for eight seconds.//
> 
> **SCP-4453:** I’m sorry, I’m having trouble thinking of how I should say this.
> 
> **Bianchi:** Please, take as long as you need. We’re not on a time limit. If you need time to consider how to put your feelings into words…
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Yes, thank you.
> 
> //Silence for four seconds.//
> 
> **SCP-4453:** I am his mother, and I love him. He is my eldest son and heir. It is my sworn duty to protect him, cherish him, and love him. As his mother I cannot do anything less. To even speak ill of him is…
> 
> **Bianchi:** A betrayal?
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Yes. Not just of him, but of my nature.
> 
> **Bianchi:** If you do not feel up to speaking, we can-
> 
> **SCP-4453:** He… takes after his father.
> 
> **Bianchi:** Oh. 
> 
> //SCP-4453 sighs.//
> 
> **SCP-4453:** People call him the god of war. Or, one of the gods of war. I’d like to talk about that as well. But for now, know my eldest son is not a god of war. He is the son of the god of power, and so he is the god of violence. Of power being used to overpower the unwilling, being used to violate people physically or cow them with the threat of such. He is the god of muggings, of prison shankings, of domestic violence, of rape. He is the god of large men taking what they want from those too weak to stop them. The god of thugs.
> 
> **Bianchi:** I see… so he is almost a distilled version of the traits you dislike most about your husband? His “taking what he wants”?
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Yes! That’s it. Every time I look at Ares… I see //him//.
> 
> **Bianchi:** That’s very unfortunate, Hera. 
> 
> **SCP-4453:** He’s… also something of a disappointment. 
> 
> **Bianchi:** Really?
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Everyone refers to him as a god of war but he’s never been the most revered war god in our pantheon. That goes to his half-sister, Athena. She’s held in high esteem as a patron of mighty heroes and has one of the greatest cities in all of Greece named after her. The most well-known story that mentions him, on the other hand, is a tale of how one of her mortal champions drove him from the fields of Troy. A god of violence, defeated and sent running!
> 
> **Bianchi:** Huh. I had heard he had a city serving him as well, Sparta if I remember?
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Yes, and what happened to that? Oh, it was obliterated two thousand years ago by Visigoths, who were honestly doing it a favour after it spent several hundred years licking the boots of the scions of Troy. Then the Ottomans built a town full of peasants nearby and gave it the same name two centuries ago. That was swallowed up in 2011 when it was merged with several larger towns to form a single precinct. Destroyed by municipal bureaucracy! Meanwhile, her city not only still exists, it’s the capital of the entire country!
> 
> **Bianchi:** I see. So he is your son, the son of the king and queen of the gods, but he’s overshadowed by one of your husband’s illegitimate children?
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Yes!
> 
> **Bianchi:** Well, that must upset you. I hope you don’t mind me saying this but you seem like a proud woman. It sounds like you’re upset that your own son, who you bore, is less revered than one of your husband’s illegitimate children.
> 
> //Silence for five seconds.//
> 
> **Bianchi:** I’m sorry if that was too far-
> 
> **SCP-4453:** No. By Kronos, that’s exactly right. Except that’s not the only thing.
> 
> **Bianchi:** Yes?
> 
> **SCP-4453:** He… is having an affair. With his brother’s wife. With her.
> 
> //Silence for three seconds.//
> 
> **Bianchi:** Ah.
> 
> //Silence for four seconds//
> 
> **Bianchi:** Would you-
> 
> **SCP-4453:** I am his mother! I bore him in my womb! He suckled from my bosom! I raised him! Yet he dishonors me! He repays the kindness of his mother, the goddess of family, by violating that family, with his brother’s wife! Within our own family! It is a betrayal as stark and painful as those of my husband! It tears at me! Like a dagger though my stomach!
> 
> //The lights in the room begin to flicker.//
> 
> **Bianchi:** I am truly sorry to hear that, Hera. I can see this topic of conversation is upsetting you, we can stop if-
> 
> //The lights in the room cease flickering.//
> 
> **SCP-4453:** No, it's… that’s all I wanted to say about him. I just…. damn it.
> 
> **Bianchi:** Here.
> 
> //Dr Bianchi passes SCP-4453 a tissue box//
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Thank you dear.
> 
> //Conversation pauses for eight seconds.//
> 
> **Bianchi:** If you want, we can change the subject. You mentioned your other son just now? Hephaestus? I understand you’ve been using the internet we provide to watch his internet videos?
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Yes. That Youtube channel of his, “Twisted Metal Forging”. 
> 
> //SCP-4453 chuckles.//
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Of course he would embrace that name. Honestly, I’m glad he’s been so successful. Did you see his beard? That can’t be safe in a forge, but it suits him. A lot more than it does my husband.
> 
> **Bianchi:** Yes. I heard he had over a million watchers?
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Oh, I wouldn’t know. I barely know how Twitter works. I’m just glad he’s happy, even if it’s only while he’s far from me.
> 
> **Bianchi:** I’m sorry, is there bad blood with him as well?
> 
> **SCP-4453:** No. Well, yes. Sort of. I…
> 
> //Silence for four seconds.//
> 
> **SCP-4453:** It was my fault.
> 
> //Silence for three seconds.//
> 
> **SCP-4453:** When he was born… There’s a reason incest is somewhat taboo for us as well. When he was born, he… he came out wrong. I made him wrong.
> 
> //Silence for four seconds.//
> 
> **SCP-4453:** I was angry. At myself… and at him. I had wanted another child of my own. Zeus already had several bastards, but when we tried… when I could get him to try… it would end badly. Because we were siblings. I wanted another one to show I was a mother goddess, that I was his wife. Also... I wanted one like me, one who I could look at without seeing their father. Perhaps even a daughter.
> 
> **SCP-4453:** When he came out… twisted… I was distraught. I could hear his whores snickering at me through the walls. I was a mother goddess and I couldn’t even bear a proper child.
> 
> **SCP-4453:** I… struck him. I cast him out, abandoning him to die alone, as the Spartans did. I refused to even look upon him for many years.
> 
> **SCP-4453:** It was only later I realised my mistake. I was his mother, I should have acted like one. Instead I shunned him. He came into the world crying and looking for the warmth of a mother and found only cold and rejection. My child needed me and I betrayed him. It wasn’t until he was a grown man, marching into the halls of his father, that I was re-united with him. His father was thrilled. So thrilled he offered him the hand of the most beautiful woman among us as a bride to ensure his loyalty.
> 
> **Bianchi:** And that was when he was married to-
> 
> **SCP-4453:** The whore. Yes.
> 
> **Bianchi:** It sounds like you really regret how you treated him when he was younger.
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Yes. I do. If I could, I would go back and change things. But that is one of the few things I cannot do. Even now, years later, he has not forgiven me. I don’t blame him.
> 
> **Bianchi:** I’m very sorry to hear this, Hera. I can see this is something you feel a great deal of grief over. I am here for you.
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Thank you.
> 
> //Silence for twelve seconds. SCP-4453 takes several more tissues. The session ends shortly after this.// 
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** After this session, SCP-4453 returned to its chambers and consumed the rest of its week’s allocated supply of wine over the course of an hour and a half. Shortly afterwards, SCP-4453 breached the on-site wine cellar. Dr. Bianchi was called in to console SCP-4453 and return it to normal functioning per the Crisis Management Plan.

>

> 
> **<Begin Log>**
>  
> **Bianchi:** I’m glad to hear you were able to help them. Your blog has been an excellent way for you to utilise your talents as a goddess of family.
> 
> **SCP-4453:** I know! I considered starting one of those television shows, but I always found them somewhat ghastly, playing up a family’s troubles for drama and ratings. This has been so much better.
> 
> **Bianchi:** I also wanted to speak with you about your family some more today, if that’s alright.
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Yes, that’s fine. I don’t mind speaking of them with you, it's been… helpful to be able to talk about these things.
> 
> **Bianchi:** Yes. I understand you’ve been carrying these feelings, these regrets and stresses, around inside you for quite some time. It doesn’t seem like you’ve had anyone else you could really be open with.
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Well, yes. My husband has never really been understanding.
> 
> **Bianchi:** But what about other places you could turn? Friends?
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Friends?
> 
> **Bianchi:** Yes, friends. Peers you are not related with, who you have familiarity, or even an emotional connection.
> 
> **SCP-4453:** I…. I have always been a private person.
> 
> **Bianchi:** Ah. Not normally one for sharing your feelings with others?
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Yes. It would reflect poorly on my marriage to air our dirty laundry like some washerwoman.
> 
> **Bianchi:** I see. But you’ve mentioned there were twelve gods on the Olympic Council. Seven of your husband's children, you, and him... what of the other three?
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Hmph. Poseidon, Demeter and… the whore?
> 
> **Bianchi:** Well, from what you’ve said about her I assume you don’t have a high opinion of Aphrodite. But what about the other two? They are your siblings, correct? As is Hades?
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Yes, though I am loathe to admit it.
> 
> **Bianchi:** Oh? Not on speaking terms with them?
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Hardly. The god of the seas, horses and being second-best is as big of an adulterer as my husband. He’s been cheating on Amphitrite for as long as they’ve been married, with as many mistresses as he could lure into bed with him.
> 
> **Bianchi:** So he takes after his brother then?
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Yes.
> 
> **Bianchi:** What about Demeter? I know I could turn to my sisters for support when I was growing up.
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Demeter is a harlot. She had an affair with my husband behind my back, and bore a daughter from it, the goddess of Spring. He then raped the girl, and she bore a child herself, the god of Madness. They both sit on the Olympic Council.
> 
> **Bianchi:** Oh. Your family certainly is….
> 
> **SCP-4453:** A disgustingly incestuous mess?
> 
> **Bianchi:** I was going to say “complicated”.
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Yes, well, Persephone is now married to my other sibling, the god of the dead. I haven’t seen or heard from him in… gods, millennia now.
> 
> **Bianchi:** Really? Why’s that?
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Because he washed his hands of all of us and pointedly ignores any attempt to be lured out of his underworld. He doesn’t even sit the Council any more. Ever since my husband assaulted his wife he’s avoided us, staying out of Olympic affairs, spending his days ensuring the smooth running of the land of the dead. He’s a quiet, unassuming bureaucrat now, dedicated to his wife and her son.
> 
> **Bianchi:** That’s… sweet? I guess.
> 
> **SCP-4453:** It is. They are the closest thing to a healthy family in our pantheon, and he is married to his niece, who bore his nephew within her.
> 
> **Bianchi:** Well I suppose… love is like that, sometimes?
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Yes. Love.
> 
> **Bianchi:** Ah, I did not mean to bring up-
> 
> **SCP-4453:** The love between a man and wife. Or mother and child.
> 
> **Bianchi:** We do not need to talk about her if you wish, I can see you find it-
> 
> **SCP-4453:** No. We have talked about everyone else. We may as well discuss that prostitute.
> 
> **Bianchi:** Very well. What is it you would like to-
> 
> **SCP-4453:** She’s NOT the goddess of love. I’M the goddess of love. I am the goddess of man and wife. Of mother and child. It is MY domain, and mine alone. True love is knowing! On seeing someone at their highest and at their lowest and knowing both! On knowing their quirks, their strangenesses, their habits. It’s about seeing pieces of them no-one else looks closely enough to see. It’s about knowing how they think! The true shape of them! It’s about seeing all they are and accepting them unreservedly! Loving them!
> 
> **SCP-4453:** She STOLE that from me! She’s not the goddess of love. She’s the goddess of… of… baseless fantasy! She is the goddess of empty pining, of loving the idea of a person without actually knowing them. True love does not last an hour or a day, it lasts for decades! If you do not love them when they dispel your illusions then you never loved them at all! That’s what she’s the goddess of! Fantasies, daydreams, reflections, empty promises! She’s the goddess of lying to oneself! Of being destroyed by foolish dreams!
> 
> **Bianchi:** Wow, she sounds-
> 
> **SCP-4453:** And she stole love from me! 
> 
> //SCP-4453 stands from its chair and begins pacing the room. The lights in the interview room begin flickering.//
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Ask any mortal who the goddess of love is, and they’ll say her! Not me! Her, some adulterous harlot! She married my son, my poor boy, and betrayed him! Betrayed him over and over! She still betrays him! With his very brother no less! It tears at him, I can feel it, and she cares not! It tears at me! She is the daughter-in-law of the goddess of family but she tears at that family with her every act!
> 
> //The glass windows of the interview room begin to crack. SCP-4453’s wine glass begins to shake and vibrate. Outside, a cloud covers the sun. SCP-4453's voice begins to echo.//
> 
> **Bianchi:** Hera-
> 
> **SCP-4453:** And she enjoys it! She loves it! It is her nature! Foolish pining leading to self-destruction! She strings both my sons along, subverting them and MY FAMILY for her own benefit! THAT BITCH!
> 
> //The windows in the room and SCP-4453’s wine glass explode, sending shards of glass everywhere. Dr. Bianchi suffers a number of shallow cuts to her forearms and torso as she shields her face with her arms.//
> 
> **SCP-4453:** THAT CONNIVING, SCHEMING, SLITHERING LITTLE-
> 
> **Bianchi:** Hera please you’re scaring me.
> 
> **SCP-4453:** What? Oh. Here.
> 
> //The cloud over the sun passes and the lights cease flickering. SCP-4453 gestures towards Dr. Bianchi. All of the cuts she suffered because of the broken glass disappear without trace. SCP-4453’s voice returns to normal.//
> 
> **SCP-4453:** I think that’s enough for today dear. We will talk again next week.
> 
> //SCP-4453 exits the room quickly, without waiting for a response from Dr. Bianchi. Dr. Bianchi remains seated for another fifty seconds, breathing heavily, until two members of on-site security arrive to investigate the disturbance. Dr. Bianchi remains seated for another minute as security officers begin gathering the shards of broken glass and examining her arms. Dr. Bianchi is escorted from the room by a security officer once enough glass has been cleared away that it is safe to do so.// 
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** In the aftermath of this report, Dr. Bianchi reported that in addition to the cuts on her torso and arms, a number of other scars and physical defects had disappeared, including the scars from her caesarean and breast cancer surgeries. She also reported that she began experiencing menstruation again, and no longer suffered from insomnia.

> __**Site 92 Incident Log**__
>  
> __**Incident 43/D**__
> 
> **Date:** 9/5/2018
> 
> **Incident:** Approximately three hours after an interview with her prescribed psychiatrist that ended prematurely, SCP-4453 had an altercation with Officer ███████, a member of Site 92’s security staff. Upon encountering Officer ███████ in a hallway, SCP-4453 accused Officer ███████ of “wandering eyes” and contemplating sexual encounters with a man besides her husband. SCP-4453 then [REDACTED]. When questioned by other members of staff about Officer ███████’s location, it replied that it had “sent her somewhere she would be put to use.”
> 
> Although SCP-4453 was initially resistant to entreaties by staff to undo this, Dr. Bianchi was called in for an emergency session on 10/5/2018. After some discussion, SCP-4453 returned Officer ███████ to Site-92 and restored her human form. SCP-4453 apologised and expressed regret for its actions, saying it “had not been thinking straight”.
> 
> Officer ███████ was placed on psychiatric leave. Two weeks later, Officer ███████ requested that she be allowed to resign her position as a Foundation Security Officer and be given a full amnestic treatment. This request was granted.
> 
> __**Incident 49/E**__
> 
> **Date:** 29/05/2018
> 
> **Incident:** On 28/05/2018 at 6.30pm an MTF Eta-2 operation was ambushed by SCP-4453-1. SCP-4453-1 [REDACTED]. The entire task force was relocated to a Foundation medical facility but staff discovered the changes were irreversible; even reconstructive plastic surgery would gradually “reverse” and return staff members to their afflicted state over the course of a few hours. All members were immediately placed on medical leave. The facility’s on-site gynaecologist [REDACTED].
> 
> When Dr. Bianchi reported this to SCP-4453, it grew quiet. Dr. Bianchi assured it that the Foundation would abide by the Covenant XLIX Agreement and a new Eta-2 was being recruited. SCP-4453 said it was not upset, instead it felt partially responsible for the fates of the Eta-2 operatives. SCP-4453 said it could not undo the work of one of its family, but it could help them in other ways. SCP-4453 then [REDACTED].
> 
> Subsequently, the former Eta-2 operatives were granted the group designation SCP-████. Several of their number have since petitioned for the ability to return to the field as part of a theoretical taskforce MTF Eta-4 (“Tiresians”).
> 
> __**Incident 54/F**__
> 
> **Date:** 7/6/2018
> 
> **Incident:** At 4.45am SCP-4453 used its internet connection to send a private message to the Youtube channel Twisted Metal Forging, congratulating it on one of the builds in its latest video.
> 
> Approximately four hours later, TMF responded. It asked SCP-4453 not to contact it again and then blocked it from sending them more messages.
> 
> SCP-4453 retreated to its bedroom and began consuming its supply of wine. Its assigned psychiatrist Dr Bianchi was contacted and asked to call in.
> 
> As Dr. Bianchi was arriving on-site at 9.15am, SCP-4453 breached the wine cellar. Dr. Bianchi used active listening and emotional co-regulation to assist SCP-4453 and return it to normal functioning. 
> 
> __**Incident 60/G**__
> 
> **Date:** 23/6/2018
> 
> **Incident:** Shortly after awakening at 7am, SCP-4453 began threatening a member of its on-site security staff, Officer ████████, and accusing him of marital infidelity. Officer ████, Officer ████████’s wife, engaged SCP-4453 and distracted it long enough for Officer ████████ to be removed from the site. When asked when Officer ████████ had committed adultery, SCP-4453 became evasive and retreated to its room. It began consuming large amounts of wine. Per its Crisis Management Plan, its assigned psychiatrist was contacted.
> 
> Shortly afterwards, SCP-4453 breached the wine cellar. Dr. Bianchi arrived and began using emotional co-regulation and active listening to assist SCP-4453 in returning to normal functioning. She asked SCP-4453 why it had accused Officer ████████ of infidelity, noting that he had been posing as its gardener and working with it since it first entered Foundation custody. SCP-4453 admitted that Officer ████████ had not committed infidelity and had always been respectful and acted with propriety. SCP-4453 explained that the previous night it had dreamed about Officer ████████ in a romantic/sexual context, and had been projecting its feelings of shame onto him and attempting to have him removed from the Site.
> 
> SCP-4453 requested Officer ████████ be returned to Site 92. This request was granted and SCP-4453 apologised to him for its behaviour, saying it had not been in its right mind. Officer ████████ accepted SCP-4453's apology.

[[collapsible show="+ Staff Notices" hide="- Staff Notices"]]
> __**NOTICE TO ALL STAFF**__
> 
> I cannot believe I am having to issue this notice. All Foundation staff, regardless of position, are expected to conduct themselves with a high degree of professionalism. Life and death situations are part of our daily bread and butter, and any lapse in our judgement has potentially catastrophic consequences.
> 
> Which is why I find it upsetting I must ask you all to not volunteer for service at Site 92 in order to test your spouse’s fidelity. Site-92 exists to contain an Omega-class reality manipulator. Every day our staff work tirelessly to negotiate with and manage this entity, risking their lives and in some cases fates far worse than mere death, in order to protect the world and ensure the preservation of normalcy.
> 
> Our recruitment process should not be used as a marital barometer. Foundation staff found to be wasting my staff’s time in this manner from now on will face demotion and possibly removal from Foundation employ. If you suspect your spouse of infidelity you should seek a marital counsellor or a divorce lawyer, not send applications to my office.
> 
> This may seem harsh, but recent events have made it a necessity. I will not be wasting my Site’s limited resources finding the next applicant who decides to go MIA rather than admit their mistakes, I will instead request the assistance of MTF Epsilon-10 (“Manhunters”).
> 
> I cannot believe I had to send out this notice,
> 
> //Site Director Suarez//
> 
> __**Notice to All Site 92 staff**__
> 
> **Date:** 28/06/2018
> 
> As of 1/7/2018, Dr. Bianchi will be going on stress leave for a month. SCP-4453 is not to be informed of this, and is instead to be told Dr. Bianchi is taking long service leave for a trip to Vietnam and Australia.
> 
> For this time, Dr. Bisset will be SCP-4453’s assigned psychiatrist. Dr. Bisset is married but she has a wife, and is estranged from her parents. SCP-4453 was consulted and had no objections to this arrangement. However, staff should still be prepared to engage and redirect SCP-4453 should their first session go wrong.

>  
> **Bisset:** Good morning, Hera. It’s nice to finally meet you.
> 
> **SCP-4453:** I… yes, it is nice to meet you, Dr… Bisset …
> 
> //SCP-4453 stares at Dr Bisset. Silence for five seconds.//
> 
> **Bisset:** I’m sorry, is something wrong? Dr. Bianchi mentioned she checked with you about my wife before she arranged this.
> 
> **SCP-4453:** It's not... your... wife...
> 
> //SCP-4453 rises from its seated position. It begins to pace around Dr Bisset's seat, staring at her.//
> 
> **Bisset:** I'm sorry Hera, is something wrong?
> 
> //The lights in the room begin to flicker. The glass windows begin to crack. SCP-4453 visibly darkens, but simultaneously glows a red light.//
> 
> **SCP-4453:** No... No...
> 
> **Bisset:** Hera? Are you alright?
> 
> **SCP-4453:** No. No. No no no NO!
> 
> //SCP-4453 continues to darken until it is pitch black, besides its eyes and mouth, which glow red. Clouds that had not been present moments before pass over the sun. The windows and lights of the room shatter, swirling into the room and forming into a localised storm. Dr. Bisset is badly lacerated by the swirling glass.//
> 
> **Bisset:** Hera please! What did I do?
> 
> **SCP-4453:** You cannot be! Truculent child! Kidnapper! You cannot be! What witchcraft did you use? How is it you perverted your family so?
> 
> **Bisset:** Please stop! I don't understand!
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Thief! Changeling! I will not suffer your presence!
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** At this point, SCP-4453 transformed into a beam of light and exited the room, blasting the doors of their hinges. It then proceeded to breach the wine cellar and begin consuming the wine located inside.
> 
> While this occurred, Site-92 staff approached the interview room and began treating Dr. Bisset's extensive injuries to prevent exsanguination. Staff also attempted to approach SCP-4453 while she was in the wine cellar, but as she responded to their presence with threats and aggression. Staff retreated and allowed SCP-4453 to consume the wine in peace.

> 
> **Incident:**  At 5.43pm, after consuming Site-92's entire supply of red wine, SCP-4453 transformed into a beam of light and breached Site-92's security perimeter, moving in the direction of the nearby town of ███████████. 
> 
> Per Site-92's emergency plan, Site Director Suarez contacted O5 Command in case a termination attempt needed to be made to preserve consensus reality. Despite extensive injuries, SCP-4453's assigned psychiatrist Dr. Bisset volunteered to attempt to speak with SCP-4453 to return it to normal functioning. Given the extreme risks involved in engaging SCP-4453, Site Director Suarez approved the plan. Dr. Bisset and two members of Site-92's security staff retrieved a staff vehicle and drove to ███████████. 
> 
> SCP-4453 was located at 6.32pm in ███████████'s liquor store. While unescorted, SCP-4453 encountered 18 individuals it considered "unfaithful" and [REDACTED] 13 of them, vaporising the remaining five. When Dr. Bisset and the two security officers arrived at the store, they discovered SCP-4453 had transformed the store's clerk into an instance of //Sus Domesticus//, and two police officers who had responded to reports of its activities into salt statues.
> 
> SCP-4453 initially responded to Dr Bisset's presence with threats and aggression, accusing her of being unfaithful. When Dr Bisset informed SCP-4453 that she had never knowingly committed adultery, SCP-4453 stated that was not the issue. Dr. Bisset asked SCP-4453 to explain what the issue was to her, stating she and the other Foundation staff cared about SCP-4453 and were worried and frightened by her behvaiour. SCP-4453 began to respond to Dr. Bisset's attempts at emotional co-regulation.

> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Bisset:** Please Hera. I'm trying to understand. 
> 
> **SCP-4453:** It's... It wasn't your wife, doctor. I have been around for some time, I am familiar with the writings of Sappho. It's not your wife, it's your… mother.
> 
> **Bisset:** Ah yes. I was worried that would be a concern. After I came out to my parents when I was sixteen, they cut contact with me. I have tried to reach out to them since, to respect them as a good daughter should, but-
> 
> **SCP-4453:** No. Not… not your regular parents, I see you. I see your family and you… you have a second mother?
> 
> **Bisset:** Ah, I’m sorry Hera, I’m not sure I understand.
> 
> **SCP-4453:** She’s… A Tiresian? I see you marching with her at one of the rainbow parades.
> 
> **Bisset:** Wait, are you talking about ████████?
> 
> **SCP-4453:** Yes, I see that is her name.
> 
> **Bisset:** When my parents forced me out, we met when she was doing charity work. She let me stay at her apartment for a few years while I finished school and got a job to pay for college. She looked after me and supported me for all that time. I still consider her one of my closest friends. I suppose she was my “mother” in a way.
> 
> **SCP-4453:** She is your mother. I can see it. Even now you hold her in the esteem normally reserved for one’s parents. All the respect you held for... for your "birth" parents you gift to her, and she gifts you the love and guidance parents normally reserve for their children.
> 
> **Bisset:** Well… yes.
> 
> **SCP-4453:** And your daughter…
> 
> **Bisset:** You must be seeing ██████. She’s not ours. My wife and I are fostering her for a time. Her parents had problems with looking after her, they let drugs lead to neglect. So we’re giving her a stable home and three meals a day while they get their act together.
> 
> **SCP-4453:** No.
> 
> **Bisset:** No?
> 
> **SCP-4453:** She loves them as her biological parents, yes. But it is not the true relationship to a parent. The unreserved trust a child puts in their guardians, knowing that they’ll always be there to look after them, she reserves that for you and your wife. If ever she has questions or faces challenges or needs help, she will go to you. When she expects someone to provide her with a full pantry and a warm home, she expects it of you, not them. She still loves them and wishes to visit them but she does not desire to live with them again. She knows who will look after her. Who will keep her safe.

> **SCP-4453:** I...
> 
> **Bisset:** Yes?
> 
> **SCP-4453:** I would like to go home now.

> **Closing Statement:** Shortly after this, SCP-4453 returned to Site-92 with Dr. Bisset and the two security officers. SCP-4453 could not resurrect those it had vaporised but did return the 16 others to normal, and the population of ███████████ was treated with amnestics. Dr. Bisset refused SCP-4453's offer to heal her and was treated for her injuries. Site Director Suarez informed 05 Command of SCP-4453's return, nominated Dr. Bisset for a Foundation Star and arranged for one of the Foundation's legal staff to visit Site-92 the next day.
