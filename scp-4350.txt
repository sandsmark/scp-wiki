**Description:** SCP-4350 is the collective designation for the stock window panes of the eighth generation Mitsubishi Galant. When an individual looks through an SCP-4350 instance when within the city of Laurel Creek, California, USA, they will be able to perceive humanoid-shaped entities. The entities, designated SCP-4350-1, are yellow in color and estimated to be four meters tall. They can be photographed and videotaped through SCP-4350 instances. Instances of SCP-4350-1 do not possess any facial features or bodily orifices, and are thin and translucent.

Instances of SCP-4350-1 are not visible from outside SCP-4350 instances, and will phase through humans in a manner similar to a hologram. The entities can only be viewed through SCP-4350 instances. The glass will continue to reveal SCP-4350-1 instances when removed from the vehicle. 

SCP-4350-1 instances cannot be viewed through the window panes of any other motor vehicle, including older and newer Mitsubishi Galants. The number of SCP-4350-1 instances visible will vary based on the location from which they are viewed, but will not appear outside the city boundaries of Laurel Creek.

**Discovery:** On 3/30/10, Foundation Agent Charles Choudhury rented a 2003 Mitsubishi Galant after his original vehicle was stolen. When driving through Laurel Creek, Agent Choudhury reported perceiving SCP-4350-1 instances outside the vehicle. Repeated test drives by other Foundation personnel confirmed the anomaly. The vehicle was purchased from the rental car company and stored within Site-48 on 4/6/10. 

It was discovered that the windows of the vehicle are responsible for the anomaly, and not the vehicle itself. The SCP-4350 instances were removed and stored in standard containment lockers. The vehicle was fitted with alternative glass panes and is currently used as Foundation transport.

On 5/11/10, a civilian posted a video on social media taken from the inside of their vehicle. In the video, multiple SCP-4350-1 instances are present. Foundation personnel confiscated the video, replaced the SCP-4350 instances with non-anomalous glass, and administered Class-B amnestics.

> **Interviewer:** Agent Arestandos Arada
> 
> **Interviewed:** SCP-4350-1 instances
> 
> **Foreword:** Agent Arada is seated within a parked Mitsubishi Galant installed with SCP-4350 instances, facing north in the parking lot of an office complex in Laurel Creek. The vehicle is under surveillance from nearby personnel. Dashboard cameras have been set up within the cabin, facing the outside.
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Arada:** Alright, Control. I'm in the car. All of the windows are up, and I can see some... sort of yellow thing outside... on the right...
> 
> //Video feed shows an SCP-4350-1 instance standing outside, approximately seven meters east from the vehicle. Outside video feed does not display the instance.//
> 
> **Control:** Attempt to make contact with the yellow entity. 
> 
> **Arada:** Okay. //<shouting through the passenger window>// Hey, You! Yellow guy!! Over here!
> 
> //The SCP-4350-1 instance appears to be startled by the exclamation. It begins to walk towards the vehicle. Agent Arada can be heard from the outside video feed, with no instance visible.//
> 
> **Arada:** Yeah, you! Keep coming over here! I have some questions!
> 
> //The SCP-4350-1 instance stops one meter from the vehicle, and appears to bend down and peer through the right-front window.//
> 
> **Arada:** Alright, yellow guy, can you communicate with me?
> 
> //The SCP-4350-1 instance kneels down onto the ground and continues to look into the vehicle.//
> 
> **Arada:** Ow... ah... something's happening...
> 
> **Control:** Agent Arada, are you okay? What's going on?
> 
> **Arada:** I got this intrusive thought in my mind, it was like a written message, but I don't know if it's because of the yellow guy...
> 
> **Control:** What did the message say?
> 
> //Agent Arada winces again. The SCP-4350-1 instance is still present, and appears to cock its "head" to the left.//
> 
> **Arada:** I... think the message is... "Can you see us"...
> 
> **Control:** Alright, tell the entity your response.
> 
> **Arada:** //<to SCP-4350-1 instance>// Yes... I can see you, and so can anyone else looking through these windows. 
> 
> //The SCP-4350-1 instance is joined by another instance, which sits to the vehicle's left, and peers in.//
> 
> **Arada:** Ow, I'm getting another message, Control. It says: "Do you know what we are?"
> 
> **Control:** Tell them your response.
> 
> **Arada:** //<to SCP-4350-1 instances>// No, I don't know what you yellow guys are. What are you doing here? Why can I see you?
> 
> //Three more SCP-4350-1 instances gather around the vehicle.//
> 
> **Arada:** Okay, I got an answer back. It's: "You should not be able to see us." //<to SCP-4350-1 instances>// Well, I can see you now! I may not know what you are, but you guys seriously freak me out.
> 
> //The SCP-4350-1 instances continue to watch the vehicle.//
> 
> **Control:** Have you received a response?
> 
> **Arada:** Yeah, they said: "We have not seen this glass before. We must adapt to it."
> 
> //The five SCP-4350-1 instances move closer to the vehicle and stretch their "arms" forward.//
> 
> **Arada:** Whoa whoa whoa, stay back!! Control, they're closing in on me! They're getting closer to the car! 
> 
> //The SCP-4350-1 instances make contact with the vehicle. The SCP-4350 instances begin to rattle. Outside footage displays the glass rattling for no apparent reason.//
> 
> **Arada:** Control, I don't know if I should get out! I keep getting thoughts about the "new glass matrix" or something, just help!!
> 
> //The glass continues to rattle.//
> 
> **Arada:** //<to SCP-4350-1 instances>// What do you want from me?! Why are you here? Why can't people see you?!
> 
> //The SCP-4350-1 instances suddenly begin to evaporate from view of the windows.//
> 
> **Arada:** What the- they're disappearing, Control.
> 
> //The instances continue to evaporate. The SCP-4350 instances cease to rattle.//
> 
> **Arada:** Control, they're gone now. I can't see them anymore.
> 
> //No SCP-4350-1 instances can be seen through the SCP-4350 instances.//
> 
> **Control:** Exit the vehicle. We're ending the interview.

**Addendum:** Following Interview-4350, no SCP-4350-1 instances have been perceived through SCP-4350 instances despite multiple attempts. The anomaly has been classified as Neutralized on 6/1/10.

Recently completed analysis of SCP-4350 instances revealed that their chemical makeup does not match any other known glass. Further research revealed that the Mitsubishi car company produced the unique glass through an experimental technique during manufacturing. The glass was only installed in the eighth generation Mitsubishi Galant, and was discontinued due to its high price. The exact chemical makeup has not been used since.
