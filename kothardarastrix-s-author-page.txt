Dr. Carlson is not, nor has he ever been, affiliated with the Shark Punching Center in any way, shape, or form.  He will continue saying it until you believe him.  No one has ever once seen him punching a shark, and even if they did what of it?  Lots of people hate sharks!  They're dangerous and scary!  Stop looking at him like that!  He loves it here at the SPC!

No, please, he meant to say SCP, he swears!  It's an easy mistake to make!  Don't...
