[[/div]]

Yeah, yeah, okay-oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah lets go
Okay good, okay yeah, yeah-oh
Yeah that’s great, alright, good

//God, you’re gonna blow your cover! Come on! Think of something! Anything!//

**Verse 1**
[[/div]]

Umiko knows a human
I saw him one day
He was skinny and far away
Actually no he wasn’t human
He was in a box
And I didn’t see him in
It had lots of locks
To keep away other humans

//That’s an interesting rhyme scheme, Umiko. -Brook//
//It is Japanese rhyming. -Umiko//
//I thought you were from Hawaii? -Rosa//
//Uhhh... -Umiko//

He had an ugly face
But you only hear that
You never see that
You just read that
It was a secret
If you see that he would have to kill you
He come and find you


[[div style="font-size:125%;color:#000;font-family:Courier,cursive;"]]
**Chorus**
[[/div]]

Secretly

**Repeat X 10**

//Woah, what a weird tempo. Let me get my keyboard out. Let’s see, time signature? - Brook//
//Uh… 142? - Umiko//
//Really? And what? - Brook//
//...8? - Umiko//
//Klavierstücke? What the fück? Stockhausen? Umiko do you have a girlfriend? - Brook//
//Aaah! - Umiko//

**Verse 2**
[[/div]]

There’s also a business
But the business makes friends
Gets all in their business
Makes business girlfriends
Imagine a business is flirting with you
What would it say?
How may I help you?

//Wow! That’s a pretty good American accent! -Rosa//
//I practice good! How you like song, eh? -Umiko//
//Really? That’s it? We don’t want any short songs on the EP. -Brook//
//...y-yes! There’s one more! -Umiko//

**Verse 3**
[[/div]]

In my home province, they got the flu
Except it wasn’t the flu
It was something new
The people all scared, what would they do?
We asked wise woman, but wise woman slinky
She was twisty and stewed
Wise woman twisted all over the house
Her neighbors too

//Okay that’s a little gory Umi… -Rosa//
//Is only allegory! -Umiko//
//Oh! For what? -Rosa//
//...Communism! -Umiko//
//Right on! -Brook//

[[div style="font-size:125%;color:#000;font-family:Courier,cursive;"]]
**Ending Verse**
[[/div]]

There once was secret agent man
Sent to the beach with master plan
Stop crazy kooks from causing a fus
In their little volkswagen bus

But in the end he knew
That he was part of it too
And that he would sail into the sea
That is where he would always be

//Ah that’s sweet, Umiko. -Rosa//
//Huh? It’s nothing. I made the last part up. -Umiko//
