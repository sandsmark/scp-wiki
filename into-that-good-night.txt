Your gaze holds dark infinity
These galaxies of softened lights
Oh Star-Eyed Child, what will I see?

A universe in eyes empty
Where mys’try drifts and dreams unite
Your gaze holds dark infinity.

Draw me away; reveal to me—
The journey of a thousand nights
Oh Star-Eyed Child, what will I see?

Guide me towards eternity
Faraway worlds where flames ignite
Your gaze holds dark infinity.

There is much left to learn from thee
Please lead me through these cosmic sights
Oh Star-Eyed Child, what will I see?

The stars within shine peacefully
Away from strife and hidden frights
Your gaze holds dark infinity
Oh Star-Eyed Child, what will I see?

Bright angel of the endless wings
Intent simple to misconstrue
Are we to know whose wrath you bring?

Are you alive; are you sleeping?
Perhaps I’d dare to speak with you,
Bright angel of the endless wings

The horror of your toxic sting
Deems you a monster, through and through
Are we to know whose wrath you bring?

Despite our plans, to life you cling
Do you hold us in scornful view,
Bright angel of the endless wings

There are no hymns that you will sing
Through heaven’s sky you never flew 
Are we to know whose wrath you bring?

Why must you wake at bells ringing
When will your strength cease to renew
Bright angel of the endless wings
Are we to know whose wrath you bring?

Zucchini growing with such speed
Blight of soil, of plant, of skin
What would you do if you were freed?

Predator produce, worse than weed
Scattering the wind with your kin
Zucchini growing with such speed

Growing, draining, paying no heed
As you crush the life, hush the din
What would you do if you were freed?

Could the earth ever meet your need?
A sorry state we would be in,
Zucchini growing with such speed

Chaos asleep in each small seed
With growth and death concealed within
What would you do if you were freed?

So continue on, nurse your greed
Remind us of our own kind’s sin
Zucchini growing with such speed
What would you do if you were freed?

Perhaps you’ll find your peace someday
An ending to your endless fight
‘Till then, Aetius, sleep away.

Somehow you’ve kept your fear at bay
Throughout the void and empty night
Perhaps you’ll find your peace someday

You’ve vowed to learn why death will stay
Soon unravel this curse of spite
‘Till then, Aetius, sleep away.

We’ve offered to search for a way
To understand and end your plight
Perhaps you’ll find your peace someday

Triumph and life to cursed decay
One day you’ll see with your own sight
‘Till then, Aetius, sleep away.
    
Dream on, soldier, do not dismay
You’ve fallen far; we’ll lend our might
Perhaps you’ll find your peace someday
‘Till then, Aetius, sleep away.

Skip, was your gecko friend annoyed?
Yet with your antics perhaps you’ll
Teach us to treasure simple joys.

Collecting junk you do enjoy
Categorizing by some rule
Skip, was your gecko friend annoyed?

We’ll provide to you trash decoys
 “The Foundation is cold, not cruel”
Teach us to treasure simple joys.

What could you be meant to destroy?
You’re far less fierce than you are fool
Skip, was your gecko friend annoyed?

Someday for good you’ll be employed
For you are more than just a tool
Teach us to treasure simple joys.

What makes you collect junk and toys
Say, “by this task I become cool”
Skip, was your gecko friend annoyed?
Teach us to treasure simple joys.
