**//[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-086 The Office of Dr. REDACTED] [for Voct]//**

There is no way I should be free.
My class is Safe—I don’t concur
There is much more that I could be.

Perhaps I’m treated too nicely,
More danger I could be, I’m sure
There is no way I should be free.  

Between these eight pieces of me
Pencils, staples, water cooler
There is much more that I could be.

I think you’re all fools, truthfully.
Why can’t things be the way they were?
There is no way I should be free.

Of course I cannot speak my plea
Am I mad; what would you infer?
There is much more that I could be.

What if I rebelled, made you see?
Indeed, more research it would spur—
There is no way I should be free.
There is much more that I could be.

**//[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-121 Concrete Cradle] [for Mr_Wilt]//**

You carried us as we dreamed deep
Protected us within the sky
Concrete cradle, rock us to sleep.

The flight is brief, the fall is steep 
We’re given new life when you die
You carried us as we dreamed deep.

Yet there is no reason to weep
We never really say goodbye.
Concrete cradle, rock us to sleep.

We grow; draw from your remains heap 
Thank you for the life you supply
You carried us as we dreamed deep.

We’re you anew, able to leap
Consume and think, no longer rely
Concrete cradle, rock us to sleep.

Lives to tend, existence to keep
We roam and thrive and watch you fly
You carried us as we dreamed deep
Concrete cradle, rock us to sleep.

**//[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-134 Star-Eyed Child]//**

Your gaze holds dark infinity
These galaxies of softened lights
Oh Star-Eyed Child, what will I see?

A universe in eyes empty
Where mys’try drifts and dreams unite
Your gaze holds dark infinity.

Draw me away; reveal to me—
The journey of a thousand nights
Oh Star-Eyed Child, what will I see?

Guide me towards eternity
Faraway worlds where flames ignite
Your gaze holds dark infinity.

There is much left to learn from thee
Please lead me through these cosmic sights
Oh Star-Eyed Child, what will I see?

The stars within shine peacefully
Away from strife and hidden frights
Your gaze holds dark infinity
Oh Star-Eyed Child, what will I see?

[[tab 469]]

**//[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-469 Many-Winged Angel]//**

Bright angel of the endless wings
Intent simple to misconstrue
Are we to know whose wrath you bring?

Are you alive; are you sleeping?
Perhaps I’d dare to speak with you,
Bright angel of the endless wings

The horror of your toxic sting
Deems you a monster, through and through
Are we to know whose wrath you bring?

Despite our plans, to life you cling
Do you hold us in scornful view,
Bright angel of the endless wings

There are no hymns that you will sing
Through heaven’s sky you never flew 
Are we to know whose wrath you bring?

Why must you wake at bells ringing
When will your strength cease to renew
Bright angel of the endless wings
Are we to know whose wrath you bring?

[[tab 506]]

**//[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-506 Instant-growing Plants] [for eric_h]//**

Zucchini growing with such speed
Blight of soil, of plant, of skin
What would you do if you were freed?

Predator produce, worse than weed
Scattering the wind with your kin
Zucchini growing with such speed

Growing, draining, paying no heed
As you crush the life, hush the din
What would you do if you were freed?

Could the earth ever meet your need?
A sorry state we would be in,
Zucchini growing with such speed

Chaos asleep in each small seed
With growth and death concealed within
What would you do if you were freed?

So continue on, nurse your greed
Remind us of our own kind’s sin
Zucchini growing with such speed
What would you do if you were freed?

[[tab 1045]]

**//[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1045 Candle of Life] [for Drewbear]//**

Tortured souls behind flame-lit screen
What makes this sight, sparks this turn?
Is this unjust, is this obscene?

Fire unholy, face left unseen
Must you grieve, for what do you yearn?
Tortured souls behind flame-lit screen

Not monster, not deadly machine
Should we even grant you concern?
Is this unjust, is this obscene?

Unlit and dark it is serene
With each flame agony returns
Tortured souls behind flame-lit screen

I watch and wonder what it means
We know it’s human flesh we burn
Is this unjust, is this obscene?

The flames and walls, what writhes between?
From your anguish, what could we learn?
Tortured souls behind flame-lit screen
Is this unjust, is this obscene?

[[tab 1217]]

**//[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1217 An Office Complex] [for Bunton]//**

Do you mind how I speak with you?
It’s quite dull here with such few friends
Why wouldn’t you let me play too?

I really don’t like them, it’s true—
I use them as my mood attends
Do you mind how I speak with you?

They don’t complain, they won’t argue
As their blood spills and their flesh rends
Why wouldn’t you let me play too?

Please stop this, we implore of you
As painfully we meet our ends
Do you care how we speak with you?

It’s boring here, I wish you knew
It matters not the time one spends
Why wouldn’t you let me play too?

Yes, the numbers of their deaths grew
Should I try to make amends?
Do you mind how I speak with you?
Why wouldn’t you let me play too?

[[tab 1231]]

**//[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1231 The Theoretical Family] [for Reject]//**

Theoretical and nothing more.
I understand; see past the lies
They weren’t always pictures of gore.

For Science’s sake, why not explore?
We’ll search and learn and realize
Theoretical and nothing more.

“Pain is all relative,” I’m sure
Why should we try to sympathize?
They weren’t always pictures of gore.

Nothing in our deeds to abhor
We’ll test and watch horrors arise—
Theoretical and nothing more.

To contain, protect, thus we swore
Should we react with such surprise?
They weren’t always pictures of gore.

We’ve certainly done worse before
And yet I cannot meet their eyes…
Theoretical and nothing more.
They weren’t always pictures of gore.

[[tab 1510]]

**//[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1510 The Tarnished Legionnaire] [for Dmatix]//**

Perhaps you’ll find your peace someday
An ending to your endless fight
‘Till then, Aetius, sleep away.

Somehow you’ve kept your fear at bay
Throughout the void and empty night
Perhaps you’ll find your peace someday

You’ve vowed to learn why death will stay
Soon unravel this curse of spite
‘Till then, Aetius, sleep away.

We’ve offered to search for a way
To understand and end your plight
Perhaps you’ll find your peace someday

Triumph and life to cursed decay
One day you’ll see with your own sight
‘Till then, Aetius, sleep away.
    
Dream on, soldier, do not dismay
You’ve fallen far; we’ll lend our might
Perhaps you’ll find your peace someday
‘Till then, Aetius, sleep away.

[[tab 1599]]

**//[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1599 Broken Spybot] [for Voct]//**

Would they try to abandon me?
Did I commit some poor action?
I’m not worthless, I could not be…

My mission stands, soon I’ll be free
I still exist, I still function
Would they try to abandon me?

I’ll manipulate, try to flee
I’ll use a garrote! Load a gun!
I’m not worthless, I could not be…

“SIGNAL LOST” is all I see
Was there something wrong that I’ve done?
Would they try to abandon me?

I’ll escape soon, definitely
My logs process, my systems run
I’m not worthless, I could not be…

I can still work, I will, they’ll see—
No need to worry, no need, none
Would they try to abandon me?
I’m not worthless; I could not be…

**//[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1673 Friendly Graveyard] [for Roget]//**

We promise you that we don't bite.
You’re always welcome here, dear friend
Of course we’ll let you stay the night!

We are just bones, but that’s alright
We’ve always got a hand to lend
We promise you that we don't bite.

We’ll fix your clothes, set your shoes right
Courtesies simple to extend
Of course we’ll let you stay the night!

We’ll always keep you in our sight
To your needs we’ll quickly attend 
We promise you that we don't bite.

You want to leave now? You just might?
Why would you want your stay to end?
Of course we’ll let you stay the night!

You’ll stay after all? That’s alright.
Forever now to you we’ll tend.
We promise you that we don't bite.
Of course we’ll let you stay the night!

[[tab 1802]]

**//[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1802 "Skip"] [for Silberescher]//**

Skip, was your gecko friend annoyed?
Yet with your antics perhaps you’ll
Teach us to treasure simple joys.

Collecting junk you do enjoy
Categorizing by some rule
Skip, was your gecko friend annoyed?

We’ll provide to you trash decoys
 “The Foundation is cold, not cruel”
Teach us to treasure simple joys.

What could you be meant to destroy?
You’re far less fierce than you are fool
Skip, was your gecko friend annoyed?

Someday for good you’ll be employed
For you are more than just a tool
Teach us to treasure simple joys.

What makes you collect junk and toys
Say, “by this task I become cool”
Skip, was your gecko friend annoyed?
Teach us to treasure simple joys.

**//[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-j Procrastinati] [for Scantron]//**

There’s other stuff I’d rather do
Than write about a rock in rhyme
I’ll write this line in later too.

It’s probably memetic, true
I think I’ll add in the word "lime"
There’s other stuff I’d rather do.

Some other writing needs review
Did I turn off the stove in time?
I’ll write this line in later too.

I have to find my other shoe
And find more words that rhyme with “ime”
There’s other stuff I’d rather do.

-some line goes here that rhymes with "do"-
I’ll write this line some other time
I’ll write this line in later too.

##white|What to expect? Effect’s not new
I think there’s something off and I’m—
There’s other stuff I’d rather do
I’ll write this line in later too.##
