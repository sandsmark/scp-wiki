+ [[[SCP-4997]]] -- Cauldros
SCP-4997 was my first successful dive into the SCP Wiki, and with geology being as much of a fascination for me as it is, writing about a geological entity was an inevitability for me. Cauldros was actually my third or so SCP conceptualized and wasn’t finished until shortly after the 4000 Contest had ended. Two weeks of research, graphic designing, and critique later, SCP-4997 was published and has thus far managed to remain afloat! I’m still kind of shocked that I managed to grab an SCP slot so close to SCP-5000, but I’m still thrilled I got there just in time!

Huge thanks to **[https://www.reddit.com/user/jeandepain/ u/jeandepain]** for their amazing fan art of SCP-4997 which can be found **[https://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/ci1osw/imminent_breach_at_yellowstone_national_park/ here]**!

+ [[[SCP-4870]]] -- Something’s Wrong With Site-17
One day I was down by the Canaveral National Seashore, saw a gopher tortoise, snapped some glamour shots of said gopher tortoise, and went on my way. I was so impressed with how the photo came out I used it as SCP fuel. What exactly this anomalous tortoise was going to do, however, managed to evade me for a good few weeks, bouncing around from pataphysics, to memetics, to pataphysics again, and eventually to what it is today. Odd as it may be, it stands as my second successful SCP and was even featured in the //SCP Cafe Podcast’s// **[https://scp.cafe/2019/01/25/recap-2019-week-3/ Recap: 2019, Week 3]** episode!

+ [[[SCP-4961]]] -- All Dogs Go to Heaven
I don’t remember too clearly how I came up with the idea for All Dogs Go to Heaven, but I do remember that a good friend of mine losing her dog while she was thousands of miles from home helped motivate me to actually write the dang thing. Instead of trying to evoke a sense of dread or curiosity, I wrote SCP-4961 to evoke a feeling of sorrow, a genre that I am admittedly rather new to.

While the fun in the park may be over, the real Quin, Ruta, and Radek sure made the time worthwhile.

+ [[[SCP-4685]]] -- Every Man Must Pay His Due
I’ll be completely honest; I wrote this one while hopped up on *way* too much caffeine as a means of procrastination on an important assignment. Some folks over on the SCP subreddit and a bit of SCP Fuel helped the idea come together, so without them I never would have been able to create this. I’m glad I got it put out exactly on Halloween too, I suppose that adds to the effect if you like it. Since being posted I've bounced some tweaks around on it but think it sits nicely as is, though future overhauls have not been entirely ruled out, admittedly. SCP-4685 was also featured in the //SCP Cafe Podcast’s// **[https://scp.cafe/2019/11/14/recap-2019-week-45/ Recap: 2019, Week 45]** episode, albeit critically, but featured nonetheless!

+ [[[SCP-4845]]] – Great Food, No Atmosphere [[size 65%]]//(Or: Tacos That Are Literally Out Of This World)//[[/size]]
An offhand comment by a good friend in the middle of nowhere planted the conceptual seed for this one. Taco Bell also represents a sort of social holy site in the lives of friends and I, so it’s incorporation into an SCP was bound to happen eventually. I originally intended to have it placed on Mars but shifted it to the Moon after some careful reconsideration. It’s a shame too, since I’d planned some Martian Taco Bell item names with some folks on Dr. Cimmerian’s Discord server, --rest in peace to //Olympus Mounds//, the //Doritos™ Martian Dust Shell Taco// and //Martian Dew// shall never see the light of day--.

+ [[[SCP-5700]]] - So Says I
A combination of severely misinterpreted //Shins// lyrics and a Yellowstone history magazine I picked up while I was working in the Park over the summer inspired this one. Drawing on local myths and legends, additional song lyrics, an assortment of gift shop items, a reference to the nice lady that always gave me an extra shot of espresso, and mixing in an SCP I had planned to write separately, I painstakingly pieced this article together. I stopped working on it for a while after the summer but picked back up when the SCP-5000 Contest was announced. Coffee, Christmas cookies, and a few nights of binge-writing later, I had completed it. Looks like I landed in 46th place too, not bad!

Also thanks to [[*user mindCancer]] for translating it into **[http://scpfoundation.net/scp-5700 russian]**, and to [[*user LeonTeflon]] for the in-progress Chinese translation!

+ [[[SCP-5888]]] - Pariah King
Originally I was in the mood for a lore-building article, so I figured I might as well expand on the SCP-1000 canon and refresh an old SCP idea I had a while back, but decided to rewrite the ending a little while after. It came together in a surprisingly timely fashion too, and I'm very happy with it overall. If you catch the Uncle Ted reference, good for you. Hope the new version reads better.

Ragnarok-Class anomalies (or anomal//y//, since I only made this as a one-off thing for a specific article) appear to exhibit similar characteristics as Apollyon-Class SCPs, but in reality are merely influencing their document's writer. Similar to [[[SCP-4626]]]'s //Azathoth-Class//, but on a larger, more Norwegian scale.

Gödel-Class anomalies denote objects that appear anomalous to standard observers but can be explained with anomalous technology such as inter-universal travel. To date, it has only been used in [[[SCP-4555]]], which is a great article that I highly recommend reading. Originally Gödel lacked any sort icon and was simply represented as "**Object Class:** Gödel," so I decided to do something with all the free time so generously afforded to me by Corona Quarantine.

Hera-Class anomalies denote objects that are highly hostile towards the Foundation but still of great potential usefulness. To date, it has only been used in [[[SCP-4113]]], which is a great article to wiggle your way into the //[[[sotmhub|Straight On Till Morning]]]// canon.

In short, the Geological Division is a department of the SCP Foundation tasked with studying and helping contain geological entities discovered by the Foundation; it functions on the same level of organization as other departments like the Pataphysics or Amnestics Departments.

I'm still not completely sure what this might develop into over the course of the articles I have planned for the future, but I already took the liberty of painstakingly designing a cool logo for it, so I might as well work off of it. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ --The idea of a custom page theme is not out of the question, either.-- Oh look I finally figured out how to make page themes HAHAHAHAHA!

+ About The Author
[[collapsible show="Show" hide="- Hide"]]
[[<]]

**Name:** ItsDenali / Denali

**Base of Operations:** Florida, USA

**Position:** Graphic Design Student, writer (duh), photographer, geology junkie, and bison enthusiast

**History:** ItsDenali, (or Denali for brevity's sake) first discovered the SCP Wiki in the summer of 2018 via a series of memes that made him wonder what the an ess-see-pee was and why people were obsessing over an pissed-off, spray-painted peanut. By late summer he had at last joined the SCP Foundation Site. Through several episodes of trial and error of getting to know the Wiki and how it worked, as well as a cringey, failed article, he surged back up on August 26th, 2018 having produced his first surviving mainlist article.

Denali continues to post SCPs to this day, chipping away at them whenever he has time, always looking for ways for them to reference each other and obscure details about his personal life, and severely over-analyzing every last detail before posting.

Welcome --to hell-- aboard!
