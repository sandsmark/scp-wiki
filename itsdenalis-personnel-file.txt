[[tab File Summary]]

[[include component:image-block name= cam.jpg |caption=When image licensing puts up too much of a fight, Denali will sometimes take it upon himself to capture his own fascinating photos.|width=245px]]

**Name:** ItsDenali / Denali

**Base of Operations:** Florida, USA

**Position:** Emerging Media Management Student, writer, photographer, geology & travel junkie, and bison enthusiast

**History:** ItsDenali, (or Denali for brevity's sake) first discovered the SCP Wiki in the summer of 2018 via a series of memes that made him wonder what the an ess-see-pee was and why people were obsessing over an angry, spray-painted peanut. By late summer he had at last joined the SCP Foundation Site. Through several episodes of trial and error of getting to know the Wiki and how it worked, as well as a cringey, failed article, he surged back up on August 26th, 2018 having produced his first surviving mainlist article.

Denali continues to post SCPs to this day, chipping away at them whenever he has time, always looking for ways for them to reference each other and obscure details about his personal life, and severely over-analyzing every last detail before posting.

Welcome --to hell-- aboard!

+ [[[SCP-4997]]] -- Cauldros
SCP-4997 was my first successful dive into the SCP Wiki, and with geology being as much of a fascination for me as it is, writing about a geological entity was an inevitability for me. Cauldros was actually my third or so SCP conceptualized and wasn‚Äôt finished until shortly after the 4000 Contest had ended. Two weeks of research, graphic designing, and critique later, SCP-4997 was published and has thus far managed to remain afloat! I‚Äôm still kind of shocked that I managed to grab an SCP slot so close to SCP-5000, but I‚Äôm still thrilled I got there just in time!

Huge thanks to **[https://www.reddit.com/user/jeandepain/ u/jeandepain]** on Reddit for their amazing fan art of SCP-4997 which can be found **[https://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/ci1osw/imminent_breach_at_yellowstone_national_park/ here]**! Don't forget **[https://www.deviantart.com/toonholt ToonHolt]**'s fan art of 4997 **[https://www.deviantart.com/toonholt/art/Monsterverse-Tephradon-821310510 here]** too!

And //huger// thanks to [[*user pingd]] for translating it all into Chinese! You can read it from the article's info bar, or **[http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/scp-4997 here!]**


+ [[[SCP-4870]]] -- Something‚Äôs Wrong With Site-17
One day I was down by the Canaveral National Seashore, saw a gopher tortoise, snapped some glamour shots of said gopher tortoise, and went on my way. I was so impressed with how the photo came out I used it as SCP fuel. What exactly this anomalous tortoise was going to do, however, managed to evade me for a good few weeks, bouncing around from pataphysics, to memetics, to pataphysics again, and eventually to what it is today. Odd as it may be, it stands as my second successful SCP and was even featured in the //SCP Cafe Podcast‚Äôs// **[https://scp.cafe/2019/01/25/recap-2019-week-3/ Recap: 2019, Week 3]** episode!

+ [[[SCP-4961]]] -- All Dogs Go to Heaven
I don‚Äôt remember too clearly how I came up with the idea for All Dogs Go to Heaven, but I do remember that a good friend of mine losing her dog while she was thousands of miles from home helped motivate me to actually write the dang thing. Instead of trying to evoke a sense of dread or curiosity, I wrote SCP-4961 to evoke a feeling of sorrow, a genre that I am admittedly rather new to.

While the fun in the park may be over, the real Quin, Ruta, and Radek sure made the time worthwhile.

+ [[[SCP-4685]]] -- Every Man Must Pay His Due
I‚Äôll be completely honest; I wrote this one while hopped up on *way* too much caffeine as a means of procrastination on an important assignment. Some folks over on the SCP subreddit and a bit of SCP Fuel helped the idea come together, so without them I never would have been able to create this. I‚Äôm glad I got it put out exactly on Halloween too, I suppose that adds to the effect if you like it. Since being posted I've bounced some tweaks around on it but think it sits nicely as is, though future overhauls have not been entirely ruled out, admittedly. SCP-4685 was also featured in the //SCP Cafe Podcast‚Äôs// **[https://scp.cafe/2019/11/14/recap-2019-week-45/ Recap: 2019, Week 45]** episode, albeit critically, but featured nonetheless!

+ [[[SCP-4845]]] ‚Äì [[size 90%]]Taco Bell But It‚Äôs On The F*cking Moon[[/size]] [[size 75%]]//(Or: Tacos That Are Literally Out Of This World)//[[/size]]
An offhand comment by a good friend in the middle of nowhere planted the conceptual seed for this one. Taco Bell also represents a sort of social holy site in the lives of friends and I, so it‚Äôs incorporation into an SCP was bound to happen eventually. I originally intended to have it placed on Mars but shifted it to the Moon after some careful reconsideration. It‚Äôs a shame too, since I‚Äôd planned some Martian Taco Bell item names with some folks on Dr. Cimmerian‚Äôs Discord server, --rest in peace to //Olympus Mounds//, the //Doritos‚Ñ¢ Martian Dust Shell Taco// and //Martian Dew// shall never see the light of day--.

In short, the Geological Division is a department of the SCP Foundation tasked with studying and helping contain geological entities discovered by the Foundation; it functions on the same level of organization as other departments like the Pataphysics or Amnestics Departments, and as such, it has a global presence.

I'm still not completely sure what this might develop into over the course of the articles I have planned for the future, but I already took the liberty of painstakingly designing a cool logo for it, so I might as well work off of it. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø The idea of a custom page theme is not out of the question, either.
