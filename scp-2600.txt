**Item #:** SCP-2600

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Containment Attempt Summary:** Initially after SCP-2600 was classified as Euclid, other, apparently failed, test materials were euthanized by the engineers of Mobile Task Force 43, "Quarter Junkies". The waste material was encased in concrete and buried near Alamagordo, New Mexico. Prior to the manifestation of the neutralizing effect, all instances of SCP-2600 were stored within Site-92. The status of SCP-2600 is currently unknown. The anomaly it propagates renders all methods of close examination with it to be non-viable. The facility which houses the anomaly was lost in 1984, along with all personnel assigned to monitor it. 

Personnel are not to listen to any possible attempts by former SCP-2600 researchers to contact them. Personnel are advised to contact their immediate supervisor should such a situation occur.


**Description:** SCP-2600 is a set of 8 Cathode Ray Tube television sets, displaying the face of a human subject. Reports of their disappearance have been suppressed by Foundation misinformation agents. Video displayed on SCP-2600 each depict a different humanoid subject. Subjects depicted do not display awareness of their surroundings, but will occasionally react to stimuli caused by testing. Faces displayed on SCP-2600 currently are:

* Three adolescent subjects, two female and one male identical to youths who were reported as missing during the year 1981. All were reported missing at or around Portland, Oregon.
* One unidentified adult subject. Video of the subject has been altered to obscure the face, leaving a white silhouette. Hair is still present.
* A male identified as █████ ████████, a former agent of the KGB who worked within the United States, reported deceased in 1991.
* Two adult human subjects, female, who constantly mouth the words "Setting sail ships us free" and "The Kit Case jumped over the lazy Bolshy".

All instances of SCP-2600 are connected to one Atari Video Computer System[[footnote]]Colloquially known as the "Atari 2600"[[/footnote]], via a 12 meter cable extending from the cartridge slot. The power supply and controller ports have been removed, and the copyright information on the bottom of the unit has been replaced with a label reading "MK-PRO-1-POL". 

Human subjects exposed to SCP-2600 will experience a mind-affecting anomaly. Subjects become very susceptible to suggestion, as long as they are within 20 meters of it. Once a subject has been exposed, stepping outside of this range will cause them to experience a state of mind similar to those found in subjects exposed to Lysergic acid diethylamide[[footnote]]Commonly referred to as "LSD".[[/footnote]]. Adjusting the switches will cause the user to be susceptible to different forms of persuasion, and display distinct emotional alterations. Tested changes have included sudden anger, aggression, confusion, sadness, apathy, and submission. This effect has been noted to last between 20 minutes to 4 hours, --after which subjects will return to their normal behaviors--.

The research, which led to the discovery of SCP-2600, initially began after an inquiry into the Unusual Incidents Unit revealed a Class-3 "Cart" had been discovered in  Salt Lake City, Utah. The effects of the object were not known at this time, as all records of its discovery were destroyed before Foundation agents could recover them. However, it is known that separately from this, in 1980, the Atari Inc. video game corporation was contracted by the US Army to create war simulation software.

The anomaly currently designated as SCP-2600 was first brought to Foundation attention through internal documentation leaks in May of 1981, from the Atari, Inc. corporation. These leaks indicated that the project had exceeded its original scope, and was almost completely being developed by the Central Intelligence Agency. One subject, ██ ████████, was noted as having dramatic behavioral changes after being recruited to the CIA. Efforts to recover SCP-2600 were redoubled at this point.

By the end of 1982, efforts to block the initial creation of the targeted anomalous objects had failed, resulting in the initial creation of SCP-2600. However, the project was apparently abandoned shortly thereafter. Foundation agents were able to recover SCP-2600 on ██/14/1982.

Financial difficulties overtook Atari at this time, leading to its dissolution, and Foundation personnel were able to confiscate all of their materials relating to SCP-2600. Personnel involved in the development of SCP-2600 remain under observation, particularly those involved with the Central Intelligence Agency and the Unusual Incidents Unit. 

As of 9/18/1984, SCP-2600 has been classified as Euclid.

**Addendum 2600-A-I:** Analysis of Site-92 has shown that, over the past 11 months since SCP-2600 was contained and classified, several unusual trends have emerged. These include:

* Above average number of volunteers for research and analysis of SCP-2600 related records and anomalous effects.
* Electric usage for the Site-92 west facilities, where SCP-2600 is stored, being abnormally high. This has been attributed to research staff leaving the lights on at all hours of the day.
* Level 3 personnel approving above-average research budgets for projects relating to SCP-2600. 
* D-Class personnel not needing instruction in regards to testing SCP-2600's anomalous effect.

As such, Site-92 personnel have been determined to have been affected by a previously unknown effect of SCP-2600. A Level-4 emergency mental purge and containment situation has been declared by O5-██, and all personnel are to be evacuated from the site within 90 hours. All SCP objects are to be transferred to the nearby Site-18, and SCP-2000 itself neutralized by Foundation staff.

**Addendum 2600-A-II:** All personnel connected to Site-92 have been presumed lost, and the Site itself reclassified as an anomalous containment area. Any subject with knowledge of the facility, or being sent in with any expectation, will immediately be compelled to turn and leave the area. Use of double blind study participants has shown that the exterior of Site-92 has been substantially reduced, to a 1/500th scale. Use of anomalous countermeasures to destroy SCP-2600 are being considered.


**Addendum 2600-C:** Documentation recovered from the initial creation of SCP-2600

> **STELLA Project** proposed by the **Agency** as a successor project to ██ █████, due to the new materials discovered which could overcome the faults found in the original process of implementing and sustaining mind control. Persons who were relieved of duty following the conclusion of the project have been contacted by the  **Agency** in order to resume some level of their previous work. Work has been contracted out to universities, research foundations, and most significantly, the Atari Inc. corporation, which has proved promising due to the presence of their technology and previous work with the military. In addition, at least 80 former employees of this company have signed on to participate.

> The Arcadia effect, which surrounds the human minds ability to heavily influence the perception of others, once liberated from controlling a body. The effect appears to be entirely contained to the mind, with the vast spaces apparently covered by the eyes not existing. Notably, Agents are to note that thoughts of apathy, tinnitus, and minor rashes appearing around the temples are normal. In addition, there have been reports of vivid hallucinations of "broken, sweaty skin bumping up and down on a bus, with the shredded rubbery not-rubber wheels and some boy's mother on the top". These have been found to be mildly troubling to Agents with a Psionic Resistance Index below 45.0. These Agents are not permitted to  in█████ with the object and its surrounding ██████ ██████.

> Testing has been increasingly successful over the past 01 years with subjects being able to recreate complicated war game scenarios based on the programming of officers. In addition, subjects are able to control the mindsets of anybody within the simulation, which has been proven to be very important for controlling project directors such as Rothburg who's continued loyalty is critical.  asked to describe what they could sa█, reported only st██ █c and d█████r.

But that doesn't explain how a 19 old kid was able to have resistance to coercion and mind control techniques which were successful even with his counterparts.
