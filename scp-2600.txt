**Item #:** SCP-2600

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Containment Attempt Summary:** During SCP-2600's containment operations, non-functional and other non-essential test materials were neutralized by the engineers of Mobile Task Force Delta-43, "Quarter Junkies". The remains were encased in concrete and buried near Alamogordo, New Mexico. Prior to the manifestation of the current area of effect, all instances of SCP-2600 were stored within Site-92.[[footnote]]The facility which houses the anomaly was lost in 1984, along with all personnel assigned to monitor it.[[/footnote]] The status of SCP-2600 and Site-92 is currently unknown.

**Description:** SCP-2600 is a set of 8 CRT[[footnote]]Cathode Ray Tube.[[/footnote]] television sets. Video displayed on the objects depict different humanoid faces, with varying levels of detail and clarity. Faces displayed on SCP-2600 currently are:

* Three adolescent subjects, two female and one male identical to youths who were reported as missing during the year 1981. All were reported missing at or around Portland, Oregon.
* One unidentified adult subject. Interference with the signal obscures the face, leaving a white silhouette, although the hair comes in clearly.
* A male identified as █████ ████████, a former agent of the KGB who worked within the United States, reported MIA by the Soviet Union in 1991.
* Two adult human subjects, female, who constantly mouth the words "Setting sail ships us free" and "The Kit Case jumped over the lazy Bolshy".

All instances of SCP-2600 are connected to one Atari Video Computer System[[footnote]]Colloquially known as the "Atari 2600"[[/footnote]], via a black cable coming out of the cartridge slot. All external ports have been covered, and the copyright information on the bottom of the unit has been replaced with a label reading "{{MK-PRO-8-POL}}". 

Human subjects exposed to SCP-2600 become very susceptible to suggestion, as long as they are within 20 meters of it. Once a subject has been exposed, stepping outside of this range will cause them to spontaneously generate Lysergic acid diethylamide[[footnote]]Commonly referred to as "LSD".[[/footnote]] in their mouths, usually resulting in hallucinogenic effects. Adjusting the switches present on the console portion of SCP-2600 will cause the user to behave differently, as well as adjusting their responsiveness to performing commands. Tested subjects usually display sudden anger, aggression, confusion, sadness, apathy, and submission. This effect has been noted to last between 20 minutes to 4 hours, --after which subjects will return to their normal behaviors--.

The anomaly currently designated as SCP-2600 was first brought to Foundation attention through Atari internal documentation leaks in May of 1981. These leaks indicated that a war simulation project contracted by the US Army had exceeded its original scope, and the development team was now being led by the Central Intelligence Agency. One subject, ██ ████████, was noted as having dramatic behavioral changes after being recruited by the CIA. Efforts to recover SCP-2600 were redoubled at this point.

By the end of 1982, efforts to prevent the anomaly from being utilized by the United States had failed, resulting in the initial creation of SCP-2600. However, the project was abandoned due to unknown difficulties resulting in it being transferred to the Unusual Incidents Unit. Foundation agents were able to recover SCP-2600 from them on 01/14/1983.

As financial difficulties had bankrupted Atari at this time, Foundation personnel were able to confiscate all of their materials relating to SCP-2600. Personnel involved in the development of SCP-2600 remain under observation, particularly those involved with the Central Intelligence Agency and the Unusual Incidents Unit. 

As of 9/18/1984, SCP-2600 has been classified as Euclid and is contained within Site-92.

**Addendum 2600-A-I:** Analysis of Site-92 has shown that, over the past 11 months since SCP-2600 was contained and classified, several unusual trends have emerged. These include:

* Above average number of volunteers for research and analysis of SCP-2600 surveillance records and communications testing.
* Electric usage for the Site-92 west facilities, where SCP-2600 is stored, being abnormally high. This has been attributed to research staff leaving the lights on at all hours of the day.
* Level 3 personnel approving above-average research budgets for projects relating to SCP-2600. 
* D-Class personnel not needing instruction in regards to being tested with SCP-2600's anomalous effect.

Site-92 personnel have been determined to have been affected by a previously unknown effect of SCP-2600. A Level-2 rotation of the containment situation has been decreed by the Overseer Council, and all personnel are to be evacuated from the site within 72 hours. All SCP objects are to be transferred to temporary holding facilities, and SCP-2600 itself removed for further study by Foundation agents.

**Addendum 2600-A-II:** 2 hours after the initiation of a Level-2 event, all contact with Site-92 was lost. All personnel connected to Site-92 have been presumed lost, and the Site itself reclassified as an extension of its anomaly. Any subject approaching it will not be able to approach closer than 1 kilometer, as terrain will begin to repeat itself and attempting to move closer will result in being unable to return. Use of robotic drone surveyors has shown that the exterior of Site-92 has been substantially reduced, to a 1/500th scale. Attempts to gain re-entry to the site itself has not been successful. Use of anomalous countermeasures to decommission SCP-2600 are being considered.

**Addendum 2600-C:** Documentation recovered from the initial creation of SCP-2600

> **STELLA Project** proposed by the **Agency** as a successor project to M█-█████, due to the new materials discovered which could overcome the faults found in the original process of implementing and sustaining controlling people's minds. Persons who were relieved of duty following the conclusion of the project have been contacted by the  **Agency** in order to resume some form of their previous work. Work has been contracted out to universities, research foundations, and computer companies, including the Atari Inc. corporation. Their cooperation has proved promising due to the presence of their technology and contract to work with the military. In addition, at least 80 former employees of this company have signed on to participate as dual personnel.

> **The ##purple|Arcadia## effect:** The human mind's ability to heavily influence the perceptions of other minds, once liberated from the task of controlling a body. The effect appears to be entirely contained to the mind, and all outside stimuli does nothing to inhibit the effect. This includes usage of the experimental Tele████ ████ Echo Chamber Dev███. Notably, Agents are to note that thoughts of apathy, experiencing tinnitus, and minor rashes appearing around the temples are normal side effects of exposure to the ##purple|Arcadia## Effect. In addition, there have been reports of vivid hallucinations of "broken, sweaty pimply skin bumping up and down on a bus, with the shredded rubbery not-rubber wheels and some boy's mother on the top". The specificity of this vision has been consistent among those experiencing it, and have been found to be mildly troubling to Agents with a Psionic Resistance Index below 45.0. These Agents are not permitted to  in█████ with the object and its surrounding equipment and related phenomenon, including the Dabney-Syzygy Inhibitor.

> **Test Subjects:** In order to experiment with the ##purple|Arcadia## Effect, subjects must be completely liberated from their old methods and abilities regarding thought and logic. To do so, the brain needs to focus on tasks other than biological responses. As such, the portions of the body which detract from the processing power must be removed, and the pure core placed in an electrostatic Dabney-Syzygy Inhibitor, which displays a workable test subject on-screen.

> Recently, research into the technology has come to an end. As Doctor Dabney reports "We have sufficiently liberated subjects from their old methods of thinking and perceiving, to a programmable degree!" Subjects are communicating with site staff, and appear to have improved their attitude following con█ition███. 

> No further action is necessary with uncooperative subjects.

> All testing has been moved to Facility 18, due to its secretive location.

> Testing has been increasingly successful over the past 01 years with subjects being able to recreate complicated war game scenarios based on the programming information provided by technical officers. In addition, subjects are able to control the mindsets of anybody participating in the simulation, which has been proven to be very important for controlling project directors such as Rothburg, who's continued loyalty is critical.
