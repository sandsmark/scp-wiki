++ Adytite Sound Changes
Adytite was an agglutinative Uralic language spoken in the Bronze Age around modern day Western Siberia, and can be regarded as an early offshoot of Proto-Uralic which developed around and was influenced by both Proto-Samoyedic, the Tungusic, and the Yeniseian languages, thus it shares many sound changes with the former. Adytite is thus related to Finnish, Hungarian, and Estonian. The innovations from Proto-Uralic proper are:

* Pervasive vowel harmony, notably Ä and O umlaut.
* Syncope, loss of unstressed vowels.
* Merging of *ï/ë and *ü to ü.
* PU *x > PS *ø
* Final /Vw/ > /u/
* /a/ > /e/ in the environment of /j/
* Loss of intervocalic /j/.
* Loss of initial vowels (in some words).
* L-vocalization of medial and final /ɫ/ > /o/..
* /ɬ/ > /l/, in the more eastern Sayan dialect it became /ɮ/ in the middle of words but merged with /s/.
* PU /ɬʲ/ as well as PU *l in medial positions > /j/
* Loss of double segments.
* A loss of nasals in the clusters *Nš, *Nč, *Nć, *Nś, Nľ, Nr, and Nl. 
* *ś and *š merge to /s/. A new š develops only later as an allophone of /sj/.
* Loss of palatalization as a secondary feature. 
* *ć and *č merge to /ts/.
* ∅ → /ŋ/ word-initially (a Samoyedic idiosyncrasy)

Note that there is some evidence that Adytite descends not from Proto-Uralic proper, but from an earlier form of the proto-language. This is because of forms like //Valksaran// supposedly from PU //walke-śarna//, //saran// seems more like a pre-syncope stage of the word *śarna, which has theoretically lost the /a/ in the second syllable thereby creating the consonant cluster /rn/. Another example would be //lüjekütakeŋ//, which under the normal theory comes from *lülV + *kütke- + *ŋ. But again, //kütake// have //added// an extra vowel between /t/ and /k/.

* The stops and sibilants were voiced in between vowels.

++++ Dialects
There were many distinct dialects of Adytite, the most recognized being the Dark-L and Light-L dialects respectively, spoken somewhat to the east of the Yenisei. The first is distinguished by the sound change of final /l/, and /l/ in clusters when preceded by a back vowel, to /ɫ/, further changing to /o/. The Light-L dialect didn’t share this innovation, and it was spoken in western Siberia. Some parts of the Valkzaron seem to have been composed by speakers of both dialects, as the phrase Valksaran (“bright words”) is Light-L, the Dark-L equivalent being voksaran.

/ɬ/ and > /ɮ/ occurred in the Sayan dialect in the middle of words but merged with /s/ initially. Here the nasal vowels we're preserved, which were the result of a loss of nasals in the clusters *Nš, *Nč, *Nć, *Nś, Nľ, Nr, and Nl. The Sayan dialect borrowed many words from Yeniseian, and /u/ became unrounded.

The Upper Yeniseian dialect strengthened /v/ to /b/, /j/ to /dʲ/, /r/ to /d/ word initially, and /ŋ/ to /g/, gaining voiced stops. This dialect effectively eliminates most consonant clusters, /lC/ to /uC/, /rC/ to /dVC/, ect. It also gained a new /x/ from clusters of /ɫj/ and /kj/. In case where an /u/ developed from a former /ɫ/ and was preceded /y/, an intervening /ɰ/ emerged which later became another source of /g/. If /u/ was preceded by another /u/, an intervening /w/ emerged, which became /b/. Diphthongs like /ue/ became /we/ and then /əbe/.

++ Vocabulary
Adytite has a great deal of borrowings from Deva (Indo-European) dialects and the Tungusic languages. However, the majority of its vocabulary is directly derived from Proto-Uralic.

++ Pronunciation Guide for Noobies
+++ Vowels

* I is pronounced like the long ''ee'' sound in //feet//, never like the short ''i'' in //sit//.

* Ü is pronounced like the ü in Mandarin Chinese and Turkish. It is an ''ee'' sound, but with rounded lips as if someone was saying ''ew''.

* E as in //bet//.

* O as in //boat//.

* U as pronounced like the long ''oo'' in //food//, never like the short ''u'' in //but//.

* Ä as in //cat//.

* A as in //father//, never like the ''a'' in //fate//.

Note: Double spelling indicate a longer duration, but nevertheless a short vowel and its long equivalent are the same vowel. For instance, ''aa'' is pronounced as in //father//, but slightly longer. 

+++ Consonants 

* J is a ''y'' sound as in //year//, and is never pronounced like the ''j'' in //judge//. 

* C is pronounced like the ''ts'' in //cats//.

* R is like the Spanish trilled r. 

Tip: Adytite is an Uralic language, which means that the stops (p, t, c, and k) are not aspirated like the ones in English. In English stops are normally accompanied by a burst of airflow. 

For example put your hand to your mouth while saying //pie//, and then say //spy//. The former is pronounced with aspiration, the latter isn't. Using the guide, try to pronounce Adytite stops like the latter, never the former. In the middle of words, the stops may be voiced like English b, d, j, and g, but since most Uralic languages don't distinguish between voiced and voiceless, it shouldn't make a difference.

++ Grammar
+++ Nouns

Adytite nouns had fourteen noun cases and three numbers, singular, dual and plural. Grammatical gender was not recognized and no Uralic language does so even today. Noun articles were unknown. 
The plural marker of nouns was -t in final position and -j- in non-final position, as seen in Finnish. The dual marker was-k-.

The cases were:
 
* direct case (no suffix)
* oblique/lative case -m
* ablative/partitive case -ta / -tä

+++ Adpositions
Adytite uses postpositions rather than prepositions, so instead of saying //I went to Japan//, one would say, //I Japan-to go//. Interestingly, Adytite sometimes employs verbs and serial verb-constructions instead of adpositions, with //see-penetrate// instead of //see through// (there is no word for through), and //give// instead of //for//.

+++ Adjectives 
Adjectives are not distinguished from verbs, and Adytite doesn't possess very many of them. Since Adytite is an extremely idiomatic language, comparisons are often used instead. For example-

* //Tom is strong// - Tom na kucu, Tom na kucu cilki uree, Tom na kucu sivike uree (lit. //Tom has strength//, //Tom has strength resembling the biceps of a bear//, or //resembling a bear//.)

* //I like flowers// - mi curumut rem käjä ŋäcäm (//lit. I flowers color blood love//). 

+++ Verbs

The verb was inflected for tense, aspect (*-va indicated "nonpast", *-ka indicated "perfect nonpast; imperative", *-ja indicated "past") and mood (*-ne indicated "conditional-potential").

Adytite verbs attest to the archaic age of the language, with several grammatical innovations apparent in the oldest texts that could not have arisen over a short period of time. Adytite verbs has features typical of a compositional polysynthetic language, with verb-serialization and noun incorporation playing a role in grammar. Examples of verb serialization are-

* I see through the lies of the Deva - Mi Tüstaatan selutam van soole (lit. //I the Deva's lies see-penetrate//)  

* We'll climb over the mountain - Man kalam kaŋ kava (lit. //We mountain climb-rise//)

* We shot him and he died - Man sam lam veje (lit We him shoot-kill)

The person endings are- 

||  || Subjective || Objective ||
|| 1sg || -m || -ma ||
|| 2sg || -t || -ta ||
|| 3sg || -ø || -a ||
|| 1du. exc || -mankätikä || -mankätikää ||
|| 2du || -tan || tana || 
|| 3du|| -ki || -kja ||
|| 1du. incl || -man || -mana ||
|| 1pl exc. || -mankun(a) || -mankunaa ||
|| 2pl || -tat || -tata ||
|| 3pl || -t || -ta ||
|| 1pl incl. || -mat || -mata ||

Reduplication of the initial syllable forms the habitual aspect, and reduplication of the whole word forms a kind of intensive aspect with habitual overtones. Lengthening the initial vowel and then reduplicating it forms the Continuous with an optional suffix, //-nü-kue//[[footnote]]from hypothetical //nü-j-e-kur//, //now-prothetic j-NEG-finish//.[[/footnote]]. //Ekur// is a verb meaning //not finish// used in serial verb constructions as an equivalent of the Continuative aspect[[footnote]]//Lamna ekur mi//, //I'm not finished shooting,// or //I'm still shooting//.[[/footnote]]. The progressive is marked by //-na//. 

Another kind of Continuative aspect, the one in sentences like, //The economy's been rough but I'm still makin' it//, is expressed by the verb //ekujuna//[[footnote]]//Not stopping//[[/footnote]]. //Kuju//[[footnote]]//Stop//[[/footnote]] would express the Terminative.

The Defective, another example of verb-serialization, is expressed by the verb mäjü-kü[[footnote]]A combination of the verb //to touch// and an proximal objective suffix meaning //a space close to smth//.[[/footnote]]

The adverb //pile//[[footnote]]//long//[[/footnote]] marks the durative, //kava//[[footnote]]//to rise//[[/footnote]] the Protractive, //kü//[[footnote]]//close//[[/footnote]] the Intentional, and //ekarma//[[footnote]]//not want//[[/footnote]] the Accidental.

The future tense was marked by words like //soon// or //not now//, as well as serial verb constructions like //Mi caca süve//[[footnote]]//I'm going out to eat//, lit. //I go eat//.[[/footnote]].

+++ Syntax 

The dominating word order in Adytite is SOV, similar to other Samoyedic languages. However, Adytite is considered to exhibit more freedom in word order than other languages of its areal group.
Adytite is strictly left-branching like Japanese and Turkish, with relative clauses coming first in a sentence and the main verb always coming last. Postpositions are used instead of prepositions, and adjectives are treated as stative verbs, thus coming after the noun they describe.

+++ Alignment 

Adytite is an Active-Stative language, also commonly called a split intransitive language, which means the sole argument ("subject") of an intransitive clause (often symbolized as S) is sometimes marked in the same way as an agent of a transitive verb (that is, like a subject such as "I" or "she" in English) but other times in the same way as a direct object (such as "me" or "her" in English). 

The case or agreement of the intransitive argument (S) depends on the degree of volition, or control over the verbal action exercised by the participant. For example, if one tripped and fell, an Adytite speaker would say "I fell." To say "fell-me" (subjective ending) or "fell I" would mean that the person had done it on purpose, such as taking a fall in boxing.

The subject of a stative verb is grammatically grouped together with the object of a transitive verb, which is quite natural, since both the stative subject and the transitive object are affected by the action of the verb (i.e. are semantically undergoers or "patients"). This means that the subject of verbs like //sleep//, //become hungry// and //lust// are placed before the verb and optionally given the oblique case marker, -m.
