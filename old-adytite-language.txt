++ Adytite Sound Changes
Adytite was an agglutinative Uralic language spoken in the Bronze Age around modern day Western Siberia, and can be regarded as an early offshoot of Proto-Uralic which developed around and was influenced by both Proto-Samoyedic and the Yeniseian languages, thus it shares many sound changes with the former. Adytite is thus related to Finnish, Hungarian, and Estonian. The innovations from Prot[[[page name]]]o-Uralic proper are:

* Pervasive vowel harmony, notably Ä and O umlaut.
* Syncope, loss of unstressed vowels.
* Merging of *ï/ë and *ü to ü.
* Loss of /x/.
* Final /Vw/ > /u/
* Loss of final /r/ in the non-rhotic dialect, Lovataar > Lovataa
* /a/ > /e/ in the environment of /j/, the /j/ was lost in syllabic final position.
* Loss of initial vowels (in some words).
* L-vocalization of medial and final /ɫ/ > /o/..
* /ɬ/ and /ɬʲ/ > /θ/, in the more eastern Sayan dialect it became /ɮ/ in the middle of words but merged with /ʃ/ initially, while in the Non-Rhotic dialect there is a merger with /s/.
* Loss of double segments.
* A loss of nasals in the clusters *Nš, *Nč, *Nć, *Nś, Nľ, Nr, and Nl. 
* /ś/ merger with /s/.
* Loss of palatalization as a secondary feature. 
* /ć/ merger with /c/.

* The stops and sibilants were voiced in between vowels.

Note that there were two distinct dialects of Adytite, the Dark-L and Light-L dialects respectively. The first is distinguished by the sound change of final /l/, and /l/ in clusters when preceded by a back vowel, to /ɫ/, further changing to /o/. The Light-L dialect didn’t share this innovation, and it was spoken in western Siberia. Some parts of the Valkzaron seem to have been composed by speakers of both dialects, as the phrase Valksaran (“bright words”) is Light-L, the Dark-L equivalent being voksaran.

The Dark-L dialect was also Non-rhotic, and dropped syllable final r's. This dialect stopped being spoken at the turn of the pre-BC millennium.  

++ Vocabulary
Adytite has a great deal of borrowings from Deva (Indo-European) dialects and the Tungusic languages. However, the majority of its vocabulary is directly derived from Proto-Uralic.

++ Pronunciation Guide for Noobies
+++ Vowels

* I is pronounced like the long ''ee'' sound in //feet//, never like the short ''i'' in //sit//.

* Ü is pronounced like the ü in Mandarin Chinese and Turkish. It is an ''ee'' sound, but with rounded lips as if someone was saying ''ew''.

* E as in //bet//.

* O as in //boat//.

* U as pronounced like the long ''oo'' in //food//, never like the short ''u'' in //but//.

* Ä as in //cat//.

* A as in //father//, never like the ''a'' in //fate//.

Note: Double spelling indicate a longer duration, but nevertheless a short vowel and its long equivalent are the same vowel. For instance, ''aa'' is pronounced as in //father//, but slightly longer. 

+++ Consonants 

* J is a ''y'' sound as in //year//, and is never pronounced like the ''j'' in //judge//. 

* C and Š are the English ''ch'' and ''sh'' sounds.

* θ is the English ''th'' sound, as in //three//.

* R is like the Spanish trilled r. 

Tip: Adytite is a Uralic language, which means that the stops (p, t, c, and k) are not aspirated like the ones in English. In English stops are normally accompanied by a burst of airflow. 

For example put your hand to your mouth while saying //pie//, and then say //spy//. The former is pronounced with aspiration, the latter isn't. Using the guide, try to pronounce Adytite stops like the latter, never the former. In the middle of words, the stops may be voiced like English b, d, j, and g, but since most Uralic languages don't distinguish between voiced and voiceless, it shouldn't make a difference.

++ Grammar
+++ Nouns

Adytite nouns had fourteen noun cases and three numbers, singular, dual and plural. Grammatical gender was not recognized and no Uralic language does so even today. Noun articles were unknown. 
The plural marker of nouns was -t in final position and -j- in non-final position, as seen in Finnish. The dual marker was-k-.

The cases were:
 
* nominative -ø
* ergative -m
* partitive case -ta / -tä
* dative/genitive -n
* essive -na / -nä
* inessive -s
* elative -sta/-stä
* illative -kan
* adessive -l
* abessive -ta / -tä
* comitative -oŋti
* translative -ksi
* ablative case -to
* lative -ŋ

+++ Adjectives 
Adjectives are not distinguished from verbs, and Adytite doesn't possess very many of them. Since Adytite is an extremely idiomatic language, comparisons are often used instead. For example-

* //Tom is strong// - Tomn kucu, Tomn kucu cilki uree, Tomn kucu sivike uree (lit. //Tom has strength//, //Tom has strength resembling the biceps of a bear//, or //resembling a bear//.)

* //I like flowers// - mi curumut rem kälä äcäm (//lit. I flowers color blood love//). 

+++ Verbs

The verb was inflected for tense-aspect (*-va indicated "nonpast", *-ka indicated "perfect nonpast; imperative", *-ja indicated "past") and mood (*-ne indicated "conditional-potential"), as well as mood.

Adytite verbs attest to the archaic age of the language, with several grammatical innovations apparent in the oldest texts that could not have arisen over a short period of time. Adytite verbs has features typical of a compositional polysynthetic language, with verb-serialization and noun incorporation playing a role in grammar. Examples of verb serialization are-

* I see through the lies of the Deva - Mi Tüstaatan šelum ata soothe (lit. //I the Deva's lies see-penetrate//)  

* We'll climb over the mountain - Majn katham kaŋ kava (lit. We mountain this go climb-rise)

* We shot him and he died - Majn sam lam vethe (lit We him shoot-kill)

The person endings are- 

||  || Subjective || Objective ||
|| 1sg || -m || -ma ||
|| 2sg || -t || -ta ||
|| 3sg || -ø || -a ||
|| 1du. exc || -majnkat || -majnkata ||
|| 2du || -tajn || tajna || 
|| 3du|| -ki || -kja ||
|| 1du. incl || -majn || -majna ||
|| 1pl exc. || -majnkun(a) || -majnkunaa ||
|| 2pl || -tat || -tata ||
|| 3pl || -t || -ta ||
|| 1pl incl. || -mat || -mata ||

+++ Syntax 

The dominating word order in Adytite is SOV, similar to other Samoyedic languages. However, Adytite is considered to exhibit more freedom in word order than other languages of its areal group.
Adytite is strictly left-branching like Japanese and Turkish, with relative clauses coming first in a sentence and the main verb always coming last. Postpositions are used instead of prepositions, and adjectives are treated as stative verbs, thus coming after the noun they describe.

+++ Alignment 

Adytite is an Active-Stative language, also commonly called a split intransitive language, which means the sole argument ("subject") of an intransitive clause (often symbolized as S) is sometimes marked in the same way as an agent of a transitive verb (that is, like a subject such as "I" or "she" in English) but other times in the same way as a direct object (such as "me" or "her" in English). 

The case or agreement of the intransitive argument (S) depends on the degree of volition, or control over the verbal action exercised by the participant. For example, if one tripped and fell, an Adytite speaker would say "I fell." To say "fell-me" (subjective ending) or "fell I" would mean that the person had done it on purpose, such as taking a fall in boxing.
