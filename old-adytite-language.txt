+ Old Adytite Language
++ Adytite Sound Changes
Adytite was an agglutinative Uralic language spoken in the Bronze Age around modern day Eastern Europe, and can be regarded as an early dialect of Proto-Uralic. Adytite is thus related to Finnish, Hungarian, and Estonian. The innovations from Proto-Uralic proper are-

* Pervasive vowel harmony, notably Ä and O umlaut.
* Syncope, loss of unstressed vowels.
* Merging of *ï/ë and *ü to ü.
* Loss of /x/.
* Final /Vw/ > /u/
* Loss of final /r/ in the non-rhotic dialect, Lovataar > Lovataa
* /a/ > /e/ in the environment of /j/, the /j/ was lost in syllabic final position.
* Loss of initial vowels (in some words).
* L-vocalization of medial and final /ɫ/ > /o/.
* Fortition of /j/ > /x/ in post-syncope consonant clusters with velar consonants.
* /ɬ/ and /ɬʲ/ > /θ/. 
* Loss of double segments.
* A loss of nasals in the clusters *Nš, *Nč, *Nć, *Nś, Nľ, Nr, and Nl. 
* /ś/ merger with /s/.
* Loss of palatalization as a secondary feature. 
* /ć/ merger with /c/.

Note that there were two distinct dialects of Adytite, the Dark-L and Light-L dialects respectively. The first is distinguished by the sound change of final /l/, and /l/ in clusters when preceded by a back vowel, to /ɫ/, further changing to /o/. The Light-L dialect didn’t share this innovation, and it was spoken in western Siberia. Some parts of the Valkzaron seem to have been composed by speakers of both dialects, as the phrase Valksaran (“bright words”) is Light-L, the Dark-L equivalent being voksaran.

The Dark-L dialect was also Non-rhotic, and dropped syllable final r's. This dialect stopped being spoken at the turn of the pre-BC millennium.  

++ Vocabulary
Adytite as a great deal of borrowings from Deva (Indo-European) dialects and the Tungusic languages. However, the majority of its vocabulary is directly derived from Proto-Uralic.
