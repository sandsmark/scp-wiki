+ Old Adytite Language
++ Adytite Sound Changes
Adytite was an agglutinative Uralic language spoken in the Bronze Age around modern day Eastern Europe, and can be regarded as an early dialect of Proto-Uralic. Adytite is thus related to Finnish, Hungarian, and Estonian. The innovations from Proto-Uralic proper are:

* Pervasive vowel harmony, notably Ä and O umlaut.
* Syncope, loss of unstressed vowels.
* Merging of *ï/ë and *ü to ü.
* Loss of /x/.
* Final /Vw/ > /u/
* Loss of final /r/ in the non-rhotic dialect, Lovataar > Lovataa
* /a/ > /e/ in the environment of /j/, the /j/ was lost in syllabic final position.
* Loss of initial vowels (in some words).
* L-vocalization of medial and final /ɫ/ > /o/.
* Fortition of /j/ > /x/ in post-syncope consonant clusters with velar consonants.
* /ɬ/ and /ɬʲ/ > /θ/. 
* Loss of double segments.
* A loss of nasals in the clusters *Nš, *Nč, *Nć, *Nś, Nľ, Nr, and Nl. 
* /ś/ merger with /s/.
* Loss of palatalization as a secondary feature. 
* /ć/ merger with /c/.

|| Semivowel ||  ||  || j /j/ ||  ||  || 

Note that there were two distinct dialects of Adytite, the Dark-L and Light-L dialects respectively. The first is distinguished by the sound change of final /l/, and /l/ in clusters when preceded by a back vowel, to /ɫ/, further changing to /o/. The Light-L dialect didn’t share this innovation, and it was spoken in western Siberia. Some parts of the Valkzaron seem to have been composed by speakers of both dialects, as the phrase Valksaran (“bright words”) is Light-L, the Dark-L equivalent being voksaran.

The Dark-L dialect was also Non-rhotic, and dropped syllable final r's. This dialect stopped being spoken at the turn of the pre-BC millennium.  

++ Vocabulary
Adytite has a great deal of borrowings from Deva (Indo-European) dialects and the Tungusic languages. However, the majority of its vocabulary is directly derived from Proto-Uralic.

++ Pronunciation Guide for Noobies
+++ Vowels

* I is pronounced like the long ''ee'' sound in //feet//, never like the short ''i'' in //sit//.

* Ü is pronounced like the ü in Mandarin Chinese and Turkish. It is an ''ee'' sound, but with rounded lips as if someone was saying ''ew''.

* E as in //bet//.

* O as in //boat//.

* U as pronounced like the long ''oo'' in //food//, never like the short ''u'' in //but//.

* Ä as in //cat//.

* A as in //father//, never like the ''a'' in //fate//.

Note: Double spelling indicate a longer duration, but nevertheless a short vowel and its long equivalent are the same vowel. For instance, ''aa'' is pronounced as in //father//, but slightly longer. 

+++ Consonants 

* J is a ''y'' sound as in //year//, and is never pronounced like the ''j'' in //judge//. 

* C and Š are the English ''ch'' and ''sh'' sounds.

* θ is the English ''th'' sound, as in //three//.

* R is like the Spanish trilled r. 

* X is like the german ''ch'' in //bach//.  

Tip: Adytite is a Uralic language, which means that the stops (p, t, c, and k) are not aspirated like the ones in English. In English stops are normally accompanied by a burst of airflow. 

For example put your hand to your mouth while saying //pie//, and then say //spy//. The former is pronounced with aspiration, the latter isn't. Using the guide, try to pronounce Adytite stops like the latter, never the former. In the middle of words, the stops may be voiced like English b, d, j, and g, but since most Uralic languages don't distinguish between voiced and voiceless, it shouldn't make a difference.

++ Grammar
+++ Nouns

Adytite nouns had fourteen noun cases and three numbers, singular, dual and plural. Grammatical gender was not recognized and no Uralic language does so even today. Noun articles were unknown. 
The plural marker of nouns was -t in final position and -j- in non-final position, as seen in Finnish. The dual marker was-k-.

The cases were:
 
* nominative (no suffix)
* accusative -m
* partitive case -ta / -tä
* dative/genitive -n
* essive -na / -nä
* inessive -s
* elative -sta/-stä
* illative -kan
* adessive -l
* abessive -ta / -tä
* comitative -oŋti
* translative -ksi
* ablative case -tol
* lative -ŋ
