> **Incident 9A-4295 - Investigative Conclusion**
> //Per Communications Protocol Delta-7, this report, all attachments, and the associated personnel file are to remain secured and indexed until at least 2235/01/01.//
> 
> It is the determination of our team that the following transmission poses no current or future threat to Foundation security. Analysis of the corrupt data string found a mundane communications error due to incompatibility between systems; no form of encrypted hazard was present, and Memetics found no other trace of anomalous content. Information contained within remains classified per relevant projects. Copies of the full report[[footnote]]See Document TC-C.4295/Alpha/ACR.67823[[/footnote]] submitted to directors of Site-102, Site-122, and Armed Site-47 for further review.

>> **Interviewed:** Clarence Goodson, Site-102 Systems Maintenance
>> **Interviewer:** Agent M. Daniels, Causative Analytics Department
>> **RE:** Routine systems purge: 2012/05/08
>> 
>> **<Begin Log>**
>> **Agent Daniels:** Temporal Agent M. Daniels, following Protocol TC-1.57 upon discovery of Anachronistic Communications Document C9-4295. Please identify yourself for the record.
>> 
>> **Clarence Goodson**: Clarence Goodson, Systems Technician 102-d2, Special Clearance Level Bravo 4/Mining.
>> 
>> **Daniels:** Thank you. We're here to discuss your acquisition of the article in question, on the date of May the eighth, two thousand and twelve. It is our understanding that you came upon the document by accident?
>> 
>> **Goodson:** Well...sort of. You see, I was just cleaning out all of the junk our servers gathered over the last four months, same as we do every four months. I found that little gem squirreled away in the reboot entries; we can't delete those, ya know. And so I thought "Oh boy, here's that bonus I've been needing!" So I extracted it, and dropped it into the queue for removal.
>> 
>> **Daniels:** Without verifying the contents as suitable for a purge?
>> 
>> **Goodson:** Of course not! I'm not incompetent; my record reflects that, at least. I followed all of the standard procedures, ran it through all the filters. It was just a note, with an error string, which seemed to be from the poor indexing. We see it all the time; personnel try to hide their private notes from their supervisors. They do a pretty good job of it, too, but I've reported more than one incident to HR in my time.
>> 
>> **Daniels:** But not this time.
>> 
>> **Goodson:** No, not once I read it.
>> 
>> **Daniels:** For clarification, you admit to having read the contents of the document?
>> 
>> **Goodson:** Yes, I opened the file after it was cleared by the system, and read its contents.
>> 
>> **Daniels:** Are you aware that is in direct violation of Procedure Omni-
>> 
>> **Goodson:** Yes! Yes, I know, I'm not supposed to do that. But look, my job is //boring,// okay? I'm cleared to know enough of what goes on to be fascinated, and I'm stuck making sure the servers are free of cookies! It's harmless enough, you know? Agent Thirteen sneaks off with Researcher X every time he's on-site; Dr. Theta's wife is pregnant, and they're naming their son Rex. It passes the time. I'm aware of the consequences, but at this point, what does it matter? The shit I know is so far beyond my pay-grade I won't be allowed to remember it anyway; I might as well come clean.
>> 
>> **Daniels:** I see. And upon reading the document?
>> 
>> **Goodson:** I reported it to your department, was detained on-site - voluntarily I might add - for something like five hours, and then was brought here to you.
>> 
>> **Daniels:** Thank you, Mr. Goodson. That will be all.
>> **<End Log>**
>> 
>> **Concluding Statement:** //It is my opinion that Mr. Goodson poses no overt risk to Foundation security, and that he be administered appropriate amnestics and reassigned to physical maintenance.// -Agent M. Daniels

>> Mitzy,[[footnote]]A childhood nickname of former researcher █████ ████████.[[/footnote]]
>> 
>> My name is Ezekial Young, and I am the Vice-Chief Engineer aboard the Foundation vessel [[[SCP-2002|SCPS Mendel.]]] Our mission is to secure the future of humanity, to contain our species' unique and beautiful genome, and to protect, if not ourselves, our posterity, from oblivion. A virulent plague spread through our populace, ultimately rendering humanity infertile. We found a way to save ourselves. Five hundred embryos, genetically engineered, will be carried into the future, and when our systems reactivate and bring them out of stasis, humanity can continue.
>> 
>> If only we'd known.
>> 
>> We've neutralized as many of the horrors as we could, and locked the rest away, buried under tonnes of concrete and will. We thought it enough, and the least that we could do. But as a result, the shattered remains of our database is open, and in my research, I discovered the truth. In our haste to save ourselves, we have doomed any hope we had for survival. I have no doubt it was unintentional; details which were once so important fall to the background when faced with a true crisis. Despite my urgings, willfully ignorant of my desperate pleas and the magnitudes of evidence presented, my superiors elected to continue with our mission. But we were doomed from the start.
>> 
>> Find a way to access the database at your Site-47; study the documentation on [[[SCP-2003|Determinative Set XN.]]] It was always believed to be the best possible future, the only viable continuity, and one of utmost importance to bring about. And it remained so, even after all others collapsed following the onset of the plague. They saw us launch, and watched as we returned home. It seemed clear enough, and as the resources of the Foundation were pulled, one by one, to further our project, -2003 shut down. They never saw the end. But I have seen it.
>> 
>> We missed one, and it was one of our own creations: Scranton Reality Anchors.
>> 
>> Utilizing physics we didn't truly understand was always a risk, and one that the Foundation judged acceptable. Same as our drive.
>> 
>> If our ship were to land, and Protocol 2002-Thanos be enacted, we would anchor not just the protected sites, but all of reality. The feedback from our temporal engines will ripple across spacetime, and then there will be but us. We will have secured the future, but in doing so, obliterate all others. Existence will be anchored to a single point. Even with our great strides in technological development and improved understanding of the nature of the universe, I can not begin to fathom the devastation that would ensue. I can not allow that to happen.
>> 
>> My future is doomed, but yours does not have to be. I have enclosed as much data as I can about our drive; it's up to you to do the rest. Do not allow your Foundation to make the same mistakes as mine.
>> 
>> We weren't a religious family in my time; I do not know if you had faith in yours. But pray, Mitzy; pray that one end is enough for a new beginning.

> Interdepartmental investigations proved conclusively that Anachronistic Communications Document C9-4295 did not reach the intended recipient, resulting in a terminated temporal loop. Incidents surrounding SCP-2002 pose no causal threat to Iteration Alpha-001'.[[footnote]]Foundation Operational Reality[[/footnote]] Document reclassified as Artifact 2002/D-42. Investigation deemed closed, pending potential discovery from Armed Site-47.

> By order of O5-10, Temporal Engineering will continue research on Project Scranton, and no further actions are needed at this time.
