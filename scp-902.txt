**Item #:** SCP-902

**Object Class:** Keter 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-902 has been relegated to Artic Base Theta, the only SCP to be contained at this site. Site is to be staffed by a team of fifty security personnel. At this time, no research is to be done on SCP-902. Knowledge of SCP-902 beyond its number is to be limited to level three staff and lower. It is imperative that only a limited number of Senior Staff know of the existence of SCP-902. Only one O5 is allowed to know about SCP-902 at any time. In the event of a security breach from inside Artic Base Theta, the onsite hydrogen bomb is to be detonated remotely.

**Description:** SCP-902 is a box roughly the size of an adult human head. All attempts to accurately measure SCP-902 have failed. SCP 902 appears to be made of lead. Although t box is not locked, anyone attempting to open the box, through means direct, mechanically assisted, or otherwise, will find themselves unable to do so. SCP-902 emits what has been described as a 'ticking' sound, anyone who hears this sound becomes convinced that the item is counting down. Anyone who becomes aware of SCP-902, whether through personal interaction, or by reading this article, becomes convinced that whatever is in the box is horribly dangerous, and needs to be destroyed as soon as it finishes counting down.

**Note:**SCP-902s psychic influence makes it all but impossible to perform any significant work upon it. Therefore, I suggest locking it away somewhere under careful guard, and hoping for the best. -Dr. Coleman, Level 2
