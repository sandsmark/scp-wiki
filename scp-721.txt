title:Scp 721
**Item #:**721

**Object Class:** Safe 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-721 A and B are kept in Dr. Brights office, locked in his wall safe. SCP-721C is permanently assigned to Dr. Bright, for personal use. Use of A or B requires permission from Dr. Bright.

**Description:** 721 is a black metal circle, 7 cm in diameter, covered by a similar black metal mesh on one //italic text//side, and a magnet on the other. The inside metal disc bears an imprint of the words 'The Factory.'The metal appears to be simple steel, and is easily disassembled and destroyed. 721 is identical to SCP-719 and 720.

SCP-721 functions in a similar manner to 719 and 720. A drop of human blood acts as the catalyst, dripped through the mesh screen on top. After this process has been performed, SCP-721 needs to be set upon some form of blank medium, be it paper, audio tape, video tape, or a blank wordpad document.

//Note:// 721 has proved functional on open ended media, such as radios or televison as well.

Once in place, the blood donor becomes capable of transferring anything from his own mind onto the blank medium. The following tests demonstrate the results of such.
