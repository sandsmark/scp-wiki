**Item #:** SCP-721

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** MTF Mu-3 ("Highest Bidders") is assigned to monitor children's toy stores, convenience stores, and toy distribution companies for instances of SCP-721, which are to be confiscated upon discovery. 

Once confiscated, instances of SCP-721 are to be tested using D-class personnel to determine whether they are SCP-721-1, SCP-721-2, or SCP-721-3. Once identified, the instance is to be contained in an appropriately labeled storage locker secured with standard digital, biological, and memetic countermeasures.

If any person asks to have access to SCP-721 and is unable to provide proper, non-counterfeited credentials for any reason, or their motive for testing seems to be illogical, they are to be provided with the false access code "90934". Under no circumstances is testing with SCP-721 to be directly refused.

**Description:** SCP-721 collectively refers to three products developed and released by GoI-011 ("Doctor Wondertainment") in 2017. Instances of SCP-721 are marketed as "Wonder Cans!™", and all instances of SCP-721 are metal cylinders 20 cm in height and 5 cm in diameter. Analysis of SCP-721's inner components has so far been inconclusive, as all instances are filled with non-anomalous aerosol and will cease to function if disassembled.

SCP-721 is activated by pressing a red button near the top of the cylinder. At this point, a varying amount of aerosol will be dispensed from the top of the cylinder. However, SCP-721 will not activate if it is pressed using non-organic means (i.e. a robot arm) or by a non-sentient creature. The organism that does this is hereby referred to as "subject".

||~ Item Designation||~ Item Description||~ Item Function||
||**SCP-721-1**||SCP-721-1 is marketed as "Super-Hyper Thought-Reader Can!" and labeled as such. The instructions on the back of SCP-721-1 instances indicate that its intended use is to "hold top secret conversations away from the prying eyes of the adults!". The label of SCP-721-1 is stark black with white font.||When SCP-721-1 is activated, the subject's conscious thoughts will be audible to those within a 60-meter radius of the subject. Thoughts will take the form of the subject's voice speaking into the listener's ear, and the thought's volume will depend on its intensity. Additionally, the subject will be able to hear the thoughts of others within this radius in the form of voices emanating from SCP-721-1. While the thoughts of most subjects are too disorganized and incoherent for others to interpret properly, with practice, subjects have shown the ability to use SCP-721 to transmit coherent thoughts to those within its active range. SCP-721-1 can be used 20 times before exhaustion of its aerosol supply.||
||**SCP-721-2**||SCP-721-2 is marketed as "Amazing Thought-Transfer Can!" and are labeled as such. The instructions on the back of SCP-721-1 instances indicate that its intended use is to "let kids make fantastic drawings, even if they can't draw themselves!".||When SCP-721-2 is activated, and a blank medium[[footnote]]Includes blank paper, audio tapes, video tapes, blank text files on computers, or open-ended media such as televisions or radios.[[/footnote]] is placed within a 60-meter radius of the subject, the subject will gain control over the medium's content. Subjects are able to transfer any data they are capable of imagining to the medium, and is able to gain control over any data inscribed on the medium after the activation of SCP-721-2. SCP-721-2 is able to be used 7 times before exhaustion of its aerosol supply. Subjects have been able to create high-detail pictures, realistic movies, and any type of audio possible, even if they weren't skilled with drawing and/or postproduction to begin with. ||
||**SCP-721-3**||Instances of SCP-721-3 are not advertised and do not have their own labels; instead, SCP-721-3 carry the labels of SCP-721-1 and -2. It is believed that SCP-721-3 is the result of a malfunction in the manufacturing process of SCP-721-1 and -2.||When SCP-721-3 is activated, the subject's body temperature will steadily increase by three degrees Celsius per second. This increase in temperature will continue, even if the button at its top is depressed, until the subject expires of pyrexia. During this period of time, subjects often report intense migraines. Analysis of SCP-721-3 after activation reveals that the aerosol at its center heats up to 300 degrees Celsius during activation, often resulting in explosion of the cylinder. It is estimated that SCP-721-3 can be used 11 times, but its explosion often prevents repeated use.||

The Foundation is currently in the possession of 43 instances of SCP-721-1, 26 instances of SCP-721-2, and 155[[footnote]]98 of these were recovered from warehouses of [[[marshall-carter-and-dark-hub|Marshall, Carter, and Dark]]].[[/footnote]] instances of SCP-721-3.

**Addendum 02:** Incident 721-1

On 07/16/2017, SCP-721 first appeared in numerous stores in the state limits of Indiana, including Walmarts, Toys-R-Us's, and Targets. It is unknown why this effect was confined to Indiana. Over one million instances of SCP-721 are estimated to have been manifested in this way. Due to Foundation diversion efforts, only 433 instances were purchased by the public.

There are five known instances of usage of SCP-721-3 resulting in death that were made public shortly after SCP-721's release, resulting in Indiana's local press giving attention to these deaths. Several civilians managed to successfully link these deaths to SCP-721-3, and many people created blog and social media posts accusing the manufacturer's of SCP-721, Doctor Wondertainment, of murder.

Dr. Jared, an Indiana native, took notice of this activity, resulting in the Foundation's discovery and classification of SCP-721. An official statement was released by Foundation front company Shell & Carrie Pharmaceuticals stating that these deaths were the result of an extremely rare condition termed "Ectofever Migraines". Foundation connections in various press agencies were also used to reduce coverage of the issue.

**Addendum 03:** Archived Web Page

> = **INTERNET DOCUMENT**
> -----
> **Foreword:** The following document was recovered from the blog of Indiana stay-at-home mother ████ ████████. Page was titled "15 Extremely Odd Diseases" and contained a reference to SCP-721-3. Blog was taken down by Foundation personnel masquerading as enforcement for illegal stock image usage.

> 
> If you thought a regular migraine was bad, boy oh boy, you haven't had an Ectofever Migraine. Ectofever migraines seem to be regular migraines at first, but when combined with a fever, can easily cause you to die from a heatstroke.
> 
> Some people originally thought that this was a side effect of Dr. Wondertainment's Wonder-Cans, simple products that let people read others' minds. However, scientists from all over the world are saying that this is definitely //not// because of migraines. Whether this is just covering up the horrible truth or not cannot be said.

**Addendum 04:** Description of SCP-721-4

SCP-721-4 refers to humanoids that will manifest in locations holding instances of SCP-721-3. Instances of SCP-721-4 are sentient and sapient, and when asked, refer to themselves as "Dr. Wondertainment Radical Recall Directors." SCP-721-4 instances generally decorate themselves with a full-body purple cloak.

The goal of SCP-721-4 is the collection of all instances of SCP-721-3 within the area in which they manifested, which they accomplish by storing SCP-721-3 instances in their robes. It is unknown how SCP-721-4 manages to differentiate between SCP-721-3 and SCP-721-1 and -2. Once they have collected all instances of SCP-721-3, or if they are incapacitated, SCP-721-4 will vanish.

Due to the Foundation's containment of SCP-721, SCP-721-4 have been attempting to gain access to their secure storage lockers. They attempt to accomplish this by masquerading as a Foundation researcher attempting to gain testing access to SCP-721. If refused, SCP-721-4 will often attempt to force their way into the lockers, which, in the past, has incurred heavy damage to not only the lockers, but the surrounding facility. The current Special Containment Procedures accommodate for this by providing an access code that directly paralyzes SCP-721-4 with Class-X cognitohazards.

**Addendum 05:** SCP-721-4 Interaction Log

> = **INTERACTION LOG**
> -----
> //<Begin Log>//
> 
> **SCP-721-4:** Um, excuse me, madam?
> 
> **Dr. Clemson:** Hello, I don't think I've met you yet. You are...?
> 
> **SCP-721-4:** Oh, I'm, uh, Doctor, well, John! Yes, John, is my name! And, so, I need a //wee// bit of help here.
> 
> **Dr. Clemson:** Nice to meet you, Dr. John. What do you need?
> 
> **SCP-721-4:** I was ordered by, um, the O5, to go and do some good old-fashioned testing on the Wonder Cans. And I, um, //know//, yes, know, you're on the project. Could I have the access codes?
> 
> //<Dr. Clemson pauses.>//
> 
> **Dr. Clemson:** What's your FID number?
> 
> **SCP-721-4:** It's just, uh, ah, it's right here! It's 508909.
> 
> **Dr. Clemson:** Aren't the first four digits of the FID number supposed to add up to the last two digits?
> 
> **SCP-721-4:** Oh, no wait, that's not my ID number! I, um, left my glasses at my, well, house, that I live in, so, I can't read my ID number.
> 
> **Dr. Clemson:** Can I have your badge?
> 
> **SCP-721-4:** Of course!
> 
> //<SCP-721-4 hands Dr. Clemson their ID badge. Judging from recovered camera footage, the badge is a crude forgery.>//
> 
> **Dr. Clemson:** Why are we testing SCP-721, again?
> 
> **SCP-721-4:** Well, that's pretty obvious, and it's all because, so, if you think about it, we haven't really tried freezing the Wonder Cans yet! Yeah, yeah, we need to freeze them, to see what happens!
> 
> //<Dr. Clemson pauses.>//
> 
> **Dr. Clemson:** Yep, makes sense. Code is 90934. Knock yourself out!
> 
> **SCP-721-4:** Oh, thank you kindly, madam!
> 
> //<SCP-721-4 runs off-frame.>//
> 
> //<End Log>//
> 
>> **Closing Statement:** Later security footage shows SCP-721-4 attempting entry to SCP-721's containment locker, only to be subdued before vanishing.
