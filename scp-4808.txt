**Addendum:** Incident Report

PoI-3281 [[footnote]]Legal name ████████ ████, had a known history of failed businesses, early employment terminations, and in one case, an attempted connection with GoI-9272 ("Potz Blitz"). Lack of employment often cited as a "lack of motivation"[[/footnote]] was found dead in their home due to self-termination by hanging. An instance of SCP-4808-1 appeared; however, its throat was slit and the specimen was dead. Investigation of PoI-3281's apartment found several other suicide implements, all broken. PoI-3281's suicide note is as follows:

> It's all a joke, just a long, unfulfilling joke. The punchline isn't worth it. No matter what I try, the punchline isn't worth it. Why not just cut the joke short?
> 
> If my entire life is a joke, it's not even a good fucking joke.
