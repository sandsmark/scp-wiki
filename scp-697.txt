**Item #:** SCP-697

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-697 are kept in Storage Section-V of Site 18. The area is forty feet below ground level and lined with steel, ensuring only authorized personnel may enter. All unauthorized persons attempting to gain access are terminated on sight.

Each instance of SCP-697 is sealed in a depressurized, four-inch thick titanium container to avoid accidental activation. Removal from the containers is restricted to three at a time for Level 4 access approved experiments only. Under no circumstances are any instances of SCP-697 to leave Site 18. Should accidental spills occur at any point, Site 18 is to be evacuated, and the area affected incinerated. Large scale spills shall lead to total abandonment of the Site, and a quarantine of the surrounding area for eight square kilometers.

Further information pertaining to spilling of SCP-697 outside of Site 18 is located in Document-697-Theta.

**Description:** SCP-697 consists of the contents of one-hundred (100) toxic chemical containment drums, consistent with those used by Duslo a.s. for waste disposal. All are in either perfect or near-perfect condition, and three have yet to be breached by the Foundation or other persons. Each drum is filled to the brim with an as-yet-unidentified chemical.

When exposed to any substance other than the drums, SCP-697 triggers a highly complex chemical process that converts all forms of solid matter around it into fully-formed plant based lifeforms within seconds of contact. Flora and fauna undergo an alteration of the genetic code, changing their cell structure at a base level. How inanimate objects are altered is currently unknown, but the process appears to involve the creation and evolution of single-celled life forms to complex organisms much faster than should be possible.

The plants created by SCP-697 do not match any sort of flora found known to man at this time, and work in entirely different ways.  Photosynthesis, along with the reliance on nitrogen and carbon dioxide are notably absent, and a product gas composed of Argon and Cobalt (supposedly impossible, given the composition of the atmosphere) is given off. The new plants also move through their breathing cycle at approximately six times the speed of average Terran plants. As of this writing, the only viable method of desctruction is combined incineration and neon gas saturation (see Experiment 697-003).

Though initial contact with the plants is not fatal, long term exposure has proven extremely hazardous to terrestrial lifeforms. Inhalation will gradually inhibit cardiopulmonary function, while contact with the neurotoxic leaves or flowers results in a strong numbness that quickly covers the entire body, with nervous system failure occurring soon after. The average time from initial exposure to death is thirteen (13) hours. No treatment for either effect has been developed.

In addition to creating new lifeforms, SCP-697's chemicals are capable of replicating spreading themselves out far beyond the initial area of effect. Prior to the banning of off-site testing, ranges observed extended out to six kilometers. The above method for killing the plants formed also aids in halting the spread of chemicals.

**Addendum-697-001:** Six (6) instances of SCP-697 were initially discovered off the coast of █████, California in the spring of 20██. Fortunately, no spills had occurred at the time, but the incident prompted mass investigations of Duslo a.s.' waste disposal practices, drawing Foundation attention. Over a period of six months, fifty (50) of the drums currently in containment were discovered, with the rest gradually revealing themselves over an extended period of time. The current average discovery rate of drums containing SCP-697 is one every three weeks.

**Addendum-697-002:** Much speculation has gone into the origin of SCP-697. Duslo a.s. has denied any responsibility for its creation, but have confessed to experimenting with various chemicals for use in the Vietnam War. Others within the Foundation have speculated that the drums and chemicals are of alien origin. Neither theory prevails at this point in time, though research teams are actively studying SCP-697 to determine its origin.
