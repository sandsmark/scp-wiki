title:The Janitor's Closet
//You approach a closet on Site-30. A note is posted on the door. It states://

"Heyo. If you're reading this, you have approached a dark and mysterious corner of this facility. You're also about to enter my personal living quarters. Yeah. I live in Site-30's broom closet. What of it? Anyway, if you go in there, you're gonna find a bunch of mops and some papers I found. Those papers are my own business, and I'd rather you not read them. Cool?"

"-Janitor Worth"

//You enter the closet to find a bunch of mops, brooms, a bucket or two. One such bucket is on the desk, and a bunch of papers are inside the bucket. On the side of the bucket, it says "Level 1 Clearance Required"//

//You look in the bucket.//

> [[[SCP-3358|SCP-3358]]]: "[[*user Uncle Nicolini]] and I were taking a trip to Washington, when we were chilling with a few reality benders. We were pretty high, and they were going on about this invisible apartment building. I visited it, thought it was cool. But Nicolini ratted them out. Fucking narc."

> [[[SCP-3908|SCP-3908]]]: "So, this thing is SCP-3908. I mean, I know that. But the file won't tell me anything else about the thing. Whoever wrote this should probably be fired. They're pretty terrible at their job."

> [[[Site-30's Janitor|Site-30's Janitor]]]: "Hey would ya look at that? Someone took the time to write a tale about ol' Worth. Might I add, the mop is a rather unappreciated weapon. Simple, effective and cheap."

> [[[4000contestjanitorcakeworth|SCP-4000 Entry]]]: "I met this lady once on a date. She told me she was a mother and that she works to protect children. So at that point I was tryin' to get outta the date. But it was actually real easy. I swore one time and she just vanished. Told me I had a sailor's mouth. I disagree. Sailors don't drink as much mop water as I do."
