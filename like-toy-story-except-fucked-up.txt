> The **MA-Class Mass Animation Scenario** is the Foundation's term for any scenario wherein a large number of nonliving things display intelligence or mobility to the point of jeopardizing normalcy. This may or may not also entail an "SK-Class Dominance Shift", depending on the power and resources available to newly animated things.
> 
> An MA-Class Mass Animation Scenario should not be declared until at least one of the following is affirmed:
> * Return of the situation to normalcy, i.e. deactivating the newly animated entities and erasing memories of the event, is infeasible.
> * Location and destruction of the affected things is considered impractical or unethical.
