“What is this?.”

This is Gears Day - an excuse for us to write creepypasta as a birthday gift for the one and only [[*user Dr Gears]].

“How do I add my own?”

Well, like this, Mystery Editor.

Toss in a collapsible. Give us the name of your creepy pasta and your name as the "show", and put in a special birthday message as the "hide."  Make sure you put in a line break.

Have fun, guys! And enjoy Gears Day!

> I should be less surprised. We knew you would return, didn’t we? //The one who returns//. That’s you. 
>
> You’ll always come back for them, won’t you? For the //stories//. Have you heard the tale of the fairy in a bottle? I’m sure you have, once upon a time. Or maybe the myth of the moon who cried - ah! What about the twins, those twins who saw light and shadow?
> 
> You’re a funny one, my friend. A strange breed... you with your infinite hunger for the story. Like a voracious beast, you devastate every page, every line, every letter - until there is nothing left. A proper, regal force of nature, an uncompromising glutton of the fable, satisfied only until you again yearn for the next tale to be told. And it **will** be told. Nothing else will do. You cannot //live// without them, can you? 
> 
> And I’m not so sure they can live without you.

> … Mm. We wish you a happy birthday, Gears. Until the next one.

When I was younger, my family lived in an older, wartime house in one of the older suburbs. It was a nice house, kinda small but we made do. 
 
I mean, not that my brother or I would know. He’s a few years younger than me and used to be stuck to me like glue. We got along really well, I mean, I was kinda a crappy older brother sometimes, but I never beat him up or yelled. 
 
I remember when he was little he used to have nightmares all the time. Maybe like four, five times a week for months he would come into my room and beg to sleep in my bed. He was maybe three or four- No, three, he was probably four, and I was eight or nine? Whatever. Just I remember he would come in, and be all gentle and tell me he had a really bad dream and wanted to ‘be in my room for safety’.
 
I was really annoyed for a while, but I gave up and yielded after the… I don’t know, four months? I remember just him walking in and he was nearly in tears. He laid down and curled up and I just… It was hard. He was so //scared//. He was trembling. I never saw anything like that before. I don’t think I’ve ever seen anybody that scared before...
 
I’m sorry, it’s hard to remember that. It stuck with me, you know? So I started staying up later and waiting for him to come in. It was always around 1 in the morning. Four or five days a week. Mom and Dad thought it was just night terrors - mom had them when she was little, she grew out of them. I didn’t really believe that, I was nine. 
 
Once we were watching cartoons and I asked him what his bad dreams were about. He only said “the crawly thing is there”, and refused to… explain anything more. He was a little kid, but I was frustrated, I wanted my little brother to stop being scared at night.
 
I remember it vividly. That night I snuck out and went to sleep in his bed. He was sound asleep in mine, I just went to his and laid down under the covers. Maybe I would have bad dreams if I was here? He never had them in my room, or at grandma’s house, or-

I’m sorry I’m just remembering. I just remember… I heard some kind of scratching noise. It was like this soft scratching- not like it was gentle, but scratching something soft against the wall? I looked around in the dark for it and-

It was just in the dark, it was on the ceiling. I just saw this… white face, just this little round thing on the ceiling, with these big black eyes. They were so watery looking, just these gross black circles reflecting the street lights.
 
I turned on the light and it just twisted and went away. Like it was gone. I left the bedroom and went back to my bed and tried to forget about it.
 
… I was a good brother, I think. He’s a good kid, he’s a little bit of a pain in the butt but he’s a good kid. He gets in trouble all the time. Grounded a bunch of times when we were little - oh, no, just little stuff. He’ll forget a birthday or run a curb or walk over a neighbour’s garden but it’s all harmless stuff now. Even when he was younger he just got grounded all the time.
 
Me? I just got grounded once. Dad found me trying to bury stuff next to a burned up patch of the back lawn. I was… well. I was nine. Our new cat found a… big mouse, and brought it to me as a present. I was just trying to bury it, and I thought I should give it a funeral pyre. Swear that’s all it was.
 
She’s a good cat. Always liked sleeping in my brother’s room. Hey, do you have a cat? Let’s talk about my cat instead.

“Hey, hey! Look! Over there!”
 
“Skylar, I’m driving I can’t look.”
 
“No just take a peak. The clouds finally parted over there!”
 
After four hours of driving up and down the Rocky Mountains, we finally found the stars. Which was a relief because I was certain this star gazing trip was going to flop.
 
“Oh shit you’re right.”
 
“No you need to take a left.”
 
“That’s not what I— oh never mind.”
 
“You mind if I roll the windows down?”
 
“Nah, go ahead.”
 
 Cool midsummer air rushed over my face. It woke me up a little, which was nice. Don’t want to crash the car in the middle of the mountains at half-past midnight. I took the left, and then a right.
 
“How much you bet the clouds are going to close up the moment we get there?”
 
“Oh don’t even say that.”
 
“You know that’s this night has been going.”
 
I scowled. Nat laughed a little.
 
“You know I’m just giving you a hard time.”
 
“I know, I know.”
 
“Besides, it’s more about the company than the stars.”
 
“True but… it’s been so long for me. Too much light pollution back at school for me to do this during the semester.”
 
I took another turn subconsciously. I navigate winding mountain roads mostly by muscle memory. They all work the same where it takes a bend followed by another bend. At some point there were guard rails anymore, but it didn’t quite register for me. We were too deep in conversation. I used to say that stargazing is just an elaborate excuse to talk to someone for a few hours.
 
“Wait! Pull off here!”
 
I don’t remember when we entered a bowl, but we had. I pulled off the dirt road and stopped the car.
 
“We made it,” Skylar said. She pointed up, where the clouds had parted just enough for the Milky Way TJ shine through. We jumped out of the car and climbed up on the roof. It was wonderful. Hundreds and hundreds of little lights twinkled overhead. I hadn’t looked at a star map beforehand, so I couldn’t recognize any of the constellations. But that didn’t matter.
 
“Hey, pretty solid find tonight,” I said.
 
“You even know where we are?”
 
“No, but the car has GPS.”
 
It’d been so long since I’d seen stars. The clouds parted further, and the view began to engulf me. I felt small.
 
“I miss this.”
 
“Same.”
 
“It’s a shame we won’t get to do this for another three months.”
 
“Shame.”
 
The stars looked brighter as the view came closer. It molded over me, like a blanket.
 
“Thanks, Sky.”
 
And then clouds closed in. The view was gone, and with it the stars.
 
I drove home alone.

[[collapsible show="Corner of the Game Room, by UraniumEmpire" hide="Happy Birthday Gears."]]

This isn't supposed to be a scary story. Just stuff I grew up with.
 
I mostly slept in the game room. Lars had his bedroom (oldest brothers typically did), Sam had her bedroom (and sisters rarely shared), and the littlest kid got to sleep on a futon in the game room we never quite got around to making part of the home.
 
Well, I guess it was technically part of the house. Just not really the home, if that makes any sense. You could chill in the living room, sure; I liked to, at least before my parents got home. Kitchen was nice, at least when you're making things for your friends. Sometimes I'd even explore the crawl space under the stairs, back when dad got too old to stomp. My home was pretty nice, I liked to think.
 
The game room was just creepy, really. Not even in the fun kinda creepy, like when we told stories about the bandaged man. Just sort of off-putting, in the kind of way photos on craigslist might be. Nobody really used it but me (parents didn't like guests and all that), so it was pretty sparse. No real "games", unless you counted my DS (which was taken out of the room often) or the broken ping pong table.
 
I don't know why, but we kept a lot of weird paintings up there, in the corner. Not really hung up or anything, no, just sitting around. I guess it's stuff my parents bought but never really got around to putting up, though I guess I question their taste. I mean, I didn't even really recognize them, style-wise. Lots of weird shapes and weird people, some doing weird things but most just staring.
 
I've often wondered what it is with weird paintings. I mean, I suppose they weren't any different from the things we draw, but the frame somehow makes them more…there. Like a testament to some weirdo's personality. More…human-like, I guess is one way of putting it. You sorta feel like there's some sort of action they're taking by existing. Maybe just that when you look at the painting, it looks back.
 
Maybe they were haunted? Who knows. I mean, I feel like everyone's seen that one weird painting they thought blinked back. Heck, a few of the game room ones did (some more than others). But does that mean they're special, or that humans just think they're special?
 
Of course, again, I sorta had to sleep in the game room, with a bed on the opposite wall of those weird paintings. Made it pretty hard to fall asleep.
 
Looking back, though, I think I was a bit more concerned with the choices I had. If I wanted to lay on my left side, for instance, I had to face the paintings. It's…pretty hard, knowing the weird faces are making eye contact with you. But then if I went to sleep on my right side, I had to deal with them staring at the back of my head. Mostly I just slept face down.
 
Tried moving them to face the wall, one time. Touching them felt weird, like there was some sort of imaginary television static, but nothing ever jumped out to kill me, at least. Just like them that they'd eventually be turned back to face my bed. It wasn't even all at once, either: over the course of a few days, one or two would just be back to facing me and my bed.
 
It was probably mom.
 
Eventually, I just decided to make an impromptu blanket fort and sleep in that. It was pretty awesome, I had to say. I mean, blanket forts are usually awesome, but it felt nice to be quote-unquote "protected" from the paintings.
 
Coming out each morning, though, I was still face to face with the weirdo paintings.
 
I don't think my siblings liked them much, either. I mean, I guess Lars shouldn't be expected to; Bro was jumpier than a beaten dog. Sam was better about hiding it, I think. She used to joke that I had an older older brother, Mark, who was fed to the paintings for being naughty. She was probably joking, but I didn't really find it funny.
 
Mom and dad didn't talk about the paintings much. I mean, I tried not to listen to dad, which is probably how I survived this long, but mom was mum on the issue. The few times I thought about asking her, I thought better…actually, I think I did ask her, one time. I don't remember her answer, but I remember it failing to stop my curiosity.
 
You know, come to think of it, I never really noticed either of them bringing a painting home. I mean, I don't know if the paintings ever changed; I think they did, at least. But it was always when I wasn't home, if it happened. Maybe I just wasn't looking hard enough.
 
Few years ago, bro left for college, and I got his room. I missed Lars, sure, but I was kinda glad not to have to look at those paintings anymore.
 
Not much else happens in this story. Three years later, and I'm off, too.
 
I don't really miss home. Having my own room is cool. I don't gotta deal with dad (though apparently mom's kicked the old sod out since then). Most of all, I'm just sorta happy I don't have to sleep in that room, again.

"We got to brush those teethies, Kara. Come on, brush-brush-brush, it'll be quick." The infant ignored Tim's pleading and continued to squirm, crying in protest, until he finally wrestled her head upright and jammed the brush in her mouth.
 
"Good girl! Okay, quick now, brush brush brush." Sometimes she'd hold still once the toothbrush went in, but not tonight. She kept struggling and finally caught her tiny foot against his chest, pushing herself away from him. He nearly dropped her and tightened his grip, startled.
 
That was when he heard the noise.
 
It was like the dry crack of a tree branch, loud enough to echo in their tiny bathroom.
 
So loud it took him a moment to realize Kara had stopped crying.
 
He lifted her up, unbelieving. The baby's neck and back had snapped completely. He could hear the small bones in her spine crumbling against each other as her beautiful head drooped over his hand, limp as a rag.
 
No. How? No. No, no, no, oh baby, baby, baby—
 
"Marlene!" he sobbed, running for the living room. He hugged his daughter to his chest as gently as he could, but still he could hear her bones crackling against each other, a bag of twigs. "Fuck! No! Marlene!"
 
"Honey, what?" She started to stand as he rushed around the corner, but when she pushed herself off the couch her arm snapped at the wrist with a sickening crunch. She didn't have time to scream; her cheek struck the coffee table on the way down, crumpling her face like a rotten pumpkin. She lay still.
 
He had no words left - just a wail of anguish as he started across the room to her. He took one step, and then another, and then his shin snapped underneath him, pointed bone shredding through his calf.
 
The last sound he heard was shattering, like porcelain, as his skull hit the floor.

You've never seen her like this before.

In all the years that you've known her, you've never seen her like this before.
 
It's a shock, then, to see her so clearly distraught. To see the fat tears rolling down her cheeks, her ruby red lips quivering in despair, and great, racking shudders overcoming her shoulders. What could have possibly happened to make her feel this way?

You've known her since she was a little girl, barely big enough to walk on her own. Even then, she was beautiful in your eyes. It was the first moment that you laid eyes on her that she changed your life. So happy, so innocent, and so full of life; she wasn't like anyone that you had ever seen before. It was at that moment that you decided that she was perfect.
 
Which is why it was so shocking when you saw her like this.
 
Ah, well. In the end, you suppose she wasn't any different from the rest. It's a shame, you mused, as you finished climbing through her window, knife in hand.
 
Better luck next time.
