**Item #:** SCP-542

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-542 is to be kept in a 8m x 8m room with attached, small bathroom and may submit requests for furnishings barring anything that could be modified into surgical tools. Notable requests of SCP-542 include, to date
*One queen size bed, no blankets or sheets, bare mattress (Approved)
*Two large work desks (Approved)
*One large wardrobe (Approved)
*A selection of heavy coats, lab jackets, and pants (Approved)
*Several full-length mirrors (Denied)
*A selection of sewing supplies, along with bolts of cloth (Approved initially, denied after Incident 542-B-3)
*Several large bookcases, filled with anatomy and medical texts both old and new (Approved)
*A chess set (Approved)
*Blank-paged notebooks and various writing utensils (Approved)
*Industrial-grade deep sinks (Denied)
*Steel nail file (Denied. Given wooden/sandpaper emery board in replacement)
*Nail Clippers (Denied)

The room is to remain locked, dead bolted, and barred with at least two Class D guards on duty at any time. SCP-542 is to be fed two meals per day, delivered by Class D personnel, and as per request be given an injection of fresh blood (1 pint) per week.

When SCP-542 begins to suffer from organ failure, he may request a fresh organ to be supplied, and Foundation Medical Personnel will sedate him and perform the surgery. Despite constant requests, SCP-542 may not be allowed to perform invasive surgery upon himself except during observed testing. Old and discarded organs or tissue are to be collected for testing.

In the event that SCP-542 should escape confinement, SCP-542 may be subdued by high doses of tranquilizers or being tangled in a net.

**Description:** SCP-542 identified that they have been, at one time, a typical human of Caucasian descent, identifying as German in nationality. This story is supported by the fact that German appears to be his first language, and he speaks all other languages with a German accent. SCP-542 requests to be called "Herr Chirurg" or "Surgeon" by staff and is fluent in German, English, and French, and can speak a small bit of Polish and Italian. Standard IQ tests have revealed 542's IQ to range around 150, placing him as high intelligence. It is unknown how old 542 is, as testing on any tissues has revealed nothing. He claims to have been 'dreadfully normal' before World War II started, and claims to have worked for the Nazi party, even if he found their goals 'boringly simple'.

He has been described as a "Frankenstein's Monster" in appearance. SCP-542 may hide his odd features under heavy clothing, but prefers to wear only a nice pair of slacks, revealing his hunched form, distended gut, warped ribcage, and bizarre arm structure. His skin is made from patches of various hues and shades, some of these healed together with scars while others are still stitched together. Non-symmetrical bone and muscle structure reveals that he has replaced the majority of his body over time, and admits to having worked with "helpers" before to replace such things as portions of his own spinal cord. Although his appearance can change with surgery, his arms are always too long for his body, and his hands have been modified greatly to have additional joints in the fingers.

The skin is pulled rather tightly over 542's face, giving him a somewhat skeletal appearance along with the tendency for his bones to bulge through his skin. His teeth, it should be noted, are collected from different individuals, some of them not even human for all appearances. It's not uncommon for him to cough to vomit blood, and as such requires infusions of fresh blood approximately once per week. He currently boasts two hearts and multiples of several other organs and organ systems. How 542 keeps track of his own structure while performing surgery is unknown, but he likens it to 'having a very good memory'.

DNA testing on all tissues is inconclusive, and reveals fragmented DNA. It is unknown how he is able to accept different blood types and multiple organs without suffering from organ rejection or allergic reactions, nor how he is able to function while preforming invasive surgery on himself, even while inserting extra brain matter into his skull. SCP-542 is to be kept alive for observation and testing on the process that keeps him alive.

SCP-542 behaves in a surprisingly pleasant manner most of the time, enjoying lengthy conversations about science and biology, politics, and long games of chess. However, when an organ begins to fail or part of his body becomes necrotic, he undergoes a drastic personality change, stalking and observing people from a distance. Additional information on his habits and attacks may be found in the addendum.
