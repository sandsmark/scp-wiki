**Description:** 
SCP-182 appears to be a fairly average, Caucasian male of about 17-years of age.  SCP-182 has remained at the facility for upwards of █ years, but has not aged in any apparent fashion.  SCP-182, who has told staff that his name is “Saint,” is approximately 2m tall (about 6’2”) and weighs approximately 60kg (130lbs.) SCP-182 must eat, drink, exercise, sleep, and all other functions of a “normal” human being.  The only difference from SCP-182 and a "normal" human being, apart from his apparent anti-aging properties, is the fact that SCP-182 or “Saint” can read peoples thoughts, on both a conscious and unconscious level.

According to SCP-182’s own admissions he did not always possess this ability.  SCP-182 claims that there was some sort of “accident” involving him, though what sort he refuses to say, and the following morning he woke up in the hospital and overheard one nurse in the room remark on his attractiveness.  When SCP-182 thanked the woman, a look of confusion crossed her face, and she claimed to have not said anything, though admitted to thinking it.  Ever since, SCP-182 has learned to “control” his powers, usually only reading thoughts when attempting to do so.  When he does this, SCP-182 will stare at the face of the person whose  thoughts he is listening to, and his face will become almost blank.  The look has been compared to that of someone simply lost in thought, or wholly entranced in a book.  SCP-182 has also claimed that occasionally he will “catch” a “stray thought” while not trying.

As far as SCP-182 knows, he must be at least in the same room as someone to read their thoughts, however on one occasion SCP-182 asked to see a Professor of Level-4 clearance whom he had never met, by name. SCP-182 does not remember this event at all, adamantly denying its occurrence.  Note: Those with Level 2 Security Clearance should see document 182-1 for more information on the “Unusual Telepathic Reach Event”

SCP-182 is usually kind, though prone to occasionally overreact to situations. SCP-182 has been known to enter stages where he is “moody” and will sit on his bed, glaring at the wall for the entire time he is awake, before simply lying down and going to sleep.  SCP-182 does not remember these days, but on the following days reports an increased level of happy feelings.  It has been suggested that when SCP-182 is “moody” he is purging his mind of all the negative feelings building up in him due to the many thoughts he inevitably hears daily.  When not “moody” SCP-182 loves to talk to most anyone, though he has obviously reacted negatively to anyone thinking badly of him.  He is extremely friendly towards females, however continually turns down romantic advances from them. In one case the female staff voted on the most attractive male worker, and he was placed into SCP-182’s room.  ██ █████ merely asked SCP-182 to “Tell me about yourself.” SCP-182 then began telling ██ █████ about himself, but when he told SCP-182 he was bored and acted rather rudely, SCP-182 reacted with a very stern order for ██ █████ to “get out, then!” and to “never come back, or else.”

It should also be noted that SCP-182 became romantically infatuated with ███ ███████, and entered a “moody” stage for a record three days after ███ ███████ was terminated.  After the three days were over he seemed totally cheerful and refuses to talk about it, claiming he likes to “move past my darker times.”

**Addendum 182-1:** To note, SCP-182 Willingly entered the facility, though how he knew about it remains a mystery.  According to ███ ███████, who was a Level-3 research scientist on a short leave to be with his birthing wife at the time, SCP-182 was walking by when he suddenly stopped, rushed up to ███ ███████ and said “You can help me! I belong in your custody.”  This event transpired in the city of  [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Addendum 182-2:** It has been suggested that SCP-182 be used as a “translator” with other SCPs who appear capable of thought, but not of communication.  SCP-182 has, as of ██th ███ 200█ turned this offer down, with given reason as ‘I feel uneasy around any of the other SCPs, regardless of thought functions and ability displayed by SCP.’

**Addendum 182-3:** SCP-182 seems to be warming up to a few other SCPs, as he has had lengthy conversations with [[[SCP-007]]], [[[SCP-030]]], [[[SCP-040]]], [[[SCP-103]]], [[[SCP-139]]], and [[[SCP-343]]] on at least one occasion.  He seems to be particularly fond of [[[SCP-139]]], and enjoys talking to him as much as possible.
It should also be noted that whenever anyone mentions [[[SCP-173]]], whether out loud or in thought, while near SCP-182, he promptly stops speaking, even in mid word, and begins crying and sobbing uncontrollably, before entering a “moody” stage for the rest of the “cycle”.  The cycle, it should be noted, ends once the sun either sets or rises, depending on its location when his “moody” fit started. Once one of these events occurs, he promptly snaps out of it.  The reasons why are unknown, as SCP-182 has no recollections of when he is “moody.”  Also, SCP-182 has claims to have never seen [[[SCP-173]]], and has passed every polygraph taken with this statement.

**Addendum 182-4:** SCP-182 has, inexplicably, become infatuated with [[[SCP-076]]]-2, despite never having seen “Able” in either physical, or photographic form.  He claims to speak to him, though when asked how SCP-182 merely smiles and replies, ‘I’m done answering questions about Able.’  The most confusing part of this incident is the fact that it was unknown to staff that SCP-182 could not only read thoughts, but speak telepathically.  To date, the only creature SCP-182 has apparently spoken to is [[[SCP-076]]]-2.  When asked if SCP-182 knew he had this power, he smiled and in his usual mysterious manner replied 'I don't.'

**Addendum 182-5:** SCP-182 has expressed a mild interest in meeting [[[SCP-363]]], though when this was denied, SCP-182 smiled lightly and replied, “I thought so.” When questioned as to his intents, SCP-182 [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Addendum 182-6:** SCP-182 has encountered [[[SCP-435]]], and received █ █████████, as such SCP-182 is the only SCP to encounter SCP-435 to date.

**Addendum 182-7:** SCP-182 has been questioned about his lack of aging, and merely shrugs, saying that ‘I aged normally outside the facility.’ ''[DATA EXPUNGED]''

**Addendum 182-8:** Dr.Gears has filed a request to attempt to use SCP-182 to communicate with [[[SCP-682]]].  Request is pending approval, as concerns have been raised about the effect of contact with SCP-682 on SCP-182, and about the highly adaptable nature of SCP-682. When asked about his willingness for this event to occur SCP-182 laughed, saying "I wouldn't even go near Josie," [[[SCP-529]]], "for two weeks after getting here.  If I can catch a thought while outside his containment center, I'll consider it, but I am not going in under any circumstances."

**Addendum 182-9:** Testing is underway to find if there is any way to block SCP-182 from reading a person's mind.  So far the only way is to stay away from SCP-182.  Difficulties are being experienced in testing because staff does not know how, exactly, SCP-182 reads minds, and therefor doesn't know what to attempt to block.  SCP-182 has, since testing began, refused to answer any questions, and will only speak the thoughts he is reading as his end of the experiment.  The reasons for SCP-182's sudden and recent unwillingness to answer questions is unknown, however [[[SCP-343]]] joked that, 'maybe Saint and Able broke up?'  When questioned, neither of the two would answer pertaining to one another.

**Addendum 182-10:** SCP-182 stated that 'what [[[SCP-058]]]

 says makes perfect sense to me, and I'm surprised that you smart guys don't get it.'  Subsequently, it was finally decided that any staff with any sort of knowledge involving classified or Keter class SCPs are to be isolated from SCP-182, as he has the potential to obtain all knowledge of every SCP.  Someone as obviously unstable as SCP-182 having this knowledge yields dangerous and unpredictable results.

**Document 182-1:** [Unusual Telepathic Reach] 
“Exactly one week after entering the facility of his own accord SCP-182 suddenly stopped what he was saying, stood still for approximately 30 seconds, and then asked to see ‘████ ███’, who was a Level-4 professor at the time.  SCP-182 refused to even acknowledge any questions until ████ ███ arrived.  Upon this, SCP-182 leaned close to ████ ███ and began whispering in his ear.  According to ████ ███, SCP-182 said ‘It’s ok, ████, they’ll forgive you.’ And then, as an afterthought, ‘And thanks, but no thanks.’  ████ ███ says that he was worried about missing his kids’ birthday (he has twins), and to the latter statement, ████ ███ simply blushes, and will give no response. ████ ███ has since been terminated.
SCP-182 has no recollection of any event after he stopped answering questions, and immediately following the event he simply started speaking again.” –Scientific log of Dr. ████████
