**Item #:** SCP-182

**Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-182 is to be kept in a room 4 m x 4 m, which itself should be in the middle of a larger chamber measuring 60 m x 60 m. This larger chamber serves as a buffer zone for his telepathy, and no unauthorized personnel are to enter within this range. 

SCP-182's inner chamber should be furnished as a standard bedroom, and have access to a small bathroom. All meals and other materials are to be delivered by a Level-1 personnel approved by [REDACTED], and all interviews with the subject are to be conducted via remote means. Under no circumstance are any personnel with knowledge of other Euclid or Keter level SCPs allowed into SCP-182's chambers.

Should SCP-182 need to be transported for any reason, both sedatives and Class-A amnesiacs are to be administered as a precaution.

**Description:** SCP-182 appears to be a fairly average Caucasian male about seventeen (17) years of age, approximately 2 m tall and weighing approximately 68 kg. SCP-182 has remained at the facility for upwards of █ years, but shows no signs of aging. However, SCP-182 must eat, drink, exercise, sleep, and perform all the functions of a normal human being.  The only anomalous properties SCP-182 displays are his apparent anti-aging properties and the ability to read thoughts. 

SCP-182 appears to clearly hear the surface thoughts and feel the emotions of any beings within approximately twenty (20) meters, but can reliably hear "noise" up to fifty (50) meters away. SCP-182 occasionally claims to clearly hear some "stray thoughts" well beyond this range, some estimated to be upwards of  ███ kilometers away. This process seems to be wholly involuntary and always active to some degree, much like auditory perception in normal humans. The subject reportedly hears both thought in "language" and thoughts as ideas or suggestions that transcend language, as well as emotions. SCP-182 can seemingly hear the thoughts of both humans and animals, but is more easily able to comprehend human thoughts.

SCP-182 is usually amiable and highly social, but is prone to emotional instability, often overreacting to situations. Subject is prone to both bouts of rage and uncontrollable crying and sobbing. SCP-182 has been known to enter stages where he is "moody" and will sit on his bed, becoming inert and simply glaring at the wall for hours, until simply lying down and going to sleep. SCP-182 does not remember these days, but on the following days reports an increased level of happiness. It has been suggested that when SCP-182 is "moody" he is purging his mind of all the negative feelings building up in him due to the many thoughts he inevitably hears daily.

**Addendum 182-1:**According to SCP-182, he did not always possess the ability to read thoughts, and claims it was caused by some sort of "accident", though the subject refuses to elaborate on the matter. Subject furthermore claims to have aged normally before this incident.

**Addendum 182-2:** It has been suggested that SCP-182 be used as a “translator” with other SCPs who appear capable of thought, but not of communication. O5-█ permission is pending.

**Addendum 182-3:** SCP-182 has, inexplicably, become infatuated with [[[SCP-076]]]-2, despite never having seen "Able" in either physical or photographic form. Though once claiming to speak with SCP-076, when asked how, SCP-182 refuses to comment. These claims, if true, imply that SCP-182 is not only able to read thoughts, but to speak telepathically.  To date, the only creature SCP-182 admits to speaking to in this manner is [[[SCP-076]]]-2. When asked directly, SCP-182 denies knowledge or possession of this ability, even under duress.

**Addendum 182-4:** Dr. Gears has filed a request to attempt to use SCP-182 to communicate with [[[SCP-682]]] and other sentient SCPs. Request is pending approval, as concerns have been raised about the effect of contact with SCP-682 on SCP-182, and about the highly adaptable nature of SCP-682. SCP-182 has expressed refusal to cooperate with such tests if approved, and appears to be fearful of other SCP objects.

**Addendum 182-5:**  Testing is underway to stop SCP-182's abilities from functioning on personnel.  Abstaining from SCP-182's presence thus far seems to be the most reliable solution. Testing is difficult, as it is currently not understood how SCP-182's abilities work.

**Addendum 182-6:** SCP-182 stated that "what [[[SCP-058]]] says makes perfect sense to me, and I'm surprised that you smart guys don't get it." Subsequently, it was finally decided that any staff with any sort of knowledge involving classified or Keter class SCPs are to be isolated from SCP-182. Someone as obviously unstable as SCP-182 having this knowledge yields dangerous and unpredictable results.

**Addendum 182-7:** [[[SCP-781]]] has made numerous pleas to meet SCP-182. Due to SCP-781's refusal to state the reason for this desire, all requests have been denied. When SCP-182 was asked if he knew anything about the matter, Saint denied knowledge of the situation and refused further comments.
