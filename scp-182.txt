**Item #:** SCP-182

**Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** In accordance with Special Security Measures Order Coultier-A, SCP-182 has been moved from stationary site 19 and has been relocated to a small, automatically controlled ship, coursing a route throughout the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. This precise route is to be made clear only to one O-5. Every month, the current knowledgable O-5 must inform the next along the line, and then have his memories wiped of the route. This particular measure of security serves to protect SCP-182 itself as well as the integrity of the Foundation, as it is currently unclear how much information SCP-182 pertaining to the Foundation SCP-182 has absorbed. 

The precise route of the ship must not come within 81 miles (131 km) of any coast-situated town or city. It has been previously determined that this is the true extent to which SCP-182 can reliably read minds. 

The medical and cooking crew in attendance on the ship are to have their minds wiped of any information not pertaining to Saint that would require a higher clearance than Level 1 to be allowed to know. The on-board computer is programmed to stop at the closest designated fuel and rescources area when either one comes close to running out. 

In accordance with his wishes, SCP-182 is kept under heavy sedation for most of the day. 


**Description:** SCP-182 is a Caucasian male, of average build, nearing his mid-forties. SCP-182 has suffered heavy abdominal and cranial scarring at an unspecified point in the past (by his own admission, shortly before he was admitted into the care of the Foundation in 19██). SCP-182 has repeatedly asked personnel attending to his care to refer to him as “Saint”, which has been disallowed, as SCP-182 is highly emotionally unstable and will react badly to a percieved “friend” denying him a request in accordance with security measures. 

SCP-182 has the self-described ability to “hear other peoples’ thoughts”. SCP-182 has not been shown to be able to control or repress this ability, although during tests it was shown to be stopped by the Telekill alloy. The constant reception of erratic, sometimes only half-formed thoughts, which SCP-182 appears to “hear” in common English, have been a large contributor in his mental and emotional unstability. SCP-182 has, after serious interrogation, admitted that he can hear one person’s thoughts reliably and clearly when focusing on their face (although this does not work with a photograph or video recording, even if the person is well within “hearing” range). 

SCP-182 can pick up “chatter” anywhere within a 131 kilometer radius of himself. 

He is also able to “broadcast” his thoughts into a recipient’s head, which has been described as a “profoundly unpleasant experience” by test subjects. Doing this usually immediatley leads to hostility from the recipient against SCP-182, which culiminated in the accident described in Addendum 3. 

SCP-182 occasionally suffers extreme moodswings, often manifesting as extreme anger,  phsysical violence and uncontrollable sobbing (not necessarily all at once). Attending medical personnel have reported an “annoying, throbbing ache” in the back of their heads when this occurs – therefore, they are to leave SCP-182’s cabin when this occurs. 

**Addendum 182-1:**According to SCP-182, he did not always possess the ability to read thoughts, and claims it was caused by the same accident that caused his extensive scarring. 

**Addendum 182-2:** It has been suggested that SCP-182 be used as a “translator” with other SCPs who appear capable of thought, but not of communication. O5-█ permission is pending. 

**Addendum 182-3:** [DATA EXPUNGED]
