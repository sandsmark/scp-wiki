**Item #:** SCP-182

**Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-182 is to be kept in a small environmentally-sealed structure on an otherwise-uninhabited island situated 10km off the coast of Greenland. A team of five (5) guards are to be assigned to guard the subject at all times. Guards are to be examined for psychological damage once per month, guards who show any signs of damage are to be recalled from their post and are required to undertake a full course of psychiatric therapy prior to returning to duty. No single individual is to spend more than six (6) months at a stretch on 182 guard duty, and are required to spend a minimum of three (3) months on a different assignment before returning. Personnel are entitled to refuse this assignment if they have already spent a total of eight (8) months or more on the island. SCP-182 has requested that he be kept under heavy sedation for 20 hours per day. Following Incident 182-7, this privilege has been revoked.

**Description:** SCP-182 is a Caucasian male, of average build, nearing his mid-forties. SCP-182 has suffered heavy abdominal and cranial scarring at an unspecified point in the past (by his own admission, shortly before he was admitted into the care of the Foundation in 19██). SCP-182 is both deaf and mute, compensating for these disabilities with his natural abilities.

SCP-182 has displayed the ability to passively enter the minds of other beings, both human and animal, and to perceive sight and sound through their senses, in effect 'riding' as a passenger in their minds. This has no consistent effect on personnel, and some guards have rotated on and off on a regular basis for the past ██ years without detrimental effects. However, prolonged exposure to SCP-182's passive 'sensory borrowing' results in vivid visual and auditory hallucinations in 9█% of humans and 100% of nonhuman test subjects. The effects in question vary widely in severity, but continued exposure after the onset will inevitably result in mental collapse. Termination of the affected personnel is recommended if they cannot distinguish between the hallucinations and reality, as all subjects allowed to reach such a point have invariably broken down, with brain death or permanent catatonia being the only possible outcomes. SCP-182 cannot control this ability with any appreciable degree of skill, and automatically sees and hears the perceptions of any living animals within ten (10) meters. He can 'focus' on specific directions outside of that range, but cannot 'ride' the senses of beings further away from him than thirty (30) meters.

SCP-182 additionally manifests the ability to project his thoughts into the mind of any individual whose senses he 'rides.' This mental 'speech' is the only known source of information about the subject, and has been described by guards as akin to being spoken to by a small human between their ears. SCP-182 exhibits no memetic or telepathic hazard stemming from this 'speech,' though subjects report that his 'voice' is always a component in their hallucinations.

SCP-182 occasionally suffers extreme moodswings, often manifesting as extreme anger,  phsysical violence and uncontrollable sobbing (not necessarily all at once). Attending medical personnel have reported an “annoying, throbbing ache” in the back of their heads when this occurs – therefore, they are to leave SCP-182’s cabin when this occurs. 

**Addendum 182-1:** SCP-182 claims that the incident that scarred him and robbed him of his ability to hear and speak also resulted in the manifestation of his abilities. It is not presently clear whether this was a deliberate goal of the 'torture' he says was inflicted on him or whether SCP-182 suppressed his powers until his life was in danger and only accessed them once he was in imminent danger of death.

**Addendum 182-2:** It has been suggested that SCP-182 be used as a “translator” with other SCPs who appear capable of thought, but not of communication. Given the side-effects of proximity to SCP-182, this request has been denied.

**Incident Report 182-7**
>**Audio report filed by Agent █████ on ██/█/19██**
>"Yeah... So, we got the letter this morning from O5 saying the sedation was approved. Dr. ███████ went out to tell one-eighty-three, guy seemed pretty happy, clappin' his hands and everything. Like a little kid. Shot him up, he was out like a light. Slept a few hours, then Dr. ███████ went in to check on him, make sure he was still breathing. Don't want a casualty, yeah? Anyway, I'm in the other house, we'd got up a good game of twenty-one, when I hear Doc screamin' his lungs out. Something about spiders, or...wha?"
>
>(Following this the tape records seven gunshots, audio analysis indicates they were fired at a point above and to the left of the microphone.)
>
>"God damn it... We thought Doc had finally cracked, he'd been seeing little things out of the corner of his eye for a few days, we figured one-eighty-two had got to him. We drew straws to see who'd have to go get his body, [Agent J████████ ██████] drew the short straw. Guy was fresh out here, just been assigned last week. Dammit, I should have gone instead. J███'s screams started a few minutes later. Everyone got up at this point, we started walkin' out there, snow everywhere, should've transferred out of here befo- agh!"
>
>(Another eight gunshots are heard, followed by repeated clicking. Subsequent sounds determined to be the replacement of an empty clip.)
>
>"Ugh... These things... We got to the house where one-eighty-two was, he was lying on the bed, looked dead to the world. Thirty, maybe thirty-five feet away J███ and Doc were sitting on the floor, drooling. Well, Doc was. J███ was dead. Blood oozing out of his mouth, looked like he bit his own tongue off. All three of us knew what'd happened. I started to see... //things.// I ran, I don't know about the other guys. I'm holed up in the building, gonna wait for the boat to arrive. Hope I can hold off long enough..."
>
>(Audio recording continued for seventeen minutes, intermittent screams and gunshots can be heard, as well as a door opening twice.)
>
>"I've seen what happens to those guys that go too far. I'm not ending up like that. I'm not going to see those things. Bye."
>
>(A gunshot is heard, tape records two hours of silence. The bodies of Agents █████ and ████ were found inside the door, shot by Agent █████. Agent █████ was found next to the recorder, a bullet lodged in his skull.)
