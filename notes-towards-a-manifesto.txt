> WE ASK THE QUESTION HERE
> **1. deviating from or inconsistent with the common order, form, or rule; irregular;  abnormal:**
> 
> SMASH the confines of reality. Purge art of modernism, commercialism, post-modernism, galleryism, pre-modernism, manifestoism, consumerism, ismism. Art dies by inches, confined in glass & steel & paint. Release it into the world. Art is life & life is art. Create art reality.
> **2. not fitting into a common or familiar type, classification, or pattern; unusual 3. incongruous or inconsistent.**
> 
> REMAKE the tools of expression. An expression made is an expression made unoriginal. Art is not regurgitation. Reduce, reuse, recontextualize, redact, demake, unmake, destroy. Never think of the same river twice.
> **#. not organized or planned in a conventional way 27. encouraged to function or evolve without advance planning; spontaneous.**
> 
> UTILIZE the canvas! Expose the people to art-based reality. Art is for the people & people are for art. Mourn the loss as a cochineal or spent paint.
> **}. of, pertaining to, or characteristic of surrealism;  surrealistic. ?. having the disorienting, hallucinatory quality of a dream; unreal; fantastic:**
> 
> SUBVERT the aims of the collectors and aficionados! Curators to academics to directors, seek to explain & cage art & expression. Do not avoid or purge. Make art from their actions.
> **-8. any member of a class of words that modify nouns and pronouns, primarily by describing a particular quality of the word they are modifying.**
> 
> For thousands of years, Art furtively asked the questions of the age. What is Life? what is Art? what is god? Now we pile upon the altar of art and ask our own question. Life is fleeting, Art is everything and nothing, and god is away. We seek a far greater question, found in the clubs you don't know. The bands never heard. Find it all, but don't show it. Show it off, but  not too obvious, make it public, but limited. It defines this modern world, from computers to walking. To even ask is to fail, to reflect is heresy.

> Are we cool yet?

Gaffney shut his eyes and squeezed the bridge of his nose. 
"What the fuck did I just read, Braun?" he asked, leaning back in his chair. Braun swallowed. 
"Well, sir," he answered, "we think it's some kind of manifesto from the kids who did the Ossify thing. It's just..."
"Just what?"
"It's just that we've recovered nearly a dozen of these, and no two are the same. Not just in the style or wording, either. They all seem to advocate contradictory positions."
"Any consistencies?"
"Well, every piece seems to call for the use of anomalous objects to create quote, 'art reality.' We think. Some of it's pretty, uh... pretty abstract."
"Fan-fucking-tastic."
"There's something else, sir... Several of the documents suggest a knowledge of the existence of the Foundation, as well as several other groups of interest. There's even something that a few of the analysts think might be a reference to currently contained objects."
"So, there's a bunch idiot kids making 'statements' about man's inhumanity to man or whatever that we have to clean up and contain. We don't know how many there are, what they stand for, or where they operate from. And they know about us somehow."
"Basically, sir, yes."
"Christ, even with the Church or the IRG, we at least know where they stand. Alright, Braun, you can leave."
As the door clicked shut, Gaffney picked up the sheet of paper on his desk and began to read again.
