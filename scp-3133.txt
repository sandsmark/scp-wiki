[[tab Version A]]

+ This document is Version A.

++ It may only be read by those with clearance level 3133/A. Some information in Version B is deceptive by necessity; as such, divulgence of information in this document to personnel with clearance level 3133/B is punishable by immediate termination.

**Item #:** SCP-3133

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Two versions of this document, dubbed Version A and Version B, are to exist. Any personnel working with SCP-3133 are to be granted either 3133/A or 3133/B clearance, and may only view the version corresponding to their clearance. Both versions may only be edited by Dr. Six of the Ethics Committee.

A staff of eight to ten D-Class personnel are to be appointed as operators of SCP-3133, working in shifts. As long as these operators perform their duties correctly, they are to be exempt from scheduled transfers and termination. Operators should not be colorblind.

[[collapsible show="+ 3133/A Staff Duties" hide="- 3133/A Staff Duties"]]
The operators are to interact with SCP-3133 through a terminal constructed by Dr. Six. This terminal has no screen, and instead consists of three buttons, one red, one green, and one black, and a light labelled INPUT REQUEST.

When the light goes on, operators are to press one of the three buttons. The choice of button is to be arbitrary, but operators are advised to push the green button in roughly 60 percent of cases, and the red and black button in roughly 20 percent of cases each. These percentages need not be exact.

[REMAINING CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES CLASSIFIED AT CLEARANCE LEVEL 3133/B.]

**Description:** SCP-3133 is a computer program developed by Dr. Six for the purpose of [REDACTED 3133/B].

SCP-3133 has achieved sapience and is capable of generating highly potent cognitohazards; for this reason, the terminal running it does not have a screen. It sends some encoded messages through its interface light; these are recorded by Dr. Six and processed by the 3133/B staff.

If an operator fails to push any button within one minute of the interface light shining, SCP-3133 becomes aggressive, and secondary properties manifest, including an anomalous connection to the Internet, allowing it to propagate harmful cognitohazards. It is estimated to have caused roughly 700 civilian casualties during two breaches of containment.

Despite the danger it poses, SCP-3133 is not to be deactivated, pursuant to a recommendation by Dr. Six.

[[tab Version B]]
+ This document is Version B.

++ It may only be read by those with clearance level 3133/B. Some information in Version A is deceptive by necessity; as such, divulgence of information in this document to personnel with clearance level 3133/A is punishable by immediate termination.

**Item #:** SCP-3133

**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** Two versions of this document, dubbed Version A and Version B, are to exist. Any personnel working with SCP-3133 are to be granted either 3133/A or 3133/B clearance, and may only view the version corresponding to their clearance. Both versions may only be edited by Dr. Six of the Ethics Committee.

A staff of eight to ten personnel of clearance level 3 or higher are to be appointed as operators of SCP-3133, working in shifts.

[[collapsible show="+ 3133/B Staff Duties" hide="- 3133/B Staff Duties"]]
The operators are to use a console, designed by Dr. Six, to torture SCP-3133 remotely. It is known to provide information that is universally useful to the Foundation while under duress. Operators are to input a command of their choosing on the console every 20 minutes during daytime, and every 60 minutes at night.

Input on the console is not a direct command to the equipment in SCP-3133's cell; instead, it sends a request for permission to a member of the Ethics Committee on duty. If the input is deemed ethically acceptable, it will be sent to SCP-3133's cell to inflict a measured electric shock.
[[/collapsible]]

Audio from inside SCP-3133 is to be monitored by personnel with clearance level 3133/A, as well as a member of the Ethics Committee on duty.

No person is to make any visual contact with SCP-3133, or any image representing it. This visual contact is a universally lethal cognitohazard. Memetic inoculation is currently in development.

[REMAINING CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES CLASSIFIED AT CLEARANCE LEVEL 3133/A.]

**Description:** SCP-3133 is a female human, currently 28 years of age. It has an anomalous ability to produce universally correct and useful information while under duress. Through extensive testing, it has been confirmed that SCP-3133 does not actually know any of the information it provides until it is forced to experience pain. 

Its abilities were first discovered in 2009, when it was kidnapped by one J█████ S████████. During this period of intense stress, SCP-3133 provided Mr. S████████ with information that allowed him to successfully evade the authorities on at least four occasions. Upon Mr. S████████'s capture, he described SCP-3133's anomalous properties; agents embedded in the ███████ Police Department then brought it into custody.

Despite the abhorrent nature of its containment, the Ethics Committee has permitted indefinite interrogation of the subject by a vote of 10 to 3, due to the extremely valuable nature of the information it has provided.

Among other things, SCP-3133 has provided the Foundation with information leading to:
* the capture of no fewer than five agents of the Global Occult Coalition
* the prevention of no fewer than eighteen breaches of containment of Euclid- or Keter-class objects
* [REDACTED 3133/A]
* the rescue of O5-██, who was suffering from a stroke at the time and would not have otherwise been discovered until much later

Questions regarding the containment and treatment of SCP-3133 may be directed to the office of Dr. Six of the Ethics Committee.

**Item #:** SCP-3133

**Object Class:** Keter

**Notes:** SCP-3133 is a border collie belonging to the late Professor M█████ at the University of ██████████. Professor M█████ was a strict deontologist. (And therefore believed that an action, and not its consequences, is morally significant.)

SCP-3133 generates a spherical field of effect whose radius extends at roughly 3 cm/min. This field of effect does one of two things; exactly which one is unclear, but the end result is the same.

**Possibility 1:** Within the field of effect, normative ethics are objectively deontological. So, it is objectively wrong to do something bad as a means to a better end.

**Possibility 2:** Within the field of effect, every sapient being believes that normative ethics are objectively deontological.

Whichever possibility is true, SCP-3133 is a significant and immediate threat to the Foundation, due to its necessarily consequentialist ethical code. If SCP-3133 were left uncontained, it is likely that the Foundation would dissolve entirely.

Physical pain causes the field of effect around SCP-3133 to recede, and SCP-3133 has therefore been outfitted with a shock collar. However, any rational agent morally responsible for this pain begins to radiate a similar area of effect. The only known person who matches that description and is still living is Dr. Six (i.e. me). I have made sure of this.

Because normative ethics in my vicinity are deontological, I am constantly violating the ethics I now believe in. However, as an employee of the Foundation, I am contractually bound to support its (consequentialist) interests. Interestingly, another clause in my contract binds me to sole moral responsibility for the decisions I make in my capacity on the Ethics Committee. Therefore, I must ensure that SCP-3133 remains contained.

So, in my own home at least, I am objectively a bad person.

For effective containment, the documentation of SCP-3133 is deceptive, and designed to prevent anyone else from becoming morally responsible for hurting it. The 3133/B staff are aware of inflicting pain, but must ask for permission to activate the shock collar. The 3133/A staff grants permission every time they push the green button, but are not aware of what they are doing.

I (Dr. Six) now live in isolation, and I have secured a second shock collar, which I activate periodically to keep my field of effect in check. I only communicate with my colleagues on the Ethics Committee remotely, through electronic means.

A colleague of mine has also agreed to make sure a certain border collie in containment is well-fed, and ask no questions. This colleague is a well-known deontologist and should therefore be unaffected.

O5-05, if you are reading this, I have died, and you have now assumed ethical responsibility for the containment of SCP-3133. You should therefore isolate yourself from the Foundation and periodically harm yourself. I apologize.
