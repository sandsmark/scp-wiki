[[tab Version A]]

+ This document I create L­olita Slave Toys. In case you are wondering what I meanl it is very simple: I transform young girls in easy, manageable sex toys. That's it. The girls can not walk away, can not resist, can not tell anything; they are just there for your sadistic amusement. Curious how? I am a surgeon living in one of those countries at the eastern outskirts of Europe. A pretty rough society still, poverty is enormous and unless you have money and connections, you are fuc­ked. Needless to say I have both. We also have beautiful girls here, eastern European countries are well known for that. Fortunately (for me) some of these girls don't have parents or relatives anymore and live in orphanages. Actually, I would not call that living as it is unbelievable what you will fidn there. Some very young girls are lucky and get adopted, but at an age of 8 or 9 they are too old. Some of the more pretty girls get sold into prostitution and you could consider it luck for them too; instead of slowly fading away in filth and poverty. And a few girls I buy. I generally pick the attractive girls around 9 or 10 years, before puberty starts. The orphanage is very cooperative. They are glad they have one less mouth to feed, one new place to fill. They also gladly accept my donations for the girls. They never ask and I never tell. They know I am a surgeon; they probably think I do some experiments with the girils or cut out and sell their organs. But no, I found a much more profitable business; I turn the girls into sex toys. You can order a Lol­ita Slave Toy if you want. They are not cheap; I charge $30,000 to $40,000 for a toy. This is without shipping costs. But: You will have a Lol­ita Slave Sex Toy that will give you satisfaction for many years, she is like a doll, but she is a living doll! Let me tell you how I turn a young orphan girl into a living doll. When I have found a new, suitable girl, I will ask the orphanage to deliver her at my villa. She will arive naked, tied and blindfolded. After a bried inspection and a quick medical check, I will take her to my special clinic in my villa. First, I will clean her very thoroughly. These girls really smell and are filthy; they have not seen a bath for ages and they are really neglected. When she is finally clean, I put her in a hospital bed and give her an injection that will put her to sleep. I will create her a new identity and give her a new name, as I don't know the girl's real names, I just know their age, and that's all I need. At the orphanage, any data they have from her will be destroyed. She never existed. She will from now on only exist as a toy. I have a couple Lol­ita Slave Toys myself; Dasha, who is 11 years old and is just in the final stage of her transformation, Tanya, who is now 12 years old; two years since I created her and Luda, who is 14 years old and 4 months pregnant. The next morning is the big operation day. The girl will be still sleeping because of the anesthetic from last night. I put her on the operation table and administer anesthetics for the operation to come. So if you were wondering why my Slave Toy will not resist or walk away, very simple: I amputate her legs and arms! I will amputate her arms above her albows and her legs right above her knees. Easy isn't it? This girl will never run away from you... For the girl this is a very heavy operation and it is probably the most critical step in the transformation process. But most of the times they survive. Now I am not just leaving the girls with stumps on their arms and legs. I will attach a 5 cm metal bar very tightly to the bone on her arms and legs before stitching up the wounds. The other end of the metal bar has a screw-thread, where I can attach an o-ring. When she is ready you easily secure her with a chain or padlock to any object you like! My Tanya and Luda normally have a chain behind her back attached to both o-rings on the stumps of her arms. It will keep here arms nicely close to her body. In the beginning, you have to really take care of the wounds on the stumps to prevent infections. Once the wound is healed completely, I will place a silicone cover over the stump. The outside of the cover is covered with white velvet and this actually looks quite sweet, despite the rather cruel o-rings at the end of what is left of her arms and legs. After a few months, when the legs and arms have fully recovered, you can put some more stain on the o-rings. I started a year ago to hang Tanya and Luda on their arms from the ceiling. It is such an interesting form of decoration in your room to have a naked Lol­ita hanging from your ceiling! And it is very nice to use her cu­nt or mouth when she is hanging like that. But before that we have a long way to go. The operation is not ready yet with amputating her arms and legs. Next I will also cut her vocal cords so she can no longer speak or even make noises, and remove her teeth from her mouth. When I have removed all her teeth, I implant a silicone layer with a soft top layer on her jaws. She will still be able to give bl­ow ­jobs, but she can no longer bite on your di­ck. It is actually quite nice how when she more or less chews a little bit on your co­ck; the soft top layer gives you a kind of massage. The silicone implant is, however, absolutely necessary; if not, her mouth would look like a toothless granny. This will keep her good looks. To further keep her mouth in good shape, she will wear a ball gag most of the time. That does sound somewhat obsolete because I cut her vocal cords and she cannot speak anyway, but this is just because of the esthetics. A gagged girl simply looks good and, besides feeding, drinking, and fuc­king, she does not need her mouth anymore. Once the operation is complete, I will give the girl one or two weeks to recover and let the wounds heal. Then her training begins.is Version A.

**Item #:** SCP-3133

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Two versions of this document, dubbed Version A and Version B, are to exist. Any personnel working with SCP-3133 are to be granted either 3133/A or 3133/B clearance, and may only view the version corresponding to their clearance. Both versions may only be edited by Dr. Six of the Ethics Committee.

A staff of eight to ten D-Class personnel are to be appointed as operators of SCP-3133, working in shifts. As long as these operators perform their duties correctly, they are to be exempt from scheduled transfers and termination. Operators should not be colorblind.

[[collapsible show="+ 3133/A Staff Duties" hide="- 3133/A Staff Duties"]]
The operators are to interact with SCP-3133 through a terminal constructed by Dr. Six. This terminal has no screen, and instead consists of three buttons, one red, one green, and one black, and a light labelled INPUT REQUEST.

When the light goes on, operators are to press one of the three buttons. The choice of button is to be arbitrary, but operators are advised to push the green button in roughly 60 percent of cases, and the red and black button in roughly 20 percent of cases each. These percentages need not be exact.

[REMAINING CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES CLASSIFIED AT CLEARANCE LEVEL 3133/B.]

**Description:** SCP-3133 is a computer program developed by Dr. Six for the purpose of [REDACTED 3133/B].

SCP-3133 has achieved sapience and is capable of generating highly potent cognitohazards; for this reason, the terminal running it does not have a screen. It sends some encoded messages through its interface light; these are recorded by Dr. Six and processed by the 3133/B staff.

If an operator fails to push any button within one minute of the interface light shining, SCP-3133 becomes aggressive, and secondary properties manifest, including an anomalous connection to the Internet, allowing it to propagate harmful cognitohazards. It is estimated to have caused roughly 700 civilian casualties during two breaches of containment.

Despite the danger it poses, SCP-3133 is not to be deactivated, pursuant to a recommendation by Dr. Six.

[[tab Version B]]
+ This document is Version B.

++ It may only be read by those with clearance level 3133/B. Some information in Version A is deceptive by necessity; as such, divulgence of information in this document to personnel with clearance level 3133/A is punishable by immediate termination.

**Item #:** SCP-3133

**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** Two versions of this document, dubbed Version A and Version B, are to exist. Any personnel working with SCP-3133 are to be granted either 3133/A or 3133/B clearance, and may only view the version corresponding to their clearance. Both versions may only be edited by Dr. Six of the Ethics Committee.

A staff of eight to ten personnel of clearance level 3 or higher are to be appointed as operators of SCP-3133, working in shifts.

[[collapsible show="+ 3133/B Staff Duties" hide="- 3133/B Staff Duties"]]
The operators are to use a console, designed by Dr. Six, to torture SCP-3133 remotely. It is known to provide information that is universally useful to the Foundation while under duress. Operators are to input a command of their choosing on the console every 20 minutes during daytime, and every 60 minutes at night.

Input on the console is not a direct command to the equipment in SCP-3133's cell; instead, it sends a request for permission to a member of the Ethics Committee on duty. If the input is deemed ethically acceptable, it will be sent to SCP-3133's cell to inflict a measured electric shock.
[[/collapsible]]

Audio from inside SCP-3133 is to be monitored by personnel with clearance level 3133/A, as well as a member of the Ethics Committee on duty.

No person is to make any visual contact with SCP-3133, or any image representing it. This visual contact is a universally lethal cognitohazard. Memetic inoculation is currently in development.

[REMAINING CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES CLASSIFIED AT CLEARANCE LEVEL 3133/A.]

**Description:** SCP-3133 is a female human, currently 28 years of age. It has an anomalous ability to produce universally correct and useful information while under duress. Through extensive testing, it has been confirmed that SCP-3133 does not actually know any of the information it provides until it is forced to experience pain. 

Its abilities were first discovered in 2009, when it was kidnapped by one J█████ S████████. During this period of intense stress, SCP-3133 provided Mr. S████████ with information that allowed him to successfully evade the authorities on at least four occasions. Upon Mr. S████████'s capture, he described SCP-3133's anomalous properties; agents embedded in the ███████ Police Department then brought it into custody.

Despite the abhorrent nature of its containment, the Ethics Committee has permitted indefinite interrogation of the subject by a vote of 10 to 3, due to the extremely valuable nature of the information it has provided.

Among other things, SCP-3133 has provided the Foundation with information leading to:
* the capture of no fewer than five agents of the Global Occult Coalition
* the prevention of no fewer than eighteen breaches of containment of Euclid- or Keter-class objects
* [REDACTED 3133/A]
* the rescue of O5-██, who was suffering from a stroke at the time and would not have otherwise been discovered until much later

Questions regarding the containment and treatment of SCP-3133 may be directed to the office of Dr. Six of the Ethics Committee.

**Item #:** SCP-3133

**Object Class:** Keter

**Notes:** SCP-3133 is a border collie belonging to the late Professor M█████ at the University of ██████████. Professor M█████ was a strict deontologist. (And therefore believed that an action, and not its consequences, is morally significant.)

SCP-3133 generates a spherical field of effect whose radius extends at roughly 3 cm/min. This field of effect does one of two things; exactly which one is unclear, but the end result is the same.

**Possibility 1:** Within the field of effect, normative ethics are objectively deontological. So, it is objectively wrong to do something bad as a means to a better end.

**Possibility 2:** Within the field of effect, every sapient being believes that normative ethics are objectively deontological.

Whichever possibility is true, SCP-3133 is a significant and immediate threat to the Foundation, due to its necessarily consequentialist ethical code. If SCP-3133 were left uncontained, it is likely that the Foundation would dissolve entirely.

Physical pain causes the field of effect around SCP-3133 to recede, and SCP-3133 has therefore been outfitted with a shock collar. However, any rational agent morally responsible for this pain begins to radiate a similar area of effect. The only known person who matches that description and is still living is Dr. Six (i.e. me). I have made sure of this.

Because normative ethics in my vicinity are deontological, I am constantly violating the ethics I now believe in. However, as an employee of the Foundation, I am contractually bound to support its (consequentialist) interests. Interestingly, another clause in my contract binds me to sole moral responsibility for the decisions I make in my capacity on the Ethics Committee. Therefore, I must ensure that SCP-3133 remains contained.

So, in my own home at least, I am objectively a bad person.

For effective containment, the documentation of SCP-3133 is deceptive, and designed to prevent anyone else from becoming morally responsible for hurting it. The 3133/B staff are aware of inflicting pain, but must ask for permission to activate the shock collar. The 3133/A staff grants permission every time they push the green button, but are not aware of what they are doing.

I (Dr. Six) now live in isolation, and I have secured a second shock collar, which I activate periodically to keep my field of effect in check. I only communicate with my colleagues on the Ethics Committee remotely, through electronic means.

A colleague of mine has also agreed to make sure a certain border collie in containment is well-fed, and ask no questions. This colleague is a well-known deontologist and should therefore be unaffected.

O5-05, if you are reading this, I have died, and you have now assumed ethical responsibility for the containment of SCP-3133. You should therefore isolate yourself from the Foundation and periodically harm yourself. I apologize.
