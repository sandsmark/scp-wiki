**Item #:** SCP-4445

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Dr. Clef is to fuck around with the staff of TVTropes.Org by fucking around with this article every time they try to edit it to match and synchronize the two things. 

**Description:** Seriously, guys, it's not necessary. The old TVTropes article was better and you should keep it that way. The new one's not so great, imo. These two articles don't need to be synchronized if you ask me. They're fine being two variations of the same number. Besides, they're joke SCPs.

**Addendum:** Feel free to revert this, I'm just messing around with you guys.
