//Mankind must not go back to hiding in fear. No one else will protect us, we must stand up for ourselves. While the rest of mankind dwell in the light, we must stand in the darkness to combat it, contain it, and shield it from the eyes of the public, so that others may live in a sane, normal world.
We secure. We contain. We protect.//
â€” "The Administrator", About the SCP Organization

**Item #:** SCP-4445

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Security of this data has been compromised, rendering further secrecy counter-productive. In accordance with Information Security Protocol 008-C-1 ("Class C breach") and the recommendation of General Bowe, our current orders are to allow all but the most sensitive data to remain freely available. The nature of these data insures that few will question the official cover story: that these data are short works of fiction originating from the image board "4chan" and uploaded to a publicly edited website (i.e. a "wiki"): here.

**Description:** SCP-4445 is the incomplete archives of the SCP Foundation, a secret, global organization which exists to study, catalog, and contain SCP Objects: artifacts and "items which jeopardize normalcy". These range from humans with strange powers, to creatures of extraterrestrial or extradimensional origin, to objects causing unexplainable phenomena, to [DATA EXPUNGED]. Many of them represent clear threats to human society, human sanity, human lives, or the entire universe.

Of course, the nature of SCP Objects means that those who contain and study them must possess certain qualities: keen intelligence, a clinical outlook, and complete ruthlessness. The stakes are far too high to allow concerns like morality or the loss of human lives to interfere...
