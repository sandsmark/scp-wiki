**Experiment Log:** A summarized version of the experiment log for [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1258 SCP-1258] is given below; a full log can be found in the document cabinet in Site-19.

**Procedure:** In order to minimize exposure to and potential outbreaks of SCP-1258, a Foundation agent with experience in multiple forms of martial arts was given access to all materials related to SCP-1258. The agent practiced multiple forms until performance was satisfactory. The agent was recorded performing all known forms and movements, then given targeted class-B amnestics to remove all knowledge of SCP-1258.[[footnote]]Despite these precautions, the agent was seen using forms similar to SCP-1258 one month later, during a raid on a Church of the Broken God group. Presumably this was due to muscle memory, or perhaps subconscious retention. Agent was eliminated to prevent uncontrolled spread.[[/footnote]] These recordings were then played back to groups of animals of varying species.

**Species:** //Canis lupis familiaris//, domestic dog, varying breeds, thirty-seven specimens (twenty-five males, thirteen females).
**Exposure time:** Ten minutes per hour, eight hours per day. One specimen killed and autopsied at end of each day.
**Results:** All specimens began watching immediately. Twenty-nine specimens attempted to copy movements during first exposure; all individuals copied movements during second exposure. Increased appetite following first day; additional protein and other supplements provided. Further increases needed on following days. Alterations in gross musculature seen following day seven. Alterations in bone structure seen following day twelve. Increased cranial diameter and altered vocal cords seen following day fourteen. Modified I.Q. test was presented on day fourteen; average score was 77.
**Notes:** Experiment was forced to terminate prematurely. On day fifteen, one specimen displayed unexpected agitation and aggression. When handlers entered the containment area to remove the specimen, all specimens attacked simultaneously. Emergency lockdown procedures enacted immediately; all specimens killed via nerve gas. Autopsies were consistent with observed results.

**Species:** //Rattus norvegicus//, laboratory rat, forty-two specimens (twenty-six males, sixteen females). Normal nutritional supplement for a colony of this size was initially tripled.
**Exposure time:** Ten minutes per hour, eight hours per day. One specimen killed and autopsied at end of each day.
**Results:** All specimens began watching immediately. Twenty specimens attempted to copy movements during first exposure; thirteen additional specimens copied movements during second exposure; all specimens copied movements during third exposure. Alterations in gross musculature seen following day ten. Alterations in bone structure seen following day thirteen. Population randomly sorted into two groups following day thirteen; control group received no further exposure, while experiment group continued standard exposure. Control group continued to perform SCP-1258 movements despite lack of exposure. Both groups showed continued physical development, though control group's development was comparatively slower. (More precise data can be found in detailed experiment log.) Modified I.Q. tests presented to both groups on day twenty-two; control group averaged 63, while experiment group averaged 74. By day twenty-seven, experiment group was communicating largely in spoken English and was overheard planning escape from containment.
**Notes:** Experiment was terminated prematurely due to concerns over possible escape.

**Species:** //Myotis californicus//, California bat, seven specimens (six females, one male). Normal nutritional supplement for a group of this size was initially tripled.
**Exposure time:** Ten minutes per hour, eight hours per day. One specimen killed and autopsied at end of each week.
**Results:** All specimens began watching immediately. All specimens attempted to copy movements during first exposure, although movements were noticeably impaired by wing membranes. Major alterations in musculature, skeletal system, and cranial size seen following week one. By day eight, four of the remaining specimens were unable to fly due to diminished wing membranes; by day nine the other two had similarly lost flight capability. Two specimens showed bipedal movement on day ten; by day eleven all specimens were walking bipedally. Specimens began functioning during daylight hours on day twelve. Alterations in eye structure and vocal cords seen following week two. Specimens became fully diurnal on day fifteen. Subjects were conversing in English on day sixteen, though only in ultrasonic frequencies.
**Notes:** Experiment was terminated prematurely. On day nineteen, ultrasonic microphones in the containment area unexpectedly failed. Armed response team was sent in to repair the microphones. They were attacked by the SCP-1258-1 instances and drove them away with flamethrowers and controlled small-arms fire. Three of the team then expired from no apparent cause, and the remaining member became agitated and incoherent. The containment area was flooded with nerve gas, and all specimens were killed. Autopsies of the team members showed massive disruption to their eardrums and hemorrhaging in their brains; it is believed the SCP-1258-1 instances used an ultrasonic attack to induce strokes.

**Species:** //Passer domesticus//, House sparrow, nine specimens (four females, five males). Normal nutritional supplement for a group of this size was initially tripled.
**Exposure time:** Ten minutes per hour, eight hours per day.
**Results:** No changes noted. Specimens showed no particular interest in recordings. After fifteenth day of continual exposure, experiment terminated.

**Species:** //Vombatus ursinus//, Common wombat, nine specimens (four females, five males). Normal nutritional supplement for a group of this size was initially tripled.
**Exposure time:** Ten minutes per hour, eight hours per day.
**Results:** No changes noted. Specimens showed no particular interest in recordings. After fifteenth day of continual exposure, experiment terminated.

**Species:** //Trioceros jacksonii//, Jackson's chameleon, three specimens (two females, one male). Normal nutritional supplement for a group of this size was initially tripled.
**Exposure time:** Ten minutes per hour, eight hours per day.
**Results:** No changes noted. Specimens showed no particular interest in recordings. After fifteenth day of continual exposure, experiment terminated.

**Species:** //Salmo salar//, Atlantic salmon, five specimens (five females). Normal nutritional supplement for a group of this size was initially tripled.
**Exposure time:** Ten minutes per hour, eight hours per day.
**Results:** No changes noted. Specimens showed no particular interest in recordings. After fifteenth day of continual exposure, experiment terminated.

**Species:** //Bombus occidentalis//, Western bumblebee, one colony (exact number unknown). Normal nutritional supplement for a colony of this size was initially tripled.
**Exposure time:** Ten minutes per hour, eight hours per day.
**Results:** No changes noted. Specimens showed no particular interest in recordings. After thirtieth day of continual exposure, experiment terminated.

**Species:** //Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi//, Maasai giraffe, two specimens (two males). Normal nutritional supplement for a group of this size was initially tripled.
**Exposure time:** Ten minutes per hour, eight hours per day.
**Results:** [REDACTED]
**Notes:** Experimentation on large mammals expressly forbidden without special permission from the Site Director.
