**Special Containment Procedures:** All recordings or images of SCP-4286 are to be confiscated. Those who have viewed any media containing SCP-4286 are to be administered Class-B amnestics. Individuals implanted with SCP-4286-1 are to be administered targeted Class-C amnestics and are to visit a Foundation assigned medical professional for monthly examinations.   

Foundation officials within the medical industry, particularly those specializing in osteology and radiology, are to actively suppress information regarding SCP-4286. Attempts to successfully recreate and implant SCP-4286 affected bones are currently ongoing. 

**Description:** SCP-4286 is a phenomenon where individuals have portions of their skeletal system anomalously augmented while sleeping. SCP-4286 appears to exclusively affect individuals suffering from a disorder or disease affecting their skeletal system. The exact method of the phenomenon is unknown, but no pain or discomfort has been reported by affected persons. Due to this, SCP-4286 will normally not be discovered until an intensive medical procedure is performed on the subject.

SCP-4286 causes bones within the human body to resemble various household objects. These bones will seamlessly integrate themselves into the body's skeletal system and will produce blood cells at a rate consistent with standard human bones. SCP-4286 affected individuals have shown a notable resistance to disease, with most individuals being completely cured of their previous skeletal ailment two months after their SCP-4286 occurrence. SCP-4286 affected bones have shown remarkable strength, with instances withstanding considerable amounts of force without damaging. All attempts to surgically implant SCP-4286 affected bones have resulted in rejection from the host body. 

**Addendum:** On 04/23/2021, footage surfaced online of an anomalous entity (designated SCP-4286-1) entering a child's bedroom and performing a series of medical procedures. After its discovery, the footage was removed, and the affected child was located; they were discovered to have previously suffered from //Osteogenesis Imperfecta//.[[footnote]]A genetic disorder that causes bones to become brittle due to a lack of collagen produced by the body.[[/footnote]] Within the child were several SCP-4286 affected bones located in the chest, right arm, and right leg. A video log of the event has been included below in the hope of better understanding the cause of SCP-4286 occurrences.

> 
> 00:00:00 - Footage shows a child’s bedroom, with a bed placed against the far wall near a window. Several toys and other objects are scattered throughout the room. A closed door is present on the wall of the bedroom. A child is visible laying on the bed without blankets.
> 
> 00:02:21 - The door slightly opens, and from it emerges SCP-4286-1, an animate human skeleton wearing a red cardboard party hat. SCP-4286-1 begins slowly walking towards the child in an exaggerated fashion. 
> 
> 00:02:37 - SCP-4286-1 steps on the edge of a red plastic box. The box tops over, spilling a large number of plastic building blocks across the floor. No noise is created by the blocks. SCP-4286-1 flinches and looks at the child, then continues walking in an exaggerated fashion.
> 
> 00:03:14 - SCP-4286-1 reaches the bed and begins to examine the child. It reaches into the child's chest and removes a rib. SCP-4286-1 looks at the rib before shaking its head and inserting the rib back into the child. SCP-4286-1 then pats the child's head before removing its hat.
> 
> 00:03:54 - SCP-4286-1 reaches into the child’s right leg and slowly produces a femur. It then removes its party hat and proceeds to push the femur into the hat. The femur disappears from view.
> 
> 00:04:05 - SCP-4286-1 reaches into the hat, producing a rolling pin. The rolling pin is held up to the child's thigh before SCP-4286-1 shakes its head. The pin is then reinserted into the hat.
> 
> 00:04:23 - SCP-4286-1 produces a claw hammer from the hat before holding it to the child's thigh. SCP-4286-1 nods before inserting the hammer into the child’s thigh. It then reaches into the chest of the child and delicately removes several ribs before placing them within the hat.
> 
> 00:04:41 - SCP-4286-1 reaches into the hat and produces an extended pocket knife, a socket wrench, and a length of black cord. These are then slowly inserted into the child’s chest by SCP-4286-1. SCP-4286-1 reaches in the child's chest several times, adjusting the placement of the objects. 
> 
> 00:05:09 - SCP-4286-1 removes the child’s right humerus and inserts it into the hat. SCP-4286-1 then reaches into the hat, searching for several minutes. During this time, SCP-4286-1 pulls several objects from the hat, such as a golf club, a bag of white liquid, a mannequin head, and a small anvil. SCP-4286-1's movements become more frantic, using both hands to shake the hat in an attempt to remove its contents. 
> 
> 00:08:35 - SCP-4286-1 places both of its hand on its head and begins pacing around the room. It then stops moving before bending down and grabbing several plastic building blocks from the floor. 
> 
> 00:09:04 - SCP-4286-1 attaches the blocks together, forming a large rectangle. It then slowly places this construction within the child’s arm, adjusting its position several times. SCP-4286-1 then reaches into its hat and produces a small bandage stylized with a cartoon heart. This bandage is removed from its packaging and adhered to the child's arm. SCP-4286-1 gathers the items that were removed from its hat before placing the hat on its head. SCP-4286-1 then bends over the child, touching its mouth to the child's forehead in a kissing motion.
> 
> 00:09:09 - SCP-4286-1 quickly glances past the camera and looks around the room. SCP-4286-1 opens the door next to the child's bed. Behind the door is a small closet containing various shirts and plastic bins. SCP-4286-1 quickly enters the closet before closing the door.
> 
> 00:09:17 - Light emanates from out of view as the parents of the child enter the room.
