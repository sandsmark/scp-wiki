[[collapsible show="SCP-2881" hide="The Tree You Cannot Climb"]]
The first day the [[[short-works-contest|]]] was announced, I looked out the window and thought "what could be an SCP, that tree maybe? What can you do with trees? You climb them. What if you couldn’t climb a tree?" and the rest is history. This actually just barely ended up in the top quartile of the contest, but I put that down largely to having been posted within the first hour of the contest. 

This was pretty quick to write, with most of the edits coming in about the ending. The tree in the photo is visible from my window, and that’s about it. Of course, I do want to write something to dive further into what it is/does, but that could subtract from the mystique. For anyone curious, my headcanon is that inside are [[span style="background:#000000; color:#000000;"]]desert cannibals.[[/span]]

[[collapsible show="SCP-2580" hide="Father-Daughter Project"]]
I made this because I had a model rocket, and I wanted to use it in an image. I guess that sort of worked out. The image it got seemed to work out well enough. I like the idea of an anomaly-creator having a kid, and just using their skills in normal situations and I think that that kind of thing is done alright there.

The image was not, in fact, drawn by a child, but was all me. Crossed-out sun was a legitimate mistake on my part, as were the planets on the other side coming in through the scan. Its inclusion was (I think) because I believed in the importance of images to engage a reader in an SCP, which I still believe in. Text is boring, but stock photos are similarly so. If you want to get that lot out, you gotta put that little bit in, if you know what I’m saying. Had I the skill, I probably would have put a map or scatter plot into the next one, but I didn’t.

[[collapsible show="SCP-2446" hide="Mobile Task Force Lambda-5 ("White Rabbits")"]]
This article was technically finished pretty quickly, and then for about two weeks I concentrated just on ironing out any and all kinks. This was the kingpin for my team’s entry into the [[[mobile-task-force-contest |Mobile Task Force Contest]]], so it needed that polish, which I think it got. It doesn’t answer its questions, but that’s a part of the design for the contest.

I don’t believe that the Lambda-5 series is done. Someday, maybe.

[[collapsible show="Every Other Day" hide="SCP-507 Tale"]]
This was made very quickly after a walk. It’s weird, but I haven’t deleted it yet, so, you know. It’s about the banality of anomalousness, and stuff. 507 goes through different worlds, some of which are just weird, but most of which are normal. When it says "his" in some places, that’s because in those universes, those belong to parallel hims, and aren’t just separate points in one universe. That’s what it’s about, you see, but it could maybe have also served as an allegory or something? I dunno. Check it out, if you haven’t, you tell me about it.

[[collapsible show="2525 N Waterworks St" hide="Lambda-5 Tale"]]
Remember what I said about the diligence and time put into 2446? Yeah, this was built out of the corpse of a half-finished tale in the space of a few hours. There seems to be a pattern with that an my tales. The original tale would have started the same way, then ended with a long conversation with the reality-bender which was scrapped, mainly because I didn’t have enough time to polish it. I think it turned out somewhat okay in the end, if pretty quick and unproductive.

A tale about bestiality has won a contest on this site. How about that? [[[an-incredibly-important-announcement |Yes, it won.]]]

Dec. 2017: I completely forgot that’s I released this. I don’t know if it’s gonna stick moving forward. I’ve been thinking about this a long time.
