**Item #:** SCP-4906

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Current Foundation resources are directed towards preventing a recurrence of Event-4906-Юг. Foundation Site-4906, located on Yuzhny Island, Russian Federation, powers a solenoid of magnetic flux density 1.072 tesla to augment the magnetic flux density of SCP-4906-North. Should Event-4906-Юг recur, Mobile Task Force Sigma-58 "Turkey Shooters" shall reverse the polarity of Site-4906's solenoid in order to trigger Event-4906-北. Once Event-4906-北 is complete, MTF Sigma-58 shall return Site-4906 to normal operation.

**Description:** SCP-4906 consists of three parts: SCP-4906-Omicron, an anomalous organism; and SCP-4906-North and SCP-4906-South, a pair of magnetic anomalies. Current understanding is SCP-4906-Omicron keeps the anomalous properties of SCP-4906-North and SCP-4906-South localized to a radius of 50.37m. Prior to containment, SCP-4906-Omicron performs regular migrations between SCP-4906-North and SCP-4906-South. These migrations are designated Event-4906-Юг and Event-4906-北, and are related to the weakening of the magnetic flux density of SCP-4906-North and SCP-4906-South.

SCP-4906-Omicron appears to be a //Megaptera novaeangliae// (humpback whale) specimen, 70158.7 m in length from nose to tail. SCP-4906-Omicron is currently submerged and completely inert. Biopsies of SCP-4906-Omicron has yielded DNA of two species, //Megaptera novaeangliae// (humpback whale) and //Falco amurensis// (Amur falcon).

SCP-4906-North and SCP-4906-South are a pair of geomagnetic anomalies which form a dipole with an estimated magnetic flux density of 2.317 tesla (about 36,000 to 93,000 times the strength of Earth's magnetic field). Through an unknown mechanism, SCP-4906-Omicron has limited the anomalies' effect to a radius of 50.37m. The rapid ionization of seawater from SCP-4906-North and SCP-4906-South's magnetic forces creates severe weather patterns in their respective areas.

SCP-4906-North is located at 74.311, 50.074, at a depth of 47.13 km which is a point in the Barents Sea, and is located 150.00 km away from the shore of Yuzhny Island, Russian Federation.

SCP-4906-South is located at 24.435, 133.191, at a depth of 47.13 km which is a point in the Philippine Sea, and is not located within 250 km of any significant landmass.

**Event-4906-Юг** triggers when storms with wind speed exceeding 131 km/h approach SCP-4906-North. SCP-4906-North's magnetic flux density will drop to 1.246 tesla over a period of 52 minutes. Simultaneously, SCP-4906-Omicron transforms into what appears to be a large specimen of the //Falco// genus (falcon), growing large wings as its fins reshape into legs and claws, and its skin begins to grow metallic, dart-like feathers. The wingspan has been estimated to be in excess of 70km.

After SCP-4906-Omicron transforms, the Barents Sea cavitates at the location of SCP-4906-North, rapidly forming walls of water that are over 100 km in length. SCP-4906-Omicron would then take flight and rise to an orbit of 3000 km from sea level. It then follows the orthodromic path to the location of SCP-4906-South. SCP-4906-Omicron sends regular pulses in the Earth's magnetic field while in flight. The meanings of these pulses, if any, are unknown. SCP-4906-Omicron returns to its original form once completely submerged in seawater. The entire process takes about 93 days.

Notably, Occurrences of Event-4906-Юг are tied to significant Foundation losses within the Soviet Union. There is currently insufficient evidence on causality between the events and the losses. [[footnote]]Level 3 Researcher Robert Coombs objected to the validity of this relationship, claiming SCP-4906 is a creature the ancient Chinese called //Peng//. See Document-SCP-4906-Addendum.[[/footnote]]

**Event-4906-北** occurs in the same manner Event-4906-Юг, but with the origin being SCP-4906-South and the destination being SCP-4906-North. Occurrences of Event-4906-北 are tied to significant Foundation losses within the United States.

> 
> **Lyushov**: Gentlemen, I understand what you're here for.
> 
> **Takeoka**: Genrikh, please have a seat.
> 
> **Lyushkov**: I can still be of service if you allow me to go to America.
> 
> **Takeoka**: Please leave us, [IJA Soldier], I would like to talk to General Lyushkov personally.
> 
> **[IJA Soldier]**: Yes, sir.
> 
> **Takeoka**: Genrikh, I can get you to America if you answer some questions, but you absolutely must tell the truth.
> 
> **Lyushkov**: I will.
> 
> **Takeoka**: Why did you betray us?
> 
> **Lyushkov**: I never betrayed the Empire! I warned Tsuji...
> 
> **Takeoka**: I'm not talking about Nomonhan[[footnote]]Japanese name for the Battles of Khalkhin Gol[[/footnote]]. Why did you defect from the Foundation?
> 
> **Lyushkov**: //The Foundation?!// You work for //them?!// Where was the Foundation when I was already one foot in the grave?! Stalin was going to... Oh God, are you going to...
> 
> **Takeoka**: That depends on your level of cooperation. My offer to bring you to America is still on the table if you answer my questions. When did you decide to defect, and why that day?
> 
> **Lyushkov**: I... I still remember that feeling from that day. The first of the month. I woke up and just //knew// Stalin will liquidate me next. I tried contacting the Foundation but none of the usual channels were usable.
> 
> **Lyushkov**: I gave up after 12 days. I fled my post. I never told the Japanese anything!
> 
> **Takeoka**: Did you notice anything else?
> 
> **Lyushkov**: Only strange lights. Auroras. They usually didn't show in Karbarovsk, you see.
> 
> **Takeoka**: Thank you.
> 
> (Note: Agent Takeoka terminated Defector Lyushkov after the interview.)

> **Debriefing Log-4906-北-1960**
> **Date:** December 11th, 1960
> **Location:** Vladimir Central Prison
> **Subject:** Level 2 Agent Francis Powers
> **Debriefer:** Level 2 Agent Iosif Vladovich[[footnote]]Cover Position: Lieutenant, Prison Warden[[/footnote]]
> 
> **Vladovich**: I trust everything is well, Mr. Powers?
> 
> **Powers**: As well as it could be in this dump. Have you tried imprisonment? You might like it. What do you want? I thought that trial [Agent Powers makes the "air quotes" gesture] was the end of it.
> 
> **Vladovich**: The Bolsheviks might have had enough of you, but we have more questions.
> 
> **Powers**: And who's we?
> 
> **Vladovich**: The people who you really work for.
> 
> **Powers**: Should I scream for help that there's a CIA agent here?
> 
> **Vladovich**: If you want to get out of here alive and as fast as possible, you will not do that. We can do this tango all day but I will cut to the point. The Foundation wants to know why your plane crashed.
> 
> **Powers**: What Foundation?
> 
> [Agent Vladovich throws Agent Powers a challenge coin.]
> 
> **Powers**: I didn't get your name, Agent...?
> 
> **Vladovich**: Vladovich, Level 2, MTF-Sigma 58. We want to know what happened to your plane.
> 
> **Powers**: I honestly can't tell you. One minute I was flying fine and then my instruments all went haywire. My compass was spinning like a ceiling fan. I lost control shortly afterwards.
> 
> **Vladovich**: Do you remember anything else of significance?
> 
> **Powers**: That the auroras were particularly striking that day.
> 
> (Note: Agent Powers was repatriated in a prisoner exchange to the United States on February 8th, 1961, and resigned from the Foundation shortly after.)

> //In the northern darkness there is a fish and his name is K'un. The K'un is so huge I don't know how many thousand li he measures. He changes and becomes a bird whose name is P'eng. The back of the P'eng measures I don't know how many thousand li across and, when he rises up and flies off, his wings are like clouds all over the sky. When the sea begins to move, this bird sets off for the southern darkness, which is the Lake of Heaven.//
