**Description:** SCP-029 appears to be a pubescent female of  Asiatic-Indian descent. She appears to suffer from alopecia universalis. Over eighty percent of her pigmentation is a true black, while the rest of her skin has a complete lack of melanin, to the point of albinism . Her eyes are also a dark black in color.

Interviews with SCP-029 have proven difficult to conduct, due to SCP-029s constant attempts to kill or convert all who speak with her. Over her years of captivity, the black patches on her skin have increased in size.

They also belived that only sacrifices peformed through strangulation added to this tally. Events led the agent to their mountain fortress, where he discovered SCP-029. After the loss of said Agent, [DATA EXPUNGED]
