**Item #:** SCP-2149

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2149 is to be stored in a small, environmentally self-contained chamber which has been fitted with internal radiation shielding sufficient to contain all naturally-occurring radioisotopes. This chamber will also be equipped with internal Geiger counters and air-quality sensors, as well as audio/video surveillance. 

SCP-2149 is to be securely attached to a hardened steel support frame of sufficient height to allow a similarly hardened portable collection bin of at least two cubic meter capacity to be positioned under the output opening of SCP-2149. No personnel may enter SCP-2149's containment chamber during a production event. After a production event, personnel are to enter the containment chamber and remove all materials produced by SCP-2149. All materials produced are to be sorted by type and disposed of or sanitized and placed in storage, as appropriate.

All standard safety protocols for handling and cleaning radioactive material and waste must be observed by all personnel assigned to SCP-2149. A safety cap has been placed over the hopper opening of SCP-2149 to prevent accidental introduction of materials or body parts into SCP-2149. 

**Description:** SCP-2149 is a Universal Model 1 meat grinder/chopper. A cylinder of unknown material, which is superficially similar to layered sheets of carbon nanotubes, has been fused by unknown means to the body of the grinder and replaced the hand crank. The grinding augur continually rotates and no means to stop or prevent the rotation of SCP-2149's augur has yet been found. The augur has been observed to rotate faster when producing lighter metals and slower when producing heavier metals. During a production event, no material should be placed in the hopper opening. SCP-2149 exhibits low-grade radioactivity due to cumulatively absorbed radiation. 

An attachment for filling sausage casings has been fused over the output portion of SCP-2149. This attachment is composed of the same material as the drive cylinder. Based on wear patterns and radiocarbon dating of surface samples, the item was manufactured in the early 1920s. The modifications have not been accurately dated. The metal components of SCP-2149 are in good condition for their age and show minimal corrosion. 

Daily at 0000 UTC, SCP-2149 will begin a production event. During a production event, metal will begin issuing from the opening of SCP-2149. This metal is 97%-99.99% pure elemental metal. Material introduced to the input hopper during a production event will be integrated into the produced metal, even if the augur could not normally break down the material introduced. This integration is simple combination, rather than alloying, much like grinding two different kinds of meat. Research is ongoing as to the mechanism that allows the iron augur to break down otherwise harder and stronger materials in addition to the mechanism that prevents introduced material from combining with the expelled metal. Metals expressed by the object are produced in a plasma state, though they quickly cool and solidify.[[footnote]]In the case of metals that are not solids at or near room temperature, they will liquefy as normal.[[/footnote]] 

Production events will continue for a number of minutes equal to the atomic weight of the metal being produced. SCP-2149 has been observed to only produce metals which can exist in a stable form. Metalloids, nonmetals, halogens, noble gasses and elements with no stable isotopes have not been recorded as having been produced by SCP-2149 to date. 

No pattern has yet been determined as to which metal SCP-2149 will produce. However, SCP-2149 seems to produce Iron, Copper, Zinc, Gold and Lead at statistically higher rates than other metals.[[footnote]]Iron is produced at a 3.52:1 ratio to all other metals, Copper at 4.23:1, Zinc at 3.78:1, Gold at 1.63:1 and Lead at 6.66:1.[[/footnote]] Due to the radioactivity of the item, all metals produced also exhibit an elevated level of radioactivity.

> **Incident Alpha-2149-29**
> On ██/██/19██ at 1900 local time (0000 UTC), SCP-2149 began a production event. Level 2 Research Assistant █████ Allen was assigned as supervisor to D-11279 and D-2476, who were assigned to collection duty. D-11279 had positioned the collection hopper under the opening of SCP-2149 while D-2476 waited nearby with a portable sprayer filled with water to aid in the cooling of emitted metals. SCP-2149 was known to be radioactive at this time but the level of radioactivity was measured to be within safe exposure levels. Both D-Class personnel were equipped with personal dosimeters and briefed on their use prior to the incident. This was in accordance with containment procedures as written at the time. Timeline of events follows.
> 
> **1900-1906 Local:** D-11279 and D-2476 engage in trivial chatter. Transcript has been omitted for brevity and irrelevance.
> 
> **1907 Local:** SCP-2149 had produced enough material to reach the bottom of the collection bin. D-2476 began spraying the heated material. D-11279 was leaning on the collection bin with his back to D-2476. This was in violation of safety protocols, as neither individual was able to see the other's dosimeter. RA Allen did not call out this violation of protocol.
> 
> **2003 Local:** D-11279 had begun grimacing and rubbing his abdomen, suggesting stomach upset or pain. D-2476 was partially obscured by steam.
> //D-11279:// Ugh, man, startin' to regret that chilimac for lunch.
> //D-2476:// Heh. Y'all'll learn what to stay away from in the chow hall when y'all been here long as I have. [audible belch] Ugh, damn, my lunch ain't sittin' too good, neither. Wonder if they got a batch of bad meat?
> 
> **2016 Local:** D-11279 covered his mouth and clutched at his abdomen. He was visibly pale. D-2476 stopped spraying the metal emerging from SCP-2149 and moved to check on D-11279. He was also visibly pale and sweating. D-2476 tapped D-11279's shoulder.
> //D-2476:// Yo, man, you okay? You--
> D-2476 looked up at the camera, waving his arms. He was clearly in pain.
> //D-2476:// Yo! Hey! Hey, man! Can we get a break in here or somethin'? My boy here looks like he's about to hurl, man! I ain't feelin' too good neither! Come on, man!
> 
> **2019 Local:** D-2476 continued his attempts to gain the attention of RA Allen. His language quickly descended to vicious invective and obscenities. During this time, D-11279 had begun to vomit profusely. He was curled on his side, both arms wrapped around his abdomen. His expression and posture clearly demonstrated severe abdominal pain. D-2476 was bent at the waist, his hands braced on his knees. He appeared to be trying to keep from vomiting.
> //RA Allen:// All personnel must remain within the containment chamber while a production event is active. Please refrain from extraneous activity and perform the tasks assigned to you until the production event has ended.
> D-2476 looked into the camera again. His facial expression appeared to be a mixture of rage and pain. His mouth moved as if speaking or shouting, but remaining audio was missing. Later testimony of RA Allen indicated he shut off the audio feed due to the increasingly hostile tone of D-2476's dialogue.
> 
> **2022-2248 Local:** Remainder of video footage showed both D-11279 and D-2476 succumbing to what is later identified as severe radiation sickness. D-2476 was noted for positioning D-11279 in such a way that he did not aspirate his vomit before finally laying himself in a similar position to wait for the end of the production event. 
> **2258 Local:** Production event ended.
> 
> As a result of this incident, it was discovered that SCP-2149 is able to produce radioactive metals in addition to more mundane metals. During Incident Alpha-2149-29, SCP-2149 produced 1.87 cubic meters of 98.62% pure Uranium-238.
> 
> Subsequent investigation of the incident revealed that RA Allen had not been watching the video monitors nor monitoring the personnel under his supervision. His negligent behaviour resulted in the deaths of both D-Class personnel involved in this incident and the unnecessary exposure of five others to dangerous levels of radiation as well as the irradiation of a large portion of Storage Wing AA23. In light of his actions, RA Allen was treated with Class-A amnestics and dismissed from the Foundation with no identity restoration provided.
> 
> For his efforts in caring for and attempting to aid his fellow D-Class, D-2476, one █████ ███████, was posthumously restored to full citizenship status of the ██████ ██████ and his next of kin provided with a standard survivor's benefit appropriate to a level 1 employee.
