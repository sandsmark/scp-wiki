**Item #:** SCP-488

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-488 is housed in a reinforced bunker at a depth of 50 meters near the military proving ground at [DATA EXPUNGED]. Triple-redundant seismic sensors are in place to record meteorite impacts in the vicinity, and must be tested daily for functionality.

In the case of impact of meteorites above 0.5 m in diameter, the structural integrity of the bunker must be inspected, and SCP-488 moved to the backup bunker 500 m to the south via underground tunnel if repairs are necessary.

**Description:** SCP-488 is a 24-year old Caucasian male of average build, 1.67 m in height and 86 kg in weight with dark hair and brown eyes. He is physiologically normal in all respects, apart from several scars from injuries related to his anomalous property.

SCP-488 has an unexplained ability to 'attract' meteors. Although many of the attracted meteors are small enough to burn up in the atmosphere, a meteor of sufficient mass to impact the Earth's surface will strike within 100 m of his location every 12 hours on average. The size of these meteorites have ranged from 0.5 cm to 1 m in diameter.

SCP-488 has shown no particular ability to resist damage from these impacts, and in fact first came to the Foundation's attention when he was hospitalized on █/██/200█ after a 0.47 m meteorite destroyed his home, killing his wife and son. SCP-488 was voluntarily contained shortly thereafter, and has remained in Foundation custody since. SCP-488 is unsure when this property manifested, other than that it slowly built up.

**Addendum 488-1:** SCP-488 has begun to show signs of severe depression in addition to continued paranoia regarding his condition. Regular psychological testing has been ordered, as well as administration of antidepressants and sedatives.
