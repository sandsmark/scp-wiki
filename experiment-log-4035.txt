All researchers working with [[[SCP-4035|SCP-4035]]] are to consider any possible implications of abilities requested from SCP-4035. Testing is to be focused on understanding the extent of SCP-4035-1’s abilities and its possible secondary effect.

> **Resulting Ability:** Subject's demeanor immediately became more positive and stayed so for the next three days, over which he developed a loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, partial blindness, and eventual internal hemorrhaging which resulted in fatal blood loss. A toxicology report revealed that the subject had been internally contaminated with massive amounts of a [[[SCP-230|compound]]] similar to heroin. During the course of the afflictions, after having perished, and even after the onset of post-mortem primary flaccidity, D-10998 did not once cease smiling.
