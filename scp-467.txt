**Item #:** SCP-467

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-467 is currently located at Site ██, and is guarded by a single security personnel, changed daily. Although SCP-467 has no true mimetic lasting effects, the information it reveals can leave people with lasting effects of their own. While SCP-467 is being studied or moved, all involved personnel must have no cell phones, pagers, or other communication devices on them without clearance for testing.

**Description:** SCP-467 appears to be an empty phone booth, and was found in [[DATA EXPUNGED]] The SCP Foundation discovered it due to a legend about a 'haunted phone' that used to reside inside the booth, although testing has revealed that the phone itself was of no importance, and the effects came from the booth itself. Even after the phone was removed, the booth itself remained a place of superstition before being recovered by [[DATA EXPUNGED]].

Although there is nothing extraordinary about the booth itself, so long as a human and a communication's device are in the booth at the same time, it's effects are easily observed.

Communications devices receive a message from somebody the user knows. This call shows no preference for friends, family, loved ones, co-workers, or even just acquaintances. Curiously enough, later examination of phone records or call logs reveal that this call never happened, even though it may be observed and recorded. The 'caller' has never even picked up the phone, in the process, suggesting SCP-467 has a powerful form of telepathy.

These calls divulge information that the user previously did not know, most commonly- secrets and confessions. These calls range from insignificant to life-changing [See Addendum]. A single user may use the phone booth more than once, provided that at least twenty-four hours have past since their last use. It's suggested that the booth not be used for personal reasons. 

**Addendum:** A collection of some of the more notable results has been collected, and is still being formed.
