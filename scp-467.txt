**Item #:** SCP-467

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-467 is currently located at Site ██, and is guarded by a single security personnel, changed daily. Although SCP-467 has no mimetic lasting effects, the information it reveals can leave people with lasting effects of their own. While SCP-467 is being studied or moved, all involved personnel must have no cell phones, pagers, or other communication devices on them without clearance for testing.

**Description:** SCP-467 appears to be an empty phone booth, and was found in [[DATA EXPUNGED]] The SCP Foundation discovered it due to a legend about a 'haunted phone' that used to reside inside the booth, although testing has revealed that the phone itself was of no importance, and the effects came from the booth itself. Even after the phone was removed, the booth itself remained a place of superstition before being recovered by [[DATA EXPUNGED]].

Although there is nothing extraordinary about the booth itself, any communications devices inside the booth with a human being get a call from somebody in that individual's life. Whether it's a co-worker, acquaintance, friend, or family does not seem to matter and shows no distinct pattern, but they discuss a secret before hanging up. Later checking of cell phone records and logs reveals that this call never occurred on either end of the communications. While the majority of the time this secret is revealed over the phone, text messages and video messages have also been observed.

Secrets have ranged from large, involving adultery or murder, to insignificant, involving stolen pens or cheating at card games.
