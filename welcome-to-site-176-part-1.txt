> **Dr. O'Neal:** To all staff: Remember, your safety is our priority. Well, secondary priority but you get what I mean. Your safety is the reason we keep ripping open the walls and replacing half of the goddamn site. You should not risk entering any active construction zone unless told by an official that it is safe. Let Junior Researcher Maxwell be a lesson to you all. Thank you.

> **Dr. Hunter:** How long are we going to do this?
> 
> **Dr. O'Neal:** Until I feel that I trust my staff enough for them not freak the fuck out.
> 
> **Dr. Hunter:** Freak out? They'll freak out more than you haven't been straight with them!
> 
> **Junior Researcher Adams:** Well, they probably would've freaked out either way...
> 
> **Dr. Hunter:** Shut it, Adams. Look, boss, if we just come clean to them now, we can dodge a bullet later on.
> 
> **Dr. O'Neal:** No, until they've proven to me that they are the professionals they claim to be, no.
> 
> **Junior Researcher Adams:** Uh, boss?
> 
> **Dr. Hunter:** Adams, not now. How could you not be truthful to your own people about something like this? This isn't some "psyche, you thought!" surprise, this is playing with lives!
> 
> **Junior Researcher Adams:** Boss.
> 
> **Dr. O'Neal:** Didn't we tell you to shut up Adams? Hunter, I appreciate you worrying about our staff but now is not the time. What would I tell them anyway? "Oh, by the way, the site has a knack of traveling between two Earth's uncontrollably, and we've been lying to you, we cool right?" Is that it?
> 
> **Junior Researcher Adams:** Boss!
> 
> **Dr. Hunter and Dr. O'Neal:** //**What!?**//
> 
> **Junior Researcher Adams:** The PA system is on.
> 
> **Dr. O'Neal:** ...

> 
> **Dr. O'Neal:** To all staff: It has probably come to your attention that I've not been very truthful to you all as of late. Let me be the first to say it: I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry. I thought I couldn't trust you all, but you've all handled this incredibly well. I should have told you from the start; it's just that not all of us get a good [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-354 first site or area,] it can leave a bad taste in your mouth. Where was I going with this again? Oh yeah, sorry. Thank you.

> **Flores:** Is this on?
> 
> **Dr. O'Neal:** (Sigh) Yes.
> 
> **Flores:** Good. Hello, Site-176. I am Flores, a representative of Site Command and the O5 council.
> 
> **Dr. O'Neal:** God, just get to the point.
> 
> **Flores:** Fine. Site-176 has recently been greenlit for an extension past the containment of only SCP-4097. Due to Site-176' unique attributes and location, Site-176 will, upon refurbishment, house anomalous entities that are either affected by, are constructed to be, or affect objects designed to destroy the property or livelihood of a targeted individual. That is all.

> **Dr. O'Neal:** Wait, what? You can't just //leave// after dropping that bombshell!
> 
> **Flores:** I can, and I am. Goodbye, Ms. O'Neal. [Sound of a door opening and closing.]
> 
> **Dr. O'Neal:** Yeah, fuck you too...
> 
> **Dr. Hunter:** [Sound of a door opening and slamming] What the hell was that?
> 
> **Dr. O'Neal:** It's a little... difficult to explain.
> 
> **Dr. Hunter:** Diff- 
> 
> **Dr. Andrews:** [Sound of a door opening loudly.] O'Neal, holy fuck!
> 
> **Dr. O'Neal:** Christ, Andrews! The door!
> 
> **Dr. Andrews:** Fuck the door! Some chick just rolled up to the PA and told the whole site that we're about to experience the largest site expansion the continent has ever seen! That's a little bit more important than a door!
> 
> **Junior Researcher Adams:** I came as soon as I... Hunter? What are you doing on the floor?
> 
> **Dr. Hunter:** [Inaudiable]... Andrews... Door... Kicked... Why is it always the cock?
> 
> **Junior Researcher Adams:** Uhh, now is probably a good time to tell you that the PA is still on.
> 
> **Dr. O'Neal:** Wha- Oh goddamni-
