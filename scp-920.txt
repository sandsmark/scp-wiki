**Item #:** SCP-920

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Currently containment of SCP-920 has proven to be difficult. Attempts at containing SCP-920 have been suspended due to large financial and personnel costs involved. Suggestions on efficient containment may be submitted to Dr. █████████. --Mobile Task Force Iota-One "Mister Hunters" are currently tracking SCP-920's movements.--

Any personnel encountering Mobile Task Force Iota-One are to contact O5-4.

**Description:** SCP-920 appears to be an Asian male of indeterminable age. Transportation, movement, or direction of SCP-920 to a certain destination is physically impossible. SCP-920 shows an inability to control its own movements and will instead "wander" about, being unable to choose a destination.

Attempts at transporting SCP-920 to any destination will result in transporters becoming lost. Attempts at directing SCP-920 will result in SCP-920 becoming lost. Following SCP-920 will result in SCP-920 and the follower becoming lost.

There is no determinable point at which SCP-920's effects will take place. Seemingly random events such as malfunctioning radar systems and GPS units, earthquakes, cloud formations, and severe human negligence have all been recorded to manifest when transportation of SCP-920 has been attempted.

SCP-920 seems to have a slight psychic pull, causing subjects that come in contact with SCP-920 to feel a compulsion to "walk and talk with him". Conversing with SCP-920 is not recommended, as typically subjects will follow SCP-920 and become lost.

SCP-920 does not appear to have normal human requirements, and can "wander" through deserts, tundras, and oceans without encountering difficulties.

**Addendum 920-1:** SCP-920 was discovered at Entrance [EXPUNGED] of Site-██. However, during escort to Hall-██, SCP-920 escaped containment. SCP-920 was later discovered outside a small town near Site-██. Attempts at re-containment were discontinued following the disappearance of ██ personnel.

**Addendum 920-2:** The words "Mr. Lost, from Little Misters ® by Dr. Wondertainment" are tattooed upon SCP-920's left calf. This designation appears as "16" in document [[[SCP-909]]]-a. SCP-920 was originally discovered wearing a green hoodie, a white t-shirt, and jeans. The brand name "Doctor's Orders" is sewn into all tags.

**Addendum 920-3:** //Yes, by lost we mean **lost**. Misplaced, disoriented, off-course, whatever you'd like to call it. No, personnel have not been sent to "another plane of infinite Misters".// -Dr. █████████

**Addendum 920-3:** Incident 920-3:

> **SCP involved:** SCP-920
> 
> **Personnel involved:** Members of Mobile Task Force Iota-One
> 
> **Date:** 03/16/████
> 
> **Location:** Albertan Badlands
> 
> **Description:** Following an inability to transport SCP-920 to Site-██, MTF Iota-One made the decision to place a temporary facility around SCP-920 while it is moving. A small wooden "facility" was prepared to be dropped overhead. SCP-920 was located in the Alberta Badlands.
> 
> MTF Iota-One quickly flew overhead of SCP-920 in a large helicopter with the "facility" strapped in below. As Iota-One began lowering the "facility", a series of seemingly random events occurred.
> 
> The main pilot, Agent ████████, had an insect fly into his mouth. The co-pilot, Agent ███████, heard the pilot's choking, and looked over at the pilot, releasing his hands momentarily in order to assist his partner. At this point, a sudden gust of wind hit the helicopter. Due to both pilot's hands being absent from the controls, it momentarily spun out of control, causing the "facility" to be released. The momentum caused by the release of the "facility" sent the helicopter flying into a nearby ridge. Both agents are able to successfully abandon the helicopter and parachute safely to the ground before it crashes.
> 
> The remaining personnel, who had been waiting nearby in case something went wrong, immediately rushed to the scene when they heard the pilot choking. As they entered the area, the "facility" came down near them, causing debris to fly into several mechanical components of all of Iota-One's vehicles. Finding themselves without transportation, Iota-One had to cease current capture attempts of SCP-920 and call for rescue assistance from Site-██.
> 
> Several members of Mobile Task Force Iota-One later noted that SCP-920 appeared to be oblivious of all the incidents occurring around it.
