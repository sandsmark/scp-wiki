**Investigation Notes:** Dr. Randall Bessette has come under investigation for questionable emotional responses to various recent events. Colleagues have noted that Bessette has expressed elation, glee, and excitement when made aware of a developing emergency situation. Coworkers report inappropriate grinning, laughter, hand clapping during recent containment breaches, Site incursions, and at the destruction of D-Class personnel during testing. While pleasure in one's work is encouraged by the Foundation, Bessette's attitudes are possibly symptomatic of post-traumatic stress, a sociopathic nature, or a hostility towards Foundation and its mission. 

Official response is pending a full psychological evaluation.
