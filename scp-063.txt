title:Scp 063
**Item#:** SCP-063

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-063 is to be kept at all times within Dr. ████'s personal bathroom, located within the personnel quarters upon Site 19. Object is to be used according to its design at least once in any 24 hour period or the object will begin to emit an unknown specialized radiation that results in objects and material within a two feet radius being slowly warped and eventually disintegrating into a fine dust. Radiation's effect on living test subjects has not been monitored.


**Description:** SCP-063 appears to be an average, pale blue toothbrush. Stenciled alone the side of the object are the words “The World's Best TothBrush”. The word toothbrush is spelled wrong, although if this was accidental, or a purposeful action by the creators of the object are unknown. Object displays the ability to effortlessly cleave through any and all dead or inorganic matter, the focal point of this ability being the bristles. However, matter touched by this is not separated, such as by way of a knife, but completely expunged from existence, leaving no trace. Lab analysis have discerned no strange attributes to its physical composition, being made completely of common plastic. Additionally subjects who have used SCP-063 have claimed that the experience left their teeth feeling remarkably clean.


**Additional:** SCP-063 was originally found in St. Petersburg, on the person of  █████████, a thief working in the area using the SCP-063's abilities to crack safes. When questioned about the object, subject remained ignorant, claiming that the they had simply “found” the object one day. Questioning of the subject continued, until he took his own life. His reason for doing this is, as of yet, unknown.
