||||Label for SCP objects designated to the "Elucid" classification  ||
[[/div]]


Elucid objects are generally safe, however, contain mechanisms that are foreign to humans, and display erratic or seemingly impossible behaviours. Although they can be used for benefit of the the SCP or humanity, due to their unusual nature, may have unforseen rammifications after their use. 

Their properties are impossible to duplicate using current technologies, and many attempts are made to duplicate those behaviours. SCPs generally do not stay Elucid for long, as they have high potential of becoming either Keter level objects, or being understood enough to be declared safe.
