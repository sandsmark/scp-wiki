title:Euclid
Euclid objects are generally safe, but contain mechanisms that are foreign to humans, and display erratic or seemingly impossible behaviours. Although they can be used for the benefit of the SCP Foundation or of humanity, due to their unusual nature, they may have unforeseen ramifications after their use. 

Their properties are impossible to duplicate using current technologies, and many attempts are made to duplicate those behaviours. SCPs generally do not stay Euclid for long, as they have high potential of becoming either Keter-level objects, or being understood enough to be declared safe.
