**Item #:** SCP-Jaguar-J

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-Jaguar-J is not currently capable of being contained, due to an uncertainty as to its position. Agents deployed to the zone SCP-Jaguar-J is supposedly situated has not resulted in confirmed visual contact. Inspections of all nearby auto repair shops within a 7 mile radius of this location disproved Researcher Hutchin's claims of its current status. 

**Description:** SCP-Jaguar-J is an anomalous automobile which is hypothetically owned by Researcher Hutchins. Although all known documentation of SCP-Jaguar-J depict a total lemon, it has been vehemently claimed by Researcher Hutchins that these photographs are an anomaly, and that when viewed with the eye it appears to be a Jaguar luxury automobile. These claims have not been substantiated.

Dr. Hutchins has been making such claims since he was a Junior Staff Member on the [[[scp-2600-j| SCP-2600]]] research team, and despite persistent attempts to view it has always been unable to show any of the [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-88| Site 88]]] staff. Despite hosting the annual Site-88 Decemberween party on multiple occasions, not one individual has reported seeing SCP-Jaguar-J. During visual inspection of the garage only a large empty patch of concrete covered with oils and unidentified metallic parts were found.

Should Researcher Hutchins ever be able to provide substantiated evidence of SCP-Jaguar-J, he will be promoted to a full Operations Researcher and be assigned as the lead science adviser on all SCP-Jaguar-J testing.

__Researcher Notes(2)__

> Come on guys. This is unprofessional. I joined the SCP Foundation because I thought you guys would be into this sort of thing. I have to take it to the shop a lot because insurance companies won't cover me with the pictures. Also, one time my girlfriend from up in Canada came down and borrowed it to go meet a man about a horse. You guys are really not taking this as seriously as you should. I've had this car for years, if you came when I said it was there you'd totally see I'm telling the truth. -- Researcher Hutchins.

> Fine. It is possible that SCP-Jaguar-J may also be of the Jaguar XKR-S model, but due to the lack of visual evidence I predict this visit will result in an SCP-Jaguar-XK-End-of-Your-Lies scenario. -- Dr. Morse.

**Addendum Jaguar-XE:** After the deployment of Mobile Truth Force Lie-7 "Randi's Henchmen" it was discovered that SCP-Jaguar-J did in fact exist and displayed surprisingly accurate anomalous properties. As promised, Junior Researcher Hutchins has been given Level 1 Clearance and the title of Operational Researcher. He is currently assigned to work on SCP-Jaguar-J.

**Testing Location:** Site-88 Indoor Testing Region

**Hypothesis:** SCP-Jaguar-J may display different anomalous properties with different paint configurations, seating adjustments, option alterations, or another anomalous component causing the entire machine to display this anomalous phenomenon. Due to Researcher Hutchin's lack of mechanical expertise, he will observe from the upper viewing deck.
