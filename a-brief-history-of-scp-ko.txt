It all started with the games. When Containment Breach and SCP-087-B came out in May of 2012, they were massively popular in Korea, to the same level that it was in the United States, Russia, and elsewhere. People all over the country were playing the game, talking about it, and looking into its origin.

As the SCP Foundation erupted in Korea, and as the community continued gaining people, the main point of interest was not the game, but the SCP articles themselves. So on May 2012, a Korean translation site was hosted on the Korean Rigveda wiki. SCP-KR began translation on a  massive and rapid scale. 

The Founder of SCP Korea HQ was originally Merlin Emrys, and  co-founder scpfskhq. This site was able to gain some very skilled translators from the beginning. Shfoakdls, Devanos and QAZ135 were the three original translators, with the occasional addition of a user named Daniel. Major SCPs were translated, such as the big four of SCP-173, 682, 087, 096, and many, many more.

There was one major rival with this Korean site, a user named Dr. Kim. As the SCP Korea HQ grew, Dr Kim established his blog, SCP-ROK, and began creating his own SCP translations. He contacted SCP Korea HQ staff asking to use some of their translations to include in ROK. Because of license problems, they had to consult with other users on the issue, and did not answer him immediately. Instead, they promised to answer when they were able to make a final decision. While the voting and discussion about this was going on, Dr Kim established his new site in kind of a private wiki form and started gathering users.

SCP Korea HQ staff were very surprised by this development, but didn't want to enlarge the problem and allowed Kim to do this. After a month, Dr Kim went to the SCP English Wiki, and attempted to officially confirm that his blog was the official Korean translation site of the foundation. If one looks at the main page history, his wiki was the first to be added. Note that initially, Dr Kim simply added himself to the page without consulting SCP English site administration.

Shfoakdls and Devanos of SCP Korea HQ contacted him about this, and he claimed that the SCP English site was debating about putting his blog in the main page. As part of the discussion, Dr Kim proposed a possibility of doing sort of a symbiosis with SCP Korea HQ. At this point HQ staff researched about the news, saw the message from Dr Kim on the O5 Command, and were enraged. So, they stopped talks with Dr. Kim, and founded the WikiDot Korean wiki.

There were over 250 translations at that time, so they had to make a wiki, move people, and move translations.
Previously to this, QAZ135 had been planning to make a move to WikiDot, but the project was boosted by the drama with Dr Kim. Following this, and several communications with the English SCP Wiki, The SCP Korean wiki established by shfoakdls, QAZ135 and Devanos, was unanimously concluded as official Korean wiki. This wiki is the one known as SCP-KR.

After all the drama was wrapped up, Devanos announced that Korean wiki is officially hostile to Dr Kim's blog. In turn, Dr Kim announced that he would apologize, and asked for the facts that he should apologize for. So the two sets of staff had continuous arguments over this issue, and over the issue of legitimacy. It was consuming too much of the staff's time, so shfoakdls and QAZ135 put a stop to it. They stopped all official policy against Dr Kim and SCP-ROK. 

After that, except for several conflicts between Devanos and Dr Kim, SCP-KR was able to focus on translating articles and moving content from SCP Korea HQ onto the WikiDot site. They had most translation in Korea, Most foundation tale translation, and users were constantly coming in. Devanos wanted SCP Korean wiki end its relationship with original SCP Korea HQ. Other staff disagreed. They argued that it would be just a lousy thing to do, since Founder of SCP Korea HQ had allowed them continue the wiki project, knowing that all the users and translation would move to Korean wiki.

> It wasn't a really great thing for them. - //shfoakdls//

The admin Devanos was upset about the fact that shfoakdls and QAZ135 did not want to cut off ties to SCP Korea HQ. So after a long conversation, he decided to give up his admin position and remain as a user. This incident occured on 2012/11/28. After Devanos gave up his position, only two active admins were left. [[footnote]]There was also scpfskhq, but they gave him that position because he was the co-founder of SCP Korea HQ. He didn't really do anything, so they didn't count him as an admin.[[/footnote]]

Then, on 2013/01/16, SCP-KR's mother site, SCP Korea HQ site disappeared.

All the staff and users were blocked, articles were erased, and the site was essentially erased and destroyed. SCP-KR users simply assumed a hacker did it, in order to destroy the large site and make a small site for people who liked the HQ and wanted to use it instead of SCP-KR. Unfortunately, the loss of this site also meant the loss of the excellent translation work done by user Daniel, who had declined to have his work moved to SCP-KR. There were many guesses on what happened with the site, such as this theory:

> The user who was involved in the situation confessed that it was the Merlin Emrys, the founder of HQ who did it.
> 
> He told that Merlin Emrys was fed up with all these SCP Foundation and thought it was a great idea to pretend he was hacked and delete everything.
>
> (This is what happens when a major admin decides to delete the whole site on his own. Beware, Roget.) - //shfoakdls//

There is only this anonymous users word to go on for this theory. So it cannot be said that it's definitely true, but that was the most detailed answer put forth by any party.

With this incident, SCP-KR announced that it was completely separate and irrelevant from the smaller SCP Korea HQ site. After that, everything just went normal, to this day. Since then, they've translated Containment Breach into Korean, gotten up to date with the Creative Commons License, and made a chatroom. 

On January 6th, 2014, the SCP-KR folks changed their ISO, to SCP-KO. This was done after receiving the help of SophosBlitz, who was contacted through the help of the SCP moderator Roget.

Shfoakdls requested that I end the essay on this note, as he feels it is advice which is relevant not only to the SCP-KR wiki, but to us and every other community involved with our collective work. Sophos added the SCP-KR domain to his name, which made it much easier to change. And so, from that point, the site was known as SCP-KO.

> There was a whole lot drama, but SCP goes on, and we will try for the better.
