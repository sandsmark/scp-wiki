The mumbling and the talking have flooded Agent Zyck's ears, ever since he got Staff Sergeant in one of the Internal Security Agencies he got a disgusting ear feeling ever since he had to conduct an investigation of an SCP attack Victim.

"For fuck sakes of the god, What the hell are you doing?!" Said Micheal

Micheal had been a rival of Zyck during their careers, they never got along and its expected they never will. Nobody knows why.

"For all we know, the damn statue could be fucking anywhere, God these fucking kids."
Zyck ignored Micheal and continued walking into the house where the incident took place. Suddenly, he felt a cold breath and heavy breathing "It surely isn't 106" he thought to himself, SCP-173 was the only person out the facility, they got distracted by..more disturbing ways.

The radio exploded in noise and almost killed Zyck's ears. "What the hell! That almost killed my eardrums" and it looks like Franklin got to a powerful enough power source to connect back to control suddenly he heard screaming of Men and women, Boys and girls, Breaking of bones…Franklin spotted it, in the road with bodies near it with a terrified look in their eyes…Micheal grabbed Franklin's radio and screamed CONTROL TO OUTPOST, 173 SPOTTED IN CARLA! Micheal looked in fear as 173 stared at them.

"Alright! One of us has to stare at him-" Micheal interrupted "How are we supposed to take care of that bitch! He will kill us by a millisecond!"
"Just..Close your eyes and one of us will stare at him"
They slowly backed away and into the tunnel where they hopped behind a fence hiding behind a bush.

Hello? Is..anyone there? Drake saw what happened to his friends and saw 3 random people in..Suits with one with glasses and the other arguing before they looked at the boy and whispered something before the shrieks of screams came, Drake was a curious kid and did they worst decisions most of the time. By the time the screams and everyone ran out he looked at the street
it was gone
Sighed in relief, Drake went up north trying to ignore the bodies but he can never ignore it he learned little to nothing about the thing, he only got nothing but a small fragment of information on it as his father was a Chaos Insurgency Operative. He went to a women's house for some candy as he went to a safe location but the house looked pretty old. Its probably wood or something Drake thought he ringed the bell and a woman appeared

"Well, you seem like a scary person, What's your costume sweetheart?"

"Its a dinosaur! Ra..Rawr" He thought he heard something behind him for a minute, but he ignored it for a while
He got his candy and went out but was startled by screams, He ran to the window and then found the women dead. Whatever the fuck it is, he had to run he ran faster than a deer, a wolf, anything! He just had to get the fuck out of there. He came to a stop…his pounding heart killed his stream of blood and eventually he figured out he was at his other friend's house, it was a block away from his family's home so he just walked there and went inside the bedroom

"Son, Come see this!"

"What is-Oh my fucking hell"

The news captured dead bodies at the street with the lights of the police cruisers with investigatiors, one of the shots captured it, that..thing the sculpture

"Oh god"

"What is it?"

"Uh..it's nothing dad, its just I was near the scene"

"Huh, Well son best be going to bed!"

Drake was awakened by gunshots and screams, He rushed to his dad's room wishing he was alive..he was gone and his computer was smashed and his tv, He saw it behind him and he blinked

Jake woke up in a forest near a rundown, abandoned hospital parking lot. He already tried recollecting his thoughts but it was no use, His back throbbed and it didn't show signs of stopping…yet

An MTF member found SCP 173 in a field with nobody else around other than their squad team, They quickly captured it via cage and brought it in a relocation truck back to Site 19 with heavy security, 15 days after the incident, SCP-173's cell had more technical difficulties with the lights then last time

"What a fucking pain in the ass" Micheal sighed and he hopes that one day, he would never see it again

But, it will be a turbulent time
