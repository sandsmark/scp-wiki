title:Investigation into Darkness
The sounds of men and women, boys and girls talking flooded Kyle's ears, During an IA operation, A bullet damaged the entrance above the ear canal, leaving him kind of deaf
"I am so fucking done! How long is this going to take to track those motherfuckers" Shouted Mike
Mike had always been an impatient agent in the Internal Security Department in the foundation, even though he's the staff sergeant in the Red Right Hand he was always impatient and quite rude, Kyle and Mike never got along and nobody knows why. "Alright, I managed to connect..whatever the fuck this is to that thingy right there, We can contact HQ now and check that dead girl there and those glasses while I investigate more further." Kyle, who always follows orders investigated the girl, she had bruises on her legs, her sweatshirt covered in blood and stab marks not done by any ordinary murderer, Kyle almost threw up. If you knew about his past its a bit strange you know? Kyle always handled gore guess it didn't work this time. 
"I don't know whats worse, the fact many of the SCP's are hiding somewhere here below us or tha-" Franklin paused and looked at the people, Confused he stepped outside to where he saw an explosion near a building followed by screams of fear
"What the hell is that, Is that an SCP?," Said, Mike
"I don't know, I only see a...FUCK ITS THE OLD MAN!" Shouted Kyle

Kyle slams the door shut, Praying 106 won't come their way and it worked...for now. 

"I just hope it didn't attract his attention, Anyways I got something. These glasses have involvement, its SCP 178" Said Franklin 
The problem was that their connection ran out with HQ, They have been ignoring them ever since that 106 came out and started taking the citizens.
"Alright, Whatever the fuck happened we need to get out, we lost contact with HQ hopefully we can get the others to investigate further, but we have to move, I don't want to get removed from existence by the old man"
"So long as I have breath in my body, I will never ever live in that shithole" Said Franklin

Jason and Ref and Yehd always seem to walk to school with each other, While walking around an apartment they saw...a strange statue in one of the windows, Thinking it's just a prank the continued walking facing away for some reason, the atmosphere became pretty eerie and then they heard screams by almost 500 people, at least they thought it was..Terrified now they looked back and they saw it...the statue, Yehd remembered about the 3 people with suits one of them with glasses and one of them saying something about a statue in a home with police tape, They turned around and ran but then //SNAP// they saw Jason down on the concrete with his neck snapped, Ref and little info about SCP-173, but he didn't know about him not looking Jason, on the other hand, was an expert, But jason wasn't there. 3 minutes later Ref and Yehd came back to Yehd's home, during the day when they were terrified, they saw it..that thing outside...Yehd blinked and now it was there..in their room...Ref did the unthinkable...he blinked

Jacob came across what he described as horrifying, he suddenly woke up with his back throbbing endlessly, He looked to his left and saw the wall covered in a black substance breaking into the brick wall and looked to the right, A strange old man was in the shadow's carrying something, He thought it was an ordinary man and walked up to him but the old man spotted him and started coming up to him with a strange music, confused he decided to walk away but the music kept going and then..a black substance hole appeared and the old man came up and grabbed him..it damaged his organs and he felt nothing as he slowly got pulled to the pocket dimension
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Months after searching for the SCP'S they were all found, Multiple MTF Re-containment unit squads were sent out, They spotted 106,096, and the rest that breached. 106 was reported to have changed in attitude but nothing THAT bad

Mike, Kyle, and Franklin we're awarded. Mike however wanted to forget about even seeing these SCP'S but its going to be a turbulent time


But he can one day figure it out..at least for now.
