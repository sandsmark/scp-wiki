**Item #:** SCP-334

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-334 is to be kept in a standard containment cell, surrounded by magnetic field generators positioned so that all six sides have an overlapping field projecting at least fifteen (15) centimeters from the inner cell walls.  Each generator is to have multiple redundant backups and power sources, including emergency batteries capable of maintaining full magnetic field output for no less than thirty (30) minutes. Three (3) live mice are to be introduced to its cell at a random time every day to reduce chances of subject learning the pattern and attempting escape.

**Description:** SCP-334 is a small cloud of superheated plasma in the shape of a common housecat.  Its body appears  similar to waves of steam or fire, revealing gaps between the filaments of gas through which the opposite side is visible, with the filaments fluorescing in the spectrum of grey, white, or silver, with 'eyes' in the blue spectrum. Subject has a negligible measurable mass, and has no central body to speak of.  SCP-334 apparently believes it is actually a common housecat, and displays a wide range of normal feline behaviors, such as grooming, sleeping, hunting of prey, and in test 334C-03 [REDACTED].  Whether it is an entity that somehow imprinted on a feline or is a feline which was somehow transformed to its current state is unknown and under investigation.

 Being composed of superheated ionized gas, containment of SCP-334 is effectively impossible without the use of magnetic containment fields, and is difficult even then, as the heat and energetic effects extend an average of seven (7) centimeters around its entire body, rapidly sublimating physical obstructions.  Despite having a surface temperature in excess of ████ degrees Celsius, the heat disperses rapidly, cooling to ██ degrees Celsius within 10 centimeters, far faster than the laws of thermodynamics would indicate.  Subject is capable of bursts of speed measured at approximately one hundred and sixty (160) kilometers per hour for around ten seconds.  These bursts of speed disperse the subjects mass, 'tiring it out', making it need to 'rest' while it re-forms.

  Subject derives 'nourishment' from converting matter into plasma and absorbing it, taking in a small amount of energy normally through conversion of air into ionized gas, but that alone is insufficient to feed it, making supplementary feeding necessary.  

  Despite the fact it doesn't touch the ground when it walks and is immune to the pull the Earth's gravity, it is content to follow the floor's surface for walkable areas, and has yet to be seen actually 'flying'.  Whether it doesn't know it can, or chooses not to is unknown at this time.

  Due to its physical makeup, SCP-334 constantly emits a level of EM radiation consistent with a class █ solar flare, causing interference in unshielded electronics within ██ meters and making film or electronic surveillance problematic.  Radiation is within tolerable limits for SCP personnel.

**Initial containment:** SCP-334 was recovered ██ kilometers from [REDACTED], █ kilometers from the impact site of a meteor.  Whether this was the subject's origin is still under investigation.  The Foundation was alerted to the subject's existence when a routine sweep of emergency services reports found a pattern of strange burns, trails, and [REDACTED] discovered in the woods, matching no publicly known source but consistent with [DATA EXPUNGED]  A full Foundation combat team was sent in to contain the suspected [REDACTED] but found SCP-334 instead, a far lesser threat.  Utilizing a magnetic containment bottle, a laser pointer, and two live mice, subject was contained with an acceptable level of casualties.

**Addendum:** SCP-334 has a talent for escape, having escaped containment no fewer than ██ times since initial retrieval, causing approximately [REDACTED] dollars in structural damage to Site-██ and the deaths of ██ personnel, mostly caused by the aforementioned structural damage.  SCP-334 has been described by most researchers as being "an antisocial little dick", avoiding human contact, yet seemingly enjoying hiding in offices, barracks, and on-site quarters, where it can do the most damage to personal items.

***Testing log:** 

Experiment Log 334T-01 through 334T-48
Date: ██/██/2010
Test Subject: A Selection of small prey animals ranging from mice to medium-sized rabbits
Results: Subject stalked each one for varying lengths of time, apparently biding its time before pouncing.  Each test subject sublimated into plasma, which was absorbed by SCP-334 through the 'mouth' as it went through the motions of eating.

Experiment Log 334C-01
Date ██/██/2010
Test Subject: A Common housecat (Male)
Results: Test subject displayed high levels of apprehension, with loud hissing and growling.  SCP-334 appeared disinterested.  Test halted after ██ minutes of no appreciable change in either's reaction.

Experiment Log 334C-02
Date ██/██/2010
Test Subject: A common housecat (female)
Results: Identical to 334C-01

Experiment Log 334C-03
Date ██/██/2010
Test Subject: A common housecat (Female, in heat)
Results: SCP-334 appeared to sniff the air for a moment, while test subject displayed reactions similar to previous two tests, then [DATA EXPUNGED]
Researcher Note: //That was something I hope to never see again.//

Experiment Log 334-01
Date ██/██/2010
Test Subject: SCP-334
Note: For this test, SCP-334's cell was flooded with ionized gas identical to its own.
Results: SCP-334 appeared curious at first, then agitated as the pressure of ionized gas in the chamber started to rise.  After 5 minutes, subject began glowing brightly and [DATA EXPUNGED]tainment was re-established, with SCP-334 apparently exhausted.

Experiment Log 334-02
Date ██/██/2010
Test Subject: SCP-334
Note: For this test, SCP-334 was subjected to a focused magnetic 'blade' to attempt to sever a section of its mass.
Results: [DATA EXPUNGED]

**NOTE:** Further experimentation with 'force feeding' or 'cutting' SCP-334 is forbidden unless performed in heavily shielded remote site.

Experiment Log 334D-01
Date ██/██/2010
Test Subject: D-13487/334
Note: D-class was introduced to containment, given several popular cat toys as well as a low-power 'keychain' laser pointer, and told to try playing with SCP-334.
Results: SCP-334 chased the dot of the laser pointer around the room, in much the same way as a regular cat. However, in one pass, SCP-334 decided to run between D-13487/334's legs to reach the dot, resulting in vaporization of D-class's lower extremities.  D-13487/334 terminated, autopsy shows the expected plasma burns and flash-cauterized flesh.  SCP-334 merely continued searching for the laser dot.
Researcher Note: //Well, it certainly thinks it's a cat, and doesn't seem to notice, or care, that it can kill people just by getting too close.//
