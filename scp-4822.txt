**Item #:** SCP-4822

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4822 is to be kept in a standard humanoid storage container. Photos taken by SCP-4822 are to be stored in the non-anomalous visual media library in Site-922.

**Description:** SCP-4822 is the corpse of Steven Christenberry, a professional photographer based in Sandusky, Ohio. It is dressed in a button down striped shirt, vest, and denim jeans.

Whenever SCP-4822 occupies a space with more than two people for approximately 40 minutes, its skin will flash with a bright light five to nine times. Once finished, several photographs will be found in its vest pocket, the quantity equal to the number of times flashed. The contents of the photos depict the individuals nearby SCP-4822 engaging in romantic or recreational activities. These scenes are fabricated, as no one has yet confirmed these events to have ever occurred.

**Discovery:** SCP-4822 became active during its visitation funeral, when it flashed eight times. When it was inspected by funeral staff, eight photographs displaying SCP-4822's family and friends kissing in the rain and enjoying several roller coasters were found in its vest. The event was collectively dismissed as a malfunctioning light switch, until a second activation occurred, manifesting six photos of SCP-4822's brother's pregnant belly being caressed by all attending individuals simultaneously.

The incident attracted Foundation attention after it had been reported in the local newspaper.
