You were the black haired security guard who unloaded your gun at SCP-1305, you may know it as the Cat Lure, and drew it away from me. Without you I know I would have been turned into one of those things. I would enjoy the chance to at least buy you a drink or dinner sometime at the site cafeteria, so please reply with what SCP-1305 said just before you shot at it.

I would love to meet up for lunch. Please meet me in the Site 17 cafeteria tomorrow at 1:30 PM. We can share our unique tastes and maybe something more.

I lost my wallet and you were kind enough to buy me something to eat- I was STARVING! Sadly, you left before I could even get your name. You told me a little bit about how you used your gun. I think you referred to it as 'Martha'? I'd like to know more about you! I'm stuck in the labs mostly so maybe you can tell me some stories about the outside over dinner? It's on me! Please meet me outside site 19's mess hall at 5pm on the 21st (sunday!)

The first time I ever saw you, you looked to be in your 50‚Äôs, maybe a few years younger than me, with your greying amber hair in a loose bun. When our eyes met, I saw relief cross your face, and maybe something‚Ä¶ deeper. Then your eyes went wide, and you looked away.

You were a researcher at Site-551, the one where I'm stationed at. A really big containment breach happened, I don't know the specifics, but we we're in the safe room waiting for the MTF to get everything under control, and everyone was scared as hell.

> You decided to pass the time with some jokes, and some personal life stories. I'll be really honest, but that's probably the hardest I've ever laughed for as long as I can remember. For the first time in a while, you've made me feel better when I needed it most.

Running those experiments into the early hours of the morning you often have the place to yourself when grabbing a coffee refill. You entered behind me at some point and started singing along. We talked about music for another fifteen minutes before I needed to get back to the lab. I never caught your name and I haven't seen you around the site since. Hope to see you around again sometime. Until then, I guess we simply Missed The Boat.

I remember how your eyes looked like my sister's and I had to remind myself that preserving human life, preserving your life, it didn't matter if only lasted a month. I remember that you were the only person who laughed at my jokes on the team, how it was loud and a little hysterical. I remember the pitying look my supervisor gave me as I watched you go every night with a mix of relief and cold horror. I remember counting down in my head to the thirty-first. I think it fucked me up more than the project did.

In Area 12 you were the one giving the seminar to all the new researchers. You somehow managed to make it digestible, even though everything I knew about science and the world was being shattered in front of my eyes. Later, I got transferred to Site-36 because of God-knows-why, and you apparently came along too, since I saw you (beautifully) play your cello for the Site's annual talent show. I asked around a little bit, but apparently that was your last day? Then I got kicked around to Site-41. I saw you in the hallways, and in the mess hall, but I never worked up the nerve to talk to you until my last day there.

Thought it might be just one of those things that happens, but I got to thinking about how memory's a bit fuzzy around here, what with that window meme going 'round and all. I thought about it longer, and yeah, I really think I must have known you at some point.

I'm out inside SCP-3018's enclosure from 9:00 to 5:00 (almost makes it sound like a normal job) every Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday. Sometimes I'm out there Saturdays for recreation. I used to wear glasses (got contacts now), I'm a little overweight, I've got a mustache and the beginnings of a beard that never grows quite like I want it to. If you were erased from my memory for some classified reason, then I guess ignore this, but if not, I'd really hate to forget an important person in my life.

Anyway, back when a shipment of that shit from those Russians made it to Brighton Beach, we'd declared it a Level-V breach. Of course, we called in Epsilon-10, aka those hotshots who got all the hardware we borrowed from the US. So you come in, in one of our helicopters, shooting at some tentacle flesh horror, and then manage to stick a landing on an elevated train track. Honestly, chalk it up to me being stupid and gay, but i was instantly in love. I was inspired to write this because Site-201 is the all-important support site, and if you're not transferred, you'll be staying here. Get back to me and we can have a coffee or something.
