**Item #:** SCP-XXXX

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Three samples of contaminated precipitation are to be maintained within a storage locker in the Infectious Wing of Research Site-██. Reports of "cloud iridescence" are to be tracked until the likely area of precipitation can be identified and evacuated. Cover stories involving tornado activity are to be prepared and distributed afterwards, with area cleanup to consist of evaporation of contaminated water via heat lamp. 

Objects and subjects affected by SCP-858 are to be detained and destroyed on-site, incinerated, and their remains allowed to escape Earth orbit.

**Description:** SCP-858 is a migrating noctiluscent cloud which affects cirrus cloud formations beneath it. Presence of SCP-858 can be easily identified by the iridescent refraction within the cirrus formations, which- once affected- descend until precipitation ensues. Contact with precipitation from affected clouds immediately and permanently alters matter on contact, causing affected objects to be repelled by, rather than attracted by, gravitational force. Barring sufficiently sturdy objects secured to sufficiently massive objects embedded or otherwise secured to Earth's surface, this results in the affected object accelerating away from the Earth's surface at 9.8m/s^^2^^. Upon contact with SCP-858 itself at roughly 80km above sea level, affected objects vanish.

**Encounter Summary 858-A:** First encounter with SCP-858 was a meteorological survey aircraft passing through an affected cloud formation. When the aircraft was affected by SCP-858, the pilot was able to invert the aircraft and maintain flight for several hours; unable to land, the crew- protected from the effects of SCP-858 by the fuselage- was forced to bail out. The affected aircraft continued to fly on autopilot until it ran out of fuel, at which time it entered free-fall away from the Earth's surface. The plane's lateral velocity was sufficient to carry it past the boundaries of SCP-858. Later reports indicated forced emergency maneuvers on the part of a Russian satellite in the trajectory of the plane's debris. No other objects have been detected passing the Kármán line[[footnote]] The Kármán line is generally used to define the point at 100km from Earth at which outer space is considered to begin. [[/footnote]].

Descriptions of the oddly colored cloud formations and their location led researchers to what remained of a small farming community outside of Xenia, Ohio. After a Foundation plant within the airline company reported the plane's instruments indicating it leaving Earth's atmosphere before failing completely, an investigative team was dispatched to the location. The vehicle in which the team arrived was lost upon contact with damp road surfaces, but after leaping free of the vehicle, losses among initial responders were startlingly small, as the mass of responder hazmat suits were insufficient to overcome their occupant's weight while protecting them from the effect itself. All standing structures were devastated and, along with all residents outside of cellar shelters with strong foundations, unaccounted for. 

Reports from survivors aided in identification of the source of the anomalous effect, as eyewitness reports of survivors emerging from their basements after the "invisible tornado" were seen rapidly ascending into the sky, along with other vehicles arriving after the fact. Those persons able to exit their vehicles inevitably suffered the same fate, regardless of whether their jump proved fatal or not, as upon impact, without the protection the responder's hazmat suits offered, they were affected and lost to SCP-858. Events left the survivors unwilling to leave their cellars until responders arrived, with three families lost when they presumed themselves safe upon sight of responding agents. Remaining survivors were extracted after following natural evaporation of the anomalous precipitate, and were treated with amnestics before being released to their surviving relatives.
