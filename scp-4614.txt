**Special Containment Procedures:** Until a method has been found for mass extermination in public areas of SCP-4614, it's currently only to be removed in those who work in The Foundation due to concerned issues with cross-contamination with other anomalous organisms. If any personnel are found with SCP-4614, they are to be quarantined for two (2) days. If SCP-4614's anomalous effects are discovered by the public, the discoveries are to appear as hoaxes, and the scientists/publishers will be amnesticized by using [http://www.scp-wiki.net/updated-amnestics-guide Class C amnestics].

**Description:** SCP-4614 (//Milnesium tardigradum//) is a species of the extremophile phylum tardigrades. SCP-4614 instances are common throughout the entire world, but are mostly found in moist areas. SCP-4614 are completely harmless until their anomalous abilities manifest. In no cases has an SCP-4614 instance affected any organism other than a human.

SCP-4614's secondary (passive) anomalies manifest once an instance locates a human. It will grow a pair of microscopic wings and travel to the subject. It is unknown how SCP-4614 instances manage to do this due to the lack of sensory organs needed, and miniature size that it has. Once an SCP-4614 instance reaches the human's face, they will slowly crawl into the host's ear. After a SCP-4614 instance crawls inside the host's ear (now referred to as SCP-4614-1) , it will nest in the tympanic membrane and slowly expand to be 0.01 cm.[[footnote]] Originally 0.7 mm in length [[/footnote]] SCP-4614 instances will begin to send an unknown and hardly detectable signal by using what is theorized to be a small organ. This signal has been shown to cause human brain waves to constantly be in the 25-40 Hz range[[footnote]] Gamma brain waves[[/footnote]] throughout the time the SCP-4614-1 is awake. SCP-4614-1 will never feel or detect these signals consciously. These constant arrays of gamma waves causes SCP-4614-1 to have enhanced perception, problem solving, and consciousness due to the constant brain activity. SCP-4614 instances will then proceed to get its sustenance by the use of an organ that fleshes out of SCP-4614 and injects a compound into SCP-4614-1's bloodstream, once the compound reaches the brain, the waves will bleed out through the ear, SCP-4614 will then proceed to consume it using another unknown organ.  SCP-4614 can live on these brain waves for up to thirty (30) years. Whether the brain waves are just a food to SCP-4614 or something that simply make the organism live longer is currently unknown since the non-anomalous life span of SCP-4614 is 6 years in the wild. It is theorized the SCP-4614 instances use SCP-4614 -1's brain waves to provide neurological functions for itself. 

SCP-4614 's primary (active) anomalies will manifest once the human has been awake for 12-16 hours. After this amount of time, SCP-4614 instances will then send another barely detectable signal that forces brain waves to be 4-7 Hz. [[footnote]] Theta Waves [[/footnote]]  If the brain ignores these signals, SCP-4614 's primary anomaly will still manifest once the subject enters REM sleep. Once the subject enters REM sleep, SCP-4614 instances will activate certain parts of the brain; typically those with memory and decision making in the top parts of the brain. [[footnote]] dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [[/footnote]] This will induce what is commonly known as a lucid dream 0.0001-0.1% of the time depending on how intelligent and cognitive the subject is [[footnote]] By the use of The Standard Foundation IQ Test that is much more accurate[[/footnote]]. SCP-4614 can live off of these lucid dreams for up to sixty (60) years. SCP-4614 will decrease the average human lifespan by ten (10) years, but increases the average intelligence by five (5) IQ points.

**Addendum-A9183-21:** After all of our studies, it seems like SCP-4614 has been living off of the human species since the 1800s. It's crazy to think that something so common [lucid dreams] is caused by some anomalous entity. The study of SCP-4614 should be necessary due to how much it has affected humanity. 

-Researcher Charles

**Discovery:** SCP-4614's anomalous effects were discovered by biologist Алексей Петров (Alexei Petrov) in 18██. The recovered journal of Alexei Petrov was discovered in 1972, which has lead to The Foundation's discovery of SCP-4614's primary anomalous effects.

I've made an interesting discovery today. As a part of a separate study I've been doing, I was examining my friends ear when I noticed something odd. I had put cotton inside his ear in hopes of getting the cells inside his ear. Sadly, it got stuck deep inside his ear and we had to visit a doctor to get it removed. He told me something interesting on the trip there. He mentioned that he had experienced his first aware dream [[footnote]] The term 'lucid dream' was not coined until 1913 [[/footnote]]a few weeks ago, and consistently kept aware dreaming until the cotton incident. When I looked at the cotton sample back at my office using the flea glass, [[footnote]] Old name for "microscope" [[/footnote]] I noticed something extraordinary.  There appeared to be one of those water bugs. [[footnote]] Common name for tardigrades [[/footnote]] I studied the creature; it seems... lifeless. Bored, dead, but I digress. My research has only begun, and I will do my best to update the journal.

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="+Journal Entry #2, January 25th, 18██" hide="-Close"]]

I've checked some of my colleagues' ears out of curiosity of what else might be there. After a lot of convincing, they agreed to try to safely shove the cotton as far as possible into their ear.

[[collapsible show="+Journal Entry #3, January 26th, 18██" hide="-Close"]]

They're everywhere! I've yet to examine one individual who doesn't have the water bear. What are these creatures doing in people's ears? Is this a nest of sorts? A shelter? //How do they feed themselves?// 

[[/collapsible]]


[[collapsible show="+Journal Entry #4, January 27th, 18██" hide="-Close"]]

I've told all of my colleagues about this peculiar organism. All of them are from [REDACTED] University and deny the existence of those creatures. They were telling me that I was just seeing things! I'd think that their work on the peculiar //foundation// would encourage this contentious organism.

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="+Journal Entry #4, January 28th, 18██" hide="-Close"]]

I've decided to check my own ears for these strange creatures. I find it hard to sleep with the idea that these creatures are nesting in my ear.

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="+Journal Entry #5 January 29th, 18██" hide="-Close"]]

I've found them in my ear and tried to remove as many as possible.
 
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="+Journal Entry #6 January 30th, 18██" hide="-Close"]]

I've decided to do a study comparing those with the water bugs and those without them by removing them. It is likely that almost every human has them.

Eureka!~

I've found some extraordinary data from a week long experiment.

I've come to two conclusions:

* The creature increases intelligence and thinking

* The creature affects dreams

Subject 1: A twenty-two year-old-male who has the water bug. He is an intelligent fellow who got 28/30 on the ███████'█ Test.

Subject 2: A thirty-one year old male who doesn't have the water bug (I removed it through[REDACTED]) after removing the bug, they've had problems with sleeping and normal tasks. He scored 9/30 on the ███████'█ Test.

After removing Subject 1's water bug creature, he started to be "less aware" of his dreams. He scored a lower score on the ████'█ Test, a score of 13/30. The test is practically the same as the previous test.

After adding Subject 2's water bug creature back, he started to "be more aware."He said //"things started to make more sense"//. He ended up having several aware dreams in the seven days of testing. He scored a 30/30 on the ████'█ Test.

[[collapsible show="+Journal Entry #8 February 5th, 18██" hide="-Close"]]

I have decided to conduct a test with putting several of them inside a person's ear. I'll collect one hundred of them.

Subject 3: A fifty-one-year-old-male with no preexisting illnesses.

I've put the hundred that I collected in his ear.

**Journal Entry #11 February 30th, 18██**

They are looking for me; they are looking for me, they are looking for me. The bugs, they need to be removed. They haunt your despicable thinking.

**I need to tell the ASCI, they must know, my colleagues, they don't believe me.** //Who is the ASCI anyway?// They are probably riddled with those damned bugs

**Journal Entry #12 February 12th, 18██**

I discovered that somehow I could read people's electronic brain activity by attaching electrodes to the scalp. This will prove useful with the subjects.

**Journal Entry #13 February 14th, 18██**

I kidnapped a random person. I connected his brain to electrodes with several weird creatures. I forgot what they were called. The water bugs. Inside his ear. There was who knew amount inside. My invention which I call the EEG showed humongous amounts of activity. His brain after a few hours went dead, though... I T ' S   T H E   B U  G  S '    F A U L  T

//Note By Researcher Charles: how the hell did this guy invent the EEG ██ years before its creation?//

**Journal Entry #14 February 15th, 18██**

The only way to kill the bug is to kill the host. 

Everyone has the bug.

Everyone is the host.

We are all the bug.

We are all the host.

Humanity is the bug.

Humanity is the host.

The ASCI Foundation is the bug.

The ASCI Foundation is the host.

**Journal Entry #15 February 16th, 18██**

I've disguised and joined the ASCI. I convinced them I found that a species of tardigrades that had anomalous features. I'm going to hide all records of my existence.

The bugs [INCOMPREHENSIBLE] seem to activate the top part of the brain during normal activities. I've done twenty-one tests on people, they've all ended up with the same result... Death.

It's --there-- their fault for having the bugs in the first place [INCOMPREHENSIBLE] at this point it doesn't really matter the bugs exist I guess? I mean, it has been one year (I think?) since the bugs were discovered.

[INCOMPREHENSIBLE]

**Journal Entry #244 March 1st, 18██**

I've noticed something strange... For some reason they've never been in animal's ears. Is it because we are more [cognitively] aware? I haven't told the ASCI Foundation about the bugs messing with dreams. The bugs wait until you're asleep to leech --of off-- off of you.

**Journal Entry #245 May 3rd, 18██**

The ASCI are the only ones capable of killing them all. I've seen their technology.

//I hope that they do not have the same cruel methods that I have//

If you find this, you are probably a part of The Foundation, and to that I say... [DATA EXPUNGED] [sic]
