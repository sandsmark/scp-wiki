+ Work Brief
* A well written story capable of branching out into at least five different story paths, with variables available in each instance.
* An entire site complete with its own unique SCP separate to that of the wiki.
* A cast of interesting and well thought out characters with with to interact with.
* A main character capable of vastly different paths of emotional growth (or lack thereof) depending on the choices made by the player.
* Realistic and //interesting// dialog for said characters. 
* Items and such that can be utilized by the player, again realistically.
* Concept art and Production images to correspond, depict, and well illustrate the story and game.
* A musical score that adds to the atmosphere and general theme of the game.
* All to be programmed via XNA.
