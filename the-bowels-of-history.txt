The intestine of history leads to the bowels of history. 

When matter is impacted, surgical tools are used to physically remove matter. Time doesn't exist. The annals of time are a gastrointestinal tract. A long history of digestion; Absorbing nutrients from matter, slowly, and most of the time unimpeded. A short history of decay; Matter is excreted and waits to again be consumed. This is the true nature of our world, and before reading this it is important to entertain the idea that time does not exist. This text refers to meat and spacetime one in the same.

There is only matter and this body (which is matter itself) which consumes and creates it. The mind of history, the heart of history, the lungs, tongue, pits, groin. Time is meat. Time is a body, but more importantly time is a system which can be diseased, and which can die but cannot be born since it is already alive. We all share this body, and pass through it as we rot. This body is God, or simply truth itself, and it rots as well.

At the end of time rest the bowels of history.

Numbers.

Gerald Peterson, 42, lives in a flat on the lower east side of Chicago, with his dog, a pekignese by the name of "Dart", and his cat, which he chose not to name. It is an outside cat. They all share the same intestine, and essentially sit on the same toilet.

Gertrude Sullivan, 93, lives in a condo by the water in Sarasota. She lives alone, and is visited morning, noon, and dinner by her caretaker. They eat together.

Jackie Silver, 17, lives at a Hopi reservation in Arizona, in a mobile home with their mother, father, and grandparents. They take a mixture of apple vinegar, coconut milk, and cayenne pepper in the morning in place of coffee, which they believe is not healthy.

Trenton Shaw, a surname which was not his but one he adopted in honor of his grandmother, is 20, and rents a room in Santa Cruz. He works at the vegan pizza restaurant next to the pier. He likes a girl there. Sometimes he imagines what life would be like, living with her. He imagines she likes him too, because he is so attractive.

Harold Avery passed away last night, (just this past night) peacefully in his sleep. He is survived by his mother and father, who will not try again.

Terry and Rebecca, each 27, live in Trona, California. Terry works at the chemical plant, near the spires where they filmed he original Planet of the Apes. Rebecca's family lived in Trona for four generations. They had been trying to concieve for four years. Their relationship is strained.

Glass, as he was known by his subordinates, is 43 years old and works as a psychiatrist at a facility in western Pennsylvania. The facility contains a girl. She could potentially cause human extinction if Glass does not do his job well. He has learned not to care.

"Bob" is 3 Sol cycles old and lives on a dead, dark planet orbiting a black hole. Bob eats metals, and absorbs moisture from rocks. He eats others of his species in times of desperation. It doesn't like to talk. The black hole they are orbiting has been around for as long as life has existed on their small planet.

Tess, 24, lives in an alternate universe that is in every way identical to ours. Tess can see the flesh of time all around her. Tess experiences daytime hallucinations. As she walks to work at the call center she runs her hand along Time's length. If she presses hard enough she can feel pressure in her abdomen. If she runs a knife along the Intestine she can see Bob through the wound, peacefully foraging for rocks. If she does this again, she will most likely die.

Miranda, 19, is an immortal who contains a dragon which eats the Earth, and regurgitates the Earth. Quetzacoatl regurgitates Earth, and Earth is shaped like itself twenty years prior. The dragon essentially uses the same toilet as Gerald's feral cat.

Travelling forward and backward through time, charcuterie.

Meat can be made to resemble the future. The future and past are words used to describe the way something looks. Time is a synonym for meat. Spacetime and gravity are special types of meat: Jackfruit. The mesh, the quantum lining, the outer dermis, is thin like breakfast sausage, lamb intestine. Mathematics, numbers, ways we count or measure things, abstract thoughts, are a soft and airy meat, chiccarones. 

The universe is cannabalistic. Our universe, all universes, feed on themselves until there is nothing left, like a man stranded on a mountain, corpses and rocks.

Time travel is ultimately possible, if you have the tools. In order to visit the paleozoic, you need to build it. You can be the dinosaur. You need to sculpt rocks and meat. Or you could reach through the lining and cut through the knot of intestines. This must be done responsibly, and requires talent. But more feasible is altering the time lines of your person. 

How does one do this? Well, You take a knife and... I... cut.

Revelations.

Gerald has learned a lot about meat. Gerald removes his shirt and lays down on his back, on the bed. Gerald has a lot of fat covering the space between his subdermal skin layer and his intestine. Gerald is three hundred and nine pounds, five feet and seven inches tall. Gerald grabs a scalpel and begins to dig. Gerald is numb to pain. Gerald injected himself beforehand. He works at the animal shelter, and has access to a numbing agent. They will notice it is missing, but it will not matter because Gerald will be dead.

Gertrude Sullivan and her caretaker have learned a lot about meat. Gertrude is not interested in the way things were before, but her Caretaker, Judy, is. Gertrude offers to operate on Judy, but Judy isn't sure it will be safe. Gertrude suggests a small incision, but Judy ultimately declines. Judy is sure that she will die. She is right, of course.

Jackie Silver has taught their girlfriend about time. Jackie learned this from a stranger. Jackie says that they should become future together, or at least see if there is any point. Jackie lays back on their girlfriend Brook's bed. Brook takes Jackie's shirt off and makes an incision above Jackie's stomach.

Trenton Shaw has reached his intestine. With morbid fascination he runs his fingers along the exposed length. Trenton makes an incision, and sticks a finger inside. Trenton feels soft, strained breathing on his finger. Trenton is a fast learner, and was already reading at age 8.

Terry and Rebecca...

Rewind.

Miranda raps her fingers and flips through a book. "Mr. Glass" She taps on the reinforced window in her cell. "I am hungry, please. I know it is not noon but I am hungry already."

-

The past moves closer with every incision, every blunt penetration or sloppy cut. I am still writing this, but my legs and wrists are covered in thin red lines, which will not heal properly, and I was born just this past thursday, and my mother is about to give birth, and I am staring back up at the midwife with a razor in my hand, and I am passing through punctured latex, and with every cut on the walls of time, the past moves nearer to me. Eventually the past moves past us; This is not meant to be understood.

The body vomits, and events precede their cause. I cease to exist.

--

Terry and Rebecca walk together, shaped like themselves ten years prior. They are their alternates, which were pulled from out of their bellies. Terry places a hand on Rebecca's stomach where an incision was made, and unmade, reopened, and closed again. They walk past Terry's mother, by the park in Trona, the one where you can see the stalagmites. Her mother faints upon seeing her young and bleeding son. Terry and Rebecca are renditioned the next day by a squad of men in black windowless vans. They are taken to a facility in west Pennsylvania where they speak with

Dr. Glass, a psychiatrist, but also the director of a site that handles humanoid anomalous phenomenon. In turns, they speak to glass nervously behind a one sided mirror. Glass lies to them. He asks them what happened. Glass is unimpressed and indifferent, he orders one of them moved to another secure facility for testing. Terry never sees Rebecca again. Glass sips white tea and clicks on a video. In the video,

Bob signals to Rain that he has found food. He clicks his incisors together excitedly. Bob knows that Rain will not understand, but he knows no signal to convey Time. The white ring of the black hole shimmers dimly. Rain approaches Bob with her head lowered. Bob taps four legs in a rhythmic fasion, he moves back and forth. Rain bares her incisors at Bob. 

Tess digs into her stomach and finds extraterrestrial arachnids in her spacetime.

[[collapsible show="The Annals of Time" hide="Hide"]]

To realize the truth of time, there will be a massive play of preceding events, retrocausal reality, actors with changed shapes and roles, history happening all at once. Time and space. If you cut yourself open, listen, because what I'm saying is the truth. If you cut yourself open, if you, //you//, do it the right way, you can go to a place where time does not exist, the bowels where mouths eat and vomit all at once, much like flies do.

It is simple really. You cut a hole in yourself, then crawl inside, much the same way I do. I can feel the future like it was yesterday.

Tess cuts again, and I see that

The universe is completely full. All of the knots have been opened with a scalpel, they have bled together. The mesh has torn open and all universe and dimension are one. There are no empty spaces, no holes, only bodies. There is ancient man, naked, pressed up against a colony of transhumans, sandwiched between a cluster of rebar concrete slag, something, and so on and it is endless with every scene of history, all at once. 

Glass peers at this strange scene through the end of a wire camera, which is travelling through Terry's small intestine. Glass doesn't know what to make of this, so he calls one of his colleagues. The phone rings at the office of Dr. Mayreder.

"Hey, Virgil," says Glass, a smile slowly forms on his face. "I have a problem with one of the files. Yes. It's your kind of thing." Glass laughs. "I have a problem with it." He spins around in his chair. There is an anomaly with similiar qualities to this one. He thinks he may have a lead. They go through some beauracratic motions and then talk about their favorite show for fourteen minutes. He is wasting his time.

Tess precedes her Grandmother after the final cut. Her great grandfather's first birthday is last Thursday. The past is ahead of her but she remains. Her belly is sutured expertly. She runs to her grandfather and tells him it's her, but his alzheimers gets the better of him, or I simply don't remember. Tess doesn't understand, so she cuts again. She props up her head and he is, to her surprise, making pizza in Santa Cruz. She feels his hands proof the dough. She crawls out of his person while he is in a place where no one can see me.

I do not remember if I am Tess or her grandfather, or if we are all the same body taking different shapes. I think the truth may be the latter.

--

Glass slams an open palm on the table. "This is nonsense!" He shouts. "Send it to someone else. I'm not qualified in this area."

The proctologist operating on Terry turns to Glass. His lips and eyes widen.

"Well it's obvious what's going on here, isn't it? A space time anomaly. It does seem dense on the surface, but the intestine simply leads to another point in space, a wormhole, and time does not exist." The man inhales deeply. "This man, Terry, has toxic shock syndrome."

"//The// intestine. //Time//, absolutely what,"  Glass crosses his arms and looks again at the man angrily. He never recalled seeing me at the site before. "Security!"

I stab myself in the torso, then crawl inside. I vanish. I pucker my lips between a floating crevice of floating fats. "I am shaped like I was never here."

--

I tunnel through the guts of the earth, then slash through the outer dermis in an empty space that looks like Tess. I surface for breath. I remove my grinder from meat space and listen to myself play a sausage song.

The intestine is a form of worm,
And thems just be the breaks.
If you get your teeth all photon small, 
You could chew the poor things like steaks.
If I had a softer space to land,
I wouldn't get the shakes...
But If time is meat and meat is space,
I don't think that will take.

My body aches.

I emerge through the tunnel, bursting out of Tess two years prior. I do not realize I am in a crowded shopping mall, browsing hats. I clumsily stretch myself out of my torso, snapping the ribs outward with a wet crunch. The clerk opens her mouth, catching some blood, and she screams silently for a few brief moments. I wipe offal from my bangs. I am embarrassed. I apologize to the Tess corpse. I turn to the fear frozen woman. I think of all of the people I have crawled out of by this point. But there is no point. I may have always been doing it.

"Hello, my name is Trenton, and I've learned a lot about meat."

I scan the lines of her face and I remember this cashier as an older woman. I've never been her before. Maybe her body has an answer. My eyes crawl over her form with the interest of a veteran addict. If you've done this once you've always done it.

I look around the plaza and see myself burst out of three other bodies in the food court. I look at myselves with frustration and understanding. We have always done it. There are other me crawling in. We are sliding in and out of holes. I crawl back into Tess to make a U-Turn, but suddenly I explode out of my head, and so on, like Russian dolls, or Chinese snakes. Finally the milliipede stops. I catch my breath.

--

I explode out of a pterodactyl, I explode out of a stone head on easter island, I explode out of a godhead, a photon, I explode out of a limited edition Ted Williams San Diegro Padres baseball card. I take a breath, and I look around to see that I have been doing this for a very long time. I look down from a primordial volcano and I spot dozens of my own glassy eyes. We don't show any emotion, this has become routine. I watch as these fools endlessly multiply.

"Stop," I shout down the mountain. They call back to me.

"Stop!"

"Stop!"

"Stop!"

"Stop!"

"Stop!"

"Stop!"

"Stop!"

"Stop!"

"Stop!"

"Stop!"

"Stop!"

"Stop!"

They call back to me infinitely.

The volcano errupts. The earth quakes. The noise buffets the mountain. I crawl into myself before the shape of the sound is too loud. I decide to find a place and time shaped like this never happened. 

The mesh is falling apart. 

I hurry past scabs of terraced skyscrapers, bugs, next to me we are all hurrying, hopefully not to the same space, I think with brief lucidity about the nature of the universe, and if this is what is supposed to happen, and I hurry past more breathing windows and I see void space and screaming television static, I hurry past things I cannot know or cannot describe, I see all of this through the lining of the meat, I hurry until the path ends, and the roof and walls have all ruptured and everything falls together. 

I look around at myself all around me. I cannot move.

I multiply, but there is no room.
