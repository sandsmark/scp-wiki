**Profile:**

Dr. Mackenzie is a special researcher assigned to observe and document SCPs. As such, Dr. Mackenzie's security clearance is Level 3, but limited to specific projects currently being worked on. Dr. Mackenzie is currently assigned to several SCPs that are weapon-based or have significant weaponization potential.

**History:**

Dr. Mackenzie started as a field researcher for the Global Occult Coalition, participating in the destruction of several minor SCPs. Several years ago, Dr. Mackenzie was exposed to a Euclid-class SCP that caused the deaths of several other field agents. While Mackenzie survived, the SCP inflicted Mackenzie's confused gender condition as well as granting Mackenzie improved senses and memory.

Over the next few years, Dr. Mackenzie became increasingly disillusioned with the GOC's mission to destroy all SCPs, and begun protesting the destruction of otherwise Safe SCPs that could have significant benefit to humanity. After being put on probation, Dr. Mackenzie and several colleages were contacted by a Foundation agent with an offer of recruitment.

Dr. Mackenzie was recruited into the Foundation on ██/██/████, along with [DATA EXPUNGED] and █ Safe and Euclid class SCPs pending destruction and smuggled from the GOC. After a long period of psychological screening, polygraph testing, and SCP-level containment, Dr. Mackenzie was finally admitted as a limited researcher and observer for the Foundation.

Dr. Mackenzie does not like to admit that s/he was a member of the GOC, fully realizing the Foundation's distrust of other organizations that deal with SCPs. When asked, Dr. Mackenzie invariably tries to deflect the question, only revealing his/her origin when confronted by superiors with proper authority.

Due to his/her exposure to an unidentified Euclid-class SCP, Dr. Mackenzie exhibits several unusual abilities:

Dr. Mackenzie has enhanced eyesight and hearing, as a result of quantum entanglement exhibited in his/her senses. The effect has been described as being able to see through two sets of eyes and hear from two viewpoints, thus being able to pick up minor details with startling accuracy. The drawback is that humans are not wired to accept this kind of enhanced sensory input, and as a result, concentrating on this ability can result in severe migraines after prolonged use.

The same quantum effects that affects Dr. Mackenzie's senses also applies to his/her body, specifically in being able to identify his/her gender. On a technical level, Dr. Mackenzie is both genders, yet neither at the same time. This effect causes observers to get a "strange feeling" when looking at him/her, as a result of confusion in non-entangled senses. This effect also applies to gender-sensitive SCPs, which behave erratically in Dr. Mackenzie's presence. Dr. Mackenzie has requested to be excluded from experimentation on gender-sensitive SCPs.

Dr. Mackenzie is adamant about his/her refusal to cause disability or death to individuals not already condemned by proper authorities, though Class D personnel generally seem to be enough over the gray line that they are acceptable targets for experimentation for the time being. Despite this personal philosophy, Dr. Mackenzie has found him/herself participating extensively in the testing weaponized and weapon-based SCPs (often times against his/her will), and is proficient in the use of firearms.
