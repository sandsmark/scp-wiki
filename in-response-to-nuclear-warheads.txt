title:In Response To Nuclear Warheads

Good evening ladies and gentleman,
 
I am Director Weld and this is the fourth time that I speak to the committee. I come to you today to propose the abolition of all on-site explosives. Especially regarding those of nuclear nature.
 
As you are all well aware, the Foundation's history with nuclear warheads is a long one. We used them since, well, since they were invented.
 
We did our best to stay out of all these wars, and yet we couldn't help but use the greatest creation for ourselves. And what did we use it for? Threaten our own staff. Nuclear warheads soon became the new method to easily resolve major security breaches. Not a normal bomb, mind you, an atomic bomb.
  
Unfortunately, it took years of hindsight to realize that these warheads contaminate a site with atomic radiation for the next billion years. And do you know what can still thrive in that radioactivity? Anomalies. Well some of them, but I don't have to tell you that some are too much in our line of work.
 
I wasn't there when Site 21 exploded. One of the biggest Keter breaches in our history, followed by the on-call of 5 of our best task forces. What stopped them? Not the Keter, they had it almost in check. What stopped them was the premature decision of someone at that site, that it would be time to bring out the last resort and blow everything up.
 
Now we've got a focal point of anomalies that control a still functioning site and no human can contain them, because they'd die if they entered.
 
And I know at most sites we do not use nuclear warheads anymore, but that's not because of the things I just said. They are only out of use because of the veil breaking that these explosions cause. It is a bit difficult to hide a radioactive cloud that travels through multiple continents before dissolving.
 
At least the new explosives are able to remove a site without making a single sound outside its scope and don't leave a huge, never usable again, crater. Incidentally, locations in more remote locations are still dependent on atomic bombs.
 
But do you know what really bothered me about Site 21? It's not the radioactivity it spread or the abomination it now houses, it is the fact that we lost 5 of our best task forces to that explosion. 5 task forces we could have needed that year. 5 task forces filled with young enthusiasts who could have served the foundation for a whole lifetime.
 
And if those soldiers were still alive, they could have prevented a lot more of the "last resorts" that we had to use.
 
Now since I am speaking to the Ethics Committee here, I also want to note that knowing that you are working under the watchful eye of a bomb that could explode any minute does not help your productivity.
 
I also honestly never understood the argument that these explosives are our best bets against raids. Is it not the point of stopping a raid to not lose the objects and people we're housing? And surely a raid was never that extreme that it would be worth it to eradicate all personnel and other anomalies with them?
 
Now tell me: Who here knows one anomaly that breached containment that could have been neutralized by a nuke.
 
Yes, not that surprising.
 
Now tell me again: Which of those couldn't have been neutralized by a gunshot at the right time?
 
I thought as much.
 
Now if you don't take anything else away from today at least promise me, that you will stand against the council's decision to arm my department and other Foundation Fronts with On-Site-Explosives. I don't think the explained anomalies I house are a danger to anyone. And while the Foundation may not publicly exist we Fronts will take consequences.
 
We have many good Soldiers who trained their entire life to prevent breaches. Triggering a Bomb is just the easy way out and a dishonor to their jobs.
 
We don't have to die in the dark,
Thank you for your time.

And if the alternative is a Keter on the loose, causing a potential K-Class, or an anomaly in the wrong hand, you'll know what has to be done. Thankfully the last resort of any on-site explosive is just that, the last resort.//
