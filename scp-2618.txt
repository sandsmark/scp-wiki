**Item #:** SCP-2618

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**  
SCP-2618 and replicas must be kept in locker [[span style="background-color: black; color: black"]]62[[/span]] at Site-76. Personnel experimenting with SCP-2618 must be given mandatory psychological exams before and after use. If necessary, repeated users of SCP-2618 must ingest 80 mg of sertraline daily.


**Description:**
SCP-2618 is a wand-like electronic stylus fashioned from a small radio antenna, a wrist calculator, and what appears to be a toy spaceship. SCP-2618 can be used as a translocation device, though it is sensitive and often inaccurate. Typing a number into SCP-2618's calculator determines the distance in meters from the user to a target location, while direction is determined by aiming the antenna. Other than the primary activation controls, SCP-2618 has two dials and 5 buttons of unknown utility. Interrogation suggests that SCP-2618-1 had not used these controls prior to arrival at the Foundation, and was unsure of their purpose.


Testing has shown that repeated usage of SCP-2618 for transportation disrupts electrical signals in the nervous system, causing hypersensitivity and other neurological disorders over time. Tests have revealed electrical pulses radiating from SCP-2618 during use, most of which range from 100 mV to 3 V of electricity.

Dismantling of SCP-2618 revealed electrical components containing shards of blue pectolite. Chemical composition resembled that of pectolite obtained from ████ in the Dominican Republic, though no anomalies were detected. Reconstruction of SCP-2618 was successful. Constructed replicas of SCP-2618 showed no signs of anomaly.

**Experiment log SCP-2618-01:**
(note that only relevant experiments as to the nature of SCP-2618 are shown)
> Experiment SCP-2618-02
> Subject: D-030482-38
> Procedure: Typed '20' into SCP-2618 and hit activation button while pointing SCP-2618 across the hall.
> Result: D-030482-38 appeared approximately 20 meters along the line SCP-2618 had been aimed.
> 
> Experiment SCP-2618-03
> Subject: D-20382
> Procedure: typed '5' then typed '=.'
> Result: Calculator screen read '5.'
> Note: //SCP-2618 may still work as a calculator.//
> 
> Experiment SCP-2618-05
> Subject: D-20382
> Procedure: typed '5÷0=' 
> Result: SCP-2618 attempted to create 5 duplicates of itself, all of which emitted a high pitched screech before disintegrating. D-20382 suffered mild radiation burns and was sent to Site-76's medical facility for treatment. Shortly after recovery, D-20382 displayed signs of acute paranoia, irritability, and reacted negatively to all tactile stimuli.
> Note: //The calculator appears to have a programmed method of attempting to solve any input equation. It may be good that this calculator can't be told to find the square root of a negative number.//
> 
> Experiment SCP-2618-08
> Subject: D-554-036
> Procedure: Type '10' into SCP-2618 while aiming at D-3902-45, exactly 10 meters away. 
> Result: D-554-036 ignored instructions and attempted to escape using SCP-2618. D-554-036 found dead just outside Building ██. Cause of death determined to be blunt impact trauma. On-site witnesses claimed to have seen D-554-036 appear in the sky before falling to his death.
> 
> Experiment SCP-2618-09
> Subject: D-555-037
> Procedure: Type '10' into SCP-2618 while aiming at D-3902-46, exactly 10 meters away. 
> Result: [DATA EXPUNGED]

Information from interview 2618-1-03 has brought new insight into possible effects of power supply increases on SCP-2618.

> 
> Experiment SCP-2618-10
> Subject: D-231979
> Procedure: Replace batteries in compartment with a simple single phase rectifier connected to AC power supply. Plug into outlet and repeat procedure as in Experiment 02.
> Result: Extension cord severely warped and severed. D-231979 was likewise [REDACTED] and immediately terminated.
> Note: //"If you're going to increase the device's power supply, remember, this thing is supposed to be portable. It's gonna disconnect itself if you plug it in. We weren't completely certain it would sever the cord mid-warp, but now that that's clear, I recommend that any further experiments in increasing the power supply of SCP-2618 find more portable methods. Nobody wants to clean up a mess like that again."// -Dr.████
> 
> Experiment SCP-2618-11
> Subject: D-30291
> Procedure: Replace outlet cord with large portable power supply, repeat as with Experiment 02
> Result: D-30291, along with SCP-2618, disappeared for approximately 2.5 hours before reappearing, approximately 20 meters from where they had last been seen. D-30291 has refused to give information as to what occurred during the 153 minutes they were missing.
> 
> Experiment SCP-2618-13
> Subject: D-30291
> Procedure: Increase voltage input to SCP-2618 to 30 V. Repeat as with Experiment 02.
> Result: D-30291, along with SCP-2618, disappeared for approximately 30 hours before SCP-2618 reappeared on-site. Several days later, D-30291 reappeared with burns, holding a duplicate of SCP-2618. D-30291 entered a vegetative state and the duplicate ignited. SCP-2618 was unable to function until D-30291 returned.

**Item #:** SCP-2618-1

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- presumed Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** 
[[collapsible show="Archived Containment Procedures as of Incident 2618-07" hide="Close Archive"]]
> //SCP-2618-1 is to be contained at Site-17 in a standard humanoid cell with 24/7 video surveillance.  SCP-2618-1 is not allowed access to SCP-2618 under any circumstance except under testing conditions. A log is to be kept of all noteworthy interactions between SCP-2618-1 and personnel.//
> 
> //Personnel in proximity to SCP-2618-1 must not carry loose items, especially access cards, as several items have been reported missing after close-contact with SCP-2618-1. Routine bi-weekly sweeps of SCP-2618-1's cell and belongings are to be conducted to locate any communication devices or lost property it may have in its possessions.//

**Description:** SCP-2618-1 is a young adult female with long, dark-brown hair, appearing to be of Mediterranean descent. It is suspected to suffer from several acute anxiety disorders, particularly hypersensitivity. SCP-2618-1 is believed to have created SCP-2618, though it has not confirmed this. Foundation personnel have described SCP-2618-1 as extroverted and easily distracted when not in a state of mental or emotional distress.
  
SCP-2618-1 was apprehended on the premises of Site-██ for unauthorized entry, and was sent to Site-17 for containment after attempting to use SCP-2618 to flee from Site-██ security personnel. Interrogation revealed SCP-2618-1 had limited knowledge of the Foundation and its activities. SCP-2618-1 claimed to originate from a parallel universe and claimed to have appeared at Site-██ due to an error in transdimensional travel calculations. It handed SCP-2618 over to staff, though it asked for them to return it as soon as they were "done with it." 

It has asked staff if they have fixed [SCP-2618] on several occasions, implying that it may believe researchers to be repairing it as opposed to studying it. However, SCP-2618 does not appear to be damaged. SCP-2618-1 has not stated any other use of SCP-2618 besides its teleportation function. 

**Addendum 1**


[[collapsible show="Excerpt from Interview Log SCP-2618-1-02" hide="close report"]]
>**Begin Log**
> 
> //Dr. Eddleston:// "Could you describe to me the series of events leading up to your appearance at Site-██?"
> 
> //SCP-2618-1:// "You people know about the multiverse, right?"
> 
> //Dr. Eddleston:// "We have a department that studies that, yes."
> 
> //SCP-2618-1:// "I'm from there. Well, not //from// there, but not from here.... I think what I'm trying to say is that I'm from a different universe than this place."
> 
> //Dr. Eddleston:// "And how is this universe you're from different than ours? Or is it difficult to say?"
> 
> //SCP-2618-1:// "I, well, I've been to a lot of places. Where I'm from, unusual things aren't usually kept secret I guess? There's some other things too...but, like, mostly that."
> 
> //Dr. Eddleston:// "How does the public handle information on these anomalies?" 
> 
> //SCP-2618-1:// "Eh, they usually don't believe them, and the dangerous ones are usually destroyed. One of my friends from another universe warped in front of this crowd and started ranting. People where I'm from don't really get the whole //multiverse// concept, so it freaked the hell out of them. Some local companies shrugged it off as a publicity stunt, and almost everyone's forgotten it even happened."
> 
> //Dr. Eddleston:// "In other words, the majority of the public believes these anomalies to be hoaxes?"
> 
> //SCP-2618-1:// "Pretty much, yeah."
> 
> //Dr. Eddleston:// "If most people in your universe are unaware that other universes are accessible, how did you come by interdimensional methods of transport?"
> 
> //SCP-2618-1:// "That's a long story. Kinda multiple stories, too..."
> 
> //Dr. Eddleston:// "If you don't mind, could you please share this information with us?"
> 
> //SCP-2618-1:// "It's complicated...but, like, multiverse stuff always is. I wouldn't know where to start exactly, but basically some people from other universes decided they needed me to do something for them. Still not completely sure why //me//, but it had to be someone, I guess. They kept trying to contact me, but in weird ways that didn't make any sense. Then one of them decided to just take me to his universe to get this thing done already. Then like, a bunch of other stuff happened and I sorta fucked up some timelines accidentally and made some friends in some other universes. Now I'm part of this research group that studies the multiverse, and someone thought it would be good for me to go learn about this place here.
> 
> //Dr. Eddleston:// "By here, do you mean the SCP Foundation?"
> 
> //SCP-2618-1:// "Well, I guess, yeah. Some other stuff in this universe too. But I wanted to learn about you guys first. See, me and others I work with do a lot of universe-hopping. Like, we'll go scout out, sometimes experiment with, universes to study them."
> 
> //Dr. Eddleston:// "And the universe we are in right now is one of the universes you are currently researching? What makes this universe unique compared to others you have studied?"
> 
> //SCP-2618-1:// "Well, I haven't been here very long, and most of the time I've spent here is in this nicely furnished box. I could probably say how it's different if I got some more information from you guys. We could like, talk about our universes and stuff in detail. I can tell you about the group I work for, and you guys can tell me about these Ess-See-Pee thingies you guys do stuff with."
> 
> //Dr. Eddleston:// "I'm afraid much of our work is confidential. We may be able to work out some sort of arrangement, but I'm afraid we cannot give you information on much of what we do here."
> 
> //SCP-2618-1:// "Oh, you guys have one of those confidentiality agreement things? I had lots of jobs with that. I took some really cool pictures of some of the creatures I worked with and people online thought they were super cute! And you wouldn't believe what I did with [REDACTED]!"
[[/collapsible]]

In order to receive important information from SCP-2618-1, several false documents have been prepared for exchange of information. Regardless of intent, SCP-2618-1 does not appear to have a firm grasp on the concept of confidentiality, thus it is imperative that information shared with SCP-2618-1 is inaccurate. New forms of informational exchange may be proposed by researchers working with SCP-2618-1, provided it does not involve any danger to informational security or threat of containment breach.

> //Dr. Eddleston:// "May we talk about your teleportation device? If you can, how it works?"
> 
> //SCP-2618-1://  "The stylus? Well, I'm pretty sure it has to do with the little larimar pieces."
> 
> //Dr. Eddleston://  "The pectolite shards?"
> 
> //SCP-2618-1://  "Yeah, each one's from a different universe, so with an electric current, they become unstable and attempt to return to their universe of origin. With enough of them arranged correctly, they can create small, wormholeish things. Well, not really like wormholes I guess, not gravity. I think people call them gopherholes, since you can go wherever, like....a gopher I guess. Some devices can make all sorts of warp openings, but the one I have only works in straight lines."
> 
> //Dr. Eddleston:// "And this is the device you used to enter Site-██, correct?
> 
> //SCP-2618-1:// "Yeah."
> 
> //Dr. Eddleston:// "Is it capable of transporting a user into an alternate universe, or did you use other technology to get to the universe we are in now?"
> 
> //SCP-2618-1:// "If it had enough power it probably could, but I used something else. There's some better stuff at home that can do that. Now that I think about it, I probably should've waited till I got one of the better ones fixed. Probably wouldn't be stuck here...not that it's, like //bad// here, but it's, well, kinda boring spending all this time in this cell..."

> //█████, a security guard tasked with delivering food to SCP-2618-1's cell, finds SCP-2618-1 hyperventilating in the corner of the room. After determining the situation to be non-threatening, █████ attempts to converse with SCP-2618-1//
> //█████:// "Are you alright?"
> 
> //SCP-2618-1:// "Er, yes. Sorry, I don't like being bored."
> 
> //SCP-2618-1 appeared to have raised blemishes on upper arms and calves, some of which were bleeding slightly.//
> 
> //█████:// "Are you hurt?"
>  
> //SCP-2618-1:// "What? No, I, well, they were ingrown! I can't go around with hairs hiding under the skin like that!"
> 
> //█████:// "Miss, do you know what dermatillomania is?"
>  
> //SCP-2618-1:// "I...yes. I probably need bandages... and something to do."
> 
> //SCP-2618-1 emits a distressed sound and curls up onto the containment chamber bed. It begins to emit intermittent hissing noises.//
> 
> //SCP-2618-1// "A WASTE! [indistinguishable] Bored. Bored. Skin. Feeling. Need feeling. Stay in self. Need to go. Get bandage. Something interesting. ...interesting bandage?"
> 
> //SCP-2618-1 suddenly becomes lucid and turns to █████.//
> 
> //SCP-2618-1:// "Sorry. Could I get a bandage? Maybe some meds or something too? [Indistinguishable] "I'm not feeling too good. Like, brain sick. Could you get like some paper or something I can doodle on too? It's incredibly boring in here."

█████ reported incident to Dr. Eddleston. Investigation into the nature of the 'meds' mentioned by SCP-2618-1 revealed information on an antidepressant similar in chemical structure and effect to sertraline. SCP-2618-1 claimed the drug to be an effective suppressant of the symptoms of what it referred to as "warp-fever."

//"SCP-2618-1 has continued to show signs of emotional deterioration even under medical treatment. Researchers and security personnel have reported that SCP-2618-1 has been talking to herself. I will be looking into this personally, as it may be possible that this isn't simply a neurological symptom. If it turns out she's communicating with someone, we're going to have some issues.//"-Dr. Eddleston

Transcript of Audio feed, dated 06/1█/20██:

> **SCP-2618-1:** //Listen, I don't know what you people are up to, but this is a crisis. [pause] Why? Why are you too busy to deal with this? [pause] Why do you think things are more chaotic when [indistinguishable]? [pause] I don't care if there're issues, get me over there. Preferably, I don't know, now? [pause] …. can't do that. The people here'll have issues with that. [pause] A minute? and how long'll it take to make? [pause] [indistinguishable] [pause] Do it. Give your guys a break and reset it. I don't want to stay here longer. [pause] You have like, maybe a couple millisecs. [pause] I don't know, 24 fps maybe, hopefully not much more. [pause] [indistinguishable].//

Audio recordings have given reason to suspect communication between SCP-2618-1 and other parties, instigating several searches of SCP-2618-1's cell for communication devices. No devices have been uncovered, though several missing items from researchers were found, primarily writing implements and jewelry. SCP-2618-1 claimed to be unaware that the missing items were in its possession. 


> Security footage 06/██/20██ █:██ am:
> 
> //SCP-2618-1 appeared to be in a positive emotional state, and appeared to be relatively stable.//
> 
> //SCP-2618-1 reacts to an unidentified stimulus, presumed auditory. It transcribes a note onto a sheet of paper, then stands and walks to the center of the cell. It stands still for approximately 2 minutes before suddenly collapsing.//

Incident SCP-2618-07, dated 06/██/20██:
A nearby security guard was alerted of SCP-2618-1's collapse and sent to investigate, finding SCP-2618-1's body on the cell floor. No life signs were detected, and initial inspection suggested a negative response to medication or a result of "warp-fever." Autopsy found no evident cause of death, though it found evidence of unrelated non-threatening diseases.[[footnote]] //"We couldn't find signs of an underlying neurological problem, and what we've found implies that the brain just decided to quit. Everything looks relatively healthy."// -Dr. R. Mallec [[/footnote]] 

The following message, written on a scrap of paper, was found on the floor of SCP-2618-1's cell. A copy has been sent to the cryptology department for analysis:

[[=]]
> #ϟ0+93K<
[[/=]]
[[html]]
<!-- GumXYVLMzlw -->
[[/html]]

Analysis of security footage revealed several anomalies which suggested the footage may have been edited live. Calculations suggested the recording was missing several frames, three of which were around the point SCP-2618-1 began to fall. Though this difference was undetectable to the naked eye, slowed playback revealed a semi-transparent image of SCP-2618-1 directly prior to collapse and jagged movement in the 4 following frames.

As of Incident 2618-07, Site-17 personnel must report any suspected sighting of SCP-2618-1 in the possibility that SCP-2618-1 is not deceased.
