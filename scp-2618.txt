**Item #:** SCP-2618

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The five known trees that produce SCP-2618 are to be kept in an open-air arboreal habitat of Site-59. To minimize risk of a Hubris Event, watering and other maintenance operations of the trees are to be carried out through automated systems. 

**Description:** SCP-2618 is a banana cultivar that originated from the former French colony of █████ ██████████. In appearance and genetic makeup, SCP-2618 is indistinguishable from the common Cavendish banana. 

SCP-2618's anomalous effects surface when a human subject makes visual contact with an individual SCP-2618 fruit. The subject will invariably perceive the banana to be an item the subject needs to accomplish a future or pre-existing goal. This has been designated a "Hubris Event". 

The perception can only be broken through the following means:
# A different human subject will remind the affected subject that SCP-2618 is a banana.
# The affected subject attempts to use SCP-2618 as they had originally intended.

SCP-2618 first came to the attention of the Foundation after a failed assassination attempt of United States Senator ████████ ███ on 12/20/██. A radical animal rights activist named Kevin Jarvis had charged the stage at a campaign rally and attempted to shoot the senator point-blank, only to discover that his pistol was actually an instance of SCP-2618. While major news outlets gave a cover story of the attack being an unusual prank, a 40-page manifesto was discovered in Mr. Jarvis's apartment detailing his desire to assassinate the Senator in retaliation for his alleged track record of animal cruelty.

**Addendum - Incident 2618-████:** On 4/19/██, during the initial containment efforts of SCP-2618, Site-59 experienced multiple containment breaches by SCP-████, a Keter-class amphibian entity. After several unintentional Hubris Events on the part security staff, SCP-████ has been designated uncontained and reclamation efforts are underway.
