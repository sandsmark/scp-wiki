**Item #:** SCP-277

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-277 is a moderately populated town in ████, █████, hereafter referred to as Area I-4. Due to difficulties involving containment, Area I-4 has been placed under a Level-█ lockdown. Civilians are aware of Foundation presence as well as our moderation of their activities, and have proven to be surprisingly compliant. This may or may not be an aspect of the mental effect of long-term residency within Area I-4. Unauthorized civilian attempts to contact individuals outside of Area I-4 are highly uncommon. Security breaches are virtually nonexistent. Personnel must undergo psychological screening before being assigned to moderate Area I-4.

**Description:** The principle anomaly within SCP-277 are apparitions found throughout Area I-4 that seem to be images projected from children’s’ thoughts, or imagination. These are collectively referred to as SCP-277-1. Incidents of SCP-277-1 appear as figures ‘drawn’ in white outlines, with no physical substantiality of their own. The size, ‘style’ in which they are ‘drawn,’ and the complexity of the projections vary from child to child. Pre-pubescent children are the only individuals capable of producing such incidents, and the process of projecting one seems for the most part to be unconscious and involuntary. An average of ███ incidents of SCP-277-1 are present at any given time within the Area; for a largely comprehensive catalogue of pre-pubescents and the designation of their projections may be found in Document 277-██. Incidences of SCP-277-1 are capable of interacting with each other, although physical objects pass through leaving no damage to either party. Children frequently play with their projections, and the existence of SCP-277-1 is regarded as normal by residents of the town.

Civilians in Area I-4 claim that the projections have been present within the town since its colonization. This claim is dubious at most, as there are no records of the Area’s existence before the year 2███, and the towns immediately surrounding the Area deny any knowledge of the city. Testing of members within Area I-4 revealed that their dental, fingerprint, and DNA records correspond with individuals that have been reported missing from their respective countries for over █ years. When under questioning, civilians denied having memories of living or travelling anywhere but within Area I-4. Thorough examinations have uncovered no anomalous psychological or physical qualities in residents of the Area other than, on average, a [DATA EXPUNGED] disposition.

> **OPERATION 277-██████ UPDATE THE FIRST:** Attempt #█ to evacuate Area I-4 has commenced on 6/15/██. Small changes were made to the previously detailed methods of evacuation, namely [EXPUNGED] in hopes of avoiding what may have caused previous failures. Documents outlining past attempts to remove civilians from Area I-4 may be found at [DATA EXPUNGED]. Residents continue to deny any memory of previous evacuation attempts. Personnel members involved in previous assignments involving the suppression of SCP-277-1 and SCP-277-1-█R in particular seem to have been [REDACTED] more trained personnel and Class-D subjects are requested along with the necessary medical equipment in the event of another such incident.
> **OPERATION 277-██████ UPDATE THE SECOND:** As of 6/23/██, Operation 277-██████ has proven unsuccessful due to [DATA CORRUPTED]. No further evacuation attempts are to be carried out. Level-█ Lockdown suggested. 
> -Dr. R█████

Foundation personnel have been unable to trace the source of File Operation 277-██████. Foundation databanks have been unable to produce an unexpunged copy of the file. No personnel or civilians in Area I-4 are able to recall any attempts made to evacuate Area I-4, and the legitimacy of the file has been called into question multiple times. As per common consensus, however, no further evacuation efforts have been planned. Furthermore, it has been discovered that when a resident of Area I-4 leaves the Area for over ██ minutes, they are violently [REDACTED] and then may be found within Area I-4 with no memory of departing from the Area.

**Addendum 277-A:** 
As of 9/14/██, an unaccounted-for SCP-277-1 was photographed in Area I-4’s local library by a Foundation Agent. While this would not normally be in itself an unusual occurrence, as all of the Area’s children’s projections have yet to be catalogued and designated, the nature of the apparition in question was alarming to the overseeing Agent. No one in the vincity claimed to be responsible for the projection. As the appearance and actions of incidents of SCP-277-1 are often telling of a child’s psychological profile, efforts are being taken to identify the owner of these projections, designated SCP-277-1-R█. Projections that match the image shown in ‘drawing’ style or behavior are to be reported immediately.

**Addendum 277-B:** 
Sightings of projections that are similar to SCP-277-██ have tripled in frequency since 9/23/██. On 10/5/██, there were ██ child casualties. See Interview 277-A for details.

**Addendum 277-C:**
> Inquiries made to civilians regarding the incident on 10/5/██ have returned with mixed results. A number of the residents claim that they had never witnessed such an occurrence before and expressed desire for Foundation officials to quickly identify and persecute the perpetrator. Others claim that similar events happen periodically every █ years. 
> Personnel staffing Area I-4 have expressed discomfort when dealing with members of the town. Frankly, I have to agree when they say that something is not quite right about this place. Prior to when the attacks were made, things here have been eerily perfect. Like an episode of Leave it to Beaver or whatnot. Yesterday I was talking to one of the residents here and he mentioned that events like the incident on the fifth have been going on for as long as he could remember, and that it was a fair price to pay, as the town needed sustenance to continue being "perfect." Utopian. That’s the word he used to describe it. By his tone, he could've been talking about the weather. They all smile too wide.
> My theory is that the people here [REDACTED]
> -Agent J███

**Addendum 277-D:** An unaccounted for child, Bradley R███, age █ has claimed ownership of SCP-277-1-R█ and the attacks made as of 10/13/██. The subject has tested to be highly psychopathic. The interview may be found below.

> **Interviewed:** **Bradley R███:** 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. J██████
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Dr. J██████:** Hello, Bradley.
> 
> **Bradley R███:** Hello, sir.
> 
> **Dr. J██████:** Do you know why you have been brought here?
> 
> **Bradley R███:** Yes. It’s because my sketches and I are responsible for the incident on October the fifth in which a large number of children were attacked.
> 
> **Dr. J██████:** And what made you decide to do this?
> 
> **Bradley R███:** I don’t know.
> 
> **Dr. J██████:** …are you sure that’s the answer you want to give? Did you have any previous resentments, grudges, or such against the others?
> 
> **Bradley R███:** They made fun of me. I spend a lot of my time alone, and I guess I got mad.
> 
> **Dr. J██████:** Did you consciously make your projections to act as they did? 
> 
> **Bradley R███:** (Subject nods.)
> 
> **Dr. J██████:** Do you regret your actions at all, then?
> 
> **Bradley R███:** No. 
> 
> **Dr. J██████:** …very well, then. You may go.
> 
> **Bradley R███:** Thank you. (Subject stands to leave, then leans forward and speaks quietly to Dr. J███.) I don’t really mean it, don’t actually believe me, he’s telling me to say it. He’s the one making me say it, he’s the one who does all of it for nourishment but I’m not supposed to tell. (Subject straightens again and resumes speaking in a normal tone of voice.) Goodbye, sir.
> **<End Log>**

**Addendum 277-E:** Bradley R███ entered a coma while sleeping the night following his interview and has showed no signs of recovery. Foundation officials stationed in Area I-4 anticipate further developments.
