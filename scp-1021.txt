**Item #:** SCP-1021

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** No special containment procedures needed at this time. All instances of SCP-1021 are currently in use in various sites and facilities. For complete list, see addendum.

**Description:** SCP-1021 is a set of 7 EXIT signs designed in Art Modern dating back to the 1940's. The anomalous effect of SCP-1021 will only manifest if it is placed directly overhead a door made of solid wood; type and design may vary, but the door must be solid with no trappings such as a window. Any person opening a door with SCP-1021 placed overhead will find themselves exiting out of a corresponding exit of the ███████ Cinema in █████, MI. Each sign of SCP-1021 belongs to a specific door in the cinema, with the main entrance being the only door without a connection. 

SCP-1021 was discovered when a self described architect buff visited the ███████ Cinema before its demolition in order to study its design, and find a souvenir. According to the witness, the only thing left was a box of exit signs by the main entrance labeled "dump". Enamored by their old style design he claimed to liberate one for his own use at home, adorning his bathroom door as a joke. Upon entering his bathroom he found himself behind the ███████ Cinema exiting from the delivery entrance. The subsequent internet postings were found by Foundation computer search algorithms, and an agent was dispatched to investigate. Upon learning the story and viewing its use himself, the agent called for backup to the cinema where it was purchased by the Foundation through the Scenic Cultural Places association (An organization dedicated to buying and restoring old unusual buildings). After administering a class B amnesiac to the witness, all the exit signs were taken and through study, were found to correspond to a door within the ███████ Cinema. The cinema itself has no history of unusual occurrences, though a small security detail are to remain for 1 month and secure the building.

Due to its Safe status both in Class and function, all instances of SCP-1021 have been set up in various Foundation sites to act as an emergency evacuation exit. The ███████ Cinema has been renovated to act as an evacuation command area where Foundation staff may seek refuge in times of peril. The evacuation points in all sites must be kept in a clear area under guard by level 3 security staff, in order to prevent its misuse as a method of smuggling SCP's out of their home sites.
