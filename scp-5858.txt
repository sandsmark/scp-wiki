**Item #:** SCP-5858

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5858 is physically self-contained, but requires active censorship. All outbound communication from the town of Ambler will be screened, and revised by Site-24 AI //DONA//. Individuals made aware of SCP-5858 will be given Class-A amnesics. 

Personnel must strictly adhere to their role when entering this Locked Scenario[[footnote]] For more information on Locked Scenarios, see Except-LS below.[[/footnote]]. When asked to leave SCP-5858, personnel should do so as quickly and courteously as possible. Under no circumstance may anyone enter SCP-5858 posing as theater staff.

**Description:** SCP-5858 the Ambler Theater, located in the borough of Ambler, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. In 2018, this playhouse spontaneously entered a IO-Locked Scenario, and has since continued presenting "A Streetcar Named Desire" for 17,520 consecutive hours.

> **A Locked Scenario (LS)** occurs when an event, incident, or sequence of actions is anomalously extended past its logical expiration. These phenomena should not be confused with **Temporal Loops (TL)**, which create brackets of repeating time - Locked Scenarios merely repeat the event itself as time progresses. To achieve this effect, an LS will often alter human perception, along with any number of core scientific principals. Often mischaracterized as "hauntings" or "curses", some examples of Locked Scenarios in the Foundation database include [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-112 SCP-112],  [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4382 SCP-4382], and [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1337 SCP-1337]. As each of these documents demonstrate, Locked Scenarios can be incredibly dangerous, and require proper understanding for their safe containment and/or resolution. 
> 
> An LS will operate under two set variables: //Protracted vs. Indefinite//, and //Static vs. Organic.// 
> 
> * **A Protracted LS (P-LS)** will eventually self-terminate.
> * **An Indefinite LS (I-LS)** will be self-sustaining.
> 
> High-sensitivity Kant Counters can be used to tell these phenomena apart. The more common P-LS will show a gradual decline in Hume levels, culminating in a total field collapse or "burnout". An I-LS will show steady, or bare fluctuations in Hume levels, and will always require some form of external resolution.
> 
> * **A Static LS (S-LS)** will only repeat a sequence of events.
> * **An Organic LS (O-LS)** will "progress" within it's own set confines.
> 
> Consider this separation in terms of a baseball game. In an S-LS, the game will repeat it's nine innings over and over. In an O-LS, the game will continue into a 10th inning and beyond, with the score progressively increasing. Combining these factors, a Locked Scenario can be interchangeably characterized as PO-LS, or IS-LS, etc.

There are 87 individuals affected by SCP-5858 directly, including the actors, director, stage hands, and audience members. All other residents of Ambler have been passively affected by this anomaly, believing the unnatural duration of the performance is completely unremarkable[[footnote]] "Oh yes, of course I miss my husband. He's had to skip our daughters birthday twice now! Still, that play must be spectacular." -Marsha Kieth, 2020. [[/footnote]].

SCP-5858-1 through --13-- 14 are the staff of the Ambler Theater, uniquely affected by the Locked Scenario. SCP-5858-1 are easily identified by their red shirts, black vests, and perpetual full-body vibrations - visually resembling hummingbird wings in motion. All instances of SCP-5858-1 have expressed enhanced speed, strength, and spacial awareness, operating at roughly 5 times that of baseline human capacity. While staff members will continue to perform their routine duties, albeit at a faster pace, their primary purpose is to act as Locked Scenario "maintenance", aggressively preventing all outside interference.

To date, no test subject has has managed to remain inside the theater for more than an 3 hours before being ejected for some form of infraction.

**Addendum -  15/02/2020 | 3:10PM:** All anomalous activity in Ambler abruptly ceases. Friends and family of those within SCP-5858 begin panicking. At the same time, the doors to SCP-5858 open, and people begin to exit. Many collapse into the street, openly weep, or stumble around catatonic. All members of Xi-5 report in safe.

**Addendum -  15/02/2020 | 3:16PM:** The last three audience members exit the theater. A young boy is seen standing between a man and a woman, holding both their hands. The trio walk down the town's main street until reaching the first intersection. They embrace, then walk a short distance in separate directions before vanishing.

**Addendum - Site-24 | Director Morgan:** Reclassification to Neutralized pending.

> **Xi-5-2|Higashi:** No ma'am, no defense. This might end up hurting me, actually, but I don't care. I want you to know I don't regret it. A young man in that kind of situation... he needs someone to reach out. He needs to know it's going to be alright. If I could do it all over again, I wouldn't do it any differently.
