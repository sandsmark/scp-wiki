We, the **S**ociety of **A**theists for the **P**rotection from **P**erilous and **H**indering **I**nstitutionalized **R**eligions **E**verywhere, hold all groups, leaders, practitioners, and followers of the occult accountable for the following actions:

* Purposeful delay in the advancement of sciences;
* Withholding of universal truths and facts from the masses;
* Persecution of innocents;
* Intervention in conflicts, elections, and governments worldwide;
* Destruction of knowledge critical to the advancement of mankind;
* Collusion; and
* Tax Evasion.

Know now, blind sheep, that we seek recompense for the injustices laid before us. SAPPHIRE shines brighter than any imaginary God and is more powerful than any Tolkien spell one could conjure.

= //God was a mistake of Man, one which [[[saphir-centre|SAPPHIRE]]] will correct.//

For too long has mankind suffered under the iron grip of those who claim to hear the whispers of a non-existent man in the sky. The United Nations has failed us and the people of the world, allowing so-called 'wizards' and 'ESPers' into their fold. The Foundation is content to merely sit on that which they collect: they have no interest in uncovering what lies beyond the masquerade of their 'anomalies'.

The world is not one of magic; it is one of logic, science, reason, and facts. These are truths those of us //in the know// hold dear, the same truths which we shall impart upon the world. Our time has come to burn the false idols.
