> **Phenylalanine:** so baisically you just need to work on your shadding
> **blusepth:** okay
> **Phenylalanine:** hey coolguy, welcome to postphenom. you're new here right?
> **CoolGuy95:** Hello people. I'm new. 
> **jorgumander:** ASK HIM THE QUESTIONS!
> **blusepth:** ASK! ASK!
> **CoolGuy95:** questions?
> **Phenylalanine:** 1. WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE PIECE OF POST-PHENOM ART?
> **Phenylalanine:** 2. HAVE YOU EVER CREATED ANY POST-PHENOM ART YOURSELF?
> **Phenylalanine:** 3. HOW DID YOU FIND US?
> **CoolGuy95:** I would say Stendhal's Nightmare.
> **CoolGuy95:** No, and a friend of mine mentioned you guys. 
> **blusepth:** Who?
> **CoolGuy95:** She said her username is autotrophic or something like that.
> **Phenylalanine:** Ah, you're with autotrophia. She's cool. 
> **Phenylalanine:** Well, the initiation is complete. your free to go
> **blusepth:** ONE OF US.
> **jackomundo:** ONE OF US.
> **CoolGuy95:** So you guys are Are We Cool Yet?, right?
> **blusepth:** ah hell noes
> **jackomundo:** nope
> **Phenylalanine:** No
> **CoolGuy95:** but, I thought you guys did post-phenomenological art?
> **jackomundo:** well yes
> **CoolGuy95:** i thought that was kind of AWCY?'s thing.
> **Phenylalanine:** We do post-phenom art, but we're not AWCY. You can't really be AWCY. It's like, a kind of meme really. 
> **blusepth:** AWCY? is definitely not cool.
> **Phenylalanine:** Everyone is really damn tired of AWCY jokes.
> **CoolGuy95:** okay
> **jackomundo:** .tell AWritingDesk http://i.imgur.com/bnCs3.jpg
> **VanGogh:** Acknowledged.
> **Phenylalanine:** So we've moved away from using AWCY in just about anything. It's an old, worn out joke that no one laughs at anymore.
> **blusepth:** Also, AWCY? kind of got used by people who used post-phenom art in a way we don't really approve of. Like Stendhal's Nightmare. What's the point of making beautiful art if people can't appreciate it without dying or going crazy?
> **jackomundo:** ^
> **Phenylalanine:** These days, not many people do much of that "edgy" crap. At least not in our little circle. 
> **CoolGuy95:** I really didn't know all this, I just heard a little about AWCY and I thought it was interesting. I figured it would be a good way to expand my experience in art.
> **Phenylalanine:** Its fine
> **jorgumander:** yea, you're new here after all. can we see some of the stuff you've done before?
> **CoolGuy95:** Sure. let me dig some of this stuf up
> **Epimonsterous has joined __#post-phenomart__**
> **CoolGuy95:** it's not post-phenom, but here it is: http://i.imgur.com/AD9Lz.jpg
> **Epimonsterous:** ooh are we reviewing art?
> **jorgumander:** not bad, but not good either
> **Phenylalanine:** I kind of like it, but it feels like it needs a lot refinement.
> **blusepth:** it needs to be in color, like psychodelic swirls and stuff
> **Phenylalanine:** Hey Epimon, we're just taking a look at this new guy's stuff. 
> **Epimonsterous:** Eh. The shapes are a little lopsided, and your shading needs work.
> **CoolGuy95:** Is it really that bad? I mean, I know I'm not great but.... D:
> **blusepth:** keep practcing, its the only way to get better
> **jorgumander:** ^
> **jackomundo:** background landscape would help too.
> **CoolGuy95:** thanks for the feedback guys
> **Phenylalanine:** You take criticism pretty well, that's good.
> **CoolGuy95:** thanks
> **jorgumander:** so people, today I put together a quick tutorial for people new to post-phenom. just a simple animated picture.
> **jorgumander:** http://i.imgur.com/xsnISqj.jpg
> **blusepth:** lemme look
> **jackomundo:** the writing is kind of sloppy.
> **Phenylalanine:** I can barely read it, but I think I know the process you're describing. 
> **Phenylalanine:** The one with the crystals and rat blood? 
> **jackomundo:** yes
> **Phenylalanine:** That's a good one, tried and true. Still, you really need to improve your handwriting. Maybe use the text tool in Photoshop instead.
> **CoolGuy95:** it sounds interesting
> **blusepth:** jacko's tutorial is pretty hard to read, but it is a good technique for you to try out CoolGuy.
> **jorgumander:** yea, it is pretty simple and cheap. 
> **CoolGuy95:** I think I will. I can read the tutorial well enough since my own handwriting is bad.
> **Phenylalanine:** It would be good for you as an artist. It's always a good idea to experiment in new mediums. 
> **CoolGuy95:** I'll get started right away. I can get a mouse from the pet store down the road.
> **Phenylalanine:** One thing before you go CoolGuy.
> **CoolGuy95:** ?
> **Phenylalanine:** If you see the letters "SCP" in that order anywhere, on a truck, on a building, on someone's clothes, anywhere, drop what you are doing run.
> **Phenylalanine:** Run like you have never run before.
