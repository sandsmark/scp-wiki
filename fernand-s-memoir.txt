//Notes from Dr. Bernstein's personal audio journal://

> **10.27.2016:** SCP-082 made an unusual request this afternoon. Instead of asking for clothes like it usually does, it asked for a set of books. Specifically, it asked for books of poetry, as well as an issue of //Oxford Dictionary and Thesaurus//. SCP-082 has also asked for a stack of paper, along with a quill. All requests have been approved, and the materials should arrive by tomorrow morning. Since its request, SCP-082 has refused all food and water, and sits quietly in its chamber. Quite peculiar behavior for a skip so amiable...Well, as amiable as an 8 foot cannibal can be.

> **10.28.2016:** Ever since SCP-082 has gotten those books, it's been reading and writing nonstop. I've been surveying it for five hours and it hasn't taken a single break. It has used up three full stacks of paper already, most of which is crumpled on the floor. What the hell is it up to?

> **10.31.2016:** I have never seen 082 this happy before. When I came into my shift this morning, it was still writing. It's been listening to more upbeat music and I saw it dancing to some of the tunes. If someone told me that I would spend my day watching a 700 pound cannibal dance like a ballerina, while writing poetry, and humming to Chopin, I'd laugh in their face. 

> **11.3.2016:** Still writing. It's still writing. Over the past few days, it's gone through ten stacks of paper. Well, I guess this is better than eating off the heads of the D-class. 
> 
> 082 spoke to me today. It said that it wished to read me a piece of poetry that it wrote. Oddly, it seemed quite genuine with its emotion. I told it that it could read it to me tomorrow, as it was 11 at night, and I needed to go to bed. 082 seemed alright with it, and I headed home. What the hell did I get myself into?

**Foreword: The following is an interview of SCP-082 by Dr. Bernstein, head of SCP-082's containment.**

> [BEGIN LOG (11.4.2016)]
> 
> **Dr. Bernstein:** What is it, exactly, that you wanted to show us, 082?
> 
> **SCP-082:** It is a piece of literature that I have written. I'm quite proud of it. 
> 
> **Dr. Bernstein:** *sigh* Alright then. Go ahead, 082.
> 
> **SCP-082:** One moment please. I just need to reorganize my pages. (papers rustling) My apologies. I'm not normally this flustered...I'm ready.
> 
> **Dr. Bernstein:** Any time, 082.
> 
> **SCP-082:** Here we go. And--and do be warned. This is the first piece of poetry I have written. It will not be perfect.
> 
> **Dr. Bernstein:** I'm sure it's fine 082. Go on and read it.
> 
> **SCP-082:** Alright. Here we go. (clears throat)
> 
> In the dank, deep depths of the dark alleyway,
> Where no man can see the light of day,
> There stood a boy wearing tattered attire,
> And, in the corner, a small campfire.
> With rags as a sleeping mat, and a box for a house,
> And laying there, quiet as a mouse,
> The boy knew not to make any sound,
> For he knew what would happen if he were to be found.
> 
> While sleeping in his cot, the boy slept well,
> And felt, as a whole, rather swell.
> The boy woke the next morning, hearing a shout,
> And from his cot, he began to sprout.
> Looking to the light, he saw a figure,
> Though its full shape, he could not configure.
> Two more entered sight, all were a blur.
> Should the boy run? He was unsure.
> 
> The figures came charging at a rapid motion,
> Nothing could be heard over the commotion.
> They grabbed the boys limbs, and pulled him madly,
> The boy had to flee, but he could not, sadly.
> Trapped by the figures, he was unable to walk,
> With a cloth over his mouth, he was unable to talk.
> With a thump on the head, his world became dark,
> And along with the men, they disembarked.
> 
> With a groggy grunt, the boy awoke with tears,
> He was locked in a cage, the worst of his fears.
> Draped in red, he could not see,
> With bars of steel, he could not flee.
> There was a rustle, then a light so bright,
> The boy had almost lost his sight.
> Then, a man, with a twinkle in his eye
> Grabbed a cane and top hat, then began to outcry:
> 
> "Ladies and gentlemen, children of any age!
> Allow me to show you what is in this cage.
> Around the world, I've travelled, sea to sea,
> And I have brought a gift for thee to see.
> Be warned, you may run crying in fear,
> And this gift may also cause you to tear.
> But fret not, my dears, for it will cause no harm
> For if he does, I'll cut off his arm!"
> 
> "This great, hefty beast has arms so strong,
> That he could cut down trees all year long.
> Yes, it's true, this beast has some muscle,
> He could certainly proclaim victory in any tussle.
> But folks, if you will have a look at this creature!
> We must not neglect his most prominent feature.
> With jaws of steel, and teeth so bright,
> This creature's smile could light up the night!"
> 
> The man turned to the boy, scowl on his face,
> He whispered, "Come on, beast, pick up the pace!
> Your audience is waiting, give em' a show!"
> The man took the cane, then delivered a blow.
> The boy shook with fear, not knowing what to do,
> The audience before him began to boo.
> With one last breath that reeked of bile,
> The boy stood tall, and then, he smiled.
> 
> Cheers, cheers! Cheers all around!
> Not a single frown was able to be found.
> The man stepped forward, and said, "How about that?"
> The crowd before him threw coins in his hat.
> The man was rich, all thanks to the boy.
> "Perhaps," the man thought, "there is more use for this toy"
> Then the man reached into a pocket in his back,
> He pulled out a whip, and let out a //crack.//
> 
> Blood cre--...blood...uh...
> 
> **Dr. Bernstein:** Are you alright, 082?
> 
> **SCP-082:** Yes...yes of course. Where was I? Oh yes:
> 
> Blood crept down the boy's back, as thick as molasses.
> Brought to his knees, right before the masses.
> The boy let out a roar, all could hear.
> The crowd shrieked, then ran in fear.
> The man chuckled, and looked at the boy,
> Then said, "Oh come now, don't be so coy.
> From here on out, I'll be your guide.
> And, together, we shall travel far and wide!"
> 
> Days passed like months, and months like years.
> Each day he was alive, he bathed in tears.
> Was this his place, his final destination?
> Is this life his only true application?
> Whatever questions he asked, no one answered the boy.
> For what was he if he not a toy?
> It took many years, and much contemplation,
> But at last, the boy received an explanation.
> 
> In the crypts of his mind, there came a voice.
> This voice allowed the poor boy a choice.
> Shall he remain in his cage, filled with dejection?
> Or shall he get revenge with divine retaliation?
> The boy stared at his thousands of scars,
> Then brought his attention to the light of the stars.
> In order to escape, the boy needed a plan,
> But most of all, he must become a man.
> 
> It was the last day of the tour, the final show
> What would happen? The boy did not know.
> The man in the hat came out from the back.
> He took out his whip, then gave another crack.
> Still locked in his cage, the boy could not fight.
> All he could do was shake with fright.
> The man just chuckled, not giving a care.
> He grabbed his cane, and gave one last declare:
> 
> "Now folks, hear me, as I tell you my feat!
> I stand here, offering you all a treat.
> After many years of teaching and rehabilitation,
> I present this beast to the entire nation!
> For he is no longer a beast, no longer so cruel,
> And with my teachings, he is now my mule.
> Don't believe me, you say? Need I show you?"
> The man then unlocked the cage, and out the door flew.
> 
> Slowly, the boy inched from his crib,
> To encourage him, the man jabbed him in the rib.
> Picking up the pace, the boy made it out,
> The audience before him let out a shout.
> "Beast!" they called him. "Abomination!" they cried,
> The boy could not smile, no matter how much he tried.
> The man beside him, with eyes full of rage,
> Shouted at the boy, while hitting the cage.
> 
> "Come on, my boy! What are you doing?
> Can you not see that the audience is booing?
> After all these years, and all of this time,
> Now is when you decide to begrime?
> Show them your power, show them your might!
> For I know that you're human, just ever so slight.
> Show them how a beast like you does no harm.
> For if you don't, I will saw off your arm!"
> 
> The boy stood still, unable to move.
> He could not find his internal groove.
> The crypts of his mind internally froze,
> Then suddenly, in front of him, a shadow arose.
> The shadow engulfed the boy, entrapped his soul,
> Then slowly and quietly, it began to cajole.
> Finally, the boy knew what must be done,
> And chuckled to himself, "Let's have some fun."
> 
> The boy grabbed his captor, and held him tight.
> He stared into his eyes, and saw the fright.
> As the boy lifted the man, the man screamed in fear.
> From his left eye, the boy saw him tear. 
> The boy did not care, he had no remorse,
> For he knew that this man was truly so coarse.
> The boy opened his jaws, and placed the man inside.
> And though it was muffled, the man still cried.
> 
> He squirmed in his mouth, as the boy began to munch,
> Then he grew limp with one final **CRUNCH**.
> 
> (SCP-082 is silent for a minute, and then continues)
> 
> Blood gushed in the boy's mouth, it was quite a sight.
> Still, unrelenting, the boy held on tight.
> For he was no longer a boy, much more vicious and malicious.
> As he devoured the man's flesh, he whispered, "How delicious."
> Still wanting more, he turned to the crowd,
> Who had already started running and screaming aloud.
> The beast chased after, grabbing a few.
> He ripped off their arms, then began to chew.
> 
> After those few, he grabbed some more.
> He ripped out their entrails, which leaked on the floor.
> After those meals, he ran to the street.
> He feasted on those with livers so sweet.
> In the corner of his eye, he saw a young man,
> With a pair of ripped trousers, and a gun in his hand.
> Though he tried to take on the beast,
> It was upon his corpse that the beast would feast.
> 
> But before the beast could go any more,
> He took a look down, and stared at the gore,
> For this boy was like him, alone and afraid,
> With no one else who would give him aid.
> The beast was now alone, blood creeping in his scars,
> No one could see him except for the stars.
> With much shame, the beast fled the scene,
> For he did not know how he could be this obscene.
> 
> He took shelter in the woods, unable to cope
> With the actions he made; he was out of hope.
> He washed himself in a nearby river,
> Scraping off the remnants of the young man's liver.
> He grabbed some leaves, and then some sticks,
> Then made a small cot, in which he affixed
> A small drape for a door, and some leaves that were dead,
> This was the only things the beast could call his bed.
> 
> (SCP-082 begins to tear, but continues to speak)
> 
> After the night passed, he awoke in a room,
> With many bright lights, and a mood so gloom.
> There were people above, staring at the aberration.
> The creature then knew the reality of the situation.
> His life flashed again, all of the pain,
> All the creature could do was exclaim.
> For he was again alone, with nothing to do.
> Then, a voice from above said, "Hello, 082."
> 
> (SCP-082 breaks down into a fit of crying)
> 
> **Dr. Bernstein:** Is that...is that all 082?
> 
> **SCP-082:** (sniffs) Yes...yes that is all. Thank you for your time.
> 
> (SCP-082 travels to the corner of the containment chamber and sits, facing the wall)
> 
> [END LOG]
