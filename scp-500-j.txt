**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-500 is to be kept in the Primary Containment Zone of Containment Area 25b with her mouth covered at all times (the original duct tape has been replaced by something harder to remove). For the time being SCP-76 has been placed in the 3rd floor janitor's closet, security for which will be provided by Scruffy, the head of Area 25b janitorial staff. All previous security measures have been doubled, with an extra 4 Nuclear devices added just in case. 

**Description:** SCP-500, formerly known as [DATA EXPUNGED], is a --malevolent harpy hell bent on destroying anything in its path-- female human possessing a wide range of abilities. Those given to staff are: 
* Reducing any adult male to tears.  
* Creating an urge to kill oneself --one of these days I swear--
* Causing addiction to a wide array of alcoholic beverages --I just cant face that bitch sober--
* A death glare at any passing female, --I happen to glance at, but it doesn't mean anything for god's sake-- which has been assured to the research team to result in death of said female.
* The ability to track no matter --where I am-- the location.
* The ability to attempt communication at the worst possible time --I mean, cmon its not that kind of massage parlor I swear--
* An intuitive ability to tell when someone is lying and deconstruct the entire lie --resulting in sleeping on the damn couch while the fucking dog gets my spot in bed.-- 
* Causing a massive mental breakdown of any male --that not even drugs can help, oh yeah Ive tried. You're better off with a gun in my opinion--
* Arguing for up to several hours --by which time I just say whatever will let me get back to the damn game before its over.--
* --She was able to pull one hell of a [DATA EXPUNGED] position just like [DATA EXPUNGED][DATA EXPUNGED][DATA EXPUNGED][DATA EXPUNGED], but fuck that.--

By order of O5-8, there are to be no tests run on SCP-500 and the only interaction with the subject is when food is delivered.

It should be noted that all required documentation and revised security personnel was gratefully provided by O5-8 who assured the on site command staff that the entire O5 council was on board with this. O5-8 also mentioned that the current communication blackout will be lifted --when she finally learns who the fucking boss is-- as soon as possible.

**Addendum:** SCP-500 was released three days after containment began, a heavy amnesiac dose was required. O5-8 is currently on suspension pending heavy counseling and therapy. Suffice to say, I don't know why we didn't see it sooner, or why no one smelt the vodka on O5-8's breath the entire time he was on site.

**Side-note** SCP-76-2 apparently woke up to find a portable DVD player running Deadliest Warrior nonstop and as luck would have it, this placated 76-2 for 35 hours before he was found. Scruffy was commended for his containment plan and promoted to head of Area 25b security.
