* And with that marks another year of Foundation Wiki tyranny, as we pass on into the fabled time of 2019! But before we do, let's take a quick look back:
 * 1886 articles total were posted this year!
 * [[[SCP-3321]]] was the first article posted
 * ...and [[[The Show Must Always Go On]]] was the last!
 * 16,070 people joined the wiki this year, which means that the admins had to click at least 16,070 times on the "accept" button.
 * And finally, in these 5 past days alone, we've already cast 5,819 votes total! 
 * So lets hope for an even greater 2019!
* [http://www.scp-wiki.net/cliche-con-2019 Cliche Con 2019] - The first contest of 2019 has started! So get out there and start writing generic humanoids with dark, mysterious pasts! (Note: mileage may vary) 
* [http://scp.bz/2018survey The 2018 Survey] is up and we want you (yeah you!) to fill it out!

You will notice little '📈' emojis besides some articles. That denotes SCP articles which were under 30 and tales which were under 20 when this edition of site news was posted. Give them a little love! Speaking from personal experience, the most frustrating thing that can happen to an article is not deletion, but stagnating below 20 without any comments. So try to read, vote, and comment on these articles! They're often hidden gems :)

**This month we are featuring just four artists. Each as a sort of ambassador of four different sites with a strong concentration of SCP artwork - Tumblr, DeviantArt, Reddit, and Pixiv.**

From Tumblr we have [[[zhange-artwork|Zhange]]] who published two paintings this month. Click on the thumbnails to read the individual Tumblr posts about them if you'd like to learn more about the context of these pieces.

In December the prolific artist [[[https://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/search?q=author%3ASteveMobCannon&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&feature=legacy_search|SteveMobCannon]]] brought their unique style to SCP for the first time and posted progress drawings on Reddit as they re-imagined a few classic SCP monsters.

+* Q&A:

++* Q: Can I replace a blurb that you wrote for one of my articles with my own? I'm not satisfied with it.

A: Absolutely. You will always have that option at any point.

++* Q: I noticed an error/typo/incorrect information and wish to correct it. May I?

A: Sure! If the changes are not limited to your own article(s) and/or are substantial changes across multiple entries, you should post in that month's discussion page and then make the changes.

++* Q: I wrote an article and it seems to have stuck. Can I send a blurb of mine to one of the frequent collaborators?

A: Yup! It's much easier if you come to us about it, and it gives you the control over what you want shown on the news page.
