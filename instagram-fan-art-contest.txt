The SCP Foundation Wiki is known for the awesome stories, characters, and SCPs created by our wonderful authors. A more overlooked aspect of this community is the tons of fantastic artists that bring these creations to life. This contest is meant to promote these artists and give them a fun way to share their creations with the community.
