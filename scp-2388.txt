**Item #:** SCP-2388

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The drive containing SCP-2388 should be kept in a Safe-class containment locker at Site-73.  Affected computers should not be connected to external networks until the SCP-2388 program has been removed.  Instances of SCP-2388-1, as well as any researchers interacting with them, should be provided with adequate ear protection.

//Update//: As of ██/██/2016, Foundation web crawlers have been updated with keywords related to SCP-2388 in an effort to find and contain additional instances of SCP-2388 online.  Should an instance be found, the host site should be targeted with Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks until Foundation operatives can remove the instance of SCP-2388. See Addendum SCP-2388-1 for details.

**Description:** SCP-2388 is an executable file named CRUISE.EXE.  The original copy of this file resides on a lime green 2GB USB flash drive, with the file name handwritten on the outside in black marker.  Attempts to view SCP-2388's code shows the letter A repeated 29,290 times, and adding or removing files from the flash drive has consistently resulted in error messages.  If the drive is attached to a computer and the file is opened by a living human, the computer will install a copy of SCP-2388 onto the desktop in 15-30 seconds. This appears to function even on operating systems not usually capable of reading .exe files.  Once the program is installed, both the computer and the individual who opened the file (hereafter referred to as SCP-2388-1) will be affected by related anomalous effects.

    Affected computers will continuously run SCP-2388 in the background, using 29.29 KB of active memory.  Letters typed on the affected computer will begin to become unintentionally capitalized.  Testing suggests that this occurs on the motherboard of the computer, as changing the attached keyboard has had no effect.  Initially, this affects less than 1% of letters typed, but increases gradually over the course of  64 hours of runtime, until all typed letters are affected.  Letters capitalized as a result SCP-2388 can be deleted, but will remain capitalized if retyped.[[footnote]]If a different letter is typed in place of the deleted letter, it is not automatically capitalized, but maintains the same chance of capitalization as before.[[/footnote]]  Foundation programmers have thus far been unable to remove copies of SCP-2388 during the initial 64 hours after installation without completely reformatting the affected computer.  After 64 hours have passed, the program can be deleted, returning standard functionality to the computer; however, this will not revert the anomalous changes to SCP-2388-1.
    	
    SCP-2388-1 subjects do not initially register any changes; however, after approximately six hours, subjects begin to notice a difference between the intended volume of their speech and the actual volume.  This difference continues to increase over the course of 64 hours until the subject's standard speech reaches 98-114 dB, with commensurate increases in shouted and whispered speech.  This does not damage the subject's vocal cords, suggesting an anomalous amplification of sound after it is produced.  Hearing, however, is affected normally, and SCP-2388-1 subjects risk hearing damage from their own voices within a month of exposure without proper protection.

**Addendum 2388-1:** The original copy of SCP-2388 was discovered during a raid on a suspected anartist warehouse.  The flash drive containing it was found plugged into the remains of a laptop which had been destroyed via repeated strikes with a blunt object.  The following note was found on an envelope nearby, written in black marker with the same handwriting as the label on the flash drive.

**Addendum 2388-2:** On ██/██/2016, an additional instance of SCP-2388 was found in a download link on the website ██████████.net.  The instance was quickly removed, and amnestics were deemed unnecessary, as only one download had occurred.  A search of the site's archives revealed the following conversation on the site forums, believed to be related to SCP-2388.  The individuals associated to the usernames have not yet been discovered.
