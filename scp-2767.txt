**Item #:** SCP-2767

[[include component:image-block  name=Prussianblue.jpg| caption=SCP-2767 applied to a test surface
]]

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2767, in its tins, is to be kept within a storage locker at Site 15. SCP-2767 is not to be painted onto the walls of --a room-- any number of rooms simultaneously without permission of the SCP-2767 head of research. Any wall treated with SCP-2767 must be cleared completely within 48 hours of application. 

**Description:** SCP-2767 is an unbranded type of 'Prussian Blue' paint contained across --12-- 8 unlabelled tins. The tins which contain the paint display no anomalous properties and as such  the quantity of paint is finite, and any paint produced by colour matching to SCP-2767 is non-anomalous

When a subject is placed within a room painted with SCP-2767, they begin experiencing feelings of claustrophobia, specifically that of the walls being extremely close. This effect occurs regardless of the actual distance between the subject and the walls. During testing, subjects are still able to converse and describe their feelings; however, they are physically incapable of moving from what they perceive as being a tightly enclosed space. The dimensions of this space are --invariably-- (see Incident Report 2767-A) in almost all cases equal to their arm span, taken from the point where the effect initially manifests.

The anomalous effects of SCP-2767 manifest from between 20 minutes to 6 hours after the subject has entered the room. At this point, subjects perceive the walls as shrinking to the aforementioned dimensions instantly. In 90% of cases, subjects with moderate-to-severe diagnosed claustrophobia   experience effects within the first hour. 80% of subjects with moderate-to-severe agoraphobia, however, take from three to six hours to be affected. If psychological profiling indicates neither claustro- nor agoraphobia, the effect will initiate at any point between the aforementioned bounds. The effect is not present when more than one person is in the enclosed room.

All tests conducted with 4-walled testing chambers.

__**Test-2767-1 - ██16/██/██**__
> **Subject: D-2767-1** 
> **Procedure**: D-class without prior psychological testing. Door closed.
> **Results**: 2 hours 21 minutes in, subject began to to frantically attempt to move from within an invisible confined space. Subject expressed distress and stated that the "Walls are too close" multiple times. Subject was 'freed' upon the door to the test chamber opening.
> **Notes:** Effects of paint appear to be both psychological and physical, as subject was otherwise mentally stable before the effects began. Creation of exit seems to cancel the effect.

__**Test-2767-2 - ██16/██/██**__
> **Subject: D-2767-2** 
> **Procedure**: D-class with psychologically evaluated 'high-level' claustrophobia. Door closed.
> **Results:** 45 minutes in, subject show signs of distress and started beating against an invisible barrier at arms length. Subject attempted to calm down, but 10 minutes later broke into hysterical crying. Upon door opening, subject broke 'free' of the invisible enclosure and collapsed. Subject taken away for psychological assessment.
> **Notes:** Following assessment suggests new increase in claustrophobic tendencies, with subject purposefully avoiding walls painted blue. Effects wore off within a week.

__**Test-2767-3 - ██16/██/██**__
> **Subject: D-2767-3** 
> **Procedure:** D-class with no assessed psychological claustrophobia or agoraphobia. Door open with security personnel positioned outside the entrance.
> **Results:** 8 hours in with no effects. Subject escorted from room without incident.
> **Notes:** Physical exit point appears to prevent the anomalous properties of 2XX from materialising.

__**Test-2767-6 - ██16/██/██**__
> **Subject: D-2767-4** 
> **Procedure:** D-class with psychologically assessed severe agoraphobia. Door closed.
> **Results:** Subject displayed extreme discomfort upon door closing, sticking to corners of the room nearest to the entrance. Precisely 6 hours after the door closed, subject became highly distressed, wept whilst shouted profanities, and violently beat against an invisible confinement space for 20 minutes until the door to the testing chamber was opened. 
> **Notes:** The subject was found to be bruised in areas where they had attempted to beat against the invisible barrier. Subject has since refused to enter the open-air recreation facilities, complaining that 'The sky is too close'.

__**Test-2767-14 - ██16/██/██**__
> **Subject: D-2767-14** 
> **[REDACTED]**
> //See Incident Report 2767-A//

In an effort to speed-up testing,  multiple rooms were painted with SCP-2767. Normally, these rooms are stripped of paint after each subsequent test,, however on ██16/██/15, testing room 8 was painted before testing room 7 was stripped. This was unknown to researchers, who attempted to continue tests on D-class personnel:

__**Test-14 - ██16/██/15**__
> **Subject: D-2767-14,** 
> **Procedure:** D-class evaluated as having no spacial phobias. Subject is placed at the centre of testing chamber 8. A body camera is attached subject's person in order to gain an interior perspective of the SCP-2767 phenomenon.
> **Result:** immediately upon the door closing, the subject  froze in place and stood straight, arms to their side and facing directly forwards. Despite no visible motion from the subject, the camera and in-room microphones continued to record the subject. From the attached camera, the subject appeared to be able to move within an enclosed space now only slightly wider than their shoulder width. The footage proceeded as follows:

> //Subject quickly turns from left to right, their hands pressing against the 'walls'. Heavy, panicked breathing can be heard.//
> 
> **D-2767-14:** "Uh, not sure if you guys are getting this, but, uh, the walls are kinda close to me all of a sudden. I can barely move in here. Uh, looks like I can still turn just about OK though. Wait. There seems, uh, there looks like a passage to my right, have a look..."
> 
> //D-2767-14 turns to face this passage. It appears to go off to a seemingly endless point, disappearing into atmospheric haze. All surfaces throughout match the colour of SCP-2767. Subject is encouraged to proceed down the passage.//
> 
> **D-2767-14:** "Ok, so, seems endless but sure, if you say so."
> 
> //Subject continues to follow passage for 30 minutes, before it appears that it is beginning to narrow. Subject turns sideways after encouragement, and is now only capable of shuffling sideways. Camera is pressed directly against wall and now longer shows any relevant footage, however testing room microphones no longer pick up vocalisations, and so camera is left on to record audio.//
> 
> //Three hours into exploration://
> 
> **D-2767-14:**" Ok, I can barely move and honestly I'm starting to panic. I uh, oh god, I can barely move., and jesus it smells now, like, like paint but... but like it's rotting. So chemical. Ugh, I wanna turn back. I... I can't turn back, there's just a... oh god no no no no no. There's a wall right to my left, I can't turn back, oh god oh god oh god..."
> 
> //D-2767-14 starts to show signs of a panic attack. Researchers issue encouragement that the exit is nearby and that a reward will be presented at the end. Subject, now crying, utters a muted agreement to continue. From security cameras, D-2767-14 still appears frozen in the centre of the testing chamber.//
> 
> **D-2767-14:** "This isn't right anymore... //*soft whimpering*// I don't want to go around the corner... don't... oh I need to leave. I just..."
> 
> //Subject informs researchers that the passage now takes a sharp turn close to 90 degrees to the right. Subject, without encouragement, attempts to round corner and [REDACTED].//
> 
> //Proceeding motion from subject since rounding corner is filled with soft squelching and what appears to be the grinding and crunching of subject's bones. Subject's breathing becomes more laboured.//
> 
>  //6 hours into exploration://
> 
> **D-2767-14:** "I can't stand it anymore,.... it all hurts. hurts hurts hurts all of it. The space is not here why is not here.... I can smell myself... I'm in the walls.... Get me out of it... get me out of it... I'm in the walls..."
> 
> //Due to the 6 hour mark being the previous upper bound for anomalous manifestation, and there being no signs of an exit for D-2767-14, an attempt was made to open testing chamber 8. However, the doors to both painted chambers 7 and 8 were unresponsive. Explosives were ruled out in case of damage to subject. The test was therefore allowed to continue. During the following 5 hours, subject is silent apart from the occasional whimper and pause to catch their breath and cry. Despite having no water or food, the sound of scraping along the walls suggests subject does not slow movement due to what should now be moderate dehydration and hunger.//
> 
> //12 hours into the exploration log, the scraping noises now indicate that D-2767-14 has slowed to around 10% of their previous speed. Subject begins to speak.//
> 
> **D-2767-14:** "It's happening... I'm home... no not home home is me... I'm home honey I'm home I'm home honey..."
> 
> //At 12 hours and 32 minutes in, security camera footage inside testing chamber 8 shows D-2767-14 has  started to 'phase out', becoming slightly transparent. Footage from the adjacent painted chamber 7 shows what appears to be a human form materialising at the centre of the room at a rate equal to the phasing out of D-2767-14.//
> 
> //With the subject now becoming less material, audio picks up loud agonised screaming from subject which does not cease until they are almost entirely immaterial in testing chamber.  Testing chamber 7 shows an almost fully-formed D-2767-14 at the centre of the room, however their face is contorted into an exaggerated scream, arms spread outwards, and showing clearly severe injuries through tears in uniform. Moments later, the subject appears to have fully materialised in testing chamber 7, leaving no trace in testing chamber 8. Doors to both chambers suddenly open, and subject collapses to the ground. Medical response finds subject unresponsive.//

> Autopsy showed that all ribs had been [REDACTED] and were unrecoverable, pelvis shattered in 5 places, forearm tendons snapped and bones broken, and skull caved in on right side. Death determined to have occurred 12 hours 32 minutes into testing.

SCP-2767 was recovered on ██14/██/██ following reports of the Orville family going missing in ██████, Illinois. Local police arrived at the Orville residence to find Alan Orville dead in the centre of an upstairs room, covered in bruises and bleeding from bone protrusions. Further investigations into the house resulted in an officer entering a closet in the house recently painted with what is now known to be SCP-2767, with a noose hanging from the ceiling. The officer immediately reported a feeling of tremendous unease, and attempted to leave the closet, only to be trapped by the effects of SCP-2767. After two more officers encountered this effect, the foundation was called and Class-A amnestics administered to all affected. A journal was found in the living room of the house, written by Alan Orville, beginning ██/12/██/██, and ending 1 week before recovery. For notable excerpts from this diary, see Addendum-2767-1. Whilst 12 cans of the paint were found, 4 were completely empty, whilst the other 8 were unopened.

All property on the house was exhumed by the Foundation and tested for anomalous properties, thus revealing the existence of SCP-2767. The house has since been demolished and Alan Orville buried with his wife and child at ██████ Methodist Church cemetery.

The following are excerpts from the diary of Alan Orville. An average of 4 days spanned between each entry, and many were mundane or not of note and thus have not been included.

> //██/05/██/12//
> 
> //Well whadya know. 40 years in and I finally found the girl of my dreams. Her name is Chris, and boy is she beautiful and kind. I can't say a bad thing about her. We've been seeing each other on the internet for 2 weeks but today, at that nice chinese restaurant round the corner, is where I knew that I'm gonna marry this woman. I'll surprise her soon, but I suppose I'm smart enough to give it a month.//

> //██/08/██/12//
> 
> //Chris moved into my place today. She may be a bit younger than me, but she's mature as hell and didn't hesitate when I asked her to do it! I best start clearing out the rooms then, and maybe do some pretty decorating for my pretty wife...//

> //██/09/██/13//
> 
> //Well damn. Damn Damn Damnit again. Chris is pregnant. Been a month 'cording to the doctor. I don't really know what to think. My own child (and it IS mine!), what a life I've got to live. Suppose it was a good idea to live as free as I did up to know. In  9 months there'll only be 2 lives I care about, my wive's and my child's. Thank you god, I didn't spect it, but I'll take it and love it all the same.//

> //██/03/██/14// 
> 
> //Not long now and sweet little Robby will be popping out of Chris! I've been clearing out the spare room upstairs. Got some nice stuff for it: a crib, some toys, nice soft carpet so he don't bump himself up crawling 'round. Chris made sure it's all matching too. Her favourite colour is 'Prussian Blue', so I got some tins of that from the city (sure was hard to get hold of round here!). I got enough to keep painting the whole house with it until Robby leaves. I'll paint his room up this week so the Robby won't have to breathe in no fumes, leave plenty of time for it to dry.//

> //██/05/██/14//
> 
> //Not much time to write 'cause the baby is home today! He might not see how damn pretty he is (has his mother to thank for that!) but I'm still gonna tell him. I still gotta work to keep paying, though. I don't wanna leave the two alone without me here, but can't exactly raise a child without having  a job, can you? Robby'll learn that one day too, I hope.//

> //██/05/██/14//
> 
> //Robby is dead.//

> //██/05/██/14//
> 
> //I shouldn't have done any of this, should I? First little Robby, now I lose Chris? It was all a mistake. The doctor said the baby had some kinda brain problem, trauma or some sort. Maybe if I was home... no, it happened in the night.... We didn't hear crying, just woke up and he wasn't breathing no more. Chris sure cried though, but I didn't know how to do it myself. Doctor said she had a stroke from stress. I can't blame her though. No mother should see her child die. And no man should see his wife and baby die...//
> 
> //This is it, then. I've got everything set up in the closet and I've tidied the house up too, so when I come back as a ghost we'll all be able to live here comfortably in the afterlife... I hope. I hope Chris can see the Prussian Blue I've painted in the closet. I hope it helps me think of her when I die...//
