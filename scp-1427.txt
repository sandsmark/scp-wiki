**Item #:** SCP-1427

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-1427 is to be contained on-site at the Ryugyong Containment Operations Center ("RCOC"), operated by the Foundation in partnership with the Korean People's Army. Due to the artifact's effects, Foundation personnel are not to enter the DPRK, approach to within 130 km of the SCP-1427 exclusion zone, or attempt to interact directly with the object itself. Foundation personnel are to provide remote support to on-site DPRK personnel. Under no circumstances are Foundation personnel to attempt to dissuade DPRK containment team from false or unusual beliefs concerning the nature of their duties at the RCOC or the nature of their national government.

As totalitarian indoctrination appears to provide conditional immunity to the signal broadcast by the artifact, Foundation personnel assigned to offsite monitoring must meet the following psychological testing criteria:

* Standardized Milgram Compliance Panel: >71
* IPIP Openness Panel: <39
* RWA Authoritarian Submission Panel: >17
* RWA Conventionality Panel: >31

At present, only three national governments possess citizens with conditioning suitable for containment of SCP-1427: the Republic of Turkmenistan, the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, and  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea ("DPRK"). Of the three suitable containment areas, political issues render North Korea the only government suitable for long-term containment. Embedded Foundation affiliates in UN Security Council member states shall take no action tending to destabilize the DPRK, promote democratization, or permit entry of substantial numbers of foreigners. In the event of democratization, destabilization, or nuclear war, Foundation intergovernmental liasons shall attempt to transfer of the object to a designated secondary containment site. In the event that no secondary containment sites are available, the primary containment site and its surrounding environment are to be thermally sterilized without regard to the risk of civilian casualties. 

Using presently-available techniques, thermal sterilization of Pyongyang and surrounding environs bears a 91% chance of containment failure. Containment failure is predicted to result in a EK-class event, resulting in the extinguishment of all human consciousness within ███ days. 

**Description:** SCP-1427 is a featureless 14m x 2m x 2m beryllium bronze stele. Though originally recovered in an inactive state, the artifact presently produces a directional electromagnetic pulse every 7ns. Targets for the pulse are selected randomly from the 20,736 nearest human subjects, ignoring those already exhibiting the effects of the pulse, but including those who are immune. The device appears to have no effective maximum range: on several occasions, the device has exhibited the ability to make over-the-horizon broadcasts to otherwise occluded subjects by deflecting its signal off of the Earth's ionosphre. The artifact's means of detecting humans, and the causative mechanism underlying its effects, are presently unknown. 

Upon receipt of the signal, subjects permanently experience increased suggestibility, severe abulia, and short-term memory loss. These effects are, however, secondary to the artifact's primary effect, which is substantial reduction in prefrontal SQ2 signal. Due to information recovered from SCP-███, Foundation researchers presently believed that this reduced SQ2 signal corresponds to a significant reduction in, or total destruction of, the subject's subjective consciousness. 

SCP-1427 was originally recovered from a Cistercian monestary in southeastern Algeria by Italian Arditi in January of 1938. Photographs and laboratory notes from that period depict or mention a rhodium carbide outer casing, embossed with lettering in an unknown Semitic alphabet. That outer casing is presumed to have been destroyed by Italian fascists before the object's transfer to Leipzig in 1944. Between 1938 and 1944, the governments of Germany and Italy attempted to activate the artifact, both without success. In the immediate aftermath of World War II, the object was kept in East German custody. The East German government took no recorded action with respect to the artifact.

In 1947, the East German government transferred SCP-1427 to Soviet control, who moved it to Kyshtim, Chelyabinsk Oblast, USSR. In September of 1957, Soviet researchers intentionally activated SCP-1427. Though the artifact affected its immediate surroungings, then-existing features of the Soviet government prevented the EK-class end of human consciousness. After sterilization of the affected area, the Soviet government contacted the Foundation through intergovernmental liasons, and the artifact was transferred to Foundation custody at Site 67 southwest of Chernhiv, Ukraine. Since initial containment, the artifact has only been transferred once: in 1986, due to predicted instability in the Soviet government, the artifact was transferred to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Shortly thereafter, the Foundation commenced construction of the Ryugyong Containment Facility, where the object has been stored since its completion in 1988.

**DOCUMENT SCP-1427-ETR-3: ETHICS COMMITTEE DISSENT, SCP-1427**

> On December 5, 1991, a nine-member panel of the SCP Foundation Ethics Committee decided, after a 2-4-3 plurality vote, to actively support the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea ("North Korea") in order to effectuate containment of SCP-1427. In summary, the deciding plurality found the following points in favor of limited stabilization and support:
> * Instability and increasing political openness may soon render the USSR unsuitable for containment of SCP-1427.
> * In the event of political instability in North Korea, the device may be safely transferred to the custody of the People's Republic of China or Indonesia.
> * North Korea's closed borders limit the risk of exposing foreigners.
> * Due to limited trade opportunities, Foundation affiliates and liasons are better able to manipulate North Korean internal policy toward effective containment.
> Despite the clear benefits of the above, we dissent.  Repeated experimentation has demonstrated that SCP-1427 requires no more than 12^4 psychologically suitable individuals in close proximity to the object in order to effectuate perfect containment. Maintaining over twenty million individuals in a state of perpetual, involuntary totalitarian abjection is an unacceptable cost to impose on human subjects. While it is clear that, in 1957, doing so was a necessary accession to certain facts on the ground (_viz._, the unavailability of alternatives), the Foundation has recruited 9,724 D-Class candidates since that date, or just under half the population required to successfully contain the object. Though unclear in 1957, it is now scientifically demonstrated that totalitarian indoctrination may be recreated under laboratory conditions with relatively little sophisticated intervention by researchers //See// Zimbardo, P, "On Obedience to Authority," [REFERENCE OMITTED]. Our failure to do so is an ethical failure of catastrophic proportions
> 
> The majority opinion in this review declined to authorize experimentation into artificial totalitarianism on the necessary scale, citing some practical concerns, but largely ethical concerns; particularly, that it would be unacceptable to create a totalitarian society in miniature simply for the purpose of containing SCP-1427. But in order to avoid creating an ethical disaster in miniature, we have authorized one writ large: totalitarianism which selects individuals by a birthright lottery and not by any particular antisocial acts. As recent events in the USSR and elsewhere have demonstrated, totalitarian dictatorship is not a necessary feature of human society. It is a phase of development which occurred and will someday pass, and it is not the Foundation's right (nor even its duty) to permanently arrest the development of the North Korean people for some greater good, no matter how great that good may be. 
> 
> The majority are demonstrably correct that taking appropriate action to contain SCP-1427 would involve extraordinary moral compromises by the SCP Foundation, whereas mere abdication of our responsibility shares the burden with all humanity and the North Korean leadership. When we signed our recruiting paperwork, we consented to bear that burden, and do what must be done for the greater good. That we now impose that burden on the people of North Korea, rather than shouldering it ourselves, is an unacceptable abdication of our responsibilities as Foundation employees.

> For the foregoing reasons, we the undersigned dissent, reserving the right to appeal this decision to the O5 counsel.
