+ "Another World"

++ Verse One
I am floating through a dream
Seeing the most peculiar things
People Passing
No one asking
What's it all mean?

++ Verse Two
But there's nowhere else to turn
Seems my burden was to learn
No one knows
None of my kin
That they're asleep

++ Chorus
I need to wake up
Into my true reality
I need to wake up
This dream is killing me
If I could see
The Five, the Stars
On a journey into Mars
I need to wake up
This isn't who I'm supposed to be

++ Verse 3
I'll take a pilgrimage
To learn the circumstances
Of how I'm in this world
Devoid of second chances
None of it's real
How could it be
Ripped from the everlasting sea
The wind's gone chill
I don't have the pill
To set my mind free
How could it be?

++ Chorus
I need to wake up
Into my true reality
I need to wake up
This dream is killing me
If I could see
The Five, the Stars
On a journey into Mars
I need to wake up
This isn't who I'm supposed to be

++ Bridge
The best-laid plans of the Mice and the Men
And the Sword and the Pen
It's all run out of me
The wind from my sail
Every moment tears 
My feeble grip on true reality
How can it be?

++ Chorus
I need to wake up
Into my true reality
I need to wake up
This dream is killing me
If I could see
The Five, the Stars
On a journey into Mars
I need to wake up
This isn't who I'm supposed to be
