##white|So we now have a Genesis game, a 90's TV show, a 360 game, and a Hollywood movie that's titled Sonic the Hedgehog. Like I get it, brand recognition and rebooting and new universe and whatnot. But come on, four times in less than thirty years? I mean even other Spiderman media add more to the title than just "Spiderman" aside from the Sam Rami films. And how often has Spiderman been rebooted or restarted? God, Sega.##
