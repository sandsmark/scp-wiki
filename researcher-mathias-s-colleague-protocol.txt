title:Researcher Mathias's Colleague Protocol
**Name:** Researcher Mathias

**Security Clearance:** None

**Current Site Location:** Site-319

**Specific Colleague Protocol:** When interacting with Researcher Stuart Mathias, it is important to maintain the façade that he has any ranking within The Foundation. To aid this maintenance, the following terms are to be kept in mind:

||~ IF HE SAYS... ||~ HE IS REFERRING TO... ||
|| Office || His cell ||
|| Computer || The floor ||
|| Documents || The writing on the floor ||
|| Apartment || The far right corner with the lamp ||
|| Wristwatch || The tracking bracelet on his left arm ||

Meals are to be brought to his cell at 09:00 and 16:00. Balanced meals are preferred, but a Philadelphia Cheesecake Bar may be provided as a snack upon a new addition to the floor.

Watch where you step.

**Profile:** Researcher Mathias is gifted with a unique form of clairvoyance that has proven to be beneficial to Site-319. This, however, seems to have greatly skewed his awareness. No one knows how he appeared in Containment Cell-0700, nor why he insists that it is his office/apartment.

Researcher Mathias has been known to use the provided crayons to write on the floor of his cell. Whenever he points his right index finger to anything written on the floor, he will recite something pertaining to the subject from memory. There are no variations in recitations.

|| SCP is [[[SCP-3757|lightning bugs]]][[footnote]]"This is by far my best work. I'm very proud of it. I remember being unreasonably anxious when I posted it and immensely satisfied when it was so well received.

The goal was to make something that was keter, but non-violent (an atypical keter, I guess). I didn't intend for it to read as scary when I first wrote it, but it seems to have added to the skip.

Written and posted while on vacation in Boise, Idaho."[[/footnote]] ||
|| SCP is [[[SCP-3782|Roosevelt's glasses]]][[footnote]]"I intended for this to be my 4k entry, but I got cold feet after I saw the other entries. Admittedly, this didn't have much of a punch compared to some of the others. This was also alluded to in a tale I made for the GoI "AN-SO", but we aren't talking about AN-SO right now.

If I had to pick an article of mine I didn't like as much as the others, this is it. Maybe I'll go back and do more with it someday.

Posted at home from my computer."[[/footnote]] ||
|| SCP is [[[SCP-3754|phone app]]][[footnote]]"This was my contribution to [[*user Dog Teeth]]'s GoI "Accelerate The Future". I was inspired by [[*user OthellotheCat]]'s body pillow skip. I think it might also be the quickest one that I wrote. Also, [[*user Uncle Nicolini]] gave me some cool visual CSS for the reviews.

The intention with this was to make the creepiness from how people reacted to the anomaly. It's also a bit of a nod towards [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_roller whales].

Posted at work."[[/footnote]] ||
|| SCP is [[[SCP-3732|forgotten]]][[footnote]]"I sat on this one for too long. I got a few crits, did some revisions after, and then let it sit in my sandbox. I guess I got self-conscious about my initial concept and didn't want to show other people. I'm glad I posted it, though. It seems I got the reaction I wanted.

Posted from home from my computer."[[/footnote]] ||
|| Author is [[[Researcher Mathias's Colleague Protocol|me]]][[footnote]]"I don't remember having these hands. I know they look like they should be my hands, but I just woke up one day and they felt wrong. I think someone stole //my// hands and gave me these hands. I wish they would give me back my hands.

Please give me back my hands.
