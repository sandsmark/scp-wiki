title:Researcher Mathias's Colleague Protocol
**Name:** Researcher Mathias

**Security Clearance:** None

**Current Site Location:** Site-319

**Specific Colleague Protocol:** When interacting with Researcher Stuart Mathias, it is important to maintain the façade that he has any ranking within The Foundation. To aid this maintenance, the following terms are to be kept in mind:

||~ IF HE SAYS... ||~ HE IS REFERRING TO... ||
|| Office || His cell ||
|| Computer || The floor ||
|| Documents || The writing on the floor ||
|| Apartment || The far right corner with the lamp ||
|| Wristwatch || The tracking bracelet on his left arm ||

Meals are to be brought to his cell at 09:00 and 16:00. Balanced meals are preferred, but a [https://i1.wp.com/twinspiration.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/snackbars.jpg?resize=216%2C188 Philadelphia Cheesecake Bar] may be provided as a snack upon a new addition to the floor.

Watch where you step.

**Profile:** Researcher Mathias is gifted with a unique form of clairvoyance that has proven to be beneficial to Site-319. This, however, seems to have greatly skewed his awareness. No one knows how he appeared in Containment Cell-0700, nor why he insists that it is his office/apartment.

Researcher Mathias has been known to use the provided crayons to write on the floor of his cell. Whenever he points his right index finger to anything written on the floor, he will recite something pertaining to the subject from memory. There are no variations in recitations.

||~ CURRENT DOCUMENTS ||
||= SCP is [[[SCP-3757|lightning bugs]]][[footnote]]"This is by far my best work. I'm very proud of it. I remember being unreasonably anxious when I posted it and immensely satisfied when it was so well received.

The goal was to make something that was keter, but non-violent (an atypical keter, I guess). I didn't intend for it to read as scary when I first wrote it, but it seems to have added to the skip.

Written and posted while on vacation in Boise, Idaho."[[/footnote]] ||
||= SCP is [[[SCP-3782|Roosevelt's glasses]]][[footnote]]"I intended for this to be my 4k entry, but I got cold feet after I saw the other entries. Admittedly, this didn't have much of a punch compared to some of the others. This was also alluded to in a tale I made for the GoI "AN-SO", but we aren't talking about AN-SO right now.

If I had to pick an article of mine I didn't like as much as the others, this is it. Maybe I'll go back and do more with it someday.

Posted at home from my computer."[[/footnote]] ||
||= SCP is [[[SCP-3754|phone app]]][[footnote]]"This was my contribution to [[*user Dog Teeth]]'s GoI "Accelerate The Future". I was inspired by [[*user OthellotheCat]]'s body pillow skip. I think it might also be the quickest one that I wrote. Also, [[*user Uncle Nicolini]] gave me some cool visual CSS for the reviews.

The intention with this was to make the creepiness from how people reacted to the anomaly. It's also a bit of a nod towards [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_roller whales].

Posted at work."[[/footnote]] ||
||= SCP is [[[SCP-3732|forgotten]]][[footnote]]"I sat on this one for too long. I got a few crits, did some revisions after, and then let it sit in my sandbox. I guess I got self-conscious about my initial concept and didn't want to show other people. I'm glad I posted it, though. It seems I got the reaction I wanted.

Posted from home from my computer."[[/footnote]] ||
||= Author is [[[Researcher Mathias's Colleague Protocol|me]]][[footnote]]"I don't remember having these hands. I know they look like they should be my hands, but I just woke up one day and they felt wrong. I think someone stole //my// hands and gave me these hands. I wish they would give me back my hands.

Please give me back my hands.

Posted at a hospital in ████ ████████, Iowa."[[/footnote]] ||
||= SCP is [[[SCP-4837|duck]]][[footnote]] "This is my first collaborative work, and I have mixed feelings about it. The idea came after I had taken this picture of a mallard while on vacation. I posted it to SCPD and people commented that it looked like it had a quest about it, so I tried to execute it similarly.

This went through many iterations. It started out as a duck that traded mundane things for weapons (fetchquest duck) and finally became a dragon transformed into a duck that wanted to make its hoard more functional. Ultimately, it has seen mixed reviews. I don't know whether I like this work or like that I did it.

Written in two different time zones with [[*user plaguebearer]] [[/footnote]] ||
||= The Chicago Spirit is [http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-workshop Wonderous] [[footnote]] "This was a big step out of impartial tone for me. Before this, I had written three unsuccessful tales that I had self-deleted, so I was a bit averse to writing outside of SCP formats.

Thankfully, [[*user Uncle Nicolini]] invited me to do some work on this. I think we hit the right themes for this work. It's a very unique mix of criminal manipulation and Wonder™. I am very happy with how it turned out and Nico was an excellent collaborator. 10/10, would partner up again!

Posted after a coin flip." [[/footnote]] ||
||= SCP is [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3709 stapler][[footnote]]"This skip was created as a tribute to Avelar Professional Products Incorporated, a GoI created by [[*user Uncle Nicolini]] as an expression of scorn for white-collar business. My take on this is (as people have pointed out) very similar to [[[SCP-4988]]]. I wanted to express my time doing customer service work, and this was the best way for me to do it.

As one person mentioned, there is a small inconsistency in the second customer care log. I've pondered on whether I should revisit that and expand on it or correct it. I may never touch it and leave it as is.

Posted just before lunch."[[/footnote]] ||
||= MC&D is [http://www.scp-wiki.net/phoenix-a-la-mode hungry][[footnote]]"This initially started as a collab with SecretCrow, but they kind of disappeared on me. I let it stew in my sandbox before I vented my frustration to Nico, who graciously agreed to help me make it a full article. I am so heckin' pleased with how it turned out. This is probably the most off-the-rails I've gotten with an article and it was a pleasure to write.

The "customer is king" motto was something I lifted from Yakuza 0. I, uh, have been playing that quite a bit lately and the reference felt warranted.

Posted while I was sleeping."[[/footnote]] ||
||= SCP is [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4739 milk][[footnote]]"The image is a half-gallon of milk that I found in the fridge at my workplace. It had all this sticky juice stuff on the handle and, naturally, I had to take a picture. I originally posted it in a discord, allowing someone else to use it.

And then I got frustrated and decided to use it for myself because I needed to write something. I guess I didn't //need// to write something, but I felt like I did. So I did. And now this is here.

If [[*user qntm]] wants the slot, they are free to PM me about it.

Posted past its due date, moved out of annoyance."[[/footnote]] ||
||= Medici is [http://www.scp-wiki.net/goliath-circa-1505 statue][[footnote]]"Coming soon.

Posted late at night at work for [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/international-goi-contest-2019 International Group of Interest Contest 2019]."[[/footnote]] ||

Hi. If you found this, keep it a secret, okay? I just use this so I can keep track of ratings on all of my pages. I don't want to disrupt the stuff up top with listpages, you know?

[[module ListPages created_by="RockTeethMothEyes" order="created_at" limit="none" separate="no"]]

------
While I'm here, let me make something clear:

> IN THE EVENT that I am inactive from this site for five (5) years or I have died, I ask that the following stipulations be enacted:
> 
> * The slot for SCP-3732 is to be given to [[*user Agent MacLeod]].
> * All of my independent works are to be given to [[*user Rounderhouse]] 
> * Collaborative works are to be attributed to the respective co-authors.
> 
> ADDITIONALLY, IN THE EVENT of an EMERGENCY, [[*user Uncle Nicolini]] has my phone number. Should there be a legitimate, worrying concern about my whereabouts or health, contact him.
> 
> THAT IS ALL.
> ~RTME
------
Last thing, I swear. I want to tell you all how thankful I am for this community. Everyone has been so kind and patient with me and this place has affected my life in a positive way. I've been able to improve my ideas and find my creative voice through this medium, and I thank you all for the opportunity.

//You better keep this a secret, friend.//
