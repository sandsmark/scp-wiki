[[collapsible show ="Sometimes you'll wake up..." hide="Sometimes you'll wake up, and you'll feel sad"]]
You’ll look outside, and the weather is bad
You’ll comb your hair, you’ll brush your teeth
You’ll smell the air and you'll stress eat a feast
You’ll slip on your shirt, and your shoes, and your bags
You'll go through the door, and you sigh, and you sag

You’ll keep your head down and the world will look dark
But you might bump your head and look up with a start!
“There’s a doctor,” you’ll say, “dressed in colors so bright!
And they’re standing so tall, and so strong in their might!”
But they’re soft and they’re kind and they’ll take you by hand,
And they’ll whisk you away to a much better land

Filled with coasters and fire and glamor and rides
Filled with ice cream and cookies and hot dogs and pies!
And you’ll see great performers that climb onto stages
Halls filled with gadgets, great masters and pages
You’ll be pulled right out of your usual laze
You’ll shudder and twitch and you’ll stand, so amazed
“How did I never know of this,” you’ll ponder
“This world so filled with amazement and Wonder?”
[[/collapsible]]

The doctor leans down, wraps their arm around
When they open their mouth out comes Wondrous sound
“It’s nowhere new, silly, it is where you are!
You needed a break from the glum and sub-par
In the back of your room, in the back of your head
In the pages of fantasy books that you read
The world is so cluttered with sadness and waste
And it grinds ‘til your brain is a soft mushy paste
So when you need it happy, to get your hands clapping
When you need some presents in neon pink wrapping
You just close your eyes, you think of balloons
You think of big bubbly, kind squishy goons

“When your world is down and you’re needing escape,
Know in your head is a Wonderful place”

[[/=]]
Wondertainment is a manufacturer of anomalous / magical children's toys.

Wondertainment finds its roots very early in the site's history, all the way back to [[[SCP-445|Super Paper]]] in Series I. Since then, it has evolved to fit some very key concepts:

* Wondertainment is a capitalist construct.
* Wondertainment makes children's toys.
* Wondertainment is childish and playful.
* Whether or not the previous bullet point is a facade is up for debate.

Dr. Wondertainment may be a company, it may be an individual, it may be an individual that runs a company. Most important, however, is that Dr. Wondertainment is magical, and they make toys. Whether they be toys that aren't exactly safe or toys that are beyond anything a kid could ever imagine (or want), the very basics of Wondertainment is that they make toys. Interpretations range from [[[SCP-3301|being warm-hearted and kind]]] to either [[[SCP-1799|straight up terrible]]] or [[[SCP-958|more than a little misguided]]]. However their intentions / grasp on the world is perceived, they are unarguably tied to children and child-like behaviors.

So, how does one write Dr. Wondertainment? Well, trust me, I know this is going to sound stupid, but... have fun with it. Yes, you should have fun writing anything, because then what's the point? Specifically with Wondertainment though, I believe that the primary way to write it well is to not worry about logic. If you're going to write a Wondertainment toy, it has to be fuckin' //fun//. Make your reader //want// that toy. If you're going to write a tale, make it over the top. Put a [[[Assistance for the Boss Lady|shit ton of corgis]]] in it. Make there be a [[[We Just Make Toys|dictator that rules over candy]]]. Even when it gets dark, [[[Tales of Mr. Collector|hide it behind a veneer of fun]]].

When whimsy goes wrong, it's still whimsy. And Dr. Wondertainment is 100% whimsy, to its core. That's what Wondertainment is all about. If you're an aspiring Dr. Wondertainment writer, your main job is to //go nuts, kid//.
