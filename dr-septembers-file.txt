title:Dr. September's Personnel Profile
Hello, folks! I'm ObserverSeptember. I joined the wiki in 2012 and posted my first successful article in 2013. I've been writing articles on and off since then, and I'm prone to long fits of activity followed by long fits of inactivity. 

I consider myself a mid-tier author: I'm not one of the ones you think of when you think of this site, but I have a lineup of decent SCPs and a handful of highly praised ones. As you'll notice, my authorial lilt is ending my SCPs in -5, with the exception of -Js and one rewritten article. I don't use -15 (again, with the exception of one rewrite) because I like being able to audibly pronounce the -5. I'm hoping to make the [[[pdps|Public Domain Protection Service]]] into a standalone GoI - help me with them if you feel up to the task!

To toot my own horn a bit, I've been featured on the front page with [[[SCP-2135]]], and I was ahead of the curve on crosslinks with [[[SCP-2305]]] (written over a year before the wikiwalk project began). My SCPs get steadily better written from Series II to Series IV, but of course you can judge for yourself. 

If you have any questions about my SCPs, feel free to shoot me a message!
