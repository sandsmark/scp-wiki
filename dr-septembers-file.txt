**Commentary (Out of Character):**

**1365**: This is my favorite of my SCPs. I don't know why, but something about how simple it is makes it, for me, the most enjoyable thing I've written. 

**1395**: This was my first. In all honesty, it ain't that special. The dialogue is kinda hokey, and the line at the end is silly. But...this is the one. As soon as I saw it wasn't going to get deleted, my self-confidence soared into the stratosphere. This was what convinced be I could write for this site. It also has the distinction of being the first SCP I've written that was heavily altered by IRC feedback. 

**1485**: The moral of the story: "interesting" does not always mean "better". 

**1665**: Ten years from now, this is the only article of mine I'm 100% sure will still be here. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. 

**1775**: "First thing's first, think of what scares you." Working in retail for all eternity is a pretty terrifying prospect to me. I even wrote a short story about it off-site (can't link because only members of the forum can see it, sadly. 

**1835**: Gotta be honest, I hope someone makes a tale-or even better, a canon-about it. There's so much I want to explore about the world of the 1835s that I can't put into words. If you have any ideas, you have my preemptive approval to give it a shot. 

**1955**: This is...an odd one. I literally do not know how to express what I feel about it. The idea came from watching old MST3K clips, and the execution...well, //I// thought the payoff was OK, but a lot of people didn't (leading to that horribly botched experiment log). I don't love it or hate it, but I'm definitely not going to showcase this as my best work.
