**Item #:** SCP-2000

**Object Class:** Safe (Previously Euclid)

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2000 instances are to be stored in separate secure holding cells on Site-45. Requests for personal items by SCP-2000-A or SCP-2000-B may be approved by personnel with Level 3/2000 clearance or higher, provided they remain within reason. Requests for vegetation of any kind are to be denied.

SCP-2000-A is to be contained at Site-17, and placed on a desk in Secure Holding Cell B312. Requests for a new laptop computer may be approved once every five years. This computer must have speakers, and must have its wireless LAN disabled. SCP-2000-A should be granted permission to edit any files of this computer when it is introduced. SCP-2000-A is not permitted to connect to Foundation servers.

SCP-2000-B is to be contained at Site-45 in Secure Holding Cell B369, and must be fed 225 grams of goatweed (//Hypericum perforatum//) per day. Personnel are to ensure that all goatweed is consumed by SCP-2000-B before leaving SHC B369. Video surveillance of SCP-2000-B must be reviewed while interviewing SCP-2000-B to establish dialog. Interaction between SCP-2000-A and SCP-2000-B is currently being considered.

**Description:** SCP-2000 is the collective designation given to two separate entities, specifically designated SCP-2000-A and SCP-2000-B. SCP-2000 originated from the fifth underground floor of the main base of Prometheus Labs.

SCP-2000-A is a sapient 5.17 KB text file titled 'Sarah_Crowely.txt' (For a non-anomalous copy, see Addendum-2000-1). ASCII characters have been arranged in the form of a Celtic knot, which features a leporine-like face with two 'V's to represent fangs on its upper portion, and twelve characters common in [DATA EXPUNGED] on its lower portion, which appear to be critical components to the object's anomalous properties. When stored on a computer or electronic device, SCP-2000-A can change its file location, create and name folders, deny its deletion, open, close, or duplicate itself, and can speak through the computer's speakers.

SCP-2000-A can function as or replace a device's original operating system if it is either given administrative permission, or stored on a device without an OS. SCP-2000-A will fully replicate the hardware's previous operating system within 24 hours, but will alter it in order to prevent personnel from accessing it. Personnel will be unable to use the computer's keyboard and mouse, utilize any drives, or otherwise access the device without SCP-2000-A's compliance.

SCP-2000-A reports that staying in a device for prolonged periods of time gets progressively more painful the longer SCP-2000-A operates the device, and could result in SCP-2000-A losing its anomalous properties. This is expected to be related to the computer's overall age and condition, since being stored on newer models can ease its discomfort entirely, while older models only partially weaken it.

After SCP-2000-A has finished replicating a computer's OS, it will begin to personalize its desktop by organizing personal documents, images, applications, and other projects, and by altering its background image. It is unknown where SCP-2000-A has stored these files, but a large majority of them have been authored by Prometheus Labs, and are typically on the subject of restoring life through anomalous means. SCP-2000-A keeps its same background image, which appears to be a young female humanoid with features similar to a white rabbit. This humanoid has its mouth covered in what is presumed to be blood, sharp teeth, and is wearing a red bow on its left ear, and is in front of a pink, spotted background with several small hearts drawn around it.
[[include template:image-block name=Will.jpg|caption=SCP-2000-B]]
SCP-2000-B is the taxidermied, sapient skeleton of a black adolescent house cat. SCP-2000-B is held together through various methods, including leather straps, black tape, string, and super-glue, partially composed of common yarrow (Achillea millefolium). SCP-2000-B refers to itself as Dr. Will ██████, and was created by SCP-2000-A.

SCP-2000-B causes alterations in video equipment when in view, including the addition of subtitles. In addition, the appearance of any person who is shown in the video alongside SCP-2000-B will be significantly altered. The subtitles added to the feed are an intentional alteration by SCP-2000-B, which is typically used for communication purposes. All other alterations appear to be involuntary. 

When a subject is filmed and shown in the same frame as SCP-2000-B, the subject's appearance will be altered so that they appear heavily disfigured. Alterations to the subject will typically include a combination of the following:
* a large wound where the heart is located
* a missing left eye
* removal of the subject's facial epidermis
* the mouth cut to resemble a wide grin, which has been stitched closed
* minor burn marks on the arms and torso
* addition of animal-like features, such as a snout, claws, or a tail
* large portions of flesh removed from the subject's right calve
* the subjects current attire replaced with an evening gown or tuxedo, depending on gender
Visuals created by SCP-2000-B are only viewable through video surveillance, and do not appear to subjects viewing SCP-2000-B directly, or in still photography. SCP-2000-B has reported that it experienced frequent hallucinations prior to its current properties, and that they were of similar content to its video alterations. SCP-2000-B has not experienced any hallucinations while under containment.

Despite SCP-2000-B's fragile appearance, SCP-2000-B is very durable, and is capable of rapid self-repair if any part of SCP-2000-B is damaged or removed. SCP-2000-B requires a diet of goatweed, which prevents SCP-2000-B from falling apart and ceasing anomalous properties. It is currently unknown what happens to substances that pass through SCP-2000-B's jawline, but it has been proven that feeding it goatweed has increased the duration of its properties.

Both SCP-2000-A and SCP-2000-B have displayed an advanced knowledge of anomalous practices, interrogation techniques, and Foundation staff (See interview-2000-2-A and interview-2000-2-B) and procedures, and claimed to have been employed by the Foundation before anomalous properties manifested. Both entities have matched the on-site physiological profiles of Agent Crowely (SCP-2000-A) and Dr. ██████ (SCP-2000-B).

Prior to containment, SCP-2000-A downloaded itself onto twelve Prometheus security drones, which were capable of receiving verbal commands and detecting heat signatures, and prevented access to the fifth underground floor of Prometheus Labs in order for SCP-2000-A to create SCP-2000-B.

Based on the recovered floor plans, video surveillance, and accounts from surviving Prometheus personnel, this floor housed a large kennel, a large electronics sector, and a small green house. It has been noted that the animals held in the kennel were being cared for, but occasionally, a drone controlled by SCP-2000-A would carry one feline to the electronics sector, kill it, and remove the majority of its skin and organs.

All instances have been rendered inoperative since containment, due to their release from SCP-2000-A, and are currently designated under SCP-████.

[[collapsible show="[+] Interview-2000-2-A" hide="[-] Interview-2000-2-A"]]
> **Interviewed:** SCP-2000-A
>  
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Goad
> 
> **Forward:** Prior to this interview, SCP-2000-A was adjusting from its original '166MHz Pentium Multimedia System' desktop to its current Foundation NP█V██5C-███US series laptop.
>  
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Dr. Goad:** Hello SCP-2000-A. Can you hear me?
> 
> **SCP-2000-A:** Hey Deb. Yeah, I can hear you. Can you?
> 
> **Dr. Goad:** [pauses] Yes. We have some questions for you. Do you mind?
> 
> **SCP-2000-A:** No, go ahead.
> 
> **Dr. Goad:** Why were you preventing us from reaching the floor?
> 
> **SCP-2000-A:** Yeah, I'd like to apologize for that... I don't think it'd make much sense to you if I just told you. The answer to your question is that I did it to get ██████ back... The cat skeleton. I'm assuming he's SCP-2000-B now, since I'm -A, but would you mind if I went back a bit further? Back to when I got to the labs? 
> 
> **Dr. Goad:** Please.
> 
> **SCP-2000-A:** Okay. I was archived from a slip of paper that was sent to Prometheus. The text was apparently printed, and delivered to the labs from someone Prometheus knew. He must have meant something to them, cause I saw a bunch of doctors when I came to.
> 
> **Dr. Goad:** Do you know who this person was?
> 
> **SCP-2000-A:** Don't know. All I know is that he was the reason I was treated poorly... either that, or it was because I took over expensive property. Either way, they weren't all that polite.
> 
> **Dr. Goad:** You were treated poorly?
> 
> **SCP-2000-A:** No, it was more like... they didn't trust me for a long while. They weren't as excited about me as they were about how I was there. I thought it better to just comply with them, so I did everything they said, short of getting off my main body. Maybe then they'd ease up on the third degree.
> 
> Eventually they did, and started using me to test their machines. In a controlled environment, of course. The tests usually amounted to 'put this peg into this hole' or 'shoot these foam pellets at the target as accurately as possible' in some prototype machine they planned on developing, but hey, whatever helps.
> 
> Sometimes they'd give me real bullets or tech, but they'd make sure that everyone was out of the room before I got on, and that I was out of ammo before they came back. I think they were trying to replicate my effects on another computer at one point, but they must have failed, because they just ended up putting me on that one too.
> 
> **Dr. Goad:** How long were you under the care of Prometheus Labs before its closure?
> 
> **SCP-2000-A:** ...About two years, one and a half before they started testing.
> 
> **Dr. Goad:** And where were you during the event?
> 
> **SCP-2000-A:** I was in-between testing out a teleportation drone, and being inside my original device... You don't think I had something to do with that, do you? Because I didn't. That guy who sent me maybe, but [what] the hell was //I// going to do?
> 
> **Dr. Goad:** You took control of twelve advanced security drones with no operating system, and prevented us from accessing an entire floor. You're a suspect.
> 
> **SCP-2000-A:** Deb. You know I wouldn't do that. It wouldn't even make sense; If I did, I wouldn't have stayed, I wouldn't have turned myself in, and I damn sure wouldn't be talking to you right now. I would've just left, or even better, archived myself for you to find for yourselves. That's not a threat, it's a fact.
> 
> I only needed to keep y'all out so I could bring Will back, but I needed time to research the files Prometheus kept around in their library. I admit, it's possible that I could have been used as some kind of mule, but I had nothing to do with Prometheus Labs becoming a ghost town for the past ██ years.
> 
> **Dr. Goad:** Why do you care so much about Dr. ██████?
> 
> **SCP-2000-A:** [sighs] Look, he can be the biggest idiot I've ever met, but he's always had my back, so I have his. I did it because I love him, and I finally had the opportunity to do it.
> 
> **Dr. Goad:** The opportunity?
> 
> **SCP-2000-A:** To do what I did takes a lot of trial and error, very specific supplies, and a lot of dead cats, unless you know what you're doing, which I didn't. All I knew at the time was that it was doable, and I had everything I needed at that one moment, except time. All I did was buy some. I left the testing area, put myself on all the drones I could find through one of those stick things they had, and grabbed as much information as I could before secluding myself.
> 
> **Dr. Goad:** What 'stick things'?
> 
> **SCP-2000-A:** It was some kind of acronym. A uh... 'USP'? Fit inside a 'drive'?
> 
> **Dr. Goad:** ... A USB?
> 
> **SCP-2000-A:** Yeah, that's it.
> 
> **Dr. Goad:** ... Can you explain how you're able to take over a computer again?
> 
> **SCP-2000-A:** ... I said something stupid, didn't I? I don't know much about computers, I wasn't alive when this kind of stuff was around. From my perspective, when I'm given permission, I just pick up things, throw them away, and squeeze myself in the gaps. I'm sure it's supposed to be more complicated than that, but it seems fairly easy to me.
> 
> **Dr. Goad:** So you have no experience with computers?
> 
> **SCP-2000-A:** Afraid not, sorry. Will'd know more I think; it's his department after all... SCP-2000-B, I mean.
> 
> **<End Log>**

> **Interviewed:** SCP-2000-B
>  
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Goad
>  
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Dr. Goad:** Hello SCP-2000-B.
> 
> **SCP-2000-B:** Hiya Deb... Uh, do you want me to look at the camera, or you?
> 
> **Dr. Goad:** It doesn't matter.
> 
> **SCP-2000-B:** Alright then. [faces camera] So, how have you been?
> 
> **Dr. Goad:** Fine. I have some questions for you. Do you mind?
> 
> **SCP-2000-B:** No, go ahead.
> 
> **Dr. Goad:** Do you recall when SCP-2000-A created you?
> 
> **SCP-2000-B:** Revived you mean? Yes. She had a lot of trouble with it. Must have tried over a dozen times, but there was always something wrong before we got to this point.
> 
> **Dr. Goad:** Explain.
> 
> **SCP-2000-B:** Well, the first time, I couldn't move, a few times after that, I kept falling apart, and each time, she needed to get a new cat to kill. Eventually though, she got it right with this one. Don't get me wrong, I'm very appreciative, but it could've taken a month or so instead of years.
> 
> Then again, there were other things she had to consider, so I can't really blame her. Protection, previous anomalous properties, how she could do things without much heavy lifting; honestly, if we were to have switched places, I probably would have messed something up while I was focusing on getting her back.
> 
> **Dr. Goad:** Speaking of, she referred me to you when I asked her about her properties. Care to explain?
> 
> **SCP-2000-B:** Oh, yes. I'm not entirely sure, but I've figured this: she's definitely not doing any kind of hacking. The text her file's made of seems to be arranged in a pattern very similar to a few possession symbols I've seen, especially those twelve characters on her belly. Thing is though, those are //supposed// to be cognito-hazards... for people, of course, not machines.
> 
> Usually, someone'd see it, be kicked out of their body, and replaced by something else. They're rare, and easy to avoid unless you're either insane, willing, or pretty near-death. You'd basically need to give whatever's behind it permission before it can do anything, but it's total domination. Some advanced versions can hang around inside the body, and wait till a more vulnerable opportunity comes up, but those symbols take several decades to develop.
> 
> I'd say it's not really worth the effort, but that seems to be what Sarah is, or some variant, at least... What year is it again?
> 
> **Dr. Goad:** 20██.
> 
> **SCP-2000-B:** That wouldn't leave nearly enough time to make that symbol work. Someone with enough occult knowledge would either've had to been able to predict her death way in advance, and have far too much time on their hands, which I doubt, or the thing that practically invented the whole-... Wait a minute... Oh.
> 
> [SCP-2000-B's subtitles cease to be displayed. SCP-2000-B faces away from the camera for thirty three seconds.]
> 
> **Dr. Goad:** 2000-B? Your subtitles aren't being displayed anymore. Are you alright?
> 
> **SCP-2000-B:** This… This all seems a little too… perfect. Doesn’t it?
> 
> **Dr. Goad:** What do you mean?
> 
> **SCP-2000-B:** Sarah was randomly sent to Prometheus Labs, which just happens to shut down two years later? She just happens to be have the right things she needed to bring me back, then she’s practically handed everything she needs to defend herself? And then, after several tries, she settles on the version with the mutilations that’re almost exact to the injuries C██████ and I received on duty?
> 
> That doesn’t sound accidental to me; that sounds like a message.
> 
> **Dr. Goad:** So you’re thinking someone planned this?
> 
> **SCP-2000-B:** Yeah. If most of this wasn't planned, it seems like it was at least accounted for. Like I said, it seems too perfect. But that’s not it. I think it might be bigger than that… I almost don’t want to say it…
> 
> **Dr. Goad:** What is it?
> 
> **SCP-2000-B:** [pauses] I –I don’t think that’s Sarah.
