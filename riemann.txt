[[include component:image-block name=Riemann.jpg|caption=Researcher Riemann, fiercely studying some advanced math or whatever.]]

**Personnel Designation:** Researcher --Buttmunch McMathnerd-- Riemann

**Security Clearance:** Level 4ish

**Degrees and Certifications:** Advanced Mathematics, The Art of Swag, Floridaman Studies

**History:** Researcher Riemann joined the Foundation right out of grad school, which was probably a mistake considering the vast amounts of money that can be made in the math field. Word has it that sometimes he still pines after the university where he honed his skills, but others contend that he probably just misses the mad parties. 

> **Testimonials:**
>

> //--Agent Lament//

**Notes:** 

//Researcher Riemann is undoubtedly a genius and certainly well-versed in his field, but probably too masculine to keep on staff. Morale has gone way down since he showed up because, honestly, who can compete with this modern Adonis in terms of ability to woo men and women alike?//

//--Definitely Not Riemann//

//We keep getting complaints about this "Riemann" character and reports about his uncanny sex appeal, but they're all coming from the same terminal. Who is this guy?//

//--O5-8//
