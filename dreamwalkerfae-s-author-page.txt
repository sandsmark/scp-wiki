[[tab Introduction]]

Hello! My name is [[*user DreamwalkerFae]], or Fae for short. I am currently a {{Junior}} in {{High School}}. I own a pet --cockatrice-- cockatiel named Sweetpea. I am a Protestant. I live in Nevada, USA, and really enjoy learning about different cultures and traditions from around the world (especially the mythology).

Right now, I'm keeping my author page fairly simple; the things I've written, some stats, and a few of my characters that I have written/will write up. I may end up adding some author commentary and spoilers about some of my articles as time goes on and I feel up to it.

[[tab The Usual Suspects]]

**Dr. Evan M. Walker:** Works in Anomalous Relations and Negotiations. His job is either A) making sure that things run smoothly in negotiations with other anomalous groups, nations, and communities. At a previous point in his career, he worked in Anomaly Application and Interaction, figuring out how certain anomalies would react, and potentially, be used, in certain situations. He specialized in anomalous humans and sapient humanoid anomalies.

**Researcher Julius S. Walker:** Younger brother of Evan. Works in Anomaly Application and Interaction and loves what he does. Seems to get caught in anomalous crossfire slightly more than the average worker, but tends to roll with it and bounce back pretty quickly.

**Josephine Fujimoto:** An active member of the counter-SCP-2615 project. Specializes in the folklore and traditions of anomalous cultures. Also specializes in analyzing the effects of yet-to-be-captured anomalies for possible links to existing legends, then extrapolate further possible effects and possible strategies for capturing it.

**Melinda Williams:** Director of the Foundation Counterconceptual Division. very little information on her, for somewhat obvious reasons. Occasionally works with the Antimemetics Department, a least until they forget each other again.

**Skywriter:** If you see this, it means the Foundation is onto me. They managed to find a single crack in the fourth wall, and are throwing everything that they have at whatever is on the other side.

**Junior Researcher Joshua Andrews:** SCP-2712. Got stuck in the database a while back. Found... //someone// else there. They managed to find a way out.

**Quarseta-ql-Paneu:** SCP-053 about thirteen years after the time that the article was written. Reincarnation of a something from a past universe. Adopted granddaughter of Atanti. Generally sweet person. To be killed on sight.

**Atanti-ql-Paneu:** 682. Stuck here after the past version of the universe got destroyed. Has a difficult time not killing humanity on sight because of how alien we are to him. He was a traveler and adventurer in the previous universe, though he also fought in some of the wars. Somewhat reserved but good-humored when he's not around humans.

**Edrisek-tsa-Fanu:** SCP-1129. Is in the same boat as Quarseta and Atanti. Knows how to get places extremely quickly. Industrious, mute, and occasionally snarky.

**Anomalies:** All the anomalies that we have on this site fall into one of two categories: preternatural and supernatural. Preternatural anomalies are things that humanity would still consider anomalous, but can pretty much just be attributed to superscience or a part of the natural universe that humans just don't fully understand yet (we already revise about half of our scientific understanding every 20 years IRL, our lack of understanding is just somewhat more exaggerated in the Foundationverse). Supernatural anomalies are the things that actually bend and break the (few) rules of science in the universe, though they usually have "good reasons" for it. This includes things like gods and magic in the 'Verse. Even then, they operate of of one of a few universal systems other than science, and you can usually spot the patterns if you're familiar enough. Now, if the Foundation were to put the effort into understanding the internal logic behind anomalies and was less bent on "but it doesn't fit with our current understanding of !!SCIENCE!!" then they'd actually have a lot more -EXs, and their "normality" would be a lot less arbitrary. On a side not, the sum total of the different effects that anomalies and nature have on the universe tends towards balance; the universe is not likely to ever experience heat death, nor will it ever run out of all forms of life.

A good deal of internal ethics monitoring actually goes on in the Foundation. They only do what they absolutely have to to maintain safety and secrecy. While when they were first getting started, there was a good deal of demonization and dehumanization of anomalies, that's started to wear off a bit since the Foundation figured out that getting anomalies as close to liking you as is reasonably possible tends to get you more information and less containment breaches. Same thing goes for D-Class; early on, they were cannon fodder, but over time the Foundation has tried to cut back on their deaths, use them in more non-lethal ways. They no longer promise the D-Class freedom at then end of a single month, often presenting several-year terms. Once their time's up, they do release them (provided that they're not contaminated), but they [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-1188920/what-if-they-weren-t still get some use out of them.]

**GOC:** The GOC gets their views from a lot of different sources, primarily the various countries in the UN and the composite orgs which started it. Their system basically comes down to "If it can help us and isn't dangerous, use it. If it can't help us but isn't dangerous, leave it be but make sure it knows not to cause trouble. If it's dangerous but can help, you'd better make sure it won't blow up in your face. If it's just dangerous, kill it with fire."

**Serpent's Hand:** A varied group that inhabits the library. No real control over who's in or out of the group, so it ends up being more of a tagline for a slightly dysfunctional movement than anything else.

**CotBG:** They do follow //a// god. She does have humanity's best interest at heart. FLESH is evil and must be destroyed. Flesh is not actually a bad thing, at least when it's not corrupted. All three branches are actually serving the same deity, who wishes that her followers would quit squabbling long enough to get her back online.

**Prometheus Labs:** Arguably the best GoI. These are the regular guys who are at least trying to understand the world around them. The Foundation would be doing good to take a page from their book.

**GRU-P:** These guys got the short end of the stick. They were really brilliant, but were somewhat hindered by living under an oppressive government and focusing only on weapons. Many of those who defected became widely admired in the anomalous science community.

**AWCY?:** Started off as a small group in the relatively much larger but still small overall anomalous art community. These original members made really cool anomalous art just for the sake of making cool stuff. Their success drew in a much larger group. Some of them got what the movement was about, and made cool stuff. The majority were people who were trying to ride the bandwagon, and had lower morals, were obsessed with popularity, were just hipsters, or had an unhealthy obsession with dadaism. Many of the more refined and talented artists, including the original members, disowned the movement and went on to other projects, leaving AWCY? as the dysfunctional mess it is today.

**Alexylva University:** An alternate universe where high tech occurred much earlier on than here, but where ancient Greece was still able to exist. Alexander the Great became biologically immortal, defeated the planet, and was about to invade other dimensions. A coup was staged. Alexander the Great is now hibernating in a flash drive. The University began as a simple-ish place of learning, and eventually expanded to cover pretty much everything.

**Wondertainment:** Dr. Eric (yes, //that// Eric) Wondertainment is one of a rare type of reality bender who pretty much subsist on the sense of Wonder in humanity, especially children. To kids, the Wondertainment toys are great. As they begin to lose interest and wonder, their new grittier view of the world begins to bleed into the toys. Prior to his escape, Eric/Wondertainment worked for the Factory, where he picked up capitalism and a few extra tricks. Isabelle is basically what happens when the good doctor creates a copy of himself, erases all the memory's and places it in another physical form to ensure the continuation of Wonder.

**Nobody:** Nobody's can do anything, but the universe retcons itself so that whatever they did is caused by a separate series of events, like they didn't exist. The only way to stop being a Nobody is to pass it on to someone else, at which point a retcon occurs so that they always were that Nobody, and the regular version of them never existed.

**Santa Clause:** The only being in all timespace who, as the result of coincidence, has both the Nobody and the Wondertainment power sets.

**The Factory:** A condensed concept of all the bad parts of industry and ambition, grew powerful enough to break through to reality.

**UIU:** The underdogs in the anomalous world. Could actually be pretty useful if there wasn't the threat of being crushed.

**Oneiroi:** Think Serpent's Hand but with dreams.

**5th Church:** http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-1075472/the-fifth-church#post-2265405

**Chaos Insurgency:** While that was the name of a rebel group from the Foundation, it now refers to only the tactical division of the Central Insurgency, a much larger group. Basically, they really want to see how this stuff works, how it can benefit them, and don't have that many morals. On the plus side, they're pro-anomalous humans!

**Anderson:** was a failed attempt at self-revival by Anderson from the Factory. Kept most of his skills and capitalistic urges, lost most of the psychopathy.

**2615:** Are much more active than their base file implies. Have left quite a few anomalies lying around in this reality. Oh, and their changelings (The ones disguised to look like us)? They seem to be less likely to just get booted back to their half of reality.

R&D at the Foundation actually does a nice little bit of work, but most of their stuff is mothballed due to the connection to anomalies (which they're actually getting closer to figuring out) by the more conservative pack rats. The exception is when it directly aids containment, like the SRAs. On a side note, SRAs basically work by increasing the thickness of reality, making it harder for sentient organisms or machines to directly influence that area. Doesn't always protect from other things. So, in summary, the Foundation is sitting on a ridiculous amount of anomalous tech and resources that it doesn't want to use because of old taboos.

The Foundation was originally a joint initiative between 12 anomalous dealings organizations (O5-13 has always been picked out of a larger sampling group for special talents). Eventually, the groups expanded it to unite all of them.
Part of the reason that the public is still unaware of anomalies is that there have been 7 Occult Wars fought. Right now, that big magic number is being channeled in an attempt to keep the number of wars at 7. There's a few groups who want to start an 8th Occult War. If that were to happen, it would have the punch of a regular war //plus// a bonus for managing to break a cosmically enforced peace. Even if the population at large didn't find out, it would substantially change the world behind the Veil. One of the main effects would be the combination of the Foundation, GOC, and SH. This would actually be for the best, as the happy medium for dealing with anomalies in the universe really is a combination of all their ideologies; some anomalies should be free, others used, others contained, and still others destroyed.
