**Item #:** SCP-442

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-442 is to be kept away from its current owner in a secure container until being used for testing.  The current owner must have a will leaving SCP-442 to a D-class personnel.  The owner is granted a suspension of termination.  Should the D-class listed in the current owner's will be terminated or otherwise invalidated for ownership of SCP-442, a new will is to be written at the next available opportunity.

**Description:** SCP-442 is a gold-plated pocket watch three (3) centimeters in diameter with hands showing the hour and minute.  Along the edge of the watch an inscription reads, "To my good friend, a helping hand."  While no means to open SCP-442 without damaging it have been found, scans of the interior of SCP-442 have revealed nothing unusual in its workings.
    As long as SCP-442 is wound it will set itself to the correct time, crossing time zones or winding SCP-442 while it displays an incorrect time results in rapid motion to adjust itself.  The owner of SCP-442 is granted intrinsic knowledge of the time and can recite the precise time to an arbitrary precision as long as SCP-442 is on his or her person.  Additionally, the owner of SCP-442 will never be late as long as the watch remains wound and on their person.  Attempts to force the owner to be late have never succeeded while SCP-442 is wound.  When SCP-442 is left unwound or removed from the owner's person, the owner will be incapable of being on time.  The severity of incidents causing this increase as SCP-442 is left unattended, invariably becoming fatal within a week.  Ownership of SCP-442 passes through normal means, and can be sold or gifted to another party.  SCP-442 has never been left unowned, death of the previous owner results in SCP-442 instantly transferring to a new owner.  A will leaving SCP-442 to someone close to the previous owner upon their death has never failed to surface, attempts to prevent a will from coming into being have met with the same failures as attempts to make the owner of SCP-442 late.  The new owner is instantly aware of the existence of SCP-442 and is drawn to it, although the effects of owning the watch only manifest after initial contact with SCP-442.
    SCP-442 was brought into Foundation control by █████ ████, a junior technician working at Site 19 when he inherited it as a family heirloom.  ████'s superiors noticed an immediate change in work habits after he received SCP-442; ████ had a prior reputation for his lack of time management skills and was regularly written up for being late to his station.  When questioned by Dr. █████████, ████ showed SCP-442 to Dr. █████████ and said that it was a "lucky charm."  He then told Dr. █████████ pieces of family lore attached to SCP-442 which later experimentation would reveal to be mostly true.  Testing was to performed to confirm SCP status, after which its history of harmlessness was cited and ████ was allowed to maintain possession of SCP-442 on the condition he willed it to the Foundation on his death.  ████ was subject to observation and regular psychological evaluation during his possession of SCP-442, during which further effects of SCP-442 where discovered.
    Extended ownership of SCP-442 slowly rewrites the subject's personality.  Within two years, regardless of previous attitude, the owner exhibits unusually high self-control and reacts to situations in a timely manner.  ████'s motor control increased dramatically during this period, scoring in the 99 percentile of every test at the two-year mark.  During this same time the owner will become increasingly annoyed at tardiness; ████ broke ties with several friends over increasingly small infractions.  After a decade of owning SCP-442, █████ ████ had completely changed.  While ████ displayed a level of professionalism commendable of any member of the SCP staff, his private life had suffered tremendously.  Unable to tolerate tardiness, ████ had pushed away all his friends and had been diagnosed with clinical depression.  After ████ committed suicide, O5-█ reported ownership had transferred to him.  A D-class personnel was chosen for experimentation and given SCP-442.
