**Item #:** SCP-442

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedure:** The items composing SCP-442 are to be kept in the office of Dr. █████████ and are available for requisition through form [REDACTED].

**Description:** SCP-442 is a set of stem-wound pocket watches recovered from The Chaos Insurgency during [DATA EXPUNGED].  During [REDACTED] all records pertaining to SCP-442 possessed by The Chaos Insurgency were destroyed and the origin of these watches is unknown.  The watches are differentiated via designs emblazoned on the back which indicates a model number.  As an example, SCP-442-03 has a three leaf clover.  Each watch exhibits a different power, although the mechanism to activate the power is the same for all of SCP-442.  A subject may activate a watch by winding it, the effect will last as long as the watch is wound.  Others may wind the watch after the initial winding to increase its duration without falling under the same effect as the initial subject.

SCP-442-01 was destroyed during [REDACTED].  Interrogation of captured Chaos Insurgency personnel has revealed SCP-442-01 gave the subject a weak form of mind control.

SCP-442-02 is identified by a pair of doves on its back.  Subjects under the influence of SCP-442-02 become compliant to any requests made of them.  Subjects have shown awareness of their actions and will generally display distaste at losing free will.  Although SCP-442-02 has not shown any signs of enhancing the body of those effected by it, subjects have displayed above-average strength and endurance.  Examination after such displays reveal damage to the muscles and bones of the subject consistent with stress injuries.  During experimentation a subject was requested by a technician who had been left alone with the subject to "turn inside out," cleanup after [DATA EXPUNGED] was deemed sufficient punishment.

SCP-442-03 is identified by a three leaf clover on its back. It is unique among known SCP-442 in that it has an effect when left unwound in addition to its normal effect.  When wound, SCP-442 causes the subject to never be late.  No changes in behavior or activity have been noted, SCP-442 seems to just give the subject an awareness of when they must perform relevant actions in order to be on time.  When left unwound, SCP-432-03 has the opposite effect and causes the subject to always be late.  Dr. █████████ has SCP-442-03 permanently reserved, but is happy to lend it out as long as the borrower, "Isn't late giving it back."

SCP-442-04 is presumed lost or destroyed.

SCP-442-05 is identified with a laurel of five maple leafs.  When wound, SCP-442-05 creates a partially corporeal duplicate of the subject.  The duplicate can only exert about 100 newtons of force and should it receive enough trauma to impair function will disappear to be replaced with a new duplicate.  The subject has some control over the duplicate and has a general idea about what the duplicate is sensing.  Although the duplicate exhibits the same personality and memories as the subject, duplicates of subjects with cowardly dispositions have shown a willingness to enter dangerous situations at the request of the subject.

SCP-442-06 is identified by six circles arranged in a triangle.  Subjects using SCP-442-06 have their perception of time slowed to half of normal.  Measurements of initial temperature during testing has revealed subjects cool to exactly half their normal heat.  This does not last, and the subject's temperature will begin to equalize with their surroundings.  Ice crystals will form from atmospheric moisture around the subject.  Subjects suffer from overheating and without protective gear will only survive a matter of seconds under the effect of SCP-442-06.

SCP-442-07 is identified by seven swords arranged in a circle with the tips pointing in.  Subjects using SCP-442-07 perceive time at twice of normal.  As with SCP-442-06 the temperature of subjects using SCP-442-07 will have a large change in temperature followed by equalization with their surroundings.  In the case of SCP-442-07 the subject will double their temperature in kelvins and report freezing temperatures.

SCP-442-08 is [DATA EXPUNGED].

SCP-442-09 was lost by The Chaos Insurgency before [REDACTED], attempts to located it and ascertain its function have met with failure.

SCP-442-10 is identified by ten stars arranged in a circle.  The subject disappears after winding SCP-442-10, leaving it sitting on the ground.  When SCP-442-10 runs down the subject reappears wherever the watch has been moved to.  Leaving SCP-442-10 in a space with insufficient room for the subject to reappear results in [DATA EXPUNGED].
