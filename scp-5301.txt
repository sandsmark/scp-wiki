**Item #:** SCP-5301

**Object Class:** Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** The house previously containing SCP-5301 is to be barred from public access under the guise of a gas explosion. Civilians claiming to have seen anomalous activity caused by SCP-5301 are to be administered Class-A amnestics. SCP-5301 is to remain in a standard non-anomalous humanoid containment chamber at Site-24 for further examination. 

**Description:** SCP-5301 is a 47-year-old male chemist named Cecil Ganierie, who was rendered comatose after an overdose of a self-made and unstable form of amnestics. Due to SCP-5301's anomalous properties, it is currently located within the first floor bathroom of its former house in Kellhoff, Iowa. Inside this house are a high but dwindling number of translucent humanoid entities, split into the designations SCP-5301-A and SCP-5301-B. 

SCP-5301-A instances are tinted green, and resemble SCP-5301 at various points in its life. Only SCP-5301-A-##green|039## deviates from this appearance (See Addendum 5301-1). SCP-5301-B instances are tinted red, and resemble various people present in SCP-5301's life. SCP-5301-A/B instances both have similarly tinted weapons affixed to their hands, ranging from small blunt objects to heavy artillery machines. These weapons are incapable of damaging the house or the surrounding environment. Instances are only capable of vocalizing in simple phrases and aggressive cries. 

SCP-5301-A and SCP-5301-B are in a constant state of lethal conflict, each using their weapons to terminate members of the other group. Once an instance of either group is terminated, it will combust into flames the same color that denotes their respective group, and promptly demanifest. Demanifestion of SCP-5301-A/B leaves little fire damage to their surrounds. 

SCP-5301-A/B Instances leaving the vicinity of the house containing SCP-5301 will immediately demanifest in a similar manner. Attempts at relocating SCP-5301 will cause both sides to start chanting, "Stay out of this!" and to aggressively attempt to remove the offending party from the house. 

Currently, there more SCP-5301-A instances than SCP-5301-B instances.

**Addendum 5301-2 -- Update:** As of 2020/03/01, all SCP-5301-B instances have been terminated, which left five SCP-5301-A instances remaining. After celebrating for 30 minutes, the remaining instances began shaking, before abruptly detonating in an incandescent burst of green flames, destroying a majority of the house's second floor.

During an evacuation of the house, SCP-5301 regained consciousness and began speaking to Agent Moore, who was hoisting SCP-5301 out of the house at the time. The following is a log of this conversation:

SCP-5301 was then promptly relocated to Site-24 non-anomalous humanoid storage with no issue.  SCP-5301 is scheduled to be properly amnesticized and released from Foundation custody after a month of sustained non-anomalous activity and good behavior.
