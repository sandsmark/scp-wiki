++ Incident Report

**SCP Involved:** SCP- --6320--

**Date:** 6 September 2019

**Location:** ██████, Nevada, Independent Research Site-107

**Description:** On the evening of September 6, 2019, Site-107 (responsibility for the containment and research of SCP- --6320--) suffered a dimensional shift, trapping the 92 survivors inside what is presumably the extradimensional space inside the rift. All escape attempts thus far have been met with failure, but efforts will continue as long as supplies and mental fortitude may last. Every day, we stray a little farther from reality.
