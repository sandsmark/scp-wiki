**Item#:** SCP-5835

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment of SCP-5835 can only be achieved through the designation of a human subject in Foundation custody as SCP-5835-A (currently, D-69273 at Site-59 has been designated SCP-5835-A-27.)

In the event of SCP-5835 being released from SCP-5835-1, either through a Forgiveness Event or the subject's death, a new host is to be designated through the following procedure:

# A D-class staff member will be selected.[[footnote]] As of Incident-5835-51, in which Junior Researcher Jacobs was killed when a SCP-5835 manifestation interrupted her maintenance check of the SCP-████ enclosure, only D-class personnel are to be used as SCP-5835-A. [[/footnote]]
# The candidate will repeat the statement "Yellow is the ugliest color in the world, and I wish I could never, ever, ever see it again." (This statement has been determined to be the most effective in initiating SCP-5835-A.)
# Following the initial SCP-5835 manifestation event, the SCP-5835-A instance will be given preventative anger management seminars to ensure long-term containment.

**Description:** SCP-5835 is tutelary parasite[[footnote]] "...while none of these types of reality-bending entities can be traced back to a single source, tutelary parasites all share a common purpose: defenders of abstract concepts from dissent. Though apparently omniscient, their potential for direct hostility is limited..." Dr. Isaiah Henderson, __Advanced Classification of Reality Benders__, 1987 [[/footnote]] that takes the form of a male domestic canary[[footnote]] //Serinus canaria domestica// [[/footnote]]. It is capable of speech and answers to the name "Mr. Cadmium Charleston Conrad Cole the Canary-Colored Canary, Esquire", or "Cadmium" for short.

SCP-5835 appears only when a human subject expresses a desire to no longer see the color yellow. When this happens, SCP-5835 will manifest before the human subject, remove their ability to perceive yellow, then disappear. (The location of SCP-5835 between manifestation events is unknown.) Subjects have described yellow objects appearing to be white or gray.

While the perception of the color yellow is not necessary for human life[[footnote]] It should be noted that Junior Researcher Jacobs became an instance of SCP-5835-A by writing this article. [[/footnote]], SCP-5835 will continue to manifest before the subject, harassing them with facts about the color and its apparent importance. During this time, the subject is designated SCP-5835-A. 

SCP-5835 will continue its binding to SCP-5835-A until either the apology or death of the subject. Multiple instances of SCP-5835-A cannot exist at the same time. 

Additionally, as demonstrated by SCP-5835-13 and corresponding behavioral citations, SCP-5835 is unaffected by blunt-force trauma and gunfire.
