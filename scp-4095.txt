[[include component:image-block name=card.jpg|caption=Non-anomalous card of the same design as SCP-4095.]]

**Item #:** SCP-4095

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-4095 is kept in a filing cabinet in Site-73 and may be used freely by any Class 2 personnel with permission by any researcher having experience with SCP-4095.-- SCP-4095 is kept in a filing cabinet in Site-73 and may only be experimented on with Class-D subjects, or subjects who have cleared a complete psychological examination. Experimentation further requires written consent by two (2) senior researchers having prior experience with SCP-4095.

**Description:** SCP-4095 is a Valentine's day card measuring 15cm by 10cm when closed and printed on vellum cardstock. The face of the card is primarily white and depicts a cartoon owl perching on a branch with the text "Guess //whoooo//<sic> Loves You???" beside it. Thousands of cards of this model were printed by █████████ in 2002, but only SCP-4095 displays anomalous properties.

The anomalous effects of SCP-4095 are manifested when a human, hereafter SCP-4095-1, opens SCP-4095 to view its contents. For each person, SCP-4095 will contain a different handwritten list of names. SCP-4095-1 will become convinced it is a list of people who love them. In the great majority of cases, SCP-4095-1 is not surprised at the contents of the list as it regularly contains family members and romantic partners. In the remaining cases, SCP-4095-1 will firmly believe one or more names are missing. Because of the subjective nature of love, it cannot be said with certainty whether or not SCP-4095-1 is justified in their belief. --SCP-4095 does not exhibit any other anomalous properties.-- Research into the extent of the anomalous powers of SCP-4095 is ongoing, and may include decreased mental stability of SCP-4095-1 in the aforementioned cases.

__**Test 4095-A - 1/20/07**__
> **Subject:** Dr. DeForest
> **Procedure:** Dr. DeForest opened SCP-4095.
> **Results:** SCP-4095 listed Dr. DeForest's family members, wife, and children ████ DeForest, ████ DeForest, and ███ DeForest. SCP-4095 also included Dr. DeForest's own name.
> **Analysis:** SCP-4095 recognizes platonic love as well as romantic.

__**Test 4095-A1 - 9/2/10**__
> **Subject:** Dr. DeForest
> **Special Note:** Dr. DeForest's father, ██████ DeForest, died on 8/15/10, shortly before the test.
> **Procedure:** Dr. DeForest opened SCP-4095.
> **Results:** SCP-4095 contained the same names as in Test 4095-A, with the exception of the name of his father ██████ DeForest. Researchers conclude SCP-4095 will not manifest the names of the dead.

__**Test 4095-B - 2/1/07**__
> **Subject:** Drs. DeForest and Walsh
> **Procedure:** Dr. DeForest opened SCP-4095 and, without closing it, gave it to Dr. Walsh.
> **Results:** SCP-4095 only displayed the names as in the test 4095-A, Dr. DeForest's family and wife. Researchers conclude that, while open, the names on SCP-4095 do not change. It is only when closed and reopened does a transformation occur.

__**Test 4095-C - 2/15/07**__
> **Subject:** Mr. ████
> **Procedure:** Mr. ████ opened SCP-4095.
> **Results:** Mr. ████ showed great distress that the list on SCP-4095 did not contain his wife of 16 years. Without being instructed to by researchers, he opened and closed SCP-4095 multiple times rapidly, to see if this issue would be corrected. On 3/3/07, Mr. ████ was apprehended while attempting to expose his wife to SCP-████ with intent to kill her, a major breach of Foundation protocol. --Mr. ████ remains under Foundation psychological evaluation.-- Mr. ████ was found to be mentally stable and properly ejected from the Foundation for morally reprehensible behavior. Mrs. ████ was administered Class A amnestic and contains no recollection of the event - the Mr. and Mrs. ████ divorced on 4/21/07. Evaluation of the lengths of mental instability SCP-4095 can create is underway.

**Notice:** Following the events of Test 4095-C, protocol to gain permission to experiment on SCP-4095 have been tightened. These entail that the only subjects of experiments with SCP-4095 must either be Class D, or have passed extensive psychological evaluation.

__**Test 4095-D - 3/2/07**__
> **Subject:** Ms. █████
> **Special Note:** Ms. █████ is blind.
> **Procedure:** Subject opened SCP-4095.
> **Results:** The list on SCP-4095 continued to manifest as handwritten pen and not as braille, a behavior exhibited by SCP-1195. Notably, the list contained the name of Ms. █████'s seeing-eye dog, whom she claimed to have a close relationship with.

__**Test 4095-E - 3/5/07**__
> **Subject:** D-2386, convicted of patricide and arson.
> **Procedure:** D-2386 subject opened SCP-4095.
> **Results:** In an extremely unique case, the text within SCP-4095 read "No One!". Subject lacrimated profusely and asked to be terminated, a request which was denied. D-2386 later acted in intentionally dangerous and disobedient ways during testing, apparently with the intent to terminate himself. He succeeded on 3/12/07.

__**Test 4095-F - 4/23/07**__
> **Subject:** D-1995
> **Special note:** D-1995 was admitted to the Foundation alongside his wife D-1996, both convicted of ███████████
> **Procedure:** D-1995 opened SCP-4095.
> **Results:** SCP-4095 contained the names of D-1995's close family, and the name of D-1995.

__**Test 4095-F1 - 4/23/07**__
> **Subject:** D-1995
> **Procedure:** D-1995 was asked to cross out the name of D-1996 on SCP-4095 with a pen provided by researchers. Afterward, D-1996 was asked about her romantic feelings towards D-1995, who was situated in another room and did not know of the test.
> **Results:** D-1996 did not claim any change in her emotions towards D-1996. When SCP-4095 was closed and reopened, the marks made inside SCP-4095 by D-1995 did not return.

__**Test 4095-F2 - 4/24/07**__
> **Subject:** D-1995, D-1996
> **Procedure:** Over a period of many hours D-1996 was carefully administered amnestics and implanted with false memories with the intent of causing D-1996 to forget about D-1995. D-1995 was not informed of this procedure. Following this, D-1995 opened SCP-4095.
> **Results:** SCP-4095 contained the same names as in Test 4095-C, with the exception of D-1996's name. D-1995 expressed confusion and asked researchers if D-1996 had died. D-1995 also requested a pen to write D-1996's name into SCP-4095: this request was denied. D-1996 made this request repeatedly for 3 days.

**Incident Log 1:**
On 3/1/09, D-1995 [See Test 4095-F, -F1, and -C2] surreptitiously escaped from his duties while being used as a subject for SCP-████, also situated in Site-73. In the time he was not under supervision D-1995 found SCP-4095 and attempted to write D-1996's name in it. Without the aid of a writing utensil, he resorted to creating a cut on his wrist with his fingernail and writing on the inside of SCP-4095 with blood. D-1995 was terminated. When SCP-4095 was closed and reopened, the blood within disappeared.
