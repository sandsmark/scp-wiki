**Object #:** SCP-3814

**Object Class:** --Neutralized-- Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3814 has been confined to Site-91 and must only be passed onto personnel currently working there. In the event that SCP-3814 should be passed beyond the borders of Site-91 due to evacuation of personnel or other eventualities, it is to be brought back into the facility at the earliest opportunity.

Staff member who is currently designated as SCP-3814-1, has to wear an approved item distinguishing them from other on-site personnel. This item will be passed onto the next SCP-3814-1. Any one person must not stay SCP-3814-1, for longer periods of time than 24 hours. SCP-3814-1 is to be accompanied by their predecessor until SCP-3814 is passed onto another person who becomes the new SCP-3814-1, at which point they themselves become the predecessor.

--As of 06/11/2005, SCP-3814 has been reclassified as Neutralized. Former classification: Safe.-- Reclassified back to Safe. See Incident Report 3814/2

**Description:** SCP-3814 is an anomalous game of Tag affecting Foundation personnel, which is currently being confined to Foundation Site-91. 

The currently 'tagged' subject, from here on referred to as SCP-3814-1, experiences a mental compulsion to 'tag' any nearby individuals. The strength of this effect increases with time. After approximately 24 hours since tagging, most affected subjects begin to claim that it is almost impossible to resist this compulsion and can attempt to 'tag' others even in inconvenient or even dangerous situations. (See Incident Report 3814/1). 

In addition to this, SCP-3814-1 will not experience any such compulsive tendencies towards the previously 'tagged' person, thus resulting in a containment procedure which requires SCP-3814 to be accompanied by their predecessor, as it is the only person who SCP-3814 won't attempt to 'tag'. After SCP-3814 has been passed onto another person, all effects it had on SCP-3814-1 will cease. --No other effects have been observed.-- (See Incident Report 3814/2)

The rules of SCP-3814 manifest on a small piece of paper whenever a new person is 'tagged'. Once the rules are read, the paper itself is usually lost in a mysterious way. At first, attempts have been made to preserve the paper, however all have failed. These attempts have been since abandoned as the rules seem to be permanently embedded in the minds of anyone who has read them.

Following is a transcript of the rules taken directly from one of the papers before it vanished:

> You've been tagged, here's what to do now:
> # {{To tag you have to touch the person and say "Tag, you're it!"}}
> # {{You cannot tag the person who tagged you.}}
> # {{The tag MUST be passed on.}}
> Good luck!

**Addendum 3814-1:** Incident Report 3814/1
On 06/11/2005, SCP-3814-1 (at the time, Dr. Lisa Arlington) was killed during an experiment with SCP-████. [[footnote]] It appears that Dr. Arlington has overestimated her ability to resist the compulsive effect of SCP-3814 and attempted to 'tag' a D-Class personnel during the test resulting in her death. [[/footnote]]

The remnants of her body were taken care of according to standard Foundation procedure in such manners. SCP-3814 reclassified as Neutralized.

**Addendum 3814-2:** Incident Report 3814/2
On 07/11/2005, approximately 24 hours after her death, Dr. Arlington was sighted at Site-91, lying unconscious in a hallway leading to staff dormitories. Dr. Erwick called site security to aid him in relocating Dr. Arlington to on-site infirmary. Medical evaluation didn't find any abnormalities in Dr. Arlington's physiology. Following is an interview conducted by Dr. Erwick shortly after Dr. Arlington regained consciousness.

> 
> **Dr. Erwick:** No. You didn't.
> 
> **Dr. Arlington:** What?
> 
> **Dr. Erwick:** You died, Lisa. We have no clue why you appeared this morning...
> 
> //Neither participant speaks for almost twenty seconds.//
> 
> **Dr. Erwick:** I know. I couldn't believe it either, Lisa. Whatever happened is a miracle.
> 
> **Dr. Arlington:** Chris...
> 
> **Dr. Erwick:** I don't know what I would do without you...
> 
> **Dr. Arlington:** Chris!
> 
> **Dr. Erwick:** Yes?
> 
> **Dr. Arlington:** [Dr. Arlington appears to be in pain.] I think I remember something.
> 
> **Dr. Erwick:** Yes, of course. And what is it?
> 
> **Dr. Arlington:** It's- it's just a bunch of words, sentences maybe. I can't make anything of it though.
> 
> **Dr. Erwick:** Words? Can you tell me about any of these words?
> 
> **Dr. Arlington:** It's like some rules. In my mind. Gosh it hurts.
> 
> **Dr. Erwick:** We can stop if you-
> 
> **Dr. Arlington:** The tag must be passed on.
> 
> **Dr. Erwick:** Do you mean the Site-91 Tag? SCP-3814?
> 
> **Dr. Arlington:** The tag must be passed on.
> 
> **Dr. Erwick:** Lisa, you already said that.
> 
> //Dr. Arlington stays silent for another 11 seconds, then repeats herself once more.//
> 
> **Dr. Erwick:** Lisa?
> 
> //No reaction from Dr. Arlington.//
> 
> **Dr. Erwick:** Lisa? [Dr. Erwick is about to leave the room.]
> 
> **Dr. Arlington:** Wait. Chris.
> 
> //Dr. Erwick returns to Dr. Arlington.//
> 
> **Dr. Arlington:** Hold my hand, please.
> 
> **Dr. Erwick:** [Dr. Erwick makes physical contact with Dr. Arlington.] I am here for you, Lisa.
> 
> **Dr. Arlington:** . . .Tag. . . .You're it.
> 
> **Dr. Erwick:** [Dr. Erwick seems confused.] What?
> 
> //Dr. Arlington suddenly expires without any visible explanation.//
> 
> **Dr. Erwick:** Lisa? Lisa! No! Please! No- [EXPLETIVE REDACTED]
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** Dr. Erwick was removed out of the room and later questioned. It would appear that SCP-3814 grants temporal reanimation in cases where SCP-3814-1 dies before they can tag someone else. Further research denied. Status of a Safe class anomaly returned to SCP-3814. Containment Procedures updated.
