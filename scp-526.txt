**Item #:** SCP-526

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Armed Containment Area 31 has been established in a 16 km (10 mi) radius around SCP-526-1, which has been officially designated as a military weapon testing site and proving ground with a no-fly zone in effect. A company-sized element is stationed at Station 526-Alpha to observe and contain the appearance of anomalous subjects from SCP-526-1 and is authorized to use deadly force in self-defense or in order to contain SCP-526.

Approximately 30 minutes before dawn, all containment teams must be at full alert and must remain on alert until sunset or such time that all instances of SCP-526-2 have been terminated or otherwise rendered harmless. In case of overwhelming hostile contact, additional reinforcements may be requested by ACA-31 Command from Mobile Task Force Omega-15 "Valkyries", including artillery strikes and close air support if necessary.

**Description:** SCP-526-1 is a hill in the ████████ ██████ near █████████, Norway, centered at ██.███°N, █.███°E. SCP-526-1 is easily identified by a ring of nine (9) stones approximately 2 meters in height, with numerous runes inscribed on their inward surface and placed in a 10 meter radius centered on the top of the hill.

Every day at sunrise (±15 minutes), a group of individuals will appear on SCP-526-1, designated SCP-526-2, fully armed and prepared for battle. These individuals usually appear to be time-displaced, but all individuals within a single instance of SCP-526-2 will be from the same time period, and appear to in fact be from the same military unit.

Instances of SCP-526-2 have numbered from ten to three hundred, and have varied from primitive humans armed only with stone weapons to [DATA EXPUNGED]. In one instance, [DATA EXPUNGED] appeared, causing 5 casualties with [DATA EXPUNGED] before additional reinforcements were called in.

SCP-526-2 will typically fortify themselves on or around SCP-526-1, and in 92% of instances will simply remain stationary until sunset. In the remaining instances, SCP-526-2 will move away from SCP-526-1 and attempt to engage in combat with any individuals they encounter. Even when SCP-526-2 is stationary, however, SCP-526-2 will attack any individuals attempting to approach SCP-526-1. Containment teams are stationed on-site to observe SCP-526-1 and engage SCP-526-2 in case of aggression. Immediately after sunset, all instances of SCP-526-2 will disappear, whether alive or dead.

SCP-526 came to the Foundation's attention on ██/█/19██, after three individuals were hospitalized after being attacked by "a bunch of Vikings with battleaxes". Amnesiacs were administered to the survivors and any additional reports explained as a result of delusional intoxication.
