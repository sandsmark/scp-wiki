**Item #:** SCP-3034

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Three Foundation personnel are to remain on-site, with at least one employee monitoring radio frequencies for occurrences of SCP-3034. All personnel are to have at least C1 certifications in Russian. Radio equipment is to receive weekly diagnostic checks to ensure all devices are in working condition. Personnel are rotated off-site on a monthly basis. 

If, at any time, an occurrence of SCP-3034 is detected, personnel are to immediately respond on the same channel with a message in Russian: все хорошо ("All is well"). In any instance where communication is lost with the site, MTF Epsilon-10 ("Santa's Little Helpers") will be mobilized to investigate and secure the area.

Under no circumstances is on-site radio equipment to be used for any other purpose besides transmitting the phrase, "все хорошо" ("All is well"). Under no circumstances should an attempt be made to communicate with SCP-3034 (see attached incident report).

Under no circumstances are children permitted on-site.

**Description:** SCP-3034 is a reoccurring anomalous radio broadcast of unknown origin. As of this date, the transmission has only been observed within approximately --2-- 4 kilometers of Site-753 (see attached incident report). All attempts to triangulate the source of SCP-3034 have failed. Since 1964, there have been over 627 occurrences of this broadcast. They occur at apparently random intervals -- the shortest gap was two weeks, and the longest was 6 months.

All occurrences of SCP-3034 follow the same format: A synthesized musical 'tone' plays for approximately 10 seconds, followed by the voice of SCP-3034-A (estimated to be a female adolescent of Russian nationality). SCP-3034-A immediately begins to count backwards from 200 in Russian. If, during this countdown, Site-753 broadcasts "все хорошо" on the same channel, SCP-3034-A immediately stops counting. The same tone from the beginning of the broadcast plays again, and the broadcast ends. 

A notable [[file distortion_audio.mp3 | audio distortion]] occurs in the background of SCP-3034 as SCP-3034-A speaks. Attempts to analyze this distortion are ongoing (see attached audio analysis).

Testing has shown that SCP-3034 does not respond to recorded occurrences of "все хорошо". It is for this reason that personnel must be present at Site-753 at all times.

> **02/02/64**
>  After receiving word from our Russian contacts, we became aware of Site-753 -- allegedly a Russian-aligned Counting Station[[footnote]]A numbers station that typically broadcasts a series of numbers to intelligence officers of various countries.[[/footnote]]. Initial reports indicated a high probability that the site contained an anomalous entity. We set out to investigate.
>  
>  We discovered a small, abandoned radio station. After careful analysis, we determined that it had been inhabited up until a month prior to our arrival. However, no evidence existed of either a controlled or emergency evacuation; all vehicles were accounted for and no tracks were found leaving the facility.
>  
> Upon exploring the site, we discovered a well-maintained and fully-functioning radio transmitter and receiver. We also found several logbooks written in Russian; much to our surprise, the logbooks were not descriptions of broadcasts made //from// the station, but broadcasts received //by// the station. After close examination, it was determined that the oldest of these books dated back to 1947.
> 
> In addition, Agent Browning -- who is familiar with Russian -- noted several Russian phrases carved upon one of the desks next to the radio equipment. Roughly translated, they read:
>> TELL HER ALL IS WELL
>  
>> DO NOT LET HER FINISH
>  On the third day of our investigation, at approximately 0730 hours, an automated alarm sounded. We later determined this alarm is triggered whenever the radio monitoring equipment detects a signal. While seeking out the source of the alarm, we discovered an incoming broadcast; it consisted of a young female speaking in Russian. Agent Browning determined that the female was counting backwards. By this point, she had reached 75.
>  
>  After several moments of spirited debate, we determined the best course of action was to follow the instructions Browning had noticed. Agent Browning replied to the transmission with "все хорошо", which translates to "ALL IS WELL". The girl's voice immediately stopped. A tone played, and the transmission ceased.
>  
> I left Agent Browning on-site along with two other personnel, and enough rations to last them a month. I recommend constant surveillance until we determine precisely what is going on.

> **FROM:** Dr. Schulkill
> **TO:** Dr. Emerson
> 
> We've been listening to this signal for just about half a century, now. During that time, we've recorded every instance of SCP-3034 since its discovery (except the very first one; attached you'll find a mission report regarding details of this occurrence). That's more than 600 recordings.
> 
> We've explored every avenue of inqury I can think of. We can't track the signal, and Control -- quite reasonably -- doesn't want us trying to talk to it. That's why I'm contacting you.
> 
> I'm hoping with indepth vocal analysis, you'll be able to tell us more about the voice on this recording. Cross-reference it with recordings of other number stations, maybe. Or give us a geographical location based on dialect and accent -- an estimated age. Something, //anything//.
> 
> Otherwise, I'm out of ideas. All I know is that someone's broadcasting recordings of a little girl counting down to zero -- and we're all too scared to find out what happens if we let her finish.
> 
> I'm starting to wonder if this isn't some sort of elaborate prank.

> **FROM:** Dr. Emerson
> **TO:** Dr. Schulkill
>  
> The broadcasts aren't recordings.
> 
> Variations in tone, pitch, and phrasing make it clear that each instance of SCP-3034 is a new occurrence; each count-down is vocally unique. Either someone recorded this little girl counting down over and over again, hundreds of times... or she's been broadcasting these signals for over 50 years.
>  
> There's more: We've analyzed the audio distortion in the background. It appears to be more voices, only slowed down. Just like SCP-3034-A, these are vocally unique for each occurrence. Regrettably, the distortion is far too weak for us to make out what they're saying. However, the length of the broadcast seems to correlate with the strength of the distortion -- the longer the broadcast goes on, the louder the distortion becomes.
> 
> Ironically, the problem is that we're //too// good at containment: Foundation personnel mobilize so quickly that no transmission we've recorded has lasted longer than 30 seconds.  If we had longer transmissions, we might be able to extrapolate more data.
> 
> My recommendation is that you allow the signal to go on for longer than 30 seconds. Maybe then we'll be able to determine precisely what it is.

> **FROM:** Dr. Schulkill
> **TO:** Dr. Emerson
>  
> Recommendation approved. Foundation personnel have been instructed to allow the next five iterations of SCP-3034 to continue until it reaches '50'. Hopefully, this will provide enough useful data for us to analyze the distortion and figure out what the hell is going on.
> 
> I'll send you the files once we have them.

> **FROM:** Dr. Emerson
> **TO:** Dr. Schulkill
>  
> I finished analyzing three of the five files you sent.
> 
> It's just screaming. Thousands upon thousands of children, screaming. 
> 
> My previous recommendation is withdrawn. Inform your personnel to respond to any occurrence of SCP-3034 with the kill-signal immediately.

> **FROM:** Dr. Schulkill
> **TO:** Dr. Emerson
>  
> Agreed.

> On 05/17/95, Dr. Willis -- a Foundation researcher -- misappropriated radio equipment at Site-753 to conduct an unofficial experiment. During an instance of SCP-3034, she attempted to establish communication with SCP-3034-A.
> 
> SCP-3034-A stopped speaking. Approximately 5 seconds later, an extremely powerful broadcast was detected on-site. This signal consisted of a high-pitched 'shriek' which inflicted intense levels of pain, dizziness, and disorientation on all personnel who perceived it. The screech continued for a period of 25 seconds, at which point Dr. Willis managed to use Site-753's radio equipment to broadcast the kill-signal ("все хорошо"). The broadcast immediately ceased.
> 
> Within the next 24 hours, researchers noted a significant increase in missing children cases across the world. In the majority of these cases, the disappearances occurred at a time roughly correlating with the 25-second broadcast. All cases believed to be associated with SCP-3034 have remained unsolved.
> 
> Scheduled disciplinary action against Dr. Willis has been suspended in light of her recent suicide (see Attachment 2-205: Police Report). Special containment procedures have been updated to reflect the importance of not interacting with SCP-3034 outside of stated parameters.
> 
> All testing at Site-753 is suspended pending further review.

> //**Addendum (06/12/95):**// While the initial 'range' of SCP-3034 was measured to be within 2 kilometers of Site-753, observations made after this incident indicated that the range has increased to 4 kilometers. 
> 
> Audio analysis of the most recent SCP-3034 instances also indicate that the audio distortion has become significantly louder.
