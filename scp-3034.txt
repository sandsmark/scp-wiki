**Item #:** SCP-3034

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Three Foundation personnel are to remain on-site, with at least one employee monitoring radio frequencies for occurrences of SCP-3034. All personnel are to have at least C1 certifications in Russian. Radio equipment is to receive weekly diagnostic checks to ensure all devices are in working condition. Personnel are rotated off-site on a monthly basis. 

If, at any time, an occurrence of SCP-3034 is detected, personnel are to immediately respond on the same frequency with a message in Russian: все хорошо ("All is well"). In any instance where communication is lost with the site, MTF Epsilon-10 ("Santa's Little Helpers") will be mobilized to investigate and secure the area.

Under no circumstances is on-site radio equipment to be used for any other purpose besides transmitting the phrase, "все хорошо" ("All is well"). Under no circumstances should an attempt be made to communicate with SCP-3034 (see attached incident report).

Under no circumstances are children permitted on-site.

**Description:** SCP-3034 is a reoccurring anomalous radio broadcast of unknown origin. As of this date, the transmission has only been observed within approximately 2 kilometers of Provisional Site-3034. All attempts to triangulate the source of SCP-3034 have failed. Since 1964, there have been over 627 occurrences of this broadcast. They occur at apparently random intervals -- the shortest gap was two weeks, and the longest was 6 months.

All occurrences of SCP-3034 follow the same format: A synthesized musical 'tone' plays for approximately 10 seconds, followed by the voice of SCP-3034-A (estimated to be a female adolescent of Russian nationality). SCP-3034-A immediately begins to count backwards from 200 in Russian (UPDATE 2015/05/17: See attached incident report). If, during this countdown, Provisional Site-3034 broadcasts "все хорошо" on the same frequency, SCP-3034-A immediately stops counting. The same tone from the beginning of the broadcast plays again, and the broadcast ends. 

A notable [[file distortion_audio.mp3 | audio distortion]] occurs in the background of SCP-3034 as SCP-3034-A speaks. Attempts to analyze this distortion are ongoing (see attached audio analysis).

Testing has shown that SCP-3034 does not respond to recorded occurrences of "все хорошо". It is for this reason that personnel must be present at Provisional Site-3034 at all times.

> = **RECOVERY REPORT**
> ----
> **DATE:** 1964/02/02
> **RECOVERY LEAD:** Commander Robert Malthus
> **SUBJECT:** SCP-3034
> ----
> We were first made aware of the site by a defecting agent of GRU-P.[[footnote]]GRU Division "P" (Psychotronics); a Soviet organization tasked with the acquisition, study, and development of anomalies for the benefit of the USSR.[[/footnote]] Although allegedly a Russian-aligned counting station,[[footnote]]A radio station that broadcasts a series of numbers to intelligence officers for the purposes of espionage and counter-espionage operations.[[/footnote]] preliminary reports indicated a high probability of anomalous activity.
>  
> I assembled a team consisting of myself, five of my men, and Agent Browning (selected for his proficiency in several Russian dialects). Once appropriate preparations were made, we set out to investigate.
> 
> We found the site uninhabited. Evidence strongly suggests it was evacuated a week prior to our arrival. It contains several pieces of well-maintained radio equipment, a diesel generator (found running when we arrived), numerous partially burned records, and over twenty logbooks (all written in Russian). These books describe broadcasts received by the station. The oldest entry is dated to 1947.
> 
> We also found two phrases carved into a desk. Agent Browning translated them from Russian:
>> TELL HER ALL IS WELL
> 
>> DO NOT LET HER FINISH
> 
> On the second day at approx. 0730 hours, an automated alarm sounded. We later determined this alarm is triggered by incoming broadcasts. Upon activating the radio's speakers, we heard a young woman speaking in Russian. Agent Browning informed us that this woman was counting downward, and had reached '76'.
> 
> After a short debate, it was decided that the most prudent course of action would be to follow the instructions on the desk. Dr. Browning interrupted the broadcast with the provided phrase ("все хорошо", or "ALL IS WELL"). The voice stopped. A tone played, and the broadcast ceased.
> 
> I have left Agent Browning on-site along with two of my men; they have sufficient fuel and rations to last for three weeks. My recommendation is for constant surveillance until the precise nature of this anomaly can be determined.

> ----
> We've been listening to this signal for just over half a century, now. During that time, we've recorded every instance of SCP-3034 since its discovery (except the very first one; attached you'll find a mission report regarding details of this occurrence). That's over 600 recordings.
> 
> We've explored every avenue of inquiry I can think of. We can't track the signal, and upper management -- quite reasonably -- doesn't want us trying to talk to it. That's why I'm contacting you.
> 
> I'm hoping with in-depth vocal analysis, you'll be able to tell us more about the voice on this recording. Cross-reference it with recordings of other number stations, maybe. Or give us a geographical location based on dialect and accent -- an estimated age. Something, //anything//.
> 
> Otherwise, I'm out of ideas. All I know is that someone's broadcasting recordings of a little girl counting down to zero -- and we're all too scared to find out what happens if we let her finish.

> ----
> The broadcasts aren't recordings.
> 
> Variations in tone, pitch, and phrasing make it clear that each instance of SCP-3034 is a new occurrence; each count-down is vocally unique. Either someone recorded this little girl counting down over and over again, hundreds of times... or she's been broadcasting these signals for over 50 years.
>  
> There's more: We've analyzed the audio distortion in the background. It appears to be more voices, only slowed down. Just like SCP-3034-A, these are vocally unique for each occurrence. Regrettably, the distortion is far too weak for us to make out what they're saying. However, the length of the broadcast seems to correlate with the strength of the distortion -- the longer the broadcast goes on, the louder the distortion becomes.
> 
> Ironically, the problem is that we're //too// good at containment: Foundation personnel mobilize so quickly that no transmission we've recorded has lasted longer than 30 seconds.  If we had longer transmissions, we might be able to extrapolate more data.
> 
> My recommendation is that you allow the signal to go on for longer than 30 seconds. Maybe then we'll be able to determine precisely what it is.

> **DATE OF OCCURRENCE:** 2015/05/17
> ----
> A Foundation researcher assigned to SCP-3034 (Dr. Uriel Willis) misappropriated radio equipment to conduct an unofficial experiment. During an occurrence of SCP-3034, she attempted to establish communication with SCP-3034-A.
> 
> SCP-3034-A ceased counting. Approximately 5 seconds later, an extremely powerful broadcast was detected. This signal consisted of a high-pitched 'screech' which inflicted significant levels of pain, dizziness, and disorientation to all personnel present. The signal continued for a period of 25 seconds, at which point Dr. Willis used Provisional Site-3034's radio equipment to transmit the appropriate phrase ("все хорошо"). The broadcast immediately ceased.
> 
> Within the next 24 hours, researchers noted a significant increase in missing children cases across the world. In the majority of these cases, the disappearances occurred at a time roughly correlating with the 25-second broadcast. All cases believed to be associated with SCP-3034 have remained unsolved.
>  
> Disciplinary action against Dr. Willis is still under review. Special containment procedures have been updated to reflect the importance of not interacting with SCP-3034-A outside of stated parameters.
>  
> All tests regarding SCP-3034 are suspended until further notice.
