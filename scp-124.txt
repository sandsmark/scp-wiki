**Item #:** SCP-124

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-124 is to be kept in a 14'x7' stone pit in it's containment cell. The pit is five feet deep. A plastic tarp is placed over SCP-124 when it's not in use. Absolutely no biological matter is allowed within 3 feet of SCP-124 when it's not being studied. An armed guard is stationed outside SCP-124's cell at all times.

**Description:** SCP-124 is a plot of soil approximately 96 square feet in area and 490 cubic feet in size. It was recovered from a Detroit basement when authorities were notified of two teenagers using SCP-124's abilities to grow marijuana. It has been reported to be very fertile.

SCP-124 has the unique ability to grow any biological organism to it's full potiential in a relatively short amount of time (the length varies according to the complexity of the organism). Nothing growing in SCP-124 requires external nutrients or other resources (for example, a tomato plant would not require water or light). Pesticides, too, aren't needed, as SCP-124 has a repelling effect on any insects or bugs not growing in it. Any food grown in SCP-124 is reported to be of very high quality, taste, and nutrition, no matter what state the food was in before being "planted" in SCP-124.
