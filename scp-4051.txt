++++ NOTICE FROM THE OFFICE OF A RAD CRAB WITCH 

------

[[/=]]

I cannot accurately describe the sheer level of terror which overcame me when I recently saw a comment on an SCP reading by [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6RiHFLxsdcUWQZsfDi1oOg Site-42] advocating that they make a reading of this article. I was terrified because I know that this incarnation of SCP-4051 is not the best that I can do, and that I still have a long ways to go as a writer, and the idea of having a permanent record of this subpar iteration was hard to stomach.

With that being said, **SCP-4051 is currently undergoing rewrites.** I have previously put them off due to certain circumstances which have arisen in my personal life, but no longer.

Thank you, all, for enjoying my creation. I promise my very best in my works to come.

**Item #:** SCP-4051

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-4051 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment chamber and is only to be released for its scheduled therapy sessions with Dr. Yesenia. These sessions are to be performed weekly, and SCP-4051 is to be escorted by Foundation operatives armed with non-lethal weapons designed to induce paralysis and sedation.-- 

SCP-4051 is to be held in a modified, enhanced humanoid containment unit and is only to be interacted with in its scheduled therapy sessions with Dr. Yesenia. These sessions are to be performed weekly, and SCP-4051 will be communicated with via the containment unit's two-way audio-surveillance system. Modifications to SCP-4051's containment unit include a complex, interlocking system of pistons, acting as an exterior wall outside of the standard blast-proof and acid-proof steel floor, walls, and ceiling. Oversight of new designs for this piston system should be carried out by the lead researcher assigned to SCP-4051 and must be implemented monthly.

Should SCP-4051 use its anomalous ability for any reason while inside its cell, all relevant security footage must be sent immediately to the current Site Director for review.

**Description:** SCP-4051 is a male humanoid, seventeen years of age[[footnote]] As of 02/07/2013, its first birthday in Foundation custody.[[/footnote]], with the given name "Rainer ████." SCP-4051 is able to create interdimensional portals, roughly the size of its hand, through a process it claims it does not fully understand. The universes these portals lead to are populated by a theoretically infinite number of a unique item, chosen before the manifestation of the portal itself. SCP-4051 is able to remove the desired object from the extradimensional space, if it is physically able to fit through the sides of the portal. Testing has concluded that SCP-4051 is unable to alter the contents of the extradimensional space after manifestation.

SCP-4051 has been able to manifest the following items during controlled experiments overseen by Dr. Edwards at Site-17. Manifested items detailed in the relevant experiment logs below have not been listed.

* A small, weighted net, measuring 3 m^^2^^ by 2 m^^2^^.
* Several ballpoint pens and sheets of paper.
* A standard D-class uniform.
* A standard pharmaceutical container of sugar pills, although the label describes the pills as headache medication.
* A glass of drinking water.
* Approximately 3 cm^^3^^ of hydrogen gas.

SCP-4051 has either claimed or has been reported to have manifested the following items outside of experiments sanctioned by Dr. Edwards.

* A standard-issue Foundation firearm.
* An aluminum baseball bat.
* Several sheets of kevlar and an extremely adhesive glue, making serviceable armor.
* Several rolls of duct tape.
* An incendiary device and blast-proof sheet.
* A pair of binoculars.
* A small dagger.
* An unidentified amount of oil.
* Eleven instances of Class-E paracognitohazards.

SCP-4051 has been generally compliant with Foundation personnel in regards to testing and its new life in its containment unit, with the exception of one attempted containment breach on 08/17/2012.[[footnote]] See Incident Report: 4051-1. [[/footnote]] Its disposition has been described by site staff as charismatic and charming. It has been theorized that SCP-4051 has developed Stockholm Syndrome during its custody in Site-17.

--SCP-4051 has been allowed to use its anomalous abilities to assist with general repairs at Site-17.-- SCP-4051's presence outside of its containment unit has proven to be a threat to Foundation staff and the sensitive intelligence housed in [REDACTED] at Site-17.

**Recovery:** SCP-4051 was first brought to the attention of Foundation operatives in August of 2012 when a video depicting it using its anomalous abilities in its hometown of Detroit, MI, began to gain significant online attention. The video in question was titled “CRAZY SUPERHERO KID FIGHTS THUGS” and contained footage from a surveillance camera, recording SCP-4051 passing by a poorly lit alleyway at 1:14 AM, manifesting a lead pipe, and entering the alleyway. After a few seconds, several men, identified as members of a local street gang called "The Looming Shadow", run from the alley entrance and are pursued by SCP-4051. SCP-4051 then manifests a large weighted net and flings it towards the fleeing gang members, who become trapped beneath it.

Due to the low quality of the video and the darkness that obscures most of SCP-4051’s abilities, the video was generally held in online circles to be a hoax. Despite this, the video gained over two million views before warranting an intervention, following multiple testimonies by commenters of similar occurrences. [http://www.scp-wiki.net/task-forces#pi-1 Mobile Task Force Pi-1 "City Slickers"] identified SCP-4051 and performed a successful retrieval and extraction.

> __**Experiment 4051-e-1:**__
> 
> **Name:** Dr. Roswell with Dr. Edwards assisting.
> 
> **Date:** 08/15/2012
> 
> **Procedure:** SCP-4051 is to be asked to manifest several items by Dr. Roswell. The items include a crowbar, a 3 cm^^3^^ cube of lead, SCP-4051’s “favorite thing”, and a container of bleach. The experiment is to be conducted in a standard concrete observation chamber, with SCP-4051 in the room and all researchers and Foundation personnel behind a window of bullet-proof glass.
> 
> **Results:** SCP-4051 readily manifested the crowbar, which did not display any anomalous properties upon analysis. Upon the request for the cube of lead, SCP-4051 hesitated and appeared to think for approximately two seconds before removing the cube. SCP-4051 also explained that its “favorite thing” was too big to fit through its portal, and was told to manifest anything it wanted. SCP-4051 removed a framed picture of its mother. SCP-4051 expressed discomfort at being requested to remove the bleach, but complied without incident.
> 
> //**Note:** Based on SCP-4051’s behavior during the testing, it seems like it needs to have a clear mental image before it can manifest any item. More testing to determine the boundaries of its ability will follow.//
> 
> **Afterword:** SCP-4051 was escorted back to its containment unit and reportedly asked how long it would need to test its anomalous properties. Site staff have been informed that they ought to avoid the question if possible, for the continuation of SCP-4051’s compliance.

> __**Experiment 4051-e-2:**__
> 
> **Name:** Dr. Roswell with Dr. Edwards assisting.
> 
> **Date:** 08/16/2012
> 
> **Procedure:** SCP-4051 is to be asked to manifest items that were selected to test the limits of its abilities, including: a copy of Leo Tolstoy’s //War and Peace//, a photograph of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and a functioning mobile phone.
> 
> **Results:** SCP-4051 seemed confused upon the request for Tolstoy’s novel, but after a few seconds of thinking, manifested a book, approximately nine-hundred pages long, with the English words “War and Peace” written in large font on a blank cover, with Leo Tolstoy’s name misspelled as “Leo Tolestroy” beneath it. Most pages of the book were blank, except for the first three, which contained gibberish with the title repeated several times throughout. The cover, size, and page number of the novel produced do not match any version currently in print, and SCP-4051 confessed that it had neither read the novel nor “knew what it was about”.
> 
> The photograph was manifested more readily, depicting John F. Kennedy, his wife, and Texas Governor John Connally minutes before the president’s assassination. Notably, the model of the car the three are traveling in is anachronous for the time period, and several details, like the clothing of onlookers and the direction the president is facing, are incorrect. Otherwise, the photo very closely matches an existing photo taken before the assassination. SCP-4051 confirmed that it “liked history”, and had seen the photo before.
> 
> The mobile phone that was manifested appeared to be unremarkable until attempts were made to operate it, and it was revealed to be completely hollow.
> 
> //**Note:** This test heavily suggests that SCP-4051’s anomaly is based in how much it understands about the desired object. The next test should focus on having 4051 manifest nonexistent, illogical, or abstract concepts.//
> 
> **Afterword:** As SCP-4051 was being escorted back to its containment unit, it asked repeatedly how its family was, and if it could have any company as it waited for the next test. All questions were ignored by the escort team.

> __**Experiment 4051-e-3:**__
> 
> //[A transcript has been provided to supplement the following experiment.]//
> 
> **Name:** Dr. Roswell with Dr. Edwards assisting.
> 
> **Date:** 08/17/2012
> 
> **Procedure:** SCP-4051 is to be asked to manifest a circular square, the color blue, a statement that says it is false, and “^%(*)”.
> 
> **Results:** SCP-4051 responded aggressively to the requests and began to walk towards the observation window. Dr. Roswell attempted to negotiate with SCP-4051 to complete the test, and SCP-4051 manifested all specified items in rapid succession, creating multiple paracognitohazards, and a sheet of blue construction paper.

> **<Begin Log>**

> **Dr. Roswell:** We will now begin the third test. The purpose of this experiment will be to ascertain whether—
> 
> **SCP-4051:** When can I go home?
> 
> **Dr. Roswell:** Rainer, you may return home when the Foundation determines that it no longer requires your ability for research purposes. After this test, provided no new developments occur, we will begin to investigate how your anomaly functions on a scientific level.
>

> **SCP-4051:** Please, I need to see my family. Is there any way that I can talk to them? Do they even know what happened to me?

> **Dr. Roswell:** Your mother has been informed that you are engaging in a school-sanctioned college visit. Unfortunately, we can only allow communication once—
> 
> //SCP-4051 shakes its head and crosses its arms.//
> 
> **SCP-4051:** I'm not doing any more of these experiments until my mother knows what happened to me.
> 
> **Dr. Roswell:** I can communicate your wishes to my superiors as soon as this test is completed.
> 
> **SCP-4051:** Yeah, okay. Good. Do that.
> 
> **Dr. Roswell:** The requested items are a circular square, the color blue, a statement that says it’s false, and ^%(*).
> 
> //A look of confusion passes over SCP-4051’s face before it rapidly manifests all four. Due to the paradoxical nature of two of the manifested objects and the nonsensical nature of another, anyone directly observing the objects// [REDACTED]. //SCP-4051 was immediately incapacitated by attending security personnel and returned to its containment unit.//
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> //**Note:** SCP-4051 apparently has the ability to manifest non-existent concepts. Due to the effects of this experiment on// [REDACTED]//, it is unlikely testing of this nature will continue. Additionally, SCP-4051’s noncompliance may prove to be an issue. I’ll send in a request for a therapist in a bit. This could be monumental in our understanding of how gateways to other dimensions are formed, and it'd be a shame to have 4051 just be another anomaly we need to keep locked in a box. Just imagine the money we could save if we could just use it to patch up the facility. Yeah, I'll send that request now.//
> 
> //-Dr. Edwards//
> 
> **Afterword:** SCP-4051 was returned to its containment unit and the testing chamber was scrubbed of residual paradoxical contamination as per standard paracongitohazard protocol ψ-3.

> 
> **16:15 -** SCP-4051 curls over onto its side as though in pain, only its back now visible to the surveillance camera in its cell.
> 
> **16:18 -** SCP-4051 begins to make slight movements with its arms.
> 
> **16:20 -** SCP-4051 stands, revealing that it has manifested a standard Foundation firearm[[footnote]] Recovery of the item after the breach revealed that the ammunition had been replaced by rubber bullets. [[/footnote]] and covered most of its front side in small sheets of kevlar, held together by an extremely adhesive glue. Security personnel are called for assistance at this time, but are preoccupied with escorting Dr. Roswell, Dr. Edwards, and accompanying researchers from the contaminated testing chamber.
> 
> **16:21 -** SCP-4051 manifests an incendiary device and a blast-proof sheet made of an unidentified material, attaching the device to the door of its containment cell and fixing the sheet over it to contain the blast. Security personnel from another wing are notified and begin moving towards SCP-4051's location.
> 
> **16:22 -** SCP-4051 detonates the device and succeeds in breaching containment. At this time, SCP-4051 also manifests an aluminum baseball bat. SCP-4051 begins moving down the hallway, opposite the direction of the testing chamber.
> 
> **16:25 -** Security personnel make contact with SCP-4051 as it rounds a corner. A fire-fight ensues. The personnel have been advised to use projectile taser capsules for recontainment, which prove ineffective against SCP-4051's makeshift armor. The personnel are now advised to engage SCP-4051 in close-quarters combat, if possible. Multiple units of armed security personnel begin to approach SCP-4051's location.
> 
> **16:30 -** SCP-4051 inflicts an incapacitating but non-lethal injury to Operative 9760's right leg. Afterwards, it manifests a large, weighted net, presumably to trap its attackers, but is unable to throw it in the fire-fight. Nearby audio sensors indicated that it made reference to its mother multiple times under its breath.
> 
> **16:31 -** Operative 5037 succeeds in engaging SCP-4051 in close-quarters combat. SCP-4051's baseball bat proves ineffective against Operative 5037’s body armor.
> 
> **16:32 -** SCP-4051 manifests a paradox during its fight with Operative 5037. Operative 5037 reports that direct observation made him "nauseated and confused".
> 
> **16:33 -** Two other teams of security personnel converge on SCP-4051's location, and successfully incapacitate it.

**Afterword:** SCP-4051 moved to a cell fitted with acid-proof and blast-proof steel walls. No further containment breaches have been attempted.

[[collapsible show="+ Show Note from Site Director" hide="- Hide Note from Site Director"]]

> In light of yesterday's containment breach, SCP-4051 has been moved to an enhanced humanoid containment unit. Updating SCP-4051's object class to Keter has been discussed but has been decided against, since it seems like we'll be able to contain it fairly easily with the new unit. It was our fault for not considering the versatility of the anomaly.
> 
> That being said, we've concluded that it would be beneficial for Site-17 as a whole to work to better understand SCP-4051's capabilities. Multiple options are being discussed, such as using it to assist in standard repairs and maintenance, but certain influential individuals have also proposed using it to produce more valuable materials. I'd wager that most of you don't have the clearance level to know how we produce our amnestics, but suffice it to say that the procedures range from potentially unethical[[footnote]] [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3171 ACCESS DENIED, INPUT CREDENTIALS] [[/footnote]] to extremely dangerous[[footnote]] [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3000 ACCESS DENIED, INPUT CREDENTIALS] [[/footnote]] and costly.[[footnote]] [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2419 ACCESS DENIED, INPUT CREDENTIALS] [[/footnote]] The Ethics Committee has taken a particular interest in SCP-4051 and are discussing using it to produce the active agent in amnestics. As such, Dr. Edwards has been given authority as Project Director over all experimentation and research regarding SCP-4051.
> 
> All of this can only be accomplished if SCP-4051 is compliant with Foundation procedure. Anything less than absolute dedication to the Foundation will mean that SCP-4051 is not ready to assist in our directive. To accomplish this, we will begin using standard punishments and rewards to promote good behavior, and scheduled weekly sessions with an on-site therapist, Dr. Yesenia.
> 
> All personnel assigned to directly interact with SCP-4051 have been sent a copy of the updated containment procedures and other relevant materials. Our mistake was not realizing how versatile SCP-4051's anomaly was. Let's not make that mistake again.

> **Name:** Dr. Edwards
> 
> **Date:** 08/19/2012
> 
> **Procedure:** SCP-4051 is to be connected to a Hamann Reality Monitor (HRM) at its left hand. SCP-4051 will then be asked to manifest a hamster and an elephant, in order to test its ability to produce living organic material, as well as to collect data regarding the nature of the portal it opens.
> 
> **Results:** SCP-4051 hesitated for a moment before manifesting the hamster as instructed. SCP-4051 was told to pause before reaching into the portal to retrieve the hamster, and complied. The HRM successfully established a connection with the non-normative space, and SCP-4051 was instructed to retrieve the hamster. Upon manifestation into nominative reality, the hamster was observed to deviate from behavior common to the species, rarely moving or blinking. SCP-4051 offered no comment.
> 
> Dr. Edwards instructed SCP-4051 to manifest an elephant, and SCP-4051 again complied. The HRM successfully established a connection with the non-normative space, and upon being asked to retrieve the item, SCP-4051 replied, "It won't fit. The edges of the portal act like solid walls. I can only pull it out if it can fit."
> 
> //**Note:** SCP-4051's manifestation of a living organism has been contentious, but I personally believe the hamster's behavior was a result of SCP-4051's inability to imagine "life". More scientifically, however, the results from the HRM have been enlightening. Further testing will probably continue.//
> 
> **Afterword:** SCP-4051 returned to its cell without incident, but reportedly stared at the hand it used to retrieve the hamster for several minutes.

**Foreword:** SCP-4051 has not been made aware that its interaction with Dr. Yesenia is being recorded.

**<Begin Log>**

**Dr. Yesenia:** Hey, Rainer! Happy to meet you.

**SCP-4051:** Oh, hi! Are you doing alright?

**Dr. Yesenia:** I'm doing well. Most of the time, I'm talking to crazy people who just got back from a mission in the field, so having someone normal to talk with is nice.

**SCP-4051:** I'm not normal, though. That's why I'm here.

**Dr. Yesenia:** Yeah, I guess so. You can make things out of nothing, right?

**SCP-4051:** Kind of. Just small objects, like paper or food.

**Dr. Yesenia:** Or bombs?

**SCP-4051:** Yeah, um...

**Dr. Yesenia:** Dude, it's alright. I get it. Containment can be hard on people. It's easier when it's an interdimensional dream witch who wants to eat your brain, but when it comes to containing good people who want to help, things tend to go south, ethically speaking. Can I ask why you wanted to escape?

**SCP-4051:** I mean, I wanted to see my family again.

**Dr. Yesenia:** There was a note about your mother in your file. I take it you were close?

**SCP-4051:** Yeah, but can you keep this off the record?

**Dr. Yesenia:** Record?

**SCP-4051:** Yeah, like, can you not tell the guys out there about my family?

**Dr. Yesenia:** Don't worry, your secret's safe with me.

**SCP-4051:** Thank you.

**Dr. Yesenia:** You're welcome. So, you and your mother were close?

**SCP-4051:** Yeah. Goddamn, she was a fantastic woman. Sorry, //is// a fantastic woman. Dad left when I was twelve, and we've been supporting each other since.

**Dr. Yesenia:** And you miss her?

**SCP-4051:** Terribly. I wish... it doesn't matter.

**Dr. Yesenia:** I think it does. You want to see her again?

**SCP-4051:** Yeah. The weird thing is that I'm honestly not opposed to living in the Foundation.

**Dr. Yesenia:** You're not?

**SCP-4051:** Not really. I was actually hoping someone would come along who could help me understand my powers. Being the Foundation's lab rat doesn't bother me all that much, since at least I know I'm helping someone by sharing my ability. I guess I just wish it could be a different kind of arrangement. Like, I come in during the day and do tests for you, and then go home at night. Am I making any sense?

**Dr. Yesenia:** That's... well, that's just not the reaction I was expecting.

**SCP-4051:** Yeah, I guess. I'm full of surprises, apparently.

//[The remaining fifteen minutes of conversation have been declared irrelevant to SCP-4051's relationship with the Foundation. To see the extended transcript, submit a request to Site Director Graham.]//

**<End Log>**

//**Note:** This may be easier than I thought at first. Right now, effort should be made to convince SCP-4051 that the Foundation has its best interests at heart. I would like to see some modifications to its containment unit as well. Too much concrete.//

Since we already have sufficient data from the HRM, I recommended future testing be focused on determining how it uses its anomaly. Brain scans, analyzing nerves in its arm, that kinda thing.//

> __**Experiment 4051-e-9:**__
> 
> **Name:** Dr. Edwards
> 
> **Date:** 08/24/2012
> 
> **Procedure:** A mechanical arm holding a GPS tracking chip will insert the chip into SCP-4051's portal. SCP-4051 will retrieve the intended object, close the portal, and manifest the same object. Staff will determine if a signal from the tracking chip can be established.
> 
> **Results:** SCP-4051 complied with all requests and seemed invested in discovering the results. It presented its hand for the machine and produced a portal as instructed. When asked what the desired object was, as Dr. Edwards had not yet specified, SCP-4051 replied that it was the same framed picture of its mother as manifested in Experient-4051-e-1. The arm inserted the chip without incident, and the chip was observed to hang suspended in space on the other side of the portal. When a signal from the chip was received, SCP-4051 removed the picture and allowed the portal to close. The signal was lost at this time. SCP-4051 again produced the portal to manifest the picture, and a signal was reestablished, but the chip was not observed. Another GPS tracking chip was inserted by the arm, and the readout indicated that the two chips were approximately 9500 km apart from each other. SCP-4051 was instructed to close the portal and manifest another for a different object. SCP-4051 complied, and no signal from either chip was received. Upon manifesting the picture a third time, no signals were received.
> 
> //**Note:** Well, not exactly the most interesting results I could have hoped for. I'm not planning on submitting a request for more testing on the subject, but it seems like SCP-4051 may actively create the extra-dimensional space before opening a portal. Not really sure of a way we could use that.//
> 
> //Just a small note, too, but we compared the picture it manifested today to the one it manifested in Experiment-4051-e-1. The more recent one has a few changes. The hairstyle is different and a few moles are missing on her cheeks.//

**Dr. Yesenia:** So, about the experiment you did today...

**SCP-4051:** Oh, yeah, it was great! I think they put a GPS chip inside my portal to see if they could relocate it.

**Dr. Yesenia:** Did they?

**SCP-4051:** Yeah, the first time. I closed the portal and reopened it, and the chip was a long way away.

**Dr. Yesenia:** Cool! Is that what you were expecting?

**SCP-4051:** Not really. I tried testing my powers on my own, just to see what I could do. Doing something like that wasn't really feasible, so... I'm excited.

**Dr. Yesenia:** I can tell. Actually, wait, do you have any requests for testing?

**SCP-4051:** Okay, I seriously doubt you can tell Dr. Edwards what I want him to do, and he'll follow through.

**Dr. Yesenia:** Hey, I mean, it's unprofessional, but I want you to feel valued.

**SCP-4051:** It's fine, thank you. Dr. Edwards probably knows better than me anyways.

**Dr. Yesenia:** Close enough. You doing okay?

**Dr. Yesenia:** What happened?

**SCP-4051:** I talked back to a guard and they took away the desk in my room.

**Dr. Yesenia:** People get scared of what they don't understand.

**SCP-4051:** I don't think it's that. You work with stuff you don't understand all the time. It's your job to not get scared by it.

**Dr. Yesenia:** Well... do you want me to try to get it back for you?

**SCP-4051:** No. I'll try to be better. Besides, it's just a desk. I'll get it back.

**Dr. Yesenia:** So, has everything else been going alright?

**SCP-4051:** Yeah, just... I keep having these dreams.

**Dr. Yesenia:** Dreams or nightmares?

**SCP-4051:** Nightmares. You're a therapist, right?

**Dr. Yesenia:** I'm pretty sure I am.

**SCP-4051:** I'm just... I don't want to seem like a freak, alright? I know that's stupid, but I'm scared of people treating me like I'm special because of what happened with my dad.

**Dr. Yesenia:** Ah, the night he left?

**SCP-4051:** You already know about it?

**Dr. Yesenia:** The Foundation compiled an extensive record on you before we brought you in.

**SCP-4051:** That makes sense. Well, if you already--

**Dr. Yesenia:** No, please. If you want to share your own experience with me, it'll be more valuable than any police report.

**SCP-4051:** When I was locked in that closet, I felt so awful, okay? I could hear him getting the bleach from the kitchen, but I couldn't break down that damn door, no matter how hard I tried. I think that's why my nightmares are all about not being able to move as something creeps closer and closer. I couldn't keep her from being hurt, and that's sticking with me, I guess.

**Dr. Yesenia:** Does it bother you the police never caught him?

**SCP-4051:** Yeah, I think. Yeah, it bothers me that he's out there, somewhere.

**Dr. Yesenia:** Well, um... officially, I shouldn't be telling you this. But while they were compiling your file, they found your dad. He's in a prison in Arkansas, serving a life sentence for murder.

//[SCP-4051 remains silent.]//

**Dr. Yesenia:** Are you alright?

**SCP-4051:** I thought this would be more... I don't know. Sorry, it's nothing.

**SCP-4051:** I dunno. I really did like cross country. I liked seeing nature, and moving around and being active.

**Dr. Yesenia:** I get that. Are you having trouble staying in your containment unit?

**SCP-4051:** A little, I guess. It'd be nice to see something green again.

**Dr. Yesenia:** Do you want me to make a request? If I'm pushy, I might be able to get you a treadmill.

**SCP-4051:** Not if it means getting on your boss' bad side! I don't want to cause trouble.

**Dr. Yesenia:** Come on, you're not causing anyone any trouble by asking for some entertainment in your cell.

**SCP-4051:** I know that, but... I mean, am I really helping anyone?

**Dr. Yesenia:** I don't follow?

**SCP-4051:** The tests they're doing on me. Does it help anyone?

**Dr. Yesenia:** Do you want to help the Foundation, Rainer?

**SCP-4051:** I think we've established I can't break out. Isn't there some way I can at least be useful?

**Dr. Yesenia:** I see no reason why you shouldn't be. I'll file a request to the Site Director.

**SCP-4051:** A request? For what?

**Dr. Yesenia:** I can try to get them to let you help around the site. Maintenance and stuff like that.

//[SCP-4051 rises from the chair in excitement.]//

**SCP-4051:** You're serious? You can do that? You're actually going to do that?

**Dr. Yesenia:** Yeah, of course! You're a fantastic young man to speak with, and I'm sure the rest of the site will appreciate having you around.

**SCP-4051:** Oh thank god. Oh my god. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. This is... god, I get to help again. I thought I'd be stuck here and I'd just be useless again, but...

--**Addendum 4051.4:** SCP-4051 has been granted a Level 1 Security Clearance to assist Site-17 in general repairs. This does not mean SCP-4051 is allowed to wander freely around the facility. SCP-4051 will be escorted by armed personnel to areas requiring repairs once weekly.--

**Addendum 4051.5:** Table of Events between 10/10/2012 and 05/25/2013

||~ DATE ||~  ||
|| 10/10/2012 || SCP-4051 performs its first routine maintenance session. The session is uneventful. ||
|| 10/18/2012 || Dr. Yesenia requests information regarding Prodecure 350-TITYOS. Request is denied due to Dr. Yesenia's inadequate clearance level. ||
|| 11/02/2012 || Dr. Edwards announces to Site Director Graham that Procedure 350-TITYOS has produced a sufficient amount of data, such that a design for Project 350-JANUS should be proposed. ||
|| 11/07/2012 || A design for Project 350-JANUS is finalized. ||
|| 11/21/2012 || Site-17 experiences a site-wide containment breach. By chance, ██ instances of SCP-████-█ make contact with SCP-4051 while it is performing its weekly maintenance. SCP-████-█ instances initially overwhelm attending armed personnel, but are turned back by SCP-4051 when it manifests "fire", which produces a flame constantly emitting from the open portal, approximately 300°C. SCP-4051 is able to aim the fire at the SCP-████-█ instances and terminate ██ before attending personnel are able to incapacitate it and retreat to a safe location. ||
|| 11/28/2012 || Dr. Yesenia is ordered to verbally reprimand SCP-4051 for its unauthorized manifestation of an object during the containment breach the previous week. Dr. Yesenia complies, and SCP-4051 is not allowed to participate in any maintenance sessions for two months. ||
|| 02/07/2013 || SCP-4051 celebrates its first birthday in Foundation custody. Dr. Yesenia's original gift proposal of a treadmill, to be placed inside SCP-4051's cell for its entertainment, is rejected by Dr. Edwards. Dr. Yesenia's following proposal, a portable chess set, is accepted. ||
|| 02/28/2013 || SCP-████ breaches containment in the same wing as SCP-4051's containment unit. Onsite personnel are not able to enter the immediate area due to SCP-████'s anomalous effect. SCP-4051 uses the audio-surveillance system in its cell to communicate with staff, and expresses a desire to assist in recontainment, already being inside the area affected by SCP-████ and therefore not subject to its anomalous properties. SCP-4051's assistance is permitted, and SCP-4051 manifests 20 m3 of methoxyflurane. SCP-████ is incapacitated. ||
|| 03/03/2013 || A prototype of Project 350-JANUS is constructed. Testing confirms that the device is non-operational. Dr. Edwards is informed of the need for more data regarding SCP-4051's anomaly. ||
|| 03/04/2013 || Dr. Edwards requests a replacement of the incision tool used in Procedure 350-TITYOS, which had become extensively damaged by unknown means. ||
|| 04/10/2013 || Project 350-JANUS continues to produce ████████████ instead of the requested object. Dr. Edwards is given full control over the project to ensure its success. ||
|| 04/12/2013 || Dr. Yesenia requests a review by the Ethics Committee regarding Procedure 350-TITYOS. The request is denied. ||
|| 04/27/2013 || During a standard weekly maintenance session, SCP-4051 is hurt by a falling lead beam. Attending personnel request medical attention, and SCP-4051 asks permission to manifest various bandages for its wound. The request is accepted. ||
|| 05/16/2013 || Dr. Yesenia requests access to SCP-4051's medical file and is reminded of her inadequate clearance level. The request is denied. ||
|| 05/23/2013 || [DATA EXPUNGED BY ORDER OF THE ETHICS COMMITTEE] ||
|| 05/25/2013 || Project 350-JANUS successfully manifests a requested object. The machine malfunctions immediately after the manifestation, rendering it non-operable. ||
