> {{**DETAIL:** OSI "SQUID ISPOLIN" is the designation of a large paranatural entity which attacked the politically neutral state of "Hy-Brasil" on June 13th, 1988. During the attack, the entity was killed by the Global Occult Coalition but displayed several key characteristics, including:}}
> 
> * {{Extreme regeneration, quicker and more efficient than almost any previously observed. It is believed that this regeneration is a previously unobserved form of perfect regeneration, without downside.}}
>  * {{Notably,"SQUID ISPOLIN" was only terminated with a nuclear device.}}
> * {{Apparent ability to detect the aether, which was evidently used by the entity in order to hunt. This form of aether is apparently present in all life, but also present in greater volumes concerning the usage of magic.}}
> * {{"SQUID ISPOLIN" was evidently able to absorb this aether and then discharge it in the form of a fire, like that of a dragon of myth.}}
>  
> {{Earlier this December, agents of the Psychotronics Division interrupted a transport from the capitalist business entity "Marshall, Carter and Dark," which has had a long-standing ban from the Soviet Union. All product being transported was seized.}}
> 
> {{One of the products taken was a collection of twenty [[[kaiju-caviar-ocn39-t5fg6-7hjl2|eggs]]], which apparently had been collected from "SQUID ISPOLIN". Recovered documentation suggests that these eggs may be asexually hatched into new instances of "SQUID ISPOLIN".}}
> 
> {{Most notably, if an entity similar to "SQUID ISPOLIN" were to attack an American city, their only recourse for defending themselves would be to use a nuclear device upon themselves. If the Americans were forced to deploy a nuclear weapon against themselves, it would be truly devastating for morale, and would not be easily traced back to the Soviet Union.}}

**From:** Doctor Nikolaev, Prometheus Bioengineering Department

**Subject:** New Project

To Director Allen,

Once again, I must thank you for the opportunity of working at Prometheus Labs. The West is as grand as I had hoped it would be, and the facilities here are so much better funded than what I am used to. Even just the thought of having thirty years of memories stolen from me is unbearable, and being notified of such over a badly personalized form letter was insulting.

You expressed interest in the last project I was working on with Psychotronics, which had been thrown into the trash when the Soviet Union was.

Attached to this email are my research notes from that, concerning the //Crocoteuthis gigantis// specimen (as you call it). I had been working on producing new offspring from the eggs for research purposes.

My superiors in the Main Intelligence Directorate had been most interested with the idea of weaponizing them, but I feel that there is another, more promising usage. According to the documentation Prometheus has on "Elan Vital Energy" (which I had referred to as aether), you previously had not found a natural means of detected EVE.

However, the organs of the //C. gigantis// were able to respond to EVE and detect such patterns from extremely far distances - the //C. gigantis// detected the fall of Hy-Brasil from many kilometers away. That's more accurate than any EVE detectors you have in use.

These organs could be modified to be integrated within a [[[grant-request-for-investigating-the-potential-application-of|biological simulacrum]]], which would give them an additional sense with valuable field experience.

I'm very interested in being able to work on this project again - it had shown great potential in the past, and I would hate for that to go to waste.

From,
Doctor Stanislav Nikolaev, к.б.н.
