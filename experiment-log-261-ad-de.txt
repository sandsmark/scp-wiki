Three leaves were fed to subject D-3968. Subject reported loss of feeling in his limbs, displayed unusual vocal patterns, and seemed to be entering a trancelike state. Upon consuming two more leaves, the subject collapsed and went into convulsions, screaming apparent gibberish interspersed with ancient Greek of the same dialect displayed on the package. Subject continued to convulse for three minutes and twenty-four seconds, then became limp and unresponsive. Subject died two days afterward, with no signs of recovery. Analysis of leaves has shown an extremely high concentration of ethylene, a chemical compound known to cause the observed effects. How the subject spoke Delphic Greek is as yet unknown. The translation of the subject's outburst is largely nonsensical, and is available on file by request.

Package depicts a long-haired woman emerging from a locker. The woman's body has been bisected, with the lower half being completely absent. Package contained three thin wafers of black chewing gum, about the size of standard playing cards. Slight perforations across the center of the wafers allow them to be easily broken, and assumably shared. The interior of the wrapper contained a truncated version of the Japanese "Teke-Teke" legend.

**Item Description:** “Russian Roulette Drops” - A 12cm long tube, dense plastic, text in Cyrillic, but with English spelling, produced by “Red Star”.  Tube has two small pressure pads positioned to either side of one end, with a small, sealed hole on the same end, outer wrapping depicts a realistic gun barrel under the text.  Description on the package indicates item is candy, and intended to be shared among “one's most brave or foolish friends”.  Instructions are to bite down on the pressure pads, which will cause a candy to be dispensed into the mouth.

Assembled researchers, by mutual consent, began testing.  Biting on the plates causes a small, white pellet to be dispensed into the mouth, tasting “like a sugar cube”.  The outer shell dissolves within five seconds, releasing the inner filling.  It appears eight pellets are contained in the tube, and it is constructed in such a way as to discourage casual tampering.  Noted flavors include chocolate frosting, blueberry, and orange cola.

It appears that, with each tube, one pellet is designated the “kill shot”, as described on the package.  This pellet dissolves to release a liquid filling that is 85% pure capsaicin, the remainder being a dense form of syrup which causes great difficulty in immediately neutralizing the substance.  Dr. Henjik received the “kill shot”, and was remanded to medical for breathing issues and possible allergic reaction.  Full recovery was declared after four hours, no additional anomalous properties noted.

Bottle has a standard twist-off metal cap, and appears to have been made in Japan for the US market.  Liquid is mostly clear with a slightly blue tint.  Liquid is uncarbonated and very sweet, also including a vague berry flavor (which could not be determined) and a slight taste of salt.  Researchers described it as somewhat similar to a sports drink, and testing indicated a similar composition to several commercially available sports drinks, with a marked higher content of sugar and sodium.  Texture is slightly syrupy, and will leave a sticky residue on surfaces.

No additional anomalous properties noted; however, it has been observed that those who reported the highest enjoyment of the item also scored the highest on the TSR-88 Cruelty Index during annual testing.  Investigation in to possible relationship is ongoing.
