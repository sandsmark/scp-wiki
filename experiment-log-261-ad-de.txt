D-20883 verbally expressed their incredulity at the tedium of the task but complied, counting one thousand (1000) grains of the solid.  D-20883 subsequently instructed to consume one grain at a time and describe the flavor. Each of the 1000 grains was invariably described by D-20883 as “salty” or some variation thereof, despite requests for more detailed descriptions. When provided with water following the experiment, D-20883 voiced complaints that it tasted “salty”. Subject claimed that their symptoms persisted for all food or drink, regardless of composition, until their termination. All experiment materials were tested for anomalous compounds but only traces of ordinary table salt were found.

**Item description:** Machine shook violently for approximately one (1) minute before dispensing a large foil package with art depicting a rolling pastoral countryside with a flaming human shaped figure in the background, as if far away. Welsh writing on the package was loosely translated (the writing did not quite seem to correspond exactly to modern Welsh) to say: "They will make a little one, this will offering to them to you!" and then in larger text "Thatch man village!" The package was opened revealing a primitive hillside village full of small figurines of people. Instructions on the back of the package were followed, and the village was misted with water. After approximately five (5) minutes, the village became "real" down to the grass, and the people went about with their business. After approximately three (3) hours a large group of villagers started to congregate in a single area and build a wicker man out of a large amount of wood they produced from their homes, the source of this wood is unknown as the amount of wood that came out of the homes had a total volume greater than that of the homes. Upon completion of the wicker man, the people set it on fire. All nearby personnel who inhaled the smoke reported feeling well fed. Shortly after the wicker man burned completely, the village crumbled into dust.

**Item Description:** “Dark Surprise Gum” - Small cellophane packet, Japanese kanji text, but with a significant amount of  Japanese internet slang terms, produced by “Hello Okashi”  Package depicts a bleeding, long-haired ghostly woman reaching out from a school locker.  Opening the package revealed three smaller individually wrapped wafers, the approximate dimensions of a standard playing card.  Unwrapping one of the packages revealed a thin wafer of black chewing gum, while the inside of the wrapper was covered with kanji, and a depiction of a feral dog with a distorted, human-like face.  The text related a truncated and gruesome version of the “Jinmenken” or human-faced dog legend.  The gum itself had a mild anise flavor, and was described as rather gritty and unpleasant by Dr. Allok, the consumer.

Approximately one hour after consuming the gum, Dr. Allok began to behave erratically.  Over a space of ten minutes, he became increasingly agitated, stating that he saw movement from the corner of his eye, heard odd and unsettling sounds, and felt intensely observed.  At the end of the ten minutes, Dr. Allok abruptly screamed, recoiled from an unseen force, and fell to the ground.  After recovery, and a in-depth sweep by security, Dr. Allok stated that a warped, decayed human-faced dog had suddenly pushed open the test chamber door, howled or screamed, and then charged at him.  No other members of staff or security observed this, and no sensors or security alarms had been tripped.  After recovery, there was no additional effect.

It has been determined that the gum causes a timed hallucination related to the story on the wrapper.  Approximately half of the gum wafer is required to trigger the effect, and judging by perforations along the center of the wafer, the gum is intended to be shared.  How such a directed and structured hallucination is caused is still being reviewed, however it is not purely a chemical process, and there appear to be no lingering effects beyond mild paranoia, which varies by individual.  Additional wafers relate stories of a unknown, obsessive stalker who committed suicide to better follow the reader, and a spirit of a horribly deformed baby seeking the reader to kill and eat.  Both produce associated hallucinations.

//Notes – I am not too proud to admit, I shat myself just a little.  I tell you, I could smell that damned thing.  Putting aside the direct applications, if we can figure out how it works, we could advance the whole body of amnisatic research by twenty years.//

**Item Description:** “CoCo Calavera”- A brightly colored cellophane pouch, with patterns associated with the “Día de Muerto” Day of the Dead celebration in Mexico, text in modern Spanish, no manufacturer information.  The label provides a short description of the holiday, and the tradition of candy skulls made and consumed on that day.  The package is secured by a simple twist-tie.  Inside is a small, three-dimensional candy skull, decorated with red royal icing in traditional patterns.  It differs from traditional candy skulls on several points.  Only one single color, red, is used for decoration.  The skull itself is a very dark brown, and appears to have horns sweeping back along the skull, along with sharpened teeth.

The primary difference is, while traditional skulls are made primarily of sugar, this one appears to be made of pure crystallized coco.  The structure is identical to that of granulated sugar, but there is no actual sugar present in the skull.  The coco itself is not related to any recorded breeds of coco plants, and this may be the reason behind the hereto unobserved crystallization process.  The skull itself is described as very bitter, with a sharp taste of chili peppers.

//Notes – There's something bothering me about this one.  Can't put my finger fully on it, just something off about a black and red horned skull, maybe.  How it manages to look exactly like sugar is another question.//

**Item Description:** “Russian Roulette Drops” - A 12cm long tube, dense plastic, text in Cyrillic, but with English spelling, produced by “Red Star”.  Tube has two small pressure pads positioned to either side of one end, with a small, sealed hole on the same end, outer wrapping depicts a realistic gun barrel under the text.  Description on the package indicates item is candy, and intended to be shared among “one's most brave or foolish friends”.  Instructions are to bite down on the pressure pads, which will cause a candy to be dispensed into the mouth.

Assembled researchers, by mutual consent, began testing.  Biting on the plates causes a small, white pellet to be dispensed into the mouth, tasting “like a sugar cube”.  The outer shell dissolves within five seconds, releasing the inner filling.  It appears eight pellets are contained in the tube, and it is constructed in such a way as to discourage casual tampering.  Noted flavors include chocolate frosting, blueberry, and orange cola.

It appears that, with each tube, one pellet is designated the “kill shot”, as described on the package.  This pellet dissolves to release a liquid filling that is 85% pure capsaicin, the remainder being a dense form of syrup which causes great difficulty in immediately neutralizing the substance.  Dr. Henjik received the “kill shot”, and was remanded to medical for breathing issues and possible allergic reaction.  Full recovery was declared after four hours, no additional anomalous properties noted.

//Notes – Dr. Henjik is a great big baby.//

**Item Description:** “Cute Girl's Tears” - Glass soda bottle, blue tint to the glass, a beveled texture along the main body, text in english and japanese, no identifiable manufacturer.  Item's label depicts a young girl, drawn in the anime style, with blue hair and blue eyes.  She appears to be in distress or discomfort, and is crying vigorously.  Character matches no current or discontinued entertainment form, nor has the art style matched with any known artist.  Item appears to be part of a set, with the label encouraging to try “Cute Boy's Tears” and “Sister's Tears”, however no items matching this description have been noted.

Bottle has a standard twist-off metal cap, and appears to have been made in Japan for the US market.  Liquid is mostly clear with a slightly blue tint.  Liquid is uncarbonated and very sweet, also including a vague berry flavor (which could not be determined) and a slight taste of salt.  Researchers described it as somewhat similar to a sports drink, and testing indicated a similar composition to several commercially available sports drinks, with a marked higher content of sugar and sodium.  Texture is slightly syrupy, and will leave a sticky residue on surfaces.

No additional anomalous properties noted, however it has been observed that those who reported the highest enjoyment of the item also scored the highest on the TSR-88 Cruelty Index during annual testing.  Investigation in to possible relationship is ongoing.

//Notes – I don't give a damn what they say I scored, that stuff was delicious and worth it for the bottle alone.  Isn't there some kind of personalized soda service somewhere?  I'm ordering this.//

//Addendum – request was denied.//

**Item description:** <Unknown> - a small box-shaped package, with no noticeable outer markings save for the words “Prototype 3” written in black pen on the side. When opened, it contained a small black box, of similar dimensions to a portable television. With the box also came a container, which held a hundred different disk storage system cards resembling Zip Drives. Ninety of those disks came with a picture depicting either a random fruit or vegetable, while the remaining ten disks were white in color, and showed different graphics of chopping up food. Packaging also contained an charger designed to power up the box, although it was found to have been pre-charged prior to packaging. The box only contained two separate slots and two buttons - white and red in color - as well as what appeared to be a lens used in holographic technology.

When the D-Class assigned to testing pressed the red button, the lens flashed on and showed a blank display. When he inserted a card depicting an apple into the top slot, the image of an apple suddenly appeared on the display, although completely permeable by solid material. Although inserting other cards with fruits and vegetables into the top slot had no effect on the image coming from the lens, when the D-Class inserted a white card depicting a person using a knife in a slicing motion, the image changed to that of a bunch of apple slices in a bowl, with the display image having increased somewhat. However, the image was still untouchable.

When the D-Class pressed the white button, a side compartment opened and a tool resembling a spork popped out. Said tool consisted of an (as of yet) unknown vaporous gas structure, but was solid to the touch, albeit a bit cool. When the utensil met the displayed image, a separate holographic image of a sliced apple appeared on the end of it out of the main display, which Petard was able to bring to his mouth and eat. Though the utensil appeared to have taken a piece out of the holographic image from the box, upon him eating the “apple slice” the image reformed.

The D-Class said shortly afterwards that although he was unable to properly eat the “slice”, he was able to feel its texture and flavor in his mouth, and was also able to swallow it. After about ten minutes of repeatedly eating “apple slices”, the D-Class put down the utensil, stating that he was full. Testing will resume the following day.
