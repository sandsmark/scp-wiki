**Item description:** Small cylinder covered in crosshatching lines of varying configuration; appears to be a form of writing. Bright purple and green wrapping bears drawing of a vaguely humanoid yellow figure with what appears to be two mouths. Removing cap produces a sudden gush of gray-violet foam; Dr. Hooper dropped the tube and ran to the chemical wash, stating that it was burning his hands. The foam was found to be acidic, and contain significant amounts of capsaicin. The latter was more responsible for the burning sensation than the former. When analyzed, the foam was shown to contain massive amounts of Riboflavin and B6, but no other B complex vitamins, or other vitamins whatsoever. It did contain trace amounts of arsenic and methane, as well as a few minerals that were currently unknown; unfortunately, the sample was lost when the foam dissolved after a few hours.

The only difference in appearance is in the mascot on the box - he has red skin and takes on a vaguely demonic look. Acting on a hunch, Agent Sciutto refrained from consuming these herself and instead tested them on a Class D subject. It was revealed that once the lid of the Prangles is unsealed, or "popped", the subject is literally unable to prevent herself from eating the chips continuously. Moreover, the tube appears to be bottomless in nature, as the subject has been eating for several days at time of writing and shows no sign of slowing down. While the chips appear to be normal Pringles, the side-effects of such an unhealthy diet are already starting to manifest. This is the second subject to be tested; the first one continued eating even after termination, and the tube had to be forcibly removed from her grasp.

**Item description:** A 6-inch-long figurine of SCP-682, which upon being removed from the vending machine (with Dr. ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà at a safe distance) became animate and started to do an apparent barbershop routine, dancing with a suddenly materializing cane and hat upon the counter. Music came from an unidentified source and resembled a standard barbershop routine, but those present were unable to place the singers. Nearby security personnel ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà opened fire upon the figurine in a panic. Bullets observed to cause no effect, being absorbed into the figurine. Figurine stopped dancing and music ceased after approximately two minutes, falling lifeless after a final pose. Item not consumed, but tests revealed it to be made of caramel. Further chemical analysis revealed that the caramel was contaminated with large amounts of arsenic and ricin poison. Item also contained intact, expended 9mm JHP rounds, having apparently "healed" the wounds but not removed the bullets. Item disposed of.

There is more dark green text below the picture that reads, ‚ÄúNow With Shorter Gestational Period!‚Äù The back of the box features a three panel comic with three human characters (two females and one male) in a domestic living room setting. In the first panel the female character on the right end of the panel has a speech bubble over her head, reading, ‚ÄúMom and Dad, I have something to tell you‚Ä¶I‚Äôm pregnant.‚Äù The second panel shows the shocked faces of the parent characters in the middle of the panel, with a speech bubble over ‚ÄòDad‚Äô reading, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe this!

The fetus is still attached to what appears to be an umbilical cord.

¬†¬†¬†¬†Opening the box revealed a device similar to a catheter. The attached tube held a dark jelly-type substance. Instructions printed on the side of the device describ the standard process used for artificial insemination. The catheter was administered to a D-Class personnel whose records indicated had given birth before. One (1) week into observation the subject reported feeling intermittent abdominal cramping and subsequent inspection revealed the Subject was already exhibiting slight distention of the stomach. An ultrasound was performed at the end of week two (2) and showed normal fetal development one would expect to see in a first ultrasound, albeit much sooner. Cramping pains and distention increased significantly over the next week. Subject went into labor three (3) weeks and (2) days into the test. Subject appeared to be in above normal pain. Epidural was administered. Twenty-four (24) minutes into labor the stillborn fetus exited the Subject. Subject expired seven (7) minutes later. Autopsy of the fetus revealed gummy organs of different colors and presumably flavors and a circulatory system filled with a syrup of some kind, along with a licorice umbilical cord filled with flavored soda water. The fetus and its components were cut up and presented to two (2) D-Class who had no knowledge of the test. All components were described as tasting very good and were said to be similar in taste to several known products.

Book is ten by fifteen cm (10x15 cm) and two hundred and sixty-seven (267) pages from cover the back. Graphics on the cover of the book depict a Caucasian male, roughly sixteen (16) years of age, in a field, surrounded by over grown grasses. He has his back to a warped and leafless tree; all branches above the trunk show scorching. The blurb on the reverse of the cover reads unknown symbols in a seemingly unorganized pattern. Bar code matches no known product; a price tag reads ''999 yen, what a bargain!''. Copyright: 4/5/12. Author's note reads [DATA REDACTED].

The book harbored no immediate special properties. Agent Jenner tore a corner of one of the pages and put it in her mouth; noted - //''A book? Doesn't taste like anything. Might as well read it.''//. A week later, Agent Jenner recorded anomalous effects from reading the book - //''It's an amazing book, only half way through and I love it!

No cover art, author, publisher, blurb, bar code, or price tag can be found on the cover. All seventy-five pages are content, no author's note or copyright page included.

Each page had a different letter, upper and lower case if possible, a food or drink that started with the letter in the letter's language, English, Japanese, Spanish and English Braille, and a picture of said food. Letters order chronologically as twenty-six (26) English alphabet letters, twenty-four (24) Greek alphabet letters, twenty (20) Japanese symbols for different foods and drink and five (5) unknown symbols, similar to those in the blurb of ''Aurthers Willow Tree''. When read by Agent Jenner, foods were tasted by the reader corresponding to that on the page, much like in the previous test. Foods included: jam (Jj), wine (EŒµ, ·ºïœÅœÄŒπœÇ ,epsilon), rice (Á®≤) and [DATA EXPUNGED] (‚ñà).
