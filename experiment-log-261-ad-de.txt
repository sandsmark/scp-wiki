Japanese packaging bearing the logo of the band Offspring and tiny, super-deformed likenesses of the band smashing a generic salaryman's head with jackhammers. Candy appeared to be gummi shot glasses full of various solid color gummi. Taste varied from candy to candy, but was generally "extremely sweet". Candy was examined and shown to have no alcoholic content, despite slight flavor that insinuated otherwise. Ingredient list on back listed only "HATRED AND VITRIOL" in English; no other ingredients listed anywhere on package in any language, although note on the underside of the package states that the candy may aggravate dairy allergies.

**Item description:** Small cylinder covered in crosshatching lines of varying configuration; appears to be a form of writing. Bright purple and green wrapping bears drawing of a vaguely humanoid yellow figure with what appears to be two mouths. Removing cap produces a sudden gush of gray-violet foam; Dr. Hooper dropped the tube then and ran to the chemical wash, stating that it was burning his hands. The foam was found to be acidic, and contain significant amounts of capsaicin. The latter was more responsible for the burning sensation than the former. When analyzed, the foam was shown to contain massive amounts of Riboflavin and B6, but no other B complex vitamins, or other vitamins whatsoever. It did contain trace amounts of arsenic and methane, as well as a few minerals that were currently unknown; unfortunately, the sample was lost when the foam dissolved after a few hours.

Can contains five small, three-legged crab-like creatures with tiny claws and large, dewy eyes. When released, they leap up and down ecstatically, clicking their claws and screaming, “Eat me!” over and over again in shrill, high-pitched voices. If subject delays or refuses to eat them, the “Eetmees” become more and more desperate, climbing on each other’s shoulders and even leaping at the subject to force their way into the subject’s mouth. When chewed, the creatures shriek in joy and delight, even going “weeee” as they are swallowed. Prof. Snider was quoted to describe the creatures as “tasty, but disturbing.”

The only difference in appearance is in the mascot on the box - he has red skin and takes on a vaguely demonic look. Acting on a hunch, Agent Sciutto refrained from consuming these herself and instead tested them on a Class D subject. It was revealed that once the lid of the Prangles is unsealed, or "popped", the subject is literally unable to prevent herself from eating the chips continuously. Moreover, the tube appears to be bottomless in nature, as the subject has been eating for several days at time of writing and shows no sign of slowing down. While the chips appear to be normal Pringles, the side-effects of such an unhealthy diet are already starting to manifest. This is the second subject to be tested; the first one continued eating even after termination, and the tube had to be forcibly removed from her grasp.

**Item Description:** "Meal Explosion Nugget!" A thumb-sized red plastic container, shaped like a pill, marked with English logo and Portuguese instructions and nutrition facts in extremely small print.
