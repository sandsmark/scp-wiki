**Item description:** Plain cardboard box with rip-top opening, 5 x 5 x 10 cm, 2.5 kg. No labeling anywhere on packaging. Shaking the box indicated that it was most likely filled with a granular material such as sand or dirt. After relocating object to lab, attempted opening by Class D personnel. Upon pulling of rip-top the apparent expulsion of sand and unfinished diamonds ensued. Object filled lab to a depth of approx. 0.5 m until it exhausted itself. Apparent volume is 50 m^^3^^ of material. Shovels, buckets, dump truck, and additional Class D personnel requested for immediate transfer to larger lab for analysis. Box seems normal in dimensions after cursory inspection.

**Item Description:** At first, no object was seen delivered from SCP-261; an investigation of the delivery tray did discover a tiny package roughly 1cm square. Object was moved to a lab where microscopic analysis revealed the packaging to be standard cellophane with the word "Nanosnax" on the front in English. The remainder of the writing on the packaging consisted of a series of numbers and letters corresponding to hexadecimal, though with no known relation to any language. Inside the packaging was a small circular wafer; analysis revealed the wafer to be pure silicon. Wafer and packaging have been retained for further research.
**Note:** Several of the hexadecimal numbers on the package have been positively identified as op-codes for the MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor; the remaining hexadecimal numbers have yet to be identified and do not correspond to any op-codes of any known microprocessor.

**Item description:** 5ml round-bottom flask with short neck, capped with rubber stopper, partially filled with grains of a white crystalline solid. Item included a round pair of translucent-purple, plastic forceps wrapped around the spherical body of the flask, kept in place by a plastic wrapper. Packaging labeled in Japanese, translated as “Ball of Boredom”, with English instructions that read as follows, “This is a package for best results using forceps. One, alone can enjoy the best” [sic]. D-20883 instructed to open the container and count the contents using tools included. D-20883 verbally expressed their incredulity at the tedium of the task but complied, counting one thousand (1000) grains of the solid.  D-20883 subsequently instructed to consume one grain at a time and describe the flavor. Each of the 1000 grains was invariably described by D-20883 as “salty” or some variation thereof, despite requests for more detailed descriptions. When provided with water following the experiment, D-20883 voiced complaints that it tasted “salty”. Subject claimed that their symptoms persisted for all food or drink, regardless of composition, until their termination. All experiment materials were tested for anomalous compounds but only traces of ordinary table salt were found.
