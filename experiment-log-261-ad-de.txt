Japanese packaging bearing the logo of the band Offspring and tiny, super-deformed likenesses of the band smashing a generic salaryman's head with jackhammers. Candy appeared to be gummi shot glasses full of various solid color gummi. Taste varied from candy to candy, but was generally "extremely sweet". Candy was examined and shown to have no alcoholic content, despite slight flavor that insinuated otherwise. Ingredient list on back listed only "HATRED AND VITRIOL" in English; no other ingredients listed anywhere on package in any language, although note on the underside of the package states that the candy may aggravate dairy allergies.

**Item description:** Small cylinder covered in crosshatching lines of varying configuration; appears to be a form of writing. Bright purple and green wrapping bears drawing of a vaguely humanoid yellow figure with what appears to be two mouths. Removing cap produces a sudden gush of gray-violet foam; Dr. Hooper dropped the tube and ran to the chemical wash, stating that it was burning his hands. The foam was found to be acidic, and contain significant amounts of capsaicin. The latter was more responsible for the burning sensation than the former. When analyzed, the foam was shown to contain massive amounts of Riboflavin and B6, but no other B complex vitamins, or other vitamins whatsoever. It did contain trace amounts of arsenic and methane, as well as a few minerals that were currently unknown; unfortunately, the sample was lost when the foam dissolved after a few hours.

Can contains five small, three-legged crab-like creatures with tiny claws and large, dewy eyes. When released, they leap up and down ecstatically, clicking their claws and screaming, “Eat me!” over and over again in shrill, high-pitched voices. If subject delays or refuses to eat them, the “Eetmees” become more and more desperate, climbing on each other’s shoulders and even leaping at the subject to force their way into the subject’s mouth. When chewed, the creatures shriek in joy and delight, even going “weeee” as they are swallowed. Prof. Snider was quoted to describe the creatures as “tasty, but disturbing.”

Acting on a hunch, Agent Sciutto refrained from consuming these herself and instead tested them on a Class D subject. It was revealed that once the lid of the Prangles is unsealed, or "popped", the subject is literally unable to prevent herself from eating the chips continuously. Moreover, the tube appears to be bottomless in nature, as the subject has been eating for several days at time of writing and shows no sign of slowing down. While the chips appear to be normal Pringles, the side-effects of such an unhealthy diet are already starting to manifest. This is the second subject to be tested; the first one continued eating even after termination, and the tube had to be forcibly removed from her grasp.

**Item description:** One plate of unknown meat contained within what appears to be an enormous (20 cm x 8 cm) single grain of rice. Meat was tested and confirmed to be fileted [REDACTED] between two and three years of age. DNA analysis showed the [REDACTED] from which the meat came had been genetically optimized by artificial means for purposes of consumption. The technology to accomplish this will not likely be invented this century; however, analysis on the meat and rice confirmed their origin as Japanese.

**Item description:** A plastic box of "Uncle Nick's" brand "Delicious Sunday Profani-snack". Branding prominently featured a winking cartoon devil as well as pentagrams, inverted crosses, and other occult symbols stereotypically associated with satanism. All text other than the brand name and product name printed in vulgar Latin in a slightly irregular typeface suggesting hand-lettering. Back of box prominently featured the slogan "Damnation guaranteed!". Ingredients list included "unholy water" but was otherwise consistent with a meal consisting solely of bread and wine. Box contained thirteen peices of unleavened bread in the style of communion wafers and a clear plastic sachet of red wine with a drinking nozzle. Research Assistant Stern reported wafers as delicious and surprisingly filling with a taste reminiscent of very rare steak, and wine as excellent but slightly salty. On recommendation from Dr. ████████, research assistant was placed under observation, but no anomalous behaviour has been reported.

**Item description:** Item dispensed was a small tan box with the text "Tasty Fetus!" in dark green text. On the box below this text is a picture of a smiling light orange colored fetus. There is more dark green text below the picture that reads, “Now With Shorter Gestational Period!” The back of the box features a three panel comic with three human characters (two females and one male) in a domestic living room setting. In the first panel the female character on the right end of the panel has a speech bubble over her head, reading, “Mom and Dad, I have something to tell you…I’m pregnant.” The second panel shows the shocked faces of the parent characters in the middle of the panel, with a speech bubble over ‘Dad’ reading, “I can’t believe this! Young lady you are in so much trouble-” The daughter character interrupts him and says, “No Dad, it’s just the new Tasty Fetus!™” The final panel begins with the text “Four Weeks Later” and depicts the three characters laughing and making ‘mmm’ noises while consuming an orange fetus-shaped gummy. The fetus is still attached to what appears to be an umbilical cord.

    Opening the box revealed a device similar to a catheter. The attached tube held a dark jelly-type substance. Instructions printed on the side of the device describ the standard process used for artificial insemination. The catheter was administered to a D-Class personnel whose records indicated had given birth before. One (1) week into observation the subject reported feeling intermittent abdominal cramping and subsequent inspection revealed the Subject was already exhibiting slight distention of the stomach. An ultrasound was performed at the end of week two (2) and showed normal fetal development one would expect to see in a first ultrasound, albeit much sooner. Cramping pains and distention increased significantly over the next week. Subject went into labor three (3) weeks and (2) days into the test. Subject appeared to be in above normal pain. Epidural was administered. Twenty-four (24) minutes into labor the stillborn fetus exited the Subject. Subject expired seven (7) minutes later. Autopsy of the fetus revealed gummy organs of different colors and presumably flavors and a circulatory system filled with a syrup of some kind, along with a licorice umbilical cord filled with flavored soda water. The fetus and its components were cut up and presented to two (2) D-Class who had no knowledge of the test. All components were described as tasting very good and were said to be similar in taste to several known products.

Back of bag includes a cryptogram which, when solved, congratulates the reader on passing the "Mad Science League" entrance exam and encourages them to write to the listed address for more information. Address is for a nonexistent town in Utah; postal code matches none in use in the United States. Bag contains individually-wrapped chocolates infused with crackle candy; analysis shows no unexpected ingredients. After eating one, Dr. Griffe commented on the "unusual, but not unpleasant" flavor, then cackled loudly for several seconds. For the next two hours, Dr. Griffe proceeded to laugh "like a cartoon mad scientist" after every sentence regardless of content or context. No other changes in behaviour or personality were observed.

**Item Description:** At first, no object was seen delivered from SCP-261; an investigation of the delivery tray did discover a tiny package roughly 1cm square. Object was moved to a lab where microscopic analysis revealed the packaging to be standard cellophane with the word "Nanosnax" on the front in English. The remainder of the writing on the packaging consisted of a series of numbers and letters later discovered to be hexadecimal, though with no known relation to any language. Inside the packaging was a small circular wafer; analysis revealed the wafer to be pure silicon. Wafer and packaging have been retained for further research.

**Addendum:** Several of the hexadecimal numbers on the package have been positively identified as op-codes for the MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor; the remaining hexadecimal numbers have yet to be identified and do not correspond to any op-codes of any known microprocessor.

**Addendum:** Although no reaction was noted on D-11737 initially consuming the "Lucky Darts," a strange confluence of events happened within six hours of consuming the product: D-11737 won the [REDACTED] State Lottery (totaling $358 million), was unharmed when SCP-███ breached containment and killed all other personnel in his section, received word he was being promoted to █-class (and thus had his previous liquidation order rescinded), and managed to save Dr. [REDACTED] from a nasty fall in Stairwell D which eventually resulted in her inviting him back to her place for [DATA EXPUNGED]. Unfortunately, when no effects were immediately noted, the packaging for the "Lucky Darts" was discarded and cannot be found.

Agent ███ sullenly ate the cereal while being goaded by other staffmembers to apply the temporary tattoo.
