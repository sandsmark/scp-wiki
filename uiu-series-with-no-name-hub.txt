title:The UIU Series With No Name Hub
+++ "On the Whole, the Unusual Incidents Unit is a superfluous organization. If not for its relative usefulness during the Cold War under J. Edgar Hoover, it would not be around today."

**-Foundation Liaison Howard Packard, 2005**

+++ "The Unusual Incidents Unit is, at best, occasionally useful. However, the majority of their agents are inexperienced with paranormal matters, and as a result, we do not believe that fully integrating them into the Veil would be an appropriate idea at this time."

+++ "There are three things you have to know about the USA if you're one of us: 1) Fuck the SCP. 2) Fuck the GOC. 3) Laugh at the UIU. Those fuckers couldn't kill a mammoth with a bazooka at point-blank range."

++++ Over the years, the Unusual Incidents Unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been the subject of several kinds of mockery, from being compared to sub-par but influential 1990s television programs to being outright called "UIUseless".

+++ This is the story of two agents in this much maligned organization, and their adventures in a far-off land known as the Midwestern United States.
