**Item #:** SCP-1215

**Object Class:** --Safe-- Euclid
 
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1215 must be contained in a locked room in excess of twenty (20) meters on a side, with no adjacent rooms ten (10) meters above or below the room. No recording devices are permitted within the room except for a single security camera with a shield preventing the camera from recording SCP-1215. Access to this room must be restricted by armed guards who have never laid eyes upon SCP-1215 or an image of SCP-1215. Access requires written approval and a security clearance no higher than level three.

At the center of the room, SCP-1215 must be maintained in a hermetically-sealed chamber of inert gas with extremely low humidity at a temperature of ten (10) degrees Celsius. SCP-1215 should not be exposed to light for longer than absolutely necessary. Failure to comply with these measures will result in significant damage.

Prior to the end of the month, a single Class-D subject slated for termination is to be exposed to SCP-1215 to confirm its continued security within the room.

**Description:** SCP-1215 is a 4th century illuminated manuscript, written in Medieval Greek. The manuscript is written on vellum. It was recovered from an archeological dig of a Byzantine monastery in ███████████, Turkey. Illustrations are decorated with both gold and silver. The manuscript is a copy of the //Peri Logismon//, apparently an original copy written by the work’s author, Evagrius Ponticus.[[footnote]]Research Note by Dr. H██████: The //Peri Logismon// is a treatise on temptation, and the “Eight Evil Thoughts”, the predecessor to the more modern “Seven Deadly Sins”. Evagrius wrote the work as a guide for understanding and learning to overcome temptation.[[/footnote]] Records recovered from the dig site (see [REDACTED]) suggest that the manuscript spent much of the last 1600 years [DATA EXPUNGED]. --Research is pending into possible interference with Christian religious ethics[[footnote]]//"I cannot write about all the villainies of the demons; and I feel ashamed to speak about them at length and in detail, for fear of harming the more simple-minded among my readers."// - Evagrius, //Peri Logismon// 16[[/footnote]] by a 4th century counterpart to the Foundation.-- **Research terminated by order of O5 Command.**

Individuals exposed to SCP-1215, or images of SCP-1215, have their behavior subtly altered, those these alterations do not appear to manifest themselves until the individual leaves the immediate proximity of SCP-1215. Analysis of personnel under SCP-1215’s influence suggests that the alterations to their behavior is based on their prior personality. After leaving SCP-1215’s immediate surroundings, the alteration of the subject’s behavioral patterns increases proportionally to a combination of the physical distance separating the subject from SCP-1215 and the time since the subject was in the presence of SCP-1215. While returning the subject to within sight of SCP-1215 or an image of SCP-1215 has the effect of temporarily reversing the behavior alterations, no means of permanently reverting exposed individuals to their original behavioral state has yet been determined.

Additionally, personnel within approximately ten meters of SCP-1215 who had not yet been exposed to SCP-1215 have reported feeling temptation to look at the manuscript. Reports indicate the strength of the temptation is inversely proportional to their distance from SCP-1215.

**Addendum 1215-1:** See [[[Incident Report 1215-A]]].

**Addendum 1215-2:** Research into SCP-1215 suspended until further notice, pending full review Incident 1215-A. SCP-1215 classification changed from "Safe" to "Euclid" – O5-█
