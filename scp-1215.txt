**Item #:** SCP-1215

**Object Class:** --Safe-- Euclid
 
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1215 must be contained in a locked room. No recording devices are permitted within the room except for a single security camera with a shield preventing the camera from recording SCP-1215. Access to this room must be restricted by armed guards who have never laid eyes upon SCP-1215 or an image of SCP-1215. Access requires written approval and a security clearance no higher than level three.

At the center of the room, SCP-1215 must be maintained in a hermetically-sealed chamber of inert gas with extremely low humidity at a temperature of ten (10) degrees Celsius. SCP-1215 should not be exposed to light for longer than absolutely necessary. Failure to comply with these measures will result in significant damage.

Prior to the end of the month, a single Class-D subject slated for termination is to be exposed to SCP-1215 to confirm its continued security within the room.

Personnel exposed to SCP-1215 are to be placed in isolation for their own protection and the protection of other personnel.

**Description:** SCP-1215 is a 4th century illuminated manuscript, written in Medieval Greek. The manuscript is written on vellum. It was recovered from an archeological dig of a Byzantine monastery in ███████████, Turkey. Illustrations are decorated with both gold and silver. The manuscript is a copy of the //Peri Logismon//, apparently an original copy written by the work’s author, Evagrius Ponticus.[[footnote]]Research Note by Dr. Howard: The //Peri Logismon// is a treatise on temptation, and the “Eight Evil Thoughts”, the predecessor to the more modern “Seven Deadly Sins”. Evagrius wrote the work as a guide for understanding and learning to overcome temptation.[[/footnote]] Records recovered from the dig site (see [REDACTED]) suggest that the manuscript spent much of the last 1600 years [DATA EXPUNGED]. --Research is pending into possible interference with Christian religious ethics[[footnote]]//"I cannot write about all the villainies of the demons; and I feel ashamed to speak about them at length and in detail, for fear of harming the more simple-minded among my readers."// - Evagrius, //Peri Logismon// 16[[/footnote]] by an as-yet-unidentified 4th century counterpart to the Foundation.-- **Research terminated by order of O5 Command.**

Individuals exposed to SCP-1215, or images thereof, have their behavior altered, though these alterations do not appear to manifest themselves until the individual leaves the immediate proximity of the object. Subjects exhibit behavior consistent with one of the “eight evil thoughts” described within the manuscript. Analysis of personnel under SCP-1215’s influence suggests that the alterations to their behavior is based on their prior personality, though additional testing would be necessary for a statistically significant sample size. Use of D-class personnel otherwise scheduled for termination as test subjects is undergoing consideration. Additionally, it is unknown whether the object forces the subjects to display the behavior, or simply tempts them through as yet unknown means with the promise of effects comparable to a drug-induced euphoria. The effects of SCP-1215 vary, not only based on which vice manifests itself in the behavior of exposed personnel, but also in the severity[[footnote]]Available data suggests the severity of the effects is directly proportional to the time since the subject was last exposed to SCP-1215 or an image thereof.[[/footnote]] of the behavior. Currently, symptoms are divided into three phases.
* **Phase I (Initial)** symptoms are exhibited immediately upon leaving the vicinity of SCP-1215, and are sufficiently minor that they may go unnoticed.
* **Phase II (Intermediate)** symptoms are exhibited starting approximately 12-36 hours of leaving the object’s vicinity, and, while noticeable and potentially hazardous, are unlikely to result in permanent harm to the subject or others.
* **Phase III (Terminal)** symptoms are exhibited starting after approximately 48-96 hours of leaving the object’s vicinity. Phase III symptoms often result in significant harm to the subject and personnel nearby.

Observed effects of SCP-1215 are as follows[[footnote]]No subjects exposed to SCP-1215 have been known to exhibit more than one of these effects.[[/footnote]]:

* **Gastrimargia (Gluttony)** – The subject develops an intense and insatiable appetite. Phase I symptoms are minor feelings of hunger or thirst, consistent with not having eaten for several hours. At Phase II, the subject is constantly eating. Phase III symptoms are attempts to eat anything nearby, regardless of whether or not the item being devoured would normally be considered food.
* **Porneia (Lust)** – The subject develops extremely heightened libido. Phase I symptoms are minor feelings of sexual arousal. At Phase II, subjects begin to experience hypersexuality and lowered sexual inhibitions. At Phase III, subjects will actively seek out sexual gratification by any means necessary, while simultaneously ignoring other bodily needs. While no subjects have remained in Phase III for long enough to confirm this, it is conceivable that an individual suffering from Phase III Porneia effects could starve to death as a direct result of their symptoms.
* **Philargyria (Avarice)** – The subject develops excessive greed. Phase I symptoms consist of heightened desire for wealth, status, and power. Phase II symptoms consist of attempts to acquire material possession through theft, bribery, or other means. Hoarding is common. Phase III symptoms are extreme attempts to obtain wealth, often including violence, trickery, and/or manipulation of authority.
* **Hyperephania (Hubris)** – The subject develops extreme pride. Phase I symptoms are minor feelings of pride. Phase II symptoms include a tendency to shame others as being inferior, and a sense of gratification for doing so. Phase III symptoms include more extreme manifestations of Phase I and II symptoms, as well as insolence, contempt, and a tendency towards violence against anyone who is perceived to have disparaged the subject.
* **Lype (Envy)** – The subject develops extreme negative emotions at the good fortune of others. Phase I symptoms are minor feelings of jealousy. Phase II symptoms include underhanded attempts to engage in character assassination of those to which the subject feels jealous. Phase III symptoms are characterized by extreme negative behavior, including strong and persistent attempts at causing misery towards the object of the envy, and sometimes violence.
* **Orge (Wrath)** – The subject displays intense and unstoppable rage. Phase I symptoms are minor feelings of annoyance and irritability. At Phase II, subjects become pugnacious, though physical altercations are rare. Once Phase III has been reached, subjects will respond to the slightest trigger with extreme fury, which can result in attempts to kill those nearby.
* **Kenodoxia (Vanity)** – The subject holds an excessive belief in his/her own abilities and/or attractiveness to others. Phase I symptoms include a feeling of superiority. Phase II involves unjustified boasting. At Phase III, subjects descend into extreme self-idolatry. //Note: While subjects displaying Kenodoxia tend to not cause direct harm to themselves or others, they tend to cause sufficient irritation in those around them that it is not uncommon for others to cause __them__ harm.//
* **Akedia (Sloth/Dejection)** – The subject suffers from extreme laziness and despair. Phase I symptoms include procrastination and minor feelings of sadness. Phase II symptoms are consistent with extreme cases of general depressive disorder; the subject has extreme difficulty mustering the energy necessary to perform nonessential tasks. At Phase III, the subject becomes catatonic.

While returning the subject to within sight of SCP-1215 or an image of SCP-1215 has the effect of temporarily reversing the behavior alterations; no means of permanently reverting exposed individuals to their original behavioral state has yet been determined.

**Addendum 1215-2:** Research into SCP-1215 suspended until further notice, pending full review Incident 1215-A. SCP-1215 classification changed from "Safe" to "Euclid" – O5-█
