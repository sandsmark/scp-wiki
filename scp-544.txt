**Item #:** SCP-544

**Object Class:** Euclid (formerly Safe, see Addendum)

**Special Containment Procedures:** Unless SCP-544 is in use, it is to be stored in a 1m x 1m x 1m container. When SCP-544 is in use by SCP personnel, SCP-544's bearer is to be kept under constant visual and auditory surveillance at all times.

**Description:** SCP-544 is a 30cm tall hand-held radio microphone, made of polished metal and black plastic. A plastic sign with the words 'ON THE AIR' on it in red. SCP-544 has no wires or plugs. There are no internal mechanics contained within the top of the microphone.

When grasped by the 'neck' of the microphone, a sound described as a robotic groaning will come out of SCP-544 for approximately 30 seconds. After that, the noise will cease, and the ON THE AIR text will turn green. From then on, SCP-544 will speak for the bearer, in a simulacrum of the person's original voice, with significant electronic flanging. Attempts to encourage the bearer to communicate vocally is met with a confused look. The bearer will not let go of SCP-544 willingly, even during rest periods.

It is suggested, although not required, that Foundation personnel tasked with separating SCP-544 from its current bearer wear head protection, as subjects in possession of SCP-544 are not adverse to using SCP-544 as an improvised weapon, capable of causing [DATA EXPUNGED]

After more experiments using voice-capable D-Class personnel, --the Foundation believes SCP-544 is best employed for personnel that are unable to speak vocally for whatever reason.--

**Addendum: Experiment SCP-544-20:** After bearing SCP-544 for â–ˆ straight hours, D-Class Subject #73432401 found it difficult to communicate verbally for a period of 2 hours. #73432401 found itself unable to describe the sensation. Subject #73432401 was then terminated.

**Addendum: Experiment SCP-544-29:** 26 hours and 34 minutes into observation, Subject #436364 begins 'speaking' through SCP-544 the following phrases: [DATA EXPUNGED]. Subject #436364 was asleep at the time, and believes Foundation observers were playing a joke on him, having heard nothing.

**Addendum: Experiment SCP-544-29:** After 2 days of bearing SCP-544 and 2 more instances similar to the ones noted above, seperation was ordered. After a minor conflict resulting in the loss of a security office. Subject #436364 spent approximately 8 hours in a erratic state. Through pantomime, he was able to convey that he was unable to speak. After eight hours, #436364 was finally able to sleep. Autopsy of #436364's brain revealed a significant decay in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus section, commonly known as Broca's Area.

**Addendum: Experiment SCP-544-35:"** Subject #11001001 was allowed to carry SCP-544 for a total of 5 days, 20 hours, and 10 minutes. During that time, a SCP-544 spoke phrases identical to the ones reported in Experiment 29 five times. In all instances, Subject #11001001 did not hear or notice such words. Upon separation with SCP-544, #11001001 also appeared to have difficulty speaking. Upon termination and autopsy, #11001001's posterior inferior frontal gyrus was completely liquefied.
