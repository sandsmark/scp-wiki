**Item #:** SCP-065

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** As SCP-065 cannot be moved, Containment Site-██ has been established to prevent further contamination. Containment Site-██ is labeled as a military research facility on all official maps, and unauthorized personnel and civilians trying to gain access must be detained and questioned.

Personnel may not enter the outer limit of SCP-065, as designated by the Perimeter 1 fence, at any time. Observation of SCP-065 may only be performed with approval from at least two (2) level 4 personnel, and researchers observing SCP-065 may not look directly at SCP-065 for more than 60 minutes in any 24-hour period.

If SCP-065 undergoes a severe spatial distortion phase (as outlined in Document 065-01-██), all personnel must be evacuated immediately from the containment area and remain outside Perimeter 2 until the phase has passed. Personnel exposed to a spatial distortion must undergo extensive psychological evaluation before allowed to return to duty.

**Description:** SCP-065 is a spherical region of space on a farm near [DATA EXPUNGED]. SCP-065 has a variable radius, which fluctuates between 8 to 47 meters with no discernible pattern.

SCP-065 was formed after the destruction of [DATA EXPUNGED] on-site by the Global Occult Coalition. The release of energy generated during the process created SCP-065, resulting in the loss of 11 GOC agents. The Foundation was notified by deep cover agents within the GOC shortly afterward, and the area was quarantined.

The [DATA EXPUNGED] at the center of SCP-065 constantly emits [DATA EXPUNGED] as well as an unidentified [DATA EXPUNGED]. Currently, all attempts at electronic observation have failed, as the [DATA EXPUNGED] causes severe distortion and/or static in all observational equipment, including still photographs. SCP-065 also causes severe sensory confusion and migraines after 60 minutes of direct observation.

Periodically, SCP-065 will undergo a severe distortion phase for approximately 45 seconds, with time between occurrences from 5 minutes to 72 hours. Whenever a living organism is present within the area of effect of SCP-065 during a distortion phase, one or more effects may occur:

* Cellular regression, causing living tissue to return to a stem cell state.
* Rapid cellular growth, similar to metastatic cancer.
* Tissue 'fusing' between regressed cells.
* Spontaneous cellular reanimation or necrosis.

Furthermore, the effects of SCP-065 are more severe as the complexity of the test organism increases. Single-celled organisms and infectious agents are completely unaffected, whereas the effects of SCP-065 on living humans has resulted in death in 99% of tests and recorded contact instances, often through painful mutations or spontaneous necrosis of vital tissue. The rapid growth and mutation of living tissues also oftentimes cause test subjects to 'fuse' with nearby inert objects, including clothing, weapons, and equipment.

Only one recorded case of a living human surviving exposure to a severe SCP-065 distortion exists. See [DATA EXPUNGED] for additional information.

**Addendum 065-1:**

The effect originating from the center of SCP-065 appears to be some sort of macro-scale quantum fluctuation, specifically targeted at living tissue. Through extensive testing, additional characteristics have been determined:

* Only genetically similar tissue seems to be 'fused'. Tissue samples from different organs from the same donor exhibited fusing, tissue samples from a mother and child fused, but tissue samples from siblings did not.
* After over ██ experiments, no discernible pattern to the effects can be found. As far as we can tell, it's utterly random.
* The quantum effects seem to be the cause of the sensory confusion. We are trying to directly observe quantum entanglement, and our brains weren't built for it. This is also why cameras don't work; you're trying to take a snapshot of something that can't be expressed in normal space-time.

We're almost at the limit of our understanding about SCP-065. I'd like to bring █████████ to the site, see if we can figure anything more about it. I know █████████ isn't particularly fond of the idea, but as the only survivor, we could use all the help we can get.
