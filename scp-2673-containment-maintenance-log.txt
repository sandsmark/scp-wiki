The verse you write,
Must have some form,
About [[[SCP-2673| this skip]]],
How's it contained,

This log maintained,
Don't let it slip,
From standards norm,
And do it right.

Holding two six seven three

**Comments:** Psycholinguistic analysis indicates a 2.4% chance SCP-2673 may breach containment. Give it a limerick.

There once was a skip in the words,
That made people break from the herds,
The Foundation sought it,
Until they had caught it,
And trapped it with poetry nerds.

**Comments:** Reinforcing containment with a triolet.

To Secure, to Contain, to Protect
Against Keter, Euclid and Safe
To guard against any defect
To Secure, to Contain, to Protect
Twenty-six seventy-three is a meme
We must be vigilant against, always
To Secure, to Contain, to Protect
Against Keter, Euclid and Safe

The poems protect
Against this horrible threat
To avoid a breach

Poems are jails to Two-Six-Seven-Three.
They keep it restrained in a maze of words,
The locks of metre and prisons of form.
This skip is contained, never to be freed. 

They keep it restrained, in a maze of words
Where Two-Six-Seven-Three is lost in verse.
This skip is contained, never to be freed,
Never can it breach our containment.

Where? Two-Six-Seven-Three is lost in verse,
While we craft more verse to keep it contained.
Never can it breach! Our containment
Is the perfect jail for a thing of memes.

While we craft more verse to keep it contained,
Poems are jails to Two-Six-Seven-Three.
Is the perfect jail for a thing of memes
The locks of metre and prisons of form?
