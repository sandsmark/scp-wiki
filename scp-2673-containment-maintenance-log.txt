The verse you write,
Must have some form,
About this skip,
How's it contained,

This log maintained,
Don't let it slip,
From standards norm,
And do it right.

Here you write the verse
Holding two six seven three
Make it a good one.

**Comments:** Psycholinguistic analysis indicates a 2.4% chance SCP-2673 may breach containment. Give it a limerick.

There once was a skip in the words,
That made people break from the herds,
The Foundation sought it,
Until they had caught it,
And trapped it with poetry nerds.
