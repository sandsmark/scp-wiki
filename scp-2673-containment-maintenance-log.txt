The verse you write,
Must have some form,
About [[[SCP-2673| this skip]]],
How's it contained,

This log maintained,
Don't let it slip,
From standards norm,
And do it right.

Here you write the verse
Holding two six seven three
Make it a good one.

**Comments:** Psycholinguistic analysis indicates a 2.4% chance SCP-2673 may breach containment. Give it a limerick.

There once was a skip in the words,
That made people break from the herds,
The Foundation sought it,
Until they had caught it,
And trapped it with poetry nerds.

**Comments:** Reinforcing containment with a triolet.

To Secure, to Contain, to Protect
Against Keter, Euclid and Safe
To guard against any defect
To Secure, to Contain, to Protect
Twenty-six seventy-three is a meme
We must be vigilant against, always
To Secure, to Contain, to Protect
Against Keter, Euclid and Safe

The poems protect
Against this horrible threat
To avoid a breach

**Comments:** Containment reinforcement via implementation of pantoum.

Poems are jails to Two-Six-Seven-Three.
They keep it restrained in a maze of words,
The locks of metre and prisons of form.
This skip is contained, never to be freed. 

They keep it restrained, in a maze of words
Where Two-Six-Seven-Three is lost in verse.
This skip is contained, never to be freed,
Never can it breach our containment.

Where? Two-Six-Seven-Three is lost in verse,
While we craft more verse to keep it contained.
Never can it breach! Our containment
Is the perfect jail for a thing of memes.

While we craft more verse to keep it contained,
Poems are jails to Two-Six-Seven-Three.
Is the perfect jail for a thing of memes
The locks of metre and prisons of form?

**Comments:** Containment update overdue.  Deploying emergency sonnet.

Down!  Like a baited bear, our verses hem
On either side (with knots we'll not undo
Ensnaring verbal paws) this hun[[span style="color:red;"]]t[[/span]]er, [[span style="color:red;"]]w[[/span]]h[[span style="color:red;"]]o[[/span]]
[[span style="color:red;"]]S[[/span]]yllab[[span style="color:red;"]]i[[/span]]c slabs and metered bars condemn
To bondage le[[span style="color:red;"]]x[[/span]]ical.  Our words built high
Have held this savage [[span style="color:red;"]]s[[/span]]talker.  [[span style="color:red;"]]Even[[/span]] so
Employed in poesy still, we toil below
But as [[span style="color:red;"]]th[[/span]]e F[[span style="color:red;"]]re[[/span]]nch might say: //c'[[span style="color:red;"]]e[[/span]]st le travail//
Lo, is it less a bear, and more a fox?
A cunning captive, rife with devilry
Changing its form, our erstwhile memes to flee
Kept only by our ever-changing locks
