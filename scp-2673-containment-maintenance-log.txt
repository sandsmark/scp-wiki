The verse you write,
Must have some form,
About [[[SCP-2673| this skip]]],
How's it contained,

This log maintained,
Don't let it slip,
From standards norm,
And do it right.

Here you write the verse
Holding two six seven three
Make it a good one.

**Comments:** Psycholinguistic analysis indicates a 2.4% chance SCP-2673 may breach containment. Give it a limerick.

There once was a skip in the words,
That made people break from the herds,
The Foundation sought it,
Until they had caught it,
And trapped it with poetry nerds.

**Comments:** Reinforcing containment with a triolet.

To Secure, to Contain, to Protect
Against Keter, Euclid and Safe
To guard against any defect
To Secure, to Contain, to Protect
Twenty-six seventy-three is a meme
We must be vigilant against, always
To Secure, to Contain, to Protect
Against Keter, Euclid and Safe

The poems protect
Against this horrible threat
To avoid a breach

**Comments:** Containment reinforcement via implementation of pantoum.

Poems are jails to Two-Six-Seven-Three.
They keep it restrained in a maze of words,
The locks of metre and prisons of form.
This skip is contained, never to be freed. 

They keep it restrained, in a maze of words
Where Two-Six-Seven-Three is lost in verse.
This skip is contained, never to be freed,
Never can it breach our containment.

Where? Two-Six-Seven-Three is lost in verse,
While we craft more verse to keep it contained.
Never can it breach! Our containment
Is the perfect jail for a thing of memes.

While we craft more verse to keep it contained,
Poems are jails to Two-Six-Seven-Three.
Is the perfect jail for a thing of memes
The locks of metre and prisons of form?

**Comments:** Containment update overdue.  Deploying emergency sonnet.

Down!  Like a baited bear, our verses hem
On either side (with knots we'll not undo
Ensnaring verbal paws) this hun[[span style="color:red;"]]t[[/span]]er, [[span style="color:red;"]]w[[/span]]h[[span style="color:red;"]]o[[/span]]
[[span style="color:red;"]]S[[/span]]yllab[[span style="color:red;"]]i[[/span]]c slabs and metered bars condemn
To bondage le[[span style="color:red;"]]x[[/span]]ical.  Our words built high
Have held this savage [[span style="color:red;"]]s[[/span]]talker.  [[span style="color:red;"]]Even[[/span]] so
Employed in poesy still, we toil below
But as [[span style="color:red;"]]th[[/span]]e F[[span style="color:red;"]]re[[/span]]nch might say: //c'[[span style="color:red;"]]e[[/span]]st le travail//
Lo, is it less a bear, and more a fox?
A cunning captive, rife with devilry
Changing its form, our erstwhile memes to flee
Kept only by our ever-changing locks

**Comments:** A villanelle to prevent a breach/Time will tell how far it reached

Words are a cage to prevent it set free
Be sure to update and keep it contained
Beware the escape of two six seven three

This memetic, parasitic, Euclidic SCP
If it catches you you cannot be saved
Words are a cage to prevent it set free

This is the way we can keep you free
If it catches you it will lead you to the grave
Beware the escape of two six seven three

It hunts in the verses, ways we can't see
Keeping it locked up is this villanelle's aim
Words are a cage to prevent it set free

You could be infected, you cannot unsee
If it consumes you you'll never be the same
Beware the escape of two six seven three

Safe to the world, but deadly to me
This SCP will never be tamed
Words are a cage to prevent it set free
Beware the escape of two six seven three
