**Additional Work:**
[[[Routine Psychological Evaluations By Dr Glass]]]

**Additional Notes:**  
//Observation has shown Dr. Glass has a "softness" for the humanoid SCPs not usually fitting of SCP personnel. Ordering strict supervision until he has been deemed competent. We don't want another needless fiasco like that caused by Dr. Dantensen with SCP-105 due to emotional weakness.// - Dr. Klein

//Though it has been noted that Dr. Glass lacks both the worldly experience, age, and emotional detachment usually seen in Foundation personnel, thorough examinations as well as his work record show that he is fit to work at the Foundation despite concerns of 'softness'.  This seems to be part of a natural empathy which makes him more apt for his duties.  However, further promotion or administrative privileges are not advised.// - O5-██

**Note:** //I know what you're thinking. You think I'm gonna bust in here, and make some notes about something stupid Glass has done, or set him up for some pranks, but, hey, this is Glass! That's just rude, and I'm not doing it.// -Dr. Bright
