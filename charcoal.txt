"Alright. Dee Five O'Ten," Junior Researcher Perez began, trying to make a name out of a number. "We will now present a series of photographs. All we want you to do is write a brief description of each photo, no more than a few sentences. Okay?"

D-5010 nodded and looked ahead at the screen. Simple stock pictures, as might appear on the covers of greeting or birthday cards, ran in a slideshow. //A city street at night. Neon lights reflect off everything wet from rain. Just light rain, there are still people out walking.// *click* //A red and white lighthouse with a clear blue sky behind.. It's sunny, and a wave is crashing on the rock.// *click* //An aerial view of tropical islands surrounded by water so clear and blue you can see the sandbars.// *click* //A child hopping over a puddle. The picture is in black and white, except the rubber rainboots are bright yellow.//

At the conclusion of the slideshow Perez stepped forward to observe the sheets of paper spread on the desk.  D-5010 looked at the sheets too and furrowed his brow. Exchanging a glance with the researcher he preemptively answered what he knew was about to be asked. "I didn't write that part. Those parts. Or ... I didn't try to. I mean... each picture was on for not even a minute. Right? I didn't write that much, i don't think."

Perez tried to suppress an exasperated sigh. Not for this moment. Well, not just for this moment: She was exhausted from working so many extra hours recently; that was because another Junior Researcher just transferred to the Site, but then apparently deserted without a trace (rumors of spying and espionage were floated, but those more likely came from wild speculation after the fact than anything else). Perez felt like the only one picking up any of the slack; this was just one of several objects she had been asked to document on top of her already heavy workload.

"It's fine. Thank you for your cooperation and efforts today." Perez was aware of how much that sounded a rigid dismissal, but in that moment couldn't find the words to phrase it more naturally, so was beholden to the stock options of textbook phrases.  The stock phrase 'Results identical to previous test' made yet another appearance in Perez's notes, which only increaed her stress further.

And there was still one more avenue to pursue, so this ordeal wasn't even over yet.

Junior Researcher Perez was calm now. 

She had lost her temper with the D-class research assistant in the chamber earlier. They had simply been asked to draw an impression of the picture on display with the materials provided. It wasn't a difficult task, and their profile was tagged with 'visual art experience' so easier still. But they took so damn long with it, and kept fussing over details, and then //they// acted frustrated with it all and... Oh! A young guard named Frances had interjected and walked her outside for a minute, calmly talking until she regained her composure.

Returning to the test chamber, Perez found the research assistant to be less combative as well. Frances took up a place at the door, the other guard remained stone faced in the far corner of the room.

"I just-" D-5154 stuttered as she began. "I just was having a hard time getting the... the texture right on certain places." She gestured toward her charcoal-print recreation of the landscape picture propped on an easel in the room. "I don't understand what's happening... when I'm trying to do the shading for these darker parts it just... it..."

Perez came close and peered at the artwork. She squinted at the darker sections and, sure enough, could just make out in the pattern... "Aagh!" Perez shouted out, making all other parties jump with a start. It might have been brilliant, a breakthrough, except that it didn't amount to anything more than yet another 'results identical' entry in the damned test log!

Perez angrily stormed off to finally put an end to this burdensome extra work in what passed for her own office space. She was in an angry state for the rest of the day.

Knock, knock.

"Knock knock!"

'What an annoying...' Perez thought harshly of the middling (in nearly all ways, both professionally and personally) Researcher Patey, interrupted however by his immediate transition to the task he had come for.

"So, the gents upstairs are still waiting on the final assessment of that Object-862 that you had been working on." A moment of silence passed as Perez expected Patey might elaborate, while apparently Patey expected Perez would recall all the pertinent information based solely on those numbers.  "It was one of the assignments you took on after Researcher Wren's disappearance," he added barely helpfully.

"Oh, I thought I'd already worked through all of those!" Perez scrawled 'AO-862' on a notepaper so she could look it up momentarily. "Give me a few minutes here and i'll double check, and send a copy up to the Senior Researchers' office straight away." She smiled as she said it, but seconds later her expression reverted to neutral and Patey recognized the conversation was over, fleeing accordingly.

Once he was out of sight Perez opened up her database and tracked down the appropriate file. 'Shit!' Somehow she had apparently filed it 'complete' but hadn't submitted it.  She scanned quickly over research notes and hurriedly typed a summary of findings to include with the description file attached. She quickly composed all parts of the report and sent them to the inboxes of the appropriate Senior Researchers. The description file would eventually be entered into the Log of Anomalous Objects; the extraneous communiques and surrounding circumstances would be redacted for reasons of practicality.
