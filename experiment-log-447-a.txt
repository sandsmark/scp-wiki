**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** [[[SCP-882]]]

//Procedure:// SCP-447-2 was refined into a lubricant.  SCP-882 was temporarily removed from its seawater bath and SCP-447-2 applied as a lubricant to all joints and connections.

//Results:// Although SCP-447-2 was successful in reducing grinding and noise by 50%, it was also successful in removing rust from the structure. SCP-882 was immediately returned to its seawater bath, and staff on-hand were placed in quarantine for examination.

//Notes:// "Let's not try that again, shall we?" - Dr. A. Clef

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** One (1) guinea pig, purchased from pet shop.

//Procedure:// Subject was immersed in SCP-447-2 for five (5) minutes. Care was taken to keep the subject's head above the level of the fluid, to prevent the death of the test subject.

//Results:// Subject's fur became saturated with the fluid. Test Item required several hours of grooming to remove SCP-447-2 from its fur. No further deleterious effects reported.

//Notes:// After careful washing to remove all traces of SCP-447-2 from its fur, subject was subsequently consumed by Agent ███████, who is of Peruvian descent. Agent ███████ reported that the meat was, in his own words, "the best //cuye// I've ever had." Approval for testing of SCP-447-2 as a marinade is currently on hold pending review of whether or not a steak constitutes a dead body.

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** One (1) tablet [[[SCP-500]]]

//Procedure:// Subject was immersed in SCP-447-2 for five (5) minutes.

//Results:// In addition to curing all diseases, subject now also leaves the patient's breath feeling minty fresh.

//Notes:// "About what was expected. Seriously, guys, what were you thinking would happen?" Dr. A. Clef

-----
**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** [[[SCP-076]]]-2

//Procedure:// 500ml of SCP-447-2 was added to 500ml distilled vodka (███████) and two dozen ice cubes, shaken well, and strained into a pitcher. Approximately 0.2 liters of the mixture were poured into a glass with mint and a lime garnish. Mixture was taken to SCP-076-2, who was told, "Hey, Able, try this, it's pretty good."

//Results:// SCP-076-2 agreed that the mixture was, in his words, "refreshing," but immediately lost interest when told of SCP-447-2's interaction with dead bodies.

//Notes:// Because of SCP-076-2's tendency to become and/or create dead bodies, further contact with SCP-447 is forbidden.

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** One (1) Pentium 4 computer: 1.5 ghz, with [DATA EXPUNGED]

//Procedure:// Subject was immersed in SCP-447-2 for five (5) minutes, with the power cord unplugged.

//Results:// Subject became caked in goo and no longer functions.

//Notes:// "Whoever came up with this one should be kicked in the head." - Dr. A. Clef

-----

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** [[[SCP-063]]]

//Procedure:// Dr. ███ used SCP-447 instead of toothpaste to brush his teeth with [[[SCP-063]]]

//Results:// Given that Dr. ████ doesn't need to use toothpaste to begin with, not much, really.

//Notes:// "What is WITH you people?" - Dr. A. Clef

-----
**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** One (1) dead body

//Notes:// Test was aborted. The scientist who made the proposal has been reassigned as Class D Personnel.

//Notes (2):// "Seriously, guys, how hard is it to understand? No. Dead. Bodies. None. Nada. Nein! Don't think about it, don't joke about it, and most certainly, don't DO it. Sheesh!" - Dr. A. Clef

-----
**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** Dr. A. Clef

//Procedure:// Dr. A. Clef was ambushed in the hallway, dragged into a room with a bathtub full of SCP-447-2, and immersed for approximately 25 seconds.

//Results:// Subject became irate, and threatened to kill staff members carrying out the experiment if it were not for the fact that doing so would violate experimental protocol.

//Notes:// "As soon as this mess is cleaned up you will all be missed." - Dr. A. Clef

-----
**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** Potassium Nitrate/Sugar mix

//Procedure:// A spoonful of SCP-447 was added to the mix of Potassium Nitrate and Sugar, in order to create a makeshift smoke grenade.

//Results:// Not only the new mix slowed down the combustion in such a way that the generated smoke was ten times greater and lasted approximately 5 minutes longer than the original mix, but also colored the smoke with a green tint and left it with a minty smell

//Notes:// "Not bad for a three-dollar smoke grenade. Although this wouldn't work so well in the field, the odds of the smoke reaching a dead body are just too high."


-----
**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** Prof. Snider

//Procedure:// Two drops (1 microlitre each) of SCP-447, one in each of Prof. Snider's eyes (note that Prof. Snider has an astigmatism and normally wears corrective eyewear).

//Results:// Vision was clear and focused for six hours, though Prof. Snider reported to now see everything in a green tint. Subject's eyesight soon returned to normal, though both eyes are now a much more brilliant green than before.

//Notes:// "Oh well. I look better with my glasses anyway." -Prof. Snider

----

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** 8 ounce (236 ml) glass of skim milk

//Procedure:// Two (2) teaspoons of SCP-447 thoroughly stirred into milk.

//Results:// Milk turned a bright green in color and was slightly thicker, with a slight minty flavor. Chemical analysis later indicated that the concoction was now lactose-free.

//Notes:// "You know, we might be able to market this stuff. I'm pretty sure dead bodies don't drink milk." -Prof. Snider

----

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** 15 lbs. (6.8 kg) quick-dry cement

//Procedure:// Cement powder and 5 gallons (19 liters) of SCP-447 rotated inside a standard miniature cement mixer.

//Results:// Mixture took on a green tinge and solidified to a hardness 50% greater than normal concrete, though it took twice as long to dry.

//Notes:// "It seems promising, but it's time-consuming to make and the risks of a dead body falling on a slab of this stuff is too high." -Prof. Snider

----

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** 2 cups of water

//Procedure:// One (1) tablespoon of SCP-447-2 thoroughly stirred into water.

//Results:// Water turned a green tint but is otherwise normal. In fact, whatever contaminations were in it vanished completely. Putting in additional contaminations also caused them to vanish.

//Notes:// "This would make a good chlorine subtitute for swimming pools; all the cleanliness of chlorinated water without the bleachy smell or hair discolorization. Too bad some swimmers are careless and turn into dead bodies."--Dr. Ray A██████

----

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** One (1) dirty, unplayable //Super Mario Bros.// cartridge and one (1) Nintendo Entertainment System.

//Procedure:// A cotton swab, dipped into a cup of SCP-447-2, was used to scrub the contacts of the cartridge and console.

//Results:// Game not only plays perfectly once again, but the NES can now output at 720p.  It is unknown as to how a third-generation video game console is able to output at high resolution through AV cables. Unfortunately this is of little use as no television sets are currently configured to accept HD signals through normal AV cables, and the NES itself has no ports for HDMI cables.

//Notes:// "I'm looking to do this for all of my cartidges and cartidge-based systems. I just have to be careful not to die in my office or bedroom."--Dr. A██████

----

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** One (1) Trojan condom

//Procedure:// Dr. A██████ placed the condom on his [DATA EXPUNGED] and applied SCP-447-2 onto it.  He then tested the SCP-447-2-covered condom by [DATA EXPUNGED]

//Results:// [DATA EXPUNGED]. Dr. A██████ reports that the procedure "went //really// well."

//Notes:// "I could market this as //that// kind of lubricant, but I don't think a warning label isn't enough to ensure that some necrophiliac doesn't gets his or her hands on it."--Dr. A██████
