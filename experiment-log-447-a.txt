**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** [[[SCP-882]]]

//Procedure:// SCP-447-2 was refined into a lubricant.  SCP-882 was temporarily removed from its seawater bath and SCP-447-2 applied as a lubricant to all joints and connections.

//Results:// Although SCP-447-2 was successful in reducing grinding and noise by 50%, it was also successful in removing rust from the structure. SCP-882 was immediately returned to its seawater bath, and staff on-hand were placed in quarantine for examination.

//Notes:// "Let's not try that again, shall we?" - Dr. A. Clef

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** One (1) guinea pig, purchased from pet shop.

//Procedure:// Subject was immersed in SCP-447-2 for five (5) minutes. Care was taken to keep the subject's head above the level of the fluid, to prevent the death of the test subject.

//Results:// Subject's fur became saturated with the fluid. Test Item required several hours of grooming to remove SCP-447-2 from its fur. No further deleterious effects reported.

//Notes:// After careful washing to remove all traces of SCP-447-2 from its fur, subject was subsequently consumed by Agent ███████, who is of Peruvian descent. Agent ███████ reported that the meat was, in his own words, "the best //cuye// I've ever had." Approval for testing of SCP-447-2 as a marinade is currently on hold pending review of whether or not a steak constitutes a dead body.

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** One (1) tablet [[[SCP-500]]]

//Procedure:// Subject was immersed in SCP-447-2 for five (5) minutes.

//Results:// In addition to curing all diseases, subject now also leaves the patient's breath feeling minty fresh.

//Notes:// "About what was expected. Seriously, guys, what were you thinking would happen?" Dr. A. Clef

-----
**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** [[[SCP-076]]]-2

//Procedure:// 500ml of SCP-447-2 was added to 500ml distilled vodka (███████) and two dozen ice cubes, shaken well, and strained into a pitcher. Approximately 0.2 liters of the mixture were poured into a glass with mint and a lime garnish. Mixture was taken to SCP-076-2, who was told, "Hey, Able, try this, it's pretty good."

//Results:// SCP-076-2 agreed that the mixture was, in his words, "refreshing," but immediately lost interest when told of SCP-447-2's interaction with dead bodies.

//Notes:// Because of SCP-076-2's tendency to become and/or create dead bodies, further contact with SCP-447 is forbidden.

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** One (1) Pentium 4 computer: 1.5 ghz, with [DATA EXPUNGED]

//Procedure:// Subject was immersed in SCP-447-2 for five (5) minutes, with the power cord unplugged.

//Results:// Subject became caked in goo and no longer functions.

//Notes:// "Whoever came up with this one should be kicked in the head." - Dr. A. Clef

-----

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** [[[SCP-063]]]

//Procedure:// Dr. ███ used SCP-447 instead of toothpaste to brush his teeth with [[[SCP-063]]]

//Results:// Given that Dr. ████ doesn't need to use toothpaste to begin with, not much, really.

//Notes:// "What is WITH you people?" - Dr. A. Clef

-----
**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** One (1) dead body

//Notes:// Test was aborted. The scientist who made the proposal has been reassigned as Class D Personnel.

//Notes (2):// "Seriously, guys, how hard is it to understand? No. Dead. Bodies. None. Nada. Nein! Don't think about it, don't joke about it, and most certainly, don't DO it. Sheesh!" - Dr. A. Clef

-----
**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** Dr. A. Clef

//Procedure:// Dr. A. Clef was ambushed in the hallway, dragged into a room with a bathtub full of SCP-447-2, and immersed for approximately 25 seconds.

//Results:// Subject became irate, and threatened to kill staff members carrying out the experiment if it were not for the fact that doing so would violate experimental protocol.

//Notes:// "As soon as this mess is cleaned up you will all be missed." - Dr. A. Clef

-----
**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** Potassium Nitrate/Sugar mix

//Procedure:// A spoonful of SCP-447 was added to the mix of Potassium Nitrate and Sugar, in order to create a makeshift smoke grenade.

//Results:// Not only the new mix slowed down the combustion in such a way that the generated smoke was ten times greater and lasted approximately 5 minutes longer than the original mix, but also colored the smoke with a green tint and left it with a minty smell

//Notes:// "Not bad for a three-dollar smoke grenade. Although this wouldn't work so well in the field, the odds of the smoke reaching a dead body are just too high."


-----
**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** Prof. Snider

//Procedure:// Two drops (1 microlitre each) of SCP-447, one in each of Prof. Snider's eyes (note that Prof. Snider has an astigmatism and normally wears corrective eyewear).

//Results:// Vision was clear and focused for six hours, though Prof. Snider reported to now see everything in a green tint. Subject's eyesight soon returned to normal, though both eyes are now a much more brilliant green than before.

//Notes:// "Oh well. I look better with my glasses anyway." -Prof. Snider

----

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** 8 ounce (236 ml) glass of skim milk

//Procedure:// Two (2) teaspoons of SCP-447 thoroughly stirred into milk.

//Results:// Milk turned a bright green in color and was slightly thicker, with a slight minty flavor. Chemical analysis later indicated that the concoction was now lactose-free.

//Notes:// "You know, we might be able to market this stuff. I'm pretty sure dead bodies don't drink milk." -Prof. Snider

----

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** 15 lbs. (6.8 kg) quick-dry cement

//Procedure:// Cement powder and 5 gallons (19 liters) of SCP-447 rotated inside a standard miniature cement mixer.

//Results:// Mixture took on a green tinge and solidified to a hardness 50% greater than normal concrete, though it took twice as long to dry.

//Notes:// "It seems promising, but it's time-consuming to make and the risks of a dead body falling on a slab of this stuff is too high." -Prof. Snider

----

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** 2 cups of water

//Procedure:// One (1) tablespoon of SCP-447-2 thoroughly stirred into water.

//Results:// Water turned a green tint but is otherwise normal. Contaminants reduced by 78%

//Notes:// "This would make a good chlorine subtitute for swimming pools; all the cleanliness of chlorinated water without the bleachy smell or hair discolorization. Too bad some swimmers are careless and turn into dead bodies."--Dr. Ray A██████

 **Date:** ██/██/████
 **Test Subject:** one (1) pizza produced by [[[SCP-458]]]
 
//Procedure://  One (1) small sauce cup of SCP-447-2 is held in one hand by Agent Palhinuk, while the other holds [[[SCP-458]]].
 
//Results:// No outward change in the composition of SCP-447-2 is evident.  [[[SCP-458]]] produced a hamburger pizza on a cheese-stuffed crust.  After dipping a slice in SCP-447-2 and ingesting, Agent Palhinuk noted the taste of the substance was like a creamy Italian dressing.  Following his consumption of the pizza, Agent Palhinuk's breath was said to be minty fresh.  He then proceded to hoard the pizza box to himself for a few hours.
 
//Notes://  "Though this brings up new indication into the nature of [[[SCP-458]]], nothing remarkable has come to attention from this, other then Pal's tendency to overeat.  Slight psychological therapy may be in order." - Dr. del Morrino

"I'd suggest we market this stuff as a dressing, but people eating lots of pizza on a regular basis tend to become dead bodies, so..." - Agent Palhinuk

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** one ██████ brand cellular phone
 
//Procedure:// ██████ phone is placed in one (1) small plastic container holding one (1) liter of SCP-447-2 and left to sit for five (5) minutes with power off and battery disconnected.
 
//Results:// ██████ phone is ruined and subsequently destroyed in a nearby furnace.  The ashes and fumes from the burning ██████ phone were reported to be green and minty in scent.
 
//Notes:// "Hey, has anyone seen my phone?" - Agent Palhinuk

----

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Subject:** One (1) Trojan condom

//Procedure:// Dr. A██████ placed the condom on his [DATA EXPUNGED] and applied SCP-447-2 onto it.  He then tested the SCP-447-2-covered condom by [DATA EXPUNGED]

//Results:// [DATA EXPUNGED]. Dr. A██████ reports that the procedure "went //really// well."

//Notes:// "I could market this as //that// kind of lubricant, but I don't think a warning label is enough to ensure that some necrophiliac doesn't gets his or her hands on it."--Dr. A██████
