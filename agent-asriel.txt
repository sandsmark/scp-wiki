[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-wiki-cn.wdfiles.com/local--files/agent-asriel/2.jpg|caption=Agent Asriel, investigating SCP-[DATA EXPUNGED].]]

**Name:** W██████ Asriel
>Wendell Asriel
 
**Security Clearance Level:** 2
 
**Occupation:** Field Agent

**Introduction:** W██████ Asriel, Male, born on ██/04/19██, ████████ Nationality, European-[REDACTED] descent, uses both English and Chinese as working languages. His routine missions include inquiring about rumors regarding supernatural events, participating in folk supernatural-lover organizations and exploring anomalies. When on containment missions, Asriel is allowed to carry an AUG A3 assault rifle.

Asriel's strength lies in his intuition when facing anomalies, which includes an intuition of grasping the right information among rumors, and a quick understanding of the nature of the anomaly he is facing for the first time. This intuition failed to pass the Standard Future-Telling Test and the Psychic Sensations Test. Asriel's disadvantage lies in his non-combat origin, as his combat ability and anti-interrogation ability are slightly inferior to other agents.

Asriel is described as gentle and introverted, and is often rated as "very easygoing and quiet" by colleagues. Although he displays relevantly good team-working and communication skills, he rarely participates in social activities other than work. All attempts to establish a good friendship with Asriel have failed.

**History:** Asriel was an amateur adventurer before joining into the Foundation, who seeks to inquire rumors about supernatural events and explore the site accordingly. After a successful explore of SCP-████, Asriel and his friend were recruited by the Foundation for their potential displayed. After the item was transferred to the Chinese branch, Asriel was too transferred to the Chinese branch to continue his work.

**Addendum:**
[[collapsible show="+ Human Resources Department Only" hide="- Access Granted"]]
> In mission record CN-██-████-████, Asriel is told that he will be sacrificed in a mission on the command of the headquarters. His reaction is satisfying - no resist, hostility or attempts to escape, and he faithfully carried out the mission. Therefore, I concluded that Asriel has passed the 3rd Loyalty Test. He can be sent to missions that require acts of sacrifice.
>
> The result of the 2nd Loyalty Test is complicated. When under intimidation, the result of Milgram's compliance test turned out to be unsatisfactory. However, when being convinced that torturing the victims can save more lives, Asriel began to follow the instructions. Evaluation shows that Asriel's values are consistent with those of the foundation.
