**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation Webcrawler //Πουλί// is to continuously monitor social media platforms for SCP-5863 related imagery, which is to be removed upon discovery. Civilians infected with SCP-5863 are to be amnesticised.

One SCP-5863 instance is currently being contained in a Low Security Standard Avian Containment Chamber in Site-34, with at least four domestic cats stationed nearby in the Low Security wing.

**Description:** SCP-5863 is a subspecies of great spotted cuckoo (//Clamator glandarius//). Consumption of undamaged eggs from this subspecies causes a non-fatal parasitic infection in humans that undergoes the following progression:

* Intermittent headaches for approximately 2-3 days following the consumption of the egg. The duration and intensity of these headaches is approximately proportional to the volume of the consumed egg. MRI imaging of affected subjects indicates the presence of an egg shaped mass located at the base of their skull.
* Cessation of all symptoms for approximately 12-15 days
* Intense migraines occur for approximately 2-4 hours. Noises resembling a hard material striking bone are often reported in this stage, though no source can be identified.

Following this, affected individuals report hearing squawking; intermittent, sharp headaches; and desires to eat atypical food including tree sap, insects and vomit. These individuals often encourage other individuals to consume uncooked, intact avian eggs.

**I. DISCOVERY**

SCP-5863 was discovered on 2024-03-20, following a Foundation sting operation carried out by [[[task-forces#lambda-14|MTF Lambda-14 ("One Star Reviewers")]]]. This operation involved MTF Λ-14 detaining several patrons of Ambrose Backdoor Soho and interrogating them in an attempt to obtain further information about Ambrose Restaurants suppliers.

A routine medical scan revealed an unhatched SCP-5863 instance within one of the patrons' skulls.

**II. STATEMENT FROM AMBROSE RESTAURANTS**

The following log is a transcript of an interview between a Foundation Researcher and a representative of Ambrose Backdoor Soho. This interview was arranged by the Foundation shortly after SCP-5863 was discovered, in order to obtain further information on the source and distribution of the anomaly.

**INTERVIEWER:** Dr. Templeton, Head SCP-5863 Researcher

**INTERVIEWED:** Vernon Dorsey, Manager of Ambrose Backdoor Soho

**NOTE:** This interview was carried out in a Foundation interrogation chamber. Vernon Dorsey was given water laced with veritas before the interview was carried out to ensure xer compliance.

**Templeton:** Statement of Vernon Dorsey, regarding xer experiences with...?

**Vernon:** The cloned eggs of a cuckoo we served as a delicacy.

**Templeton:** This statement was recorded direct from the subject on the 26th of March, 2024.

**Vernon:** Alright so, uhm, we'd heard about the discovery of some new stone tablets at a dig site in...Giza; and  that they'd just finished being translated. They mentioned an ancient delicacy: the eggs of a subspecies of great spotted cuckoo, served uncooked and in the shell.

We did some research and found out that the cuckoo subspecies had gone extinct not too long after the tablets were made: maybe a hundred years or so? Perhaps a little longer? At the time, we assumed this was cos they were so tasty that they'd been hunted to extinction.

This was good for us though! It meant they're a rare delicacy and that we could use our uhm, resources to make them exclusively available to us. We managed to find a few eggs nearby with just about enough genetic material inside them that we could clone like, 8 or 9 of them? Enough that we could have a breeding population that wouldn't be //too// unhealthy.
 
After cloning, the eggs ended up being roughly chicken egg sized, and looking a lot like 'em too. We were unsure whether someone could like, swallow one? Cos of the size? So we got one of the waiters to give it a shot, and they managed to swallow it alright, and then a few others of us tried a-

[​//Vernon looks pained briefly; Dr. Templeton offers to let xem take a break but Vernon shakes xer head.//]

**Vernon:** Well, everyone managed it fine. I don't actually know how folk don't choke on the eggs but they don't? We had the waiters all trained to do the Heimlich manoeuvre for the first showing, just in case, but no-one has ever needed it after eating the eggs.
 
The first time we served them up, only a few people had them; but they enjoyed them so much that we ended up having to serve them intermittently to other folk at that dinner. Nothing out of the ordinary happened, or at least, nothing more out of the ordinary than usual.

Afterwards, we heard reports of a lot of people feeling ill but we put it down to hangovers and ignored it, and for the next few weeks, we happily sold more eggs. People loved them! And I can see why, those things were delic-

[​//Vernon clutches xer head again, and looks pained.//]

**Templeton:** Are you okay to continue?

**Vernon:** Yeah, just give me a moment.

[​//Approximately two minutes of ambient noise was recorded here.//]

**Vernon:** Alright, where was I?

**Templeton:** You were about to get started on what happened to the people who ate the eggs?
 
**Vernon:** Right, right.

We started getting reports that a bunch of people had started acting strangely: squawking occasionally and stuff like that. We take this kinda thing seriously: we deal with anomalous food so we need our customers to trust us to only feed them things which are safe.
 
We tried to figure out what it was that was causing this, and quickly narrowed it down to the eggs. There were too many folk affected for it to be anything else.
 
**Templeton:** Could you provide us with a list of affected customers?

**Vernon:** No, I'm sorry. We take confidentiality very seriously. It'd be bad for business if half our customers got picked up by the Foundation.

**Templeton:** I understand. Is there anything else you can tell us?

**Vernon:** Well, the archaeologists at the dig site kept looking. We'd paid them to: partially in case they found anything else interesting, but mostly to keep quiet. A few days back they found more tablets.
 
These tablets were about the growth in popularity of the Cult of Bastet, or perhaps the founding of it? The translation is a little unclear on that aspect. It seems like the growth of the cult was related to the decline in the bird population, but it wasn't exactly clear how. A fragment also mentioned that people should own cats as a precaut-

[​//Vernon coughs loudly, and a small droplet of blood drips from xer mouth. Xe coughs another couple of times and gestures for water.//]

[​//Dr. Templeton hands xer a glass of water, which xe drinks. Vernon then attempts to talk but produces no sound, before frantically gesturing for a pen and paper.//]

[​//Vernon slumps backwards, xer jaw agape. A beak can be seen in xer mouth, clutching part of xer vocal and ventricular folds. It forces itself forward, breaking the jaw open wider, and an adult SCP-5863 instance emerges from within, covered in blood and flecks of brain matter.//]

**III. UPDATE**


On 2024-13-15, three undercover Agents attached to MTF Λ-14 were placed into a 3-month quarantine following an event wherein they expelled between 3 and 6 bird eggs through their nasal cavities. CCTV recordings show all three agents replacing chicken eggs in shared fridges with the eggs they excreted.

MRI scans revealed all three were infected with SCP-5863. Further investigations are being carried out to determine appropriate modifications to the SCP-5863 Containment Procedures.
