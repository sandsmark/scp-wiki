"Five incidents. Zero recoveries. Eight casualties."

Joseph Keynes, director of the UIU administrative council, flopped the thin blue file on his folding table. A semi-circle of solemnly (and cheaply) dressed, yet expressionless UIU officials sat on worn chairs around the trembling representative standing before them.

Adjusting his tie and pushing his glasses up his sweating nose, UIU agent and legal specialist Damion Hill addressed the committee as firmly as he could. "Director Keynes, the losses were not the fault of our agents. We're simply not well equipped enough-"

"Silence." The Director folded his hands on the snap-up table, a gesture far more significant than what had just been conveyed. "Frankly, Mr. Hill, the matter of whose blame it is-//your// agents or the belligerents-is not a valid point at this stage. The Resource Planning Office is considering withdrawing all immediate funds from our divison, claiming that it is a valuable waste of lives and resources." He cocked his head at a handsomely dressed official carrying a grey briefcase quietly seated at the end of the semicircle. " I do not necessarily disagree."

Involuntarily, Hill gulped.

Relaxing back in his hard-backed chair, Keynes viciously added, "I suggest you give him-and us-a good reason to refrain from proceeding as such." 

Hill shook. This was going even worse than expected. "Sir, the situation is incredibly different than an ordinary operation," Hill stammered, "We have no specialized training for agents, no extensive support of any kind, not even numerical superiority-" He was cut off by Agent Jericho, an elderly woman sitting beside Director Keynes. "//Numerical superiority?//" she chuckled. "Why could you possibly need hundreds of agents to contain a few... Bigfeet, is that how you say it?" A number of other agents laughed. Settling back into a cold look, she added, "Mr. Hill, our organization's very //goal// is to remove any..." she turned her nose at the term. "//Abnormal// objects from society, without society noticing."

His anger at their degrading remarks beginning to overtake his terror, he replied, "Miss Jericho, haven't you read any of our reports? We aren't the only ones out there. And frankly, the ones that are out there are more adept at dealing with these paranormal threats than we ever could be." 

An all-black suited representative at the middle of the left column jeered, "Who, the freaky Men In Black? Give me a break." Snickers were heard. Some began outright laughing. Keynes kept quiet.

Now he was starting to get really mad.

"Yes, the //goddamn Men In Black.//" He looked around the room, daring anyone to rebuke his outburst. "Ladies and Gentlemen of the council, we are at war. This isn't some Vietnam, some guerrilla hiding in a tree that we can take out with a simple pistol shot, or a terrorist that we can arrest as soon as they go through a metal detector. We aren't even the ones fighting it. We can't come //close// to fighting it. These guerrillas burn us with their minds. They deflect our bullets with a swipe of a hand. These terrorists //rip apart our metal detectors and use them to beat us to death.//"

He paused for effect. The Resources representative looked shocked.

Adrenaline rushing from his eloquent start, he continued without hesitation. "For the past eighteen years since our inception, we have been tossed left and right by more competent agencies that don't even belong to us. We aren't asking for a lifetime supply of ammunition, nuclear weapons or fighter jets. All we ask is what is promised to us-what is necessary maintain this use, throw away lifestyle. To do our part in this war."

"And I respectfully ask this council to remember which organization it represents."

He wiped his brow and sat down. A long silence followed.

About five minutes later, Keynes stood up. "We will confer with the Resources representative and discuss the future of this program." The other members, as well as the handsomely dressed individual at the end of the semicircle, left into a small wooden door at the back of the room. Some of the younger council members looked ashamed.

About five minutes later, the council filed back in. Keynes stood, while the rest sat, and the man with the briefcase silently exited the room. "You have your years' funding, Mr. Hill," he sighed. "This council is dismissed."

As Hill drove out of D.C. that night, he couldn't help grinning like an idiot the entire way back to the New York office. For a moment there, he had felt a glimmer of respect. In the life of a UIU operative, that was all you could hope for.
