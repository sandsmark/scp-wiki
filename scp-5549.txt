**Item #:** SCP-5549

**Object Class:** N/A

**Special Containment Procedures:** Site-05 is a compound located in Western Siberia, dedicated solely to the containment of SCP-5549. The primary vector of containment is a 1,398 meter borehole drilled directly into the Earth, at the bottom of which is a square 5m cell containing SCP-5549. Motion sensors are set to alert Site-05 if any abnormal activity is detected from the cell.

**Description:** SCP-5549, formerly D-293 & Doctor Jacques Boucher, is a hostile sapient entity with Class V ontokinetic abilities. Additionally, SCP-5549 is highly resistant to all forms of damage tested against it. The extent of SCP-5549's abilities is currently unknown.

SCP-5549 was created by the Foundation Department of Inter-Anomaly Experimentation as part of Project LONDON BRIDGE.

**SHARP:** Good evening, Liaison Je-

**O5-7:** I'm not Doc Jefferson, son.

**SHARP:** Pardon? I was told I had a meeting with Liaison Jefferson in C109, I migh- 

**O5-7:** Sit back down.

**SHARP:** Excuse me?

**O5-7:** If you want to know what happened to your Project Proposal, then I suggest you take a seat.

//Sharp sits in the wooden chair in front of the desk.//

**O5-7:** You probably don't know me, do you?

**SHARP:** I'm afraid I don't, sir.

**O5-7:** Heh. Used to be a time that our faces were everywhere in the Foundation. Not anymore, it seems. My name hasn't been used since before you were born, but you know me as oh-five-seven.

**SHARP:** .. Oh.

**O5-7:** Five-seven, yes. Surprised?

**SHARP:** I... wasn't aware you were going to be handling my case.

**O5-7:** I'm not. Normally your proposal would've sat at the bottom of some yellow-bellied paper-pushing secretary's desk for six months and then rejected because he had a bad day. But I've taken an interest in your little experiment.

**SHARP:** You have? Why?

**O5-7:** Yes. Tell me, how long you been working here?

**SHARP:** At Site-19? Abo-

**O5-7:** No - for the Foundation.

**SHARP:** Um, I think it's going to be 8 years this June, sir.

**O5-7:** Mmm. Not long enough.

**SHARP:** Sorry?

**O5-7:** No fault of your own. Just a consequence of your age. I was hoping you'd remember the good days. Before... this.

//O5-7 gestures around the conference room.//

**O5-7:** It wasn't always like this, y'know.

**SHARP:** Like what?

**O5-7:** Like a fucking office. The place //reeks// of bureaucracy. It wasn't like this fifteen, twenty years ago. 

**SHARP:** What //was// it like? 

**O5-7:** We were pioneers! We changed the whole goddamn world. The Atreus Array, the SRAs, we even managed to exploit the fucking eel. Nowadays you have to fill out seventeen forms and take a piss test to borrow a pen. It's ridiculous.

**SHARP:** I- Why are you telling me this?

**O5-7:** I'm hoping you can help me change that. You and your project.

**SHARP:** How?

**O5-7:** You seem to have a good head on your shoulders. Did you know that they were considering dissolving the department before your proposal?

**SHARP:** "They"?

**O5-7:** The other members of the council. They think that the state of the Foundation right now is good. They're wrong, of course -- but that's not important right now. What //is// important is that I pushed your proposal through. It's been greenlit.

**SHARP:** Oh - er, wow. Thank you, sir.

**O5-7:** And I pulled a few strings, got you some nice little gifts. Access to some of our more... unique anomalies, and a whole Site to work out of. You're now the Head Researcher of Site-05. The paperwork will all come through shortly.

**SHARP:** I... God, I can't believe this is happening.

**O5-7:** Just remember that I'm gambling a lot on this little project. Disappoint me, and both of us will suffer. I have the strength to weather the shitstorm that would fall on us. But I don't think you do.

**SHARP:** I won't disappoint you, sir. You have my word.

**O5-7:** Good man. Godspeed.

**SHARP:** Good evening.

**D-293:** W-who are you?

**SHARP:** Put simply, we represent an independent research group that has a vested interest in making sure humanity is protected from threats. 

**D-293:** Like, diseases? Nuclear war? 

**SHARP:** Not quite. We leave that to others -- I'm talking about unexplainable things. Ideas that hide themselves in your memory, species that have evolved specifically to hunt humans -- the kinds of things we used to call demons and monsters.

**D-293:** Monsters aren't real. 

**SHARP:** We make sure people keep believing that.

**D-293:** Is this some sort of joke? 

**SHARP:** Far from it. Protecting the world is bloody work. And we need your help.

**D-293:** What could you possibly want from me?

**SHARP:** We need people. We need individuals willing to work with us to protect the rest of the world from those threats. We need people with nothing left to lose.

**D-293:** I-I don't have any special skills or anything. I'm a college dropout. I don't know how I can help you.

**SHARP:** Everyone can help in their own ways. 

**D-293:** What's mine?

**SHARP:** Testing. It's ugly work, but someone has to do it. There's a lot of people counting on you. 

**D-293:** Why should I care? There's a thousand inmates in here, get someone else.

**SHARP:** There are benefits. We have influence. We can commute your sentence, make sure that your family doesn't have to suffer from your absence. They'll be provided restitution, and you can greet them in person after a few years of working for us, instead of occasionally through a glass panel and telephone.

//Silence.//

**D-293:** Alright. Okay, I'll do it.

Height and weight are about average. Hume rating is well in the range of nonanomalous. I have to say, we picked a quality test subject, about as normal as it gets. Well, I say that, and then I remember she killed a person. On that note, I'd like to make an addition to the testing schedule: Semi-regular psychological check-ups. I can't imagine this kind of testing to be good for one's mental health, and keeping the subject complacent is rather important in this venture. I'd be more than happy to handle those myself, if you'd like.

Slight drop-off in weight, accompanied by a sharp increase in height. Most of that is in the neck, which is slightly concerning based on how fragile her collarbone looks. Like it might snap with a touch. Actually, that's in regards to all her bones; she might be suffering from calcium deficiency. Regardless, she's not dead, so that's already a big plus. I'm going to recommend a higher calorie diet to make up for that weight loss. Since we haven't exposed her to any ontokinetics yet, I don't think Hume Rating will be a problem. Any fluctuations will probably just be caused by us keeping so many anomalous things in one place.

**D-293:** Oh, uh, wow. That's good, I guess.

**BOUCHER:** Alright, I'll see what I can do. And beyond that? 

**D-293:** Not good, honestly.

**BOUCHER:** And Why's that?

**D-293:** The test. I freaked out, didn't I?

**BOUCHER:** I- well, I suppose. But you handled it better than you could have.

**D-293:** It was pretty bad. I.. didn't know it would be that bad.

**BOUCHER:** It's not your fault. These kinds of.. anomalies are hard to predict, even for us. 

**D-293:** Do you guys really understand these things?

**BOUCHER:** Better than anyone else in the world.

**D-293:** The world doesn't even know about them.

**BOUCHER:** Exactly.

//[Both laugh for a moment.]//

**D-293:** Really though. I saw the look in the Sharp's eyes when he started the test.

//[BOUCHER fidgets in his seat.]//

**BOUCHER:** Well, that's what you're here for. To help us truly understand these things, the way they affect people. We're not there yet, but we're getting there.

**D-293:** I'm not really sure how changing my arm to metal would help anyone. 

**BOUCHER:** Well, we need to know how different anomalies interact with humans. When a soldier somewhere gets attacked with out of those anomalies, we're gonna be able to thank you for teaching us how it worked.

**D-293:** Hm. I... guess that makes sense.

**BOUCHER:** Every single test furthers our understanding of these things. You're an invaluable asset to this project.

**D-293:** Mhm. Thanks, doctor.

Another increase in height, though this time a weight gain came along with it. Skin has also become noticeably tougher, and feels almost reinforced. I'd like to schedule an x-ray, but I'm unsure if we can get that out here. 
Of note, I noticed bruises on her sternum during the check-up. I won't ask where they came from, but I strongly advise you to be more careful around her. Damaging your test subject is inadvisable.

**D-293:** Welcome back.

**BOUCHER:** Yeah, hey. How're you feeling? You said you were bored last time, I had them bring down a new set of books. 

**D-293:** I saw.

**BOUCHER:** Do you... like them?

**D-293:** They're fine.

**BOUCHER:** Is something wrong?

**D-293:** What do you think?

**BOUCHER:** Okay, something is wrong. Talk to me. It's what I'm here for.

**D-293:** I'm trapped in a cell for most of the day, and when I get out it's to have those insane tests run on me, and then right back in. I'm never getting out of here.

**BOUCHER:** That's not true. We've already gotten through the first round of testing, that's great progress! And you're fine, right? 

**D-293:** I don't feel fine. I feel horrible. I want to throw up and cry at the same time after I get out of the testing chamber. I don't think I've seen the sun in weeks.

//[D-293 chokes down a sob. BOUCHER moves to comfort her.]//

**BOUCHER:** Hey, hey, woah. It's okay.

**D-293:** I'm so-

**BOUCHER:** You've got nothing to be sorry about. But you do have to tell me about these things, you know. I'm here to help you.

**D-293:** Yeah. Yeah, I know.

**BOUCHER:** I'm going to see what I can do about those issues as soon as I get back to my office, alright?

**BOUCHER:** Yes?

**D-293:** I've been... noticing -- Can you answer this honestly? Please?

**BOUCHER:** Er, I'll try. What is it?

**D-293:** Do you guys know what you're doing?

**BOUCHER:** I- What do you mean?

**D-293:** The testing. I - I don't see any pattern. I can't figure out what you want from me.

**BOUCHER:** I'm... not following.

**D-293:** It seems like you're just throwing things at the wall to see what sticks. At my expense.

**BOUCHER:** Oh, no. God no. We're not animals, we have a plan.

**D-293:** What is it?

**BOUCHER:** I- You know I can't tell you.

**D-293:** I don't think you know either. 

**BOUCHER:** Look, these things aren't supposed to exist. The rest of the world doesn't even //know// about them! And we're figuring out how to safely handle them. Trust me, nobody understands these things like we do. 

**D-293:** I get that, it's just... God, I hate feeling like this.

**BOUCHER:** Like what?

**D-293:** I'm just sick and scared. All the damn time.

**BOUCHER:** Scared of what?

**D-293:** I don't know. My next test. Sharp.

If an organism sleeps in one of the coffins, within 24 hours, a clone of the organism will manifest in the cave. [[/span]]•••[[/span]] || Subject was placed into coffin, test proceeded without incident. Clone, temporarily designated D-293-b, was recovered from caves. || Notably, D-293-b was identical to D-293 prior to testing, suggesting that their DNA has not been altered. ||

Subject panicked and attempted to exit testing chamber, slamming against the door several times. When deterrent electrical shocks were applied, it attempted to break through the observation glass. Despite this, they were quickly absorbed into the rapidly-increasing mass of SCP-610. Testing was stopped and SCP-427 was applied. || The mass quickly shrank in size, disappearing entirely within four minutes. Subject was recovered from the center of the mass, unconscious. D-293-b was not recovered. Subject was noted to have significantly altered body proportions, growing by several centimeters and having more clearly visible blood vessels. ||

This testing cycle has been our most intensive yet and it's resulted in some unforeseen changes. Subject is absurdly thin and lanky, with a layer of toughened skin wrapped around a skeleton that's incredibly strong and light. They barely even look humanoid. I'm growing apprehensive about their anomalous capabilities as well -- the Localized Hume Rating can't just be a result of the other anomalies anymore, and I've put in a recommendation to turn up the SRAs in the cell. I think we need to start thinking about backup plans.

**SHARP:** Dr. Boucher. Please, sit down. Can I get you anything.

**BOUCHER:** I'm fine, thank you. 

**SHARP:** What can I do for you today?

**BOUCHER:** I have some... concerns, regarding D-293.

**SHARP:** I expected as much. Your medical updates have been telling.

**BOUCHER:** They've been disturbing. She's barely human anymore. She might as well be an anomaly.

**SHARP:** It.

**BOUCHER:** Pardon?

**SHARP:** //It// is a test subject, and you're wasting your time trying to sympathize. 

**BOUCHER:** It's human testing, Sharp. It's already terrible by nature -- you don't have to go out of your way to make it worse.

**SHARP:** Maybe it's terrible. But it's necessary.

**BOUCHER:** How on Earth is any of this necessary? What do you hope to learn? And don't give me the generic 'advancing our understanding' crap, you know I'm beyond that.

**SHARP:** This is what the Foundation has always been about. Getting our hands dirty doing the work that no one else will. Doing it so that everyone else can sleep at night. 

**BOUCHER:** You didn't answer my question.

//[SHARP sighs.]//

**SHARP:** Look. Every test had a purpose. 

**BOUCHER:** What fucking purpose? 

//[Silence.]//

**SHARP:** This isn't the 19th century anymore, Jack. We have to deal with the Insurgency, the Gocks, and two dozen world governments. We have the world's biggest treasure trove of anomalies and we don't have the balls to use them to our advantage. 

**BOUCHER:** Our job isn't to use them, it's to lock them up! You're trying to weaponize things we barely understand!

**SHARP:** If one D-class has to suffer for us to understand these things, I'm willing to take that deal. And don't even think about telling the subject or anyone else. You know exactly how they'll react.

**BOUCHER:** You bastard.

//Sound of an individual entering and closing the door.//

**SHARP:** Hello?

**[REDACTED]:** Ah! Welcome, Mr. Sharp. Please, take a seat. Can I offer you anything? Tea? Coffee? 

**SHARP:** Just water, thank you.

**[REDACTED]:** Splendid. 

**SHARP:** I'm sorry, the memo declined to provide a name -- who are you, exactly?

**[REDACTED]:** If you'll excuse the cliche, I'm afraid that's above your clearance. So, Mr. Sharp, you've been busy these last few months, haven't you?

**SHARP:** I suppose I have, yes.

**[REDACTED]:** Let's start from the beginning. Did you or did you not propose the first iteration of the proposal that would become Project London Bridge?

**SHARP:** I did. Bu-

**[REDACTED]:** And you were aware that this would result in significant harm to a Foundation employee?

**SHARP:** They're D-Class.

**[REDACTED]:** They're still our employees, for better or for worse.

**SHARP:** Then yes.

**[REDACTED]:** You requisitioned enormous resources for this little project, Mr. Sharp. Was there any advantage to be gleaned from this project?

//SHARP sighs.//

**SHARP:** Valuable scientific knowledge about the interaction of anomalies using the hum-

**[REDACTED]:** I've read the report - We both know that isn't true, and even if it was, it wouldn't matter. SCP -- Secure, Contain, Protect. Research is not in our motto, and for good reason.

**SHARP:** Cross-testing has always been allowed, encouraged!

**[REDACTED]:** We were well on our way to phasing out the cross-testing programs when your proposal was pushed through. It's not only of no benefit - it actively poses a danger to all those involved. Throwing anomalies at each other to see what happens was a hallmark of a darker age for this organization, Mr. Sharp. One that people like Seven would no doubt return to.

//(Pause.)//

**SHARP:** How did you...?

**[REDACTED]:** I've worked here for longer than you've been alive, Mr. Sharp. Seven is a military man to the bone. He remembers when we were smaller, less organized. When we could get away with things like these. I suppose he fondly recalls our forays into Project Olympia and Omega-7.

**SHARP:** Is he wrong? We could make the world a better place if we use these things, but we just sit on them! We could easily enforce order on the world, end these petty conflicts!

**[REDACTED]:** This organization is committed to making the world a safer place -- but never like that. Let's not pretend your little adventure was anything but a short-sighted attempt to weaponize those anomalies.

//[Pause.]//

**[REDACTED]:** Thank you, Mr. Sharp. You've given me a lot to think about. Expect big changes in the coming weeks.

The Department of Inter-Anomaly Experimentation is to be dissolved effective immediately. All employees are to report to their assigned Human Resources Officer for reassignment or release.

In addition, a committee is to be formed of individuals selected by the Office of the Administrator for outstanding moral resolve and adherence to the Prime Directive. Members of this Ethics Committee are to hold executive authority regarding all Foundation containment protocols, projects, and database entries, as well as the ability to nullify or overturn an Overwatch Command decision. This committee is backed by the full authority of the Office of the Administrator. The first action of this Ethics Committee will be a judgement on the events of Project LONDON BRIDGE.

//[Murmurs.]//

**ODONGO TEJANI:** Order, order. 

//[Murmurs cease.]//

**TEJANI:** After... significant deliberation, this committee is prepared to present its judgements on the events discussed. Doctor Sharp.

**SHARP:** Present.

**TEJANI:** Your reckless behaviour endangered and killed Foundation employees. As of speaking, the product of your project is in an underground vault with an innocent researcher. This fruitless venture was of no value, took tremendous resources, and was only made possible by the meddling of your co-conspirator -- Overseer Seven.

**O5-7:** In the flesh.

**TEJANI:** Your manipulation outside of your sphere of interest led to the deaths of multiple Foundation employees and depletion of significant resources. Your attempts to devolve this organization to a more primitive form have no place in today's Foundation. The Committee is prepared to render judgement. Effective immediately, Overseer Seven placed on administrative leave without pay-

**O5-7:** You motherfucker.

**TEJANI:** - while the continued terms of his employment are subject to an internal vote of the Overseer Council. Doctor Sharp is to be stripped of his Foundation credentials-

**SHARP:** //[Whispering]// No.

**TEJANI:** - with his research employment terminated - 

**SHARP:** //[Whispering]// No, no, no.

**TEJANI:** - and demoted to D-class personnel with all associated duties and status. This committee hopes these penalties will help display that the old ways have been left behind for good reason.

**SHARP:** No, n-

**O5-7:** And what about 5549? How do you plan to get rid of the time bomb you're sitting on?

**TEJANI:** We're not.

**O5-7:** You're insane. Or stupid.

**TEJANI:** D-293 only lashed out after constant mistreatment and exploitation by personnel. We'll establish containment and a security outpost to maintain it. But we're not going to poke a sleeping bear. Especially not one we've spent a year throwing rocks at. We owe it that much.

**O5-7:** It's a bit too late for that. You might not want to admit it, but this has proved me right.

**TEJANI:** Excuse me?

**O5-7:** We just used militarized troops and weapons to contain an anomaly. We're not burying our heads in the sand and shying away from it anymore. And that's all I ever wanted. The infrastructure is there now; it's only a matter of time before you decide to use it.
 
**TEJANI:** I advise you watch your words. You don't have Overseer protections anymore. If neither of you have any further qualms, this concludes this session.

But my place as RAISA Head and Ethics Committee member means that my job is making sure the Council remains true to its' principles - no offense. I can't do that as a member of it. Things are changing around here, and someone has to be there to make sure we don't lose ourselves during the fight. Thank you, but I'm going to have to decline."
