title:SCP-283
**Item #:** SCP-283

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**
Due to the strange but harmless nature of SCP-283, it is to be kept in a secure box against the east wall of whatever room it is kept in. Aside from that, SCP-283 can be handled by any personnel as long as they are observed by at least a level 3 member of personnel, who is to keep watch over SCP-283 to prevent petty theft.

**Description:**
For all intents and purposes, SCP-283 is an ordinary, slightly mottled, rock. It weights in at 1kg and is 10cm in size. However, instead of following the usual route of gravity, SCP-283 constantly falls in exact magnetic East.
First found after an investigation of poltergeist activity in ███████, Australia. Reported as the phenomenon know as 'Min Min lights' (Which interestingly enough are actually ████████, Dr.████ █████ has more to say about it in his document [DATA EXPUNGED])
According to witnesses, the rock purportedly hurtled across the plains and through the walls of a house and a car only to be stopped by a trailer, where it remained, leaving a dent, until the following morning. At first, Agent █████ believed it to be attracted by some magnetic force (Although subsequent testing has proved this false, SCP-283 acts like an ordinary granite pebble that falls sideways.) He accidentally 'dropped' it and was forced to chase it. The retrieval involved a minor head injury, but confirmed suspicions about its nature.

**Note from Dr. Wood**
//It has come to the attention of the higher level personnel that someone has been stealing SCP-283 as a paperweight. I don't care how 'zen' it looks, any further misdemeanors will be dealt will severely.//]]
