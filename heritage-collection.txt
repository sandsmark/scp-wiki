The **SCP Foundation Heritage Collection** is an official "Hall of Fame" containing articles that are considered both iconic and easily identified as well as being significant to the site's history and culture.
[[/div]]
[[/div]]

[[div style="max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto;"]]
+ Requirements

All articles in the Heritage Collection must meet the following requirements:

# The article must have both a significant presence on the SCP Foundation main list and in the SCP Foundation fan community.
# The article must be at least three (3) years old and have a favorable (positive) rating.
# The article must be sufficiently iconic that staff determines that the possibility of ever removing it from its numeric designation poses a danger of confusing the fan community.

These articles do not necessarily represent a solid canon, but represent examples of classic or core articles that are widely recognized and generally well-regarded.
