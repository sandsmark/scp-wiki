**Item #:** SCP-1117

**Object Class:** --Safe-- Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1117-1 is to be stored in a standard secured vault at Site ██.  --No additional measures are required.--  Under no circumstances are personnel to be permitted to enter the chamber or interact with the object.  Cases of SCP-1117-3 produced by accidental exposure or testing are to be placed into isolation with minimal contact.

**Description:** SCP-1117-1 is a wooden dining room table 90cm long by 150cm wide by 75cm tall.  Testing indicates that it is approximately 70 years old, and has shown no unusual preservative properties.

SCP-1117-1 is laden with a wide variety of food and drink, designated SCP-1117-2.  When consumed by subjects, it is rapidly replaced, though the exact contents of the table is not consistent.  Analysis has been unable to find a pattern; dishes and products from cultures all over the world have been observed.  Subjects display great enjoyment during the meal.  Testing has revealed that it is possible to remove dishes from the table and serve them elsewhere with the same results; subjects unaware of the food's origin still describe it as 'very tasty'.

Any who have consumed food or drink from SCP-1117-1 become subject to a secondary effect.  These individuals, designated SCP-1117-3, have the ability to cause SCP-1117-2 to spontaneously appear nearby whenever they feel hungry.  Subjects display great reluctance to consume anything other than the food that they 'find', remarking that nothing else tastes as good.  The effect can be spread if SCP-1117-3 share SCP-1117-2 with other individuals.  Aside from these effects, the 'found' food is indistinguishable from normal food.

--Given that SCP-1117 has no observed side-effects, and the benefits for agents on extended deployment with minimal resources, use of SCP-1117-1's effects for field work has been approved on a trial basis.--  The side-effects of SCP-1117 exposure only appear after several weeks.  Individuals with active lifestyles are affected notably faster.  In each case, SCP-1117-3 has dropped dead with no warning or evidence of ill-health.  D-class testing has shown an upper limit of around forty days; the agents using SCP-1117 provisions died between seventeen and twenty days after exposure.

The cause of death is unknown.  Autopsies have proved to be inconclusive.  Given the SCP's ability to spread rapidly, SCP-1117-1 has been declared off-limits.  Field agents are advised to be alert to any signs of SCP-1117 exposure in the general population.

**Addendum:** Further testing with Class D subjects has demonstrated greatly increased fatigue just prior to death.  Forcing SCP-1117-3 subjects to consume food other than SCP-1117-2 at this point has induced nausea and fatal cardiac arrest in all cases.  No hypotheses have been produced as to means of treatment for SCP-1117-3 subjects.  Testing has accordingly been halted.
