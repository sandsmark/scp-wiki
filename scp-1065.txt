**Item #:** SCP-1065

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1065-1 through SCP-1065-4 are to be contained in individual, climate-controlled storage systems that maintain a minimum local humidity of 98% and temperature not to exceed 22 degrees Celsius. No Foundation employee is to allow direct skin contact of any part of SCP-1065; disposable latex glove dispensers are to be located in any area currently containing SCP-1065.

**Description:** SCP-1065 is a four volume series of books, written in an Eastern Slavic language apparently of the early-to-mid 1800's (possibly an obscure local dialect or mixture of languages) whose title roughly translates to "The Dangers Of Free Knowledge." They are bound with red leather featuring faux-golden embossing, and show both fire and water damage around the edges along with significant yellowing of the paper. No author, print dates or other publishing information are contained within, although the materials have the appearance of being produced on a commercial printing press.

The texts of the novel reads as a treatise against education, dispersal of knowledge and, ironically, written information. The actual words use hold no anomalous properties and have been fully transcribed for study and cross-referencing (Document 1065-0011). The anomalous properties become evident when someone makes physical contact with one or more of the books, at which point they begin to subscribe to the ideas contained within, even if they do not actually read any of the text. While this begins as a general "understanding" and "mild agreement", prolonged exposure produces increased dedication to the principles put forth in the books up to and including instigation of violent uprising against established governmental and educational systems and vandalizing and destruction of written texts, especially libraries.

These effects will eventually wear off once physical contact with the book is broken, taking approximately twenty six (26) hours for every minute of continuous physical contact.

A secondary effect occurs whenever the books are left unused for a period of time exceeding one month, after which they will self-immolate. The books suffer no damage from their own produced flames, but have been shown to be vulnerable to fires produced by other means, including individuals under its effects, as well as any other sort of potential damage. The flames do not seem to be able to manifest in areas where humidity is about 95% and ambient temperatures below 23.9 C. Similarly, the flames are able to be extinguished through any standard means and show no anomalous properties besides their origin.

**Addendum:** Recently recovered records show a number of otherwise inexplicable fires occurring at a series of libraries and universities throughout eastern Europe all tied to an acquisition of SCP-1065 approximately one week before the fire. As SCP-1065 was discovered and contained following a fire in the [REDACTED] government hall shortly after the break up of the USSR, any prior records of transfer of the books had been lost and presumed destroyed in the blaze. Dr. K████ was given a citation of merit for his diligence in tracking down the prior history of the objects, as well as the theory that SCP-1065's period before ignition is significantly reduced when multiple instances are kept together, and further reduced when stored in proximity to other pieces of written knowledge.
