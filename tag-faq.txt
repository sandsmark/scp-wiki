> This document is to explain the difference between commonly misused or misunderstood tags. Please see the [[[Tag Guide]]] and [[[Attribute Tag Guide]]] for a comprehensive list of all tags used on the SCP Wiki.

++ Biology and Reproduction

+++ //organic// vs. //biological// vs. //alive//

* Something that is **//organic//** is composed of, or relates to organic compounds, such as proteins, fats, or other substances that are related to or used by living things, but not living themselves.
* Something that is **//biological//** has elements of living things, such as living tissue, organs, or other things that we would recognize as being parts of organisms, but does not show traits of actually being alive (see below). Anything that is //biological// is by default //organic//, and doesn't need to be tagged as both.
* Something that is **//alive//** conforms to the traits of living things. These vary from biologist to biologist, but generally has all of the following traits:
 * **metabolism** - All living things consume energy, use it to catalyze live processes, and excrete waste in some form (even if it's just heat).
 * **reaction** - All living things react to their environment: they chase or seek out things that they perceive as food and stay away from things that are perceived as dangerous. Even plants will turn their leaves towards the sun in order to maximize their photosynthetic potential.
 * **reproduction** - All living things reproduce, either sexually or asexually.
* Something that is //alive// is by default //biological// and //organic//, and does not need to be tagged as all three.

+++ //parasitic// vs. //contagion// vs. //self-replicating// vs. //reproductive//
* A **//parasitic//** entity is something that "feeds off" another entity. This is distinct from a //symbiotic// relationship because a //parasitic// entity does not help the host in any way; it's purely harmful. This can refer to both parasites, which simply live off and harm the host, and parasitoids, which kill the host, and neither have to necessary be biological or living in the context of the Foundation.
* A **//contagion//** is something that infects something else, and once infected, spreads to other uninfected individuals. In the context of the Foundation, this may not be a biological process, and this is distinct from a //parasitic// entity because a contagion becomes indistinguishable from the host, whereas a parasite remains a distinct entity from its host. A computer virus is also considered a //contagion//.
* A **//self-replicating//** object is something that makes copies of itself. It may accomplish this either through budding/splitting, or by turning other things or raw materials into instances. This usually, but is not always, a non-biological process.
* A **//reproductive//** object affects the biological reproductive process of a living organism. This usually means that it uses the reproductive system or organs of another living organism to make copies of itself, and is always a biological process by nature of what it is. This is distinct from a //parasite// in that it actually hijacks the reproductive process; something that merely feeds off the uterine lining of an affected animal would be a //parasite//, but something that imitates a fetus and forces the host to undergo the normal processes of pregnancy would be //reproductive//.
* //parasitic// and //contagion// are generally mutually exclusive; you can only be one or the other. //self-replicating// and //reproductive// are also generally mutually exclusive, except in extreme circumstances.

++ Senses and Mental Processes

+++ //compulsion// vs. //cognitohazard// vs. //mind-affecting// vs. //memetic//
* A **//compulsion//** is something that compels subjects to do something that they normally might not do. This is distinct from a //cognitohazard// because it does not require line of sight or any perception of the source; sometimes mere proximity is enough. This is distinct from //mind-affecting// because it's not an overriding force that **makes** you do it, it's best described as a strong urge or feeling of intense curiosity. This is also distinct from from //mind-affecting// because it's usually temporary; once a subject is removed from the presence of the //compulsion//-generating object, they will usually recover (even if it takes a long time).
* A **//cognitohazard//** is something that poses a danger to any subject that perceives it with any of our five physical senses: sight (//visual//), hearing (//auditory//), smell (//olfactory//), taste, and touch. This applies to both things that cause physical harm as well as things that cause psychological damage, but only in a way that would be anomalous. A bright light that causes blindness would not be a cognitohazard, nor would a sharp edge that cuts you when you touch it. A sound that causes you to bleed from every pore or a smell that causes you to go insane would be a //cognitohazard//.
* A **//mind-affecting//** effect is one that (usually permanently) affects the way a subject thinks. This is distinct from a //compulsion// because of its permanence and in that this is usually an intense obsession, not just a mild urge.
* A **//memetic//** agent is best described as "infectious information". It is a piece of data in a subject's mind that has an anomalous effect on that subject's physical or mental state that is spread when anyone else becomes aware of the same information. All //memetic// agents are //cognitohazards// as you can't be exposed to information without observing it somehow, but not all //cognitohazards// are //memetic//.

+++ //memetic// vs. //infohazard// vs. //meta//
* An **//infohazard//** is an object that has an effect that triggers whenever you refer to it or describe it. This is separate from a //memetic// agent because it is still an object, not a piece of information. The [[[scp-426|Toaster]]] is a prime example of an infohazard; whenever you refer to it, you always speak about it in the first person.
* A **//meta//** object is an object that affects its documentation, is affected by its documentation, or has containment procedures that extend to its documentation. This sometimes overlaps with //infohazard//, but is distinct. [[[scp-048|The Cursed Number]]] is a prime example of this; documenting an object as SCP-048 causes accidents to happen, but speaking about SCP-048 or explaining it is harmless.

+++ //acoustic// vs. //auditory// vs. //audio//
* An **//acoustic//** effect is something that is a sound wave or other type of compression wave. This means that it has to have something to act as a medium (such as air or water), and means that it exists independent of an audience. Something that can be heard by subjects but can be recorded as well is probably //acoustic//.
* An **//auditory//** effect is something that specifically refers to the sense of hearing. Something that can be heard by one or more subjects but cannot be recorded or picked up by others is an //auditory// //hallucination//. //auditory// can also be referred to //cognitohazard//s if the act of hearing triggers an effect.
* **//audio//** is a [[[Tag Guide|major tag]]], used on pages to designate that there is an audio file attached to it. It is not an attribute, and should not be included on pages that merely describe an SCP with an audio component.
