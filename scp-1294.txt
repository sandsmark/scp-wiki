 **Item #:** SCP-1294
 
**Object Class:** --Euclid-- Keter
 
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1294 is to be contained in a room measuring 5 m x 5 m x 3 m, with a filtered ventilation system. Proper medical facilities are to be maintained at all times, and one kilogram of raw meat should be provided once at 8:00 AM.
 
Interaction between staff and SCP-1294 is to be kept to a minimum. SCP-1294 feeding, grooming, and waste disposal have been automated, and all personnel must be removed from SCP-1294's containment chamber within two minutes of entering.

Mobile Task Force Xi-8 (aka "Spearhunters") are to be deployed to the Sahara desert in search of further instances of SCP-1294 under the guise of local poachers. MTF Xi-8  are to terminate instances via incineration.
 
**Description:** SCP-1294 appears to be a male fennec fox (//Vulpes zerda//) measuring 27 cm in length, and weighing approximately 1.1 kilograms at minimum. Barring hunting methods and procreation, SCP-1294 has shown no differences in behavior than that of a typical fennec fox. SCP-1294 is composed entirely of a fungal material, which replicates its skin, skeleton, fur, and internal organs.

SCP-1294 continuously exhales a toxin, originating from its lungs. If left exposed for longer than approximately two minutes, subjects will enter a consistently increasing state of euphoria until removed from SCP-1294's presence. Subjects will become briefly distressed if removed from SCP-1294, but no permanent or long-lasting effects have been found.

Subjects exposed for longer than five minutes, have shown to be highly resistant to pain, and behave in a similar manner to those under the influence of a psychedelic hallucinogen. Subjects removed from SCP-1294 have not recovered from these effects, and have been known to initiate self-harm in an attempt to provoke stimuli.

If SCP-1294 sees a subject in this state, it will lie on, or against the subject, and appear to rest. During this time, SCP-1294's skin will grow over, and eventually shift the subject into its stomach. SCP-1294 has shown no limit to what it can envelop, and is capable of processing 190 metric tons of food in one week. 

__**Test-1294-974 - ██/██/20██:**__
> **Subject:** One male fennec fox (//Vulpes zerda//)
> **Procedure:** Subject is to be introduced into SCP-1294's containment chamber. Researchers are to record any possible abnormal behavior.
> **Results:** Subject was cautious of SCP-1294 for the duration of the test. When under the effects of the toxin, SCP-1294 led the subject to the far corner of the testing chamber before the subject was knocked unconscious. SCP-1294 did not attempt to consume the subject, and instead lay down against the opposite corner until the subject was retrieved. Subject later made a full recovery.

__**Test-1294-975 - ██/██/20██:**__
> **Subject:** One female fennec fox (//Vulpes zerda//)
> **Procedure:** Subject is to be introduced into SCP-1294's containment chamber. Researchers are to record any abnormal behavior.
> **Results:** Once released in the containment chamber, SCP-1294 began to watch the subject intently, until it became affected by the toxin. Once the subject was unconscious, SCP-1294 then proceeded to mate with it. Subject woke up afterwards, and attempted to leave the cell by clawing at the door. SCP-1294 showed little interest in the subject after intercourse. Subject was left alone in the cell for five minutes, and did not appear to be affected by the toxic environment.
> **Analysis:** Subject was collected from SCP-1294's containment area, and has been given its own chamber to separate it from SCP-1294. 

__**Test-1294-976; - ██/██/20██:**__
> **Subject:** The female fennec fox (//Vulpes zerda//) from test 975
> **Procedure:** Observe the behavior of the previous subject.
> **Results:**
> //00:00:00-01:49:32// -Upon containment, subject has become increasingly restless, attempting to lie down and rest, but getting up to move soon after. Subject began hyperventilating at 01:44:29, and eventually wore itself out.
> 
> //01:49:33-01:55:56// -Subject experiences an epileptic seizure, and begins to foam at the mouth. Subject ceases to move at 1:50:53.
> 
> //01:55:57-04:23:33// -Movement detected under the subject's skin. Abdomen becomes distended by ten centimeters at 04:23:33, as if pregnant.
> 
> //04:23:34-05:22:50// -Fungal growths start to protrude from the subject's orifices, and pierce through its skin. Growths are a light tan in color, with sparse black spots sparsely placed throughout the pileus. Abdomen extends to 54 centimeters in diameter.
> 
> //05:22:51-05:23:58// -Subject begins to stand up, and crawl in an unnatural and sporadic fashion, as if being moved from the tendrils inside it. Subject collapsed to the floor upon reaching the far corner.
> 
> //05:23:59-05:58:54// -The fungal growths begin to take root on the surrounding walls, and eventually grow up to the ceiling. A large pod begins to protrude from the subject's chest cavity, while the abdomen stops growing at two meters.
> 
> //05:58:55-06:19:29// -Pod continues to emerge, causing the subject's chest to give way to a large hole. At 06:16:22, the pod produces one ball covered in a fur like substance with a diameter of 42 centimeters. Upon hitting the ground, the specimen begins to shift about, shrinking to fit a quadrupedic figure. The ball's 'skin' starts to become tighter as several orifices start to appear, revealing eyes, teeth, etc., at 06:19:11. By 06:19:29, the specimen appears identical to a member of the //Vulpes zerda// species.
> 
> //06:19:30-09:44:34// -Subject repeats the process a total of ███ times before ceasing at 09:44:34. Of the ███ specimens produced, 266 achieved sentience, while the remainder had either died and dried up, or formed a collective mass, covering the floor.
> 
> **Analysis:** Examination of every specimen from the subject shows that each one is nearly identical to SCP-1294 in appearance, effect, and the formation of internal organs. Most notably, all specimens appear to be male. Only minor alterations such as eye color, fur color, and minimum size have been found between specimens, and DNA testing has shown that all specimens contain DNA belonging to both SCP-1294 and the subject before conception.

**Addendum-1294-1:** 25 specimens from the subject have been given the designations SCP-1294-A through -Y, with identical containment procedures to SCP-1294. The remainder of specimens have been incinerated after study, along with the remains of the subject from tests 975 and 976. Following test-1294-976, SCP-1294 has been given a Keter re-classification. The possibility of offspring are highly likely due to its high birth rate. Any reports of abnormally large foxes and/or fungi in the area should be brought to the site's designated head researcher for investigation.
