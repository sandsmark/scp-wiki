**Item #:** SCP-1079
 
**Object Class:** Safe
 
**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-1097 are currently stored within Containment Locker-1097 at Site-19.  Furthermore, watchlist databases are to be updated with SCP-1097's information, in order to intercept any new shipments which may appear in the future.
 
**Description:**  SCP-1097 is the designation given to a number of sweets brightly labelled "Dr. Wondertainment's Bubblebath Bonbons!®". Currently, the Foundation has █ crates of SCP-1097 in containment, originally containing 64 packets each.   The label lists negative percent daily values of several nutrients, vitamins, and minerals, none of which are present in SCP-1097.  The label also contains an age warning, which reads: "Not suitable for children under 3 years".

Human subjects report tingling sensations immediately after the consumption of SCP-1097.  Ten to fifteen seconds later, the subject's own blood is secreted as pink, bubblegum-scented foam from the subject's pores on their gut, arms and back.  The total volume of blood secreted in this way is typically from 30-50 mL and does not pose an immediate health risk.  


The volume of blood secreted increases exponentially as more pieces are consumed; Bubbles form in the subject's blood as a consequence of the SCP's intended function, causing the subject's blood to boil.  Death by exsanguination occurs in 95% of subjects who have consumed 4 or more candies in one sitting. Exsanguination is compounded by foam collecting in the lungs of the consumer.  After standardized animal testing was conducted, it was found that SCP-1097's effect scales with the consumer's body mass.


**Addendum:** Since its initial discovery in ██/██/1990, ██ deliveries have been made to various supermarkets globally. Attempts to trace these deliveries back to a distribution center or supplier have been unsuccessful as of ██/██/2005.
