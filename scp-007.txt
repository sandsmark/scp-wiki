**Item #:** SCP-007 

**Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-007 is to be contained in a sealed room measuring 10 m on each side. Room is to be furnished comfortably as a living area, along with whatever items are requested by ███████████████ (hereafter referred to as Subject-007-1), given that providing Subject-007-1 with requested items would not compromise security. Subject is not to be allowed to leave the room, and is to be detained with force if necessary. 

**Description:** SCP-007 is located within a cavity in the abdomen of Subject-007-1. 

Subject-007-1 is a Caucasian male, approximately 25 years of physical age (subject claims to be 28) and 176 cm in height. Most of Subject-007-1's abdomen is absent of bone, muscle, organ, and fat tissues, though the subject does not appear to suffer because of this. 

Instead of normal flesh, a sphere composed of soil and water, SCP-007, is present. This sphere floats approximately 3 centimeters from all remaining inner surfaces of  Subject-007-1's abdomen, and does not make physical contact at any time. The sphere appears to be, in most aspects, a near-duplication of the Earth in miniature, measuring approximately 60 cm in diameter. 

Despite similarities, continental alignment is not consistent with that of any alignment known in Earth's history. This was confirmed in comparison to Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, Cretacious, and Present, and Future tectonic pattern analysis.

SCP-007 has its own weather patterns and negligible gravitational pull, in addition to microscopic organisms somewhat resembling modern Earthlings inhabiting it. Two intelligent species have been observed, though contact and communication with either has yet to be made. Technology levels of observed species must be checked at least once a week and, as of ██/████, are approximately equal to that of 15th-Century Earth, commonly referred to as "The Middle Ages". 

Subject-007-1 claims to be named ███████████████, but no records of such a person can be found. Subject does not require food or water, and while he has been observed consuming both, what happens to consumed substances after being swallowed is unknown. 

Subject-007-1 is intelligent and amiable, with his █████ standardized score measuring at 128 IQ points. The subject regards the planet in his abdomen as a minor curiosity, and seems to experience no stress about his unusual condition. When questioned about planet's origins, the subject has replied, "I just woke up one day, and there it was. I don't have any idea how it got there." Subject has provided a Social Security number and driver's license number and requested that they be checked against known records. When checked, it was discovered that neither had yet been allocated to any known individual.

Dr. ███████ has a weekly chess game with Subject-007-1, during which his mental health is evaluated. Dr. ███████ reports that Subject-007-1 does not seem to mind the restricted living environment, and has yet to attempt to escape or show signs of violence or mental illness.

Subject-007-1 has, however, repeatedly requested a computer with an internet connectivity. It is recommended that this not be provided as it would impede the Foundation's security.
