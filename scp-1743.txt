**Item #:** SCP-1743

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to its nature, SCP-1743 cannot be moved and thus requires on-site containment.  The single entrance to SCP-1743 is to be barred with a series of deadbolt locks, operated by an electronic device programmed to respond only to Foundation identification cards.  The electronic module and deadlocks are to be inspected on a daily basis, and any damages are to be repaired immediately.  This entrance is also programmed to alert security in the event that it is opened.

Personnel are not to enter SCP-1743 for any reason other than to retrieve a disk from SCP-1743-1 and for maintenance, and should enter in a group of no less that three (3).  Should any unauthorized individual enter SCP-1742, they should be immediately subdued and treated with a Class-A amnesiac.  Lethal force should be avoided as to not raise any suspicion.  Security personnel are to never come within two (2) meters of SCP-1743's stage; these perimeters have been laid out with a connection of chain fence.

Should any individual be placed onstage, thus activating SCP-1743, security are required to alert Site-██ as soon as possible via radio contact.  When SCP-1743 returns to its dormant state, the disk held by SCP-1743-1 should be collected and sent to Site-██ for review.  Personnel are advised to make no effort to remove subjects from SCP-1743's stage **(See Addendum 1743-A)**.

**Description:** SCP-1743 is a sound stage located at ██████ Studio Center, the sort usually used for a studio audience television program.  There are no records of when it was built or who authorized its construction.  Those employed at ██████ Studio Center similarly have no memory of how it came to be.  For the purpose of a cover story, those employed at the ██████ Studio Center have been convinced that the building was abandoned after a fire in 1987.

Anomalous effects are observed when an individual goes onstage, which tends to happen due to a "luring" effect in which one will have a strong desire to mount said stage.  The stage may only be entered by climbing on from the audience area; so far, the nature of the backstage area is completely unknown and cannot be entered or observed by any means.  When SCP-1743 goes into this active state, subjects onstage are completely unable to return to the audience until their vital functions have ceased.  Rather than knowing that they are trapped onstage, subjects will perceive themselves to be going about their daily lives as the stage will shift its backgrounds and environment to fit such delusions.  In reality, subjects are unwittingly taking part in a situation comedy television show.

SCP-1743-1, which appears to be a standard television studio camera, will record the stage nonstop when SCP-1743 is in its active state.  Remarkably, it is capable of storing all information on a single DVD, which is retrievable subsequent to SCP-1743's return to a dormant state.  How these DVDs are capable of storing so much information is currently unknown, as SCP-1743 usually remains in its active state for several days at a time.

SCP-1743-2 are humanoids which appear as people whom the onstage subject knows in real life or would know in real life, wearing clothes that said people would wear along with other remarkable characteristics such as facial hair and personal objects.  The most defining characteristic, however, is the complete lack of eyes, ears, a nose, or a mouth, all replaced by a layer of skin covering the face.  However, instances of SCP-1743-2 are still able to "speak" by an unknown means, and subjects onstage seem to not perceive their lack of facial structure.

SCP-1743-3 is the only part of SCP-1743 that onstage subjects will notice as different from their normal lives.  SCP-1743-3 is an event in which pre-recorded laughter, applause, and other audible reactions will emanate from the audience section without any speaker system or specific source.  These reactions usually take place at "humorous" parts of the onstage show which would usually be otherwise very unfortunate, such as the subject falling down a flight of stairs, receiving an unemployment notice, or being informed of the death of a loved one.  This often leads to outbursts of frustration, anger, and despair in the onstage subjects, sometimes resulting in suicide.

**Addendum 1743-A:** 

On ██/██/██, an attempt was made by Agent ██████ to recover Dr. ████ from SCP-1743 with a series of winch machinery.  However, the machinery malfunctioned, resulting in Agent ██████'s leg getting caught in the wire rope and being pulled onstage.  When onstage, Agent ██████ attempted to warn Dr. ████ of SCP-1743's influence, but was stopped by two instances of SCP-1743-2 resembling Foundation Security Personnel.  Agent ██████ was then taken backstage, and has since not been recovered.  

From this incident, it is presumed that attempting to remove subjects from SCP-1743 will only result in one being pulled onstage themselves, and no rescue attempts should be made.
