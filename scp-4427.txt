**Item #:** SCP-4427

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** As there is no accurate method of predicting SCP-4427 manifestation times, SCP-4427 is considered uncontainable; however, most cases appear[[footnote]]67% of cases documented both on thermal camera and by Foundation personnel have occurred in this setting.[[/footnote]] to take place at political events -- particularly rallies for topics pertaining to regulation of the anomalous -- and these events should be monitored accordingly. Further public protection efforts should be directed toward thermal imaging surveillance of high-traffic roads and walkways; if SCP-4427 is seen, the area surrounding it should be cordoned off with traffic cones or similar construction signage before 45 people have passed through it. The anomaly will demanifest within 12 hours, and during this period should be guarded by at least two personnel with 3/4427 clearance. Civilian inquiries are to be directed to Site-42 Media Relations & Support, and should not be answered by on-duty containment personnel.

MTF Alpha-42 ("Highway Patrol") are tasked with monitoring densely populated areas and responding to the AC-27 satellite reconnaissance system's alerts for SCP-4427 detection by means of contacting the Site nearest to activity; as the AC-27 system has been designed to automatically recognize SCP-4427 by exact size and temperature, live monitoring of feeds is encouraged but not necessary. If Foundation personnel are out of range of the anomaly and cannot respond within a reasonable time frame, city and state police departments are authorized to respond if provided with only the information necessary to maintain security until Foundation personnel arrive.

Anomalies whose effects or traits were induced solely by SCP-4427 and did not exist prior to SCP-4427 are to be designated SCP-4427-A instances and transferred to Site-42. SCP-4427-A instances may be assigned different Object Classes depending on their effects, but must retain their -4427-A designation. SCP-4427-A instances are to be handled with Level 2 Sapient Anomaly (Low Security Threat) precautions, allowed Class IV (Limited Civilian) privileges, and contained individually provided their continued cooperation unless behavioral exceptions must be made. Requests to retain civilian identity if effects remain present after six months from the initial containment date may be submitted in writing by the anomaly in question to the Ethics Committee Department of Sentient and Sapient Anomalies through any on-duty containment personnel.

As SCP-4427-B appears to be affected by SCP-4427 in a manner different from that of SCP-4427-A instances, it is contained and designated separately from SCP-4427-A instances despite being the first human affected by the anomaly. SCP-4427-B is not to be informed of the fact that its anomalous effects are the result of SCP-4427 influence; thus, it is to be addressed as SCP-4427 in conversation. SCP-4427-B should be handled with Level 3 Sapient Anomaly (Moderate Security Threat) precautions and allowed Class II (Limited Contained) privileges.[[footnote]]Reclassified Nov 2023 following behavior improvements.[[/footnote]]

**Description:** SCP-4427 designates a phenomena by which an incorporeal anomaly -- visible only in thermal imaging as a 37.8°C sphere exactly 60 centimeters in diameter -- will spontaneously manifest in a high-traffic location and remain stationary at a height of 1.5 meters until exactly 45 people have passed through the volume of space it occupies, at which point it will disappear. If this process is interrupted and fewer than 45 people have passed through it, it will disappear 12 hours after last contact.

Within 1 hour of SCP-4427's demanifestation, one of the 45 people affected will develop severe and destructive anomalous traits, ranging in effect from localized temperature alteration by several hundred degrees (13 instances) to full Class V Scranton-Type reality manipulation abilities (25 instances) but including numerous other results including but not limited to atypical rapid cellular growth resulting in death by asphyxiation (4 instances), instant transformation of bodily fluids into water resulting in death by heart failure (2 instances), or random spatial relocation of the affected individual and all objects on their person by 300-500 meters upward, resulting in death by impact (5 instances). Effects developed are never controllable by the individual affected.

Since SCP-4427's existence was initially noted by the Foundation in October 2019, statistics saw an increase of 40% in global media reporting on the topic of human anomalies and an estimated 175% increase in confirmed cases of human anomalies existing and/or civilians being made anomalous through unknown means; approximately 3500 individual reports of human anomalies were noted worldwide by the United Nations in 2024, a 73% increase from 2023.

It is unknown if SCP-4427 is capable of affecting all living organisms or only humans, as a statistically insufficient number of animals have been witnessed passing through SCP-4427. As SCP-4427 manifestation has only been directly confirmed by Foundation personnel in 97 cases, it is also unknown if SCP-4427 is one anomaly or multiple instances of identical anomalies, though the former is assumed based on circumstantial evidence. The possibility that SCP-4427 is sapient is considered unlikely but has not been ruled out by research staff. Research inquiries should be directed to Mallory Wickerford at Site-42.

SCP-4427 was discovered on May 14, 2019 when Jasper Ramirez (SCP-4427-B), who was staying in Myrtle Beach with family and had passed through SCP-4427 on the sidewalk outside 15 minutes prior to manifestation of effects, began to exhibit uncontrollable reality- and matter-altering effects. The events resulting from these effects were witnessed by two Site-42 Offsite Response operatives who were in Myrtle Beach on an unrelated assignment, and these personnel then carried out containment of SCP-4427-B following multiple civilian casualties. For details, see Addendum I.

SCP-4427-B was originally classified alone under the SCP-4427 designation as a Type E Class II Scranton-Type Human Anomaly due to the fact that there were no other known SCP-4427 manifestation cases as of that point and its maternal second cousin was reportedly also subject to uncontrollable reality-altering effects for the majority of his life. However, the next SCP-4427 manifestation occurred 4 months later, with occurrences becoming exponentially frequent from that point forward; following investigation, SCP-4427 was reclassified as SCP-4427-B and the designation assigned to the source anomaly accordingly.

Of note is the fact that SCP-4427-B is incapable of retaining information regarding its status as a human affected by SCP-4427. All attempts to explain its circumstances are accepted, but forgotten within 2-5 minutes thereafter; SCP-4427-B also claims that attempts to force recollection of this information induce headache and general discomfort in a manner noted to be extremely similar to the conceptual memory loss induced by [[[SCP-3848]]].

**Addendum II:** Interview Transcript: After more than five other cases of reality-altering effects caused by SCP-4427 activity were documented, including photographically, SCP-4427-B was interviewed regarding SCP-4427 and what it experienced the day it was initially contained. Prior to arranging this interview, SCP-4427-B had adamantly refused to comment on the circumstances resulting in its containment.

> 
> **BEGIN LOG 16:01**
> 
> **16:01 | Dr. Wickerford:** Good afternoon, SCP-4427. It is my understanding that you've elected to detail what happened on May 14th.
> 
> **16:01 | SCP-4427-B:** Yeah. Only since you said you might know something about it.
> 
> **16:01 | Dr. Wickerford:** Correct. Now, the record states that our operatives arrived approximately 45 seconds after the effects initially manifested. At this point, the effects in question had already destroyed most of the wall in your bedroom, and had sent a large amount of debris onto the sidewalk, injuring two people. You then exited the home through this hole, after which point a localized spatial anomaly manifested over four square meters of the yard, enveloping two more people; you were then about to fall into this anomaly yourself, eyewitness report states, but Agents Trauss and Rogers apprehended you and managed to stabilize the area immediately surrounding you from 30 to 85 Humes and you yourself from 275 to 130 Humes, allowing for incapacitation and containment. Is this accurate?
> 
> **16:02 | SCP-4427-B:** I mean, you make it sound like I went along with all of that, but sure.
> 
> **16:02 | Dr. Wickerford:** It's intended to be a summary. Would you detail whether you felt any onset of the effects beforehand, if you perceived anything abnormal about your surroundings or mental state before the onset, things like that?
> 
> **16:02 | SCP-4427-B:** Okay. I'd had a horrendous day. I hadn't wanted to come back to Myrtle Beach from Clemson anyway because all my friends down here know me by my deadname and I didn't want to deal with anyone recognizing me. But I made the drive that day for part of spring break because they'd insisted on cleaning the dorms during that time. I'm- or I was- too old to be in college anyway, so that's what I get, I guess.
> 
> **16:02 | Dr. Wickerford:** Please go on.
> 
> **16:03 | SCP-4427-B:** Uh, alright. I was really stressed out, my pulse was thumping, my head felt cloudy, nothing felt real. I was just in my room pacing, trying to think about what I could do with my time in town, things like that. I started feeling like I was drunk, or something. It got worse after I stepped near the lamp and got this awful circular lens flare on my glasses -- just totally blinded me for a second.
> 
> **16:03 | Dr. Wickerford:** Circular, you say?
> 
> **16:03 | SCP-4427-B:** Yeah, you know, a lens flare. It was weird to get it under that light, but whatever.
> 
> **16:03 | Dr. Wickerford:** Noted.
> 
> **16:03 | SCP-4427-B:** Anyway, that made it worse. Made the head throbbing worse. I just got pissed and I kicked my bed. I don't know why I did; I had my shoes off and I knew that it had a metal frame. But I did, and my foot went straight through it, and I could feel the old foam inside the mattress on my foot skin and it freaked me the fuck out. And I stumbled backward and I saw my foot just slide out of the mattress metal like it was- like they were computer models, like 3D- like in a game, you know what I mean, just going straight through each other. I felt like I was going to throw up, and I spent a few seconds just leaning there keeled over, but it felt like an hour.
> 
> **16:04 | Dr. Wickerford:** When you say it felt like an hour, do you mean literally? Do you think you were experiencing time distortion?
> 
> **16:04 | SCP-4427-B:** Yeah. I do. I thought about my fingertips against my jeans for at least 45 minutes. But when I looked at the clock, it had only been a few.
> 
> **16:04 | Dr. Wickerford:** Noted.
> 
> **16:04 | SCP-4427-B:** I get stuck in my head a lot. Sometimes it makes me feel worse. Maybe I wouldn't have hated you guys so much for the first couple months if I felt like I'd actually made something of my life out there before the Foundation got me.
> 
> **16:04 | Dr. Wickerford:** I see.
> 
> **16:04 | SCP-4427-B:** Uh, anyway, I stood up and just felt really zoomed out. I looked at the wall and I just reached for it, because it looked fisheye, like it was 20 feet away from me, but I could see the end of my hands were almost touching it. And then it just crumbled -- like, I made it crumble. I guess it was on purpose. It just felt really //possible,// like I was in a dream and everything was just too easy to do. Doing it made my gut feel awful. From there I just panicked. My vision got normal again and I ran outside because it was hot inside and cold outside and that felt safer than staying around my family and feeling sicker and- yeah. And when I did that, well, you probably saw pictures of how busy that street is. It's downtown, and even on a Tuesday -- was it a Tuesday? -- there are dozens of people around. I don't know why I went out there.
> 
> **16:05 | Dr. Wickerford:** You were panicking. Please continue.
> 
> **16:05 | SCP-4427-B:** Yeah, I was. But you know the rest. I'd been seeing news about the Foundation nonstop and I hated you guys with a passion. Seeing that goddamn SUV pull up- I felt like I was going to explode. Everything in me was just screaming to run for my life. Maybe you guys should tone down your uniforms or something. The public's not used to you yet, and I definitely wasn't. That was when I felt myself slipping into that hole in the ground... type thing. But your men ran over to me with those blue-glowing devices and I started to feel a little less like I was drunk, and the hole in the ground started looking like grass again except some people were missing, and things started to feel real again. And then they knocked me out and here I am.
> 
> **16:05 | Dr. Wickerford:** I can offer a belated apology for the methods through which you were secured-
> 
> **16:05 | SCP-4427-B:** You can save it. I don't give a shit at this point, whether the public is watching or not.
> 
> **16:05 | Dr. Wickerford:** I see.
> 
> **16:05 | SCP-4427-B:** You said you had information on what could have caused this?
> 
> **16:05 | Dr. Wickerford:** Yes. An anomaly has been appearing which seems to cause one in forty-five humans who made spatial contact with its volume to develop anomalous effects at random, just like you did. The Offsite Response agents who happened to be in Myrtle Beach that day definitely saw it on the street near your home, though we can't identify if you're in the images because it's thermal. Once we realized that it was causation and not just correlation -- the people developing effects and the thermal images of the sphere manifesting in areas a lot of people pass through, that is -- we started tracking it and the picture came together. That was several weeks after we'd contained you individually, of course.
> 
> **16:06 | SCP-4427-B:** What is it?
> 
> **16:06 | Dr. Wickerford:** Well, it's a sphere, and it's one hundred degrees Fahrenheit but not visible to the naked eye. Did you feel any heat on you at any point on the sidewalk?
> 
> **16:06 | SCP-4427-B:** Not that I remember. But it's cold out; I could have thought something hot was car exhaust or machinery or something. A hundred isn't that hot. And I walked down a lot of city streets that day.
> 
> **16:06 | Dr. Wickerford:** Noted. And you said you saw a circle in your bedroom that was abnormal? Not on the street?
> 
> **16:06 | SCP-4427-B:** That could have been a lens flare.
> 
> **16:06 | Dr. Wickerford:** Alright, I'll take your word for it.
> 
> //SCP-4427-B appears visibly uncomfortable.//
> 
> **16:06 | SCP-4427-B:** I'm not sure. 
> 
> **16:06 | Dr. Wickerford:** Okay. Did you have any other experiences immediately prior to your detainment that would give us clues as to how one could identify the anomaly without thermal imaging equipment? It's currently a serious threat to public safety.
> 
> **16:07 | SCP-4427-B:** What anomaly?
> 
> **16:07 | Dr. Wickerford:** The sphere which triggered your effects.
> 
> //SCP-4427-B leans over the table and lowers its voice.//
> 
> **16:07 | SCP-4427-B:** No, I didn't see any sphere. Whatever you're talking about is- weird, like I'm not supposed to be talking about that. It's making me feel like I have a hole in the head. And like someone is listening. You know, I thought I saw something weird like a lens flare near a lamp. Did I tell you that already? But when I looked, [[[a-day-notable-to-nobody|nobody was there.]]]
> 
> //Dr. Wickerford finishes transcribing information.//
> 
> **16:07 | Dr. Wickerford:** Interesting. You appear to have some trouble remembering these events. I'll be interviewing you again tomorrow, if that's okay.
> 
> **16:07 | SCP-4427-B:** I guess.
> 
> **16:07 | Dr. Wickerford:** Very well. Thank you for your time, SCP-4427.
> 
> **16:07 | SCP-4427-B:** It's all yours anyway.
> 
> **END LOG 16:07**
