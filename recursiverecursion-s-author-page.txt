> [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2789 SCP-2789: Self-Replicating Fast Food Chain (E)]
[[collapsible show="+ Show commentary" hide="- Hide commentary"]]
SCP-2789 was the first skip I wrote for the site, and the only one so far that didn't make it the first time I posted it. The first edition was kind of shit, I'll admit that, not that I meant it to be. After receiving feedback, I reposted about a month afterwards, having added two interviews, as well as removing a few [REDACTED]s and [DATA EXPUNGED]s. Despite it kind of being a rocky start for me, Mammon, my personal name for SCP-2789-1, is probably one of my favorite characters that I've written. He was definitely fun to write, as I primarily based him off of Funny or Die's [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSBFTKI-zIM KFC Loves Gays] behaviorallywise. Oh god that is not a word. But anywho, my biggest inspiration for the idea of self-replicating fast food chains was chains like Starbucks. Ever been driving past a street, and you see a Starbucks or a McDonald's that you could have sworn wasn't there before? Well, I have at least. Maybe I just have a bad memory. But that started up the old thinkermajig, and before you knew it, I'd posted my first skip.

> [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2967 SCP-2967: Sapient Cephalopods (E)]
[[collapsible show="+ Show commentary" hide="- Hide commentary"]]
I wrote this one after I ate too much calamari and had a nightmare about octopuses and crows destroying the world.

Just kidding, my biggest inspiration for this one was a documentary that I saw about octopuses, the exact name of which escapes me ;_;. The documentary was about octopus intelligence, and how they can learn from each other, as well as how some octopuses in certain parts of the ocean are starting to form more closely knit groups due to overfishing limiting their food sources. So I thought: what if the octopus is getting ready to be the next dominant species? Then I posted a boring-ass draft to the forums that had one octopus that could read and write, and really hated this one crow. And then I was told it was boring, so I added more about the crow and his own followers, as well as giving Levi a bunch of friends to play with. And thus, it was posted!

> [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1933-ex SCP-1933-EX: Lake ███████ Monster (EX)]
[[collapsible show="+ Show commentary" hide="- Hide commentary"]]
Believe it or not, I actually wrote this one in less than an hour. I was browsing the forums, and I saw a draft titled 'Messie'. It reminded me of 'Nessie', so that was stuck on my mind for a few hours. While I was having lunch later that day, it struck me- A parody of horribly staged lake monsters; one that makes you think it's a hoax! I dropped my drink cup and sandwich as I whipped out my phone and scribbled that in my notes app for later. And then curled up in a ball and cried because I dropped my drink cup and sandwich. Jk. As soon as I got home, I started writing, and I was done before you know it. I went into it with the mindset that the monster was indeed real, but I did try to make it pretty ambiguous.

> [http://www.scp-wiki.net/mr-doggo Mr. Doggo (GoI)]
[[collapsible show="+ Show commentary" hide="- Hide commentary"]]
Much doggo, very wow. This was another one I managed to get out pretty quickly. I started working on a GoI format that used the Gamers Against Weed and the Serpent's Hand after I read some of SpectralDragon and Zyn's Hand articles, and I thought the two would mesh well together, given how they both tend to be open document sort of things with a lot of different members contributing towards one thing, in a sense. My original concept, which I abandoned, was M E M E  M A G I C K, which would have taken the popular joke on 4chan that getting dubs means that Kek has blessed your post, and it will come to pass, and playing it as the GAW have actually found a way to make this a reality. This was the birth of two characters known as Hugin and Munin, who I named after Odin's ravens. They each represented a school of thought in the Hand, one that thought the GAW were a sign that the average person was becoming more knowledgeable about magic and the anomalous world, and a camp that thought the GAW were dangerous people, and were frankly more insulted that //they// of all people had mastered magic. H&M carried over into Mr. Doggo, which was inspired by the Misters Against Weed written by Communism will Win and Kinchtheknifeblade. I didn't start writing the article having a good idea of what Mr. Doggo would do, but it sort of came to me as I wrote, if that makes any sense. This was by far one of the most fun articles to write, Serpent's Hand formats are so damn fun.

It's a UE. What were you expecting? A text wall? Jk, jk. I got the idea from watching Kitchen nightmares and watching Gordon Ramsay rage about vegetarians.

Hey, you told me to email you at this address if I thought something odd was happening. I'm getting contacts from someone at that local Burger Place that showed up a while ago, asking about the Deadly Sins? He said there were 9, which I'm pretty sure is wrong, but it still weirded me out. He said his name was Manny or something like that, and you were doing something that involved them. Is he a friend from work?
