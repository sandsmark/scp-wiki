Dr. Reynard is currently stationed at Site-45.

**History:** Dr. Beckham Reynard joined the Foundation in the late 1900s after --a long drug binge-- --being kicked out of every town in the North American continent-- --joining a recruitment drive-- --wandering into site-19 in a drunken stupor--. Previous history of Dr. Reynard is scarcely known, mostly due to his consistent neglect of filling out this article, but he is believed to have a --wife-- --husband-- --bdsm playmate-- --mom's basement-- that he returns to when not on site. Dr. Reynard was initially located at what was previously an abandoned castle, which was investigated after being reported mysteriously missing. Dr. Reynard was found in the wreckage, wearing copious amounts of makeup and a feather boa. Investigation of Dr. Reynard's claim of aliens from '█████████, ███████████' is underway, but unlikely to produce results.

> [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2789 SCP-2789: Self-Replicating Fast Food Chain (E)]
[[collapsible hideLocation="both" show="+ Show commentary" hide="- Hide commentary"]]
SCP-2789 was the first skip I wrote for the site, and the only one so far that didn't make it the first time I posted it. The first edition was kind of shit, I'll admit that, not that I meant it to be. After receiving feedback, I reposted about a month afterwards, having added two interviews, as well as removing a few [REDACTED]s and [DATA EXPUNGED]s. Despite it kind of being a rocky start for me, Mammon, my personal name for SCP-2789-1, is probably one of my favorite characters that I've written. He was definitely fun to write, as I primarily based him off of Funny or Die's [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSBFTKI-zIM KFC Loves Gays] behaviorallywise. Oh god that is not a word. But anywho, my biggest inspiration for the idea of self-replicating fast food chains was chains like Starbucks. Ever been driving past a street, and you see a Starbucks or a McDonald's that you could have sworn wasn't there before? Well, I have at least. Maybe I just have a bad memory. But that started up the old thinkermajig, and before you knew it, I'd posted my first skip.

> [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2967 SCP-2967: Sapient Cephalopods (E)]
[[collapsible hideLocation="both" show="+ Show commentary" hide="- Hide commentary"]]
I wrote this one after I ate too much calamari and had a nightmare about octopuses and crows destroying the world.

Just kidding, my biggest inspiration for this one was a documentary that I saw about octopuses, the exact name of which escapes me ;_;. The documentary was about octopus intelligence, and how they can learn from each other, as well as how some octopuses in certain parts of the ocean are starting to form more closely knit groups due to overfishing limiting their food sources. So I thought: what if the octopus is getting ready to be the next dominant species? Then I posted a boring-ass draft to the forums that had one octopus that could read and write, and really hated this one crow. And then I was told it was boring, so I added more about the crow and his own followers, as well as giving Levi a bunch of friends to play with. And thus, it was posted!

[[collapsible hideLocation="both" show="+ Show commentary" hide="- Hide commentary"]]
Believe it or not, I actually wrote this one in less than an hour. I was browsing the forums, and I saw a draft titled 'Messie'. It reminded me of 'Nessie', so that was stuck on my mind for a few hours. While I was having lunch later that day, it struck me- A parody of horribly staged lake monsters; one that makes you think it's a hoax! I dropped my drink cup and sandwich as I whipped out my phone and scribbled that in my notes app for later. And then curled up in a ball and cried because I dropped my drink cup and sandwich. Jk. As soon as I got home, I started writing, and I was done before you know it. I went into it with the mindset that the monster was indeed real, but I did try to make it pretty ambiguous.

[[collapsible hideLocation="both" show="+ Show commentary" hide="- Hide commentary"]]
Much doggo, very wow. This was another one I managed to get out pretty quickly. I started working on a GoI format that used the Gamers Against Weed and the Serpent's Hand after I read some of SpectralDragon and Zyn's Hand articles, and I thought the two would mesh well together, given how they both tend to be open document sort of things with a lot of different members contributing towards one thing, in a sense. My original concept, which I abandoned, was M E M E  M A G I C K, which would have taken the popular joke on 4chan that getting dubs means that Kek has blessed your post, and it will come to pass, and playing it as the GAW have actually found a way to make this a reality. This was the birth of two characters known as Hugin and Munin, who I named after Odin's ravens. They each represented a school of thought in the Hand, one that thought the GAW were a sign that the average person was becoming more knowledgeable about magic and the anomalous world, and a camp that thought the GAW were dangerous people, and were frankly more insulted that //they// of all people had mastered magic. H&M carried over into Mr. Doggo, which was inspired by the Misters Against Weed written by Communism will Win and Kinchtheknifeblade. I didn't start writing the article having a good idea of what Mr. Doggo would do, but it sort of came to me as I wrote, if that makes any sense. This was by far one of the most fun articles to write, Serpent's Hand formats are so damn fun. [[size 0%]] Shoutout to the one guy who downvoted less than a minute after I posted lmao[[/size]]

[[collapsible hideLocation="both" show="+ Show commentary" hide="- Hide commentary"]]
This one went through a lot of revisions, and actually started out with an idea I got from the SCP inspiration thread in the ideas board. Well, sort of, it was an idea that I posted and then thought 'wait, that's actually a good idea'. It started off as 'Instant Succubus, Just Add Virgin Blood!'. Then it was 'I Can't Believe it's not Demon!', then it was 'Instant Demon, Just Add Blood!'. Fun fact: When I posted it for the first time, I accidentally got ninja'd as I was posting the page, leading to some guy accidentally posting my page with a few revisions he made, and a bunch of SCP-Xs. This actually led to me getting a little more feedback before posting, cool-ly enough. Shoutout to Shaggydredlocks.

A different take on what I feel has become a cliche plot device. Eldritch abominations, we so often depict them as looking at us how we look at insects. But we forget that some humans have ant farms! The eldritch abomination who is the story behind this skip sees us as a struggling ant colony who needs its help, so he decides to give us a gift, not knowing how disgusting we would find it. Aside from that, I wanted to sort of prove to myself that people can still write anomalies that have moderately silly or downright goofy effects without being GAW-related.

[[collapsible hideLocation="both" show="+ Show commentary" hide="- Hide commentary"]]
For a while after writing Cornucopi-ass, I fell into a sort of creative rut. Which may or may not have had something to do with the fact that I got a Nintendo Switch and the new Zelda game. However, I still wanted to write for the site, so I decided to pull myself up by the bootstraps and get back into it. I don't feel that I had the same 'lightning-in-a-bottle' feeling that I had while writing some of my other pieces, but I am still really happy with how this turned out. 

Easter Eggs: All of the Doctors (sans Reynard) are named after classic horror movie directors. John Carpenter from The Thing, R(ussel) Doughton from the Blob, and Kurt Nuemann from The Fly.

While the idea of a dude turning into a crow, to us at least, may be mundane for this website, you have to wonder how the actual medical doctors in universe deal with even the most mundane of anomalies. That's why I set out to write this, showing a relatively boring skip from the perspective of someone inside the veil, as Roget put it. I think I may do more like this, maybe in the form of another sort of document? Maybe one focusing on the psychology of an anomalous human? 

Also, in case you didn't understand the meaning behind the title, 'Eating Crow' is an idiom used when you're humbled by being proven wrong. In this case, it's the doctors who are having a nice slice of humble pie, with a side of crow wings.

Some of them were even lodged into the bodies. It was like something just came at them before they could react. Every second I was there, my brain was screaming at me to get out… That's probably why they wrapped up the investigation so quickly. Whatever it was that got Daniels… that's what did this. I just… feel it."//

Another entry in my 'tales from the SCP archives that never achieved skip status' series. Hmm... That name doesn't really have that much of a ring to it. Extranormal Events are usually short, sweet, and to the point. However, you have to wonder what the story behind them is. Imagine how the Foundation must view them, as uncontained loose threads that could come back at any time. Well, perhaps I didn't focus so much on that as subverting the expectations of an EE, but it's food for thought if anyone else wants to experiment with them in the same way that I did here. 

When writing this, I was inspired the most by the (probably fictional) tale of a soldier who was deployed in Afghanistan, and allegedly encountered a monster that stalked his team, before completely destroying a whole village. In addition to the numerous wartime sightings of monsters, see the U28 sea monster for instance.

Easter Eggs: Lieutenant Dan Chambers was named for Lieutenant Dan Taylor from Forrest Gump. The number 28 appearing in the title is a reference to the U-28 Sea Monster, another alleged wartime sighting of a monster, which was described in the journal of the captain of the ship that saw it, just like how a Journal is one of the first things presented here.

With this, I just really felt inspired, and started writing. I'd been playing an immersive video game lately, and it made me want to replicate that feeling of looking through a character to learn more about a world that's completely different from our own. I also really wanted to replicate the strange, unknowable, surreal feeling that makes stuff like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yume_Nikki Yume Nikki] or [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpTn-eH4omM This Is My House] so enjoyable to me. The character of the story in particular was so fun to write, as it's not entirely right in the head, being completely isolated and alone for all of its existence. Well. Sort of. Hmhmhm. Purple as a plum, but I really like how it turned out.

[[tab Reynard's Writing Advice]]

To me, the most important thing before you start writing is to know the story you're trying to tell. You can write about the most interesting concept in the world, but unless you have a story behind it, you're basically making a monster of the week entry, that leaves no lasting impression. To me at least.

Ask yourself questions. Why does X do this? What would happen if it wasn't contained? Why do the people who made it do what they do? Is it a smaller part of something much larger? Maybe you'll answer all of these questions, maybe you won't, but I find that the very act of asking them really helps you as a writer think in-depth about how you want your SCP/whatevs to fit into the universe, and will give you all sorts of ideas on how to make it the best it can be.
