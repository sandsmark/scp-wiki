**Item #:** SCP-465
**Object Class:** Safe
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-465 is secured in containment locker 8423 at Site-19. Under no circumstances is SCP-465 to be opened by any personnel ranking above class D, and then only in a space at least 15 square meters in area. No other special attention or care is required. Dr. Graeh is to be notified immediately in the event that SCP-465 emits music or any other sound indicating possible activity from the object. 

**Description:** SCP-465-01 is a large two-piece cardboard box decorated with a faded confetti pattern popular in the 1970s. Other than a large printed label on the top of the lid marked "Party in a Box", no indication of contents or manufacturer are found on any portion of the object. When any human subject completely removes the lid of SCP-465-01, an array of decorations, furniture, and a group of at least 20 people (collectively SCP-465-02) appear spontaneously in the room or immediate vicinity in which the box was opened. These individuals proceed to celebrate raucously and actively attempt to include the subject in their festivities (primarily dancing and consumption of alcohol). Though most members of SCP-465-02 are persistent in these attempts, and several of them extremely persuasive, the subject does not appear to be compelled to participate. Should the subject attempt to leave the party, additional members of SCP-465-02 will manifest at any location that the subject visits for the duration of the "party".

Approximately 5 hours following the appearance of SCP-465-02, all instances of SCP-465-02 will simultaneously vanish, accompanied by the subject if he or she has consumed any amount of alcohol in the course of the party. At the same time, the lid of SCP-465-01 will reappear atop the box in the closed position, and any damage sustained by SCP-465-01 in the course of the party is reversed. Attempts to close or damage the box prior to the end of the time limit have had no effects on this phenomenon, nor have attempts to distance the subject from SCP-465-01 prior to the conclusion of the "party". Subjects that have vanished as a result of interaction with the box may appear among the members of SCP-465-02 during subsequent activations of SCP-465-01. 

Of the individuals comprising SCP-465-02, only two have appeared on every occasion that the box has been opened. The first (designated 02-A001) is a male disk jockey, and appears with a table covered in sound equipment and other tools[[footnote]]For a complete list of these and all other objects that have manifested as part of SCP-465-02, see document 465-02B.[[/footnote]], which he uses to play a wide variety of music audible wherever instances of SCP-465-02 are present. The second (designated 02-A002) is a male bartender, and appears with a small, well stocked bar from which he distributes a variety of alcoholic beverages. An additional ███ unique members of SCP-465-02 have been identified, many of which have appeared on two or more separate occasions (most notably 02-A048 and 02-A162). 

If a "party guest" appearing as part of SCP-465-02 is touched by any individual other than the subject that opened SCP-465-01, that "guest" will immediately become hysterical and incoherent, pleading in slurred speech and [REDACTED] with the individual that made contact. The majority of these will attempt to flee from the vicinity, and will vanish upon entering an area where no other elements of SCP-465-02 are present. The remainder of "guests" affected in this way will fall dead within several minutes of contact. The corpses of these individuals do not vanish with the rest of SCP-465-02, nor do such individuals appear in future manifestations of SCP-465-02. Autopsies reveal cause of death to be a combination of exhaustion and blood alcohol levels in excess of 1.8%. 

In contrast 02-A001 and 02-A002 have each been approached by researchers on two separate occasions without showing the expected adverse reaction. Both 02-A001 and 02-A002 refrained from interaction with researchers, merely staring at them until other members of SCP-465-02 forcibly removed all individuals other than the primary subject from the affected area. On both occasions, the "party" ended once all such individuals have been evicted. Roughly 20 hours following the completion of a "party" in which this takes place, SCP-465-01 will begin to emit music and other sounds consistent with SCP-465-02, followed 30 minutes later by the manifestation of SCP-465-02 across an area of roughly 25 square kilometers. The "party" proceeds as normal, with two exceptions. First, any individuals within the affected area are treated as though they had all opened SCP-465-01 concurrently and are subject to the phenomena normally observed in the course of the "party". Second, roughly 80% of the members of SCP-465-02 that appear are equipped with bottles of highly pressurized champagne, which are typically uncorked in close proximity to the faces of individuals that have not yet consumed alcohol during the "party", leading to significant losses in personnel at the completion of the "party". In spite of this behavior SCP-465 is classified Safe, as these properties do not manifest so long as neither 02-A001 nor 02-A002 are provoked.
