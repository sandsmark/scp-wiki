**Designation:** SCP-810

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-810 is to be kept in a transparent container and should be kept under video surveillance at all times. During experimentation, it is only to be handled by Class-D personnel or while wearing gloves. After experiment is concluded, any Class-D personnel who may 'own' the SCP are to be terminated.

**Description:** Object appears to be a standard oil lamp dating back some 1-2 thousand years. No biological material has been observed on the SCP, and the circumstances of its recovery make exact dating impractical. When touched by a human, an inscription appears in Aramaic. It reads, roughly 'Ask what you will, and you shall never want for it.' If the SCP is firmly grasped by a human for at least thirty seconds, the inscription will change to the holder's native language. If vigorously rubbed by the holder, a cloud of smoke will issue forth and take the form (although not the substance) of a humanoid wearing clothes common to the aristocracy of 5th century India (hereafter designated SCP-810-1). It will then repeat the inscription in whatever language the inscription is currently written in. SCP-810-1's voice is described as being firm and rich, and although it is clearly audible to those within 30 meters, those beyond this range will be completely unable to hear it, and any attempt to record SCP-810-1 speaking has met with failure. This has led to speculation that the voice is in fact a telepathic message.

If the holder of the object expresses any desire whatever verbally, the SCP will shake briefly and SCP-810-1, if present, will laugh and vanish. The holder will thereafter have no wish for whatever they mentioned. This would appear to include overwriting basic instinctual needs (see experiment log SCP-810-█). Once a person has been granted a 'wish' by the SCP, it has no effect on them for at least 4 years.

If a person touches SCP-810 and does not express a desire while touching it, the SCP will 'attune' to that person. The SCP will, when unobserved, disappear and reappear in the possession of whoever it has attuned to (hereafter referred to as the 'owner'). Although it will always appear amongst personal possessions of the owner, the SCP will never appear under direct observation. If all possessions of the owner are being monitored, the SCP will disappear and not reappear until either the owner dies or some personal possessions of the owner are unobserved. In the former case, the SCP will materialize in whatever unmonitored location is closest to its original vanishing point. Each time the owner observes the SCP, they will momentarily stiffen. Observation shows that the owner will, over time, become more and more accustomed to the SCP regardless of whether or not they have seen it, and eventually will begin carrying it with them (usually after 4-5 months of 'owning' the item). Once they begin carrying the item, the owner will usually forget its presence and express a desire while holding it. At this point, they cease 'owning' the SCP, and will usually forget about it completely. If SCP-810 is 'attuned' to multiple people, then whoever is currently closest to the SCP is considered the 'owner'.

**Addendum SCP-810-01:** This SCP was recovered in a small Indian village, after reports of the village being terrorized by a 'haunted lamp'. During its retrieval, Agent █████ was affected by the SCP, having expressed a desire for sleep while holding it. Further, Agent ██████ became the 'owner' of the item, leading to confusion for approximately a month before the unexpected death of Agent ██████ in Incident ████████ permitted further testing.

**Addendum SCP-810-02:** Interviews with class-D personnel involved in experiments with SCP-810 have shown that the person involved will frequently be surprised by the change in their own psyche. Standard psychiatric techniques have proven ineffective at reversing the effects of SCP-810, and administration of class-A amnesiacs have not readjusted subjects' psyches, although subjects have expressed confusion at their adjustment.
