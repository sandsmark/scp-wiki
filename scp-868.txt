**Item #:** SCP-868
 
**Object Class:** Euclid
 
**Special Containment Procedures:** One D-Class Personnel infected with SCP-868 is to be maintained in a soundproofed standard humanoid containment cell at Site ██ supervised by at least one armed guard.  Personnel wishing to experiment with SCP-868 must submit to a psychological exam and background check to confirm their loyalty to the Foundation and its goals.
     
All persons suspected of being a host of SCP-868 (including all inhabitants of a community in which a host has been located, if feasible) are to be quarantined individually pending evaluation.  Any subject found to be a victim of SCP-868 must be treated with AMN-868.  Should a population treated with AMN-868 exhibit a noticeable amount of unusual behavior, a follow-up amnesiac (Class-B or Class-C, depending on mitigating factors) should be distributed.
     
Any reports of SCP-868 infection in the general population are to be considered a breach of secrecy and treated as such.  Personnel spreading SCP-868 intentionally or attempting to access the current carrier of SCP-868 without express written permission are to be court-martialed if applicable and reassigned otherwise.  
     
**Description:** SCP-868 is a meme that is believed to be the result of an experimental memory improvement therapy designed by Prometheus Labs, Inc.  Surviving documents indicate that the therapy involved showing the subject ██ specially-designed images in sequence. Other notes indicate that the researchers responsible for creating SCP-868 were unaware of its memetic properties until shortly before the facility was destroyed.  The images and documentation necessary for administering this treatment have not been located.
     
SCP-868 is transferred by extended conversation with an infected subject (no less than 30 minutes), with symptoms manifesting between four and nine days after infection.  Stage One symptoms vary but are usually benign and typically include a significantly improved short-term memory, with subjects typically being able to clearly remember events, instructions, numbers, etc. for roughly twice as long as they would otherwise.  Subjects also report the ability to recall memories of events that happened after initial infection with greater accuracy than they would otherwise.  This has been confirmed by testing.  The effects of SCP-868 become more pronounced the longer the subject is host to the meme.
     
Stage Two effects of SCP-868 become apparent roughly five weeks after infection.  By this point, subjects are frequently able to remember with near-perfect accuracy any event or information received after contracting SCP-868 and from several days before.  However, over the course of between one and five hours (depending on the subject’s age), this effect extends to encompass the subject’s entire lifespan, with the exception of the first twenty months of life.  Victims are usually pleased with the end result.
     
SCP-868 poses a significant risk to Foundation interests due to its interaction with subjects that have been treated with an amnesiac.  Testing has shown that hosting SCP-868 for any amount of time is sufficient to prevent amnesiacs from affecting its memories.  In addition, during the second stage of the infection, SCP-868 completely negates the effects of any amnesiac administered at any point in the subject’s life, potentially allowing the subject to remember sensitive or dangerous information.  --This has held true for all tested amnesiacs, both natural and man-made-- (See **Addendum 868-2**).  
     
Prior to its full containment, SCP-868 caused █ breaches of security, necessitating the termination of ███ individuals (including █ staff) to prevent the spread of sensitive information regarding the Foundation, SCP objects, and other classified data.  Subsequent cleanup and cover-ups have cost an additional $[REDACTED].  Containment breaches after its containment have required an additional ██ casualties to contain.  
     
**Addendum 868-1:** On ██/██/19██, Dr. ██████ received access to SCP-868 after filing the relevant paperwork. [[footnote]]At this point in time, the containment procedures for SCP-868 were minimal. [[/footnote]]  Approximately six weeks later, reports from ███████, Bangladesh indicated that residents had become aware of the existence of SCP-███, which had been recovered from that location █ years previously.  Because AMN-868 had not been created at this point, it was necessary to neutralize the village under the pretense of a flood.  Under interrogation, Dr. ██████ admitted to releasing SCP-868.  After two similar incidents with other personnel, the containment procedures for SCP-868 have been updated.
 
**Addendum 868-2:** In November 20██, Foundation researchers developed a Class-B amnesiac, AMN-868, that was capable of reversing the effects of SCP-868 and eradicating the infection.  AMN-868 has a success rate of 70%; in these cases, side effects are limited to severe headaches and an increased risk of Alzheimer's Disease.  In the remaining 30%, AMN-868 will perform its functions, but will also cause self-destructive tendencies and prolonged antisocial behavior.  See [REDACTED] for details.
