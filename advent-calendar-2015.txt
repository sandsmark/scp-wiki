It was almost a year ago that I did [[[randomini-does-the-mouth-word-things|The Mouth Word Things For Benefit Of The Eyeless, Illiterate And Terminally Bored]]]. This was because I did a reading for my Secret Santa partner, and then realised that it was fun to read things, because my mouth is good, and my words are great, and I like to talk. So I did readings for a bunch of other people. And then I posted them all.

**SO.**

This year I'm not bothering with Secret Santa. Instead, every day this month until Christmas, I'll do a reading of a tale [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-1459443/randomini-readathon-advent-calendar-for-decemberween as nominated in this thread]. What will happen on Christmas??? It is a mystery.

+ Come back every day until Christmas for new readings!
