**Item#:** SCP-349

**Object Class:**  Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-349 is completely harmless,  and the only concerns are that it is stored in a manner that preserves its integrity due to its age.  SCP-349-02 however, is still in the process of having a method  designed for it, as it has only recently been discovered, as of now is it protected by light patrols and constant monitoring.  Eventually, the optimal plan is to build a containment site around it, with no special defensive capacities, slightly larger then  its original size, to accommodate its almost unnoticeable theorized growth.

**Description:**  SCP-349-01 is a large tombstone, approximately four hundred years old years old(discovered by various dating techniques), that bears the name Nicolos Flamel, and then the dates 1376-1606, which if true, is decidedly contrary to the accepted notions of human longevity and on the flip side, the myth that after discovering the philosophers stone, the alchemist lived forever.  Underneath the dates, there lies the legend //"you have failed"// in giant capitalized letters.  It is made out of granite, is missing a chip on the right side, the words are slightly faded, and there is a large crack heading diagonally until its meets the middle. 

SCP-349-02 was found after searching the area where the first marker was discovered, for more of its type.  After weeks of trailing, investigation, and interrogation, Nicholas Flamel's  alleged tombstone was revealed to have been stolen from a moderate size graveyard in the center of a overgrown forest near Bath, England.  This cemetery is SCP-349-02 and inside it are small memorials for many, if not all the individuals who have supposedly achieved immortality as related in history and legend.  The epigraphs are short, brief, and vicious, a a parody of normal ones in their blunt harshness, and all seem to be written by the same person or entity, a thing that appearer to be malevolent,  hateful of human existence, and wants to emphasize, through many statements such as //"in the end, i have found you"// and //"it was futile to fight"// that none can can escape death.

The team ventures to guess that this is its way of gloating.

It is to be noted that the individuals mentioned in the specified aches are all examples of those who have dared to seize immortality, accomplished it through some freak accident, or acquired it as a curse, punishment, or reward through magical, scientific, or spiritual means, not those who were born with it, as a special characteristic of their species or race, or a innate cosmic trait.  Those not meant to posses eternal life.  Among the names found are the Count of St. Germain,  Tithonus and Sir Galahad, the finder of the holy grail.  Also included are personages who are not well noted, obscure, hidden, or only known to be unageing to certain esoteric orders, and whose existence is a secret to popular culture or more common texts.  While this certainly adds some creditability, we were only positive that this wasn't a hoax by any one normal human or organization without extreme influence, when certain pieces of information were mentioned that should only be in the possession of the foundation, due to their extreme level of classification.  Included amongst those referenced that show that security was breached or whatever is behind SCP-349-02 has a level of omniscient were 20 out of the 27 individuals on our organization's list of  humans who have achieved immortality physically and walk the earth that we know of and have registered, (many of them SCP themselves, or under close surveillance) who we had fallen out of  touch with over the last  fifty years, due to their strange disappearances or bizarre deaths (the other seven are also on the run from something, but we at least have contact with them occasionally or their names were not marked down somewhere in SCP-349-02) and also the identities of all [DATA EXPUNGED] and after the serum apparently worked, were fine until [DATA EXPUNGED] going into hiding did not alleviate the feelings that they were being watched and hunted by some unseen force [DATA EXPUNGED]  copses were never found.  Also referenced were famous figures, who apparently died not when documented, but continued on for some amount of time, such as Christopher Columbus, and Sir Francis bacon.  Finally, the last type are those who have  no supernatural or magical documents associated with them, and who we have no important records of(if any, they only show that they were a citizen of a certain country, a drifter, a recluse eccentric, or extraordinarily rich, which under examination a trend can be  found that amongst the most materially successful ones there is the pattern of having a heir of the same gender, named the same, who, and this is going strictly by eyewitness accounts and heresy, eerily resembles the long line of similar ancestors before them)  This division's particular failure to achieve anything notable is frequently remarked upon cruelly with a series of one liners such as //"Your great work will never be finished"//  or //"no one will even remember your name"//  Regardless of who they were,however,few continued longer then hundred years after the normal span, the rough average a oddly short thirty years.  The longest  date surveyed so far was, through careful study and comparison to certain ancient biblical gospels, revealed to be of "The Wandering Jew" who survived for 750 years, which could be a testament to the power of the man who cursed him. 

Tombstone materials and design(weather it be rock, obsidian, or wood,) body preparation and burial style (coffins have been unearthed, as well as nothing by simple dirt hole or on the other end of the spectrum elaborate mummifications ) religious symbology (any number of spiritual and personal adornments were discovered, some pertaining to cults we had never heard of) and languages in which mockeries were written in all correspond to the era and period in which the person was born.  The oldest site is a beautiful carved and ingeniously fit together (with a series a grooved notches) pile of elephant bones, covered in incomprehensible runes and tribal marking,  The earliest one we can decipher is a simple rock in Sumerian that is sarcastically dedicated to "Og the Heart Eater"- //"you have sold your clan into slavery and devoured the flesh of your family and for what?"//  Although there was much variety, one thing was found to be the same 90 percent of the time, every single plot under close inspection shows scratch marks on the material that was blocking escape, or signs of attempted tunneling to the surface.   Nevertheless, there are no missing cadavers, and every single plot opened up so far has at least some type of copse or set of bones accorded it it,  although some are nearly in a state of dust to to extreme age.  In two unique instances, however,  entirely preserved bodies have been found, although this seems to be a gift that they received in life along with becoming unaging, rather then a condition gained in death.  These two bodies are the remnants of Calothisosi of Britannica ( a mythological figure who could apparently withstand volleys of arrows and direct strikes with swords) and the decommissioned SCP-149, a high powered keter class human who had attained both invulnerability and immortality, after experimenting with certain springs and fountains located in ████████████ and who after a blackout at his containment area on his 117 birthday and the failure of a five month search, was declared missing.  In both cases, (since their flesh was still whole and in perfect condition) they were found with extreme terror on their faces, and mouths twisted in silent and eternal screams.

**Addendum 349-02-01:**  Deep within the necropolis researchers found a crypt that, (all the copses in one spot, almost as it was a collection of particular favored trophies) if its contents were exposed, would shatter most of the main religions, and completely discredit several older pagan ones.
