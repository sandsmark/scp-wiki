title:The Big List Of Overdone SCP Cliches
We don't need no more:

1. Things What Let You Fight Good, Guyz What fight good, heck, anything involved with Fightan Good.

2. Reality Bending pplz what can make the world change with their mindz.

3. Things what we should do what they say becuz we wouldn't like them when they're angry.

4. Things what make other weird things. This includes things what make SCPs and Things what you put other things in and they come out improved.

5. Things what you saw on TV/ in a movie/ in an anime/ read about in a book.

6. Things what make you go nuts for no apparent reason.

7. Things what use up excessive resources, like nucular weaponz or Class-D personnel. 
     * Blind Guards are excessive resources, by the way.

8. Things what excessively refer to other SCPs. This includes things what are better than other SCPs.

9. Things what are really pretty pplz whom everyone lieks.

10. Things are are just fucking lame.

11. Things which perform OTT as to what they're supposed to do. //i.e. Knives that cut through dimensions, audio devices that cause insanity to whoever listens to them etc, etc.//

12. Things which are ancient and evil, so vast that humankind cannot comprehend it.

13. Anything spherical. Or cubical. Seriously, for fuck sake, pick a random object rather than a shape.

14. Things which lead to some vast dimension of pointlessness where we lose countless amounts of D-Class by sending them in for no particular reason.

15. Statues that move when you don't look at them. Just because the original, and one of the best has done it doesn't mean you should.

16. Things FROM THE FUTURE! We've got a whole city from there.

17. Random Information Giver.

18. Indestructible for the sake of indestructible. We generally don't randomly destroy things, so there's no reason to do it just to keep it from being destroyed.

If you be making one of these things as an SCP, bear in mind you will be adding to a already well-stocked collection, will come under harsher scrutiny, and need to do exceedingly well to make a impression.

//Dr. Gears Footnote://  With these things being stated, let us also state that this is not a list of "NO MORE OF THESE EVER", but a list of things that we have too much of.  You can //try// to make a Thing What Let You Fight Good, but bear in mind it's going to have to be VERY good to both stand out from the pack, and avoid deletion.  If you attempt to make something that fits into one of these slots, be prepared for a rapid downward spiral and deletion.

If, on the other hand, you're able to re-forge one of these cliches into something truly original and solid, congratulations.  However this situation is very much the exception, not the rule.  In most cases, originality is best if you hope to create a outstanding entry.
