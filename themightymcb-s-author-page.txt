+ Who is the McB Behind All of that Mightyness?

I'm just a 21 year old college biology student who has no idea what he wants to do with his life. Said life involves:
* Petting cats despite being allergic to them
* Playing guitar very loudly
* Singing in the car very poorly
* Death metal screaming in the car quite well
* Going to all kinds of heavy metal concerts
* Catching guitar picks at said heavy metal concerts (seriously, ask me, I have a good collection going)
* Drinking good whiskey and smoking mild cigars
* Going to university full time
* Working full time as a security lieutenant in a corporate building
* Critting here on the wiki or in the IRC chat
* Actually writing for SCP in my 5 minutes of free time after all of the above has been done to my heart's content

+ Now, Let's McTalk About 'Em

++ SCP Articles
[[collapsible show="► SCP-4059: The Jersey Devil" hide="▼ SCP-4059: The Jersey Devil"]]
My first article, it has a soft spot in my heart, even though it's not my best work. I didn't even plan on writing for the site when I joined at the start of the SCP-4000 Contest, but after reading and critting a ton, I decided to try my hand at it. Honestly, it could have been far, far worse, and I'm rather happy how it turned out in the end. 

Fun fact: Writing this article led to me having to figure out that if a pregnancy was conceived on the first day of a full moon, you'd need to give birth exactly 265 days later in order for the baby to also be born on the first day of a full moon, nine months later.

[[collapsible show="► SCP-3741: The World Is Your Oyster" hide="▼ SCP-3741: The World Is Your Oyster"]]
My second article, this one is my personal favorite at the moment. The idea started as a simple "be careful what you wish for" type idea until a reviewer pointed out that the anomaly could be used to control information. Thus gave birth to these Thaumiel-class oysters. This one came out pretty naturally, as well, and I wrote the bulk of it over just about two days.

Fun fact: This article was added to the War On All Fronts canon when Stormbreath read it more than two weeks after posting, all thanks to my crosslink with an ICSUT GoI format, which I picked in a sheer panic while PMing my fellow critters looking for a good article to use. Thanks again, Stallmantic!

++ Tales
[[collapsible show="► Another Soul Joins The Halkost" hide="▼ Another Soul Joins The Halkost"]]
This article was written for the 2019 Collaboration Contest with my fellow butterfly and friend, [[*user N_Aepic_Fael]]. Being my first ever foray into writing prose, I was absolutely terrified to post this, but thanks to my partner and our critters, it's up on the site and doing pretty well. 

Fun Fact: I wrote my portion of the tale while working a 16 hour overnight shift at work, in Notepad because I didn't have WiFi on my laptop, the day before the posting period ended for the contest. It was critted and posted that same day.

[[collapsible show="► PACKAGE DXV-180294-217" hide="▼ PACKAGE DXV-180294-217"]]
This was the result of a failed collaboration with [[*user CrankyMonkey2]]. We originally had an SCP draft that stagnated during the critique process, but a few months later, they hit me up to try again on a new idea. From inception to posting, this took just 3 days to make, and I'm quite proud of it.

Fun Fact: The concept itself was originally just a grimdark story about factory workers being used to produce steel, until critters pointed out that 217 doesn't work nearly fast enough to rival the 2 billion tons on steel made every year. So instead, this ended up in End of Death, with immortal people stuck as cogs in a literal machine.

++ GoI Formats
[[collapsible show="► Kacist Halyna Ieva" hide="▼ Karcist Halyna Ieva"]]
This article was also written for the 2019 Collaboration Contest with my fellow butterfly and friend, [[*user N_Aepic_Fael]]. The tone of Serpent's Hand writing was very difficult for me to nail, as I'm more of a science guy. The purple prose felt so cheesy to me that I really did have to force it out at times. Writing footnotes was fun though, and ultimately, so was the overall experience.

Fun Fact: The image for the article and its associated caption were all picked literally hours before posting by Naepic. The connection to Scylla was completely contrived and never was once thought of, yet it fit //perfectly//, being an enemy of the Greeks and having powerful tentacles instead of legs. Naepic pulled that out of his ass and it was goddamn fantastic.
