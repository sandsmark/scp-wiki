----
++ SCP Articles
[[collapsible show="► SCP-4059: The Jersey Devil" hide="▼ SCP-4059: The Jersey Devil"]]
My first article, it has a soft spot in my heart, even though it's not my best work. I didn't even plan on writing for the site when I joined at the start of the SCP-4000 Contest, but after reading and critting a ton, I decided to try my hand at it. Honestly, it could have been far, far worse, and I'm rather happy how it turned out in the end. 

Fun fact: Writing this article led to me having to figure out that if a pregnancy was conceived on the first day of a full moon, you'd need to give birth exactly 265 days later in order for the baby to also be born on the first day of a full moon, nine months later.
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="► SCP-3741: The World Is Your Oyster" hide="▼ SCP-3741: The World Is Your Oyster"]]
My second article, the idea for this started as a simple "be careful what you wish for" type object until a reviewer pointed out that the anomaly could be used to control information. Thus gave birth to these Thaumiel-class oysters. This one came out pretty naturally, as well, and I wrote the bulk of it over just about two days.

Fun fact: This article was added to the War On All Fronts canon when Stormbreath read it more than two weeks after posting, all thanks to my crosslink with an ICSUT GoI format, which I picked in a sheer panic while PMing my fellow critters looking for a good article to use. Thanks again, Stallmantic!
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="► SCP-3272: It's Rainin' Men, HALLELUJAH!" hide="▼ SCP-3272: It's Rainin' Men, HALLELUJAH!"]]
I swore I would never write a time travel article, and then one day, I had an idea about a //time// machine that isn't a //spacetime// machine, so it drops you off into the void of space. The idea grew from there and became what it is now. I'm very proud of this article, and it's probably my best work yet.

Fun Fact: This article uses a listpages module to swap between iterations, and I had to teach myself how they work at 3am because my brain wouldn't rest until this damn skip was done. Now, I've got a new skill and a cool article out of it!
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="► SCP-2410: We Are Beary Sorry" hide="▼ SCP-2410: We Are Beary Sorry"]]
This article has been in the making since before CollabCon, before I even had an author page. Originally, [[*user Crashington]], [[*user N_Aepic_Fael]], and myself had two articles under our belt and were gonna race to make author pages, but then Xilas suggested that we all just collaborate on a piece instead, and so we got together and starting working on an article based on a simple concept I had kicking around: teddy bears with real innards. Cue 4ish months of us all being busy as hell and not knowing how to finish off the article, until one day, we just decided fuck it, the thing needed finishing.

Fun Fact: N_Aepic_Fael and I discussed this article, as well as the general writing process that led to its production, on the Site-42 Podcast with [[*user TheeSherm]].
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="► SCP-4596: A Farm Upstate" hide="▼ SCP-4596: A Farm Upstate"]]
This article was written for Bright's Challenge, meaning I came up with the idea, opened a new SCP slot edit box, wrote the thing, and then posted it all within 24 hours, without getting crit from anybody, and without writing anywhere other than the edit box of the page. Start to finish, it took me maybe 5 hours. Considering a spent a good bit of it dicking around and I took a break to eat dinner too, I think that's pretty damn good. Anyways, lots of kids are told that their old pets went to live on a farm upstate. What if they actually were?

Fun Fact: this idea started as a throwaway line to explain something to a user in #thecritters, then I mused that it would make a cool SCP. The user didn't wanna use the idea themselves so I decided to write it as a brights challenge submission the same day. 
[[/collapsible]]

++ Tales
[[collapsible show="► Another Soul Joins The Halkost" hide="▼ Another Soul Joins The Halkost"]]
This article was written for the 2019 Collaboration Contest with my fellow butterfly and friend, [[*user N_Aepic_Fael]]. Being my first ever foray into writing prose, I was absolutely terrified to post this, but thanks to my partner and our critters, it's up on the site and doing pretty well. 

Fun Fact: I wrote my portion of the tale while working a 16 hour overnight shift at work, in Notepad because I didn't have WiFi on my laptop, the day the posting period ended for the contest. It was critted and posted that same day. 
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="► PACKAGE DXV-180294-217" hide="▼ PACKAGE DXV-180294-217"]]
This was the result of a failed collaboration with [[*user CrankyMonkey2]]. We originally had an SCP draft that stagnated during the critique process, but a few months later, they hit me up to try again on a new idea. From inception to posting, this took just 3 days to make, and I'm quite proud of it.

Fun Fact: The concept itself was originally just a grimdark story about factory workers being used to produce steel, until critters pointed out that 217 doesn't work nearly fast enough to rival the 2 billion tons of steel made every year. So instead, this ended up in End of Death, with immortal people stuck as cogs in a literal machine.
[[/collapsible]]


++ GoI Formats
[[collapsible show="► Kacist Halyna Ieva, or The Mother Who Demands One's Toes" hide="▼ Karcist Halyna Ieva, or The Mother Who Demands One's Toes"]]
This article was also written for the 2019 Collaboration Contest with my fellow butterfly and friend, [[*user N_Aepic_Fael]]. The tone of Serpent's Hand writing was very difficult for me to nail, as I'm more of a science guy. The purple prose felt so cheesy to me that I really did have to force it out at times. Writing footnotes was fun though, and ultimately, so was the overall experience.

Fun Fact: The image for the article and its associated caption were all picked literally hours before posting by Naepic. The connection to Scylla was completely contrived and never was once thought of, yet it fit //perfectly//, being an enemy of the Greeks and having powerful tentacles instead of legs. Naepic pulled that out of his ass and it was goddamn fantastic.
