**Recipe Number:** SCP-5250

**Ease of Preparation:** --Keter-- Safe

[[include component:image-block name=lake.jpg|caption= You think of this photo as such a nice place to chow down on a big bowl of SCP-5250. Even the deer's left some tracks, so you can tell where you shouldn't be going or looking.]]


**Special Cooking Procedures:** Growing up in rural Michigan, nothing blocked out the cold like a big bowl of your Mama's special SCP-5250. Now, you know some people would say there are a thousand and one ways to make SCP-5250, but they'd be worse off than the deer trapped beneath the ice. You sigh, as you've forgotten how to cook it. It's been so long. Thankfully, you've got the recipe right here! How convenient.

* One lake in rural Michigan.

* One five-meter tall security fence.

* Two armed guards.[[footnote]]For freshness, make sure to switch these out frequently.[[/footnote]]

* A dash of sound dampening equipment.

How //did// you forget? It's a pretty simple recipe all in all. Now, you recall, there's just a couple of things to avoid when making this.

* You are never, ever to step on the ice. No matter what that silly deer is doing, don't try and help him. He'll be fine.

* If you're not sharing a recipe, don't share anything! That crazy old deer will hear you.

* No writing, unless it's a recipe. If he can't read the document, you know he can't get out.

* Only use the second person. No first-person, no passive voice, no third person.

**Description:** To cook a splendid dish like SCP-5250, you first take the lake by the cabin as a base. Add in an unceasing appetite, the lake's edges opening up like the gaping jaws of a deepsea fish. Crack open two sheets of ice, by accidentally tossing a spoon onto it. Remember not to stare deep, deep down into its depths, because what is in there is //not// human, no matter how much it may cry. You are not to fall down into its hole. You are not to look down there. You are not to feed it with what tapestry of yourself you have weaved in your mind.

Apply three pints of a taste that appears similar to what you used to feel when you swallowed five chili peppers whole. The fire within almost calls, reaches out to you. The heat and warmth make you feel more comfortable. You will need heavy amounts of seasoning with its umami flavor -- it's not as if //it// can understand taste, eating, or anything of remotely related to it. It is safe, whatever it is -- it is most certainly not a lake, you frown. Being one would've been... beneficial, you think, as the water would help with the sheer amount of spice you add in, which even the most resilient chef would scoff at.


[[include component:image-block name=deer.jpg|caption= What a silly deer, you laugh. | align= left]]


What it did with who it took is still unknown to you. But the dish is still missing something, you think. It'd be hard for you to think of exactly what, seeing as you're quite... poor in the culinary department.

Add in the deer for a bit of a zesty kick. Taste it, just to ensure you've added enough salt. The taste is a familiar one. It reminds you of the woods behind your house. Where you used to go and creep amongst the bushes and trees, and pretend that you were a hunter on the prowl. It is strange being on the other side of that now, to be the one breathing silently, eyes in the back of your head. Silly deer, you think, so concerned about the exact location of whoever talks about it. Toss SCP-5250 with two salad forks, then mix with a ladle, to disorient the deer. 

Pouring in the liquid now into the large bowl, you laugh, as its lame leg trails behind it like a shriveled corpse -- it's not as if it could follow you. Or at least, it couldn't yesterday, you think. Today it is fine. But it will not be the day after. Then the cycle repeats. Or are you just too stupid to actually recognize it solely being injured or not? But you ignore the deer -- the mere thought of it or talking about it in any way but this is purely hazardous, because it will find you. Then, like a tempest whipped up in a frothy sea, it will not let go of you as you cycle down its gyre. Whisk, gently at first, then quickly, to prevent the liquid and these thoughts from settling. See if the liquid within the bowl will connect in a paper-thin strand, like melted cheese. If not, then continue to whisk, as the lake and deer are definitely connected. But -- why can't you simply do it on your first time?

Wash your hands, then continue. Preheat your oven, and take out your colander. Ignore the lake's calls, and let them drain through the colander's holes. Ignore the fact that anything that falls down into its depths is immediately taken to some place beyond. Ignore it all. The bubbling stream is all you should focus on, with its soft, gentle calls, repelling that of the siren's song.

SCP-5250 wasn't thought of by you, not like you //could.// You're always of the mind that your grandma made it, as a secret family recipe, even if you don't have one. Nor are you always the same you. However, you find SCP-5250 pairs well with the same cabin from the lake you always think of, and cheese. The charcuterie board is made of the same wood that the cabin, built in 1999 was. It was owned by two men, a Mr. Josephus Dryadre, and a Mr. Neil Williams. Both of them are deceased, having died of natural causes in 2000. A shame, you tell yourself, as you remove the dish from the oven with an oven mitt. Plate the dish well, ensuring that all the elements are equally presented, in a way that is mysterious, familiar, and brand-new, all at once. It's a difficult task -- are you sure you're even ready for it?

After all of that, you're done cooking up a likely amazing stew of SCP-5250! The aromatic, delectable aura of the dish you've made reminds you somewhat of home. Of you, even. But ignore that as well -- the smell tickling your nostrils must not be given mind. You've done better than you thought you could.

You're aware that it took testing for the cabin, the deer, and this beautifully plated bowl of SCP-5250 to be reclassified as Safe after you discovered the appropriate way to talk about them, which took you too long to find, you incompetent wreck. Below, you've decided to attach some relevant documentation. You know, to add a little more //spice// to the recipe, and ensure that future cooks-in-training can serve up a dish just as decadent and spectacular as yours //should// be! One that the lake, and the deer, are both allergic to. They may as well be illiterate -- they hardly can understand what a good recipe is.

You have done some tests with SCP-5250, adjusting ingredients here and there, and seeing what would happen if you tasted what came out of it. Below, you can find the results, future chefs!


||~ Actions ||~ Helpful Ingredients ||~ Result ||
|| Stepping into the lake. || Snowshoes, to help pad out his weight. || You saw him slipping under the ice. Despite this, you could still see their heat signature for a little bit. ||
|| Getting a computer to write about the deer, then reading what there is. || Your trusty keyboard. || The deer didn't notice. How delightful. ||
|| Looking at the deer. || A pair of binoculars. || The deer wants you to keep on coming. ||
|| Attempting to kill the deer. || Some fiery gunpowder, and two .45 caliber bullets with earthy undertones. || A disappointing presentation, as the deer was completely fine. ||
|| Preparing a nice beef jambalaya. || A pinch of salt, some vision blocking goggles, thermal imaging systems, and infrared sensors. || The lake didn't quite like that. You weren't supposed to see what lies beneath. ||
|| Waiting. || A sprinkling of nothing. || The wind blows. The lake is hungry. ||

In the cabin, when you and the others first came, you found a journal with some entries written by Mr. Dryadre. In the cabin, there was not much else, except for a gun found near the door. You decide to attach the journals below, with approval from your Site Director. It is not as if there is much else you can do. You are stuck, in the snow that rages outside. The deer seemed interesting to him, him being one of the guards outside. Start your stove, set it to simmer.

I enjoy that what I can see right now is exactly what I have pictured in my mind. The fire is crackling, Neil is snoring his ass off, and I am writing this. We finish work on the cabin tomorrow. It's hard work, but Neil has been able to offer some minor reassurances.

He was talking to fur traders a ways back. Managed to procure us cured meats to last almost two months, so we shall not run low on supplies.

You revise your recipes, awaiting orders. The snow is picking up. There's nothing you really //can// do, but wait. Cooking is the only escape, really, but you're thankful the cabin's got quite the apparatus.

But you're a bit full, aren't you? Having eaten //so// much of that SCP-5250. It's really filling, and the sort of flavor you'd only get by accidentally biting down on your own tongue. It's a strange flavor, certainly, but nothing //too// strange. Perhaps a bit familiar, really.

You sit and think. Think about deer. Their webs of antlers. Their majestic look. They seem quite trustworthy, don't they? A buck, proud and noble ruler of the woods, would not hesitate to help you out. So why did you leave the one out on the ice? You quickly shake your head. The recipe told you so, Junior Researcher. You open your computer, staring at a smiling photo of yourself. You close it. Must conserve your battery. Garnish with bits and pieces of thought.

Neil has developed a taste for fish. He's been spending his time ice fishing in the small pond out back. He's spent an awful lot of time back there, after he said a bear had eaten our supplies. An unfortunate start to our new life, but that's quite ok.

I asked him to stay close to me in bed tonight. He agreed, though mentioned he'd been getting splinters. Granted, what we have isn't much of a //bed//, but I suppose it'd have to do. He talked about what he'd caught. It wasn't a //lot.// Just a boot. A really old one. I'm surprised others have been up here, but I guess the stream can bring anything.

You feel the deer. It comes closer. And you want to go closer to it. You can reason with the deer some. It's a lot like you, isn't it? Wounded, worried, and just trying to survive out there on the ice. You're quite surprised the thing's managed to //survive// this long. It's a big buck though, must be hardy.

You shot it. The ground rumbled and the deer flailed, and went under the ice. What an awful coincidence. You lost your food, and an earthquake. You sigh. Whatever the lake is, it's hungry.

You walked over to the lake today. The deer had returned. In the small hole, perfect for one to ice fish in, you look down. And you almost want to jump in. But you don't. You feel like it's //drawing you,// it's calling you, as if it's a part of you you've lost. How awful, awful it is you and the lake must be without each other, how awful it is you and the deer must be without each other. How great it would be to go walk over and join the deer. 

However, you are cold. It would be so warm, to kill the deer and steal its pelt. But it doesn't have a pelt. It's not //quite// itself, just like you aren't yourself. As if you were staring at it through a dirty mirror. As if you were being reflected within a dirty mirror. Stir in a pinch of self-doubt.

You recognize there are no more journal entries. Disappointing, because perhaps you'd know what the deer is. However, your thermal imagery has shown that the deer leads under the ice. Its hoof connects to a thin, thin strand, which leads to a large familiar mass waiting patiently underwater. It rings. It clips. It clops. It cries out to be heard, for it is hungry.

Your computer manages to eke out a single bar of connection from the car, which is running on its last legs. You can hear something stabbing it, running upon its hood, destroying it down to its last metal bits, before a loud splash can be heard. Then you lose your connection. But it was enough time to send the document through, at least. You can remember, at least, that part of you.

But, you are stuck. The snow is bearing down on your cabin. You write this for your future chefs.

There is a knock at the door. You have your gun ready, locked and loaded to fire. Maybe you are being rescued. But you're hungry, so so hungry, and you want to cook up another bowl of SCP-5250. A nice, creamy, warm and steaming bowl of SCP-5250 stew. The lake feels like that, like one big pot of it.

So maybe deep down, you hope it is the deer. Maybe it is you at the door. Maybe. You open it, and -- 

Voila. Your dish is finished.
