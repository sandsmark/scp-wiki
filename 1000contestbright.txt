**Item #:** SCP-1000

**Object Class:** --Safe-- --Decommissioned-- Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** --The section of road designated 1000-Alpha is to be monitored at all times. During active time periods a sweep is to be performed every hour, by a lone security agent in a non-foundation standard car, at all other times remote monitoring is allowed. When contact is made with SCP-1000, said agent is to stop his vehicle, and offer it a ride. Agent is to stick exclusively to the provided script, and not attempt to engage SCP-1000 in any further conversation. After arrival at site 1000-Beta, agent is to wait in the car 15 minutes after departure of SCP-1000 and  then to retrieve item 1000-Gamma, and return it to special agents M██ and D██ at Site 1000-Delta.--

--After the results of incident 1000-L██████, Dr. L██████ is to be the sole operative assigned  to active phase monitoring duty.--

--Given that three years have passed since any occurrence of SCP-1000, this SCP is now considered decommissioned.--

After the events of Incident 1000-L██████-2, SCP-1000 has been reinstated, and upgraded to euclid class. During the period of the full moon, the 'active' phase of SCP 1000, the system of roads known collectively as 1000-Alpha are to be constantly patrolled for signs of SCP-1000. In the event said SCP is spotted, a D-class is to be inserted into a remotely controlled vehicle, and guided to the spot of its appearance. Upon acquiring SCP-1000. the vehicle is to be driven to Site 1000-Delta, and the remains of the D-class disposed of. If SCP-1000 is not spotted, please report this anomaly to your immediate superior.
