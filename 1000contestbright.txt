**Item #:** SCP-1000

**Object Class:** --Safe-- --Decommissioned-- Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** --The section of road designated 1000-Alpha is to be monitored at all times. During active time periods a sweep is to be performed every hour, by a lone security agent in a non-Foundation standard car, at all other times remote monitoring is allowed. When contact is made with SCP-1000, said agent is to stop his vehicle, and offer it a ride. Agent is to adhere exclusively to the provided script, and not attempt to engage SCP-1000 in any further conversation. After arrival at site 1000-Beta, agent is to wait in the car 15 minutes after departure of SCP-1000 and then to retrieve item 1000-Gamma, and return it to the E-class Agents at Site 1000-Delta.--

--After the results of incident 1000-L██████, Dr. L██████ is to be the sole operative assigned  to active phase monitoring duty.--

--Given that three years have passed since any occurrence of SCP-1000, this SCP is now considered decommissioned.--

After the events of Incident 1000-L██████-2, SCP-1000 has been reinstated, and upgraded to Euclid class. During the 13th of each month, the 'active' phase of SCP 1000, the system of roads known collectively as 1000-Alpha are to be constantly patrolled for signs of SCP-1000. In the event said SCP is spotted, a D-class is to be inserted into a remotely controlled vehicle, and guided to the spot of its appearance. Upon acquiring SCP-1000, the vehicle is to be driven to Site 1000-Delta, and the remains of the D-class disposed of. If SCP-1000 is not spotted, this anomaly must be immediately reported. 

**Description:** SCP-1000 is a --Level 2 Humanoid Apparition, location bound, non-violent, corporeal-- Level 5 Humanoid Apparition, free roaming, corporeal, actively aggressive. It appears to be the wraith of one Mary Talish, who was abducted, ritually tortured, and executed on May 13th, 1952, in Muncie, Indiana. Starting 13 months after her death, SCP-1000 began to appear on the 13th of every month, walking down Mayflower Road (1000-Alpha), attempting to flag down any passing vehicle. It would tell anyone who picked it up that it had gotten lost, and was in need of a ride back to its home (1000-Delta). SCP-1000 would give directions in such a way as to ensure passing the graveyard where Mary Talish was buried (1000-Beta), and then encourage the driver to stop at the cemetery.  Once out of the vehicle, SCP-1000 would vanish, leaving the driver to find her sweater (1000-Gamma). Anyone touching 1000-Gamma would then feel an urge to return the item to Site 1000-Delta, and Mary Talish's parents.

When the Foundation moved in, it was found most beneficial to recruit the elder Talishs as E-class Agents of the Foundation, in order to prevent them from speaking out. Special agents were employed to pick up and transport SCP-1000, as no means of moving it were found.

**Incident 1000-L██████:** On 6/18/73, Dr. L██████, acting without permission, had special agents M██ and D██ executed, and Site 1000-Delta destroyed. His reasoning was that 'If she has no one to return to, she'll stop coming back.' Dr. L██████ was demoted for his actions, and assigned to a more permanent watch on SCP-1000 and its environs.

On 6/18/76, SCP-1000 was considered Decommissioned.

**Incident 1000-L██████-2:** On 6/18/83, Dr. L██████ returned to Site 1000-Alpha, to ensure there was no remnants of SCP-1000. His last transmission consisted only of the words 'Wait, who the hell are yo-' When security arrived on the scene, the body of Dr. L██████ was found deceased, completely exsanguinated, the words 'Your sins unforgiven' carved repeatedly upon his epidermis. Since that time, on the 13th of every month, SCP-1000 has returned, ranging wider then previously. It also no longer requires a subject to stop for it, entering whichever vehicle first passes it. It has turned quite murderous, killing anyone who interacts with it. Senior Staff are researching more efficient methods of containment.
