**Item #:** SCP-1960-J

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1960-J is currently uncontained, and no practical means of either bringing it into containment or destroying it has yet been developed.  As SCP-1960-J is uncontained, extremely dangerous, and virtually impossible to destroy, the Foundation's current approach toward interaction with SCP-1960-J focuses on observation and study, primarily from a safe distance or via the use of robotic drones.  Any personnel attempting to directly contact SCP-1960-J must be wearing heavy-duty full environmental suits with integrated life support systems.

**Description:**  SCP-1960-J is a free-floating sphere made of white stone which moves in a contiunous circular path, despite lacking any visible means of support or propulsion.  In addition to its unusual movements, SCP-1960-J exhibits a number of other anomalous properties:

* SCP-1960-J appears to absorb and/or suppress sound.  Personnel in close proximity to SCP-1960-J have reported being unable to hear any external noises.

* From a distance, SCP-1960-J is a nearly uniform bright white, but darkens appreciably as it is approached.  It appears dark gray from close range.

* SCP-1960-J exhibits spontaneous, extreme variations in temperature despite possessing no apparent internal heat source.  Its temperature has been observed to vary between -200°C and 120°C with no corresponding change in its structure or behavior.

* Even when SCP-1960-J's temperature is within the range that humans find comfortable, unprotected contact with SCP-1960-J is uniformly fatal.  Living beings that touch it asphyxiate and die almost instantly, and only heavy-duty full environmental suits have been observed to prevent this effect.

* It draws nearby objects, including living beings, towards it as if exhibiting a compulsive effect.  The strength of this compulsion increases as one nears SCP-1960-J, reaching a maximum strength of 1.62m/s^2 at a range of zero.  Objects have been observed striking SCP-1960-J with sufficient force to completely destroy them, leaving SCP-1960-J essentially unharmed.

* SCP-1960-J is currently at a safe distance from the Foundation headquarters, but Foundation scientists have proposed that a significant change in SCP-1960-J's regular circular motion could constitute an XK-class end-of-the-world scenario.

**Exploration Log SRV-3:** Robotic probe SRV-3 equipped with camera and a variety of scientific instruments dispatched to study SCP-1960-J.  Probe determined that SCP-1960-J is made primarily of basalt and provided close-up pictures of its surface, but encountered numerous interruptions to wireless data transmission and ultimately ceased operating.

**Exploration Log A1:** While preparing for their mission, team A1's transport bursts into sponaneous flame, burning with unnatural speed and temperature.  All three team members are lost.  Foundation scientists conclude that SCP-1960-J may have a psychic and/or sentient component.  SCP-1960-J ugraded to Keter.  Subsequent missions feature fireproof materials and clothing.

**Exploration Log A11:** Three Foundation personnel dispatched to make direct contact with SCP-1960-J.  All three were equipped with heavy-duty full environmental suits in the hopes that they will be able to survive the life-draining effect of contacting it.  ██████ remains in the transport to monitor the attempt and maintain wireless communications with the Foundation.  ██████ and ██████ successfully touch SCP-1960-J and survive.  Destructive analysis is authorized, and with difficulty team A11 returns with a small sample for study.  Team A11 carefully attaches a rangefinding device to SCP-1960-J, designed to carefully monitor its precise distance from Foundation headquarters and determine whether an XK-class end-of-the-world scenario is a possibility.

**Exploration Log A12:** Mission parameters very similar to A11, but an increased level of supplies allows for a longer mission.  A12 is also tasked with investigating SRV-3, and ultimately returns with several components of the broken robot for later analysis.


**Exploration Log A13:** While drawing close to SCP-1960-J, A13's transport was damaged by [DATA EXPUNGED].  The resulting explosion crippled the transport, leaving the crew unable to complete their mission.  A13 was able to abort the mission and return to headquarters with no loss of life.

**Exploration Log A17:** Mission team A17 was equipped with a purpose-built SCP-1960-J Roving Vehicle, allowing them to study SCP-1960-J's surface in great detail.  Team A17 detonated several explosives on SCP-1960-J to study the practicality of destroying SCP-1960-J, but the resulting damage was minor.  SCP-1960-J is considered essentially indestructible.

> In light of [REDACTED], all future exploration missions to SCP-1960-J are suspended.  No Foundation personnel are to make direct contact with SCP-XXXX under any circumstances.
