**Item #:** SCP-3083

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The orbit of the SCPS //Kama// has been altered to allow for easier monitoring of SCP-3083. The status of SCP-3083 is to be checked once daily, and its orientation noted if an activation event has occurred. SCP-3083-1 should always be retrieved if present, however samples of SCP-3083 need only be taken if its form is visibly altered. SCP-3083-1 instances are to be transferred to Site-22 during routine cargo exchanges with the //Kama// and stored in a secure locker.

As SCP-3083 is too small to be observed by amateur telescopes, disinformation campaigns need only be directed at major observatories. As the number of independent sightings since containment has been miniscule, disinformation is considered a Foxtrot-Omega Priority containment task.

Investigation into possible anomalous activity regarding Researcher Benich has concluded as of 14/05/2017, with negative results. Doctor Benich is not to be informed of the existence of SCP-3083.

**Description:** SCP-3083 appears to be the severed head of Researcher Corey Benich, in geosynchronous orbit above Site-22. SCP-3083 exhibits none of the expected effects of prolonged exposure to Earth's uppermost exosphere, allowing for easy sampling of biological material from the wound. Attempts to move SCP-3083 from its position have been unsuccessful.

After a period of time between 20 and 72 hours, SCP-3083 will undergo an alteration event, rotating to face a different direction. In 14% of activation events, SCP-3083 also alters its physical form; 72% of activation events include the generation of SCP-3083-1.

SCP-3083-1 are small[[footnote]]Never larger than what could be easily held in the hand.[[/footnote]] objects that manifest within 1 meter of SCP-3083 after alteration events. A partial list of SCP-3083-1 can be found below.

**Addendum: Incident 3083-01**

On 11/05/2017, Dr. Benich was given a full medical examination, as part of the ongoing investigation. A lump was discovered in her neck, and she stated that she had experiencing minor pains and growing difficulty in swallowing. Emergency surgery resulted in excision of a 2.4 cm tumor from Dr. Benich's thyroid. Chemotherapy was not considered necessary. As of 17/06/2017, Dr. Benich is fully recovered and has returned to normal duties.
