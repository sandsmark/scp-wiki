**Item #:** SCP-2803

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Area-2803 has been established around the perimeter of SCP-2803 with a public front as a military base. Satellite footage of SCP-2803 is to be expunged from Internet map data. Exploration of SCP-2803 is only to be carried out via remote drone.

Area-2803 is to be supplied with rotating armed personnel from MTF Nu-7 "Hammer Down" in the event of SCP-2803-A entering an active state. An active state can be defined as any of the following:
* Negotiation breakdown
* Lambda wave output of over 504 cycles per minute
* Attacks on non-exploratory personnel
* Mass disruption of civilian computer activity

All personal computers and internet use in a 200 km radius from Area-2803 are to be monitored for possible lambda wave influence.

In the event that SCP-2803-A enters a fully active state and military response proves insufficient, Contingency 2803-XK "Red Sun", along with subsequent media blackout and fallout protection measures, is to be implemented immediately.

Instances of SCP-2803-B are not to be disturbed in any way.

**Description:** SCP-2803 is an office building complex ██ km north of Rapid City, South Dakota, serving as the headquarters of the TotleighSoft corporation. Before TotleighSoft, SCP-2803 was an automobile manufacturing plant. This corporation has been linked to the creation of several anomalous software programs under containment by the Foundation, including [[[SCP-2527]]] and [[[SCP-2219]]].

SCP-2803-A is a tumorous growth of flesh in the center of SCP-2803, estimated to have a mass of over 197 tonnes. DNA testing of tissue samples from SCP-2803-A have yielded inconclusive results. SCP-2803-A has over 7,000 thin, chitinous tendrils entwined throughout SCP-2803, which produce a crystalline mucus that permeates the facility. 

Though it is not capable of speech on its own, SCP-2803-A is sapient and communicates through electronics in a broken dialect of English. SCP-2803-A regards itself as the CEO of TotleighSoft. SCP-2803-A emits a constant stream of lambda waves[[footnote]] Specialized telepathic energy, first discovered during experiments with SCP-████ [[/footnote]].

SCP-2803-B denotes 247 humans that have been exposed to SCP-2803-A's mucus. The majority of SCP-2803-B instances were employees of the original automotive plant. Most SCP-2803-B instances are in a constant state of meditation, serving as an amplification system for SCP-2803-A's lambda waves, while others create and package hardware for TotleighSoft. SCP-2803-A refers to instances of SCP-2803-B as employees.

The lambda waves are used to gain subliminal control of nearby computers for the purpose of creating new products for TotleighSoft. These products are often harmful to users or the general public. There is no known method to dampen or neutralize the lambda waves, and the only means of defense against them remains constant negotiation with SCP-2803-A. As SCP-2803-A has proven incapable of understanding human thought patterns, this has proven difficult.
