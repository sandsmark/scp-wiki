**Item #:** SCP-292

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-292 is to be kept at Site-72, in a guarded room in a locked, padded container set up to avoid movement of or damage to SCP-292. Access to SCP-292 is prohibited without Level-3 authorization. Site personnel must report all incidents of déjà vu or related symptoms to Site Administration.

**Description:** SCP-292 appears to be a sixty-second brass hourglass, 10 cm tall. When all its sand is at the bottom and SCP-292 is flipped over, only two outcomes have ever been observed: either the sand runs out normally after one minute, or SCP-292 is knocked over on its side. (If SCP-292 is knocked over, anomalous properties do not again manifest until all the sand in SCP-292 is in one bulb.) At no time has SCP-292 ever been observed to be flipped over a second time within sixty seconds, except when knocked over as above.

Any time SCP-292 is upright and all its sand is in its bottom bulb, and a subject attempts to flip SCP-292 over with the intent to flip it again before all its sand runs out, the subject and people nearby suddenly experience déjà vu. The intensity of déjà vu is inversely proportional to a person’s distance from SCP-292; the subject is often momentarily stunned by the experience. Persons experiencing déjà vu from the same event often describe similar “recalled” experiences. 

It is believed that when SCP-292 is flipped over, a process is started in which, if SCP-292 is flipped again before its sands run out, time flows in reverse to a point a couple seconds before SCP-292 was initially flipped. Time then flows forward again as if SCP-292 were never flipped; déjà vu would thus be a side effect of this process.

Prolonged exposure to SCP-292 can cause nausea, migraines, vertigo, hallucinations, and symptoms theorized to be consistent with [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Addendum 1: Experiment 292-31**

__Procedure:__ Subject 20311 was instructed to flip SCP-292 over, and then shoot Subject 20312 to death and flip SCP-292 back over before it runs out.

__Results:__ As Subject 20311 reached for SCP-292, both subjects as well as other personnel in the area reported feeling déjà vu. Subject 20311 exhibited elevated levels of adrenaline, while Subject 20312 exhibited pronounced apprehension in the presence of Subject 20311.

**Addendum 2: Experiment 292-46**

__Procedure:__ Subject 20461 was instructed to flip SCP-292 over, wait thirty seconds, and flip SCP-292 back over. When déjà vu is experienced, Subject 20462 was instructed to do the same thing. When déjà vu is experienced a second time, Subject 20463 was instructed to do the same thing.

__Results:__ As subject 20461 reached for SCP-292, all subjects experienced déjà vu as expected. Subject 20462 hesitated and was instructed to flip SCP-292. While reaching for SCP-292, Subject 20462 fell to his knees, Subject 20461 doubled over, and Subject 20463 staggered. Subject 20463 was instructed to flip SCP-292, and as he reached for SCP-292, all subjects [DATA EXPUNGED] and fell unconscious. Symptoms [DATA EXPUNGED], and visual and audial hallucinations persisted for several months more.

**Addendum 3: Incident 292-04**

While preparing for Experiment 292-75, Dr. █████████ suddenly clutched SCP-292 to his chest and reported he had just experienced déjà vu. Dr. █████████ said that he felt like he was about to drop SCP-292, and if he did, “something bad” would happen. Dr. ██████ has hypothesized that Dr. █████████ had indeed dropped SCP-292, but instead of breaking, SCP-292 reversed the flow of time until a moment before it was dropped. If SCP-292 does in fact possess such a self-preservation system, the potential consequences [DATA EXPUNGED].

Reclassification to Euclid approved ██/██/20██, until more information on SCP-292’s properties can be gathered and analyzed.
