**Item #:** SCP-1964

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1964 is to be contained in a standard containment chamber and access restricted to personnel with clearance from Site Director ██████. Containment chamber access code is to be changed on a bi-monthly basis. SCP-1964 is not to be plugged in outside of testing.

**Recovery:** SCP-1964 was recovered by MTF ███-█ from the home of Mr and Mrs █████, deceased. Mr and Mrs █████ showed signs of acute radiation syndrome, with heavy radiation burns to the majority of their bodies, loss of hair, and hemorrhaging. Further investigation of the house revealed high levels of waste, including excrement, blood and vomit, as well as extremely high residual radiation levels. All members of MTF ███-█ later developed multiple cancers due to improper protection.

**Description:** SCP-1964 is a 1960's era television set, but does not match any manufactured make or model and bears no branding or numbering. SCP-1964 cannot receive any broadcasts other than one channel numbered as 0. This channel shows no footage other than a looping public service announcement. Analog televisions placed in SCP-1964's containment chamber can receive signals even when SCP-1964 cannot.

The footage is superficially similar to other public service announcements of comparable age, and is roughly four and a half minutes in length. The script often references classified information and Foundation procedures, and is considered a Class-B Information Breach. For script, see Addenda 1964-1.

Subjects will display symptoms of radiation illness including nausea, dizziness, vomiting, and fever when exposed by direct viewing. Subjects will develop radiation burns when continuously exposed. After a period ranging from a few days to several weeks following exposure subjects will display severe symptoms including internal hemorrhaging. Without treatment, subjects will die.
