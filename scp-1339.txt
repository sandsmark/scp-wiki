**Item #**: SCP-1339

**Object Class**: Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1339 is to be kept in a lockbox at Site ██. The box is only allowed to be opened if approved by the senior staff at Site ██. --Any researchers Level 3 or below must receive written permission from the staff to perform experiments.-- Testing has been suspended until further notice.

**Description:** SCP-1339 is a police badge, and it bears no markings of a police department, or rank. No badge similar to SCP-1339 has been found as of this date (1/3/20██). The badge's abnormal qualities are only apparent when worn.

When SCP-1339 is fastened to the clothing of a human being (other species seem to not be affected by SCP-1339, see Test Log), henceforth referred to as the subject, they will be convinced that any actions they observe or commit are entirely justified and valid (see Addendum 1339-1 for a list of actions shown to be acceptable by subjects).  When asked about anything that occurs, the subject will always rationalize and defend the action.  Assessments of motor skills, problem solving and cognitive abilities have all proven that SCP-1339 does not impair mental facilities.

Once SCP-1339 is removed from the subject, he or she will immediately feel large amounts of guilt and depression, even if they committed no morally or ethically wrong actions while wearing it. Attempts at therapy have worked along the same lines as others with depression or guilt, with therapists noting that patients are much more resistant to both antidepressants and traditional psychiatry.  Amnesiacs have proven useful in removing "memories" of the digressions, though feelings of guilt are still reported by subjects.  In a majority of cases where treatment is not received, the subject will commit suicide.  On several occasions, the wearer has confessed to unknown crimes in suicide notes.  Despite the possibility of reopening “cold cases” or finding missing persons, it has been decided that testing is to be suspended until further notice (see incident with Dr. ███████ in Testing Log).

**Addendum 1339-1:** Subjects have been exposed to, and in some cases performed, rape, murder, mass murder, torture, forced starvation, non-medical amputation, and [REDACTED} mutilation without incident, and upon questioning, would claim all of the above actions perfectly reasonable and right. Speech patterns of subjects are similar to those of psychopaths; often speaking in a matter-of-fact manner and lacking variation in tone (see Interview 1339-1).

**Interview 1339-1:**
D-345781: Subject using SCP-1339
Dr.██████: Interviewing D-345781

**Foreword:** D-345781 has been wearing SCP-1339 for several days, during which he has personally seen the murder of Agent ███████, the termination of ██ D-Class personnel, as well as several violent attempts at escape by SCP-███.

> 
> Dr. ██████: How are you feeling, ████?
> 
> D-345781: Quite well, thank you. And you?
> 
> Dr. ██████: Fine. Now, how do you feel about what you've seen here at the Foundation? I know some of your colleagues were disturbed slightly.
> 
> D-345781: I said I'm doing fine. What happened here, it was needed. I understand that you and your people needed to do those things.
> 
> Dr. ██████: You feel no guilt over your involvement?
> 
> D-345781: Those things needed to be done.
> 
> Dr. ██████: Why do you believe that, exactly?
> 
> D-345781: Those people were unnecessary.  They did their jobs, then they died.  They complained too much, anyhow.  Especially █████.  He didn't stop until [DATA EXPUNGED].  At least that stopped him from yelling. 
>

**Closing Statement:** D-345781 had SCP-1339 removed shortly after this interview. Subject began sobbing, and collapsed into a catatonic state.  Before collapsing, he yelled incoherently for several minutes at researchers and doctors, repeatedly accusing them of being "monsters".  D-345781 was returned to his cell, and remained in his bed for a majority of a week, apparently only leaving to write (see below).  Following a period of one week of confinement, he was found dead in his cell of self inflicted stab wounds.  A crude "shank" made of a toothbrush was determined to be the suicide weapon.  A note, which was found in the cell, contained a detailed confession to three (3) crimes: the robbery of a convenience store in █████, Ohio in 19██, the murder of a woman in ██████, New York in 20██ and a physical attack on a man in Mesopotamia in 40██ B.C.  The veracity of all of the above incidents is being investigated by Foundation historians.

**Testing Log for SCP-1339**
Subject: One (1) parakeet
Duration: Thirty (30) seconds
Actions: None
Results: Parakeet stayed still, and researchers noted nothing out of the ordinary. Following this test, it is apparent that non-primate animals are not influenced by SCP-1339.

Subject: One (1) common chimpanzee, //Pan troglodytes//
Duration:Twenty four (24) hours
Actions: Subject was observed eating, climbing trees and harassing other chimps.
Results: After removal of SCP-1339, the chimp appeared to experience depression similar to that of wild animals who were recently captured, despite the fact the subject was born and raised in captivity.  After several weeks, subject was observed to be acting normally.  

Subject: D-38546
Duration: Thirty (30) seconds
Actions: None
Results: Subject preformed no illegal or unethical actions while wearing SCP-1339, but experienced heavy depression nonetheless.  While in therapy, subject confessed to feelings of guilt over the death of a childhood pet (an incident found to be true by contacting family of D-38546), the beating and killing of a homeless man in 19██ (long before the birth of the subject) and several Foundation projects, including [DATA EXPUNGED].  D-38546 was given a Class-A amnesiac immediately and is currently returned to D-Class living area.

//Note: Yes, SCP-1339 has helped local authorities in some cases. However, we cannot afford to keep giving psychotherapy and pills to subjects. And showing up at the sheriff's door with a list of unsolved murders and missing persons from decades ago is not exactly the most subtle thing the Foundation has ever done. Testing is suspended from now on unless approved and supervised by the senior staff.-Dr. ████//

**Testing of SCP-1339-Section Two (2):** New testing has been authorized temporarily by the senior staff, for the express purpose of determining if subjects using SCP-1339 are valid for use as SCP Foundation personnel. Due to their lack of guilt or remorse, at least while wearing SCP-1339, users have been speculated to be superior to regular personnel in dealing with more morally questionable actions performed by the Foundation.

Subject: D-84766
Duration: Two (2) months
Actions: D-84766 was given private quarters for the duration of the experiment, the only notable feature of which was a standard, 24-inch monitor.  Said monitor was built into the wall for the express purpose of the experiment.  Following the attachment of the badge, D-84766 was led to the room and locked inside.  Meals were to be delivered by staff three times a day.  During the day, between the hours of six (6) A.M. and eight (8) P.M. (GMT), the monitor broadcast a live feed of Foundation activities declared to be the most morally questionable by a survey of personnel.  Staff delivering meals were given the ability to request that the feed be muted or turned off while they visited the quarters.  Following two months of exposure, D-84766 was brought out of her quarters and given a psychiatric evaluation by Dr. █████, who declared that she was of entirely sound mind.  

//People have gotten physically sick from __hearing__ about those things.  How the [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] did she not even flinch?
-Dr. █████//

D-84766 had SCP-1339 removed after evaluation.  The subject entered a catatonic state upon removal, and began screaming incoherently.  Nearby staff reported that the subject attempted to remove her own ears and eyes before being restrained by security.  After being given a sedative, D-84766 was returned to her quarters, where she refused to speak to personnel for thirteen weeks.  On 9/3/20██, visiting staff reported that the subject was laying face down on the floor.  Medical staff discovered that D-84766 was unconscious, and she was shortly thereafter transferred to the medical ward.  After five (5) hours, the subject awoke.

While in the medical ward, the subject was responsive to an interview by Dr. ███████ (see Interview 1339-2). Following the interview, the subject stabbed herself thirteen times in chest, neck and face with an empty syringe. Death was caused by piercing of the subject's jugular. No note was found on the scene, but Dr. ███████ did produce a paper the subject gave to him during their interview.

**Interview 1339-2:**
D-84766: Subject of SCP-1339 experimentation
Dr. ███████: Interviewing subject
>
> 
> Dr. ███████: How are you feeling, ███████?
> 
> D-84766: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. All of it.
> 
> Dr. ███████: Sorry for what?
> 
> D-84766: You of all people should know. Those…things that you have here. I saw them. I saw them and I helped them. I helped you.  I...was part of your...foundation.
> 
> Dr. ███████: Ma'am, you did not leave your quarters once during your wearing of SCP-133-
> 
> D-84766: Don't! No! I can't…can't…I was wrong…wrong, but I was right…it's all right, but it's all wrong…right and wrong…right and wrong right and wrong right and wrong right and wrong…
>

**Closing Statement:** Following the end of the log, subject threw a piece of paper at Dr. ███████. D-84766 then grabbed syringe and committed suicide as outlined above. Dr. ███████ immediately gave note to Foundation authorities. Note reads as follows-

> ██████, Kansas, 18██. Murder. Mine.
> 
> ███, China, 19██. Rape. Mine.
> 
> ██████, Site ██, 20██. [REDACTED]. All mine.
> 
> [Note continues for several paragraphs like this, naming locations, dates and crimes, and naming the subject as the perpetrator. The paper ends abruptly, indicating a date that has not yet occurred and naming a yet-unknown individual. Attempts to find this individual have been unsuccessful.]

Subject: Doctor ███████
Duration: Five (5) weeks.
Actions: Doctor ███████ preformed his usual duties as administrator, among them approving testing and overseeing experiments. During the time SCP-1339 was worn, Dr. ███████ approved all applications for experimentation given to him, eventually reaching the point of obviously humorous or false applications being approved, among them requests to set Keter class SCPs free, and petitions to promote violent D-Class personnel to 05. All approved applications were later vetoed by staff.
Results: Doctor ███████ was deemed psychologically normal following removal, though his wife and colleagues reported that he seemed "different". After two weeks, Dr. ███████ failed to report to work, and agents were sent to his house to investigate. Once there, Agent ███ and Agent ████ discovered the bodies of Dr. ███████ and his wife, victims of an apparent murder-suicide. Both died of multiple stab wounds, Dr. ███████'s self-inflicted, and a note was discovered near his body. In it, he confessed guilt to multiple crimes, including the murder of his wife, ████.

//Note: That is it. This thing makes you able to handle some of what we do for a little while, but we cannot have every personnel involved with a 'messy accident' wind up killing themselves or others. All testing is ended. SCP-1339 is to be left in a locked storage area at Site ██, permanently. May those poor [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] rest in peace. If they can.
-Doctor ████//
