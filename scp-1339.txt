**Item #**: SCP-1339

**Object Class**: Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1339 is to be kept in a lockbox at Site ██. The box is only allowed to be opened if approved by the senior staff at Site ██. Any researchers Level 3 or below must receive written permission from the staff to perform experiments. Testing has been suspended until further notice.

**Description:** SCP-1339 is a police badge, and it bears no markings of a police department, or rank. No badge similar to SCP-1339 has been found as of this date (1/3/20██). The badge's abnormal qualities are only apparent when it is worn.

When SCP-1339 is fastened to the clothing of a human being, henceforth referred to as the subject, they will be convinced that any actions they observe or commit are entirely justified and valid. This includes petty crimes and injustices up to and including murder and rape (see Addendum 1339-1). The subject, when asked about the incidents, will always rationalize and defend the action. The subject is perfectly mentally sound during this time, experiencing no decrease or increase in intelligence and sanity.

Once SCP-1339 is removed from the subject, he or she will be immediately overwhelmed by feelings of guilt and sadness, even if they committed no morally or ethically wrong actions while wearing it. Attempts at therapy have worked along the same lines as others with depression or guilt, though progress has been noted as much slower by therapists. In most cases (95%), however, the subject will commit suicide shortly after removing the badge, leaving a similar note each time in which they confess for crimes ranging from minor to large scale. On several occasions, the crimes being confessed to were unknown or without a suspect. Despite the possibility of reopening “cold cases” or finding missing persons, it has been decided that testing is to be suspended until further notice (see incident with Dr. ███████ in Testing Log).

**Addendum 1339-1(Level 4 Clearance Required):** Subjects have been exposed to, and in some cases, preformed rape, murder, mass murder, torture, forced starvation, amputation, and mutilation without incident, and upon questioning, would claim all of the above were perfectly reasonable and right. Their manners are similar to those of psychopaths; often speaking in a matter-of-fact manner and lacking variation in tone (see Interview 1339-1).

**Interview 1339-1(Level 4 Clearance Required):**
D-345781: Subject using SCP-1339
Dr.██████: Interviewing D-345781

**Foreword:** D-345781 has been wearing SCP-1339 for several days, during which he has personally seen the murder of Agent ███████, the termination of ██ D-Class personnel, as well as several fights between [DATA EXPUNGED], and personally been a part of [DATA EXPUNGED], after which he was the only person involved to not seek counseling.

> Dr. ██████: How are you feeling, ████?
> 
> D-345781: Quite well, thank you. And you?
> 
> Dr. ██████: Fine. Now, how do you feel about [DATA EXPUNGED]? I know you were involved with it, and I was wondering if you were doing al-
> 
> D-345781: I said I am doing fine. What happened there, it was needed. I understand that those people needed to do those things.
> 
> Dr. ██████: You feel no guilt over your involvement?
> 
> D-345781: [DATA EXPUNGED] needed to be done. It was right. A good thing was done that day.
> 
> Dr. ██████: Why do you believe that, exactly?
> 
> D-345781: Those people were unnecessary. They took up space, and they complained too much. They really did never stop whining. Especially the young ones. It was for the best they were [DATA EXPUNGED]. Admittedly, it was too messy for my tastes.

**Closing Statement:** D-345781 had SCP-1339 removed shortly after this interview. Subject began sobbing, and collapsed into a catatonic state, screaming of "things I've done", "lies and lies upon lies", and incoherently mentioning "right and wrong, right and wrong, right and wrong" before the phrase blurred and subject collapsed.

D-345781 was found dead a week later. Autopsy revealed [DATA EXPUNGED], apparently self inflicted. A single note was left by the deceased, confessing to [DATA EXPUNGED] in ████, Ohio in 19██, the robbery of a █████ ████ in New York in 20██, and the theft of wheat in 40██ B.C.E. These confessions, all of which are impossible for the subject to have committed, are being researched by Foundation historians.

**Testing Log for SCP-1339**
Subject: D-67195
Duration of Exposure: Two (2) weeks
Actions During Exposure: Minor theft, robbery, burglary
Results: Subject experienced deep depression following exposure to SCP-1339, appeared to be improving after being on anti-depressants. However, subject eventually broke down and slit own wrists with a piece of broken glass they somehow acquired. No note was left.

Subject: One (1) parakeet
Duration: Thirty (30) seconds
Actions: None
Results: Parakeet stayed still, experienced nothing out of the ordinary. Following this test, it is apparent that animals are not influenced by SCP-1339.

Subject: D-38546
Duration: Thirty (30) seconds
Actions: None
Results: Subject preformed no illegal or unethical actions while wearing SCP-1339, but experienced heavy depression nonetheless. Subject blamed self for such incidents as [DATA EXPUNGED] and other Foundation actions, which, prior to exposure, subject was unaware of. Subject received heavy therapy and medication, and remains under suicide watch after a note was discovered. The note was a confession to a series of murders and tortures, as well as [DATA EXPUNGED].

Subject: D-58365
Duration: Two (2) days
Actions: Murder, rape, theft
Results: Subject assumed fetal position when SCP-1339 was removed, and began crying silently. Subject remained in position for several weeks, only stopping to eat, drink, expel waste and write. After several weeks, subject was found by staff to have hung self using bed sheet. Suicide note reads as follows:"i did it. all of it. everything. im so so sorry. i was there, ████. and ███████. █████. I'M SORRYYYY…[etc.]" Note continues for several pages, all of it the word "sorry" repeated over and over. The locations named were all sites of missing persons, who were lost for between ten (10) to one hundred (100) years. Investigations are still ongoing.

Note: Yes, SCP-1339 has helped local authorities in some cases. However, we cannot afford to keep giving psychotherapy and pills to subjects, and showing up at the sheriff's door with a list of unsolved murders and missing persons from decades ago is not exactly the most subtle thing the Foundation has ever done. Testing is suspended from now on unless approved and supervised by the senior staff.-Dr. ████

**Testing of SCP-1339-Section Two (2):** New testing has been authorized temporarily by the senior staff, for the express purpose of determining if subjects using SCP-1339 are valid for use as Foundation personnel. Due to their lack of guilt or remorse, at least while possessing SCP-1339, they have been considered superior to regular personnel in dealing with more morally questionable actions.

Subject: D-84766
Duration: Two (2) months
Actions: Subject was to be treated as standard, Level One (1) personnel for the duration of SCP-1339's influence. Subject participated in two (2) terminations of D-class personnel, observed multiple experiments using D-class personnel and Keter class objects, and administered punishment to two dozen personnel. Punishment inflicted ranged from minor to premature termination.
Results: Subject functioned well as a member of the Foundation, and their lack of moral issues proved to be an advantage in situations where other researchers would be psychologically or emotionally damaged. However, subject experienced similar symptoms following removal as previous wearers. D-84766, in this case, remained silent for thirteen weeks in their cell, and refused to communicate with anyone, including themselves. After thirteen weeks of silence, subject began screaming incoherently, and was escorted to medical ward.

While in medical ward, subject was responsive to an interview by Dr. ███████ (see Interview SCP-1339-2). Following interview, subject stabbed self thirteen times in chest, neck and face with an empty syringe. Death was caused by piercing of the subject's jugular. No note was found on the scene, but Dr. ███████ did produce a note the subject gave to him during their interview.

**Interview 1339-2:**
D-84766: Subject of SCP-1339 experimentation
Dr. ███████: Interviewing subject
> <Begin Log>
> 
> Dr. ███████: How are you feeling, ███████?
> 
> D-84766: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. All of it.
> 
> Dr. ███████: Sorry for what?
> 
> D-84766: You of all people should know. Those…things that you have here. I saw them. I saw them and I helped them. I gave [DATA EXPUNGED]. And those girls. Those girls didn't deserve it. They had such bright futures…
> 
> Dr. ███████: Sir, you were involved with nothing of that sort during your wearing of SCP-1339. Y-
> 
> D-84766: DON'T! NO! I can't…can't…I was wrong…wrong, but I was right…it's all right, but it's all wrong…right and wrong…right and wrong right and wrong right and wrong right and wrong…
> 
> <End Log>

**Closing Statement:** Following the end of the log, subject gave a torn piece of paper to Dr. ███████. Subject then grabbed syringe and began suicide as outlined above. Dr. ███████ immediately gave note to Foundation authorities. Note reads as follows-

"██████, Kansas, 18██. Murder. Mine.

███, China, 19██. Rape. Mine.

██████, Site ██, 20██. [REDACTED]. All mine.

[Note continues for several paragraphs like this, naming locations, dates and crimes, and naming the subject as the perpetrator. Note ends abruptly, naming a date that has not yet occurred and naming a yet-unknown individual. Attempts to find this individual have been unsuccessful.]

Subject: D-219856
Duration: Doctor ███████
Actions: Doctor ███████ preformed his usual duties as administrator, among them approving testing and overseeing experiments. During the time SCP-1339 was worn, Dr. ███████ approved all applications for experimentation given to him, eventually reaching the point of obviously humorous or false applications being approved, among them requests to set Keter class SCPs free, petitions to have D-class personnel promoted to Level 4 researchers, and [REDACTED]. All were later vetoed by staff.
Results: Doctor ███████ seemed to be perfectly normal following removal, though in the coming days and weeks, his wife and colleagues reported that he seemed out of the ordinary. After two weeks, Dr. ███████ failed to report to work, and Agents were sent to his house to investigate. Once there, Agents ███ and ████ discovered the bodies of Dr. ███████ and his wife, victims of an apparent murder-suicide. Both died of [DATA EXPUNGED], and a note was discovered near Dr. ███████'s body. In it, he confessed guilt to multiple crimes, including the murder of his wife, ████.

Note: That is it. This thing makes you able to handle what we do for a little while, but we cannot have every personnel involved with a 'messy accident' wind up killing themselves or others. All testing is ended. SCP-1339 is to be left in a locked storage area at Site ██, permanently. May those poor [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] rest in peace. If they can.
-Doctor ████
