[[cell style="font-family: Courier"]]
We are on the balcony of the second-floor of a lovely, expensive beach-side resort. The weather is perfect for relaxing outside; at 35°C (or 95°F), there is no reason not to get some fresh air. The wind is, at worst, incredibly light. Seagulls are out on the sand, and the ocean is still. We see our main star, Researcher Talloran, lying in a soft chair underneath a parasol. Meanwhile, Doctor Hikari Yamada has opted directly for sunbathing. Despite the weather, both are in their professional work clothes. If one didn't know better, they'd think that it was colder than it actually is.

[[cell style="font-family: Courier"]]
RESEARCHER TALLORAN awakens with a startle, with it being the first time in 452,380 years that a new cycle began in a place not born of darkness. The area is unfamiliar; when was the last time TALLORAN ever been to anything like a hotel, let alone a beach? To the right is someone real familiar; DOCTOR HIKARI YAMADA. It doesn't take YAMADA long to notice TALLORAN, now shuffling around the balcony in a nervous sweat. She looks up from her Wired June 2017 issue and chuckles.

[[span style="font-family: Courier"]]It was... about my teenage years and young adulthood. I had a real rough time surviving before I got picked up by the Foundation. It's tough. But it's hard to remember that many details about it. I just know quite a bit of it was my own fuck-ups.[[/span]]

[[span style="font-family: Courier"]]Again, hard to remember, but... not taking the chance to move houses when I had the finances, or not sticking up for myself when it would have saved me jobs. Shit like that.[[/span]]

[[span style="font-family: Courier"]]Maybe The Being is eating up your negative emotions. That could be likely, especially if you're at the point now where you're unstressed enough that you can spend time here and enjoy it. I mean, relative to everything else.[[/span]]

[[span style="font-family: Courier"]]Hey... our session is almost up. But I just want to ask you about something. Earlier, you talked about the Foundation being traumatizing, and having a rough young adulthood. But you didn't say anything about it being wholly your fault when it wasn't, and vice versa, right?[[/span]]
