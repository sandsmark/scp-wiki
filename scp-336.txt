**Item #:** SCP-336
 
**Object Class:** Euclid
 
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-336 is to be provided living quarters 6m x 6m in size, maintained regularly. SCP-336 may request furnishings or items; however, approval of these requests is contingent on SCP-336's cooperation with personnel and subject to Dr. Erickson's approval. Requests for access to anomalous or dangerous items are to be denied.
 
A voice modulator device, fitted over SCP-336’s mouth, is to be checked and maintained by Level 0 personnel weekly. The modulator’s power supply is also to be checked for integrity during this maintenance. In the event of the device’s failure, local lockdown procedures are to be respected until the SCP-336 has been isolated. Under no circumstances is SCP-336 to be allowed contact with personnel of Level 3 clearance or higher.
 
**Description:** SCP-336 appears to be a pale-skinned human female of otherwise Arabic or Middle-Eastern descent in its late twenties. SCP-336 is 1.73m (5ft,8in) in height and weighs 68kg (150lbs) as of its last physical. Subject requires no sleep or sustenance, and does not appear to be affected by aging or sickness of any nature. Of note are two small bony protrusions growing from the subject’s back, which appear to be vestigial wings. Analysis of SCP-336's genome indicates these wings are most likely related to those of [DATA EXPUNGED].
 
SCP-336 behaves impassively and detached with regards to human beings and demonstrates highly introverted behavior. The subject is highly intelligent and analytical, having scored in the 95th percentile or above in most intelligence tests. A noticeable improvement in attitude is observed when SCP-336 uses a mirror, as the subject has been noted to be highly narcissistic, and has a tendency to spend long periods of time admiring its reflection. SCP-336 has also expressed significant interest in flowers, particularly poppies and white roses.
 
SCP-336 is capable of influencing sentient thought through verbal suggestion and is able to manipulate a subject’s actions in all cases that do not conflict with self-preservation. This effect is psychic in nature, as it has been seen to affect the deaf no differently. SCP-336 has been fitted with a speech modulation unit, which blocks, interprets, and re-transmits anything that SCP-336 says through a synthesized female voice, effectively neutralizing the subject's vocal abilities.
 
In addition to its aforementioned psychic effect, SCP-336 is capable of affecting the feelings of others towards itself. Personnel who under normal circumstances find females sexually attractive have found that thoughts of love or attraction directed towards SCP-336 are impossible to maintain. Feelings of love towards other people are mitigated as well when in the immediate presence of SCP-336, with removal from its proximity dismissing the effect. SCP-336 has reported that it is incapable of feeling affection towards people, and maintains that this is a positive aspect of its personality.
 
SCP-336 was originally found operating a flower shop within a small town in █████. When questioned about the shop, local residents reported that it had “always been there,” despite no records on file indicating its existence. Examination of the building’s foundation and construction indicate that it had far preceded human settlement in the region. When a Foundation researcher encountered the shop on vacation, SCP-336 approached him, and began to close shop. When asked where it was going, SCP-336 answered, “The same place you’re going, I suppose.” and returned with him to a nearby Foundation facility, before being relocated to Site 17.
