**Item #:** SCP-336

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-336 is to be provided living quarters 10m x 10m in size, maintained with standard package B-34. She is to be provided standard issue clothing for humanoid SCP. Since electronic monitoring equipment is unable to film SCP-336, one-way viewing apertures monitored by Level 2 Security personnel are stationed at SCP-336’s containment area at all times. The one way viewing surface is treated with AgNO3 in order to provide the one mirror requested by SCP-336.

A voice modulator device fitted over SCP-336’s mouth is to be checked and maintained by Level 2 personnel wearing headgear lined with Telekill alloy and with form fitted earplug radio receivers to prevent hearing SCP-336’s voice and to allow communication between each other. In the event of the device’s failure, SCP-336’s containment will be locked down and no less than four (4) security personnel will restrain her until the device has been repaired. 

Researchers and personnel security level 2 and above may request interviews with SCP-336 by submitting a written proposal to Dr. ████████

SCP-336 has requested the following items for her containment:

* 1 Oak Four Poster Bed with stuffed mattress and goose down pillow. (DENIED)
* 1 Oak Dresser with full sized Vanity and a selection of Victorian clothing. (DENIED)
* White Roses and Poppies to decorate her containment area, provided on a 3 month replacement schedule. (DENIED)
* A Selection of books of varied topics, including romance epics and poetry, modern fantasy and periodicals of current events. (APPROVED books, DENIED Periodicals)
* Time outside her containment cell to exercise and to gain access to some ‘fresh air’. (Pending Approval)
* 1 Mirror, Full Length (APPROVED, incorporated into containment procedures.)

**Description:** SCP-336 appears to be a pale-skinned female of  otherwise Arabic or Middle-Eastern descent in her late twenties. She is 1.73m in height, and weighs 49.9kg. Subject appears to require no sleep, food, or sustenance, and does not appear to age and testing has shown she is immune to known illnesses. SCP-336’s blood samples appear normal to testing methods available given SCP-336’s unique properties, though destructive chemical testing indicates potentially two additional DNA pairings in SCP-336’s structure. Research continues on samples of SCP-336’s samples to determine if these additional pairings contribute to SCP-336’s abilities. 

SCP-336’s is able to manipulate the modulation of her voice to cause a reaction in the inner ear structure of humans. She has shown the ability to inspire feelings of euphoria and light-headedness in those listening to her speak, as well as dizziness, loss of balance and unconsciousness. Her speech appears to contain memetic properties, as those that follow her directives apparently gain similar persuasive abilities as well. How she imparts this ability on others is still a subject for testing. This secondary effect has proven to be suppressed by Telekill alloy, and has been included in containment protocols. SCP-336 uses this ability along with her own natural skills at persuasion and manipulation in order to achieve her goals.

In addition, no known form of electronic system has been able to capture an image or audio of SCP-336. Samples taken from SCP-336 also follow this pattern, so testing has been limited to observational testing and destructive chemical testing done with simple optical magnification tools and other manual methods. This has foiled most attempts at in-depth analysis of SCP-336’s unusual biological structure. Physical examination has also determined unusual formations along her upper spinal column and shoulders, without X-ray there is speculation that these structures share similarities with vestigial wings found in flightless birds. Research continues on samples of SCP-336 in order to determine what level of technological assistance is possible in analysis of SCP-336. Of note, the basis for the design for the voice modulator that dampens SCP-336’s vocal abilities was discovered in one of several notebooks recovered from one of ███████ ███████’s workshops among sketches of his more famous works. Notes written around this drawing seem to indicate the design was created in 15██. Since the drawings seem specifically designed for SCP-336, this gives at least a potential idea of how long SCP-336 has existed.

SCP-336, prefers to be known as “Lilith.” She behaves impassively and detached around other people, normally preferring privacy to interaction amongst Foundation staff. Psychological testing indicates a Narcissistic personality with Sociopathic tendencies. Testing has indicated high levels of analytical skill and creativity, but as consistent with previous observations, she has little empathy for other people. SCP-336 cooperates unwillingly with Foundation testing and interviews, and has repeatedly attempted to breach containment through manipulation of security and maintenance personnel. SCP-336 shows particular disdain for male personnel and has often attempted to manipulate male personnel that provide her containment maintenance to disrupt their social and professional lives, apparently for her own amusement. When not interacting or attempting to manipulate Foundation staff, SCP-336 will spend hours viewing herself in the mirror incorporated into her security measures.

**Record of Acquisition**
SCP-336 was originally found operating a flower shop within a small town in █████. The town attracted Foundation attention when long-term pattern analysis detected anomalous patterns of marriages, deaths and population fluctuations in this town. Investigation led to the discovery of a flower shop run by SCP-336 that had no records of original purchase or creation. When questioned by Foundation agents SCP-336 used her abilities to manipulate Agent ███████ into attacking the other agents in his team, then commit suicide. Following strike teams were able to contain SCP-336 with the assistance of noise-cancelling microphones and helmets. She was then taken to Site 17 for containment.

**Addendum 336-A:** SCP-336 has made several comments relating to [[[SCP-073]]] and [[[SCP-076]]], exhibiting a wealth of prior knowledge relating to the two, although she has been adamant about not sharing this information.

**Addendum 336-B:** When questioned about [[[SCP-071]]] and [[[SCP-166]]], she has been shown to exhibit anger and resentment at the very mention, refusing to answer further inquiries.
