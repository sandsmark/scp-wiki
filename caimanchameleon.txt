Hello! I'm CaimanChameleon,
Welcome to my art page!
I make some Low Poly-ish (for lack of a better word) of different SCPs and stuff. 
[[collapsible show="Why do some images have a TK logo on it?" hide="I've gone by many names"]]

I have gone by ThaumielKeter (it's my Reddit name, Don't judge) and ThaumKet but realized it was stupid and went with this name.

[[collapsible show="Why CaimanChameleon?" hide="No, I'm Not a Scalie"]]

I come from a Colombian family and was born in Florida. A caiman is a type of Alligator that is found in Colombia and there are alligators in Florida. 
I thought it was clever. 

The chameleon part is just because of my love for chameleons

Yeah, I do. $5 for one $8 for two. I am willing for a bargain if you need to. I can make some art for your SCP, but I don't recommend using it for an image //on// your SCP, it will look out of place
