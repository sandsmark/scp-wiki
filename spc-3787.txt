++++ NOTICE FROM THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE COORDINATION AND PROJECTS OPERATION COMMAND OFFICE

SPC-3787 is currently on hiatus due to failed beta testing. Operation SEA-HORSE will resume functionality when the selachian-fear response can be removed from all SPC-3787 instances. Several methods of removing this response are currently being tested. The breeding of SPC-3787 instances has been placed on hold until further advancements are made.

**Selachian Pugnātorial Capabilities:**  SPC-3787 has shown potential for selachian combat and is an efficient form of non-combative aquatic transport for Centre agents. Further testing is needed to gauge the level of effectiveness during selachian combat situations.

>
**Project Component(s):** SPC-3787 are 30  genetically modified members of a species of aquatic equestrian entities, resembling the domestic horse (//Equus ferus caballus//). SPC-3787 are aquatic mammals with internal biology similar to that of killer whales (//Orcinus orca//), and possessing webbed feet with a similar biological makeup to duck-billed platypus (//Ornithorhynchus anatinus//). A total of 20 natural SPC-3787 instances were originally discovered in the ocean near Krochov's Point, Alaska. Showing no aversion to humans, all instances were acquired without incident. 
>
**Augmentation Summary:** Using gene-splicing techniques, the original 20 SPC-3787 instances were used to breed 30 modified SPC-3787 instances. Modified specimens have increased muscle mass,  are capable of swimming 160 kph, and holding their breath for up to two and a half hours at a time.

**Operation SEA-HORSE:** It is the goal of Operation SEA-HORSE to provide Centre agents with a quick, efficient, and sturdy means of aquatic transportation during selachian combat. The rigorous training program has enabled SPC-3787 riders increased speed and maneuverability during underwater obstacle course training. Alpha testing shows that top speeds of 160 kph allowed the SPC-3787 rider to punch selachian dummies with exponentially increased force. The project is utilizing SPC-3787's strength to find efficient ways of increasing the carrying capacity for selachian pugnātory equipment. Alpha testing indicates an increase in morale during formation drills and other training exercises. Operation SEA-HORSE is ready to begin the beta testing phase, in which SPC-3787 will be tested during live selachian combat.

Operation SEA-HORSE has created anti-selachian propaganda in order to boost morale and promote the project.

+++ After Action Report

**__Beta Test 3787-1__**

**Date:** 8/42/2004

**Enemies:** Four Bull-Class Selachian Entities.

**Objective:** Two Minnow-Class personnel are to ride SPC-3787-13 and SPC-3787-14 into combat against the selachian entities.

**Data:** 
>
= **VIDEO LOG**
----
**NOTE:** The two Minnow-Class (M-8687 and M-8656) disembark from U.S.S. Knuckle-Sandwich approximately 100 meters from selachian entities. A camera is mounted to M-8687's helmet in order to observe punching procedures.

[BEGIN LOG]

**13:32:** SPC-3787 is performing as expected, as the Minnow-Class make their approach.

**13:34** Four selachian entities become visible in the distance.

**13:35:** Both instances of SPC-3787 begin to slow their approach.

**13:36:** The four selachian entities begin approaching the Minnow-Class and SPC-3787 instances. 

**13:38:** Upon seeing the selachian entities both instances of SPC-3787 begin bucking and showing signs of distress. The Minnow-Class attempt to calm the instances but are met with resistance.

**13:41:** The selachian entities are now 5 meters from the Minnow-Class, SPC-3787 instances both shake lose the Minnow class riding them.

**13:42:** Two of the selachian entities attempt to attack SPC-3787-13, which responds by swiftly kicking both entities before swimming off-camera with SPC-3787-14.

**13:43:** M-8656 is seen fighting the other two selachian entities, several punches land but M-8656 is terminated via selachian entity.

**13:45:** While punching a selachian entity M-8687 is swarmed by the remaining three entities.

**13:46:** Visuals become a blurred shade of red before the video feed terminates.

**__Researcher's Notes__** 
We probably should've tested if they get spooked by sharks.
