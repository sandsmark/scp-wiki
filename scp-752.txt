**Item #:** SCP-752

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:**  Areas 752-1-4 have been constructed around the four known entrances to SCP-752.  No personnel are permitted to enter SCP-752, although unmanned infiltration missions using technology taken from inside SCP-752 are permitted.  In the event of a uncontrollable containment breach Protocol Shangdu-47 must be implemented.

Captured instances of SCP-752-1 must be transported to Site-17 for questioning and examination and under no circumstance allowed to return to SCP-752.  Instances of SCP-752-1 found approaching any of the 752 sites are to be terminated on sight.

**Description:**  SCP-752 is an underground city in the northern █████████ Mountains, spanning ███ km^^2^^.  An artificial sun powered by a geothermal difference engine creates day and night matching the rhythm of the outside world.  A shield built of an unknown metal surrounds the entire city and blocks all known signals and radiation, including sonar.  Study of this metal is restricted to on-site efforts to minimize the chances of containment breach.

SCP-752-1 are the inhabitants of SCP-752.  Physically, SCP-752-1 appear human.  However, the social behaviour exhibited by SCP-752-1 in large groups bears no resemblance to that of humans or any other social mammal (although parallels exist between ants and other social insects.)  Individuals of SCP-752-1 possess no self-interest whatsoever and are motivated solely by desire to advance the ’greater good’ of SCP-752.  SCP-752-1 currently possess technology more advanced than exists outside of SCP-752, and are advancing much more quickly than the outside world.

Documents recovered at the sites indicate that SCP-752 was constructed ██ years ago by a group of unidentified scientists and philosophers, operating under the alias ‘Eudaimon.’  SCP-752-1 was engineered by Eudaimon as an attempt to create a ‘ideal society.’

**Document 752-3** (recovered from Site-752-1
> Day 1
> Eudaimon-Alpha-1 
> Population of Eudaimonia: 20
> What a glorious new day.  This is the day Homo Eudaimoniac will set their calendar by.  After the last battery of mass testing, we’ve introduced ten males and ten females to the final testing area.  Nothing but them, the artificial sun, and the few animal and plant species we’ve introduced for domestication.
> Nothing left for Eudaimon now but to observe.

**Document 752-7**  (recovered from Site-752-3)
> Year 3, Day 24
> Eudaimon-Gamma-1
> Population of Eudaimonia: 212
> Population growth has been explosive, as expected from our Eudaimoniacs.  Instead of competing they cooperate with one another in everything.  All of the animal species provided have been successfully domesticated for food and labour.  No signs of agricultural activity yet.

**Document 752-22**  (recovered from Site-752-4)
> Year 7, Day 212
> Eudaimon-Delta-4
> Population of Eudaimonia: ~4300
> Growth has continued, showing marked deviance from normal human social behaviour.  Whereas Homo sapien was never intended to live in groups of more than a few hundred, eudaimoniac will function perfectly in groups of thousands or millions.  Agriculture going at full tilt now, making use of the available aquifers for irrigation.
> Deviant behaviours have begun to emerge.  The taboo against cannibalism seems to have vanished and dead Eudaimoniacs are being consumed for sustenance.  Additionally, disabled or feeble individuals are suiciding or being killed at a worrying rate.  Beta-1 wants to interfere, try to lay down moral guidelines, but Alpha-1 insists that finding these things repulsive is one of the problems with our society and any interaction could ‘taint‘ the Eudaimoniacs.

**Document 752-70 (recovered from Site-752-2)
> Year 15, Day 4
> Eudaimon-Beta-4
> Population of Eudaimonia: ~100000
> Population growth shows no signs of slowing.  Some other extremely worrying behaviors have begun to emerge.  The Eudaimoniacs have developed a meritocracy caste system, and are forcing the strongest and least intelligent to build for them.  No, not forcing -- the workers do it voluntarily, but they’re working themselves to death.  In fact, everybody in this society is being worked to death.  Estimated life expectancy is about forty-five, and we proved in the initial testing that Eudaimoniacs can live to 150 easily.  No signs of cultural development so far, except that they’ve built the vague hints of a divine ‘creator’ called the Eudaimon into a brutally strict moral system.  On the bright side, they’ve taken to heart the idea that one day the Eudaimon will come back for them and lead them to another world, as we’d intended.
> We’ve been calling these odd behaviours ‘deviant,’ but they’re not.  This society has no deviance.  All innovation is judged based on its merits and implemented or discarded.  I’m starting to have serious doubts about the value of this whole thing.  Alpha-1 and his team of geneticists seem oddly unsurprised by these developments, I bet they knew this would happen.

**Document 752-142** (recovered from Site-752-1)
> Year 22, Day 325
> Eudaimon-Alpha-1
> Population of Eudaimonia: ~100000000
> Population growth has slowed to near stagnation, indicating that we are approaching the ideal population density.  Even better, now that they’ve stopped directing all their energy towards breeding their technological prowess has begun to increase exponentially.  At this rate I project they will surpass us soon after the release date.
> Beta, Gamma and Delta have no vision -- they grow increasingly disgusted by my wonderful creations.  I never wanted to bring them on the project in the first place, but I needed their skills to design the developmental unit.  I may have to take measures to forestall a mutiny.

**Document 752-314**
> Year 25, Day 87
> Eudaimon Delta-1
> Population of Eudaimonia: ~100000000
> Population has stagnated and gone into a very slow decline.  Technological advancement exceeded all expectations and will surpass our own well before the intended release date.  Undesirable behaviours have worsened.  Gamma attempted to intervene and was slaughtered.  The rest of us attempted a coup against Alpha.  Alpha-3 pretended to sympathise and managed to fatally poison most of Beta.
> Nevertheless, the coup was a success.  Alpha-1, 2 and 5 escaped, the others are dead or captured.  We’ve disabled the release mechanism and sealed off the place as much as we dare.  The Eudaimoniacs still believe that there’s no world beyond that shield Gamma built.  Now, hopefully, they’ll never learn otherwise.

As direct competition between Homo sapien and SCP-752-1 is projected to lead to a CK-class event, SCP-752-1 must be kept ignorant of the world outside their cavern at all costs.

Neutralization of the entire city will be considered if the technological advancement of SCP-752 threatens to exceed the Foundation’s own capabilities.
