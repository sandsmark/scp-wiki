**Item #:** SCP-561

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-561 has an unidentified epicenter, but it's "radius" covers several square kilometres of Canadian wilderness, near the former small town of ██████████. It is currently listed as a nature preserve, and the entire area is fenced in with guards posted and patrolling outside the chain-link boarders. The fence is to be a minimum of 3.05m (10ft) in height, with an electrified wire along the top, as well as barbed wire loops. Intruders are to be taken into custody, stripped of any recording devices or photographic devices, interrogated on whatever they may have seen, and if needed may have their memory altered by whatever means necessary. If intruders are injured by any of the products of SCP-561, they may be airlifted to the nearest hospital, and given the cover story of a bear attack.

The products of SCP-561 may only be moved by certain personnel to whatever site is necessary for testing, and any products of SCP-561 found outside the fenced parameters may be terminated on sight unless accompanied by appropriate personnel or part of [Group N] [See Addendum]

**Description:** Although SCP-561 itself is unseen, evidence of animal remains in the area suggest that it has been in place since at least mid 2000 AD. SCP-561 has so far proven to be directly undetectable, producing no electromagnetic or gravitational anomalies. Due to this, SCP-561's exact area of effect in unknown. A rough guess as to its boundaries has been extrapolated from the appearance of its products. SCP-561 changes the reproductive results of nearly all living things within its radius, causing them to produce offspring from the time period just before earth's last ice age, the Pliocene epoch. This effect extends to plants and animals alike, including humans. It should be said that the area around SCP-561 does not seem that different from most other North American forested areas. The flora show slight alteration, while the area's fauna show a steady increase in alteration as time goes on. At this time any animal life conceived in the radius of SCP-561 has a fair chance of producing Pliocene-era offspring. 

Testing to see what modern-day-animals produce as offspring has yielded impressive, if sometimes unusual results. It would appear that evolutionary relationships are not preserved by the anomaly, as offspring may be on separate branches of a phylogenetic tree. The strongest predictor of the species of the offspring is morphological similarity to the parent. DNA testing has shown significant genetic differences between parents and altered offspring. It has proven difficult to obtain permission to utilize Foundation assets to obtain genetic samples directly from Pliocene-era life, testing with extant samples of DNA dating from the Pliocene era shows significant matching.

It appears, through the lack of emergence of alteration in cultured populations after nearly 50,000 generations, that prokaryotic life is unaltered by the anomaly.

Surprisingly, the ecology of the area has adapted well to the appearance of precursor species. This may be a result of the morphological selection displayed by the anomaly, or may be otherwise unrelated. It is not uncommon to see deer the size of moose with large antler racks or saber-toothed cats hunting. Photographs from the area of SCP-561 reveal cougars nursing their own cubs alongside smilodon cubs from the same litter, and similar occurrences. Avian species do not seem to experience obvious alteration.

Animal husbandry of precursor species has been approved. [See Addendum]

**Addendum:**
[GROUP N]
In the area of SCP-561 is a small, abandoned town. The human population there was moved after a number of neanderthal births occurred, and was covered up as a rash of small mutations caused by a tainted water supply. These children are being observed in their various locations and have been deemed as safe, as no more than some odd physical traits sets them apart from their human peers. These kids are known as [Group N].

**Offspring Produced Via Testing**
Cougars, Lions, Tigers, and other large cats have produced various species of Sabre-toothed cats, including those more closely related to marsupials and mustelids. Sabre-toothed cats may be trained to the same extent other large cats can, but should be treated always like dangerous animals, as with any Tiger or Lion.

Deer, Elk, Horses, and Moose have produced several extinct species of deer and elk, some quite impressive in size and antler width and configuration.

Black, Grizzly, and Polar Bears have produced several species of bear, including a very large cave-bear, and a strange running-bear with more wolflike configuration.

Wolves have produced larger, more aggressive Dire Wolves. Several of these escaped, and have been spotted across Canada. Fortunately they are similar enough to normal wolves that they require no further containment effort. Dire Wolves may be domesticated to the same extent as wild wolves, and may prove to make useful guard dogs.

Coyotes, Foxes, and Domesticated Dogs all produce similar results, as well as smaller canid creatures. Most smaller canids have been trained to some degree, but do not have the same pack instincts as their parents.

Domesticated Cats produce a creature similar to their typical form, identified as an ancient cat breed. They act similarly to feral cats.

Small Pony breeds and Donkeys have produced primitive equines, some relatively small in size and considered "cripplingly adorable". Some of these may be partially domesticated.

Elephants have produced, much to a certain Dr. Rights' thrill, mammoths and mastodons. Mammoths and mastodons both seem quite intelligent, and my be trained in a fashion similar to modern-day elephants. Dr. Rights has also implicated that the Mammoths' massive size and enhanced durability could make them useful as a "living tank".

Rhinoceros brought into the are have produced [[DATA EXPUNGED]]
**Note:** //"What do you mean we can't weaponize them? That would be AWESOME!"// - Dr. Rights

Dolphins and other modern-day cetaceans have produced their counterparts. The most common example of this is Squalodon, although hopes are high to bring in a large cetacean to try and chance perhaps something similar to a Basilosaurus.

An ostrich bought into the area laid an egg that did not hatch, but was discovered to contain the fetus of an unidentified species of Terror Bird.
