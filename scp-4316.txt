SCP-4316.
[[/div]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** Camp Kanab has been purchased by the Foundation. Any testing is to be scheduled through SCP-4316's Head Researcher, Doctor Harlan.

[[include :scp-sandbox-3:image-zoom name=map.png |caption=A map of Camp Kanab. SCP-4316 is denoted in red. |width=300px|align=right]]

**Description:** SCP-4316 is a bonfire located in Camp Kanab, a summer camp in West Virginia. State records note the land was purchased and the camp constructed in 1955. It operated as a camping retreat until 1977, at which point records end. The camp contains 7 cabins and an assortment of recreational structures, such as a canoe pier, bonfire pit, and dining hall.

SCP-4316's anomalous effects initiate if it is set aflame. It produces large amounts of an unknown gaseous substance (henceforth referred to as SCP-4316-A),  which gathers in a fog, hovering close to the ground. Any individuals who inhale SCP-4316-A will enter a fugue state that will persist for 12 to 16 hours. There does not appear to be an upper limit to how much SCP-4316-A can be produced by SCP-4316; it extinguishes itself near sunrise, leaving the wood uncharred.

[[include :scp-sandbox-3:image-zoom name=bonfire2.png |caption=SCP-4316.|width=300px|align=right]]

SCP-4316-A forms humanoid shapes as it spreads across Camp Kanab. These forms are largely indistinct and lack detailed features, but general characteristics such as sex, height, and clothing are distinguishable. Anywhere from 6 to 13 unique formations have been observed in a single event.

Any individuals who have inhaled SCP-4316-A engage in activity with formations for the remainder of the night. This can range from simply lying on the ground near SCP-4316 to swimming in the nearby Lake Kanab. The formations will not vocalize at any point.

Approximately one hour before sunrise, SCP-4316-A begins to condense into a thin dew on all surfaces. Formations become slow and lethargic in activity, before dissipating entirely. Affected individuals slowly regain awareness of their surroundings, with vivid false memories of the events of the previous night.

**Addendum SCP-4316.01:** The following test was performed using a D-Class personnel who had attended a Camp Canadensis between the ages of 13 and 16.

**[21:00]** - SCP-4316 is lit. D-4314 inhales SCP-4316-A. No vocalizations from D-4314.

**[21:34]** - D-4314 leaves SCP-4316 and enters one of the cabins. There are five SCP-4316-A humanoids standing next to different bunk beds. D-4314 vocalizes upon entry.

**D-4314:** That's where you've been! C'mon, the counselors are all at the bonfire.

//Humanoids move toward the cabin exit.//

**D-4314:** You guys got the stuff from Jared's stash?

//The humanoids pause.//

**D-4314:** Fantastic. Alright, let's go.

**[21:35]** D-4314 leads the 5 humanoids down a trail that circles Lake Pagota. Other humanoids can be seen standing motionlessly around SCP-4316. D-4314 passes by a pair of humanoids standing close to each other behind one of the cabins en route to the trail.

**D-4314:** Woo hoo! You get 'er Stan!

**[22:04]** D-4314 stops leading the group, and takes a seat at a ledge next to Lake Pagota. The humanoids form a circle that includes D-4314, but do not sit down. D-4314 does not appear to notice that they have remained standing, and look only at their knees.

**D-4314:** Rachel, pass me a cold one will you?

//No one moves.//

**D-4314:** Thanks. Honestly, I'm surprised the counselors didn't hide these better after we did this last year.

//Pause.//

**D-4314:** But I wasn't the one who got caught now, was I?

//D-4314 laughs.//

**D-4314:** Speaking of Cindy, where is she?

//Pause.//

**D-4314:** Fair point, fair point. I swear she just needs to set her watch forward like an hour.

//Pause.//

**D-4314:** No, no. You guys go ahead.

//Pause.//

**D-4314:** I just don't feel like swimming right now, ok?

//Pause.//

**D-4314:** I'm not a— ok fine. Fine I'll go.

//D-4314 strips down to his underwear and wades into the lake. The other humanoids hover overtop of the lake.//

**D-4314:** Oh you son of a bitch!

//D-4314 splashes at the humanoids.//

**D-4314:** Next year we have to go up even further. I hear there's a waterfall we can jump off.

//Pause.//

**D-4314:** Well, I haven't been there before.

//Pause.//

**D-4314:** Cindy told me about it.

//The humanoids drift toward the shore.//

**D-4314:** Wait, what did I say? Guys?

//D-4314 begins to wade back to shore.//

**D-4314:** It hasn't even been that long! Jared won't start looking for another hour at least!

//D-4314 is pulled underwater.//

**[22:27]** D-4314 is retrieved from the lake by observing personnel. Five strands of green algae were wrapped around D-4314's ankle. A bracelet with "C+T"[[footnote]] D-4314's first name was Tyler[[/footnote]] written on it was found entangled with the strands.

**Addendum SCP-4316.02:** After D-4314's full recovery, he was interviewed by Dr. Travis.

[[div style="display: inline-block; border:solid 2px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px"]]
**INTERVIEWER:** Dr. Adam Travis

**SUBJECT:** D-4314

----

**TRAVIS:** How you holding up?

**D-4314:** G-good.

**TRAVIS:** You sure? We can reschedule if you don't feel so go-

**D-4314:** I'm fine. Let's get this over with.

**TRAVIS:** Okay, um, what do you remember from last night?

**D-4314:** I lit the bonfire and saw faces. Friends from high school and my old stomping grounds.

**TRAVIS:** Anyone in particular? Any names?

**D-4314:** Cindy Crenshaw. She was there. I remember her from summer camp. Vividly.

**TRAVIS:** What did you do with her?

**D-4314:** We... we hung around on the pier about. Just happy to be there.

**TRAVIS:** I se-

**D-4314:** She... I can't even remember what happened to her.

**TRAVIS:** Huh? What're you talking about?

**D-4314:** She's gone. She was gone already. And I can't even remember how.

**TRAVIS:** Do you have any memories of Crenshaw from outside the summer camp?

**D-4314:** Of course I do! We sent letters back and forth. Like pen pals.

**TRAVIS:** What did the letters say?

**D-4314:** I don't remember exactly. It was decades ago. I know it was just like, things about our lives. Planning what we'd do at camp next summer. 

**TRAVIS:** Do you remember any details at all from her letters?

**D-4314:** I mean, I should.

**TRAVIS:** Did she mention any siblings? Any school troubles? Maybe a squabble with a friend?

**D-4314:** I... I don't know.

**TRAVIS:** Do you know where we could find those letters?

**D-4314:** I don't know.

**TRAVIS:** Are you sure those letters are even real?

**D-4314:** I don't— no. I know. There's not real. They can't be. They better not be.

**TRAVIS:** Why shouldn't they?

**D-4314:** Because Cindy Crenshaw isn't real. Right?

**TRAVIS:** Ok, good. We looked into records from your camp, and there was no indication that a "Cindy" ever attended at the same time as you.

**D-4314:** Right. Yeah, that's right.

**TRAVIS:** You should probably take a break.

**D-4314:** ... but I even remember paying for stamps...

**TRAVIS:** I'm gonna come back in an hour or two -- you rest up, alright? I'm gonna call a doctor to take your blood pressure.

When I took on the 4316 project, I figured that it was chance that I'd gotten an anomaly so familiar to me. Maybe it was, but I'm not so sure. I convinced myself that this was my past coming back to torture me. 

I remember sneaking out of my cabin at midnight through the busted screen door window. My bunkmates were all sound asleep by then -- they had a full day of hiking through the Tennessee forests to look forward to when they woke up. I had other plans. I wriggled out of the window, and fell on my ass on the dirt outside our cabin. I booked it to the pier that jutted out into the lake from the small beach on camp property, not wanting to be late.

Sarah was waiting there for me. We were seventeen, stupid, and enamored with each other. We'd spent just about the whole summer pretending not to notice each other during the day and then savoring the stolen moments with each other under the moonlight. Sometimes we'd talk, other times just lie on the pier and just hold hands. 

I remember this night in particular because it was the first time we went swimming. We both slipped in the water and splashed each other, knowing full well we were in danger of getting caught. She was about to toss a handful of lake water in my face when her foot slipped and she slammed backward. I caught her, but not before she got a noseful of dirty water. We laughed it off and crawled back ashore. 

A week or two later, I had to leave camp. There were still a few weeks before summer "ended", but my grandfather had come down with hypothermia. It was more than likely he wouldn't make it, and my parents wanted to be there for him. I had to say goodbye to Sarah, but I kissed her head and promised I'd be back.

She slipped again while I sat in a hospital room hundreds of miles away. Apparently her head hit the pier as she fell, and she never even woke up before her lungs filled with water. I should've been there to save her, but I wasn't. [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2316|She drowned in the lake]]], and my promise lay unfulfilled -- the camp shut down later [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/remembrance|that year]]].

A 911 call received at 12:47 P.M from Camp Kanab counselor Thomas Briggs reported a female teenager had fallen in the lake and drowned. Officers Hardy and Thompson were dispatched and arrived at 1:02 P.M.

Victim was ID'd as seventeen year old Sarah Crenshaw, a student of nearby [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/remembrance|Kirk Longwood High]]]. Several witnesses reported having seen her swimming with her boyfriend, Joseph Harlan, minutes before her disappearance. Several minutes later, Harlan waded ashore screaming that Crenshaw had drowned. No trace of Crenshaw could be found, and Joseph was discovered by officers in a state of shock. He reported that they had been swimming in Lake Kanab when Crenshaw suddenly turned and swam farther into the center of the pool. As Crenshaw was a stronger swimmer, Harlan was unable to catch up to her and she suddenly disappeared under a wave. At this point, Harlan returned to shore.  

Despite an extended search, no body could be located. Search was called off after 8 hours, and Harlan was suspected of foul play and taken in for questioning. Officers determined that it was unlikely Harlan killed Crenshaw and far more likely that Crenshaw had simply overestimated her skill and drowned under a wave. This was substantiated by [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2316|several reports of persons having gone missing in the Lake Kanab area]]] over several years.

Dr. Harlan has been removed from the 4316 project for the foreseeable future.
