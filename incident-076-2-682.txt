**ATTENTION: REPORT 076-2/682 IS FOR REVIEW BY CLASS-4 PERSONELL ONLY**

**Incident:** 076-2/682

**SCP involved:** [[[SCP-682]]], [[[SCP-076]]]-2

**Personnel involved:** Dr. Gears, Prof. Kain Pathos Crow, Generals ████████████ and ████, Mobile Task Force Omega-7 (aka "Pandora's Box")

**Date:** ██████████

**Location:** ██████, Northern Canada

**Description:** Omega-7 dispatched after reports of [[[SCP-682]]] being sighted in the area. Dr. Gears, Prof. Kain Pathos Crow, Generals ████████████ and ████ temporarily attached to supervise and observe, over objection by [[[SCP-076]]]-2. Contact made three hours after initial deployment.

After several hours of searching, SCP-682 is eventually found in ██████, near ████, having killed the civilian population there.

SCP-076 stopped Omega-7 from firing upon 682, then approached the subject. The pair are seen to converse for several minutes, with SCP-076 constantly looking back at the main group, and gradually becoming more and more agitated as the conversation goes on.

SCP-076 attacked SCP-682 with a bladed weapon.  SCP-682 disarmed and attacked SCP-076 with it's claws, suffering massive damage.  SCP-076 re-engaged SCP-682 after recovering from the initial assault.  Combat proceeded quickly, both SCP suffering and dealing enormous amounts of damage. SCP-682 suffering the most damage to date, with damage or removal of over 93% of it's body.  SCP-076 produces more weapons in this single event then the total number recorded since containment.

SCP-682 was incapacitated, SCP-076 preparing to “finish it off”, when the Anomaly occurred.  Sensors and monitoring equipment measure a enormous burst of electromagnetic energy, radiation, and wildly varied temperature readings.  Site Command received reports from Central Monitoring of a sudden alteration in space-time, localized around SCP-682.  Analysis have show this event to be consistent with both the sudden appearance and disappearance of a black hole, or the theoretical event of a sudden hole forming between our dimension and another.

Serious questions have been raised in light of the Anomaly, and the repulsed reaction SCP-682 has to most organic life.  It is currently theorized that SCP-682 is not “alive” in our sense of the word, or possibly is extra-dimensional in origin.  

SCP-682 and SCP-076 both incapacitated due to physical trauma.  SCP-682 moved to temporary containment.  Remains of SCP-076 and combat area firebombed from the air.  Missile test misfile story issued.

//Notes:  I am telling you, it's not actually here!  I think SCP-076 is the same way.  It's like poking your finger into a balloon:  you're inside it, but still outside of it.  They are “projecting” into our reality, and causing all kinds of problems when out reality tries to comprehend them.  It's like in programming, when you request a pixel that isn't there, makes the whole system go haywire!  -Dr. █████████//
