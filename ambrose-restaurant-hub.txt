The Ambrose Restaurant is a chain restaurant found in almost every extradimensional port of call, from the bustle and rain of Three Portlands to the high tech high-streets of Eurtec. We have locations around the world, though they're a little more difficult to find. Our ethos is to provide a remarkable culinary experience for a very reasonable price, all without compromising on taste, texture or customer satisfaction.

You can be sure that you will receive the best possible dishes when you arrive at our restaurant, and the strange and peculiar will be present in every bite, sip, or slurp. We here at Ambrose use all sorts of experimental techniques, ingredients, and tools to ensure your dining experience will be unlike any other.

//"The world is a strange and wondrous place, and anyone who's visited Three Portland's Jurassic Quarter will know that it's not the most friendly either. I invite you to let Ambrose be a safe harbour for you to enjoy the unusual delights of the universe without the horror, without the strife, without needing to concern yourself with anything beyond what you order.//

//"If you ever see our sign, no matter who you are, you have my word that you'll find something to suit your tastes."//

//"Our objective as a business is to provide excellent dining to all parts of the anomalous community. We shall continue to create establishments in locations where this would prove to be financially sustainable, and seek out new talent to help develop new and interesting recipes for our kitchens."//

The Ambrose Restaurant is a proud partner of [[[Oh, I Wouldn't Worry About Flaky-Os |The Circus of the Disquieting]]], with whom we have a standing order to purchase the absolutely delicious Midnight Cotton Candy, and through whom we have established a supply route for kraken egg caviar.

We also maintain positive relations with [[['Phoenix à La Mode' |Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP]]], and provide culinary expertise where required. In return, we get discounts on certain supplies, and a steady supply of Siberian Firebird.

As any respectable company should, we attempt to keep positive relationships with everyone we can. This isn't always possible, however, as the Foundation, Global Occult Coalition and more are rather keen on seeing us out of business. If you're currently in possession of atypical edibles (and aren't working for the buzzkills we just mentioned), then we'd love for you to get in touch.

When it comes to writing in the 'character' of the Ambrose Restaurant, try to be as lighthearted as you can without devolving into nonsense. That doesn't mean you shouldn't try to explore serious themes, far from it, just remember that Ambrose is far away from the doom and gloom of other parts of the Foundationverse.

One thing you should be keeping in mind with Ambrose is that they are, at the end of the day, a restaurant. Focus on the people, but also focus on the food. Don't ever make it seem like a place that a customer wouldn't want to sit down and enjoy a nice meal in. Unless you're re-imagining it, of course.

When it comes to setting, the Ambrose Restaurant is far behind the veil, steeped up to the eyeballs in the anomalous. They're frequent collaborators with other anomalous groups of interest, and are always looking for new and stranger ways of making a meal of it. As for the timeline, there's currently no fixed dates, however we know that they formed as a group some time in the last decade or so. From there, they set up with suppliers, and operated normally until the Foundation discovered them during the events of Dining Out, and began to track and isolate their baseline reality establishments.

Mobile Task Force Lambda-14 ("One Star Reviewers") is a task force which specialises in retail-oriented locations and anomalies, be they singular restaurants or entire shopping districts displaying anomalous properties.

Since their initial investigation of an Ambrose restaurant, MTF Lambda-14 has concentrated on dealing with this specific group, in whatever form they might take.

Lambda-14 is comprised of two containment teams, fifty mobile agents, ten thaumaturgy specialists, and twenty anomalous art specialists. They are based out of containment Site-34 in Southern California, though their nature as an MTF means that they don't stay there for very long.

**Known Bases of Operations:**
* Portlands
