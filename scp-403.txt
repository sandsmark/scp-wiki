**Item #:** SCP-403

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** For security reasons, SCP-403 will be sealed in a reinforced steel safe with a combination known only by Dr. ████ ███████. The safe will remain under surveillance by 2 armed guards at all times.

**Description:** SCP-403 is a common looking lighter that was discovered by a Class-D personnel in a cafeteria at Site ██. It is not currently known how SCP-403 arrived at Site ██. SCP-403 seems to be immune to its own effects, but testing has demonstrated that external force could potentially damage SCP-403 if properly applied. When lit, SCP-403 produces an ordinary flame. However, upon repeated ignitions, the flame produced by SCP-403 becomes larger and more violent in nature, increasing approximately tenfold per repeat ignition. A Class-D personnel tried to light SCP-403 a third time, which resulted in a powerful deflagration, destroying almost everything in a 50 meter radius, but the Class-D individual remained (to our surprise) totally unharmed.

The resources used by SCP-403 to produce the detonations are not known as of yet, if it uses any. Considering the volume of energy SCP-403 outputs, it should currently be treated as if using a potentially inexhaustible power supply. Tests are undergoing to determine the nature of SCP-403's fuel source.

After multiple studies, we have come to the conclusion that SCP-403 is apparently growing in power each time it is lit, around 11 to 12 times the power of the preceding detonation. Radio-imaging has shown the formation of a small magnetic field around the lighter, which is hypothesized by researchers to be be the cause of immunity in individuals using SCP-403 to its effects.


**Addendum-A1:** SCP-403 seems to be on a 24 hour cool down cycle. If it is not lit for one full day, the effects will return to the basic flame mentioned in the first ignition.

This discovery permits further testing to calculate the potential value of SCP-403.


**Addendum-A2:** Calculations of SCP-403's destructive potential have been made; a fourth ignition would cause a detonation equivalent to approximately 10 tons of TNT.

Asked authorization to conduct further testing. Authorization pending as of ██/██/████.
   
**Addendum-B1** X-ray engineering shows that the compartment in SCP-403 which is supposed to contain the fuel is empty; no traces of any combustible compound have been found. This concurs with previous hypotheses regarding the nature of SCP-403's fuel source- that it is almost certainly extra dimensional in nature, and potentially unlimited.


**Addendum-B2** Authorization for further testing still pending, we are still examining SCP-403 by various means to determine how it produces such deflagrations with no notable power source. Researchers currently have no substantiated hypotheses on the nature of SCP-403's power source, and all currently proposed avenues of research require the approval of more resources from Site ██ Research.

██/██/████: Further experimentation authorized by Site ██ Head of Research, Dr. ████ ███████.

**Addendum-A3** Continued experimentation has been authorized for SCP-403, a designated safe detonation area has been provided for testing. After the third ignition, a Class-D personnel attempted the fourth lighting, which caused an explosion that appeared to be a thermonuclear blast, far exceeding any calculations made. Evaluation of the explosion has demonstrated that the equivalent of 10 Mt of TNT was detonated by SCP-403, far exceeding most strategic nuclear weapons. No lasting effects from the explosion were observed, apart from the devastation wreaked by the initial blast. The Class-D personnel used in this experiment is in perfect health.


**Addendum-A4** In the light of the previous events regarding the studies on SCP-403, all further tests have been suspended due to the extreme danger in manipulating such a device. As it seems the power of SCP-403 increases exponentially, a fifth ignition could result in a deflagration roughly equivalent to a massive matter/antimatter reaction. A blast of this magnitude would be near-impossible to conceal, and could devastate vast portions of the continent. Due to the extreme danger posed by misuse, the probable extra dimensionality of its fuel source, and relative ease of containment, SCP-403 will be listed as a Class Euclid object.
