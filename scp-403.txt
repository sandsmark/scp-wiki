    **Item #: SCP-403**

    **Object Class:** Euclid

    **Special Containment Procedures:** There are no special containment procedures needed for SCP-403, still for security reasons it will be sealed in a reinforced steel safe with a combination known only by Dr. ████ ███████ , and under surveillance of 2 armed guards at all time.


    **Description:** SCP-403 is a common looking lighter, that was discovered by a Class-D personnel in a cafeteria at site ██. It is not known how or who introduced such a device in our own facility. SCP-403 seems to be indestructible to its own effects, but further tests have shown that external harm could be done with proper means. SCP-403 is a simple lighter that, once lit provides a small flame, the second time it is lit the flame grows tenfold and looks almost like a flame thrower.
A class-D personnel tried to lit SCP-403 a third time, which resulted in a powerful deflagration, destroying almost everything in a 50 meters radius, Class-D remained (to our surprise) totally unharmed.

The ressources used by SCP-403 to produce the detonations are not known as of yet, if it uses any. Apparently SCP-403 does not seem to have any limit, though tests must be conducted to confirm this statement.

After multiple studies, we have come to the conclusion that SCP-403 is apparently growing in power each time it is lit, around 11 to 12 times the power of the preceding detonation, Radio-imaging has shown the formation of a small magnetic field around the lighter, that could be the reason why people using SCP-403 remains unharmed by its effects.


    **Addendum-A1** SCP-403 seems to be on a 24h cooldown cycle. If it is not lit for one full day, the effects will return to the basic flame mentionned in the first lit.
This will allow further testings to calculate the possibilities of SCP-403.


    **Addendum-A2** Calculations of SCP-403 destructive potential have been made, a fourth lit would cause a detonation of approximatively 10Tons of TNT.
Asked authorization to conduct further testing. Authorization Pending.


    **Addendum-B1** X-ray Engineering shows that the compartment in SCP-403 supposed to contain the gas is empty, no traces of any combustible have been found, it concurs on the previous statement, SCP-403 is not limited in power-supply, or the power-source is yet to be discovered.


    **Addendum-B2** Authorization for futher testing still pending, we are still looking at SCP-403 by various means to determine how it produces such deflagrations with no notable power source. Seriously, we have no idea how this device works, we will need direct testing to go further in studying SCP-403.


    **Addendum-A3** Testing authorized for SCP-403, a Ground zero has been provided for safe testing. After third lit, Class-D personnel attempted the fourth try,
which caused what appeared to be a thermonuclear explosion, far exceeding any calculations made. Evaluation of the explosion has put the fourth lit on the scale of a 10Megaton A-bomb. there were no traces of any radiations though. Class-D personnel is in perfect health.


    **Addendum-A4** In the light of the previous events regarding the studies on SCP-403, all further tests have been cancelled due to extreme danger in manipulating such a device. As it seems the power of SCP-403 is exponential, a fifth lit could result in a deflagration that only massive matter/antimatter reaction could par, such power would lead to uncanny and unpredictable destruction far beyond any man-made weapons.
SCP-403 will be classified as Euclid Object.
