**Location:** Piedmont, Missouri, SCP Foundation secure facility designation Site-44

**Extradimensional Reality Designation:** 444-P0D-5CP

**Site Purpose:** Site-44 is an experimental containment facility that solely attempts to implement the most advanced technologies, techniques, and anomalies that are at the Foundation's disposal in order to develop more reliable containment procedures for SCPs. The procedures tested at this site are reserved for those SCPs that the Foundation historically has had difficulty in keeping contained. Knowledge of this facility is restricted to security clearance 05 and above for personnel outside of Site-44 due to the danger of testing novel containment procedures and the potential loss of some of the Foundation's most advanced resources. Typically, only one SCP's containment will be tested at a time.

**Incident Description:** A containment breach occurred at Site-44 on the evening of September 5th, 2017. The actions of several Persons of Interest and Site Personnel on this evening set the stage for many extraordinary events to occur within Site-44 and the Foundation as a whole. Outlined below is a brief description of the involved PoI's as well as a developing audio log of their actions and activities.[[footnote]]This is a Table Top RPG Podcast running the game system called [*https://www.evilhat.com/home/monster-of-the-week/ Monster of The Week][[/footnote]]
