> Everyone agrees, fire was stolen from the gods. Symbolically, literally, something in between? It doesn't matter. Did humans do it? One of their own? Just as unimportant. It was stolen, and the gods wanted it back. They lashed out in the way gods always do, with spiteful light and ferocious dark. Their ultimatums promised destruction, and their faithful's pleas went unanswered.
> 
> This isn't a story about them.
> 
> Of course, humans readied themselves for war. Clad in iron beliefs, armed with terrible symbols, they stormed the high places and buried the low places. The divine kingdoms were razed, and the divinities themselves drawn and quartered. The gods were buried under salt flats, cast into seas, and lost in great forests. In the future, these fragments would come to cause no end of suffering to mankind.
> 
> This isn't a story about any of them either.
> 
> Far beyond that time, the Foundation has won a second war against the gods. It has unearthed, dredged, and scoured for their lost pieces, then locked them all away. It has gorged and grown vast, strong, and unyielding. It has made clear to its enemies that a reckoning will soon be had for them as well. Most of all, it has wrought new thrones for its masters.
> 
> This is a story about one of those masters, almost.
> 
> Even when you have the power to call down vicious lights and raise vast darknesses, it turns out that a pair of minions can be awfully useful to have around.

"You can't kick me out just for this!"

"Just for this?" asked Coxswain, deadly calm.

"Yeah, you know..." said Wren. The phantom sensation of a pulled trigger ached in her finger as she spoke, and ghostly warmth from a vast fire rushed against her. She could feel herself prying out one of her teeth, feel herself walking through a field of bleeding soldiers, feel herself smiling in the face of a hundred more hale ones. "For forgetting."

"Overseer?" she asked.

"Yes, I’m still here. It's unfortunate, but I believe we're dealing with a powerful idiot."

"Sorry?"

"You'll have to kill them, of course. Whoever edited this copy, and whoever was trying to sell it. Bring me their heads, as much of them as you can."

"Yes, Overseer. And the books? If there are more?"

"Burn them all."

Dhole sat in the crook of a tree in some unknown place, surrounded by a vast field of strange plants, overwhelmed by the calls of unseen animals, and utterly oppressed by the alien sky. Clear, blue, and ominous, it hung far too low for her liking. It revealed the terrible face of this place’s sun with too much honesty, and bared everything to the attentive stars beyond. It was not a familiar place, and certainly not a good one.

Egret grimaced, an expression that was still more pleasant than her smile. "There's been some... lingering contamination from the incident in China. It propagated through a section of childhood memory storage. As you saw, the grade twos ordered a purge."

"Isn't that serious?"

"It won't impact our performance, ma'am."

"I meant, aren't those memories important to you?"

"It won't impact our performance, ma'am."

"░▒▓▒░" shouted the woman. Egret reached for the pistol holstered under one her arm, and found it missing. The gnats in her head buzzed loudly. The train stopped in a dim night, lit by furious stars and surrounded by the thundering beat of artillery fire. "░▒▓▓▒▒▓▒▓▒░" Egret reached for her pocket knife, and found that missing too. The gnats howled. Behind her, the footsteps came quicker and closer. "▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓"

A muffled explosion sounded in the distance. The floor shook. Emergency lights flickered. Hidden speakers crackled. Egret smiled to herself as another one of her surprises went off. It was an oozing, wretched expression, she knew that much, but it was hers all the same. She ran the tip of her tongue over the teeth that the Overseer gave her years ago, still sharp as ever, and waited. Evacuation maps flashed on the long walls in jittering light. A droning automated voice announced that the perimeter had been breached. She had no intention of leaving.

"High and bright before you," said the Exarch. His white robes billowed as he stepped closer, golden thread sparkling in the morning light. "High and bright indeed. The prize head of a most capable herd, sheared and shamed. Sheared, shamed, alone. Where is your brother lamb? Where are the prizes promised to me?"

Dhole picked at the bandages lining her fingers. "Dead. Gone. My apologies are unadorned."

She only paused the work long enough to stuff an energy bar into her mouth and tie her black hair back. It had become shaggy and matted in recent months, but she was too busy to cut it. Sweat gathered on her forehead, sliding down through thick eyebrows before dripping to the floor. Busy. Numb. That's what she aspired to.

**Authorial Statement:**

[[collapsible show="SHOW SUMMARY" hide="HIDE SUMMARY"]]
Maim the Sky, Slay the Sun is a mostly-completed, loose series of tales set in a near-future where the Foundation has all but secured dominance over the world. The worst anomalies have been contained, its worst foes have been brought low, and all it has left to fear is itself. These tales focus on events surrounding Overseer-6 and two of her more personal minions, Egret and Dhole. The stories are broadly comprised of violence, magic, crummy emotions, and more violence, and they touch on themes of memory, loyalty, and people who just can't quite smile genuinely.
