**Item #:** SCP-2996

**Object Class:** Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2996 is to be contained within a standard Incorporeal Entity Vacuum Chamber at Site 81. This chamber is to be fitted with 4 Non-Physical Displacement Neutralizers (nPDN). SCP-2996 may be allowed to request certain items for entertainment.

Once weekly, SCP-2996 must undergo a routine psychological evaluation with an on-site psychologist in order to properly evaluate SCP-2996's mental state. Due to current concerns about the state of SCP-2996's mental health, the appropriate use of Class-H Electrostatic Amnestic Treatment has been approved, if necessary. 

**Updated Containment Procedues:** Due to the effective use of the nPDNs, it is possible to now perform physical examinations of SCP-2996. These exams must be performed once weekly as part of an ongoing effort to collect information regarding the physical nature of incorporeal entities.

**Description:** SCP-2996 is a Class II Incorporeal Humanoid Entity, initially discovered in an abandoned home in Nashville, Indiana. SCP-2996 appears to be a young human female of European descent with black hair and blue eyes, and a number of visible wounds across the entire body, including a major gunshot wound to the right eye. Although SCP-2996 is by default an incorporeal entity, the use of nPDN devices has allowed Foundation personnel to "anchor" SCP-2996 into a physical state during examinations. It is currently hypothesized that the use of these devices, along with other aspects of containment, is the source of SCP-2996's deteriorating mental/emotional state.

SCP-2996 claims to be Emily Nash, the subject of a murder in Nashville, Indiana, in 1929. Data recovered from various sources have supported the claim that an Emily Nash was found dead in her home, however, the listed cause of death was suicide. During interviews, SCP-2996 has rejected any evidence that supports suicide, and has vehemently remarked on several occasions that its killer was a spurned lover, one James Franklin. The existence of this individual in Nashville in 1929 has not been verified, however, efforts to collect additional information are ongoing.

**Psychiatric Evaluation Results:** There is concern, to me, about the state of SCP-2996's emotional health. The object clearly is at odds with evidence presented to it, as well as its current state of containment. Throughout interviews, it has become clear that SCP-2996 believed that it lingers in this world in order to enact revenge upon its killer, and that it was a powerful, unbound spirit. This, of course, is in direct conflict with both information that we have provided to SCP-2996 in regards to its death, as well as its containment within Site 81. SCP-2996, then, is no longer certain about a number of things, which has led to increased anxiety in the subject, as well as depression and suicidal thoughts. Given the nature of its being, the latter is of utmost concern.

**Dr. Rudolph:** Good afternoon, SCP-2996, and welcome to S-

//Dr. Rudolph is abruptly cut off by the sound of SCP-2996 thrashing against its containment cell.//

**Dr. Rudolph:** I see. Well, my name is Dr. Rudolph, and I'm going to be handling your entry evaluat-

**SCP-2996:** ...you are the slime of this wretched earth just like him and just like him I will find your heart through your throat and pull the life out of you...

**Dr. Rudolph:** (//Motions to mute speakers//) Right, SCP-2996, this will be much easier for both of us if you're willing to comply with these examinations. Unfortunately, I'm not sure how much we're going to be able to accomplish today, so let's just postpone this until you're feeling a little better.

**[BEGIN LOG]**

**Dr. Rudolph:** Good morning, SCP-2996. Are you feeling up to talking today?

**SCP-2996:** (//SCP-2996 is huddled in the corner of its containment cell//) You speak with vermin tongues that lick your vermin lips and you think I would want to speak to you? (//SCP-2996 spits towards the observation deck//)

**Dr. Rudolph:** I understand your frustration, SCP-2996, but you really must learn to cooperate with us here. Nobody wants to harm you, we just want to talk.

**SCP-2996:** (//Laughs//) I am an unbound spirit of torment, you mortal wraith. I will not have words with you. I will not stop until I can squeeze the life out of his writhing throat.

**Dr. Rudolph:** SCP-2996, we've been over this before. The evidence we've gathered makes it clear that-

**SCP-2996:** He murdered me in cold blood! He swore on my damnation! Do not speak to me of your foul eviden- (//SCP-2996 lunges towards the observation deck, colliding with the glass. SCP-2996 appears shaken.//)

**Dr. Rudolph:** SCP-2996, I am willing to turn off our Neutralizers and allow you to return to your incorporeal form, but only if you will calm yourself and speak to me.

//SCP-2996 becomes violent, thrashing throughout its containment cell and beating the walls with various parts of its body. Security personnel enter the cell and sedate SCP-2996. Dr. Rudolph calls an end to the interview.//

**Dr. Kidwell:** Good afternoon, SCP-2996. You wanted to speak to me?

**Dr. Kidwell:** Well, we're currently utilizing a couple of different devices, prima-

**SCP-2996:** I am an unbound spirit! I do not understand, I am a being of revenge, and... (//SCP-2996 trails off//)

**Dr. Kidwell:** Yes, well... we have machines that can hold entities like yourself in containment. We want to learn more about you, where you came from, how you function. 

**SCP-2996:** But... I am a spirit of hate, and-

**Dr. Kidwell:** ...and we contained you, SCP-2996. I am willing to make some allowances for you, but I really do need your help first.

//SCP-2996 is silent and no longer responds to questioning. Dr. Kidwell ends interview.//

**[BEGIN LOG]**

**Dr. Kidwell:** When we talked last, SCP-2996, you were telling me how you felt about your containment, yes?

**SCP-2996:** I just... I feel like I got so much hate in me. I got a thing inside that wants me to squeeze the life out of Jimmy Franklin, but... I seen the evidence, doc. I read the reports you gave me.

**Dr. Kidwell:** I understand how difficult this might be for you, SCP-2996. That's the purpose of our research, though. So we can try to offer you, and other entities like you, some sense of normalcy. 

**SCP-2996:** (//SCP-2996 is silent for a moment//) I just, I still feel that part of me that lived back in the house. I know it's still there. The part that hates, and... but it's confused. Confused and angry, and...

**Dr. Kidwell:** It's ok. We'll get some answers. You're scheduled for your initial physical examination soon. I really feel like that'll help us figure this all out, ok?

**SCP-2996:** I... alright.

[[include component:image-block name=girl.jpg|caption=SCP-2996 upon neutralization.]]

After a number of therapy sessions with Dr. Kidwell and additional counselors on the Site-81 staff, SCP-2996 became significantly less prone to violent outbursts. Through her treatment she was able to come to terms with the events surrounding and resulting in her death, and was able to move past them. 

On August 15th, 2012, SCP-2996 was given a final physiological examination, where it was determined that her anomalous qualities no longer existed. SCP-2996 was, by all accounts, a normal human girl.

As a result of this, on August 18th, 2012, SCP-2996 was determined to be "neutralized". A final round of amnestic treatment was prepared while Site-81 staff sent a request to Overwatch Command that the child, previously SCP-2996, be released to a family desiring to adopt a child. The request was written by Dr. Kidwell, notarized by Dr. Bishop (Site-81 Head of Research), and signed by Director Aktus.

On August 28th, 2012, the request was approved. The child, renamed Samantha Pendleton, was released to a Foundation front adoption agency after a round of amnestic treatment.
