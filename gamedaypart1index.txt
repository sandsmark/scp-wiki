Act 1: This act takes place over a period of 24 hours. A massive attack on a Foundation containment site has injured several key members of the SCP Foundation and caused multiple containment breaches. The theme for this act is SECURE: tell stories about the Foundation dealing with multiple containment breaches and responding to a major attack on one of their secure facilities.

> At 0811 hours on ██-██-████, multiple containment breaches occured at Humanoid Containment Site-17, caused by multiple explosive devices placed at critical points throughout the facility. One such device, placed in Conference Room 9b, resulted in death or injury to several key senior staff members, resulting in the loss of the top three levels of site leadership. This disruption of the chain of command resulted in a severe communications breakdown, preventing detonation of the on-site nuclear device as a final fail-safe (as well as making it difficult to contact other sites for help).
> 
> The situation was exacerbated by the unusually large number of artifacts in temporary containment at Site-17. Although normally serving as a minimum to moderate security facility for human and humanoid artifacts, an infestation of █████ ████ at Site-19 resulted in the temporary transfer of numerous non-humanoid artifacts of Safe/Euclid classification to Site-17 while decontamination took place.
> 
> The combination of these factors (disruption of command structure, loss of communications, physical damage from explosive devices, unusually large number of artifacts in containment) resulted in a Tempest Night scenario: multiple and severe containment breaches combined with the loss of the final nuclear fail-safe. The situation was further exacerbated at 0823 hours, when a number of unknown personnel from an unknown agency attacked the facility itself. . .
