> //Excerpt from official after-action report compiled by Dr. Alto Clef regarding Incident 234-900-Tempest Night.//
> 
> **0811 to 0823: Initial Contact**
> 
> At 0811 hours on ██-██-████, multiple containment breaches occured at Humanoid Containment Site-17, caused by multiple explosive devices placed at critical points throughout the facility. One such device, placed in Conference Room 9b, resulted in death or injury to several key senior staff members, resulting in the loss of the top three levels of site leadership. This disruption of the chain of command resulted in a severe communications breakdown, preventing detonation of the on-site nuclear device as a final fail-safe (as well as making it difficult to contact other sites for help).
> 
> The situation was exacerbated by the unusually large number of artifacts in temporary containment at Site-17. Although normally serving as a minimum to moderate security facility for human and humanoid artifacts, an infestation of █████ ████ at Site-19 resulted in the temporary transfer of numerous non-humanoid artifacts of Safe/Euclid classification to Site-17 while decontamination took place.
> 
> The combination of these factors (disruption of command structure, loss of communications, physical damage from explosive devices, unusually large number of artifacts in containment) resulted in a Tempest Night scenario: multiple and severe containment breaches combined with the loss of the final nuclear fail-safe. The situation was further exacerbated at 0823 hours, when a number of unknown personnel from an unknown agency attacked the facility itself. . .

> //Excerpt from Interview conducted by O5-█, regarding Dr. Edison’s involvement in Incident 234-900-Tempest Night-1.//
> 
> **O5-█:** Good evening, Dr. Edison.
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** Good evening, sir.
> 
> **O5-█:** Please, take a seat. I have a few questions to ask you.
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** …I’m not in trouble, am I?
> 
> **O5-█:** No, of course not. This simply standard procedure.
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** Oh. Okay then. That’s fine, I guess.
> 
> **O5-█:** Glad to hear it. Now, tell me, exactly where were you when the incident began?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** Well let’s see… I believe I was in the middle of feeding [[[SCP-391]]] when I heard the blast. Fearing for my safety, I fled to the nearest security station only to find that the security personnel inside had died prior to my arrival.
> 
> **O5-█:** Do you have any idea how they died?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** No idea, sir. Everyone had a big gash in the back of the head, but it looked like they didn’t have their weapons drawn or anything so I guess they didn’t fight back.
> 
> **O5-█:** Interesting. So what did you do?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** Well, I took one good look at the security monitors and quickly realized how [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] we all... um, I mean, that we were in the middle of a wide-scale Class-█ containment breach. I tried to activate the self-destruct sequence manually, but the detonation system was apparently too damaged to respond. So I sent a message over the intercom ordering all essential personnel to evacuate, and ordering all remaining security personnel to enter high alert. 
> 
> **O5-█:** And then what?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** Well, then I noticed that [[[SCP-353]]] (who had breached containment), was being escorted by a number of masked men towards section [REDACTED], where we were keeping all the biohazardous materials from Site 19. So I… um…
> 
> **O5-█:** Well? What did you do?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** I... went after them. Die Hard style.
> 
> **O5-█:** ...I beg your pardon?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** I mean I went after them. Alone. I ran around the site grabbing everything that looked even remotely useful, picked off the masked men one by one using my superior knowledge of Site-17, and squared off with SCP-353 in a climactic showdown inside of the decontamination chamber.
> 
> **O5-█:** …

> <Interview Begins>
> 
> **O5-█**: Where were you at the time of the explosions?
> 
> **Dr. Honey**: I was working with [[[SCP-737]]], sir. I'd come up with a new theory regarding its aversion to copper and -
> 
> **O5-█**: Fascinating, I'm sure, but hardly relevant.
> 
> **Dr. Honey**: No, sir. Well, I was knocked unconscious by the explosion, as the security footage //clearly// shows.
> 
> **O5-█**: Of course.
> 
> **Dr. Honey**: When I came to, 737 had gone. I was inside the observation chamber, so it hadn't seen me, but the guard...oh god. C-can I have a moment?
> 
> **O5-█**: I'm afraid I must ask you to continue, doctor.
> 
> **Dr. Honey**: That train had just tunneled right through his head. There was blood everywhere, and there was a suspiciously train-shaped hole in the wall.
> 
> **O5-█**: And how did you react to this?
> 
> **Dr. Honey**: I went after it, of course. I thought security would be busy with the explosion, so I grabbed a sheet of copper from the emergency locker and went looking. I thought the explosion was just a minor containment breach. I didn't think it was that bad.
> 
> **O5-█**: Understandable.
> 
> **Dr. Honey**: As I was saying, I walked out of SCP-737's containment area and into the neighboring hallway. I spotted it turning around a corner and followed. I was all ready to grab it, but...oh god, I really need a minute.
> 
> (**O5-█** sighs.)
> 
> **O5-█**: Of course. Take your time.

**Excerpt From Debriefing Interview Vang-2**
**Interviewer:** Agent ██████
**Subject:** Dr. Vang, Ph.D.
**Date:** █/██/20██

> **Agent ██████:** All right, where were you when the attack happened?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** I was asleep in MRI Lab Three, two floors up and about five doors down the hall from where the bombs were. I woke up when they went off, of course.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** What was your initial reaction?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** I just laid there a bit until the gunfire started, then I decided to report to the infirmary to get an amnesiac. You see, the SCP I was working on, some of the initial tests indicate that the symptoms include auditory hallucinations. I figured an amnesiac might fix it.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** I see. Carry on.
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** So, I was approaching an intersection in the hallway when I saw one of our security guards trading fire with someone I couldn't see. It dawned on me that it was real when the top half of his head got blown up.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** And then?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** I ran the other direction, hid in the closet, and hyperventilated for a while. When I calmed down, I ran back into the MRI lab to get my laptop.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** Why?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** Well, I fell asleep last night before I could log out, so there was a chance that someone could have gotten at the files who didn't have clearance. Anyways, when I got back, my laptop was gone, and so was one of the desktops.

> **Agent ██████:** Was any important data on those computers?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** I don't know about the desktop, but my laptop had some of my project files on it. Most of my projects involve abnormal memorability, so about ninety percent of it was just particularly catchy songs. In addition to that, there were nine variations of-
> 
> **Agent ██████:** Anything //important//?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** Sorry, sir. One of my USBs had a minute-long clip of [[[SCP-444]]], and a photo that makes you dizzy for a minute or so when you look at it. Those are the only things I can think of that would be of any real importance.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** Very good. Now, back to the MRI Lab. What was your course of action?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** Well, I realized that it would be a pretty bad thing if someone attacking the site had four forty-four, considering that a good portion of //our// work with it is weaponization. I looked around, and none of the rooms around me looked like anything was stolen from them, so I figured that whoever took my computer had a good idea of what they were looking for. I heard someone coming, so I ducked into the break room.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** What happened next?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** Whoever it was, they ran past, so I thought for a minute or so. I went to the fridge, grabbed a bottle of root beer, and broke it. To get a weapon, you know. Then, I stuffed my pockets with as many of the emergency ear plugs as I could find and went out to distribute them to our guys.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** Emergency ear plugs?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** It's the memetics department, sir. Standard issue.

**Excerpt from debriefing of Prof. Anders Bjornsen**

> **Security Agent █████ (SA):** Why were you in the transportation depot when the incident began?
> 
> **Prof. Anders Bjornsen (AB):** I had just been re-assigned to work on [[[SCP-272]]] from [[[SCP-200]]] and was waiting for the transfer team to arrive from SCP-272's previous containment site. I had only skimmed the briefing report, but apparently that site was being re-configured as a secure site for higher-threat-level SCPs.
> 
> **SA:** According to the logs, that security team delivered that SCP and left over 90 minutes before the incident.
> 
> **AB:** //sighs//
> 
> **AB:** Yes, but... well, I was talking with one of the security guards down there about some... personal matters and lost track of time. A good thing, too, or I would've been in my office when it collapsed.
> 
> **SA:** We'll come back to that. Did you notice anything unusual before the incident?
> 
> **AB:** I overheard one of the other guards mention that there had been a lot of SCP deliveries that day, but other than that, no. Well, until the klaxon went off, anyways. Then all the guards started scrambling for the doors into the rest of site.
> 
> **SA:** And what did you do?
> 
> **AB:** What any good boy scout would do: I decided to investigate the SCPs that nobody had yet bothered to pick up. Mighty careless of the researchers of those prospective projects to not collect them, but to my advantage. The first was, luckily, [[[SCP-262]]].
> 
> **SA:** And then?
> 
> **AB:** I went looking for guns.

**Audio Log from Hallway 34**
> **Agent Lombardi:** "Hold up. We got hostiles ahead."
> 
> **Agent Vance:** "Can we get around them?"
> 
> **Agent Lombardi:** "Maybe. But they've got weapons. We want weapons."
> 
> **Agent Vance:** "That's... I don't think--"
> 
> **Agent Lombardi:** "That's okay. I can think for us both. Now, see that door over there? That's quarantine for new skips, and I got an idea. I'm gonna distract them. Go in there, open the third door to the left, and then go flat on the ground."
> 
> **Agent Vance:** "Do what?"
> 
> **Agent Lombardi:** "Okay, go!"
> 
> //Video shows Agent Lombardi appearing in the hall near the insurgents. He appeared to yell something, then dived back behind cover. Agent Vance approached, using a vending machine for concealment, until running the remaining distance to the door. Several shots were fired, but neither Agent was injured. The insurgents ran through the door after Agent Vance. Approximately thirty seconds later, several pieces of the insurgents flew out of the room, striking the opposite wall. Anomaly VN-1520 (SCP number pending) exited through the door before killing several other insurgents. It then deactivated, falling to the floor. Agent Lombardi picked it up as Agent Vance emerged back into the hallway, visibly shaken.//
> 
> **Agent Lombardi:** "Good work, kid."
> 
> **Agent Vance:** "Oh Jesus."
> 
> **Agent Lombardi:** "Go grab a towel from the washroom. You've got some insurgent on you."
> 
> **Agent Vance:** "Oh Jesus!"
> 
> **Agent Lombardi:** "Goddammit! At least use the trashcan. All right, now... FUCK!"
> 
> **Agent Vance:** "What's... what's wrong?"
> 
> **Agent Lombardi:** "It broke the fucking guns."
