[[collapsible show="+ Show Information" hide="- Hide Information"]] 
Act 1: This act takes place over a period of 24 hours. A massive attack on a Foundation containment site has injured several key members of the SCP Foundation and caused multiple containment breaches. The theme for this act is SECURE: tell stories about the Foundation dealing with multiple containment breaches and responding to a major attack on one of their secure facilities.

> //Excerpt from official after-action report compiled by Dr. Alto Clef regarding Incident 234-900-Tempest Night.//
> 
> **0811 to 0823: Initial Contact**
> 
> At 0811 hours on ██-██-████, multiple containment breaches occured at Humanoid Containment Site-17, caused by multiple explosive devices placed at critical points throughout the facility. One such device, placed in Conference Room 9b, resulted in death or injury to several key senior staff members, resulting in the loss of the top three levels of site leadership. This disruption of the chain of command resulted in a severe communications breakdown, preventing detonation of the on-site nuclear device as a final fail-safe (as well as making it difficult to contact other sites for help).
> 
> The situation was exacerbated by the unusually large number of artifacts in temporary containment at Site-17. Although normally serving as a minimum to moderate security facility for human and humanoid artifacts, an infestation of █████ ████ at Site-19 resulted in the temporary transfer of numerous non-humanoid artifacts of Safe/Euclid classification to Site-17 while decontamination took place.
> 
> The combination of these factors (disruption of command structure, loss of communications, physical damage from explosive devices, unusually large number of artifacts in containment) resulted in a Tempest Night scenario: multiple and severe containment breaches combined with the loss of the final nuclear fail-safe. The situation was further exacerbated at 0823 hours, when a number of unknown personnel from an unknown agency attacked the facility itself. . .

**Surveillance Log 17-CR9b-█-██-████, 0805**

**<A. Adams:>** What am I even doing here? I'm not an administrator or a director. I'm not even senior staff. I shouldn't even be here. . .

**<A. Clef:>** Don't worry about it. Just inhale and cross your arms under your tits and no one will even give a shit.

**<A. Adams:>** This is harassment.

**<A. Clef:>** Yes, it is. Go get a mimosa or something. Mingle. Socialize. Hi, Dmitri.

**<D. Strelnikov:>** Doktor.

**<A. Clef:>** Whatcha drinking?

**<D. Strelnikov:>** Orange juice. And vodka. Mostly vodka.

**<A. Clef:>** Breakfast of champions. You know, Dmitri, standing here, eating a muffin and chatting with you at the monthly senior staff brunch, looking at all these people I've worked with for years chatting and having a good time, you know what thought comes to my mind?

**<D. Strelnikov:>** We are fish in barrel.

**<A. Clef:>** You know me too well.

**<D. Strelnikov:>** Security is tight. All air vents are checks, all food is checks for poison, all walls and carpets sweep for bugs and bombs, all utensils and such are opens from sterile packs. All is good.

**<A. Clef:>** Excellent. Knew I could count on you, Dmitri. Hell, in order to hit us here, they'd have to smuggle a bomb in a waffle iron or some. . . thing. . .

**<D. Strelnikov:>** . . .

**<A. Clef:>** . . .

**<D. Strelnikov:>** Excusing me, James. Allows me to check-- oh, son of the bitches.

**<A. Clef:>** Oh, for fuck's sake, you HAVE to be kid-- EVERYONE MOVE! GET THE FUCK OU--

> //Excerpt from Interview conducted by O5-█, regarding Dr. Edision’s involvement in Incident 234-900-Tempest Night-1.//
> 
> **O5-█:** Good evening, Dr. Edison.
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** Good evening, sir.
> 
> **O5-█:** Please, take a seat. I have a few questions to ask you.
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** …I’m not in trouble, am I?
> 
> **O5-█:** No, of course not. This simply standard procedure.
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** Oh. Okay then. That’s fine, I guess.
> 
> **O5-█:** Glad to hear it. Now, tell me, exactly where were you when the incident began?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** Well let’s see… I believe I was in the middle of feeding SCP-391 when I heard the blast. Fearing for my safety, I fled to the nearest security station only to find that the security personnel inside had died prior to my arrival.
> 
> **O5-█:** Do you have any idea how they died?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** No idea, sir. Everyone had a big gash in the back of the head, but it looked like they didn’t have their weapons drawn or anything so I guess they didn’t fight back.
> 
> **O5-█:** Interesting. So what did you do?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** Well, I took one good look at the security monitors and quickly realized how [EXPLICITIVE REDACTED] we all... um, I mean, that we were in the middle of a wide-scale Class-█ containment breach. I tried to activate the self-destruct sequence manually, but the detonation system was apparently too damaged to respond. So I sent a message over the intercom ordering all essential personnel to evacuate, and ordering all remaining security personnel to enter high alert. 
> 
> **O5-█:** And then what?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** Well, then I noticed that SCP-353 (who had breached containment), was being escorted by a number of masked men towards section [REDACTED], where we were keeping all the biohazardous materials from Site 19. So I… um…
> 
> **O5-█:** Well? What did you do?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** I... went after them. Die Hard style.
> 
> **O5-█:** ...I beg your pardon?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** I mean I went after them. Alone. I ran around the site grabbing everything that looked even remotely useful, picked off the masked men one by one using my superior knowledge of Site-17, and squared off with SCP-353 in a climactic showdown inside of the decontamination chamber.
> 
> **O5-█:** …
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** …
> 
> **O5-█:** …Is there any chance you "forgot" to take your medicine that day?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** …maybe?
