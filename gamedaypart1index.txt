**Act 1:** This act takes place over a period of 24 hours. A massive attack on a Foundation containment site has injured several key members of the SCP Foundation and caused multiple containment breaches. The theme for this act is SECURE: tell stories about the Foundation dealing with multiple containment breaches and responding to a major attack on one of their secure facilities.

In order to prevent any time paradoxes or continuity errors, please list any SCPs you are using or or plan to use below.

> //Excerpt from official after-action report compiled by Dr. Alto Clef regarding Incident 234-900-Tempest Night.//
> 
> **0811 to 0823: Initial Contact**
> 
> At 0811 hours on ██-██-████, multiple containment breaches occured at Humanoid Containment Site-17, caused by multiple explosive devices placed at critical points throughout the facility. One such device, placed in Conference Room 9b, resulted in death or injury to several key senior staff members, resulting in the loss of the top three levels of site leadership. This disruption of the chain of command resulted in a severe communications breakdown, preventing detonation of the on-site nuclear device as a final fail-safe (as well as making it difficult to contact other sites for help).
> 
> The situation was exacerbated by the unusually large number of artifacts in temporary containment at Site-17. Although normally serving as a minimum to moderate security facility for human and humanoid artifacts, an infestation of █████ ████ at Site-19 resulted in the temporary transfer of numerous non-humanoid artifacts of Safe/Euclid classification to Site-17 while decontamination took place.
> 
> The combination of these factors (disruption of command structure, loss of communications, physical damage from explosive devices, unusually large number of artifacts in containment) resulted in a Tempest Night scenario: multiple and severe containment breaches combined with the loss of the final nuclear fail-safe. The situation was further exacerbated at 0823 hours, when a number of unknown personnel from an unknown agency attacked the facility itself. . .

> 
> **O5-█:** Good evening, Dr. Edison.
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** Good evening, sir.
> 
> **O5-█:** Please, take a seat. I have a few questions to ask you.
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** …I’m not in trouble, am I?
> 
> **O5-█:** No, of course not. This simply standard procedure.
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** Oh. Okay then. That’s fine, I guess.
> 
> **O5-█:** Glad to hear it. Now, tell me, exactly where were you when the incident began?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** Well let’s see… I believe I was in the middle of feeding [[[SCP-391]]] when I heard the blast. Fearing for my safety, I fled to the nearest security station only to find that the security personnel inside had died prior to my arrival.
> 
> **O5-█:** Do you have any idea how they died?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** No idea, sir. Everyone had a big gash in the back of the head, but it looked like they didn’t have their weapons drawn or anything so I guess they didn’t fight back.
> 
> **O5-█:** Interesting. So what did you do?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** Well, I took one good look at the security monitors and quickly realized how [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] we all... um, I mean, that we were in the middle of a wide-scale Class-█ containment breach. I tried to activate the self-destruct sequence manually, but the detonation system was apparently too damaged to respond. So I sent a message over the intercom ordering all essential personnel to evacuate, and ordering all remaining security personnel to enter high alert. 
> 
> **O5-█:** And then what?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** Well, then I noticed that [[[SCP-353]]] (who had breached containment), was being escorted by a number of masked men towards section [REDACTED], where we were keeping all the biohazardous materials from Site 19. So I… um…
> 
> **O5-█:** Well? What did you do?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** I... went after them. Die Hard style.
> 
> **O5-█:** ...I beg your pardon?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** I mean I went after them. Alone. I ran around the site grabbing everything that looked even remotely useful, picked off the masked men one by one using my superior knowledge of Site-17, and squared off with SCP-353 in a climactic showdown inside of the decontamination chamber.
> 
> **O5-█:** …

> **O5-█**: Where were you at the time of the explosions?
> 
> **Dr. Honey**: I was working with [[[SCP-737]]], sir. I'd come up with a new theory regarding its aversion to copper and -
> 
> **O5-█**: Fascinating, I'm sure, but hardly relevant.
> 
> **Dr. Honey**: No, sir. Well, I was knocked unconscious by the explosion, as the security footage //clearly// shows.
> 
> **O5-█**: Of course.
> 
> **Dr. Honey**: When I came to, 737 had gone. I was inside the observation chamber, so it hadn't seen me, but the guard...oh god. C-can I have a moment?
> 
> **O5-█**: I'm afraid I must ask you to continue, doctor.
> 
> **Dr. Honey**: That train had just tunneled right through his head. There was blood everywhere, and there was a suspiciously train-shaped hole in the wall.
> 
> **O5-█**: And how did you react to this?
> 
> **Dr. Honey**: I went after it, of course. I thought security would be busy with the explosion, so I grabbed a sheet of copper from the emergency locker and went looking. I thought the explosion was just a minor containment breach. I didn't think it was that bad.
> 
> **O5-█**: Understandable.
> 
> **Dr. Honey**: As I was saying, I walked out of SCP-737's containment area and into the neighboring hallway. I spotted it turning around a corner and followed. I was all ready to grab it, but...oh god, I really need a minute.
> 
> (**O5-█** sighs.)

> 
> **Dr. King:** Well, I was mostly just trying to find something to keep my mind off the… the… the you-know-whats that were keeping me cooped up in there. I mean, it’s not like there was much else I could do other than watch the monitors and call people with the radio. I’ve really got to hand it to the guys who designed the security system, that security system was state of the art! I don’t think there was a single blind spot in the entire base. I mean-

> 
> **Dr. Sorts:**  Well, last time we had a really virulent SCP-945 outbreak the replicas overwhelmed an entire site.  But they also kept it operational -- when it became clear to me that every possible bad thing that could have happened DID happen I decided that regardless of the danger the SCP-945 replicas posed they were more valuable as an ally... er... asset, than otherwise.  So I set about collecting as many replicas as I could find running around the site and convincing them to play roles in this movie.  It was the only way I could claim any authority over the positions those replicas were taking.

**Excerpt From Debriefing Interview Vang-2**
**Interviewer:** Agent ██████
**Subject:** Dr. Vang, Ph.D.
**Date:** ██/██/20██

> **Agent ██████:** All right, where were you when the attack happened?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** I was asleep in MRI Lab Three, two floors up and about five doors down the hall from where the bombs were. I woke up when they went off, of course.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** What was your initial reaction?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** I just laid there a bit until the gunfire started, then I decided to report to the infirmary to get an amnesiac. You see, the SCP I was working on, some of the initial tests indicate that the symptoms include auditory hallucinations. I figured an amnesiac might fix it.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** I see. Carry on.
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** So, I was approaching an intersection in the hallway when I saw one of our security guards trading fire with someone I couldn't see. It dawned on me that it was all real when the top half of his head got blown up.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** And then?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** I ran the other direction, hid in the closet, and hyperventilated for a while. When I calmed down, I ran back into the MRI lab to get my laptop.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** Why?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** Well, I fell asleep last night before I could log out, and I had neglected to log out when I had woken up, so anyone could have gotten sensitive information off of it. Anyways, when I got back, my laptop was gone, and so was one of the desktops.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** What was on those computers?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** I don't know about the desktop, but my laptop had some of my project files on it. Most of my projects involve abnormal memorability, so about ninety percent of it was just particularly catchy songs. In addition to that, there was a copy of the Communist Manifesto written entirely in pig latin, and there were nine variations of-
> 
> **Agent ██████:** Anything //important//?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** Sorry, sir. One of my USBs had a minute-long clip of [[[SCP-444]]], and my laptop had a photo that makes you dizzy for a minute or so when you look at it. Those are the only things I can think of that would be of any real importance.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** Very good. Now, back to the MRI Lab. What was your course of action?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** Well, I realized that it would be a pretty bad thing if someone attacking the site had four forty-four, considering that a good portion of //our// work with it is weaponization. I looked around, and none of the rooms around me looked like anything was stolen from them, so I figured that whoever took my computer had a good idea of what they were looking for. I heard someone coming, so I ducked into the break room.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** What happened next?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** Whoever it was, they ran past, so I sat down and thought for a minute or so. I went to the fridge, grabbed a bottle of root beer, and broke it. To get a weapon, you know. I changed into my backup pants, then I stuffed my pockets with as many of the emergency ear plugs as I could find and went out to distribute them to our guys.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** Emergency ear plugs?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** It's the memetics department, sir. We go through them like toilet paper.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** ...

**Excerpt from debriefing of Prof. Anders Bjornsen**

> **Security Agent █████ (SA):** Why were you in the transportation depot when the incident began?
> 
> **Prof. Anders Bjornsen (AB):** I had just been re-assigned to work on [[[SCP-272]]] from [[[SCP-200]]] and was waiting for the transfer team to arrive from SCP-272's previous containment site. I had only skimmed the briefing report, but apparently that site was being re-configured as a secure site for higher-threat-level SCPs.
> 
> **SA:** According to the logs, that security team delivered that SCP and left over 90 minutes before the incident.
> 
> **AB:** //sighs//
> 
> **AB:** Yes, but... well, I was talking with one of the security guards down there about some... personal matters and lost track of time. A good thing, too, or I would've been in my office when it collapsed.
> 
> **SA:** We'll come back to that. Did you notice anything unusual before the incident?
> 
> **AB:** I overheard one of the other guards mention that there had been a lot of SCP deliveries that day, but other than that, no. Well, until the klaxon went off, anyways. Then all the guards started scrambling for the doors into the rest of site.
> 
> **SA:** And what did you do?
> 
> **AB:** What any good boy scout would do: I decided to investigate the SCPs that nobody had yet bothered to pick up. Mighty careless of the researchers of those prospective projects to not collect them, but to my advantage. The first was, luckily, [[[SCP-262]]].
> 
> **SA:** And then?
> 
> **AB:** I went looking for guns.

Agent Vance approached, using a vending machine for concealment, until running the remaining distance to the door. Several shots were fired, but neither Agent was injured. The insurgents ran through the door after Agent Vance. Approximately thirty seconds later, several pieces of the insurgents flew out of the room, striking the opposite wall. Anomaly VN-1520 (SCP number pending) exited through the door before killing several other insurgents. It then deactivated, falling to the floor.

> //Excerpt from official after-action report compiled by Dr. Alto Clef regarding Incident 234-900-Tempest Night.//
> 
> **0823 to 0915: Breakdown**
> 
> It is at this point that the situation escalated to a full-out Tempest Night scenario, as multiple containment breaches occured throughout the facility, causing near-complete loss of containment. Ironically, the majority of the containment breaches were caused by Foundation personnel themselves, in an attempt to stop the incursion by the unknown hostile force. Secondary containment breaches followed, resulting in the Foundation-Wide Alert Status being upgraded to Red.
> 
> The result was complete loss of situational control. Without a central coordinating authority, individual Foundation personnel were working at cross-purposes, interfering with and even counteracting each others' actions. In at least one case, a Foundation scientist's heroic sacrifice in maintaining containment of a Euclid-Class artifact was immediately rendered null and void when another Foundation researcher immediately breached containment of said artifact with the intent to use it as a weapon against the insurgent forces.
> 
> The situation would continue until the re-establishment of intra-site communications by Secretary Adams. By that point, however, the situation had proceeded past the point of no return. Many of the SCP artifacts had broken through the site lockdown and escaped into the wild. Mission priority then changed from securing the breached artifacts to surviving the (largely self-created) crisis.

> **Excerpt from debriefing of Prof. Anders Bjornsen**
> 
> **SA:** What were you doing when you encountered Vice Clef Adams?
> 
> **AB:** I was outside Decon 6, wrestling with one of the arms, trying to pry loose the last of the guns. I'm pretty sure it was already out of ammo, but I didn't want one of the others to pick up a clip somewhere and reload it.
> 
> **SA:** Decontamination Wing 6 is quite a distance from the transport depot or your designated containment breach evacuation point. Why were you there?
> 
> **AB:** The explosions had filled a lot of the hallways with rubble and I was trying to get to the containment chamber of SCP-200. It was the only place I could think of that was reasonably secure, assuming that it hadn't been collapsed. Decon 6 was on the quickest path to get there.
> 
> **SA:** How did you recognize V.C. Adams?
> 
> **AB:** I'd seen her in the cafeteria a couple of times before, once with Director Clef, so I figured she belonged. She was headed straight for the doors into Decon, but I stopped her before she went in.
> 
> **SA:** Why was that?
> 
> **AB:** I'd already peeked in there and it was fucking chaos. All safe or euclid class SCPs have to go through it, even if they're well-documented, but it's only supposed to be temporary containment and the explosions must've cracked some of the walls. At least half the chamber doors were open and I saw about 8 or 10 people in what looked like riot gear, piling a ton of shit into some metal boxes. Paperwork, at least one laptop, and I think I saw a birdcage with something moving in it. Their gear didn't have any of the guards' markings on them, so I figured that they weren't part of the Foundation.
> 
> **SA:** What did V.C. Adams do when you told her this?
> 
> **AB:** What do you think she did? She cursed and asked if there was any other way around it.
> 
> **SA:** Was there?
> 
> **AB:** She obviously found one, or we wouldn't be here. I told her to follow me and we took the long way around until we got to the security station outside the Safe Humanoids wing. It took us about 20 minutes, since we had to backtrack a couple of times when we hit blocked hallways or more groups of those riot-gear guys. One time they were carrying something in a body bag that was struggling pretty fiercely.
> 
> **SA:** Did you encounter any SCPs on your way?
> 
> **AB:** Not that I know of. I smelled something burning a couple of times and I was told later that there was a loose SCP made of fire. And when we finally got to the security station outside the Safe Humanoids wing, we found that all the guards had been decapitated and burned. I was almost at SCP-200's chamber, so I gave that distraction SCP to Ms. Adams in case she needed it, and pointed her down to Protective Materials. Assuming that she didn't encounter anything else, she should've been there in about 10 minutes.
> 
> **SA:** After V.C. Adams left you, what did you do?
> 
> **AB:** I went into the Humanoids wing. Unfortunately, it'd been pretty trashed too, although I don't know if it was from the explosions, from the invading force, or one of the escaped SCPs. I do know that when I got to SCP-200's chamber, the door was wide open and the damn cocoon was ripped to shreds. And I couldn't even hole up there because the damn handle was ripped off and the door wouldn't close.

> **Research Assistant Corbette:** Ok, ok, sorry. So, I'm eating my muffin, right? And suddenly I hear this big boom and there's alarms blaring everywhere and I don't know what the fuck to do, I'm just looking after all the Misters, right? And then I get an emergency memo from the boss, and he says to me, "Evacuate all the Misters." And I mean there's only four of them here right now, so it isn't that hard. So I put down my muffin, and I'm like, "Holy shit guys, we gotta get outta here!"
> 
> **Site Director ███████:** So you were instructed by Dr. Hayward to evacuate his projects?
> 
> **Research Assistant Corbette:** Yeah, so I handcuff Forgetful to myself because, y'know, every 20 seconds he has no idea what the shit is going on. And then I handcuff Chameleon to Hungry, and Moon just kinda hobbles along with us on his cane.

**Transcript of Containment Breach 13-34 Eyewitness Account Interview**

**Interviewed:** Assistant Researcher Li Huang.
 
**Interviewer:** O5-█ 

**Foreword:** Temporary Containment Area 17-Gamma’s surveillance functions were completely disabled at 0811.  Around 0832, it is estimated that Containment Breach 13-34 occurred at Temporary Containment Area 17-Gamma.  Assistant Researcher Huang was an eyewitness of Containment Breach 13-34 and the immediate aftermath.  

> **O5-█:** Describe the events leading up to Containment Breach 13-34.
> 
> **Huang:** People flocked to 17-Gamma for safety.  The logic was that if it could contain a Keter-class SCP object, then it could protect them from the attackers.  Though communication with the main Site had been disabled, 17-Gamma was believed to be one of the safest places in Site-17.   Basic security had remained uncompromised, and there were plenty of weapons.  At 0823, of course, the attack by—
> 
> //Huang coughs.//
> 
> **Huang:** Excuse me.  17-Gamma came under attack.  Many Foundation personnel, having…collected SCP objects from Site-17, began to use those objects in order to repel the attackers.
> 
> **O5-█:** They intentionally breached containment for those objects?
> 
> **Huang:** Not everybody.  The explosions had already breached containment for some objects, which were just picked up off the ground.
> 
> **O5-█:** Did you do that?
> 
> **Huang:** No.
> 
> **O5-█:** Please continue.  
> 
> **Huang:** The exact details escape me.  However, approximately thirty seconds into the firefight, I became aware of somebody using [[[SCP-399]]] as an enhanced stunner by producing what I presume to be some sort of pressure shockwave. Perhaps unauthorized usage of SCP-914 provided a power source.
> 
> **O5-█:** Do you know exactly how 17-Gamma’s containment unit was breached?
> 
> **Huang:** No.  I didn’t even see it happen.   Maybe a stray grenade caused structural damage. But even if I had seen the breach occur, I wouldn’t have understood the significance.  I didn’t know what 17-Gamma was containing.  I didn’t have the clearance.  I assume that many others were similarly unaware.  In the absence of a chain of command, we simply didn’t know where not to go and what not to do.
> 
> **O5-█:** What happened during Containment Breach 13-34?
> 
> **Huang:** The shockwaves were very loud, which already exacerbated the situation.  However, that alone was not enough to cause the destruction associated with Containment Breach 13-34. I am not entirely certain, but I have my suspicions about what did.  A piece of metal debris that resonated with a shockwave in just the right way, producing a sound quite like a bell...we all know what happened next.  I remember an explosion of wings, and then, nothing.  I woke up a few minutes later.  [[[SCP-469]]] was nowhere in sight.  
> 
> **O5-█:** So Containment Breach 13-34 was the result of unfortunate coincidence?  
> 
> **Huang:** Maybe.  But fifty-two people died in Containment Breach 13-34.  If you wish to attribute that to unfortunate coincidence, that’s your decision, sir.

> 
> This period of the crisis can be considered the nadir of the incident: due to complete loss of containment and the presence of the hostile party, Foundation elements were rendered both operational and combat ineffective. Hostile elements had free reign of the facility, and many priceless artifacts were lost. The situation was further exacerbated by a complete release of D-Class personnel when confinement protocols failed. The presence of several hundred hardened criminals in this crisis situation was, to put it mildly, not optimally conducive to maintaining order.
> 
> It is at this point that certain facts about the hostile force became evident. Firstly, the training and skill level of the hostiles were widely disparate: certain elements displayed paramilitary levels of combat and tactical expertise, while others were clearly untrained civilians. Secondly, the goal of the hostile force was not capture, but release of the contained artifacts: although some opportunistic looting took place, escaping SCP artifacts were not pursued, but allowed to escape.
> 
> It is for this reason that I believe that the hostile force were not directed by Marshall, Carter, and Dark: MC&D would not have passed up the opportunity to retrieve several key artifacts that could have proven lucrative to their private efforts. The modus operandi is also inconsistent with the GOC or the Chaos Insurgency: Among other things, the Global Occult Coalition would have simply eradicated the entire site, while the Insurgency would not have passed up the opportunity to capture several easily weaponized artifacts for private use. Although the goals seem consistent with the group called the Serpent's Hand, the brazen nature of the attack (and the lack of SCP-class artifacts among the attackers) are not characteristic of that organization's modus operandi. Further research is required.

During Incident 234-900-Tempest Night, many junior staff and personnel took part in the attempts to repel attackers by seizing control of already uncontained SCPs or, in some cases, breaching containment of SCPs with the intent of seizing control of them for defensive purposes. A notable example of a failed attempt is the efforts of Junior Researcher █████ Eskobar, who remains in medical care and has begun psychiatric treatment recently. Relevant information is included below.

**After-Action Debriefing, O5-█/Guard B-3273**

> **O5-█**: Tell me about Researcher Eskobar's behavior during the beginning of Tempest Night.
> 
> **B-3273**: Christ, he was the same as the rest of them. We heard junior staff running around like hamsters, screaming about “I always wanted to try SCP-this” and “we have no choice, we have to have SCP-that.” It's  insulting that almost every one of them forgot that there were still a few guards in the building, still staying on post no matter what was happening. You know, actually securing a few SCPs, not letting them out and hoping everything just turned out okay. 
> 
> **O5-█**: And you say Eskobar was the same?
>  
> **B-3273**: No, Eskobar was the worst. He hadn't worked here more than a month at that point, and he apparently hadn't read half of the files on the Scips he was trying to break out. He was going to jump on to the table in front of [[[SCP-212]]], figuring it would just turn him into Robocop. You should have seen the look on his face when we told him about the “no anesthetic” part, or the survival rate.
> 
> **O5-█**: But Eskobar kept trying.
> 
> **B-3273**: I guess he forgot we still had radios. We were tracking his movements, and by the time he got to ███, we had decided enough was enough. 
> 
> **O5-█** So you moved in to arrest him.
> 
> **B-3273**: As far as I'm concerned, he had enough chances. We waited until he actually tried breaching containment for the third before we took him.
> 
> **O5-█**: And none of the guards were feeling...especially antagonistic towards the researcher?
>  
> **B-3273**: Of course not, sir. We maintained professional conduct throughout the incident. Where possible.
>  
> **O5-█**: I'm interested in how Eskobar escaped from containment and broke into Site-17's video archive.
> 
> **B-3273**: I'm sorry, sir. I guess he just got past us.
> 
> **O5-█**: I'm especially concerned with how he managed to break in while still handcuffed and gagged.
> 
> **B-3273**: Sorry, sir. I guess he just got past us.
> 
>  **O5-█**: Were any of you aware of his coulrophobia?
> 
> **B-3273**: Sir?
> 
> **O5-█**: His fear of clowns.
> 
>  **B-3273**: Not particularly, sir. We would never—well, we would have advised him not to...contain himself in that particular room had we known that, no matter what had happened.
>  
>  **O5-█**: (sighs) Yes, that's what the others said. 
> 
> Due to lack of evidence and extenuating circumstances, guards involved in the incident have been cleared of all charges.

**Suggested modification to [[[SCP-993]]] containment protocols, Addendum 993-1:**

> Given the events surrounding the death of Dr. █████ (see [[[behind the scenes|Incident Report 993-Gamma]]]) and its behavior during Incident Tempest Night, it appears that SCP-993's previous manifestation towards children and exclusion of adults was the result of a conscious choice. SCP-993 is capable of manifesting itself to adults as well as children. However, in order to interact with adults, SCP-993 appears to be able to render adults unconscious. Once unconscious, [REDACTED] (see Security Log Transcript, Camera 00290993)


**Excerpt of Security Log, Video Transcript, Security Camera 00290933**

> **1048**: Researcher Eskobar appears to regain consciousness. Begins smiling.
> 
> **1050**: Researcher Eskobar rises to his feet, maintaining eye contact with television.
> 
> **1055**: Gag applied to Eskobar's mouth falls out. Hands cease to be restrained. [Note: Handcuff chain was later found to have been severed by unknown means.] 
> 
> **1059**: Researcher Eskobar raises his arms outward to the sides, forming a T-shape. Video cuts out briefly. When image returns, Eskobar's hands are pinned to the wall with large spikes; blood is flowing freely down his arms and down the wall. Researcher Eskobar's face is smiling widely, and continues to do so for the duration of the taping (seventy-two hours).

**After-Action Summary, ██/██/11:** 

> After the conclusion of Incident Tempest Night, during cleanup operations, Researcher Eskobar was found in Site 17's video archive, badly dehydrated, suffering serious blood loss, and nearing a comatose state, still smiling. Researcher Eskobar was taken to a Foundation medical facility and assigned to psychiatric therapy. The television across from Researcher Eskobar remained on, broadcasting test pattern SMPTE RP 219-2002 (commonly known as “color bars”). Several DVDs were found on top of the television; when arranged in a rainbow shape, markings on the DVDs spelled out “SEASON II!” These discs were revealed to contain videos in the animated style of SCP-993, depicting the deaths of various Foundation researchers during Tempest Night. Some of these deaths were not actually witnessed by any surviving researchers, casting doubt on whether the particular brutality shown to accompany many of these deaths actually happened. 
> 
> SCP-993's primary role in the videos is narrative in nature, providing commentary for the deaths and making comedic comments about both the means by which individuals died and the appearance of the remains of dead personnel. However, three researchers who were never located and considered MIA, along with two D-class personnel who were believed to have escaped, are shown on the videos. Each researcher is individually shown being knocked unconscious by an unseen attacker and dragged into empty containment rooms. Though the experiences of all three are different, all are assaulted in various ways using different weapons, which appear to be held by the camera's operator. One is shown dying from blood loss during a surgical operation to connect the victim's colon to his esophagus, another dies of cerebral failure during an unanesthetized hemispherectomy, and the final researcher dies of shock after being skinned alive with an industrial-grade belt sander. The two D-class personnel are shown being sewn to one another at several points and led into an area where SCP-███ was roaming after breaching containment, leading to dismemberment. All five victims continue smiling broadly throughout their experiences. None of these events can be corroborated or disproved by available evidence.

> **Debriefing: Research Assistant Harold Wachtel**
> //Excerpt from interview conducted by O5-█, regarding Research Assistant Harold Whactel’s involvement in Incident 234-900-Tempest Night-1.//
> 
> **O5-█:** Why did you bring 447 with you?
> 
> **Wachtel:** I'd missed my check-in by then, and since no-one had come looking for me, I was assuming the worst. I didn't want any hostiles getting their hands on it and exposing it to a dead body.
> 
> **O5-█:** Is that also why you took off your lab coat and trousers, and threw them in the incinerator?
> 
> **Wachtel:** Yes, sir.
