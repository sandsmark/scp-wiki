> //Excerpt from official after-action report compiled by Dr. Alto Clef regarding Incident 234-900-Tempest Night.//
> 
> **0811 to 0823: Initial Contact**
> 
> At 0811 hours on ██-██-████, multiple containment breaches occured at Humanoid Containment Site-17, caused by multiple explosive devices placed at critical points throughout the facility. One such device, placed in Conference Room 9b, resulted in death or injury to several key senior staff members, resulting in the loss of the top three levels of site leadership. This disruption of the chain of command resulted in a severe communications breakdown, preventing detonation of the on-site nuclear device as a final fail-safe (as well as making it difficult to contact other sites for help).
> 
> The situation was exacerbated by the unusually large number of artifacts in temporary containment at Site-17. Although normally serving as a minimum to moderate security facility for human and humanoid artifacts, an infestation of █████ ████ at Site-19 resulted in the temporary transfer of numerous non-humanoid artifacts of Safe/Euclid classification to Site-17 while decontamination took place.
> 
> The combination of these factors (disruption of command structure, loss of communications, physical damage from explosive devices, unusually large number of artifacts in containment) resulted in a Tempest Night scenario: multiple and severe containment breaches combined with the loss of the final nuclear fail-safe. The situation was further exacerbated at 0823 hours, when a number of unknown personnel from an unknown agency attacked the facility itself. . .

> **Debriefing: Dr. Michael Edison**
>
> //Excerpt from Interview conducted by O5-█, regarding Dr. Edison’s involvement in Incident 234-900-Tempest Night-1.//
> 
> **O5-█:** Good evening, Dr. Edison.
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** Good evening, sir.
> 
> **O5-█:** Please, take a seat. I have a few questions to ask you.
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** …I’m not in trouble, am I?
> 
> **O5-█:** No, of course not. This simply standard procedure.
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** Oh. Okay then. That’s fine, I guess.
> 
> **O5-█:** Glad to hear it. Now, tell me, exactly where were you when the incident began?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** Well let’s see… I believe I was in the middle of feeding [[[SCP-391]]] when I heard the blast. Fearing for my safety, I fled to the nearest security station only to find that the security personnel inside had died prior to my arrival.
> 
> **O5-█:** Do you have any idea how they died?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** No idea, sir. Everyone had a big gash in the back of the head, but it looked like they didn’t have their weapons drawn or anything so I guess they didn’t fight back.
> 
> **O5-█:** Interesting. So what did you do?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** Well, I took one good look at the security monitors and quickly realized how [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] we all... um, I mean, that we were in the middle of a wide-scale Class-█ containment breach. I tried to activate the self-destruct sequence manually, but the detonation system was apparently too damaged to respond. So I sent a message over the intercom ordering all essential personnel to evacuate, and ordering all remaining security personnel to enter high alert. 
> 
> **O5-█:** And then what?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** Well, then I noticed that [[[SCP-353]]] (who had breached containment), was being escorted by a number of masked men towards section [REDACTED], where we were keeping all the biohazardous materials from Site 19. So I… um…
> 
> **O5-█:** Well? What did you do?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** I... went after them. Die Hard style.
> 
> **O5-█:** ...I beg your pardon?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** I mean I went after them. Alone. I ran around the site grabbing everything that looked even remotely useful, picked off the masked men one by one using my superior knowledge of Site-17, and squared off with SCP-353 in a climactic showdown inside of the decontamination chamber.
> 
> **O5-█:** …
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** …
> 
> **O5-█:** …Is there any chance you "forgot" to take your medicine that day?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** …maybe?

**Interview: Dr. Tarn Honey/O5-█**
> //Portion of interview between O5-█ and Dr. Tarn Honey//, ██/██/████.
> 
> <Interview Begins>
> 
> **O5-█**: Where were you at the time of the explosions?
> 
> **Dr. Honey**: I was working with [[[SCP-737]]], sir. I'd come up with a new theory regarding its aversion to copper and -
> 
> **O5-█**: Fascinating, I'm sure, but hardly relevant.
> 
> **Dr. Honey**: No, sir. Well, I was knocked unconscious by the explosion, as the security footage //clearly// shows.
> 
> **O5-█**: Of course.
> 
> **Dr. Honey**: When I came to, 737 had gone. I was inside the observation chamber, so it hadn't seen me, but the guard...oh god. C-can I have a moment?
> 
> **O5-█**: I'm afraid I must ask you to continue, doctor.
> 
> **Dr. Honey**: That train had just tunneled right through his head. There was blood everywhere, and there was a suspiciously train-shaped hole in the wall.
> 
> **O5-█**: And how did you react to this?
> 
> **Dr. Honey**: I went after it, of course. I thought security would be busy with the explosion, so I grabbed a sheet of copper from the emergency locker and went looking. I thought the explosion was just a minor containment breach. I didn't think it was that bad.
> 
> **O5-█**: Understandable.
> 
> **Dr. Honey**: As I was saying, I walked out of SCP-737's containment area and into the neighboring hallway. I spotted it turning around a corner and followed. I was all ready to grab it, but...oh god, I really need a minute.
> 
> (**O5-█** sighs.)
> 
> **O5-█**: Of course. Take your time.

**Interview: Dr. Tarn Honey/O5-█**
> //Portion of interview between O5-█ and Dr. Tarn Honey//, ██/██/████
> 
> <Interview Begins>
> 
> **Dr. Honey:** I entered the hallway and...and there were just so many bodies. 
> 
> **O5-█:** They were security?
> 
> **Dr. Honey:** I suppose they must have been. I didn't know who they were or what had killed them at the time. Of course I now know it was [[[SCP-870.]]] They couldn't have even heard it.
> 
> **O5-█:** A tragic waste of life. Please continue.
> 
> **Dr. Honey:** 737 was there, of course. You know, from the reports you'd imagine it just hits a wall and eats its way through it, but it's more like a maggot. A big, train-shaped, wooden maggot. I should rewrite that report.
> 
> **O5-█:** Perhaps not right now, doctor. You managed to capture 737?
> 
> **Dr. Honey:** It was...it was eating the bodies. At this point it was about seven carriages long. There was no way I could pick that thing up.
> 
> **O5-█:** This is when you hit the alarm?
> 
> **Dr. Honey:** Yes, I -
> 
> (At this point, **Dr. Honey** entered a coughing fit that lasted forty-three seconds, due to the condition at time of interview.)
> 
> **Dr. Honey:** Sorry about (coughs) that. Must be that bug going around!
> 
> **O5-█:** That's alright. Did security arrive?
> 
> **Dr. Honey:** No. I knew at this point something serious was going on. I decided to stay back in 737's containment area. (Laughs) It's not like anyone was using it!

**Audio Log From Maintenance Tunnel 3A**
> **Agent Lombardi:** "Okay, see, that wasn't so bad, was it? We got through, and we're both still alive. Yeah, I know. The cannibal's a scary fucker, but the fuckers shooting at us were a bit scarier. Besides, Fernand ain't stupid. Someone shootin' at him is a much bigger deal than a couple of guys what are just running through."
> 
> **Agent Vance:** "He just... broke them."
> 
> **Agent Lombardi:** "That was the idea, kid. Now, we're gettin' close to the armory. We're gonna get in there, grab some hardware, and then try and meet up with other agents. Hopefully someone out there's still alive an' giving orders. Failing that, we keep the intruders busy."
> 
> **Agent Vance:** "How do we do that?"
> 
> **Agent Lombardi:** "We kill them. We steer them into dangerous skips. We improvise. You ever see Home Alone?"
> 
> **Agent Vance:** "Yeah."
> 
> **Agent Lombardi:** "Well, it's gonna be like that, but more people are gonna die. Hopefully not us."

> 
> **O5-█:**  Was it really necessary to convince the replica of Dr. Robertson that she was your love interest in an action movie?
> 
> **Dr. Sorts:**  Believe me I wish I had thought of something else off the top of my head.  I've been exposed to enough of SCP-945 prior to this clusterfuck, I really didn't want to, you know, improvise a love scene with my colleague's shawabti.  I've prepared a full report on that experience by the way.  Psych's going to have a field day with it I'm sure.
> 
> **O5-█:**  What happened next?
> 
> **Dr. Sorts:**  Well, last time we had a really virulent SCP-945 outbreak the replicas overwhelmed an entire site.  But they also kept it operational -- when it became clear to me that every possible bad thing that could have happened DID happen I decided that regardless of the danger the SCP-945 replicas posed they were more valuable as an ally... er... asset, than otherwise.  So I set about collecting as many replicas as I could find running around the site and convincing them to play roles in this movie.  It was the only way I could claim any authority over the positions those replicas were taking.
> 
> **O5-█:**  How many replicas did you have under your command?
> 
> **Dr. Sorts:**  Never more than about two dozen at any one time, but I think we went through about fifty replicas total.  
> 
> **O5-█:**  How was the replica of Dr. Robertson lost?
> 

> **Dr. Sorts:**  She was within the medical ward when I had the other replicas collapse the entrances with explosive charges.  I believe her ... I'm sorry.  I believe the duplicate was... the duplicates were destroyed in the explosion.

> **Dr. Sorts:**  I'm sorry, I need ... I need another sedative.
