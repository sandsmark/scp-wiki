> //Excerpt from official after-action report compiled by Dr. Alto Clef regarding Incident 234-900-Tempest Night.//
> 
> **0811 to 0823: Initial Contact**
> 
> At 0811 hours on ██-██-████, multiple containment breaches occured at Humanoid Containment Site-17, caused by multiple explosive devices placed at critical points throughout the facility. One such device, placed in Conference Room 9b, resulted in death or injury to several key senior staff members, resulting in the loss of the top three levels of site leadership. This disruption of the chain of command resulted in a severe communications breakdown, preventing detonation of the on-site nuclear device as a final fail-safe (as well as making it difficult to contact other sites for help).
> 
> The situation was exacerbated by the unusually large number of artifacts in temporary containment at Site-17. Although normally serving as a minimum to moderate security facility for human and humanoid artifacts, an infestation of █████ ████ at Site-19 resulted in the temporary transfer of numerous non-humanoid artifacts of Safe/Euclid classification to Site-17 while decontamination took place.
> 
> The combination of these factors (disruption of command structure, loss of communications, physical damage from explosive devices, unusually large number of artifacts in containment) resulted in a Tempest Night scenario: multiple and severe containment breaches combined with the loss of the final nuclear fail-safe. The situation was further exacerbated at 0823 hours, when a number of unknown personnel from an unknown agency attacked the facility itself. . .

> 
> **O5-█:** Good evening, Dr. Edison.
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** Good evening, sir.
> 
> **O5-█:** Please, take a seat. I have a few questions to ask you.
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** …I’m not in trouble, am I?
> 
> **O5-█:** No, of course not. This simply standard procedure.
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** Oh. Okay then. That’s fine, I guess.
> 
> **O5-█:** Glad to hear it. Now, tell me, exactly where were you when the incident began?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** Well let’s see… I believe I was in the middle of feeding [[[SCP-391]]] when I heard the blast. Fearing for my safety, I fled to the nearest security station only to find that the security personnel inside had died prior to my arrival.
> 
> **O5-█:** Do you have any idea how they died?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** No idea, sir. Everyone had a big gash in the back of the head, but it looked like they didn’t have their weapons drawn or anything so I guess they didn’t fight back.
> 
> **O5-█:** Interesting. So what did you do?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** Well, I took one good look at the security monitors and quickly realized how [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] we all... um, I mean, that we were in the middle of a wide-scale Class-█ containment breach. I tried to activate the self-destruct sequence manually, but the detonation system was apparently too damaged to respond. So I sent a message over the intercom ordering all essential personnel to evacuate, and ordering all remaining security personnel to enter high alert. 
> 
> **O5-█:** And then what?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** Well, then I noticed that [[[SCP-353]]] (who had breached containment), was being escorted by a number of masked men towards section [REDACTED], where we were keeping all the biohazardous materials from Site 19. So I… um…
> 
> **O5-█:** Well? What did you do?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** I... went after them. Die Hard style.
> 
> **O5-█:** ...I beg your pardon?
> 
> **Dr. Edison:** I mean I went after them. Alone. I ran around the site grabbing everything that looked even remotely useful, picked off the masked men one by one using my superior knowledge of Site-17, and squared off with SCP-353 in a climactic showdown inside of the decontamination chamber.
> 
> **O5-█:** …

> **Dr. Edison:** …

> **O5-█:** …Is there any chance you "forgot" to take your medicine that day?

> **O5-█**: Where were you at the time of the explosions?
> 
> **Dr. Honey**: I was working with [[[SCP-737]]], sir. I'd come up with a new theory regarding its aversion to copper and -
> 
> **O5-█**: Fascinating, I'm sure, but hardly relevant.
> 
> **Dr. Honey**: No, sir. Well, I was knocked unconscious by the explosion, as the security footage //clearly// shows.
> 
> **O5-█**: Of course.
> 
> **Dr. Honey**: When I came to, 737 had gone. I was inside the observation chamber, so it hadn't seen me, but the guard...oh god. C-can I have a moment?
> 
> **O5-█**: I'm afraid I must ask you to continue, doctor.
> 
> **Dr. Honey**: That train had just tunneled right through his head. There was blood everywhere, and there was a suspiciously train-shaped hole in the wall.
> 
> **O5-█**: And how did you react to this?
> 
> **Dr. Honey**: I went after it, of course. I thought security would be busy with the explosion, so I grabbed a sheet of copper from the emergency locker and went looking. I thought the explosion was just a minor containment breach. I didn't think it was that bad.
> 
> **O5-█**: Understandable.
> 
> **Dr. Honey**: As I was saying, I walked out of SCP-737's containment area and into the neighboring hallway. I spotted it turning around a corner and followed. I was all ready to grab it, but...oh god, I really need a minute.
> 
> (**O5-█** sighs.)

> 
> **Dr. King:** Well, I was mostly just trying to find something to keep my mind off the… the… the you-know-whats that were keeping me cooped up in there. I mean, it’s not like there was much else I could do other than watch the monitors and call people with the radio. I’ve really got to hand it to the guys who designed the security system, that security system was state of the art! I don’t think there was a single blind spot in the entire base. I mean-

> 
> **Dr. Sorts:**  Well, last time we had a really virulent SCP-945 outbreak the replicas overwhelmed an entire site.  But they also kept it operational -- when it became clear to me that every possible bad thing that could have happened DID happen I decided that regardless of the danger the SCP-945 replicas posed they were more valuable as an ally... er... asset, than otherwise.  So I set about collecting as many replicas as I could find running around the site and convincing them to play roles in this movie.  It was the only way I could claim any authority over the positions those replicas were taking.

**Excerpt From Debriefing Interview Vang-2**
**Interviewer:** Agent ██████
**Subject:** Dr. Vang, Ph.D.
**Date:** █/██/20██

> **Agent ██████:** All right, where were you when the attack happened?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** I was asleep in MRI Lab Three, two floors up and about five doors down the hall from where the bombs were. I woke up when they went off, of course.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** What was your initial reaction?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** I just laid there a bit until the gunfire started, then I decided to report to the infirmary to get an amnesiac. You see, the SCP I was working on, some of the initial tests indicate that the symptoms include auditory hallucinations. I figured an amnesiac might fix it.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** I see. Carry on.
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** So, I was approaching an intersection in the hallway when I saw one of our security guards trading fire with someone I couldn't see. It dawned on me that it was real when the top half of his head got blown up.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** And then?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** I ran the other direction, hid in the closet, and hyperventilated for a while. When I calmed down, I ran back into the MRI lab to get my laptop.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** Why?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** Well, I fell asleep last night before I could log out, so there was a chance that someone could have gotten at the files who didn't have clearance. Anyways, when I got back, my laptop was gone, and so was one of the desktops.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** Was any important data on those computers?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** I don't know about the desktop, but my laptop had some of my project files on it. Most of my projects involve abnormal memorability, so about ninety percent of it was just particularly catchy songs. In addition to that, there were nine variations of-
> 
> **Agent ██████:** Anything //important//?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** Sorry, sir. One of my USBs had a minute-long clip of [[[SCP-444]]], and a photo that makes you dizzy for a minute or so when you look at it. Those are the only things I can think of that would be of any real importance.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** Very good. Now, back to the MRI Lab. What was your course of action?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** Well, I realized that it would be a pretty bad thing if someone attacking the site had four forty-four, considering that a good portion of //our// work with it is weaponization. I looked around, and none of the rooms around me looked like anything was stolen from them, so I figured that whoever took my computer had a good idea of what they were looking for. I heard someone coming, so I ducked into the break room.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** What happened next?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** Whoever it was, they ran past, so I thought for a minute or so. I went to the fridge, grabbed a bottle of root beer, and broke it. To get a weapon, you know. Then, I stuffed my pockets with as many of the emergency ear plugs as I could find and went out to distribute them to our guys.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** Emergency ear plugs?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** It's the memetics department, sir. Standard issue.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** ...

**Excerpt from debriefing of Prof. Anders Bjornsen**

> **Security Agent █████ (SA):** Why were you in the transportation depot when the incident began?
> 
> **Prof. Anders Bjornsen (AB):** I had just been re-assigned to work on [[[SCP-272]]] from [[[SCP-200]]] and was waiting for the transfer team to arrive from SCP-272's previous containment site. I had only skimmed the briefing report, but apparently that site was being re-configured as a secure site for higher-threat-level SCPs.
> 
> **SA:** According to the logs, that security team delivered that SCP and left over 90 minutes before the incident.
> 
> **AB:** //sighs//
> 
> **AB:** Yes, but... well, I was talking with one of the security guards down there about some... personal matters and lost track of time. A good thing, too, or I would've been in my office when it collapsed.
> 
> **SA:** We'll come back to that. Did you notice anything unusual before the incident?
> 
> **AB:** I overheard one of the other guards mention that there had been a lot of SCP deliveries that day, but other than that, no. Well, until the klaxon went off, anyways. Then all the guards started scrambling for the doors into the rest of site.
> 
> **SA:** And what did you do?
> 
> **AB:** What any good boy scout would do: I decided to investigate the SCPs that nobody had yet bothered to pick up. Mighty careless of the researchers of those prospective projects to not collect them, but to my advantage. The first was, luckily, [[[SCP-262]]].
> 
> **SA:** And then?
> 
> **AB:** I went looking for guns.

Agent Vance approached, using a vending machine for concealment, until running the remaining distance to the door. Several shots were fired, but neither Agent was injured. The insurgents ran through the door after Agent Vance. Approximately thirty seconds later, several pieces of the insurgents flew out of the room, striking the opposite wall. Anomaly VN-1520 (SCP number pending) exited through the door before killing several other insurgents. It then deactivated, falling to the floor. Agent Lombardi picked it up as Agent Vance emerged back into the hallway, visibly shaken.//

> //Excerpt from official after-action report compiled by Dr. Alto Clef regarding Incident 234-900-Tempest Night.//
> 
> **0823 to 0915: Breakdown**
> 
> It is at this point that the situation escalated to a full-out Tempest Night scenario, as multiple containment breaches occured throughout the facility, causing near-complete loss of containment. Ironically, the majority of the containment breaches were caused by Foundation personnel themselves, in an attempt to stop the incursion by the unknown hostile force. Secondary containment breaches followed, resulting in the Foundation-Wide Alert Status being upgraded to Red.
> 
> The result was complete loss of situational control. Without a central coordinating authority, individual Foundation personnel were working at cross-purposes, interfering with and even counteracting each others' actions. In at least one case, a Foundation scientist's heroic sacrifice in maintaining containment of a Euclid-Class artifact was immediately rendered null and void when another Foundation researcher immediately breached containment of said artifact with the intent to use it as a weapon against the insurgent forces.
> 
> The situation would continue until the re-establishment of intra-site communications by Secretary Adams. By that point, however, the situation had proceeded past the point of no return. Many of the SCP artifacts had broken through the site lockdown and escaped into the wild. Mission priority then changed from securing the breached artifacts to surviving the (largely self-created) crisis.

> **Excerpt from debriefing of Prof. Anders Bjornsen**
> 
> **SA:** What were you doing when you encountered Vice Clef Adams?
> 
> **AB:** I was outside Decon 6, wrestling with one of the arms, trying to pry loose the last of the guns. I'm pretty sure it was already out of ammo, but I didn't want one of the others to pick up a clip somewhere and reload it.
> 
> **SA:** Decontamination Wing 6 is quite a distance from the transport depot or your designated containment breach evacuation point. Why were you there?
> 
> **AB:** The explosions had filled a lot of the hallways with rubble and I was trying to get to the containment chamber of SCP-200. It was the only place I could think of that was reasonably secure, assuming that it hadn't been collapsed. Decon 6 was on the quickest path to get there.
> 
> **SA:** How did you recognize V.C. Adams?
> 
> **AB:** I'd seen her in the cafeteria a couple of times before, once with Director Clef, so I figured she belonged. She was headed straight for the doors into Decon, but I stopped her before she went in.
> 
> **SA:** Why was that?
> 
> **AB:** I'd already peeked in there and it was fucking chaos. All safe or euclid class SCPs have to go through it, even if they're well-documented, but it's only supposed to be temporary containment and the explosions must've cracked some of the walls. At least half the chamber doors were open and I saw about 8 or 10 people in what looked like riot gear, piling a ton of shit into some metal boxes. Paperwork, at least one laptop, and I think I saw a birdcage with something moving in it. Their gear didn't have any of the guards' markings on them, so I figured that they weren't part of the Foundation.
> 
> **SA:** What did V.C. Adams do when you told her this?
> 
> **AB:** What do you think she did? She cursed and asked if there was any other way around it.
> 
> **SA:** Was there?
> 
> **AB:** She obviously found one, or we wouldn't be here. I told her to follow me and we took the long way around until we got to the security station outside the Safe Humanoids wing. It took us about 20 minutes, since we had to backtrack a couple of times when we hit blocked hallways or more groups of those riot-gear guys. One time they were carrying something in a body bag that was struggling pretty fiercely.
> 
> **SA:** Did you encounter any SCPs on your way?
> 
> **AB:** Not that I know of. I smelled something burning a couple of times and I was told later that there was a loose SCP made of fire. And when we finally got to the security station outside the Safe Humanoids wing, we found that all the guards had been decapitated and burned. I was almost at SCP-200's chamber, so I gave that distraction SCP to Ms. Adams in case she needed it, and pointed her down to Protective Materials. Assuming that she didn't encounter anything else, she should've been there in about 10 minutes.
> 
> **SA:** After V.C. Adams left you, what did you do?
> 
> **AB:** I went into the Humanoids wing. Unfortunately, it'd been pretty trashed too, although I don't know if it was from the explosions, from the invading force, or one of the escaped SCPs. I do know that when I got to SCP-200's chamber, the door was wide open and the damn cocoon was ripped to shreds. And I couldn't even hole up there because the damn handle was ripped off and the door wouldn't close.

**Interview: Research Assistant Corbette/Site Director ███████:**

> //Portion of Interview Between Research Assistant Corbette and Site Director ███████//
> 
> **<Begin Interview Log>**
> 
> **Site Director ███████:** Corbette! I don't care about how stale your muffin was, get to the point of the explosion.
> 
> **Research Assistant Corbette:** Ok, ok, sorry. So, I'm eating my muffin, right? And suddenly I hear this big boom and there's alarms blaring everywhere and I don't know what the fuck to do, I'm just looking after all the Misters, right? And then I get an emergency memo from the boss, and he says to me, "Evacuate all the Misters." And I mean there's only four of them here right now, so it isn't that hard. So I put down my muffin, and I'm like, "Holy shit guys, we gotta get outta here!"
> 
> **Site Director ███████:** So you were instructed by Dr. Hayward to evacuate his projects?
> 
> **Research Assistant Corbette:** Yeah, so I handcuff Forgetful to myself because, y'know, every 20 seconds he has no idea what the shit is going on. And then I handcuff Chameleon to Hungry, and Moon just kinda hobbles along with us on his cane.
> 
> **Site Director ███████:** And it was a waning moon, so he was missing the majority of his face, yes?
> 
> **Research Assistant Corbette:** Yeah, he could only see through one eye. Everything else was covered.

> 
> **Research Assistant Corbette:** Moon, catch the up! This is an evacuation, you lard-ass!
> 
> **SCP-917:** (Muffled speaking)
> 
> **Research Assistant Corbette:** What?
> 
> **SCP-917:** (Muffled speaking)
> 
> **Research Assistant Corbette:** Ok, does somebody have the braille book. I have no idea what this guy's saying.
> 
> **SCP-913:** He says he can hear gunfire down the evacuation route with his one good ear.
> 
> **Research Assistant Corbette:** Aw, fuck. Ok, guys, we're gonna have to find another way out of here. Um... anybody have a map?

> 
> **0823** Gunfire is audible.

> **0900** Room is empty. Gunfire, screams, and sirens are audible. Feed is stationary.
> 
> **0904** One unidentified person in full body armor enters the room armed with a gun similar to those of the persons visible at **0843**. The gun is pointed at a male in standard humanoid SCP uniform, identified as [[[SCP-890]]]. He is walking in front of the other individual.
> 
> **0905** //SCP-890:// "Alright, where is the patient?"
> 
> **0905** The unidentified individual motions towards the PA system. SCP-890 turns to face the individual.

>

> 
> **0906** //Unidentified Individual:// [inaudible]
> 
> **0906** //SCP-890:// "That's certainly an odd request, but it doesn't seem I don't have a choice. These are hardly ideal conditions, though. The patient will have their voice back, but I can't guarantee that they will live very long afterwards.
> 
> **0907** SCP-890 takes the rag and knife from the individual and approaches the public address system. The PA System is observed to take the form of a mass of human flesh.
> 
> **0908** SCP-890 begins operating on the mass of flesh. The unidentified individual stands facing the door.
