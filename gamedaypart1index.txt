**Excerpt from official after-action report compiled by Dr. Alto Clef regarding Incident 234-900-Tempest Night.**

++++ 0811 to 0813: Initial Contact
 
> At 0811 hours on ██-██-████, multiple containment breaches occured at Humanoid Containment Site-17, caused by multiple explosive devices placed at critical points throughout the facility, placed by a then-unknown party. At this point, the method by which the devices were placed in the facility is unknown, as no security breaches were reported for several months before the incident. The most likely method (internal security breach) may never be proven, as any suborned personnel and/or evidence of their wrongdoing may have been destroyed in the attack.
> 
> One explosive device, placed in Conference Room 9b, resulted in death or injury to several key senior staff members, resulting in the loss of the top three levels of site leadership. This particular device would contribute significantly to the chaos which ensued: due to the severe breakdown in the chain of command, individual Foundation personnel would be forced to respond to the attack without coordination. In most cases, they performed admirably given the situation: especially during the early moments of the attack, when the nature of the containment breach was then unknown.

> 
> **Dr. Honey**: No, sir. Well, I was knocked unconscious by the explosion, as the security footage //clearly// shows.

> **Dr. █████**: Of course.
> 
> **Dr. Honey**: When I came to, 737 had gone. I was inside the observation chamber, so it hadn't seen me, but the guard...oh god. C-can I have a moment?
> 
> **Dr. █████**: I'm afraid I must ask you to continue, doctor.
> 
> **Dr. Honey**: That train had just tunneled right through his head. There was blood everywhere, and there was a suspiciously train-shaped hole in the wall.
> 
> **Dr. █████**: And how did you react to this?
> 
> **Dr. Honey**: I went after it, of course. I thought security would be busy with the explosion, so I grabbed a sheet of copper from the emergency locker and went looking. I thought the explosion was just a minor containment breach. I didn't think it was that bad.
> 
> **Dr. █████**: Understandable.
>

**Excerpt From Debriefing Interview Vang-2**
**Interviewer:** Agent ██████
**Subject:** Dr. Vang, Ph.D.
**Date:** ██/██/20██

> **Agent ██████:** All right, where were you when the attack happened?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** I was asleep in MRI Lab Three, two floors up and about five doors down the hall from where the bombs were. I woke up when they went off, of course.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** What was your initial reaction?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** I just laid there a bit until the gunfire started, then I decided to report to the infirmary to get an amnesiac. You see, the SCP I was working on, some of the initial tests indicate that the symptoms include auditory hallucinations. I figured an amnesiac might fix it.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** I see. Carry on.
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** So, I was approaching an intersection in the hallway when I saw one of our security guards trading fire with someone I couldn't see. It dawned on me that it was all real when the top half of his head got blown up.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** And then?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** I ran the other direction, hid in the closet, and hyperventilated for a while. When I calmed down, I ran back into the MRI lab to get my laptop.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** Why?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** Well, I fell asleep last night before I could log out, and I had neglected to log out when I had woken up, so anyone could have gotten sensitive information off of it. Anyways, when I got back, my laptop was gone, and so was one of the desktops.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** What was on those computers?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** I don't know about the desktop, but my laptop had some of my project files on it. Most of my projects involve abnormal memorability, so about ninety percent of it was just particularly catchy songs. In addition to that, there was a copy of the Communist Manifesto written entirely in pig latin, and there were nine variations of-
> 
> **Agent ██████:** Anything //important//?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** Sorry, sir. One of my USBs had a minute-long clip of [[[SCP-444]]], and my laptop had a photo that makes you dizzy for a minute or so when you look at it. Those are the only things I can think of that would be of any real importance.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** Very good. Now, back to the MRI Lab. What was your course of action?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** Well, I realized that it would be a pretty bad thing if someone attacking the site had four forty-four, considering that a good portion of //our// work with it is weaponization. I looked around, and none of the rooms around me looked like anything was stolen from them, so I figured that whoever took my computer had a good idea of what they were looking for. I heard someone coming, so I ducked into the break room.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** What happened next?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** Whoever it was, they ran past, so I sat down and thought for a minute or so. I went to the fridge, grabbed a bottle of root beer, and broke it. To get a weapon, you know. I changed into my backup pants, then I stuffed my pockets with as many of the emergency ear plugs as I could find and went out to distribute them to our guys.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** Emergency ear plugs?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** It's the memetics department, sir. We go through them like toilet paper.
> 
> > **Agent ██████:** I see. Carry on.

**Excerpt from debriefing of Prof. Anders Bjornsen**

> **Security Agent █████ (SA):** Why were you in the transportation depot when the incident began?
> 
> **Prof. Anders Bjornsen (AB):** I had just been re-assigned to work on [[[SCP-272]]] from [[[SCP-200]]] and was waiting for the transfer team to arrive from SCP-272's previous containment site. I had only skimmed the briefing report, but apparently that site was being re-configured as a secure site for higher-threat-level SCPs.
> 
> **SA:** According to the logs, that security team delivered that SCP and left over 90 minutes before the incident.
> 
> **AB:** //sighs//
> 
> **AB:** Yes, but... well, I was talking with one of the security guards down there about some... personal matters and lost track of time. A good thing, too, or I would've been in my office when it collapsed.
> 
> **SA:** We'll come back to that. Did you notice anything unusual before the incident?
> 
> **AB:** I overheard one of the other guards mention that there had been a lot of SCP deliveries that day, but other than that, no. Well, until the klaxon went off, anyways. Then all the guards started scrambling for the doors into the rest of site.
> 
> **SA:** And what did you do?
> 
> **AB:** What any good boy scout would do: I decided to investigate the SCPs that nobody had yet bothered to pick up. Mighty careless of the researchers of those prospective projects to not collect them, but to my advantage. The first was, luckily, [[[SCP-262]]].
> 
> **SA:** And then?
> 
> **AB:** I went looking for guns.

> 
> **Wachtel:** Would you mind if I didn't, sir? I've got a busted coccyx.
> 
> **O5-█:**  Oh. Well, feel free to not take a seat, then. Where were you when the incident began?
> 
> **Wachtel:** Storage vault two. Was just returning [[[SCP-494 |494]]] to its locker when something exploded a few aisles over and knocked the whole shelf full of lockers down on me. That's when I busted my coccyx.
> 
> **O5-█:** And that's when you decided to put on 494?

> **Wachtel:** I was covered up to my armpits in lockers, and didn't want to be stuck there if something nastier than a bomb came by. I'm just glad I'd had tissues in my breast pocket.

> 
> **Agent Lament** – With...oh, yeah.  I mean, everyone calls it that, it's so...dungeon-y.  Gears has a office down there because he says it's more “efficient” to be close.  He had a lot of items that he was working on there that day.  After we came to from the blast, I could hear...things.  It was like a monkey house for a while, then just...silent.  The silence was almost worse, really, even though some of those noises I KNOW were people being eaten or...worse.  Gears was pretty bad off, but calm as always, even with his leg at that funny angle.  I kinda helped him up, and said we had to book it for the surface, but he said no, that we'd be dead that way.  He...he said there was a secondary access area from this level, in case of high-priority staff being trapped down there, s-
> 
> **O5-4** – Agent Lament, are you telling me a ranking member of The Foundation gave you a order to enter in to a area that was assuredly the subject of a multiple containment breach?

> **O5-4** – Did you or Dr. Gears attempt to contact site security for recovery?  Or use secured lines for a SOS beacon?
> 
> **Agent Lament** – We couldn't.  We tried to call security, and we just saw 106's face grinning on the screen, petting someone's scalp.  The wire weed thing was fogging all the rest of the outside lines, we couldn't reach anyone!  We tried, I swear!  He insisted we had to get moving...you know...waiting for that blast door to open...that was as scared as I've ever been, even after the other stuff.  Just waiting, watching the doors roll apart...

++++ 0813 to 0823: Initial Response.

> The placement of the explosive devices was determined to have damaged the site public address system and major communications leads. In addition to the resulting severe communications breakdown, this prevented detonation of the on-site nuclear device as a final fail-safe.
> 
> The situation was exacerbated by the unusually large number of artifacts in temporary containment at Site-17. Although normally serving as a minimum to moderate security facility for human and humanoid artifacts, an infestation of █████ ████ at Site-19 resulted in the temporary transfer of numerous non-humanoid artifacts of Safe/Euclid classification to Site 17 while decontamination took place.
> 
> The combination of these factors (disruption of command structure, loss of communications, physical damage from explosive devices, unusually large number of artifacts in containment) resulted in multiple containment breaches combined with the loss of the final nuclear fail-safe. The situation was further exacerbated at 0823 hours, when a number of unknown personnel from an unknown agency attacked the facility itself.

**Recovered footage from cell-phone discovered on the body of unknown assailant**

>  Figure identified as Prof. A. Bjornsen enters corridor from transportation depot, wearing SCP-262. The bodies of several guards lay on the ground approximately 10 feet away from the door. Unidentified assailant runs from behind the holder of the cell phone towards Prof. Bjornsen, screaming and brandishing a large knife in each hand. Two (2) cellulose tentacles emerge from SCP-262 and grab weaponry from the bodies of the guards. The tentacles rapidly retreat towards Prof. Bjornsen and two human arms emerge to take the firearms. These arms immediately proceed to fire the weapons indiscrimately. Analysis of the recovered footage reveals that shots fired struck the ceiling, floor, both walls, the oncoming assailant and at least one round grazed Prof. Bjornsen's left cheek. The holder of the cell-phone is apparently wounded by the weaponsfire and drops the cell-phone. Remaining footage is taken approximately twelve (12) centimeters from the base of a wall before ending.

And suddenly I hear this big boom and there's alarms blaring everywhere and I don't know what the fuck to do, I'm just looking after all the Misters, right? And then I get an emergency memo from the boss, and he says to me, "Evacuate all the Misters." And I mean there's only four of them here right now, so it isn't that hard. So I put down my muffin, and I'm like, "Holy shit guys, we gotta get outta here!"

++++ 0823 to 0915: Breakdown

> It is at this point that the situation escalated to a full-out Tempest Night scenario, as multiple containment breaches occured throughout the facility, causing near-complete loss of containment. Ironically, a significant portion of the containment breaches were caused by Foundation personnel themselves, in an attempt to stop the incursion by the unknown hostile force. Secondary containment breaches followed, resulting in the Foundation-Wide Alert Status being upgraded to Red.
> 
> The result was complete loss of situational control. Without a central coordinating authority, individual Foundation personnel were working at cross-purposes, interfering with and even counteracting each others' actions. In at least one case, a Foundation scientist's heroic sacrifice in maintaining containment of a Euclid-Class artifact was immediately rendered null and void when another Foundation researcher immediately breached containment of said artifact with the intent to use it as a weapon against the insurgent forces.
> 
> The situation would continue until the re-establishment of intra-site communications by Secretary Adams. By that point, however, the situation had proceeded past the point of no return. Many of the SCP artifacts had broken through the site lockdown and escaped into the wild. Mission priority then changed from securing the breached artifacts to surviving the crisis.

**Excerpt from debriefing of Prof. Anders Bjornsen**

> **SA:** What were you doing when you encountered Ms. Adams?
> 
> **AB:** I was outside Decon 6, wrestling with one of the arms, trying to pry loose the last of the guns. I'm pretty sure it was already out of ammo, but I didn't want one of the others to pick up a clip somewhere and reload it.
> 
> **SA:** Decontamination Wing 6 is quite a distance from the transport depot or your designated containment breach evacuation point. Why were you there?
> 
> **AB:** The explosions had filled a lot of the hallways with rubble and I was trying to get to the containment chamber of SCP-200. It was the only place I could think of that was reasonably secure, assuming that it hadn't been collapsed. Decon 6 was on the quickest path to get there.
> 
> **SA:** How did you recognize Ms. Adams?
> 
> **AB:** I'd seen her in the cafeteria a couple of times before, once with Director Clef, so I figured she belonged. She was headed straight for the doors into Decon, but I stopped her before she went in.
> 
> **SA:** Why was that?
> 
> **AB:** I'd already peeked in there and it was fucking chaos. All safe or euclid class SCPs have to go through it, even if they're well-documented, but it's only supposed to be temporary containment and the explosions must've cracked some of the walls. At least half the chamber doors were open and I saw about 8 or 10 people in what looked like riot gear, piling a ton of shit into some metal boxes. Paperwork, at least one laptop, and I think I saw a birdcage with something moving in it. Their gear didn't have any of the guards' markings on them, so I figured that they weren't part of the Foundation.
> 
> **SA:** What did Ms. Adams do when you told her this?
> 
> **AB:** What do you think she did? She cursed and asked if there was any other way around it.
> 
> **SA:** Was there?
> 
> **AB:** She obviously found one, or we wouldn't be here. I told her to follow me and we took the long way around until we got to the security station outside the Safe Humanoids wing. It took us about 20 minutes, since we had to backtrack a couple of times when we hit blocked hallways or more groups of those riot-gear guys. One time they were carrying something in a body bag that was struggling pretty fiercely.
> 
> **SA:** Did you encounter any SCPs on your way?
> 
> **AB:** Not that I know of. I smelled something burning a couple of times and I was told later that there was a loose SCP made of fire. And when we finally got to the security station outside the Safe Humanoids wing, we found that all the guards had been decapitated and burned. I was almost at SCP-200's chamber, so I figured that I was almost as safe as I was going to get, and pointed her down to Protective Materials. Assuming that she didn't encounter anything else, she should've been there in about 10 minutes.
> 
> **SA:** After Ms. Adams left you, what did you do?
> 
> **AB:** I went into the Humanoids wing. Unfortunately, it'd been pretty trashed too, although I don't know if it was from the explosions, from the invading force, or one of the escaped SCPs. I do know that when I got to SCP-200's chamber, the door was wide open and the damn cocoon was ripped to shreds. And I couldn't even hole up there because the damn handle was ripped off and the door wouldn't close.
> 
> **SA:** Security camera footage shows that you didn't stay in the Humanoids Wing very long. If you were looking for a safe place to hole up, why did you leave?
> 
> **AB:** Well, like I said, the place was pretty trashed, so it wasn't really any safer than the rest of the Site. Also... I kinda felt responsible for SCP-200, even though I wasn't on that project any more. I'd spent over a year studying it and if it had finally emerged, I sorta wanted to see what it was. If it was moderately harmless, I could hopefully herd it back into containment and if it wasn't... well, I figured I could at least get some observations for the next guy to review.

**Transcript of Containment Breach 13-34 Eyewitness Account Interview**

**Interviewed:** Assistant Researcher Li Huang.
 
**Interviewer:** O5-█ 

**Foreword:** Temporary Containment Area 17-Gamma’s surveillance functions were completely disabled at 0811.  Around 0832, it is estimated that Containment Breach 13-34 occurred at Temporary Containment Area 17-Gamma.  Assistant Researcher Huang was an eyewitness of Containment Breach 13-34 and the immediate aftermath.  

> **O5-█:** Describe the events leading up to Containment Breach 13-34.
> 
> **Huang:** People flocked to 17-Gamma for safety.  The logic was that if it could contain a Keter-class SCP object, then it could protect them from the attackers.  Though communication with the main Site had been disabled, 17-Gamma was believed to be one of the safest places in Site-17.   Basic security had remained uncompromised, and there were plenty of weapons.  At 0823, of course, the attack by—
> 
> //Huang coughs.//
> 
> **Huang:** Excuse me.  17-Gamma came under attack.  Many Foundation personnel, having…collected SCP objects from Site-17, began to use those objects in order to repel the attackers.
> 
> **O5-█:** They intentionally breached containment for those objects?
> 
> **Huang:** Not everybody.  The explosions had already breached containment for some objects, which were just picked up off the ground.
> 
> **O5-█:** Did you do that?
> 
> **Huang:** No.
> 
> **O5-█:** Please continue.  
> 
> **Huang:** The exact details escape me.  However, approximately thirty seconds into the firefight, I became aware of somebody using [[[SCP-399]]] as an enhanced stunner by producing what I presume to be some sort of pressure shockwave. Perhaps unauthorized usage of SCP-914 provided a power source.
> 
> **O5-█:** Do you know exactly how 17-Gamma’s containment unit was breached?
> 
> **Huang:** No.  I didn’t even see it happen.   Maybe a stray grenade caused structural damage. But even if I had seen the breach occur, I wouldn’t have understood the significance.  I didn’t know what 17-Gamma was containing.  I didn’t have the clearance.  I assume that many others were similarly unaware.  In the absence of a chain of command, we simply didn’t know where not to go and what not to do.
> 
> **O5-█:** What happened during Containment Breach 13-34?
> 
> **Huang:** The shockwaves were very loud, which already exacerbated the situation.  However, that alone was not enough to cause the destruction associated with Containment Breach 13-34. I am not entirely certain, but I have my suspicions about what did.  A piece of metal debris that resonated with a shockwave in just the right way, producing a sound quite like a bell...we all know what happened next.  I remember an explosion of wings, and then, nothing.  I woke up a few minutes later.  [[[SCP-469]]] was nowhere in sight.  
> 
> **O5-█:** So Containment Breach 13-34 was the result of unfortunate coincidence?  
> 
> **Huang:** Maybe.  But fifty-two people died in Containment Breach 13-34.  If you wish to attribute that to unfortunate coincidence, that’s your decision, sir.

++++ 0916 to 1103: Disorder

> This period of the crisis can be considered the nadir of the incident: due to complete loss of containment and the presence of the hostile party, Foundation elements were rendered both operational and combat ineffective. Hostile elements had free reign of the facility, and many priceless artifacts were lost. The situation was further exacerbated by a complete release of D-Class personnel when confinement protocols failed. The presence of several hundred hardened criminals in this crisis situation was, to put it mildly, not optimally conducive to maintaining order.
> 
> It is at this point that certain facts about the hostile force became evident. Firstly, the training and skill level of the hostiles were widely disparate: certain elements displayed paramilitary levels of combat and tactical expertise, while others were clearly untrained civilians. Secondly, the goal of the hostile force was not capture, but release of the contained artifacts: although some opportunistic looting took place, escaping SCP artifacts were not pursued, but allowed to escape.
> 
> It is for this reason that I believe that the hostile force were not directed by Marshall, Carter, and Dark: MC&D would not have passed up the opportunity to retrieve several key artifacts that could have proven lucrative to their private efforts. The modus operandi is also inconsistent with the GOC or the Chaos Insurgency: Among other things, the Global Occult Coalition would have simply eradicated the entire site, while the Insurgency would not have passed up the opportunity to capture several easily weaponized artifacts for private use. Although the goals seem consistent with the group called the Serpent's Hand, the brazen nature of the attack (and the lack of SCP-class artifacts among the attackers) are not characteristic of that organization's modus operandi. Further research is required.

**Interview: Agent Izumi J████ ("Enma Ai")**

> **Agent █████**:State your location and assignment at the time of the explosions.
> 
> **Agent Izumi**: [[[SCP-966]]] containment chamber observation room. Surveillance of experiment 966-██, regarding the possibility of sapience in SCP-966 specimens.
> 
> **Agent █████**: Describe what happened following the beginning of the incident.
> 
> **Agent Izumi**: The incident began as the doors to 966 chamber were opened in order to conduct the experiment. The explosions caused a momentary malfunction of the surveillance cameras and light equipment inside the room. Showing previously unknown cognitive capacity, the four 966 specimens contained overwhelmed the security guard in the room, removed his lead-lined helmet and appeared to continuously expose him to their ██████ waves for 10 seconds. As I equipped infrared goggles and entered the room in order to terminate them, the guard began to shout incoherently and shoot in all directions. I dived for cover and waited for his bullets to end. Unfortunately, this brief window of time allowed the four specimens to escape.
> 
> **Agent █████**: The guard didn't hit any of them?
> 
> **Agent Izumi**: He seems to have hit at least one, as I could see splatters and a trail of what I deduced to be blood; it is hard to tell in infrared.
> 
> **Agent █████**: I see. What did you do?
> 
> **Agent Izumi**: I locked the doors to the chamber and followed the blood trail, hoping to find and neutralize the escaped specimens. The explosions still seemed to be going off; one happened approximately 300 meters away from me. After that one, I heard a loud, inhuman scream that was suddenly cut short. Walking in its direction, I verified that two instances of 966 had been killed by the explosion.
> 
> **Agent █████**: And there were no traces of the two remaining specimens?
> 
> **Agent Izumi**: No. There were traces of something else, though. It was hard to notice it because of my goggles, but it was clear what it was once it grabbed my arm.

She proceeds to immediately turn and shoot SCP-106's arm, which maintains his hold on her. After running out of bullets, agent Izumi proceeds to grab a rock and repeatedly hit 106's arm with it. At this point, 106 begins to slowly pull her in the direction of the wall.//

Agent Izumi proceeds to run away from the location, holding the stump remaining from her left arm with her right hand. SCP-106 continues to slowly drag the remains of the agent's arm towards the wall, disappearing after █ minutes.///

> **Flames:**  I was in Laboratory K-13 at the time, working on the new //Capsicum chinense// cultivars I'd obtained from Chelsea, ah, that is, Dr. Elliott.  We had been jokingly calling them Liche Chilis, since they were descended from the more common Ghosts...
> 
> **O5-█:**  Yes, thank you.  And what did you do when the alert happened.  
> 
> **Flames:**  Honestly, I didn't give it much thought.  I sighed, set up the dragon, and went back to work.
> 
> **O5-█:**  Excuse me?
> 
> **Flames:**  Well, they had given me K-13 to work with because it was so remote from everything else, because people kept complaining about eye irritation and their sinuses, so I figured either everything would work out, and I'd be fine, or it wouldn't and the site nuke would go off and there'd be nothing else to do.  So, I went back to work.  
> 
> **O5-█:**  And "the dragon"?
> 
> **Flames:**  My pet name for the fire extinguisher I modified to spray out my Garlic Fission sauce.  It's a delicious sauce, and rates at about 1.7 million Scovilles.  The amusing thing about Garlic Fission is that  gas masks only offer limited resistance.  I like adding it to soup for a little kick.
> 
> **O5-█:**  Yes... continue.
> 
> **Flames:**  About fifty minutes later, I started feeling a little odd.  I felt, I don't know, like my chilis weren't really worth it, and that nothing was.  I recognized it as a possible memetic effect, of course, but I just didn't care.  That was when my door opened, and the insurgent walked in.  
> 
> She was drenched in blood up to her shoulders, and had a look of...  satisfaction, I suppose.  She was enjoying herself, and she held a chef's knife in her hands.  I figured afterwards it was [[[scp-668 |six sixty-eight]]], but I just didn't care enough to do anything about it.
> 
> Fortunately for me, that was when the dragon went off, and sprayed her with the Garlic Fission sauce.  She dropped the knife and my mind cleared, so I brained her with a lab stool.  I did not want her to get back up again, so I grabbed the knife and slit her throat.  She stopped struggling, of course, when I picked up the knife, so I knew it was six sixty-eight.  
> 
> **O5-█:**  I see.  So why did you head to the main cafeteria at that point?
> 
> **Flames:**  Well, I thought it over like this while cleaning up the mess.  I have a knife that will let me kill anyone and stop them from killing me, but only when it's in my hand and I'm actively thinking about mayhem.  I do have a bit of a temper, of course, because I loathe interruptions to my work, and the solution presented itself.  I'd head to the main cafeteria and finally make some good food that the whole site could enjoy.  I had some recipes I'd found online that I'd been wanting to try, and finally I'd be able to use the big ovens to make my grandma's corn bread recipe.  
> 
> I figured it would make a sort of safe haven for people and a bit of a honey pot, because any insurgents show up, I'd be in the kitchen and I could deal with them.  
> 
> **O5-█:**  Sounds...  sketchy.
> 
> **Flames:**  Yeah, I guess so.  But I really wanted to use those ovens, and I thought, when would I have the chance?

++++ 1104 to 1138: Reestablishment of Control

> At approximately 1104, 2 hours and 53 minutes after the beginning of hostilities, Assistant Adams reached Command and Control and re-established site-wide communications. Unfortunately, access to the on-site nuclear device was impossible, due to the destruction of the control leads between C&C and the device (see attached addendum re: proposed modifications to current on-site nuclear destruct systems.)
> 
> Re-establishment of communications would have a profound impact on the course of the crisis. Personnel who had, up until this point, been acting independently with varying degrees of success, could now be coordinated into an effective combat force. With the aid of Assistant Adams, the insurgent attack would be driven back, albeit not soon enough to prevent the escape of several key SCP artifacts.

> {{Post-recovery debriefing of Doctor Gears}}
> {{(excerpt: sections 4-6)}}
> 
> //How were to able to cross the D-9 Level after the mass failure?//
> 
> I was fortunate to be in the company of several Agents and other staff members.  Due to the damage to my leg, arms and internal organs, my mobility was severely restricted.  We proceeded to the emergency access tunnels in the most direct route possible.  Due to SCP-item alteration and damage, however, it was impossible to take any pre-plotted routes.  Several Agents and staff were attacked, harmed and killed during the progression, however we were able to attain the access point with the casualty level well below the acceptable standard.
> 
> //Were you able to observe any SCP escapes or cross-contaimination?//
> 
> I presume yes, however my ability to properly process and catalog this information was limited due to physical trauma.  SCP-106 was observed in the security station and at other locations, and I would assume that its trans-dimensional nature would lead it to escape as a matter of course.  One of the more obvious contaminations was that observed between SCP-682 and SCP-229.  It appears that SCP-229 attempted to attack SCP-682.  SCP-682 appears to have, rather then attack, integrated with SCP-229.  SCP-682 appears to now be deeply integrated with the site information and electrical network.  The ramifications of this have yet to be observed.  More contamination is likely, but it will take more direct and controlled observation to be sure.
> 
> //Did you observe any hostile attackers over the course of the escape?//
> 
> None alive.  Several corpses were observed, belonging to neither Site Staff or Agents, so it is assumed that the aggressors accessed the D-9 level by some means.  One subject did cause a slight complication, however it is unclear as to whether this subject is a aggressor, SCP item, or some other designation.  The subject was large, wearing a suit, gloves, and a rough cloth over its face.  We were attempting to exit the main contamination area, when the subject was observed near a access panel.  It turned to face our group after several Agents requested it to identify itself.  As it faced us, it then reached out and removed a major fuse from the service panel, causing a majority of the hall to go dark.  We were forced to backtrack a great distance to find a replacement for the damage.  When we came back to the same area, the subject was gone, along with several of the corpses in the area.

> **Debriefing:** Dr. Johannes Sorts
> //Excerpt from Interview conducted by O5-█, regarding Dr. Sorts's involvement in Incident 234-900-Tempest Night-1//
> 
> **O5-█:**  You lost control over some of the [[[SCP-945]]] replicas you were attempting to weaponize at various points, correct?
> 
> **Dr. Sorts:**  I was trying to contain them, sir.  I tried steer them towards destroying each other whenever I could, but it was tough using them productively.  Any hostile agent they killed was soon replicated due to exposure.  It's comforting knowing that the day I finally die there's going to be a clay statue showing up in my office to finish my reports, by the way.
> 
> **O5-█:** We're getting off track.  Where were you at 1104 when Adams regained control of communications?
> 
> **Dr. Sorts:**  By that time I was in possession of SCP-945 itself, since it's just an old wooden box.  That put me in position to almost completely account for replicas that were manifesting in the site.
> 
> SCP-945 propagates itself by having the oldest replica create smaller clay figurines representing deceased individuals.  These figurines are placed in the box, and a new replica appears somewhere nearby.  Controlling the small figurines gave me a kill switch over every replica created due to the outbreak.  I had the oldest replica accompanying me, I had the box.  SCP-945 was contained.
> 
> **O5-█:** Containment procedures for 945 specifically forbid breaking new figurines during a containment breach.
> 
> **Dr. Sorts:** [inaudible]
> 
> **O5-█:** You were also observed to remove Dr. S██████'s identification and coat from his body.  Can you explain that?
> 
> **Dr. Sorts:**  I'm just a level 2 memetics researcher.  We get some authority in a meme-related outbreak but the "Action Movie" meme wasn't good enough for exercising long term control over Foundation replicas I encountered on the way down the power room.  So I impersonated Dr. S██████ -- the replicas didn't know enough to tell the difference and he was level 4, so ...
> 
> **O5-█:** Dr. S██████ was one of the individuals responsible for detonating the fail-safe device in the event of a breach like this.  Were you aware of that?
> 
> **Dr. Sorts:**  No, sir.  Well, I'd assume any level 4 had that authority.
> 
> **O5-█:**  Were you aware that Dr. S██████ was also an individual exposed to SCP-945 previously?
> 
> **Dr. Sorts:**  Well, now that you mention it, yes I do recall seeing him on the list of exposed individuals.
> 
> **O5-█:**  Dr. S██████ was one of the first researchers we lost during the attack.  He died in the explosion in the break room.  Therefore it is likely that Dr. S██████'s replica was one of the first to manifest.  And if he was not the first, his replica would have been proceeding to the generators to detonate the fail-safe device personally given the loss of command.  In accordance with his living duty, correct?
> 
> **Dr. Sorts:**  Are you still interviewing me or--
> 
> **O5-█:**  Did you encounter Dr. S██████ in the generator wing, or any other replica that would have been tasked with activating the fail-safe device, and did you or did you not interfere with their work?
> 
> **Dr. Sorts:** [inaudible]
> 
> **O5-█:**  Doctor Sorts, did you or did you not interfere with the activation of the fail-safe device?
> 
> **Dr. Sorts:** [loudly] Of course not!  If I had the chance to nuke my ass out of this fucking job I'd do it in a heartbeat!

**Excerpt from Interview Vang-2**

> **Agent ██████:** So, in the end, your efforts were mostly unsuccessful.
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** Yes, that is correct. Between our guys getting killed anyways and the general inaccessibility of most parts of the facility, I think only seven or eight people actually ended up surviving with their earplugs.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** I see. After you lost the remaining ear plugs, what did you do?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** At that point, I decided that my best bet was to try and bust up the PA System and hope they didn't bring their own ghetto blasters or anything. Plus, after that one time with Dave, I knew a shortcut that wasn't near any of the combat zones.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** Alright. Continue.
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** So I manage to get down to the PA system without incident, except for this fucking... thing. It was like a dude's head got chopped off and just started moving around again, like an octopus or some shit. Needless to say, I punted that down a flight of stairs and kept going.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** What happened when you got to the control room?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** The hallway was actually completely empty, and it was really quiet too, so it was actually scarier than a lot of the stuff I'd seen elsewhere. I suppose because mostly low-level personnel work there, plus there aren't any SCPs stored in that wing. Anyways, the door was open, but there was this pile of body armor just sitting in the doorway, along with a machine gun and a bunch of what looked like old pottery smashed up into bits. I ignored it, although in retrospect it would have been a good idea to at least put on the body armor.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** Go on.
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** Yeah, I walk in and turn towards the PA System, but instead there was this big bloody glob of flesh in its place, and some sweaty dude was working on it with a knife. After I had some dry heaves, I looked again and decided it was probably eight-ninety.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** At the time, what did you know about SCP-890?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** Nothing much, really. That he could operate on machines like they were people, and talked to them and whatnot.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** So what happened next?

**Camera Feed 17-4e, PA System Control Room, ██/██/████**

> **1100** SCP-890 continues to operate on the mass of flesh. The unidentified individual remains stationary, facing the door. Gunfire is faintly audible. Feed is stable.
> 
> **1105** Unidentified individual appears to collapse: a large amount of what appears to be dried clay falls from various openings in the armor, and all clothing and gear fall to the ground. No remains of the unidentified individual are visible. SCP-890 does not respond to this event.
> 
> **1114** Dr. Vang enters the room, stepping over the pile of clay. He looks towards SCP-890 and covers his mouth. He then bends over and starts shuddering. This continues for roughly a minute.
> 
> **1115** //Dr. Vang:// "Hey! 890!"
> 
> //SCP-890:// "Shut up, I'm with a patient."
> 
> **1116** Dr. Vang shoves SCP-890 forward with his hand. SCP-890 turns to face Dr. Vang.
> 
> //SCP-890:// "Sir, I am operating on a patient. Unless someone is dying out there, I suggest for the safety of this patient that you cease this unnecessary disruption."
> 
> //Dr. Vang:// "I can't let you do that, 890. If the enemy gets their hands on any kind of functional public address system, they could completely neutralize the Foundation's fighting force, understand? Now, I need you to stop trying to fix this thing and stand aside so I can destroy it, okay?
> 
> **1117** Dr. Vang raises what appears to be a portion of a glass bottle. 
> 
> //SCP-890:// "I'm afraid that I don't share your sentiments.
> 
> SCP-890 slices Dr. Vang's upper left arm with the scalpel held in his right hand. Dr. Vang stumbles backwards two steps, grunting. The wound is not visible from the camera angle.
> 
> **1118** //Dr. Vang, under his breath:// Son of a-
> 
> Dr. Vang lunges towards SCP-890 with his broken bottle. The two then attempt to injure each other, Dr. Vang with the broken bottle and SCP-890 with the scalpel used in surgery.

**Excerpt from Interview Vang-2**

> **Agent ██████:** ... I gotta say, kid. I've done a lot of things, but I never got into a knife fight with a skip. 
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** Hey, if you had told me a week ago that I'd be stabbing a surgeon with a broken bottle, I wouldn't believe it either.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** Indeed. A few questions, though. Your record doesn't show any form of formal combat training, but I looked over the tapes, and you //decimated// 890. I mean, he was an out-of-shape middle-aged guy, but still. Plus, from what you told me, you either threw up or had a panic attack pretty much every time something bad happened; but you just charged into that fight there. How on earth did you manage that?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** Sir, you've read my file. You know I lived in Minneapolis, and I'm ██ years old, so that means I grew up in the '90s in Minneapolis. Did you know they called it "Murderapolis" back then? It's because of all the murders.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** Go on.
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** Well, I never actually got involved in any of the violence myself, but living where we did, my dad decided that I should learn how to fight, in case the situation ever came up. He was part of the resistance in Laos, real hardcore. Of course, I still got scared pretty much all the time and was a major wuss, but I figured that if it actually came down to getting in a fight, I'd be okay.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** I see. Well, I think we can be done for today. How are you holding up?
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** Fine, I guess. Still sore, though. What did you say I was infected with?
> 
> **Agent ██████:** We're not sure yet. You see, what we think happened was, the PA System was already infected with some sort of virus or worm or had something else wrong with it, and that translated over to an actual disease when 890 started operating on it. He got blood on his scalpel, and then he got the scalpel in you, so... yeah. I can't confirm this, but if your symptoms go where the doctors think they're going, you're probably gonna be classified as an SCP yourself.
> 
> **Dr. Vang:** Heh. I'm probably going to be the first person ever to die of a computer virus.
> 
> **Agent ██████:** I'm sure there are worse ways to go out.

> **Agent █████**: ...
> 
> **Agent Izumi**: Losing a limb made me unable to properly follow the containment breach and hostile mass attack protocols for a short while, sir.
> 
> **Agent █████**: Agent.
> 
> **Agent Izumi**: Sorry, sir. After finishing the tourniquet, which in hindsight seems unnecessary as the corrosion seemed to slow the bleeding, I decided that attempting to re-contain 106 took priority over finding the missing 966 specimens, which had most likely fled into the wild already. So I stumbled towards the dun- I mean, the Security Floor D-9, hoping to find someone that could tell me what was happening, grant me access to the place, and that could help me catch someone that was younger than me to use as lure for 106.
> 
> **Agent █████**: Did you encounter hostiles while on the move?
> 
> **Agent Izumi**: A few, yes.
> 
> **Agent █████**: How did you deal with them?
> 
> **Agent Izumi**: I hid, of course. It is what you pay me to do. Most of the time. Regardless, after some time, I found the body of Agent ██████, with the remains of a large... something... attached to his back, extending to his arm. Really odd thing.  The hallway smelled strangely like feline urine too. Anyway, I grabbed his handgun and timed hand grenades before leaving. As I walked down the corridor, I soon felt the distinct sensation one gets when being hunted, and sure enough, I saw 106's face emerging from the end of the hallway in front of me.

**Video log, Hallway 26, 27, 28: Agent Izumi J████, unidentified woman (presumed hostile), SCP-106**

> ///Transcript begins at ██:██. Agent Izumi enters Hallway 26 on the right side. She gets to near the end of the room before suddenly stopping, turning and running out of view. Seconds later, SCP-106 appears from the north size of the corridor, stopping and phasing through the right wall after reaching the center of the room.//
> 
> //On Hallway 27, agent Izumi is seen running and suddenly coming to a stop as the sounds of footsteps come from the opposite side of the corridor. She throws herself on the ground face up, with her remaining hand holding the handgun on her chest. Few minutes later, an unarmed, unidentified woman enters the left side of the hallway. Upon spotting agent Izumi, she immediately runs towards her, possibly in an attempt to acquire her handgun.//
> 
> //As she gets close, agent Izumi rises and points the gun at her. Panicking, the unidentified woman tries to run. Agent Izumi shoots in her direction twice, with the second bullet hitting the left side of her hip, causing her to fall. Approaching the downed woman, agent Izumi stops for a few seconds to look at her before putting the handgun away, grabbing the woman by the back of her shirt and dragging her to the left side of the hall.//
> 
> //On Hallway 28, agent Izumi is seem dragging the struggling woman down the corridor, stopping in front of an emergency elevator and pressing its button. As the device fails to respond, she continues to press it, with increasing alarm. After a while, she attempts to pry the doors open with her arm, to no avail.//
> 
> //She proceeds to hit the doors twice before suddenly turning her face south. Agent Izumi quickly takes her handgun and shoots the downed woman in the legs twice, causing her to scream, before running out of view on the north size of the corridor. SCP-106 enters the hallway from the south part of the corridor, and proceeds to slowly walk towards the downed woman while dragging its arms on the walls, causing them to rot.//
> 
> //Upon reaching her, SCP-106 [DATA EXPUNGED] slowly dragging the still living woman towards his pocket dimension. As half of her body enters the "portal", agent Izumi is seen quickly running towards it, placing two objects (now known to be grenades) on the body's pants, and running out of view again. 6 seconds later, there is an explosion on the hall, causing the destruction of the camera.///

**Interview: Agent Izumi J████ ("Enma Ai")**

> **Agent █████**: What exactly did you hope to accomplish with that?
> 
> **Agent Izumi**: I hoped to take 106 out of action. As he was actively hunting me, I hope I can be excused for thinking that it was the best idea at the time. It clearly failed to do any damage to him, of course, but I did not see him for the rest of the incident, and thank gods for that. I guess he was having fun with whatever was left of the other woman. Or maybe he found someone younger, I barely fall into the age bracket he seems to show preference.
> 
> **Agent █████**: I see. Was it at this point that you decided to move to the cafeteria?
> 
> **Agent Izumi**: Yes, sir. I figured someone could potentially think of using it as a haven. Of course, that someone could be the hostiles, but I decided to take my chances. I could always hide somewhere else in that case. Fortunately, mister Flames was there. After showing him my badge, I entered the kitchens, found a corner and promptly fell unconscious. It was a while before I managed to wake up.
> 
> **Agent █████**: I see. That is all for now.

**Security Log-█████-3**

> Transcript of conversation between SCP-353 and an unknown person later identified as ███████ ███ a high-ranking member of the “Proponents of Paranormal Rights”.
> 
> **SCP-353:** So… Let me get this straight. You guys are some kind of “supernatural rights group”. 
> 
> **███:** That is correct.
> 
> **SCP-353:** And you want me to join you guys to help free the other “skips” so we can all be part of this “New Freemind Nation” of yours and be one big happy family.
> 
> **███:** That is… also correct, more or less.
> 
> **SCP-353:** And you think I’m going to help you because I’ve been “oppressed by the ignorant masses” or whatever. Is that it?
> 
> **███:** …Not in so many words. Teacher the Liberator sees great potential in you, Vector. He believes that you would be a great asset to our cause were you to use your powers for the side of good, instead of for personal gain.
> 
> **SCP-353:** …Look, I don’t know what kind of drugs you’re on, but I think you’ve got the wrong idea about me. I don’t consider myself a member of some sort of “oppressed minority”. I don’t consider the other ‘skips’ to be my ‘brothers in arms’. And I sure as hell am not going to do charity work for a bunch of tree-hugging hippies.
> 
> **███:** But of course. If money and power are the only thing that makes you tick, we will reward you handsomely for your... your…
> 
> //███ drops his gun, and removes his helmet. Moments later, he begins vomiting repeatedly.//
> 
> **SCP-353:** Ah, good. I was hoping that would work. 
> 
> **███:** W-what…? How did you-
> 
> **SCP-353:** You know what the Ebola virus is? Of course you do, it’s only one of the world’s deadliest diseases. 50% mortality rate, even in a best-case scenario. I’ve spent months working on an a fast-acting airborne strain, and I’m happy to say it has more than exceeded my expectations. 
> 
> //353 tightens her hands around ███’s neck//
> 
> **SCP-353:** Betcha wish you bought the masks that actually worked, didn’t ya?
> 
> //The other insurgents begin pointing their gun at 353. 353 wags her finger at them.//
> 
> **SCP-353:** Oh no. I wouldn’t do that if I were you. You’re ALL infected now, and I’m the only one keeping the virus in check.
> 
> //353 pauses, presumably to let the implications sink in.//
> 
> **SCP-353:** It really is a terrible way to die… do you know what the symptoms of Ebola are?
> 
> //353 takes a step towards the insurgents//
> 
> **SCP-353:** First… you start to have headaches.
> 
> //353 takes a step towards the insurgents//
> 
> **SCP-353:**  Then, you get the chills.
> 
> //353 takes a yet another step towards the insurgents. at this point they begin to start backing away from her.//
> 
> **SCP-353:**  After that comes, vomiting, and then anorexia, and then pharyngitis, diarrhea, hemorrhaging, seizures, hiccups, necrosis… 
> 
> //One of the insurgents attempts to take a shot at 353, only to be subdued by the insurgent standing next to him.//
> 
> **SCP-353:** …and if I’m feeling merciful... //death//.
> 
> //An insurgent slowly puts down his gun, and raises his arms in the air. The other insurgents soon follow suit.//
> 
> **SCP-353:** Good. It looks like we’re on the same page…
> 
> //SCP-353 snaps her fingers, presumably for dramatic effect. Moments later, the insurgent who tried to shoot 353 falls to his knees and puts his hands to his throat to indicate that he is chocking on his own [REDACTED]//
> 
> **SCP-353:** The rest of you work for me now, so hop to it! I want a sample of every virus, bacterium, or fungus that these kooks bother keep locked up. Get going!

**Security Log ██-1**

> There is no movement for thirty (30) seconds before smoke becomes visible rising from the exterior wall. After seven (7) seconds, SCP-737 emerges from the exterior wall. The front carriage of SCP-737 then opens, revealing its biological component. The biological component expels thirteen (13) wooden masses which unfurl into smaller specimens of SCP-737. Original SCP-737 then releases steam from its 'chimney' in what appears to be celebration. Other SCP-737 do likewise before all specimens proceed out of the range of the camera. It is highly likely that SCP-737's -1 through -14 escaped at this point.

**Recovered Footage from Security Cameras B-296 through B-308**
> **1110:** Massive structural failure in Hallway 4. Massive structural failure in Hallway 5. Air filtration systems overwhelmed. Internal structure of section B-1 compromised. 
> 
> **1111:** Hallway 12 collapses. Section B-1 seismic detectors register movement in the debris. Dr. Wachtel, Dr. Dier, Prof. Bjornsen, and Agent [REDACTED] reach junction B-141516. Junction B-141516 lighting fails. Prof. Bjornsen activates flashlight. Agent [REDACTED] activates taclight.  
> 
> **1112:** Prof. Bjornsen directs the light down Hallway 13. [[[SCP-682]]] breaks through the eastern wall of Hallway 13. SCP-682 is heavily infested by [[[SCP-229]]] and is composed primarily of electric cabling, telephone wires and broken circuit boards. Organic portions similar to muscles ooze viscous fluid which, when it drips onto the floor below, burns craters into the concrete. The SCP-229 portions of SCP-682 begin infiltrating nearby electronic cabling. All four Foundation personnel retreat hastily, with Agent [REDACTED] firing at the entity.
>  
> **1113:** Agent [REDACTED] begins reloading. Clouds of dust obscure SCP-682. Its estimated speed is 8 kph. A portion of SCP-229 moves towards the camera. Camera B-298 is disabled.
> 
> **1114:** The four personnel reach Junction B-142623. Dr. Wachtel closes emergency blast doors. Prof. Bjornsen and Agent [REDACTED] illuminate Hallways 26 and 23, revealing they have become choked with debris. Dr. Wachtel suggests that they take inventory of their possessions. Each in turn produces any items they possess that may be of use and briefly describes its properties: Dr. Wachtel with [[[SCP-494]]] and [[[SCP-447]]]; Dr. Dier with a pistol; Prof. Bjornsen with [[[SCP-262]]], [[[SCP-272]]], and a flashlight; and Agent [REDACTED] with an M249 light machine gun.
> 
> **1115:** SCP-229 begins infesting the blast door lock mechanisms. Agent [REDACTED] remarks that she is out of ammunition, and that the entity should reach them in a matter of minutes. Dr. Dier states that he has an idea and begins whispering to the others. 
> 
> **1116:** Agent [REDACTED] and Dr. Wachtel begin clearing Hallway 26. Prof. Bjornsen opens SCP-262, allowing pair of long, semi-transparent arms to be revealed from the interior. Dr. Dier unloads his pistol and retrieves one (1) 9mm bullet, before replacing the cartridge. Prof. Bjornsen puts SCP-494 on the appendages exposed from SCP-262. Prof. Bjornsen places the lead tip of the bullet in one glove of SCP-494. SCP-262's appendages fracture and lift the roof of Junction B-142623. 
> 
> **1118:** Junction B-132623 blast doors begin to open. Agent [REDACTED] hands Dr. Wachtel her sidearm and taclight. Dr. Dier and Prof. Bjornsen move to the wall opposite the blast door.
> 
> **1119:** SCP-682 breaches blast doors. Dr. Dier activates flashlight. Dr. Bjornsen throws SCP-272 into the shadow cast by SCP-682. SCP-272 embeds itself. SCP-682 begins cursing. Large portions of SCP-229 begin to exhibit prehensile activity and grow towards Prof. Bjornsen. Dr. Wachtel opens fire from Hallway 26, severing SCP-229. 
> 
> **1120:** Dr. Wachtel and Dr. Dier flank Prof. Bjornsen from opposite sides, severing SCP-229 instances as they attack. Dr. Wachtel reaches Junction B-132623 and begins strobing taclight, Dr. Dier repeats this pattern. SCP-682 is thrown repeatedly against the northeast wall, abrading roughly 20% of its epidermis. Agent [REDACTED] creates a passage through the debris in Hallway 26.
> 
> **1121:** The roof of Junction B-132623 is transformed into lead. Dr. Wachtel, Dr. Dier and Prof. Bjornsen flee into Hallway 26. The arms extending from within SCP-262 retract. 
> 
> **1122:** Massive structural failure in Junction B-132623.

> //Excerpt from official after-action report compiled by Dr. Alto Clef regarding Incident 234-900-Tempest Night.//
> 
> **1223 to Incident Conclusion**
> 
> At approximately 1223 on the day of the attack, elements from Mobile Task Forces Omega 1 (Blackguards), Omega 2 (Silverfish), and ad-hoc elements of other available personnel, arrived at Site 17. Initial entry into Site 17 was carried out at 1306 hours.
> 
> Upon arrival, reinforcing elements discovered that the majority of the insurgents had already exfiltrated the combat zone, leaving behind seven members (who had been unable or unwilling to exfiltrate the area due to various factors). Unfortunately, this fact was compounded by the heavy number of containment breaches that took place over the course of the day, meaning that MTF personnel were required to both restore containment of escaped artifacts, while dealing with a small but dedicated core of insurgents. 
> 
> Due to these complications, the "clean and sweep" operation would take over four hours and result in several more casualties, including members of the Mobile Task Forces sent to reinforce Site 17. However, the arrival of these reinforcements would prove to be the true turning point of the incident: once the members of these MTFs arrived on the scene, the incident was, for all intents and purposes, as contained as possible, under the circumstances.
> 
> In the end, recovery of basic containment at Site 17 would take another 16 hours, and result in the deaths of several more personnel. Complete site security has not yet been achieved at the time of this writing, due to the heavy number of escapes during the incident. (A list of current SCP infestations has been attached to this document as Addendum TN-4563B.)
> 
> Although a large number of factors contributed to the failures during the Tempest Night incident, one key factor seems to predominate: the loss of control and communications. Due to the inability to effectively coordinate efforts, what could have been a severe but containable breach turned into multiple containment breaches of dangerous artifacts. The simple fact remains that, for a period of three hours during the incident, there was no central command authority at Site 17. Individual persons were forced to act as they saw best, with no leadership or directives to guide them.
> 
> The way these persons reacted when on their own is disturbing as well. In multiple cases, individuals, believing themselves to be the only ones standing between the world and a full-on containment breach, took desperate measures in order to combat what they percieved as a deadly threat. This was compounded by the aforementioned lack of communication, which meant that incomplete and inaccurate data was provided to the persons involved. The situation has been likened to a group of desperate men lost in the wilderness and resorting to cannibalism, only to discover that they were a half-day's walk from civilization the entire time.
> 
> The situation was compounded by the culture of hero-worship among the lower-ranks personnel. Every organization, over time, develops a culture and a "mythology" of stories about famous incidents from their history. Whether by coincidence or design, the majority of the Foundation's "mythology" and culture has focused on glorifying the more grandiose events from our past, as well as certain irresponsible behaviors that, thankfully, never resulted in the catastrophic consequences that could have resulted. When faced with an emergency, these persons understandably fell back to the stories that had become part of their culture, and took actions that coincided with this mindset.
> 
> The results, I believe, are plain to see.

> 
> True, but someone pulled a fast one on us.  That does not happen.  Ever.  Yet somehow, someone armed this group and trained them to the point where they were able to drop a containment site totally off grid, and cripple The Foundation communication relay for a significant period of time.  What happens if the puppet master turns his gaze on us?
> 
> //Randal, I hardly think this-//
> 
> I know, it is unlikely...but that is not even my foremost concern.  Our members expect the world from us, normal reality and laws of physics be damned.  We sometimes need those items to meet those requests.  Which is easier, the corruption of staff and eventual theft of a item in containment, or the time, energy, lives, and most of all, money expended in the tracking, capture, containment, and study of these items?
> 
> //...You have shown me the light, Randal.  Cheeky, but still valid.  I'll see if I can rouse the old fellow, get him to sign off on an open contract.  I don't think we need to tip a hand yet, but maybe we can get those Americans...what are they, blackwood...blackburn...oh dash it, that mercenary firm...//
> 
> Blackwater, ma'am?
> 
> //Yes, that's it!  I think Marshall may own the staff...or maybe that's Howard, on the board...dash it, one of the two.  We'll get some people on the ground, keep an eye on things...if it all goes tail-up, at least we can collect a bit off the corpse before the scavengers move in.  I think someone should post Dark anyway, keep him abreast of things.//
> 
> I...am not sure he's alive, Mrs. Carter.

> We are still coming back on-line from the attack, however we will be unable to join the larger Foundation network, or connect to anything off-site.  The cross-contamination between 682 and 229 has lead to a near-total infection of the on-site network.  Thus far, it doesn't seem that either of these items have actually attacked the network, however they are eating up a ton of bandwidth and energy.
> 
> To my knowledge, this is the first time 682 has escaped and not gone on a blind rampage.  I'm concerned that this is a prelude to something very, very bad...a calm before the storm, if you will.  Thus far, we've sealed the site network, and shielded against any ingoing or outgoing signals, but there's not much else we can do.  The connections extend everywhere...just waiting for something.
> 
> The physical SCP are down on the D-9 level, and we've pretty much lost control of that.  The area is too hot to send normal staff to, and all the MTF are running around after the escaped SCP.  There are reports of some bad cross-contamination, and 106 has been picking off around one staff member a day.

> **A. Clef:** "He's in the next wing over. Multiple compound fractures. He was stuck there for over forty-eight hours screaming in pain before someone managed to find him. Gangrene maybe set in on his legs. Hopefully the docs can regrow them."
> 
> **█. ████████:** "I'll bring him a pair of running shoes. He'll love that."

> **A. Clef:** ". . ."
> 
> **█. ████████:** ". . . All right, talk. What's wrong?"
> 
> **A. Clef:** "We did that to him."
> 
> **█. ████████:** "Bullshit. We didn't push him off that ledge, and we didn't order him to either. Hell, you didn't even tell him to fight that SCP. He did that on his own."
> 
> **A. Clef:** "He did it because we did it first."
> 
> **█. ████████:** "He was a four-year newbie. We've been doing this all our lives. He was in over his fucking head."
> 
> **A. Clef:** "He should never have tried. We set a bad example for him."
> 
> **█. ████████:** "What are you, his mommy? Gonna change his diaper and feed him his bottle? He was an adult. He made a fucking choice, and he fucked up. I'm not gonna lose any sleep over it."

> **A. Clef:** "Did you know the incidence of mental illness among Foundation personnel is going up? It used to be you had to be a ten, fifteen year man before you started getting downchecks for psyche. Now we're getting second-year rookies getting red-marked. Glass thinks it's because they're not trying to fight it any more. He's not sure why, but I know. It's because of you and me. These kids, they look at you and me and Gears and think, "These guys are nuts. Maybe it's okay for me to be." And they just. . . go over the deep end. They don't even try to stay sane."

> **█. ████████:** "What, you're trying to blame this all on me? Fuck you. I do what I have to do to save the world. If I want to have fun along the way, then who the fuck can tell me otherwise? There's too much at stake here to worry about being a nice or responsible person. Someone wants to flip out and eat dog shit or try to fuck a goat, who cares, as long as they do the fucking job? If you can't see that, then maybe you need to get the fuck out."
> 
> **A. Clef:** "Maybe I do."
> 
> **█. ████████:** ". . . well, I'm not wasting a good gift on an emo faggot like you. Give me those rollerblades, I'm gonna give them to Gerald."
> 
> **A. Clef:** "Yeah, you do that, ███████."
> 
> **█. ████████:** "Fuck you too, buddy."
