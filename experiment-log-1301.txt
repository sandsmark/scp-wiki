**Test 1**
**Date:** ██/██/20██
**Operator:** ██████ ███████
**Procedure:** After donning the provided noise containment suit, Mr. ███████ entered the chamber, removed SCP-1301-1 and SCP-1301-2 from their soundproof box, and began operation.
**Music:** Simple improvisation in A major, 4/4 meter.
**Results:** 1 minute and 3 seconds into operation, SCP-1301-1 entered its first observed anomalous state and produced high-pitched screaming for 1.4 seconds at a frequency exceeding ████ Hz. Approximately 0.6 seconds after the anomalous state commenced, Mr. ███████ dropped SCP-1301-1 and SCP-1301-2 in surprise, causing it to abruptly enter its active state upon contact with the ground. Vibrations successfully pierced Mr. ███████'s noise containment suit. After contamination, Mr. ███████ was taken to █████ for further study. Despite mistreatment by Mr. ███████, SCP-1301-1 and SCP-1301-2 were unharmed.

**Test 7**
**Date:** ██/██/20██
**Operator:** ██████ ████
**Procedure:** After donning the provided noise containment suit, Ms. ████ entered the chamber, removed SCP-1301-1 and SCP-1301-2 from their soundproof box, and began operation.
**Music:** The violin solo from [[[SCP-012]]]'s first movement.
**Results:** During operation by Ms. ████, SCP-1301 rendered the piece in a shrill, unsteady cackle, emitting harmonizing frequencies below ██ Hz. The object produced intelligible speech during operation, including references to [DATA EXPUNGED]. The information provided might bear relevance to SCP-████. Ms. ████ ceased operation of SCP-1301-1 with SCP-1301-2 at 46 seconds, gingerly replaced both objects into the box, and immediately fled from the chamber in a state of hysteria. Ms. ████ was subsequently administered a Class A amnestic and has since demonstrated no significant psychological scarring.

**Test 9**
**Date:** ██/██/20██
**Operator:** ██████ ████
**Procedure:** After donning the provided noise containment suit, Mr. ████ entered the chamber, removed SCP-1301-1 and SCP-1301-2 from their soundproof box, and began operation.
**Music:** Scrap of notation from Mr. ███████, written following the events of Test 1.
**Results:** SCP-1301-1 rendered the notation as intelligible speech in Mr. ███████'s voice. Transcript follows: //"Please get me-- Oh, God! Why can't I write?!"//
