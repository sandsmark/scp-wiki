**Item #:** SCP-5955

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the size and physical properties of SCP-5955, complete containment has been deemed impossible, but partial physical containment is being upheld. To that end, a loose perimeter has been set up around SCP-5955 using buoys.

On the night of July 3rd, from 20:00 to 05:00, the lights of the establishments on the Atlantic City boardwalk are to remain off in order to avoid degrading SCP-5955-1 instances. Oceanic Task Force Delta-7 ("Bay Watchers") are to deter any civilian ships away from the mass of SCP-5955 and supplied with Standard Cover Story 51 - "Intensive Weather".  OTF Delta-7 are to guide SCP-5955-1 instances away from the coast of Atlantic City, New Jersey to ensure civilian safety. Efforts to repurpose SCP-5955-1 instances for Foundation use are currently underway.

For the remainder of the year, SCP-5955 must be "fed" two thousand kilograms of plastic, styrofoam, discarded fishing gear, and other refuse every two weeks. Any notable shrinkage in SCP-5955's mass is to be reported to the Site-45 director. Depending on the amount of mass lost, anywhere from one to four additional unmanned trash boats are to be set on a collision course with the area SCP-5955 resides. Recovery of these boats should be performed if possible. Two Scranton Reality Anchors ("SRAs") are to remain on opposite sides of SCP-5955's perimeter to disable SCP-5955's anomalous magnetism, and to ensure anomalous weather behavior does not occur. SCP-5955 must weigh at least four tons to ensure its primary ability properly disables. If SCP-5955 weighs any less than four tons at any time, its primary ability will re-enable regardless of SRA presence.

**Description:** SCP-5955 is a large sphere composed of human flesh. For the majority of the year, SCP-5955 remains hidden underwater. Despite this, SCP-5955 attracts refuse within a radius of about thirty meters to itself, suctioning the collected waste under water. Each year on July third from 20:00 to 05:00 UCT, SCP-5955 will rise from beneath the water, remaining stationary in the air.

During this period, a collection of autonomous mechanisms composed of various waste materials (designated SCP-5955-1) will emerge from SCP-5955. SCP-5955-1 instances vary in appearance, although all instances to date appeared to resemble different wildlife native to Atlantic City. A list of specific SCP-5955-1 instances is available upon request. 

After emergence, SCP-5955-1 instances begin to roam the coast within 150 kilometers of Atlantic City and collect foreign materials from the surrounding area. In the presence of artificial light, SCP-5955-1 instances will begin to rapidly degrade. This causes SCP-5955 to produce instances at a rapid rate, and expand its magnetism to 100 meters. Before SCP-5955-1 instances return to SCP-5955, at least one will use collected refuse to spell out a message on the boardwalk. After SCP-5955-1 instances complete refuse collection at 4:55, they will transport discovered materials beneath SCP-5955. SCP-5955 will then absorb collected refuse and SCP-5955-1 and re-submerge beneath the ocean surface.

**Addendum:** SCP-5955 Yearly Behavior

The following records notable behavior during SCP-5955's years of activity.

||~ Year||~ Notable Behavior||~ SCP-5955-1 Messages ||
|| 1975 || First year of activity. || The turtles appreciate your effort! Please pick this up now! ||
|| 1986 || SCP-5955 discharges a small amount of mucus. || Trash is icky. Please pick this up now! ||
|| 1990 || SCP-5955's anterior appears slightly swelled. || I want the beaches pretty! Please pick this up now!||
|| 1994 || SCP-5955's epidermis gains a few dry rashes. || Fishies want your help! Please pick this up now!||
|| 1996 || SCP-5955's posterior appears slightly swelled. || Cigarettes are gross. Please pick this up now!||
|| 1999 || All of the previous changes to SCP-5955 are not present. || Thanks to those who keep the beaches pretty! ||
|| 2001 || SCP-5955 discharges a significant amount of mucus. || Please help! The ocean needs you! ||
|| 2004 || SCP-5955's epidermis appears pale. || The garbage is icky. ||
|| 2006 || A small collection of blisters forms on SCP-5955's posterior. SCP-5955 is slightly smaller than normal; its size returns when supplied with additional refuse by Delta-7 operatives.|| Thanks for helping me with the trash! I thought you gave up ||
|| 2010 || SCP-5955's epidermis is dry and cracked. || The ocean needs you! ||
|| 2012 || SCP-5955's epidermis is pale red. SCP-5955-1 instance production doubles. || The ocean needs you please ||
|| 2013 || SCP-5955's epidermis is pale green. || Why can't you help ||
|| 2014 || SCP-5955's epidermis is swelled. SCP-5955 emits a putrid odor. || Do you not like me I just want to help ||
|| 2015 || SCP-5955 begins to undergo putrefaction, and its magnetism disables. || Your help is needed ||
|| 2016 || SCP-5955 appears unchanged. It produces a notably smaller amount of SCP-5955-1 instances. || Please help ||
|| 2017 || SCP-5955 is now significantly smaller; its size does not grow when supplied with additional refuse. While it absorbs the collected refuse, pieces of the collection fall out of SCP-5955. || Please ||
|| 2018 || SCP-5955 produces approximately a dozen SCP-5955-1 instances. || Please ||
|| 2019 || SCP-5955 is unable to absorb the collected trash. || Please ||
|| 2020 || SCP-5955 does not produce SCP-5955-1. It remains stationary in the air. || N/A ||

SCP-5955 has not reemerged, nor shown any signs of activity. Re-classification to neutralized is pending.
