**Item #:** SCP-2199

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2199 is held within a standard Wildlife Observation Chamber, located within Site-77. It is fed a normal diet of vegetation. Listening devices are attached to the hump on a permanent basis, in order to observe the interior of its body. Any notable sounds produced by SCP-2199-1 are noted and archived. Exploratory testing has been suspended, due to the effect that repeated testing had on SCP-2199's health.

**Description:** SCP-2199 is an adult male Indian Camel (//Camelus dromedarius//). It is 1.9 meters tall and weighs 497 kilograms. The hump is hairless, and has the appearance of being covered in scar tissue. However, this tissue is biologically identical to the rest of SCP-2199.

Instead of being completely composed out of tissue fibers, the hump on SCP-2199's back is filled with water underneath a 10cm layer of hairless fibrous tissue. This water is brackish, self-replenishing, and inhabits an area roughly equivalent to the total biomass of SCP-2199 [[footnote]]This is despite SCP-2199 containing normal internal organs[[/footnote]]. Despite the absence of any corresponding light sources, it contains ambient light. 

Living creatures, including plants and a large amount of small organisms classified as SCP-2199, inhabit this hump. Instances of SCP-2199-1 all appear to be small versions of desert animals, altered to act as aquatic organisms. While being superficially similar to their desert counterparts, all of these instances are between 2-10 cm in length, and this size does not correspond with the size of the animal in nature. Due to the fact that SCP-2199 must be placed under anesthetics and the hump surgically opened, observation of SCP-2199-1 has been limited.

When outside of SCP-2199's hump, it is possible to hear sounds corresponding to each of the observed SCP-2199-1 species. These sounds have been used to keep track of the SCP-2199-1 population, and to prevent any damage to SCP-2199 due to invasive testing.

||||||~ Known organisms from within SCP-2199.||
||~ Animal ||~ Appearance/Behaviors ||
|| Bark Scorpion || Appears to be virtually identical to a normal scorpion, without legs. Flicks its tail rapidly in order to move forwards, and keeps its posture in a manner similar to a seahorse. || 
|| Ostrich || Usually 3-4cm long, with two long tails and a small, rotund body. Propels itself forward by spinning around quickly and flinging themselves to where they want to be. Appears to feed primarily on small vegetation it can intercept while in motion. ||
|| Meerkat || Observed only once during testing, and rarely during audio observation, this organism appears to live at the bottom of SCP-2199. All observed specimens have been 2cm in length, and appear to dwell within the waste products which gradually accumulate at the bottom of SCP-2199, using it for food and shelter. ||
|| Texas Horned Lizard || Resembles only the head of the lizard, with significantly more spikes and no obvious fins or means of locomotion. Moves around by firing its tongue onto prey, and pulling itself towards the prey so that it may consume them. Tongue has a range of 10cm. ||
|| Black Widow || Has a body structure of one large spider body, with several hundred long and soft legs, used to propel its body around like a jellyfish. The "red hourglass" design on its abdomen is luminescent, and designed to attract prey into its legs, whereupon the large mouth located with the legs will poison and eat the prey. Feeds primarily on other black widows and scorpions. ||

SCP-2199 was discovered outside of Cairo, Egypt, in an abandoned desert ruin, with two near-human skeletons. In addition, the ancient remains of several other animals were discovered. The identified specimens include a horse, crocodile, abnormally large birds, and whale bones. The following script was found etched into the wall, translated from Latin.
