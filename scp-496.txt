[[/div]]

**Item #:** SCP-496

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-496 is currently restricted to a 200 square meter area around GPS coordinates 21.6█████, -71.8█████ in the Caribbean Sea, near the location of its discovery.--  SCP-496 is housed in a standard cell in Site-██.  Personnel possessing highly confidential information should avoid SCP-496 due to the risk of telepathic security breach.  Personnel coming into contact with SCP-496 must submit to weekly psychological evaluations during and for 2 months after the period of contact.  The entity is active only when in contact with the sea floor.

**Description:** SCP-496 is composed primarily of calcium carbonate in the form of deceased coral.  Radiocarbon dating indicates that this coral is approximately 5,200 years old.  A smaller mass of magnetized metal has been detected in the torso, but its composition is not yet known.  A thin layer of fresh, living coral and other organisms currently coat most of its exterior.  It is humanoid in form and is capable of movement in accordance with traditional humanoid joints.  How this occurs without breaking the calcium carbonate material is still under investigation, but appears to result from changes in the molecular structure, allowing for freedom of motion and considerable strength.

The entity has exhibited a high-subhuman level of consciousness.  It is self-aware and can communicate effectively through seemingly telepathic means.  However, it has little concept of the future or past and no awareness of death or non-existence.  Its emotional range appears to be restricted to simple happiness and disappointment.  SCP-496 was discovered by field agents investigating a mysterious drowning (in which the victim was found with severe lacerations on the wrists) and reports of unusual activity in the waters just off of the Caicos islands.  

Agent █████ has established communication with the entity, but reports that it is difficult, as the telepathic exchange is primarily in pictures, sounds, and abstract concepts.

**Addendum 1:**

>  **Interview Log 496-A**
>  
>  **Interviewed:** Agent █████
>  
>  **Interviewer:** Dr. Evers, head researcher aboard the Foundation research vessel ██.
>  
>  **Forward:**  As communication with SCP-496 is not through words and cannot be perfectly transcribed, a transcript of Dr. Evers' interview with the Agent is provided instead.
>  
>  **<Begin Log, [June 7, 20██]>**
>  
>  **Dr. Evers:**  You interrogated SCP-496 regarding the death of the unidentified diver.  Can you describe its response?
>  
>  **Agent █████:**  Yes.  But first I'd like to note that it has a very powerful ability to experience simple emotions, and to convey those to others.  I was... apprehensive about encountering it at first, but was quickly filled with feelings of warmth and happiness as I got closer.
>  
>  **Dr. Evers:**  Noted.
>  
>  **Agent █████:**  Right.  So, as instructed, I inquired about the victim by recalling posthumous photos of the deceased and attempting to convey curiosity and confusion.  The object was very responsive.  SCP-496 immediately filled my mind with images of the victim diving near it.  The feelings associated with the images were overwhelmingly positive.  The victim approached SCP-496, but suddenly turned to leave.  At this point it grabbed the man's wrist and...
>  
>  **Dr. Evers:**  Yes?
>  
>  **Agent █████:**  Then I saw the man's family, he had a little girl.  His last thoughts were seen by SCP-496 as it held him underwater.  It was confused, it didn't want the man to leave.  I don't think it understood why he couldn't breathe underwater.  The feelings it conveyed to me must have been a combination of the confusion it experienced and the horrified panic the victim experienced.  It felt like dying.  I feel... never mind.
>  
>  **Dr. Evers:**  What other information were you able to obtain?
>  
>  **Agent █████:**  [the Agent sighs audibly]  I successfully conveyed the concept of origin and curiosity with reference to SCP-496.  It responded with extravagant images of stone structures, roads, and a vibrant harbor community.  SCP-496 never left the water, but interacted with people constantly.  The place had the feel of ancient Greece, but I wouldn't know if that's where it was or not.  The emotions he associated with it made it seem like utopia.  I saw myself there, with the warm ocean breeze flowing over my face.  I didn't understand the words, except for Andel, I was Andel...  But things changed for him.
>  
>  **Dr. Evers:**  Him?
>  
>  **Agent █████:**  496.  The buildings crumbled and the ocean engulfed the remaining structures.  There were other statues like... like SCP-496, but they were destroyed by the event.  It felt sorrow and loneliness.  There was nothing but blackness and wandering, until he found me.  I don't think he knows anything else about his past... but you should go see him sometime, if you're curious.  I know he could use the company.
>  
>  **<End Log>**
>  
>  **Closing Statement:**  Agent █████ placed on mandatory on-site leave, pending psychological evaluation.


**Addendum 2:**
SCP-496 has been transferred to Site-██ for permanent containment.  The minimal information obtained from communication is outweighed by the high cost of providing security on the open ocean.  SCP-496 deactivated upon removal from the ocean and should require minimal containment efforts henceforth.


**Addendum 3:**
Analysis of Incident 496-4 has determined the drowning death of Agent █████ to be accidental.  Witnesses report that she claimed her name was "Andel" and that she was "going home".  Researchers are advised to consider SCP-496 a Class-2 Cognitohazard when the object is active, pending further investigation.
