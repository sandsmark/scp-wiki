[[/div]]

**Item #:** SCP-496

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**
SCP-496 is currently restricted to a 200 square meter area around GPS coordinates 21.6█████,-71.8█████ in the Caribbean Sea, near the location of its discovery.  Monitoring and electronic tracking is currently the responsibility of the vessel ██, under direction of the local office.  SCP-496 has been compliant with instructions to remain in this area and no further containment is yet required.  Personnel posessing highly confidential information should avoid SCP-496 due to the risk of telepathic security breach.  Personnel coming into contact with SCP-496 must submit to weekly psychological evaluations during and for 2 months after the period of contact.  The entity may be removed from the sea floor.  However, after losing physical contact with the sea floor it becomes inactive immediately.

**Description:**
SCP-496 is composed primarily of calcium carbonate in the form of deceased coral.  Radiocarbon dating indicates that this coral is approximately 5,200 years old.  A smaller mass of magnetized metal has been detected in the torso, but its composition is not yet known.  A thin layer of fresh, living coral and other organisms currently coat most of its exterior.  It is humanoid in form and is capable of movement in accordance with traditional humanoid joints.  How this occurs without breaking the calcium carbonate material is still under investigation, but appears to result from changes in the molecular structure, allowing for freedom of motion and considerable strength.

The entity exhibits a high-subhuman level of consciousness.  It is self-aware and can communicate effectively through seemingly telepathic means.  However, it has little concept of the future or past and no awareness of death or non-existance.  Its emotional range appears to be restricted to simple happiness and disappointment.  SCP-496 was discovered by field agents investigating a mysterious drowning (in which the victim was found with severe lacerations on the wrists) and reports of unusual activity in the waters just off of the Caicos islands.  

Agent █████ has established communication with the entity, but reports that it is difficult, as the telepathic exchange is primarily in pictures, sounds and abstract concepts.

**Addendum 1:**
Note:  As communication with SCP-496 is not through words and cannot be perfectly transcribed, a transcript of Dr. Endel's interview with the Agent is provided instead.
__Communication Report (Agent █████, Dr. Endel) June 7, 20██__ 


**Dr. Endel**:  Your assignment was to initiate contact with SCP-496 and interrogate it regarding the death of the unidentified diver.  Can you describe its response?

**Agent █████**:  Yes.  But first I'd like to note that it has a very powerful ability to experience simple emotions, and to convey those to others.  I was... aprehensive about encountering it at first, but was quickly filled with feelings of warmth and happiness as I got closer.

**Dr. Endel**:  Noted.

**Agent █████**:  Right.  So, as instructed, I inquired about the victim by recalling posthumus photos of the deceased and attempting to convey curiosity and confusion.  It worked well.  SCP-496 immediately filled my mind with images of the victim diving near it.  The feelings associated with the images were overwhelmingly positive.  The victim approached SCP-496, but suddenly turned to leave.  At this point it grabbed the man's wrist and...

**Dr. Endel**:  Yes?

**Agent █████**:  I saw the man's family, he had a little girl.  His last thoughts were seen by SCP-496 as it held him underwater.  It was confused, it didn't want the man to leave.  I don't think it understood why he couldn't breathe underwater.  The feelings it conveyed to me must have been a combination of the confusion it experienced and the horrified panic the victim experienced.  It felt like dying.  I feel... nevermind.

**Dr. Endel**:  What other information were you able to obtain?

**Agent █████**:  [the Agent sighs audibly]  I successfully conveyed the concept of origin and curiosity with reference to SCP-496.  It responded with extravagant images of stone structures, roads, and a vibrant harbor community.  SCP-496 never left the water, but interacted with people constantly.  The place had the feel of ancient Greece, but I wouldn't know if that's where it was or not.  The emotions he associated with it made it seem like utopia.

**Dr. Endel**:  He?

**Agent █████**:  SCP-496.  But then the buildings crumbled and the ocean engulfed the remaining structures.  There were other statues like... like SCP-496, but they were destroyed by the event.  It felt sorrow and loneliness.  There was nothing but blackness and wandering, until he found me.  I don't think he knows anything else about his past... but you should go see him sometime, if you're curious.  I know he could use the company.
__End of Communication Report__

**Addendum 2:**
SCP-496 is to be dismantled on ███ 12, 20██.  It is economically unfeasible to provide security in open water, and the entity shuts down completely when removed.  Since communication provided no useful information, cracking the coral "body" and reverse engineering the metal core will certainly prove more valuable to the Foundation.

----

**Addendum 3:**
Following the incident aboard the ██, Agent █████ has been demoted to Class D and transfered to Site ██.  Emotional involvement in Foundation affairs is unacceptable in any case.  When this escalates to insubordination and striking a superior, severe punishment can be expected.  We secure, contain, and protect.  We do not run an adoption agency for orphaned statues.
