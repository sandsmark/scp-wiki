**Item #:** SCP-496

**Object Class:** --Safe-- Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-496 is is to be held in an aquatic containment unit, located in Site-77's Euclid SCP wing. Personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher are to be denied any direct access to SCP-496's containment unit. Level 1 personnel who work directly with SCP-496 must submit to weekly psychological evaluations during and for 2 months after the period of contact.  

**Description:** SCP-496 is an immobile humanoid figure, composed primarily of calcium carbonate in the form of deceased coral. It is exactly 1.3 meters tall and weighs 296 kilograms. Radiocarbon dating indicates that it is at least 1,200 years old. Analysis indicates that SCP-496's interior is dead, with a thin layer of fresh, living coral and other organisms coating most of its exterior. These organisms have survived perpetually for the ██ years SCP-496 has been in containment.

SCP-496 has exhibited a high-subhuman level of consciousness. It is self-aware, but is unable to grasp the concepts of time, life, or death. SCP-496 has a limited emotional range, with moods ranging between benign happiness and mild disappointment. SCP-496 is able to communicate via a telepathic force. Subjects approaching SCP-496 will experience short-term memory loss, emotional outbursts, and claim to see memories they have not experienced.

As the subjects spend more time in proximity with SCP-496, they will begin to form close emotional attachments with it. They will attempt to spend as much time as possible conversing with SCP-496. Psychological analysis has shown that --exposure to SCP-496 has the result of improved memory, disposition, and an increase in productivity-- continuous exposure to SCP-496 has a negative effect. Researchers are advised to consider SCP-496 a Euclid-level cognitohazard, pending further investigation. Subjects exposed to SCP-496 will eventually become obsessed with its nature, attempting to expose themselves to it as often as possible. 

In addition, a large number of personnel who were exposed to SCP-496 have died of self-inflicted causes, primarily drowning. Currently, ██ personnel are suspected to have died while exposed to SCP-496's effect. A report on this phenomenon --can be accessed in Addendum 496-A-- has been removed for security purposes, but is available to personnel with Level 4 clearance or higher.

SCP-496 was discovered by field agents investigating a mysterious drowning, in which the victim was found with severe lacerations on the wrists, and reports of unusual activity in the waters just off of the Caicos islands. Agent █████ established communication with SCP-496, but has reported that it is difficult, as the telepathic exchange is primarily in pictures, sounds, and abstract concepts. SCP-496 has been contained as of 08/19/1976, and classified as Safe.

**Addendum 496-5:**

>  **Interview Log 496-A**
>  
>  **Interviewed:** Agent █████
>  
>  **Interviewer:** Dr. Evers, head researcher aboard the Foundation research vessel ██.
>  
>  **Forward:**  As communication with SCP-496 is not through words and cannot be perfectly transcribed, a transcript of Dr. Evers' interview with the Agent is provided instead.
>  
>  **<Begin Log, [June 7, 20██]>**
>  
>  **Dr. Evers:**  You interrogated SCP-496 regarding the death of the unidentified diver. Can you describe its response?
>  
>  **Agent █████:**  Yes. But first I'd like to note that it has a very powerful ability to experience emotions, and to convey those to others.  I was... apprehensive about encountering it at first, but it wasn't difficult. It's very conversational for something with no mouth.
>  
>  **Dr. Evers:**  Noted.
>  
>  **Agent █████:**  Right.  So, as instructed, I asked about the dead guy. That brought a pretty strong response.  SCP-496 immediately filled my mind with images of the victim diving near it. The feelings associated with the images were overwhelmingly positive. The guy approached it, but as he got closer and saw what he was looking at, panicked and suddenly turned to leave. Then grabbed his wrist...
>  
>  **Dr. Evers:**  Yes?
>  
>  **Agent █████:** It saw the man's family. He... he had a young girl, probably two or three years old. The last thoughts he had were seen by 496 as it drowned him.  It was confused... I don't think it understood why he was struggling.  The emotion that it conveyed to me must have been a combination of the confusion it experienced, and the panic...
>  
>  **Dr. Evers:**  What other information were you able to obtain?
>  
>  **Agent █████:**  [sighs audibly]  I tried to think thoughts of origin, and beginnings. It responded with extravagant images of stone structures, roads, and a vibrant harbor community. The place had the feel of ancient stuff, with columns and marble, a kinda "Roman" feeling.  The emotions he associated with it made it seem like his version of heaven. I saw him sitting on a beach or something, but he... had my face.  I didn't understand the words, except for Andel. I was Andel...  But things changed for him.
>  
>  **Dr. Evers:**  Him?
>  
>  **Agent █████:**  496.  The buildings crumbled and the ocean flooded over him. There were other statues like it, but they were swept away by currents or something. It felt sorrow and loneliness. I don't think he knows anything else about his past... but you should go see him sometime, if you're curious.  I know he could use the company.
>  
>  **<End Log>**
>  
>  **Closing Statement:**  Agent █████ placed on mandatory on-site leave, pending psychological evaluation. 


**Addendum 496-6:** Incident 496-4 has determined the drowning death of Agent █████ to not be accidental. Dr. Boyd, who communicated with Agent █████ shortly before her death, reported that she claimed her name was "Andel" and that she was "going home". SCP-496 temporarily moved to Site-77's Euclid SCP wing, and a psychological review of all affected personnel is to be implemented.

**Addendum 496-7:** SCP-496's classification permanently upgraded to Euclid. Level 3 personnel involved in SCP-496 related research have been relived of command, and personnel from off-site have been brought in to replace them. All affected personnel have been given amnestics and be permanently demoted to Level 0 clearance.

> 
> **SCP-496:** (Image of Agent █████ submerging herself in [REDACTED], followed by her drowning death. Dr. Boyd reported feelings of immense sadness at this point.)
