[[/div]]

**Item #:** SCP-496

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**
SCP-496 is currently restricted to a 200 square meter area around GPS coordinates 21.6█████,-71.8█████ in the Caribbean Sea, near the location of its discovery.  Monitoring and electronic tracking is currently the responsibility of the vessel ██, under direction of the local office.  SCP-496 has been compliant with instructions to remain in this area and no further containment is yet required.  Personnel posessing highly confidential information should avoid SCP-496 due to the risk of telepathic security breach.  Personnel coming into contact with SCP-496 must submit to weekly psychological evaluations during and for 2 months after the period of contact.  The entity may be removed from the sea floor.  However, after losing physical contact with the sea floor it becomes inactive immediately.

**Description:**
SCP-496 is composed primarily of calcium carbonate in the form of deceased coral.  Radiocarbon dating indicates that this coral is approximately 5,200 years old.  A smaller mass of magnetized metal has been detected in the torso, but its composition is not yet known.  A thin layer of fresh, living coral and other organisms currently coat most of its exterior.  It is humanoid in form and is capable of movement in accordance with traditional humanoid joints.  How this occurs without breaking the calcium carbonate material is still under investigation, but appears to result from changes in the molecular structure, allowing for freedom of motion and considerable strength.

The entity exhibits a high-subhuman level of consciousness.  It is self-aware and can communicate effectively through seemingly telepathic means.  However, it has little concept of the future or past and no awareness of death or non-existance.  Its emotional range appears to be restricted to simple happiness and disappointment.  SCP-496 was discovered by field agents investigating a mysterious drowning (in which the victim was found with severe lacerations on the wrists) and reports of unusual activity in the waters just off of the Caicos islands.  

Agent █████ has established communication with the entity, but reports that it is difficult, as the telepathic exchange is primarily in pictures, sounds and abstract concepts.

**Addendum 2:**
SCP-496 is scheduled to be transfered to Site ██ for containment.  The minimal information obtained from communication is outweighed by the high cost of providing security on the open ocean.  SCP-496 is expected to deactivate upon transfer and require minimal containment efforts thenceforth.


**Addendum 3:**
Following [[[incident-report-496-a |Incident 496-A]]] aboard the ██, Agent █████ has been relieved of duty, pending further investigation.
