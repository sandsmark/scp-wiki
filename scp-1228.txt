**Item #:** SCP-1228
 
**Object Class:** Euclid
 
**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation Agents are to infiltrate all major Internet service providers to ensure civilian access to SCP-1228 is blocked. Any personnel accessing SCP-1228 for testing purposes is to be accompanied by at least one Researcher, and must submit to mandatory psychological evaluation afterwards. //(Access to SCP-1228 outside of testing purposes is now strictly forbidden. See Incident 1228-A for further details.)//
 
**Description:** SCP-1228 is a website with the domain ████████████.com located at the IP address 69.171.███.██. Attempts to locate the owners of the site or its servers have so far proven futile. When usually accessed, SCP-1228 will yield a standard 404 error message. However, if viewed by an individual with a history of creative aspirations, SCP-1228 will appear as the page of the viewer’s “Official Fan Club.” Although the site’s contents vary from individual to individual, a few pages appear consistently.
 
* //Wiki:// Extensive documentation of the subject’s work. Subjects typically claim that the nonexistent titles listed are “something they’ve always wanted to do.”
 
* //News:// Reports of nonexistent events in the subject’s life. Events reported are invariably of a positive nature, such as the subject winning a major award for their work. Interviews with the subject are often listed here as well, with the subject usually mentioning in the interview that they’re glad they chose to pursue their passion rather than their career path in real life.
 
* //Forums:// Discussion of the subject and their work. Posters’ comments are all unanimously positive, praising everything the subject has produced. --In order to gather as much information on SCP-1228 as possible, the Foundation strongly encourages test subjects to post on the forums themselves.--
 
* //Store:// A store exists for the purchase of the subject’s work (books, films, albums, video games, etc.) and merchandise pertaining to it, such as T-shirts. Within ██ hours of making a purchase, an unmarked package will appear at the subject’s address containing the product(s) in question. Attempts to trace the origin of the packages and their products have proven unsuccessful. Researchers have praised works purchased through SCP-1228 to be of “a very high quality.”
 
After viewing SCP-1228, subjects will report feelings of depression. Thirty percent of test subjects have attempted suicide after viewing it. Whether this is an anomalous effect of SCP-1228 or a normal reaction to its contents is unknown. 
 
**Incident 1228-A:** On 09/17/20
██, Dr. █████████, the current Researcher presiding over SCP-1228, was reported missing. An aspiring writer in his youth, █████████ had taken to browsing SCP-1228 obsessively. Investigation of his offices revealed a log of private messages with a forum poster named “Ellen.”

> **Ellen:** I can’t believe it! It’s really you! You have no idea how long I’ve dreamed of talking with you! :)
> **Dr. █████████:** Aww, thanks. It’s always an honor talking to a fan.
> **Ellen:** I’ve read every single one of your books. I especially liked the one about the guy who goes crazy at sea. I cried like a baby at the end!
> **Dr. █████████:**  Really? That’s what I’ve wanted to do ever since I was a kid, really. Write something that makes people emotional.
> **Ellen:** You make me REAL emotional, if you know what I mean. You wouldn’t be interested in meeting up sometime, would you?
> **Dr. █████████:** I’d love to. Where at?
> **Ellen:** I live at [REDACTED]. See you then! ;)

An Agent was dispatched to the address, revealing an abandoned two-story house. Inside, Dr. █████████ was found sitting in a circle of novels attributed to him, sobbing and mumbling to himself. Shortly afterwards, Dr. █████████ and the books began to [DATA EXPUNGED]. Exploration of other rooms in the house revealed similar victims.
