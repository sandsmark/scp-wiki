    **Item #:** SCP-493

    **Object Class:** Safe

    **Special Containment Procedures:**
Instances of SCP-493 are to be kept in separate 8m x 7m rooms with standard furnishings. Individual SCP-493 may request additional furnishings provided the request does not violate restrictions specific to that individual. SCP-493-2 and SCP-493-3 have been allowed to continue their work as Level 3 personnel; however they are not to be assigned to high risk areas in order to prevent premature duplication.

Each instance of SCP-493 is to be marked with a tattoo of their designation number on their upper right arm to prevent any confusion between the otherwise similar appearance of each individual.

    **Description:**
SCP-493 is a group of genetically identical males of apparent ages between 20 and 90 years old. The younger SCP-493s have brown hair and brown eyes, are about 1.7m tall, and weigh between 70 and 90 kg, depending on diet and activity. Older SCP-493’s hair turns grey after beginning to bald around an apparent age of 50 years old. Each SCP-493 currently in containment is fluent in English and multiple dialects of German, speaking with a moderate Swiss-German accent. SCP-493-7 and SCP-493-8 are also fluent in Spanish. Ten instances of SCP-493 are currently accounted for. From estimated duplication rates, it is believed that a minimum of twelve instances of SCP-493 have not yet been contained.

When an instance of SCP-493 dies, nothing abnormal presents itself immediately. The corpse may be buried, and will decompose naturally. However approximately three hours after death, two younger SCP-493s (appearing to be in their early twenties) will materialize in close proximity to the location of death. These two new instances of SCP-493 are identical to each other, and maintain the memories of all of their previous lives.

Other than the memories of their previous life, individual instances of SCP-493 do not appear to share any sort of mental link or bond with each other after reconstitution. If the two young SCP-493s move away from each other geographically, they may lead completely separate lives.

    **Addendum:**
SCP-493-1 came to the SCP Foundation in 1963 as a Level 1 researcher four years before it was known that he had unique attributes. On April ██, 1967, soon after being given Level 3 access, SCP-493-1 was killed during a containment breach of SCP-███ at Site 19. His remains were dealt with according to standard procedure for all Level 3 personnel. Three hours and two minutes after SCP-493-1’s death, several Class D personnel involved in the clean-up reported a thin mist appear in two vaguely humanoid shapes in the corridor outside SCP-███’s containment chamber. Approximately half a minute later, a bright flash followed. As the flash subsided, two naked human males (SCP-493-2 and SCP-493-3) were standing in place of the mist. The pair were immediately placed in containment and then questioned.

SCP-493-2 and SCP-493-3 have divulged their origins, the accuracy of which has largely been confirmed by historical and dental records. The original SCP-493 was born in 16██ in Zürich, Switzerland, becoming a successful protestant pastor before his first death and subsequent reconstitution in 17██. SCP-493-2 and SCP-493-3 claim the recent events involving SCP-███ resulted in their fifth reconstitution to date. Details of SCP-493-1’s “family tree” of reconstitution can be found in Document 493-H.

Containment of free SCP-493 is a work in progress. “It is the foundation’s hope that the majority of SCP-493 can be contained before duplication of SCP-493 runs exponentially out of control. However, just rounding these subjects up is quite the task, it is not like we can just put a bulletin up when the people we need to find could be any age.” –Dr. ████

It is unknown if SCP-493 will keep dividing with every death, but there is no reason to doubt such an occurrence. Permanent containment and termination options are currently under consideration.

**Update 493-01:** Agent ████ apprehended SCP-493-4 and SCP-493-5 in ██████, Germany on December ██, 1967. Each appears to be approximately 40 years old, the same age as SCP-493-1 before death.

**Update 493-02:** On February ██, 1976, SCP-493-6 is discovered homeless on the streets of New York City, appears to be about 30 years of age.

**Incident Report 493-A:** SCP-493-6 commits suicide. [DATA EXPUNGED] SCP-493-7 and SCP-493-8 are to be kept under close observation in quarters guarded against future suicide attempts. (██/██/1977)

**Update 493-03:** Following several heated arguments over the current political and religious status in various major nations, SCP-493-2 and SCP-493-3 have requested to be removed from duty in sectors surrounding and including containment chamber of SCP-493-5. Request denied. “You’re professionals, start acting like it.” –Dr. ██████ (██/██/1980)

**Update 493-04:** SCP-493-2 and SCP-493-3 have repeated request to be removed from SCP-493-5, arguing that regulation 36, subsection 8a states that they are “Not permitted to oversee contained family members without sufficient supervision.” Request granted by Dr. ██████. SCP-493-2 and SCP-493-3 are denied access to all other SCP-493. (██/██/1980)

“And I am sick and tired of them heaping extra paperwork on me by quoting obscure regulations that I didn’t even know about.”- Dr. ██████.

**Update 493-05:** SCP-493-4 dies after complications following a fall and a broken hip. (██/██/2005)

“Well that was one of my more unpleasant deaths.” –SCP-493-9, shortly after reconstitution.

**Memo 493-BA:** “Request by Dr. ████████ to ‘show him what an unpleasant death is’ denied. No, I don’t care that he’ll survive it; we don’t need even more of these running around.”
