WIP

**General Info:**
I have eaten a cubic foot of chicken parmesan in under 10 minutes. My Dad is the ultimate being. I have the same birthday as my two best friends. I have a weird fixation on pineapple. Popeye is the strongest anime character of all time. I am fated to die in an IHOP. I love you.

I am open to collabs, as they are fun, and it is cool to see other people's takes on your ideas.

I frequent the chat, so if you need me check there or just leave a tell.

If you dislike any of my works, let me know why, so I can fix them.
