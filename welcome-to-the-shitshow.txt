WIP

**General Info:**
I have eaten a cubic foot of chicken parmesan in under 10 minutes. My Dad is the ultimate being. I have the same birthday as my two best friends. I have a weird fixation on pineapple. Popeye is the strongest anime character of all time. I am fated to die in an IHOP. I love you.

I am good at writing either comedic or horror articles. In comedic terms, I tend to have slightly sophomoric humor, but with some help I can branch out. In terms of horror, I am good at making monsters, but not many other vectors of the genre. I will //never// use a non-standard object class.

I am open to collabs, as they are fun, and it is cool to see other people's takes on your ideas.

I frequent the chat, so if you need me check there or just leave a tell.

If you dislike any of my works, let me know why, so I can fix them.
