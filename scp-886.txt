**Item #:** SCP-886

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-886-A-alpha and SCP-886-A-03 are to be kept in dedicated humanoid containment suites at Bio-Site 66 and allowed nutritious rations three times daily. They are not to be informed of the others presence; if any personnel accidentally inform either of the others’ existence, the SCPs are to be treated with Class-B amnesiacs and the offending personnel are to be reassigned.

 SCP-886-B-3-01 through 886-B-3-03 are to be kept in Containment Chamber 886-Delta, designed as an appropriate climate-controlled indoor paddock on-site and provided with appropriate feed. 

Additional members of SCP-886 may be bred if an appropriate reasons for research are presented. If research is not being undertaken, offspring of both SCP-886-A and SCP-886-B are to be destroyed immediately after birth.

**Description:** SCP-886 is the collective designation of a unique mammals capable of cyclic asexual reproduction. SCP-886-A are identical human females (Homo sapiens) of Irish descent and SCP-886-B are identical female domestic Irish goats (Capra aegagrus hircus). 

SCP-886-A-alpha is sapient and behaves like an ordinary human female, age 37 at the time of writing, of average intelligence and stature. Once a year during the spring, SCP-886-A-alpha will spontaneously become pregnant and carry triplet instances of SCP-886-B to term. Gestation mirrors that of a standard goat, averaging between 140-160 days. 

Instances of SCP-886-B will all be female. At the age of two and a half years, each specimen of SCP-886-B will spontaneously become pregnant, with a single human infant. Infants born of SCP-886-B are genetically identical to SCP-886-A-alpha, designated SCP-886-A-XX. SCP-886-A-XX will develop as normal human females until age 15, when they will begin to exhibit the anomaly in the fashion previously described. 

SCP-886-A-alpha does not know how or why she began to exhibit her anomaly, only that it began suddenly and with no warning. 

**Addendum - Recovery of SCP-886:** SCP-886-A-alpha was discovered by embedded Agent Donelly when a local newspaper released a story regarding her anomalous pregnancy in a weekend column. A cover story revealing the column as a piece of short fiction was released and associated civilians were altered appropriately. 

A task force was called to the area and SCP-886-A-alpha was extracted under the guise of a car accident. Family and friends are being monitored for further anomalies, special attention to the SCP’s sisters and daughter.
