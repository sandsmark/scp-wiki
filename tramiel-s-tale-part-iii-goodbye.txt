Jack couldn't remember how long he'd been sitting in this car. Not his car. Sam's. The hospital. The heart attack. Was he driving? Try remembering. A phone call waking him. Sam is in the hospital. There's been a heart attack? Sam's heart. Racing, racing, twisting, minding Sam.

A legal way around killing a man, running Atari for two years.

Jack found himself pulling into Atari Corp's parking lot. It was empty. That was typical. The employees wouldn't be arriving for work until daylight. Jack was alone. 

Fighting Commodore was tilting at windmills. Competing, outselling, holding its head in the commode until it was cold in a grave. Nothing clever about buying into a deal with the devil. Those demons lurking in Atari's basement had always been a dirty little secret. That, Jack could live with. Not killing family

= "I have to sell this company."

Controlling his breathing, unlocking the loby doors, elevator dings for arriving and departure. 

His office. Sam's office. Different taste in decorating mattering little because the sword is still there.
 
Hurling a stapler through its thin veneer, still managing to cut his hands as he retrieved his prize.

Breathing harder. Moving faster. Back down, lower than the lobby, lowering further still, below the basement. When the doors open, the locked door had already begun fabricating itself in anticipation of his arrival.

Jack was already rolling up his sleeves, //just like when I was going downstairs to lecture Sam//. The ##purple|Arcadia## employee entrance was unremarkable, save for the shining padlock binding it shut. 

Grabbing it, Jack felt that familiar dull heat and hissing for the last time. The melting portal begat an aperture into a mad tinkerer's workshop. Mountains of circuits and organs warping together in a puzzle of silicone and flesh. Computer terminals whining like toddlers and dried vomit crusting around their disc drives.

The few grotesque disciples of ##purple|Arcadia## were gaping where they stood. //The boss is here, whoa, tell me he's not canceling us again? Oh gosh, oh jeez, do we show him the pentagram room? What's that sword for? Why isn't he saying anything?//

Ignoring the cowering warlocks and occultists, Jack followed the sound of a rattling furnace deeper into the lurching catacombs. That old anger was climbing back. Heating up in his feet because they were moving so quickly and now crawling up his legs.

"NOLAN."

Nothing about this place was even close to resembling an office at this point. Torches burning impossibly green as motor oil dripped from the ceiling. Walls becoming monitors with a single crusting eye staring wildly at nothing.

"NOLAN YOU SON OF A BITCH I'M COMING FOR YOU."

The passageways ended abruptly. All those vile angles culminating in a door so small only a child could comfortably walk through. 

Jack could remember when Sam was young, the closet under the stairs had a door just this size. It had been Sam's playroom until he got too big, so they stuffed it with cardboard boxes containing nothing of consequence.

It broke easily beneath his boot.

Crawling was the only way in. This last room was mostly empty, lit only  by the glow of a cathode ray tube. Exhaustion was creeping up on Jack. The dragging blade was heavier with each step but the glow wasn't getting any closer.

"Nolan?"

The television shut off. The crinkling static of cooling television becoming the only sound and soon, it too, was gone in the dark.

"Been a while, hasn't it baby?"

Gritting his teeth, Jack wobbled, propping himself up on the sword. "End what you've started Nolan, so I don't have to."

Flickering back to life, the screen was now only inches from Jack's face. "Jackie, you've been a saucy little boy tonight haven't you? I thought you were retired." 

Now there was a facade of young Sam, fading in with black eyes and gold teeth. A hideous grin stretching from one side of his face to the other distorting further with each passing second.

"Isn't it past your bedtime, old man?"

Bellowing from his diaphragm, memories of holding Sam surging through his arm, seeing this false Sam in his eyes. The arc of the blade carried it from the ground, up, around, and back down into the television with vicious force. Cleaving it in two, it bled more than any other television ever has or ever will. Sparks and wailing permeated every inch of Jack's being.

Then, all was quiet and still.

----

The light of a setting sun was streaming through the Atari lobby's glass doors. The employees were home with their severance pay, apart from a couple stragglers. One of them was Sam Tramiel. Taking a breather next to his little pile of boxes, all that remained of his Presidency.

"Careful, son. Let me carry that for you."

"I'm okay, Dad. Thank you. We'll just take multiple trips."

"Nonsense. I'm an old man, but my ticker's got you beat."

"... Sure, sure. Do you actually mind if I sit in the car."

"I'll walk with you. There's not much left here, anyways."
----
Jack Tramiel was relaxing. JTS Storage merging with, really absorbing, Atari also meant that Jack was now a member of the board. Sitting beside old men in ill-fitting suits wasn't the most exciting retirement imaginable but it beat stressing yourself to death any day of the week. It was a fitting fate for such an evil company. Broken up inside the most boring company imaginable.

Jack Tramiel is a father. Making up for lost time, every evening was a time for Sam and Jack to start knowing one another. Jack had a hard time believing Sam missed out on hearing the stories about Jack's days driving a cab.

Jack Tramiel was a magician. Holding his hand under the table, he played with the blue sparks dancing between his fingers.  The best parting gifts are the ones you give to yourself. Reading the briefing on the table in front of him wasn't of interest to Jack. Scrambling and unscrambling the letters for his own amusement until it began spelling out his final truth.

The dying of the Arcadian marked his Independence Day.
