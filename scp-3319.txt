The following article is under an ongoing investigation, having appeared in the Site-59 database without any determinable origin and locking any and all edits, as well as rescinding the clearance level prerequisites for viewing. The possibility of cognitohazardous properties and/or malicious code has not yet been ruled out. Proceed with caution.

**Item #:** SCP-3319

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3319 is to be constantly monitored from a remote observation post in the neighboring mountains. Any changes in SCP-3319 activity are to be reported immediately to Dr. Stuyvesant.

Foundation web crawler Trinidad-1 is to expunge any images of SCP-3319 from satellite footage. While civilian access to SCP-3319 is unlikely due to the remote location, a polar bear sanctuary is to be used as a front to block access.

**Description:** SCP-3319 is a white, metallic object located on ██████ Island in northern Nunavut, Canada, 10m in diameter and extending 5m above the ground in a dome-shaped protrusion. While the nature, origin, and age of this object are not entirely understood, radar analysis has shown that a buried portion of the item extends to over 15 km underneath the island. In addition, two black crescent moon symbols have been painted on the side of SCP-3319, over an inscription reading "YOU ARE WATCHED • YOU ARE PROTECTED • YOU ARE LOVED".
 
Analysis of SCP-3319 is limited by its anomalous effect, in that any object that approaches within 500 meters disappears.

**Description:** SCP-3319 ##blue|was## a white, metallic object located on ██████ Island in northern Nunavut, Canada, 10m in diameter and extending 5m above the ground in a dome-shaped protrusion. ##blue|While active, any object that approached within 500 meters disappeared.##

##blue|After SCP-001's flooding of the Arctic Circle on 7/18/2560, SCP-3319 has caused no discernable disappearance of approaching flood waters. Therefore, SCP-3319 has been declared neutralized.##

**As of 4/20/2577, this article has been revised.**

**Item #:** SCP-3319

**Object Class:** [PENDING]

**Special Containment Procedures:** [PENDING]

**Description:** Seismic activity detected near the location of SCP-3319, previously believed to have been neutralized, coincides with the apparent abortion of scenario-ZK-001, among other effects, which have been given the provisional designation of Incident-3319.

Further updates forthcoming. The Administrator is expected to give a formal address to the Foundation on SCP-3319 at 22:00 on 4/20/2577.

> ++ Comments:
> ------
> **4/KStuyvesant:** Correlation doesn't equal causation. Do we have any further evidence, besides seismic activity (which wasn't unusual with SCP-001's rampages), that SCP-3319 is responsible for this?
>> **4/MKeller:** A transmission came in from satellite footage just before the sky went green. Something huge, white, and oblong was leaving Earth's orbit from the vicinity of the North Pole. It was covered in those double-moon insignias. It opened - more accurately, //blossomed// - and the footage went dead.
>>> **4/KStuyvesant:** I see. Could you get anything from any other Foundation satellites?
>>>>  **4/MKeller:** No luck. We've got dead air all around. It's likely they didn't survive the trip.
>>>> 
>>>> Look, I'm going to go out on a limb here with a hypothesis. The entire planet has been taken somewhere else, likely extradimensional.
> ------
> **3/PMasterson:** Any signs of SCP-001?
>> **4/KStuyvesant:** Seems to have slipped off the radar, for now. If what Dr. Keller's saying is correct, I think SCP-3319 might have saved our lives, and left SCP-001 drifting off in the void it created. 
>> 
>> **4/MKeller:** There are no signs of //any// contained objects anywhere. O4-19 just reported a simultaneous 100% breach of all tangible scips. 
> ------
> **2/JHughes1:** i tried slitting my wrists before the ZK and now I'm up to my knees in this office in my own blood HEALING FACTOR?? skin heals but blood too fast where is all this extra blood coming from it doesnt even hurt at this point this isjust sill ykeyboard is breaking is drenchd t oo muc hblo
>> **4/MKeller:** Time and a place for your jokes, Jon.
>>> **4/KStuyvesant:** Wait, I've been hearing similar reports at Site-19. Someone took a cyanide pill just after Incident-3319. They've been vomiting blood for at least an hour now. 
>> **2/APhillips:** Put some duct tape over it, that worked for Danvers

**Item #:** SCP-3319

**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3319 is to be constantly monitored from a remote observation post in the neighboring mountains. Any changes in SCP-3319 activity are to be reported immediately to Dr. Naismith.

Foundation web crawler Trinidad-1 is to expunge any images of SCP-3319 from satellite footage. While civilian access to SCP-3319 is unlikely due to the remote location, a polar bear sanctuary is to be used as a front to block access.

In the event of an impending K-class scenario, Emergency Dossier-3319 is to be unsealed and distributed to O5 command for further instructions.

**Description:** SCP-3319 is a white, metallic object located on ██████ Island in northern Nunavut, Canada, 10m in diameter and extending 5m above the ground in a dome-shaped protrusion. While the age of this object is not entirely understood, radar analysis has shown that a buried portion of the item extends to over 15 km underneath the island. In addition, three black crescent moon symbols have been painted on the side of SCP-3319, over an inscription reading "YOU ARE WATCHED • YOU ARE PROTECTED • YOU ARE LOVED".

Analysis of SCP-3319 is limited by its anomalous effect, in that any object that approaches within 500 meters disappears.
 
In addition, SCP-3319 functions as an automatic, extradimensional teleport mechanism for Earth in the event of an impending K-class scenario. Further information has been outlined in Emergency Dossier-3319, and restricted until it is opened.

**Addendum:** 
> (Dr. Naismith - you’ll find this “emergency dossier” in your thumb drive, the one with all the keychains.)

> Foundation.
> 
> For the gods' sake. We do want to keep humanity safe - ever since we escaped on that first moon, that's been our goal. But let's be honest; humanity keeps repeating the same mistakes that got us here in the first place.
>

> Do your job, because if you don't, we'll do it for you. And we have no idea what the fuck we're doing.
