**Test Number:** 01
**Subject Gender:** Male
**Subject’s Known Mental Illness:** Schizophrenia
**Medication:** None
**Exposure (Alpha):** Subject reported being “eerily calm”.  Subject was noted as simply sitting and looking at the walls with a blank expression.  No other effects 
**Exposure (Beta):** Subject’s body started to contort in random directions while he stated that he was experiencing great pain.  Eyes began to bulge and continued to swell as the subject’s skull increased in mass and size.  Ripping sounds could be heard as the mutation continued to progress.  Subject’s body began to increase dramatically in mass, although body growth was not symmetrical.  Teeth swelled in size and became more pointed; at this point, the subject was unable to close his mouth and drooled heavily in the testing area.  Subject then slammed his body against the testing cage, screaming incoherently while gazing wildly at random directions.  Termination order was executed at 34 minutes after Time Point Beta was reached.
**Notes:** Subject’s body was determined to have increased in mass by nearly 180% as of termination.  Most of the increase was bone and muscle tissue.  While no external source has been found to explain this growth, several genetic samples had abnormally shortened telomere strands.  Observers also reported experiencing a “deer in the headlights” sensation whenever eye contact with the mutated subject was made.

**Test Number:** 02
**Subject Gender:** Male
**Subject’s Known Mental Illness:** Paranoid personality disorder
**Medication:** █████████
**Exposure (Alpha):** Subject reported being “quiet in his head”.  Subject was noted as whirling his head around, exclaiming, “God-damn, this is better than the shit you gave me…I can’t hear them any more!”  Subject was then removed from SCP – 482 after 2 hours of exposure, whereupon he violently demanded to be in contact again with it.  After 30 minutes, Dr.  Kamen approved the return, and the subject continued to experience the mental calm listed above for 1 hour and 30 minutes more, at which Point Beta began to manifest.
**Exposure (Beta):** Mutation immediately began to manifest in the subject after Point Beta began.  Fleshy nodules began to appear on the subject’s ears, shortly thereafter breaking out into functional mouths no larger than 1/4th inch across.  Upon completing their appearance, these mouths began to communicate in a soft voice using an unknown language; subject, however, seemed to have no problem understanding what these orifices were communicating with it.  Subject was heard to exclaim, “Stop talking!  Get out of my head!” consistent with extreme instances of paranoia.  Bulges began to appear noticeably on the subject’s face, neck, and shoulder, spreading down to his arms, chest and legs before opening into mouths themselves.  Subject’s eyes and genitals seemed to have retracted, mutating into mouths as well.  Termination order was given at 25 minutes after Point Beta had been passed; by this time, at least 7 distinctive voices could be heard within the testing area, none of which belonged to the subject.
**Notes:** Of particular note is the fact that upon termination and recovery of the subject, there were enough fully grown teeth to fill each observed mouth to capacity.  Also, observers reported seeing shadows at the corners of their eyesight while hearing audio recordings of the subject during the Beta exposure period.

**Test Number:** 03
**Subject Gender:** Male
**Subject’s Known Mental Illness:** Satyriasis
**Medication:** None
**Exposure (Alpha):** Subject reported being “unable to get a boner”.  Subject displayed signs of minor lethargy and lack of initiative in performing anything beyond sitting and looking around.  Media of sexual nature was displayed to the subject, who expressed lack of interest in them.  No other reactions were noted at this time.
**Exposure (Beta):** Based on post-experiment logs, subject entered Point Beta at 2 hours, 18 minutes into the experiment.  At this point, no obvious signs of mutation were detected by both observers and the system.  Subject was noted as simply shuddering at an increasing frequency and intensity.  It was noted at █████████ that the subject seemed to be in a state of perpetual orgasm, and that multiple orgasms were taking place in a non-stop fashion.  At this point, observers noted that his hair had completely fallen off; the subject began to expel large quantities of thick, white fluid from his mouth.  Termination order was given 2 hours and 16 minutes after the subject reached Point Beta and executed 2 minutes later due to difficulties with the liquid being generated by the subject.
**Notes:** The autopsy revealed that the subject’s whole body, while physically unchanged outside, had been converted inside into a series of linked organs that allowed the subject to create massive amounts of sperm and release it via existing orifices at a high rate.  It was apparent that had the experiment continued, the subject would have multiple genitals simultaneously opening all over his skin, followed by high-velocity jets of his seed.  It is theorized by “Neil” (who assisted in procuring the subject) that the mental intensity of the subject’s Satyriasis may be a factor in its mutation rate.  Despite the sheer volume that the subject could have produced, however, his sperm was completely sterile and lacked any nutrients that could support life.  Observers reported a sensation similar to Experiment 01 during eye contact with the subject at Point Beta, but added that they had a “thrilling sensation” that was sexual in nature as well.

**Test Number:** 04
**Subject Gender:** Female
**Subject’s Known Mental Illness:** Depression
**Medication:** ███████
**Exposure (Alpha):** Subject reported feeling “peace of mind”; she was noted as sitting down and speaking in an even, somewhat jovial tone of voice   Conversation centered on her sudden interest in art, an area which the subject was noted to be particularly active in before her depression began.  No other reactions were noted.  After consultation, Dr. Kamen gave the go-ahead to proceed with the experiment, citing [DATA REMOVED]
**Exposure (Beta):** Subject entered Point Beta within normal parameters.  Subject indicated a dull pain in her midsection, centering around her stomach.  Pain intensity began to increase as the experiment continued; the subject’s body began a slow, inward collapse as body mass and fluids seemed to be drained towards the point of pain.  Subject curled up in a fetal position, stating that she was in intense pain and saying “Oh god its eating me oh god it hurts!”.  Limbs began to retract inward with a loud snapping soup at 15 minutes past Point Beta, whereupon Dr. Kamen issued the termination order.  Termination was successfully executed at 16 minutes past Point Beta.
**Notes:** The autopsy indicates that a separate, fully functional pair of mouths formed in the subject’s stomach; as the mutation progressed, it would seem that they grew in size and consumed the subject’s body mass faster and faster, sucking the material that it considers food into its maw.  The mouths had no other organs connected to it, and did not expel any waste products; it seems to had utilized the flesh, bone and fluids consumed to increase its own mass and strength.  Dr. Kamen theorizes that left unchecked, the mouths would have eaten their way out of the body before consuming it completely.  Unlike the other tests, observers reported no major phenomena; however, her attending physician [DATA REMOVED]

**Test Number:** 05
**Subject Gender:** Male
**Subject’s Known Mental Illness:** Capgras Syndrome
**Medication:** See Document ███████
**Exposure (Alpha):** Due to violent behavior, subject was tranquilized prior to the experiment.  Subject returned to full consciousness at 17 minutes after donning SCP-482, whereupon he began to rant about a variety of topics that his attending physician noted as the basis for his delusions.  However, ranting subsided after several minutes, replaced with utter calm.  Subject was heard to exclaim, “Huh…what's going on?”.  No other reactions were noted.
**Exposure (Beta):** Upon entering Point Beta, subject displayed rapid skin and muscular mutation.  Subject’s eyes began to bulge noticeably, and orb-like masses began to emerge on random points on his body as well.  As the mutation progressed, the subject’s arms and legs began to shrink and withdraw into his body; the masses also began to open, revealing fully formed and seemingly functional eyes.  Upon zooming in to observe several of them, text was observed to scroll downward as they focused on objects of interest.  The text was from no known language, although it seems that the data provided by it was of use to the subject as he nodded at several times and said, “Right, that’s right!”.  Termination order was executed at 43 minutes into Point Beta.
**Notes:** The newly formed eyes that erupted on the subject’s body were determined to be connected via a high-speed neural network to his brain; the cellular structure is believed to be several times more efficient than existing human networks, allowing the subject to process and record stimuli at an extremely rapid rate.  In addition, each eye is capable of vision at alternative levels, such as UV, low-light, and others. At least one eyeball was determined to be synesthesic; it is unclear how this occurred.  It is believed that the text observed was similar to a Heads-Up Display utilized by several armed forces in their digital combat rigs.  No other effects were reported by the observers.

**Test Number:** 06
**Subject Gender:** Male 
**Subject’s Known Mental Illness:** Pyromania
**Medication:** None.
**Exposure (Alpha):** As a result of an analysis of the prior experiment logs, additional containment measures were undertaken before initiating this Test (see Video Log ████).  Subject was sedated before suiting him up with SCP-482.  Flammable materials were then placed in a pile near the subject; of particular note were several materials that the subject used in perpetrating acts of crime while indulging his mental fantasies (homemade napalm, thermite, etc).  This was to test emotional and hormonal reactions to external stimuli that the subject found desirable.
Subject was observed to be somewhat frustrated during the initial stage of the experiment.  The subject repeatedly exclaimed comments such as “This isn’t fun!” and “I can’t find the high!”.  Unlike prior experiments, the subject showed lack of enthusiasm for activity beyond sitting and starting at several points of interest, such as the walls, cameras, and the pile of combustible materials.
**Exposure (Beta):** The subject experienced rapid mutation after entering Point Beta.  This was marked by a sharp increase in body temperature originating from his heart, radiating outward.  In addition, the subject’s body hair began to disintegrate into ash while his skin tone began to darken considerably to a reddish-brown color.  Subject’s exhalation was observed to be filled with gray smoke that grew denser with each passing moment.  At 13 minutes past Point Beta, subject stood up; as he did so, the environment inside the observation cage experiencing a intense backwash of heat and light energy, causing massive material failure.  His eyes burst into flame as his mouth opened, allowing him to release a 5-foot jet of red-orange flame at the nearest wall.  The subject then released a subsonic wail that caused all combustible material within hearing range (including the observation team’s uniforms and hair) to ignite at approximately 158° F, forcing Dr. Kamen to initiate Containment Failure Protocol XT-67O.  Subject was terminated at 15 minutes past Point Beta.
**Notes:** Post-experiment analysis shows that the subject’s mutation allowed his body to temporarily withstand and channel intense amounts of heat and light.  The source of this energy is presently unknown, as the human body is incapable of generating such levels of energy.  In addition, the sound generated by the subject during the final part of the experiment has retained its ability to spontaneously ignite flammable material, regardless of whether there are observers or not.  No body was recovered.  Finally, while SCP-482 was not affected as a whole, several threads on the collar were noted to be partially singed.
