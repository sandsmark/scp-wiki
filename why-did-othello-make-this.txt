+++ Hello everyone, and welcome to everyone's favorite anomalous dating show...

+ **SEDUCE, CARESS, PROPOSE!**

[[/=]]
@@@@ 

Our first bachelorette is the lovely [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3811 SCP-3811]! She's an excellent listener, considering that she's a therapist, and better yet, she knows how to make you feel reeeeeal good.

------

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3995 SCP-3995] is an interesting bachelor, mostly because it's not really a bachelor! SCP-3995 may or may not exist, but you know that a night with it will leave you breathless. It loves meditation, a good beer, and             . The man of your dreams may not be real, but that doesn't mean you can't date it!

------

For people who love someone who's caring and thoughtful, look no further than [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3430 SCP-3430]! Just one look at him and you won't want to be apart from him, you'll see that he's kind, caring, and really only wants to do what's best for the world. He loves to travel, go to clubs, and personal boundaries. A date with SCP-3430 will make you the happiest necrophile!

SCP-3323's patented suicide prevention techniques will make sure that you're going to be there the next day, and you know he'll be there for you too. He loves technology, family, and just a tiny bit of black magic. Date SCP-3323 and live your best Lyfe!

------

We regret to inform you that [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3774 SCP-3774] is no longer with us, but we can still tell you all about what she was like before her tragic death! SCP-3774 knew that it wanted to make a permanent connection and settle down, so if you're looking for someone who's willing to be a homebody, SCP-3774 would have been for you! She loved romantic comedies, surprises, and human blood. A date with her definitely wouldn't have sucked!

------

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3177 SCP-3177] may not be a celebrity, but he's the next best thing! If you want all the romance of dating Steve Buscemi and none of the hassle, SCP-3177 is the ideal dreamboat for you! All that Buscemi in a convenient cardboard package! He loves tinkering, knives, and being framed for murder. The perfect guy isn't far, go for SCP-3177!

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3771 SCP-3771] is the perfect woman if you want someone who likes staying healthy! She's an excellent chef, and a good motivator for a healthy lifestyle! She knows how to get your heart pumping if you know what I mean. She loves hula, home cooking and transmutation magic! Come say Aloha to SCP-3771!

------

If you like nerdy people, meet [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3504 SCP-3504]! It's got a lot of knowledge about ancient history, some stuff you might have never even known! Take it to a trivia night and rock the competition together! It even got advice from famed author [[*user Rimple]]! It likes fancy jewelry, Northern European culture, and pagan demigods! Amber is the color of SCP-3504's energy!

------

Sometimes when you need a break from the normal, you need something exciting. You need [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3287 SCP-3287]! You think you know what SCP-3287 is, but BAM, suddenly and spontaneously it takes you on a journey you never expected! It likes kids, fresh air, and it used to like something else but it doesn't anymore. You want to have the time of your life? Maybe you'll get it with SCP-3287! 

------

If you thought one person wasn't enough, meet [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3677 SCP-3677]! Six whole people in one whole package! So many personalities to get to know, and so many chances for... experimentation. They like drawing, parades, and existing. A date with them will be paradise for you!

------

Are you a horse person? Then gallop on over to [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4111 SCP-4111]! Take its hoof in yours as you walk along the riverbanks, eat delicious apples at the orchard, and drink precious filtrated water from the only water source in the area. It likes fruit, open fields and a distinct lack of molten lava. You won't be salty after a lovely date like this!

------

Why worrying about finding the perfect date when you can have one made for you? Well, if you're that kind of a pervert, take a look at [[[SCP-4599]]]! Their soft skin, lovable exterior and obedience make them the perfect partners, and that's what they were designed for anyway! They love cute naps, cuddling on the couch, and literally anything but another episode of that goddamn fan service anime you're obsessed with. Presented by Accelerate the Future, and brought straight to you!

------

Sometimes you're not looking for excitement, you're not looking for adventure, you just want someone you can settle down with and live a comfortable life. Well, then take a look at [[[SCP-4080]]]! He's a stable, normal man who lives a calm life up in Maine, but he's a bit handy too, considering his job is working at a woodworking shop! He likes lobster, his grandchildren, and the greater good. Nobody will make you feel more important than SCP-4080!

------

Feel like indulging on something you //know// isn't good for you? Well look no further than the lovely [[[SCP-4405]]]! They know how to cook, make drinks, and make you feel at home when you don't have anywhere else to go! At least, unless you have universal travel of course. They like mixed drinks, hard work and Douglas Adams. Spend the end of the universe with someone you care about!
