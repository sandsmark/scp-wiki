**Item #:** SCP-132

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** 

Although SCP-132 poses little actual threat, by request of SCP-132, she is to be contained in such a way that she is "hidden from the sorrows of the world". Upon elaboration of her requests, SCP-132 is to be accomodated in a 16x9m room located 8 kilometers below the surface level of Site 19. Walls of this room are to be fashioned out of [[[SCP-148]]] and 12 meters thick.  The room consists of standard living appliances and furniture, as well as a few luxuries, including a television (without cable), VCR and DVD player. SCP-132 is given a considerably wide selection of entertainment consisting of literature, CDs, VHSs and DVDs. These forms of entertainment may only be those released prior to SCP-132's admission. SCP-132 has access to a computer terminal designed solely for communication with 2/132-███-███, who is located on the surface, and other qualified personnel. The south wall of the room features a door which leads to a high-speed elevator which brings access to the surface. SCP-132 is to be accessed once every 6 hours for nutritional sustenace and observation. SCP-132 is permitted to deny and therefore postpone any tests. SCP-132 is permitted to leave under supervision of a single Level 1+ personnel. By SCP-132's request, all personnel who interact with SCP-132 are to be evaulated to determine that they have no contemporary negative issues. If a dark fluid begins to ooze from SCP-132's eyes, nose, or mouth, SCP-132 is to immediately escorted back to containment.

**Description:**

SCP-132 is an ethnic Palauan female in her early to mid twenties, with a height of approximately 152 centimetres and a mass of approximately 52 kilograms who goes by the name "Dolores". Like most sentient SCP's, SCP-132 objects to being referred to by her SCP designation and prefers her own title. SCP-132 is of average intelligence, having an IQ of 113. She is fluent in English and her native Palauan and speaks limitedly in Japanese. SCP-132 requires all the basic sustenances of a regular human: food, drink, sleep, etc. SCP-132 is diagnosed with duodenal peptic ulcer disease, but is otherwise completely healthy. SCP-132, when successfully isolated from other humans, has a euthymic disposition.  However, when in the direct presence of others, SCP-132 will accumatively acquire the negative or positive dispositions of those present. SCP-132 apparently has no control over these abilities. The radius of this "affective absorption" is unknown. It has been recorded to reach ranges of 7800 kilometers, though the strength of the radius effectively decreases with altitude or depth. Because of the vast numbers of those on Earth suffering outnumbering those flourishing, negative disposition frequently outweighs positive. [[[SCP-148]]] has been found to help filter outside human affects. During these affective absorptions, SCP-132 will exude a dark, viscous liquid from her facial orifices. CAT scans have revealed this liquid to originate in the pharanx, although it's ultimate origin is presently unknown. The amount of this fluid excreted is dependant upon how severely negative disposition outweighs the positive. Analyses have shown that this liquid is composed 40% of bodily fluids (mucus, blood, bile and cytoplasm) and most of the remainder of an unidentified, black acid of pH-2.3. Unsuprisingly, SCP-132 will complain that this substance "burns the inside of my face". Other symptoms of SCP-132's affective absorption include migraines, depression, aches, nausea, convulsions, hypochondriasis, paranoia, hallucinations, and what have been substantiated to be factual visions. Visions are almost excusively of past and present situations involving mass deaths. The severity of these symptoms varies depending on the level of negative affect SCP-132 experiences.

**Addendum 132-01:** SCP-132's room have been successfully installed with reinforcement of SCP-148 [see **Addenda-148**]. SCP-132 is responding well and no longer requires active access to antisymptomatic medications.

**Addendum-132-02:** SCP-132 has requested psychiatric conditioning of her abilities. Request approved. Aquisition of a qualified parapsychological psychiatrist is pending.

**Document #132-1:** Concerning SCP-132's discovery and admission. 

SCP-132 was born in [DATA EXPUNGED], Palau in  198█ and had lived there most of her life. She has reportedly experienced these absorption abilities for as long as she can remember. SCP-132 was discovered when Agent ████-████████ was vacationing in [DATA EXPUNGED], Palau in 200█ and encountered SCP-132 displaying her odd behavior. Interested, Agent ████-████████ approached SCP-132 and inquired about her condition. Upon concluding that SCP-132 warranted Special Containment Procedures, he recommended SCP-132 submit herself to the Foundation, promising to suppress SCP-132's abilities. SCP-132 hastily agreed. Because of Agent ████-████████'s unproffesional approach of SCP-132's admission [refer to PROTOCOL-XII of Retrieval Code of Conduct], he was subsequently terminated.
