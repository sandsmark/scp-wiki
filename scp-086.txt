**Item #:** SCP-086

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-086 is stored in what was once the Chief Administrator's office at Bio-Research Station-71. Adequate measures were taken to improve security of the containment area above the norm for standard offices. One (discretely) armed guard is to be stationed at the secretary's desk outside the door. By long-standing tradition this post includes light secretarial duties. SCP-086 is to be kept on the desk, with a single connection to the telephone router on the secretary's desk. All communications between SCP-086 and personnel are to be recorded, transcribed, and archived. SCP-086 is to only be allowed access to an isolated telephone network contained entirely in Site-71. This network is to consist of no more than 16 remote terminals, most of which are placed in various older labs. Three are set in hallways, and one is in the Main Atrium. All personnel of Level 1 security and above are permitted access to these terminals. The network is to be comprised entirely of equipment manufactured before 1941, primarily for ease of isolation and observable security, but also because said infrastructure has been in place and functional for decades. No repairs or modifications to the equipment or network shall be made without written permission from the Site Administrator.  Direct physical access to SCP-086 is restricted to Level-2 personnel and above. 

**Description:** SCP-086 is a cognitive organism with the appearance and abilities of a typical rotary phone manufactured in the 1930's. Chief Administrator William D██████ was the head of Station-71 during the time of the 'Golden Age' Event of ██/██/193█. [DATA REDACTED.] now designated as SCP-086 is an air-breathing mollusc-like creature. It has a carapace that closely mimics the telephone that was on Dr. D██████'s desk during the aforementioned Event. The majority of it's internal structure is taken up by a modified human brain. It retains the cognitive abilities and memories it had when it was fully human. It lacks any means of locomotion. SCP-086 can hear and speak to anyone who uses the organism's receiver or uses a connected phone. SCP-086 speaks in a clear Chicago accent which matches previous recordings of Dr. D██████'s voice.
 
**Acquisition Log :** Organism was classed as a SCP on ██/██/197█, when it was discovered by an internal audit. It was uncovered that S-71's personnel had made a long tradition of keeping Dr D██████'s condition a secret to the point of falsifying employment and payroll documents for over 3█ years. SCP-086 had been wired to a router that serviced the labs of the main building. Due to the unfolding crises and the shortage of manpower during the Event, it remained in charge of the facility until the end of the incident. Subsequently, it has functioned as a project coordinator and consulting zoologist up to the present time.
