title:Dr. BeeDee's Personnel File
**History**

After achieving degrees in both molecular genetics and computer science, Dr. B.D. found very little in either field to excite his interests. After several years of casting about for a project or career that suited his tastes, the SCP Foundation came to his attention - and vice versa - after he became involved in the discovery of SCP-686. Having provided several interesting insights and ideas for avenues of experimentation, the Foundation decided that silencing him would be a waste and instead offered him employment.

Since joining the foundation BeeDee (as he's chosen to be known - "I like the mystique of a pseudonym but I'm not that creative coming up with them") was assigned to assist in researching several relatively safe SCPs and soon took over as principle investigator on those that most piqued his interest after they'd been certified as contained.



Dr. BeeDee keeps an SCP-731-2 named 'Sarah' in a cage in his office as part of a long-term acclimation experiment. The rodent appears to have lost some of its fear of humans and visitors are advised not to poke their fingers or other appendages through the cage's bars.

**Current projects:**

* [[[SCP-531]]] - //"There's fantastic potential in these for improving the containment of some of our more autonomous SCPs. Plus, a pair of these would look positively regal in my office."//
 * //**Note:** Requisition for a pair of SCP-531s for 'extended observational studies' is denied. Again. You'll need a bit more seniority before indulging in frivolities like this. - O5-█//
* [[[SCP-686]]] - //"Yes, it was the reason I was invited to join the foundation. But please stop calling me 'milkman'. I'm done with this one."//
* [[[SCP-731]]] - //"It's like a metaphor for what we do in microcosm - the rats, the maze, the... evil teleporting manhole cover... I'm still refining the metaphor a bit. Research is ongoing."//
* [[[SCP-786]]] - //"I believe I was assigned to this project due to a clerical error. But I'll take it."//
