**Description:** SCP-4176 is a yearly reoccurring phenomenon affecting the Adna Post Office in Adna, Washington, typically occurring within the last week of January. 

SCP-4176 events begin with the sudden launching of an unmarked, customized ICBM in the Pacific Ocean[[footnote]] The location of these launches is not consistent and has changed every SCP-4176 event. [[/footnote]]. Upon launch, the missile will be directed towards the unincorporated territory of Adna, WA, and land in the field in front of the area's post office. No civilians have been harmed as a result of an SCP-4176 event.

All missiles involved in SCP-4176 events feature secured hatches, with the phrases "taxes for (year) fiscal year" and "to: internal revenue(sic)[[footnote]]To date, the word "revenue" has not yet been spelled correctly, though many different variations have appeared on the exterior of the missiles.[[/footnote]] service, washington usa" spray-painted across the surface. The contents within the hatch are typically objects possessing large monetary value such as precious jewels, paintings, and other similar items.
