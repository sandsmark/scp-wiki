No civilians have been harmed as a result of an SCP-4176 event.

All missiles involved in SCP-4176 events feature secured hatches, with the phrases "taxes for (year) fiscal year" and "to: internal revenue(sic)[[footnote]]To date, the word "revenue" has not yet been spelled correctly, though many different variations have appeared on the exterior of the missiles.[[/footnote]] service, washington usa" spray-painted across the surface.
