**Item #:**SCP-1833

**Object Class:**Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**SCP-1833 is to be contained in a standard containment locker located in Site ██'s Safe SCP wing. No personnel other than Class-D personnel are authorized to handle SCP-1833.

**Description:**SCP-1833 is a copy of the 1976 edition ███████ High School yearbook. It's appearance is consistent with other copies of the book, and appears to have normal wear for an object of its age. The yearbook is entitled "Reflections of '76". It is hardcover, and contains exactly fifty pages. The book is divided into five sections- A collection of student photographs, photograph from around the school year, club photos, photos from athletic events, and an autograph section.

When SCP-1833 is read by any person who has graduated from high school, the object's anomalous effect will initiate. The individual (hereafter referred to as "the subject") who read SCP-1833 will perceive it as their high school yearbook, containing messages left by persons who they associated with socially during this time period. Initially, these photographs and messages will be positive, with encouraging messages written in the books margins, often mentioning events which invoke positive feelings in the subject. 

However, after around 5 pages are read, the messages will begin to become more negative in tone. Initially, they will recount events that occurred during their time in high school that the subject feels embarrassment or remorse for. However, the messages will begin to mention events from the subjects life that did not happen during this time period, and will make personal attacks on the subject. In addition, the photographs depicted in the book will become more negative, with the persons depicted in the photographs often appearing to be heavily deformed.

After an indeterminate number of pages have been read, ranging from 20-30 pages, photographs of the subject will begin to appear in the book. Initially, these photographs will depict embarrassing events that occurred during the subjects time in high school. However, as the subject progresses through the book, the photos will become more disturbing , with photographs of  the subject committing crimes, being mutilated, and being harmed by other persons depicted in SCP-1833 being the most commonly reported images.
