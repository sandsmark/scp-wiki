Sly161 found out about the SCP Foundation through Containment Breach and from friends about 5 years ago. They spent some time lurking and reading articles, but never really did anything (freeloader). After finally making an account in February of 2017, Sly161 thought it was about time to start writing. And so, in May of the same year, Sly161 made their first successful article and officially became a writer on the wiki. It made them very happy.

Sly161 is non-binary and prefers they/them pronouns. They like the colors pink and purple and they also like to make cute OCs (none for the Foundation yet, unless you count Dr. Harpy but he's kind of an adaptation of one their other OCs). They also love to play video games and are going to college for Criminal Justice. 

If needed, you can send them a Wikidot PM. They can also be found in the IRC, where they spend most of their time in #thecritters. They are willing to crit drafts if they are asked.    

They currently reside in New Jersey and will defend it from Jersey jokes.

**Solo SCP Articles:**

[[[SCP-3973]]] - Would you like to re-roll? 

[[collapsible show="+ Commentary" hide="- boop]]
My first skip! I'm very proud of this one. It was my first time uploading a skip to the site and it was generally well received! The idea came to my head when I wanted to tell a story about a gaming miniature that wanted to try to help it's owner, but didn't quite understand the consequences of it's actions. After a few rounds of crit, this was the final product!

[[[SCP-3910]]] - A Comedy

[[collapsible show="+ Commentary (spoilers)" hide="- boop]]
Alright, I had the idea for this right after my first was posted. We were reading //Inferno// in class and I wanted to put my own twist on it. I've always wanted to try my hand at some exploration logs, so this seemed like the best place to try it. Although this one didn't really have much of a narrative, I was hoping the the buildup and twist of it being a modern 9 circles of Hell would make it work on the mainlist. It seems my hope was correct, and that's how we wound up with "A Comedy".

**Co-Authored SCPs**

[[[SCP-3883]]] - Dildos Have Dreams Too (co-authored with Zyn) 

[[collapsible show="+ Commentary" hide="- boop]]
Alright so. No idea how I got this idea really. I wanted to use an object that isn't seen much in skips and feel upon...the tentacle dildo. From there, I came up with the concept of a dildo that didn't like being a dildo, and the first draft was born. After posting and receiving downvotes, I asked Zyn if she could read it. She liked the interviews and helped me clean the tone up, added an extra effect, and helped with the image size. We reposted it and it has been doing much better!
