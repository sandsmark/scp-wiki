**Name:** Agent Crayne

**Security Clearance:** Level 2

**Division and position:** Mobile Recovery Team Alpha-Sigma-X ("//It does what?!?//")

**Psychological profile:** Enjoys writing profiles for social networking sites that include the words 'garden gnome', 'mustache', 'pirates' and 'impedance values'. God knows why. Filled out the company intranet blurb about himself with: "Agent Crayne is fed two live squirrels each day, one wearing a small sombrero custom-made out of spun sugar, the other slathered in Crisco.[[footnote]]Superglue works in getting the hat to stay on.[[/footnote]]" 

Is fairly intelligent, as shown by his ability to correctly identify his left hand as such. Can type up reports in time to avoid a reprimand from his handler, but often fills out pages with lore ipsum copy-pastes.

Does not work well with others due to a severe case of being a total bastard.
