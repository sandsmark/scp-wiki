[[tab Personnel File]]

[[include template:image-block name=Agent_Crayne.jpg|caption=Agent Crayne perusing the mission brief for the retrieval of SCP-████|width=200px]]

**Name:** Agent Crayne
**Security Clearance:** Level 3
**Current Assignment:** Mobile Task Force Sigma-10 ("//Buttonmashers//")
**Position:** AEDS (Anomalous Effects Deduction Specialist) i.e. the guy who gets to touch/prod/examine/lick it/him/her.

**Psychological profile:** Subject is fairly intelligent (IQ measured as being squarely between plankton and toaster), as shown by his ability to correctly identify his left hand as such. Subject does not work well with others due to a severe case of being a total bastard (see incident report Prs-I.658/L. All victims eventually recovered, but the pool table was a total write-off.) Subject is able to type up reports in time to avoid a reprimand from subject's handler, but often fills out pages with lorem ipsum copy-pastes and doodles of yams. Yes, yams. Subject's hobbies include writing profiles for social networking sites using the words 'garden gnome', 'mustache', 'pirates' and 'impedance values'. God knows why. Subject filled out the Foundation intranet blurb about himself with:

"//I'm fed two live squirrels each day, one wearing a small sombrero custom-made out of spun sugar, the other slathered in Crisco. I usually use Superglue to get the hat to stay on. Tried bubblegum, spackle, tacks, nails and welding, but those met with disastrous, though sometimes tasty results.//"

Pending further psychological evaluation, Agent Crayne is not to be let near small rodents.

**Addendum 20130913-A:** Or nailguns.

**Addendum 20130913-B:** Or belt sanders, ceramic tile cutters, chainsaws or any form of drill. For fuck's sake!
