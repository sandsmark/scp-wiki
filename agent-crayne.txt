**Name:** Agent Crayne

**Security Clearance:** Level 2

**Current Assignment:** Mobile Recovery Team Alpha-Sigma-X ("//It does what?!?//")

**Position:** AEDS (Anomalous Effects Deduction Specialist) i.e. the guy who gets to touch it/him/her.

**Psychological profile:** Subject enjoys writing profiles for social networking sites that include the words 'garden gnome', 'mustache', 'pirates' and 'impedance values'. God knows why. He filled out the Foundation intranet blurb about himself with: "Agent Crayne is fed two live squirrels each day, one wearing a small sombrero custom-made out of spun sugar, the other slathered in Crisco.[[footnote]]Superglue works in getting the hat to stay on. Earlier attempts at getting the sombrero to stay on using bubblegum, spackle, tacks, nails and welding met with disastrous though sometimes tasty results.[[/footnote]]" 

Subject is fairly intelligent[[footnote]]Subject's IQ measured as being squarely between plankton and me.[[/footnote]], as shown by his ability to correctly identify his left hand as such. He can type up reports in time to avoid a reprimand from his handler, but often fills out pages with lore ipsum copy-pastes and doodles of yams. Yes, yams.

Does not work well with others due to a severe case of being a total bastard[[footnote]]See incident report Prs-I.658/L. All victims eventually recovered, but the pool table was a total write-off.[[/footnote]].
