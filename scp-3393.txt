**Item #:** SCP-3393

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Description:** Because of your ability to access this file, and read this sentence, you are a fucking nerd. There's at least 500 other people who've seen this file too. They're all nerds as well.

Unfortunately, we don't know much more than that. All information regarding you is difficult to find because this is the internet and everything's anonymized. This includes your appearance, your pizza preference, and even your name. The only known way to counteract this effect is through the use of a powerful surveillance technique called "stalking your social media".

Despite your lack of clear cut identifying information, we've been able to hypothesize a number of things about. Below is a list of all properties that have a 90% or higher confidence rating:

||~ Property ||~ Evidence ||
|| You are a corporeal entity. || How the hell did you get to this website otherwise? Ghosts don't use computers. ||
|| You are attracted to information about yourself. || You're reading this file right now. Why else would you have gotten this far if you didn't want to know more? ||
|| You like to read high quality urban fantasy. || Again, you're reading this file. You have good taste.  ||
|| You have a strong resistance to memetic agents. || Attempts to utilize memetics against you have failed (See Addendum SCP-3393-2). ||
|| We know your name. || See Discovery Log. ||

**Discovery Log:** You were first discovered when the following post was discovered on one of the introduction threads. We were all pretty shocked to be honest:

[[module ListUsers users="."]] 
> **Name:** %%title%%
[[/module]]
> Hi guys! I've been looking at this site for a while and finally decided to join! Hopefully I'll be able to contribute somehow to the site, and read some good SCPs along the way!

**Addendum SCP-3393-2:** Below is a list of attempts to contain you. It's nothing personal, just sort of our thing.

||~ Operation Name ||~ Description ||~ Notes ||~ Result ||
|| Full Sweep || We went through everyone at the site to make sure someone didn't make a duplicate account to be funny. || No one had an account with your name so we figured it must be some outside nerd. || Failure ||
|| Memetic Incapacitation || We told you that SCP-001 was super special and put a kill agent at the bottom of it. || Somehow that still didn't kill you. We checked and your life signs were still there, and they were remarkably similar to O5-█. || Failure ||
|| Bait The Hook || See Special Containment Procedures. || Pending || Pending ||

**Special Containment Procedures:** You are to be shown a very engaging and possibly creepy SCP article. And then a few more. Once you've seen enough of them, hypnotic suggestions embedded into every SCP on the site will encourage you to make an account and join the site.

Once your application has been accepted, containment is complete. When you're here, you're here forever.
