Welcome to the Auto-zone. I'll play around with all the fancy formatting stuff later. For now - here's my page!

> My first scip! This was a lot of fun (well, as fun as writing about 14,000 people dying tends to get), and starting out with such a large-scale anomaly was daunting but I think I pulled it off well enough. The idea of the Foundation causing such a large scale disaster, and subsequently trying to save face, is something that I still find fascinating and will definitely be revisiting in a future scip.

> This is a short, sweet, and relatively simple one, but I’ve had a lot of people tell me they enjoyed it. At its core, it’s a ghost story involving apparitions in a nightclub, but with a dash of nostalgia and social commentary. Warning: this scip contains British.

[[tab More stuff about me]]
Hello! I’m Auto (he/him) and I’m fairly new to the SCP wiki; I’ve read them on and off for a couple of years, but only recently did I //really// fall down the rabbit hole and decide to start writing some myself.

If I had to pick two writers who inspire me, I'd go with Philip K Dick and William Gibson (I'm a hardcore //Sprawl// trilogy stannie). 

Outside of writing about anomalies, I’m a LEGO and [https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/thismightbeauto/ Minecraft] builder in the //rest// of my free time. I’m also into a variety of dorky music - I really like TMBG[[footnote]]They Might Be Giants, for the uninitiated.[[/footnote]] if my username wasn’t enough of an indication. Will happily talk about Lemon Demon or Oingo Boingo if you’re that way inclined!

**Other things:**
- I don’t tend to log into Wikidot unless I //really// need to post something or use the sandbox, but I’m almost always reachable on Discord (@Automaton#5480) if you ever want to ask me anything.
- If I sign off the wiki for any reason, assume it’s temporary[[footnote]]A week or so maximum.[[/footnote]] and related to my anxiety issues.
- I don’t have any specific triggers, but I’m iffy about reading stuff involving suicide/self-harm[[footnote]]Especially where it is used for shock/gore value; most other stuff is fine.[[/footnote]].
