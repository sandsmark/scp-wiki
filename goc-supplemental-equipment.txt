[[tab Black Suit]]
+ Mk VII Standard Field Dress (Black Suit)

++ History
GOC Operatives are often required to operate in a variety of urban environments, in close proximity both to dangerous Threat Entities and the civilian population. In the interests of Second Mission (Concealment) concerns, Quartermaster's Division developed the Standard Field Dress in the early 1970s to act as a low-visibility defensive garment for agents in the field.

Early SFDs suffered from several weaknesses: they tended to be heavy, restricting in movement, uncomfortable in heat or cold, and could not be made in any color aside from their undyed black. This resulted in the early "Black Suits" paradoxically causing their wearers to become more visible than if they had worn normal tactical gear. Since then, advancements in materials technology have allowed for greater comfort and lesser visibility in the garments worn by modern field agents. However, these garments are still informally referred to as "Black Suits" for tradition's sake.

++ Overview
The MkVII SFD is the current iteration of PHYSICS Division's standard duty garment. Modern Black Suits come in a variety of different fashions for various situations (ranging from high-society formalwear to thrift-store discards for blending in with transient populations). In light of changing threat conditions and advances in technology, this garment is constantly being revised and upgraded. The most recent official model incorporated the following characteristics:

* A form-fitting ballistic-fiber undergarment worn next to the skin, made of +1 Generation nanofiber, rated to stop handgun rounds with standard powder load at point blank range.
* +1 Generation nanofiber threads integrated into key points in outergarments to provide additional protection. Combined with undergarment, must be rated to stop rifle rounds with standard powder load at a distance of twenty meters.
* Micronized communications gear located in the collar and cuffs of the garment, or integrated into jewelry.
* Augmented Reality system integrated into eyewear or disguised as a cosmetic accessory.
* Personal Computing Device (PCD) integrated into a cellular phone, implanted as a cybernetic enhancement, or disguised as footwear, with satellite connection to GOC data network.
* Emergency toolkits and weapons, miniaturized and disguised as necessary, are provided by Quartermaster's Division for specific missions upon request.

[[tab Grey Suit]]
+ Mk IV Infiltration Uniform (Grey Suit)

++ Overview
The Grey Suit is the current iteration of battledress issued in cases where stealth is prioritized over protection. Grey Suits consist of a full-coverage garment made of "chameleon cloth," which incorporates minute chromatophores similar to those found in cuttlefish or chameleons. Hundreds of small cameras incorporated at strategic points take pictures of the surrounding environment and project them onto the opposite side of the garment.

The end result is an adaptive camouflage system which (unfortunately) falls far short of a true invisibility cloak: the low resolution of the surface causes the image to be blurry or distorted, and it cannot project light or reflections. In addition, the lag time of the system means that movement of the viewer or wearer will disrupt the image. However, its use of only +1 Generation technology, and the significant advantage it grants to stationary wearers, makes it a useful addition to an Assessment Team's arsenal.

Additional tarpaulins and cloaks made of chameleon cloth are often used in combination with the Grey Suit when setting up stationary hides in the field.

[[tab White Suit]]
+ Mk II Combat Garment (White Suit)

++ Overview
Reserved strictly for use by Strike Teams, White Suits represent the epitome of PHYSICS Division's battledress technology. The suit comprises three components:

1. A close-fitting undergarment, derived from the Black Suit, that provides last-ditch protection to the wearer's torso, as well as incorporating waste collection ports and a water-cooling system to prevent buildup of residual heat.
2. A rigid suit of battle armor with pseudomyomer exomusculature and full hazardous environment protection, powered by a micronized fuel cell located in the lower back.
3. An invisibility cloak generator, incorporating Tangential Technology to bend light around the subject, providing full invisibility.

As White Suits employ a large amount of +2 Generation and Tangential Technology, all units are equipped with a self-destruct device to prevent them from being captured or discovered by outside personnel.

+ Mk. III Ultra-Heavy Engagement Chassis (Orange Suit)

++ History

When engaging large entities or heavily armed targets, GOC operatives were often forced into stalemates with threat entities, due to an inability to engage their enemy on similar terms. When KTEs were armed with heavy weaponry, heavy armor, or flame based armaments, Operatives tended to fall short, due to an inability to transport their own heavy armor or engage in drawn out firefights without arousing civilian notice. In light of this, a new armor system was developed to provide heavy armament protection without the need for heavy armor.

Mk. I and II U-HECs suffered from multiple drawbacks in their design: Weight issues, Operator exhaustion, overheating, and balance issues. This was due primarily to the fact that, basically, they were tanks made suits. They were made of metal, and as such, were unwieldy, heavy, and tended to be dangerous against entities capable of producing electricity or high heat. Due to technological advancements however, particularly in the field of nanotechnology, most of these issues have been significantly abated.

++ Overview

U-HECs are designed for situations in which a Threat Entity possesses extreme destructive potential, such as a large cryptid, or paranormal humanoids with access to heavy weaponry. Typically to present a distraction while strike teams neutralize the target from stealth, although stealth attacks may sometimes be unnecessary. They can be transported in regular crating and dropped from helicopters easily and quietly.  The recent Mk. III Model possesses the following characteristics:

* Buckypaper bilayered with dilatant gelatin in order to absorb shock from bullets and explosives.
* Silicon nanofluid cooling system surrounding the chest and neck areas.
* Miniaturized electronic servomotors for ease of movement.
* Ceramic plating to reduce electrical conductivity.
* Vaporizing liquid extinguisher for protection against flammable agents.
* Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE, UHMW) robe worn around the main chassis to disperse explosive energy before it makes contact with the main chassis. Also available in orange to attract enemy attention.
* Similarly constructed helmet outfitted with gas mask and rebreather to protect from smoke and airborne toxins.
* Ram-Air Parachute system for aerial deployment.
* Fear-response memetic pattern emblazoned on the robe and chassis.
* "Firestorm" Explosives Delivery System (FEDS) to radially dispense explosive projectiles in a 3m area of effect. Designed to deter attempts to mount the U-HEC. Explosives are to be mixed with boron at a 50:1 ratio, respectively, to exacerbate the fear response memetic.

+++ GOC High Command note: Proper Usage

//The U-HEC is a flexible armor system designed for maximum shock and awe. Nearly every facet of the chassis is designed to intimidate and demoralize. Although to GOC personnel, who are inoculated against the memetic pattern on the suit, the presence of an invincible stone golem that instills terror in all its enemies can be quite inspiring. Remember, that while you may feel immortal in a U-HEC, and while your peers may behave as though you are, you are not. You can still die if you do something reckless, and your mind is still the best weapon you have.//

[[tab VERITAS]]
+ Mark IV Vital Energy Radiation Imaging Tactical Awareness System ("VERITAS")

//Note: Because of the sensitive nature of this technology, all information regarding the true nature of Etheric Resonance Imagery (ERI) is classified Level Q by order of GOC High Command. This document will cover only the operation of the VERITAS device by GOC Field Operatives The device itself is classified as "Black Box" technology and should not be repaired by anyone other than an authorized Coalition technician. ERI technology is to be considered +2 Generation technology, and must be outfitted with a self-destruct device to prevent downstream technology from being released to the civilian population.//

++ Overview
The VERITAS Resonance Imager is a fourth-generation device based on the principles of Etheric Resonance Imagery originally discovered by Seymon Kirlian in 1939. This is not to be confused with what is commonly known as "Kirlian Photography," which is a simple corona discharge phenomenon. Prior versions of the system (including COLLICULUS), required a separate Resonance Imager and Viewer, making the system too bulky to be carried by a single person. Recent miniaturization advances have allowed the entire system to be incorporated into a single headpiece, most commonly combined with low-light, infrared, and ultraviolet imaging technology in the OCULUS vision enhancing headset.

Like all ERI devices, VERITAS functions by detecting the distinctive Aetheric Energy Fields (AEF), or Elan Vital Energy (EVE) given off by living creatures during the course of normal life functions. By measuring the wavelengths and intensity of these energy fields, information regarding the nature of the life form, its mental and physical state, and any paranormal alterations can be determined.

In its simplest configuration, a single VERITAS unit can be used to detect the presence of higher life forms, even through a wall or other vision-obstructing obstacle. However, the device's true potential is only reached when two or more units function in tandem. By triangulating the position and nature of various AEFs, a three-dimensional map of the area (including the locations of all hostiles) can be provided to a mission commander or overwatch.
