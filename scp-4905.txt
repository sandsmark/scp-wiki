**Special Containment Procedures:**  Image recognition algorithms embedded within public and private research centers are to flag and forward any ongoing research relating to the lunar surface.  MTF Rho-3 ("The Hills Have Eyes") has been assigned to analyze and quarantine any data and imagery related to SCP-4905 or its potential detection.

Monthly site integrity surveys are to be carried out by Foundation research assets stationed at Lunar Area-32.  Survey samples are to monitor for biogenic molecules and other complex organic compounds.  In the event that biogenic particles should sample at a value greater than 1,000 parts per cm^^3^^ Lunar Area-32 is to target the areas of highest concentration and launch ancillary site warheads during a period of minimal lunar visibility.

**Description:** SCP-4905 is the designation for a collection of battlefields centered around the Selenographic[[footnote]] A system of latitude and longitude useful for mapping the moon.  It features the same cardinal directions and system of degrees used when mapping Earth.[[/footnote]] north pole of Earth's Moon. These sites relate to a mass conflict between members of the human race culturally identifying as Vikings and an invasive insectoid species.  Traces of SCP-4905 were first discovered in 1966 when photographs taken by lunar probes showed reflective metallic compounds visible from several major craters on the lunar surface.  Information was successfully quarantined until such time as more detailed analysis could occur.  Excavation and inventory took place between 1998 and 2002 after the Foundation presence at Lunar Area-32 had been established.

The primary collection of cultural relics originated on Earth and is linked to several tribal clans of Northern Europe.  Although DNA and other identifiable markers have been destroyed by cosmic radiation, a number of crafting techniques, artistic styles, and component materials have been correlated with the cultural composition of Oslo, Norway circa 1050 CE.  Despite the apparent age of these relics, many of the objects were found to have been heavily modified using metallurgical techniques and other technological enhancements well beyond the scope and capabilities of their originating culture.

The following is an incomplete manifest of heavily modified cultural artifacts recovered from the anomaly's constituent sites:
* 18 'Skeid'-class [[footnote]]Skeid is loosely translated to a "slider" or "speeder", bearing similarities to a pirate cutter or other fast-moving raiding ship. [[/footnote]] Viking longboats each measuring approximately 21 meters in length.  Each boat had been fitted with multiple plates of a magnesium-silicon carbide and a posterior thruster array powered by indeterminate means.
* 2218 single-edged weapons similar in form to a bearded axe.  The head of each axe is composed of a dense material containing Moscovium-290[[footnote]] A synthetic element with an atomic number of 115 marked by the symbol Mc.  Decays by alpha radiation with a half-life of 650ms. [[/footnote]] stabilized via unknown processes.  Trace amounts of this material are shed in the course of use which undergoes rapid radioactive decay and inhibits platelet formation and cellular regeneration in wounds.  
* Interlocking plates of lamellar armor composed primarily of beta titanium alloy and advanced carbon composites.

SCP-4905-1 is the designation for a group of insectoid organisms of an indeterminate origin.  While no completely intact specimens of SCP-4905-1 were recovered from a site survey, a number of partial specimens were salvaged and brought back to Lunar Area-32 for further study.  Each of the partial specimens featured one or more embedded bearded axe style weapons lodged in either the center mass or the primary ganglia of the creature.  Carcasses often bore multiple embedded weapons or showed wound patterns consistent with multiple lethal weapon strikes.

------

There are three constituent sites composing SCP-4905 that are each geographically separate.  Present at each of these sites is a cylindrical monolith made from an unidentified non-reactive metal. Standing at six meters in height, reconstructed portions of each cylinder feature relief carvings of Viking warriors wielding weapons and arrayed in combative poses or military formations.  The middle band of each cylinder displays text carved in a runic language known as Young Futhark[[footnote]] On Earth, Young Furthark was completely supplanted by the Latin alphabet in the 1200's.[[/footnote]].  The purpose or intent of the text is unknown and is the subject of further study.

The following is a description of each site and the associated monolith, as well as its initial translation.  Further academic verification of the texts and carvings are still pending Information Security review.

[[tab Site-1 - Mare Frigoris]]
**Site 4905.1:**
The conflicts around this outpost contain a large number of 'skirmish' style engagements.  Insectoid forces include a number of smaller units deployed in compliment to larger drones in something resembling squad-based tactics.   In comparison to the other sites, this battlefield features the fewest numbers of combatants and the most narrow variety of employed weapons and tactics.  Fighting at this location was likely short, brutal, and based on the proportions of remains, soundly in favor of the Insectoids.

Several specimens of SCP-4905-1 were recovered from Site 2 with numerous layers of regenerated exoskeletal matter.  Larger specimens of SCP-4905-1 all possess axes, bladed weapons, or otherwise metallic implements lodged at various depths of their anatomy as the defenders iterated both tactics and response.

Multiple instances of ocular-cortical implants were discovered among the Viking remains that suggest a level of cybernetic integration or augmentation.  Tool marks present on bones and the position of tactile circuitry suggests the devices are intended for use with human physiology. It is speculated such a device may have been utilized to increase reaction time and the real-time processing of sensory information.  Unfortunately, Foundation research has been unable to identify a power source compatible with this technology; Research into these augmentations is ongoing.

Additional cybernetic devices discovered at this site include but are not limited to:
* Subdermal thoracic plates made of beta titanium alloy with attached gold diodes.  Plates were anchored to sternum and diodes were distributed to various critical locations throughout the body.
* Forearm mounted bracer with liquid crystal display.  The attached device appears intended to convey some level of information and is accompanied by devices analogous to a transceiver.  A portion of those wearing the bracers had them anchored into the radius and ulna, possibly as a means of interfacing directly with nerve impulses.
* Cranially affixed ultra-compact rebreather.  The majority of these devices attached via adjustable strap but many were anchored directly onto the jaw.

The remains of Monolith-4905-1 are located in the approximate center of the crater and appears to have been destroyed as a result of the conflict at Site-1.  Tool marks and scoring present in the debris suggests the destruction of this pillar may have been done intentionally by defending Viking forces.  Reconstruction of the artifact yielded the following translation from the available text:
> 'Cattle die, kinsmen die
> you yourself die;
> One thing now that never dies
> the fame of a dead man’s deeds'.[[footnote]] This passage appears in stanza #76 of the 'Gestapattr' verse of the Edda Poetica[[/footnote]]
> 
> 'So do we write to color the runes
> written against the stars
> stained with our blood.'
> 
> 'O'er long summers we gather
> beckoned to Aegir's Hall.
> Tales for our grandchildren make for ancestor's pride.'

[[tab Site-2 - Mare Serenitatis]]
**Site 4905.2:**
Taking place inside a shallow crater near the Lunar north pole, Insectoid forces approached Site-2 from Lunar West and penetrated deeply through Viking lines, which collapsed at the point of attack.  Substantial amounts of ossified human remains line a wedge-shaped corridor and increase in frequency and density as the wedge nears the center of the crater.  The largest concentration of remains, both Viking and Insectoid, are accumulated in a circular area surrounding the pillar.

This location appears to be 'ground zero' for the detonation of a secondary anomalous event which took place during the previously mentioned battle.  While the specific nature of this event is unknown, it appears to have resulted in the instantaneous ossification[[footnote]] The process of bone tissue formation, or the conversion of existing matter into bone.[[/footnote]] of all organic matter present in the crater and perhaps beyond.  Due to the substantial degradation of remains and the wide scope of this battlefield, the true number of casualties is impossible to measure.

The remains of Monolith-4905-2 are located near the ignition point of the aforementioned secondary anomalous event.  While the anomalous properties of the detonation do not appear to have affected the materials in the monolith, the concussive force of the blast was sufficient to destroy the artifact where it stood.  Partial reconstruction of the artifact yielded the following translation from the available text:
> 'Bones of our fathers
> bones of our sons
> bones of a brother
> fought and won.'
> 
> 'Thus we dwelt 
> three nights long
> battle did end by brother's hand
> Jaws of Fenris-wolf swallow all.'
> 
> 
> **Útgarðr**[[footnote]] The Old Norse name for Jotunheim: The World Of Giants. [[/footnote]]
[[/tab]]


[[tab Site-3 - Mare Crisium]]
**Site 4905.3:**
Located on an open field several kilometers outside the anomalous detonation-zone, this is the largest concentration of remains for both Viking and Insectoid forces.  Objects on this battlefield center chiefly around a number of larger instances of SCP-4905-1 including one instance that measured nearly 54 meters in length, hereby designated SCP-4905-1-α.  Substantial resources appear to have been invested in the escort of this largest instance deep into Viking territory, and a proportionate response was made in an attempt to halt its advance.

Although the specifics logistics of the final battle are impossible to accurately recount, a significant number of the advanced weapons and personnel were located throughout the interior of SCP-4905-1-α and at various depths within its exoskeleton including within its mandible, thorax, abdomen, and primary ganglia.  Apparent egress was gained by either entering through the spiracles[[footnote]] External openings on many insects usually leading to respiratory organs.[[/footnote]] or by exploitation of inflicted wounds.

In addition to personnel, the shattered hulls of several Viking longboats also flanked the corridor.  The bow of each ship had suffered a catastrophic breach with a splintering pattern consistent with high-speed impact.  While the efficacy of these maneuvers is unknown, this is the only site in which such tactics were utilized.

At the apparent conclusion of the battle, the advance of SCP-4905-1-α was halted along with the remaining mass of SCP-4905-1.  A number of weapons, circular shields and other discarded implements of war were left on the lunar surface surrounding Monolith-4905-3 arrayed in a circular fashion.  This behavior has presumably ritualistic or celebratory implications. 

Monolith-4905-3 is located at the center of the crater and in close proximity the remains of SCP-4905-1-α.  Although this artifact was not destroyed as a result of the battle, the surface was defaced or stripped and an inscription was made at some time after original construction.  The tool marks lack the precision demonstrated on the other monoliths and it is believed that this addition or alteration was impromptu.  The translation reads as follows:
> 'Shoulder by shoulder Víkingr stand
> here we fought, here we bled til Angrboda quaked
> and ground drank her ichor.'
> 
> 'Wreathed in rage her children swelled
> Resolve holds heavy our feet
> Valor holds strong our spears.'
> 
> 'Lands of Mani washed clean
> by the shores of the river run with our blood.
> They are safe.
> Tomorrow comes
> Tomorrow comes.'
>
