Some day, they'll all be immortalised in verse, eh. Enjoy

**"682"**
Big angry lizard
Kind of grumpy, but still fun
Until he eats you

**"447"**

Delicious slime ball
Leaves one feeling minty fresh
No dead bodies, please

**"173"**

If you close your eyes
It will break your fucking neck
Try not to blink, son

**"261"**

Odd vending machine
Every snack a new surprise
Orgasm muffins
    
**"184"**

Where did that thing go
The hallway is different now
Twelve rights and a left

**"262"**

Fashionable coat
Produces arms from within
Gets kind of grabby

**"165"**

resting wall to wall
beware the hungry sand dune
microscopic bugs

**"251"**

Pretty land of snow
Swirling in a crystal ball
Giant spider time

**"177"**

One-player chess game
Black pieces move on their own
And gloat when they win

**"125"**

Hiker passing by
Finds a dragon in the ice
Looks a little shit

-A Fat Ghost

**"297"**

It feels pretty good
Just don't touch the last setting
Really, don't do it

**"015"**

Lots and lots of pipes
Miles and miles of it even
Filled with who knows what

**"162"**

Scalpels, needles, saws
Scissors, knives and fishing hooks
This will be painful

**"291"**

Takes people apart
But they're still okay mostly
In bits and pieces

**"335"**

One hundred and fifty
It's the whole damn internet
On some little disks

**"335"/lol version**

The whole internet
I just accidentally
Is this dangerous

**"WTF"**

Oh god, what is that
It's just so fucking freaky
Wat I don't even

-K.P. Crow

**"882"**
Lots and lots of gears,
Destroys minds and eats metals,
Grind grind grind grind grind

**"055"**
Um... wait... just a bit
I know I had something here
But... damn, I forgot

-SLR

**973**
Smokey the bad cop
Kills all lawbreakers dead and 
Says "runfuckerrun"

**055**
Roses are Red and
Violets are blue... wait, what was
I saying again?
-Edrobot
