Kind of grumpy, but still fun
Until he eats you

Leaves one feeling minty fresh
No dead bodies, please

It will break your fucking neck
Try not to blink, son

Every snack a new surprise
Orgasm muffins

The hallway is different now
Twelve rights and a left

Produces arms from within
Gets kind of grabby

Swirling in a crystal ball
Giant spider time

Miles and miles of it even
Filled with who knows what

But they're still okay mostly
In bits and pieces

On some little disks

The tunnel monster, that's me

Roars a growing Factory
They're back in business

Longer than seven seconds
Again and again

And yet, as the world burns down
I am left alone

Through green, pink, blue smoke signals
Five fifths deep below

Against darkness
