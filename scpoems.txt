Some day, they'll all be immortalised in verse, eh. Enjoy

**"682"**

Big angry lizard
Kind of grumpy, but still fun
Until he eats you

**"447"**

Delicious slime ball
Leaves one feeling minty fresh
No dead bodies, please

**"173"**

If you close your eyes
It will break your fucking neck
Try not to blink, son

**"261"**

Odd vending machine
Every snack a new surprise
Orgasm muffins
    
**"184"**

Where did that thing go
The hallway is different now
Twelve rights and a left

**"262"**

Fashionable coat
Produces arms from within
Gets kind of grabby

**"165"**

resting wall to wall
beware the hungry sand dune
microscopic bugs

**"251"**

Pretty land of snow
Swirling in a crystal ball
Giant spider time

**"177"**

One-player chess game
Black pieces move on their own
And gloat when they win

**"125"**

Hiker passing by
Finds a dragon in the ice
Looks a little shit

-A Fat Ghost

**"297"**

It feels pretty good
Just don't touch the last setting
Really, don't do it

**"015"**

Lots and lots of pipes
Miles and miles of it even
Filled with who knows what

**"162"**

Scalpels, needles, saws
Scissors, knives and fishing hooks
This will be painful

**"291"**

Takes people apart
But they're still okay mostly
In bits and pieces

**"335"**

One hundred and fifty
It's the whole damn internet
On some little disks

**"335"/lol version**

The whole internet
I just accidentally
Is this dangerous

**"WTF"**

Oh god, what is that
It's just so fucking freaky
Wat I don't even

-K.P. Crow

**"882"**
Lots and lots of gears,
Destroys minds and eats metals,
Grind grind grind grind grind

**"055"**
Um... wait... just a bit
I know I had something here
But... damn, I forgot

-SLR

**"973"**

Smokey the bad cop
Kills all lawbreakers dead and 
Says "runfuckerrun"

**"292"**

Roses are Red and
Violets are blue... wait, have I
done this allready?
-Edrobot

**"1333-J"**

Apocalypse man.
Consult a necromancer
or else we're all fucked

**"10101-J"**

Aw yeah, who's a man
and a half? I'm 12.0 on
the scale of badness!

**"914"**

Pop it in and close,
Whatever you need improved,
Crank, Clank, Crank, Clank, Ding!
-SnugglyChaos

**"248"**

Paste me if you want,
I promise I will make it
Better than when new!
-SnugglyChaos

**"1463"**

Purple fun for all
Can even purple a ball
Brovisr Funtastic!
-SnugglyChaos

**"1066"**

The pen makes its mark
The student learns instantly
Time marches onwards

**"1231"**

Computer with folks
Try not to think about them
If you do, they're screwed

**"1000"**

Old civilized apes
They want to fucking kill us
Should we let them in?

-Reject

**"931"**

I don't understand.
Did I just write in Haiku?
This bowl is trouble.

**"1481"**

Sobbing in his cup.
He wishes for more cocaine.
It didn't appear.
