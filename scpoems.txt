Some day, they'll all be immortalised in verse, eh. Enjoy

Big angry lizard
Kind of grumpy, but still fun
Until he eats you

**"447"**

Delicious slime ball
Leaves one feeling minty fresh
No dead bodies, please

**"173"**

If you close your eyes
It will break your fucking neck
Try not to blink, son

**"261"**

Odd vending machine
Every snack a new surprise
Orgasm muffins
    
**"184"**

Where did that thing go
The hallway is different now
Twelve rights and a left

**"262"**

Fashionable coat
Produces arms from within
Gets kind of grabby

resting wall to wall
beware the hungry sand dune
microscopic bugs

Swirling in a crystal ball
Giant spider time

Black pieces move on their own
And gloat when they win

Finds a dragon in the ice
Looks a little shit

It feels pretty good
Just don't touch the last setting
Really, don't do it

**"015"**

Lots and lots of pipes
Miles and miles of it even
Filled with who knows what

**"162"**

Scalpels, needles, saws
Scissors, knives and fishing hooks
This will be painful

**"291"**

Takes people apart
But they're still okay mostly
In bits and pieces

**"335"**

One hundred and fifty
It's the whole damn internet
On some little disks

**"335"/lol version**

The whole internet
I just accidentally
Is this dangerous

**"WTF"**

Oh god, what is that
It's just so fucking freaky
Wat I don't even

-K.P. Crow

**"882"**

Destroys minds and eats metals,
Grind grind grind grind grind

I know I had something here
But... damn, I forgot

Kills all lawbreakers dead and 
Says "runfuckerrun"

Violets are blue... wait, have I

Apocalypse man.
Consult a necromancer

the scale of badness!

Pop it in and close,
Whatever you need improved,
Crank, Clank, Crank, Clank, Ding!

Paste me if you want,
I promise I will make it
Better than when new!

Can even purple a ball
Brovisr Funtastic!

The student learns instantly
Time marches onwards

Try not to think about them
If you do, they're screwed

They want to fucking kill us
Should we let them in?

Did I just write in Haiku?
This bowl is trouble.

misters, toys, and happiness!
Just while supplies last!

Anomalous we made this,
So, are we cool yet?

come home, we miss you.

This is very fucking cold
How does it work though?

No horribly bad jokes, please
Pelted otherwise

allows us to see patterns
even from nothing.

Stick your hand in it.
"Hey! I found my long-lost toy!"
"Huh? Where'd my badge go?"

I am a toaster.
Anyone who mentions me
uses first-person.

**"3663"**

Crawling in the pipes
The tunnel monster, that's me
...I didn't want this.

**"748"**

Through the sobs and screams
Roars a growing Factory
They're back in business

**"176"**

I dream of living
Longer than seven seconds
Again and again

We are infinite
And yet, as the world burns down
I am left alone

How can I, a gentleman,
be a small sea slug?

In the afterlife
One group wants to save our world
Love, watch, and protect

Is it a witch or a ghost?
But Nobody knows.

Just Five syllables,

A nervous insect
A sad, lonely janitor
The perfect couple
