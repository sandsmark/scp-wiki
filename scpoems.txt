Some day, they'll all be immortalised in verse, eh. Enjoy

**"682"**
Big angry lizard
Kind of grumpy, but still fun
Until he eats you

**"447"**

Delicious slime ball
Leaves one feeling minty fresh
No dead bodies, please

**"173"**

If you close your eyes
It will break your fucking neck
Try not to blink, son

**"261"**

Odd vending machine
Every snack a new surprise
Orgasm muffins

**"808"**

Unassuming girl
Talks to home appliances
No T.V. allowed

**"184"**

Where did that thing go
The hallway is different now
Twelve rights and a left

**"262"**

Fashionable coat
Produces arms from within
Gets kind of grabby

**"165"**

resting wall to wall
beware the hungry sand dune
microscopic bugs

**"251"**

Pretty land of snow
Swirling in a crystal ball
Giant spider time

**"177"**

One-player chess game
Black pieces move on their own
And gloat when they win

**"125"**

Hiker passing by
Finds a dragon in the ice
Looks a little shit

-A Fat Ghost
