+++ Mission Statement:
+++++ ##990000|@@  @@To attempt the emergent resuscitation of doomed articles that are PM'd to me as a last-ditch effort for help, improvement, and possibly even some success.## [[footnote]]Attempted resuscitation will not be based on request alone but on the basis of perceived redeemability. No guarantees of successfull resuscitation prior to admin-mediated deletion can be made. The quality of a product is not to necessarily exceed the quality of products presented on this page.[[/footnote]]

+ List of Unsuccessful Attempts
Most if not all author pages boast authors' achievements and rightfully so; success on this site is not easy. As with anything though, it comes very naturally to some individuals and without steep learning curves. I am not one of those individuals. In an attempt to convey some realism to those like myself who experience failure more than success, here is a compilation of failures I've experienced since attempting to contribute. I anticipate this to easily be the longest on this page, but hopefully it provides a worthwhile message; success is usually preceded by lots of failure.

* **//Early drafts of SCP-3436//** - My first SCP was a learning experience with regards to many things. I attempted mainlisting once with disastrous results. After some polishing and help on the draft forums, it did relatively well the second attempt.

* **//What was previously SCP-3971//** - It was a USB drive that converted any picture file placed on it to an auditory cognitohazard that engendered a paraphilia specific to was on the image. For example, a picture of a tree would be automatically converted to a .wav file and while that file was playing, the listener experienced an attraction to trees. The intention of the SCP was to explore the concept that the Foundation is staffed with people of the utmost moral quality simply by virtue of their employment; however, it did not do so tactfully. The SCP did ok and rested at a score of +17 or so. Rather than hold onto the cheap thrill of having a few more upvotes and my name on another mainlisted SCP, I deleted the file concluding that it wasn't going to be up to the standards I'd like to showcase. 

* **//Supplemental material for SCP-3971//** - I began work on a supplemental tale in an attempt to garner more positivity for the then-treading SCP-3971. It was a tale which took the format of a censored document from the Intelligence Department that detailed the progress regarding the identification of a rat within the Foundation, whose actions precipitated the events surrounding SCP-3971 (which included a murder). After making it as good as I thought I could with help from the draft boards, I decided it too wasn't up to the standards I'd like to display, and scrapped the project along with SCP-3971.

* **//"First" Joke SCP attempt: SCP-[[$ It's \over 9000 $]]-J//** - I thought to widen the portfolio, I'd attempt a joke SCP. While waiting impatiently for review and criticism regarding an already-existing draft, I decided I'd attempt to cold-post a second joke SCP, in part as a sort of experiment to see if all the waiting in the draft forums is worth it (it is). The article was a clinical and technical interpretation of the senzu bean from Dragonball Z. I'll say; the article //was// well-written, and was by far the most fun I've had writing in the format, however it was not favorably received, in part due to a rule I had overlooked (despite it being literally the second thing recommended on the [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/joke-scps |joke page]]]) which says: 
> "Pop culture and video game references don't work when done straight. Just as with main series SCPs about mythology or folklore, it generally won't work unless you add a healthy dose of Foundation-flavored twist to it. Evangelions and portal guns [and senzu beans] simply won't cut it." //brackets mine//

It was thus downvoted into oblivion in short time (I still very much appreciate the positive comments from some of you).
