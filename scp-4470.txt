**Item #:** SCP-4470

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** All information related to SCP-4470 is to be classified as @@LEVEL-4//TITAN STAR EXCESSIVE/MOONDROP@@ WHITE. SCP-4470 is to be excluded from Ethics Committee review as per EC/O5 Joint Consensus Directive #3, as well as from all other regular security and classification reviews. SCP-4470 is never to be described using the terms "immortality," "deathlessness," or otherwise suggested to be in violation of EC/O5 JCD-3.

Members of MTF Alpha-1 ("Red Right Hand") are to conduct all elements of SCP-4470 implementation and containment. General medical staff may be briefed into related @@L-4//TSE/MDW@@ information in the event of an emergency. Personnel briefed in this manner are to be administered amnestics or otherwise controlled for following their assistance.

Under no circumstances are individuals within the purview of SCP-4470 to be exempted from currently implemented procedures. Authorization for enforcing mandatory treatment is derived from the original instating order, //Administrator communication with Director of Foundation Internal Security, June 17, 1965//. Mandatory treatment methods are to be determined by MTF Alpha-1 OPCOM and may include any means that do not directly counteract the objective of SCP-4470 implementation.

**Description:** SCP-4470 is an internal Foundation program designed to promote extreme longevity in a select group of individuals. This designation extends to all entities treated with SCP-4470 throughout the formal testing and implementation processes. These treatments currently include the use of advanced pharmaceuticals, interactions with anomalous items, and technological solutions to survival-impeding conditions.

The current SCP-4470 regimen consists of the following treatments:
||~ Treatment Number ||~ Treatment Frequency ||~ Treatment Summary ||
|| 1 || Daily || 80 milligrams Helideral to regulate programmed cell death. 40 milligrams Aclomectin to regulate cell division. 65 milligrams Allonosine to enhance memory and general cognition. 20 milligrams Pralilapril to promote muscle retention and bone density. Assorted conventional vitamins and pharmaceuticals as prescribed.[[footnote]]Average dosages. Exact dosages are managed by MTF Alpha-1 medical staff.[[/footnote]] ||
|| 2 || Ongoing || Implantation of medical devices to regulate the function of the cardiovascular system, nervous system, respiratory system, and digestive system. Current technological limitations necessitate frequent replacement of implanted devices. ||
|| 3 || Monthly || Regular exposure to low-intensity infohazards to strengthen mental resistance against more extreme effects. ||
|| 4 || Daily || Consumption of approximately .5 liters of SCP-6115 secretion to ward against multiple forms of targeted thaumaturgy. Emetics are issued within 12 hours to prevent the onset of necrosis. ||
|| 5 || Daily || Analysis of all statements by reliably prophetic anomalies for information relevant to the safety of individuals under the purview of SCP-4470. Routines and security measures are altered accordingly by MTF Alpha-1 personnel. ||
|| 6 || Ongoing || Cultivation of a subspecies of Eucestoda flatworm (referred to as 'sun worms' in subject literature) within the body of treated individuals. Active cultivation continues until the specimen reaches approximately five meters in length. Properly bonded specimens secrete exotic hormones that significantly reduce the incidence of age-related dementia.[[footnote]]For additional details, see: //Dolan, Amanda, and E. Ahmadi. "Medical Applications of Thaumaturgic Sun Worm Bonding: A Renewed Debate." Foundation Internal Journal of Exotic Sciences 99, no. 1 (August 2001): 76-116.//[[/footnote]] ||
|| 7 || As Needed || Cloning of individual subjects for brain transplantation following traumatic injury. Treatment only to be finalized as a last resort due to the risk of ontological filter failure allowing for existential knowledge gestation during the transplant process. ||

> **Primary Objector:** Dr. Elif Sakarya
> 
> **Stated Objection:** Upon being informed of SCP-4470 treatment as a requirement of her new position, Dr. Elif Sakarya refused and stated that she found the procedures to be unnecessarily invasive, in violation of EC/O5 JCD-3 specifically, and in violation of basic human rights generally. When presented with standard regulations based on 1 FUL § 89 and 6 FUL § 121, she argued that all extant regulations were illegitimate due to regular executions of unlawful authority by the previous directing body of the Foundation. Dr. Sakarya assured present agents that Alpha-1 OPCOM concurred with her opinion. 12 other objectors made similar arguments within the same time frame.
> 
> **Subsequent Action:** Following review of all relevant regulations, consultation with legal advisers, and examination of the original instating order, Alpha-1 OPCOM rejected arguments against immediate SCP-4470 implementation. Mandatory treatment was subsequently authorized for all individuals in question. 12 individuals consented to participation when informed of mandatory treatment methods. Dr. Sakarya maintained her objections. Intervening action was taken immediately following her attempts to contact individuals in the Foundation's larger security apparatus with close loyalties to her person.
> 
> Dr. Sakarya was subsequently confined to a Site-01 medical center, and a timeline was established to minimize interruptions to her schedule. Treatments 1, 2, and 5, and 7 were conducted during a state of medically-induced unconsciousness. Upon regaining consciousness, Dr. Sakarya made several specific threats against the well-being of present medical staff. Physical restraints were applied for the safety of involved personnel.
> 
> Treatment 3 was executed repeatedly over the course of 24 hours to ensure a satisfactory baseline of infohazard resistance. Nutrients were provided intravenously throughout this period. Dr. Sakarya reported experiencing extreme discomfort multiple times, but was judged to be within acceptable parameters by attending medical staff. Approximately 15 minutes of rest were allowed following completion of the procedure.
> 
> Treatment 4 was applied following this rest period. An apparatus was deemed necessary to administer the required amount of SCP-6115 secretion. Dr. Sakarya experienced several allergic reactions to the procedure, including rashes, cervical swelling, and severe ocular irritation. Attending medical staff judged these to be within acceptable parameters. Following administration of the necessary emetic, Dr. Sakarya requested a return to induced unconsciousness. This was denied given the characteristics of the final treatment.
> 
> Treatment 6 was applied following a final health assessment. As per standard procedures for establishing pair bonding, Dr. Sakarya was required to experience extended physical contact with the sun worm specimen in symbolically significant areas (hands, abdomen, neck, face.) She was further required to propose a verbal contract with the specimen according to applied thaumaturgic principles. Dr. Sakarya crushed two specimens, and refused to speak following the application of additional restraints. Dr. Sakarya later performed these actions to an acceptable degree after penalties were proposed by Alpha-1 OPCOM. The sun worm was subsequently encased in protective material and administered orally.
> 
> Following initial SCP-4470 treatment, Dr. Sakarya demanded the resignation of Alpha-1 OPCOM and all other members of MTF Alpha-1 leadership. Subsequent communication between involved parties reaffirmed that MTF Alpha-1 is subordinate only to the Administrator of the Foundation, and that all other duties are undertaken voluntarily. 
> 
> SCP-4470 guidelines remain in effect.
