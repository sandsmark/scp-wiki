**Item #:** SCP-392

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** All SCP-392 instances are to be held in a standard greenhouse sector at Biological Research Site-103. Population of SCP-392 instances is to be maintained at an upper limit of 100. Selected SCP-392 seeds are to be extracted and kept in cryonic storage at Bio Site-103.

**Description:** SCP-392 is the only extant subspecies of an artificial plant species created via Daevite thaumaturgy, resembling to the species //Prunus persica// (peach). According to //[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-140 A Chronicle of the Daevas]//, SCP-392 was cultivated by Daevite matriarchs of the Waq clan c. 400 BCE. While originally perceived as an act of social deviance in Daevite society, cultivation was tolerated [[footnote]] Dr. █████ speculates that tolerance of SCP-392 cultivation might be attributed to the decentralised model of Daevite polities in the form of the city-state and absolute power wielded by matriarchs in these city-states c. 400 BCE. See //Shifts within Daevite civilisation// for more information. [[/footnote]] and adopted by other dominant Daevite clans located in contemporary Central Asia and Xinjiang, China. 

While SCP-392 is physiologically similar to that of //P. persica//, one significant difference is that SCP-392 does not produce fruits from the ovary upon flowering. Instead, it produces male human heads. Heads grown from SCP-392 are physically identical and DNA analysis indicates that they are of the same individual, whose identity is unknown. 

The existence of multiple subspecies of SCP-392 is suggested in pictorial depictions on recovered Daevite sources, distinguished by the heads produced. All subspecies produce male human heads and tattoos on the heads are indicative of human concubinus belonging to Daevite matriarchs. As such, each subspecies is postulated to represent a distinct human individual, presumably a human concubinus to Daevite personages. However, no live specimens of other subspecies have been discovered and they are believed to be extinct. 

The physiology of heads grown from SCP-392 is mostly identical to that of a human, although the heads lack eyelids and the seed for SCP-392 is located at the prefrontal cortex. A circulatory system is present, although no blood flow is present. Other subspecies may have possessed those traits, but there is no confirmation due to the aforementioned lack of live specimens. 

Heads attached to SCP-392 are capable of responding to external stimuli, as indicated by various reflex actions. Furthermore, PET scans of attached heads have identified neural activity in the brain. Notably, rate of eye movement and neural activity are consistently higher when female humanoid figures are within the head's visual axis as compared to other types of objects. Below is an abridged list of reflex actions and responses obtained from heads grown from SCP-392.

When detached from SCP-392, neural activity and reflex actions from the heads will cease. The heads can be plucked or will fall from the plant naturally via barochory. When detached from SCP-392, the head will gradually undergo decomposition, allowing the seed to be exposed to water and oxygen. Decomposed matter from the head will then serve as an organic fertiliser for germination. 

SCP-392 was discovered in the Katsura Imperial Villa at Kyoto, Japan on ██/██/1945, which was planted there since the Pacific War. Those specimens originated from a single SCP-392 seed, which was among the gifts from Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty in response to tribute sent by Japanese envoys. Since the Japanese court's acquisition of SCP-392, it was planted on multiple occasions as a ritual to pray for national prosperity. This practice originated from a description of SCP-392 by the envoy Ono no Imoko, alleging it to be a symbol of prosperity only found in the households of nobility.

Ties to Daevite culture are later identified via cross-reference of tattoos found on the heads, and this document is subsequently updated with relevant findings from Daevite sources known to the Foundation. 

**Addendum 392-1:** Due to the mention of the Sui Dynasty and confirmation of Daevite involvement, a copy of //A History of China// altered by SCP-140 to include Daevite-Chinese interactions was consulted for additional information. 

The book mentioned SCP-392 as one of the items looted from captured Daevite cities by Chinese soldiers as early as the Warring States period (c. 475 BCE – 221 BCE). SCP-392 would be cultivated by these soldiers, who harvested and skinned the heads. The skulls would then be passed off as executed enemy combatants and presented to officials in exchange for promotion and other rewards (e.g. peerage titles, lands, slaves).  

The descendants of many clans involved in SCP-392 cultivation gained prominent positions in various Chinese dynasties, up to the imperial families of various dynasties. See Document 392-Su for more information on the topic. 

**Addendum 392-371:** On ██/██/1994, ten instances of SCP-392 have been requested to be transferred to Site-19 for possible application in Containment Procedure YIN-YANG (Subtype: Argus-100).
