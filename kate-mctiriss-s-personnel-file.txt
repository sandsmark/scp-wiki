**Name:** Katherine "Kate" McTiriss

**Security Clearance Level:** 3

**Position:** Regional Director of Local Mobile Task Forces (LMTFs), Regions 352 and 691-Interim

**Biography:** A former UIU press coordinator, Kate McTiriss joined the Foundation in October 2006 as a Press Relations Agent with LMTF 352-Lamedh ("Stump Knockers"). After successful media concealment of an [[[SCP-072]]] outbreak in student apartment complexes at the University of Florida, McTiriss was promoted to Regional Press Operations Specialist.

McTiriss became the first non-field agent to rise to Regional Director of Local Mobile Task Forces after former Region 352 Director John "Jallit" O'June was killed in the line of duty during an armed conflict with the Cross City-based Hyacinth Order in January 2013. Following the resignation of Region 691 Director Mark Bennett in June 2014, Command temporarily consolidated Regions 352 and 691 under the purview of Director McTiriss.
