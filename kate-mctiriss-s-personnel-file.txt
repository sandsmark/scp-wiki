**Name:** Katherine "Kate" McTiriss

**Security Clearance Level:** 3

**Position:** Regional Director of Local Mobile Task Forces (LMTFs), Regions 352 and 691-Interim

**Biography:** A former UIU press coordinator, Kate McTiriss joined the Foundation in October 2006 as a Press Relations Agent with LMTF 352-Lamedh ("Stump Knockers"). After successful media concealment of an [[[SCP-072]]] outbreak in student apartment complexes at the University of Florida, McTiriss was promoted to Regional Press Operations Specialist.

McTiriss became the first non-field agent to rise to Regional Director of Local Mobile Task Forces after former Region 352 Director John "Jallit" O'June was killed in the line of duty during an armed conflict with the Cross City-based Hyacinth Order in January 2013. Following the resignation of Region 691 Director Mark Bennett in June 2014, Command temporarily consolidated Regions 352 and 691 under the purview of Director McTiriss.

As Regional Director, McTirss coordinates efforts of the following LMTFs in Regions 352:

[[collapsible show="+ SCP Commentary" hide="- SCP Commentary"]]
* [[[SCP-072]]] - My first attempted, posted blind, succeeded well beyond my expectations. Based on a childhood fear that has stuck around in my brain for a couple decades and change about sleeping with my feet exposed. I'd do it a bit less cheesy if I was writing it now, but I can't argue the results.
* [[[SCP-095-J]]] - Something that cracked me up and I couldn't change. First picture is my real corkboard, I still have that printout.
* The Tall Grass and the Bell ([[[the-tall-grass-and-the-bell-1 | Part One]]] | [[[the-tall-grass-and-the-bell-2 | Part Two]]]) - A headcanon invovling Deeds, 055 and Serpent's Hand all working together. I still like the idea of SH basically operating entirely within Foundation facilities.
* [[[SCP-1558]]] - An idea I had while (no lie) doing months of research about the feasibility of a cell tower in a city park for an internship. Not my best work, but the concept carries it. Had to rewrite it after it started in the negatives.
* [[[SCP-2072]]] - Getting back into the game after two years away, part of my objective to write one SCP in each series, at least. Dixieland nightmare magic (e.g. weird Southern shit) is all I'm writing from now on. Expect more set in this area.
