**Biography:** A former UIU press coordinator, Kate McTiriss joined the Foundation in October 2006 as a Press Relations Agent with LMTF 352-Lamedh ("Stump Knockers").

Following the resignation of Region 691 Director Mark Bennett in June 2014, Command temporarily consolidated Regions 352 and 691 under the purview of Director McTiriss.
