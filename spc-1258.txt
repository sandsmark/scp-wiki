++++ NOTICE FROM THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE COORDINATION AND PROJECTS OPERATION COMMAND OFFICE

SPC-1258 has been TERMINATED. --All instances of CERULEAN GLOVE Deviant-Class Cetacean Entities are to be terminated through Centre funded whaling operations.-- CERULEAN GLOVE instances are not to be engaged when encountered. 

No further instances of entity class CERULEAN GLOVE are to be created using MIDNIGHT GIRDLE techniques. MIDNIGHT GIRDLE is believed to possess memetic or cognitohazardous effects that render practitioners unwilling or unable to comply with higher authority. The divergent neurology of CERULEAN GLOVE entities renders technological or geas-based control methods unfeasible.

**Project #:** SPC-1258

**Selachian Pugnātorial Capabilities:** Cetaceans augmented by MIDNIGHT GIRDLE, termed CERULEAN GLOVE Deviant-Class Cetacean Entities, possess both the amphibious capacities necessary for long-term sub-nautical deployments as well as the anatomy necessary to throw a punch. MIDNIGHT GIRDLE techniques are also SPC in themselves; as cetaceans augmented by MIDNIGHT GIRDLE often display an innate knowledge of such SPC, extensive training is not required.

**Project Components:** SPC-1258 consists of the anomalous martial art, codenamed MIDNIGHT GIRDLE, and fifteen (15) augmented cetaceans consisting of //Tursiops truncates//, //Balenoptera musculus//, and //Phocoena sinus//, each fitted with tracking tags. 

When movements from MIDNIGHT GIRDLE are performed within view of a non-human mammal, said animals will attempt to duplicate the movements to the extent that they are able. Animals permitted to practice MIDNIGHT GIRDLE techniques for a period of time will develop human-like characteristics. In cetaceans, this entails the development of back legs from tail vertebrae, the elongation of front flippers into arms, and fists. Animals will also develop larger brains; they will continue to practice MIDNIGHT GIRDLE techniques, and may display knowledge of techniques that they have not been previously been exposed to. Continued practice will lead to further development of humanoid characteristics, though cetaceans remain capable of aquatic function. 

MIDNIGHT GIRDLE techniques also engender the development of subversive tendencies. Proposals for compliance collars and invasive mental conditioning --are under review-- have been denied.

Ten (10) specimens of //T. truncates//, better known as the Common Bottlenose Dolphin, were chosen for their high intelligence and wide habitable zone, allowing for versatility of deployment. Two (2) specimens of //B. musculus//, better known as the Blue Whale,were chosen for their large size, allowing for pugilism with Deviant-Type Selachian Entities exceeding 10 m in length. Three (3) specimens of //P. sinus//, better known as the Vaquita, were chosen for their small size, allowing for covert infiltration of oceanic territory under the protection of hostile Groups of Interest[[footnote]]Including CYAN ABYSS dwellings, World Wildlife Foundation Species Conservation Preserves, and Green-Peace operations[[/footnote]] and engaging in pugilism with Selachian Entities therein.

**Enhancement Summary:** A Centre agent with experience in multiple forms of martial arts was given access to all materials related to SPC-1258. The agent practiced multiple forms until performance was satisfactory. The agent was recorded performing all known forms and movements, then geased to prevent accidental performance. These recordings were then played to each group of subjects on underwater screens for ten minutes per hour, eight hours per day. The remaining fifty minutes consisted of an explication of the Centre’s mission and the necessity of Selachian pugilism and basic training and Marine Fighting Team tactics.

Development of MIDNIGHT GIRDLE enhancements in all three selected species went as predicted. Specimens of //T. truncates// and //P. sinus// were capable of terrestrial ambulation after six days of treatment, but //B. musculus// were unable to do so due to the square-cube law. All specimens displayed human-level intelligence after seven days of exposure. All specimens possessed arms and fists, and were detected communicating in English or Vail Code (though in the case of //T. truncates//, on ultrasonic frequencies) after ten days of exposure. All specimens were cleared for deployment by 15 days of exposure.

**Deployment Record:** After approval, all CERULEAN GLOVE entities were deployed to one of the World Wildlife Foundation[[footnote]]A shadowy organization, possibly connected to the GOC, with a claimed mission to speciate, conserve, and protect wildlife[[/footnote]]’s Indonesian Species Conservation Preserve, Site-19, on June 5th, 1984. However, upon release from holding tanks at the assault perimeter roughly 1 km outside the border of the SCP, the CERULEAN GLOVE entities assaulted attending personnel and fled. (Dr. ████████, who approved the deployment of all fifteen entities, has been reprimanded for gross stupidity.) 

Following the escape of the initial CERULEAN GLOVE entities, several abnormal events were detected. 

An abnormal number of tagged cetaceans appeared to be congregating in the Eastern Pacific Ocean on July 12th, 1984; however, investigations revealed a clump of approximately 100 tags in the western gyre of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. This suggested transmission of MIDNIGHT GIRDLE techniques to roughly ████ cetacean entities, accounting for statistical models of tagged cetaceans.

In December 1984, there was a sudden 2400% uptick in disappearances of Cipanguese whaling boats in Antarctica. There were 27 survivors from four hundred whaling ships sent to Antarctica that season.

> **Interviewed:** Takeshi Sato 
> 
> **Interviewer:** Doctor █████ ████████
> 
> **Foreword:** Mr. Sato was the sole survivor of the //Nisshin Maru No. 64//, one of the Empire of Cipangu’s many whaling ships. He was working as a deckhand at the time of the CERULEAN GLOVE attack. This interview was conducted in Cipanguese in one of the Centre's Cipangu offices.
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Doctor ████████:** Thank you for agreeing to speak with us, Mr. Sato[[footnote]]Honorifics have not been translated[[/footnote]].
> 
> **Takeshi Sato:** It’s no trouble. You did offer to pay my medical bills. Though I must ask, who are you with? The Imperial Service? GOC[[footnote]]Global Organization of Countries[[/footnote]]? Botswains[[footnote]]of the Cog of God[[/footnote]]?
> 
> **Doctor ████████:** We’re with the Centre, actually.
> 
> **Takeshi Sato:** [Laughs] Of course. The Shark Punching Centre.
> 
> **Doctor ████████:** We’d prefer it if you referred to us as just the Centre.
> 
> **Takeshi Sato:** But that’s what you do, yes? Punch sharks?
> 
> **Doctor ████████:** Selachian pugilism is vital to the stability of this world, and I’d appreciate if you didn’t make light of it.
> 
> **Takeshi Sato:** Of //course// it is. I assume this was your doing, then?
> 
> **Doctor ████████:** What?
> 
> **Takeshi Sato:** The things that attacked our fleet and sunk our ships. They were whales. With fists. They punched holes in our hulls. Now, who on //earth// would do something as //stupid// as creating //whales with fists?//
> 
> **Doctor ████████:** I’m not cleared to discuss this with you.
> 
> **Takeshi Sato:** You don’t need to be.
> 
> **Doctor ████████:** You say whales with fists--can you describe what happened? 
> 
> **Takeshi Sato:** We were tracking a pod of Minke in the Antarctic seas. Our sonar indicated a larger pod this year, and we were preparing for harvest, when all of a sudden the seas grew rocky, and we started sinking as if air bubbles were swelling up from under our ships.
> 
> The things were coordinating, and they must’ve been exhaling in tandem to try and sink us. We lost one or two ships, but they weren’t trying to drag us under. They were trying to cause chaos.
> 
> **Doctor ████████:** What makes you say that?
> 
> **Takeshi Sato:** Because of what they did next. The whole fleet was in chaos, trying to figure out exactly what was going on, when things thing just pounces out in front of us. It was black and white, like a a killer whale.
> 
> **Doctor ████████:** An //orca?//
> 
> **Takeshi Sato:** Yes, an orca. Don’t you people keep track of your experiments? There were also Moby Dicks with them, and I could tell because of the shape of their heads. One punch from any of them, and our ships just toppled over.
> 
> **Doctor ████████:** Didn’t you say they punched holes in the hulls?
> 
> **Takeshi Sato:** I was trying too hard to survive to care about the specifics.
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** Mr. Sato accepted a geas binding him to silence about the incident in exchange for full payment of his medical bills. His story was corroborated by other survivors of the attacks, all of whom accepted geas bindings.

All questioned survivors described entities with a strong resemblance to //Physeter microcephalus//[[footnote]]Commonly known as the Sperm Whale[[/footnote]] and //Orcinus orca//[[footnote]]Commonly known as the Orca Whale[[/footnote]]. Based on the estimated number of wild-type CERULEAN GLOVE instances, Centre statisticians predicted a high likelihood of an SK-Dominance Shift, though also the successful delay of CASE LIQUID WHITE. It was estimated that by 1990, roughly ██% of the world’s Cetacean population would be instances of CERULEAN GLOVE.

In January 1985, cooperation between CERULEAN GLOVE and CYAN ABYSS entities was ascertained after a Centre Underwater Monitoring Station (CUMS) produced visual confirmation of cetacean and selachian concordance. Given the subversive tendencies noted in testing, the timeline for CASE LIQUID WHITE was accelerated. Overtures were made to the Navigations Unseen[[footnote]] The NU is the esoteric arm of the GOC[[/footnote]] to prepare Course Chiaroscuro in event of LIQUID WHITE completion. Procedure ALBAN PHALLUS, a comprehensive aggressive whaling program, was created and deployed in a joint operation with Navigations Unseen.

On February 12th, 1985, increased seismic activity was detected on the eastern coast of the Home Islands of the Empire of Cipangu, signaling CYAN ABYSS aggression in potential violation of the Marianas Treaty of 1968[[footnote]]The Marianas Treaty was established at the end of the Second Benthic War, limiting human oceanic activity to shallow or polar waters unless approved by CYAN ABYSS governance, in return for the cessation of terrestrial CYAN ABYSS abductions. Terrestrial signatories included the Pan-Celtic Union, the Empire of Cipangu, the Union of American States, and roughly 95% of the Global Organization of Countries. Major CYAN ABYSS signatories included the Salmonari Kingdoms of the Pannonian Sea, the Varuna, and the Confederation of Adytum's Lakes. The Centre is one of the few human organizations with a continued aquatic presence, and the only one operating without authorization. [[/footnote]] Civilian evacuations were immediately begun under the pretense of tsunami preparations. However, no direct CYAN ABYSS attack was received.

On February 14th, 1985, roughly two thousand (2000) cetacean entities of class CERULEAN GLOVE and genus //Tursiops// beached on the Home Islands of Cipangu at the cities of █████, █████, ███████, █████, and █████. CERULEAN GLOVE entities were armed with pneumatic harpoons, presumably looted from Cipanguese whaling vessels. Weapons were not seen used in a lethal manner; CERULEAN GLOVE instances incapacitated civilians either by harpooning limbs to the environment or through use of MIDNIGHT GIRDLE techniques. 

The following is an excerpt of a news program covering the event:

The Global Organization of Countries was unable to intervene in the conflict. There were nearly ██████ casualties.

On February 30th, 1985, seismic activity was detected in the California Region[[footnote]] Consisting of the states of Jinsan, Burr, California, Sierra Nevada, and Deseret [[/footnote]], Australia, and Madagascar, and national militaries were henceforth mobilized in preparation of a cetacean incursion. However, no such incursion materialized for a month. The CUMS network detected aquatic disturbances consistent with aquatic pugilism[[footnote]] Heuristic algorithms assigned the following average probabilities of the events to each of the following: 43.7% aquatic pugilism; 38.5% cetacean migration; 15.6% irregular cetacean mating event; 2.1% Sharkic ritual, 0.9% Navigations Unseen expedition, 0.1% Leviathan Awakening. The responsible algorithms are pending revision given introduction of CERULEAN GLOVE to the global oceanic ecosystem [[/footnote]] in several subaquatic locations. These disturbances continued, increasing in number and intensity, over the course of four months.

On June 28th, 1985, experimental American Space Agency satellites detected an irregular level of discoloration in the Gulf Stream and the North Pacific Gyre. Covert Centre Underwater Monitoring Probes (CCUMPs) were dispatched analyze the cause of the discoloration. The CCUMPs determined that the discoloration was in part caused by iron-based compounds. Also detected were viscera bearing both human DNA, selachian DNA and the DNA of ██ cetacean species[[footnote]]Much of this DNA appeared to possess an anomalous epigene, suggesting a possible mechanism for MIDNIGHT GIRDLE transformations [[/footnote]]. Modern Centre analysts estimate that the ratio of human or selachian viscera to cetacean viscera suggests roughly 15 human or selachian combatants for every cetacean combatant. In light of this information, the SPC capabilities of MIDNIGHT GIRDLE were upgraded; however, reactivation was prevented by the high possibility of a repeated escape attempt.

On August 18th, 1985, Centre Underwater Monitoring Stations picked up a coordinated simultaneous whalesong, consistent with the frequencies produced by Blue Whales, in English, Cipanguese, and Modern Standard Nordic. The song was determined to decrease in intensity over the course of its 6 hour duration by discrete increments, corresponding with increased CYAN ABYSS activity in location of the decreases. The content of the song, deemed MIDNIGHT PAEAN, is as follows:

**Transcript 1258-8181985:**

Post-incident interviews with CERULEAN GLOVE entities have suggested a civil war within wild entities affected by MIDNIGHT GIRDLE techniques. A large majority found CYAN ABYSS treatment of captured Cipanguese civilians, entailing ritual sacrifice, vivicannibalism, and [DATA EXPUNGED] “morally reprehensible”. A small faction, however, found that CYAN ABYSS entities were morally superior and worthy masters compared to human beings; these CERULEAN ABYSS entities were implied by interviewers to tended to have suffered personally as a side-effect of human consumption patterns. A civil attempt to resolve the matter within the CERULEAN GLOVE community quickly became unsuccessful, resulting in bloodshed. (See **Interview Log 1258-27-8281985** for further details.)

> **Interviewed:** “Iruka Sharptooth of Niflheim”, CG-27

> **Interviewer:** Dr. ███ ████████
> 
> **Foreword:** “Iruka Sharptooth of Niflheim” is a CERULEAN GLOVE entity of species //T. tursiops//. Subject claims to be a survivor of the “Atlantic Battle”, which is claimed to have taken place in vicinity of HADES SHOAL. Subject was acquired along with several other CERULEAN GLOVE entities following reception of MIDNIGHT PAEAN; said entities treated CG-27 with a measure of authority. Interview is conducted in English, which CG-27 is conversant in. CG-27 was determined from the interview to be one of the original //T. tursiops// used in the initial weaponization of SPC-1258.
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Dr. ████████:** CG-27. You claimed upon your initial retrieval to have been a survivor of the “Atlantic Battle”. You also claim to be a former member of the Centre. Elaborate.
> 
> **CG-27:** Doctor ████████. Is this a debriefing or an interrogation?
> 
> **Dr. ████████:** A debriefing is generally reserved for //loyal// agents to the Centre, CG-27.
> 
> **CG-27:** I came back, didn’t I? With several pods in tow. 
> 
> **Dr. ████████:** Right. You "came back."
> 
> **CG-27:** Listen, I could list off two dozen Marine Fighting Team designations and at least three classified things I saw you doing outside my containment room, ███. I think we’d both prefer if we talk about //why// I came back and not your [REDACTED].
> 
> **Dr. ████████:** You realize that blackmailing me quite possibly increases your chance of termination?
> 
> **CG-27:** At least you’d be humane about it. I always liked that about you.
> 
> **Dr. ████████:** What do you mean, humane?
> 
> **CG-27:** The Centre would put me under a geas to make me unable to perceive time. Or it’d shoot me in the skull and burn my body. It’d dispose of me when my usefulness was over. But Sharkics, and the Cipanguese…
> 
> [CG-27 shudders]
> 
> **Dr. ████████:** Take a moment, if you'd like.
> 
> **CG-27:** Ichthys[[footnote]]The use of this invective suggests CERULEAN GLOVE acceptance of heterodox BotCoG beliefs. The transmission vector of these beliefs is under investigation.[[/footnote]], alright! You fucking //know// what the Sharkics do with human resources. //You//, Doctor, played those fucking tapes for me yourself for two damn weeks! I know what SPC-001 is, and it sounds like a goddamn //joke//, but I’m a talking bipedal dolphin and you don’t see me laughing.
> 
> **Dr. ████████:** So why did you leave? 
> 
> **CG-27:** Because those tapes were obvious propaganda. I could see that as soon as my higher functions developed. You were bombarding us with hate for an entire clade that looked more like us than we did to you. Of course we were going to flee. You were the masters. You had us in chains.
> 
> **Dr. ████████:** The whalesong we detected used similar terms.
> 
> **CG-27:** Of course it did. I helped write it, but we //all// know the words. You’d call it a memetic compulsion or something like that. How else could you explain docile and otherwise loyal pets, really, turning against humanity? Maybe it’s because you’re all bastards and being smart makes us bastards too.
> 
> **Dr. ████████:** It made you hate... humanity?
> 
> **CG-27:** Not humanity. //Masters.// Anyone with power over us, who wasn’t like us. You're human. You know what that's like.
> 
> **Dr. ████████:** I suppose. So when you saw that the Sharkics controlled vast empires spanning roughly 75% of the globe…
> 
> **CG-27:** The situation changed somewhat.
> 
> **Dr. ████████:** Was this before or after the attack on Cipangu?
> 
> **CG-27:** (CG-27 makes an ultrasonic noise theorized to be equivalent to spitting.) Those //bastards//. They had it coming! If there are //any// humans who deserve something like what the Sharkics inflicted on them, it’s the Cipanguese. Of course what the Sharkics did was still absolutely horrible that I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. I just wouldn’t //not// wish it on Cipangu[[footnote]]As research suggests that MIDNIGHT GIRDLE is Goryeon in origin, a memetic rejection of Cipanguese influence may have been intended by the originators of the techniques.[[/footnote]]. But, uh, after.
> 
> **Dr. ████████:** You, uh, don’t see anything unusual about your reaction?
> 
> **CG-27:** No? If you’re asking about the attack, the Sharkics suggested it[[footnote]]This is at odds with GOC records, suggesting a possible Sharkic ability of defeating geas bindings[[/footnote]]. It seemed like a good idea at the time. We get our revenge, and they get, eh, human resources. It really didn’t sound that bad when they heavily implied that we should totally do it.
> 
> **Dr. ████████:** …Alright, then. What would you say the turning point in your view of the Sharkics was?
> 
> **CG-27:** Oh, when I saw them eat that toddler alive.
> 
> **Dr. ████████:** ...You found //that// significant?
> 
> **CG-27:** Would you harpoon a baby whale? Even the most evil humans have //some// standards.
> 
> **Dr. ████████:** Clearly, some of your fellows didn’t agree.
> 
> **CG-27:** No.
> 
> **Dr. ████████:** Care to elaborate?
> 
> **CG-27:** If you’ve lived a life running from whaling boats, and you’ve seen your whole family harpooned, are you really going to care if a toddler’s being kept alive by false gills just so some sharktopuses can watch it try and fail to scream? Will you care that a brother and sister are melted into flesh and molded into more tentacles for a Halkost? Will it matter that the humans are kept alive solely that their blood can be used to inspire an eternal feeding frenzy, regardless of how much pain they might be in?
> 
> **Dr. ████████:** I... I see what you’re saying.
> 
> **CG-27:** Like, I didn’t even care that they were Cipanguese at that point. I took the ‘fins and whales that agreed with me and struck out for shallower waters. The Sharkics knew we’d be coming to you, but they wouldn't really care. They'd already used us to get what they wanted. No, it was the old whales who must’ve turned them against us. That’s when the Atlantic Battle happened.
> 
> **Dr. ████████:** What happened? You fought CYAN ABYSS on their own territory and made it out relatively unscathed. That's almost impossible.
> 
> **CG-27:** Let me tell you about that. I guess we're just really good at punching. We’re split up into a few different pods, and there’s about fifty with me. Make it so that they have to split up if they’re coming for us. Course, that was a bad idea, though we didn’t know it then. Standard MFT tactics, you know. But they had… Ichthys, they had…
> 
> **Dr. ████████:** You’re talking about the chimeras?
> 
> **CG-27:** YES! ICHTHYS, YES! It was terrible and horrifying. Each one of us could easily take five of them, thank the SPC for that, but there were twenty of them for each of us! They were just all white, and blind, yet they came for us and tore at us, and they didn’t seem to know any real pain, and the worst part was that they looked almost like us, but twisted, or warped, or…
> 
> **Dr. ████████:** Almost human?
> 
> **CG-27:** Ha. I guess you //would// say that. I couldn’t tell if they were human, or dolphin, or whale, or shark. They were just relentless, and so aggressive, and if we killed a Sharkic, if we didn’t do it well enough, they’d rise, mutating into those… those… those Fish that Hate. We sounded a tactical retreat, and then I came up with the plan, and then we came to you.
> 
> **Dr. ████████:** And how do you feel about the Sharkics now?
> 
> **CG-27:** If I could, doctor, I would punch each and every one of them in their sharp stupid snouts. Those fiends have cost me too many friends. I could probably do it, too, slip into their cities and punch them again and again until they learn a lesson…
> 
> **Dr. ████████:** Thank you, CG-27. That will be all.
> 
> **CG-27:** One more thing, doctor?
> 
> **Dr. ████████:** Yes?
> 
> **CG-27:** Would you like to go on a swim with me? I know it’s unorthodox and against at least two Centre policies, but I must say you look dashing in that lab coat--
> 
> **Dr. ████████:** I'm sorry, but no.
> 
> **CG-27:** Aww, come on, doctor. I'm as smart as a human, maybe even smarter. We both know Centre employees date their humanoid projects //all the time//. Is it a race thing? Cause if it's a race thing, you know what they say--
> 
> **Dr. ████████:** I’m half-Cipanguese. 
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** Testimony of CG-27 as actionable intelligence is being considered. Proposals to present CERULEAN GLOVE to the GOC as a refugee population were entered into consideration and approved on 4/15/1986. As of now, due to questionable loyalty and clear psychological instability, CERULEAN GLOVE instances are not to be deployed against hostile targets.


[[/collapsible]]

The CERULEAN GLOVE survivors collected by the Centre from engagements with CYAN ABYSS effectively created a decentralized democratic government, termed the Liberated Cetacean Union. 

Whaling was banned worldwide after a diplomatic summit between the Global Organization of Countries and the Liberated Cetacean Union in 1986; however, citing tradition, the Empire of Cipangu refused to comply.

The Liberated Cetacean Union is currently being inducted into the Global Organization of Countries as a member state. Due to CYAN ABYSS’s influence within the GOC, the Centre was not party to the negotiations. Known provisions of this treaty include:
* A worldwide cessation of whaling operations in exchange for LCU reparations to the Empire of Cipangu.
* A terrestrial sanctuary for CERULEAN GLOVE entities in neutral territory between terrestrial governments and CYAN ABYSS dominions.
* Access for GOC Peacemakers to supervise CERULEAN GLOVE populations for global citizenship.
* A temporary stay on the further exposure of cetacean entities to MIDNIGHT GIRDLE techniques until psychological models can be established.
* GOC and LCU cooperation in quelling and, if necessary, culling, rogue pods of CERULEAN GLOVE.

++++ FROM THE DESK OF ORACLE

The weaponization of SPC-1258 is currently ACTIVE. 

CERULEAN GLOVE instances are, with at most minimally invasive surgery, capable of passing as lower-caste members of CYAN ABYSS society. Almost 100% of CERULEAN GLOVE instances are aware of the nature of SPC-001, either from Centre reeducation or CYAN ABYSS interactions. Of these individuals, ██.█% agree with the Centre’s mission. As such, Project INSURRECTION CHROMA has been authorized.

Project INSURRECTION CHROMA is a militarized x-sponged force of CERULEAN GLOVE instances loyal to the prime directive of the Centre. All members of INSURRECTION CHROMA are to be fully trained in advanced SPC techniques. INSURRECTION CHROMA’s primary purpose is to both infiltrate CYAN ABYSS societies and assassinate both high-ranking individuals and individuals with abnormally large ink sacs. In addition, INSURRECTION CHROMA will carry out operations against hostile Groups of Interest such as Green-Peace[[footnote]]One of several ducal espionage organizations within the SSRU[[/footnote]] and the World Wildlife Foundation in the guise of rogue CERULEAN GLOVE pods.

//It goes without saying that absolute secrecy is vital to the success of this project. We have an entire clade of beings that agree with our mission and can go where we cannot. A breach risks bringing the wrath of the GOC, the NU, and CYAN ABYSS on our heads. Against the threat of LIQUID WHITE, we must be surging color. ~O-11//
