[[/div]]

**Item #:** SCP-2993

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2993 is to be contained in a standard secure locker at Site-19. Access to SCP-2993 is available only to staff Level 2 and above. Any personnel wishing to use SCP-2993 must contact the current leading researcher assigned to SCP-2993.

**Description:** SCP-2993 appears to be an unremarkable standard pair of aviator sunglasses with no visible markings or logos and standard durability.

When viewed from the front, SCP-2993 is opaque and acts as a mirror. Replacing parts of SCP-2993 while preserving its original function is possible as long as more than 50% of the original mass is present. No form of radiation is able to pass through SCP-2993. The fact that this breaks the laws of thermodynamics is pending investigation. Attempts to recreate the radiation blocking abilities of SCP-2993 has failed - when individual components are removed from SCP-2993, they no longer shield against radiation.

The most notable feature of SCP-2993 occurs when it is viewed from behind: SCP-2993 shows 6 hours, 17 minutes, and 32 seconds behind the period of time the user is wearing them (see Addendum SCP-2993-1).

**Recovery:** SCP-2993 was recovered on ██/██/2005 in the home of Mr. ████████ ████, a ██████ Professor at [DATA EXPUNGED]. Foundation personnel were dispatched when Professor ██████ triggered multiple keywords on online forums under the pen name [DATA EXPUNGED]. When questioned on how he came to possess SCP-2993, Professor ██████ claimed the object was purchased at a yard sale while he was on vacation in Florida. The subject does not remember any details on where he purchased SCP-2993, as he claims he was "on the road for a while and was getting tired when [he] saw a sign, and randomly stopped." Professor ██████ willingly gave SCP-2993 to agents after being told they were an experimental product that had been stolen.

**Addendum SCP-2993-1:** A junior Researcher under Dr. ████████ compared security footage to the view through SCP-2993 while searching for any abnormalities that lead to the containment breach of [DATA EXPUNGED]. Security footage showed Junior Researcher B█████ writing on a piece of paper "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." 6 hours, 17 minutes, and 30 seconds later, junior Researcher B█████ (using SCP-2993) noted that the sentence read, "A mad boxer shot a quick, gloved jab to the jaw of his dizzy opponent." It should be noted that both sentences Junior Researcher B█████ wrote contain all twenty-six letters of the alphabet.

Further testing has revealed that the past as viewed through SCP-2993 contains many minor changes. Examples include Junior Researcher B█████'s hair as shoulder-length instead of neck-length, an Agent's first name spelled as Hannah instead of Hanna, and the color of Dr ████████'s favorite pen appeared green instead of red. 

//Further testing is requested// - Dr. ████████ 

APPROVED - O5-█

**Addendum SCP-2993-2:** Due to differences in details found when viewing the past while wearing SCP-2993 (detailed in Addendum SCP-2993-1), Dr ████████ used SCP-2993 to look over notes he had taken on SCP-████ 6 hours 17 minutes and 30 seconds before. The notes on SCP-████ appeared to be minimally different, excluding [DATA EXPUNGED]. Although this difference appears negligible, the difference in [DATA EXPUNGED] could lead to an XK-Class End of The World Scenario.

Although these dimensions would have caused a containment breach for SCP-████ approximately three hours later, when Dr. ████████ used SCP-2993 to observe the containment area of SCP-████, SCP-████ did not [DATA EXPUNGED], and no containment breach occurred. 

It has been theorized that SCP-2993 does not view the past of our universe, but the present of another universe that is exactly 6 hours 17 minutes and 32 seconds behind ours. //Testing of this theory is requested// - Dr.████████.

APPROVED - O5-█

At 23:54, █/██/2006, Dr. ████████ reviewed notes on SCP-2993. Exactly 6 hours, 17 minutes, and 30 seconds later, Dr. ████████ donned SCP-2993 and viewed himself looking over his notes. While most content was unchanged, a testing log had been appended, containing tests that had Dr. ████████ had never conducted, included here:

**Past-Experiment-Log-X-1**

SCP-2993 tapped lightly with a hammer. No effect
SCP-2993 forcibly hit with a hammer. No effect.
SCP-2993 dropped from a ten meters. No effect.
SCP-2993 dropped from 30 meters. No effect
SCP-2993 dropped from 100 meters. No effect.
SCP-2993 shot with a 9mm handgun. No effect.
SCP-2993 shot with a .50 caliber rifle. No effect.
SCP-2993 introduced to temperatures of over ███ degrees Kelvin. No effect.
*It should be re-noted that SCP-2993 is no more durable than a regular pair of sunglasses

-//I am now questioning whether SCP-2993 is viewing into another universe as had been first theorized, or if, instead of showing a parallel universe, SCP-2993 shows the past of our universe in an imperfect manner with some minor differences.// - Dr. ████████

//Testing of this theory is requested and is pending authorization//
