**Special Containment Procedures:** The Foundation will monitor major metropolitan areas of Italy between January and March of each year. Foundation drones are equipped to recognize any signs of SCP-5770 being organized and/or set up.

The Foundation will coordinate with Italy's External Intelligence and Security Agency to ensure the closure of  the Piazza Della Signoria in the event of an SCP-5770 manifestation. Due to the popularity of the piazza, the justification of a sinkhole has been devised. MTF Zeta-66 "Guardian Angels" will guard the outer perimeters of the piazza to prevent the public from entering. All human entry into the piazza will be barred[[footnote]] Other than MTF Zeta-66. [[/footnote]] until the anomaly either removes itself or is removed forcibly.

If SCP-5770 needs to be removed forcibly, known as a "Frozen Over Event," MTF Zeta-66 will enter the piazza and/or the Palazzo Vecchio and attempt to detain SCP-5770-1 and SCP-5770-2. Whether this fails or succeeds, Zeta-66 will be tasked with the removal of the festival stage, tents, and any other structures built during an SCP-5770 manifestation.



[[include component:image-block name=FestivalStage.png|align=right|width=37%|caption=Approx. area where the stage is set up.]]

**Description:** SCP-5770 designates a 10 day festival in the Piazza della Signoria of Florence, Italy. SCP-5770 occurs every 70 years on the 7th Sunday of the given year. The Foundation's investigation of SCP-5770 took place on February 14, 2021. Events during SCP-5770 include live entertainment and stage shows ranging from anomalous to mundane.

Three weeks before SCP-5770, tents will be constructed within the Piazza Della Signoria. During the next week, decor of the colors gold, white, and black begin to be placed on the tents and surrounding buildings. Sometime leading up to SCP-5770, a large wooden stage will be placed in front of the Palazzo Vecchio. All of these are removed after the conclusion of SCP-5770. All attempts that were made to record the construction and subsequent destruction of SCP-5770 were unsuccessful.

A stage show known as //La Scalata// serves as the "main event" of SCP-5770. //La Scalata// is led by two humanoid entities who resemble animate marble statues from the Augustan period[[footnote]] 43 B.C. to 18 A.D. [[/footnote]] of Ancient Rome. The entities, designated SCP-5770-1 and SCP-5770-2, refer to themselves as The Staff Bearer and The Enduror respectively. 

//La Scalata// is a set of short, ritualistic stage shows surrounding the theme of sin and purity.  Each day of //La Scalata// depicts SCP-5770-1 speaking to the audience about a specific sin and the punishment that would supposedly accompany said sin in Hell. During this speech, a sinner or sinners will be brought onto the stage to serve as examples for the audience. The punishment will then be performed onto the sinners ultimately leading to their deaths.

+++ **Addendum 5770.1:** Discovery and Background
According to SCP-5770-1, SCP-5770 has happened every 70 years for the past 700 years. SCP-5770 has flown under the Foundation’s radar due to the complete absence of reports of the anomalous activity going on within SCP-5770. The Foundation caught wind of SCP-5770 while working to stabilize former fascist countries after World War II. On February 18, 1951, Battalion-36 "Colossians" were stationed in Florence and began to slowly cut off communication with the Foundation. On February 28, all communication ceased from Battalion-36. Foundation officials sent Battalion-21 "Romans" into the city to investigate the supposed disappearance.

Battalion-36 were found in front of the stage and soaked in water as the final performance of //La Scalata// concluded. Members of Battalion-36 were questioned and admitted they had been attending SCP-5770 for the previous 10 days and described the final day's performance of //La Scalata//.  Members of Battalion-21 recalled seeing two males on the stage bowing but they did not notice anything out of the ordinary. Due to this, The Foundation hypothesized that Battalion-36 were experiencing mass psychogenic illness (colloquially known as mass hysteria) due to their lack of sleep in the weeks leading up to this event. When questioned again the next day, all members of Battalion-36 were unable to recall anything else that occurred during SCP-5770, including what they told previously, they only commented that they "felt pure." This prompted the Foundation to send a research team into the piazza on the same day. When the research team arrived, all traces of SCP-5770 had been removed and the piazza had been restored to it's former state.

The Foundation has done annual check-ups in Florence from late January to early March until 2021 when signs of SCP-5770 being set up began to reappear.

+++ **Addendum 5770.2:** Investigation into SCP-5770 

Dr. Joseph Pasqua volunteered to attend SCP-5770 and requested to take on the role of Head Researcher. Dr. Pasqua was equipped only with a body camera, a cellphone, and a journal for personal use and note-taking.

> This is my log for the supposed anomaly in Florence, Italy. I've been taking daily walks to the piazza to note any changes. Today, a stage had been 'constructed,' if I could call it that. It was placed in front of the clock tower last night. Things being placed overnight has been the standard for how the festival is being set up. For the past week or so, decorations were hung, and before that, tents were set up. Also, I've noticed that the people here are only leaving their houses to go to church; I’m yet to see a single person walking around the city for anything else.
> 
> I may as well use this as some sort of diary to run my thoughts by. This is the first time I’ve led a research expedition. This anomaly is somewhat of a legend within Site-77, we have no proof of it ever happening other than the testimonies of overworked, stress-ridden soldiers. I honestly hope this is real, I want to contain it.

++++ SCP-5770 Events - 14.2.21
+++++ Audio/Visual Log(s)
Dr. Pasqua spent the day speaking with a few SCP-5770 attendees. Dr. Pasqua mainly questioned what the festival was celebrating. Though the responses were mostly vague, people answered that it was a festival for all of them.

> **<Begin Log, [18:59]>**
> //(Dr. Pasqua pans the camera around the inner perimeter of the piazza. People are sitting, standing, conversing, and eating. As the clock turns to 19:00 everyone sitting stands up and all attendees made their way towards the stage ground. Dr. Pasqua drops the camera for an at the time unknown reason and quickly picks it up.)//
> 
> **Dr. Pasqua:** Damn it, I wasn't expecting how loud that'd be.
> 
> //(Dr. Pasqua followed behind the crowd towards the stage. The people stood there in silence and waited. Dr. Pasqua panned the camera around showing all attendees standing in concentric rows while staring to the stage.)//
> 
> **Dr. Pasqua:** (//whispering//) I guess the bell signals for the start of whatever this is.
> 
> //(Everyone in attendance begins to cheer causing Dr. Pasqua to quietly vocalize surprise. Two entities exited out of the Palazzo Vecchio and walked onto the stage to bow. The entities looked to be male humanoids made completely of white marble. They were both wearing silk black robes that ended just above their shoe-less feet. Seven thin golden belts were wrapped around their waists and torsos. One entity is holding a long wooden staff with a sharp golden tip. This entity raised his hand and the clapping ceased.)//
> 
> **SCP-5770-1:** Hello, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to this wonderful festival. I am the Staff Bearer and this is The Enduror. I welcome you to possibly a once in a lifetime experience; for these next 10 days you will be led on a journey to rediscover yourself. You, my friends, have spent your last few weeks in solidarity, contemplation, and prayer. Now we will complete your journeys. For the past 700 years, we have walked with God and delivered His swift hand of justice to the sinners who plague our world. Just as thousands of your people have before, you will hold our hands as we guide you out of the dark forest of sin. Myself and The Enduror are here to show the horrors of hell that all sinners will experience for eternity. Hopefully, upon viewing this you will decide to lead good, selfless lives. We just ask for you to watch and listen. And now, I gladly present //La Scalata//!
> 
> //(The attendees began clapping once again, this time stopping without intervention from the entities. SCP-5770-1 and SCP-5770-2 set up a large ladder that had been laid on the stage. Analysis of the footage estimates the ladder being around 60 feet tall, yet was able to lay on the much smaller stage without hanging off of either end. The ladder extended from the stage to the top of the main building before the clock tower. SCP-5770-2 enters into the clock tower and returned with a middle aged human male in standard priest clothing.)//
> 
> **SCP-5770-1:** Trust is an important concept among all creatures ranging from ants to humans. Humans are unique in their ability to build trust with people, animals, and God. That relationship with God is founded on us trusting Him and Him doing the same to us. This brings me to Father Lucio D’Angelo. Father Lucio is a priest from Abbruzzo and has been a priest for over 15 years. As we all know, a priest is our door to God’s teachings. Father Lucio, is to hold God’s hand as I have, as we all are, and teach the world His mercy. Instead, Father Lucio has done the opposite, he has turned his back on God. He has renounced our Lord and no longer believes in the teachings he has preached. Father Lucio //resents// God, he no longer //wants// to be a priest.
> 
> //(The audience hurls insults at the priest. The priest stood emotionless as the abuse rained on him.)//
> 
> **SCP-5770-1:** A man of God has betrayed God. He has betrayed all of you, and now he will now pay for his sins. Father Lucio will proclaim his betrayal for the world to see and be punished for it now and for all eternity.
> 
> //(SCP-5770-2 hands D'Angelo a torch and leads him to the ladder which he climbs followed by SCP-5770-1. A bible had been planted atop the building which D'Angelo found. He seems to contemplate himself as he looks at the Bible, he flips to a page and reads a verse to himself but stops halfway through. D'Angelo holds the Bible to the torch and and it burns in his grasp. SCP-5770-1 takes hold of the priest and leads him to the edge of the roof. D'Angelo is cast off the clock tower to the stage below. He lands on his knees and crumbles into himself. The crowd erupts as Father Lucio’s mangled body lays dead on the stage. SCP-5770-1 and SCP-5770-2 reveal two large blocks of ice. The entities lift the corpse onto one block. The body melts and boils the ice, then refreezes, securing half of the priest's body into the block. The other block is placed onto the remains which melts once again then quickly refreezes, fusing the two together. Father Lucio’s frozen body is left on the stage. The two entities bow and exit.)//
> 
> //(Dr. Pasqua leaves the stage ground and turns off the camera.)//
> **<End Log, [19:11]>**

+++++ Written Log(s)
> I need to collect my thoughts. Of all things I thought of when I heard "a festival for us" the murder of a priest was not on that list. I'm re-watching the recording and I noticed that the bell I heard is not present in the audio. I looked around after //La Scalata// ended but I saw nowhere where a bell could be. 
> 
> The best I could describe the two entities is that they looked like a bust of Caesar I saw in France a few years ago. Why did they target this priest? Why was everyone cheering for it? It's sickening. Why are they doing this? How the hell is this a journey into purity?

Dr. Pasqua notes the difference in time of people arriving to SCP-5770. On the previous day, attendees arrived at 18:30 while attendees entered at 17:00 on this day.

//Note: Analysis of this file shows no abnormalities occurring during it, proving that the events during SCP-5770 are not always anomalous. Though, it is unknown who organized this play and further non-anomalous events. ~Dr. Shirley Gillespie//

> 
> **SCP-5770-1:** This is Sergeant Lawrence Heavy, he was a soldier in the United States Marine Corps... Indeed, very noble thing to do. Possibly sacrificing your life for your country, how could I fault you for that Sergeant? Sadly, Sergeant Heavy's service was not one of honor and dignity. Instead, he made the decision to murder his brother in arms in a ravenous fit of rage.
> 
> //(SCP-5770-2 reappears with another male soldier in a similar uniform to Heavy. The man's skin resembled a mix between the entities and a white human. It is hypothesized that the man is in a transition state into one of the entities. Heavy turned to look at who was coming on the stage. Upon seeing him, Heavy began to cry and fell to his knees.)//
> 
> **SCP-5770-1:** Save the tears, you had no regrets then and none now, we can see through your facade. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is the man that Lawrence Heavy murdered. He betrayed his fellow soldier and had no regrets when doing it. This was a person he was supposed to fight with, his brother... he killed his brother. Here, show them how you did it.
> 
> //(SCP-5770-2 hands Sergeant Heavy an M18 handgun who takes hold of it. Heavy picks himself up and shoots the other soldier in the back of the head. The man fell to the stage. Upon analysis of the video, there is no visible blood from the wound. The soldier starts to weep again and lays on the stage. The crowd began to curse at Heavy. SCP-5770-1 gestures off stage and a skinny old man wearing stained gray pants and a muddy sweatshirt walks up.)//
> 
> **SCP-5770-1:** This is Andrea Incavare, he is a homeless man from Naples. For years, he begged for food, water, and money. He was able to live. Though it was uncomfortable, it was life, and is not to be taken for granted. Similarly to all of his other days, Andrea was begging for food and money and he received donations which he put to use to sustain himself. That night, Andrea encountered a woman who had taken a liking to him. She has given Andrea twenty-five euros on various occasions. Did Andrea thank this selfless person? No, he decided to betray the small relationship this woman had build with him.
> 
> //(SCP-5770-1 leads a tall blonde woman onto the stage. She is wearing a black business suit and her skin appears to be the same as the unnamed solder. Incavare tries to leave the stage but SCP-5770-2 takes hold of him.)//
> 
> **SCP-5770-1:** This woman gave him the money to survive and how did he repay her? Andrea strangled her and stole her money. Ladies and Gentlemen, an act of kindness by a stranger was met with murder. Andrea, I want you to show them what you did.
> 
> //(Incavare is released from the hold and paces towards the woman. He punches her in the back of the head and wraps his hands around her neck. The woman chokes to death and Incavare releases his grasp. The crowd yells obscenities to Incavare.)//

++++ SCP-5770 Events - 16.2.21
It is unknown how and when SCP-5770-1 and SCP-5770-2 place the structures and items used for their sacrifices. For this reason, Dr. Pasqua requested another camera which he set up for surveillance of the stage area. He placed the camera on the morning of February 16.

The day's proceedings involve the execution of James Wilson and Alana Semenov. for the stated reason that they we're lying and defrauding people for profit. Wilson had venomous snakes bite onto his chest and neck and Semenov had her neck snapped.

++++ SCP-5770 Events - 17.2.21

At 1800 hours, Dr. Pasqua notes a commotion occuring near a gazebo and makes his way towards it. He discovers that a wedding is taking place and questions who would want to get married here. The wedding, for the most part, was non-anomalous until the vows, where the groom revealed a living Japanese Spider Crab. The priest and groom remove the legs and claws, which are discarded, and hand the body to the bride. She removes part of the shell and eats some of the crab meat. 

Day four saw execution of Franklin Alonso, a murderer from Louisiana, USA who had manipulated people into dangerous situations for his entertainment. SCP-5770-1 references a time when Alonso had promised methamphetamine to a person if they would engage with an alligator. Alonso's punishment was to be boiled alive in a brass cauldron. The water had had been dyed red for an unknown reason.

After this execution, Dr. Pasqua ran to a secluded corner of the piazza to vomit. He claimed that he was not expecting how brutal this punishment was. Dr. Pasqua had been fairly talkative to site-command and within his logs before this event. Further logs saw less comments and conversation became shorter.

------

++++ SCP-5770 Events - 18.2.21
The day's proceedings involved the execution of Eric Kuris, a Canadian cult leader, and two of his followers. The men were locked into wooden coffins which were set aflame, reducing the coffins and men to piles of ash[[footnote]] No bones or fragments of bones were seen in the ash. [[/footnote]]. The stated reason for this punishment was that they committed heresy by making their own belief system. Dr. Pasqua stated that he was confused by the severity of the punishments as it was not a violent crime or hurt anyone to not believe in a certain faith.

Dr. Pasqua had left his body camera on for the rest of the night. He paced around his room and reviewed footage for four hours after the day's events had concluded.

> I checked the ash piles and I didn't see any bones. So they punished those people for a different belief system. Like I said in the aud/vis log, It's weird that they kill those people who just believe something different.
> 
> A bit off topic but I need to write about my thoughts from yesterday. I was taken by surprise a bit and my reaction was unprofessional. I find it interesting that the entities brought up how Alonso coaxed people into dangerous situations. You don't really think of that when someone says murderer. I'm having no problem with my investigation. I wonder what I'll see tomorrow.

SCP-5770-1 states that they are punishing the sin of greed as SCP-5770-2 exits from the Palazzo Vecchio. SCP-5770-2 is followed by Karl Godebert, the president of a German water company, and Maryanne Aurum, a hoarder who purchased stores worth of necessities to resell during a crisis. A wooden structure resembling gallows was set up on the stage. Hanging from the top beam were two golden blocks. The rope connecting the gold blocks to the structure were cut while Aurum and Godebert laid under them. They were quickly crushed to death.

The entities punished the sin of gluttony. SCP-5770-2 entered onto the stage with a man of Asian decent and three adult German Shepards. SCP-5770-1 claimed that Jin Wu, a Chinese CEO, had overworked his employees and architects which led to the deaths of 60 people within two years. Wu was first crucified by the entities with rope. A bucket, which had been set on the stage before //La Scalata// began, was revealed to contain animal fat which was spread on Wu's body. SCP-5770-2 released the dogs which quickly consumed Wu.

++++ SCP-5770 Events - 22.2.21
Dr. Pasqua notices that the hole from 19.2.21 had been expanded 6 meters in width and length and filled with salt.

15 minutes before //La Scalata// began, the temperature dropped about 10 degrees and it began to rain heavily. The punished sin was adultery or lust. SCP-5770-1 had claimed that Kendra Boivin and Jacques Débile had been in a relationship while they were both were married. They were cricified and left to succumb to the elements. After 10 hours, all life function ceased and the weather returned to normal.  The hole had been completely filled with rainwater upon the deaths of Boivin and Débile.

> **<Begin Log, [6:57]>**
> **Dr. Pasqua:** I was planning on coming here in a few hours but I saw the people in the streets and followed them here. I guess we're having another early day[[footnote]] The previous day's instance of //La Scalata// began at 7:11. [[/footnote]]. Everyone has a mask today for some reason.
> 
> //(Dr. Pasqua pans the camera to groups of people holding masks of plague doctors, clowns, and faces. All have been decorated in extravagant colors with the most common being gold.  Dr. Pasqua comments on the bell and turns his attention to the stage. Along the edge of the stage is all the bodies of the sinners in order that they have been killed. SCP-5770-1 and Enduror appear with golden masks of faces in their hands.)//
> 
> **SCP-5770-1:** Hello for the final time my friends, this is the last day of //La Scalata// and our festival. We have seen the most awful sinners and we have punished them all, but we are all sinners. Sin is an unavoidable part of life, it is when you welcome sin and let it become a part of you when justice needs to be delivered. For all of us, damnation is a possibility. So, just as the sinners have experienced what their hell is like, we will experience ours. Eternal darkness and unfeeling is what waits for us if we do not repent. I implore you to put on your blinding masks and enter the water in front of us.
> 
> //(All attendees put on their masks and organize themselves into ten lines and enter the water. They lay themselves out and float. Dr. Pasqua has moved behind a pillar at this point. As soon as everyone entered SCP-5770-1 and Enduror place their masks on and lay in the water.)//
> 
> **Dr. Pasqua:** //(whispering)// I don't think they know I'm here.
> 
> //(The people in the pool floated silently for ten minutes. SCP-5770-1 instructed everyone out of the pool and to remove their masks.)//
> 
> **SCP-5770-1:** This has been //La Scalata//, with all that we've experienced these last ten days I thank you for joining us on this journey. We are now out of the dark forest of sin and have become pure. We've secured our place in heaven and it is now your job to protect it. Enjoy the rest of the day, my friends. //(The crowd cries for joy and applauds as SCP-5770-1 and SCP-5770-2 bow and exit.)//

> My conclusion is The Staff Bearer wanted to show us the punishments of hell so we don't do them. A very brutal way of showing it. Those people seemed so happy after they left that pool. A part of me wishes I could join in. I want to be pure. I can't shake this feeling since I saw the d-class. It's overwhelming. I just have to suppress it.
> 
> It's the final day of my investigation and I'm happy to head back home and to Site-77. I'm going to check out the festival grounds one last time. I think The Staff Bearer and The Enduror live in the clock tower, so I'll try to see if I can get it. I've been trying the door for a few days but it has been completely locked.

> 
> **Dr: Pasqua:** Alright. //(He sits.)// Why is that?
> 
> **SCP-5770-1:** You and your people disrupted it once before. Either become accustomed to how people behave before the festival or stay out.
> 
> **Dr: Pasqua:** And how do people become "accustomed" exactly?
> 
> **SCP-5770-1:** They spent their days in church and prayer and you want to stop them from celebrating that? At least your some of your soldiers followed that practice and they were welcomed with open arms. Then the others came in and confused and scared my guests. You always watch the stage, trying to get a peek behind the curtain. My guests are here to enjoy themselves, not have to worry about a doctor who thinks they can understand the whys and hows of everything.
> 
> **Dr: Pasqua:** Your guests? Are you the ones who set this all up?
> 
> **SCP-5770-1:** No, I didn't set this up. The only thing I had a hand in planning was that wedding. Like I said, you were watching the stage rather intently and we had to get you away. Other than that I have no say in any of this and never have.
> 
> **Dr. Pasqua:** Then who did?
> 
> **SCP-5770-1:** That’s not for me to say, unfortunately.
> 
> **Dr. Pasqua:** You refuse to say or you can’t?
> 
> **SCP-5770-1:** You can decide that. Whether I know or not is not for me to say. All I may tell you is that //you// were not supposed to be //here//.
> 
> **Dr. Pasqua:** //I// wasn't supposed to be here? You and what you do are unnatural. Whether I was supposed to be here or not, I can say that you two were never supposed to be a part of our world.
> 
> **SCP-5770-1:** Believe that if you must.
> 
> **Dr. Pasqua:** I will. What are you?
> 
> **SCP-5770-1:** That's a difficult question, my friend.
> 
> **Dr. Pasqua:** Answer me!
> 
> **SCP-5770-1:** Come people have called us angels, ghosts, and gods, you've called us demons. We’re none of those things. The fact is that we //are// here for everyone who was //supposed// to be at this festival.
> 
> **Dr. Pasqua:** That doesn’t answer the question.
> 
> **SCP-5770-1:** If that’s the case then I don't think I have an answer.

> 
> **SCP-5770-1:** It's not for you to know nor does it matter in this point in my life.
> 
> **Dr. Pasqua:** Why have you done this festival for the last 700 years?
> 
> **SCP-5770-1:** I guess I didn't make it clear before, we do this festival and perform //La Scalata// to help everyone who joined us.
> 
> **Dr. Pasqua:** //(He scoffs.)// Helping people? You murder people and expect me to believe that?
> 
> **SCP-5770-1:** That's where you're wrong Joseph, we killed those //sinners// to show those people what is waiting for them if they decide to commit those sins. We’re not evil, Hell is evil, those sinners are evil. We destroy evil so those people decide against it.
> 
> **Dr. Pasqua:** You’re lying to yourself if you believe that.
> 
> **SCP-5770-1:** Those sinners died for the greater good of those people. You should know something about the greater good, shouldn’t you, doctor?
> 
> **Dr. Pasqua:** This has nothing to do with me and what I do. Why did you kill people who didn't believe the same as you? You killed men who made their own faith.
> 
> **SCP-5770-1:** This very much does have something to do with you.
> 
> **Dr. Pasqua:** Answer my question, how do their beliefs constitute their deaths?
>  
> **SCP-5770-1:** They are sinners who must be punished, I don't make the rules, I'm simply a follower. //(pause)// You could put on this persona all you want. Your illusion has been shattered and you’re scrambling to piece it back together. You’ve been scared since the day I punished that murderer. You noticed that we’re similar in our ways and now you’re questioning yourself and what you built for 17 years. Don’t deny it, for the first time in 17 years you feel guilty.
> 
> **Dr. Pasqua:** I don't feel guilty. I do good work.
> 
> **SCP-5770-1:** Remember the man you made test out [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-512 that umbrella]. They never found his body. How about the three people you sent to investigate [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-649 that laughter]? You left them stranded. You didn't even try to help them.

And yet, you promised all those people happiness and freedom if they pet those wolves, right? You're a liar.

Upon his return to Site-77, Dr. Pasqua handed in his personal journal and cameras. After a meeting with Site Director Gillespie regarding the investigation, Dr. Pasqua relinquished his Foundation key-card. He was offered amnestics, which he refused, and a level 4 clearance level. Following another meeting, Dr. Pasqua accepted the position.
