Christmas Alone

Researcher Zyn sat
Contemplating the wooden
Tabletop surface.

Christmas was now here
And here she was at night in
White Foundation garb.

All were at home, or
Else getting ready to go,
And he sat alone.

“Such a horrid way
To spend Christmas evening,”
She thought to herself.

“In an underground
Bunker, surrounded by all
Sorts of nightmare things.”

She should be at home,
With friends and parents this night,
Feasting on his gains.

But she is stuck here.
In a godforsaken Site,
To guard some soup bowl.

Her stomach growls and,
She rises, to procure some
Nourishment tonight.

With the fridge empty
And the cooks gone for the night,
A thought comes to her.

Camera goes down,
Password is entered, and now,
Into the chamber.

It sits there, all pale
And fragile, waiting for a
Person to cheer up.

Hopefully a small
Paper cut will do the trick,
A small clean up job.

Yes; the bowl fills up
And warm, delicious smells waft
Up to her nostrils.

She knows the effects,
But they are minor and not
Worth too much concern.

Sipping up a bit,
Zyn thinks to herself some more:
Why stay here tonight?

As he drinks up, the
Answers become clearer and
Clearer, till the half.

She is alone now, yes.
But she still sees them and knows
They are safe at night.

It is a hard price
Knowledge of such horrid things,
Enough to go white.

Yet, at the same time
Having the power to fight
Even a small part

Means she knows, every
Night, her family will still
Be there in the morn.

Separate now, yes.
But being alone tonight
Is almost worth it.

She swallows the last
And looks inside the bowl.
No message for her.

It would have been nice,
But alas; she must resume
Work or be caught here.

Still, some thinking time
Was nice to have, and she now
Feels much, much better.

Christmas alone sucks,
But if she can keep those close safe,
That’s enough for her.

Meanwhile, in the bowl,
Words form to make the statement:
“You have done so well.”

This was a triumph.
We’re making a note here, it’s contained.
It’s hard to overstate our satisfaction.
We’re the Foundation.
We’re here to secure, contain, protect.
For the good of all the world,
We keep anomalous stuff,

Away from the people, for humanity’s sake,
We have 682, and also the Keter Cakes.
We get so much science done,
While we have a little fun,
And keep humanity still alive.

The lizard’s damn angry,
It wants to tear our heads right off
We’ll just have to keep trying to kill it
So tear it to pieces
And throw every piece into acid.
Maybe that won’t work because
It is so hard to destroy

The lights dim low as the cameras show
Not a creature has been stirred.
Dark hallways of isolation,
Where the screams are seldom heard
The years are passing as we hide away their kind
Need to keep them in,
For the rest of time.

Don't let them out,
don't let them free
Be the vigil the world needs us to be

Secure, contain
Don’t let them go
Let no one know

Let it hold, let it hold
Reinforce the walls and door
Let it hold, let it hold
They will see light nevermore

No one knows
What we fight each day
Let the world move on
They’re safer in ignorance anyway

Do you wanna catch a bixby?
Come on we’ll go secure it
We never get out anymore
Breach the containment door
It’s like we have no lives
We once were normal people
and now we’re not
and I think that I know why
Do you wanna catch a bixby?
It doesn’t have to be a bixby…

Go away, agent.

Fine, never mind…

…do you wanna catch a bixby?!
or guard Site-19’s halls
I think some skip-catching is overdue
Now I try staring through the endless blank white walls
(Hang in there, MTF!)
Sometimes it gets unnerving
All these chambered rooms
Just hearing countdowns tick on...
beep-boop, beep-boop, beep-boop.

Doctor?
Please, I know you’re in there
People say we’re here for good
They say “it’s science” and I believe it, too
I’m still waiting on you, just let me in
Our creed is just three words here
Which one means the most?
Secure, contain, or protect…

Do you wanna catch a bixby…?
