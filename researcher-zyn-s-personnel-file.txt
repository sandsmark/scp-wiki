[[collapsible show="2015 Christmas Gift Exchange" hide="hide"]]

In the beginning there was The Forest. And within the forest, life. Great and small, predator and prey, winged and scaled and fanged and furred, the Forest teemed with every possible creature. Some you would know. Some have never been seen on this Earth. Birds with great blue feathers that nested in the dirt, insects with jewels for shells, fish that swam through air and wolves that hunted walking trees. All lived together in harmony.

And then came Man.

Rabbit saw them first. While foraging for roots, she looked up, and saw fire. She fled to warn the others- fire had not been seen in the woods for many generations. And as the denizens of the Forest came to view the flames, they saw the great machines that accompanied them. Behemoths of rusted steel, they belched smoke and tore at the trees. They uprooted wood from the earth and stripped the bark, feeding the remains into furnaces to fuel the grumbling fire.

At first, the denizens of the Forest knew not what to do. They had never seen anything like this before. After many days of observation, they realized that the machines would not leave, that the men would not go, that they would only continue to bore deeper and deeper into the woods. And the animals began to strike back. The leaped at the men and clawed and the machines and tore at the steel. But no amount of fury behind them could best the weapons of man. The animals were driven back, time and time again, until all that remained of the forest was a single grove, and the animals that huddled there.

“We are doomed,” cried Two-mouthed Bear. The other animals agreed.

“The Forest is about to fall,” lamented the Bee King. The others knew this was true.

“I will talk to Man,” came a small voice. The animals were silent. They turned, trying to find who had spoken.

“I will see why they have come to us,” came the voice again. This time, the animals saw the source- Butterfly, floating to the center of the grotto.

“It is impossible,” said Trout. “They will destroy you as soon as you grow near.”

“But they will not see me,” was Butterfly’s response. “I am small and quick. I will sneak past their machines, and speak to those in control.”

“They will not listen to reason,” said Green Deer. “They are mindless, destructive.”

“We cannot know until I try,” said Butterfly. The other animals were silent. They held no hope that Butterfly would succeed. But they also knew they could do nothing to stop her. And so, she left the grotto, and floated towards Man.

She came to their machines, and trembled at the great heat they produced. But she flew high, and passed them un-singed. She came to their camps, and looked at the wasteland the Men had left. She flew past the blackened stumps, and torn earth, and rivers of oil. And she was afraid, for she had seen what Men do to beautiful things.

And passed the wastes, she found a final tent. Three men stood aside, with gleaming weapons. And when she snuck past, she found inside a frail looking man slumped in a chair. A gold band sat atop his thin, grey hair.

Butterfly floated up to him and cleared her throat. “Hello.”

He jolted up. “Who’s there?”

“It’s me, Butterfly. Please sir, are these your Men?”

The man puffed up with pride. “I am King of these people.”

“I see,” said Butterfly. “And why are you trying to destroy the Forest?”

The question seemed to startle the King. “Because it’s in my way, of course.”

Butterfly considered this. “But what about the animals that live here?”

“What about them?”

“You are destroying our homes. You are killing us.”

“They are not my subjects. It is not my concern.”

She fluttered her wings. “You are conquering these lands, are you not? Does that not make them your subjects?”

He stroked his chin. “Perhaps…”

“Have you met any of the other animals?”

“Of course not!”

She smiled in the way that only butterflies can smile. “What is the point of being king if you do not know your subjects?’

He drummed his fingers against the chair. “Very well. Show me.”

And she lead him back to the grotto, where the animals trembled in fear. At first, he refused to get near them, and they him. But Butterfly nudged him forward. She assured his fellows that he would not harm them. And eventually, Cat approached the King. He recoiled, then allowed the animal closer. He knelt down and petted the animals soft fur.

Parrot fluttered up, landing next to the King. He stared at the plumage, eyes wide. It was more beautiful than anything he had ever seen. He listened to the music of the Singing Deer, and rode the powerful Horse, and gazed in wonder at the blinking of Firefly. One by one the animals approached him, and as he took in each, his heart grew softer.

When the final had come, Butterfly again came to him. This time, he looked at her with eyes wide, astonished by the beautiful of her wings. He bowed his head, understand the wonders that he might have destroyed. And the next day, when the animals woke, the Men were gone.

And the Forest began to grow again.

Christmas Alone

Researcher Zyn sat
Contemplating the wooden
Tabletop surface.

Christmas was now here
And here she was at night in
White Foundation garb.

All were at home, or
Else getting ready to go,
And he sat alone.

“Such a horrid way
To spend Christmas evening,”
She thought to herself.

“In an underground
Bunker, surrounded by all
Sorts of nightmare things.”

She should be at home,
With friends and parents this night,
Feasting on his gains.

But she is stuck here.
In a godforsaken Site,
To guard some soup bowl.

Her stomach growls and,
She rises, to procure some
Nourishment tonight.

With the fridge empty
And the cooks gone for the night,
A thought comes to her.

Camera goes down,
Password is entered, and now,
Into the chamber.

It sits there, all pale
And fragile, waiting for a
Person to cheer up.

Hopefully a small
Paper cut will do the trick,
A small clean up job.

Yes; the bowl fills up
And warm, delicious smells waft
Up to her nostrils.

She knows the effects,
But they are minor and not
Worth too much concern.

Sipping up a bit,
Zyn thinks to herself some more:
Why stay here tonight?

As he drinks up, the
Answers become clearer and
Clearer, till the half.

She is alone now, yes.
But she still sees them and knows
They are safe at night.

It is a hard price
Knowledge of such horrid things,
Enough to go white.

Yet, at the same time
Having the power to fight
Even a small part

Means she knows, every
Night, her family will still
Be there in the morn.

Separate now, yes.
But being alone tonight
Is almost worth it.

She swallows the last
And looks inside the bowl.
No message for her.

It would have been nice,
But alas; she must resume
Work or be caught here.

Still, some thinking time
Was nice to have, and she now
Feels much, much better.

Christmas alone sucks,
But if she can keep those close safe,
That’s enough for her.

Meanwhile, in the bowl,
Words form to make the statement:
“You have done so well.”
