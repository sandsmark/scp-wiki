**Article:** SCP-309-J (//the prime example of what not to do//)

**Author:** [[*user plaguebearer]]

**Thanks to:** Nobody, and Everybody.

So, this is getting about 10 more lines of code today.

Anyways, if you're here at this point you're probably here from the top articles, since this has stopped being a meme at this point. I'm just as confused as you, and if you want actual insight, feel free to check out the many comments on this.

I appreciate everything everyone's done to me after this point, especially the folks in SCPD who motivated me to become an actual author instead of a useless one-hit wonder crap. All of you randomly checking back on this to be in awe of the rating, I love you.
