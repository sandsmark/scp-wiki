title:Neutralized
The designation "Neutralized" is assigned to any object that has in someway had it's usual properties removed, normally by destruction, death or removal from our continuum of reference. Although often decommissioned, this isn't always the case and they may still be listed in the Master Record.

Objects classified under this class should have a note stating what class it was while it was an active SCP, as well as an explanation for the reason and method of neutralization. Research into the neutralization of Keter-class SCPs is always a top priority for the Foundation.
