> The first piece produced by M. Petrakovich following his abandonment of the "shock and destroy" tactics of the art collective "Are We Cool Yet?", //Every Day Is Wednesday// is an important and breathtaking viewpoint into the artist's struggles to redefine himself as a member of the ReCreationist school of anart rather than as a Pseudo-Deconstructionist.
> 
> The references to the traditional style of surrealism are most pronounced in the usage of inks composed of blood samples from Picasso, DalÃ­, and Masson, combined with sweat from the artist himself. Petrakovich's use of synaesthetic effects is given full freedom here, with gustatory-tactile and auditory-proprioceptive responses most often reported. Also note the unique use of ocher and crimson in order to provoke the sensation of drunkenness, a cognitive effect Petrakovich used to great effect in later pieces.
> 
> The secondary and more infamous effect has been described by the artist as "fuck copyright", and consists of any indirect representations of the artwork -- including photography, video feed, hand-drawn sketches, clairvoyance, astral projection, and scrying -- being altered to produce a copy of this descriptive plaque, with the majority of the text replaced by the following phrase: "Suck it bitches. You got to see to believe."
