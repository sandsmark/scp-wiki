|| **All Staff Advisory:** This is a report of an operation in progress. Please refer to Memorandum 047-0191 if you have been assigned to this incident or are otherwise associated with [[[SCP-047]]]. ||

**Coordinating Agent's Summary:** On 30/01/2010 at approximately 0300 hours, storage locker 047c (Site-██ lab 047b), containing bacterial samples mutated by [[[SCP-047]]], was compromised. Three (3) samples, of a total twelve (12), were stolen. Once per month since the initial containment break, outbreaks of one of the stolen bacterial strains, //Propionibacterium 047-A//, have been recorded globally. Further information on stolen material, spread, and containment follows.

**Incident Handling Objectives:**
# Re-acquire the stolen samples and ensure that no further copies exist outside of Foundation hands,
# Quarantine all infected civilians and stop the spread of //P-047-A// and any further strains which may be released,
# Determine the motivation behind the attack,
# Maintain Foundation secrecy.

[[/div]]

**//Propionibacterium 047-A//** is a strain of //P. acnes// mutated by [[[SCP-047]]].
* **Pathogenicity:** Severe skin colonisation around sebaceous glands. Modification of skin pH to levels that become toxic to skin cells. Massive inflammation and immune cell infiltration. Eventual breakdown of skin structure leading to sepsis.
* **Transmission:** Transmitted by skin-to-skin contact. Can remain active on inorganic surfaces for up to five hours.
* **Lethality:** Approximately 40% mortality rate. Runs its course in 2-6 weeks. Very visible symptoms within 5-10 hours; contagious within 2-5 hours.
* **Handling:** As soon as visible symptoms form, victims must be quarantined. Deceased victims should be incinerated.

**//Streptococcus 047-C//** is a strain of //S. mitis// mutated by [[[SCP-047]]].
* **Pathogenicity:** Causes inflammation of the mouth and esophagus initially. Leads to open sores in the mouth, which result in //S-047-C// entering the bloodstream and becoming septic. Death is usually due to infective endocarditis.
* **Transmission:** Somewhat aerosol; not transmitted in breath, but occasionally by coughing and spitting. Can remain active indefinitely by sporulation.
* **Lethality:** Approximately 35% mortality rate. May become a recurring chronic condition if nonlethal.
* **Handling:** Subjects with any sign of mouth infection should be quarantined. Deceased victims should be incinerated.

**//Clostridium 047-A//** is a strain of //C. difficile// mutated by [[[SCP-047]]].
* **Pathogenicity:** Unknown. //C-047-A// was developed from tissue culture and has never been exposed to a human. No samples remain in Foundation control.
* **Transmission:** Unknown. Presumably transmitted through fecal contamination, as with //C. difficile//. Due to smaller, more robust spores, may also aerosolise with flatus. Effects of aerosol intake of //C-047-A// cannot be predicted.
* **Lethality:** Unknown. Presumed extremely high risk of destruction of endothelial lining of gastrointestinal tract, leading to inflammation, sepsis, toxic megacolon.
* **Handling:** Until further research has been done, victims should be quarantined and placed under 24 hour medical observation to develop functional diagnostics for this strain.

**Outbreak information:**
^^//Note:// Date listed is calculated date of initial "patient zero" infection on site, ±1 day.^^

> **First Outbreak:** //P-047-A//, 27/02/2010, Siberia. Contained: see Incident Report P047A-03-2010.

> **Second Outbreak:** //P-047-A//, 30/03/2010, Northwest Territories (Canada). Contained: see Incident Report P047A-04-2010

> **Third Outbreak:** //P-047-A//, 29/04/2010, South Australia. Contained: see Incident Report P047A-05-2010

> **Fourth Outbreak:** //P-047-A//, 27/05/2010, Mato Grosso (Brazil). Believed contained: see Incident Report P047A-06-2010. __Warning:__ Agents in the area are advised to familiarise themselves with the symptoms of //P-047-A// and be on the lookout for possible infection.

> **Fifth Outbreak:** //P-047-A//, 26/06/2010, [REDACTED], Iraq. Site immediately [DATA EXPUNGED] which is believed to have contained the infection. Access to Incident Report denied without O5 clearance.

> **Sixth Outbreak:** //P-047-A//, 26/07/2010, Cameroon. Quarantine enacted. Efforts to track outgoing civilians underway. **Infection not contained.** See Incident Report P047A-07-2010

> **Seventh Outbreak:** //P-047-A//, 24/08/2010, Dalarna (Sweden). Quarantine enacted. Believed contained. See Incident Report P047A-08-2010. __Warning:__ Agents in the area are advised to familiarise themselves with the symptoms of //P-047-A// and be on the lookout for possible infection.

> **Eighth Outbreak:** //Not recorded//. Believed to have taken place in North Korea. [DATA EXPUNGED] Agents with government access are attempting to gain access to parallel information, but due to [DATA EXPUNGED] local services have been extremely uncooperative. **Containment status unknown.**

> **Ninth Outbreak:** //P-047-A//, 23/10/2010, South Carolina (United States of America). Quarantine enacted. Efforts to track outgoing civilians primarily successful. One civilian in a pickup truck is believed to have [DATA EXPUNGED] **Infection not contained.**

**Current Orders:** All assigned Agents must immediately contact coordinators inside the World Health Organisation. Agents will be assigned watch locations and required to monitor possible symptoms of //P-047-A//. At this time, outbreaks of the other compromised items are not believed likely due to [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Information Containment:** To date, no infections have been large-scale enough to require full information containment. Various 'cover' diseases have been used to explain the outbreaks. However, as each successive outbreak has been at a larger population center, it may become necessary to [DATA EXPUNGED] In terms of information dissemination, priority 1 is to ensure that the source of //P-047-A// is not made known. Priority 2 is to attempt to conceal the nature of SCP-047-1 based diseases entirely.

**Further Information:** Tracking the compromised materials is a high priority item. Due to the simultaneous [DATA EXPUNGED] of all security measures in lab 047b from 0300-0315 hours on 30/01/2010, no direct information on the method of compromise is available. Assigned Agents will be given authorisation to access [DATA EXPUNGED] for further information.
