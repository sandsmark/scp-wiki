**Item #:** SCP-888

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-888 is currently used at the basis for a library located in ████,  Italy.  The portions of the building constructed of SCP-888 are designated as "rare-book" storage, and are locked away from the general public.  At this time, no special containment procedures are necessary, as this camouflage has sufficed to keep the SCP hidden for nearly fifteen hundred years.  

**Description:** 
SCP-888 is a mineral composite similar to a rare red quartzite found only in ███████, Russia; however SCP-888 also contains trace amounts of an unidentified organic compound.  This stone exhibits the capacity for large-scale data storage within its molecular lattices.  SCP-888 exists in two distinct states, hereafter referred to as 'empty' and 'full'.  In its 'empty' state, SCP-888 is colored a pale pink, and is slightly translucent.  In the 'full' state, the color deepens to a darker red, and the stone becomes completely opaque -- see the attached image.  It is theorized that these changes result from the realignment of the molecular lattices to contain the stored data.  At this time, the source of this stone is undetermined.  

SCP-888 reacts to the presence of sapient beings, and appears to require direct skin contact to function.  If a thinking creature touches an empty sample of SCP-888, the stone removes a memory from the subject, and stores the memory in itself, converting to the 'full' state in the process.  The original memory is lost to the subject.  One of the early test subjects described the experience as "like losing a tooth -- you know there used to be something there but all that's left is a squishy hole."  Testing has confirmed that it is possible to loosely direct what memory is excised, by concentrating on a specific memory before touching the stone. 

If a subject instead touches a 'full' stone, the subject experiences the memory contained within it, firsthand.  Subjects report that the experience is completely 'real' to them during replay.  The memories are so vivid that some test subjects have exhibited psychosomatic responses, such as blisters rising on a hand burned in the memory.  As long as the subject remains in contact with the stone, the memory continuously 'loops,' with each subsequent re-play possessing the same emotional impact, as if every repetition is the first time.

There appears to be no direct correlation between the length of memory stored and the size of the stone.   In fact, if one were to detach a smaller piece of a 'full' stone, the shard retains the full sense-memory contained in the parent stone.  There is a lower limit, however; shards smaller than approximately 8 cubic centimeters lose the ability to retain memories.

The current storage site contained roughly 1 cubic meter of 'empty' stone, which was previously housed in a sealed vault of ordinary granite.  This cache was discovered by Father ████ ████████, who was cataloguing the occupants of the catacombs attached to this site.  Fortunately, his initial contact was with a small chip broken off when the vault was unsealed, and the main mass of stone was therefore left untouched.  Fr. ████████ contacted █████ ██████, the occult research division of ███ ███████, however once it was determined that SCP is not [REDACTED], █████ ██████ contacted the local SCP liason.

Testing consumed approximately one third of this supply before a functional minimum was determined.  As of this writing, several fragments of 3 cm x 3 cm x 3 cm have been separated from the main mass, and are set aside for testing purposes.  Because the amount of stone available is sharply limited, all testing must be approved by the head researcher assigned to SCP-888, Dr. █████, or his superiors.
