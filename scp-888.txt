**Item #:** SCP-888

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-888 is currently used at the basis for a library located in ████,  Italy.  The portions of the building constructed of SCP-888 are designated as "rare-book" storage, and are locked away from the general public.  At this time, no special containment procedures are necessary, as this camouflage has sufficed to keep the SCP hidden for nearly fifteen hundred years.  

**Description:** 
SCP-888 is a mineral composite similar to red quartzite, which exhibits the capacity for large-scale data storage within its molecular lattices.  SCP-888 exists in two distinct states, hereafter referred to as 'empty' and 'full'.  In its 'empty' state, SCP-888 is colored a pale pink, and is slightly translucent.  In the 'full' state, the color deepens to a darker red, and the stone becomes completely opaque -- see the attached image.  It is theorized that these changes result from the realignment of the molecular lattices to contain the stored data.  

SCP-888 reacts to the presence of sapient beings, and appears to require direct skin contact to function.  If a thinking creature touches an empty sample of SCP-888, the stone removes a memory from the subject, and stores the memory in itself, converting to the 'full' state in the process.  The original memory is lost to the subject.  One of the early test subjects described the experience as "like losing a tooth -- you know there used to be something there but all that's left is a squishy hole."  Testing has confirmed that it is possible to loosely direct what memory is excised, by concentrating on a specific memory before touching the stone. 

If a subject instead touches a 'full' stone, the subject experiences the memory contained within it, firsthand.  Subjects report that the experience is completely 'real' to them during replay.  The memories are so vivid that some test subjects have exhibited psychosomatic responses, such as blisters rising on a hand burned in the memory.  As long as the subject remains in contact with the stone, the memory continuously 'loops,' with each subsequent re-play possessing the same emotional impact, as if every repetition is the first time.
