**Item #:** SCP-888

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-888 is currently used at the basis for a library located in ████,  Italy.  The portions of the building constructed of SCP-888 are designated as "rare-book" storage, and are locked away from the general public.  At this time, no special containment procedures are necessary, as this camouflage has sufficed to keep the SCP hidden for nearly fifteen hundred years.  

**Description:** 
SCP-888 is a mineral composite similar to a rare red quartzite found only in ███████, Russia; however SCP-888 also contains trace amounts of an unidentified organic compound.  This stone exhibits the capacity for large-scale data storage within its molecular lattices.  SCP-888 exists in two distinct states, hereafter referred to as 'empty' and 'full'.  In its 'empty' state, SCP-888 is colored a pale pink, and is slightly translucent.  In the 'full' state, the color deepens to a darker red, and the stone becomes completely opaque -- see the attached image.  It is theorized that these changes result from the realignment of the molecular lattices to contain the stored data.  At this time, the source of this stone is undetermined.  

SCP-888 reacts to the presence of sapient beings, and appears to require direct skin contact to function.  If a thinking creature touches an empty sample of SCP-888, the stone removes a memory from the subject, and stores the memory in itself, converting to the 'full' state in the process.  The original memory is lost to the subject.  One of the early test subjects described the experience as "like losing a tooth -- you know there used to be something there but all that's left is a squishy hole."  Testing has confirmed that it is possible to loosely direct what memory is excised, by concentrating on a specific memory before touching the stone. 

If a subject instead touches a 'full' stone, the subject experiences the memory contained within it, firsthand.  Subjects report that the experience is completely 'real' to them during replay.  The memories are so vivid that some test subjects have exhibited psychosomatic responses, such as blisters rising on a hand burned in the memory.  As long as the subject remains in contact with the stone, the memory continuously 'loops,' with each subsequent re-play possessing the same emotional impact, as if every repetition is the first time.

There appears to be no direct correlation between the length of memory stored and the size of the stone.   In fact, if one were to detach a smaller piece of a 'full' stone, the shard retains the full sense-memory contained in the parent stone.  There is a lower limit, however; shards smaller than approximately 8 cubic centimeters lose the ability to retain memories.

The current storage site contained roughly 1 cubic meter of 'empty' stone, which was previously housed in a sealed vault of ordinary granite.  This cache was discovered by Father ████ ████████, who was cataloguing the occupants of the catacombs attached to this site.  Fortunately, his initial contact was with a small chip broken off when the vault was unsealed, and the main mass of stone was therefore left untouched.  Fr. ████████ contacted █████ ██████, the occult research division of ███ ███████, however once it was determined that SCP is not [REDACTED], █████ ██████ contacted the local SCP liason.

Testing consumed approximately one third of this supply before a functional minimum was determined.  As of this writing, several fragments of roughly 18 CCs have been separated from the main mass, and are set aside for testing purposes.  Because the amount of stone available is sharply limited, all testing must be approved by the head researcher assigned to SCP-888, Dr. █████, or his superiors. 

**Test Logs:**
Subject:  D-0210-18
Subject told to pick up a sample of SCP-888.  No warning given of effect.  SCP absorbs subject's memories of learning to drive.  Subject retains the ability to drive, but can no longer recall how that ability was acquired.
Stone contains a driving lesson given by an older male; weather is sunny and warm, and lesson is occurring in a gravel lot.  On playback, subject identifies male as "My Dad," and states that the lesson took place in summer of ████, in a parking lot outside ████████ High School.  

Subject:  D-0210-18
Dr. █████ engaged subject in conversation about subject's childhood.  Subject is then given a sample of SCP-888.  
Stone contains memory of a child's birthday party.  There are nine candles on the cake, and the child is very excited to have received specific toy.  
On playback, subject confirms "that was my best birthday ever."  Subject becomes extremely agitated when stone is set aside.

Subject:  D-0210-18
Dr. █████ asks subject about family, then requests that subject touch a sample of SCP-888.  Subject refuses, becomes aggressive.  Subject removed from project.

Subject:  D-0210-22
Researcher asks subject about first pet, then requests subject handle sample of SCP-888.  
Stone contains a game of fetch with a small black mixed-breed dog.  
Subject confirms details of stored memory, and states the absence "feels like a lost tooth."  Subject appears disturbed and unnerved.

Subject:  D-210-22
Researcher asks about subject's first kiss, then requests subject handle a sample of SCP-888.
Subject initially refuses to cooperate, acquiescing only under threat of punishment.  
Stone contains memory of a childhood accident; subject has fallen out of a tree and suffered a fractured collarbone.  When memory is reviewed by research assistant, subject asks if RA "enjoyed the memory."  Subject refuses to cooperate further, and is removed from project.  

Subject:  Research Assistant ████████
In cleaning the testing area, subject accidentally touches a small fragment of SCP-888.  
Stone absorbs memory of ████████'s most recent sexual activity.  ████████ requests that she be allowed to keep the fragment; request is denied.  ████████ refuses to relinquish the sample, and instead smashes it with a hammer.  Sample is reduced to dust and gravel.  Testing confirms that the shattered stone no longer "plays back" the recorded memory.  Subject claims that the memory did not return when the stone was destroyed.  Subject is reprimanded for disobeying orders, and is reassigned to another project.

Subject:  Dr. █████
Subject concentrated on the plot of the recent movie ██████████ ████████, then handled a sample of SCP-888.  Playback contains the full sensory experience of watching this movie, including the taste of popcorn.  
Sample is crushed with a hammer.  Dr. █████ confirms he retains no recollection of seeing the movie, and confirms that the fragments of stone no longer retain the memory.  
//I remember it's the worst movie I've ever seen, but at least now I can't remember WHY it was so bad. -- Dr. █████//
