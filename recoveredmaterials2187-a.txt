**Overview:** This is an incomplete log of information discovered in SCP-2187-A. Discovered information artifacts are so far of two types: hand-written or typed notes or journals, and narrated videos continuously looping on mounted displays.

++ Mounted Videos
Numerous displays are mounted around SCP-2187-A that loop continuously while powered. Videos recovered feature a narrator speaking directly to the camera in front of a brick backdrop. Narrator is a black-haired Caucasian approximately 40 years old, speaking with a slight Russian accent. Each phrase is spoken in Esperanto, Russian, and English in sequence; for the sake of brevity, only the English phrases have been included.

**Video 2187-01:**
> //Video is mounted near tall cylindrical booths and mass of wires.//

**Video 2187-02:**
> //Video is mounted outside room containing equipment, in hallway towards SCP-2187-A-1.//
> 
> **Narrator:** Where you are is not of any spiritual deception, or tied to any petty nationality; you are here as a member of mankind. Be proud to be a human. This is our crowning achievement.

**Video 2187-03:**
> //Video is mounted near end of passage leading to SCP-2187-A-1.//

**Video 2187-04:**

**Video 2187-05:**
> //Video is mounted above elevator doors.//

++ Researcher Notes

The following are notes found distributed around SCP-2187-A, believed to be written by the creators of SCP-2187. Many more pieces of paper were discovered, but too severely torn or obscured by human waste to be read.

**Note 2187-1:**
> //Found on floor; hand-written on scrap of lined paper.//
> 
> To do
> * --Write my to do list-- whoop dee dooo
> * Ask Brett if the soular accelerator is working. I know it's not. I want him to know that he better get it working.
> * Finish the mass-pulse receiver

**Note 2187-2:**
> //Translated from Russian. Note hand-written on blank paper.//
> 
> Is it Sunday? Are Sunday's a good idea?

**Note 2187-3:**
> //Found pressed to window by corpse. Page is torn from spiral bound graph-paper notebook.//
> 
> --17 Jul 19--
> For how many centuries have we heard the rhetoric of "life's not fair"? As if it justifies a thing. Should I curl up and die, that Adolf Hitler suffered the same fate as the torched jews? I sound like a --goddamn communist--, preach of equality and blasphemy.
> 
> Life's not fair. Like it changes a god damn thing. When has a man, as a species, endured? I say it separates us from the beast. Man does not endure. Man adapts. Not us; we stay. We adapt our surroundings to us. So what cowers us in the face of the greatest injustice of them all?
