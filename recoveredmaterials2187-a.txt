++ Researcher Notes

The following are notes found distributed around SCP-2187-A, believed to be written by the creators of SCP-2187. Many more pieces of paper were discovered, but too severely torn or obscured by human waste to be read.

**Note 2187-1:**
> //Found of floor; hand-written on scrap of lined paper.//
> 
> To do
> * --Write my to do list-- whoop dee dooo

> --17 Jul 19--
> For how many centuries have we heard the rhetoric of "life's not fair"? As if it justifies a thing. Should I curl up and die, that Adolf Hitler suffered the same fate as the torched jews? I sound like a --goddamn communist--, preach of equality and blasphemy.
> 
> Life's not fair. Like it changes a god damn thing. When has a man, as a species, endured? I say it separates us from the beast. Man does not endure. Man adapts. Not us; we stay. We adapt our surroundings to us. So what cowers us in the face of the greatest injustice of them all?
