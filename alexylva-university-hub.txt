= **Overview**
Alexylva University is an institution of learning that is located in a universe the Foundation can't reach. The point of divergence in this universe was around 207 B.C. (Or 207 B.E. in Alexyvla), around the time of the Battle of the Metarus River during the Second Punic War. From what the Foundation can gather, Alexylva exists due to Carthage's victory in the Second Punic War and the subsequent fall of Rome.

-----
= **Phitransimun Combine**
Knowledge of Alexylva University and the version of the planet Earth that houses it comes primarily from parcels of mail that have been deposited in the Baseline via a postal service known as the "Phitransimun Combine", which uses Einstein-Rosen bridges for mail and package delivery; occasional glitches in the system result in packages ending up in the baseline. Technological capabilities in the Alexylva universe are centuries ahead of the baseline. Despite this, there are several more antiquated tendencies; for instance, Roman numerals are still used in place of Arabic numeration, state-approved slavery still exists, and the minuscule case of the Latin Alphabet was never invented.

-----
= **Geography**
The geography, culture, and political state of the Earth that Alexylva University is placed in is largely unknown; the Foundation's been able to make some rough assumptions.

The world as a whole is referred to as Mundus, with the Western Hemisphere being known as Novomundus. At least part of the North American continent is known as "Sylvanos", meaning "Of Forests"; Alexylva University is located in, and named for, Alexandria Sylvanos. 

Two more regions, known as "Aquae" and "Sabulos"— "Of Water" and "Of Sands", respectively— are known to exist. While the location of Aquae is unclear, Sabulos is thought to encompass least part of the Sahara Desert, particularly Egypt, from the presence of a city known as "Novothebus", or "New Thebes".
-----

= **Politics**
With the assumption that the Phoenicians were the victor in the Second Punic War, it can be safely assumed that Carthage still exists, and is a major political and cultural body. However, evidence such as the continued presence of the "SPQR" initialism and the use of Latin further indicates that the Phoenicians allowed Rome to exist in some capacity. Furthermore, it can be assumed that the Iberian Peninsula has some political importance, as Iberia was in the process of being conquered by the Phoenicians during the Second Punic War.

The University is a major institution of philosophy and science, and uses devices that can cause permanent damage to the human body or psyche with little care for the medical, moral or ethical ramifications. The pragmatic attitude appears to be based on the philosophy and ethical views of Aristotle, Plato, Socrates, and other pre-Christian philosophers, as well as the lack of more moderate European philosophers. This has lead to the continued acceptance of slavery, the willingness to experiment on human beings openly, and lax safety standards in comparison to the baseline.
-----
= **Language**
The written language used by Alexylva University in their correspondences is a mixture of Latin and Cherokee, with traces of Nauhatl and Greek syntax, indicating the Native Peoples of America had some form of cooperation with or assimilation into the Sylvanos state.

-----
= **Religion**
A recovered document refers to a "Barca Magnus", presumably either Hannibal, Hasdrubal or Hamilcar, all important figures in the two Punic Wars. The title is used as an epithet, similar in context to "lord only knows why," suggesting some degree of deification of one of the Barcas. However, it is possible that the worship of the Phoenician Deities continues to this day, particularly that of El, the Phoenician chief deity, also called Ba'al, and Tanit, the chief deity of Carthage, whose symbol is used heavily on certain flags.
