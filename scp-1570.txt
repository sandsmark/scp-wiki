**Item #:** SCP-1570

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Procedures into fully containing SCP-1570 are still being researched, although current procedures have been largely successful at preventing public exposure, since the last revision of procedures on August 17th 1972 there have been only fifteen incidents requiring the intervention of MTF Gamma-5 to obscure the presence of SCP-1570 projections.

To facilitate the containment of SCP-1570 members of MTF Iota-0 //"Circle the Squares"// is in constant contact with the city councils of San Francisco CA, Austin TX, Las Vegas NV; local officials in Tijuana Mexico and with the organizers of the Burning Man Festival to influence the regular scheduling of "counterculture" demonstrations within a 3000 kilometer range of Site █.  This is to create scenarios that are the most likely to trigger a manifestation of SCP-1570 in a location where it will go unnoticed or at least unreported by members of the public.

SCP-1570 itself is contained in bio-stasis chamber 2 at Site █.  Every three months personnel must wash SCP-1570 and change its clothing in accordance with current fashion for plus size women aged 30 to 50, including accessories.  Moving and manipulating SCP-1570 requires the use of the electromagnetic panels built into bio-stasis chamber 2, see Manual 1570-c for detailed instructions on their operation.  Personnel must keep SCP-1570 suspended at least two centimeters from the floor of the chamber.
 
**Description:** SCP-1570 appears to be a heavyset Caucasian woman in late middle age, but is entirely immobile and unresponsive to outside stimulus with the exception of electromagnetic fields which may be manipulated to move the object.  It stands in a rigid posture at 1.68 meters but weighs only 45 kilograms.

SCP-1570 is capable of spontaneously projecting images of itself.  The greatest range at which a projection has been discovered was 4231 kilometers on ██/██/████, coinciding with the anomalous events of that day.  These projections are usually static and thus far are always broadcast into densely populated urban areas, although on rare occasions the projections have been mobile (see incident 1570-07 //"Mexican Flying Brujah"// for an example of the behavior of mobile projections).

The projections are not tangible and will disperse upon physical contact.  The projections always display any clothing and items currently in physical contact with SCP-1570, including personnel and the surface upon which SCP-1570 might be standing at a range of 4.62 meters out from itself.  Keeping physical contact to a minimum and magnetically levitating SCP-1570 from the floor of the chamber is critical to preventing the public from paying too much attention to SCP-1570's projections.

**Addendum:** Although preventing SCP-1570 from projecting itself cannot be achieved until its method of projection is discovered, analysis of the behavior of its projections suggest an inclination to observe social interaction in dense populations, particularly during unusual events.  Capitalizing on this behavior led to current containment procedure which both controls the phenomena and makes it less likely to threaten the normalcy of public life.
