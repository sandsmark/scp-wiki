**Item #:** SCP-2000

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2000 is contained at Armed Reliquary Containment Area-02. Standard memetic countermeasures have proven insufficient in the past, therefore SCP-2000 is to be handled utilizing Containment Procedure-2000 "Blind Lead the Blind." See ARC A-02 Clearance-04 Procedures manual for more information. Any individuals affected by SCP-2000 (hereby dubbed SCP-2000-1) are to be handled in the same manner. 

**Description:** SCP-2000 is a set of five hand-held personal data assistants of unknown, possibly extraterrestrial origin. Since acquisition, all but one have become inert and no longer function. SCP-2000 is comprised of a material whose molecular structure matches nothing on the Foundation's expanded periodic table of elements, it is flexible like plastic yet resistance to extreme temperatures and physical damage. Each device is transparent green, with smooth edges, and no apparent power source or input/output ports. SCP-2000 activates when it makes physical contact with an active bioelectronic field, projecting a three-dimensional holographic document. 

The image projected from SCP-2000 is black text on a white background, written in a pictographic language (L-2000). It appears to be based on astronomical, atomic, and molecular compounds, using patterns of dots and joining slashes to create increasingly complex sentence structures. Reading or hearing L-2000 produces a memetic anomaly, making translation efforts extremely dangerous. As such only four percent of the document has been translated (see below).

Early symptoms of L-2000's memetic infection are not immediate, and may progress for days without being recognized. Affected subjects, SCP-2000-1, demonstrate increased anxiety and irritability, obsessive behavior, paranoia and hostility. Instances begin to lose their sense of self, or become convinced they are someone else, insisting that their previous life is a carefully designed falsehood. After a period of six to eight days, the language centers of SCP-2000-1's brain break down, with symptoms similar to agnosia and aphasia. They lose the ability to comprehend or understand any language, written or verbal, save for L-2000. By the end of the second stage they become fluent in both the written and verbal forms of L-2000, and have been observed conversing with other instances of SCP-2000-1. 

After fourteen days, the subject's exhibits a complete shift in mental faculties. Preliminary tests indicate an increase in cognitive function and heightened states of awareness and intelligence. Hostile to non-affected humans, they actively try to escape containment, and work together in an effort to spread the anomaly to others, particularly those that individual SCP-2000-1 instances once felt close to. They also demonstrate an unprecedented amount of technical skill. In at least three separate incidents, using otherwise mundane materials, separate instances of SCP-2000-1 manufactured artifacts that are either anomalous, or so far beyond the Foundation's current scientific knowledge as to appear so. 

|| **Artifact Number** || **Designation** || **Analysis** ||
|| I-001 || EMP Device || SCP-2000-1-07 surreptitiously acquired a silver pocketwatch from Dr. T████ and modified it, using materials removed from a containment cell observation camera and the electronic lock keypad. When exposed to a strong magnetic field (such as that produced by an MRI), I-001 created an electromagnetic pulse. SCP-2000-1-07 attempted to escape in the ensuing confusion, and was fatally injured by security forces. ||
|| I-002 || Energized Ion-Gas Weapon || As part of Experiment T022, SCP-2000-1-15 was provided with a variety of nonspecific materials to test its technical abilities. After forty-five minutes of uninterrupted work, Level 4 Supervisors decided to halt the experiment and confiscated the device. When tested under safe conditions I-002 fired a 1-cm ball of ionized plasma, measured at 10,000 degrees Kelvin. The device developed a fatal heat-build up during testing, destroying its internal mechanisms. ||
|| I-003 || Communications Device || I-003 was constructed by several SCP-2000-1's, building its components separately to avoid notice. The device pirated the intercom and internal data network systems of Area-02, introducing subliminal samples of L-2000 into the facility. Level 4 Supervisor Stephen Sinclair has been posthumously awarded the Foundation Medal of Valor for activating the facility's sarin gas countermeasures, destroying ███ instances of SCP-2000-1 who were attempting to utilize keter-level SCP's contained in Area-02. ||

Currently there is no method of treating SCP-2000-1 once they have entered the second "aphasia" stage of the infection. Use of Class-A amnesiacs in the preliminary infection period (one to three days following exposure) has had only a 60% success rate in removing the infection. The memetic effect is positive in 100% of exposed cases.
