**Item #:** SCP-1925

**Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation agents embedded in the New York Police Department and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey shall monitor both organizations for any reports of discoveries of human cadavers along the Hudson River at the NY–NJ border. Upon confirmation of an SCP-1925-A instance, Class B amnesiacs are to be administered to all direct witnesses and Class C amnesiacs to all indirect witnesses. Instances of SCP-1925-A are to be contained at the Humanoid Research Wing of Site 40. Instances of SCP-1925-B are to be cataloged and transcribed to the database of the same site. 

**Description:** SCP-1925-A is the designation given to a series of human corpses that have manifested along the banks of the Hudson River since the first confirmed sighting on █/██/20██. Although instances of SCP-1925-A vary in age, race, and sex, the following are consistent among all confirmed sightings:

* --No instances measuring less than 160cm in height and 50kg in weight have ever been recovered.-- (No longer true as of █/█/20██)
* No clothing, jewelry, or other personal effects have ever been found on SCP-1925-A instances, with the exception of SCP-1925-B (see below). 
* Bodies have never been found to be emaciated, disfigured, or otherwise in poor condition. Tests by medical doctors indicate that, in most cases, corpses are recently deceased enough that rigor mortis has not yet set in. 
* All instances of SCP-1925-A bear a large insignia stitched onto their backs, consisting of a raised enneagram with the words "FURTIM & ASSOCIATES" printed in the center in cursive.  

SCP-1925-A instances have all been sighted within a two kilometer area along the Hudson River, on the border with Manhattan, New York and Hoboken, New Jersey. Attempts to monitor SCP-1925-A manifestations have been met with failure; through a combinations of errors and oversights, no manifestations of SCP-1925-A have ever been successfully recorded. Attempts to cordon off the area where SCP-1925-A instances manifest have failed to prevent SCP-1925-A from appearing. Foundation researchers have theorized that recording the manifestation of new instances may be impossible; [REDACTED] requiring further study as to their capabilities. 

SCP-1925-B are handwritten notes that have been recovered inside the mouths of each SCP-1925-A instance. To date, all notes have been recovered in standard 3.5x6 inch (8.9cmx15.2cm) office envelopes, sealed with candle wax bearing the aforementioned "FURTIM & ASSOCIATES" insignia. No saliva or water damage has ever been found on SCP-1925-B instances or the envelopes containing them, nor has any writing been present on the exterior of the envelopes.

> SUMMARY:
> 
> Project Letrega is not proceeding as we wished it to. The Katawara Limit has yet to be broken, and all humanoid subjects exposed to Element 130 are yielding the same unfruitful results. I am concerned that our backers may soon be upset by our lack of progress and will thus threaten to cut off our funding. Doctor, take note: time is of the essence on this particular pursuit, and I am counting on you as much as I am myself.
> 
> //Further Recommendations:// Decrease age range of test subjects. Use connections in local governments to bypass laws regarding the training and refitting of minors.

> **Date of Recovery:** █/█/20██
> **Transcription of Note Contents:**
> 
> SUMMARY:
> 
> Experiments have become much more fruitful since our acquisition of more suitable test subjects. Element 130 appears to respond favorably to subjects not yet fully matured; as of this writing, we are within five chens of the Katawara Limit. In addition, we have gained valuable insight into the endurance limits of immature human beings via gradual reduction of atmospheric elements within a controlled environment. Should our current progress continue at a constant rate, we may be nearing the conclusion of Project Letrega.
> 
> //Further Recommendations:// Cease recruiting of test subjects over the age of 20. If necessary, find suitable candidates among the homeless and destitute of the city, with proper discretion.

> SUMMARY:
> 
> Doctor, we are currently in a most difficult state of affairs. We appear to have discovered an aspect of Element 130 previously not known to us; specifically, we believe it causes a state of extradimensional or spacetime transit within subjects. I was working with one of our subjects earlier today, increasing exposure of Element 130 as necessary per our experimental guidelines, when there was a bright flash and she simply vanished before my very eyes! I checked the security feed just to make sure I wasn't seeing things, and it confirmed what I had witnessed. 
> 
> I am uncertain how we started off attempting to [REDACTED] and somehow managed to trigger a spacetime transit state within our subjects, but we might be able to use this to our advantage. As per the outline I have attached to this memo [TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE: No such outline was recovered], I am recommending we shift our priorities and modify the long-term goals of Project Letrega.

> SUMMARY:
> 
> We have been discovered. I do not know how, or who informed the authorities of our experiments, but it does not matter anymore: we are finished. Doctor, I hope you and your men were all trustworthy — not that I'm suggesting they were not, but I certainly know none of **mine** were traitors. A shame...we were only one chen away...
> 
> Regardless, all that matters now is the removal of the evidence of our experiments. Burn all of the lab equipment in the designated furnaces, terminate all non-standard employees, etc. Our research...I have encased it in a sealed briefcase, and will bury it when I have the chance to do so. Perhaps someone, somewhere, will find it and continue our work. I should hope so — these last few years of my life must be worth //something.//
> 
> //Further Recommendations:// Complete Procedure 130-Kennewick with regards to the remaining test subjects. Show no hesitation.

> [TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE: This is, as far as we can tell, the latest SCP-1925-B instance chronologically. All subsequently discovered notes appear to have been written prior to this one. Investigation as to the non-chronological order of recently discovered SCP-1925-B instances is ongoing.]

**Addendum:** On █/█/20██, two instances of SCP-1925-A manifested simultaneously within roughly ten metres of one another. Several phrases had been scrawled on both of their backs, overlapping the "FURTIM & ASSOCIATES" logo:
 
> try to disappear and you slip through time

> stealth is no good when you can loop

> FURTIM

Both appeared to be badly mutilated, in contrast to previous SCP-1925-A instances. Further research as to this reason for this abnormality is required.
