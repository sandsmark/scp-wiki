**Item Number:** SCP-3247

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3247 is to be contained in an isolated chamber in --Site-5--[[footnote]]Personnel are to be reminded that this is an error. [[[SCP-Err0r|Site-5]]] does not exist.[[/footnote]] Area-12's arachnid wing. SCP-3247 has shown no need for sustenance or rest, though as per Ethics Committee request, a television has been installed in SCP-3247's cell along with a selection of silent films.

The feeding system for SCP-3247-A has been fully automated, and should deposit twenty grams of live crickets on a weekly basis. Researchers are to observe standard protocol for the handling of biohazardous macroorganisms while within the chamber.

In the event of a containment breach, personnel are to compel escaped SCP-3247-A instances to take on an immobile form and place them back within their cell.

**Description:** SCP-3247 is a humanoid entity roughly 1.7m in height. The entity wears a striped pullover with suspenders as well as white makeup on its face and exposed skin. Testing has revealed that SCP-3247's clothing and makeup are unable to be removed, and are suspected to be a part of the organism. 

Further testing of SCP-3247's physical properties is hindered by its primary anomalous effect. SCP-3247 is intangible and thus incapable of directly interacting with any matter, with the exception of SCP-3247-A instances.

SCP-3247 is host to a colony of arachnids, designated SCP-3247-A, which live on and within the entity. SCP-3247-A instances are defensive of SCP-3247 and are easily provoked, and they instinctively swarm organisms in SCP-3247's vicinity. If, however, SCP-3247-A witness a human subject pantomiming or making particular gesticulations, the colony will coordinate to order themselves in a rough approximation of an inanimate object based off this body language. SCP-3247-A will remain in this state for up to three hours, or until prompted to shift form.

While they are in the shape of an object, SCP-3247-A take on some of the object's properties and are somehow able to function despite being comprised wholly of spiders.

SCP-3247 has to date not attempted to speak to staff, with its attempts at communication being limited to miming actions. SCP-3247 has not expressed discomfort in hosting SCP-3247-A, though it does display annoyance due to their mimicry prompted by its own gesticulations, presumably because the use of props is antithetical to SCP-3247's preferred method of performance art.

|||||| SCP-3247-A situated themselves in the form of a handgun. After receiving clearance from Control, D-11424 was cleared to pick up SCP-3247-A, and attempt to fire it. It proved capable of firing individual spiders at high-velocity.||

||||||~ Gesture/Procedure:||
|||||| Thumb and index finger pressed together. Remaining fingers extended (OK).||
||||||~ Results:||
|||||| Four dozen SCP-3247-A paired off to form what seemed to be marijuana cigarettes. D-11424 was successful in lighting and smoking one pair until they were reduced to ash. D-11424 reported feelings and sensations consistent with the typical effects of cannabis, with the added effect of perceiving all humans as possessing arachnid heads while within his visual periphery.||

||||||~ Results:||
|||||| An unprecedented number of spiders emerged from SCP-3247 and arranged themselves in the shape of a sedan. D-11424 reprimanded for refusing to get inside in order to attempt to start it. D-11424 responded to Control by making a masturbatory hand gesture, to which SCP-3274-A responded by dismantling themselves and forming approximately two hundred phalluses. Test aborted.||
