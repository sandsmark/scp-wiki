**Item #:** SCP-2000

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** No means of containment or prevention of SCP-2000 is currently available to the Foundation. In lieu of this, several alternative procedures have been established. Gamma-Type individuals and Beta-Type individuals not affiliated with NASA or any other space-related organization should be monitored and detained if necessary. Individuals employed or affiliated with space-related organizations who show signs of Gamma or Beta-Type infection should be removed from service and administered amnesiacs. All individuals afflicted with Alpha-Type symptoms should be detained in Wing ██ of Sector ██. Under no circumstances should Alpha-Type individuals be allowed access to any astronomical or spacefaring equipment. Mandatory SCP-2000 screening is in effect for all Foundation staff.

**Addendum 4/22/19██:** In light of Incident 2000-19██-A, all Foundation employees showing symptoms of SCP-2000 are to be removed from service immediately. See Incident Report 2000-19██-A (Level 4 Clearance or higher).

**Description:** SCP-2000 is an anomalous brainwave that occurs during three of the four stages of human sleep. During one of these three stages, the amygdala spontaneously enters a state of heightened activity for a period of 10-15 minutes.[[footnote]]Awakening the subject during this period appears to immediately switch the response of the individual to Alpha-type regardless of the sleep stage in which SCP-2000 activity occurs.[[/footnote]] The presence of this brainwave in any human subject produces one of three psychological effects.  During this state, the subject is conditioned to one of three responses (designated Alpha, Beta, and Gamma) depending on the sleep stage.  

SCP-2000 appears to show no increased presence in individuals of any race, creed, or gender. No genetic abnormalities have been associated with SCP-2000. Spectrographic analysis of SCP-2000 suggests that its presence may not be intraneural; rather, that it may originate from an outside source. Of particular note is the fact that SCP-2000, particularly the Alpha strain, has recently begun affecting a proportionally large population of astronomers, astronauts, and individuals who otherwise deal with space. 

There appear to be three types of responses to SCP-2000 infection: [[footnote]]SCP-2000 has not been documented to occur in the first stage of NREM sleep.[[/footnote]]

**Gamma:** Subjects who experience SCP-2000 during the second stage of NREM (Non-Rapid Eye Movement) sleep are designated Gamma-type individuals. Gamma-type individuals are almost indistinguishable from the ordinary population save for a disparaging attitude towards the topic of space travel. Gamma-type individuals show an active aversion to discussing space or space exploration in conversations, and will avoid any and all organizations pertaining to the study and development of human space exploration. It is estimated that █% of the population is currently affected by Gamma-type symptoms of SCP-2000.

**Beta:** Subjects who experience SCP-2000 during the third stage of NREM sleep are designated Beta-type individuals. Beta-type individuals are characterized by a distinct opposition to space exploration. Beta-type individuals will denounce the importance and safety of space travel in conversations, citing it as "extremely dangerous" or "fruitless". Also common among Beta-type individuals is the tendency to construct elaborate conspiracy theories regarding humans in space. An estimated ██% of popular space-related conspiracies are directly linked to one or more Beta-type carriers, including [REDACTED]. Of note is the fact that the aforementioned individual had never had contact with the SCP Foundation or any of its affiliates.

**Alpha:** The presence of SCP-2000 during any stage of REM sleep produces an Alpha-type individual. Alpha-type individuals actively attempt to stop or sabotage all forms of space travel. Individuals displaying symptoms of Alpha-type infection will attempt to harm or otherwise interfere with individuals, centers, and activities that pertain to space research or travel. An Alpha-positive Foundation researcher was directly responsible for Incident 2000-19██-A (Level 4 Clearance or higher).

**Date:** 04/22/19██

**Location:** Foundation Outpost-12 within NASA Command, coordinates ██/██/██

//Note: Junior Researcher M███████ was in perfect mental health at the time of the incident. No, he was not insane. No, he was not under any form of psychic control. He was an Alpha-Type carrier of SCP-2000, and that is all. --Dr. █████//

//The following takes place during the launch of the SCPS ███████, a manned Foundation shuttle tasked with investigation of SCP-████. A crew of Foundation supervisors were on hand to ensure safe takeoff and report any anomalous activity. Junior Researcher M███████ was tasked with observation of status readings.//

**12:37:22** Head Researcher S███ reports successful preparation for liftoff of SCPS ███████

**12:37:30** Junior Researcher M███████ reported to become "extremely agitated".

**12:38:00** SCPS ███████ achieves liftoff.

**12:38:31** Junior Researcher M███████ begins yelling unintelligibly to nearby staff.

**12:38:44** Junior Researcher M███████ produces unknown artifact resembling control pad, now classified as SCP-████.

**12:38:48** Junior Researcher M███████ begins to operate unknown artifact. SCPS ███████ reports several system failures.

**12:39:00** Unknown artifact is confiscated by Dr. ███████. SCPS ███████ reports total loss of power.

**12:39:13** Communications with SCPS ███████ cease. Exterior hull of SCPS ███████ begins to break down.

Following the above events and posthumous diagnosis of Junior Researcher M███████ with SCP-2000, containment procedures were altered to provide stricter containment of SCP-2000-Alpha carriers. Full documentation including termination report can be found at [REDACTED]

> **4/21/19██:**
> 
> I, H█████ M███████, wish to state first that my mind and body are perfectly sound. I am prepared to submit myself to any and all tests to prove that I'm clean.
> 
> I have the answer to SCP-2000. 
> 
> Just yesterday, during an interview with an Alpha-infected D-Class, I was asked a question that stopped my mind for a minute. The woman I was interviewing asked me if I knew the Foundation was right. I said no, I wasn't sure. Then she asked me, what if we were right. I could only assume that by "we", she meant 2000 carriers. I said nothing for a while, and then she spoke. She told me of a dream she'd had a while ago. She said that something talked to her, told her about how dangerous outer space was. It showed her the beasts that roam the void between stars, about the fractal beings that absorb the very fabric of reality, about the [DATA EXPUNGED] that we're keeping in that godforsaken door. And she was scared. 
> 
> She told me that at the end of the dream, as she woke up, it told her what it was.
> 
> It's all of space.
> 
> Space fears for us. We're living, breathing lifeforms, and space loves us and cherishes us. She asked me if I had any idea what the chances of intelligent life forming on another planet are, then she told me a number that took a minute and a half to recite. By this point, I couldn't speak. I started thinking: about the demographics of infection, about the symptoms, about [DATA EXPUNGED], and suddenly, it all made //sense//. 
> 
> There's a reason behind SCP-2000, and it's nowhere near as terrifying as all of my colleagues think. Space wants to //protect// us. There are things out there that would wipe humanity clean off of this plane of existence, and we are too precious to our mother, to our host, to the universe we live in, for her to allow that to happen.
> 
> What I am going to do tomorrow is not a result of infection. It is not a result of madness. It is not a result of anything other than purest knowledge. You see, I've found out the truth. And it's more beautiful than I ever could have dreamed.

**Addendum 4/30/19██:** Research into potential memetic qualities of information associated with SCP-2000 is currently ongoing.
