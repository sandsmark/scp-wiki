^^1^^[[span style="font-family: AR BERKLEY;"]]While the world was still young, and Man still [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1206 spoke clearly], and the warmth of creation was still in the ground, there lived a [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1612 soybean] farmer who was called Polyakov.[[/span]]

^^2^^[[span style="font-family: AR BERKLEY;"]]Polyakov was a virtuous man, and listened to the Words of Pangloss. Pangloss rewarded him for this by teaching Polyakov to see the flame of Wonder that was in the Worlds and in the Spirits.[[/span]]

^^3^^[[span style="font-family: AR BERKLEY;"]]Polyakov used the Wonder to create many wondrous miracles and machines, which he shared with the rest of man.[[/span]]

^^4^^[[span style="font-family: AR BERKLEY;"]]Eventually, Polyakov had learned to craft well enough to the dancing flame that was Wonder that he took up a new title, that of Wondermaker.[[/span]]

^^6^^[[span style="font-family: AR BERKLEY;"]]But the thieves that had escaped did not know how to use the wonders, and in their folly and greed, they made and became lost in the Crucible, which was the shadow of Wonder.[[/span]]

^^7^^[[span style="font-family: AR BERKLEY;"]]One of the thieves did not escape, as she had become injured in the Wondermaker's house. Her name was Wan.[[/span]]

^^8^^[[span style="font-family: AR BERKLEY;"]]Polyakov the Wondermaker healed Wan's wounds with what was left of his wondrous machines. He offered her food and allowed her to sleep under his roof.[[/span]]

^^9^^[[span style="font-family: AR BERKLEY;"]]Over time, Wan's Spirit was opened and cleansed. And Polyakov the Wondermaker showed her the wonder in the World, and in Spirits, and in his machines, just as Pangloss had shown him.[[/span]]

^^11^^[[span style="font-family: AR BERKLEY;"]]When Polyakov the Wondermaker had reached a ripe old age, Wan took up a new name, Mekhane, and left to venture out into the world.[[/span]]
[[/size]][[size 150%]]
^^12^^[[span style="font-family: AR BERKLEY;"]]And Mekhane became a great, and powerful, and wise teacher among the worlds, and her teachings found as many disciples as some of those Spirits with greater form.[[/span]]

^^13^^[[span style="font-family: AR BERKLEY;"]] And in this day, and all the days past, there have been some Spirits, especially among Man, who can see and craft the Wonder.[[/span]]
