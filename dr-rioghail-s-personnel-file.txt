title:Dr Rioghail's Personnel File
**Name:** Dr. █████ ██████, assigned the alias of 'Rioghail' according to Protocol Herostratus-4.

**Security Clearance:** --Level 3-- //Rescinded following Dr. 'Rioghail's disappearance.//

**Duties:** --Establishing  containment procedures for Safe and Euclid SCP objects. Reviewing and evaluating containment procedures for objects catalogued at Sector-██ in light of new research data.--  //Rioghail is no longer considered to be in the employ of the Foundation.//

**History:** Dr. 'Rioghail' was employed by the Foundation following a breach of containment at [DATA EXPUNGED], during which he, along with several of his colleagues at ████████ University Physics Laboratory, were exposed inadvertently to SCP-████. Along with a fellow researcher, ████ ████, Rioghail was able to devise a rudimentary method of containing the anomaly, preventing further damage and loss of life. In light of Rioghail's proven ability to successfully contain an anomalous with minimal information and use of lateral thinking, Rioghail was inducted as a member of the Foundation.

On ██/██/████, Dr. 'Rioghail' disappeared from Foundation surveillance. At present, he has not been located. Documentation found at his home indicate that prior to his disappearance Rioghail suffered a psychotic break. It is postulated, although at this time unproven, that this was the result of unintended cross-contamination of SCP-███ and SCP-████, stemming from a flaw in the containment procedures Dr. Rioghail had created for SCP-████. Dr. Rioghail appears to have believed, as a result of his psychosis, that he was the person responsible for the creation of several SCP Object whose files he had largely authored, and was submitting them to an unknown audience for evaluation. Documents recovered from Rioghail's home demonstrating his irrational beliefs have been attached to this file.

**SCP items catalogued by Dr. Rioghail prior to his disappearance:**
[[[SCP-1109]]] - The Painkiller
[[[SCP-1153]]] - Programmable Patients
[[[SCP-1135]]] - Living Village
[[[SCP-1077]]] - The Devil's Cap Mushroom
[[[SCP-1209]]] - Many Eyes in Many Places
[[[SCP-1409]]] - The Whalesong Beacon
[[[SCP-1509]]] - Blade of Rebirth
[[[SCP-1609]]] - The Remains of a Chair
[[[SCP-1615]]] - Photosynthetic Manna

My first SCP. Accidentally sandboxed this incorrectly, and made a sandbox just for this article. I then posted it up in the forum discussion, and after getting a decidedly lacklustre response it took me nearly a week to put it up. I was rather apprehensive with this one, and fully expected it to be shot down within 24 hours of posting. 

What I realise now, but didn't then, was that the article really does lack an effective hook, however since the article is in the low forties at this point I'm not going to argue. I think this one might have a score that is slightly higher than is representative of its quality- as I recall I made it in the middle of a bunch of terrible articles, and I think some people were just happy to see a first SCP that wasn't terrible.

This is my favourite article thus far, even though it isn't the highest-rated. The reason I was so pleased with this was that I got a real sense that everything in the article was my own work. I can't identify any real source of inspiration for this one, and I'd never heard of a similar idea being done, so I got a real sense of accomplishment from the feeling that what I'd come up with in this article was original. I now realise this wasn't entirely a new idea, but I'm still very pleased with how it turned out. I find that articles which spring into your head fully-formed and only take a few tweaks in the final stages to fine-tune are the most satisfying.

Security program: Prodigal Son (Manna Charitable Foundation information is under Harvest Home if anyone ever writes another article using them).

I've received an unusual amount of praise for this piece among people who have read it but don't have accounts here, both in real life and on other websites. Some people just like the idea of benevolent SCPs without visible drawbacks, it seems.

This came about very suddenly, while I was technically supposed to be doing other things, and I write it up in a hurry to get it out of the way. I chose to locate it in India because I rarely see SCPs from less economically developed countries around here, and I wanted to set something there. I didn't even realise at the time that 'thing what looks like a normal object but is actually ALIVE' was close to being a cliche.

SCP-1077 is easily the worst of the articles that I've written, and it's fortunate that it got enough upvotes to stave off deletion while I fixed the myriad errors wrong with this. It serves as a cautionary tale against writing up half a file, then changing your idea to something totally different. When I posted it up, it was a mess of mistakes, run-ons, half-finished sentences and missing blackboxes. I'm eternally grateful to Adam Smascher for pointing out the large number of problems with this so I could fix them.

Initially, this article started out as mushrooms that made you say stuff likely to get you killed. However, as I wrote it I changed it into its current form (a closer approximation to the original idea can be found under the voided containment procedures. I tried to tell a story, rather than describe an object, with this one. However, I screwed it up to an extent, and it didn't do as well as I'd hope. However, the lessons I learned here came in handy for writing up SCP-1609 later on.

My first attempt at using an unusual picture for an article, SCP-1209 was a pretty simple idea that I didn't drop the ball on like my previous one, but I can't say that it was anything special. Inspired heavily by a recent X-Files binge I'd been on, and of course by the fantastic picture in one of the SCP-fuel articles. Once again, thanks to Gears on that for the picture, which really carried the article off.

Security program: September Morning (overall classification for mind-affecting recordings). Stuff related to the whale is under Massachusetts (singular uncontained marine lifeforms). 

Inspired (as someone successfully guessed) by a failed SCP somebody else put up, which was some sort of disease transmitted between shoes that made people march into the sea. The concept struck a chord with me when I read it initially, but given its rating I decided to overhaul the whole idea and retool it. I cut out the parts that didn't really matter and elaborated on the interesting bits (like the destination of the compulsion) and through in a psychic whale for good measure because I really liked the idea of a psychic whale.

Security program: Jellyfish. Run A Mile for GOC-related information.

Currently my most popular article (although given the heights other peoples' articles have reached, this isn't that exciting). This started its life as a Tale, actually. It was called 'Evidence Collected for Inquest of May 16th', and was an in-universe attack on the Log Of Anomalous Objects and its habit of destroying SCPs, which doesn't gel at all my my headcanon. However, as I wrote, I began to feel that the story would work better as a mainlist SCP, but that referencing the Log too overtly might not be a good idea. I changed the people responsible for the chair's state from Foundation officials to GOC operatives, which at the same time made containment much easier.

Also, I love this one, because it gave me the opportunity to write the words "...all visitors to the enclosure must remark on the beauty of the flowerbed, with particular emphasis on the quality of the mulch" in the containment procedures.

My first outing into the realms of visceral horror. The idea initially came to me after reading China Mieville's book //Kraken//, in which a hitman gets into an envelope with magical assistance, mails himself to a target, and clambers out of the envelope to kill them. From there, it was a simple step of turn the envelope into a gaping wound.

Of course, the entire idea got completely reworked when I decided to turn it into the world's messiest resurrection ritual. I decided that the wound would lead to the realm of the dead, hence the addition of all the references to funerary figurines in the original version, thereby adding a bunch of death/rebirth imagery to the article.

The association between ants and death is not mythological, or my own invention. It's a reference to Dali, of all things- I'd recently seen //The Metamorphosis Of Narcissus// and loved the idea of ants being connected to death (also, Dali associated them with female genitalia, so that also fit with the 'warped rebirth' aspect of the item). Probably the most time I spent on this was searching for the right species of ant, and the Pharaoh Ant was the first Indonesian ant that I found. On the plus side, the origins of the Pharaoh Ant are unknown (believed to be from Indonesia), so I've now made it my headcanon that SCP-1509 is far older than expected, and is the original source of the Pharaoh Ant, which would not otherwise exist in nature. Yes it's silly, but I like the idea.

//"When the Israelites saw it, they said to each other, "What is it?" For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, "It is the bread the LORD has given you to eat."// - Exodus 16:15

The verse which inspired the name for the Manna Charitable Foundation, and also the number for this article. Apparently a bunch of people liked the Manna Charitable Foundation following their debut in SCP-1135. 

One of these people wrote an article (1139), which was essentially famine relief that caused anomalous weight gain. So far so good, until you reached the realisation that the article seemed to be pandering to fat fetishes, and it got deleted. The author gave me permission to re-write, and with VAElynx's help I re-wrote it into this. 

The article is also indebted in part to Smapti and his [[[SCP-1176]]]. I liked the idea that the MCF had made a massive, terrible mistake in their history, and I used that to colour the MCF's depiction in this article, showing them to be a competent organisation trying to shake off the spectre of their mistakes.
