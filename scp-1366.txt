**Item #:** SCP-1366

**Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1366-A is contained behind a 3m tall chain link fence, to be checked for breaks at least once weekly. --4 guards are to patrol the perimeter at all times.-- Motion-detecting cameras have been set up around the perimeter to detect breaches; Foundation agents should be prepared to respond to SCP-1366-C events taking place within 120 seconds. Individuals breaching or attempting to breach the perimeter are to be questioned and administered Class-A Amnesiacs before being returned to civilian populace.

--Site-403 is to be evacuated at the earliest possible time, and all civilians administered amnesiacs and relocated.--[[footnote]] See Addendum regarding Event SCP-1366-C-40.[[/footnote]] The only road leading into Site-403 is guarded by a checkpoint in order to assure no individuals affected by SCP-1366-C events attempt to escape. A 3-km perimeter has been set up in the woods surrounding Site-403 with olfactory, auditory, and visual deterrents throughout, with a quarantine perimeter at 1km; citizens have been informed that this is due to the town's status as a State Park. Inhabitants of Site-403 are unaware of their circumstances, but co-operative to Foundation agents, believing them to be members of the ██████ State Park Rangers. All satellite photographs of Site-403 are to be altered to show bare woodland.

**Site-403:** Site-403 is the town of Town of Siskin, ██████, USA, located in the northwestern region of █████ County. The 2010 census conducted by the Foundation shows that Site-403 has a civilian population of roughly 6000, with 400 extended families. The majority of the populace are farm or lumber workers, or work at local businesses. The total area of the town encompasses approximately 9.5km^^2^^, and is secluded in a heavily wooded area.

The mayor of the town, the city council, and local law enforcement are to be briefed about the circumstances surrounding the containment of SCP-1366 and recruited as operatives with the clearance level E1/1366; however, they are not to have any knowledge of the Foundation beyond SCP-1366. Site-403 is to be maintained with a cover story regarding the town's status as a historic State Park.

**Description:** SCP-1366-A is an abandoned sawmill located on the [REDACTED] river near Site-403. Originally built by the Siskin Logging Company in the 1820s, it was abandoned after a series of accidents, eventually resulting in the death of the owner, Wilhelm Siskin. Though abandoned for well over one-hundred and fifty years, SCP-1366-A is remarkably stable, despite the exterior appearing to be on the verge of collapse. 

When unobserved, the head saw of SCP-1366-A will activate sporadically. Following activation, a single canted log of unknown origin is dispensed onto the log chute and deposited outside of the mill. The log, designated SCP-1366-B-1, is invariably carved on its interior with a piece of writing, typically 2-8 words in length. The writing will present itself in the form of a sensationalist headline of dubious credibility, which --will-- may later be published as a news story, designated SCP-1366-B-2. Failure of the paper to publish a story regarding SCP-1366-B-1 will cause SCP-1366-C events to not occur, or occur at a later date. Publication of stories occur regardless of whether or not SCP-1366-B-1 has been observed by a member of the civilian populace, or even if SCP-1366-B-1 is intact.

A SCP-1366-C event occurs approximately 68% of the time following the publication of SCP-1366-B-2. SCP-1366-C events cause major psychological changes in the populace, including xenophobic behavior, psychotic episodes, paranoia, increased promiscuity, bouts of amnesia, and failure to notice or acknowledge the disappearance of inhabitants of Site-403. 


All SCP-1366-C events all follow a distinct timeline:

* **Publication:** The writing presented on SCP-1366-B-1 is published as SCP-1366-B-2, with an accompanying news story. Sources of the article are never cited, and fictional cities in several states and countries are often named. Stories typically are about incidents such as mass media influencing violent or deviant events, use of fictional drugs among teenagers, satanic cults, and serial killers. All SCP-1366-B-2 will be treated as completely factual by the populace, however.

* **Spread:** Residents of Site-403 discuss SCP-1366-B-2 in public and among their families. At this point, the majority of the populace believes that the SCP-1366-B-2 is of little concern; about 5% of the population show mild interest or concern.

* **Saturation:** Once approximately 85% of the population is aware of the SCP-1366-B-2, typically around 1-12 individuals knowledgeable of the SCP-1366-B-2 start deviating from their normal behavior; individuals will become more reclusive and psychotic in behavior, small groups will develop interest in activities or items such as listening to certain genres of music or playing table top games, and larger groups will start to experiment with recreational drug use.

* **Build-up:** It is at this point that random acts of violence begin to occur. Slightly more mundane behavior includes greater frequency in parties and drug use among teenagers and young adults. Individuals will attempt to breach the perimeter surrounding SCP-1366-A and use it as a secret meeting place or hideout. Subduing the instigators of this behavior at this point will result in the termination of the current event, leading straight to the dissipation phase.

* **Climax:** To date, there have only been ██ recorded SCP-1366-C events that have reached the climax stage. Events reaching this stage usually result in a mass murder, mass suicides, and orgies, usually centered around or taking place within SCP-1366-A.

* **Dissipation:**  Approximately 36 hours after the climax phase (if one has occurred), all anomalous activity abruptly ceases; surviving residents involved in the event return to their homes and soon forget about their experiences, saying that "the past few days were all a blur". Individuals who were terminated in the event will be routinely be given a funeral within a week of their death. The town is effectively reset until the next SCP-1366-C event.



**Addendum: Partial SCP-1366-C Event Log:**

|| **Event Designation**|| **SCP-1366-B-1 Message** || **Summary of Story** ||  **Description of Event** || **Aftermath** || **Notes** || 
|| SCP-1366-C-01 || ELECTRICIAN STILL ON THE LOOSE IN RENARD || Story describes a serial killer known as the Electrician, notable for killing all of his or her victims by electrocuting them, typically by connecting the genitals of the victim to car batteries or electrical wires. || Robert Kramer, a utility worker, suffered a psychotic breakdown while at work and assaulted a co-worker with a live wire before fleeing. Mr. Kramer was not found for over a month, during which several murders took place in the town mirroring murders described by SCP-1366-B-2. Local authorities eventually tracked Mr. Kramer to SCP-1366-A, where he had made a hideout supplied with various electrical equipment.|| Mr. Kramer was subdued and taken in for questioning, during which he reported that he had no knowledge of committing his crimes, despite the overwhelming evidence. || First known 1366-γ incident; town records show that several similar incidents have occurred in earlier years, but have largely been more mundane before this time. The Foundation began investigating after finding reports of SCP-1366-B-2 and the incident being similar. Containment established within three months of this incident.||
|| SCP-1366-C-03|| VIDEO GAMES LEAD TO ORGY OF BLOOD AND VIOLENCE|| Unknown; newspaper failed to publish this story. || No anomalous activity || No cleanup necessary. || N/A||
||SCP-1366-C-05 || BOUDICCA: THE NEW KILLER DRUG || Article describes a drug known as Boudicca, apparently made from fermenting dandelions, ragweed, crabgrass, and various other weeds and and drinking the resultant substance. Apparently, the mixture is hallucinogenic, aphrodisiac, and often fatal. || A group of 5 teenagers attempted to replicate the drug from a home-made recipe, meeting at 1366-A to partake in the drug and have sexual encounters while under its influence. || All individuals were arrested for trespassing; the drug, when tested on D-Class subjects, was found to be a minor stomach irritant with no other effects.|| This incident took place prior to the construction of the fence around SCP-1366A; therefore, the group was easily able to enter the structure. || 
|| SCP-1366-C-14 || 666 BRIDES CULT COMMITS MASS SUICIDE || Story describes an all-woman cult known as the Six-Hundred and Sixty Six Brides of Mephistopheles. The cult was dedicated to "ridding the world of men through use of Demonic powers". A large sect of the cult had walked into an abandoned warehouse, stripped naked, had a lesbian orgy, and then drank poisoned wine. || No less than ███ women inhabiting Site-403, including the wife of the local pastor and the then-mayor of the town, formed a cult with similar intent, conducting weekly rituals near or within SCP-1366-A for 13 weeks until mass suicide was attempted.||Embedded Foundation agent ensured no casualties, due to the poison in the wine being replaced with a sleeping agent. Class-A amnesiacs administered to the "cult members", who were subsequently released back into the populace. || Guards were placed around SCP-1366-A following this incident. || 
|| SCP-1366-C-17 || IS GAMING KILLING KIDS? || Story claims that the role playing game [REDACTED] has been responsible for several group murders and suicides. || A group of 8 teenagers started a Role Playing Club at the local high school, and due to inability to access SCP-1366-A, played their game in the basement of the high school instead, casting "spells" at each other and on their parents and peers.|| Unfortunately, Foundation operatives were not aware that the meetings of the club took place due to the isolation from SCP-1366-A, and simply assumed that a 1366-γ event was not occurring. As a result, 5 of the 8 teenagers successfully committed suicide through various means, with the survivors being critically injured. || Guards were removed from the perimeter of SCP-1366-A, with motion-sensing cameras put up in their place.|| 
|| SCP-1366-C-29 || SNUFF FILMMAKER ARRESTED || A prominent Hollywood filmmaker named Alan Smithee had been arrested for attempting to murder his lead actor on camera, "for the art".|| A pair of amateur filmmakers, Jacob Rebus and Mary-Beth Jones started filming acts of zoosadism and animal murder, eventually escalating to the pair infiltrating SCP-1366-A, placing Ms. Jones on the conveyer of the sawmill and attempting to activate the saw mill to kill her. || Foundation operatives moved in and subdued the pair. Following detention, the pair claimed ignorance for their actions and were released following questioning. || N/A || 
|| SCP-1366-C-36 || MAD GASSER STRIKES AGAIN! || Describes a "Mad Gasser" in an undisclosed city, attacking government offices by pumping anesthetic gas through the ventilation system. || The mayor and sheriff's offices, as well as the Foundation field office in the area, were flooded with Nitrous Oxide following the doors and windows being sealed by an unknown person or persons, resulting in 6 deaths due to suffocation. || No perpetrator has been identified as of this time, and citizens have been advised to report odd smells and hissing noises.|| First direct attack on a Foundation facility. || 
||SCP-1366-C-40||MAD COW INFECTS HAMBURGER PATTIES|| Describes how a national beef distributor had been selling meat infected with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), which had resulted in the deaths of Several people.||  On ██/█/██, O5-█ issued an evacuation order of Site-403, hypothesizing that if the site could be evacuated, anomalous activity would cease. Two days before evacuation, SCP-1366-A dispensed an instance of SCP-1366-B-1. Following the publication of this in SCP-1366-B-2, an SCP-1366-C even took place, resulting in an apparent outbreak of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, apparently caught from burgers at a local fast food restaurant, despite the fact that it is impossible to catch BSE-like diseases from hamburger meat.|| Due to the size of the outbreak (approximately 500 citizens), the evacuation order was cancelled, and shortly after, a full recovery was made by the infected population.||4 further evacuations have been attempted since this time, with similar results. Currently, no further evacuations have been planned. ||
