[!-- I realize I’m not very good at this, but at least I’m trying to improve it. The idea behind this SCP is a phone box that seems harmless and can call anyone, at any point in time. Hidden inside of it is a twisted ulterior motive that even I don’t understand yet. --] 


**Item #:** SCP-400-ARC

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-400-ARC is contained in a standard 10m x 10m room made of white-paneled concrete. Containment area is lit by 4 110-watt halogen lights, which must be replaced immediately when they fail. One guard on a 12-hour rotation is placed outside the door, which has an electronic keypad lock on it. The door is made of standard steel with generic poly(methyl methacrylate) windows. Room is monitored by four CCTV cameras, one in each corner of the ceiling.

**Description:** SCP-400-ARC appears to be a K6-model red telephone box. Discovered in 19██ in ██████, ███████, it was brought to the attention of the Foundation by an embedded operative. It was immediately extracted and taken to Containment Area 25 for study. When tested, it was shown to exhibit negligible levels of x-ray, gamma, and --an unknown form of radiation—both tachyons and bradyons, according to spectrographic results from the handset, but only while in use. After several months of study, it was deemed Safe.

SCP-400-ARC functions just like any other K6-model red telephone box, with the exception that, if the Operator is dialed, the user only has to speak the name of the person they are trying to reach and they will be connected to them without fail. This effect seems to work even when the subject does not have a telephone nearby. Any abnormalities are to be reported to Dr. Vague.

**Addendum 1:** Under absolutely no circumstances are any staff to use SCP-400-ARC as a toy. Making prank calls with this SCP is unacceptable. Attempts to call any kind of mythological figure, deity, or otherwise will result in immediate termination, if said call does not immediately terminate the caller. - Dr. T. Vague

**Addendum 2:** Due to several mishaps, use of SCP-400-ARC to contact the dead now requires the supervision of at least two individuals with level 3 clearance. Any personnel exhibiting erratic behavior at these times are to be submitted for psychiatric evaluation, regardless of clearance.

**Addendum 3:** Under absolutely no circumstances are any staff to answer the phone if it rings. If the phone rings at any time, inform Dr. Vague immediately. If Dr. Vague is unavailable, notify High Command on site and lock down containment area. Any staff, regardless of clearance, attempting to answer SCP-400-ARC without proper expressed authorization are to be immediately terminated. Those with level 3 clearance please see Document #400-1 for details. In the wake of the Containment Area 23 incident, SCP-400-ARC is now stored at Research Sector ██ for further testing.

**Initial Reconnaissance**
The Initial Response Team secured the outer perimeter and the path leading to the facility without difficulty. No visible outward signs of breach detected. No civilians near containment facility.  Perimeter guards found to be alert and responsive, provided proper protocols and were remanded into custody for debriefing without issue. Initial investigation determined that outer bulkhead not breached before all staff were terminated. This was later confirmed by the post-recovery investigation. Once outer facility was secured, the Recovery Team arrived to retake the facility. –Capt. █████, IRT A-6

**Recovery Operation**
[REDACTED] Facility reclaimed and deemed safe.

**After-Action Report**
It is presumed that whatever caused the unknown security breach caused several breaches elsewhere in the facility remotely via unknown means. These breaches caused the interaction of SCP-████ and [REDACTED], causing [REDACTED] to aerosolize and rapidly infect all individuals on site. Facility locked down 2 minutes after report of initial containment breach received. Life support systems suspended. Level 3 anti-biological gas vented into air filtration systems caused termination of all on-site staff and two non-critical biological SCPs. 

SCP-400-ARC was recovered undamaged and moved to Research Sector ██ on the orders of O5. Dr. Vague’s protests have been noted.
