**Item #:** SCP-2297

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2297 is to be magnetically suspended in a Safe-Class storage locker that is not parallel or perpendicular to the floor in which the storage locker is kept. This storage locker must be assessed for damages once every 24 hours. If the Safe-Class storage locker has been rendered inoperable and/or unsuited for the containment of SCP-2297 an on-site supervisor must be alerted immediately.

**Description:** SCP-2297 has the appearance of a BOSCH RTH6450D1009 5-1-1-Day Programmable Thermostat. Of note is SCP-2297’s unique internal composition. Inside the casing of SCP-2297 rests a fleshy interior comprised of various organs whose functions remain mostly unknown, though visual comparisons liken them to lungs and kidneys much like those found in humans. The flesh itself is highly resistant to any attempt at mechanically sampling it, thus the use of projectional radiology has been necessitated. These tests were able to reveal a system comprised of valves and flaps responsible for the intake and output of oxygen. A project to use more invasive forms of sampling is currently awaiting approval.

SCP-2297 functions as a normal thermostat when not placed on a flat surface. When mounted or placed on a flat surface SCP-2297 will display one of a variety of messages that pertain to the anomalous conditions that will be exhibited within the room which SCP-2297 is contained. SCP-2297 does not require any electrical signal to display these messages. Depending on the content of the displayed message, the environment and temperature of the room SCP-2297 occupies is altered drastically. Those located within the same room as SCP-2297 will not notice the effects of change in temperature and environment, and do not believe themselves to be in any danger. These effects dissipate after four minutes instantaneously. The messages documented thus far and their corresponding effects can be found in Addendum-2297-1.

SCP-2297 was recovered at ██████████ after the ██████ Conference, an event notable for being a gathering of minds dedicated to the preservation of the environment. Having been embedded within the local police force, Agent ██████ notified the Foundation of the presence of anomalous activity after being dispatched to the scene of the incident. All ███ attendees of the ██████ Conference were found dead in conference room 417. The cause of deaths initially labeled as respiratory failure from smoke inhalation and/or self-immolation, but later determined to be immolation by SCP-2297. Although SCP-2297 appears to have some notable cognitive abilities based on conducted research, it does not seem to have any predictable order or reason in which it carries out its several anomalous abilities at this time. 

SCP-2297 appears to self-define a "room" as any area that is enclosed by walls, a floor, a ceiling, and a distinct structural element dividing the room from the rest of the structure. These "divisions" can range from doorways to a change in elevation such as a flight of stairs or a ladder. Repeated testing on a singular room setup yielded many different results and led to the conclusion that SCP-2297 determines for itself what is a room and what is not. SCP-2297 also seems to be able to recognize if it has been placed in an outdoor area and will refuse to activate when placed outside, though testing in this area is slow due to the many precautions necessary for such an experiment.

>  **Message:** FIRE IS NORMAL
> **Effect:** The average temperature of the room increased from 73 degrees Fahrenheit to 2035 degrees Fahrenheit over a period of 4 minutes.
> **Results:** The singular D-Class subject indicated no signs of discomfort or pain as his body was burning. He did not display any symptoms of respiratory insufficiency or succumb to respiratory failure before expiring from fire-related injuries despite the room having purposefully inadequate ventilation. A test was conducted with three Class-D personnel, having similar results. The three D-Class reported nothing out of the ordinary until their expiration.

> **Message:** FREEZING IS NORMAL
> **Effect:** The average temperature of the room decreased from 73 degrees Fahrenheit to -320 degrees Fahrenheit over a period of 4 minutes.
> **Results:** A singular D-Class subject reported no changes in movement capabilities, temperature, or comfort for the entire duration of the test before expiring. Four Class-D personnel responded similarly, the only difference of note being that the D-Class huddled together for warmth in what would be the final stages of profound hypothermia, despite all D-Class claiming otherwise.

> **Message:** EVERYTHING IS NORMAL
> **Effect:** The average temperature of the room increased from 73 degrees Fahrenheit to 96 degrees Fahrenheit over a period of 4 minutes.
> **Results:** Testing was inconclusive. Repeated testing has resulted in subjects who claim to be either melting, freezing, or simply dying. A test conducted with several D-Class in the same room results in each subject reporting a different temperature and condition. Despite their claims the D-Class were never observed to be suffering from any of the described conditions and were fine once removed from the testing room.

> **Message:** STARVATION IS NORMAL
> **Effect:** The average air pressure of the room decreased from 100 kPa to 20 kPa over a period of 4 minutes. Air inside the room condenses, producing a fine mist inside the test chamber.
> **Results:** Researchers noted increased heart rates and lower blood circulation in the D-Class subjects; a post-test autopsy on one subject revealed a severe accumulation of fluids in the lungs. Despite this, all D-Class continued to report that they "feel fine" during testing and none succumbed to the effects of the lowered air pressure until after leaving the testing room.

> **Message:** WET IS NORMAL
> **Effect:** The specific humidity of the room increased from an average of ~44% to a specific humidity of 214% over a period of 4 minutes.
> **Results:** All D-Class tested were observed to have difficulty breathing, with two of the D-Class hyperventilating mid-test. Despite the observed hyperventilation, both D-Class were able to interact and communicate with other D-Class in the test chamber. When researchers requested a response from the affected D-Class they either refused to communicate or were incapable of doing so.


> **Message:** █████████ IS NORMAL
> **Effect:** The environment of the room changed from a controlled temperature of 73 degrees Fahrenheit, consistent air pressure and humidity to one of █████████████████, with averages of ████ and ██. Of note were the ████████████ markings that appeared on the walls as well as the coating of ████████████ that formed on the walls of the test chamber.
> **Results:** [EXPUNGED], with all D-Class quoting numerous related texts found in the Voynich Manuscript. After a period of 4 minutes of continued ███████████, all D-Class underwent ██████ of a Type-██ class. █████████, █████, and Dr. ██████ all suffered similar effects. All Class-D personnel involved are to be considered lost. Research into what caused these results, and if they can be replicated for further study, is ongoing.

> **Location:** ████████, Germany
> **Time:** 06:12 CET
> **Date:** 02/██/20██
> **Operatives:** MTF-Psi-7 ("Home Improvement")

> *Log has been cut to exclude irrelevant dialog*
> **CMD:** .... and honestly that's not even taking into account how many there were.
> **A24:** Right. Well, without it what could have happened?
> **A61:** ██████████, but at least we could've learned something.
> **CMD:**  Alright, pull your heads out of your collective asses. This should be easy enough, HQ just wants you guys to go in, take a look around, and then get out. We're just looking to ID a cause or source here, not contain it. We'll come back for that later.
> **A37:** And what if we see the thing in here? The thing that did it. What do we -
> **A24:** We shoot it. I'm not dying just because some fucking hippies burned themselves to death. It probably isn't even anomalous, HQ's just over-reacting.
> **CMD:** Look, just do what you're there for A24, then you can get out. You should be approaching the building, by the way. It's pretty tall, has ███████ on one side and a bunch of ███████ surrounding it?
> **A61:** Yep, we're on it. Enter through the right doors, correct?
> **CMD:** Correct, and you'll be looking for something on the fourth floor, most likely around room 417. East wing.
> **A61:** Roger.
> *Several minutes of unrelated travel and investigation has been removed for brevity*
> **A24:** Fuck. Look at that, just piles of ash.
> **A37:** Command, reporting no signs of fire damage on the surrounding structures or walls. Has anyone been inside the room yet?
> **CMD:** Negative A37, just the drones. As soon as it was called in we got everything locked down tighter than Site-██.
> **A61:** So we'll be the first ones in. Alright Command, we're entering with caution. Sit tight.
> **CMD:** Roger, we've got your vitals right here. We'll let you know if anything changes. HQ wants you to take pictures of the corpses, too. 
> **A24:** Well tell HQ there ain't nothing to take a picture of. It's just piles of dust.
> **CMD:** Alright, then can you get a sample of the material? Bring it back with you on your way out.
> **A24:** Can do. How does something like this happen? You think the poor fuckers would know that they're being burned alive.
> **A37:** Maybe it was over too fast. All instantaneous like. One moment they're there talking about how to save the trees down in Africa and the next - poof.
> **CMD:** Hey, A61, we're getting some strange readings over here. Can you confirm your suit's internal temp for us?
> **A61:** Sure. Let's see... Internal temp is fluctuating between 115 and 130. But that can't be right...
> **CMD:** Temperatures rising on all suits... ███████ is on the line with HQ currently trying to get the greenlight to continue. Until then we're going to ask you and your team to step out. Shouldn't be too long, it's most likely a malfunction.
> **A61:** Roger, Come on guys... HQ wants us to wait outside...
> *Psi-7 stepping out of the room and towards the hall.*
> **A24:** Hey, y- *screaming* SHIT, COMMAND, COME IN!
> **CMD:** We're here, what's the issue?
> **A24:** A61 and A37 just slumped over - burns all over their bodies. I... It feels like my skin's on fire, Command. I can't move.
> **CMD:** Shit, shit. Alright, we're scrambling a rescue team. Hang in there A24, stay on the line with me. Keep talking.
> **A24:** [Unintelligible] - suit melting. It's sticking to my skin. Oh god please, I didn't want to die like this, please.
