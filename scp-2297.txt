**Item #:** SCP-2297

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2297 is to be magnetically suspended in a Safe-Class storage locker that is not parallel or perpendicular to the floor in which the storage locker is kept. This storage locker must be assessed for damages once every 24 hours. If the Safe-Class storage locker has been rendered inoperable and/or unsuited for the containment of SCP-2297 an on-site supervisor must be alerted immediately.

**Description:** SCP-2297 has the appearance of a BOSCH RTH6450D1009 5-1-1-Day Programmable Thermostat. Of note is SCP-2297’s unique internal composition. Inside the casing of SCP-2297 rests a fleshy interior comprised of various organs whose functions remain mostly unknown, though visual comparisons liken them to lungs and kidneys much like those found in humans. The flesh itself is highly resistant to any attempt at mechanically sampling it, thus the use of projectional radiology has been necessitated. These tests were able to reveal a system comprised of valves and flaps responsible for the intake and output of oxygen. A proposal to use more invasive forms of sampling is currently awaiting approval.

SCP-2297 functions as a normal thermostat when not placed on a flat surface. When mounted or placed on a flat surface SCP-2297 will display one of a variety of messages that pertain to the anomalous conditions that will be exhibited within the room which SCP-2297 is contained. SCP-2297 does not require any electrical signal to display these messages. Depending on the content of the displayed message, the environment and temperature of the room SCP-2297 occupies is altered drastically. Those located within the same room as SCP-2297 will not notice the effects of change in temperature and environment, and do not believe themselves to be in any danger. These effects dissipate after four minutes instantaneously. The messages documented thus far and their corresponding effects can be found in Addendum-2297-1.

SCP-2297 was recovered at ██████████ after the ██████ Conference, an event notable for being a gathering of scientists dedicated to the preservation of the environment. Having been embedded within the local police force, Agent ██████ notified the Foundation of the presence of anomalous activity after being dispatched to the scene of the incident. All ███ attendees of the ██████ Conference were found dead in conference room 417. The cause of deaths initially labeled as respiratory failure from smoke inhalation and/or self-immolation, but later determined to be immolation by SCP-2297. Although SCP-2297 appears to have some notable cognitive abilities based on conducted research, it does not seem to have any predictable order or reason in which it carries out its several anomalous abilities at this time. 

SCP-2297 appears to self-define a "room" as any area that is enclosed by walls, a floor, a ceiling, and a distinct structural element dividing the room from the rest of the structure. These "divisions" can range from doorways to a change in elevation such as a flight of stairs or a ladder. Repeated testing on a singular room setup yielded many different results and led to the conclusion that SCP-2297 determines for itself what is a room and what is not. SCP-2297 also seems to be able to recognize if it has been placed in an outdoor area and will refuse to activate when placed outside, though testing in this area is slow due to the many precautions necessary for such an experiment.

>  **Message:** FIRE IS NORMAL
> **Effect:** The average temperature of the room increased from 23 degrees Celsius to 1113 degrees Celsius over a period of 4 minutes.
> **Results:** The singular D-Class subject indicated no signs of discomfort or pain as his body was burning. He did not display any symptoms of respiratory insufficiency or succumb to respiratory failure before expiring from fire-related injuries despite the room having purposefully inadequate ventilation. A test was conducted with three Class-D personnel, having similar results. The three D-Class reported nothing out of the ordinary until their expiration.

> **Message:** FREEZING IS NORMAL
> **Effect:** The average temperature of the room decreased from 23 degrees Celsius to -195 degrees Celsius over a period of 4 minutes.
> **Results:** A singular D-Class subject reported no changes in movement capabilities, temperature, or comfort for the entire duration of the test before expiring. Four Class-D personnel responded similarly, the only difference of note being that the D-Class huddled together for warmth in what would be the final stages of profound hypothermia, despite all D-Class claiming otherwise.

> **Message:** EVERYTHING IS NORMAL
> **Effect:** The average temperature of the room increased from 23 degrees Celsius to 36 degrees Celsius over a period of 4 minutes.
> **Results:** Testing was inconclusive. Repeated testing has resulted in subjects who claim to be either melting, freezing, or simply dying. A test conducted with several D-Class in the same room results in each subject reporting a different temperature and condition. Despite their claims the D-Class were never observed to be suffering from any of the described conditions and were fine once removed from the testing room.

> **Message:** STARVATION IS NORMAL
> **Effect:** The average air pressure of the room decreased from 100 kPa to 20 kPa over a period of 4 minutes. Air inside the room condenses, producing a fine mist inside the test chamber.
> **Results:** Researchers noted increased heart rates and lower blood circulation in the D-Class subjects; a post-test autopsy on one subject revealed a severe accumulation of fluids in the lungs. Despite this, all D-Class continued to report that they "feel fine" during testing and none succumbed to the effects of the lowered air pressure until after leaving the testing room.

> **Message:** WET IS NORMAL
> **Effect:** The specific humidity of the room increased from an average of ~44% to a specific humidity of 214% over a period of 4 minutes.
> **Results:** All D-Class tested were observed to have difficulty breathing, with two of the D-Class hyperventilating mid-test. Despite the observed hyperventilation, both D-Class were able to interact and communicate with other D-Class in the test chamber. When researchers requested a response from the affected D-Class they either refused to communicate or were incapable of doing so.


> **Message:** █████████ IS NORMAL
> **Effect:** The environment of the room changed from a controlled temperature of 23 degrees Celsius, consistent air pressure and humidity to one of █████████████████, with averages of ████ and ██. Of note were the ████████████ markings that appeared on the walls as well as the coating of ████████████ that formed on the walls of the test chamber.
> **Results:** [EXPUNGED], with all D-Class quoting numerous related texts found in the Malleus Maleficarum. After a period of 4 minutes of continued ███████████, all D-Class underwent a Type Σ-04 planar shift. All Class-D personnel involved are to be considered lost. Research into what caused these results, and if they can be replicated for further study, is ongoing.
