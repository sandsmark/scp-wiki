**Item #:** SCP-725

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Subject is confined to small coastal inlet adjacent sector 7. SCP-725 shows all biological requirements of its wild analogues, and is to be fed and its enclosure maintained according to on-site biologists. Because of the subject’s sensitive nature, all watercraft are prohibited from operating within a 20 km radius of the enclosure, except as a measure to deter other marine mammals from lingering in the vicinity. Audio recordings are to be played on the hydrophone in the subject’s enclosure for at least 10 hours a day, according to the current project director.

**Description:** Subject is a 13.7 m long, 34,800 kg female cetacean with gross anatomical similarities to //Megaptera novaeangliae//, or the Humpback whale. It was recovered after it began causing maritime disruptions in ██████████ bay. Physically the animal is similar to other humpback whales. Small anatomical differences may indicate it is a subspecies of that organism, or [DATA EXPUNGED] 

Initial hypotheses of increased intelligence or self-awareness proved false. SCP-725 has demonstrated no mental capabilities beyond standard aptitudes of its parent species. What it does have are remarkable abilities of audio retention and mimicry; in effect, it remembers precisely every sound it hears and is able to repeat them at will. This includes unnatural sounds like high frequency vibrations, which other whales cannot duplicate. 

In captivity the subject has exhibited a compulsion to seek out new sounds. This may be adaptive mimicry, a reproductive strategy, or [DATA EXPUNGED] Once Foundation personnel began playing audio recordings regularly in the enclosure, SCP-725’s behavior subsided. The subject often chooses “favorite” sounds which it will repeat for weeks or even months, while others it will simply ignore. This is especially apparent when the subject is played a recording that it has already heard, in which case it ignores the recording and may become agitated. This behavior is theorized to be responsible for the subject’s attacks in the wild, as it often repeats the noises of a ship breaking up or its crew’s cries for help.

**Capture Summary 725:** Unverified reports of an aggressive whale triggered the preliminary investigation. Local authorities had been responding to alleged attacks on watercraft, research and communication buoys, and eventually people at sea. These culminated in an attack on the US Navy submarine █████████████ which resulted in superficial and structural damage, but no loss of life. A further 23 incidents and 19 individuals lost at sea may be attributable to the subject.

In the same time period fisherman had been reporting odd noises echoing across the ocean in the early morning, suggestive of crashing waves (even if the water was completely calm), crushing and grinding like ships colliding, mournful wails, or disembodied cries for help. In all cases the noises were clear and could be heard for miles, but no source could be observed. The reports have since been definitively linked to SCP-725 (and possibly other wild individuals).

 Doctor ████████ did a preliminary on-site examination of the reports and the organism, before classifying it SCP-725 and remanding it to Foundation custody.


**Addendum 725-01:** Under certain conditions, SPC-725 has been observed to cease motion and begin emitting a sound superficially similar to other whales’ “songs”. Due to water conditions at these times, the song can be detected up to ████ km away. On █ occasions answering songs have been detected from an indeterminate source. Mathematical analyses of the songs indicate high order complexity but have failed to shed light on their purpose or meaning.

**Addendum Incident 725-03:** At ████ hrs ██-██-████ a pod of Right whales passed near the containment enclosure. Upon reaching a point 34 km away, they suddenly altered course and began heading directly for it. Boats were dispatched to halt their advance using acoustic deterrents, which were ignored. The whales then dove to the bottom of the ocean, resurfacing at the seawall and beaching themselves forcefully. The animals continued thrashing violently, inflicting deep wounds on themselves until they expired. [DATA EXPUNGED]

Analysis of acoustic recordings revealed that SCP-725 was emitting a reverberant subsonic signal for the duration of the incident.
