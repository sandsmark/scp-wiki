**Item #:** SCP-44
 
**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**  A constant stream of hydrogen ions, unbound oxygen atoms and other trace free radicals emanate from the muzzle of SCP-044 at all times.  Because of this, the docking stations of SCP-044 are to be well ventilated to keep dangerous gases and moisture from accumulating.  Muzzle coverings are to be fitted at all times to keep birds and small animals from investigating the large open barrel of SCP-044.

**Description:**  SCP-044 is an over-sized, stub-barrel gun-type howitzer, secretly manufactured in the late stages of the second World War by Krupp engineers, personally supervised by Albert Speer, German Minister of Armaments and War Production under Adolf Hitler.  SCP-044 is unique not only in size (251,000 kg, or 247 tonnes), but fires unconventional artillery using an atypical delivery method.  Rather than having a breech which allows for shell loading, the rear of the barrel is configured into an air compression chamber.  Anything may be loaded into the muzzle, the more mass loaded into the barrel, greater the explosive impact.  Time spent in the barrel also increases explosive yield.  The large size of SCP-044 means that it must be rail-mounted at all times and moved by two freight trains.
 
Researchers believe that the bonds of molecules holding atoms together are put into a weakened state by SCP-044.  The method by which SCP-044 affects molecular bonds is unknown and is shrouded in mystery by the numerous complex mechanisms that compose the housing of SCP-044 (Some mechanisms appear useless and appear to do nothing other than make noise or spin).  It further complicates research as this process continues even when SCP-044 is not supplied with power.  Equipment and personnel have all been lost, exploring the inside of the barrel.
 
When fired, all matter within the barrel is ejected at a high rate of speed as a glowing red slug, proportional in size to the amount of mass inserted into the barrel.  Upon striking a solid object or ground, the slug explodes with a yield proportional to the mass of the original object at about 0..227% mass to energy conversion.  Meaning; 27,400 kg (7 tonnes, or 15,600 lbs) of material will generate a yield of 11 Kilotons of TNT (nearly the yield of the "little boy" nuclear weapon).  The greatest yield was achieved when 'The Administrator's' 8,800 kg (19,500 lb) personal diesel pickup truck was loaded in its entirety into the muzzle of SCP-044 and fired in the pictured "experiment."
