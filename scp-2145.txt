**Item #:** SCP-2145
     
**Object Class:** Keter
     
**Special Containment Procedures:** As conventional neutralization/containment tactics have failed for instances of SCP-2145, extreme containment or neutralization operations are currently being prepared for deployment in the very near future.
     
**Description:** SCP-2145 is the collective term for four individuals (three men, one woman) currently residing in New York City, New York, USA. All instances of SCP-2145 are acquaintances, and routinely engage in social activities with other instances on a regular basis. Social activities include:
* Eating
* Drinking
* Attending sporting events
* Attending theater and/or music productions
* Attending informal, rapid gatherings at one or more places of residence
     
SCP-2145's anomalous effect occurs whenever an instance comes into contact with another human being; contact for this event being defined as "coming within walking or talking distance of an instance of SCP-2145," the distance being required for this being variable. When this event (hereby referred to as Event-001) occurs, all sentient beings that are not SCP-2145 instances experience mild to severe behavioral disruption. Within an amount of time ranging from one minute to one week of Event—001, all Event—001 victims will intersect paths multiple times with SCP-2145 instances. The resulting interactions vary wildly; observed cases have ranged from violent conflict to carnal encounters to emotional trauma. To date, no definite pattern has been established to predict the outcome of an Event—001 instance.
     
An individual may have more than one Event—001 encounter; however, the behavioral changes and interactions resulting will be similar to the first Event—001 interaction, with continuity between the Event interactions being observed in all recorded cases.
     
The behavioral changes caused by Event—001, as with the outcomes associated with it, vary. The most common reported experience in surviving cases is a compulsion to interact with SCP-2145 instances; however, this is not universal, and everything from dissociative states to active participation have been recorded.
     
The mechanism with which Event—001 or the subsequent behavioral changes occur is not known at this time.
     
SCP-2145 are hypothesized to be a group of extremely powerful latent reality benders. To date, all attempts to kill SCP-2145 instances have failed; all assassination teams have been participants in Event—001. Traditional and double-blind options have not been successful; triple-blind and mass-casualty options have not yet been attempted.
     
**Addendum 2145-01:** Transcript of interview with SCP-2145-ZF, an Event—001 victim:

> **Doctor Braun[[footnote]]Lead researcher on SCP-2145[[/footnote]]:** If you don't mind, I'd like you to tell us about your experience.
>
> **SCP-2145-ZF (Hereafter ZF):** Oh, god. God damn it. It was horrible. Absolutely horrible. One of the worst experiences of my life. I shudder every time I think about it, y'know?
>
> **Braun:** Your encounter with █████ █████████ (SCP-2145-01)?
>
> **ZF:** An encounter? An //encounter?// You call two months of dating that //thing// an //encounter?// I fucked him! It was like fucking a chimpanzee! Like fucking a Neanderthal! Why is it even called fur anyway? It's certainly not because it's how it sounds. When was the last time you rubbed some fur and heard it growl? When was the last time you saw someone rub it and growl? If we're going by sounds, it should be called 'schtscht![[footnote]]Pronounced 'schist'[[/footnote]]' [Subject pauses; starts crying].
>
> **Braun:** Would you like to do this another time?
>
> **ZF:** [Crying] It's what he did every day! That inane patter! It was funny at first, yeah. But you try living with having every aspect of your life analyzed and mocked and pointed out and see how you like it! I couldn't stop myself! I had to keep seeing him and seeing him and going to his pathetic fucking little coffee shop and see his pathetic fucking little friends and I hated it! I hated it! Goddamn it! [Subject continues crying; further questions postponed].
> [[size 0%]]He's a successful businessman now, you know.[[/size]]

**Addendum 2145-02:** Due to the large number of people affected by 001 events, as well as the growing tolerance of amnestics residents of New York City have developed, large-scale introduction of amnestics to the water supply can no longer be sustained. On 5/14/1998, containment failure of SCP-2145 occurred, causing widespread panic in the civilian populace. As such, containment or neutralization tactics not typically considered are being considered for execution. Mass amnestic mechanisms are being tested for deployment following the removal of SCP-2145.

**Addendum 2145-03:** Abridged record of movements of SCP-2145-04 on 5/20/1998:

> **[00:50]:** Subject begins screaming in sleep, cause unknown.
>
> **[04:23]:** Subject ceases screaming.
>
> **[07:57]:** Subject submerses self entirely in near-boiling water and emerges with non life-threatening burns. Protection method used by subject unknown.
>
> **[09:10]:** Subject visits apartment of SCP-2145-01; subjects begin conversation regarding "human-sized microwave oven."
>
> **[10:01]:** Subjects are joined by SCP-2145-02 and SCP-2145-03. Subjects begin arguing about said microwave.
>
> **[12:23]:** Subject goes to nearby cafe to get lunch. Upon seeing said instance of SCP-2145, all cafe patrons enter assorted stages of panic, hysteria, and despair[[footnote]]Note—Said cafe was promptly condemned by the New York State Department of Health for the safety of the public; the ninth such cafe. All employees of these cafes follow SCP-2145 instances to whatever cafe is chosen the following day.[[/footnote]] Subject appears slightly confused, but otherwise unaware of any panic caused.
>
> **[12:31]:** Subject is joined by SCP-2145-01. The remaining patron commits suicide[[footnote]]Note: suicide is ineffective in preventing the involuntary actions arising from an 001 event, with patrons continuing their behavioral changes in a state of advanced decomposition and extreme distress. SCP-2145 instances remain unaffected by this.[[/footnote]].
>
> **[12:44]:** SCP-2145-BA arrives with bottle of vodka. Subject is sobbing uncontrollably and begging for his life back. SCP-2145 instances greet with fake enthusiasm and make veiled references to his alcoholism.
>
> **[13:48]:** Subject masturbates.
>
> **[13:49]:** Subject handles food for a potluck; evidence of hand-washing inconclusive.
>
> **[16:57]:** Subject attends potluck with other SCP-2145 instances. All other attendees are in various states of distress and/or death.
>
> **[19:45]:** Subjects leave potluck; discuss their extreme dislike for all attendees.
>
> **[21:30]:** Subject watches television.
>
> **[23:21]:** Subject falls asleep
>
> **[23:59]:** Subject begins screaming in sleep; cause unknown.
>
> **[End Log 5/20/1998]**
