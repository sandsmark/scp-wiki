**Item #:** SCP-2145
     
**Object Class:** --Euclid-- Safe
     
**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-2145 are to be contained in standard humanoid containment units in Site-19. Instances are allowed one hour's recreation; however, all movements made by instances are to be recorded and reported, with additional preventative action taken at the current site administrator's discretion.

**Description:** SCP-2145 is the collective term for three men and one woman previously residing in New York City, New York, USA (hereafter referred to individually as SCP-2145-A through SCP-2145-D).

All instances of SCP-2145, when under their own volition, congregate around areas where anomalous events occur. This attraction is completely involuntary and is unrecognized by all instances.
[[size 0%]]F[[/size]]
Anomalous events responded to by SCP-2145 instances vary wildly, and include upwards of ninety five percent of all anomalous events in New York City occurring --within a calendar year-- from a period between 05/15/2000 to their containment on 09/24/2016[[footnote]]For more information, see "A Complete Record of Anomalous Events in New York City, New York, U.S.A. Volume 4—1950-2005" and "A Complete Record of Anomalous Events in New York City, New York, U.S.A. Volume 5—2006 to Today".[[/footnote]].

Being present during an anomalous event does not guarantee the safety of SCP-2145 instances; cumulatively, 316 instances have been --killed-- eliminated during Foundation observation beginning in 2006[[footnote]]Note—'eliminate' here stands for all anomalies that permanently impaired instances of SCP-2145 including death; the range of anomalies witnessed by instances was, as previously mentioned, quite large, and included not just death but massive trauma, spontaneous relocation, quantum entanglement, and transformation into nonsentient masses of spinach aspic. Normal trauma and impairment do not trigger replacement.[[/footnote]]. However, within twenty-four hours of elimination, new SCP-2145 instances appear in their respective apartments with no memory of their death or subsequent resuscitation. --The mechanism behind this is currently unknown.-- See Addendum 2145-02.

**Addendum 2145-02:** On 06/10/2009, after approximately three years of Foundation observation, the mechanism behind SCP-2145 replacement was discovered. All apartments owned by 2145 instances were equipped with a hidden system of pneumatic tubes leading to a large underground room containing a device hereafter referred to as SCP-2145-1.
[[size 0%]]D[[/size]]
SCP-2145-1, when activated, effectively filters through a variety of separate dimensions, identifies ones in which instances of SCP-2145 are not dead, transfers them to its localized dimension, and automatically brings them to their respective apartments via the pneumatic system.
[[size 0%]]T[[/size]]
Due to SCP-2145-1's sensitive location (Rockefeller Plaza), the extreme delicacy of SCP-2145-1's machinery, and the armed guards from an unknown organization, it took several additional years before SCP-2145-1 could be successfully contained. Both SCP-2145 A-D and SCP-2145-1 were subsequently contained in Site-19.
