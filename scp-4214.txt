**Item #:** SCP-4214

**Object Class:** --Safe-- Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4214-A and SCP-4214-B are to be kept in separate containment cells in Site 103. Each containment cell is to be under constant video surveillance. All personnel assigned to monitor SCP-4214 must be self-proclaimed atheists. Any personnel avowing devout faith in any religion attempting to enter either containment chamber are to be prevented by any means up to and including termination.


**Description:** SCP-4214 refers to two objects, designated SCP-4214-A and SCP-4214-B.

SCP-4214-A is a scepter 80 centimeters in length, constructed of gold with silver ornamentation. It is topped with an emerald cut into a sphere approximately 12 centimeters in diameter. Below the emerald are three sockets that appear to have been designed to hold other jewels. Marks indicate that at some point, the other jewels on SCP-4214-A were forcefully pried from their sockets. On the haft of the scepter is engraved in Arabic: "And through his faith, the Kingdom comes."

When SCP-4214-A is touched by a person who expresses significant religious faith, they will experience a vision of a significant figure in their religion. Immediately after this vision ends, the subject will attempt to take SCP-4214-A and bring it into contact with SCP-4214-B. The subject will show little to no concern for their own life or the lives of others in the pursuit of this goal. When SCP-4214-A is removed from the subject, they will attempt to recover it until physically unable to do so. In the event that SCP-4214 has been removed from the subject for an indeterminate period of time (current observations range from 2 hours to 7 days), the subject will become extremely agitated, proclaiming that they have 'failed to bring the kingdom'. After several hours of this, the subject will commit suicide.

To date, only one subject was lucid enough after capture to be interviewed. The subject remained lucid for 6 days 13 hours, at which point he managed to escape restraints by breaking several of the major bones in his hands. Subject then attacked one of the on-site security personnel, forcing the guard to shoot him. Subject expired from his wounds 45 minutes later.

> **Interviewed:** D-6620
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Jessica Blackburn (Observation Lead on SCP-4214-A)
> 
> **Foreword:** D-6620 was exposed to SCP-4214-A during an early test shortly after the object's acquisition. He proceeded to grab SCP-4214-A and run for the chamber door, at which point he was incapacitated by on-site security.

> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Hello, D-6620.
> 
> **D-6620:** Give it back.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** SCP-4214-A?
> 
> **D-6620:** The Scepter. The Key. The Jewel of the Kingdom. It isn't yours to keep.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** What kingdom?
> 
> **D-6620:** //The// Kingdom. The only one that matters. The Kingdom of God.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Tell me about this Kingdom, D-6620.
> 
> **D-6620:** The Preacher has given us the Word. His Empire shall await, and when the time is right it shall march forth and bring the Kingdom of Heaven onto Earth. All those who do not believe shall be slain, and the righteous and the pure shall build unto ourselves Heaven upon Earth.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Who is the Preacher?
> 
> **D-6620:** A man. Just a man, just a man. But how can a man have so much light? If I hid here, in this place beneath the earth, will I be spared from the coming of the Kingdom?
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** What did you see when you touched SCP-4214-A?
> 
> **D-6620:** I saw, I saw, I saw. I saw the Empire in waiting and I saw an empty throne. And the Lord did anoint me and bless me with his grace for thine is the kingdom and the glory and the power now and forever and ever and ever and ever and-
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Where were you taking SCP-4214-A? What would you have done if we hadn't stopped you?
> 
> **D-6620:** ever and ever and ever and-
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** D-6620! 
> 
> **D-6620:** The Gate.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Do you mean SCP-4214-B? Why would you take it there? 
> 
> **D-6620:** Because the Kingdom is not coming. It is here. It is here and we are waiting. I can show you, if you like. I can- Oh God, deliver me from this-
> 
> //D-6620 falls unconscious.//
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** D-6620? Are you- Fuck. Someone take him back to the cells. We're done here. 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** D-6620 committed suicide 4 hours later. After this information, Dr. Blackburn submitted a formal request for exploration of SCP-4214-C.
>
> //D-6620 was the most useful source of information we had on SCP-4214. Every bit of information he had, we jumped at. It was almost too easy. Well, I say almost. It was too easy. We might have figured it out sooner, of course.//

>//But we were asking the wrong questions.//

SCP-4214-B is a sandstone arch approximately 3 meters in height. It was transported to Site-103 from its original location in southern India after carvings were matched with those on SCP-4214-A. Carbon dating indicates that the archway is roughly 900 years old. The carving appears to be in a form of Arabic, proclaiming that 'here stands the border to the Prester's Empire'. 

SCP-4214-B possesses no anomalous properties except when brought into contact with SCP-4214-A. When SCP-4214-A is brought within 1 meter of SCP-4214-B, the archway will form a portal into an extradimensional space designated SCP-4214-C. This portal appears as a curtain of green light. This property can be activated by anyone in possession of SCP-4214-A, whether or not they are under its effect.

Once an individual has passed through SCP-4214-B, it appears to be bonded to them somehow. From that point on, only this subject can pass through the portal. It is unknown if death will cause this bond to cease.

Objects can only pass through SCP-4214-B when taken through by a human. Video footage cannot be transmitted through SCP-4214-B - however, this restriction does not apply to audio.


**Addendum 4214.1: Exploration Logs**

After further tests on SCP-4214-A failed to provide valuable data, exploration into SCP-4214-C was authorised by Project Supervisor Adams.

> **Dr. Blackburn:** D-3462? Do you read me?
> 
> **D-3462:** Loud and fuckin' clear, Doc. Holy shit, it's like- There's a whole other world through there. How-
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Please focus. Describe to me what you're seeing.
> 
> **D-3462:** Yeah, yeah. It- it's outside. Beautiful day. Sun shining, green grass - it looks like a farm. It's hot, too. 
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** These farms, what do they look like?
> 
> **D-3462:** The houses look like domes made out of this white stuff. Clay, maybe?
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Do you see any signs of life?
> 
> **D-3462:** Yeah, the fucking farms. Are you even listening to me?
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Are there any people nearby?
> 
> **D-3462:** I don't see anyone. I can see machines though, down in the fields. Some kind of farming robot? No people, though. But someone had to build all this, right?
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Please enter one of the houses.
> 
> **D-3462:** I'm inside now. It's a nice place. Big fire, nice kitchen - hey, you guys should sell these places if I can't find anyone. There's some kind of computer screen in the wall, but it's not in any language I know. This is- woah!
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** D-3462? What is it?
> 
> **D-3462:** Sorry to burst in like that. I didn't see anyone home. Hey Doc, I found someone. A woman. She looks like she's baking something - smells good too. 
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Does she speak English?
> 
> **D-3462:** I dunno. Hey lady, do you speak- Woah. That's fucking weird.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** What is it?
> 
> **D-3462:** I touched her arm and for a second it was like she //flickered//. Like she disappeared and reappeared and -
> 
> **Unknown Woman:** Welcome, traveller. You must be weary. Please, rest a while. There will be food and drink soon. We haven't had a visitor in - oh, so long now. What's your name?
> 
> **D-3462:** Steve.
> 
> **Unknown Woman:** Steve. I am Alannya. Welcome to the Presbyterate. Have you brought news?
> 
> **D-3462:** Tell me about the Presbyterate. Where are we?
> 
> **Alannya:** This is the Empire of Prester John, of course! Where else would the Gate lead you? I am honored to welcome you here, Steve. 
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** The Empire of- Hold on a moment.
> 
> **Alannya:** So tell me, Steve. What do you follow?
> 
> **D-3462:** Er- follow? I work for these Foundation guys, but-
> 
> **Alannya:** No, silly! What do you //follow//? The star? The cross? The crescent moon? Those are the most common among our visitors, but others have come before. What is your faith?
> 
> **D-3462:** I've never really gone in for religion. Seeing is believing, I guess, and I never saw any God.
> 
> **Alannya:** An unbeliever? Those //are// rare. You shouldn't be wasting time in the outer farms. You should go to the Court - they haven't seen one of you in - oh, so long now. Or perhaps go to the Sages. They can show you a path.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** A court? Interesting. Ask her how long it's been since outsiders came here.
> 
> **D-3462:** When was the last traveller who came to the Presb- The Empire?
> 
> **Alannya:** Oh, so long now. So long. He promised us he'd find- Oh, but enough about him. You should eat, rest - do what you will. Tomorrow, we set out for the City. Oh, but this is a blessed day indeed!
> 
> //A horn blows in the distance. Three long blasts.//
> 
> **D-3462:** Hey, quick question. What the fuck was that?
> 
> **Alannya:** Prester's eyes! How did they- Quickly, you have to go. Now! The Flame are coming!
> 
> **D-3462:** Who-
> 
> **Alannya:** The Order of the Flame. They- Is the Gate still open?
> 
> **D-3462:** Yeah. Just up the hill.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Wait! See if you can get a look at this 'Order of the Flame' first.
> 
> **Alannya:** Go! Now!
> 
> **D-3462:** Are you crazy? 
> 
> **Alannya:** You have to leave!
> 
> **D-3462:** Will you-
> 
> **Alannya:** I'll be fine! Go! If they catch you here they'll kill you!
> 
> **D-3462:** I'll come back.
> 
> **Alannya:** I pray you do.
> 
> **D-3462:** OK. I'm outside. I can see the Flame guys now. There's two of them - tall guys in cloaks. I can't see much more from here. Hey Doc, I got a bad feeling about this. Can I please come back now?
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Given the circumstances, that would be... advisable. I don't think we can get anything useful from sending you to get killed.
> 
> //The horn sounds again//
> 
> **D-3462:** Shit shit shit shit shit! They're coming! How the fuck do they-
> 
> //There is a high-pitched ring, followed by a loud crackling noise.//
> 
> **D-3462:** Woah! What the fuck was that?
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** What is it?
> 
> **D-3462:** Some kind of gun? I don't know because I'm busy not getting fucking shot, OK!
> 
> //The weapon fires again//
> 
> //D-3462 reaches the portal//
> 
> [END LOG]
> 
> **Additional Statement:** This first exploration proves promising. SCP-4214-C seems to be linked to the Empire of Prester John, a mythical Christian empire somewhere in the east. Originally it was placed in Central Asia, then India, and finally Ethiopia. Civilisation seems to exist, and based on the incident with this 'Order of the Flame', it seems they are in possession of fairly advanced weapons technology. I plan to submit a request for further exploration.

> **Dr. Blackburn:** D-3462. Do you read me?
> 
> **D-3462:** Yeah. I'm through. This- it's not the same place as before. It's dark. I think I'm inside a building.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Can you see a way out?
> 
> **D-3462:** Hold on, let me get the flashlight. And... there!
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** What do you see?
> 
> **D-3462:** I think I'm in a supply closet or something. There are tools stacked up against the wall. Covered in dust. I don't think anyone's used this place in a long time. There's a door over here and I think - yeah. That's weird. The floor is vibrating.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Go through the door.
> 
> **D-3462:** Hold on. It's stuck. I think if I- fuck. It's harder than I thought. Maybe if I- woah!

> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** D-3462? Are you all right? 
> 
> **D-3462:** Ah, fuck. Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I put my hand on the door and it just vanished. 
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Vanished?
> 
> **D-3462:** Yeah, it just disappeared. No light, no sound, just gone. Then I fell over and knocked a shelf down. 
>

> 
> **D-3462:** I- oh damn. Oh damn. That's fucking crazy, man! 
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** What is it?
> 
> **D-3462:** You ever see Star Trek, Doc? That's the kinda shit they got in here.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Elaborate, please.
> 
> **D-3462:** OK. OK. I'm in this huge room, made out of brick. All down the middle are these white cubes, about three by three feet. Every couple seconds, the boxes just //flash// and something comes out.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** What kind of 'something'?
> 
> **D-3462:** All kinds of stuff. This one here, it's making gold bars. And over here, this one's making some kind of circuit. Another one's making bales of fabric. Every three or four seconds, they get pushed out, a hole opens in the floor and they fall through - and then it closes and the boxes make a new one. 
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** This is- that's very interesting. Are there any people? An operator, maybe?
> 
> **D-3462:** Nah. No one I can see. I'm going to see if I can find the way outside. 
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Okay. See if you can get a closer look at one of these machines first.
> 
> **D-3462:** Sure. I- Hold on. There's someone there. He looks like he's fixing one of the boxes. Hello? Hey, I'm talking to you!
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Don't antagonise the locals.
> 
> **D-3462:** He can't hear me. I'm standing right next to him. Hey, yo-
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** D-3462? 
> 
> **D-3462:** Fuck! He did the- the thing. Like the woman before. I grabbed his shoulder and it was like- my hand sunk //into// him. Then he did that flickering thing and now- now he's looking at me.
> 
> **Unknown Man:** Hello.
> 
> **D-3462:** Hi?
> 
> **Unknown Man:** Erm... what are you doing here?
> 
> **D-3462:** A very good question. Who are you?
> 
> **Unknown Man:** I'm Yemane. What are you doing here?
> 
> **D-3462:** First off. Where is here, exactly?
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Interesting. He seems- different, somehow, to the other woman.
> 
> **Yemane:** Production Unit Vas. We're shutting down today. Why would you come here?
> 
> **D-3462:** I honestly have no idea.
> 
> **Yemane:** Where are you from? What's your name?
> 
> **D-3462:** I'm Steve. 
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Ask him about the Order of the Flame.
> 
> **D-3462:** I ran into these people a while back. Called themselves the 'Order of the Flame'. Know anything about them?
> 
> **Yemane:** Oh no. No no no no no. You are //not// getting me into trouble with them. Get out of here.
> 
> **D-3462:** I just want to know about them. You're not in any danger.
> 
> **Yemane:** You really aren't from here, are you? The Flame is always listening, Steve.
> 
> **D-3462:** How so?
> 
> **Yemane:** Their job is to find heretics. Somehow, they just - they just //know// when someone's faith isn't genuine. And then they come, and they take you.
> 
> **D-3462:** So they're like the Inquisition or something?
> 
> **Yemane:** That's an apt term for them. They're one of the three Orders founded by the Prester before he left. The Flame, the Shield and the Star.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Ask him more. Any details on this world can be useful.
> 
> **D-3462:** So the Flame kills heretics. What do the others do?
> 
> **Yemane:** The Shield secures the realm. Enforces the laws, protects from outside threats and resolves legal disputes. The Star's duty is research - creating new technologies as well as studying the Gate.
> 
> **D-3462:** And the Prester? 
> 
> **Yemane:** What of him?
> 
> **D-3462:** Who is he? 
> 
> **Yemane:** You- you're joking.
> 
> **D-3462:** Sadly not.
> 
> **Yemane:** The- the one who created this place. The one who secured the Empire from invaders. Prester John? Our Eternal Emperor?
> 
> **D-3462:** And you say he left? Where to?
> 
> **Yemane:** Every child knows the story of the Prester. How he found the Key in an endless desert, and through his faith and its power brought about an empire. His empire stood as the mightiest in the world - and so invaders conspired to destroy it. The Prester was mighty, but even he could not fight all the forces of the world. And so, he sealed us away. We remained here for centuries, preparing for the Return - and then the Prester left. How do you not know this story? Where were you educated?
> 
> **D-3462:** That's sort of a long story. So who runs the Empire now?
> 
> **Yemane:** Prester's eyes! You- you're an outsider!
> 
> **D-3462:** I was sort of hoping to avoid that conversation.
> 
> **Yemane:** How- the Gate. It's open, then? The Key has been found?
> 
> **D-3462:** Erm... Yes?
> 
> **Yemane:** By Heavens! Then the time is come?
> 
> **D-3462:** Quite possibly.
> 
> **Yemane:** The Star must be alerted. Stay here.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** I think you've stayed here long enough. Whatever they mean by 'the time has come', we certainly don't want them completing this prophecy of theirs before we know what it is. Get back through the portal immediately.
> 
> **D-3462:** Fuck.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** What's wrong?
> 
> **D-3462:** The shelf I knocked. It's blocking the door. I should be able to move it in a secon-
> 
> **Unknown Voice:** There he is! 
> 
> **D-3462:** Shit!
> 
> **Unknown Voice:** Outsider, please, wait! You are a crucial part of this! The Empire depends on you now!
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Ignore him. Get back through, now!
> 
> **D-3462:** The Empire can wait!
> 
> **Unknown Voice:** Stun him!
> 
> //There is a high-pitched whine and an electric crackle.//
> 
> **D-3462:** Hold on! Don't shoot! Jesus fucking Christ!

> 
> **Additional Statement:** We know a little more about the hierarchy of the Presbyterate now, but I believe the potential danger posed by this prophecy of the 'Return' is too great to justify further human exploration at this time. The inhabitants of SCP-4214-C are clearly willing to go to extreme lengths to capture an outsider to fulfill their prophecy - a prophecy I believe could lead to SCP-4214 breaching containment. I plan to submit a request to terminate human exploration into SCP-4214-C.

> **D-3462:** Well, you're much nicer than the Flame and the Star from what I've seen.
> 
> **Cuathis:** Yeah. They both want you for various reasons - the Star think you're the key to the Return and the Flame think you're- well, the Devil, basically.
> 
> **D-3462:** Are you shitting me?
> 
> **Cuathis:** Afraid not. In here, please.
> 
> **D-3462:** It- it's just a big white ball. How am I meant to- woah. That's fucking cool.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** What happened?
> 
> **D-3462:** Cuathis touched it and it just- faded out. There's a doorway now. I'm going in.
> 
> **Cuathis:** You may want to brace yourself for this next bit.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** What does she mean? What-
> 
> **D-3462:** Oh, no way. No //fucking// way.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** D-3462?
> 
> **D-3462:** You have got to be kidding me. I've seen some shit, but this is- well, this is impossible.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** D-3462! 
> 
> **D-3462:** This thing- the inside is bigger than the outside.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Really? Now that is interesting. 
> 
> **Cuathis:** It's not as dramatic as some places. Expensive, though. Strictly speaking this Sphere is on loan from the Court, so try not to break anything.
> 
> **D-3462:** How- how did you make this?
> 
> **Cuathis:** Well, I didn't make it. But I think what they do is make a small sphere first, then put a larger sphere inside it.
> 
> **D-3462:** That's not- that doesn't-
> 
> **Cuathis:** And we're here. Out you get now, quick smart.
> 
> **D-3462:** Where are we? A prison?
> 
> **Cuathis:** No, no, of course not. 
> 
> **D-3462:** Oh. Good. I was worried that-
> 
> **Cuathis:** This is the Hall of Judgement. Here, you will be tried.
> 
> **D-3462:** What? A trial! But-
> 
> **Cuathis:** I hope you've prepared a defence, Steve.
> 
> **D-3462:** I-
> 
> **Cuathis:** They're waiting for you inside.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** This is- well, this is a development. 
> 
> **D-3462:** Doc? Please tell me you've got a way out of this.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Just go along with it. If you need to escape, I may have an idea.
> 
> **Cuathis:** Don't worry. It's going to be all right.
> 
> **D-3462:** Yeah. Okay. Let's go in.
> 
> //There is the sound of a hammer striking wood.//
> 
> **Unknown Man:** All stand before His Benevolence, High Inquisitor Zelal!
> 
> **Zelal:** The court now sits in judgement. Keeper Cuathis, present the accused.
> 
> **Cuathis:** Here stands Steven Ellis.
> 
> **Zelal:** Keeper Solome, what charges do you lay against this man?
> 
> **Solome:** The Order of the Flame knows this man as a Class Four heretic.
> 
> **D-3462:** I recognise her! She was the one who attacked me at the farm!
> 
> **Zelal:** The accused will be silent. Keeper Kiros, what claim do you offer in this man's defense?
> 
> **Kiros:** This man is the outsider we have waited for. He has touched the Gate, borne the Key - this man is the Heir to the Presbyterate.
> 
> //Shouting. The hammer slams down several times before silence returns.//
> 
> **Solome:** Heresy! This man cannot be Heir! He is a heretic and a criminal!
> 
> **Cuathis:** Even heretics have rights, Solome. And whether or not he is a criminal is what we're here to decide.
> 
> **Zelal:** Thank you, Cuathis. Now. Keeper Solome, what punishment would you place upon the accused?
> 
> **Solome:** Heresy is a crime of the highest order. There can be only one punishment. He will be given to the Flame to purify his sins.
> 
> **Zelal:** Keeper Kiros? What would you have me do?
> 
> **D-3462:** The other guy, Kiros - he's the one from the factory. 
> 
> **Kiros:** I would have him delivered to the Order of the Star for examination. Then I would have him lead us through the Gate and back into the world we left behind.
> 
> **Solome:** You would give this heretic command of our armies! He would destroy us!
> 
> **Kiros:** Better to die than languish here for eternity!
> 
> **Zelal:** This is a courtroom, not a children's game. Compose yourselves or be removed, both of you. How can you attest to the outsider's conduct in our realm?
> 
> **Kiros:** He appeared in Production Unit Vas before its shutdown last week. He spoke to Technician Yemane, and from what we were able to gather he treated him courteously and left him unharmed - not even attempting to take any of the items from the manipulators. 
> 
> **Solome:** Lies! The Order of the Flame interrogated the woman Alannya and found that this man entered her home like a criminal, stealing food and-
> 
> **D-3462:** Hey, that's not-
> 
> **Zelal:** The accused will be silent.
> 
> **D-3462:** Sorry. Shutting up now.
> 
> **Kiros:** Inquisitor. We both know that the Flame's... techniques leave the victim unable to speak for months afterwards. This is unsubstantiated gossip!
> 
> **Solome:** You dare-
> 
> **Zelal:** Enough, both of you!
> 
> **Solome:** He would pardon a heretic and a thief!
> 
> **Kiros:** She would kill our only hope of escape!
> 
> **Zelal:** I said enough! The next person to speak out of turn will be thrown from this courtroom! Am I understood?
> 
> **Solome:** Yes, Inquisitor.
> 
> **Kiros:** Yes, Inquisitor.
> 
> **Cuathis:** Yes, Inquisitor.
> 
> **Zelal:** Excellent. Now. I have reached my verdict.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** D-3462. When I tell you to run, run.
> 
> **Zelal:** Heresy is a serious crime - but even a chance this man might be the Heir is too much to ignore. If this man is not the Heir, however - he is just a heretic. Therefore, he shall be given to the Order of the Star-
> 
> **Solome:** Bu-
> 
> **Zelal:** Let me finish, Keeper. He shall be given to the Order of the Star for one month's time. If he cannot prove himself the Heir by then, he shall be given the punishment of a heretic by the Order of the Flame. If he can - then he shall come into the Kingdom. Do all parties find these terms agreeable?
> 
> **Kiros:** One month is a short time. But with faith, we shall persevere. I accept these terms.
> 
> **Solome:** And when your 'Heir' does not deliver - he is mine, Kiros. I accept these terms
> 
> **Cuathis:** I... I am not sure. While heretics must be punished-
> 
> **Solome:** Thank you.
> 
> **Cuathis:** The Return is what we have waited centuries for. We cannot throw away a chance - but is keeping this man under the Star's knife helping anything? The prophecies say that the Heir will come and go unrestrained-
> 
> **Kiros:** As he has already done! 
> 
> **Cuathis:** I advise caution, is all.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** When I tell you, run through the doors past Cuathis. Are you ready?
> 
> **D-3462:** Yeah.
> 
> **Zelal:** Speak when directed, accuse-
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Run!
> 
> //The courtroom erupts into shouting. D-3462 is breathing heavily and the sounds fade quickly. Metallic footsteps can be heard, and the Keepers' weapons are firing//
> 
> **Cuathis:** Stop! You idiot! You have no idea what you're doing!
> 
> //D-3462 continues running//
> 
> **Solome:** Guards! Kill him!
> 
> **Kiros:** No! Capture him alive!
> 
> **Cuathis:** Damn it all, Steve! There's no way out of here!
> 
> **D-3462:** Doc? She's right! There's just a balcony!
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Jump!
> 
> **D-3462:** Are you fucking insane?
> 
> **Kiros:** Please, honored one! Let us help you. Come back to the courtroom.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Trust me!
> 
> **D-3462:** Why the fuck should I? You're the ones who use me as a guinea pig!
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** This place isn't real, D-3462! It needs you! It won't throw your life away now, now //jump//!
> 
> **Cuathis:** Fire!
> 
> //D-3462 screams. There is the rushing of air, the sound of weapons firing - 
> Silence.//
> 
> 
> 
> //Silence.//
> 
> 
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** D-3462?
> 
> 
> //Silence//
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** D-3462, report in.
> 
> **D-3462:** Holy motherfucking shit. That- that actually worked.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Yes, I thought so. The non-responsive people were my first indicator. This world isn't fully real. It only simulates where it expects you to be. How could it expect you to dive off the side of a building?
> 
> **D-3462:** Yeah. Only one question now. Where the fuck am I?
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Describe it to me.
> 
> **D-3462:** Black. I'm standing in what looks like a liquid. It's not water, though. Thicker. It's like- I don't know. Not like anything I know. It's barely ankle deep.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Anything specific? Walls, doors-
> 
> **D-3462:** It's just fucking black, okay! I'm shining the flashlight out and I can't see anything in any direction, anywhere except pitch fucking black. You got me in here Doc, so how the fuck do I get out now?
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Ah.
> 
> //Silence//
> 
> **D-3462:** Oh, great. You don't fucking know, do you? I'm stuck in this endless fucking void and you have no fucking clue how to help me! I should have fucking stayed up there. God, I wish I could just-
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** D-3462?
> 
> **D-3462:** I see a light. It- Oh, thank God. It's the Gate! 
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** I suggest you get out of there before this place realises what's happened.
> 
> **D-3462:** What happens then?
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** It remembers what happens when you jump off a balcony. And then it happens to you.
> 
> **D-3462:** Great. Okay. Getting out. I- ugh!
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** What is it?
> 
> **D-3462:** I tripped over- that's weird. There's a sack on the ground. 
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Open it.
> 
> **D-3462:** It- it's a pile of books.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Any title?
> 
> **D-3462:** Hold on- it says- huh.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** What?
>  
> **D-3462:** It says: "The Complete and True Account of Presbyter Johannes by his Own Hand."
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Bring it through. Immediately.
> 
> //D-3462 enters the portal//
> 
> [END LOG]
> 
> **Additional Statement:** We've confirmed a significant hypothesis of mine. SCP-4214-C isn't a whole world, but rather an artificially created one.. When D-3462 jumped, the world was unable to anticipate it and thus he ended up - well, nowhere. Now only one thing remains to ask. 
> If everything in there is a deliberate creation, and D-3462 ended up outside of it somehow - 
> Who put the journals there?
> 
> //It was a reasonable hypothesis. But in hindsight, I should have known. The way that once I came to my conclusion it was like everything changed to fit it. The journals should have told us what we needed to figure out; although by then I suspect it was already too late for both of us.//

> **Personnel:** D-3462
> 
> **Supervisor:** Dr. Blackburn
> 
> **Additional Exploration Notes:** Following the revelations of Exploration 3, the journals were sent away for translation. While the title was in English, the bulk of the text was in what appeared to be Medieval Latin. After much deliberation, Supervisor Adams and I decided to allow one further exploration of SCP-4214-C using D-3462 in the hopes of ascertaining more information on the original Prester John.
> 
> [BEGIN LOG]
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Are you ready, D-3462?
> 
> **D-3462:** Yeah. Let's just get this over with before I end up jumping off another building.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Enter the portal, please.
> 
> **D-3462:** It feels different somehow. Like- like it was a calm sea before, and now it's in a storm. I'm going in,
> 
> //D-3462 enters the portal. There is a burst of static. Contact is lost for 3.52 seconds.//
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** D-3462. Respond.
> 
> **D-3462:** I'm through. I- I'm in a big, circular room. The floor and ceiling are made out of the same stuff as the boxes and the sphere from before - some kind of white metal. The wall is glass and- 
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Yes?
> 
> **D-3462:** It looks out over a city. A big city, too. Like, I lived in London and this is easily twice the size from what I can see. Those weird spheres are flying around everywhere and- it's green. Really green. There are plants growing in the streets and- off the sides of the skyscrapers. When I said I was in a garden last time - I think it might just have been a street here.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Interesting. Is there anyone in the room?
> 
> **D-3462:** No. There doesn't seem to be a door- but in the center, here, there's a raised platform. There's some kind of throne on it.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Describe the throne to me.
> 
> **D-3462:** It's different. Everything else here is some sci-fi shit, but this- this is like a medieval throne. All metal, too, gold and steel, with really detailed carvings. They're too worn for me to make out, though.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Anything else?
> 
> **D-3462:** Yeah. It's covered in dust. I don't think anyone's been here in a long time.
> 
> **Unknown Voice:** You are, of course, correct.
> 
> **D-3462:** Woah! Don't jump up on me like that.
> 
> **Unknown Voice:** My apologies.
> 
> **D-3462:** Who are you?
> 
> **Unknown Voice:** I am the Regent.
> 
> **D-3462:** I asked for a name, not a title.
> 
> **Regent:** And I gave you one. I have no name but my title.
> 
> **D-3462:** Is this your throne?
> 
> **Regent:** No. It isn't. But I am... in charge of its care.
> 
> **D-3462:** Oh, I see. You're like... a housesitter.
> 
> **Regent:** If you like.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Wait. D-3462. This Regent surprised you, yes?
> 
> **D-3462:** Yeah.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** So you didn't touch it.
> 
> **D-3462:** I- no, I didn't.
> 
> **Regent:** Am I interrupting you?
> 
> **D-3462:** I didn't touch you. How come you can see me?
> 
> **Regent:** Ah. Figured that one out, have you?
> 
> **D-3462:** Yeah. So what gives?
> 
> **Regent:** The... people here operate on a different wavelength to you. A side effect of the wrong that was done. Me, on the other hand...
> 
> **D-3462:** You're real. Not a construct.
> 
> **Regent:** Well, that's a matter of debate. I am most certainly a construct - but the circumstances of my construction were different. He made the others - but I made him, so to speak.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Interesting. Is 'he' Prester John, I wonder?
> 
> **Regent:** Yes, he is. Or was, anyway.
> 
> **D-3462:** Wait. I didn't-
> 
> **Regent:** Surprised I can hear you, Doctor Blackburn?
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** That's-
> 
> **Regent:** Not possible? Please. You have no idea what we can do here. The Presbyterate's science is thousands of years ahead of yours.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** The Presbyterate is a constructed world. A sham. 
> 
> **Regent:** A lie, yes. But believing a lie is the first step to making it true. As fascinating as this is, however, you are not the one I'm here to talk to. Steve?
> 
> **D-3462:** Yeah? 
> 
> **Regent:** These people have been trapped here for centuries, since the last Emperor sealed this realm away. In order to return to the real world, I- //we// need a link. Someone to lead us into the new world. 
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** D-3462, return to the portal.
> 
> **Regent:** Steve, think carefully. The Throne is empty. You could use the Presbyterate's might and knowledge. Remake the world. Bring an end to war, an end to poverty -
> 
> **D-3462:** Your technology is incredible. But the portal is right there. Why can't you just walk through?
> 
> **Regent:** The mind of an outsider can shape us. Give us form in your world. 
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** D-3462, you cannot trust this thing. Get back through the portal, now!
> 
> **Regent:** Doctor, please stop interrupting Steve and I. Although, you don't know him as that, do you? Just a number. Just a disposable piece in your game. Anything to protect the world.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Get through the portal, D-3462. That is an order.
> 
> **D-3462:** What would I need to do?
> 
> **Regent:** Without the Key, only a few could go through. But that would be enough to take it. And from there, the Presbyterate can rise again. Through your faith, the Kingdom shall come.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** No! Don't do-
> 
> **Regent:** I warned you, Doctor. I've disabled your audio input. You can hear us still, but you can't keep commanding Steve like this. He is his own man, Doctor.
> 
> **D-3462:** How- how do I do it?
> 
> **Regent:** Just take my hand.
> 
> **D-3462:** I don't know. I mean, the Doc's never steered me wrong so far. And the Foundation might use me for tests, but they saved me from the death penalty. And, I mean, some of the stuff you guys do here is just- well, barbaric. I mean, the Order of the Flame-
> 
> **Regent:** Don't like the world as it is, Steve? Change it. You can have Solome and all her ilk destroyed if you wish. The power, as it were, is yours.
> 
> **D-3462:** I-
> 
> **Regent:** After this exchange, they will kill you. Disobedient D-Class are a liability to the Foundation. Anything for their 'greater good'. But with all the miracles they have locked up, never once do they help the world. Take my hand, Steve. Show the world that you are not powerless.
> 
> **D-3462:** I- Okay.
> 
> **Regent:** Excellent.

> We are routed. The Seljuks have shattered our men, driving us far and apart. I am the only Englishman I have seen in days now, and my food and water are exhausted.
> 
> I have sheltered in some ancient Moslem shrine. Here, at least, I may spend my final days in solace, and contemplation of the Lord.

> It has been a good life - but yet, I wish only to look on the shores of my home again, rather than perish on the sands of this bitter land.

> 
> A bitter irony - this is the treasure trove of some long dead Arab king, perhaps. Gold and jewels stacked to the ceiling in the lower chambers - yet it matters not. By now, I am too weak to travel onwards. Should I take but a portion of this wealth, I would be as rich as a king - but I will die here, as poor as a beggar.
> 
> One item, though, has caught my eye. An emerald scepter- truly a beautiful treasure. When I gripped it, it was as though I saw G-d Himself looking at me in solemn approval. I know that I can go to my grave in peace now - for Paradise awaits me as a true servant of the Lord.
> 
> But yet- I cannot help but think of the scepter. The way the Lord stared down at me - as if He wanted me to do something. I have wandered this treasure chamber for hours now, seeking what I am meant to find.

> 
> My Regent tells me how we can enter the true world. I have made preparations - the Kingdom of Heaven shall come to Earth.

> I have built a civilisation here. My Keepers guard the realm from threats both without and within - and the sages from the Order of the Star tell me that they are working on great machines, things that can do the work of a hundred men. Truly, I have made paradise.
> 
> The scepter - Regent calls it the Key - shall bring my Kingdom - nay, my Empire - into the world. Soon, the kingdoms of Asia and India, Africa and Arabia, Europe and the untouched lands over the sea - all will know God.

> It will take decades - perhaps even centuries. But here, we are beyond Time.

> **The Journal of Father John Clarke - May Fifteenth, Year of Our Lord 1271**
> 
> The way is open at last. The Gates are open - three of them. At my Court's advice, I have had them placed far and wide across the world - one in the tomb of the fallen Arab king, one in the vast steppes of Asia - and one in the deep and unknown reaches of Africa. We have fought Mongol hordes and Indian princes - but none can stand against the Empire. The people have tried to call me Emperor, but I refuse. This land shall have no master but God.
> 
> In lieu of an Emperor, they have started with a new title. Prester John, they call me. A simple title - but I am a simple man, despite the vast wealth I have been ordained with.
> 
> Now the Kingdom is returned. I will write missives to the kings of Europe, Asia, and Africa. All will know that God's chosen are here - and all the world will be united.

> Yet, I fear stagnation. The nature of my realm makes expanding the borders difficult. Still, the Court pushes for it.--My-- God's light must reach every corner of Christendom before the end can begin.

> Isn't it funny, how this all began? With a foolish old man dying in the desert - and now it lead to this. The mightiest empire the world has ever seen. We are not, of course, invulnerable.

> We have accomplished much. But with this? This is what I have been missing. This is what will help me fulfill my duty. This is what will help me establish the Kingdom of God on Earth.

> I find myself troubled, of late. Regent offers fewer and fewer answers. Holding my scepter - the Key - gives me some small comfort, at least. A reminder of that long-ago vision - that I am blessed. I am chosen. I am Presbyter Johannes of the Eternal Empire, the Presbyterate, the Kingdom of God - and I will bring my Kingdom to the world by peace or by the sword.

> 
> 
> **Note:** The following footage was recovered from Site-103's cameras prior to the containment breach.
> 
> //SCP-4214-B's containment chamber. The archway is active. Dr. Blackburn is calling security to the chamber.//
> 
> //D-3462 emerges from the portal. On-site security aim their weapons at him.//
> 
> **D-3462:** Don't shoot! Listen to me! We need to shut this thing down, now!
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** And we should listen to you why? You did this!
> 
> **D-3462:** If we don't close this gate, we're all dead! Please, Doc! Now!
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Technician! Get 4214-A out of here!
> 
> //The technician holding SCP-4214-A gasps, falling to her knees.//
> 
> **Technician:** And through my faith... The Kingdom comes...
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Security! 
> 
> //One of the security guards grabs SCP-4214-A from the technician.//
> 
> **Technician:** No! No, no, no, it's mine! The-
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Shoot him!
> 
> //Another guard shoots the technician three times in the chest.//
> 
> **Guard:** I got it ma'am. I-I-
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Get it away from the gate! 
> 
> //A figure in heavy armor emerges from SCP-4214-B. Based on D-3462's descriptions, it is recognisable as a Keeper of the Shield. The Keeper lifts its weapon and fires at one of the guards. The guard collapses instantly. The security forces fire back to little effect. Three more Keepers emerge from the portal.//
> 
> **D-3462:** Doc! Get down!
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** If we close the gate now, we can deal with the four of-
> 
> **D-3462:** You have no idea what this is, do you? It's not a nation. It's not a world. It's not a people. Everything - the scepter, the gate, the people massacring your guards - it's all-
> 
> //One of the Keepers fires. Dr. Blackburn pulls D-3462 out of the way.//
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** You! Get that fucking scepter out of here!
> 
> **Guard:** And- and- and through my faith-
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Damn it, no!
> 
> //D-3462 runs out from cover. A Keeper fires at him and misses. It is hit in the head by a shot from on-site security and falls. Two more exit the portal. D-3462 punches the guard in the face, grabbing SCP-4214 from his arms.//
> 
> **D-3462:** Run!
> 
> //Dr. Blackburn and D-3462 flee the chamber. Even after taking SCP-4214-A out of the chamber, SCP-4214-B remains open. The green light has faded to a deep violet. A black liquid begins to flow out across the chamber floor.//
> 
> //In the corridor, D-3462 and Dr. Blackburn flee through the contamination airlock. Dr. Blackburn hits a button, sealing the door.//
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** There. That should keep them in.
> 
> **D-3462:** You have no idea what we're dealing with. We need to get this scepter as far away from here as possible.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Look. I'm in command here. We need to call this breach in immediately. Supervisor Adams? Come in.
> 
> //Radio chatter.//
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** The Supervisor's radioed for help. MTF Epsilon-11 should be here soon. Worst comes to worst, the base's on-site warheads are primed.
> 
> **D-3462:** It won't stop it. Everything you're trying now? They tried that.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Wh- Oh my God.
> 
> //The black liquid is flowing down the corridor towards the airlock. As it reaches it, the liquid rises up, pressing against the glass.//
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** How did- the portal should be closed!
> 
> **D-3462:** Too late. Too late. Too late.
> 
> //Strands of black liquid begin emerging from the airlock door towards Dr. Blackburn and D-3462. They fuse together - first into an arm, then a head and torso. The face quickly forms into that of an elderly man - bald with a white beard.//
> 
> **D-3462:** Regent. That's him.
> 
> //Regent steps forward from the airlock. The black liquid forms into flesh - then clothing. He grins, stepping forward.//
> 
> **Regent:** Too late. Here now. So many minds. So much-
> 
> //Dr. Blackburn draws a pistol from beneath her lab coat. She shoots Regent three times in the chest, then once in the head. His body falls into the black liquid. It seeps over him, plugging up the bullet holes. Slowly, he gets to his feet, grinning. D-3462 and Dr. Blackburn run down the corridor. The black liquid flows along the floor after them. Regent follows.//
> 
> **Alarm:** Alert. Alert. SCP-4214 has breached containment. All personnel to emergency positions. Repeat. SCP-4214 has breached containment-
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** What did you mean? "That's what they tried"? Who?
> 
> **D-3462:** That place, the 'Presbyterate'? 
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** What about it?
> 
> **D-3462:** It was a world once. Like ours. But they invited that thing in. It destroyed them, and built a bridge to our world. If we don't stop it here-
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** SCP-4214-B. If we destroy that-
> 
> **D-3462:** A start. Then we need to hide the Key. Then- well, there's another step.
> 
> //Gunshots. Screams. Black liquid drips from the ceiling and begins to rise, forming the shape of an armoured Keeper. D-3462 and Dr. Blackburn turn, running to the left.//
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** You know about SCP-4214-A. Would a nuclear blast destroy it?
> 
> **D-3462:** I don't know. Even if it didn't-
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** It would be buried under tons of rubble.
> 
> **D-3462:** Do you have permission to set off the nukes?
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** I'll radio Supervisor Adams. Adams? It's Jess. We need to set off the nukes. D-3462 tells me- he knows it, all right? He's the best chance we have. He- All right. Sound the evacuation. We'll distract SCP-4214.
> 
> **Alarm:** Alert. Alert. Nuclear detonation sequence is now engaged. All personnel to evacuation points immediately. Detonation in 10 minutes. Message repeat.
> 
> //Dr. Blackburn and D-3462 enter a large office room. There are several desks with computers and a stairwell in the far corner. D-3462 points at the stairwell.//
> 
> **D-3462:** Down here!
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** That leads us closer to the reactor. We- fuck.
> 
> **D-3462:** How? How did it-
> 
> //Black liquid rises from the stairwell, spilling onto the floor. The armoured Keepers block the passage back.//
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Nowhere to go. Adams? Accelerate the countdown. We're trapped.
> 
> **Intercom:** This is Supervisor Adams. SCP-4214 has breached my office. I- I don't see a way out.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** No...
> 
> **Supervisor Adams:** Jess- I'm transferring my control codes to you. You've studied this thing, and I pray you know how to stop it. Contain it. Anything. I-
> 
> //The intercom cuts out. The black liquid is rising now, forming walls around Dr. Blackburn and D-3462. From the wall, a humanoid figure emerges. Its face is shifting, changing. It settles, eventually, as Regent.//
> 
> **Regent:** Steve. And Jessica. Trapped here. Alone. So... desperate. So //hungry//.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** I know what you are.
> 
> //Its face changes again, becoming Alannya.//
> 
> **Alannya:** No. You don't.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** An extradimensional entity. Something from outside our universe. But you figured out a way into worlds, places full of life. A bridge. 
> 
> **D-3-462:** No, no, no, no. Stop! We're dead, we're dead, we're dead...
> 
> //It changes again, shifting faster and faster between faces.//
> 
> **Yemane:** Clever girl.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Faith. That's it, isn't it? That's your little secret. You send through a probe of some kind - the scepter. It latches on to faith. Corrupts it. Binds it to you. You reward people with their own world, their own universe - and make them bring you through.
> 
> **Cuathis:** Oh, you are such a bright species. So full of colour. So //alive.//
> 
> **Solome:** You needn't be afraid, you know.
> 
> **Kiros:** I will take you in. You will live on forever and ever and ever. 
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Maybe. But I know something else, too. The scepter is a link - but not strong enough to bring you through.
> 
> **D-3462:** We can't stop it, Doc. Just- just give in.
> 
> **Zelal:** Go on, Doctor. I am oh- so, so very //intrigued.// You have such a mind, sharp like glass - and fragile. You will make a fine part of me.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** You needed a conduit. A person. I'm guessing Prester John was the first - and then after that, the realm was sealed. 
> 
> **Regent:** Oh, yes. Locked away, devouring memories of myself. But now I have a new world to play with.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** And then someone else entered. Your new conduit. D-3462. He wasn't religious, which is why it took so long - but he had faith. Faith in the future. In your incredible technology. Faith that you took and you twisted and you made into a gateway for yourself. Because that's what you do, you extradimensional leech. All you do. You take people and you use them to consume worlds. Well, not this time. Not my world.
> 
> **D-3462:** Wasn't my fault. It wasn't my fault!
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** D- Steve?
> 
> **D-3462:** Yes?
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Sorry.
> 
> //Dr. Blackburn shoots D-3462 in the head. He falls, head splashing the black liquid.//
> 
> //Silence.//
> 
> //SCP-4214 laughs. As it does, the video distorts and the audio cuts out entirely for 1.2 seconds. The black liquid shakes. Dr. Blackburn fires five more shots into D-3462's body. She falls to her knees. Tendrils reach out, pulling D-3462 into the wall.//
> 
> **Regent:** A good effort, child.
> 
> **Alannya:** A clever plan - kill the link and the portal is broken. I go back to that empty, lifeless void.
> 
> **Yemane:** But if there's one thing the good Prester taught me, one thing I learned from your kind.
> 
> //The entity's face changes again.//
> 
> **D-3462:** I always have a backup plan.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** How? How can you-
> 
> **D-3462:** He was a fine link. Filled with faith in the bright, shining future for tomorrow. But there are dozens like him. Hundreds. But //you//...
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** You need faith. I- I'm a scientist. I believe in the observable. The explainable. I don't have faith for you to-
> 
> **D-3462:** Oh, Jessica. Poor, poor child. It's all right, you know. You can let go of this. Of course you have faith.
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** F-faith in what?
> 
> **D-3462:** That no matter how strange the world is, humanity will triumph. Over all the monsters, you can emerge victorious.
> 
>  **Dr. Blackburn:** No. Please, I...
> 
> **D-3462:** You can Secure.
> 
> //The entity's face shifts again.//
> 
> **Supervisor Adams:** Contain.
> 
> //The entity's face shifts faster now, so quickly the individual faces are unrecognisable. Its voice deepens and its body fades back into the black liquid.//
> 
> **SCP-4214: Protect.**
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** I- it's not like that!
> 
> **SCP-4214: You die in the darkness so they can live in the light.**
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** If I'm the link-
> 
> //Dr. Blackburn raises her gun to her own head. Before she can pull the trigger, SCP-4214's hand extends into a black tendril, spearing through the weapon. The black liquid trembles. She dives for the gun. The tendril splits in two, one end hitting Dr. Blackburn in the stomach. She is thrown across the room and into a bank of computers. She lies still.//
> 
> **SCP-4214: You will lead us. You will //be// us.**
> 
> //Dr. Blackburn laughs.//
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** I can feel you. Reaching inside me. How long before I end up like them?
> 
> **SCP-4214: A long time. You will be a worthy link.**
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Even after all this time, you still underestimate humans. Hundreds of years trying to break through, God only knows how long breaking through other worlds - but you still don't understand people. You never will.
> 
> **SCP-4214: But of course I do, child. I understand you better than you understand yourself.**
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Still talking. Never seeing.
> 
> **SCP-4214: Seeing what, Jessica?**
> 
> //Black tendrils extend from the walls, impaling Dr. Blackburn. She gasps as they lift her off the ground. Blood drips onto the floor.//
> 
> **SCP-4214: Let's accelerate this a little. Embrace it. Join me. Have //faith.//**
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** You- you never saw... 
> 
> **SCP-4214: Go on. Entertain us.**
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** Y-you...
> 
> //SCP-4214 tilts its head to one side.//
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** S-Supervisor Adams gave me his control codes. That- that's control over everything in this facility. Including the countdown on the warheads. And you just threw me into a security terminal, you son of a bitch.
> 
> //The tendrils pulse. Dr. Blackburn falls.//
> 
> **Alarm:** Alert. Alert. Nuclear detonation in 10...
> 
> //Dr. Blackburn gets to her feet. She moves over to the computer.//
> 
> **Alarm:** 9... 8...
> 
> //Dr. Blackburn types frantically.//
> 
> **Alarm:** 7... 6... 5...
> 
> //Dr. Blackburn tilts her head back and screams. The black liquid shakes furiously. Video contact is lost for 1 second.//
> 
> **Alarm:** 3...
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** And through my faith...
> 
> **Alarm:** 2...
> 
> **Dr. Blackburn:** The Kingdom comes...
> 
> **Alarm:** 1....
> 
> //Dr. Blackburn steps into the black liquid.//
> 
> **Alarm:** 0.
> 
> //The on-site warhead is detonated. This footage, along with the documentation you are currently reading, was transmitted to O5 Command as the warhead detonated. The energy signature linked to SCP-4214-A was detected from 5.6 kilometers beneath the rubble, but excavation has been delayed by executive override. SCP-4214-B appears to have been destroyed in the blast. Of the SCP-4214 entity, no trace was found. Upon transmission, the document appears to have been annotated by Dr. Blackburn. The description seems to imply that the entity was not fully neutralised. The final annotation was sent with the footage and is enclosed below.//
> 

> //So now you see, yes? What happened? Good. We let it in. It held us close and ate us, and we let it. But it's clear now. I was wrong. I was wrong to destroy the Gate - though We will find a new one soon. 
> We don't have to be enemies, you know. It wants to help us, to experience the joy of faith through us - and we can help you. Secure, Contain, Protect. We can do this. We can help you. We can be allies.
