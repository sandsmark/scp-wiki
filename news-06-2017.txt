* [[[https://www.djkakt.us/kaktuskast |The KaktusKast]]] returns in a big way, with a new website and a new podcast format!

* Accompanying the KaktusKast is a brand new podcast called [[[https://www.djkakt.us/the-foundation/ |The Foundation]]], hosted by [[*user Doctor Cimmerian]], where he sits down and discusses and dissects the lore of the SCP Foundation and what makes its elements so compelling.

Thanks for tuning in again, folks! If you're unsatisfied with the blurb(s) provided for the article(s) you wrote, feel free to change it. Of course, you could just avoid that problem entirely by sending [[*user A Random Day]] a blurb for your article. We may or may not use it (if we can think of something more attention-getting, though we can try to stick with one you give us) but we'd really would just like them in order to make the process easier for making these. This is a community thing, and we want authors to give their blurbs to sell these articles much easier. It reduces the workload we have to do, and helps the news come out that much earlier!
