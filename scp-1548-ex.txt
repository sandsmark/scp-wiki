**Item #:** SCP-1548-EX

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Space observatories capable of observing SCP-1548 are to be restricted from doing so. Images and readings taken of SCP-1548 are to be kept private and under the sole control of the Foundation.

Should usage of existing observatories be necessary, they will be temporarily put under the control of the Foundation.

Research into methods of neutralizing SCP-1548 are currently on going. Upon the completion of Lunar Area-32 (Projected date: 1959), primary research into how SCP-1548 operates and possible methods of termination are to be relocated there.


**Description:** SCP-1548 is an unidentified object, approximately 24 light years away from Earth. The object, originally thought to be a star, is significantly brighter than any recorded so far and periodically emits bursts of ionizing radiation. 

Initially discovered in 1949 at the Yerkes' Observatory in Chicago, Illinois, Agent M███████ noticed that many of the pulses recorded formed a morse code. The first transcribed read "Death for the undsrving[//sic//]." All messages received so far have all been aggressive, involving the death, destruction, and humiliation of the human race. 

Readings and measurements of the object has shown it to be incredibly unstable. SCP-1548 possess an axis, where two twin streams of radiation are emitted. The radiation from these streams are much more concentrated than the radiation emitted throughout the rest of SCP-1548. This axis is very unstable, with their orientation changing at any given moment with little perceived order. It is therefore theorized that the object is spinning at high and random speeds.

The messages SCP-1548 sends out are incredibly random. While multiple distinct messages have been recorded, these pulses account for <1% of the total pulses emitted by SCP-1548. No distinct pattern has been discovered for when SCP-1548 is simply pulsing at random and when it is attempting to communicate.

**Addendum.1 — Observations by Head Researcher Natalie:** 

> Upon the completion and population of Foundation Lunar Area-32, my team has performed more detailed measurements of SCP-1548. 
> 
> These measurements indicate that SCP-1548 poses a large and immediate threat to the planet. Due to the proximity and intensity of the bursts, should either of the streams happen to be pointed directly at us during a burst, the radiation would possess enough energy to make it past the heliosphere and subsequently devastate components of our planet's atmosphere, namely the Ozone and magnetic sphere. 
> 
> All life on earth (which includes us) would be completely at the mercy of any and all ionization radiation from both space and the sun.
> 
> Currently estimates indicate that such an event would result in a total collapse of most of Earth's ecosystems. I doubt we would fare much better.
> 
> As such, I am submitting a request for more funding to better understand, and hopefully, eventually terminate SCP-1548.

> The good news is that SCP-1548 is non-anomalous. 
> Science has caught up to us and revealed a name for these curious objects: pulsars. It seems there are millions of these things running around the abyss.
> Furthermore, the messages received, the ones we thought were SCP-1548 speaking to us, were just a fluke-one of cosmic proportions. SCP-1548 is not malicious, nor even sentient. It hasn't "spoken" in over 20 years, and the last messages received have been barely comprehensible.
> 
> The bad news is that, while the star doesn't hate us, god (or whoever put that pulsar 24 light years away from us) certainly does. 
> 
> Researcher Natalie came to me with these concerns and made the proposal to reclassify SCP-1548 as -EX herself.  I've made the decision to accept her proposal.
