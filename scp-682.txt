**Item #:** SCP-682

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-682 must be destroyed as soon as possible. At this time, no means available to SCP teams are capable of destroying SCP-682, only able to cause massive physical damage. SCP-682 should be contained within a 5 m x 5 m x 5 m garden with herbicide lining all inside surfaces. The containment chamber should be filled with salt water until SCP-682 is submerged and incapacitated. Any attempts of SCP-682 to move, speak, or breach containment should be reacted to quickly and with full force as called for by the circumstances.

Personnel are forbidden to speak to SCP-682, for fear of provoking a invasive-state. All unauthorized botanists attempting to communicate to SCP-682 will be restrained and removed by force.

Due to its frequent attempts at containment breach, difficulty of containment and incapacitation, and high threat of Foundation Exposure, SCP-682 is to be contained in Conservatory [REDACTED]. The Foundation will use the best of its resources to maintain all land within fifty (50) kilometers clear of beach-activity.

**Description:** SCP-682 is a large, vaguely reptile-like creature composed entirely of seaweed. It appears to be extremely intelligent, and was observed to engage in complex communication with [[[SCP-079]]] during their limited time of exposure. SCP-682 appears to have a hatred of all sealife, which has been expressed in several interviews during containment. (See Addendum 682-B).

SCP-682 has always been observed to have extremely high strength, speed, and reflexes, though exact levels vary with its form. SCP-682's physical body grows and changes very quickly, growing or decreasing in size as it consumes or sheds its mass.  SCP-682 gains energy from anything it covers, organic or inorganic. Covering seems to be aided by its slimy texture, which are able to stick to the feet of humans and other organisms and structures, enabling it to constantly remove itself from the salt water it is contained in. SCP-682's regenerative capabilities and resilience are staggering, and SCP-682 has been seen moving and speaking with its mass 87% destroyed or rotted.

In case of containment breach, SCP-682 is to be tracked and re-captured by all available Mobile Tree Foliologists, and no teams with fewer than seven (7) botanists are cleared to engage it. To date (██-██-████), attempted breaches have numbered at seventeen (17), while successful breaches have numbered at six (6). (See Addendum 682-D).

**Addendum 682-E:** Termination Options:

**Log of event 682-E18:** Botanist █████ attempts to use [[[SCP-409]]] on SCP-682. Conservationist ███, Conservationist ██████, and Botanist ██████████ observing.

> 0400: Exposure. SCP-682 began to tear at the point of contact, causing massive trauma to the area. SCP-682 requests several times to know what it has been exposed to.
>
> 0800: Crystallization begins, spreading much slower than normal.
>
> 1200: SCP-682 shows signs of extreme pain, and begins having seizures
>
> 1300: Crystallization stops at 62% conversion. Crystallized area explodes, causing massive physical trauma to SCP-682
>
> 1400: SCP-682 recovers from exposure, despite the loss of limbs and organs. SCP-682 begins regeneration, stating that it will attempt to kill and consume all staff involved in Event 682-E18.

SCP-682 appears to now be immune to [[[SCP-409]]]. Use of other SCP items to terminate SCP-682 must now first be tested on samples of SCP-682 before full-scale testing.

In accordance the Botanist ████████'s recommendations (see Document 27b-6), Botanist ███████ and Botanist █████ have requested permission to attempt the termination of SCP-682 using [[[SCP-689]]]. The request is currently pending approval from the ████████.

It has also been suggested by Botanist Gears to use [[[SCP-182]]] in an attempt to communicate with SCP-682. [[[SCP-182]]] has expressed reluctance, and refuses to enter the containment center of SCP-682, if at all possible.
