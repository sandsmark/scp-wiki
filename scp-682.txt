title:Scp 682
**Item #:** SCP-682 

**Object Class:** Keter 

**Special Containment Procedures:** 

SCP-682 must be destroyed as soon as possible. At this time, no means available to SCP teams are capable of destroying SCP-682, only able to cause massive physical damage. Containment of SCP-682 is to be made on-site whenever contact is made. Containment will consist of ten inch reinforced acid-resistant steel plate forming the walls, ceiling and floor of SCP-682's containment chamber. Containment chamber will then be filled with hydrochloric acid until SCP-682 becomes incapacitated. SCP crew will attempt to transport SCP-682 to central facility as soon as physically possible. 

Any personnel attempting to speak to SCP-682 will be restrained and removed by force. Any movement or attempt to escape, move, or speak by SCP-682 will be addressed by full use of force by SCP team, by whatever means available and necessary. 

**Description:** 

SCP-682 is a large, vaguely reptile-like creature of unknown origin. It appears to be extremely intelligent, and was observed to engage in complex communication with [[[SCP-079]]] during its limited time of capture. Its physical body grows and changes very quickly, observed to be able to increase by one square foot of mass after consuming enough material. Digestion seems to be aided by a set of filtering gills inside of SCP-682's nostrils, which are able to remove organic and digestible matter from a liquid solution, thus it is able to constantly regenerate itself from the acid it is contained in. 

SCP-682 has been observed to have extremely high strength, speed, and agility when compared to a standard SCP agent. In case of containment breach, SCP-682 is to be tracked and re-captured by an authorized SCP team consisting of no less than seven members. While SCP-682 is a deadly creature when loose, the main threat comes from public knowledge of SCP through SCP-682. To date (██-██-████), attempted breaches have numbered at seventeen (17), while successful breaches have numbered at six (6). (See Addendum 682-D). 

SCP-682 appears to have a hatred of all life, which has been expressed in several interviews during containment. (See Addendum 682-B). SCP-682 gains energy from anything it ingests, organic or inorganic. SCP-682's regenerative capabilities are staggering, and SCP-682 has been seen moving and speaking with it's body 87% destroyed or rotted.

**SCP-682:** (Appearing to assault D-085's body) ...they were... disgusting...

**Addendum 682-E:** Termination Options: 

**Log of event 682-E18:** Dr. █████ attempts to use [[[SCP-409]]] on SCP-682. General ███, General ██████, and Dr. ██████████ observing. 

0400: Exposure. SCP-682 began to tear at the point of contact, causing massive trauma to the area. SCP-682 requests several times to know what it has been exposed to. 

0800: Crystallization begins, spreading much slower than normal. 

1200: SCP-682 shows signs of extreme pain, and begins having seizures 

1300: Crystallization stops at 62% conversion. Crystallized area explodes, causing massive physical trauma to SCP-682 

1400: SCP-682 recovers from exposure, despite the loss of limbs and organs. SCP-682 begins regeneration, stating that it will attempt to terminate and consume all staff involved in Event 682-E18. 

SCP-682 appears to now be immune to [[[SCP-409]]]. Use of other SCP items to terminate SCP-682 must now first be tested on samples of SCP-682 before full-scale testing. 


In accordance the Dr. ████████'s recommendations (see Document 27b-6), doctors ████████ and █████ have requested permission to attempt the termination of SCP-682 using SCP-689. The request is currently pending approval from the ████████. 

It has also been suggested by Dr. Gears to use [[[SCP-182]]] in an attempt to communicate with SCP-682. [[[SCP-182]]] has expressed reluctancy, and refuses to enter the containment center of SCP-682, if at all possible.
