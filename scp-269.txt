**Item #:** SCP-269

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP-269 is to be locked in a lead-lined box measuring no less than 20cm by 20cm by 20cm, and stored in a secure locker at Site ██. Experimentation on SCP-269 may only be performed on Class D personnel, and only with approval from Level 4 personnel.

**Description:**

SCP-269 is a plain bracelet composed of red jade, approximately 11cm in diameter. Personnel observing SCP-269 have expressed interest in, and an urge to wear the item. If SCP-269 is not worn for a long period of time, it becomes increasingly alluring to the point of becoming a memetic hazard. Changes observed thus far include increased gloss, curious inscriptions or engravings, and [DATA EXPUNGED]. All attempts to damage or destroy SCP-269 have failed thus far.

When SCP-269 is worn by a living human host, SCP-269 contracts to fit tightly, but comfortably around the wrist. At this point, SCP-269 can still be removed from the host via amputation of the affected hand.

Within 12 hours, SCP-269 will begin to warm until it matches the body temperature of its host. Within 24 hours, SCP-269 will begin to integrate with its host's circulatory system through the ulnar and radial arteries. At this point, SCP-269 cannot be removed from its host without severe physical trauma.

When SCP-269 is fully integrated, it will begin to filter substances from its host's bloodstream. How this is done is not fully understood, but the process occurs over three stages:

In the first stage, SCP-269 will filter contaminants and infectious agents, including many that are currently incurable, such as HIV. In most cases, this process will increase the health of the host, and thus the host will resist attempts to have SCP-269 removed. This stage typically lasts anywhere from one week to one month.

In the second stage, SCP-269 will begin filtering components of the host's immune system from the bloodstream. Because SCP-269 continues to filter infectious agents from the host's body, this is generally unnoticed without extensive blood analysis. Stage 2 lasts anywhere from one month to six months.

In the final stage, SCP-269 will begin to filter vital blood components, such as red blood cells and platelets, causing acute anemia and hemophilia. Hosts that reach Stage 3 invariably die within one week without massive blood transfusions.

Investigation into how SCP-269 functions, as well as its memetic properties and possible methods of destruction are ongoing.

**Addendum 269-1:**

After over twenty (20) months in containment without a host, SCP-269 began to emit strong radiation and heat. Within 48 hours, SCP-269 began to [DATA EXPUNGED]. During an attempt to evacuate SCP-269, Dr. █████ observed SCP-269 directly and placed SCP-269 onto his wrist. SCP-269 immediately stopped emitting radiation and heat and returned to its plain state. Eleven (11) casualties were recorded as a result of [DATA EXPUNGED].


**Addendum 269-2:**

Due to the findings of the report on SCP-269 dated █/██/20██, one Class D personnel must be selected as a host for SCP-269 once every twelve (12) months. Mandatory monthly termination for SCP-269's host is suspended until host dies from SCP-269.
