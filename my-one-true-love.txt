Clenching on to his face.
Watching the grey take over his eyes.
Hearing no sound in his heart.
My vivid nightmare. 

Waking in sweat, cold as snow.
Tears run down my face.
Scared to look at my lover.
In fear of seeing crimson. 

A glance over my shoulder.
Hearing the calmness in his breathing.
Resting besides his warmths.
Returning to the realm of the endless.

Sweat atop my forehead.
Crying out with tears.
Unable to get the proper rest.
My dreams haunted by a river of red. 

Feeling the touch of his hand.
Returning to a state of calm.
Seeing the smile on his lips.
All was good in my world.


Returning to our occupation.
Heading towards the Site.
Ash smothers out the sun.
The sounds of war nearby.

We hurried towards the battle field.
I wanted us to turn around.
Feeling my dreams come true.
Staring at my nightmare.

Retrieving our weapons from the car.
I feared today would be my last day.
Yet, we both ran.


Rushing towards the Site.
Providing aid to our co-workers.
Fighting back our common enemy.
Watching as they withdraw.

I showed the world my smile.
My deepest fear, my dreams.
Nothing but lies to kill my spirit.
Standing beside him, seeing he was safe.
My heart filled with warmths.

Hearing the miseries of a friend.
Watching as she knelt beside her lover.
Clenching on to his face.
She screamed till her throat broke.

Watching the grey take over his eyes.
Hearing no sound in his heart.
My vivid nightmare. 
Now her reality.
