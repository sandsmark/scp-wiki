**Item #:** SCP-067

**Object Class:** safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** When not being used or researched, SCP-067 is to be stored in its felt lined wooden box. The nib is to be corked and all art and writings are to be submitted to SCP Research command for analysis and further experimentation.

**Description:** SCP-067 is a interim World War fountain pen made by a German supply company called Pelikan. It is pale green in color, with a single red line going straight down along the side. The shell is oak and the nib is extremely sharp and capable of piercing human skin if pressed, even lightly. Though it lacks a characteristic reservoir, the nib never appears to run out of fresh ink. In addition, the pen writes in Iron Gall ink, which is suitable for artists but would normally corrode typical fountain pens quickly.

Research has surmised that any subject holding SCP-067 loses all autonomy of the hand and arm that grasps it. Full sensation is intact, but the arm below the elbow is controlled by unknown forces, theoretically centralized within SCP-067. One effect is that the "controlled" hand will start to use the pen to write a detailed biography of the individual holding the pen. The biography will include such information as the person's name, age, date of birth, criminal record, fears, etc. Other times the pen has been known to write such things as an occurrence that happened in the person's lifetime. For example: When Test Subject-1204M held the pen and began to write a detailed record of a motor vehicle accident he had been in the year before. Later, the subject admitted that many details penned in the biography were not readily available to him at present time (i.e. the subject had forgot many memories, including his previous car's license plate number, the other vehicle's color and so on). The subject stated that his memory of the event was so fresh in his mind during the transcription that he "could taste the blood in his mouth."

Subjects holding SCP-067 have also been known to create intricate works of art, despite the subject never having any formal art training or previous tendencies toward drawing. For example; Test Subject-1102F, a young woman with no previous artistic experience, was able to draw a winged creature, characteristically resembling [[[SCP-086]]] described by present researchers as [DATA EXPUNGED]. When subjects are asked to explain what happens when they hold SCP-067, the typical response is that the subject freely relinquishes control of their appendage to SCP-067 so that it may complete its work unheeded (see Quoted Response-01). Despite being instructed to not draw or write, subjects describe a feelings of empathy, admiration and cooperation with SCP-067 that coerces them toward a will not their own.

**Quoted Response-01:** "I don't really know how to explain it, it just kind of happened. When I picked up the pen, it seemed as if my hand wasn't my own anymore. I knew I could move it if I wanted to, but I chose not to because I loved the picture I was drawing. It was like my hand had life. Suddenly, my hand stopped and I realized I had complete control over my hand again, and I put the pen back down. I looked at the drawing and saw how beautiful it was. I guess the pen decided it was done, and was finished with me."
