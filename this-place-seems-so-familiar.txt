Neighbors report not seeing anyone enter or leave the house since the caretaker's last visit. Note that the house is not, nor has it ever been, located on an island. The "cliff" described in this account does not exist.//

//The body of a woman identified as Marjory Vinnigio, also listed as missing following the dissappearance of flight ███, was found in the house. Cause of death appears to be multiple gunshot wounds to the head and body.//
