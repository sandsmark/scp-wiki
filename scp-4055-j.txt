**Item #:** SCP-4055-J

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the relatively recent discovery and widespread habitat of SCP-4055-J, full containment is not possible at this time. Domestication attempts are to continue as a Septem-level priority to the Foundation.

**Description:** SCP-4055-J is an extremely hostile breed of dog. Its diet consists of garbage and it has a hairless, prehensile tail. SCP-4055-J instances regard humans with extreme contempt and will violently resist all attempts of domestication. 

When given basic commands of "sit" and "fetch", SCP-4055-J instances will either feign death or attack their master. One specimen, upon hearing the phrase "who's a good boy," proceeded to violently defecate on the floor while foaming at the mouth.

It is believed that a black market ring of dog breeders in association with the Serpent's Hand created SCP-4055-J through the hybridization of a chihuahua and an unknown canid/mollusk entity. The motive for this breed's generation is currently unknown, but is speculated to involve the discouragement of pet ownership as a form of slavery.
