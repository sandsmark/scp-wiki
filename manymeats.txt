[http://scp-wiki.net/scp-4369 <SCP-4369>] -> "Cassandra: Play Your Part"
[[collapsible show="+ Author Commentary" hide="- Close Commentary"]]
Posted 4th January, 2019

This was the first SCP that I ever posted and I cannot tell you the level of relief I felt in having it survive.  I've lurked on SCP for a looong, long time and seen countless new authors endure the downvote firing squad.  I scraped and re-drafted several times but ultimately, while showering one morning, this idea struck me.

Coming together over 7 days of real life time, Cassandra: Play Your Part is my take on the Greek Myth of 'Cassandra'.  Cassandra was the daughter of Priam that //wasn't// Helen of Troy.  Apollo was very keen on her and so he gifted her with a foresight of the future in the hopes she would sleep with him.  She didn't, so bitter Apollo turned this into a curse wherein she kept her gift of prophecy, but no one would ever listen to her.  She was cursed to know what terrible things were coming but to be ignored.  So, she dreamt every night of Troy's impending destruction but was powerless to stop it.

In the same way, this article is constructed around a nameless, faceless radio host who has the power of prophecy to foresee the doom of his small town.  He reaches out, across time and space and reality itself to try to get help but ultimately his echo is powerless.  He can stop nothing.  The only way the Foundation has discovered to make this echo palatable is to stop the prophecy from being discovered.

I am particularly proud of the MTF log on this one.

Posted 13th February, 2019

This was my first "instant success" on just my second article and my first formal attempt at 'cosmic horror' in a format even remotely resembling SCPF.  While far from a huge hit in terms of SCP, this article was one of my most satisfying moments as an author, so to have a risk in style get 'rewarded' like this was a big deal for me.

The concept here was originally to be the footing for a GOI I had hoped to seed.  I was looking to the moon from inspiration but couldn't find anything that really made the moon itself creepy.  Tons of stuff about the moon resulting in creepy or foreboding things like werewolves, and madness, and stuff like that...but the moon itself?  I tried to get at that.

In hindsight, this article somewhat suffers from having a real "punch" at the end but there is sufficient mystery and absence of detail here to at least moderately redeem that lack of big reveal.  It's tough to introduce one thing and then make the article about something else entirely; the monolith has little to do with the 'point' here.  I scrapped lots of material about glyphs and depictions on the stone but ultimately felt more there was less attention everywhere else.

Posted 2nd March, 2019

This was a big mystery for me.  Here I tried to dial up the "wtf" meter a little bit and focus more on some absurdist type horror that I am more comfortable with.  I was inspired by a 'Scion' campaign I am running that involves a cult of actors and producers who want to control the population through media.

I don't want to focus on user feedback as a real metric for any kind of success I feel as an author, but despite critical acclaim for this article it's just never really piled up any number of votes.  The ratio is great, and it was even featured on the "2019 Week 10" episode of Bluesoul's SCP.Cafe podcast!  Unfortunately, due to multiple reasons, this puppy just never seemed to get many eyeballs on it.

Might not be the best place to confess, but I actually wrote this entire article in one sitting over the course of a Sunday afternoon.  It's simply, but it's punchy.  I'm proud of it.

Posted 11th March, 2019

This one came from a conversation with some friends about misheard song lyrics.  I remember bringing up the song 'White Rabbit' and how tons of people I know always recall the hook "feed your head" as "feed your hair" instead.  I had a girlfriend in college who got this wrong repeatedly even after a year and a half of insistence.  Some say this is why we broke up... I'm not one of those 'some people', but some say...

At any rate, the conversation devolved from there thanks to ad lib jokes and here we have this article.  I loved writing it.  My personal motto is "embrace the absurd" and I feel like this is part of my slide further into that.  I started down this road with 4898 and we just...well, we'll wind up //somewhere//.

Posted 25th March, 2019

Hooboy this was a fun one to write.  I've been thinking about the moon for a few months now, trying to weird it up and find creepy things about it.  Long story short, this article is the result of literally a fevered shower thought about 'what if the moon was gray because of bones?' and an extension from that internal dialogue.

While I wound up not going //too far// down that pulpy rabbit hole, I am still very happy with where this line of thinking did take me.  I got a huge big fat help from Ayers on the critical feedback here that helped save me from myself and I think this article worked as well as it did really because of him.

I have a lot of inspiration based on this article.  This was the genesis of my "Ragnar the TechoViking" tales.

Posted 10th April, 2019

This was born at a strange time.  I was at my desk ("working") and eating some fruit and yogurt, and I was just suddenly struck by the thought 'what if birds are screaming'.  It's a notion I've heard before so I won't pretend I invented it, but in that moment I //felt// like I did.  I set to fevered writing and developed a scip draft in about one afternoon.

At the end of the first draft, I had something that substantially more profound and serious in tone than what you see before you today.  It was about birds that screamed like humans as if they were in pain or shrieking in terror.  There was no explanation, just the constant pained screaming of all birds until eventually, a late interview included "memento mori" as a single spoken line.

All in all it was 'okay' and certainly more horror than this borderline -J thing now.  I sat down and exchanged thoughts with UncleNicolini as we traded drafts and he had some nice insights for me.  We talked about my kind of "nevermore" plan for the article and he explained that when he started reading it, he thought I was going to take the mating call route.  Since something like 90% of bird calls all boil down to "hey, fuck me", he thought that was a good place to go.

Not wanting to rip his idea off (at least not entirely) I thought on it for a couple of nights and decided that birds could just be really vulgar instead of this sweet innocent melodic tunes we think we hear.  Then, to circle back into horror elements, wouldn't it really suck to have your memories corrupted by this shit talking birds?  Your peacefully relaxing day on the lake taken away by a retroactive recall of some robin telling you to go fuck yourself...

Anyway, kind of whacky.  That's becoming my thing.

This was inspired by a shower thought but the underlying story made from it is a bit more of a personal one.  I was thinking to myself about causal time loops because of an RPG I am involved in.  In this game, you play "Time cops" who hop around and basically stop other time travelers from ruining things.  It involves a lot of extremely sideways thinking and rapid, unplanned, frequent time traveling in order to setup circumstances for you to combat other time travels.  It's very difficult to explain in practice, but very simple in concept.

So as I was thinking about this, my mind wandered to SCP containing a time loop.  What if it was a time loop they couldn't stop?  How would you contain one indefinitely?  I took that further and imagined a scenario where the time loop contained itself.  Could the Foundation resist being hands off and letting it stay contained?  Even if suffering was involved?

Beneath the surface or story, I also decided to involve the memory of a close personal friend.  While he was obviously not trapped in a time loop, he used to tell me about very vivid dreams he would have where he would meet versions of himself that tried to talk him into doing selfish things, but he always talked them down and stuck to his guns and did what was best for his family.

His lost his battle with Ewing's Sarcoma at a very young age, but the strength with which he faced his journey, put his wife and children first always, and how he went forward with compassion in his heart and an uncrushable strength //in spite of// the impossible situation he faced...

Well, it was tough to deal with.  Still is sometimes.  But it's also a source of great strength and example for me.  So, with him in mind, some small piece of this Scip is in his memory.  Wherever you are, buddy, I hope you know you left a lasting legacy among those who were honored to witness.  Hook em Horns.

Posted 14th May, 2019

As I think I've demonstrated before with articles like "Do You Have What It Takes", I enjoy the premise of powerful people doing somewhat mundane or seemingly mundane things with their nigh-omnipotence.  This is an exercise in that same theme.  A shitty mostly-empty pool in the middle of nowhere and the dude that owns it or cares for it just simply doesn't want any trespassers.  That's it.

People ignore his signs and run from him when he comes out to set them straight, and then the Foundation not only ignores him but keeps ignoring him.  So he uses his inhuman motivations and morality to apply justice and invoke his ruleset.  A dude in a suit with an umbrella walks dozens of miles through the desert, pries his way into a high-security facility, eats volley after volley of bullets, and just pokes one single guy with a cattle prod before leaving.

I like the juxtaposition and the implications of this piece a lot.  Wish it would have caught on a bit better.

Posted 21st June, 2019

This was a somewhat humbling lesson in subtlety.  It started out as an IJAMEA GOI-Format and evolved into a retelling of Yomi.  I wanted the implication to be that Yomi had opened up in order to swallow these war criminals and then it just sort of went away after they were eaten but I think I failed to convey that clearly.

I believe people understood the implication it might be hell or Yomi, but the punch of the end with "Unit 731" what probably too subtle to leave there without any links and lacked some other development.  To that point, there isn't a lot of explanation about the bond of the people involved or why they feel their guilt.  

This is a strong candidate for re-write.

Posted 25th June, 2019

After dumping a lot of time into 4705 to mixed results I was feeling a pretty substantial slide, mentally.  I needed to get back to my roots and sort of reload/recharge.  At heart, I am an absurdist who is inspired by the works of people like Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, and John Cleese.  My personal motto is "surrender to the ridiculous" and I try to live that.  So without any more preamble, this piece was my attempt to get back to that.

While I can't really say "growing up", I took tremendous pleasure in shows like Iron Chef and Iron Chef America during some very formative years like in college and shortly after.  Cooking was a great surrender for me to be able to unwind, bond a bit with friends and family, and try out some tasty things.  My parents introduced me to a lot of varieties and styles of cuisine growing up and their only rule was that whatever it is, even if I hate it, I just have to at least try it.  To date, this has served me very well and I wanted to take a chance to capture that.

From there, I drew some inspiration from the 'Tag' article, where we involve something metaphysical and mantle it on a person and I paired it with my interests. Threw all of this in a blender, added a bit of skim milk, pulsed for 3-5 seconds, and voila.  This produced my most successful article to date.

Posted 15th February, 2019

I don't have a ton to say about this one.  I wrote it in one fevered sitting while stuck at work trying to update a SAN.  It's loosely related to my SCP-4401 in that some of the other entities it talks about may or may not be the moon-related stuff I was trying to imply.  The fact of the matter is that I wasn't sure when I wrote it, but I liked the possibilities.

I am a fan of the 'Competitive Eschatology' canon and I enjoy how they portay SCP-343.  I kind of was thinking in the same light that, sure, it could be 'God' but it also may not be.  The idea that it's another piece of another cycle or an even weirder dynamic than we think it is one I find very appealing.

This is a short work!  I know it'll never win Pulitzers but I like the implications.

Competitive Eschatology was the first canon I ever read about and thought "holy crap this is neat!"  I think I got to this shortly after discovering the SCP-001 hub so Ahpakt was on my mind and then that hub popped into my reads and I sunk right in.  I love the grand license, I love the desperate aversion to normalcy.

This tale was a short thought I had that mirrored my own sort of experience being very late to the party to write for CE.  Unfortunately, the canon hasn't moved anywhere in quite some time as of the writing of this tale and I am very leery of using my time travel powers to go back to 2013 and write in it actively.

Anyway, long story short, this eldritch thing got left behind and heard the call very late.  Unfortunately, space has conspired against him and it seems as if he will not back it either ever, or in time to feast on the destruction of all things.  Poor guy!

Aside from aggravating the Brits with the American spelling of 'canceled' (instead of cancelled), this Tale came from a thought I've had for a really long time.  Many many years ago when Welcome to Nightvale got started, one of the first couple of episodes contained a story about how the Public Library didn't exist on Wednesdays.  Ever since then I've always just really loved that idea, and I've taken the lessons of SCP and morphed that into kind of...well, what you read I guess.  

What if we just canceled an entire day?

Not very sure what got into me to write this; was just struck by an urge to try and capture some of the zany aspects of Ambrose.  I have to admit this was a mixed bag and was, as of the time of its posting, my most "controversial" piece.  A net positive overall, but also with a pretty fair number of folks who didn't think this went far enough, or felt it didn't advance Ambrose at all.

This is a strong candidate for me to re-write.

Posted 9th March, 2019 

This was the first contest I ever participated in on SCP and I enjoyed it!  There is no good way to prepare for a format like jamcon except to maybe really focus on writing prompts.  I am an avid reader of /r/writingprompts but not a participant.  I hoped this was a worthy enough base to give a try.

When I went to sleep after reading the first theme, I had no ideas at all and was prepared to skip until day 2.  But when I woke up, I immediately had this idea to pay homage to [http://www.scp-wiki.net/SCP-4062 SCP-4062] by Lesh "Soggy Doggy" which focuses on a canine powered submarine.

Tsar Dogba is a group of Saint Bernard nukes that paraphysically compress and make the plutonium payload inside of them go critical.  That's really all there is to it.  I love this article as an author, but I understand why it didn't soar in the face of Jam-Con.  My own efforts aside, there were some //extremely// good entries on Day 1 alone.  I had a good time!  I am glad this article survived but I have no illusions that I should have placed.

**Special Containment Procedures:**  This author is, for the present, self-contained to the SCP Foundation.

**Description:** My name is Tony, or as you've noted my handle, 'ManyMeats'.  I am a 30-something IT Professional who lives and works in Wisconsin, USA.  I enjoy worldbuilding tales, really soft sci-fi bordering on space operas, and general cosmic horror as my chiefly favorite tales.

My favorite authors and therefore who I consider to be some of my greatest influences are: Stephen King, Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman, and Patrick Rothfuss.  Honorable mention to Chris Avelone!

I am the proud puppy-dad to a female Australian Shepherd and King Charles Spaniel mix named 'Terra'.  She has a lovely warm brown coat that reminds me of good Earth, or, as my friend like to say, pouring cream into a cup of coffee.  She's 2 years old, about 45#, and one of the greatest sources of joy in my life I ever could have asked for.

Also at home are my two cats.  First, Ser Barristen Selmy aka White Cat aka Asshole aka Pee-Cat.  Second, Meatloaf aka Gray Cat aka Fatass aka Poop-Cat.

These two are a bonded brothers from a litter of five.  I semi-rescued them just over a year ago from a family who was going to surrender their whole litter to the local shelter and then move out of state.  These two have been a great source of energy and life in my home and they get along pretty great with their big puppy sister.  I was originally looking for one cat, but since they were bonded and I am a sucker I took both.

The three of them enjoy rampaging up and down the steps, as well as sharing the loveseat that looks out the front window for those lazy afternoons.

------

**Discovery Log:** I began writing in college when I underwent a very serious future-plans-change.  Originally enrolled as a Chemistry student hoping for Pre-Pharm, I discovered I really fucking sucked at calculus.  This is bad.  So, despite getting A's in Algebra and Statistics, and despite having a tutor and doing every point of extra credit the professor would let me get, I got a D in Calc 2 and knew my aspirations were shot.

Long story short, I switched my degree program to Management Information Systems which, at the University of Wisconsin, is something of a mixture between Business Admin and Comp Sci.  During this new program I was exposed to a Technical Writing course and it wound up being, bar none, my favorite course I took in the whole 7 years I was enrolled in college [5 undergrad and 2 grad].

So, between exposure to technical writing, and a budding personal interest in fiction and GM'ing/Storytelling for tabletop RPGs, trying my hand at creative writing felt like a natural extension.

The long story short from here is that I spend 5 years participating in and helping to administrate and even run a Bleach forum RPG site.  I took a character from its inception as an application and took it through more than 130 completed threads and into "retirement", which has to be awarded after review and a consensus of 80% or more of your peers.

I had climbed that mountain, but I sought newer, better, greater challenges.  I doubled down on my private writing but without people to, compare myself alongside or to critically judge me I was worried that I would dull and felt some of those muscles start to atrophy.  My edge had dulled and I had accepted complacency.  So, I finally dusted off my lurking around in November of 2018 and decided now was the time.

I began seriously critically analyzing articles, authors, and the format and then just around 5 weeks later my first SCP was posted at the beginning of 2019 under the name Dr Fujimura.  As I became more involved in the community and joined the SCP-INT and SCPDeclassified Discord communities, I decided my handle should match my discord name for the sake of clarity.  Before becoming "established" I made the swap to ManyMeats and here we are today.

Thanks for joining me on my journey!  I hope there is a lot more to come.
