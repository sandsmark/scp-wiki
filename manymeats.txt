[http://scp-wiki.net/scp-4369 <SCP-4369>] -> "Cassandra: Play Your Part"
[[collapsible show="+ Author Commentary" hide="- Close Commentary"]]
Posted 4th January, 2019

This was the first SCP that I ever posted and I cannot tell you the level of relief I felt in having it survive.  I've lurked on SCP for a looong, long time and seen countless new authors endure the downvote firing squad.  I scraped and re-drafted several times but ultimately, while showering one morning, this idea struck me.

Coming together over 7 days of real life time, Cassandra: Play Your Part is my take on the Greek Myth of 'Cassandra'.  Cassandra was the daughter of Priam that //wasn't// Helen of Troy.  Apollo was very keen on her and so he gifted her with a foresight of the future in the hopes she would sleep with him.  She didn't, so bitter Apollo turned this into a curse wherein she kept her gift of prophecy, but no one would ever listen to her.  She was cursed to know what terrible things were coming but to be ignored.  So, she dreamt every night of Troy's impending destruction but was powerless to stop it.

In the same way, this article is constructed around a nameless, faceless radio host who has the power of prophecy to foresee the doom of his small town.  He reaches out, across time and space and reality itself to try to get help but ultimately his echo is powerless.  He can stop nothing.  The only way the Foundation has discovered to make this echo palatable is to stop the prophecy from being discovered.

I am particularly proud of the MTF log on this one.

[[collapsible show="+ Author Commentary" hide="- Close Commentary"]]
Posted 13th February, 2019

This was my first "instant success" on just my second article and my first formal attempt at 'cosmic horror' in a format even remotely resembling SCPF.  While far from a huge hit in terms of SCP, this article was one of my most satisfying moments as an author to have a risk in style get 'rewarded' like this.

The concept here was originally to be the footing for a GOI I had hopes to seed.  I was looking to the moon from inspiration and couldn't find anything that really made the moon itself creepy.  Tons of stuff about the moon resulting in creepy or foreboding things like werewolves, and madness, and stuff like that...but the moon itself?  I tried to get at that.

In hindsight, this article somewhat suffers from a real "punch" but there is sufficient mystery and absence of detail here to at least moderately redeem that lack of big reveal.  It's tough to introduce one thing and then make the article about something else entirely; the monolith has little to do with the 'point' here.  I scrapped lots of material about glyphs and depictions on the stone but ultimately felt more there was less attention everywhere else.

[http://scp-wiki.net/scp-4898 <SCP-4898>] -> "Do You Have What It Takes?"
[[collapsible show="+ Author Commentary" hide="- Close Commentary"]]
Posted 2nd March, 2019

This was a big mystery for me.  Here I tried to dial up the "wtf" meter a little bit and focus more on some absurdist type horror that I am more comfortable with.  I was inspired by a 'Scion' campaign I am running that involves a cult of actors and producers who want to control the population through media.

I don't want to focus on user feedback as a real metric for any kind of success I feel as an author, but despite critical acclaim for this article it's just never really piled up any number of votes.  The ratio is great, and it was even featured on the "2019 Week 10" episode of Bluesoul's SCP.Cafe podcast!  Unfortunately, due to multiple reasons, this puppy just never seemed to get many eyeballs on it.

Might not be the best place to confess, but I actually wrote this entire article in one sitting over the course of a Sunday afternoon.  It's simply, but it's punchy.  I'm proud of it.

[http://scp-wiki.net/SCP-4198 <SCP-4198>] -> "Feed Your Hair"
[[collapsible show="+ Author Commentary" hide="- Close Commentary"]]
Posted 11th March, 2019

This one came from a conversation with some friends about misheard song lyrics.  I remember bringing up 'White Rabbit' and how tons of people I know always recall "feed your head" as "feed your hair" instead.  I had a girlfriend in college who got this wrong repeatedly even after a year and a half of insistence.  Some say this is why we broke up...

I'm not one of those 'some people', but some say...

At any rate, the conversation devolved from there thanks to ad lib jokes and here we have this article.  I loved writing.  My personal motto is "embrace the absurd" and I feel like this is part of my slide further into that.  I started down this road with 4898 and we just...well, we'll wind up //somewhere//.

I don't have a ton to say about this one.  I wrote it in one fevered sitting while stuck at work trying to update a SAN.  It's loosely related to my SCP-4401 in that some of the other entities it talks about may or may not be the moon-related stuff I was trying to imply.  The fact of the matter is that I wasn't sure when I wrote it, but I liked the possibilities.

I am a fan of the 'Competitive Eschatology' canon and I enjoy how they portay SCP-343.  I kind of was thinking in the same light that, sure, it could be 'God' but it also may not be.  The idea that it's another piece of another cycle or an even weirder dynamic than we think it is one I find very appealing.

This is a short work!  I know it'll never win Pulitzers but I like the implications.

//Entry for Jam-Con 2019 Theme: "Shaggy Dog"
[[collapsible show="+ Author Commentary" hide="- Close Commentary"]]
Posted 9th March, 2019 

This was the first contest I ever participated in on SCP and I enjoyed it!  There is no good way to prepare for a format like jamcon except to maybe really focus on writing prompts.  I am an avid reader of /r/writingprompts but not a participant.  I hoped this was a worthy enough base to give a try.

When I went to sleep after reading the first theme, I had no ideas at all and was prepared to skip until day 2.  But when I woke up, I immediately had this idea to pay homage to [http://www.scp-wiki.net/SCP-4062 SCP-4062] by Lesh "Soggy Doggy" which focuses on a canine powered submarine.

Tsar Dogba is a group of Saint Bernard nukes that paraphysically compress and make the plutonium payload inside of them go critical.  That's really all there is to it.  I love this article as an author, but I understand why it didn't soar in the face of Jam-Con.  My own efforts aside, there were some //extremely// good entries on Day 1 alone.  I had a good time!  I am glad this article survived but I have no illusions that I should have placed.

**Special Containment Procedures:**  This author is, for the present, self-contained to the SCP Foundation.

**Description:** My name is Tony, or as you've noted my handle, 'ManyMeats'.  I am a 30-something IT Professional who lives and works in Wisconsin, USA.  I enjoy worldbuilding tales, really soft sci-fi bordering on space operas, and general cosmic horror as my chiefly favorite tales.

My favorite authors and therefore who I consider to be some of my greatest influences are: Stephen King, Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman, and Patrick Rothfuss.  Honorable mention to Chris Avelone!

I am the proud puppy-dad to a female Australian Shepherd and King Charles Spaniel mix named 'Terra'.  She has a lovely warm brown coat that reminds me of good Earth, or, as my friend like to say, pouring cream into a cup of coffee.  She's 2 years old, about 45#, and one of the greatest sources of joy in my life I ever could have asked for.

Also at home are my two cats.  First, Ser Barristen Selmy aka White Cat aka Asshole aka Pee-Cat.  Second, Meatloaf aka Gray Cat aka Fatass aka Poop-Cat.

These two are a bonded brothers from a litter of five.  I semi-rescued them just over a year ago from a family who was going to surrender their whole litter to the local shelter and then move out of state.  These two have been a great source of energy and life in my home and they get along pretty great with their big puppy sister.  I was originally looking for one cat, but since they were bonded and I am a sucker I took both.

The three of them enjoy rampaging up and down the steps, as well as sharing the loveseat that looks out the front window for those lazy afternoons.

**Discovery Log:** I began writing in college when I underwent a very serious future-plans-change.  Originally enrolled as a Chemistry student hoping for Pre-Pharm, I discovered I really fucking sucked at calculus.  This is bad.  So, despite getting A's in Algebra and Statistics, and despite having a tutor and doing every point of extra credit the professor would let me get, I got a D in Calc 2 and knew my aspirations were shot.

Long story short, I switched my degree program to Management Information Systems which, at the University of Wisconsin, is something of a mixture between Business Admin and Comp Sci.  During this new program I was exposed to a Technical Writing course and it wound up being, bar none, my favorite course I took in the whole 7 years I was enrolled in college [5 undergrad and 2 grad].

So, between exposure to technical writing, and a budding personal interest in fiction and GM'ing/Storytelling for tabletop RPGs, trying my hand at creative writing felt like a natural extension.

The long story short from here is that I spend 5 years participating in and helping to administrate and even run a Bleach forum RPG site.  I took a character from its inception as an application and took it through more than 130 completed threads and into "retirement", which has to be awarded after review and a consensus of 80% or more of your peers.

I had climbed that mountain, but I sought newer, better, greater challenges.  I doubled down on my private writing but without people to, well, compare myself to or anonymously judge me I was worried that I would dull.  I'd lose my edge and accept complacency.  So, I finally dusted off my lurking arround in November of 2018 and decided now was the time.

I began seriously critically analyzing articles, authors, and the format and then just around 5 weeks later my first SCP was posted.

Thanks for joining me on my journey!  I hope there is a lot more to come.
