Mr. Appleseed. Seriously, that's my name. And wouldn't you know it, whenever I sneeze, cough, or fart, out come appleseeds. It sucks. This is, of course, only exacerbated by the fact that I was just picked up by the Foundation and now I feel quite the sneeze coming on.

Hold on, wait, they're not taking me captive. They're taking off my handcuffs. What's that they're saying?

"Ah, welcome back Dr. King."
