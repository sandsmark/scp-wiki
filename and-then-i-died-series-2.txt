Welcome to the 4th edition of //And Then I Died…//, an SCP collective writing game! Useful information is held behind a collapsible tab right here:

# Whoever guesses an entry correctly first (more on that below) will pick an SCP to write a mini-tale about (200 - 500 words). If someone doesn't want to write, they shouldn't guess. The entry needs to be written within 72 hours (3 days). If it doesn't happen, the second person to guess correctly will be given a chance to write an entry. This continues until no one else has guessed, in which case, the judge will step in and write an entry for the person based on the SCP.
# The character "speaking" must die at the end and the entry must end with "And then I died.". It might not be from the SCP in question, so long as their exposure caused it somehow.
# While not required, a few red herrings are definitely encouraged, so long as the final solution is the most likely/most obvious answer. The answer doesn't need to be obvious, but it definitely has to be guessable, or at least have something clear about the connection to the answer at hand.
# There are three days for guessing. There's a 24 hour wait time before the guesses are revealed (if someone guessed correctly in that time), to collect the guesses made. Otherwise, two additional days are allowed for guessing, for a total of three days.
# If no one guesses the SCP after three days, congrats to the author! They can write one more.
# If someone is writing an entry, they should send a message to all of the judges so the judges can know what the SCP in question is. Judges can help for proofreading, though do note the judges will tell you if you're potentially being too obtuse, or veto your entry if you're abusing the rules to get away with no one guessing. The judges, then, can't actually guess or give the game away.
# If you've guessed right before and you guess correctly, your answer will be put in a lower priority than any other correct guesses. This is to prevent people from writing multiple times in quick succession and leave no room for other guessers.
# Finally, for this edition we are only looking for SCPs belonging to Series 2 (SCPs 1000-1999) - given the size of the database and number of entries, this is to hopefully streamline the game.

**Round 1: Shaggydredlocks**

I spring, full-formed from the realm of all Happy things, brimming with excitement!

My first sight upon my joyous manifestation is a timid-looking looking person in a lab coat. They stare at me, eyebrow cocked, expectant. It is as if they're waiting for something to happen...

I stroll up to the glass dividing us, giving my most adorably dopey grin, and I can't help but notice the stranger seems to be desperately avoiding eye-contact. Why, that's silly.

From somewhere above me, a hatch opens. I hear the unmistakable sound of a chainsaw revving up.

And then I died.

To guess, send a **//Wikidot PM only//** to [[*user Shaggydredlocks]]  Make the subject "Round [Number] Guess". They'll let you know if you've guessed correctly by the end of the time period. You only get one guess, so make sure you think you're right before you take a swing at it! If you win, then congrats! You get to write the next one. Have fun!
