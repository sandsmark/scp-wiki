**Item #:** SCP-3691

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to both the widespread public awareness of SCP-3691 and successful implementation of counter-intelligence measures (including, but not limited to, fabrication of the 'spontaneous human combustion' phenomenon), no containment procedures are currently necessary.

Personnel of Area-451 are, at present, researching measures of suppressing or neutralizing the threat of SCP-3691, should it begin to manifest at a higher frequency in future.

**Description:** SCP-3691 designates a biological phenomenon, typically occurring in four distinct stages.

* Stage I: Subject's sudoriparous glands[[footnote]] Sweat glands. [[/footnote]] will begin to continually excrete a substance chemically identical to olive oil at an average rate of 0.5 litres per hour. This generally provokes extreme nausea and light-headedness.

* Stage II: Sodium chloride crystals and ground black peppercorns begin to manifest on the subject's epidermis. The sensation has been described as 'itchy' and 'discomforting'. 

* Stage III: After emitting smoke for approximately five minutes, the subject's body will begin to blister and eventually combust. Attempts to extinguish the resulting flames have thus far been unsuccessful. Subject displays intense agony throughout the process until eventually perishing.

* Stage IV: The cadaver slowly dematerializes via an unidentified mechanism as several large, uneven slices of flesh are removed. Grooves indicate the utilization of a serrated blade. Thermal screening displays no evident heat signatures that would indicate some form of concealed entity. Traces of blood, cooked tissue and articles of clothing left behind reportedly dematerialize within 24 hours.

The phenomenon occurs, on average, over the course of two hours. As of 3/11/2018, there have been an estimated 350 instances of SCP-3691 worldwide, 16 of which transpired with persons under Foundation custody. The reason for this is currently unknown.
