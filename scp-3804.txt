**Item #:** SCP-3804

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation AI, DEINOPIS, has been embedded into all major email services to monitor inboxes for instances of SCP-3804. Maintenance of DEINOPIS is the responsibility of MTF Mu-4 ("Debuggers"). If an instance is located, the AI will make a copy for Foundation records, and the instance of SCP-3804 is then permanently deleted from the recipient's account.

Any intended recipients identified as reading SCP-3804 are to be located and secured by foundation agents, to then be administered Class-A or Class-B amnestics, as appropriate.

**Description:** SCP-3804 is a series of emails purportedly written by Olivier de Whynn, CEO of "Magnum and Whitley".[[footnote]] Referred to in several emails as "M&W" or "M+W". [[/footnote]] No record of either the individual nor company exists outside of SCP-3804. Several instances of SCP-3804 contain an image supposedly of de Whynn, but no two images have been the same. Individuals depicted have varied in age, race, weight, eye colour, and other aesthetic features.

All encountered instances of SCP-3804 are labelled as being sent from "Olivier.de.Whynn@M+W.com", and are sent exclusively to business/work-related email accounts.[[footnote]] Both the email address and domain SCP-3804 are sent from are nonexistent. [[/footnote]] The method through which SCP-3804  are sent and delivered is currently unknown.  The emails' content varies from instance to instance, but consistently reference catastrophic events or circumstances, and the impact of these on Magnum and Whitley. 

Upon reading the email, the recipient will become agitated and preoccupied with their organisation's incident response policies and disaster recovery plans. Any plans or policies in existence will be deemed severely insufficient. If they have the resources and authority to do so, recipients will take various actions that they believe will improve their organisation's readiness for a catastrophic event.[[footnote]] Actions have included revision of policy, requesting additional security budgets, stockpiling of food and supplies, issuing a security lockdown for all offices, and proposing the dismissal of all foreign employees.  [[/footnote]] When questioned, recipients are unable to explain what they are preparing for, or how their actions will help mitigate its effects.

Recipients will not recall reading the email, nor will they attribute their actions to it. When shown the email a second time no anomalous effect is present, and recipients will often express confusion over the nature of SCP-3804. Despite this, administration of amnestics has proved effective in counteracting SCP-3804's effects. Only the intended recipients are vulnerable to the effects of SCP-3804 - reading an instance will have no anomalous impact on other individuals. 

**Discovery:** SCP-3804 was discovered by the Foundation after ████ ██████, CEO of multinational corporation ██████, publicly announced plans, via a company blog post, to issue all employees with gas masks and emergency rations as standard, due to the possibility of "a rainy day occurring".[[footnote]] See file 3804-1b for the full post. [[/footnote]] Foundation agents were dispatched to investigate the situation, and the announcement was attributed to cyber vandalism.

**Addendum SCP-3804.1:** Selected instances of SCP-3804:[[footnote]] Please contact RAISA for access to the full collection. [[/footnote]]

[[tab SCP-3804-2]]
**SCP-3804-2**

**Description:** SCP-3804-2 was delivered to a cyber intelligence analyst at The National Bank of ██████, on ██/██/██. Following SCP-3804's discovery, MTF Mu-4 were employed to monitor for further incidents and investigate the SCP.

**Email:**

> I am sure that we have all been unsettled by the events of the last days. The destruction of Orleans and subsequent disturbances across the globe have been truly shocking to witness. As the dust settles and our national infrastructure finds itself slow to recover, now is a good time to reacquaint ourselves with Magnum and Whitley's "FlexiWork" policy. 
> 
> We support you to be flexible in how you work, whether that's from the office, your home, or your nearest relocation or evacuation centre. Portable wifi hotspots and ethernet cables are available to all employees from the Operations and Services desk on Floor 3, but our state of the art internet security allows you to utilise any home or public wifi networks.
> 
> If you're working in public though, please ensure you have a privacy filter placed over your laptop screen. You never know who could be looking over your shoulder!
> 
> Fond regards,
> Olivier

**Outcome:** Recipient contacted their HR department to report that they could not locate various documents on the company intranet. Content reported missing were instructions on treating third-degree burns, weaponisation of office equipment protocols, and company policy on consuming the flesh of other colleagues.

When informed these documents did not exist, the recipient became irate, and assaulted the colleague who he was speaking to. The recipient was administered amnestics whilst in police custody, with his actions attributed to an episode of poor mental health.

[[tab SCP-3804-10]]
**SCP-3804-10**

**Description:** SCP-3804-10 was delivered to the Facilities Manager of ██████ Hospital, located in █████████, on ██/██/██. 

The email address through which SCP-3804 is delivered had been added to most popular email services' spam filters after the delivery of SCP-3804-9. This proved to be an ineffective method of containment, with instances still appearing in inboxes.

**Email:**
> [[=image M%26W%20Image.jpg]]
> Thank you to all of you who have continued to work hard given the recent and difficult circumstances we find ourselves in today. Back in January you and your colleagues voted "Kindness" to be our message of the year. 
> 
> As you go about your work today, bear that message in mind - is there a colleague you could support with a report? Could you chat to your team away from their desks to see how they're doing? Have you phoned an elderly relative who may be feeling afraid of the Moon's Red Eye?
> 
> Given recent events, there are a number of changes which we will have to make around our offices nationwide. We envisage that these changes will only be temporary, and normal service will resume shortly:
> # All on-site canteen and refreshment facilities will be closed. Please bring your issued rations with you. Replacements will not be available.
> # You may notice an increased presence of security personnel around the office, some of whom may be equipped with firearms. Please do not be alarmed by this, it is for your own, and for the company's, protection.
> # When you arrive at your office, security personnel may need to examine you for signs of infection. Please cooperate with their requests so you are permitted entry as quickly as possible.
> # All office basements and underground car parks are being re-purposed as shelters. If an alert is sounded please make your way quickly and quietly to your nearest shelter. Do not use the lifts. Do not look up at the sky. 
> 
> Unfortunately, we will also have to postpone next week's Mangum & Whitley's Awards Night. We will however, be re-opening the voting for the "Colleague of the Year" award, so get voting via the link on the staff portal now!
> 
> Until next time,
> Olivier

**Outcome:**  The Facilities Manager altered the next delivery of food produce for the Hospital canteen, cancelling all fresh produce and increasing their frozen goods order by a factor of 30. Amnestics were administered, and the order attributed to a system glitch.

[[tab SCP-3804-14]]
**SCP-3804-14**

**Description:** SCP-3804-14 was delivered to Researcher ██████, stationed at Site-17 on  ██/██/██.

**Email:**
> [[=image M%26W%202%20copy.jpg]]
> 
> Over the weekend you may have heard disturbing allegations concerning our relationship with Tragia Industries and our subsequent involvement in the Cape Town Massacre.[[footnote]] Tragia Industries were a real organisation, based in ██████, South Africa. Foundation personnel sent to investigate encountered armed resistance, and responded with appropriate force. All hostile entities were eliminated, and a large amount of anomalous items were located. An investigation is underway.  [[/footnote]]
> 
> We have a renowned reputation for professionalism and excellence, and have provided expert advice and guidance for over 30 years. This is not a failing of M&W's, but we admit there were failings in the conduct of the project team engaged by Tragia.  All those involved have been obtained by the appropriate authorities.
> 
> We are expecting significant scrutiny of our role, and particularly of our Thaumaturgy and Occult department (commonly referred to internally as T+O). If you receive questions from friends or family on this, please refer to our handy talking points guide, which is attached to this email.[[footnote]] No document was attached to the email [[/footnote]] If you receive any inquiries from the Interim Government's Media Department, please immediately contact your Team Leader.  
> 
> Best wishes,
> Olivier de Whynn

**Outcome:** Researcher ██████ flagged the containment procedures of several SCPs capable of inducing an XK-Class event as inadequate, and contacted corresponding head researchers to demand a containment review. Class-A amnestics administered. Priority of SCP-3804 containment upgraded.

[[tab SCP-3804-16]]
**SCP-3804-16**

**Description:** SCP-3804-16 was delivered on ██/██/██ to 60% of employees at the London office of private equity firm, █████████. Unlike previous emails, this instance contained no graphical elements. To date, this is the only instance which has been delivered to multiple recipients. 

**Email:**
> We made a mistake. Months ago we should have closed the offices, sent you home to your families, home to your loved ones, home to the ones who truly matter.
>  
> I think we all knew what the Arrival heralded, we just didn't want to admit it.  Didn't want to admit what it was. What it meant.  I was just trying to keep the ship afloat and carry on with business as usual. It was less frightening for me that way. I hope it made things less frightening for you too.
> 
> I've not seen a soul in weeks, and I'm running out of supplies. I don't know how long I have left, and I don't know how many of you are left.
> 
> I just hope there is someone there to receive this message.

**Outcome:** Over a period of 7 minutes, all recipients made their way to the office's roof terrace, and jumped into the internal courtyard 23 floors below. Total fatalities numbered ███. All witnesses were administered class-A amnestics, and a Foundation operation was instigated, attributing the deaths to a large fire within the office. The building was suitably damaged, survivors' memory loss was accredited to smoke inhalation, and media coverage controlled to correspond with this version of events.       

Following SCP-3804-16, DEINOPIS was successfully implemented and containment accomplished. SCP-3804-17 was deleted without being read by recipient, with no follow up action necessary.
