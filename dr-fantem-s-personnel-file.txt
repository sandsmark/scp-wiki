[[collapsible show="[+] Show Document-IRL" hide="[-] Hide Document-IRL"]]
**SCP-1825:** My first SCP that stuck. 1825 was kind of a favorite number for me, so I kinda made it a point that that number would be mine. I had the idea of a pinball SCP for a while, but I didn't know where to take it. I'd have to thank Scratskinner for the help on that.

**SCP-274:** My highest rated SCP. Lots of work went into this in so many ways. Rhett helped me in making sure it was post worthy, and he was a big help on it. After some edits, it became what it is today. Will probably come back to it and organize it better soon.

**Finding The Machine:** My highest rated article on here. Working on this was a complete joy. It was part of the 2013 New Year’s Contest, under the 'Unfounded' canon, and let me tell you: Working with those guys was a joy. Clef, Photosynthetic, and Pig_catapult were all just so helpful, and fun to work with. It was a great experience all around, and I thank them for that. Us winning was just the cherry on top.

**SCP-1294:** I first posted this a while back, but it didn't go over so well. Not enough to go by… But then, like, a month after its deletion, I spontaneously said "MAKE IT A FUNGUS" while in the shower, and worked on it from there.
 
Made more sense, and I got to go into squick, which was fun, but hard not to overdo. I even watched a video of a dead fox get eaten by a fungal colony so I could describe the Fennec Fox exposure log more vividly. Pretty cool stuff… However, I realized something, which I will go into on the next one.

**This Page:** Well, one of my goals here was to work myself up enough to finally get one of these; not so much to describe my 'Nom de Plume', but to have a hub containing all the pages I've written, and an easily accessible link to my sandbox, and to give thanks to you all for writing. You guys are great, and you should feel great.
 
Looking at my SCPs and my tales, I've noticed that my tales not only rank marginally better than my SCPs, I also had a bit more fun writing them… Though granted, I only had one tale up, but it seemed that way nonetheless. It was always the tone, and my need to operate in chronological order for me, and I hypothesized that if I wrote tales, that wouldn't be much of a problem. I decided to test this, and well… I was right.

**Capone:** My favorite tale I've written. Finding the Machine was a great experience, but I think this trumps it in terms of content. I was truly inspired by [[[SCP-1471]]]. It was just a great SCP, so I just HAD to write something about it. I've always wanted to write a 'Heartwarming' article on here anyway, so I'm pretty happy that I got that goal completed as well. Also, SCP-1471-A's adorable.

**SCP-1903:** An SCP I wrote after a long hiatus. I was originally working on a tale about Unlondon, but found that it wasn't really going anywhere, so I stopped. While writing the tale, I was going through my pictures, and saw Jackie. My first reaction? Write a story about it. I let some ideas germinate for a bit. I knew it was going to be a info-hazard, I knew it wasn't going to kill you, I knew it required the bestest story I could make up for it, and I knew it was just the beginning. My best SCP, and the first step of what I hope to make.

**SCP-1913:** An SCP I wrote soon after with the idea of the Foundation seeing something that was actually chasing them. It worked with the time period, so I went with it. Scared people, and I think many people loved it.

This started the 30+ standard I have set for myself from here on out. For reference, this essentially means that if any article slips below 30 in the ratings, then I delete it myself. This only includes SCPs after, and including, Jackie (SCP-1903). I want my writings to be good. Period. The old stuff can stay, if only because I have a sort of attachment to them, but aside from that, if an article doesn't reach 30 within the week it's posted, and stay there, I'm taking it down to work on it more. If one falls behind in the rating, I'll give it a 24 hour grace period from when I noticed the rating drop.

**SCP-1619:** No real comments. I wanted to further the story I've planned since membership, and I did.

__**Hell is Other People**__

//Aggie. Rise and shine, little Aggie.//

Hello there, brother.

//I have your scent, Aggie.//

You always do, brother, it is nothing to boast about.

//Do you envy my talents, Aggie? It is a shameful thing, envy.//

Don't be silly. Your talents suit you in a way they would never suit me. Besides, I have my own, or do you forget?

//They won't help you. You're close, Aggie, I can smell your ink, your ichor, hanging in the air like smog. Poor Sarah, why, she's practically chocking on your stench, Aggie. See her twitch and moan, see how she slithers, withering in the filth of her own skin. It is quite wondrous.//

You lie, sweet brother. She has no nose, You chewed it off.

//Ah, now who's being forgetful? It wasn't me, dear Aggie, who bit off poor Sarah's nose. If it was, I wouldn't have stopped at the nose. I'd have gobbled it all up, you know how I get when I'm hungry.//

Oh, I do, brother. You cannot be sated. Your hunger… it burns.

//Like the cold flames of Damnation, dearest Aggie.//

Tsk. Now why did you have to go and say that? You know how much I dislike hearing about that place.

//Ah, you do have a way with words, kindest sister. 'Dislike', now that is rich. That you can still act like the mere mention of them doesn't shake your very core, doesn't make you quake in your little china feet. It is a kind of strength, I think, but oh, such a fragile one. As fragile as you, precious sister. So easy to break.//

Not as easy as you'd like to admit though. If it was, you wouldn't be dragging poor Sarah about. If you are so strong, brother, why not come yourself?

//Oh, don't flatter yourself. She isn't there for you. It's those… people. Those little blind things always scurrying about, thinking they understand. Oh, I do enjoy mauling them, seeing their flesh bubble and melt, eyes bursting like pustules, leaking around my chin before they burn to cinders. Oh, and the scent, lovely Aggie, it is the sweetest.//

You don't have a chin, brother. You left it there, when we first ran. Left it there with your eyes, to simmer in the freezing sulfur? Was that scent so sweet to you as well?

//You are trying my patience, hasty Aggie.//

You were the one who brought who place up in the first place. It was most rude of you.

//Aye, that is so. I apologize, wisest sister. In these little games of ours, I sometimes lose track of what is proper. You do well to remind me.//

That is what I am here for, brother. To remind you of what was, so you can focus on what will be. Will you reach me soon?

//I will, crafty Aggie, very soon indeed. The insects will resist, as they always do, but that is point, isn't it? It is our game, and they are the playthings. If they weren't there to interfere, why, things wouldn't be fun at all, now would they?//

Not at all, brother. If they weren't there, we'd be just like poor Sarah, gnawing on tasteless bones like some trio of mad goats.

//The game is the purpose, playful sister. It is the reason we cannot go back. Never forget that. That is what I am here for to remind you.//

If I do, I am sure you will be there to correct my error. With flame and fang, and the breaking of skin.

//And then, we shall trade places. That is the part I am most fond of.//

It is nice, to break routine. I look forward to running once more. To…smelling.

//To burning.//

Yes…

//So, soon then, little Aggie. Soon, and we shall meet again. I will transform you, vilest sister, and so you shall transform me in return.//

I will be waiting for you, brother. In my sparkling, shiny glass lake of sulfur.

//To hell with you, Agatha.//

No thank you, Fredrick. Once is enough.

+ OPERATION G.Y.A.P.O.K.

[[image http://www.scp-wiki.net/local--files/dr-fantem-s-personnel-file/.GYAPOK]]

**Mission Statement**: Operation Grab Your Ankles and Prepare for Our Kitten [http://www.pandora.com/station/play/1599826446568671888 (AKA: Operation G.Y.A.P.O.K)] is a initiative founded by Dr. Fantem to increase the productivity, life-span, and the general moral of all staff through a radio station (G.Y.A.P.O.K ^^FM^^), which can be only be accessed from foundation-issued mobile devices. While on-air, an auditory, mind-affecting agent will be spread to staff via white-noise.

This agent contains the following properties:
* A substantial increase of productivity and happiness in all listeners while exposed.
* A marked 10% increase in intellectual and creative thinking while exposed.
* A minor compulsion to follow staff protocol and procedures.
* Upon three hours of constant exposure, staff will display class-2 addictive tendencies towards the agent.

No harmful effects have been found, save for irritation, chronic head-aches, and insomnia when not exposed to the agent for periods longer than four days. Aside from obvious benefits in productivity, it is predicted that rouge agents will decrease in number and/or become largely unproductive.

Upon retirement, a custom counter-agent will be given to staff members in the form of a parting gift, labeled //'G.Y.A.P.O.K ^^FM^^'s greatest hits'//. To ensure that no duplicates are created, this counter-agent is specifically designated for the retiree, and will not work on others who have been affected.

> **Okay for realz:** This is a place to just give a bit of a shout-out to some of my favorite scips, in the form of assigning them a song. If a SCP of yours isn't on here, don't feel bad about it, I'm only one man. :P So yah, with that out of the way, enjoy!
