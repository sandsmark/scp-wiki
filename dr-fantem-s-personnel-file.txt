**Name:** Dr. Cameron Fantem

**Security Clearance Level:** 3

**Profession:** Linguistics Analyst/Social Engineer/Site 19 radio DJ.

**Location:** Site 19

**History:** Dr. Fantem originated from an undisclosed area in Michigan, and grew up in V███ B████ Fl. After receiving a doctorate in English from ███ in 20██, Dr. Fantem contacted the Foundation after he contacted the local authorities about gun-shots heard from SCP-247-1-2. Dr. Fantem witnessed Foundation personnel terminating SCP-247-1-2, and killing up to four SCP-247-2 instances, and then immediately requested a job to an undercover agent, just as the undercover agent was about to offer him one, expressing how 'amazing it would be to be able to see what you people see everyday'.

Dr. Fantem simultaneously regrets and does not regret this decision.

**Psychological profile:** Dr. Fantem appears to act entirely on impulse, and accomplishes those acts through intense planning and thought. An example of this would be how he acquired a doctorate by carrying it out in the easiest way possible, solely for the purpose of gaining the title of 'Doctor'.

When not working under the Foundation, Dr. Fantem works a part time job as a social engineer, and spends his free time playing video games, table top RPGs, Photoshopping creepy faces from Soul Eater on anime cats, making music playlists and/or writing.

**SCP-1825:** My first SCP that stuck. 1825 was kind of a favorite number for me, so I kinda made it a point that that number would be mine. I had the idea of a pinball SCP for a while, but I didn't know where to take it. I'd have to thank Scratskinner for the help on that.

**SCP-274:** My highest rated SCP. Lots of work went into this in so many ways. Rhett helped me in making sure it was post worthy, and he was a big help on it. After some edits, it became what it is today. Will probably come back to it and organize it better soon.

**Finding The Machine:** My highest rated article on here. Working on this was a complete joy. It was part of the 2013 New Years Contest, under the 'Unfounded' cannon, and let me tell you: Working with those guys was a joy. Clef, Photosynthetic, and Pig_catapult were all just so helpful, and fun to work with. It was a great experiance all around, and I thank them for that. Us winning was just the cherry on top.

**SCP-1294:** My personal favorite SCP that I've written. I first posted this a while back, but it didn't go over so well. Not enough to go by... But then, like, a month after its deleteion, I spontaniously said "MAKE IT A FUNGUS" while in the shower, and worked on it from there.

Made more sense, and I got to go into squick, which was fun, but hard not to overdo. I even watched a video of a dead fox get eaten by a fungal colony so I could describe the Fennec Fox exposure log more vividly. Pretty cool stuff... However, I realized something, which I will go into on the next one.

**This Page:** Well, one of my goals here was to work myself up enough to finally get one of these; not so much to describe my 'Nom de Plume', but to both have a hub containing all the pages I've written, have an easily accessable link to my sandbox, and to give thanks to you all for writting. You guys are great, and you should feel great.

Looking at my SCPs and my tales, I've noticed that my tales not only rank marginally better than my SCPs, I also had a bit more fun writting them... Though granted, I only had one tale up, but it seemed that way nonetheless. It was always the tone, and my need to operate in chronological order for me, and I hypothezized that if I wrote tales, that wouldn't be much of a problem. I decided to test this, and well... I was right.

**Capone:** My favorite tale I've written. Finding the Machine was a great experience, but I think this trumps it in terms of content. I was truely inspired by SCP-1471. It was just a great SCP. I just HAD to write something about it. I've always wanted to write a 'Heartwarming' article on here, so I'm pretty happy that I got that goal completed as well. I also find SCP-1471-A adorable, in case you haven't guessed.

+ OPERATION G.Y.A.P.O.K.

[[image http://www.scp-wiki.net/local--files/dr-fantem-s-personnel-file/.GYAPOK]]

**Mission Statement**: Operation Grab Your Ankles and Prepare for Our Kitten (AKA: Operation G.Y.A.P.O.K) is a initiative founded by Dr. Fantem to increase the productivity, life-span, and the general moral of all staff within site 19 through a radio station (G.Y.A.P.O.K FM), which can be only be accessed from foundation-issued mobile devices. While on-air, an auditory, mind-affecting agent will be spread to staff via white-noise.

This agent contains the following properties:
* A substantial increase of productivity and happiness in all listeners while exposed.
* A marked 10% increase in intellectual and creative thinking while exposed.
* A minor compulsion to follow staff protocol and procedures.
* Upon three hours of constant exposure, staff will display class-2 addictive tendencies towards the agent.

No harmful effects have been found, save for irritation, chronic head-aches, and insomnia when not exposed to the agent for periods longer than four days. Aside from obvious benefits in productivity, it is predicted that rouge agents will decrease in number and/or become largely unproductive.

Upon retirement, a custom counter-agent will be given to staff members in the form of a parting gift, labeled //'G.Y.A.P.O.K FM's greatest hits'//. To ensure that no duplicates are created, this counter-agent is specifically designated for the retiree, and will not work on others who have been affected.

> **Okay for realz:** This is a place to just give a bit of a shout-out to some of my favorite scips, in the form of assigning them a song. If a SCP of yours isn't on here, don't feel bad about it, I'm only one man. :P So yah, with that out of the way, enjoy!
> 
> PS: If my choices don't make sense to you, I apologize. The blame can be placed on either my own personal experiences that influenced my decision, or my own brain's idiosyncrasies.
