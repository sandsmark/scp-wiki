**Item #:** SCP-4601

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment efforts are focused on limiting knowledge of SCP-4601's existence from the general public. 

Current objectives of containment are to guide SCP-4601 away from densely populated areas with controlled fires in designated locations secluded from public view. 

Any witnesses to SCP-4601's anomalous behavior are to be administered amnestics appropriate to degree of exposure.

##blue| Note: //These Procedures are scheduled to be updated, pending full assessment of the results of Operation B (See Addendum 4601-3).//##

**Description:** SCP-4601 is an American-manufactured quint fire engine. Barring minor cosmetic damage (deep gouges in paint, minor dents and scrapes on front and rear bumpers, a pronounced scratch on the surface of the left windshield, etc.), SCP-4601 is in good operating condition and bears no significant physical differences from similar firefighting vehicles.

SCP-4601 displays sapient behaviour. It is capable of complete autonomous operation, both vehicular and of attached firefighting apparatus. It is also able to speak, which it does in a gruff masculine tone. Primary behaviour consists of driving circuitously around the streets of New York until it locates an actively burning fire. Upon locating any instance of an open flame,[[footnote]] SCP-4601 makes no distinction between controlled burning or legitimate fire emergencies. [[/footnote]] SCP-4601 will aggressively douse the source of the fire with water from an inbuilt deluge gun.

**Addendum 4601-1: Initial Discovery**

SCP-4601 came to the Foundation's attention on the evening of October 24, 2009; following an incident which took place on the set of "█████ ████████", a competitive cooking-based television program. During the taping of an episode, SCP-4601 appeared and caused a public disturbance along with major property damage. Camera footage recovered from the set recorded the entire incident.

Agents from Mobile Task Force Pi-1 ("City Slickers") responded to the incident; however SCP-4601 had already left the scene and could not be located in the area. All witnesses were amnesticised and a cover story involving a drunk driver was fabricated to account for structural damages.

**Addendum 2: Follow-up Investigations**

A number of 911 Emergency Dispatch calls over the following hours were resolved under irregular circumstances. Firefighting crews attending active fire calls reported that, upon arriving on-scene, the fires were already extinguished. No other firehouses were found to have dispatched any response to the calls in question.

Analysing the locations of these incidents, MTF Pi-1 was able to establish an approximate boundary for the ongoing SCP-4601 activity. A plan was enacted to draw SCP-4601 into contact.

> **Foreword:** A trashfire was set in a discrete alleyway near the central point of SCP-4601 activity. Agent Rodney was designated to interact with SCP-4601 and attempt to elicit as much information as possible.

> 
> //(Flashing red and white lights illuminate the walls of the alleyway. A firetruck's siren whoops erratically. SCP-4601 approaches the fire.)//
> 
> **SCP-4601:** Well well, at least this blaze knows its place: in the damn trash! Scum.
> 
> //(SCP-4601 maneuvers its hose toward the trash can.)//
> 
> **SCP-4601:** I've been tracking down so many fires, and yet the trail's getting colder than ever. Well listen up, candle-jackass, this is your one chance: Give up the rest of the Inferno Gang, and I just might take it easy on you.
> 
> //(SCP-4601 stays silent for 9 seconds.)//
> 
> **SCP-4601:** Yeah, well you aren't the first one to try that line on me. If I don't hear a lead on Big Burns in the next ten seconds, I'm gonna put you out of your stinking misery.
> 
> //(At this point Agent Rodney was instructed to intervene. He leaps from an alcove with a fire extinguisher.)//
> 
> **SCP-4601:** Huh? Citizen, what are you-
> 
> //(Agent Rodney sprays the fire extinguisher into the trashcan until the flames are put out. Agent Rodney places the fire extinguisher on the ground and turns to face SCP-4601.)//
> 
> **Agent Rodney:** The only good fire is a dead fire.
> 
> **SCP-4601:** I had that under control, citizen; but I needed them to talk. How am I going to get my shot at the Infernals at this rate?
> 
> **Agent Rodney:** You're talking to these fires? To find out about 'The Infernals'?
> 
> **SCP-4601:** What do you know about the Inferno Gang?
> 
> **Agent Rodney:** Um... Well, I'm uh... I'm not sure if it's the same guys you're talking about. I don't even know who you are.
> 
> **SCP-4601:** I am... **The Redd Mennace!**
> 
> //(SCP-4601 beams its lights and revs its engine.)//
> 
> **Agent Rodney:** 'The Red Menace'?
> 
> **SCP-4601:** Yeah, but it's spelled different. Or just call me **Bigg Redd!**
>

> 
> //(Agent Rodney flexes his bicep.)//
> 
> //(Silence.)//
> 
> **SCP-4601:** You said you knew something about the Infernals.
> 
> **Agent Rodney:** Well hang on, I said I'm not sure. Can you describe these ones you're after?
> 
> **SCP-4601:** If what you just showed me was sincere, then you must know without a doubt. These ones I'm talking about are the monsters who have been putting the Big Apple on a spit roast, and she can't take anymore! People's property, their homes, their very lives - all swallowed up without mercy or remorse, thanks to that damned Mr. Burns. But on that one night... it became personal. Lines were crossed!
> 
> **Agent Rodney:** Um, huh?
> 
> **SCP-4601:** Oh, I'll tell you about it... First there was the time before, when things were good. Me and my brothers would go out into the streets, everyone always wanted to see us. Sometimes there was dangerous stuff happening, but they were always relieved when we showed up, we made them feel better. 
> 
> **Agent Rodney:** Do you mean... were your family members fire trucks?
> 
> **SCP-4601:** What the hell kind of question is that? Pipe down and let me talk. They were people, some of the best I've ever known. Now all of them... all of that is in the past.
> 
> //(A single bead of wiper fluid trickles down the windshield of SCP-4601)//
> 
> **Agent Rodney:** Please, can you tell me what happened?
> 
> **SCP-4601:** It was an ambush by the Inferno Gang. Me and my brothers were just coming home to a delicious meal everyone was all looking forward to. But they got to us - Mr. Burns himself, right where we lived! And there was nothing I could do about it... I was helpless at that time.
> 
> **Agent Rodney:** But, were they okay?
> 
> **SCP-4601:** They died! All of them, gone! That's why I have to work alone now. Perhaps something changed in me that night... But now I must carry on our struggle for them. I have to make sure Mr. Burns won't hurt anyone else like this.
> 
> **Agent Rodney:** Well hey, I could help! The organization I'm with, they're powerful. You'd just need to come back with me to-
> 
> **SCP-4601:** Oh, no no no. Look, I don't want to come back to your boy scout clubhouse and meet your super cool pals, okay? This is dangerous stuff I'm doing out here. Others need to just stay out of my way.
> 
> **Agent Rodney:** It's not like that. We really need you to come along to our base here, and it'd be a good thing for you too.
> 
> **SCP-4601:** I'm not interested in 'good'! This is something I have to do, and I am going to do it. On my own!
> 
> **Agent Rodney:** You don't get it, I've got to take you back. Like, this has to happen. So don't make things hard and nobody has to get hurt-
> 
> //(Members of MTF Pi-1 move to box in SCP-4601 in the alleyway. SCP-4601 blares its airhorn and drives away, forcing itself through two Foundation cars and injuring three Field Agents in the process.)//
> 
> //(Pursuit of SCP-4601 from the scene was a failure.)//

Subsequent investigation of this information led a Field Agent to the quarters of FDNY Squad ██. It was revealed that an accidental grease fire had previously occurred in the kitchen of the firehouse, but it was extinguished without any serious injuries. While the firefighters were distracted by that situation, however, one of their firetrucks had apparently been stolen from the garage and was still missing.

Notably, these events would have taken place in the hours just prior to the first documented appearance of SCP-4601.

**Addendum 3: Establishing Comprehensive Containment**

The relevant Foundation authorities concluded that immediately achieving complete physical containment of SCP-4601 was the most appropriate course of action.

> 
> **Agent Polk:** Hey, move it here!  We got it riding our asses; gotta put some clearance between us first, to make that turn on the throughway.
> 
> **Agent Tran:** Hey this is Spot-4 here, we're gonna end up merging before the park ahead. We can try and make that space for you.

> 
> **Agent Rodney:** Whoa! It just crashed right there! Spot-6 is closing, standby all.
> 
> //(SCP-4601 has become high-centred on the concrete barrier. Its wheels spin without gaining traction on the ground. The engine can be heard revving loudly.)//

> **SCP-4601:** Why then? Why this backstabbing trap; why did you do this to me, when I thought you felt the same about fires as I do?
> 
> **Agent Rodney:** No, it's not like that. There's.. there's more to this than you understand.

> **SCP-4601:** So, I let my brothers down. I failed...

> **SCP-4601:** So what?
> 
> **Agent Rodney:** So we've talked to the people. They spoke of the good you did. That you were right there when they needed your help. That you... you made things better for them.
> 
> **SCP-4601:** Maybe… maybe I never was going to stop Mr. Burns after all. I guess me and my brothers never did before either; we didn't think about all that then. We just handled everything that came our way. Maybe that's all there is to it, really… Maybe that's just the best that anyone can do.
