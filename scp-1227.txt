**Item #:** SCP-1227

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** 
SCP-1227 is to be kept in a concrete chamber 30m X 30m X 5m, only assessable through a double airlock system. All researchers wishing to investigate SCP-1227 must don regulation biohazard suits with an enclosed onboard oxygen supply. The chamber contains a 20m-wide red circle painted on the floor, henceforth referred to as the ‘safe zone’. Before Airlock D is opened, SCP-1227 will be instructed to move to the center of the safe zone. It should be noted that SCP-1227 is relativly docile and will usually submit to these requests, however it’s co-operation should not be taken for granted and Airlock D will not be opened until it is fully within the safe zone. Due to SCP-1227 passive nature and severely limited mobility, safety outside the safe zone is usually assured. Under no circumstances should any personnel or other biological material enter the safe zone, or engage in physical contact with SCP-1227.

 **Description:** It is believed that SCP-1227 was formerly Yuri Seryogin, a political prisoner of the USSR, arrested in 1957 for pro-democracy leanings.  Parts of SCP-1227’s extended body have also been positively identified. Scars on the face of SCP-1227-E have been matched to photographs of Aleksey █████, a known associate of SCP-1227. SCP-1227-B is believed to be the trunk and head of SCP-1227’s wife, by his own admission. The remaining parts of SCP-1227’s mass remain unidentified. 

Documents obtained by the Foundation after the collapse of the Soviet Union have revealed that SCP-1227 is the indirect result of a Russian social experiment conducted by ███ ████████ during the heavy winter of 1960. Six political prisoners including Yuri Seryogin as well as Aleksey and Yuri’s wife, were lead into the depths of an unidentified cave by the KGB as an experiment into group dynamics under stress. The prisoners were provided with a food supply but no light. After 5 days of relatively normal social functioning, the group descended into two groups, leading to three further days of incoherent screaming, muttering, torture, rape and ████████. On the final day of the experiment, the KGB researchers heard some ‘extremely disturbing’ sounds over the concealed microphones, including screaming, pleading, vomiting and [DATA REDACTED].

The team sent to observe the prisoners discovered a large amount of decomposing human tissue in a liquified state, with SCP-1227 having formed in the center of it, apparently in good physical and mental health, failing to notice anything amiss with it's new situation.   
 The Foundation was notified and SCP-1227 was extracted from the USSR by Mobile Task Force Epsilon-█

SCP-1227 appears to be a male figure bonded to the heavily disfigured bodies of nine people by a red, web-like substance confirmed to be SCP-1227’s own muscles, and heavily developed extrusions of SCP-1227 respiratory and digestive tracts. Touching SCP-1227 will lead to the bonding process being initiated. Firstly, the victim will fall into a coma-like state, whatever part of the body that contacted the creature being fused there. Then SCP-1227 will permanently bond the victim’s body to its own by extruding its own blood vessels and nerves into the victim’s body. Finally, the SCP-1227 will take control one or more of the victim’s vital systems by knitting that system into its own, with its own nerves/blood vessels/ intestines. Any part of the victim not associated with this system will lose blood flow and eventually drop off. SCP-1227 will feed any limbs that drop off into the beginning of its extended digestive tract, a hole in the chest of SCP-1227-D. The heart has always kept alive to pump blood around the vastly extended body.

Experimental data suggests that this combination of multiple organ systems has greatly increased SCP-1227's biological efficency, allowing it to survive on extremely limited resources. One observed effect is that SCP-1227 urniary tract is now three times longer than normal and so efficient that SCP-1227-F is now observed to deposit roughly 60g of pure urea every three years. SCP-1227-A and SCP-1227-C have had their respiratory tracts connected to SCP-1227, meaning that he can process air so effectively that SCP-1227 can survive for up to six months in a complete vacuum, at cost of falling into a hibernation-like state. A full breakdown of SCP-1227’s bodily systems follows-

(Unless stated otherwise, all victims are USSR political prisoners)

**SCP-1227-A**. Unidentified male. Connected to SCP-1227 by 1.5 meters of esophagus/ blood vessels. Legs have dropped off. Arms still mobile, used to propel SCP-1227’s mass. 
**SCP-1227-B**. Unidentified female. Connected to SCP-1227 back by extruded muscle. Only trunk and head remain, all other limbs removed. Her womb has [DATA REDACTED]. Pupils will contract in response to high intensity light sources.
**SCP-1227-C** Unidentified male. Connected to SCP-1227 by 0.8 meters of esophagus/blood vessels. All limbs removed. Mouth will occasionally gape widely, for unknown reasons.
**SCP-1227-D**. KGB researcher ██████. Connected to SCP-1227 by 0.5 meters of intestines. Head and limbs removed. Serves as beginning of digestive tract, all food placed directly into the stomach via hole in the chest. 
**SCP-1227-E** Aleksey █████. Connected to SCP-1227 by extruded muscle. Only head, trunk and legs remain, used only to help mobilize SCP-1227. 
**SCP-1227-F**. Unidentified male. Connected to SCP-1227-G by 2 meters of urinary tract.  Only trunk and right arm remain. Used to process urine and mobilize SCP-1227.
**SCP-1227-G** Unidentified male KGB researcher. Connected to SCP-1227 by 3 meters of digestive tract. Only trunk and right leg remain. Serves as end of digestive system.
**SCP-1227-H** Foundation male D-class personnel D-███-██. Connected to SCP-1227 by ██████████ as well as extended brain stem. Only head and heart remain. 
**SCP-1227-I** Foundation test canine. Connected to SCP-1227 by 5 meters of extruded nervous system. Only head and front legs remain. SCP-1227 claims it is a ‘precaution’ for ‘self-defense’. Will often crawl to the limit of its connection to bark and whine at researchers. Seems to be outside SCP-1227’s control. 

//I really wish we hadn’t tested if the effect also works on animals, but now I expect you to honor ‘safe-zone’ protocol more than ever, until we find away to amputate the damn thing. O5-█.//

Despite the changes SCP-1227 has undergone, his mental health appears adequate. SCP-1227 has been successfully taught English to a sufficently advanced degree. Psychoanalysis showed no signs of cognitive defects, and average intelligence and reasoning. SCP-1227 is permitted books and other entertainment at Lead Researcher Sarah Townsend’s discretion, as well as daily visits from ‘friends’ selected for him by the research staff. He will often talk about his upbringing and stories from his job as a factory worker. However SCP-1227 appears to harbor well-developed delusions, often claiming that SCP-1227 A-H are ‘children’ playing peacefully nearby, and also that SCP-1227-D’s stomach is an ‘oven’. On one occasion, SCP-1227 complained of feeling ‘hungry’. Minutes later he grabbed an unwary D-Class personnel and mostly tore him apart, feeding the carcass into SCP-1227-D. Afterwards he bonded what remained to his biomass, becoming SCP-1227-H. Appeared to be under the impression that he was ‘preparing a feast’ for his ‘family’ the whole time. 

One major breakthrough came when SCP-1227 admitted that the serious puncture wounds to both its eyes were self-inflicted, possibly in an attempt to escape the horror of its situation.

All attempts at therapy have failed; the subject appears to be in a well-developed denial system, often becoming aggressive and frustrated when therapists tell him they cannot see his seven playing children, or his devoted wife.  All attempts to get SCP-1227 to elaborate on the events inside the cave, or how he acquired these new abilities, are typically met with sudden staring, drawing it’s body parts around it, and falling silent for 2-4 months. 

**Addendum:** 

**13/06/1978**- Well, it’s been over 18 years now, and It’s time to admit it- SCP-1227 is not ageing. We have suspected this for some time, but the extra efficiency his ‘children’ have brought him seems to be extending his lifespan by decades. I’m requesting we set up long-term protocols in regard to SCP-1227’s mental health and wellbeing. –Dr. Shearer. 

**14/07/1985**- Today SCP-1227 defecated through SCP-1227-G for the first time in 25 years, a bean sized nugget of pure ██████████ ██████which contained DNA from over 18 different sources. Analysis ongoing.
 
**09/02/1991**- We are attempting to get [[[SCP-294]]] to manufacture a truth drug for SCP-1227. Maybe we can finally shed some light on its origins. Attempting use tomorrow.

**10/02/1991**- [DATA EXPUNGED]

//I think I speak for all of us when I say we are NEVER trying this again. –O5-█//.
