**Item #:** SCP-1121

**Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** Only two (2) specimens have been collected of SCP-1121, both at initial containment. These are kept in one of Bio Site-13's refrigerated biohazard containment cells in a freezing medium composed of 12% dimethylsulphoxide, 20% heat inactivated calf serum and axenic medium at minus seventy (-70) degrees Celsius.

Cultures of SCP-1121-1 are kept in a glycerol stock under identical temperatures in a separate refrigerated biohazard containment cell. 

Due to the rarity of SCP-1121 samples, tests are to use cultures SCP-1121-1 instead. Testing is to be authorized and conducted by at least one (1) level 4 member of on-site research staff. All personnel not designated a test subject are to wear Level A Hazmat suits with SCBA[[footnote]] Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus [[/footnote]] before handling any cultures of SCP-1121-1. Failure to do so will result in termination and subsequently incineration.

Should infections with SCP-1121-1 be reported outside of Foundation control, a quarantine is to be instated within a ten (10) kilometer radius of the established epicenter. All victims not yet deceased are to be terminated followed by controlled incineration of all bodies. Seemingly uninfected civilians and personnel within the quarantine zone will be detained and monitored. If they develop no symptoms after twenty-four (24) hours, they are to be administered class-A amnesiacs and relocated. Any individuals that do develop symptoms within that time period are to be terminated and incinerated. A suitable cover story will be circulated to the media.

**Description:**  SCP-1121 is a previously unknown amoeboid protozoa with very specific mutagenic qualities triggered only by //Staphylococcus epidermidis//, a normally benign bacterium present on human skin. If introduced to other organism, SCP-1121 remains dormant. DNA extracted from samples of SCP-1121 shares genes with several insect species, such as //Afrocimex constrictus//, //Gryllotalpa brachyptera// and //Doru aculeatum// while also containing several genes not currently found in known flora or fauna. SCP-1121 does not seem to procreate naturally and does not need fluid to survive.

Once introduced to //S. epidermidis// SCP-1121 mutates all instances of the bacteria into SCP-1121-1 (classified as //Staphylococcus epidermidis exitiabilis//) before dying. At this point, a subject is considered infected and will start to show stage 1 symptoms as detailed below. Note that, while //S. epidermidis// does not normally cause infection in healthy human beings, the SCP-1121-1 pathogen infects 100% of subjects exposed to it. SCP-1121 dies off after creating SCP-1121-1.

SCP-1121-1 has proven resistant to all known antibiotics and at this time no known cure for infections with //Staphylococcus epidermidis exitiabilis// exists, although theoretically the application of [[[SCP-500]]] should have the expected result. As of yet, authorization of tests to confirm or deny this has not been granted.

||||~ ^^An infection with SCP-1121-1 in stage 3^^ ||
[[/div]]

A subject infected with SCP-1121-1 goes through a set number of stages:

Stage 1: Two (2) to five (5) hours after initial infection small white lesions appear on the skin. This does not differ from infection by //S. epidermidis//, making wrong diagnoses a distinct possibility.

Stage 2: Approximately twenty-four (24) hours after the on-set of stage 1, the lesions will gradually begin to disappear, the infection having spread to the lower layers of the patient's skin. SCP-1121-1 then consumes the subcutaneous tissue, transforming it into a highly viscous substance. This process is extremely painful. The sufferer's skin is at this point connected to underlying tissues only by the substance excreted by SCP-1121-1. In addition it turns pale and slouches in areas, as if the patient has rapidly lost weight.

Stage 3: Patients begin removing their skin from their body. Most sufferers using their own hands for skinning, though in some cases patients resorted to using various tools including knives, windshield scrapers and in one case a [REDACTED]. This process seems to be painless due to the events of stage 2 and does not seem to be a conscious activity. When the anomalous substance underneath the skin is exposed to air, it gradually [DATA EXPUNGED] commonly found on insects. Victims rapidly become disoriented and invariably hostile to anyone not infected by SCP-1121-1 as the process of skin removal progresses. In light of this, termination of all victims is necessary, preferably before the disease enters stage 3.

No occurrences of SCP-1121 have been observed outside of initial containment, but the bacterium replicates itself rapidly during stages 1 and 2. Infection of new patients occurs primarily by skin-to-skin contact, though infections have also been observed to spread where no direct contact was observed, making level A Hazmat equipment a precautionary must when handling any samples of SCP-1121-1. Furthermore, SCP-1121-1 has been observed to remain active long after stage 3 has concluded, with samples of skin showing active cultures of the mutated bacteria for up to ██ years after initial infection. It is currently unknown during what period of time removed skin remains an infection hazard.

**Addendum 1121-1:** SCP-1121 was discovered on a meteorite unearthed during an archeological dig in ██████, New Mexico in 19██. The archeologist first exposed to the meteorite was infected with SCP-1121-1 and is at this point considered to be patient zero. Within two days the infection had spread from patient zero to the entire on-site research team and several citizens of ██████. Initial containment was managed by the CDC, but after patient zero entered stage 3 of the disease, operatives within that agency brought in the Foundation. The meteorite and patient zero were transferred to Bio Site-13 and all land in a ten kilometer radius around the dig site was cleared using Mk 77 bombs.

The only known colonies of SCP-1121 were recovered from the meteorite. Mass spectrometer analysis using rubidium-strontium dating of samples taken from the meteorite determined its age to be approximately 2,500,200,000 years.

**Addendum 1121-3:** 

> //You know like when you were a kid? You'd dig out the ants' nest and step on the biggest one just to see them all run around like little maniacs? They reminded me of that...the way they just...stumbled around flailing.// - Research Assistant █████████.

**Addendum 1121-4:** 

> //After 1121-T-5, it's been theorized that SCP-1121 could be part of a terraforming experiment. If that is the case, one is left to wonder just what it was supposed to turn us into. If it's even us they were after.// - Dr. ███████.
