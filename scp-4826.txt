**Item #:** SCP-4826

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4826 has been placed on suicide watch upon its recovery by the Foundation. To better accommodate this, SCP-4826 is kept in Humanoid Cell 2208.

**Description:** SCP-4826 is 31-year-old Ethan Elra, a male substitute teacher from La Crosse, Wisconsin. SCP-4826 is unable to die, although this has only been supported by evidence found during recovery and has yet to be confirmed by direct observation. Confirmation testing has been scheduled for ##blue|June 17th, 2019##.

SCP-4826 was recovered by implanted Foundation agents in local law enforcement on June 12th, 2019, after three calls from apartment residents claiming to have heard multiple gunshots from SCP-4826's apartment. Upon arrival, it was reported that the room SCP-4826 was found in had  flesh and viscera on the furniture, floor, and walls.[[footnote]]Collected samples are a genetic match with SCP-4826[[/footnote]] SCP-4826 had been sitting against a wall with a gun nearby and a knife lodged in its chest.

Examination of SCP-4826 shows evidence of multiple bullet wounds, stab wounds, and incisions in various parts of its body in the form of scar tissue. SCP-4826 claims that the scars are new and confirmed that they had been self-inflicted before discovery.

> **Test #:** 0
> 
> **Purpose:** To confirm the anomaly present in SCP-4826.
> 
> **Procedure:** Apply lethal injection of potassium chloride, conducted by Dr. Alan Danica with Dr. Madison Tell witnessing.
> 
> **Results:** SCP-4826 initially struggled, exhibiting distress at the sight of the syringe and verbally expressing a fear of needles. Restraints were adjusted and the procedure was conducted normally.
> 
> After successful application, SCP-4826 was unresponsive for five hours.

As SCP-4826 did not willingly comply to confirmation testing, the current supported theory is that SCP-4826 was immune to suicide. Neutralized classification is currently pending.
