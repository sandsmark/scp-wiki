**Item #:** SCP-2894

**Object Class:** Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** Remaining public records of the existence of SCP-2894 have been successfully discredited as volcanic pumice rafts as per Disinformation Protocol 2894-34A. No Special Containment Procedures are necessary at this time.

**Description:** SCP-2894 is a nonexistent island located in the French territory of New Caledonia, at coordinates 19.22 S, 159.93 E. Records of SCP-2894's existence date back to 1774, when the island was first charted by Captain James Cook. The next public record of SCP-2894 dates to 1876, when the whaling vessel //Velocity// encountered the island. At that time, the island was surrounded by a wide beach, and thus was given the name Sandy Island. According to all available physical evidence, SCP-2894 does not exist, and has never existed.

Information pertaining to SCP-2894 is widespread, although the most sensitive data exists only in the Foundation database[[footnote]]As far as we are aware.[[/footnote]].

**Item #:** SCP-██3█

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** All attempts to seal or otherwise neutralize SCP-██3█ have proven ineffective. Implementation of Procedure Metatron-13 is now authorized.

**Description:** SCP-██3█ is an interdimensional anomaly located in an undersea cave system at the base of █████ Island, New Caledonia (coordinates ██.22 █, █5█.██ E). A spatial aperture within the cave leads to the floor of an extraterrestrial ocean, suspected to be [REDACTED]. Water is currently flowing through the aperture from the other side at a rate of ███,███ m^^3^^/s. The water originating on the far side of the aperture is non-anomalous and contains no traces of biological life, although its mean temperature is █ degrees cooler than the ocean surrounding █████ Island.

Timeline of SCP-██3█ discovery and attempted containment procedures:

||~ Time Reference||~ Remarks||
||0█.1964||Oceanographers report temperature anomalies in the region of New Caledonia. Embedded Foundation operatives begin investigation when no natural cause seems plausible.||
||09.1964||Foundation oceanographers isolate source of anomaly at █████ Island. Containment perimeter established. At this point, the flow rate of SCP-██3█ is stable at approximately █,███ m^^3^^/s. Plans for exploration begin.||
||01.1967||A specialized robotic probe is deployed to explore the anomaly. Despite the heavily modified [REDACTED] turbine engines it is equipped with, the probe is unable to overcome the pressurized outflow and fails to enter the anomaly. ||
||05.196█||Global sea level rise caused by SCP-██3█ is noted by scientists worldwide. Disinformation Protocol ██████████ is instituted to exaggerate the effects of climate change-induced ice melting to account for the discrepancy. Attempted neutralization of SCP-██3█ discussed, but tabled until more information can be acquired.||
||09.1971||A second robotic probe is completed and deployed to explore SCP-██3█. The probe succeeds in entering the anomaly, but is immediately destroyed. Analysis of probe's sensor telemetry indicates that it was crushed by oceanic pressure in excess of ███ MPa. Ocean depth beyond the anomaly estimated at least 3█,5██ m. Projections indicate that the pressure differential between the opposite side of SCP-██3█ and Earth's oceans will not equalize until all land on Earth is submerged under at least ████ m of water. SCP-██3█ upgraded to keter classification; attempts at neutralization authorized by O5 council.||
||█1.19█4||Foundation engineers attempt to seal SCP-██3█ with 600,0█0 metric tons of [REDACTED] alloy, obtained via [DATA EXPUNGED]. Procedure is seemingly effective.||
||02.1975||The seal on SCP-██3█ explosively fails, releasing over ██,███,███ m^^3^^ within a period of █ seconds. Site ██3█ and all personnel currently stationed there are lost. A tsunami is triggered, causing heavy property damage to areas in Australia and New Zealand. Disinformation campaign successfully attributes the event to an earthquake.||
||03.1975||Containment of SCP-██3█ re-established. Containment failure analyzed and attributed to mounting pressure exceeding the seal's structural tolerance. Flow rate of the anomaly has now increased to ██,███ m^^3^^.||
||07.1█77||All further attempts to neutralize SCP-██3█ have met with failure. Global sea level rise has completely inundated Holland, Bangladesh, and many other low-lying territories. Plausibility of climate change cover story increasingly called into question by global media.||
||03.1979||A series of ██ megaton thermonuclear demolition charges are fired into SCP-██3█ with the use of a supercavitating subsurface electromagnetic accelerator cannon[[footnote]]No such device is currently known to the Foundation[[/footnote]] in an attempt to collapse the passage from the other side. The warheads cross the dimensional threshold and detonate, but only serve to exacerbate the problem. Flow rate increases to its current value of ███,███ m^^3^^/s.||
||04.█979||Radioactive contamination due to failed neutralization attempt is widespread across the Pacific Ocean. Sea level rise now exceeds projected maximum of total worldwide glacial melting by ███%. The nature of SCP-██3█ remains unknown to the general public, but its widespread effects can no longer be plausibly explained.||
||04.1981||Global sea level rise now exceeds 1██ m. ██% of Earth's former land area is now submerged. Enactment of Procedure Metatron-13 authorized by O5 council.||

**Item #:** SCP-███

**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-███ is to be ██████ at the ██mary Project M███████ research facility located in ████████, ██████████. Knowledge of SCP-███'s existence must remain limited to ███████ ████████ members and the O5 council. SCP-███ is not to be activated without unanimous approval from the O5 council.

**Description:** SCP-███ is the designation for the most advanced prototype device yet developed by Project Metatron[[footnote]]No such Foundation project exists[[/footnote]]. Project Metatron was initiated in 19██ ██ an ████████ ██ the Foundation's Temporal Research Department, with the intention of developing a means to ███████████████ ███████ otherwise uncontainable keter-class █████████ from the space-time continuum.

Utilizing resources ██tained from ███████, ████████, and SCP-████, combined with ██ categorized anomalous █████ and theories crafted by Dr. ██████████ (see Foundation Research Journal ████ █ ████)[[footnote]]The identity of this document cannot be ascertained due to data loss[[/footnote]], a █████-time 'scalpel' was created, █████ ██ capable of partially ███████ physical objects and locations ████ █████-████.

Initial research concluded that ███████ █████ not be 100% effective. If a target were totally removed fr██ s███e-████, █████ █████ never have been any reason to use SCP-███ on ████ target ██ ███ █████ █████, ████████ █ recursive paradoxical loop. T█████o█e, it was ██████████ ████, ██ order for SCP-███ to be fulfill its intended function, ████ evidence of the target's █████████ ████ always remain after its rem██al. As SCP-███ was primarily created to █████ physical anomalies, experimental ███████ ████████ █████████ procedures have been applied ██ ███████ ██ shift the probability vector of ███ █████ ███████ remnant towards information as opposed to p██sical evidence. In addition, simulations indicate a █████ likelihood that SCP-███ will e███ itself along with its target, as well as ██████████ ███████ ██ ███████ ██████ ██ causal collateral damage. Research to fix these fla█s is on█████.

**Addendum ███-1** on ██/██/██, O5-█ requested the deployment of SCP-███ for the purpose of neutralizing SCP-██3█.

Response from Project Metatron Site Director ███ █████:

//Pl██se, █ beg of ███ ██ reconsider. ███, █ ██ fully aware of the threat posed by SCP-██3█, ██ Project Metat██n ██ far from complete. ██ ███████ ███████ ██████ called for a '███████ scalpel', ███ ███ prototype ██ ████ ██ ████ akin ██ a sledgehammer. Imagine ██████ ███ ██ █ heavy pane of glass - █████ ██████ destroy the part you hit, ███ █████ also create a pattern of cracks ████ ████ █████ across the glass and compromise its overall structural integrity. ██ █ worst-case scen████, ███ ████ █████ █████ ██████ ██ the entire space-time continuum. ████ ██ ███ anomaly is successfully terminated, ██ can't predict who or what might be ██████ along with it, ███ ██ ███ ████████ instability of spacelike traj███ories ███████ of lo███ light cones. ███ ██████ Foundation might cease to e█ist, ███████████ pro███████ ██ other keter-level anomalies █████ ██ breached, h█story █████ ██ ██tered comple██ly. ██ ███ ████ █████, ██ anticip█te that large am███s of d█ta ████ ██ dele███ ███m the Foundation da██base, ████████ leading to irrecoverable █oss of vital infor█████n █████████ SCP files. █████████ records, ████ ███ated and unrelated to Pro████ Meta████ and SCP-██3█, ████ ██████ ████ exist in a frag███tary state after ██████████. I must insist we ██ █████ ████ ████ ██ refine SCP-███ before f████ deployment.//

From 05-█ to Project Metatron Site Director  ███ █████:

//██ ██████ ██ have no more time. SCP-██3█ must b█ sto█p██ if the huma█ ████ ██ ██ surv███. The █5 Cou████ ███ █████ their unanimous approval - enact Proc███e ████tron-1█.//
