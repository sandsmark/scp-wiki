**Item #:** SCP-1207

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** 
> //Carrero, I operate an entire containment facility. I have more things on my plate than requisitioning the construction of an entire containment unit for another damn miror. Put it with all of the others, and stop wasting my time. - ████████//

With the full permission of Site Director ████████, SCP-1207 is placed in joint containment with several other objects in the mirors wing at Site 29. Personnel who intend to enter the containment unit are  to be made aware of SCP-1207's effects, and are encouraged to attend a voluntary therapeutic session with Site Psychologist Doctor Warrim to discuss any negative body image  issues that may manifest as a result of exposure. Due to the low risk nature of the object, no further containment is deemed necessary by Director ████████ at this time.

**Description:** SCP-1207 is a miror approximately one meter by one half meter in size, in a white wooden frame painted with pink and red hearts. Using the Kinscale method of miror-type object evaluation, Foundation scientists have established it as a minor level psychological threat. 

SCP-1207 was discovered in a storage unit facility in [REDACTED]ed as a workspace by members of the loose collective currently identified as "Are We Cool Yet?". It is theorized that SCP-1207 was to form the basis of an unfinished installation. Notes left by the artist indicate that the completed installation was "a rumination on the essence of how the ways we see ourselves shape what we are". Unfortunately, the artist attempted to escape and was killed by special agent Hornsby during the raid.

Exposure to SCP-1207 causes short term body image and/or personal identity issues. Subjects may see themselves as "too fat", "too thin", or simply "wrong". Subjects may also develop uncertainty regarding their familial status and "place in the scheme of things [sic]". These psychological developments are minor, and can be easily corrected through therapy and in very few cases, short term medication. It has been theorized that long term exposure to the miror would lead to the development of more serious issues and possibly permanent mental illness, however, the low priority nature of the object makes long term testing unlikely as a Foundation goal.

**Addendum 1207-1:**
> //I have a feeling there's more to this one than is apparent. With your permission, I'd like to expand testing of the miror to include both long term exposure and cross nullification testing with other SCP objects. I think we could get some good data from this one regarding the methods AWCY uses in the creation of their objects if we looked at it as more than just another useless object. -Carrera//

> //Denied. I already told you, Carrera, this facility has more important things to worry about than some mad art hack's magic miror. Put the damn thing in storage, and close the notes on it. -████████//

**Addendum 1207-2:** By order of Site Director ████████, no further testing on SCP-1207 will be undertaken at this time.
