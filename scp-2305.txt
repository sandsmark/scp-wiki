**Item #:** SCP-2305

**Object Class:** Safe 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2305 is to be contained in a standard high-value storage locker in Site 68. Once weekly, a Foundation researcher is to record the SCP-2305-A instance currently displayed, and archive it onto a secure Foundation server. SCP-2305-A neutralization methods are not to be attempted without the approval of a member of the O5 Council. 

**Description:** SCP-2305 is a sheaf of US Letter papers, stapled on the top left corner. Written on the front page in black permanent marker are the words "great ideas that are TOTALY [sic] USELESS" in large letters. Below in smaller text and parentheses is the word "lulz"[[footnote]]Corruption of the Internet slang term, "lol", which stands for "Laughing Out Loud"; generally used to express bemusement, mockery, or contempt.[[/footnote]], as well as a crude hand-drawn image of the Foundation's insignia. 

Once weekly, the contents of SCP-2305 will be altered with a new instance of SCP-2305-A. SCP-2305-A is a standard Foundation document, nearly always written with Level 4 clearance or above, which always contains the following: 

1. A description of a potential method by which to neutralize a Euclid or Keter-class SCP object, typically going into great detail as to how, when, and where to execute the neutralization. The SCP objects selected for neutralization have no consistent pattern in origin, location, anomalous properties, or level of danger: SCP objects appear to be selected at random. Attempts to temporarily reclassify SCP objects selected to Safe status have no effect on the documentation. 

2. An incident log detailing an attempt to neutralize the SCP object in the manner described in #1. In all cases, the attempted neutralization will completely fail or otherwise backfire, typically at great cost of personnel and assets to the Foundation. 

3. A brief section following #2 entitled "The moral of the story." This section varies widely in content, ranging on subtle commentaries on the attempted neutralization to anecdotes, pop culture references, or insults directed at the Foundation. 

SCP-2305 has no effect on reality; all documented neutralization attempts appear to be completely fictional. However, if an attempt is made at neutralizing the SCP object subject to 2305-A documentation using the method described, said attempt will fail in a near-identical fashion as described in the 2305-A documentation. Minor variations on the neutralization method have yet to yield successful results, despite numerous attempts; to date, SCP-2305 has yet to provide any useful information on how to neutralize SCP objects. For this reason, testing of SCP-2305-A documentation is generally discouraged. 

**Excerpts From SCP-2305-A Documentation Log**

> **Object Class:** April Fools
> 
> **Proposed Prank Method:** [[*user ObserverSeptember]] would edit SCP-2305's page for one day as an April Fools' joke, attempting to cash in on the Internet's 24 hours of mayhem by bringing attention to a really stupid article he wrote almost three years ago.
> 
> **Result of Prank Attempt:** Joke is not nearly as funny as [[[SCP-3999]]], and the SCP wiki does not find it amusing. [[*user ObserverSeptember]] looks feels like a donkey as he quietly reverts the page the next day and hopes to come up with a better joke next year.
