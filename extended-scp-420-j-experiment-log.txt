**Incident CN-0993-Q:** On 04/08/16, a new episode of "Bobble the Clown" was intercepted.
**Episode Name:** "Bobble Gets Baked"
**Episode Description:** The episode begins with Bobble the Clown sitting on a couch smoking a comically-oversized marijuana cigarette. Instead of the typical clown outfit, Bobble is wearing a Bob Marley t-shirt, a gray hoodie, and pajama bottoms decorated with marijuana leaves. The rest of Bobble's costume-- hat, wig, makeup, nose, gloves, and shoes-- are as typical. The episode is divided into three segments: "How To Roll the Perfect Doobie", "How To Make a Bong Out of Found Materials", and "How To Take Over the Regional Black Market Drug Trade With Ruthless Efficiency". The last segment is by far the longest, and ends with a six-plus-minute montage of Bobble the Clown gunning down drug rivals using a wide variety of powerful firearms.

> //I **told** you clowns are scary as ████!// --Dr. M████
> 
> //Yeah, man, totally. But that clown knows his ████.// --Dr. C████

Sound pressure measurements estimate loudness in excess of 120 dB within ten meters of Interview Room 19, setting off seismic detectors around the site. Witnesses describe the sound as "like a hacking cough, except cacking".

I just lost my ████, man.// --Dr. C████
