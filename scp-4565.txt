**Item #:** SCP-4565

**Object Class**: Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Historical manuals and reference books regarding the Albigensian Crusade are to be acquired and then stored in Warehouse 14-3.

Existing information, online or in academia, concerning the above-mentioned event, is to be analyzed by Foundation historians and adjusted accordingly.  

All historical artifacts or items found in the southern French province of Occitanie are to be assessed for anomalous properties and contained. 

**Description:** SCP-4565 was a 20-year anomalous military campaign that occurred from 1205 to 1225 between Vatican-assisted Crusader Knights and the Cathars of France[[footnote]]Catharism is an offshoot denomination of Christianity that existed from the 12th to 14th centuries that focused on anti-clericalism, anti-materialism, and numerology.[[/footnote]]. The war was instigated by Pope Innocent III, whose aim was to obtain the "keys of the Kingdom of Heaven[[footnote]] Hereafter referred to as SCP-4565-1 [[/footnote]]" which were believed to be in the possession of the five main houses of Carcassonne.


The houses of Carcassonne were led by Duke Raymond V who was headquartered in the former province of Languedoc. The war concluded with the deaths of Viscount Raymond VI of Toulouse and King Peter V of Aragon and the destruction of South Languedoc. 

It is theorized that SCP-4565-1 was obtained by the Knights Templar[[footnote]] A Catholic military order that fought Vatican-deemed heretics throughout the Middle Ages.[[/footnote]], however, with the group's dissolution in 1312, its current location remains unknown. 

This campaign is especially significant due to the conception of various anomalous military organizational techniques that would be recreated by Foundation pre-cursors in later years. The most significant of these would be the concepts of efficient team-based anomaly suppression groups and the utilization of anomalies to combat or suppress other anomalies. 

The former would later eventually develop into "//Rixantes Luce Sacra//" groups[[footnote]] Formalized "MTF"-like containment groups used by Vatican Holy Office for Secrets and Prophecies until 1679. [[/footnote]] and the latter would later be used as historical precedence for the acceptance of the "Thaumiel" object class.

The purpose of SCP-4565-1 has yet to be discovered.

**Documentation**: All primary and secondary source documentation and evidence regarding this SCP was obtained from the Vatican Holy Office for Secrets and Prophecies (//Secretorum Camerus Prophetias//). The veracity of all information about SCP-4565 has yet to be corroborated by any third party reference.

The sources from which the information is provided are written in Middle English or Latin and have been translated to English. The "//sæfernmúða edlæcan//[[footnote]] Sæfernmúða edlæcan roughly translates to "Mouth Repeater" and was an anomalous item used during the campaign to record the voices and dialogues of anti-anomalous Cathari groups in action.[[/footnote]]" has been translated from Old French to English.

> Listen 'o Count, the Council of Cardinals has learnt of many faithful items of which all shall be taken in God's name. The first of which is the Grail, which has been found in Jerusalem. The second is the Ark, which has been found in a new land to the West. And the third is the key, which has been found rumored to be in Languedoc.

[[tab Anomalous Methods of Combat Overview]]

Numerous thaumaturgic and magical combat varieties were used during the entirety of the conflict. It is unclear on which exact groups employed anomalous weaponry and to the extent that such means were used in relation to contemporary weaponry.

It is known that utilizing anomalous methods during the conflict became normalized by at least 1217, according to letters from Raymond VI to occult magicians and the "//Rexa Mundi// Internal Declaration[[footnote]] The //Rexa Mundi// Internal Declaration was a temporary allowance for priests and other Catholics to deploy occult practices. [[/footnote]]" that was passed by Bishop Iona.

It is believed that Cathars used thaumaturgic magic to revive beheaded prisoners of war and force them to fight. The exact amount of dead soldiers used is unknown but it is estimated to be about 1,000-5,000.

Records of these anomalous entities date to 1212 when they were first used in the Siege of Carcassone. It is generally thought that they were quite ineffective in battle.

[[tab Angel Men]]

Used in the Battle of Minerva in 1218, so-called "Angel Men" were Crusaders that were manipulated to fly using large wings. In the letters of Joshua the Clean[[footnote]] A soldier who fought alongside Raymond V in 1218 and died in 1220. [[/footnote]], these type of "abominations" would carry a scythe and sweep down "from the black skies into the red fields."

In order to combat these entities, Cathar groups would develop the precision stone-trebuchet which would later go on to be used in other non-anomalous conflicts.

[[tab Animal Soldiers]]

Due to the large loss of Cathar soldiers during the fall of Carcassone, Raymond VI decided to utilize animal life in Languedoc as replacements for infantry soldiers. Other animals used include snails, dogs, and rats.

The skulls of these entities are, occasionally, found in farm fields in modern-day Occitanie.

Fruit trees and wheat fields blessed with thaumaturgic magic that would heavily increase the output of available food was used throughout the war by Cathar groups. 

It is known that consuming such magically-amplified food resulted in deleterious effects but the exact outcome is unknown.

Catholic-linked churches and institutions in Languedoc would begin work on summoning extra-versal entities in 1207. For more information on containment, please refer to SCP-████.

Teams of 6-8 specially trained Crusader knights would be segmented and sent into areas of extreme anomaly concentration to eliminate all life. 

The members of the team would have specific spells, kinetoglyphs, and charms that would facilitate mass death. These teams would be used extensively during the last few years of the campaign to clear the land for occupation.
