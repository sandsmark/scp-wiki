> Memetics deals with information transfer, specifically cultural information in society. The basic idea is to conflate the exchange of information between people with genetic material, to track the mutation of ideas as they are transmitted from one person to the next in the way you could track viral transmissions and mutations. However, a meme also provides benefits to the carrier if they spread it.

> Memetics does NOT refer to telepathy, ESP or any imaginary psychic mental magic. These words are memetic, and if you understand them then they are having a completely ordinary memetic effect on you.

> Memetics in regards to SCP objects tends to focus on the impossible rather than the mundane, regarding effects that are transmitted via information. In general, the effects themselves should remain in the realm of information. A memetic SCP would be more likely to be a phrase that makes you think you have wings as opposed to a phrase that makes you actually grow a pair of wings. If you write up magic words that make people grow wings, it should be described as something other than memetic.

+ Memetics is not a thing that emanates in an aura.

Memetic is often incorrectly used by new personnel as the official sounding term for "Weird Mind Shit."  However, that is not actually what memetic means.  These words are memetic.  They are producing a memetic effect in your mind right now, without any magical mind rays lashing out of your computer monitor to grasp your fragile consciousness.  Memes are information, more specifically, cultural information.

Outside of the Foundation's walls the concept of memetics is not taken very seriously; it is a theory that conflates the transfer of cultural information with evolutionary biology.

meme : memetic :: gene : genetic

The idea was that certain memes prosper and others wither the same way certain genes produce stronger offspring that out-compete creatures with different genes.  Also, it is easy to compare the spread and mutation of information to the spread of a virus.  The reason we use the term memetic in our work is largely due to this, as the truly dangerous memes out there can spread like wildfire due to the fact that the very knowledge of them can count as an infection.

Understanding the true nature of memetic threats is critical to surviving them.  You cannot wear a special set of magical goggles made of telekill to protect yourself from a meme.  THE GOGGLES DO NOTHING.  If you just read those words in your head with a bad Teutonic accent, congratulations on being victim to yet another memetic effect.  If you did not know that phrase was an oft-repeated quote from the Simpsons then congratulations; you are now infected with that knowledge and are free to participate in its spread.

A meme perpetuates itself by being beneficial to the carrier to spread to new hosts. You now understand that THE GOGGLES DO NOTHING; you're in on the joke. However, you might have friends who aren't, and don't get it. It benefits you to explain them, because then you both have something new to laugh together about when it gets brought up. This is what makes a meme effective - how much incentive a carrier has to spread it. Unless an anomalous memes effect is the compulsive urge for the carrier to infect others, there needs to be incentive to spread it.

An artifact can no more have a memetic aura or project a memetic beam than a creature could have a genetic aura or genetic beam.  Even though you could imagine a creature with genes that allow it to produce some kind of aura or beam like a big doofy X-man, remember that the examples we have of such creatures in containment are not getting their super-powered emanations from anything resembling our scientific understanding of genetics and biology.  Neither are the memetic artifacts.  We contain these things specifically because we cannot understand or explain them yet.  At the end of the day we're still using a clumsy concept to describe things we don't have a full grasp of.

It is very rare that anything with a dangerous memetic component could be described as hostile to begin with.  We do not contain memetic threats because they are out to get us.  They are threats because it is dangerous for us to merely perceive them.  It is exceptionally rare for dangerous memes to even have anything resembling sapience with the exception of certain known entities which exist entirely within the medium of "cultural information" such as SCP-████, [[[SCP-732]]] and [[[SCP-423]]].

A dangerous meme is basically a trigger that sets off something inside of you that you may or may have not been aware of.  What would your knee jerk reaction be to knowing that your rival is sleeping with your one true love?  How would you react if you were to unwittingly catch them in the act?  That kind of sudden revelation can make a mild mannered citizen into a killer, so don't be surprised that there are other strange bits of information out there that can break the human mind in different yet equally drastic ways.

Protecting yourself from memetic threat is very tricky and can be worse than the threat itself.  There are reasons that we behave the way we do, there are reasons our emotions soar when we hear just the right combination of sounds in a piece of music.  Do you want to stop thinking about the Simpsons or your obnoxious nerdy friends that quote it every time you hear the phrase THE GOGGLES DO NOTHING?  That would require forgetting about the Simpsons and your friends.  

Do you want to survive hearing or reading the phrase "███ █████████ ██████?"  Well, sadly we don't quite know what other information you need to forget or know to prevent [DATA EXPUNGED] but we're getting better.  Lobotomies and pills help, and are one of the few times that the cure is not worse than the disease.  The sum total of our human condition; our cultural knowledge and upbringing and memories and identity; this is what makes us susceptible to the occasional memetic compulsion.  

So it's not the basalt monolith or its bizarre carvings that is making you strangle your companions with your own intestines, the problem was within you all along.

Should you ever find yourself under a memetic compulsion and aware of the fact, remember that there are certain mental exercises that you can perform which may save your life or the lives of your companions.  Changing the information your mind is being presented with may just change how you react to it, and the more abrupt or absurd the change is the better.  

Imagine the fearsome entity is wearing a bright pink nightgown.  Draw a mustache on the haunted painting.  Pee on the stone altar.  Wear the terrible sculpture like a hat.

And if all else fails, bend over and kiss your ass goodbye.  I'm not kidding.  That could actually help.

> This was originally intended as a piece of fiction on its own before it got stuck into the information bar with plenty of other plainly out-of-character writing guides.  So here's the important things to take away:
> 
> 1 - "Memetics" is a specific concept regarding information exchange.  It has nothing to do with telepathy or ESP or psychic compulsions.
> 
> 2 - [[[SCP-148]]] has no effect on anything memetic.  Don't screw this up or we will give you an incredibly hard time about it.
> 
> 3 - Psychic compulsions are lame and you should think twice before using them in your new SCP, even if you avoid misusing the term "memetic" when you do it.
> 
> 4 - Sorts' Rule for all memetic SCPs is "Memetic effect + crazy to death = failure."
