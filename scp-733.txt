**Item #:** SCP-733

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-733-01 is not yet contained. Foundation efforts are focused on locating this object, and bringing it into containment as soon as possible. As little data is available on SCP-733-01, it is currently classified Euclid. Field agents are to report the discovery of any objects matching the description of SCP-733-01 immediately, and secure the object for retrieval as soon as possible.

SCP-733-02 is Safe class, and currently stored in a secure, humidity controlled document locker at Site ██. Direct access to SCP-733-02 may only be performed with prior permission from at least two (2) Level 3 personnel, but access to transcripts and scans of SCP-733-02's contents is available via standard network access to anyone with at least Level 2 clearance.

**Description:** SCP-733-02 is a handwritten, leather-bound book of approximately 80 pages. It is apparently hand-crafted and was manufactured approximately circa 187█. SCP-733-02 and its contents have not exhibited any anomalous properties to date.

The pages of SCP-733-02 contains 33 black and white photographs, as well as 137 fragments of handwritten text. The authors of the text in SCP-733-02 have been analyzed as belonging to two unidentified individuals, a male (Subject A) and female (Subject B) of approximately 20-25 years of age who appear to be romantically involved with each other. Analysis of the photographs contained in SCP-733-02 have yielded no evidence of tampering, altering, or modification of any of the images.

SCP-733-02 was discovered in an antique store in the city of [REDACTED] by Foundation researcher Dr. █████ █████████. Upon noting the anomalous details documented within, Dr. █████████ brought the object into Foundation custody, where it has since been contained due to its possible evidence of the existence of another anomalous object, currently designated SCP-733-01. See Addendum 733-01 for further information.

**Subject:** Photograph #3, Text Fragment #11
**Page(s):** 2
**Description:** A photograph of a blanket spread out on a grassy hill, with a picnic basket on top. Depressions in the blanket are consistent with that of a person sitting on the blanket, but no one is visible.

**Subject:** Photograph #7, Text Fragment #26
**Page(s):** 13
**Description:** A photograph of a table in a crowded restaurant. A well-dressed, middle-aged gentleman is seen conversing and/or laughing with an empty seat next to him. "Even my father dotes upon you! I have not seen him laugh so heartily in years." - Subject A

**Subject:** Photograph #11, Text Fragment #49
**Page(s):** 18, 19
**Description:** A photograph of a wedding chapel. Shadow patterns indicate a woman in a dress should be within the frame of the picture, but no such woman is visible. "When I saw you walking down the aisle, you took my breath away. I have never been so happy as on that day." - Subject A

**Subject:** Photograph #26, Text Fragment #93
**Page(s):** 51
**Description:** A cradle containing a newborn infant, propped up next to an empty chair. "Our daughter Agatha. The fruit of our love." - Subject A

**Subject:** Photograph #29, Text Fragment #115
**Page(s):** 56
**Description:** A smiling, handsome man of approximately 20 years of age stands with his hand extended, as if holding something that cannot be seen. "Your friend, Jonathan. I am almost made jealous by the happiness you show when he is in town!" - Subject A

**Subject:** Text Fragment #128
**Page(s):** 61
**Description:** "Jonathan, Jonathan, Jonathan. Why must you spend so much time with him? Our bed seems to have grown cold lately. Am I at fault?" - Subject A

**Subject:** Text Fragment #133
**Page(s):** 63
**Description:** "My dear ██████, it is with sadness that I admit to having had an affair with my beloved Jonathan. I cannot deny it any longer; though I am reluctant, when you read this I will already be gone. I can only hope that you can find it within your heart to forgive me." - Subject B

**Subject:** Photograph #33, Text Fragments #136-137
**Page(s):** 67, 68
**Description:** A damaged photograph, older than the ones before it, showing a couple holding hands. The face of the man as well as the surroundings are blurred by what appears to be drops of human tears and smeared blood, and the woman has been cut out using scissors. "It has been a long time since I have written. My tears are run dry, and sorrow has turned to hatred in my heart." -Subject A "If I cannot have you, then no one else will." - Subject A

**Note:** An imprint of a pair of scissors is slightly visible on pages 67 and 68. The shape of the tool is unusual and is not similar any known to historical record of that time period. There also seems to be some unusual engravings on the surface of the object. Recommend attempting to locate this object for further investigation.

**Note:** Recommendation approved. Scissors classified as SCP-733-01 until further notice.
