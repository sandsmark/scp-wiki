++ SCP-5000-1-S

**Item #:** SCP-5000

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The door associated with SCP-5000 is to remain open outside of scheduled testing, and personnel will not enter the room except as required by testing protocols. A block will be placed in the doorframe to make sure it does not accidentally shut, while a barrier will be placed around the door to deny unauthorized entry. 

Any personnel who experience SCP-5000's anomalous effects will be removed from the site and isolated for at least one week as part of standard decontamination procedures after exposure to unreality.

**Description:** SCP-5000 is a spacial anomaly manifesting in a room in Site 98. When the door to this room is closed, the room, its contents, and the space it occupies ceases to exist to all measurements currently available to the Foundation.

Sonar and electromagnetic radiation act as though there is no space between the walls when the door is closed.  

Persons inside the room experience no time between the door's closing and its opening again. When the door opens, objects in motion have the same position and momentum they had when the door had closed, no matter how far they should have traveled.

The room in which SCP-5000 manifests was previously a storage room on the second sub-level of Site 98. There were no anomalous objects inside when it was discovered and it is presently unknown how it manifested.

O5 Command has approved the installation of a window to observe the effects of SCP-5000 directly. Installation has been scheduled for 24/MAR/30.

While testing of the anomaly's properties is underway, a Directed Task Force led by Dr. Matson has been commissioned to investigate its origins.

[[collapsible show="+ From Dr. Matson's Notes" hide="- Findings"]]
A full inventory of the anomalous storage room is currently being undertaken. While records indicate that no anomalous objects have been stored there, numerous pieces of equipment and records relating to the observation, testing, and containment of anomalous objects have been. I am convinced that cross-contamination is the root of this. Someone failed to follow procedure. I'm going to learn who and nail them to the wall.

I've advised against the testing of SCP-5000 until we have a handle on the origin of the anomaly. The loss of Doctor Scranton should be a warning to us all.

**Complained Lodged by Dr. Verne:** With due respect to Dr. Matson, he's not in charge of investigating this anomaly. It ultimately doesn't matter where the anomaly came from. What matters is what it *is*. As Site Director Alvarez agrees with me and has placed me in charge of testing, I find it extremely inappropriate for Dr. Matson to comment on my testing procedures.

++ SCP-5000-2-S

**Item #:** SCP-5000

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The door associated with SCP-5000 is to remain open outside of scheduled testing, and personnel will not enter the room except as required by testing protocols. The door will be held open and the secondary door built across it will be closed to prevent unauthorized access.

Any personnel who experience SCP-5000's anomalous effects will be removed from the site and isolated for at least one week as part of standard decontamination procedures after exposure to unreality.

**Description:** SCP-5000 is a spacial anomaly manifesting in a room in Site 98. When the door to this room is closed, the room, its contents, and the space it occupies ceases to exist to all measurements currently available to the Foundation.

Sonar and electromagnetic radiation act as though there is no space between the walls when the door is closed. 

Persons and objects inside the room experience no time between the door's closing and its opening again. Examples include:

* A baseball was dropped from one meter as the door was closed. When the door opened one hour later, the ball completed its fall.
* A bucket of ice and a pot of near-boiling water were left in the room, and the door closed for eight hours. Neither had materially changed in temperature in the intervening time.
* A test tube with fruit fly larva was left for fourteen days with the door closed. The larva were unchanged. Later, they pupated and became adult flies.

A porthole window was installed in the wall surrounding SCP-5000 on 3/APR/30. When the door is closed, the window immediately changes view as though it were embedded in the far wall. Refraction shows that the glass as five centimeters shallower than when the door is closed, suggesting that part of the window is affected by the anomaly. 

The room in which SCP-5000 manifests was previously an equipment storage room on the second sub-level of Site 98.

Penetration testing during active manifestation of SCP-5000 is pending approval.

While testing of the anomaly's properties is underway, a Directed Task Force led by Dr. Matson has been commissioned to investigate its origins.

[[collapsible show="+ From Dr. Matson's Notes" hide="- Findings"]]
We've obtained annual inventories going back thirty years for the site. I've eliminated a great deal already. Personnel records made up the bulk of it. Also janitorial supplies (other than those used in containment areas). Of note, records for SCPs 184, 1726, 4137, and several other objects that have never been stored at Site 98. There were also records for Projects Olympia, Ararat, and Rhodes. I am familiar with Olympia, but I've never heard of the other two. There were also a number of pieces of equipment that are currently missing, such as a diving bell used in 1892 for the containment of 3286. 

The records may just be due to Site 98's function as a research base. However, there's something about the numbers referenced that makes me feel there's something more. I can't put my finger on it, but I'm sure there's something there.

The projects are currently proving to be a blind alley. No one I've questioned on-site has any memory of Rhodes or Ararat. I suspect that the secrecy of these projects was enforced through amnestics. It wouldn't be the first time. I myself am missing eighteen months from various points in the thirties. My husband still hasn't quite forgiven me for losing what must have been a wonderful anniversary trip to Paris. I'll need to see if any other records remain on-site, and ask for off-site records if necessary.

The missing equipment seems unrelated, though it's worrying that any of it has gone missing. Sloppy procedures leads to sloppy results. 

Finally, I strongly, *strongly* advise against the proposed penetration testing. While I understand that Dr. Verne is in charge of testing, I must let my concerns be known.

++ SCP-5000-3-E

**Item #:** SCP-5000

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All doors associated with SCP-5000 are to be removed from their frames outside of scheduled testing, and personnel will not enter the room except as required by testing protocols. A security barrier will be placed at each potential entrance to SCP-5000. The hallway formerly accessible through the space occupied by SCP-5000 will no longer be used to house anomalous objects. 

Any personnel who experience SCP-5000's anomalous effects will be removed from the site and isolated for at least one week as part of standard decontamination procedures after exposure to unreality.

**Description:** SCP-5000 is a spacial anomaly manifesting in a hallway and a room in Site 98. When the doors to these spaces are closed, the room, its contents, and the space it occupies ceases to exist to all measurements currently available to the Foundation.

Sonar and electromagnetic radiation act as though there is no space between the walls when the doors are closed. Due to the irregular shape of SCP-5000, this causes significant distortion. 

Persons and objects inside the room experience no time between the door's closing and its opening again. However, the continuity of matter in the room is not perfectly consistent. Examples include:

* A bucket of marbles was dropped from a height of 3 feet. When the door was re-opened, the marbles resumed their travel. However, the direction of momentum was changed for each, seemingly at random.
* A section of air was superheated. Precise measurements were not taken, but five minutes after, the temperature of the room as a whole was 50°C, 30°C hotter than ambient temperature outside the anomaly.
* D-42803's right eye was displaced two feet from its socket.

The room in which SCP-5000 manifests was previously a storage room on the second sub-level of Site 98. There were no anomalous objects inside when it was discovered and it is presently unknown how it manifested.

A porthole window was installed in the wall surrounding SCP-5000 on 3/APR/30. When the door is closed, the window immediately changes view as though it were embedded in the far wall. Refraction shows that the glass as five centimeters shallower than when the door is closed, suggesting that part of the window is affected by the anomaly. 

A hole was drilled through the wall on 7/JUN/30 while the anomaly was active. When the drill reached the point where it should have reached the interior of the storage room, all communications with the testing team went silent. Site security immediately mobilized, and it was discovered that the hallway displayed the same anomalous properties as the room.

[[collapsible show="+ From Dr. Matson's Notes" hide="- Findings"]]
Most of the equipment has been accounted for or eliminated. I've already recommended disciplinary action against the equipment custodians who allowed it to go missing in the first place.

Notes for Project Ararat are still missing. However, I've noted some common factors in the records and items related to off-site SCPs. They're primarily related to anomalies with spatial- or reality-altering properties. I believe they may be related to 5000's properties. I've put in an information request for Project Ararat from Central Records. A research project like this does not get approved without going through the O5 Council. Some records must still exist.

++ SCP-5000-4-E

**Item #:** SCP-5000

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Wing E of Site 98 has been closed off. Evacuation of the rest of the site is underway. All non-essential personnel will be transferred to nearby sites under the cover of disaster relief efforts running throughout the eastern seaboard of the United States.

All further testing of SCP-5000 must be approved by the entire O5 Council, and an emphasis will be placed on neutralization of the anomaly.

No personnel will remain in a section of SCP-5000 when it is active, due to anomalies incompatible with life.

**Description:** SCP-5000 is a spacial anomaly manifesting in WIng E of Site 98. When any discrete enclosed space is closed off, the room, its contents, and the space it occupies ceases to exist to all measurements currently available to the Foundation.

Sonar and electromagnetic radiation act as though there is no space between the walls when the doors are closed. Due to the irregular shape of SCP-5000, this causes significant distortion.

Persons and objects inside the room experience no time between the door's closing and its opening again. However, the continuity of matter in the room is poorly consistent. Most dangerous examples include:

* A ladder was knocked over as the door to a hallway was closed. When it was re-opened, the momentum was altered so that instead of falling over, it instead crashed into the far wall at 60 KPH.
* O2 in one room was replaced by CO, leading to the hospitalization of three personnel.
* A janitor collapsed as soon as they were recovered from an affected room. Autopsy showed the absence of their circulatory system (though their blood still occupied the spaces left by the absent blood vessels).
* All objects in the room had undergone severe oxidation. This led to objects sustaining severe damage and reduced the structural integrity of the room.

The room in which SCP-5000 originally manifested was a storage room on the second sub-level of Site 98. There were no anomalous objects inside when it was discovered and it is presently unknown how it manifested.

A porthole window was installed in the wall surrounding SCP-5000 on 3/APR/30. When the door is closed, the window immediately changes view as though it were embedded in the far wall. Refraction shows that the glass as five centimeters shallower than when the door is closed, suggesting that part of the window is affected by the anomaly. 

A hole was drilled through the wall on 7/JUN/30 while the anomaly was active. When the drill reached the point where it should have reached the interior of the storage room, all communications with the testing team went silent. Site security immediately mobilized, and it was discovered that the hallway displayed the same anomalous properties as the room.

On 10/AUG/30, Foundation agents inadvertently caused a 7.8 magnitude earthquake centered in New York City while neutralizing a Chaos Insurgency cell. Site 98 was not rated for this level of seismic activity, and it caused structural damage throughout the site. SCP-5000 was undergoing testing at the time, and this breached its previous boundaries, leading to much of Wing E of Site 98 being compromised.

24 personnel were inside the affected areas. 17 required hospitalization and 5 died immediately. The others are undergoing observation.

[[collapsible show="+ From Dr. Matson's Notes" hide="- Findings"]]
My fears were well-founded. I can only hope that we can unravel this mess and reverse the damage.

Dr. Verne was among those injured by the incident, so has been removed from the project. Director Alvarez tried putting another of her pet researchers in, but I appealed directly to the O5 council, and learned that none of my previous messages had been passed on. Director Alvarez has been removed from her position, and I am now in command of Site 98. This is not what I wanted, but I will do the best I can with the tools I've been given.

There is worse news, however. The earthquake knocked out much of our network. We cannot send or receive information classified at level 4 or higher. The details of Project Ararat are classified at level 5. We are attempting some workarounds, but with the current emergency, it's taking time. We aren't the only site to suffer serious breaches.

A highly redacted precis on the project did arrive. I need the details, but at least the outline is becoming more apparent. Project Ararat was a parallel project to the one that gave us the Scranton Reality Anchor. The purpose was to combat anomalies that cause a breakdown in local reality. How that led to the effects we've seen today remains to be seen, but I have some ideas in that direction.

In the meantime, I've shut down all proposed testing for SCP-5000 until we have a better handle on its nature. I've also sent in to have it upgraded to Keter.

++ SCP-5000-5-K

**Item #:** SCP-5000

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Site 98 has been closed off. No personnel are to access the site without direct approval of the entire O5 Council.

No personnel will approach SCP-5000 due to anomalies incompatible with life.

**Description:** SCP-5000 is a spacial anomaly manifesting the remains of Site 98. When any discrete enclosed space is closed off, the room, its contents, and the space it occupies ceases to exist to all measurements currently available to the Foundation.

Sonar and electromagnetic radiation act as though there is no space between the walls when the doors are closed. Due to the irregular shape of SCP-5000, this causes significant distortion.

Areas that are not active still show a strong degradation of reality consistent with low Hume levels, with time passing at inconsistent rates, changes in temperature and pressure, and sudden changes in states of matter.

Persons and objects inside the room experience no time between the door's closing and its opening again. However, the continuity of matter in the room is poorly consistent. Most dangerous examples include:

* A ladder was knocked over as the door to a hallway was closed. When it was re-opened, the momentum was altered so that instead of falling over, it instead crashed into the far wall at 60 KPH.
* Air inside a chamber of Site 98 was replaced by molten lead
* A janitor collapsed as soon as they were recovered from an affected room. Autopsy showed the absence of their circulatory system (though their blood still occupied the spaces left by the absent blood vessels).
* Members who accidentally entered an active section of SCP-5000 vanished and have not reappeared.
* All objects in the room had undergone severe oxidation. This led to objects sustaining severe damage and reduced the structural integrity of the room.

The room in which SCP-5000 originally manifested was a storage room on the second sub-level of Site 98. There were no anomalous objects inside when it was discovered and it is presently unknown how it manifested.

SCP-5000 was undergoing testing at the time, and this breached its previous boundaries, leading to much of Wing E of Site 98 being compromised.

On 24/AUG/30, Doctor Henry Verne made unauthorized use of a Scranton Reality Anchor. He set it up inside a section of SCP-5000, activated the anchor, and then closed the door, engaging its effect. The anomaly spread to the rest of the site. Due to evacuation procedures, only 15 personnel were on site. Four were recovered unharmed. Five bodies were also extracted. No other personnel, including Dr. Verne, have been recovered due to the dangers inside SCP-5000.

[[collapsible show="+ From Dr. Matson's Notes" hide="- Findings"]]
That idiot! I ordered him to report to Site 19. Instead, he made one last effort to destroy any hope of dealing with this situation.

Well. To be fair, it was clearly an attempt to reverse the damage already done. And he had a lot to answer for.

While I was waiting for a Foundation courier to arrive with an encrypted drive, I had Dr. Verne's home searched. We found the notes on Project Ararat. It's disturbing reading.

The most disturbing part was reading the name at the top of the report: My own. I remember nothing of the project, but it is clearly my handwriting. More, I recognize the style of my work as I read through the experiment logs.

It was supposed to have all been destroyed or sent on to Central Records, but apparently one copy was left here. I can only assume it was by me, though that seems incredibly reckless.

As the precis had shown, it was meant to combat anomalies that affected local reality. Where Scranton Reality Anchors maintain normal Hume levels, this project did the opposite.

It would drop local Humes to 0, and then raise them back up. In theory, this would undo any gross alterations of reality. However, the problems were twofold. First, we found it difficult to actually bring the Humes back up. The system is metastable. The second is that, as we have observed here, it doesn't scale up.

Larger areas suffer degradation of local reality. So do smaller areas, actually, but the degree is negligible at that scale. A molecule gone astray here or there, a half degree change in temperature in the space of a cubic centimeter. However, the larger the area, the less reality is able to "snap back." 

We hadn't solved these issues when Scranton finished his reality anchor. Honestly, it was a much better solution. 

I have to wonder, though, why did I leave a copy of my work here? Was it carelessness? Or was it frustration at giving up the project? I can say now that scrapping it was the right decision, but did I see that right after I'd given a year of my life to the project, with nothing to show for it? Perhaps I hoped I might find it and return to the research. 

I fear I may bear as much responsibility for this disaster as Doctor Verne.

I can only hope there will be a future left to hate me for it.

Our only hope is that we can find a way contain and reverse this disaster. The site is lost. Hume levels vary wildly. Even with doors open, we observe degradation of local reality. I've ordered it closed. I've presented my findings to the council.

We'll reach out to the best metaphysicists in the GOC, GRU, ORIA, even the Serpent's Hand, but I'm not optimistic. If we'd known what this was from the start, we could have fixed this easily.

There must be some solution. We undid our work here the last time, so we know it must be possible. I can only hope we aren't too late.
