**Agent 'NekoChris' Personnel File**

**Security Clearance Level:** **<DATA EXPUNGED>**

**Occupation:** Occult Researcher and Eldritch Containment Specialist

**History:**
The exact date of this agent's employment at the Foundation is currently unknown due to the unusual circumstances in which he was reactivated. The agent's 'office' was found during reconstruction of several of the sub-levels of Site ██. Following research regarding the office it was found that the area appears on blue prints dating from 19██ but stops appearing on updated prints after 19██. The office of the agent was sealed behind several layers of drywall and was discovered when removing moldy sections. In an attempt to explore the newly discovered room the door to the office was broken down, the fragments of which were found to be covered in an array of unknown symbols. Outdated research materials referencing several SCPs were found within the room as well as the Agent and an unknown creature.

Agent 'NekoChris' original employment records were discovered within archived files with several areas of his file removed or damaged due to storage conditions so personal identification beyond his offered moniker are unavailable; although he does confirm his real name is in fact, Chris. Having been employed in 19██ as an 'Occult Specialist' during █████████████; Agent 'NekoChris' was for a period involved in several SCP research and containment incidents up until 19██.

There is a gap in the records following this incident after which he became active again on a much smaller scale. His explanation of this gap is a SCP incident which was thought to be controlled however the containment procedures failed with disastrous repercussions. As a result the agent was reprimanded and spent a period of time studying the incident and improving techniques to prevent it from occurring again.

When questioned about this particular incident a sealed record involving SCP-███ was presented to the interviewing staff. This record is now under intense scrutiny as it details events unfamiliar to current staff and matching nothing currently on file.

According to the Agent, the state of his office was a result of studying a style of containment that required the office be blocked off from the outside to prevent anything from leaving the area. The peculiar creature found residing with the agent is the result of the failed attempts to replicate the desired containment field and has bound itself to the agent so that the two are best classified as 'symbiotic'. While what benefits the two provide to one another are currently unknown it is speculated that at least one is a state of 'agelessness' allowing the agent to have survived for the decades that he has sealed within the office area. Conversely the only demand the creature seems to call for is constant attention bordering on worship.

Physical examination of the agent revealed several areas of his body scarred due to electrical burns received from the bound entity, inflicted as a result of 'punishment' for not giving it the Agent's full attention when demanded. The creature also refuses to allow the agent to physically interact with any electronic device such as hand-held devices, but seems to have no objection to objects that are indirectly acted with, such as screens or monitors.

While no audible exchange of dialogue would occur between the agent and the creature he stated that it does communicate to him and has explicitly expressed that certain of our questions not be answered. When pressed on this issue the agent commented that any punishment that could be dealt for not answering the questions would pale in comparison to the punishment he would receive for answering them. It is evident from this that despite the agent being able to brush aside or ignore some of the creature's requests for attention it holds a degree of control over his actions that is currently unmeasured. Thus far any requests we have made for the agent to perform he has been able to follow through with so it would appear that it is disclosure of information regarding its nature and desires that it has forbidden.
