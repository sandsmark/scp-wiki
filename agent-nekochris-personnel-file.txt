**Agent 'NekoChris' Personnel File**

**Security Clearance Level:** **<DATA EXPUNGED>**

**Occupation:** Occult Researcher and Eldritch Containment Specialist

**History:**
Exact date of employment at the Foundation is currently unknown. Agent's 'office' was found during reconstruction of several of the sub-levels of Site ██. This office area appears on blue prints dating from 19██ but stops appearing on updated prints after 19██. The office of the agent was sealed behind several layers of drywall and was discovered when removing moldy sections. During removal the door to the office was broken down, the fragments of which were found to be covered in an array of unknown symbols. Outdated research materials referencing several SCPs were found within the room as well as the Agent and an unknown creature, both apparently in a state of sleep. During examination of the room both Agent and creature awoke and were questioned.

Agent 'NekoChris' original employment records were discovered within archived files with several areas of his file removed so personal identification beyond his offered moniker are unavailable; although he does confirm his real name is in fact, Chris. Having been employed in 19██ as an 'Occult Specialist' during █████████████; Agent 'NekoChris' was for a period involved in several SCP research and containment incidents up until 19██. There is a gap in the records following this incident after which he became active again on a much smaller scale. His explanation of this gap is a SCP incident which was thought to be controlled however the containment procedures failed with disastrous repercussions. As a result the agent was reprimanded and spent a period of time studying the incident and improving techniques to prevent it from occurring again. When questioned about this particular incident a sealed record involving SCP-███ was presented to the interviewing staff. This record is now under intense scrutiny as it details events unfamiliar to current staff and matching nothing currently on file.

According to the Agent, the state of his office was a result of studying a style of containment that required the office be blocked off from the outside to prevent anything from leaving the area. This particular line of containment procedure focused around using a secondary entity to contain the desired target however there were mistakes in the procedure and as a result the Agent became contained by the entity and now the two are inextricably bound.

At this point in the interview the entity that has attached itself to the agent began speaking and requesting the Agent's attention, acting aggressively if ignored for too long a period, generally by biting the Agent or climbing over him and then prodding him with its tail resulting in severe electrical discharges. Its voice is described as being similar to that of a shy young girl, even when displaying violent behavior its voice remains innocent and collected. At several points the entity often climbed around and on top of the Agent however there is no sign of weight strain from bearing the creature.

Physical examination of the Agent reveals several areas of his body scarred due to electrical burns received from the bound entity. According to the Agent, the creature, which he refers to as '█████', seems to grant him immunity to exposure to high voltage except that which comes from the creature itself. The creature often uses this as a form of 'punishment' for not giving it the Agent's full attention. The creature also refuses to allow the Agent to physically interact with any electronic device such as hand-held devices, but seems to have no objection to objects that are indirectly acted with, such as screens or monitors.
