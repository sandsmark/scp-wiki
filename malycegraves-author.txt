++++++ __**Description**__
[[/div]]
[[include component:image-block name=typewriter|caption=Sometimes, it works on this|width=300px]]

--SCP-Malyce Graves is a ghost. She's a figment of someone's overactive imagination and he sometimes haunts the graves of past lovers. For years, there have been folk that wonder who and what Malyce actually is, but so far there are only rumors and speculation.--

--SCP-Malyce Graves died on September 13, 1904 in a freak accident involving a boiler and a herring. They are credited with single-handedly doing nothing important whatsoever. In fact, his life was so unremarkable that it's amazing that we even remember her.--

--SCP-Malyce Graves was admitted to the Cherry Hill Institution for the Criminally Insane on March 3rd, 1982 after having confessed to the crime of not caring at all for small puppies or little cute critters. They are a blight on the face of humankind and should be summarily purged.--

--SCP-Malyce Graves lives in Rochester, NY with her wife of 12 years, 3.4 kids, and their puppy labradoodle Simon. He's an alumnus of a school no one remembers, and has spent the last 934 years teaching cell mitosis to bright eyed squirrels.--

SCP-Malyce Graves is a liar and a cheat and no one should believe anything they say.[[footnote]]Obviously a riff on [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3999 Talloran].[[/footnote]]

Even so, [http://www.scp-wiki.net/uebench you should read this].

[[tab Lies About Lies]]
++++ I <3 the Circus
This tale series is the introduction of a few new Circus characters. While it isn't explicit throughout the story (so far), the Protagonist eventually attains the name Cahaya. The relationship between Cahaya and Fraust is really the first thing I've added to the site, and I'm quite glad that the first thing I put in is a love story. It starts with the I <3 the Circus, and then ends with [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4459 SCP-4459: The Ringmaster's Crown]. Time is funky, because in my headcanon, the Kaleidoscope allows for opening Ways into the past. 

Some of the feedback I've gotten has been about how forced the gender stuff appears. Cahaya is meant to be whatever gender you assign to them. I wanted it to be very fluid on that. Also, Fraust is a Clown, and can change their gender at will. Sooo, yeah. Gender fluidity is deeply personal to me, and I wanted to showcase that in my stories about these people.

I'd like to dedicate all of these stories to my beloved boyfriend. He's an acrobat/contortionist/aerialist in the real-world circus, and my love for him is intermixed with my love of Herman Fuller's Circus. Thank you for being such a light in my life, and for your unfailing love and support. You give me the strength to continue, to be better, to be worthy. <3

[[include :scp-wiki:component:hf-book-right chapter=The Penitent Man|content=As far as freaks go, I is really kinda normal. I bleed a lot, and my blood don't coagulate. Simple nuff, right? I'm just a hemo-phil-iac. An’ I an’t never run outta blood. I is guessin’ that's kinda weird too. I'm also not really certain iffin’ I age no more. So yeah, I is guessin’ I'm a freak.

When I was a kid, my ma would always be so protective of me. She'd hide me in the broom closet when pa would come home from his binges. She'd hear the car come rolling up the gravel, and she'd just know. My sister and I would get pushed into the closet, and she'd shush us. 

Abby cried once. She was upset ‘cause ma fergot her doll or somethin’. Pa found us that night, and Abby din’t cry no more affer that.

I mean, we didn’t have it all that bad. Lots of other cajun folk had it much worse. We din’t live all that deep in the swamp, jus’ a few miles west of New Orleans, as the crow flies. Little place called Des Allemands, in Lafourche Parish. Like most folks in Des Allemands, we was prolly German somewhat, but that was a while back, and aint none of us spoke us any German no more. We caught us catfish, ate catfish, sold catfish, bred catfish. We was the Catfish Capital of the Universe, as ol’ man Begue used to say. 

Nah, ‘twernt all that bad, really. We was happy-ish, an’ that’s a damn sight better’n a lot of the other folks. ‘cept when pa got to drinkin’. Then we wasn’t even happy-ish no more. I’m guessin’ that pa was still kinda happy-ish, but I ain’t thinkin’ we will be talkin’ about that none. 
Anyways, things got bad aftern’ tha War. I didn’t go on that one, on account of me bein’ so young ‘n all. But pa, he went, though ‘twernt him that came on back after. He was always in the drink after that, an ma, she couldn’t do nothin’ about that. 

Things weren’t even happy-ish after that. Pa couldn’t find no work, so we was livin’ off what ever the fed sent us each month. But that never went far with pa always bein’ in the drink. Ma’d yell about feedin’ us young’uns, and pa’d yell ‘bout how ‘twas his money fer goin’ out ‘n gettin’ shot at ‘n whatnot. He’d take tha check ‘n go get nackered ‘n sometimes e’d be bringin’ home a bit. Never ‘nuf tho. 

Sos Abby’n I, we’d go catch us some catfish ‘n ma’d cook ‘em up ‘n we’d eat that. But that was afore ma realized somethin’ was wrong with me. I’d bleed n’ bleed n’ bleed. She’d be getting’ right afeared fore me, an’ pa’d get to yellin’ ‘bout how we din’t got no moneys fer med’cation ‘n whatnot. I dunno what woulda happened if’n Abby hadn’t tried to get atween them when they was fightin’. What I know is that pa threw a punch as he’d done afore, ‘n Abby took it ‘n the head. 

She weren’t right after that’n.

Pa took me fer a ride in his Studebaker, ‘n I is guessin’ he fergot me when we was in New Orleans. Tho, that prolly ain’t how it went. Don’t matter none, ‘cause goin’ back was prolly good fer ma. It’d be nice to know she was ok or whatever, but I is guessin’ that ain’t likely to be somethin’ I ever a kin to, now. 

Anyway, there I was, lost lil’ cajun boy wanderin’ the streets oh New Orleans. I was in the Quarter when I first ran into Papa Legba. He tol’ me he had a place to stay, ‘n he’d feed me. So, I was with ‘im for a time in La Rue Macabre. 

Those were good times, lemme tell ya. Legba ‘n Nancy, ‘n Cotton Eye Joe, ‘n Scratch. Them’s good folks. We’d laugh ‘n listen to ole’ Uncle Nancy tell ‘is stories ‘bout the days afore. Joe’d play some mean shit on ‘is guitar then go start a fight with Scratch. Good times. |pagenumber=147]]

[[include :scp-wiki:component:hf-book-left chapter=The Penitent Man|content=I don’ rightly know why I joined up when Fuller came through. He was always around, pickin’ Legba’s brain ‘bout nothin, or chattin’ with the Fonteyns. Hell, he even went out to speak with Manma Natau moren’ once. ‘E’d never paid me no mind, then one day he did.

I can’t rightly tell you why I went with ‘im. Fuller tol’ me ‘e had a ways to make me not be worryin’ all the time ‘bout my bleedin’ thing. ‘E was always yawin’ ‘bout somethin’ or t’other, an’ I guess ‘is magic got to workin’ on me in a big way. Nancy pulled me aside ‘n tole me I ain’t gots to go with Fuller, ‘n I guess I was feelin’ peckish, ‘cause I tole Nancy I was all growed up ‘n I could be makin’ up my own mind ‘bout stuff.

Sos I went, ‘n I reckon ‘twas a good enough call. Fuller took me to ‘is little trailer, ‘n we was in there a long while. ‘E got me bleedin’ all o’r the place, ‘n ‘ventually I realized I wasn’t getting’ all faint or nuthin’. ‘E was mighty proud oh hisself for that’n. Crow’d ‘bout it to Manny somethin’ fierce. 

Now, here I is, bleedin’ fer th’ crowds that come to gawk. T’aint so bad, really. Tho’ there’s times I gets a hankerin’ fer one o’ ole Nancy’s stories. ‘Ventually, says Fuller. Sos I waits. |pagenumber=148]]
