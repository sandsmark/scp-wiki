++++++ __**Description**__
[[/div]]
[[include component:image-block name=typewriter|caption=Sometimes, it works on this|width=300px]]

--SCP-Malyce Graves is a ghost. She's a figment of someone's overactive imagination and he sometimes haunts the graves of past lovers. For years, there have been folk that wonder who and what Malyce actually is, but so far there are only rumors and speculation.--

--SCP-Malyce Graves died on September 13, 1904 in a freak accident involving a boiler and a herring. They are credited with single-handedly doing nothing important whatsoever. In fact, his life was so unremarkable that it's amazing that we even remember her.--

--SCP-Malyce Graves was admitted to the Cherry Hill Institution for the Criminally Insane on March 3rd, 1982 after having confessed to the crime of not caring at all for small puppies or little cute critters. They are a blight on the face of humankind and should be summarily purged.--

--SCP-Malyce Graves lives in Rochester, NY with her wife of 12 years, 3.4 kids, and their puppy labradoodle Simon. He's an alumnus of a school no one remembers, and has spent the last 934 years teaching cell mitosis to bright eyed squirrels.--

SCP-Malyce Graves is a liar and a cheat and no one should believe anything they say.[[footnote]]Obviously a riff on [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3999 Talloran].[[/footnote]]

Even so, [http://www.scp-wiki.net/uebench you should read this].

[[tab Lies About Lies]]
++++ I <3 the Circus
This tale series is the introduction of a few new Circus characters. While it isn't explicit throughout the story (so far), the Protagonist eventually attains the name Cahaya. The relationship between Cahaya and Fraust is really the first thing I've added to the site, and I'm quite glad that the first thing I put in is a love story. It starts with the I <3 the Circus, and then ends with [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4459 SCP-4459: The Ringmaster's Crown]. Time is funky, because in my headcanon, the Kaleidoscope allows for opening Ways into the past. 

Some of the feedback I've gotten has been about how forced the gender stuff appears. Cahaya is meant to be whatever gender you assign to them. I wanted it to be very fluid on that. Also, Fraust is a Clown, and can change their gender at will. Sooo, yeah. Gender fluidity is deeply personal to me, and I wanted to showcase that in my stories about these people.

I'd like to dedicate all of these stories to my beloved boyfriend. He's an acrobat/contortionist/aerialist in the real-world circus, and my love for him is intermixed with my love of Herman Fuller's Circus. Thank you for being such a light in my life, and for your unfailing love and support. You give me the strength to continue, to be better, to be worthy. <3
