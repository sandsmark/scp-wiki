SCP-Malyce Graves should be kept in an extravagant penthouse estate over looking Central Park. Everything they need should be delivered by remotely-operated drone in order to prevent contamination by the obscenity that is Malyce's overactive imagination.

[[span class="hover"]][[span]]**ONLY** attribute to Malyce that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.

++++++ __**Description**__
[[/div]]
[[include component:image-block name=typewriter|caption=Sometimes, it works on this|width=250px]]

--SCP-Malyce Graves is a ghost. She's a figment of someone's overactive imagination and he sometimes haunts the graves of past lovers. For years, there have been folk that wonder who and what Malyce actually is, but so far there are only rumors and speculation.--

--SCP-Malyce Graves died on September 13, 1904 in a freak accident involving a boiler and a herring. They are credited with single-handedly doing nothing important whatsoever. In fact, his life was so unremarkable that it's amazing that we even remember her.--

--SCP-Malyce Graves was admitted to the Cherry Hill Institution for the Criminally Insane on March 3rd, 1982 after having confessed to the crime of not caring at all for small puppies or little cute critters. They are a blight on the face of humankind and should be summarily purged.--

--SCP-Malyce Graves lives in Rochester, NY with her wife of 12 years, 3.4 kids, and their puppy labradoodle Simon. He's an alumnus of a school no one remembers, and has spent the last 934 years teaching cell mitosis to bright eyed squirrels.--

SCP-Malyce Graves is a liar and a cheat and no one should believe anything they say.[[footnote]]Obviously a riff on [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3999 Talloran].[[/footnote]]

Even so, [http://www.scp-wiki.net/uebench you should read this].
