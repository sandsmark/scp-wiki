SCP-Malyce Graves should be kept in an extravagant penthouse estate over looking Central Park. Everything they need should be delivered by remotely-operated drone in order to prevent contamination by the obscenity that is Malyce's overactive imagination.

Or not.

++++++ __**Description**__
[[/div]]
[[include component:image-block name=typewriter|caption=Sometimes, it works on this|width=300px]]

--SCP-Malyce Graves is a ghost. She's a figment of someone's overactive imagination and he sometimes haunts the graves of past lovers. For years, there have been folk that wonder who and what Malyce actually is, but so far there are only rumors and speculation.--

--SCP-Malyce Graves died on September 13, 1904 in a freak accident involving a boiler and a herring. They are credited with single-handedly doing nothing important whatsoever. In fact, his life was so unremarkable that it's amazing that we even remember her.--

--SCP-Malyce Graves was admitted to the Cherry Hill Institution for the Criminally Insane on March 3rd, 1982 after having confessed to the crime of not caring at all for small puppies or little cute critters. They are a blight on the face of humankind and should be summarily purged.--

--SCP-Malyce Graves lives in Rochester, NY with her wife of 12 years, 3.4 kids, and their puppy labradoodle Simon. He's an alumnus of a school no one remembers, and has spent the last 934 years teaching cell mitosis to bright eyed squirrels.--

SCP-Malyce Graves is a liar and a cheat and no one should believe anything they say.[[footnote]]Obviously a riff on [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3999 Talloran].[[/footnote]]

Even so, [http://www.scp-wiki.net/uebench you should read this].

[[tab Truths About Lies]]
++++ I <3 the Circus
This tale series is the introduction of a few new Circus characters. While it isn't explicit throughout the story (so far), the Protagonist eventually attains the name Cahaya. The relationship between Cahaya and Fraust is really the first thing I've added to the site, and I'm quite glad that the first thing I put in is a love story. It starts with the I <3 the Circus, and then ends with [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4459 SCP-4459: The Ringmaster's Crown]. Time is funky, because in my headcanon, the Kaleidoscope allows for opening Ways into the past. 

Some of the feedback I've gotten has been about how forced the gender stuff appears. Cahaya is meant to be whatever gender you assign to them. I wanted it to be very fluid on that. Also, Fraust is a Clown, and can change their gender at will. Sooo, yeah. Gender fluidity is deeply personal to me, and I wanted to showcase that in my stories about these people.

I'd like to dedicate all of these stories to my beloved boyfriend. He's an acrobat/contortionist/aerialist in the real-world circus, and my love for him is intermixed with my love of Herman Fuller's Circus. Thank you for being such a light in my life, and for your unfailing love and support. You give me the strength to continue, to be better, to be worthy. <3

++++ SCP-5501: Empty Portraits
This represents a significant amount of research into the American Civil War as well as the impact of that conflict upon the mental health of the people that participated. As one of the bloodiest periods of my nation's history, the impact of that war has etched itself deeply upon the collective psyche of the people that survived it and the descendants.

I am a first generation American. Both sides of my parental lineage stretch far back through centuries of conflict and death, so while I cannot say that the echoes of the American Civil War still ring in my blood, I see the horrors of my own cultural legacy mirrored in it.

While I am excited to write fiction about these events, I think it is tremendously important to keep in mind that these events happened. There is no horror that I can craft in the comfort of my office chair that will ever match the horror experienced by the people that fought and died in that war, or any war. Out of respect, I have kept as close to the source material as possible.

All of the officers mentioned here are real people. The battles and dates of the battles mentioned here are real. The only one that wasn't is "Massacre at Seven Pines", that is entirely of my creation. The horror of The Battle of The Crater is real, and the racism that added to that needless slaughter was also real.

Let us not forget that this war was fought, and a great many people died, for the "right" of the Southern States to own slaves. This horrific stain on my Nation's history must never be forgotten lest we become complacent, and thus complicit, in the practice of trafficking and sale of human beings all around the globe.

In the event that I have disappeared off of the wiki and IRC for a period longer than 6 months without any notice or updates, I entrust the curation of all my solo //La Rue Macabre// content to [[*user plaidypus]], all my other solo stuff to [[*user DrAkimoto]], and my collaborative articles with their respective co-authors.

These curators are expressly allowed to make substantive modifications to my work, provided it doesn't change the overall theme of the piece. (An Alagaddan skip will remain Alaggadan, etc.)
