++ **Synopsis**
------
+++ Act 1

A married couple are aroused from their sleep by the sound of a crying baby. The wife tells her husband that it's his turn to check on the baby. As the husband opens the door to their bedroom, he turns around and exclaims with alarm that they do not have a child. The husband is pulled through the doorway by an off-stage assailant. The terrified wife calls the police, and the phone call is intercepted by the Foundation Surveillance Network ("Something is [REDACTED]ing My Husband!"). 

##0645AD|Mobile Task Force Beta-12## arrives as a [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-844 globular red mass] closes in on the wife. The team captures the creatures in a metal crate, administers amnestics to the wife, and cleans up the husband's remains ("Just Another Tuesday"). The creature is transported to Site-19 and placed in a containment cell next to [[[SCP-049]]] ("Secure, Contain, Protect"). ##0645AD|Dr. Jack Bright## and his assistants walk through the corridor and to check that all SCPs are still in containment ("Roll Call").

Bright enters [[[SCP-105]]]'s containment chamber and performs a routine test of her anomalous ability to see locations in photographs as they presently appear ("What Do You See in the Picture?"). Afterward, she is told she may be granted certain privileges for her good behavior. SCP-105 requests fresh flowers, a bible, and that Dr. Bright call her by her real name, Iris. Bright approves the first two requests, but denies the third ("List of Requests").

Burdened by his obligation to treat the innocent captives the same way he treats the monsters, Bright goes to the [[[SCP-408]]] enclosure and confesses his guilty feelings to lepidopterist ##0645AD|Dr. Zynnia Kondraki##.  Kondraki reassures Bright that he is doing the right thing, although her speech includes many subtly allusions to the clear romantic tension between the two of them ("Bright's Lament").

[[include component:image-block name=PlagueDoctor.jpg|caption=Troy DuChamp in his role as SCP-046.]]

Elsewhere in Site-19, the amorphous red blob (now designated SCP-844) reveals itself to have the voice and personality of a small, frightened child. SCP-049, contained in the neighboring cell, tries to explain SCP-844's situation to it in a sensitive and gentle way, but he is interrupted by Able ([[[SCP-076]]]), who provides a more frank and honest description of life in containment ("Where am I?"/"Being Anomalous Really Sucks"). 

Loud sirens and bright flashing lights suddenly come on. The SCPs cheer, recognizing it as a Containment Breach alarm. They happily speculate who may have attained freedom, but are horrified when they find that it is [[[SCP-106]]] ("Who's the Lucky Bastard?"/"Oh HELL No!"). SCP-106 silently performs a short dance number before leaving to wreak havoc in Site-19 ("Ragged Ragtime"). 

Meanwhile, Bright and Kondraki share their first kiss while SCP-408 specimens create a romantic atmosphere ("Screw Professionalism"). Just as they are about to confess their feelings for one another, ##0645AD|Site Director Yorick Clefford## announces over Site-19's PA system that all personnel must assist in reestablishing containment of SCP-106 at any cost ("Put That Thing Back Where It came From (Or So Help Me)"). Bright and Kondraki exchange awkward goodbyes and quickly run off to defend their Site.

Bright runs to Site-19's East Storage Wing and searches the containment lockers for anything that might be able to stop SCP-106, but finds that they are all Safe-Class objects with bizarre-but unhelpful-abilities ("My Kingdom for a Euclid"). Finally, he grabs a handful of objects with unidentified anomalous properties, hoping for the best ("What the Hell, I'm Dead Either Way").

SCP-106 walks through Site-19's cafeteria, killing staff members right and left. Suddenly the cafeteria turns into an idyllic pastoral scene, causing SCP-106 to recoil in terror. It sends handfuls of black, highly acidic drippings into the air, causing SCP-408 specimens to scatter and fall (“[DATA EXPUNGED] Waltz”). Just as SCP-106 spies Kondraki in the corner of the room, Bright bursts in with his arms full of undocumented SCP objects. He throws them one after another at SCP-106, but to no avail. SCP-106 slowly advances toward Bright until the two are face-to-face. SCP-106 reaches forward menacingly, but at the last moment, Bright puts [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1418|a comb]]] on SCP-106’s head, turning it into a young woman– much to its distress.

Yorickson enters the room with back-up security personnel, who apprehend SCP-106 before it can remove the comb. Just as the trouble seems to be over, a support beam weakened by SCP-106’s sludge attacks begins to collapse. Bright sees the support about to fall on Kondraki, and he pushes her out of the way, sacrificing himself in the process. He confesses his love to her with his dying breaths (“Screw Professionalism (Reprise)”).  As his body goes limp, a red amulet falls out of his hand. 


+++ Act 2

Several days after the containment breach, a team of D-Class personnel is cleaning the damaged cafeteria. One of them finds the red amulet lying amongst some rubble and picks it up. His entire disposition immediately changes, and he runs out of the room in confusion. When captured and questioned, he claims to be Dr. Jack Bright. When he answers questions only the real Bright would know, his interrogators are forced to believe him (“My Name Is Jack Bright”).

[[include component:image-block name=SCPMusicaljpg|caption=Dr. Bright, in his new body, apprehended by an MTF agent.]]

Bright, in his new body, is designated as [[[SCP-963]]] and placed in a holding cell until an available containment chamber could be found. Bright notes irony of finding himself on the other side of the containment door (“Bright’s Lament (Reprise). He is surprised to find himself moved to an “overflow” chamber containing other humanoids. His cellmates, [[[SCP-2800]]] and [[[SCP-1846]]], attempt to raise his spirits (“It’s Not All Bad”). 

Meanwhile, Kondraki, still believing Bright to be dead, has her butterflies create an illusion of him so she can say goodbye (“Damn Your Sexy Face”). ##0645AD|Dr. Everett King## enters the butterfly enclosure to retrieve some notes, and several butterflies escape as he comes in. Kondraki follows them to the cell where Bright is being held, and the two reunite (“I’m Confused, But Kiss Me”). 

Elsewhere in Site-19, Able has been transferred to the cell next to Iris’. The two recount the romantic relationship they fostered as teammates in the Omega-7 Task Force, and the breakup that followed. Able begs her to see the warm, loving man behind the brutal killer, but Iris rejects the idea of ever getting back together (“We Made A Good Team”). 

Bright continues to live day-to-day life an SCP, growing increasingly dissatisfied with his lifestyle with each passing hour (“When You’re a Skip”). He also grows sympathetic to the plight of his fellow humanoid SCPs. Although he only embraces the “good” SCPs at first, he eventually warms up to the more dangerous ones as well (“We’re All Monsters, Really”).

During a weekly secret rendezvous with Kondraki, Bright tells of a massive breakout he is planning with his fellow SCPs. He tells her to hide in a safe place so she will not be hurt during the escape, and promises to run away with her when he is free (“What Could Go Wrong?”). Kondraki agrees, but later confesses to her butterflies that she is morally conflicted (“I’m Really Screwed Now”).

Bright springs his plan into action, with various SCP allies using their abilities to help facilitate the escape (“Freedom! Freedom!”). Many personnel are killed in the ensuing breakout, including Bright himself, but he comes back once again, this time in Dr. King’s body (“Why Do I Taste Apples?”). Bright personally releases Iris from her containment chamber, finally calling her by her proper name. Able pleads for Iris to release him, but she chooses not to (“It Wasn’t a Healthy Relationship At All, Really”).

Bright finds Kondraki, but she has had a change of heart and no longer wishes to leave. She explains that she needs to stay behind and help recontain the SCPs that wish to destroy humanity, but she still wants him to escape while he can (“Screw Professionalism (Reprise, Again)”). The two say a tearful goodbye and Bright departs while Kondraki stay behind to fight alongside her butterflies. 

After the breach, Kondraki once again has her butterflies create an illusion of Bright with his original face. Her friend, ##0645AD|Dr. Agatha Reach##, enters the enclosure, grieving the death of Dr. King, and the two commiserate over their lost loves (“Everyone I Love Dies”). Suddenly, Bright enters the room, still in King’s body, and explains that no one knew King was dead except the three of them. Reach is happy for the two of them and says that King would have wanted them to be happy. Bright and Kondraki kiss, overjoyed to be able to work together again (“A Happy Ending, Sort Of”).

In the closing scene, a group of shadowy figures monitor surveillance footage of the previous scene. As they discuss what to do, Able enters the room in a suit, revealing himself to be O5-1, head over the Overseer Council. He explains that the whole event was orchestrated by the Overseers, and that Bright may continue to live on as Dr. King. The Council meeting breaks for lunch. With the containment breach officially over, the rest of Site-19's personnel get back to work (“Secure, Contain, Protect (Reprise)”.
