title:Encounter
It's been a long day.

First the absolute //bullshit// at the hotel last night (what kind of asshole puts a family of four in a one bed smoking room?), and Sharon wetting the bed, and Tate flipping out over that (but at least he's asleep in the backseat for now, right?), and then crawling out to the car this morning to find that some jackass had hit and run torn off the back bumper in the night, and now //this.//

Stephen Forrier grumbles to himself over the staticky half tuned radio (couldn't even find a fucking station for //miles//) and tries to soothe his panicking children. Nikki and Shannon are //terrified// of storms, and it's a damn good thing Tate's a heavy sleeper, because lord knows he'd wreak havoc if the girls woke him up... Stephen sighs. This would've been so much easier if Sherri were still... Nevermind.

The car's blinking emergency lights serve only to deepen the surrounding gloom. The storm had come on heavy and fast, and Stephen had been shocked at how quickly the dark clouds had enveloped the daylight. He'd hoped to make it back into town by tonight, but no chance of that now.
