++++ Introducing MTF Theta-90
Mobile Task Force Theta-90 ("Angle Grinders")[[footnote]]Specializing in anomalous topologies, geometries and other such spacetime oddness. But what they are isn't really as important as //who// they are.[[/footnote]] was originally introduced as a one-off for [[[SCP-1707]]]. But, as there wasn't much site material that really explored behind-the-scenes slices of life in a Foundation Mobile Task Force, some writing happened. People seemed to like it, so more writing happened. (More writing will probably happen after, too.)
