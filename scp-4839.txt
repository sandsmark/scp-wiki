> Notice to the Foundation, Multiversal Iteration 2N:
> 
>By order of Eternal President Girard Niang: Earth, Multiversal Iteration 4V, has been severed from ☽☽☽ jurisdiction and left to its own devices. Further involvement on the part of the ☽☽☽ Humanity Defense Corps would have only exacerbated the situation and led to cross-dimensional casualties.
> 
> As an additional means to ensure eternal quarantine, JALAKÅRA Himself has whispered the hymn of silent flesh into Iteration 4V. While regrettable, this action was a product of absolute necessity, and executed to protect the multi-dimensional majority of humans. Fortunately, extraterrestrial life in 4V continues to thrive.
> 
> We will now provide you with 4V's document SCP-4839,[[footnote]](P.S. - it is recommended that Dr. Isaiah Henderson takes care of the infohazard decontamination. We believe he would benefit greatly from the experience.)[[/footnote]] if only as a warning. We know your cause is just -- but for your own sake, know when to stop.

]]


**Item #:** SCP-4839

**Object Class:** Keter

**Threat Level:** Black ##black|•##

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the large volume of SCP-4839 in existence, Mass Containment Zone-4839, hereafter MCZ-4839, has been constructed within [[[SCP-2400]]]. MCZ-4839 is composed of two warehouses for storage of SCP-4839, living quarters for staff, and barracks for guards. Each warehouse will be equipped with a Kullervo Suppressor, thereby neutralizing the dangerous effects of contained instances.

Items that carry SCP-4839 are to be contained as-is. Living instances are to be accommodated with nutrition and other sustenance. Deceased instances are to be contained, as well.

Acquisition of additional SCP-4839 is to be carried out through the use of Kullervo Detectors, available at every major Foundation site. Any usage of Kullervo Detectors that deviates from the provided instruction manual is grounds for immediate termination of employment with the Foundation and the administration of Class-C amnestics.

Though SCP-4839 poses no threat while contained, it is estimated that only 4% of SCP-4839 in existence is currently under containment. Failure to contain at least 70% of SCP-4839 by 12/2/2065 will result in a ZK-class reality failure scenario.

**Description:** SCP-4839 is a subatomic particle that can only be detected with a Barton-Salas Kullervo Detector[[footnote]] The Kullervo is a unit of measurement of a lethally infohazardous form of energy. Further information about Kullervo counts and their detection is restricted --to personnel with 5/4839 clearance-- the Administrator. [[/footnote]]. It is discovered SCP-4839 cannot be transferred from its host object, and does not affect the object’s mass. 

It is extradimensional in origin, and is believed to be the catalyst of another reality’s forced assimilation of our own.[[footnote]] Further information is restricted --to personnel with 5/4839 clearance-- the Administrator. [[/footnote]]

So far, SCP-4839 has been discovered in the following objects:

||~ Source ||~ Acquisition Strategy ||~ Cover Strategy ||
|| Julep-brand window-mounted air conditioners manufactured after 1986 || Julep Electric seized by the Foundation and dissolved. A product recall is in effect. ||  Asbestos contamination. ||
|| The Bangka slow loris (//Nycticebus bancanus//) || All wild instances, approximately 70% previously captive specimens, and approximately 40% of deceased specimens have been captured and contained. || The species is extinct in the wild due to climate change. ||
|| The works of the Italian baroque painter, Artemisia Gentileschi || Captured in raids; owners amnesticized. || Lost in a warehouse fire. ||
|| Leaves of the Ginkgo tree (//Ginkgo biloba//) || Acquisition ongoing. Complete containment would prove impractical; at most, 70% of live and deceased specimens can be contained. || A virus from the Mesozoic Era that preyed upon ginkgo plants has been released from Arctic permafrost due to climate change. ||

More items may be added to this list, pending the discovery of SCP-4839 elsewhere.

**Item #:** SCP-4839

**Object Class:** ##blue|Drygioni##[[footnote]]Item is currently under an official investigation for authenticity by the Overseer Council.[[[/footnote]]

--**Threat Level:** Black ##black|•##--

**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment procedures from the most current revision prior to audit are to remain in place, pending final review from the O7 council. Should the authenticity of SCP-4839’s existence, anomalous nature, and danger to the public be determined to be false, the object class will be changed to “Explained” and SCP-4839 will be decommissioned.

**Description:** --SCP-4839 is a subatomic particle that can only be detected with a Barton-Salas Kullervo Detector. It is discovered SCP-4839 cannot be transferred from its host object, and does not affect the object’s mass.--

--It is extradimensional in origin, and is confirmed to be the catalyst for the destruction of our universe by SCP-4839-Omega — a hostile, reality-bending entity from Universe-91-Lambda. SCP-4839-Omega is also known as Dread Kullervo or the Seventh Prince of Corbenic.--

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the large volume of SCP-4839 in existence, Mass Containment Zone-4839, hereafter MCZ-4839, has been constructed within [[[SCP-2400]]]. MCZ-4839 is composed of ##blue|as many# warehouses ##blue|as needed## for storage of SCP-4839, ##blue|et cetera##. Each warehouse will be equipped with a Kullervo Suppressor. 

Items that carry SCP-4839 are to be ##blue|put in boxes and never taken out.##

Acquisition of additional SCP-4839 is to be carried out ##blue|by any means necessary, and over all other Foundation priorities. In addition, due to the Administrator’s crucial function in the containment of SCP-4839, he is to be kept alive by any means necessary, as an equal priorty. All staff are advised that anomalous means to extend the human life have been retroactively approved by the O7 Council prior to their dissolution.

##blue|**Addendum - Notice from the Administrator:**##
> Look, I know there’s been a lot of changes lately. More sad people. More screaming. More people not wanting to put things in the box. More people not wanting to be in the box. More people thinking that the boxes are bad, that there are too many boxes. That I can’t fit a whole planet in a box. That too many people are dying in the boxes. That we can’t put a box of all boxes in a box, that’s a pair of ducks or something. That there’s no real reason to keep putting things in boxes. That this was all some kind of K-class scenario in itself.
> 
> It’s confusing — I get that. It makes my head hurt. It takes really, really, really, really smart people to understand it. And that’s where you guys come in! I love all the work you’re doing. You do what I can’t, because I’m not human anymore. Which is okay — just a part of give and take, right? There was a story where a guy gave his right eye to another guy for wisdom. I forget how the rest of it goes. Point being, necessary sacrifices.
> 
> You don’t think I’ve been having problems too? There’s something that makes me sad. It goes like this: see, I’m the Administrator. That means I administrate. All the things in the Foundation are here because //I have them.// And even then, there are people who think that I’m going too far. That some of the things in my boxes
