USE THE MODULE FOR UPVOTE

**Item #:** SCP-UPVT

**Object Class:** Worthy of Upvotes

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-DNVT is to be sealed in a titanium upvote, which is to be repeatedly downvoted by 17 U-Class (UPVOTE class) personnel repeatedly. Anyone who downvote this page has the big stinky and will be called a dingus, and then promptly apologized to.

**Description:** SCP-UPVT is the author page of [[*user Crocket_Lawnchair]] on the SCP wiki. For some unknown reason, Crocket_Lawnchair had demanded that any and all personnel UPVOTE this page. He has even made the joke of UPVOTE this page unfunny, as to ensure more UPVOTES. This is not reverse psychology. Crocket_Lawnchair does not want upvotes. He seeks true UPDOOT.

**Addendum:** Pages made by Crocket_Lawnchair. Listed below are several other pages made by Crocket_Lawnchair. The current leading theory on Crocket_Lawnchair's need for upvotes is the mediocrity of these pages. Along with these pages are messages written by Crocket_Lawnchair. Further study is underway.

**[[[SCP-3459]]]:** Phobia Plague. This was my first article on the site. I'm surprised it's still on the site, as I wouldn't call it anything special. But I guess it's mediocre enough to survive.

**[[[SCP-3947]]]:** Robber Duckies. I consider 3947 to be my first true article. The idea I was trying to get across is a bit ham-fisted in hindsight, but whateva. Also the only reason it's on the site is because Gigachad [[*user Doctor Cimmerian]] edited it for me and made it real good. :thumbs_up_emoji:

**[[[SCP-4201]]]:** Pizza of Mass Destruction. I look at this article and all I see is wasted potential. I tried to take a silly concept and underplayed it with melodramatic nonsense. It's my only independent work I consider "good", but it's more like mediocre.

**DOWNVOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTE**

**Revision 1:** Ok, if I ask you guys to upvote, will you downvote? Pretty please?

**Revision 2:** Attention ALL FORTNITE GAMERS, John Wick is in great danger and he needs YOUR help to wipe out all the squads in THe tilted towers. To do this, he needs a gold SCAR and a couple of chug-jugs. To help him, all he needs is your credit card number, and the three numbers on the back and the expiration month and date. But you gotta be quick so that John can secure the bag, and achieve the epic victory R O Y AL

**Revision 3:** hey this is [[*user geckoguy2704]]
