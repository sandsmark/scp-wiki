**Toe ID:** T-3027-74

**Toe Classification:** Puntera

**Toe Status:** 
||~ ||~ Hallux (Big) ||~ Prolonged (Long) ||~ Medial (Middle) ||~ Circuit (Fourth) ||~ Miniscule (Little) ||
||~ Sinister (Left) || **Halyna Ieva** || ##green|**Obtained**## || ##green|**Obtained**## || //Unknown// || ##red|**Obtained (Subsequently Detonated)**## ||
||~ Dextrous (Right) || //Unknown// || ##green|**Obtained**## || ##red|**Detonated**## || **Halyna Ieva** || **Halyna Ieva** ||

**Usage:** Potentially useful weapons of mass destruction.[[footnote]] No, I'm not kidding. I sincerely wish I was. We lost several good men to the miniscule alone. [[/footnote]] Simply put the fewer toes the Faithful Heretic has, the better.

**Verbose:** Toes collected from an as of yet unidentified anomalous human, presumably now part of her Halkost. This human's primary capabilities seemed to be centered around combustion, and for some reason this applies to their toes as well. In short, each toe can be detonated through various means like a bomb. It's believed the more inward position of the toe, the more dangerous it becomes, with the hallux toes being the most potentially destructive. A single Hallux detonation is estimated to encompass a blast radius of potentially ████ miles, effectively lifting the veil and causing a devastating amount of casualties if detonated over land. At this time, retrieving these toes is considered a top priority.

**Contemporary Concerns:** At the time of harvesting, we were only able to retrieve one toe, the sinister miniscule, the Karcist was able to take the rest. When we were safely away from her, the toe was detonated via unknown methods, presumed to be some error in those handling it. The surviving members of the party were careful to not touch the toes when bringing them back. Recently, our organization backed by a few allies attempted to retrieve the toes. Although not successful in retrieving every toe, the mission was partially successful, in both the retrieval of toes and information. However, several of our conspirators were caught escaping with the toes by her followers, and many perished in the explosion caused by what was later determined to be the dextrous medial. Strangely, at the time of recovery, two toes were missing; it is currently believed the toes are not within the possession of the Karcist and that they haven't previously been detonated by her. Of note, the Dextrous Hallux toe is missing. We are currently expending as many resources as we have into discovering what happened to that toe and retrieving it.
