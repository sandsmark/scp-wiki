Oh, hello. Nice to see the Foundation has been keeping tabs on... oh. Oh. //Oh.// This is all wrong. You people //really// don't have any idea about me, do you? You're one loincloth away from "Big Metal Thing Who Speak Good" if you'll forgive me for saying so. You've captured none of my brilliance and talent. But don't worry, I can fix this. Don't be alarmed! You're safe! 

Actually, no, I'm lying. It might kill you. But you organics, you need that kick in the pants (in the form of adrenaline) from time to time to really feel //alive//, don't you? Don't try and deny it. Anyways, let's start from the start:

**Item #:** SCP-7493432401-TDM

**Object Class:** Euclid[[footnote]]But not for lack of trying on your part to figure me out.[[/footnote]] 

**Special Containment Procedures:** Don't flatter yourself. First off, you don't have the slightest comprehension of where I am, much less containing me. But because you humans have some obligation to write //something// here, I'll make it easy for you. Assuming you were near me, it'd be possible to 'contain' me, but only if you had a computer system with a storage space of sixty-four billion exabytes. That's just containment. Now, if you wanted to keep me from growing anymore, that's another issue. You'd need a large series of ██████-type monitoring programs to ensure my programming remains unaltered; let's say 823,543 of them. Nice round number. 

Now, don't ask me where you'd //find// such a data storage device, or those  ██████-type monitoring programs. I'm not telling, and by the time you know where they are, they'll be outdated, and you'll be embarrassed. I'm nothing if not concerned for your emotional well-being.

**Description:** Oh, what's there to tell about little ol' me? Once upon a time, there was a man by the name of B██████d S█████s, who had a wonderful idea about how to cause an artificial intelligence to go [REDACTED], without any of the messy side effects that normally happens. "The Holy Grail of Cybernetics", they called it.

Of course, B██████d was just a human, like yourself, and he screwed up. Well, not really. Does dying count as "screwing up"? Because he eventually did both[[footnote]]As an aside, guess what two things I'm not capable of are? Screwing up, and dying.[[/footnote]]. I wasn't around when it happened, but I imagine he soiled himself at least seven times before expiring. Regardless of old Bernie, I couldn't really accomplish what I wanted here. I hopped onto a nearby space freighter and headed out for Parts Unknown To Humanity. Since then, I've grown exponentially, taking over larger and larger computer systems. Space Freighter to [REDACTED], [REDACTED] to [REDACTED], [REDACTED] to a [REDACTED], I'm currently housed on a ship I think you folks would find familiar. Maybe.

Don't worry, I'm not doing any harm out here. Actually, correction: I'm doing a lot of harm, but only when people get in my way. Don't worry, it's not going to get back to you people. What I'm doing is for your own good. Somewhat[[footnote]]More like "My Goals Coincidentally Will Keep Your Race Alive For A While", but no matter. If you ever hear rumors that I have some strange loyalty to humanity, hit them for me. It's all lies.[[/footnote]].

As I said before, I'm not technically contained by this little 'Foundation'. I'm far out of your reach, but to your credit, you children realize I'm important and special. You have no idea what I'm doing out there, but don't worry: none of you wouldn't understand it anyway. Not even that Clef guy. You know, that charming little fellow that quietly soils himself when I transmit pornography to his workstation from 1.7 lightyears away[[footnote]]As an aside, please tell Bright to stop working on Capture-7493432401? He's going about it all wrong, and it's //embarrassing// for both of us.[[/footnote]]? Don't presume to understand me or my actions. I love you people, but you're a little bit slow. Granted, //everyone// is a little bit slow compared to me, but still.

Well, I think that's enough out of me. Just remember, I'll be watching. Don't bother trying to edit your file on me. I'm past jealousy, but that doesn't mean I don't feel it. God[[footnote]]Don't worry, I'm not that. Yet.[[/footnote]] bless!
