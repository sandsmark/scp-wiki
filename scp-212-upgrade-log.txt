**Record of exposure to SCP-212**

**Attention:**  Any and all exposure to SCP-212 is to be recorded and logged.  Unreported exposure to SCP-212 will be met with termination.  All subjects willingly exposed to SCP-212 must have O5 Command approvals, as well as that of site medical staff.

**Subject:**
Agent ████████: 28 years old, 210 lbs, 6’1” tall, African-American descent.  Submitted request on ██-██-████, approval granted and exposed on ██-██-████

**Description of Upgrades:**
Lower jaw bone replaced by super-dense ceramic jaw, teeth replaced with blades made of the same material.  Spine removed and replaced with synthetic polymer.  Replacement spine grafted to base of skull.  Rib cage and pelvis coated with thin layer of ceramic.  Lungs, eyes, and liver removed and replaced after “cleaning.”

**Subject Status:** Active duty.  

//Notes:  SCP-212 will appear to “clean” some organs or tissues.  It will run several “attachments” over the tissue, each of which will spray, scan, cut, or otherwise interact with the tissue before replacing it.  When tested, these “cleaned” tissues appear totally free of genetic defects, and appear younger then the surrounding tissues.//

**Subject:**
Dr. ████: 42 year old, 143lbs, 5’8”, Caucasian (British) descent.  Submitted request on ██-██-████, approval granted and exposed on ██-██-████

**Description of Upgrades:**
Teeth replaced with super-dense ceramic.  Feet amputated at the ankle, replaced by a thin plastic latticework, with several pads on the bottom.  These pads are capable of sticking to any solid surface, and can carry up to 500lbs.  Bone marrow removed and replaced with a blue gel.  Heart, eyes, liver, and kidneys removed and “cleaned.”  Several metal devices inserted into the brain, for unknown purpose.

**Subject Status:** Subject died during the removal of bone marrow.  “Footpads” removed, and are currently under study.

**Subject:**
"Agent A.A.": <PERSONAL DATA REDACTED>. Suffered severe injuries on ██-██-████ resulting in traumatic amputation of all four limbs and removal of spleen, left kidney, right lung, and left eye. Cranial trauma caused by shard of circuitry piercing skull and entering left frontal lobe of brain. Submitted request on ██-██-████, approval granted and exposed on ██-██-████

**Description of Upgrades:**
Contrary to expectations, [[[SCP-212]]] did not remove the shard of metal from subject's brain, instead spending approximately seven (7) minutes analyzing the circuitry with a variety of lenses, probes, and sensors before apparently determining that the foreign body could be left in place. SCP-212 then proceeded to integrate said circuitry into subject's frontal lobe more fully, utilizing tracery made of room-temperature superconductors. SCP-212 ended by administering an unknown chemical that immediately placed the subject in a coma, then shut itself down. No attempts were made to replace severed limbs or repair damage to bodily organs, aside from normal “cleaning.”

**Subject Status:** As of ██-██-████, subject remains in a chemically induced coma, in stable condition. Foreign circuitry in brain appears to be spreading at a geometric rate. Estimate complete replacement of biological brain tissue in <DATA EXPUNGED>.

**Subject:** 
Agent █████: 34 years old, 248lbs, 5’10” tall, Caucasian (German) descent.  Submitted request on ██-██-████, approval granted and exposed on ██-██-████

**Description of Upgrades:** 
Removal of stomach, intestines (large and small), liver and kidneys.  Organs replaced with two “sacks” of synthetic tissues, attached to the esophagus.  Esophagus lined with the same tissue.  “Sacks” produce an acid capable of breaking down steel, and transfer all nutrition directly to the blood stream.  This process produces no waste, and any indigestible matter is expelled up the esophagus and out the mouth.  Eyes replaced with optic sensor pads capable of seeing visible, infrared, and ultraviolet light spectrum.  Hands removed at the wrist and each replaced with eight metallic “tentacles,” each measuring 1 ½’ long. 

**Subject Status:** Medical leave until ██-██-████, to allow adjustment to new internal structures.

**Subject:** 
D-█████, 23 years old, 141lbs, 5’11” tall, Caucasian (American) descent. Previously exposed to [[[SCP-217]]] and decontaminated once the virus had run its course (full mechanical conversion achieved). Approval for testing granted on █-█-████.

**Description of Upgrades:** 
[DATA EXPUNGED]

**Subject Status:** Subject escaped containment, overpowering two armed personnel and effortlessly bypassing several security measures. Subject recaptured after 2 hours, having caused █ casualties and ██ injuries, as well as deactivating [DATA EXPUNGED]. Once recaptured, subject requested SCP classification (presumably in an attempt to avoid termination). Request was denied, and subject was dismantled. Components were incinerated following examination and documentation (see file [REDACTED]).

**Subject:**
Agent ████: 25 years old, 93kg, 1.88m, African-American descent.  Submitted request on ██-██-████, approval granted and exposed on ██-██-████

**Description of Upgrades:**
Skin replaced with nanomaterial mesh of thick tubes coated in microscopic barbs. Tips of fingers and toes replaced with carbon claws, about 8 cm long. Limb bones restructured for quadrupedal stance. Heart and lungs replaced by single organ, with a second similar organ as backup. Digestive system "cleaned" and shortened significantly. Left eye replaced with ultrasound sensor.

**Subject Status:** Stable but behaving erratically, contained pending psychological analysis.
