██-██-████, ████:██:██ - Accidental exposure of [[[SCP-447]]]'s slime to a dead body has caused one of its many unfortunate results. Having awoken in a world much like my own, I believed myself fortunate enough to have suffered only a minor concussion. However, I soon discovered, after attempting to use my PDA to log into Scip-Net, that my conclusions were false.

I appear to have been deposited into an alternate reality where the Foundation has failed in its mission, and the Special Containment Procedures artifacts now run rampant. What remains of the Foundation appears to be made up entirely of SCPs, some of which have clear analogues to those of my home dimension, some of which do not. Most of them, however, appear to be alternate versions of the SCPs that I know.

My objectives are threefold.

* First, to investigate and document the nature of the alternate universe.
* To determine whether the alternate universe poses a threat to our baseline reality, and to formulate a plan for later neutralization.
* To determine whether there are salvageable assets from the alternate universe for later retrieval.

I have a fourth objective. As of late, it has been the unfortunate tendency of the Foundation to treat humanoid SCPs as assets to be coddled, or threats to be appeased, not as dangerous artifacts to be contained. As initial investigation into this universe would seem to indicate that this world's Foundation employs an unusually large number of SCPs, it is my belief that investigation of this alternate reality will shed light on the unavoidable consequences of, shall we say, letting the prisoners run the prison.

Oh yes. I suppose finding a way back to my home dimension would be important as well.

██-██-████, ████:██:██ - It has been many years since I last had to use my SCP Foundation survival manual. As suspected, the information within is rather inaccurate, or at best, elementary. Also as suspected, it does make wonderful toilet paper.

Note to self: Please contact O5-██ upon return to home dimension and ask that a more comprehensive and up-to-date survival manual be prepared.

Upon initial investigation, it appears that there are two major differences between this world and my home dimension.

* Humanity has failed to evolve noses.
* The SCPs have taken over the Foundation.

I am unsure whether these two facts are related or not.
