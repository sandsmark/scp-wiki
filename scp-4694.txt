**Item:** SCP-4694
 
**Object Class:** Keter
 
**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment centers on minimising civilian exposure to SCP-4694, discrediting the organisation through disinformation campaigns, and sanitising all references to SCP-4694 wherever they arise. 

Where exposure has already occurred, anti-memetic deprogramming protocols within existing civilian cult/indoctrination survivor support networks apply. All reindoctrination research results should be notified to the Lead Project Parapsychologist.

SCP-4694-L instances (see Figure 1) should be recovered where possible and secured in sight/sound-proof containers at the site most local to recovery. 

There are no plans to contain the Cherished Leaders. 

**Description:** SCP-4694 is an emergent para-dimensional phenomena manifesting in this reality as a multi-level marketing company (MLM). 

SCP-4694 is characterized by an extreme personality cult built around the “Cherished Leaders,” an as-yet unidentified collective who direct and control members (known as “Associates”) through both mundane peer pressure, cult programming and anomalous positive/negative reinforcement.  

The primary purpose of mundane MLMs is the generation of revenue through the recruitment of new members. SCP-4694’s primary purpose is unknown, although recovered media and promotional material suggests the importance of belonging and family values.

* Transcript: Femaile Voiceover: //"PryMaid: the Generation of Happiness. Prymaid is the world's fastest growing company, with more than three million Associates in the US alone. Recognition Day is our way of saying, "Thank you for believing in us," but even more, "Thank you for believing in yourselves." As a Recognized Associate, you'll take part in self-affirming, positive action such as Family Blessings, corporate off-world learning opportunities and, if you're an infertile human male, familial role repositioning. PryMaid: the Generation of Happiness."//

**SCP-4694 Sub-classes:**

**New Associates** (SCP-4694-A)
* Exposed to mild-medium memetic effects comparable to indoctrination.

**Recognised Associates** (SCP-4694-RA)
* Fully indoctrinated into the PryMaid organization.
* Exposed to highly anomalous phenomena.

**Likenesses** (SCP-4694-L)
* Morphy Richards Turbo Steam electric irons, model 40694.
* Thought to act as a conduit between Associates and the Cherished Leaders.
* Play a focal role in daily life.

**The Cherished Leaders** (SCP-4694-CL)
* Locations, identities, numbers and motives are unknown. 
* It is not proven that the Likenesses and the Cherished Leaders are not one and the same.  

To date, the Foundation has assisted the defection of fifteen Associates. None describe their experiences within SCP-4694 as out of the ordinary or unusual.  In December 2016 field agent Aaron Zachary successfully infiltrated the organisation by befriending a known female Associate (codename "Autoship"); following is an extract of his outbound communications.

||~ Date/Time: ||~ Comms ||
|| 2016-10-18 10:17 || Now FB friends with //Autoship//. These guys usually recruit out of their social/ family/work networks so now I'm just waiting for the inevitable “money message." ||  
|| 2016-11-01 13:26 || It’s here in my inbox - //Autoship// has an "exciting new lifestyle opportunity" for me – as expected, I’ve been invited to a “PryMaid Party.” || 
|| 2016-11-06 21:57 || PryMaid Party was... Odd. They just buy and sell electric irons to each other. At a cost of $3400 in set up costs I am now an Associate.||
|| 2016-11-24 || //Autoship// set me my first challenge. Like homework. Write down nine things I want PryMaid to help me achieve. ||
|| 2016-12-01 || Challenge #4, write down 27 things I don't like about myself. Share on PrySpace.[[footnote]]PryMaid social media network[[/footnote]] ||
|| 2016-12-25 19:11 || Christmas. //Autoship// has irons in her kitchen, her bedroom, her bathroom. No TVs, just irons where the TVs should be. Her Nativity Scene? Three Wise Men overlooking an electric iron in a manger. An electric iron Baby Jesus. Go figure. || 
|| 2017-04-27 06:30 || We have a Recognition Day in June. I'll become a fully fledged Associate. God bless America. This week's challenge: Post a video about the top eight hundred things you hate most about the non-PryMaid authority figures in your life. Done and done.|| 
|| 2017-06-29 02:35 || Final challenge this week: find all skin care products in the house and bury them. Random, but done. Recognition Day tomorrow. The Cherished Leaders are going to be there. The Cherished Leaders. I feel sick. || 
|| 2017-06-29 03:37 || We’re on the Greyhound. On our way. Butterflies, nausea, excitement. I’ll try to remember to record it for y’all. Can't wait to see the Cherished Leaders.|| 
|| 2017-06-30 06:27 || Vegas. There are thousands of us here. Wow. Recognition Day. We’re actually going to meet the Cherished Leaders. My wife would //love// this. I know she doesn't get it yet, but she //will//.|| 
|| 2017-06-30 07:45 || It's starting. Here we go. ||

> //Audience jeers and catcalls enthusiastically//.
>

Positive people, positive messages - because //negativity// grows like a cancer, like an old man's cancer that spreads from a photograph taken at a wedding reception when he didn't even know he //had// cancer, and it engulfs everything. The people in the photograph, the photograph itself, the photo frame, the mantelpiece it sat on, the arthritic pet dog that moved too slow to escape the metastasis as it overtook the room... And then the walls, the roof... [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2962 The whole house]... Eventually the whole world. Eventually the whole //universe//. All riddled with cancer. All bloating and blossoming and bubbling away. And then who knows where.

Agent Zachary has made no further attempt to contact Autoship, and Foundation operatives have been unable to reinitiate surveillance.

Within three weeks Zachary had recruited his wife, three children and extended family into the PryMaid organisation.  On 2017-10-30 Zachary was amnesticized to remove sensitive Foundation knowledge and taken into Foundation custody.

The following is an excerpt from a series of interviews relating to his experiences within PryMaid.

> 
> **Dr Bufirst:** Hi Aaron. Today I'd like us to go through a typical day. 
>  
> **Zachary:** Great. What day is it today?
> 
> **Dr J Bufirst:** Wednesday. 
> 
> **Zachary:** Yeah, Wednesdays are special. Wednesdays we perform the Family Blessings. 
> 
> **Dr J Bufirst:** Explain it like I’m new.
> 
> **Zachary:** I call it "Brand Loyalty." Cyndie thinks it's in bad taste but whatever. Wednesdays are like mini Recognition Days but just for us - myself, Cyndie, the kids. We use the basement. I put an icebox in and we were good to go.
> 
> **Dr Bufirst:** Why the basement?
> 
> **Zachary:** Easiest to soundproof.
> 
> **Dr Bufirst:** Soundproof?
> 
> **Zachary:** The Family Blessings really help us gel as a family – but you don’t get that without a few tears along the way. You know what five year olds are like.
> 
> **Dr Bufirst:** You mentioned an icebox? 
> 
> **Zachary:** Yeah that’s for //after// the Family Blessings - after we've used the Likenesses.
> 
> **Dr Bufirst:** I don't follow. How do you - ?
> 
> **Zachary:** Easiest if I show you.
> 
> //Zachary stands up and starts to unbutton his shirt.//
> 
> **Zachary:** We all have the Likenesses in our homes. They watch over you in the kitchen, in the car, in the shower. Sometimes though that isn't practical. Can’t go swimming with a Likeness (laughs). //This// way the Cherished Leaders are always with you, always. Damn buttons.
> 
> //Zachary fumbles with shirt and exposes torso, chest, shoulder and upper arms.//
> 
> **Dr Bufirst:** You look normal enough. 
> 
> **Zachary:** Yeah. I have to //want// you to see or you won't. After Recognition Day, you can see - you can //recognise// other Associates everywhere - you see it all over them - it's like we're taking over. You starting to see? Looks beautiful on the kids. You remember ”Brand Loyalty?” Well this bit's “Brand awareness.”  Emphasis on //brand.//

On 2018-11-27 Zachary disappeared from his containment unit. He reappeared six hours later in a state of extreme distress; in his possession was a [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2982 Televono] Telefex Vivisect 4 smartphone, which he states he had been given to take video footage of a PryMaid "Learning Camp" at an unknown location. His disappearance was allegedly an unscheduled reward from PryMaid for "services rendered." He was unable to confirm the nature of his breach. 

The following audio clip was recorded at the Learning Camp.

They don't like you. They say you're a Stinky Thinker.
