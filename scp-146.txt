**Item #:** SCP-146

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**

Containment procedures have been revised after it was noted that the effects of SCP-146 were sharply and dangerously increased under previous containment (a standard one half (0.5) cubic meter secure storage bin). The bin should remain free, however, should a researcher wish to test SCP-146 at high intensity. During normal storage, SCP-146 is to be kept on its pedestal in a wall alcove of its storage room, measuring no less than five (5) x ten (10) meters with the ceiling painted to resemble a clear daytime sky. The room is to be kept lit with standard lighting at all times and furnished with potted plants. If possible, the interior walls should be stuccoed orfaux-stuccoed. Experimentation with different interior decorations has shown that SCP-146 seems to prefer this arrangement and to have aesthetic preferences consistent with the aristocracy of Rome during the Late Republican period (c. 120-80BCE ). While this containment is standard, researchers with clearance Level 2 or higher may experiment with different containment settings in order to modify the effects of SCP-146. While SCP-146 is non-motile and therefore requires little security, any personnel entering its containment area or handling it in any way must be sure not to make eye contact withSCP-146, lest they be affected. SCP-146 has not demonstrated the ability to penetrate even simple black cloth, so containment is not difficult, but as with prior containment, SCP-146's properties will be magnified after any time spent concealed.

**Description:**

SCP-146 is a hollow bronze head, apparently a fragment of a complete statue or bust, depicting a crowned young woman or perhaps an effeminate young man. The head is made of bronze and exhibits severe verdigris over much of its surface. The crown is inlaid with silver decorations, and the eyes, apparently the sources of SCP-146's effect, are also beaten silver, shined to be somewhat reflective. To date SCP-146 has not exhibited any signs of movement, but its seeming preference for certain decorations in its containment area indicates that it may possess a degree of sentience, if not outright sapience. If SCP-146 is able to communicate conversationally, it has not yet done so.

SCP-146 exhibits the ability to access and bring to mind the memories of those who make eye contact with it. These memories tend to be tied to a sense of guilt or shame. This effect increases over time in both vividness and intensity. Upon initial eye contact, recent memories will begin to surface. Subjects who have ignored a friend in the hall or exceeded the speed limit will be reminded of this and begin to feel mildly guilty, whether or not they would normally care about the event. After initial eye contact, it is only necessary that subjects remain somewhere in SCP-146's field of vision, though continual eye contact speeds the process. As time goes on, older memories will begin to be recalled, and the level of shame associated with the memories increases. After approximately thirty (30) minutes, the memories will move from being vivid recollections to complete hallucinations, with subjects unable to distinguish the past from the present. Subjects have been observed to regress in personality, if the memory is associated with childhood trauma. Any test subjects exposed for over thirty (30) minutes should be restrained both for their own safety and the safety of others. After sixty (60) minutes, all subjects to date have completely retreated into a memory, and to date no subject has been restored to consciousness from the near-catatonic hallucination. Subjects must be fed intravenously and are unresponsive, save for occasional murmurings consistent with their regression.

It has also been noted that when subjects recall a shameful event, they will often feel compelled to make amends for their actions. In the case of minor offenses, this is less of a problem and has in some cases led to greater unity among the staff. However, a problem arises when the subject cannot make amends, either because the offended party cannot be contacted or because the transgression is simply irredeemable. In such cases, subjects have either fallen into deep depression or turned to some form of self-punishment. It varies from subject to subject, with some putting forth renewed positive efforts in order to "balance out" their guilt, and others turning to self mutilation and even suicide. Please see the attached experiment logs for detailed cases.

SCP-146 was acquired from a Mr. ████ ███████ of Birmingham, UK. Mr. ███████ had acquired SCP-146 during the estate sale of a renowned philanthropist, the late ████████ ██████████, Lord of █████████████. It was purchased in a lot with a number of other artifacts for £█████. When Mr. ███████ began to experience SCP-146's effects, he began seeing a psychiatrist, Undercover Agent UA33-56G. Mr. ███████ was put into an institution and SCP-146 was taken into Foundation custody. UA33-56G's notes on Mr. ███████'s mental state are available for study by researchers of Level 2 or higher, filed as Document SCP-146-A.

**Experiment Log #146-01**

In order to calibrate a baseline for SCP-146's effect, subject D-044323 was put into a standard four (4) by four (4) meter interrogation room. Subject was restrained and made to look directly at SCP-146, which was placed on a table inside a protective plexiglass case. Researchers communicated with the subject via intercom through the testing process. Subject voiced immediate discomfort and closed his eyes, with his heartrate jumping by 15 BPM. With prompting, subject related the memories he was recalling, beginning with minor breaches of behavior protocol. Subject then recalled several altercations with other prisoners before his being taken by the Foundation, including a particularly graphic description of [DATA REDACTED]. Researchers noted that as time went on, the subject became more cooperative and his speech patterns changed, resembling someone undergoing theraputic hypnosis. After fifteen (15) minutes, subject's responses became slurred and his EEG patterns showed similarities to someone experiencing vivid dreams. Subject entered into one half of a dialogue which culminated in his trying to break his restraints. After a time he ceased thrashing and began to cry. He begged someone in his hallucination to "Stop. Take it back. Don't. I won't do it again. I'm sorry. I don't want to. Not again. Stop... Please..." This continued until he reached the sixty (60) minute mark, at which point his vocalizations halted and his EEG showed signs consistent with coma. After an additional hour, after no further effects were observed, subject was removed and euthanized. Post-mortem examination of his brain noted abnormal levels of █████████ and █████-███████, which neuropathologist Dr. █████████ described as indicative of [DATA REDACTED].
//(NOTE: At this point, SCP-146 was being kept along with the other artifacts purchased at auction, because it was not yet known that the effect was confined to SCP-146 alone. -Professor Skali █████████)//

**Experiment Log #146-04**

In the first experiment conducted after it was determined that SCP-146 consisted only of the bronze head (and after SCP-146 had been moved to a standard one-half (0.5) cubic meter storage bin), subject D-044784 was exposed to SCP-146 and bound, as with prior experiments, hand and foot to a steel chair. Subject reported an immediate headache and began to cry. Subject's heartrate jumped to 180 BMP then dropped rapidly to 40 BPM and subject lost consciousness.  After medical personnel entered the room and began examining her, the subject regained consciousness, her heartrate spiked to 175 BPM, and the she began to strain against her restraints. The subject was able to break the restraint on her right arm, severely damaging her own arm and hand in the process. Paramedic D. █████████ was injured as she struck him in order to gain access to his first-aid kit. She was able to snatch up a small scalpel before guards entered and proceeded to jam it into her own neck. She bled out before the paramedics and guards could regain control of the situation.
//(NOTE: After several similar incidents it was determined that SCP-146's ability was affected by its containment. Anyone wishing to do further research must take this into account as even brief accidental exposure could prove harmful. -Professor Skali █████████)//
