**Experiment Log of:** Agent T███, testing practical uses of SCP-295-1. Experiments overseen and approved by Dr. ██████

**Date:** █/██/███
------

__**Experiment 1:**__ Usage as lighter fluid (revised)

**Materials: 1 ml SCP-295-1, 500 g consumer grade charcoal, mid-range coal grill, 2x100 g beef burger patties

**Procedure:** Coals arranged in a standard rough cone. SCP-295-1 applied to three coals. Tester wore standard "silver suit" heat protection gear.

**Result:** The treated coals combusted almost instantly, as expected. Remaining coals ignited very quickly. Patties cooked in approximately half expected time. Cooked patties, when tested in laboratory, showed no evidence of any unusual components.

//Note: As expected, the secondary fires produce only normal combustion products and effects. And to whoever came up with the first lighter fluid test: You people are supposed to be **research** assistants. Perhaps next time, you should do some research when you design a test? Dr. Kondraki let you off easy.// - Agent T███

__**Experiment 2:**__ Possible application for rescue work

**Materials:** 1 D class personnel, 1 steel girder, 1 ml SCP-295-1, 20 g thermite paste.

**Procedure:** Class D's leg trapped under girder. A line of thermite paste was place on the girder upslope from the pinned leg, SCP-295-1 applied to the thermite paste.

**Result:** The thermite ignited and combusted almost instantly, severing the girder with almost no splatter or spark. The upslope section fell to the ground. Water thrown over the severed end steamed only slightly. D Class was not harmed.

//Note: Just what I'd hoped for: The thermite released its energy and burned through the steel it was actually touching, but the reaction was too fast for much heat to transfer to the rest of the girder. This could be a very useful intrusion technique in addition to its rescue applications.// - Agent T███
