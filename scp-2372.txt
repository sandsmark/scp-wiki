**Item #:** SCP-2372

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2372 is to be kept in a cryonic containment unit at Site-168. The temperature of the containment unit is to be maintained within a range between 2 ºC to 4 ºC. SCP-2372-A's requests for its detachment from SCP-2372 are to be denied. SCP-2372-A is to be told that it will be slated for experiments to detach it from SCP-2372 in exchange for its cooperation in translating for SCP-2372.

**Description:** SCP-2372 is the preserved corpse of the late Chen ███-██, impervious to decomposition. Grains of powdered jade and silk threads are found embedded into SCP-2372's subcutis, evenly distributed throughout its body. Scarring and stitching found on SCP-2372 is indicative of amateur surgical procedures.

SCP-2372 can produce a groan-like sound from its mouth despite the inability for its vocal folds to vibrate, which functions as its method of communication; see Paragraph 4 of **Description**. In addition, it generates a fog from its umbilicus. Analysis of water droplets in the fog has identified trace amounts of pre-ejaculatory fluid.  

SCP-2372-A is an incorporeal humanoid entity which manifests from the fog generated from SCP-2372, which resembles Chen's upper torso. It is sapient and identifies itself as Chen ███-██. Through vibration of its constituent water particles, SCP-2372-A is capable of speech and demonstrates equal proficiency in Cantonese as Chen ███-██.

SCP-2372-A is the only known individual which can comprehend sounds made by SCP-2372, regularly conversing with it. From SCP-2372-A's perspective, it and SCP-2372 have an apparently antagonistic relationship. While SCP-2372's perspective on its relationship with SCP-2372-A cannot be enquired independently, it is found to occasionally secrete pre-ejaculatory fluid from its urethra while interacting with SCP-2372-A. 

SCP-2372 was recovered from the Victoria Public Mortuary in Hong Kong on ██/██/1987, when SCP-2372-A manifested during SCP-2372's autopsy. After retrieving the corpse, the incident was dismissed as a hallucination on the coroner's part. An urn filled with ashes of cremated animals was presented to the kin of Chen ███-██.

> **Foreword:** The following interview is originally conducted in Cantonese. 
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Agent Park:** Hello, please state your identity. 
> 
> **SCP-2372-A:** Chen ███-██. It's good that someone decides not to run away and scream. 
> 
> **Agent Park:** But you can't be Mr. Chen. Isn't he already deceased? 
> 
> **SCP-2372-A:** Yeah, thanks for reminding me that. Now if you could be a dear, help me please.
> 
> **Agent Park:** In what manner? 
> 
> [SCP-2372-A points to SCP-2372.]
> 
> **SCP-2372-A:** Get this thing off me!
> 
> **Agent Park:** You mean, your body?
> 
> **SCP-2372-A:** Yeah, I'm stuck with that thing. 
> 
> [SCP-2372 groans. SCP-2372-A turns away from Agent Park.]
> 
> **SCP-2372-A:** Hey, don't you give me that! You're a sinful waste of flesh and soul!
> 
> **Agent Park:** Are you talking to your body?  
> 
> **SCP-2372-A:** Can't you tell? Look, I made a grave mistake in life and I need you to remo-
> 
> [SCP-2372 groans.]
> 
> **SCP-2372-A:** No, it was definitely a mistake! We are supposed to go our separate ways after death. Me up there, and you down there!
> 
> [SCP-2372 groans.]
> 
> **SCP-2372-A:** No no no! This was not worth the jade suit! [[footnote]] In the original transcript, SCP-2372-A uses the term "玉衣" (pinyin: yù yī; literally "jade suit"). It refers to the "jade burial suit", a ceremonial burial suit composed of jade, traditionally utilised for the burial of Han Dynasty royalty. Jade burial suits were believed to delay the decomposition of the bodily soul (or 魄; pinyin: pò). [[/footnote]] I'm not paying the price for my stupidity in life with my afterlife!

> **Agent Park:** What is this jade suit? 
> 
> [SCP-2372 groans.]
> 
> **SCP-2372-A:** Screw you! We do not have that kind of relationship!

> **Foreword:** The following interview is originally conducted in Cantonese.

> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Dr. Tsang:** SCP-2372-A, can you tell more about the circumstances about this jade suit of yours? 
> 
> **SCP-2372-A:** Yeah, it was-
> 
> [SCP-2372 groans.]
> 
> **SCP-2372-A:** Hush you! Like I was saying, I got it from Old Chin, the "self-proclaimed" miracle surgeon from the Walled City. [[footnote]] Said individual was not found in the address given by SCP-2372-A during a Foundation-led raid on the Kowloon Walled City. Residents claimed that Old Chin had fled due to recent harassment from triad organisations. [[/footnote]]

> **Dr. Tsang:** Kowloon Walled City?
> 
> **SCP-2372-A:** Yeah, a few years back.  
> 
> **Dr. Tsang:** Do give us the address later. But I want to know why did you choose to do this operation? 
> 
> **SCP-2372-A:** Well, I used to work in the cemetery and handle corpses all the time. When you see those dead bodies so many times, I thought I would be like them someday. And boy, I do not want-
> 
> [SCP-2372 groans.]
> 
> **SCP-2372-A:** Get your head out of the gutter! I did not do it for you!

> [SCP-2372 groans]
> 
> **Dr. Tsang:** What did SCP-2372 say?
> 
> **SCP-2372-A:** Irrelevant. That thing does not represent me. 
> 
> [SCP-2372 groans.]
> 
> **Dr. Tsang:** SCP-2372-A, we've agreed on this. If you insist on not giving us accurate translation of SCP-2372's words, we cannot help you. It's your choice. 
> 
> **SCP-2372-A:** Okay, but please don't take its word for it. It claims that I – I mean, Chen ███-██ – was into himself... physically speaking. 
> 
> **Dr. Tsang:** And you do not believe it's true?
> 
> **SCP-2372-A:** Doctor, I'm his //hún//. [[footnote]] 魂; pinyin: hún; a term commonly translated as the ethereal soul. [[/footnote]] I think I know Chen ███-██ more than anyone else in this world. 
> 
> [SCP-2372 groans.]
> 
> **SCP-2372-A:** No, you don't know him. You're just projecting your fantasies on us. What makes you think that way?
> 
> [SCP-2372 groans.]
> 
> **Dr. Tsang:** 2372-A, please leave the questioning to me. And translation, please? 
> 
> **SCP-2372-A:** It insisted that it knew Chen as well as I do, which is false. 
> 
> [SCP-2372 groans.]
> 
> **SCP-2372-A:** No, you are definitely sick in that rotting head of yours. Chen ███-██ was not relieving you whenever he was looking at those magazines. 
> 
> [SCP-2372 groans.]
> 
> **SCP-2372-A:** God! Just because his hand was on you doesn't mean he was thinking about you. He was never into himself, I mean, you. 
> 
> [SCP-2372 groans.] 
> 
> **SCP-2372-A:** I've already explained it! Chen ███-██ just wants to keep himself together after death. 
> 
> [SCP-2372 groans.]
> 
> **SCP-2372-A:** Not in that way, you pervert!
