**Item #:** SCP-3633

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3633 is to be kept in a standard safe-type anomalous locker. SCP-3633 is to be inspected once a day for new pictures.

**Description:** SCP-3633 is a smartphone with a cracked screen and significant damage to its back casing. Despite the damage, SCP-3633 operates as a regular smart phone. The phone requires no passcode, so one can access all information, apps, and settings without difficulty. There are two contacts in the phone, one labeled "Me" and the other labeled "Behind Me", both of which had no functioning phone number.

When SCP-3633's camera is activated, the screen display becomes too dark to distinguish any features from the photo. This is occasionally interjected with still images, however these images are too blurry to accurately identify.

SCP-3633 has received a total of three calls while in containment: two from "Me" and one from "Behind Me". While the phone rang, the screen became unresponsive, and personnel were unable to answer the calls. The only voicemail was by "Behind Me", which consisted of three minutes of leaves rustling, followed by a 'crack'. After this was fifteen seconds of a high pitch creak, followed by a mechanical clicking noise that ended the call.

There is no record of The Foundation's acquisition of SCP-3633, although it has been noted that SCP-3633's container at one point had the words "In Front" scratched into it. SCP-3633 was subsequently moved to a different container.

**Addendum SCP-3633-1:** Researchers attempted to communicate with "Me" and "Behind Me". The following is the results from these tests. Communications sent from SCP-3633 by the Foundation are labeled "SCP-3633". 
 
> //4:12// - **SCP-3633:** Hello? Is anyone here?
> 
> //4:12// - **Me:** 🙈
> 
> //4:12// - **Behind Me:** 👀
> 
> //4:13// - **SCP-3633:** Who are you?
> 
> //4:15// - **SCP-3633:** What are you?
> 
> //4:22// - **SCP-3633:** Hello?
> 
> //11:47// - **Behind Me:** 🤐

No further responses have been recorded.

**Addendum SCP-3633-2:** At sporadic intervals, SCP-3633 began receiving texts from "Me" and "Behind Me" regardless of SCP-3633's cellular connection. These texts always appeared in pairs, with one of the contacts sending a picture with a caption, and the other contact sending a text. 

The text messages differed from the normal messaging format used previously by SCP-3633, however all screen shots of these texts created a picture of static. Therefore, transcriptions of the messages received from SCP-3633 are presented instead. The name of each file as well as the content of the messages was transcribed exactly, including replicable stylistic and aesthetic details.

After the final message was sent, views from the camera showed only a single image:
