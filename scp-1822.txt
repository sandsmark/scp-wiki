**Item #:** SCP-1822

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** ##red|Containment Procedures outdated, please see below.## SCP-1822 has been shown to uniformly permeate 100% of the observable universe, and therefore cannot be contained. Thankfully, SCP-1822 does not pose a significant risk to the public or Foundation operations. Therefore, containment efforts are to be focused on minimizing knowledge of the extent of SCP-1822's properties. Foundation agents stationed in various sites of interest such as places of academia, statistics and research laboratories are to monitor and report any findings that may lead to the discovery of SCP-1822's anomalous qualities.

Following the events of Incident Log 1822.1, testing with SCP-1822 is restricted to observation only. At no time are any Kant-Sennheiser Kismet Ratio counters to be placed in reality-warping environments.

Upgrade to subclassification Euclid-Red[[footnote]] Designation given to anomalies which possess Euclid-level hazardous effects but cannot be contained or may worsen if containment is attempted. [[/footnote]] pending administrative approval.

**Description:** SCP-1822 is the designation for a set of anomalous empirical proofs of mathematical statistics and their related laws, including most █████ laws, ████'s law, the ██████ principle, and the ██████-█████████ law,[[footnote]]Note. See: Smith "Metaphysics and the Science of Patterns". From //Comparative Perspectives of Anomalous Phenomena (1898-2004)// (Foundation Academic Archives, 2014), p. 433[[/footnote]] which show an unexplained proportionality between unrelated phenomena and present in large sets of data. SCP-1822 implies that the ratio of ██.█:██.█ is universally constant throughout many seemingly random forms of both //qualia//[[footnote]] The otherwise subjective or ineffable portions of the conscious human experience. [[/footnote]] and concrete probability, and therefore gives rise to predictable patterns of behavior in systems that should otherwise be highly variable. To date, the Foundation has been actively trying to suppress knowledge of SCP-1822 for over two centuries. The first recorded knowledge of SCP-1822 that was confiscated was a set of Greek texts from ████ B.C.E., describing the nature of the anomaly and posits several theories into the origin of the phenomena. SCP-1822 has no discernible source, although explorations into alternate realities reveal {{[DATA REDACTED, SEE BELOW]}}.

**Addendum 1822.1:** Interview Logs / Excerpts
[[collapsible show="+ ACCESS 1822-043/IN-01-8" hide="cd.."]]
//The following is a series of relevant interviews, snippets and excerpts pertaining to SCP-1822.//

> **Interviewee:** George Rosenthal
> **Interviewer:** Dr. H. Alexander
> **Date:** 3/██/19██
> **Preface:** Mr. Rosenthal is a agriculturalist from ██████, Wisconsin. Rosenthal reportedly came across evidence of SCP-1822 while reviewing purchase, inventory and quality reports of various crops he was cultivating. Subject reportedly spoke openly about the phenomenon on a public forum, prompting Foundation investigation. Subject released post interview upon application of Class-B Amnestics.

> **Dr. Alexander:** And how exactly did this come to your attention?
> 
> **Rosenthal:** I mean, how do you //not// notice? ██% of my crop contains ██% of my earnings, the top ██% of the people that buy from me make up ██% of all purchases, hell, even ██% of the plants themselves hold ██% of the total number of vegetables on the vines. How does that make sense? 
> 
> **Dr. Alexander:** It is unusual, isn't it? Your testimony will help us better understand the phenomenon.
> 
> **Rosenthal:** You guys are scientists?
> 
> **Dr. Alexander:** More or less.
> 
> **Rosenthal:** So what do you guys think it is?
> 
> **Dr. Alexander:** That information is classified, although I can say that we are hoping it is explainable with our current understanding of statistical analysis. It is possible that it is simply a coincidence.
> 
>  **Rosenthal:** [laughs] Coincidence? I've never seen something so far away from coincidence in my whole life, doc. I see it everywhere now. ██% of Americans hold ██% of all wealth. Did you know that? No, this ain't coincidence. Whatever it is, it's everywhere, out there in the aether. Something like gravity, you know? Ever present.
> 
> **Dr. Alexander:** Noted. I think that just about covers it. Thank you for report.
> 
> **Rosenthal:** No problem. Oh, and, doc?
> 
> **Dr. Alexander:** Yes?
> 
> **Rosenthal:** Be safe. It's a strange world out there.

> People like to give our universe a bad rap, but in all reality things are pretty okay. From a purely biological standpoint, we humans are thriving. Sure, we may have two hundred ticking time bombs locked in boxes across the biosphere, but we are //alive//. The chances of human life making it this far without being annihilated is, well, let's just say we are lucky on a base scale. 
> 
> Where am I going with this? Well, the presence of SCP-1822 has never been a bad thing. It has always pointed out in favor of the individual. Who would have thought that you can achieve ██% more if you give a ██% effort? That good things happen to you ██% of the time?
> 
> Maybe this thing //is// like the gravitational constant. If so, maybe we should take a closer look at elementary particles- more specifically of any instances of SCP-1822 at the most fundamental scale, see if it possible to manipulate or detect, then move outward from there.

>  Latest results of testing confirms a likelihood of SCP-1822 in the behavior of certain particles. Specifically, strange D mesons (D,,s,,) retain consistent mass ██% of the time. Their contained charm quarks act similarly, with ██% displacement due to quantum effects ██% of the elapsed time.

>  I won't bore you with the jargon, but I'll tell you this: it's big news. Take the data I'm sending you and get it to the Physics department, have them analyze it. Maybe you can get permission to use [[[SCP-536 | SCP-536]]] for testing. Either way, portable analysis of mesons is perfectly possible with the Foundation's current levels of technology.

**Addendum 1822.2:** Project Kismet Overview
[[collapsible show="+ ACCESS 1822-215/EX-20-3" hide="cd.."]]

On ██/██/████, the first functioning Kant-Sennheiser Kismet Ratio Counter was completed. Testing with Hume variations reveal little to no change from baseline, suggesting ratio is intrinsic to the universe and --not modifiable to any degree of certainty-- (See Incident Log 1822.1).

While studying SCP-2700, Dr. Alexander reportedly brought the device into [[[SCP-2400 | SCP-2400]]]. When checking diagnostics, it was revealed that SCP-1822 had a value of 50.0:50.0 within the confines of the alternate dimension. Upon acquisition of this knowledge, Dr. Alexander applied for Council approval to personally explore and record the SCP-1822 value of other anomalous locations. The request was denied, however, the O5 Council approved construction and field use of further Kant-Sennheiser Counters. Project Kismet was established on ██/██ under direct supervision of the Council, in an attempt to catalogue the SCP-1822 value of alternate realities.

**Incident Log 1822.1:** On ██/██/████, during routine control testing using [[[SCP-536]]], Jr. Researcher Edward Wilson reportedly accidentally dropped the device, fracturing the casing isolating the unbounded vacuum inside. The effect was not noticed right away, and the object was placed inside SCP-536 for testing. Over the next week, there were thirty-five reports of personnel involved in workplace accidents, seven containment breaches and an unknown number of equipment failures and data corruptions. Upon checking the device, SCP-1822's value had revealed itself to now be ██.█:██.█. Further attempts to modify this value have failed, and all testing involving SCP-1822 is currently suspended by the O5 Council.
