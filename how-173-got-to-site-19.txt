> **Item #:** SCP-173
> 
> **Object Class:** Euclid
> 
> **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-173 is to be kept in a modified containment chamber at Site-91, equipped with a sprinkler system. The sprinkler system is to be activated fortnightly to dispose of waste materials formed in the chamber. If personnel are required to enter SCP-173's chamber, at least 3 personnel are to be present. At least 1 of those individuals must maintain direct visual contact with SCP-173 at all times while inside the chamber. 
> 
> **Description:** SCP-173 is a statue constructed of concrete and reinforcing steel with traces of spray paint. It is animate, although it may only move when no individual observes it visually. When animate, SCP-173 tends to attack surrounding individuals in the vicinity. Common methods of attack include strangulation or snapping one's neck. 
> 
> About once per day, waste materials are spontaneously generated around SCP-173's vicinity. Chemical analysis of waste materials indicates that they are formed from a combination of faeces and blood. The mechanism in which SCP-173 generates waste materials is unknown. 
> 
> SCP-173 was brought into Site-91 on ██/██/2008 CE by Foundation agents. Information of SCP-173 prior to containment by the Foundation is unknown. 

> **Addendum 173-746:** On 04/10/2045 CE, SCP-173 and other SCP objects were transferred from Site-91 to [REDACTED]. See Document 91/04-10-2045 for more information.

**Addendum 2317-58:** On 15/12/2045 CE (U 5643-Γ-Orange-D), SCP-2317 has successfully breached containment at Area-179. The following transmission was intercepted prior to destruction of Area-179. 
 
> {{WARNING! Containment breach at A-179. SCP-2317-K escaping SCP-2317-Prime. Breach is imminent. SCP-2317 lockdown initiated. Response team prepare to engage SCP-2317-K. Area-wide lockdown initiated. Prepare detonation of onsite nuclear arsenal. SCP-2317-K is not to escape. Impending XK-class end-of-the-world scenario should SCP-2317-K escape from A-179.}}

Observation of SCP-2317's activities and its effects on U 5643-Γ-Orange-D shall commence. All remaining Foundation assets in U 5643-Γ-Orange-D have been ordered to focus on collecting the aforementioned data. No engagement with SCP-2317 is required. 

------

Yes sir, all targeted SCP objects formerly housed in Universe 5643-Gamma-Orange-Delta have been recovered prior to SCP-2317's emergence. The remaining objects are either not in the Foundation's possession or deemed impractical or unsavoury for transportation. – Sr. Agent S. Kisch

Thank you for your report. We'd expect you to clean up these SCPs' documentation prior to their redistribution. – O5-10

Of course sir. The usual protocols. – Sr. Agent S. Kisch

**__An email from Dr. Jack Bright, dated ██/██/1993 AD__**

> FROM: Dr. Jack Bright, Director, Site-19
> TO: Dr. William Moto, Euclid Specialist, Site-19
> RE: New SCP in Site-19
> 
> Moto, we got a new skip in 19 today. It's housed in Euclid Wing, Cell 2. It's supposedly hostile, so bring at least 2 D-class and a research assistant with you. 
> 
> Also, update on any findings you have on the skip. Its profile is barren right now. Your clearance level for that skip is Level 4/173, for your information. 
> 
> Jack Bright
> Director, Site-19

------

Hours later, Dr. William Moto had concluded his first day with the new SCP object. Accessing his account on the Foundation database to catalogue his findings for the day, Dr. Moto browsed over whatever that was present in the document. 

> **Item #:** SCP-173
> 
> **Object Class:** [PENDING]
> 
> **Special Containment Procedures:** [DATA EXPUNGED] 
> 
> **Description:** [DATA EXPUNGED] 

//"No no, this won't do."// he thought while shaking his head, //"I don't even know where it came from or who brought it in..."//

Dr. Moto began deleting the expungements and typed in whatever is known of the newly-found anomalous object.

> **Description:** Moved to Site-19 1993. Origin is as of yet unknown.
