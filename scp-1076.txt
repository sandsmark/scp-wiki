**Item #:** SCP-1076

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Each specimen of SCP-1076 is to be held in a 1.5m x 2m x 2.5m unfurnished cell with a windowless door. --Food should be provided three (3) times daily.--[[footnote]]Previous procedure called for providing food to specimens, but it has since been determined that SCP-1076 can consume any amount of food without showing signs of satiation and can survive indefinitely without any food intake whatsoever.
[[/footnote]] Bedding and plumbing facilities are not required. Soundproofing is not strictly required but should be provided if possible, to reduce psychological stress on guards. One (1) armed guard is to be assigned to each cell, chosen from personnel with no children under the age of 21. 

Access to specimens of SCP-1076 for experimentation requires level 3 clearance and written approval following a thorough psychiatric profile. In no circumstance will access be granted to researchers with children under the age of 21.

Due to their territorial behavior, specimens must be kept separate from each other at all times. To guarantee this, it is recommended that no two specimens be held in the same building.

**Description:** SCP-1076 appears to be a child between the ages of 3 and 5 with an unwashed appearance and long matted hair, barefoot and dressed in ragged clothing. Cursory physical examination reveals signs of moderate to severe malnutrition and bruising and scarring consistent with physical abuse. Specimens of both sexes have been encountered, and normally appear to be of the majority ethnicity of their place of discovery.

Specimens seem to comprehend simple statements but have not displayed any signs of verbal ability. Vocalizations are limited to simple grunts, sighs, and (when disturbed) loud shrieking and sobbing. Specimens are reluctant to meet the gaze of any individual and tend to look downward in the absence of outside stimulus. They will respond to simple questions by nodding in the affirmative or negative.

Initial encounters with SCP-1076 occur when a parent[[footnote]]For the purposes of this document, a "parent" refers to a person with one or more living children below the age of 21.[[/footnote]] discovers the "child" in a state of apparent distress. There are no recorded encounters with any witnesses other than the individual who discovered the specimen. Subjects report an "overwhelming feeling of pity" for the specimen and, in every recorded case, take it into their home.

Once established in a home, SCP-1076 begins to monopolize the attention of the parents to the exclusion of their own children. Children in the home begin to show signs of neglect and malnutrition and become depressed, sullen, and withdrawn. Behavioral problems such as truancy and running away become frequent, which may attract the attention of school authorities or social welfare agents. Upon investigating, these authorities become obsessed with the welfare of SCP-1076 and subsequently ignore the children.

An infestation typically ends with the deaths of the parents and other caretakers as they neglect their own well-being in order to attend to SCP-1076, eventually succumbing to starvation or disease. In the few cases where the Foundation was able to contain an infestation before this occurrence, subjects separated from the specimen became violent or nearly catatonic, and repeatedly demanded to be reunited with their "baby".

If two specimens of SCP-1076 meet, they will attack each other with great force, using teeth and fingernails, until one or both are dead. Any personnel witnessing such an attack should be treated for possible psychological trauma.

**Request 1076-1:** Dr. ███████ has requested access to an SCP-1076 specimen for vivisection. Request denied at this time, pending completion of less invasive physiological analysis.


[[collapsible show="Incident Report 1076-H" hide="- Incident Report 1076-H" hideLocation="both"]]
**Date**: ██-██-199█
**Location**: ██████, WA, a suburb of ███████
**Description**:

Agents were dispatched to the home of Mr. ███████ ██████, an associate professor of ███████ at the local university, following a number of reports of possible abuse which were ignored by local police. Mr. ██████ had not been seen on campus in over two weeks, but as this was during a semester break this was not considered unusual by his colleagues. Neighbors interviewed in the wake of the incident recalled hearing strange noises coming from the house but seemed disoriented, and none could recall filing the police reports bearing their names.

The interior of the home was found in a state of advanced disrepair, despite agents' estimate that the infestation was less than 90 days old. Wallpaper and paint were covered with deep scratches and oily black handprints. All plumbing fixtures were filled with black water. The entire first floor of the home was strewn with soiled and torn clothing. The kitchen and pantry areas were devoid of food, though the pantry was overflowing with empty boxes of prepared goods. The lawn in the backyard was heavily overgrown, except for one corner nearest the house, where agents discovered the remains of a severely emaciated infant in a makeshift grave.

The ██████'s two young sons, ages 4 and 7, respectively, were nowhere to be found on the premises and are presumed to have fled. Agents discovered the body of Mr.██████ in the master bedroom on the second floor in a state of early decomposition. A subsequent autopsy indicated dehydration compounded by malnutrition as the cause of death.

Mrs. ██████ was discovered in an infant's nursery on the second floor, delirious with exhaustion and dehydration and nearly dead. The specimen (now in Foundation containment as SCP-1076-H) was found standing over her prone form and weeping as if disconsolate. SCP-1076-H offered little resistance to agents as they apprehended it but began screaming loudly and constantly as soon as it was taken out of line of sight with Mrs. ██████. 

Mrs. ██████ was taken into Foundation custody for medical treatment and subsequent debriefing; see Interview Log 1076-H-01 for highlights from said debriefing.
