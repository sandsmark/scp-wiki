[[/div]]

**Item #:** SCP-1262

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1262 is to be kept in an indefinite dormant state at Storage Area 33 inside a cube of dry ice measuring 3m x 3m x 3m at 205 degrees Kelvin (-68 degrees Celsius).  The cube is to be suspended inside Silo-4 and be filled with argon gas.  Two industrial strength dehumidifiers will run continuously to sustain a completely dry environment within Silo-4.  Neutron emitters will also bathe the inside of Silo-4 in radiation at all times to deter and eliminate unwanted organics.  

In the event of a catastrophic failure of the primary containment system or a breach in the cube itself, 6 pneumatic drills will extend from the walls and penetrate each face of the cube to deliver a powerful synthetic auxin directly into SCP-1262.  If this secondary system fails, 50% of Silo-4 will be filled with boiling bipyridinium dichloride and SCP-1262 will be released into the liquid.  If this tertiary system fails, a series of controlled incendiary explosions using a combination of thermite, napalm, white phosphorus, and TNT will be used to suppress SCP-1262.  In any case, Mobile Task Force Theta-4 (aka "Gardeners") will respond and remain onsite to provide additional security during the reestablishing/rebuilding of the containment system/s.  

At no times should water/humidity, organics, or visible light (with a frequency between 400-790 THz) be introduced into Silo-4.  Outside of containment, SCP-1262 is extremely lethal within direct contact to any organism and should only be handled after being fully suppressed back into a dormant state.

**Description:** SCP-1262 is a mass roughly 0.30 meters in diameter that is made up of a green plant-like matter capable of highly accelerated growth when left in the presence of light, moisture, or any natural material.  Its surface area is comprised of a dense covering of thin roots.  These roots can spread outwards at a rate of 0.22 meters per second and can reach up to a kilometer in length in order to seek water and mineral nourishment from the surrounding environment or from other living organisms.  

SCP-1262 has a rapid healing ability which makes it difficult to eradicate.  SCP-1262 also has an innate resistance to most types of radiation, extreme temperatures, and extreme pressures.  However, extreme temperature (>1,470 degrees Kelvin or <213 degrees Kelvin) seems to be the most effective suppression method.  Currently there is no known method to fully exterminate SCP-1262.  SCP-1262 grows by a form of rapid exponential mitosis.  If left unchecked, SCP-1262 will grow to form complex structures.  These structures are supported by hardened cellulose plating formed in a hexagonal pattern.  These structures also include defensive/offensive biological mechanisms that range anywhere from pneumatically discharged calcium carbonate flechettes to hallucinogenic fume releasing pods.  

Inside these structures, SCP-1262 is able to produce many independently functioning organic systems for capturing and converting the ambient environment for terraforming on a planetary scale.  Please review the incident summary for further information on SCP-1262 terraforming activity and threat level.  

[[footnote]] All information on SCP-1262 is based on observations in the field --and the surviving witnesses' accounts-- during the Iceland Incident.  --Future research is planned when safer containment procedures can be developed.--

**Timeline Summary of the 2010 Iceland Incident Involving SCP-1262:**

> 04/12/2010
> * Dr. ███████ (a prominent volcanologist) and his assistant were collecting samples on the Eyjafjallajökull ice cap in Iceland when they inadvertently unearthed SCP-1262 from the dense ice.  Dr. ███████ asked his assistant to retrieve it.  As the assistant came into physical contact with SCP-1262, he was quickly engulfed and absorbed by aggressive overgrowth resulting in death within seconds.  Dr. ███████ escaped back to his vehicle and reported to the local authorities.  Local law enforcement arrived hours later to find a thick tree like structure growing atop the human corpse.  Three of the officers were killed by roots underneath them and another was killed by a toxic aerosol.  The only surviving individual did not report the incident, but fled the country instead where he was later detained overseas.   SCP-1262 grew substantially and virtually unnoticed for the next 12 hours.
>
> 04/13/2010
> * By 4:00am, SCP-1262 had grown into a cellulose based structure covering almost 20,000 square meters with three prominent towers each roughly 100 meters tall.  At the base, a collection of gaseous bladders each inflating and deflating independently were scattered around the center mass; along with thick roots that penetrated deep into the ice.  The structure was processing ambient air and other nutrients into carbon monoxide, which was being exhaled out of the structure’s towers as thick clouds.  Two nearby towns evacuated after fifty people died from inhalation. 
> * By 12:30pm, two more towers had germinated and the entire structure had increased in size by 160%.  SCP Foundation was then notified and a perimeter/media blackout was established to protect civilians.  Mobile Task Force Omega-15 (aka "Valkyries") was called in with Level █ clearance to lay down suppressing fire around SCP-1262 using air to ground bunker busters with █████████ warheads. 
> 
> 04/14/2010
> * First volley of the air strike began at 1:00am and was successful in penetrating the ice cap over the dormant volcano.  SCP-1262 became trapped in the collapsing caldera for a short while.  During that time, three aircraft were destroyed by SCP-1262.  A second volley was aimed directly at the center mass of the structure.  The subsequent explosions were able to destabilize the volcano underneath to the point of triggering a violent eruption as planned.  A final airstrike of bombing raids was made in the surrounding areas of the Eyjafjallajökull ice cap, effectively decimating the towns of ██████████ and █████████ along with ██████████████ of witnesses █████████████ campsite.
> * The entire structure of SCP-1262 was closely monitored to ensure that it had been successfully incinerated in the eruption.  All public knowledge of the incident was expunged and the airspace of 20 nearby countries were subsequently closed off until further notice until atmospheric ash samples confirmed a complete neutralization.
>
> ██/██/20██ 
> * Flight ████ crashed into an isolated area of Greenland while traveling from Reykjavík, Iceland.  Intercepted transmissions before the crash gave a strong indication that SCP-1262 was involved.  Upon further investigation of the wreckage, the tail section which had broken off in mid air was found covered in SCP-1262’s overgrowth.  Still in early stages of development, SCP-1262 was quickly suppressed and had the surrounding layers of growth stripped off.  SCP-1262 was then taken directly to Area-33 for indefinite storage --until such time a method of termination can be found.--

**Addendum 1.01:** Expert Opinion and Recommendation

>RESPONSE TO QUERY:
> //After reviewing the provided material, I have theorized that SCP-1262 is a space faring spore (though it is also possible to be some sort of plant based macro-virus) which seems to be designed/programmed to exterminate all resistance and terraform the planetary conditions for colonization of a yet unknown alien species.  SCP-1262 exhibits no real intelligence of its own, other than the offensive and defensive reactions exhibited when encountering other organisms.  SCP-1262’s operates only to survive, consume, and propagate under certain environmental conditions.  If these conditions are not met upon arrival to a planet, SCP-1262 would remain in a dormant state until such conditions arise.//
