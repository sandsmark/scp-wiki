title:The Old Wiki
Our old home, the orignial SCP Wiki at editthis.info, has been deleted.  At first I thought someone had hacked the site, gotten the Admin password, and deleted it as a form of vandalism.  However, it seems numerous wiki's at edtithis.info are are being deleted all together and their Admins are not happy about that.  You can see the original site here:

We dodged a bullet coming here when we did.  Not only has the site evolved by leaps and bounds, but I have to thank the community for the massive amount of work that's gone into molding the Foundation into what it is today.  A lot of progress has been made in just 6 weeks.  Imagine where we'll be in 6 months.

A little bit of statistics for everyone.  In just the last month, the site has been visited by over 8,000 unique visitors.  And those people have viewed more than a quarter of a million pages here.
