You will notice little '📈' emojis beside some articles. That denotes SCP articles which were under 30 and tales which were under 20 when this edition of site news was posted. Give them a little love! Speaking from personal experience, the most frustrating thing that can happen to an article is not deletion, but stagnating below 20 without any comments. So try to read, vote, and comment on these articles! They're often hidden gems :)

+++ Meet Lily!

Lily is [[*user plaidypus]]'s dog, and she is a very good girl. Why don't you tell us about her, plaid?

> Lily likes to stretch out on comfortable things, like blankets and pillows or my spot of the couch so I have to give her attention. However, when she feels like playing, she loves playing this tag-like game where I chase her in circles around the living room or in the yard. She doesn't usually take to dog toys, but loves to gnaw on rawhides and bully sticks.

+* Q&A:

++* Q: Can I replace a blurb that you wrote for one of my articles with my own? I'm not satisfied with it.

A: Absolutely. You will always have that option at any point.

++* Q: I noticed an error/typo/incorrect information and wish to correct it. May I?

A: Sure! If the changes are not limited to your own article(s) and/or are substantial changes across multiple entries, you should post in that month's discussion page and then make the changes.

++* Q: I wrote an article and it seems to have stuck. Can I send a blurb of mine to one of the frequent collaborators?

A: Yup! It's much easier if you come to us about it, and it gives you the control over what you want shown on the news page.
