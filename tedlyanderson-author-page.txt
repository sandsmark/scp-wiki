**Duties:** Exploration and description of hyper-real dimensions

**Location:** Site -1

**History:** Anderson was a promising researcher into textual SCPs when a completely unexpected and irreproducible interaction between SCPs-████ and -████ sent him hurtling into a meta-dimension in which the SCP Foundation is nothing but the crazed scribblings of various internet personalities on an easily-edited website. Though Anderson has been able to make contact with the "real" Foundation, at present he is posted in this meta-dimension to research its peculiarities—in particular its seeming total lack of anomalous objects.

Listed in the order in which they were created.

> **SCP-1633:** My first SCP, and still my most popular, probably due to the simplicity of the idea. I'll be honest: "video game that plays you" isn't the most original concept out there, and I didn't try to do anything particularly new with it. I'm still not happy with the suicide note, but I think it needs to be there, to explain the role that Kr'th'nar plays in the game. On the other hand, I'm pretty proud of the recovery log.

> Incidentally, I would love to have a "screenshot" from the game for the article. If there are any talented Photoshoppers out there who want to help, drop me a line! I imagine it would look like //Marvel: Ultimate Alliance// played in the //Thief// universe.

> **SCP-1304:** Definitely the SCP I'm most proud of, mostly because I'm a big fan of metafiction and stories that explore the difference (or lack thereof) between fiction and reality. Earlier drafts had a longer list of the necessary elements of the ritual, but I figured it was superfluous. I had to be careful to make sure the Foundation couldn't take advantage of the ritual themselves, to make sure (as one commenter suggested) that they couldn't simply have someone write a story about The Super-Cool Guy Who Killed 682.

> And yeah, it's a corny effect, but it's the first time I've done anything like that in a story. And if you don't know what I'm talking about, poke through the comments for a while.

> **SCP-1788:** My greatest failure. Will elaborate later.

> **SCP-1258:** My most divisive article yet, and (not coincidentally) one of my favorites. I know it comes awfully close to furry territory, but that's honestly not where I was going with it. A lot of people tried to guess the inspiration for this, but it's not //Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles// or //Kung Fu Panda// or anything like that.
