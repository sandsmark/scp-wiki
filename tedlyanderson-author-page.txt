**History:** Anderson was a promising researcher into textual SCPs when a completely unexpected and irreproducible interaction between SCPs-████ and -████ sent him hurtling into a meta-dimension in which the SCP Foundation is nothing but the crazed scribblings of various internet personalities on an easily-edited website. Though Anderson has been able to make contact with the "real" Foundation, at present he is posted in this meta-dimension to research its peculiarities—in particular its seeming total lack of anomalous objects.
