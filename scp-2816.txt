**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** A no-fly zone has been established over the island on which SCP-XXXX drops supplies and a cover story has been published about the creation of a minor military base. Additionally, a Foundation outpost has been established on the island with the dual purpose of monitoring SCP-XXXX and the native population and suppressing any non-Foundation traffic to the island. Concealment of this outpost from the native inhabitants to prevent contamination of the experimental group is a priority. This outpost is to be staffed with a squad of armed personnel; a bi-annual review is to be conducted to assess whether additional personnel should be assigned. Following Incident XXXX-01, the outpost is also to be staffed with an around-the-clock bomb disposal team. In the event that an unexpected supply crate is delivered to the outpost, all personnel are to take shelter in the outpost's bunker until the on-site bomb disposal team has sounded the all clear.

**Description:** SCP-XXXX is a Curtiss C-46 Commando transport aircraft bearing American military markings and matching specifications of World War II versions of the aircraft. No unique identification markings are visible on the hull and all windows are abnormally foggy, preventing visual observation of the interior. The occupants do not respond to hailing attempts made using any American Air Force codes in use since the development of the C-46. All attempts to physically interact with SCP-XXXX cause the left engine to suffer an unknown failure and explode, resulting in the temporary destruction of SCP-XXXX.

SCP-XXXX appears once every 7 days, approximately 20 kilometers from the shore of [REDACTED] island in the Pacific Ocean, at an altitude between 6 and 12 kilometers. SCP-XXXX will fly over the island and drop anywhere from 14 to 26 crates of non-anomalous supplies such as medicine and food, using parachutes to slow their descent. Regardless of its altitude, SCP-XXXX will drop the crates within 5 meters of the same spot each time. SCP-XXXX will continue in a straight line before vanishing 20 kilometers from the island's shore. Bad weather has a minimal effect on SCP-XXXX, although several cases of SCP-XXXX being struck by lightning and exploding have been recorded. Destruction of SCP-XXXX is only temporary, and it will reappear to make the next scheduled supply drop.

The island on which SCP-XXXX drops supplies has a small indigenous population, who have formed a cargo cult around SCP-XXXX and worship it as a god. Supply drops will occasionally reinforce this belief by containing some type of media which the natives will interpret as instructions to follow. These have included the construction of basic airstrips[[footnote]]The airstrips constructed are significantly shorter than the minimum length that would be required for SCP-XXXX to successfully land.[[/footnote]], the designing of primitive gliders bearing exaggerated resemblances to SCP-XXXX's markings, the creation of idols of SCP-XXXX made from various natural materials and the remains of supply drops, and the designing of crude binoculars and telescopes which the natives have used to better observe SCP-XXXX.

After Incident XXXX-01, the natives began to interpret SCP-XXXX's "instructions" as being for more extreme and harmful rituals, beginning with a yearly sacrifice in which the natives selected one of their sick or elderly to throw off a cliff. A later supply drop contained a detailed diagram of prosthetic wings attached directly to the shoulder blades of a human, which resulted in the natives mutilating the backs of the sacrifices and attempting to attach wooden planks or palm leaves directly to the bones. To date, the most recent "instruction" has been a set of pictures detailing the proper loading of cargo bays, leading the natives to force their sacrifices to consume various supply items[[footnote]]Ingested supply items have included many never intended for consumption, such as medical tools or weapon magazines.[[/footnote]] before leaping from the cliff.

On March 8, 1998, a team of Foundation personnel approached the island community with intent to peacefully retrieve a number of SCP-XXXX's airdropped items for analysis. The team consisted of 1 anthropologist and 3 armed security personnel carrying bladed weapons in addition to firearms. Despite concerns, the team was able to retrieve several items without incident, with extra items being offered by the natives, presumably as encouragement and welcoming of what they assumed were fellow worshipers. Analysis of the items did not reveal any anomalous effects, and the team returned several times to perform further item analysis and to examine the effects of SCP-XXXX on the natives.

On April 23 of the same year, SCP-XXXX dropped only two supply crates, one in the village and one near the Foundation outpost on the island. The crate in the village consisted of a large number of live hand grenades, which exploded shortly after the crate was opened, injuring 34 natives and killing 8. The crate near the Foundation outpost contained a single live M47A2 chemical bomb armed with a payload of mustard gas which also detonated when the crate was opened, resulting the severe injury of 2 researchers. Following the incident, the  natives became increasingly xenophobic and a request to return to the village to offer aid was denied. The existing outpost was taken down and a more covert one was established elsewhere on the island to allow for continued observation of SCP-XXXX.
