**Item #:** SCP-840

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to SCP-840’s presence in ecosystems across the globe, SCP-840 cannot be fully contained. Outbreaks and potential outbreaks of SCP-840 are to be reported to either Dr. ████ or biological research overseers for immediate containment. 

Three samples of SCP-840 are kept in Bio-Research Area-12 for study. Samples are to be habituated within segments of PCB piping, 30mm (1.2 inches) in diameter and 300mm (11.81 inches) in length, and provided with a constant flow of water containing biological material to ‘digest’ three times a week. Samples must not be allowed to grow beyond the length of the pipe, and screening of bio-site drainage systems for containment breaches is to be conducted every six months.


**Description:** SCP-840 is a small species of worm, believed to be a relative of the blackworm (//lumbriculus variegatus//), that thrives in dark, damp environments. Given the correct circumstances, SCP-840 will form large colonies consisting of many thousands or millions of individuals. In groups of sufficient size, SCP-840 forms a unique symbiotic relationship, ‘fusing’ together by secreting an extremely viscous mucous. These fused colonies are capable of replicating many of the functions of organic tissues, particularly that of vital organs. Although SCP-840 has a prolific growth and reproduction rate, colonies are capable of existing unnoticed for years.

Pipes and drainage systems are the preferred habitat of SCP-840. To date, there has only been one observed instance of SCP-840 colonising a natural environment (see incident report I-840A-1). Using the exterior of the pipe as an exoskeleton SCP-840 will, over time, convert these in to an extended digestive system, capable of extracting nutrients and moisture from passing biological matter. Material is transported by means of a constant or frequent flow of water aided by peristalsis. In larger drainage spaces, such as places where piping has burst (either incidentally or as a result of a build-up of SCP-840), colonies are capable of organising in to more complex structures, resembling ‘organs’, ‘chambers’ and ‘sphincters’.

Sphincters serve to restrict the flow of fluids and solids, often causing a build-up matter so to increase the surface contact with SCP-840. Chambers typically grow in larger cavities, and aid in the digestion process by secreting a highly acidic mucous, or by serving as a storage area for resistant or indigestible materials. Indigestible material will often remain in these chambers indefinitely, until it is either pushed further along the ‘tract’, or forced through the walls of the chamber itself. The largest chamber on record had redirected a major sewer system in █████████████, United States, [REDACTED]. In an examination of the contents of one small chamber, the following was found: 2 rings, $28.20 in coins, several goldfish skeletons (number inconclusive), 1 pair of glasses, 19 condoms, 1 key, 3 dolls, one turtle shell, and 0.76kg of human hair.

In rare cases, SCP-840 has been observed to organise in to other ‘tissues’ and even more complex structures. Some of these have been known to displace dirt, stone, concrete and even metal by a combination of acids and physical pressure. Excavated material is digested and transported away through the tract, enabling SCP-840 to extend beyond its ‘exoskeleton’ and establish new tracts. There have been rare instances of these branches reconnecting with other parts of the same tract, creating a circuitous system. Other structures have been known to form complex pump and valve systems, circulating digestible material through rhythmic contractions similar to a heart.

Any material that is ultimately not digested is forced out of the system wherever the tract ends, or through the tract walls. In many cases, the natural flow of water directs this material in to normal sewage systems, however, in more established colonies (particularly those containing pump and valve systems), the flow has been known to redirect to other outlets, including natural bodies of water, storm drains and fresh water piping.

The first recorded SCP-840 was discovered on ██/██/████, in ██████████████████, ████████, United States, when a resident reported feeling a soft, pulsating growth while attempting to recover a lost ring from the bathroom sink by hand. After several meters of piping were removed a local plumber, tearing part of the ‘tract’ in the process, it was established that the colony was present in almost every drainage and pipe system in the house. The Foundation was alerted to the outbreak of a potential SCP after the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) was called to investigate the growth after it was discovered the growth covered [REDACTED]. A media blackout was enacted shortly after.


||**Incident Log I-840**||

> **Incident report I-840A-1:**
> **Date:** ██/██/████
> The first known instance of SCP-840 colonising a natural environment was observed in ██████████, Australia. The colony was discovered by a group of four cavers, investigating an unexplored section of █████████ Caves in ████████. In an interview the cavers stated that the colony was discovered as one member of the group attempted to crawl through a narrow passageway, approximately 150 meters (500ft) from the cave entrance, while the rest of the group stayed behind, attaching a lifeline as a precaution. After having crawled for roughly 3 meters (10ft), the caver reported feeling a sticky growth on the cave walls, but dismissed it as moss and continued forward. The group became concerned when the caver reported feeling rhythmic contractions following along the cave walls, and alarmed when they claimed to be being ‘pulled’ by the contractions shortly after. The caver was forcefully extracted via the lifeline, distressed but not physically injured. Several bones were pulled out along with him, believed to have originated from a nearby fruit bat colony.

//Addendum//: Due to the extent of the colony reported in incident I-840A-1, the area has been declared a civilian restriction zone until the colony has been completely eradicated, designated Bio-Site ███.
