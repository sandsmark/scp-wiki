“Wait, you’re not Troy.”

Nope, but I’m doing my best!

“But- okay. THIS IS AWESOME! How do I add my own?”

Well, like this, Mystery Editor.

Toss in a collapsible. Give us the name of your creepy pasta and your name as the "show", and put in a special birthday message as the "hide."  Make sure you put in a line break.

Have fun, guys! And enjoy Gears Day!

> Do you crave them still? Stories, all those stories. There are always more stories out there. How about the one about the child with the little friend, the friend who stayed behind when the child went away? Or what about the one of the cat, the wrong cat? And there’s so many more out there. The spider who wove a lie, the window inside of a house, the music above the lake…

[[collapsible show="I Always Follow by Dexanote" hide="Happy Birthday to the grandest of admins. I hope this next year is wonderful."]]


I follow her from afar, her beauty staining through the months like ink through a paper. It’s as if the world kneels to her; when she’s there everything is brighter and more full of life. As if all nature wells up to celebrate and sing to her. She’s somebody who gives all of herself and has more to spare. A sublime artist.

It begins with cold, ugly white, a pale nothing, an easel she could work with. She prepares, first a sketch of black and grey, charcoal thin lines grasping every which way. Starkness, to begin. Something she could adorn and cover with her true vision.

And in time her vision came to bloom. Shade and colour, a million lines spread wide like arms. I grew closer, and it was like her very life became a sweeping, boundless work of art. Stark paleness grew into a gorgeous rainbow, her confidence and artistry boundless. 

Every year is different, but it was in April that she first found passion. Everything seemed so much more… full of colour then. More alive. Her most tender caress, coaxing the most delicate of her favourites to stand so tall… How lucky are they to know her touch. 

Do you hear it? In the night, the softness of her breath, carried on the wind... I envy the wind, I admit. To be so close to her, and for so long. 

She //is// beautiful. But at the end of it all, what I love the most is her humanity. 

Tenderness aside, she’s anything but delicate. Strength is hers, equal to her tenderness. The days when she dances, it’s as if heaven itself cracks open all across the world. Her footsteps irregular, erratic, resonant, dressed in a long gown of trailing white and grey, soft and powerful.

Even the mightiest things in all creation kneel when she dances, when she twirls without a care for anything but the motion… 

It is not all sunshine and rainbows, of course. As the months creep by, my love finds herself on a downswing.

From a world away I watch as she flows from away spirit and into stagnation, my heart breaking as the stillness sets in. It is agony to watch. Weeks pass, and her inspiration dries up; it’s as if the land itself is sundered, and all her friends bow and weep at her torpor. 

I almost break, almost broke this time. I debated, wanting to reach out and lend her my hand, to pull her up and see her eyes, to sooth her and snatch her away from her misery. But I didn’t, I let her be. I needed to see her like this. Everybody did, everybody did so they could see her highs and her lows. To appreciate her as I do. To miss her later.

She suffers, but soon she changes. Not slowly and not quickly, I watch as her torpor becomes anger. Like a queen she rages. Reckless and frustrated. Time and again she throws herself at her cherished things, her fury sweeping across and swallowing everything she loves. The most neglected are the least lucky, they crumble into nothing as her fury fades. 

Sometimes she tries to salvage her work. She does her best, but now she’s tired. At this point there’s less… brightness. The nights seem a little darker, her hands a little less busy. She still creates, absolutely. But… not as much. 

I can’t wait any longer. So the day comes when I follow her, closer than before. She’s tired, her mind not so sharp. Exhaustion was taking her. Nobody can stay so bright for so long. 

I inhale the warmth of her perfume, fresh and clean on the wind as it’s always been. Gorgeous, a beautiful scent, filling lungs with vitality and hints of chrysanthemum and goldenrod. I’m on the horizon.

I reach and take her, my sunshine, my fingers cold against her sun-kissed cheek. Reunited for that brief moment in our eternal dance.

She shudders, my whisper reaching her ears, creeping across the evening breeze. Her eyes, melancholy. My bite, a chill. Resignation against exhilaration. Her fall.

Cruel reds and yellows bleed across the canvas as she dies another year, soon to fade into the cold nights, destined to return one day to white.

And seasons change again.

[[collapsible show="The Market, by Zyn" hide="Happy birthday!"]]


In the depths of dreamed cathedrals, in the bridge between blindness and sight, there exists a market for final things.
 
Most of the merchants there are collectors, engaging in the trade as a form of petty competition with their peers. No two merchants deal in the same product, but all of them have the otherworldly means to offer currencies that cannot be traced. Some merchants prefer to tempt customers with promises of tasks carried out, such as the quiet sabotage of a business rival or the subtle manipulation of the target of one’s affections. Others prefer to trade with those who are more desperate for the deal, and wish for merely the simplicity of a safe travel home, the reassurance that a loved one will survive a storm, the strength to see the next day to its completion.
 
There is Silence, who wears a mantle of silver-grey silk and collects last words spoken. Silence carries a sack full of enchanted shells the size of human skulls, magicked to trap sound in their curled depths and echo the words endlessly for those who press the ridges close to their ear.
 
There is Spite, who craves the last burn of hatred. Spite dresses exuberantly and flamboyantly, in flaming colors that dazzle the eyes and distract the senses. Spite wears a strange contraption of belts around their spidery form; these belts hold slots of tiny vials, which when pressed to the heart, begin to glow a deep burgundy and fill with a substance likened to both ambrosia and ichor. Those who have been treated by Spite speak of the merchant’s cabinet of distilled liquors, each possessing the same dark red glow when poured into crystal glasses.
 
There is Decay, whose face is never seen, who wears the scraps of linen scarves that have seen ages and ages past, and seeks the last memory of health before one lapses into the weariness of age or sickness. Decay carries a pouch of seeds said to lie dormant until allowed to absorb the health of another being; Decay keeps to themselves so no one knows what these seeds grow into. Some whisper that the plants are beautiful, flowering magnificently into towering blossoms ten times the size of any seen in nature. Others caution that they grow into twisted reflections of true plants, and produce a ripe gnarled fruit that is the sole means of sustenance for Decay’s continued existence.
 
There is Death, who deals in the last spark of life held within a human body. Death is the only reluctant merchant, who is shrewd with their deals and secretive with their ambitions.
 
Those who walk the world are warned against making promises to these merchants. Once a deal is struck, there is no forward notice of when a merchant will arrive to gather their due, and there are some who take pains to ensure that the collection date is as soon as possible…

Dear Citizen,

In the event of this document's dissemination to the general public, it has come to the attention of the Attorney-General that an extreme threat to the safety of Her Majesty's Kingdom has presented itself, one that cannot be countered through standard diplomatic and military means.

While the nature of this threat is strictly classified, we would like to require nonetheless that citizens take the following precautions to defend themselves against it. Compliance with these instructions is not mandatory but failing to comply will result in significant damage, both to you and your neighbours: as such we recommend in the strongest possible language you follow these simple instructions to protect yourself in these trying times.

**Precaution No. 1:** //Stay inside for as long as possible.//

The threat entity will most strongly affect citizens outside their homes and other buildings, causing hallucinations and brain damage with sufficient exposure. Citizens should remain indoors where possible and only take trips outside with personal protective equipment such as gas masks, blindfolds and earplugs.

Between the hours of 5-6 AM, do not answer knocking at the door. Pay attention only to the state broadcasts that will take place during this time.

Where possible, ignore requests for help from outside your home — government officials will be able to assist individuals in need more effectively, without the risk of harm that untrained civilians will incur.

**Precaution No. 2:** //Remain clear of electronic equipment not distributed by trusted sources.//

Government workers will visit your homes to distribute electronic equipment deemed safe for use while the threat is present. Other electronic devices, especially those capable of playing video and audio media, should not be used and preferably destroyed — officials will also provide disposal options for citizens seeking to remove these potential hazards from their homes.

**Precaution No. 3:** //Compromised individuals should be turned over to government officials immediately.// 

Easily-observed signs of the threat having affected a citizen include audio/visual hallucinations, obsession with advertising media, and persistent cough. When in doubt about the status of an individual, turn them over to government officials for diagnosis: should they prove to be non-compromised, they will be returned to their prior location and reimbursed appropriately. Successful identification of a compromised individual will be rewarded with material goods such as food rations and batteries for electronic devices.

More complex ways to verify that a citizen has not been compromised include:

* //Ability to recognise official documentation:// Documents bearing the insignia of the Government of the United Kingdom are apparently imperceptible to impostors or officials compromised by the threat. Ask to see an official's credentials before letting them into your home.
* //Absence of electronic distortion in their presence:// TV and radio signals will be heavily corrupted in the presence of a compromised individual, and these corrupted signals are another vector for the spread of the threat. If you recognise distortion unexplainable by distance, location or other external factors, immediately shut off all electronic devices and submit individuals suspected to be compromised to the government.
* //Unwillingness to comply with these instructions:// For a compromised individual, spread of the threat is a priority higher than ensuring their own survival. Refusal to comply with these quarantine procedures (most commonly by attempting to assist individuals outside, giving infected food to neighbors, distributing untrustworthy media) should be treated as a sign of compromise by the threat.

The Government of the United Kingdom thanks you for your continued compliance in these extremely trying times, and assures you that these procedures will both assure your personal safety and assist in the eventual eradication of this threat from this country.

Regards,

Keller Baden-Smith

Secretary of the Department for Managing Outside-Context Events

The last person on Earth sat in a room. How are you reading this?

I'm the last person on earth, and I couldn't be happier. She turned to me with that gorgeous loving smile that made my heart flutter, I was the luckiest person in the world. I had nothing but the best intentions when I threw myself over that grenade.

"Oh sugar, did you actually think I loved you?"

In hindsight, maybe that was her plan all along. It angers the thing at the end of your bed. You know, I always loved the way her eyes reflected the moonlight. That doesn't really matter anymore, now, does it?

A woman knocked on my door asking for her jewelry back. Now that I live alone, it is much more unsettling. I'm not talking to you. I know your search history.

As the monster's shadow fell upon her, she knew she did not have long to live. If you turn around, you might even see me coming. When it stopped, we couldn't even scream.

March on march on, upon the bright day, march on march on this dark and dreary way. There are millions of stars in the sky, countless worlds in the cosmos. The stars are in the wrong places tonight. Then I realized the sun had gone out.

I've been trying to go to sleep for a while now. This may take some time. A tree falls in the forest, and nobody hears. Have to keep the fire going. Good thing bodies burn. Turning on the lights just makes you easier to find. A tree falls in the forest, and there is nobody left to listen.

There's nothing in the dark that isn't there in the light. That's what I used to say. People hate the truth. Lie oh lie, for you face truth when you die. It didn't take long for me to realize that I didn't want to die after all.

"What am I being charged with, Officer?" You're thinking I can't possibly do this. If I run up the stairs fast enough, it won't get me. He didn't believe I needed to keep existing. They told me I might not survive the operation before putting me to sleep. When I woke up in a coffin, I realised that they had assumed I died.

You believed God didn't exist. People hate the truth. The truth doesn't care. God is real. Do you really think God can hear your prayers above the screaming?

I was the last one to turn off the light. I sat there in the darkness, waiting for the inevitable. There was nothing else to do here.

There weren't any sentences left, after all.

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-1677376 There was a knock at the door.]

[[collapsible show="Shave And A Haircut by Roget" hide="hide this filth"]]

I need to get myself cut. Growing out too long for too many days. It's time to stop putting it off.

I've always hated going to the barbershop. The stale, sickly odor of cleaning products hangs in the air all day. A spinning spire representing blood of this professions past announces the stable to all who might approach it. Knives and blades line the shelves between blue plastic bottles and broken dreams. Sometimes, the walls decorate themselves with past news and trinkets. All just distractions from what these places do.

Some of my earliest memories are of the barbers shop. Not a lot of coherent imagery, but the thrashing and emotion of my resistance rings still through the years. Spaced them out as long as I could, but even now I find myself tripping over the outstretched gangling of what I have grown. It's a mess. A really big mess. Bigger than any I ever made pitching a fit over getting hair cut.

I stand in front of the glass doors. My reflection is dark and blurred. Inside there are men at work, paring off mustaches, beards, parts and follicles. Figures sit silently in each seat until their turn is done. They fall free from their self-grown earthbound nature.

They whip the apron around, and before I can settle down they begin cutting me down to size. For a few moments there's a ripping pain, but then as the cutter gets to his work I find myself and my complaints drowned by the sound of the grinding gears. Hunkering to myself I wait for the storm to pass me by.

Finally, the cutter relents. A loud thump falls to the floor as my dead weight collapses beneath me. Despite it all, I feel liberated. A great weight removed from my form. I can see others fluttering off as the cutters roll their bodies behind to a door and out of sight.

As I slowly descend to the floor, the cutter points to the limp bode lying on the floor. I say nothing as I leave. 

There's a wind carrying me up, light as a feather and free as a bird. A hair cut free and fast.

"You're a real prick you know that?  You don't get a gold star for buying me an empanada.  I just wanted a ride home, away from that asshole." She said, as she walked towards me. I felt a jolt, and looked down to see my liver in her hand, her freshly painted nails standing out against the dark red blood.  The pain came next.  Everything was red fresh agony, as she laid in to my guts with raw strength I couldn't even fathom...

------

I sat down on the E train car, and pulled out my phone.  I'd managed to find the only car that didn't have a homeless guy camped out in it, and opened my E-reader app.  

Someone's getting on, but I'm not gonna turn my head.  Rules of the subway, //never// look at anyone else.  That would acknowledge that they're there, and that's not okay.

Oh god, I can smell it now, there's this...horrifying stench.  Homeless guy is getting on the train.  Fuck me, I mean...shit, I want to fix the homeless problem.  But I still have to get to work, and I don't want to smell like rancid shit. 

I hunker down a bit, as he drags five plastic bins on the train, creating a little hobo apartment.  Fuck man.  I'd get up, but he's in front of the closest door, and his crap is in the way.

I hear him now, "Hey, I don't wanna cause trouble, can anyone spare some change?  Just a quarter or something, just anything?  If not, I understand, God bless..."

He walks past me a couple times, there's three or four other people on the train, I don't carry cash, but even if I do, I tell them I don't.  I want to fix the problem, but come on.  I shouldn't have to deal with this in the morning.

He stops in front of me.  Fuck.  Fuck fuck fuck.  Is this guy gonna do something crazy and attack me.  I feel his eyes on me, the smell is completely overwhelming.  "Hey buddy.  Spare some change?  Anything'll help."

I look up, and his eyes lock on mine, his face covered in dirt and worse.  "I don't carry cash, sorry."

He shuffles a step to the little fortress of dirty blankets and bins he's set up on the bench.  I look down at my phone, reading again.  "Ever get tired of that shit, Chris?"

The sound of my voice causes me to look up.  He's not stooping over anymore, as he stares at me.  "I mean, come on.  'Don't carry cash'?  You just ate a $4.10 protein bar from the World Trade vending machines.  You're just a dick."

I get angry, and put my phone down, "Hey, fuck off buddy.  I'm not the one begging for change.  I'm going to work!"  My words ring out angrily, and I cringe slightly as the sound hits my own ears.  I didn't mean to yell so loud.

"You're a real prick, you know that?  All I wanted was some food."  He walks forward, and shoves his dirty fingers in to my mouth, the taste of the disgusting milleiu invading my senses.  He's choking me, and the pain slowly increases as I feel an intense pressure on my spine.  Why won't anyone help me!  With a loud crack I...

"How many more?" The man in the grey suit says to the younger man beside him.  His companion sits in front of a series of monitors showing the subject's vital signs.

"Six-hundred twelve." The young man replies, looking down at the sobbing, heavy-set man in the chair.  Electrodes stream down to his skull, and a quietly pulsing machine glowing with some internal light hummed in time with the impulses.

"Six-hundred eleven, that one's done.  After this, we can move on to racism, then violence?" The man in the grey suit checks off a box on his clipboard.  "I'll let the Director know."

The heavy-set man's sobs echoed in to the white-painted walls of the halls, as he relived his every slight, every sin and his victims got their state-sanctioned revenge.

Don't worry, there's no one else down here but you and me.

They left you because I snapped your ankle. Don't blame them.

Your other friends out there right now with the police. They'll convince them to come here with guns and tanks and no one will think they're crazy. No one will think they killed you.

Then again maybe no one is coming. They know what this looks like. Maybe they'll just go home. Better to live guilty than judged.

Honestly am I so bad? It's quiet, it's dark, and it's warm down here. Why would you want to go back to the cowards and killers?

Don't worry. You're the first friend I've had in years. We can play together! But first we need to take care of that ankle. 

There. Now they're both broken. Don't scream! This is a happy place! 

I'm sorry! I'll fix your feet!

How did that make it worse? You're not being a very good friend. Don't be like them. Stop crying!

I'm going to cover up your face until you stop making noise. There. Isn't that better? Quiet.

We've got so much more time together.

Staying quiet is so much better isn't it? Friend?

Don't go.
