**Item #:** SCP-133

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Item SCP-133 should be stored within a lead lined box in a sealed, bomb resistant storage room at all times. The walls of this room should be no less than 1.22m (4ft) thick, and should be covered in mirror-polished steel both inside and out. Due to the nature of the item and its contents, absolutely no-one below security clearance level 4 is permitted within the storage room for any reason, and anyone below level 4 clearance attempting to gain access to SCP-133 is to be terminated.

**Description:** SCP-133 appears to be an unmarked shipping crate, unremarkable in every way. Contained within, however, are several hundred (613# by 30.02.2008,14:47) rectangles of a waxy, paperlike material, folded in half. If unfolded, bears a black dot 5 cm in diameter.

If the backing is placed against a solid surface printed side down, and rubbed, the black dot will transfer to that surface, creating a permanent hole. Tests indicate SCP-133 is capable of penetrating 24" of structural grade titanium, but smooth or highly dense materials reduce its ability to penetrate. When applied to flesh, the results are devastating.

**Addendum-133-01:** Request submitted by Dr. █████████ to test the effects of SCP-133 on [[[SCP-682]]], though due to the nature of 133, this request is unlikely to be granted.
