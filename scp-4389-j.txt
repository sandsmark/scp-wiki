**Item #:** SCP-4389-J

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- None

**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-4389-J is to be stored within a hermetically sealed containment chamber within Site-19. Entry and exit from the chamber must be prohibited, as they could lead to a containment breach. Any personnel with a Level-4 or higher security clearance should remain unaware of the existence of SCP-4389-J to prevent its antimemetic effect from manifesting.-- SCP-4389-J does not require containment, as it does not exist.

**Description:** SCP-4389-J is a powerful antimemetic anomaly, which is believed to have the physical form of a piece of medieval artillery. SCP-4389-J presents no signs of sentience; however, its antimemetic properties necessitate a Euclid classification. 

The anomalous effect of SCP-4389-J varies in potency depending on how long a member of personnel has been employed at the Foundation. Junior Researchers and D-Class personnel are unable to observe SCP-4389-J, but accept its existence when made aware of it. However, Site Directors and members of the Overseer Council both cannot perceive SCP-4389-J and refuse to believe that it exists. For this reason, testing of SCP-4389-J should only be carried out by Junior Researchers.

Dr. Rossi,
@@ @@
It has become apparent that you (and several of your colleagues) believe that there is a certain antimemetic entity being contained in Site-19. This is not correct. There is nothing in the containment chamber which is seemingly designed to hold SCP-4389-J. Testing of other members of personnel who support the existence of SCP-4389-J has even revealed that there is no memetic or mind-altering component in this belief; you have come to this incorrect conclusion entirely using your own free will.

There is nothing within that containment chamber, anomalous or not. This does not mean SCP-4389-J has breached containment, as something cannot breach containment if it does not actually exist. I have previously sent this email to several other Junior Researchers who all refuse to admit that SCP-4389-J is not real. They ignored the truth, so I am going to make it //extremely// clear in this message:

There is no cannon.
