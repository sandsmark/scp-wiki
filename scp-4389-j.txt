**Item #:** SCP-4389-J

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- None

**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-4389-J is to be stored within a hermetically sealed containment chamber within Site-19. Entry and exit from the chamber must be prohibited, as they could lead to a containment breach. Any personnel with a Level-4 or higher security clearance should remain unaware of the existence of SCP-4389-J to prevent its antimemetic effect from manifesting.-- SCP-4389-J does not require containment, as it does not exist.

**Description:** SCP-4389-J is a powerful antimemetic anomaly, which is believed to have the physical form of a piece of medieval artillery. SCP-4389-J presents no signs of sentience; however, its antimemetic properties necessitate a Euclid classification. 

The anomalous effect of SCP-4389-J varies in potency depending on how long a member of personnel has been employed at the Foundation. Junior Researchers and D-Class personnel are unable to observe SCP-4389-J, but accept its existence when made aware of it. However, Site Directors and members of the Overseer Council both cannot perceive SCP-4389-J and refuse to believe that it exists. For this reason, testing of SCP-4389-J should only be carried out by Junior Researchers.

Dr. Rossi,
@@ @@
It has become apparent that you (and several of your colleagues) believe that there is a certain antimemetic entity being contained in Site-19. This is not correct. There is nothing in the containment chamber which is seemingly designed to hold SCP-4389-J. Testing of other members of personnel who support the existence of SCP-4389-J has even revealed that there is no memetic or mind-altering component in this belief, you have come to this incorrect conclusion entirely using your own free will.

There is nothing within that containment chamber, anomalous or not. This does not mean SCP-4389-J has breached containment, as something cannot breach containment if it does not actually exist. I have previously sent this email to several other Junior Researchers who all refuse to admit that SCP-4389-J is not real. They ignored the truth, so I am going to make it //extremely// clear in this message:

There is no cannon.
