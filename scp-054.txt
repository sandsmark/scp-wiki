**Item #:** SCP-054 

**Object Class:** Safe 

**Special Containment Procedures:** Subject is held in a watertight isolation room outfitted with specialized climate control equipment. An ornate fountain filled with water stands in the center of the enclosure. Maintenance personnel are required to wear non-absorbent NBC suits while inside the containment area and must spend ten minutes in a special drying room after exiting. In the event of a breach, the surrounding area should be evacuated and the enclosure flushed with liquid nitrogen. 

The fountain's chemical levels and volume are to be monitored and maintained. Spring water from ████████ should be used as SCP-054 is highly sensitive to hydrological conditions. SCP-054 has developed a mistrust for human males during its confinement, thus assignment of female personnel is recommended.

**Description:** Out of the water the subject most often appears as a female humanoid with a mean volume of 90L comprised entirely of water (other forms are possible, commonly geometric shapes). When it enters a body of water it becomes indistinguishable from its surroundings. The subject must periodically return to a body of water in order to maintain its volume due to evaporation. Initially found in ████████, it was moved to site 08 for further study. Subject was initially curious about Foundation personnel and seemed to enjoy interacting with maintenance staff and researchers, and mimicking their forms. After a number of weeks the creature apparently felt comfortable enough to remain out of the water during routine monitoring, though it retreated when attempts were made to study its composition. 

Experiments by Dr. Seskel et all are responsible for all information pertaining to SCP-054. It is apparently composed of normal water, with no detectable differences with queiscient spring water from the same source. No thermal, electromagnetic, biological, or any other kind of phenomenon has ever been detected in its "body" that would indicate how it animates. Water lost by SCP-085 to evaporation exhibits no special properties when condensed.

If SCP-054 is denied access to water to replenish itself, it becomes dormant and assumes a form that minimizes its surface area. Initially in these experiments it would approach research staff in a supplicating manner, as though asking for help. It abandoned these attempts after █████ when it became clear that no assistance was forthcoming. Increasing the temperature to 368 K elicits aggravated behavior and attempts to escape containment. Subject becomes lethargic when exposed to temperatures at and below 273 K, and will eventually freeze. Thawing restores it to apparent health. Samples gathered from the frozen subject exhibit no strange properties when thawed.

SCP-054 is intelligent and exhibits problem-solving and learning capabilities comparable to a domestic canine or octopus. It can alter its form to pass through any aperture through which water could flow, and can navigate mazes and obstacle courses when given proper incentive. Electrical shocks and application of silica dessicants seem to cause it discomfort and are sufficient for motivational purposes. It has a limited capacity for memory which seems to be stunted when its volume is forcefully reduced, suggesting that some information storage and/or processing is dependent on the volume of water SCP-054 currently contains.

Experiments with SCP-054 were halted during trials with acidic and basic compounds incorporated into its body. [DATA EXPUNGED] 2 researchers dead (including Dr. Seskel). After this incident containment protocols were updated. Subject thereafter exhibited signs of mistrust and aggression around male personnel (which made up the majority of the original research staff). Subject reclassified Euclid.

**Addedendum:** After five (5) years with no incidents, subject rating has been downgraded to "Safe" on recommendation of Dr. ████████. Experiments will resume under the auspices of cryptobiology unit E7. Caution should still be exercised when interacting with subject.
