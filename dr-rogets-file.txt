title:Dr. Roget's Personnel File
**Name:** Dr. Nolan J. Roget

**Security Clearance:** Level 3

**Position:** In charge of scheduling.

**Current Location:** Site 11

**History:** Dr.Roget has been working in clerical positions within the Foundation for 17 years now. You think one day he would get a real project. But nooooo, he gets to keep doing clerical work because he's "so darn good at it." He asks for basic, simple promotions, and he gets to make the schedule. Pity poor Nolan Roget. He does all the work around this place, but not one person from Site 11 respects his amazing talent. Those jerks.

> Doctor, this is both very immature and the wrong way to format your personnel file. Please redo it so I can submit it to the network properly.
