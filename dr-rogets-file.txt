[[include component:image-block name=ROGETMAN.jpg|caption={{--Alleged-- photo of Dr. Roget}}|width=400px]]


**Name:** {{Dr. Ralph J. Roget}}

**Security Clearance:** {{Level 3}}

**Position:** --{{In charge of scheduling.}}-- {{[[[History Of The Universe Hub| Historian]]]}}

**Current Location:** {{Site-77}}

**History:** {{Dr. Roget has been working in [[[Roget-s-workbench| clerical]]] positions within the Foundation for 17 years now. You think one day he would get a real project, or something with at least //marginal// importance. But nooooo, he gets to keep doing clerical work because he's "so darn good at it." He asks for basic, simple promotions and they say "Yeah, sure thing." Then they force him to make the schedule. Pity poor Roget. He does all the work around this place, but not one person from Site 77 respects his amazing talent. Those bums.}}

//**//NOTE//**//
//Doctor, this is both very immature and the wrong way to format your personnel file. Please redo it so I can submit it to the network properly.//
//~Rosen//

> //It's **on**//

//**//NOTE//**//
//Your file has been... approved.//
//~Rosen//
,,You didn't have to break the coffee machine. A simple "please" would have sufficed.,,


> NOTE: Dr. Roget's name is not pronounced Rogay, Rogat, Rogain, Reject, Ragazzo, Regret, rigrog or Rights. Please do not use these pronounciations when referring to Dr. Roget
> ^^c'mon guys it isn't that hard^^

Also a mod over at the [[[http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/|Wanderers Library]]] and in charge of [[[http://scp-foundation-origins.wikidot.com/|Origins]]], so you can ask him about those things if you feel the need to.

[[tab Author Living Will]]

* Rewrites: If I'm not around and one of my SCP's hits below +5, it can be rewritten by another member of staff, or someone whom staff deems able to do the rewrite. If possible, I'd like copies of my deleted stuff to be saved, although if I vanish for an extended period of time I won't burden y'all with holding onto my shit.

* Merchandising: As long as I'm attributed, anyone can make anything with my stuff. 

* Reclaiming Authorship: Well, several members of staff know who I am and what I look like, so they'd be able to recognize me. Moose knows what my current email is, Scantron follows me on twitter and on youtube. If all that fails, Reject, Scantron, thedeadlymoose, TroyL, Kens, and Drewbear have my phone number.

* Other: Anyone has my permission to use my stuff however they please. Tales, references in SCP's, using 'em in games, videos, whatever. As long as I'm credited, you can go nuts.

[[tab SCP Commentary]]
__SCP-1507__

This was my first article that succeeded. I'd just had an SCP bomb, and was trying to find something I knew well so that I could write from the heart. I looked up from my then-desk and saw one of my mothers pink flamingos staring at me from outside. I thought "oh, that's make for a cool article" and wrote it. I got the assistance of MisterBibs, who will always have my eternal thanks for assisting me with my first SCP article. If it weren't for his guidance, I wouldn't be where I am today.

__SCP-5200-J__

Basically, I had an idea at school for a "JUST SAY NO" -J. I came home and started working on it, and stopped shortly into the description. I posted in chat saying "how does it look so far?". Salman Corbette happened to be there, and he thought it was hilarious. He then demanded that I post it immediately. So I did. After 10 minutes of work, I had a successful -J.

__SCP-2600-EX__

This one came from dexanote posting the furred trout myth in the batcave, and telling someone to make it into an SCP. At the time, I was going to a vacation in west virginia, and the car ride was boring me to tears. SO I pulled out my phone and started writig it. It took about seven hours, and is the only thing I've ever written only on a phone. The original version had some weird dialog, buty I've had help with it. I'm very proud of the current version.

Also, the numbers for SCP-2600-EX and 5200-J come from the atari consoles.

__SCP-1799__ 

This is my most popular SCP, and one I'm always very proud of. It basically came about because I'd been talking to Sal after the making of 5200-J, and asked if I could make a mister. After looking over the list, I decided on Mister Laugh, mostly because he seemed like the most obvious candidate for physical appearance: a clown. After reading the other misters, and the mister collector tale, I made him into what he is today. He quickly became very successful and is currently my highest rated SCP.

__SCP-703__

This one is a rewrite of the old "random item generator", which was basically just a closet that made random stuff appear. I'd always liked it, so I volunteered for a rewrite. Now, I've always thought that the best rewrites use the original article as a jumping off point for something entirely new. After pondering for awhile, I decided that a closet would logically only want to help you. Oh, and in the incident, the blackboxed SCP is [[[SCP-643]]]

__SCP-1046__

Well, when I was a kid, I had a very active imagination, and would make little characters and stories for myself with tetrahedron blocks. One of these characters was "Mister Messy", a guy who would integrate himself into walls as his superpower or whatever. Eventually I forgot about it, until I started thinking back to my childhood for SCP ideas. I remembered Mister Messy, and thought that it was actually kind of horrifying, being made part of a house. So I changed it to be less of a super power and bring out more of the visceral horror inherit in the original idea, and that's how I came up with SCP-1046.

__SCP-2600-J__

GeneralHarland gave me an idea for an SCP that was a haunted intersection where a kid on a bike got hit. I was stuck on it, until Sal came along in chat and thought I was talking about a -J article. We started riffing on it, and it became a joke article within a few hours.

__SCP-2600__

I've wanted to get this SCP number for years and years. Ever since I started writing seriously for the Foundation. When the contest came around, I couldn't think of anything, and started writing any science fiction concept I could get. That ended up becoming SCP-2082. I eventually got the idea of doing a mashup of MK-Ultra, Polybius, and about a half dozen other urban legends. The ending result is an SCP which doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but has a lot of interesting details and raises a lot of questions. I'd go through and clean it up, but it's at a stable rating and frankly I'm not sure what's going on and I don't know if editing stuff would make it better or ruin it forever.

__SCP-2082__

I wrote this because mammoths are cool, and I also wanted the 2082 number to involve something vaguely involving stuff from the past because of there's a They Might Be Giants song kind of like that called "2082".

__SCP-821__

I got the idea for this after reading "Dixie Before Disney" and wanting to talk about the history of Florida amusement parks in the context of an SCP.

__SCP-992__

The central conceit behind this was that, in the original article we didn't really have a clear idea of how anomalous the guy was. So I wanted to have this playful idea in the article, about how anomalous this guy is. Does he really do and know everything he claims, or is he full of it? In my mind, he's full of it, but not as much as he(or the Foundation) thinks. He's got untapped potential, and he's pretty young fellow in the prophet game.

+++ **Personal History**

Robert J. Clinton has been a scholar and historian for as long as he can remember. His grandfather would take him up to the musty old study, and within they would study the treatise and essays on all the worlds cultures. All through his adolescent years, this nascent love of the histories stayed within him. He cut off the stranglehold of socialization and communication to focus on his studies, and his newfound collection of historical works. 

When he reached adulthood, he worked at a University, in the history department. Although he was widely known as one of the most droll members of the faculty, his wide bank of knowledge overcame the stigma. Clinton learned many new things at this stage of his life, but he always desired to learn more. After he'd completely gone through the University library, he went off to find an even more extensive type of knowledge. While traveling to find such a place, he found his way to the library.
