|comments= Hey nice it's an author page. I'm an Administrator here on the site. My main functions are writing an awful lot and occasionally having good ideas. I wrote the essays on the early history of the community as well. 

I first joined the site in 2012, when I was 16. It heavily influences who I am now at 24. Having a creative outlet like we do here is wonderfully rewarding. It got me through my most difficult teenage years. I wrote most of Series II during that period of my life. You're welcome, Skippers.

That's a slight exaggeration. I've got around 150 SCP articles and almost 100 tales. Also quite a few other pages. I'm not writing at the same rate that I was once producing but I'm still at least semi-regularly contributing. 

I'm also administrating on the [[[http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/|Wanderers Library]]]


Some of my favorite SCP articles I've written are:


[[[SCP-122]]] - No More Monsters. My fiancé read this article before I met her and become a fan of my specific works. How wild is that? Also I got the name from an article which I really enjoyed at the time but was downvoted and deleted. The draft is still out there somewhere on the original sandbox, but it's some weird atomic vending machine and only shares a name.

[[[SCP-213]]] - AntiMatter Parasite. This is my first rewrite and one of my earliest pieces of writing. I've continued tinkering with it over the years but it's holding up fairly well. Props to VAELynx for talking me out of taking away the parasite angle entirely. That was a bad idea that reflected my initial and bad approach to rewrites: Just strip out everything that was mad and re-adapt the existing material to compensate. I'm glad I didn't do it on this one, I've grown rather fond of it over the years. I wrote a tale about it called [[[Daydreamin]]].

[[[SCP-1507]]] - Pink Flamingos. My first article, I've tinkered with this one too over the years but the article people are reading today is functionally the same as when I first posted it. I can vividly remember how nervous I was feeling sitting at my grandparent's kitchen table after working up the nerve to post for the first time. You're only ever posting your first successful article once.

[[[SCP-1833]]] - The Class of '76. This is the article which sprung the Class of '76 into being. I'm very proud of all the people who've contributed and enjoyed this little world over the years. It's never going to be a GoI or background page explaining what's the deal because I like preserving rabbit holes for people to stumble upon.

[[[SCP-2489]]] - A Political Machine. If this isn't my best article, it's certainly up there.

[[[SCP-3776]]] - Camp Nimrod. I've written a few articles touching on the themes here, but I feel as though it's done best in this piece.

[[[SCP-4484]]] - StreamSavers. This is the most enjoyable writing process I've seen through in awhile. It's complete and it's fun and I just like it.

[[[End Of Olympians Hub]]] is something more people should read

* Rewrites: If I'm not around and one of my SCP's hits below +5, it can be rewritten by another member of staff, or someone whom staff deems able to do the rewrite. If possible, I'd like copies of my deleted stuff to be saved, although if I vanish for an extended period of time I won't burden y'all with holding onto my shit. Voct specifically has permission to update and edit my articles anytime he likes, except for A Political Machine and Shortcuts.

* Merchandising: As long as I'm attributed, anyone can make anything with my stuff. 

* Reclaiming Authorship: Well, several members of staff know who I am and what I look like, so they'd be able to recognize me. Moose knows what my current email is, Scantron follows me on twitter and on youtube. If all that fails, Reject, Scantron, thedeadlymoose, TroyL, Kens, and Drewbear have my phone number.

* Other: Anyone has my permission to use my stuff however they please. Tales, references in SCP's, using 'em in games, videos, whatever. As long as I'm credited, you can go nuts.

[[tab SCP Commentary]]
__SCP-1507__

This was my first article that succeeded. I'd just had an SCP bomb, and was trying to find something I knew well so that I could write from the heart. I looked up from my then-desk and saw one of my mothers pink flamingos staring at me from outside. I thought "oh, that's make for a cool article" and wrote it. I got the assistance of MisterBibs, who will always have my eternal thanks for assisting me with my first SCP article. If it weren't for his guidance, I wouldn't be where I am today.

__SCP-5200-J__

Basically, I had an idea at school for a "JUST SAY NO" -J. I came home and started working on it, and stopped shortly into the description. I posted in chat saying "how does it look so far?". Salman Corbette happened to be there, and he thought it was hilarious. He then demanded that I post it immediately. So I did. After 10 minutes of work, I had a successful -J.

__SCP-2600-EX__

This one came from dexanote posting the furred trout myth in the batcave, and telling someone to make it into an SCP. At the time, I was going to a vacation in west virginia, and the car ride was boring me to tears. SO I pulled out my phone and started writig it. It took about seven hours, and is the only thing I've ever written only on a phone. The original version had some weird dialog, buty I've had help with it. I'm very proud of the current version.

Also, the numbers for SCP-2600-EX and 5200-J come from the atari consoles.

__SCP-1799__ 

This is my most popular SCP, and one I'm always very proud of. It basically came about because I'd been talking to Sal after the making of 5200-J, and asked if I could make a mister. After looking over the list, I decided on Mister Laugh, mostly because he seemed like the most obvious candidate for physical appearance: a clown. After reading the other misters, and the mister collector tale, I made him into what he is today. He quickly became very successful and is currently my highest rated SCP.

__SCP-703__

This one is a rewrite of the old "random item generator", which was basically just a closet that made random stuff appear. I'd always liked it, so I volunteered for a rewrite. Now, I've always thought that the best rewrites use the original article as a jumping off point for something entirely new. After pondering for awhile, I decided that a closet would logically only want to help you. Oh, and in the incident, the blackboxed SCP is [[[SCP-643]]]

__SCP-1046__

Well, when I was a kid, I had a very active imagination, and would make little characters and stories for myself with tetrahedron blocks. One of these characters was "Mister Messy", a guy who would integrate himself into walls as his superpower or whatever. Eventually I forgot about it, until I started thinking back to my childhood for SCP ideas. I remembered Mister Messy, and thought that it was actually kind of horrifying, being made part of a house. So I changed it to be less of a super power and bring out more of the visceral horror inherit in the original idea, and that's how I came up with SCP-1046.

__SCP-2600-J__

GeneralHarland gave me an idea for an SCP that was a haunted intersection where a kid on a bike got hit. I was stuck on it, until Sal came along in chat and thought I was talking about a -J article. We started riffing on it, and it became a joke article within a few hours.

__SCP-2600__

I've wanted to get this SCP number for years and years. Ever since I started writing seriously for the Foundation. When the contest came around, I couldn't think of anything, and started writing any science fiction concept I could get. That ended up becoming SCP-2082. I eventually got the idea of doing a mashup of MK-Ultra, Polybius, and about a half dozen other urban legends. The ending result is an SCP which doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but has a lot of interesting details and raises a lot of questions. I'd go through and clean it up, but it's at a stable rating and frankly I'm not sure what's going on and I don't know if editing stuff would make it better or ruin it forever.

__SCP-2082__

I wrote this because mammoths are cool, and I also wanted the 2082 number to involve something vaguely involving stuff from the past because of there's a They Might Be Giants song kind of like that called "2082".

__SCP-821__

I got the idea for this after reading "Dixie Before Disney" and wanting to talk about the history of Florida amusement parks in the context of an SCP.

__SCP-992__

The central conceit behind this was that, in the original article we didn't really have a clear idea of how anomalous the guy was. So I wanted to have this playful idea in the article, about how anomalous this guy is. Does he really do and know everything he claims, or is he full of it? In my mind, he's full of it, but not as much as he(or the Foundation) thinks. He's got untapped potential, and he's pretty young fellow in the prophet game.
