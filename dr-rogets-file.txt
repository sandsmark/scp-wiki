title:Dr. Roget's Personnel File
**Name:** Dr. Ralph J. Roget

**Security Clearance:** Level 3

**Position:** In charge of scheduling.

**Current Location:** Site 11

**History:** Dr.Roget has been working in clerical positions within the Foundation for 17 years now. You think one day he would get a real project. But nooooo, he gets to keep doing clerical work because he's "so darn good at it." He asks for basic, simple promotions, and he gets to make the schedule. Pity poor Roget. He does all the work around this place, but not one person from Site 11 respects his amazing talent. Those jerks.

> **NOTE**
> Doctor, this is both very immature and the wrong way to format your personnel file. Please redo it so I can submit it to the network properly.

> //It's **on**//

> **NOTE**
> Your file has been... Approved.
> ~Rosen
> //You didn't have to break the coffee machine. A simple "please" would have sufficed.//

__WORK IN PROGRESS__

[[[SCP-1507]]], The Pink Flamingos - The first SCP I ever wrote. I had previosuly failed with an SCP about a streetlight that summons things from other dimensions, so I decided to write something I was familiar with...and I looked out the window to see a pink flamingo staring at me, eyes filled with hate. It hovered in the +15 to +20 range for ages before wogglebug wrote a tale about it and it jumped to +40.

[[[scp-why-are-you-reading-a-url-go-be-productive-j|SCP-5200-J]]], Just Say NO!!! - My only -J, was written pretty much because I thought "what if just say no was a -j". Sp i wrote it, and posted a bare bones draft in chat. Now, at the time, Sal was in the chat, and he demanded I post what I had immediately. So I did. The whole thing took about 10 minutes, and so far is the smallest amount of effort I have ever put into an article. Also a shout out to MisterBibs for helping me out with tone.

[[[SCP-1799]]] - My highest rated SCP, written because I asked sal for a little misters list after I realized not all of them had been written. I wrote it over the course of about a week, and it shot up to +70 in about two days, then over the next few months eeked its way to +101. The main change I made was cutting two words from the interview, which totally changed the impact of the SCP. 

[[[SCP-2600-EX]]] - My -EX, written because Dexanote told me to make furred trout into an SCP, and I did. Was made in a car on a phone while driving to West Virginia, and the syntax was messed up. Kudos to Kens and VAE for helping me out there. Some of the dialog was wonky, but I've adjusted that and am happy with how it currently stands.
