**Initial analysis:** Analysis indicates that this was a targeted cognitohazard created with the direct intent of causing F246's mother to kill herself. This would indicate a level of aggression F246 has not shown towards the investigating police officers or any Foundation personnel. It is the belief of our team that the investigating officer's death was purely coincidental, and not intended by F246. Analyst Li speculates that F246's mother may have been anomalous herself, or simply abusive. Autopsy results pending.

Based on initial reports of F246 and the content of F246-2, it is believed to be likely that F246-2's anomalous property will fade over time and become safe. Until then, it should not be handled by anyone suffering from depression or related conditions.
