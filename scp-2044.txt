**Item #:** SCP-2044

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2044-1 is contained in a standard humanoid containment cell, modified to include a small duct to allow for the entry of house flies. --SCP-2044-1 has been conditioned against scratching its scalp, laying on its back, rapidly moving its head, taking aggressive action against house flies in its cell or any other activities which may disrupt SCP-2044-2’s community. Personnel are to discipline SCP-2044-1 if any of the above listed activities are pI create L­olita Slave Toys. In case you are wondering what I meanl it is very simple: I transform young girls in easy, manageable sex toys. That's it. The girls can not walk away, can not resist, can not tell anything; they are just there for your sadistic amusement. Curious how? I am a surgeon living in one of those countries at the eastern outskirts of Europe. A pretty rough society still, poverty is enormous and unless you have money and connections, you are fuc­ked. Needless to say I have both. We also have beautiful girls here, eastern European countries are well known for that. Fortunately (for me) some of these girls don't have parents or relatives anymore and live in orphanages. Actually, I would not call that living as it is unbelievable what you will fidn there. Some very young girls are lucky and get adopted, but at an age of 8 or 9 they are too old. Some of the more pretty girls get sold into prostitution and you could consider it luck for them too; instead of slowly fading away in filth and poverty. And a few girls I buy. I generally pick the attractive girls around 9 or 10 years, before puberty starts. The orphanage is very cooperative. They are glad they have one less mouth to feed, one new place to fill. They also gladly accept my donations for the girls. They never ask and I never tell. They know I am a surgeon; they probably think I do some experiments with the girils or cut out and sell their organs. But no, I found a much more profitable business; I turn the girls into sex toys. You can order a Lol­ita Slave Toy if you want. They are not cheap; I charge $30,000 to $40,000 for a toy. This is without shipping costs. But: You will have a Lol­ita Slave Sex Toy that will give you satisfaction for many years, she is like a doll, but she is a living doll! Let me tell you how I turn a young orphan girl into a living doll. When I have found a new, suitable girl, I will ask the orphanage to deliver her at my villa. She will arive naked, tied and blindfolded. After a bried inspection and a quick medical check, I will take her to my special clinic in my villa. First, I will clean her very thoroughly. These girls really smell and are filthy; they have not seen a bath for ages and they are really neglected. When she is finally clean, I put her in a hospital bed and give her an injection that will put her to sleep. I will create her a new identity and give her a new name, as I don't know the girl's real names, I just know their age, and that's all I need. At the orphanage, any data they have from her will be destroyed. She never existed. She will from now on only exist as a toy. I have a couple Lol­ita Slave Toys myself; Dasha, who is 11 years old and is just in the final stage of her transformation, Tanya, who is now 12 years old; two years since I created her and Luda, who is 14 years old and 4 months pregnant. The next morning is the big operation day. The girl will be still sleeping because of the anesthetic from last night. I put her on the operation table and administer anesthetics for the operation to come. So if you were wondering why my Slave Toy will not resist or walk away, very simple: I amputate her legs and arms! I will amputate her arms above her albows and her legs right above her knees. Easy isn't it? This girl will never run away from you... For the girl this is a very heavy operation and it is probably the most critical step in the transformation process. But most of the times they survive. Now I am not just leaving the girls with stumps on their arms and legs. I will attach a 5 cm metal bar very tightly to the bone on her arms and legs before stitching up the wounds. The other end of the metal bar has a screw-thread, where I can attach an o-ring. When she is ready you easily secure her with a chain or padlock to any object you like! My Tanya and Luda normally have a chain behind her back attached to both o-rings on the stumps of her arms. It will keep here arms nicely close to her body. In the beginning, you have to really take care of the wounds on the stumps to prevent infections. Once the wound is healed completely, I will place a silicone cover over the stump. The outside of the cover is covered with white velvet and this actually looks quite sweet, despite the rather cruel o-rings at the end of what is left of her arms and legs. After a few months, when the legs and arms have fully recovered, you can put some more stain on the o-rings. I started a year ago to hang Tanya and Luda on their arms from the ceiling. It is such an interesting form of decoration in your room to have a naked Lol­ita hanging from your ceiling! And it is very nice to use her cu­nt or mouth when she is hanging like that. But before that we have a long way to go. The operation is not ready yet with amputating her arms and legs. Next I will also cut her vocal cords so she can no longer speak or even make noises, and remove her teeth from her mouth. When I have removed all her teeth, I implant a silicone layer with a soft top layer on her jaws. She will still be able to give bl­ow ­jobs, but she can no longer bite on your di­ck. It is actually quite nice how when she more or less chews a little bit on your co­ck; the soft top layer gives you a kind of massage. The silicone implant is, however, absolutely necessary; if not, her mouth would look like a toothless granny. This will keep her good looks. To further keep her mouth in good shape, she will wear a ball gag most of the time. That does sound somewhat obsolete because I cut her vocal cords and she cannot speak anyway, but this is just because of the esthetics. A gagged girl simply looks good and, besides feeding, drinking, and fuc­king, she does not need her mouth anymore. Once the operation is complete, I will give the girl one or two weeks to recover and let the wounds heal. Then her training begins.erformed.

Following Incident-2044-B, SCP-2044-1 is to be kept in Site-34’s ICU to be provided with medical care in its comatose state. Subject's head is to be kept upright at all times, by means of a padded brace locked around the neck. A high-definition c-mount microscope camera has been installed directly above the scalp of SCP-2044-1, providing a live video feed of SCP-2044-2 for research staff.

As is standard protocol when dealing with parasitic SCPs, a hazmat suit of Level 2 or higher is to be worn when handling SCP-2044 to prevent potential spread of SCP-2044-2 to a separate host. 


**Description:** SCP-2044-1 is a 28-year-old human male of Estonian descent. SCP-2044-1’s scalp is host to a large colony of head lice //(Pediculus humanus capitis)// estimated to be composed of two hundred individual specimens, henceforth referred to as SCP-2044-2. SCP-2044-2 instances possess a level of intelligence estimated to be equal to that of the average human, and are capable of building simple structures, operating machinery, and communicating in the Polish language. SCP-2044-2's small size makes communication impossible without the use of specialized acoustic equipment. 

SCP-2044-2 has established a small community on SCP-2044-1’s scalp. This community is composed of 130 houses, two churches, a pub, six stores, and a town hall. These buildings are constructed by SCP-2044-2 using SCP-2044-1’s hair and dandruff. The only constructs not composed of materials native to the human scalp are a large factory complex on the outskirts of the community, and three track loaders. The purpose of these non-organic elements seems to be the gathering and refinement of SCP-2044-1’s dandruff into small bricks. 

These bricks are taken at the end of every month by a house fly (//Musca domestica//) which arrives on SCP-2044-1’s scalp, where SCP-2044-2 then loads the refined dandruff onto a metal harness installed in its exoskeleton. These house flies also deliver manufactured goods to SCP-2044-2, all of which are scaled down for their use. These supplies include spare parts meant to repair equipment within the dandruff refinery, small tin cans filled with keratinous materials and fragments of potatoes, and gear which is sold by SCP-2044-2 in its several stores. The house fly will then depart to an unknown location. Attempts to locate the origin of these house flies have been unsuccessful, as have attempts to track outgoing instances. 

When questioned on the origin of the house fly, the supplies it brings, the destination of the dandruff bricks, and how the miniature factory complex came to be on SCP-2044-1's scalp, the majority of SCP-2044-2 instances state that “it’s handled by the 'big wigs'.” SCP-2044-2 refuse to elaborate further on this topic, stating that it would violate “company policy.” A transcript of an interview with an instance of SCP-2044-2 is available below. 

--SCP-2044-1 claims no knowledge of SCP-2044-2’s existence, and currently believes he is being held in Foundation custody for the crime of grand theft auto.-- Please refer to Incident-2044-B for SCP-2044-1's current condition.

> **Interviewed**: SCP-2044-2-104 "Bogusław Jasiński"
> **Interviewer**: Dr. Stangar
> **Foreword**: SCP-2044-2-104 claims to be the "foreman" of the factory present on SCP-2044-1's scalp. This interview was conducted using an experimental two-way communication system developed by Foundation scientist for communication with nanoscopic entities. This was the sixth exchange between Dr. Stagnar and SCP-2044-2-104. Exchange translated from Polish.
> **<Log Begin>**
> **Dr. Stangar** : "Hello, Bogusław? Can you hear me?"
> **SCP-2044-2-104** : "Ah! Hello big mammal[[footnote]]"Big mammal" is a term commonly used by SCP-2044-2 to refer to humans[[/footnote]]! I didn't think we would speak again this soon!"
> **Dr. Stangar** : "Yes, now may we return to our previous topic of your refinery?"
> **SCP-2044-2-104** : "You're breaking my nits with these incessant questions, you bękart! If the big wigs hear that I've been engaging in corporate espionage-" 
> **Dr. Stangar** : "Bogusław, I'm trying to help you. This conversation will stay between the two of us. I swear."
> **SCP-2044-2-104** : "Fine, but you had better not use my name."
> **Dr. Stangar** : "Of course. Now, can you tell me who exactly are these 'big wigs'?"
> **SCP-2044-2-104** : They're the top of the food chain. They run our entire operation out of their ivory tower in Nowy Gąszcz[[footnote]]Polish for "New Thicket"[[/footnote]], to the east." 
> **Dr. Stangar** : "What is the purpose of this company?"
> **SCP-2044-2-104** : "Providing building materials to all major urban centers across the globe. We just recently provided those termites in Vrotak[[footnote]]Roughly translated from the Afrikaner language, translates as "Rotten Branch"[[/footnote]] with some foundation for their newest mound. Those bękart in Megachilekutha[[footnote]]Megachile is a genus of large bees. Kutha is Javanese for "city".[[/footnote]] thought they could sell them their crappy honeycomb supports, but we beat them to the punch!"
> **Dr. Stangar** : "..... I see. Would you care to elaborate on the factory? How did it get there?"
> **SCP-2044-2-104** : "A bunch of big mammals like you came in and installed it six years back. Funny thing is that they were all wearing those white robes like you got on. I don't know how they got it on here, but I'm just proud to be in charge of this big mammal instead of my last one."
> **Dr. Stangar** : "What do you mean by last one? Who else has a facto-"
> **SCP-2044-2-104** : //(SCP-2044-2-104 emits a two-second-long, high-pitched noise, assumed to be the equivalent of a sigh)// 
> **SCP-2044-2-104** : "You know what, I'm in enough shit with the big wigs as it is with all these delays in production. Last thing I need is to be caught talking to a fucking big mammal!"
> //SCP-2044-2-104 rapidly retreats into the refinery, shutting the entrance behind it.//
> **<End Log>** 
> //This interview has revealed some startling implications. Not only does it suggest the existence of individuals similar to SCP-2044-1, it also makes reference to insects with a level of intelligence similar to SCP-2044-2. I recommend that we locate and contain these "urban centers" mentioned by SCP-2044-2-104 as soon as possible or at least investigate who these 'big wigs' are and why they built this factory. - Dr. Stangar.//

> The following is a transcript detailing the events which occurred on 9/16/██ which led to SCP-2044-1's current condition.
>  **<9:39>** SCP-2044-1 sits upright on its bed, resting its head on its hand. Subject appears to be distraught. 
>  **<9:40>** SCP-2044-1 gets up and begins frantically clawing at its scalp. Such behavior had not been documented during SCP-2044-1's containment at Site-34. Security teams are mobilized to restrain the subject to prevent potential damage to SCP-2044-2. 
> **<9:42>** SCP-2044-1 props his bed frame against his cell door, preventing site security from entering. Subject then returns to scratching its scalp aggressively. 
> **<9:46>** **SCP-2044-1 //(translated from Estonian)//**: "No! I'm done! I want it off! The big wigs can take it back! It's not worth it! It's not fucking worth it! Get out! Get out! I don't care how much they'll give me! I want to go home! Let me go home you bastards! I want them all off!".
> **<9:48>** A small explosive device detonates at the base of SCP-2044-1's neck. The explosion causes traumatic damage to the subjects spinal column, causing SCP-2044-1 to enter a comatose state and collapse. 
> **<9:50>** Foundation security teams manage to breach SCP-2044-1's cell. Medical teams are mobilized and SCP-2044-1 is evacuated to Site-34's ICU. 
> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> The explosion caused traumatic damage to SCP-2044-1, sending it into a comatose state. When questioned, SCP-2044-2 admitted to detonating the explosion as a "last resort" to pacify their host. Before Incident-2044-B, it was believed that SCP-2044-1 was oblivious to the existence of SCP-2044-2. Investigation into both the subject's final statements and how an explosive implant was present on SCP-2044-1 without being detected by Foundation security is ongoing.
