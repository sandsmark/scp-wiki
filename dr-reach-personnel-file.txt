**Name**: Dr. Reach[[footnote]]It's Reach, just Reach, nothing else than Reach. Don't call him anything else than that, except perhaps "doctor." **And-don't-make-puns.** We don't know why he chose that alias, but any other designation seems to make him horribly unstable. - ████-██ Director ███ ███████[[/footnote]]

**Rank**: Memeticist, Level 2/4098 (conditional).

**Serial Number**: ███-███-████-2

**Location**: Currently assigned to Area-08, Archive Sector.

-----

**History**: Dr. Reach was recruited to the SCP Foundation following an incident involving the accidental release of SCP-1263 to the public. Up until that time, Dr. Reach was working with children at ███ ████████ ██████ ████ Hospital in ████████, ██. When agents approached Dr. Reach to administer amnestics, he expressed great interest in SCP-1263, asking several questions and making pointed insights into its nature. Following this, Dr. Reach was administered the amnestics and added to the Foundation's recruitment roster. 

--He was formally interviewed and added to the SCP-███, SCP-████, and SCP-████ research teams, respectively.-- Currently assigned to Area-08 as Archivist and the Memetics Sector floater crew.

-----

**Addeddum-719:** I would like to point out that this man is dangerous, and not for evident reasons. In the three months he's been working for the SCP-████ team, he has breached through ten different memetic security agents, including two Memetic Gestalt Abrader and a Memetic Kill Agent, //because he did not realize those were there.// I will repeat it: he has gone through those and is still alive and mentally healthy. - Dr. █████████, Head Researcher for SCP-████.

**Addendum-1178:** After taking the Richter-Wiesenthal-Remington Test of memetic resistance, it has been determined that Dr. Reach suffers from Stage 2 Memetic Agnosia as part of a rare but well described reaction to the Class █ amnestics used in the SCP-1263 event that resulted in his recruitment. I'd recommend we let him know all the details of the S2MA Syndrome and offer him a transfer to the Memetics department of Area-08, since it's the only place he is going to be of any use to us (both as a specialist and an occasional study and test subject). - ████-██ Director ███ ███████

**Addendum-████:** Oh, my. I really should not have read all that, should I? Well, since I'm the one programming the autocensors, I hope you like your memes cold, mates. - Dr. Reach.

**Addendum-████-B:** Dr. Reach secured. Anti-psychotics prescribed. - Area-08 Medical Bay.
