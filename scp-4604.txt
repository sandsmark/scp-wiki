**Item #**: SCP-4604

**Object Class**: Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures**: A secure perimeter of two (2) kilometers is to be maintained around the outside of territories of the SCP-4604 instances. --Said instances haven’t been observed to leave their territories.-- **(UPDATE: SEE INCIDENT-4604-A)** Civilians found inside of or attempting to get inside of the perimeter are to be questioned in Provisional Site-4604, amnesticized, and released.

**Description**: SCP-4604 is the designation for at least four (4) humanoid entities located near the woods of [REDACTED], Siberia. Each instance is respectively named SCP-4604-1 through -4.

While every SCP-4604 instance is mostly unique to the others in their appearance, they all have in common that they lack legs and have smoke coming out of their lower body. All SCP-4604 instances are seemingly floating in mid-air.

SCP-4604 instances are generally not hostile unless being attacked. SCP-4604 instances, for the most part, wander within their territory. Animals have been observed to flee on sight, it is currently unknown if this is a simple instinct or an anomalous effect. SCP-4604 instances also appear to not need nutrients, water, or warmth.

If a Human being, hereafter named the 'subject' for clarification, moves closer than five (5) meters to an instance of SCP-4604, it will engage a conversation with said subject. If the Subject is unable to converse in any way or tries to disengage, the subject's heart will stop, killing them instantly. In most cases, the subject and SCP-4604 instance converse using vocalization. The voice of SCP-4604 instances shows traits of both male and female speech and cannot be identified as one or the other. Conversations between subjects untrained in cognitohazards and entities of SCP-4604 have ranged from five (5) to ten (10) minutes.

On 12/5/2008 D-4604-2 was equipped with audiovisual recording gear, and instructed to look for, and converse with an instance of SCP-4604. Below is a transcript of D-4604-2’s recording equipment.

-----
**<BEGIN OF TRANSCRIPT>**

**D-4604-2**: Guys, it’s freezing cold and I haven’t seen no fucked up humans around yet.

**Control**: Just keep searching D-4604-2, we’re certain that they’ll be there.

<Approximately 30 minutes of radio silence.>

**D-4604-2**: God I swear, if I’m ever going to be out of this hellhole I’ll kill the one who sent me --

<An Instance of SCP-4604 comes into D-4604-2’s field of view.>

**SCP-4604-3**: The last flame is the highest reward for those who speak in true riddles, lost child.

**D-4604-2**: <surprised> Excuse me?

**SCP-4604-3**: When the question is wrong, it is as much worth as its answer.

<At this point, Control notices the lack of response from D-4604-2. This is presumed to be an anomalous effect of SCP-4604>

<Only white noise is audible for 3 minutes, after which the audio feed returns.>

**D-4604-2**: <growing desperate> I’m sorry, I don’t understand what you mean, man!

**SCP-4604-3**: When you marched through the snow that is life, your heart looked into the cold abyss.

**D-4604-2**: Why can’t you just let me go?!

**SCP-4604-3**: The heart of the freezing child was dark, as it had engulfed their sin in the shadows. But as they screamed now, begging to be allowed to walk along the wrong path, they realized that one answer will always be out of question.

<SCP-4604-3 is seen holding a matchstick. D-4604-2 grabs it, and sets himself on fire. At this point D-4604-2 is believed to have been exposed to strong cognitohazards by SCP-4604-3.>

**D-4604-2**: Where is the sun burning?

**SCP-4604-3**: In the hearts of those who speak in true riddles.

Two (2) days after the events of Conversation Log 4604, Researcher Winestein made a proposal to use a drone to collect items located in the vicinity of SCP-4604 instances, for the possibility to study their anomalous effects. Below is a table showing the items recovered by said drone.

||~ ITEM RECOVERED ||~ DESCRIPTION ||~ NOTES ||
||= Camera || A russian camera, which appears to be out of the late 1950's. || The only picture on the camera's film is of SCP-4604-2. ||
||= Match || A match. It's head glows red, this phenomenon can be described, as if a flame would shine through it's inside. || Analysis of the wood that the match is made out of revealed that it's at least ████ years old. ||
||= Bible ||= When opened, Researchers were exposed to a previously unknown infohazard. A Squad consisting of four (4) Foundation Agents had been sent to Provisional Site-4604. They successfully contained the infohazard through the use of amnestics and the deletion of security camera footage. || Further study into items associated with SCP-4604 has been halted until further notice. Researcher Winestein is still being interrogated at time of record. ||

On February 15th 2013 a celestial body (the "Chelyabinsk meteoroid") struck Siberia with an equivalent of roughly five-hundred (500) kilotons of TNT. The meteorite wasn’t spotted by asteroid detection telescopes, because it traveled to Earth on a trajectory that was close to the Sun.

In a height of roughly thirty (30) km above sea level, the meteorite broke up into several more pieces. As a celestial body that impacts Earth is an event of great interest, the Foundation ensured that personnel arrived at the impact sites in short time. A roughly two (2) by two (2) meters fragment landed in the territory of SCP-4604-1. A drone that was controlled by technician Holdren, captured the event by accident. Below is a transcript of visual logs recorded by the drone.

**<BEGIN OF TRANSCRIPT>**

**0920**: <During standard exploration mission, technician Holdren notices celestial body on collision course with territory of SCP-4604, and tries to capture the event with the drones visual recording systems, as retrieval of the drone seems impossible>

**0921**: <Fragment of the original meteorite comes into sight traveling with approximately ten (10) km/s>

**0921**: <Impact is expected in under a minute>

**0922**: <Object slows down considerably and hovers roughly one (1) meter above ground>

**0923**: <Object starts emitting light at -260 mag, roughly as bright as 10 Suns>

**0924**: <Object breaks apart while still hovering. Humanoid entity is seen rising from the remains of the object, entity bears similarity to SCP-4604 instances, although a burning halo floats above it’s head>

**0925**: <SCP-4604-1 comes into view. SCP-4604-1 and the entity start having a conversation (See ADDENDUM-4604-D)>

**1005**: <SCP-4604-1 as well as the entity begin to grow wings seemingly out of white fire>

**1006**: <Both rise up into the sky and are not visible anymore>

On the same date that Incident-4604-A happened, SCP-4604-1 conversed with PoI-4604-a, called Gabriel. Below is a snippet from an audio transcript captured by a drone operated by technician Holdren. For the full transcript, contact the Site Administration of Provisional Site-4604. Technician Holdren was interrogated, treated with weak amnestics and released for further work at Provisional Site-4604. Personnel under Level 4 clearance are to be told that the drone didn’t possess audio recording systems.

**PoI-4604-a**: The bell that shouldn’t ring at noon has been corrupted by the false bringer of light. The false flame has to be extinguished before the young ones grow up to find the question.

**SCP-4604-1**: The father of the highest skies would rather eat his children, than he would let them be cold and dark.

**PoI-4604-a**: I require sword and light to be wielded by the soul that is kindled in your heart.

**SCP-4604-1**: The brother spoke, for he loved talking, albeit he already knew the answer his sibling would give.

In October 2017, a celestial body ("Oumuamua") coming from a solar system other than ours, passed by the earth by roughly twenty-three (23) million kilometers at its nearest point. To prevent knowledge of the anomalous phenomenons that occurred alongside this event, false information has been spread by the Foundation in order to masquerade said phenomenons. On the 14th of October 2017, the object in question stopped it’s course by anomalous means and broke up into pieces, revealing a humanoid entity that has been designated PoI-4604-b, called Belial.

Approximately fifteen (15) minutes after foundation researchers noticed the presence of PoI-4604-b, SCP-4604-1 and PoI-4604-a appeared in front of PoI-4604-b. All three entities were seemingly conversing by vocalization, it is currently unknown how the entities were capable of this in the vacuum of space. After their conversation ended, SCP-4604-1 pulled a sword previously hidden in it's chest cavity and struck PoI-4604-b. After SCP-4604-1 had struck them, all entities vanished. The celestial body put itself together and continued on it’s course. SCP-4604-1 has been noted to have returned to their territory. PoI-4604-a and PoI-4604-b haven’t been observed ever since. PoI-4604-b is assumed neutralized.

On the 15th of October, Linguist personnel was given the task of writing a transcript of the conversation that took place by using lip-reading. Below is a snippet of said transcript. For the full transcript, contact the Site Administration of Provisional Site-4604.

**<BEGIN OF TRANSCRIPT>**

**PoI-4604-b**: All your words are worthless when your ears can’t hear the screams of our tortured brothers deep below.

**PoI-4604-a**: The sibling that speaks with three split tongues through three mouths will be banished, for they hate the young children.

**PoI-4604-b**: He, who lives high up in the clouds thinks he can lock up his older children up, for in his eyes we misbehaved. But we will rise like the tide above all that is wrong, and when we do, we will do what is right. Tell our father that we still love him despite his creation of the abominations, for we will undo it.

**SCP-4604-1**: Judgement has been served.
