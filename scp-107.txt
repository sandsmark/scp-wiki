**Item #:** SCP-107

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**
SCP-107 poses no immediate threat, so long as it does not come into contact with any liquid. As such, it is stored at Site-19 in a five (5) metre square containment cell, on a one (1) metre high pedestal, inside a clear perspex container. Experimentation with SCP-107 is to be carried out at Research Area-06, an 11 km^^2^^. area of desolate land in █████████ dedicated to this purpose. Anyone who attempts to activate SCP-107 outside of an approved experiment must be eliminated with any force necessary.
Access to, and removal of the object requires the authorization of two (2) Level 4 personnel, and the approval by said personnel of a full experimental procedure. Should SCP-107 be activated while within Site-19 it must be removed with maximum expediency. To achieve this, at least four (4) members of DTF Sigma-Six ("Puddlejumpers") are to bring [[[SCP-120]]], dialed to Location 9, to SCP-107's storage room, and one (1) D-class operative is to take the object through to Mare Imbrium.

**Description:** SCP-107 resembles the top section of a hollow turtle shell. The shell is composed of a hardened biological material of unknown origin. Whether this material is derived from the shell of a standard sea turtle (superfamily //Chelonioidea//) is, as yet, unknown. The item is completely inert until the inside of the turtle shell comes into contact with a liquid; when it does so, said liquid appears to be absorbed very quickly. Where the liquid drains to is unknown, given the lack of visible pores on the inside of the shell. Once active, the red edge of the shell glows dimly, and the substance placed into the shell begins to precipitate in the atmosphere and fall as 'rain' in the area at least 0.5m, but less than 10km from the object. This phenomenon is mobile: moving SCP-107 will move the area of effect, along with the 'exclusion zone'. 
The duration and intensity appears proportional to the amount of liquid placed in the shell. 10ml of water resulted in just under half an hour of light drizzle, whereas filling to around the three-quarter mark set off two days of torrential rain. SCP-107 appears to have some semblance of 'knowledge', as the effect its precipitation has on the earth is related to the substance placed into the cavity (see experimental log, Addendum 107-2).

**Addendum 107-1:** SCP-107 was discovered by an archaeologist, Prof. M███████ ████████████ in what is now Ethiopia, buried alongside what appeared to be a tribal shaman. Carbon dating performed on the shaman's bones gave an age of around 18000BCE. SCP-107 proved resistant to all attempts to obtain a sample, and therefore no concrete origin date can be determined. The Foundation became involved after intercepting reports of strange weather events at the dig, accompanied by unusual plant growth.

**Addendum 107-2:** Below is a log of all tests carried out with SCP-107. Agents with ideas for sensible future testing protocols should contact me. More tests with liquid-based SCP may have research value, but most are simply too dangerous to carry out, at least with current containment procedures. Tests involving SCP-107 and SCP-009, SCP-447-2 and SCP-874 have been proposed, but were rejected on the grounds that the results have the potential to be dangerous and/or highly unstable. Any requests to test SCP-107 with molten chocolate shall see the requestor reassigned to Keter duty. -- Dr. Quentin I███████

**Input:** 10ml standard tap water
**Result:** Light rain fell over the test site for 27 minutes. Tests on the water showed that it was completely pure and sterile, unlike the tap water that had been placed in the shell, but had no other unusual properties. For at least two weeks after the test, grass at the test site was seen to grow at a much increased rate, and the resulting plants were a richer green in colour than those unaffected by the rain.
    
**Input:** 55ml standard tap water
**Result:** Torrential rainfall over test site for two days, and an effect on the grass similar to that of the first test. Fruit-bearing plants grown in the soil at the test site grew very quickly, and bore much larger fruit than control plants. Effect had diminished considerably after three months.
    
**Input:** 4cm^^3^^ block of wood
**Result:** No effect observed.
    
**Input:** 20g 2mm radius steel ball-bearings
**Result:** No effect observed.
    
**Input:** 10ml human urine
**Result:** Urine rained on the test site for 27 minutes with moderate intensity. Grass at the test site began to die, as did any plant moved to the area for two weeks.
    
**Input:** 10ml human blood, extracted from a Class-D test subject
**Result:** A substance proven afterwards to be human blood with the same genetic makeup as the donating operative fell on the test site for 27 minutes. Grass at the test site appeared to die on contact with the blood, and began rotting within minutes. Any non-grass plants planted in the resulting soil began to mutate and grow large (>20cm across) carnivorous organs similar to those of the 'Venus Flytrap' (//Dionaea muscipula//). When approached by Class-D personnel, the plant was seen to [DATA EXPUNGED]. These organisms began to die back after two weeks.  Further testing with bodily fluids considered unwise.
    
**Further procedure:** A sample of the rain from the first test was collected, and used to water various other plants outside of the test site.
**Result:** No effect was observed.
