It's beginning to look a lot like Eldritch
Everywhere they grow
Tentacles in your head, they’re squirming there once again
Where torture, pain, and going insane won’t go

It's beginning to look a lot like Eldritch
You can’t take it much more
But the most evil sight to see is an undead corpse from me
At your own front door

Fleshcrafting books from their ancestral roots
It’s the wish in a Sarkic’s head
Striders that walk and will turn you to rock
They'll bring you to Corbenic, dead.
And Nine-Tailed Fox can hardly wait to contain them all again

It's beginning to look a lot like Eldritch
Everywhere you go
There's a god we summoned from hell, he’ll be contained as well
And the S.R.A.s will never let him go

It's beginning to look a lot like Eldritch
Soon the day will break
And the terrors it will bring are the evil bloody things
From your flesh they make

It's beginning to look a lot like Eldritch
Bright forevermore
But the scariest sight to see, is MTF Phi-13
At your own front door

Sure it's Eldritch, once more
