**Item #:** SCP-1772

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1772 is kept in a locked plexiglass box in the High-Value Documents section of the Site-19 Archives. Access may be granted with authorization from the Head Archivist and the lead researcher on SCP-1772.

**Description:** SCP-1772 is a copy of the 1983 edition of the ███████-███████ Pocket Spanish-English Dictionary. Whenever an individual uses SCP-1772 to translate any word previously unknown to them, they will become allergic to any word used in the translation.

Upon hearing, reading, or writing any word to which they are allergic, affected subjects will immediately exhibit symptoms of anaphylaxis, such as rashes, redness and itching of the eyes, swelling of the face and throat, and difficulty breathing. These reactions are only partially mitigated by standard antihistamines or epinephrin injections, with an efficacy of approximately 30% of normal. Repeated exposures result in escalating intensity of the reactions. Most subjects will require immediate intubation to facilitate breathing after their 16^^th^^ or 17^^th^^ exposure.

**Experiment Logs:**

> **Reader:** D-2710, speaks/reads English only
> **Word Read:** "huevo"
> **Reaction:** D-2710 is given a notecard with the word "egg" written on it. Upon reading it, she immediately complains of itchy eyes and demonstrates mild swelling of the face. Symptoms abate within 15 minutes.

> **Reader:** D-2717, speaks/reads English only
> **Word Read:** "fresa"
> **Reaction:** D-2717 displays the expected mild anaphylactic reactions upon reading the words "strawberry", "drill", and "dentistry". After recovering, D-2717 is provided a bowl of strawberries to eat. He does not display any allergic reaction to their consumption.

> **Reader:** D-3718, speaks/reads Spanish only
> **Word Read:** "cacahuete"
> **Reaction:** D-3718 is given a notecard with the word "peanut" written on it, followed by a notecard with the word "cacahuete" written on it. He does not display any allergic reaction to either card.

> **Reader:** D-3824, fully Spanish/English bilingual
> **Word Read:** "hola"
> **Reaction:** D-3719 is given a notecard with the word "hello" written on it, followed by a notecard with the word "hola" written on it. She does not display any allergic reaction to either card.

> **Reader:** D-4020, speaks/reads English only
> **Word Read:** "risa"
> **Reaction:** D-3720 is given a notecard with the word "laughter" written on it. She immediately develops a rash over her cheeks.
> **Addendum:** D-3720 engaged in conversation with Guard █████ while being escorted back to her cell. During the conversation, she told a joke which caused Guard █████ to start laughing rapidly. D-3720 immediately began to display symptoms of severe anaphylactic shock. An emergency medical response team was able to stabilize her, and she was returned to her cell within 4 hours. In his debriefing, Guard █████ estimates that he said "ha" 9-10 times before D-3720's reaction became obvious.

> **Reader:** D-4041, speaks/reads English only, specifically chosen due to being named "Hope"
> **Word Read:** "esperanza"
> **Reactions:** After reading the translation, D-4041 was asked to state her full name for documentation purposes. Upon saying her first name, she immediately began to suffer from expected anaphylactic reactions. However, she also began to complain to the interviewer regarding these symptoms, during which it was discovered that any usage of pronouns referencing herself exacerbated the allergic reaction. D-4041 was stabilized after being exposed to 15 utterances of her name or related personal pronouns[[footnote]]Observed allergenic words included "Hope", "I", "me", and "my" when used by D-4041 and "she", "her", and "you" when used by other personnel.[[/footnote]], and was maintained in the medical wing until her termination date.
