**Item #:** SCP-078

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-078 is to be contained in a room with no sources of visible light. Security cameras are to be placed outside all entrances, as well as inside; only live viewing of SCP-078 risks infection. Any personnel who views SCP-078 is to be quarantined and provided photocopies of handwritten reading material for one week; if they display signs of an uplifted mood or a lack of foresight for their actions, they are to be terminated.

**Description:** SCP-078 is a piece of graffiti on a concrete wall approximately one and a half meters on a side, reading "THINK OF ALL THE BABIES YOU BURIED ALIVE." in blue paint. Although the graffiti itself cannot be removed, tests on the edge of SCP-078 have shown that it is only slightly harder to destroy than a standard wall of the same composition; the source of the extra difficulty is not known. 

Viewing SCP-078 has no immediate effects; however, any subject who does so for longer than ten seconds becomes immediately and irreversibly affected. Affected subjects will, when viewing any handwritten piece of writing, occasionally perceive extra sentences; these sentences are not written in the subject's own style or in that of the surrounding text, and always are phrased as if to assuage the subject's guilt on some matter or decision they feel guilty about. For example, a D-class personnel who was convicted of murdering his wife in a heated argument read the sentence "She deserved it for not doing what you said" in his handwritten journal, while Dr. ██████ who left his family to work for the Foundation was accidentally exposed found the phrase "Your work will save humanity." in his notes on SCP-███.

At first, the effect is beneficial; affected subjects report greater peace of mind after exposure to SCP-078. However, the sentences shift from emphasizing the positive consequences of actions to deemphasizing the negative ones on a timescale of one week; Dr. ██████, two days later later, found the sentence "They never loved you anyway." in his personal journal. Within four days, subjects believe that their actions have no consequences; a week later, all actions that subjects take are simply for their immediate personal gratification, with no regard for consequences.

The sole exception to SCP-078's effect is SCP-078 itself; any subject who views SCP-078 a second time will see it displaying increasingly more guilt-inducing messages as duration since their first exposure increases; all subjects who have viewed it a week after initial exposure have committed suicide by the quickest means available.

**Addendum**: A D-class personnel whose handwriting was an unusual mix of cursive and print was exposed to SCP-078, and was then terminated after reaching the 'consequence-free' stage. Subsequently, other subjects have reported seeing sentences in the same cursive-print mix; it is possible that those who die after being exposed to SCP-078 are 'incorporated' into it in some way.
