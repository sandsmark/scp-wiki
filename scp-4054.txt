**Item #:** SCP-4054

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Three NES[[footnote]]Nintendo Entertainment System.[[/footnote]] consoles modified to run SCP-4054 are to be kept for testing purposes. SCP-4054 is to be stored on-site in a secure locker. Access is limited to Level-3 personnel and above.

Foundation agents monitoring flea-markets, yard-sales, and property auctions for anomalous activity are to be briefed on the existence of SCP-4054. Any NES cartridges suspected of being copies of SCP-4054 are to be purchased for examination.

A Foundation-operated bot (I/O-SAURON) is to monitor online gaming communities for discussions regarding the existence of SCP-4054. A joint operation involving MTF Mu-4 ("Debuggers") and MTF Gamma-5 ("Red Herrings") is to be conducted to investigate these discussions and determine whether the participants are aware of SCP-4054.

All copies are to be recovered, and action is to be taken to discredit the existence of SCP-4054 as a hoax or urban legend. Any screen captures or videos of SCP-4054 are to be removed or otherwise replaced with doctored images to further perpetuate this narrative.

**Description:**  SCP-4054 is //The Seventh Door//, an unlicensed platform adventure game released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988. The contents of each cartridge vastly exceeds the storage limitations of its ROM[[footnote]]Read-only memory.[[/footnote]] chip. Extracting SCP-4054's source-code produces a data-file too large to be contained on any currently available device.

Because of its limited publication (three hundred units), inability to be copied, limited replay-ability, and incomplete state, functional copies of //The Seventh Door// are highly valued by vintage NES collectors. The game is also notable for its unique method of bypassing the North American version of the 10NES lock-out system.[[footnote]]The 10NES lock-out system was designed by Nintendo to prevent unlicensed cartridges from operating on their consoles.[[/footnote]] 

[[include component:image-block name=screenshot1.png|caption={{**Fig 1.3:**}} Level 5 (Catacombs).]]

Each cartridge includes two transistors that function as a voltage inverter. When activated, this component produces a negative-charged voltage spike that can temporarily disable early versions of the console's CIC,[[footnote]]Checking Integrated Circuit.[[/footnote]] bypassing the authentication lock and allowing unlicensed cartridges to run. Later iterations of the NES would add a series of 1k resistors along with diodes and grounds to prevent this technique from circumventing the lock-out unit. 

However, a defect in this voltage inverter's design causes irreparable damage to //The Seventh Door//'s SRAM[[footnote]]Static random-access memory.[[/footnote]] with each successive reset. This produces an increasing number of glitches which will inevitably render the cartridge non-functional.

//The Seventh Door// was shipped prior to completion. As a consequence, several core components of game-play differ from what is depicted in its instruction manual and box-art: 

[[include component:image-block name=screenshot2.png|caption={{**Fig 1.4:**}} Level 7 (Buried City). Note several sprites and tiles failing to load correctly.]]

* The protagonist has no extra lives; upon dying, all progress is lost. The cartridge resets.
* All power-ups described in the manual are absent save one (the //Hand of Glory//, which prevents monsters and platforms from moving for ten seconds).
* Falling into a pit does not kill the protagonist. The protagonist will instead continue to fall off-screen as the game-over sound loops.
* Memory overflow errors periodically cause sprites to load incorrectly.
* The seven prisoners use the protagonist's sprite rather than their own. 
* After unlocking a door, prisoners provide no clue regarding the location of other keys (the text boxes are empty). 
* The protagonist dies at apparently random intervals (typically after a period of remaining still). This occurs regardless of whether or not the game is paused.
* All monsters are absent. 
* There is no seventh key.

**Addendum 4054.1:** Video Stream

[[include component:image-block name=stream.png|caption={{**Fig 1.5:**}} Footage taken from user ink49's video stream.]]

In 2004, Charles Rogers (an amateur NES cartridge collector) posted a thread at @@www.opening-the-seventh-door.int@@ (a defunct online forum that was dedicated to //The Seventh Door//) under the user-name 'inky49'. There, he suggested using an NES Game Genie[[footnote]]Produced in 1990, the Game Genie is a 'game-enhancing' module that attaches between the NES cartridge and console. It permits direct modification of reference addresses in the ROM of the cartridge via strings of characters, or 'code'.[[/footnote]] to directly set the value associated with the protagonist's number of keys to seven.

Several days later, Mr. Rogers posted a link to an online video stream where he intended to attempt and beat //The Seventh Door// using this exploit. Part way through his run, the video abruptly stopped. A follow-up investigation determined that Mr. Rogers had gone missing; authorities suspected foul-play after discovering several fingernails torn from Mr. Rogers' left hand inside his NES console.[[footnote]]No copy of //The Seventh Door// was recovered.[[/footnote]]

To date, SCP-4054 has been linked to 25 disappearances. It remains under investigation.
