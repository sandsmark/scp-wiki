**Introduction:** What's up, I'm a shameless 21 year old from somewhere on the East Coast. I chain smoke American Spirits and stay up all night writing and critiquing. This is me. [[*user Dyslexion]]

**Articles I've done:**

* [[[SCP-4928]]]: A story about kittens and a boy's love
* [[[SCP-4451]]]: A story about Nuclear Landmine Roombas and the great capitalist dado


**Tales I've written:**
* [[[The Gift Bestowed Upon You]]]: Something about Gods and Mortals. It's supposed to be good.

If I die[[footnote]]Unlikely, ask about it in IRC[[/footnote]] or become inactive for a period of more than one year, I entrust stewardship of my work to the Staff. When they say "No? We are already doing too much." I pass it to [[*user DrAkimoto]] or [[*user Calibri Bold]], whoever wants it.
