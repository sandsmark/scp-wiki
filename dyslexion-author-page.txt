AUTHORS' RESOURCES

Per
the greenlighting policy
, first-time authors
must
get concepts reviewed in the
Ideas Critique Forum
or
IRC chatrooms
before creating a feedback thread in the Drafts and Critique forum. Draft critique can still be sought via IRC and PM without greenlights.
When you have a draft that you know for sure the audience will like, bring it to
Drafts Critique Forum
. Please note that the forums move much slower than the chat, and the draft forum moves slower than the ideas forum!
The mainsite-run
IRC chatrooms
are the most reliable source of real-time critique discussion.
SCP SANDBOX

A standard sandbox can only be edited by the original author or a mod/admin.

For collaborative pages, please read the instructions
here
.
Sandbox titles should have the author name, not draft name.
This helps make it clear at a glance who owns the page.
Remember to click "Save" and NOT "Save Draft" when editing pages.

**Introduction:** What's up, I'm a shameless 21 year old from somewhere on the East Coast. I chain smoke American Spirits and stay up all night writing and critiquing. This is me. [[*user Dyslexion]]

[[include component:image-block

**Articles I've done:**
* [[[SCP-4204]]]: A story about the Moon and a Thief's coin
* [[[SCP-4928]]]: A story about kittens and a boy's love
* [[[SCP-4451]]]: A story about Nuclear Landmine Roombas and the great capitalist dado


**Tales I've written:**
* [[[The Gift Bestowed Upon You]]]: Something about Gods and Mortals. It's supposed to be good.


These are short. The next ones will be very long. You've been warned. For example,

||~ Project ||~ Stage ||~ Percent Complete ||~ Word Count ||
|| Article || Rough Draft || 50% || 11,200 ||
|| Article || Mid Draft || 75% || 6,000 || 


> If you would like a critique on any draft or concept, please send me a DM on Wikidot or send a message via Raccoons. These can be found in most trash cans.

If I die[[footnote]]Unlikely, ask about it in IRC[[/footnote]] or become inactive for a period of more than one year, I entrust stewardship of my work to the Staff. When they say "No? We are already doing too much." I pass it to [[*user DrAkimoto]] or [[*user Calibri Bold]], whoever wants it.
