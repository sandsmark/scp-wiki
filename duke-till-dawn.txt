title:Duke 'till Dawn
**Foreword by O5-2:** //On █-██-████, an investigation was launched into the continued viability of SCP-083. Several factors were taken into account, such as the relative danger involved in sustained containment and cost-benefit of the costly procurement of virgin blood on a regular basis. In conclusion, a unanimous decision to terminate SCP-083 was made amongst the O5, and handed down to Site 19 administrators. After researching the difficulties involved in terminating a regenerating, superhuman, and potential Keter object, the termination was set in motion. The man chosen for the task was an old standby, a man of great experience and expertise in the elimination of humanoid SCP objects of great destructive potential. Known for his clean, almost surgical method, he was quickly approved to carry out the termination.//

//Unfortunately, he was not available.//

//Despite urging from peers and subordinates, Dr. ████████ Kondraki was chosen to perform the termination. After giving himself the proper clearance and approval to do so through a loophole he had found in relevant regulations, O5 grudgingly accepted his self-appointment. O5-8* assuaged the board’s fears with Dr. Kondraki’s impressive credentials, and claimed that given such an important responsibility, he might finally take his position seriously.//

,,*It should be noted here that O5-8 was a new appointment, and had not been present for the previous disciplinary actions involving the senior doctor.,,

Included below are the relevant logs and documentation concerning the “Duke” termination.


**Note:** //For information involving the collateral damages sustained during the termination, See Document 083-D-Kk.// - O5-2

**Containment Log █████083-DK  █-██¬-████**

> //Dr. Kondraki enters SCP-083’s containment, carries a folding table and two chairs with him. Proceeds to set up all three, as originally planned, taking a seat on one end.//
> 
> Dr. Kondraki: Well, isn’t this a nice little accommodation. They treat you well, Duke, real well for something out of a Bram Stoker novel.
> 
> //SCP-083 takes the seat across from him.//
> 
> SCP-083: Well, I must be doing something right doctor…you know, come to think of it I don’t think I’ve seen you around Site 19.
> 
> Dr. Kondraki: Good, you shouldn’t have. Now, let’s get on with this interview already, I’ve got better things to do that chat with a bloodsucker.
> 
> SCP-083: //[laughs]// I’m not calling you on your diet, am I? Besides, I asked for the interview, and as you know I do get what I want.
> 
> Dr. Kondraki: Sure, sure. Although I remember that you requested a woman, hope you’re not too disappointed, Count. //[Dr. Kondraki proceeds to light a cigarette, and produces a container of a specially treated fluid. In the pre-termination report, Dr. Kondraki did not specify the contents for security reasons.]// 
> 
> SCP-083: I can’t say I’m pleased to accept a brutish specimen of humanity such as yourself, over a lovely morsel of femininity. Don’t worry, I’ll just have to make it up with Ms. ██████ once we’re finished here. 
> 
> //Dr. Kondraki proceeds to unscrew the top from the container, and sets it to the side. SCP-083 appears to recoil from the smell.//
> 
> Dr. Kondraki: So, why don’t you tell me about yourself, Drac? Are you the mythical force of darkness that plagues the psyche of humanity, or are you just a spoiled manchild playing vampire?
> 
> SCP-083-D: [Looks a bit annoyed] I don’t think I like your attitude doctor. Or your lack of respect.
> 
> Dr. Kondraki: //[Blows smoke in SCP-083’s direction]// Funny, I don’t recall giving a shit. 
> 
> //Dr. Kondraki proceeds to grab the container, and splash the liquid onto SCP-083, far before containment teams and backup agents could get into position//
> 
> SCP-083: What…the fuck did you splash me with?
> 
> Dr. Kondraki: Cat urine and garlic juice, batboy, with a bit of silver nitrate.
> 
> //Dr. Kondraki flips the collaspable table up into SCP-083, and draws his firearm. He discharges his handgun seven times into SCP-083’s chest and neck, before producing a wooden stake from his lab coat. The bullets were confirmed to be comprised of a silver alloy. None of these actions had been planned or approved.//
> 
> Dr. Kondraki: Cross that off the list of things I’ve always wanted to do.


**Post-Incident Interview DK-083**
Interviewer: Dr. ███
Interviewee: Dr. Kondraki

> Dr. ███: At what point did you conclude that SCP-083 might be vulnerable to the same weaknesses of a stereotypical vampire, despite no previous evidence?
> 
> Dr. Kondraki: Honestly, I was guessing. I figured, either it worked and I got done early enough to catch some lunch, or I’d have to think fast before he killed me.
> 
> Dr. ███: Think fast? That’s it?
> 
> Dr. Kondraki: Yeah. I couldn’t think of anything else, so I decided to play it by ear. 
> 
> Dr. ███: You’re saying you made it up as you went along? Isn’t that grossly irresponsible, considering SCP-083’s capabilities?
> 
> Dr. Kondraki: He’s dead, ain’t he? I don’t have to explain myself if I get the job done.
> 
> Dr. ███: Alright, fair enough, but I have to wonder about one more thing.
> 
> Dr. Kondraki: Shoot.
> 
> Dr. ███: Why cat urine?
> 
> Dr. Kondraki: Well, if I was wrong and it didn’t work, he’d still be the one covered in cat piss. Didn't think he'd take offense like he did, though.

//At this point in the logs, we are unsure how Dr. Kondraki survived the following moments after the failed termination, due to the destruction of all surveillance equipment beforehand. Security cameras outside of SCP-083’s containment showed Dr. Kondraki and SCP-083 exiting the containment approximately half an hour later. Forensic examination of the damages incurred within the containment are underway. Regardless, a red alert was issued, and security teams were dispatched to contain SCP-083 and get Dr. Kondraki to safety, including Mobile Strike Force Ro-2 “Hawthorne’s Heroes”. As hindsight shows, it would have been more economical to have just shot Dr. Kondraki.// - O5-2
