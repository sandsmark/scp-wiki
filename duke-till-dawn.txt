**Foreword by O5-2:** //On █-██-████, an investigation was launched into the continued viability of SCP-083. Several factors were taken into account, such as the relative danger involved in sustained containment and cost-benefit of the costly procurement of virgin blood on a regular basis. In conclusion, a unanimous decision to terminate SCP-083 was made amongst the O5, and handed down to Site 19 administrators. After researching the difficulties involved in terminating a regenerating, superhuman, and potential Keter object, the termination was set in motion. The man chosen for the task was an old standby, a man of great experience and expertise in the elimination of humanoid SCP objects of great destructive potential. Known for his clean, almost surgical method, he was quickly approved to carry out the termination.//

//Unfortunately, he was not available.//

//Despite urging from peers and subordinates, Dr. ████████ Kondraki was chosen to perform the termination. After giving himself the proper clearance and approval to do so through a loophole he had found in relevant regulations, O5 grudgingly accepted his self-appointment. O5-8* assuaged the board’s fears with Dr. Kondraki’s impressive credentials, and claimed that given such an important responsibility, he might finally take his position seriously.//

,,*It should be noted here that O5-8 was a new appointment, and had not been present for the previous disciplinary actions involving the senior doctor.,,

Included below are the relevant logs and documentation concerning the “Duke” termination.


**Note:** //For information involving the collateral damages sustained during the termination, See Document 083-D-Kk.// - O5-2

**Containment Log █████083-DK  █-██¬-████**

> //Dr. Kondraki enters SCP-083’s containment, carries a folding table and two chairs with him. Proceeds to set up all three, as originally planned, taking a seat on one end.//
> 
> **Dr. Kondraki:** Well, isn’t this a nice little accommodation. They treat you well, Duke, real well for something out of a Bram Stoker novel.
> 
> //SCP-083 takes the seat across from him.//
> 
> **SCP-083:** Well, I must be doing something right doctor…you know, come to think of it I don’t think I’ve seen you around Site 19.
> 
> **Dr. Kondraki:** Good, you shouldn’t have. Now, let’s get on with this interview already, I’ve got better things to do that chat with a bloodsucker.
> 
> **SCP-083:** //[laughs]// I’m not calling you on your diet, am I? Besides, I asked for the interview, and as you know I do get what I want.
> 
> **Dr. Kondraki:** Sure, sure. Although I remember that you requested a woman, hope you’re not too disappointed, Count. //[Dr. Kondraki proceeds to light a cigarette, and produces a container of a specially treated fluid. In the pre-termination report, Dr. Kondraki did not specify the contents for security reasons.]// 
> 
> **SCP-083:** I can’t say I’m pleased to accept a brutish specimen of humanity such as yourself, over a lovely morsel of femininity. Don’t worry, I’ll just have to make it up with Ms. ██████ once we’re finished here. 
> 
> //Dr. Kondraki proceeds to unscrew the top from the container, and sets it to the side. SCP-083 appears to recoil from the smell.//
> 
> **Dr. Kondraki:** So, why don’t you tell me about yourself, Drac? Are you the mythical force of darkness that plagues the psyche of humanity, or are you just a spoiled manchild playing vampire?
> 
> **SCP-083:** [Looks a bit annoyed] I don’t think I like your attitude doctor. Or your lack of respect.
> 
> **Dr. Kondraki:** //[Blows smoke in SCP-083’s direction]// Funny, I don’t recall giving a shit. 
> 
> //Dr. Kondraki proceeds to grab the container, and splash the liquid onto SCP-083, far before containment teams and backup agents could get into position//
> 
> **SCP-083:** What…the fuck did you splash me with?
> 
> **Dr. Kondraki:** Cat urine and garlic juice, batboy, with a bit of silver nitrate.
> 
> //Dr. Kondraki flips the collaspable table up into SCP-083, and draws his firearm. He discharges his handgun seven times into SCP-083’s chest and neck, before producing a wooden stake from his lab coat. The bullets were confirmed to be comprised of a silver alloy. None of these actions had been planned or approved.//
> 
> **Dr. Kondraki:** Cross that off the list of things I’ve always wanted to do.


**Post-Incident Interview DK-083**
Interviewer: Dr. ███
Interviewee: Dr. Kondraki

> **Dr. ███:** At what point did you conclude that SCP-083 might be vulnerable to the same weaknesses of a stereotypical vampire, despite no previous evidence?
> 
> **Dr. Kondraki:** Honestly, I was guessing. I figured, either it worked and I got done early enough to catch some lunch, or I’d have to think fast before he killed me.
> 
> **Dr. ███:** Think fast? That’s it?
> 
> **Dr. Kondraki:** Yeah. I couldn’t think of anything else, so I decided to play it by ear. 
> 
> **Dr. ███:** You’re saying you made it up as you went along? Isn’t that grossly irresponsible, considering SCP-083’s capabilities?
> 
> **Dr. Kondraki:** He’s dead, ain’t he? I don’t have to explain myself if I get the job done.
> 
> **Dr. ███:** Alright, fair enough, but I have to wonder about one more thing.
> 
> **Dr. Kondraki:** Shoot.
> 
> **Dr. ███:** Why cat urine?
> 
> **Dr. Kondraki:** Well, if I was wrong and it didn’t work, he’d still be the one covered in cat piss. Didn't think he'd take offense like he did, though.

> **EXCERPT FROM POST-INCIDENT INTERVIEW 083-963-21**
>  
> **Interviewer:**And, after reviewing the logs, do you think Kondraki acted recklessly?
>  
> **Bright:** (Silence)
>  
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Bright?
>  
> **Bright:** This... This tape is un-doctored?
>  
> **Interviewer:** That is correct Dr. Bright.
>  
> **Bright:** (Dr. Bright shows signs of agitation, swearing in several different languages, and throwing equipment about the room.)
>  
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Bright! What's the matter?
>  
> **Bright:** Not only did I bet that asshole five grand that he wouldn't be able to throw cat piss at 083, but he didn't even have the good grace to die during the termination! Do you realize how much I'm going to lose from paying out on that? God damn!

//At this point in the logs, we are unsure how Dr. Kondraki survived the following moments after the failed termination, due to the destruction of all surveillance equipment beforehand. Security cameras outside of SCP-083’s containment showed Dr. Kondraki and SCP-083 exiting the containment approximately half an hour later. Forensic examination of the damages incurred within the containment are underway. Regardless, a red alert was issued, and security teams were dispatched to contain SCP-083 and get Dr. Kondraki to safety, including Mobile Strike Force Rho-2 “Hawthorne’s Heroes”. As hindsight shows, it would have been more economical to have just shot Dr. Kondraki.// - O5-2

> **Professor Kain Pathos Crow:** It really was a pity about ol' eighty-three... I had a couple of things I wanted to do with him. Like stick him in nine-one-four on various settings and see what happened. Or see how exactly he regenerated decapitation. Or how he reacted to two-one-seven. Or if he'd be a good organ donor. Or if he was-
>  
> **Interviewer:** Uh... sir could you please just answer the question?
>  
> **Professor Kain Pathos Crow:**Hm? Oh yes, well Dr. Kondraki seems to get by in these sort of situations. A master of pulling it out of his ass, so to speak.
>  
> **Interviewer:** So would you label him as reckless then?
>  
> **Professor Kain Pathos Crow:** Yes. Without a doubt.
>  
> **Interviewer:** Uh-huh, so he's a potential liability.
>  
> **Professor Kain Pathos Crow:** Oh I never said that. Granted, he's about as inaccurate as a faulty hand grenade or something of that ilk, the only safe place to be around him is probably inside him or something. But he gets things done, at the expense of everyone and everything around him not sturdy enough to withstand the blast.
>  
> **Interviewer:** ...
>  
> **Professor Kain Pathos Crow:** What? He does.

**Security Log C-083-K**

> Dr. Kondraki exits down hallway R-14 while SCP-083 pursues. Severe damage caused due to blindness inflicted by Dr. Kondraki’s camera(See: [[[SCP-515]]]), which caused considerable thrashing until regeneration could set in. 
> 
> SCP-083 recovers, and pursues Dr. Kondraki further into the central containment areas. 
> 
> Dr. Kondraki, with a small lead, is able to enter non-sentient object containment and makes his way past two armed guards by flashing his ID. 
> 
> SCP-083 enters non-sentient containment, kills and drains several nearby researchers. Searches for Dr. Kondraki within the area, resulting in further casualties.
> 
> Dr. Kondraki accesses a safe within containment, removes a circular object and retreats from containment back into Hallway R-17. 
> 
> SCP-083 continues to pursue, and appears to take chase. Moments later, a flash of light is seen by a camera down the hall, and a bright, disc-like object impacts SCP-083. SCP-083 loses his leg, and falters.
> 
> Dr. Kondraki stops to observe the damage, as the disc(confirmed to be [[[SCP-388]]]) continues through Site 19 and eventually comes to rest 2 km away from the research facility. Dr. Kondraki approaches SCP-083 with a firearm drawn. 
> 
> SCP-083 begins to regenerate, and stand up while braces against the nearby wall. Dr. Kondraki is seen speaking, before taking off down Hallway Y-8. SCP-083 follows shortly after, hopping on one leg until the other regenerates. Seen screaming curses.

**Audio Log 085-D-K-4**

> **Dr. Kondraki** – Well, at least you’ve got a leg to stand on, Count!
> 
> **SCP-083** – I’m going to kill you slowly when I get my hands on you! You don’t even know what kind of shitstorm you’ve gotten yourself into human, but I’m going to kill you and destroy everything you hold dear!
> 
> **Dr. Kondraki** – What was that? I couldn’t hear you over all that arterial spurting. [He gestures to the missing leg] Hey, you know if this vampire thing doesn’t work out, you’d make a great pirate!
> 
> **SCP-085** – In about 5 seconds my leg is going to regenerate and I’m going to tear you to pieces.
> 
> **Dr. Kondraki** – Break a leg, Drac. [Dr. Kondraki departs]
> 
> **SCP-083** – I’ll tear a chunk out of you for every one of those stupid retorts! Every single one!

//It was at this point, as Dr. Kondraki exited the area with SCP-083 in pursuit, that MTF-R-2 arrived to attempt to restore containment of “Duke”. The termination attempt had been considered a failure by command and the orders were limited to damage control. Unfortunately, the other security teams were still en route, and were never able to assist MTF-R-2. If the order hadn’t gone out to evacuate all Euclid objects from the sector, they might have been able to.// - O5-2

**Security Log Y-083-K**

> Dr. Kondraki makes it to a three way intersection before SCP-085 begins to catch up. A forklift moving a large metal box is moving up the incline directly to Dr. Kondraki’s right.
> 
> SCP-083 rounds the corner, but impacts the forklift which had been maneuvered to block the hall. Dr. Kondraki is seen at the door of a central staircase. At this time, they were on the 15th floor of the facility. SCP-083 proceeds to throw the metal box in a fit of frustration, before beginning to move the forklift.
> 
> Dr. Kondraki flees down the staircase. The metal box opens as it impacts the ceiling, and a large, disheveled ball of metal objects is dislodged and begins rolling down the incline.
> 
> MTF-R-2 arrives by way of the central staircase to SCP-083’s current location. Dr. Kondraki passes MTF-R-2. 
> 
> Contact with MTF-R-2 lost.

**Mobile Task Force Rho-2’s Combat Log**

> **MTF-R-2-1** – We’re coming up the staircase now, to SCP-083’s last known location. Sounds of a struggle are coming from above, our intel must be spot on.
> 
> **MTF-R-2-6** – He really screwed the pooch on this one. Garlic piss, where does he get that?
> 
> **MTF-R-2-1** – Quiet on the approach, Six. 
> 
> **MTF-R-2-3** – Sir, incoming subject, humanoid!
> 
> **MTF-R-2-9** – It’s…he’s in a lab coat, it’s not Duke. He’s running straight at us, sir, neutralize him?
> 
> **MTF-R-2-1** – Ready subdermal electroneutralizers, on my…what the hell is that noise?
> 
> **[unidentified]** ….fuck fuck fuck shit fuck dammit shit fuck! Get the hell out of the way, run for your fucking lives!
> 
> **MTF-R-2-2** – He’s taking off down the stairs, must have been Dr. Kondraki! But I don’t see SCP-083!
> 
> **MTF-R-2-1** – No contact on Duke, continue up the st-
> 
> **MTF-R-2-5** – What the hell is that!? It’s…massive!
> 
> **MTF-R-2-1** – Open fire, open fir-

> [unintelligible screams]
> 
> **[Unknown]** – It just crushed him! Get out of here, ge-
> 
> [screams continue, audio cuts out]

//It was at this point that command began to realize that SCP-083 wasn’t the only threat to Site 19 during this incident. Although at this point in time, SCP-083 had caused the death of 17 personnel, Dr. Kondraki had been involved in three cases of containment failure. Most of these personnel had been minor employees, making their loss minor in comparison. MTF-R-2 would be found by site security teams at the bottom of the staircase, completely entangled in [[[SCP-162]]], with several already having been crushed to death, or bled out due to numerous lacerations. Containment of SCP-083 was quickly becoming a distant possibility, and Dr. Kondraki had vanished from visual contact. At the same time, another SCP had breached containment on the opposite side of the facility, and the chaos made details scarce. Meanwhile, SCP-083 was on a rampage trying to locate the doctor. Command was in disarray, and a choice would have to be made soon. It wasn’t soon enough.// - O5-2

> **EXCERPT FROM POST-INCIDENT INTERVIEW 083-CLEF-01**
> 
> **Interviewer:** Seriously? No mistakes?
> 
> **Clef:** I can't really see that Dr. Kondraki made any mistakes in his termination protocol up to this point, no.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Seriously?
>  
> **Clef:** None at all. He had a primary kill mechanism, a backup plan, and a tertiary plan as well. The fact that his plan didn't survive first contact with the enemy wasn't his fault. The deaths of MTF-Rho-2 were a sad and unforeseeable consequence of the Euclid-class SCiPs being moved. . .
> 
> **Interviewer:** I see. So tell me, Dr. Clef, what if all of this wasn't part of some plan, and he'd been making it up as he went along?
> 
> **Clef:** <laughs> In that case, sir, I'd say that Dr. Kondraki was a suicidal fool. But he certainly wouldn't have. . . 
> 
> **Interviewer:** . . .
> 
> **Clef:** . . . he did?
> 
> **Interviewer:** I have here a copy of Dr. Kondraki's termination procedure proposal. Step one is his plan to use cat urine and a pistol loaded with silver bullets. Backup plans two, three, four, And five are listed as, and I quote, 'Wing It,' 'Make Something Up,' 'Cross That Bridge When I Come To It,' and 'Put My Head Between My Knees And Kiss My Ass Goodbye.'

> **EXCERPT FROM POST-INCIDENT INTERVIEW 083-Iceberg-42**
> 
> **Interviewer:** And so you're of the opinion Dr. Kondraki handled things recklessly?
> 
> **Iceberg:** Oh, yes, definitely.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Would you call him a potential liability?
> 
> **Iceberg:** Obviously. He’s a danger just walking around.
> 
> **Interviewer:** I see. Well then Doctor I-
> 
> **Iceberg:** I mean, look at him. The guy’s a lunatic. And one given far too much power.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Alright then-
> 
> **Iceberg:**Clearly he needs to be removed from his post. Probably terminated.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Doctor Iceberg, that is n-
> 
> **Iceberg:** Now, see, this leaves a slight opening. Head of Research at Site 17. Nice job. Now, you see, with him gone, we need someone….. reliable to take his place.
> 
> **Interviewer:** ….

> **Iceberg:** And I think I’m just the person to do it. I’m reliable, hardworking, good at hand to hand,  intelligent, mostly sane, good at organizing, I know over 40 kinds on improvised explosives, I-
> 
> **Interviewer:** That’s quite enough Doctor Iceberg. I believe our interview is over.
> 
> **Iceberg:** Inter…. Interview? You mean…. All this was recorded?
> 
> **Interviewer:** Yes.
>  
> **Iceberg:** And Kondraki will be able to see this?
> 
> **Interviewer:** Possibly.
> 
> **Iceberg:** …… I need to go write my will.

**Security Log C-083-K**

> Visual contact resumed with Dr. Kondraki, seen breaking into a testing lab on the 7th floor, takes possession of an experimental high-tension cable, constructed from an [[[SCP-143]]] alloy with carbon nano-structures. 
> 
> SCP-083 seen arriving on the 7th floor, in pursuit of Dr. Kondraki. Security teams arrive to contain SCP-083 but fail to make an impact. Teams 4, 8, and 14 are wiped out. SCP-083 continues on his path.
> 
> Dr. Kondraki recovers and dons a pair of converse sneakers, recovered from Safe object containment. Dr. Kondraki appears to move at an accelerated pace. Exits containment sector, heading down Hallway D-3.
> 
> SCP-083 continues pursuit of Dr. Kondraki, ruining the containment sector. Is unable to catch Dr. Kondraki due to his enhanced speed, but is able to make up time by bypassing walls in his path. Physically.
> 
> Dr. Kondraki begins to move towards the Keter containment sector, his clearance bypassing the automated security systems. Proceeds to next checkpoint. All Mobile Task Forces are alerted to the situation.
> 
> SCP-083 is slowed by the security checkpoints, and further resistance by site security. SCP-083’s regeneration is able to keep up with any wounds inflicted. Site put on full alert, and all forces are redirected to Keter containment.
> 
> Dr. Kondraki continues to pass through checkpoints. Arrives in a large containment room with a single door opposite to the entrance. Dr. Kondraki’s security clearance is unable to clear the last checkpoint. He pulls an object from his coat, resembling a conical object with a pistol grip.
> 
> SCP-083 arrives in the room. Looks confused, proceeds into the center of the room. Dr. Kondraki no longer visible. SCP-083 approaches the lone door.
> 
> Dr. Kondraki’s voice is detected, appearance of [[[SCP-408]]] reveals him standing near the entrance to the room. A verbal exchange is observed, before Dr. Kondraki speaks into the hand held object(visuals confirm it to be a megaphone of insignificant make).
> 
> Tremors begin to rock the area, and several stress fractures are opened on the wall with the door.
> 
> Containment of Keter level threat [[[SCP-682]]] compromised.

> **EXCERPT FROM POST-INCIDENT INTERVIEW 083-Dr. Gears-62**
> 
> **Dr. Gears:** Reckless is a relative term.  Viewed purely from the vantage point of a termination test carried out against a nearly-invulnerable humanoid SCP object, Dr. Kondraki’s test achieved only a low to medium degree of collateral damage.
> 
> **Interviewer:**  So you feel that Dr. Kondraki’s actions were acceptable?
> 
> **Dr. Gears:**  He achieved his intended goal.  However, the loss of manpower, multiple containment breaches, widespread damage to Site 19, and general lack of planning represent a gross oversight on the part of Dr. Kondraki.  
> 
> **Interviewer:**  Demolishing a good chunk of a site is a little more then oversight in planning.
> 
> **Dr. Gears:**  …Sir, if I may say, I think we are focusing on the wrong direction.  We assume that Dr. Kondraki is a “loose cannon”, a person who is reckless and puts zero foresight into anything he does.  However, this is a narrow and dangerous assumption.
> 
> **Interviewer:**  …What are you talking about?
> 
> **Dr. Gears:**  The human brain has a tendency to view highly complex and rapid patterns as random events.  I believe that Dr. Kondraki used the termination of SCP-083 as an excuse, and the resulting highly destructive “chase” and containment breaches as a distraction.
> 
> **Interviewer:**  So you’re saying…he planned it?
> 
> **Dr. Gears:**  Not in a traditional sense.  To use a mathematical example, he started with the solution, and worked backwards to create the problem.  The multiple containment failures, the evacuation of items, SCP-083 and its attacks on site staff, all these stretched the resources of Site 19 to a dangerously thin level.  This allowed him to achieve what I hypothesize to be his true goal.
> 
> **Interviewer:**  …which would be?
> 
> **Dr. Gears:**  To ride SCP-682.

> **Audio Log C-682-K**
> 
> **Dr. Kondraki:** Well well well, look where we’ve ended up now, Duke. Any guesses as to what’s behind door number one?
> 
> **SCP-085:** I couldn’t give any less of a damn, because all I know is that I cut off the entrance to this area as I came in. You’re trapped in here, doctor, trapped with me, and I’m going to enjoy every moment of it. 
> 
> **Dr. Kondraki:** //[Laughs]// I figure you’d do something like that. I’ll admit that this wasn’t the best place to make a tactical retreat, but I do still have my trump.
> 
> **SCP-083:** And what’s that, those stupid butterflies? You can’t hide forever, and I will find you.
> 
> **Dr. Kondraki:** Oh god I cannot wait to see your face! //[Gestures to the megaphone]// But first, why don’t we invite our friend out from his little room?
> 
> //Dr. Kondraki begins screaming a series of obscenities into the megaphone. SCP-083 attempts to cover his ears to no effect.//
> 
> **SCP-083:** What are yo-
> 
> //[Roars and sounds of buckling metal and cracking concrete fill the air]//
> 
> **SCP-083:** [Looks behind him] You….you son of a-!
> 
> TRANSMISSION LOST

> **EXCERPT FROM POST-INCIDENT INTERVIEW 083-AR9-59**
>
> **Interviewer:** So you do //not// think that Dr. Kondraki behave recklessly?
>
> **Dr. Rights:** I didn't say that, but relatively, compared to some of the things he's done...at least this one almost had a plan. Or some facsimile of one.
>
> **Interviewer:** You have viewed the entirety of the logs, yes?
>
> **Dr. Rights:** Yep. All of it. A few times, actually, and I had to review my favorite parts.
>
> **Interviewer:** And you have no worries about Dr. Kondraki being a liability or a danger?
>
> **Dr. Rights:** Look, the man's a master of the Indy Ploy. And sometimes, actually...all the time, there's collateral damage. But that doesn't change the fact that he, in some bizarre way, knows what he's doing. And hey...if it's saved my ass a few dozen times over, that doesn't hurt.
>
> **Interviewer:** So your personal opinion is that he is not a liability?
>
> **Dr. Rights:** Not as much as Edward effing Cullen, there. I mean...I've got just a big a vampire fetish as the next girl who grew up reading Anne Rice, but come on. Plus, throwing cat pee on him! That was beautiful!
>
> **Interviewer:** ...And in your professional opinion, having worked with Dr. Kondraki in the past?
>
> **Dr. Rights:** ...You clearly haven't been to site 17 lately. Professional is...not my forte. Or Kondraki's for that matter. Shame about Site 19, though...
