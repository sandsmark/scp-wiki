**Item #:** SCP-1191

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1191 must be stored within a chamber no smaller than 3 m in all dimensions, no unsealed aperture larger than 1 cm². Note: object does not register on remote surveillance or through transparent medium, use only to monitor chamber condition. 

**Description:** SCP-1191 consists of an apparently rotten branch of indeterminate species, 97 cm in length and averaging 1.5 cm in width, with a prominent kink 31 cm from the base. Upon making physical contact with SCP-1191, direct or indirect, the subject experiences a shift in their personal history which now includes a violent crime, most commonly resulting in ██████ ███.

The retroactive properties of SCP-1191 are inferred from test subject testimonial. No subject without at least one instance of violent crime has handled the object. Immediate effects of contact appear within twelve seconds as abrupt panic, disorientation, insistence upon events and relationships that do not exist, followed within fifty seconds by violent, traumatic recall of at least one violent incident from subject's past. 

Denial of personal responsibility for prior criminal event is typical, as is insistence on SCP-1191 induced alternate history. Recall of alternate events and relationships subside within forty hours of contact.

Containment in a space less than 3 m results in relocation of SCP-1191 to the exterior of the containment vessel, transition occurring at unpredictable durations after confinement. Transition has yet to be observed.

**Addendum: Recovery Report** 

Agent █████ investigated high density  murder rate in ████, Canada accompanied by former convict D█████. Discarded vehicle discovered in forest at point 5█.████, 1██.████ whereupon D█████ picked up SCP-1191. Agent █████ reports distress, incoherence, abrupt and unprompted denial of a previous crime, followed by agitated description of said events in chronological order. Agent █████ returned without permitting D█████ to release SCP-1191 at any point, employing coercion where applicable. No further items resembling SCP-1191 have been recovered from 5█.████, 1██.████.
