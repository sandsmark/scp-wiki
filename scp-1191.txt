**Item #:** SCP-1191

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1191 is stored within a standard containment chamber, on a 1m plinth. SCP-1191 is a contact hazard and is not to be handled under any circumstances beyond authorised testing. Note: object is not visible with remote surveillance.

**Description:** SCP-1191 appears to be a rotten tree branch, possibly willow, 97 cm in length and averaging 1.5 cm in width, with a prominent kink 31 cm from the base. Direct contact between the object and personnel or via tools less than 1m in length result in activation. 

All contact with SCP-1191 has been carried out by D-class personnel with histories of violent crime. The apparent effects of contact with SCP-1191 are as follows: onset of panic within 12 seconds, paired with disorientation. Each subject appears to be implanted with memories of a theoretical timeline in which they did not commit a violent episode. These memories last for a period no greater than forty hours after contact before the original memory overcomes the implanted memory.

Immediately post exposure, subjects frequently claim SCP-1191 retroactively inserted a violent episode into their personal history. In support, these subjects have demonstrated implanted knowledge beyond their clearance, both of technical details and inter-personal information. Use of D-class personnel in certain contact events appears anomalous. 

Spurious knowledge generation is considered more likely. A test has yet to be determined to distinguish between these possibilities.

**Addendum: Recovery Report** 

Agent █████ investigated high density  history of violent crime in ████, Canada accompanied by former convict D█████. Discarded vehicle discovered in forest at point 5█.████, 1██.████ whereupon D█████ picked up SCP-1191.

Agent █████ returned without permitting D█████ to release SCP-1191 at any point, employing coercion where applicable. No further items resembling SCP-1191 have been recovered from 5█.████, 1██.████.
