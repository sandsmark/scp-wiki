**Item #:** SCP-3854

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3854 is to be kept in a freshwater containment tank in [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-089 |Site]]]-[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3615 |36]]]. SCP-3854 requires no active maintenance, but a wood restoration specialist is to be kept on-site to perform monthly check-ups on the subject.

Personnel that interact with SCP-3854 are to be fluent in Hebrew.

As per Anomalous Sapient Entity protocol, SCP-3854 is to undergo a weekly psychiatric evaluation. 

**Description:** SCP-3854 is a semi-animate, sapient wooden construct superficially resembling a whale. SCP-3854's external dimensions measure 1.1 m x 3.2 m x 1.2 m, while its internal dimensions (designated SCP-3854-A) measure an approximate 500 square meters. SCP-3854 is cognizant, being able to communicate in Biblical Hebrew, Old Aramaic, and [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2696-attached-documentation High Enochian] [[footnote]]Subject displays no additional knowledge of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enochian Pseudo-Enochian], [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1390 Low Enochian], or [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4950 Middle Enochian]. [[/footnote]]. The subject purports to be the aquatic animal that once detained the biblical prophet Jonah, a claim consistent with Assyrian tomes (620-612 BC) from the Horizon Initiative's universal texts. SCP-3854 was recovered washed up on a beach near Tel Aviv, Jerusalem.

The phrase "[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3672 Scrivener Associates]" is painted onto the side of SCP-3854 in plain English.

SCP-3854-A functions as a self-contained thaumaturge confinement chamber comprised of contiguous layers of //Ziziphus spina-christi//[[footnote]] Also known as the "Christ's thorn jujube" or the Lote-tree in regions within the Levant. [[/footnote]]. The teeth, fins, vertebrae frame, and eyes of SCP-3854 were manufactured by timber derived from a ~2620-year-old ziziphus tree located on the outskirts of Jerusalem.

SCP-3854-A-1 is the gastrointestinal domicile that composes the main space of SCP-3854-A, accessible from SCP-3854's mouth. Its construction matches that of modern, Western European synagogues, with the following deviations:

* An abundance of Persian rugs.
* Walls made of ziziphus bark.
* Whalebone archways in the place of doors.
* A ceiling made entirely of whale blubber.
* Two portholes corresponding to SCP-3854's eyes, which emit sunlight regardless of time of day.
* A theater stage in the place of an altar.
* Several Eye of Providence images trained on said theater stage
* A series of clay tablets detailing several morality plays (see addenda)

SCP-3854-A-2 is a postchamber accessible from a doorway at the back of SCP-3854-A-1's theater stage. The room's construction is notably more organic than SCP-3854-A-1, with the walls and ceiling being formed of human epithelial tissue. The floor is made of petrified wood, with select, illuminated spots engraved with Biblical scenes of destruction. The only source of light in SCP-3854-A-2 is SCP-3854-B.

SCP-3854-B is the collective designation for 40 enlarged uteri on the far wall of SCP-3854-A-2. The SCP-3854-B are semi-transparent, and backlit by an orange light of indeterminate source. Each instance, except SCP-3854-B-36, contains an apparent[[footnote]]See Interview Log.[[/footnote]] human zygote. 

SCP-3854-B-36 is empty, with a visible tear indicating violent struggle from its former contents.

**Addendum:** The following is a translated[[footnote]] See: Bishop, Thomas. “Extraordinary Languages, Mundane Typefaces” //Observer: An SCP Foundation Journal// (1995): 375[[/footnote]] excerpt of stone tablets found within SCP-3854-A-1. The tablets were primarily written in High Enochian, with portions, such as Jonah's lines, written in Proto-Sinaitic[[footnote]]Jonah, having lived in approximately the 8th century BC, would have no ability to read Proto-Sinaitic.[[/footnote]]. Further transcripts can be found in Appendix-3854.

Cobwebs conquer every corner of the room. Candlelight blows out too soon and JONAH must settle with an uneasy rest on the matted floor. He has just fled the only home he has ever known. Meanwhile, atop the deck, a storm occurs. Roaring waves bombard the ship. Scared, some SAILORS begin throwing cargo off board while others pray to their heretical Gods. The CAPTAIN hammers JONAH's door.

You can sleep later if there is one. Have you not heard the thunderstorms in the sky?

Yes, I have heard of the thunderstorms in the sky. From you. Just now.

Dear Abzu, Lord of the primeval seas, save me from this fool.

[Cue derelict wood prop falling beside Jonah]

[[size 120%]]**__CAPTAIN:__**[[/size]]
Close enough, Abzu. Now, hurry Jonah, to the deck. We need more hands to throw out the cargo.

[Cue to Jonah feigning tiredness]

[[size 120%]]**__JONAH:__**[[/size]]
If we're going to die anyway, I'd rather do it from the comfiness of a haystack. Come here haystack, yes, be my companion for tonight.

[Cue to Jonah fawning over a vaguely feminine hay pillow. STAGHORN-WINGS pulls Jonah up the stairs and through the doorways.]

Grim, we just shoved off two sacks of gold, three barrels of rum, and five men named Steve[[footnote]]Transliterated from "[{{THIS TERMINAL DOES NOT SUPPORT ENOCHIAN TEXT}}]"[[/footnote]] into the water. The ship won't budge.

Oh Anu, here my cry! Damnit. Oh Enki, I beseech thee, quell this storm! Damnit. Oh Marduk, please tell me you're not a fluke.

[Cue cymbals banging, spotlight flash. LANCED-MOUTHS shrugs two shoulders and throws out its false idols.]

Oh well. That's all of them, Captain.

[[size 120%]]**__CAPTAIN:__**[[/size]]
Damned, Jonah, you better have a God for us, lest we confuse you for cargo like we did Steve.

[Cue to STAGHORN-WINGS making a threatening gesture. Lightning bolt at the top of the mast deployed. Red streamers pop out of the mast, ropes, and sails.]

[[size 120%]]**__JONAH:__**[[/size]]
Hey Jehovah, cut that out. No means no, and I'm not returning your calls just so I can take a "paid" vacation to some foreign country called Nineveh with all manner of molestation and sin. They can rot in a valley.

[[size 120%]]**__VOICE OF THE LORD:__**[[/size]] 
Alright, you know what? No more mister nice-and-benevolent. Convert to me, all of you, then throw Jonah into the big fish.

[Cue to a big fish parking next to the ship. LANCED-MOUTHS and STAGHORN-WINGS haul Jonah from where he stands and flings him overboard. They begin praying and singing hymns to the Lord]

[[size 120%]]**__JONAH:__**[[/size]]
I hate you all!

Pink-red walls pulsate around Jonah as he wakes up. His hand burns from accidentally touching acidic liquids that surround the small amount of land underneath him, made of small kidney stones and hardened barnacle. A bizarre emissary unto the Lord — fluttering countless wings, spinning screaming wheels — levitates above him. Dishes made of whale meat are prepared for him.

You kept burning all the bushes when I was awake commanding me to go to Nineveh. And when I was asleep, you kept yelling about it from a dream cloud.

[[size 120%]]**__JONAH:__**[[/size]]
Alright, alright. O, Lord, slow to anger, fury and all manner of retribution. Your pity hath shaped me, the beast that serves you and humbles me in digestive fluids. Sinners and sodomites shall learn that you forgive iniquity and transgression and sin. I am cured!

[[size 120%]]**__VOICE OF THE LORD:__**[[/size]] 
The Lord, God will by no means absolve the guilty, but by gracious mercy and primordial seas, the Lord shall enter their hearth and wash them clean. You are dismissed, my child. Go to Nineveh unmolested.

[The walls scrunch up and a sneeze is heard. Jonah is spat out of a blowhole.]

**Addendum:** On 12/19/1986, shortly after the initial exploration of SCP-3854-A, SCP-3854 regained consciousness. Lead researcher Chasin subsequently conducted a field interview with SCP-3854:

> **Dr. Chasin:** None? Well, can you tell me who you are?

> **SCP-3854:** //Flotsam//.

> **Dr. Chasin:** What, is it that you just said?

> [Low droning sound]
> 
> **SCP-3854:** No. Angels are not as disposable as me. Different sense of time. They are where they are meant to be. Waiting for their next duty.

> **Dr. Chasin:** Then the womb that was torn open, would that be an escaped angel? Some kind of Christian demon?
