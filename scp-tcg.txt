Hello everyone. , As I said, as a game-designer-to-be, I had to give this game a shot, so here is my concept.

First, **HOW TO WIN**: 
-you win if your opponent do not have any Personnel left (= life). They represent the people managing, covering your activities and funding you.

-you win if you achieve 10 Missions.

-you win if your opponent have more than 10 uncontained (=destroyed) SCP.
 This allows multiples kind of playing: full battle, to destroy opponent SCP, full mission, defensive, etc…

**THE RESOURCES**: it's what you play with.

-Cards. Each player has a deck. There is a single Mission deck for the two players. (the SCP common deck is a great idea, but really hard to use, sorry) you have a 7 card hand. You replace every card you play. Every card is unique, so you can't play 682 if your opponent has even if it has been destroyed (uncontained). Maybe some card may be marked as "not unique", we'll see that as a Power (see below).
-Personnel (Peas): they are counters (red), they represent people you have under your order. You allocate some to play card, and keep some to live. They represent the people managing, covering your activities and funding you. You have 30 personnel at the beginning of the game (I'll keep the VTES scale for cost, so card will cost between 0 and 12 Personnel). This pool is called Administration.
-Class-D: they are counters too (green). You do not keep them, they are used to pay upkeep for SCP, and you earn them at the beginning of each turn, through card. Maybe a base of 3 per turn could be a good start. You lost every Class-D left at the end of your turn = a turn is a month of action at the Foundation.

**THE SET:** 
You will place card on two rows in front of you, and a third row will separate you from your opponent's two rows (for a total of 5 rows).
First, there's the Base row. This is your operation centre. Cards here are quite safe, so they earn 2 Peas per turn if they are not at their maximum.
Then there is the Field Row. Nothing special happens here.
Then the Mission Row, we'll see that later.

**THE CARDS**: two types

Thing Cards (a cool name is required here): they are SCPs, staff, special characters, items, bases and so on… As you can see, they have a lot of characteristics.
-Name
-P-Cost: this is the primary mechanism of the game. You "pay" cars by allocating Personnel to it (just like Pool in VTES). You have to balance between playing card and keeping P left to survive. You can be sure 682 is expensive.
-D-Cost: some very powerful cards have a D-Cost, an upkeep you have to pay every turn with Class-D counters to keep the card contained.
-Illustration, well…
-Base effect: this is what the card does when it's in the Base row
-Field effect: this is what the card does when it's in the Field row.
-Powers: this is the special abilities, the SCP have. They are just like Powers in Heroclix: they are a permanent effect (powers are listed below).
-Strength: this is used to destroy things

SCP cards are a bit different: they have a Classification.
-Safe cards are cool, so you can take Personnel back from it anytime you want to add it to your Administration.
-Euclid cards are the most common. You pay Peas for them and that's it.
-Keter cards are hard to keep, so you need to pay a D-cost to keep them contained.


Mission Cards: they are missions you need to accomplish to 1) win the game and 2) gain some special stuff by completing them. At the beginning of the game, you dispose 5 mission cards on the Mission row, face down.
When you play a Thing Card on the Field in front of a Mission card, you can decide to trigger that mission (reveal it). Place your card on it. The mission is triggered for both players. 
To complete a mission, you need to "move" cards on it, from your Base or your Field. Your opponent can do the same (we'll see on the cards "move" later, will you). Every mission has a precise duration (in turns). When a specific total of Peas has been moved on the card and the duration is over, you complete the mission. Of course, cards on the mission are neither on the field nor on the base, and you lose every effect the can have there. Plus, the Mission row is a pretty dangerous place to go, being right in front of your opponent, so don't send everyone on a 3 turn mission, because your side will be defenceless. The total of Peas needed to complete the mission is counted at the end of the duration, so take your time on 5 turns missions.
If no one has enough P on the mission at the end of the duration, the mission is failed.
On the mission card is written an effect happening for succeeding and failing. It can be great or terrible, of course (winning Peas, bringing back an uncontained SCP, or losing a base, Peas or Dees, etc…) 
Finally, if you won a mission, remove it from the row and keep it (you win if you complete 10 missions). You can replace it by a new mission, but you can also leave the spot empty to "move" to your opponent side and rampage through his Field and Base.

**ACTIONS**: thing you can do once during your turn.

Move: you can move ONE card per turn. Take it and place it:
-anywhere on your side
-in an empty spot on the Mission row
-anywhere on your opponent side if your card was on the mission row or already on your opponent side.
The mission row is a wall between your side and your opponent's.

Scouting: a cool name to tell that you take a Mission card from the deck and place it on a hole in the Mission row.

**FIGHTING**

First thing to know: only Things with the Fight power can attack. Fighting is not always giving punches, many SCP are indestructible, so fighting count as stealing, destroying documents, etc…
To fight, your card needs to go on another card (opponent's or yours), not next to it. Fighting happens at the end of your turn. Every fighting cards remove their total of Strength to the Peas on their opponents. Let's have a simulation (and guess what…):

SCP-682 (P: 12, STR: 12) VS Able (P: 10, STR: 8). we won't consider power for this one, though, so Able simple die. 682 removes 12 peas from Able, Able removes 8 from 682. Too bad.
Now, let's see what happen in a big fight: you moved a Bonehead Henchman (P: 4 STR: 4) and SCP-668 (chef knife, P: 4 gives STR+4) to help Able. So we have a team totalling a STR of 16 and 18 peas, so 682 is quite fucked this time. It's good to know that your opponent chooses where he "inflicts" his damage, so he can choose to kill Able and remove two Peas on your bonehead, or to destroy your guy and the knife and remove 4 Peas from Able. Got it?

When a SCP is destroyed, put it on your Uncontained pile. You know what happens when your reach 10 Uncontained SCP, so don't waste them.
You can attack anything, items, bases etc, but note that locations generally will have a power to resist attacks.

I think we saw every mechanics, so now is the time to list…

**POWERS**: 
Powers are passive ability that modifies the game. A set of 12 powers should be a good start and I think it'll cover most of SCP. Note that some "normal" things can have power too (fight, for example, is pretty common).

Fighting: this card can attack.

Tough: this card takes only half the damage in fight.

Immortal: this card cannot be Uncontained or destroyed. Put it at the bottom of your deck instead. If you won the fight but your Immortal is killed, you can put it on your base row instead (so it can heal).

Free: Sometime "to contain" is harder than "to secure". You can move this card once a turn, even if you already have moved a non-Free card.

Healing: This card gain 2 peas per turn, to its max capacity.

Non Unique: This card is not unique (useful for self-replicating SCP)

Stealing: This card can steal (through mind control or whatever) your opponent cards. At the end of a winning fight, you can take one of your enemy cards involved in the fight to your base row.

Changing: This card can change its form and appearance (with illusion or shape shifting). You can replace a card you control for this card, using the Peas on the card to pay for this Changing card (and adding from your Adm. If needed). Surprise, my Bonehead was 682.

Famous: This is a bad power. The SCP is known and/or searched (inb4 broken god). You decrease your hand size by one when your control a Famous card (and it's cumulative).

Dreadful: This is a rare power, given to XK stuffs and other apocalyptic mind blowing reality raping SCPs. When a Dreadful card is in play, you and your opponents lose a Pea every turn.

Location: This card cannot move.

Equipment: You can put this card on another one to "equip" it. When equipped, this card move with the card it is equipped on. This is not considered as a move action.

Through combination of these first powers, I think we can cover a large panel of SCP to start with.
For example, 682 would have Fighting, Tough, Immortal, Healing and Changing (maybe Famous…).

So, I think we're done here, thanks for reading, and sorry for my poor English, as always.
