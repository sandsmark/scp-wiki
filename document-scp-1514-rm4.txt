**Recovered UIU Documentation**

> **__Audio Log of Item #258 Examination__**
> 
> **Location:** USAF Installation at Groom Lake, NV
> 
> **Foreword:** Item #258 is an unused satellite developed by Project Excalibur-██ and identical to those deployed for SDI-██ System "Xye".  This examination is being performed with the objective of obtaining information pertinent to the understanding and repair of Item #234 (the core component of SDI-██ System "Xye").  "R" and "N" are mechanical engineers with a background in space exploration.  "E" and "A" are agents overseeing the procedure.
> 
> <Begin Log>
> 
> **R:** There's no conduit from these panels...are they just for show?
> 
> **E:** Most likely, we are not sure as of yet what it is powered by.
> 
> **N:** Opening superior side access point.
> 
> //A metallic sound is heard, accompanied by a grunt from "N".//
> 
> **N:** What in all-?
> 
> **R:** What-is that //blood//?
> 
> **N:** No, blood is brighter-colored and more opaque, and-
> 
> //A sharp inhalation is heard.//
> 
> **N:** It smells like iron, this doesn't.
> 
> **A:** What does it smell like?
> 
> **N:** I have no idea.  R, here, take a sample to the lab.
> 
> **R:** Roger.
> 
> //"R" is heard leaving the room.//
> 
> **N:** Continuing with the examination.
> 
> //Wet, rustling sounds are heard.//
> 
> **N:** Components 23, 24, 27...missing.  Unsurprising, all the solar conversion components are gone.  There's a lot of wiring, much more than there should be.  Looks like fiber-optics, all pale gray, tightly-bundled.  Wait a moment...there's no charge, it's certainly not electrical...It's unusually warm in here.
> 
> **E:** Internal temperature?
> 
> **N:** ...37 degrees Centigrade.
> 
> **A:** What's that in-
> 
> **N:** 98 degrees.
> 
> **A:** ...Odd.
> 
> **N:** That //is// odd.  There's really an enormous amount of wiring in here, and I barely see any of the original components-wait a moment.
> 
> **E:** What?
> 
> **N:** I found...something, it's not a component I recognize but-Jesus, what is this-
> 
> //The sounds of rummaging can be heard.//
> 
> **N:** It's an irregularly-shaped container, I'm not sure what it's made of, but it's not metallic...the wiring seems to congregate on this object.
> 
> **A:** How big?
> 
> **N:** Maybe 25cm across at the widest, 15cm at the thinnest...it's fairly light.
> 
> **A:** What-
> 
> **N:** It's warm.
> 
> **A:** Same temperature?
> 
> **N:** Warm...
> 
> **A:** N?
> 
> **E:** N, are you okay?
> 
> **N:** Are you warm enough?
> 
> **E:** N, what-
> 
> **N:** Sleep now...warm and cozy...
> 
> **A:** Fuck.
> 
> **E:** Get him out of there.  Now!  Get him out now-open!
> 
> //Loud thrashing is heard, "N" appears to be crying or laughing, it is unclear.//
> 
> **A:** Oh God-
> 
> **E:** Get them out of him-
> 
> **A:** They're getting longer-
> 
> **E:** That's not fiber-optics-
> 
> **N:** [DATA EXPUNGED]
> 
> **E:** Who is he talking about?!
> 
> **A:** //Cut the wires!//
