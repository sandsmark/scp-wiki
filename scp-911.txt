**Item #:** SCP-911

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-911 is to be stored in a locked High-Value Storage Locker at Site-██. Due to SCP-911's anomalous properties, handling of the artifact should be conducted by level 3/911 personnel equipped with an approved hazmat apparatus of Level B or higher classification. --Testing of the artifact's anomalous properties should conducted exclusively by D-Class personnel with oversight by researchers with level 3/911 clearance.-- Due to information gleaned from interviews with subject 911-1-4, all experimentation with SCP-911 is subject to prior approval by no less than two (2) members of the O5 council.

Subjects who have come in phsyical contact with SCP-911 are to be detained for seventy-two (72) hours in a standard humanoid containment cell to determine status as an instance of SCP-911-1. Instances of SCP-911-1 are to be detained indefinitely. SCP-911-1 instances are to be provided with any reasonable requests except for methods of outside communications.

Researchers are warned to take extreme caution when dealing with subjects created by SCP-911, due to the possibility [DATA EXPUNGED]. See Addendum 911-2 for further information.

**Description:** SCP-911 is a papyrus scroll of The Egyptian Book of the Dead, dating from approximately 1375 BCE. SCP-911 was discovered in 19██ in the home of █████ ██████ in █████████, England following World War II. Embedded Agent █████████ reported the case of Ms. ██████'s death to foundation personnel as possible anomalous activity but was unaware of SCP-911 until coming into physical contact during routine investigation. Foundation personnel, aware of the nature of Agent █████████'s fate, recovered the object and Class-A amnesiacs were administered to witnesses. 

Analysis of SCP-911 has determined it to be non-anomalous in its construction although temperature sensors in the vicinity of the artifact have shown a small drop in ambient temperature (0.7-1.9 degrees Celsius) around the object. Testing to determine the source of this fluctuation is ongoing.

When the epidermal layer of any living human subject comes in contact with SCP-911, the subject's higher brain functions instantaneously cease. While MRI analysis has determined that subjects maintain minimal functions within the brain stem, pons, and medula oblongata, these will decline over the next 48 hours until complete brain death occurs within the subject. This process has been demonstrated in all cases where subjects have physically contacted SCP-911.

In ██% of cases, subjects under the effect of SCP-911 will resume normal brain functions between 12 and 24 hours after initial contact with the artifact. In such cases, individuals who return to normal function are to be considered an instance of SCP-911-1 and detained until a full psychological panel can be completed. Instances of SCP-911-1 display full brain functions in most cases , but often display marked differences in personality and memory. (See Addendum 911-1). SCP-911-1 subjects are to be kept in Foundation custody for study.

**Addendum 911-1:** The following is a record of all pertinent information regarding personnel designated SCP-911-1 in foundation custody (Hereafter SCP-911-1-1 through SCP-911-1-4).

**Recovered Subjects from SCP-911:** 

* **Subject 911-1-1:**  Inhabiting the body of Agent █████████ (Agent responsible for the original recovery of SCP-911), Subject 911-1-1 claims to be a librarian from the Royal Library of Alexandria, captured by SCP-911 circa 180 BCE. Subject retains no memory of his captivity but has proven quite cooperative in interviews. Researchers with level 2 clearance who are fluent in middle Greek are welcome to interview SCP-911-1-1. Validation is ongoing to determine the subject's claims of identity.

* **Subject 911-1-2:**  Formerly D-16173, Subject 911-2 claims to be King ██████ ██ of ███████, a noted collector of ancient manuscripts. Historical sources confirm the passing of King ██████ in 1327 due to indeterminate causes. As with SCP-911-1-1, validation is ongoing to determine SCP-911-1-2's claims of identity.

* **Subject 911-3:**  Formerly D-16292, Subject 911-3 has provided limited information as to his identity or origin. While retaining some higher functions such as vocalization (subject has been noted to scream incoherently in Medieval French), subject suffers from frequent hallucinations, parataxis, psychosis and [REDACTED]. Researchers postulate this to be a result of long-term disassociation and sensory deprivation.

* **Subject 911-4:**  Formerly D-16544, Subject 911-4 is Professor █████ ████████, documented as having been found dead while doing research on ancient languages in December of 1931.  Professor ████████ claims to have been sentient during his entire captivity, and to have maintained his sanity through meditation and strength of will.

> **Interviewed:** SCP-911-1-4
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. ████
> 
> **Foreword:** Formerly D-16544, Subject 911-4 has proven through certifiable verification methods that he is Professor █████ ████████, documented as having been found dead while conducting research on ancient languages in December of 1931.  Professor ████████ claims to have been sentient during his entire captivity, and to have maintained his sanity through meditation and strength of will.

> 
> **Dr. ████:** Hello Professor, how are you today?
> 
>**Subject 911-1-4:** I'm well doctor, thank you again for helping me escape that place.
> 
> **Dr. ████:** Of course, professor. Could you please describe the circumstances that led to your... imprisonment within the object?
> 
> **Subject 911-1-4:** I was researching the usage of some hieroglyphs. ████████ [██████] had loaned me the scroll and instructed me to handle it with leather gloves to avoid allowing the oils of my hands to touch it. I had removed it from the case in which he had shipped it to me and displayed it next to my study materials. Gloves like that are difficult to write with so after the scroll was displayed, I removed them. By chance, the scroll shifted, and I figured that repositioning it would be a trivial matter. The next thing I knew, I was standing on an endless white plain.
> 
> **Dr. ████:** So you're saying that you were transported to another location? Do you have any idea where you were?
> 
> **Subject 911-1-4:** I was transported, yes. As to where, I have no idea. No such place exists, or should ever exist, on God's good earth.
> 
> **Dr. ████:** Can you describe the location?
> 
> **Subject 911-4:**  Not really much to describe. It was white. Empty. Featureless... [SCP-911-1-4 trails off.] 
> 
> **Dr. ████:** What actions did you take upon arrival?
> 
> **Subject 911-4:**  Again, not really much to do. I started walking. Not really much to do except walk there 

Nothing to do but float.  There were others, but most of them are drifting, forever asleep.  Occasionally a portal opened, and some new soul drifted in.
> 
> **Dr. ████:** If you were awake, why couldn't you leave before you did?
> 
> **Subject 911-4:** The portal would only open for a few seconds.  Sometimes one of the sleepers would drift out by chance.  They were always near it, and only one could go through.  We'd have to fight through the crowd, and I guess it took years for me to make it in time. Besides, we had to avoid Him.
> 
> **Dr. ████:** Him?
> 
> **Subject 911-4:** The █████████.  The one who made that place.  He would merge with anyone he could capture.  All they knew would be part of him, and lost to the world.  He is mad.  Screaming for thousands of years...nothing but screaming.  He screams about the Collective.  He thinks it will make him God, but it will be nothing but madness.   All that he learns, he screams into the void.
> 
> **Dr. ████:** The █████████.  Why hasn't he left?
> 
> **Subject 911-4:** He is waiting.  Waiting for the right time, the right body.  He knows of you.  He merged with one of your "agents".  He screams about "SCPs" now, and how he must merge with SCP-███ and SCP-███. The Foundation will save him.  It made no sense at the time, but I understand now -- they are people or things in your possession.  They will make him [DATA EXPUNGED]. Don't let him out.  Never let him out.

**Addendum 911-3:**  Interviews with Subject 911-2 have described an entirely different environment "inside" the scroll. However, 911-2 also speaks of a malevolent, insane entity; in light of this, the Foundation has taken measures to [DATA EXPUNGED].  O5 Command ordered experimentation on SCP-911 to cease without clearance from 2 or more O5 level personnel, upon reading a transcript of this interview.
