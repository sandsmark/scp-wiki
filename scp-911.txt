**Item #:** SCP-911

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-911 is to be stored in a locked High-Value Storage Locker at Site-██. Due to SCP-911's anomalous properties, handling of the artifact should be conducted by level 3/911 personnel equipped with an approved hazmat apparatus of Level B or higher classification. Testing of the artifact's anomalous properties should conducted exclusively by D-Class personnel --with oversight by at least two (2) researchers with security clearance level 3/911.-- Due to information gleaned from interviews with subject 911-1-4, all experimentation with SCP-911 is subject to prior approval by no less than two (2) members of the O5 council.

Subjects who have come in phsyical contact with SCP-911 are to be detained for seventy-two (72) hours in a standard humanoid containment cell to determine status as an instance of SCP-911-1. Instances of SCP-911-1 are to be detained indefinitely. SCP-911-1 instances are to be provided with any reasonable requests except for methods of outside communications.

Researchers are warned to take extreme caution when dealing with subjects created by SCP-911, due to the possibility [DATA EXPUNGED]. See Addendum 911-2 for further information.

**Description:** SCP-911 is a papyrus scroll of The Egyptian Book of the Dead, dating from approximately 1375 BCE. SCP-911 was discovered in 19██ in the home of █████ ██████ in █████████, England following World War II. Embedded Agent █████████ reported the case of Ms. ██████'s death to foundation personnel as possible anomalous activity but was unaware of SCP-911 until coming into physical contact during routine investigation. Foundation personnel, aware of the nature of Agent █████████'s fate, recovered the object and Class-A amnesiacs were administered to witnesses. 

Analysis of SCP-911 has determined it to be non-anomalous in its construction although temperature sensors in the vicinity of the artifact have shown a small drop in ambient temperature (0.7-1.9 degrees Celsius) around the object. Testing to determine the source of this fluctuation is ongoing.

When the epidermal layer of any living human subject comes in contact with SCP-911, the subject's higher brain functions instantaneously cease. While MRI analysis has determined that subjects maintain minimal functions within the brain stem, pons, and medula oblongata, these will decline over the next 48 hours until complete brain death occurs within the subject. This process has been demonstrated in all cases where subjects have physically contacted SCP-911.

In ██% of cases, subjects under the effect of SCP-911 will resume normal brain functions between 12 and 24 hours after initial contact with the artifact. In such cases, individuals who return to normal function are to be considered an instance of SCP-911-1 and detained until a full psychological panel can be completed. Instances of SCP-911-1 display full brain functions in most cases , but often display marked differences in personality and memory. (See Addendum 911-1). SCP-911-1 subjects are to be kept in Foundation custody for study.

**Addendum 911-1:** The following is a record of all pertinent information regarding personnel designated SCP-911-1 in foundation custody (Hereafter SCP-911-1-1 through SCP-911-1-4).

**Recovered Subjects from SCP-911:** 

* **Subject 911-1-1:**  Inhabiting the body of Agent █████████ (Agent responsible for the original recovery of SCP-911), Subject 911-1-1 claims to be a librarian from the Royal Library of Alexandria, captured by SCP-911 circa 180 BCE. Subject retains no memory of his captivity but has proven quite cooperative in interviews. Researchers with level 2 clearance who are fluent in middle Greek are welcome to interview SCP-911-1-1. Validation is ongoing to determine the subject's claims of identity.

* **Subject 911-1-2:**  Formerly D-16173, Subject 911-2 claims to be King ██████ ██ of ███████, a noted collector of ancient manuscripts. Historical sources confirm the passing of King ██████ in 1327 due to indeterminate causes. As with SCP-911-1-1, validation is ongoing to determine SCP-911-1-2's claims of identity.

* **Subject 911-3:**  Formerly D-16292, Subject 911-3 has provided limited information as to his identity or origin. While retaining some higher functions such as vocalization (subject has been noted to scream incoherently in Medieval French), subject suffers from frequent hallucinations, parataxis, psychosis and [REDACTED]. Researchers postulate this to be a result of long-term disassociation and sensory deprivation.

* **Subject 911-4:**  Formerly D-16544, Subject 911-4 is Professor █████ ████████, documented as having been found dead while doing research on ancient languages in December of 1931.  Professor ████████ claims to have been sentient during his entire captivity, and to have maintained his sanity through meditation and strength of will.


**Addendum 911-2:**[[collapsible show="REDACTED BY ORDERS OF RAISA - 4/911 Clearance Required" hide="Credentials Accepted"]]

> **Interviewed:** SCP-911-1-4
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. ████
> 
> **Foreword:** Formerly D-16544, Subject 911-4 has proven through certifiable verification methods that he is Professor █████ ████████, documented as having been found dead while conducting research on ancient languages in December of 1931.  Professor ████████ claims to have been sentient during his entire captivity, and to have maintained his sanity through meditation and strength of will.

> **<Begin Log, [3/12/2███, 16:30:35 GMT-5]>**
> 
> **Dr. ████:** Hello Professor, how are you today?
> 
>**Subject 911-1-4:** I'm well doctor, thank you again for helping me escape that place.
> 
> **Dr. ████:** Of course, professor. Could you please describe the circumstances that led to your... imprisonment within the object?
> 
> **Subject 911-1-4:** I was researching the usage of some hieroglyphs. ████████ [██████] had loaned me the scroll and instructed me to handle it with leather gloves to avoid allowing the oils of my hands to touch it. I had removed it from the case in which he had shipped it to me and displayed it next to my study materials. Gloves like that are difficult to write with so after the scroll was displayed, I removed them. By chance, the scroll shifted, and I figured that repositioning it would be a trivial matter. The next thing I knew, I was standing on an endless white plain.
> 
> **Dr. ████:** So you're saying that you were transported to another location? Do you have any idea where you were?
> 
> **Subject 911-1-4:** I was transported, yes. As to where, I have no idea. No such place exists, or should ever exist, on God's good earth.
> 
> **Dr. ████:** Can you describe the location?
> 
> **Subject 911-4:**  Not really much to describe. It was white. Empty. Featureless... [SCP-911-1-4 trails off.] 
> 
> **Dr. ████:** What actions did you take upon arrival?
> 
> **Subject 911-4:**  Again, not really much to do. I started walking. Not really much to do except walk there. After a while I noticed others, but most of them were... asleep. It was strange though, to sleep standing up as they did.
> 
> **Dr. ████:** How did you manage to escape?
> 
> **Subject 911-4:** I didn't really know what I was doing. Every so often, I would see a small black spot in the distance. You have to understand, doctor, when everything around you is white, your depth perception changes. Anyway, it would only appear for a few seconds. At first I was afraid of it when I saw it, but eventually I realized it was the only thing that broke the monotony of this place. So the next one that opened, I ran for it. Took me probably thirty tries, but finally I got to one as it was closing and saw it. A person would come through the door from... somewhere. They all looked expressionless; no fear, no wonder or concern, it was unnerving, doc. Finally I managed to make it through the door. Just barely, but I made it... and then I was here.
> 
> **Dr. ████:** You said the doors broke up the monotony, was that the only thing that happened in this other place?
> 
> **Subject 911-4:** No. Nothing.
> 
> **Dr. ████:** Your tone suggests there was something else.
> 
> **Subject 911-4:** [agitated] No. There wasn't.
> 
> **Dr. ████:** Professor, someone in your field understands the importance of reliable data. If there was something else, we need to know for our research. Please.
> 
> **Subject 911-4:** [clearly upset] Whenever... whenever a door would open, I would see a place off to my left. Keep in mind that it was all white, you'd notice if it got darker, and this place off to my left, it would get darker. Black smoke would pour from the sky and in the middle of it, he was there.
> 
> **Dr. ████:** He?
> 
> **Subject 911-4:** I'm sorry, doctor, I've said too much. He said that he would escape to claim me if I talked. He made that place and when the door would open, he would be there to claim them. 
> 
> **Dr. ████:** Can you describe the entity you mention?
> 
> **Subject 911-4:** [hysteric] NO! YOU DON'T GET IT! HE WAS INDESCRIBABLE BUT HE WAS THERE! Oh God, the screams when he would take them... [trails off]
> 
> **Dr. ████:** Where would he take them?
> 
> **Subject 911-4:** [SCP-911-1-4 becomes expressionless and monotone] He is madness. He is chaos. Their screaming would join with his for thousands of years...nothing but screaming. They would become a part of him. He screams about the Collective. He thinks it will make him God, but he is madness. All that he learns, he screams into the void.
> 
> **Dr. ████:** How did you escape?
> 
> **Subject 911-4:** [Maintains expression and tone] Escape?
> 
> **Dr. ████:** Where is he now?
> 
> **Subject 911-4:** [DATA EXPUNGED]
> 
> **<End Log, [3/12/2███, 16:42:07 GMT-5]>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** [Security camera footage shows SCP-911-1-4 blink once, followed by Dr. ████'s immediate collapse. Security elements were dispatched to interview chamber and recovered SCP-911-1-4 without incident. Later autopsy revealed cause of death to be massive cerebral hemorrhage brought on by unknown factors. SCP-911-1-4 is currently awaiting re-classification as separate Euclid Level SCP. (Denied by O5-█) As of 3/21/2███, SCP-911-1-4 has remained seated in an upright position and presumably awake for ███ hours.]
