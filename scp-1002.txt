**Item #:** SCP-1002

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All objects tied to instances of SCP-1002 are to be contained in a brightly lit 6m x 6m chamber. SCP-1002-6 is to be contained in a suitably sized hangar. No D-class personnel are to come within ten (10) meters of the containment chamber or hangar. No personnel involved with end-of-the-month termination for D-class personnel are to come within ten (10) meters of the containment chamber or hangar.

All interactions with SCP-1002 instances are to be done via robotic drone. SCP-1002's containment chamber is to be guarded by three (3) members of security who have not yet killed in a combat situation. The same will be done with SCP-1002-6's containment hangar.

**Description:** SCP-1002 is the abnormal shadow belonging to a group of six (6) objects currently in Foundation custody. The shadows of these objects are not those of the objects as they should be, but of humanoid figures garbed in a law enforcement uniforms. Currently recorded instances of SCP-1002 are:

* **SCP-1002-1:** A grandfather clock retrieved from ███████, possesses the shadow of a medieval knight.
* **SCP-1002-2:** A small pole retrieved from ███ ████, possesses the shadow of a member of the ██PD.
* **SCP-1002-3:** Large printer retrieved from ███ ███████, possesses the shadow of a roman soldier.
* **SCP-1002-4:** A pigeon retrieved from ███████, possesses the shadow of a member of the ██████ Police Force.
* **SCP-1002-5:** A kitchen knife retrieved from ███ █████, possesses the shadow of a security guard at the ██████ Casino.
* **SCP-1002-6:** A Boeing 737 retrieved from ███████, possesses the shadow of a member of a SWAT team.

Objects tied to SCP-1002 instances behave in a manner identical to that of a normal version of the object. The shadows tied to SCP-1002 objects are non-stationary until an individual who has committed a crime within the last six (6) months comes within ten (10) meters of the object. At this point, the shadow of the SCP-1002 object will disappear and a physical manifestation of the shadow will appear in a nearby location.

These manifestations will then attempt to pursue the individual. Manifestations are highly agile and capable of moving much faster than the average human. If the individual moves ten (10) meters away from the manifestation, it will disappear and SCP-1002 will reappear as a shadow tied to its respective object.

If the individual is caught by this manifestation, they will inflict a physical punishment directly proportionate to the crime the individual has committed. Despite the severity of this physical punishment, the individual will remain alive until taken ten (10) meters away from the manifestation. Through careful study, researchers have discovered the punishments tied to the following crimes:

* **Minor Crime (Littering, etc.):** Removal and severing of fingers.
* **Shoplifting:** Non-fatal removal of fingers, tongue and eyes
* **Burglary:** Non-fatal removal of fingers, hands, ears, tongue and eyes.
* **Assault:** Non-fatal heavy damaging of legs, removal of fingers, hands, ears, tongue and eyes
* **Murder:** Non-fatal removal of arms, legs, hands, fingers, ears, tongue and eyes
* **Mass-Murder:** Non-fatal removal of arms, legs, hands, fingers, tongue and eyes. Subject was then disemboweled and, using the subjects internal organs, suspended from the ceiling. Movement was detected from the subject for two (2) minutes before they were removed by members of security.
