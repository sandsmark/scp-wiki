SCP-4279 reassembly attempt 7, dated 2019/02/22.
[[/div]]
[[/div]]

----

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4279 is kept disassembled in an anomalous item storage vault at the high-energy physics lab of Site-33. Alteration to a component of SCP-4279 before assembly requires approval from site command. Testing of a reassembled SCP-4279 must be conducted at an off-site explosives testing range and activated remotely. All items produced by SCP-4279 are to be contained and disposed of in accordance to standard procedures for radioactive waste.

**Description:** SCP-4279 is a device separated into 7 components, marked one through seven on attached documentation, with the following descriptions handwritten in Urdu:

* Power Supply
* Lead Ion Collider
* Recombination Vessel (Mk. II: post-Iron metals)
* Element Extruder (Mk. V: Hydrogen through Plutonium)
* Molecular Assembler (Mk. III: Fizzier champagne)
* Output Tray
* Command Input

When assembled, SCP-4279 uses electrical power to generate and assemble matter into theoretically any molecular or atomic form based on pre-programmed designs, the coding language of which has been reverse engineered by Foundation programmers. Items created by SCP-4279, however, invariably produce high amounts of gamma, alpha, and neutron radiation, making them immediately lethal to nearby organic life and posing a lasting ecological threat to the nearby environment. Ongoing research of SCP-4279's components have yet to identify which are responsible for the radioactive side-effect.

**Addendum 4279-1: Discovery**

SCP-4279 was discovered on 2017/08/17 when embedded agents in the Pakistani government alerted the Foundation of an anomalous radiological disaster at a facility owned by Khan Research Laboratories[[footnote]]A weapons and high energy physics laboratory administrated by the Pakistani Armed Forces[[/footnote]] in the city of Kahuta, Pakistan. MTF Unit Beta-7 ("Maz Hatters") dispatched a Curie-class drone remote controlled via insulated wired connection upon measuring a constant radiation rate of 625 mSv/s[[footnote]]millisieverts a second[[/footnote]] at a distance of 1.4 km from the source. 

The drone measured a radiation rate of 7220 mSv/s at a distance of 30m before making visual contact. The video feed identified a single, unopened bottle of champagne sitting on the output tray of SCP-4279 as the source. SCP-4279 was surrounded by multiple cadavers dressed in military uniform and one in a lab coat with a patch bearing the words: Dr. Tanzil Baqri, Research Lead. The bottle was contained within a concrete container with a lead-boron lining by remote controlled drone.

I hope the champagne was fizzy enough this time. Enjoy it.
