> **Foreword:** This page is to be devoted to the documentation of low threat anomalous locations which have been discovered by the SCP Foundation over the years. Although all locations listed in this document warrant securing and cover-up measures, none of them are closely enough tied to an underlying anomalous cause or considered a high enough containment or research priority to warrant full Special Containment Procedure documentation. This list may be used as a resource should knowledge of these locations become useful or necessary in the future.

**Description** An unnamed island (0.44 km²) in the Baltic Sea completely devoid of animal life. Land animals introduced to the island gradually lose survival impetus and typically die of dehydration within days. On initial containment, human subjects developed a flat affect within 15 minutes of exposure and became unresponsive to stimuli within two hours. A single subject eventually recovered when removed within 16 hours, although 50% of subjects failed to recover after 4.25 hours exposure (and expired without medical life support). This effect has decreased over time and as of 2018, these thresholds are estimated to have nearly doubled since initial testing.

**Security Protocol:** The building has been purchased through front companies. One security guard is to monitor the area at any given time.

**Unexplained Location UE-519422**
**Description** A large cabin comprised of pure oxidane. The manner in which the structure maintains a solidified state is unknown though it is theorized to be a telekinetic force exuded from a point in the Earth's upper asthenosphere. When any foreign oxidane comes into contact with the cabin, it will be absorbed into the cabin and be converted into items consistent with that used in suburban homes throughout the late 20th century. As of this current writing, all objects removed from the structure have evaporated after being brought over 5 Meters from the initial entry point to the cabin.
**Date of Containment:** ████-██-██

**Unexplained Location UE-490400**
**Description** UE-490400 is a retail park that extends itself infinitely when an individual attempts to leave the area through the entrance gates. Witnesses describe victims "turning upside-down" followed by them vanishing, along with a persistent scent of plastic and gasoline. "Generated" extra stores in the extended version of the park are usually copies of existing stores, although these can deviate at times. Deviant stores include "Baker Food!", "Quiche Quiche Quiche", "The Long Way 'Round", "Mallwart", "Tobacco High School" and "This Is An Infinite Retail Park".
Individuals that enter this area can leave by passing back through the gates.
**Date of Containment:** 2015-██-██
**Location:** Madison, Wisconsin, USA.
**Security Protocol:** Little effort is required to contain UE-490400's effect. A sign has been placed on the entrance gate's adjacent wall that promises a $50 fine for exiting through it. Cameras monitoring the gates capture any individual to enter the infinite section, who will be retrieved and amnesticized.
**Note:** Who exits through the entrance anyway? - Dr Stuart

**Unexplained Location UE-282412**

**Unexplained Location UE-700560**
**Description** UE-700560-A and UE-700560-B are two areas of land within a 1km distance of each other wherein satellite imaging shows the presence of two non-existent structures, one of which has never existed (a large mansion in a secluded pasture, UE-700560-B), and one of which formerly existed, but has been demolished (an abandoned house located on a nearby side street, UE-700560-A). The latter, formerly existing structure was at one time an anomalous structure, however the structure inexplicably lost its anomalous properties in 2010 and was demolished the following year. Satellite surveillance shows minimal activity occurring at either location, but personnel on the ground report seeing neither the structures, nor subjects coming or going from these areas.
**Date of Containment:** ████-██-██
**Location:** Walkertown, NC, USA.
**Security Protocol:** The pasture land designated UE-700560-B has been purchased by the Foundation and is currently used as a surveillance outpost to monitor activity at either site, itself designated Site-B. Due to the secluded location of both sites and low likelihood of civilians being affected by the anomaly, no action against residents living in the area is authorized.
