**Item #:** SCP-3392

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3392 is to be kept mounted on the wall in its chamber and recorded by at least two video cameras during active testing, arranged in a way so that all writing on SCP-3392 is clearly visible at all times. Supplies of chalk and erasers are to be replenished as needed. Researchers with a master's degree or higher in mathematics are to supervise and observe test subjects while they are interacting with SCP-3392 and review session recordings. Under no circumstances are any personnel other than D-class permitted to write on SCP-3392 or modify the writing on its surface in any way. Any personnel who have been affected by the object are to be administered class A amnestics.

**Description:** SCP-3392 is a rectangular wall-mounted chalkboard approximately 2 meters wide and 1.5 meters tall. Its anomalous properties manifest when an individual uses it as a writing surface to carry out mathematical calculations. Upon finding the solution to the initial problem, testing subjects report feeling a sudden sense of "discovery", and will immediately display a strong desire to continue writing on SCP-3392 and expand upon their calculations. Subjects who continue to interact with SCP-3392 will soon become unresponsive to external stimuli and become exclusively invested in their work, neglecting to even rest or eat. These subjects must be forcibly separated from SCP-3392 and taken outside direct line of sight to the object in order to divert their attention.

Subjects who are allowed to continue interacting with SCP-3392 for extended periods of time appear to display increasing mathematical proficiency in their calculations, regardless of their previous education or background in mathematics. Upon being separated from SCP-3392, however, subjects appear to immediately lose such abilities. In most cases, subjects seem to become even less proficient than they were before interacting with the object. The degree to which this effect occurs depends on the amount of time previously spent with the object.

**Recovery Report:** SCP-3392 was recovered on 4/23/20██ from the University of ███████ after the body of university professor ██████ was discovered on the floor below the object by colleagues returning from spring break. The autopsy concluded that ██████ had died approximately 46 hours prior from dehydration.

__**Test A - 5/2/20██**__
> **Researchers:** Dr. Alvin, Dr. Stevenson
> 
> **Subject:** D-31125, 26 year old African-American male.
> 
> **Procedure:** Subject will be instructed to solve a simple addition problem (10 + 4) using SCP-3392 and a piece of chalk.
> 
> **Results:** Subject quickly found and wrote the solution (14). Subject then hesitated and stared at the object for several seconds, then began to write and solve a series of other addition problems without being prompted by researchers. Subject did not respond to researchers' attempts to gain their attention. Researchers ended the test and removed the subject from the room after one hour and thirty minutes, at which point the subject had filled the board with a series of simple multiplication computations.
> 
> Subject was later questioned about their behavior during the test. Subject reported feeling as though they had "made a new discovery" and had developed "a better understanding of numbers and how they work". Subject did not recall the attempts by researchers to gain their attention during the test.

__**Test B - 5/4/20██**__
> **Researchers:** Dr. Alvin, Dr. Stevenson
> 
> **Subject:** D-31163, 31 year old Caucasian female. As suggested by Dr. Stevenson, D-31163 was given a standardized math aptitude test and received a score of 88%.
> 
> **Procedure:** Subject will be instructed to solve a problem taken from an eighth grade algebra textbook ([[$ 7(1 - 2x) = 7x $]]) using SCP-3392.
> 
> **Results:** Subject worked out the problem by hand and wrote down the solution ([[$ x = 1/3 $]]). Like the previous test, the subject stared at the object for a moment, then began to write a series of other problems similar to the one given. Researchers again tried to gain the subject's attention and were again unsuccessful. Researchers ended the test and removed the subject from the room after three hours. In this time, the subject had carried out over 170 algebraic computations, checked each one, and at several points wrote down the commutative property, associative property, and distributive property.
> 
> Subject was questioned afterwards and described a similar experience to that of D-31125, although they were unable to remember or reproduce the computations they had performed during the test. Subject retook the aptitude test and received a score of 75%.

__**Test C - 5/7/20██**__
> **Researchers:** Dr. Alvin, Dr. Stevenson
> 
> **Subject:** D-31229, 43 year old Caucasian female. Subject was given a standardized math aptitude test and received a score of 92%.
> 
> **Procedure:** Subject will be instructed to write three sentences on SCP-3392 using the word "study"; one using the present tense, one using the past tense, and one using the infinitive form.
> 
> **Results:** Subject wrote the following sentences:
> 
> //Jason is studying chemistry in school.
> Alice studied for her exam.
> You should always study if you want a good grade.//
> 
> Subject then turned to the researchers and asked if there were any additional instructions. Researchers ended the test and the subject was directed out of the room.
> 
> Subject was questioned afterwards and described no abnormal thoughts or feelings about the test or about SCP-3392. Subject was able to clearly recall the events of the test and reproduce the answers they gave. Subject retook the aptitude test and received a score of 92%.
> 
> //Note: SCP-3392 seems to have had no unusual effects on the subject in this case. Evidence, perhaps, that the effect only occurs with work related to mathematics. - Dr. Alvin//

**Addendum 3392-B-1:**

Date: 5/18/20██

Long term testing with SCP-3392 and D-31296 has been approved. D-31296 is permitted to interact with SCP-3392 daily between 10:00 AM and 7:00 PM, under the supervision of Dr. Alvin and Dr. Stevenson. At the request of Dr. Alvin, additional materials have been supplied for D-31296 to use, including a ruler, protractor, and bow compass. Any writing on SCP-3392 is to remain undisturbed between testing sessions. D-31296 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell while not interacting with SPC-3392.

------

__**Session D1 - 5/21/20██**__
> **Researchers:** Dr. Alvin, Dr. Stevenson
> 
> **Subject:** D-31296, 28 year old Hispanic male. Subject was given a standardized math aptitude test and received a score of 72%.
> 
> **Procedure:** Subject will be instructed to solve a high school level algebra problem
> ([[$ y = -x^2,  y = 3x^2 + 4x - 8 $]]) using SCP-3392.
> 
> **Results:** Subject was initially reluctant to complete the task, alluding to a poor background in mathematics. After several minutes, the subject wrote down the solution to the problem
> ([[$ x = -2, x = 1 $]]). Consistent with tests A and B, the subject proceeded to stare at the object then began working out a series of additional problems. By the end of the session, the subject had covered the entire surface of the object several times with algebraic equations and graphs of various functions, erasing parts of the board on numerous occasions to make space for more calculations.
> 
> Subject was questioned afterwards and described an experience similar to those described in tests A and B. Subject was unable to remember or reproduce the computations they had performed during the test, nor were they able to follow their own calculations when showed video recordings from the test. Subject retook the aptitude test and received a score of 66%.

__**Session D2 - 5/22/20██**__
> **Researchers:** Dr. Alvin, Dr. Stevenson
> 
> **Subject:** D-31296
> 
> **Procedure:** Subject will be brought in front of SCP-3392 and instructed to resume interacting with the object.
> 
> **Results:** Subject immediately began interacting with SCP-3392. Subject worked continuously for the full duration of the session, occasionally using the tools provided. Work done by the subject during this session included drawing various shapes and finding their areas, as well as drawing a series of circles inscribed inside various polygons.
> 
> Subject retook the aptitude test and received a score of 60%.

__**Session D3 - 5/23/20██**__
> **Researchers:** Dr. Alvin, Dr. Stevenson
> 
> **Subject:** D-31296
> 
> **Procedure:** Subject will be brought in front of SCP-3392 and instructed to resume interacting with the object.
> 
> **Results:** Subject was particularly invested in a specific equation and worked on it for approximately two hours before moving on to a different problem. Upon reviewing the video recordings, Dr. Stevenson determined that the subject had produced a proof of the fundamental theorem of calculus. A review of D-31296's file showed that the subject had not taken any calculus related courses throughout their educational history.
> 
> Subject retook the aptitude test and received a score of 50%.
> 
> //Note: We're getting some intriguing results here. I'm interested in seeing how far this progresses. - Dr. Alvin//

__**Session D4 - 5/24/20██**__
> **Researchers:** Dr. Alvin, Dr. Stevenson
> 
> **Subject:** D-31296
> 
> **Procedure:** Subject will be brought in front of SCP-3392 and instructed to resume interacting with the object.
> 
> **Results:** Subject began writing a series of equations using unknown methods of notation. Session recordings were sent to Dr. █████ for analysis. Dr. █████ concluded that the subject's work most closely resembled processes involved in advanced calculus, although the specific notation used did not seem to match that used by any known scientific discipline.
> 
> Subject retook the aptitude test and received a score of 38%.
> 
> //Note: Given the level of cognitive ability that D-31296 displays, Dr. Stevenson has suggested that attempts be made to work with the subject in hopes of solving some long-standing problems. I'm not sure if he'll be interested in anything other than his own work, but if it means making some big contributions to science, then it's worth a shot. - Dr. Alvin//

__**Session D5 - 5/25/20██**__
> **Researchers:** Dr. Alvin, Dr. Stevenson
> 
> **Subject:** D-31296
> 
> **Procedure:** Subject will be brought in front of SCP-3392. Dr. Stevenson will write a version of the Riemann hypothesis on SCP-3392 for D-31296 to solve.
> 
> **Results:** Upon attempting to write on SCP-3392, Dr. Stevenson was violently attacked by D-31296. Two guards were called in to assist in detaining D-31296. The test was prematurely ended following the incedent. Dr. Stevenson suffered severe bruising and a fracture in his right wrist.
> 
> Full details can be found in Incident Report 3392-D5-A.

**Addendum 3392-B-2:**

Date: 5/25/20██

Dr. Stevenson has been placed under medical supervision and removed from assignment to SCP-3392 due to his injuries. Dr. Alvin has petitioned to allow testing using D-31296 to continue on the conditions that interactions with SCP-3392 by personnel other than D-31296 are prohibited.

------

**Addendum 3392-B-3:**

Date: 5/28/20██

Continued testing of SCP-3392 involving D-31296 has been approved on the conditions that 1) no personnel other than D-31296 are to make contact with SCP-3392 during testing, 2) all researchers are to observe tests from a separate room adjacent to the testing chamber via a bullet-proof viewing window, and 3) testing times be reduced to the hours of 12:00 PM to 5:00 PM to prevent overexertion of D-31296.

------

__**Session D6 - 5/29/20██**__
> **Researchers:** Dr. Alvin, Dr. ███████
> 
> **Subject:** D-31296
> 
> **Procedure:** Subject will be brought in front of SCP-3392 and instructed to resume interacting with the object.
> 
> **Results:** Subject began to introduce a large variety of unfamiliar notation into their work. Session recordings were sent to Dr. █████ and Dr. ████████ for analysis. Researchers were unable to determine the exact type of calculations represented by this notation, but theorized it may involve some field of physics.
> 
> Subject retook the aptitude test and received a score of 19%.

__**Session D7 - 5/30/20██**__
> **Researchers:** Dr. Alvin, Dr. ███████
> 
> **Subject:** D-31296
> 
> **Procedure:** Subject will be brought in front of SCP-3392 and instructed to resume interacting with the object.
> 
> **Results:** Subject made almost exclusive use of the unique notation observed in session D6, only rarely using Arabic numerals or alphabetic characters. Subject occasionally expressed moderate frustration. Session recordings were sent to Dr. █████ and Dr. ████████ for analysis. Researchers were unable to determine the type of calculations carried out by the subject during this session.
> 
> Subject failed to complete the subsequent aptitude test.

__**Session D8 - 5/31/20██**__
> **Researchers:** Dr. Alvin, Dr. ███████
> 
> **Subject:** D-31296
> 
> **Procedure:** Subject will be brought in front of SCP-3392 and instructed to resume interacting with the object.
> 
> **Results:** Subject worked frantically for approximately 43 minutes exclusively using the unidentified notation. Upon apparently finding the solution to a particular equation, the subject began to express delight and laugh, then proceeded to draw a large circular design on SCP-3392. As the subject completed the design, an aura of bright purple light manifested in front of SCP-3392. The subject laughed joyfully and stepped into the aura, which then disappeared. Researchers ended the test due to the disappearance of the subject.
> 
> Full details can be found in Incident Report 3392-D8-B.

**Addendum 3392-B-4:**

Date: 5/31/20██

All testing with SCP-3392 has been suspended until D-31296 can be located.
