**Item #:** SCP-3214

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** A specialized Foundation webcrawler[[footnote]]Adapted from I/O BEHOLDER. See [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3299|SCP-3299]]] for details.[[/footnote]] will monitor digital advertising exchanges for new copies of SCP-3214. Blocking or deleting SCP-3214 from its current exchange may temporarily prevent new SCP-3214 from being served. 

If any clickthroughs are detected, a containment team must be dispatched to contain all individuals affected by the anomaly and assess the severity of the outbreak. Hospital records must be monitored for individuals who have ingested all or part of a cellular phone, tablet, laptop computer or wireless router.[[footnote]]For a full list of susceptible devices, see Documents 3214-b1-4.[[/footnote]] Any device with a screen or speaker must be disconnected from power in the vicinity of individuals experiencing a retargeting event. No cellphone or other susceptible device is allowed within 30 meters of an instance of SCP-3214-1 except during approved tests. 

**Description:** SCP-3214 is a digital video advertisement which displays anomalous retargeting and personalization. It inflicts a compulsion to eat cellular phones and other susceptible devices on those who view or hear it for more than five seconds (hereafter SCP-3214-1). When an SCP-3214-1 does consume such a device, any other susceptible device within approximately 30 meters will be served an SCP-3214 impression.[[footnote]]When a digital advertisement is fetched from its server by a user's browser, it is counted as an impression.[[/footnote]] If an individual to whom an SCP-3214 impression has been served[[footnote]]An impression of a digital advertisement has been served when it appears in a user's browser.[[/footnote]] is not infected, they will be retargeted by the anomaly for up to five days.  

**Retargeting timeline:** Retargeting events follow a predictable pattern, recorded below. Individuals who experience a complete retargeting event and successfully avoid infection may experience minor long-term ill effects,[[footnote]]These effects may include misanthropy, increased extraversion, and obsessive fixation on the works and activities of celebrities depicted in SCP-3214.[[/footnote]] but are not targeted by the anomaly again.

**Symptoms:** Once infected, SCP-3214-1 consumes the device on which they viewed SCP-3214. Whenever SCP-3214-1 is within one to two meters of another susceptible device, they will consume it as well, unless forcibly prevented from doing so. Each time such an additional device is consumed by SCP-3214-1, SCP-3214 impressions will be delivered to all susceptible devices in a 30 meter radius. This can result in the rapid and potentially exponential spread of SCP-3214. 

Consumption of electronic devices results in severe lacerations of the mouth, esophagus and digestive tract. Subjects injured in this way refuse to acknowledge distress and invariably describe their condition in positive terms.[[footnote]]Responses such as //"I'm fine", "no worries", "all good bro", "five by five"//, etc., are common.[[/footnote]] Unless prompt medical care is administered, SCP-3214-1 typically expire within one to three days, either as a direct result of their injuries or from related non-anomalous bacterial infection. The compulsion to eat devices has persisted in all known instances, though some subjects can learn to resist it over time.

**Video description:** Recordings of SCP-3214 show a blank screen with a circular "loading" image, and a sound similar to a dial-up modem connecting to the internet. Thus a more detailed description of SCP-3214 has been summarized from interviews with individuals infected by the anomaly. Although written descriptions of SCP-3214 have not demonstrated cognitohazardous properties, access is currently restricted as a precaution. Access is authorized for personnel of level 2 and above, researchers directly involved in SCP-3214 experimentation, and agents deployed in response to SCP-3214 outbreaks.

> # The narrator describes the viewer's history to a group of other characters seated in a casual setting, and will offer strong opinions on the relative talent or desirability of the viewer. Many of these other characters will resemble celebrities or other public figures known to the viewer.
> # The other characters will briefly debate whether the viewer possesses "the right stuff" or "star quality" and whether the group should "take [name] with us." All characters will then look at the camera, making eye contact with the viewer. Subjects report feeling compelled to view this portion, and felt they were being "measured" or "judged", even if they were unable to view the screen.

An estimated 20% of individuals infected by SCP-3214 outside of containment go missing. These individuals are designated SCP-3214-2. SCP-3214-2 do not exhibit any compulsion to consume electronic devices. Individuals infected while in containment have a lower probability of becoming SCP-3214-2 (approximately 5%).

Civilians who have observed SCP-3214-2 report that instances will immediately depart, offering vague and contradictory excuses when questioned. SCP-3214-2 who are prevented from departing will express dismay, citing an urgent appointment. They will refuse to specify the nature or location of this appointment. Each SCP-3214-2 instance will obtain a small quantity of luggage and fill it with various items of clothing and forms of personal entertainment.[[footnote]]Movies, books, mp3 players, handheld gaming devices, musical instruments and adult toys are commonly selected.[[/footnote]] SCP-3214-2 will either purchase or steal such items in an opportunistic manner. 

All SCP-3214-2 to date have vanished within 24 hours of release. Observation teams report a flash of green light at each disappearance, which is not visible in video recordings. --Tracking devices lose contact at this time.-- Tracking devices frequently lose contact at this time. Signals from tracking devices attached to some instances were later detected at the outer edge of the heliosphere, accelerating towards [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1958 Alpha Centauri A] at speeds which gradually increased to a maximum of .5c.
