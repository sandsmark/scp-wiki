DJ SCIP: Hi, I’m your host DJ Scip and you’re listening to Foundation After Midnight Radio, the only radio station broadcasting from within the Foundation during these sweet, sweet midnight hours.


DJ SCIP: I’m coming to you live from an undisclosed location, but regardless of whether it’s midnight where you are or not, I invite you to listen in for announcements, warnings, and important happenings, so let me be the first to say, “Welcome to the Foundation!”


DJ SCIP: It’s that time of year again when the Foundation hires on a bunch of new personnel! Not that it’s a set thing, but it always seems like every year there’s an influx of new recruits coming in. We here at 93.[REDACTED] FAM Radio wanted to make sure we properly welcomed you to our humble, world saving organization.


DJ SCIP: You might have been brought in because you were at the top of your class, the brightest in your field or, maybe, you saw something you weren’t supposed to. Something beyond explanation. You tried to bring attention to it but you were laughed out of good standing. Now, in disgrace, you have no choice but to work within our clandestine organization, protecting the poor unsuspecting masses, as well as the fools who mocked you.  Whatever your story, we’re happy to have you here.
To make sure you’re all up to speed we’re going to take this time to explain some essential bits of information about the Foundation. So let’s start with the big one: What is the Foundation?


DJ SCIP: The Foundation is an organization committed to housing the strange and unnatural by whatever means necessary. It’s a thankless job, but without us, society would crumble, the planet would fracture, reality would be undone, or worse.


DJ SCIP: Now, we have a recording from the Administrator that I heard when I first started here. Just got to blow the dust off the old tapes. 

*blows dust*


DJ SCIP: Haha, just kidding everything is digital now.


*plays "A Word From The Administrator" by TheVolgun*


TheVolgun: “Mankind in its present state has been around for a quarter of a million years, yet only the last 4,000 have been of any significance.


TheVolgun: So, what did we do for nearly 250,000 years? We huddled in caves and around small fires, fearful of the things that we didn't understand. It was more than explaining why the sun came up, it was the mystery of enormous birds with heads of men and rocks that came to life. So we called them 'gods' and 'demons', begged them to spare us, and prayed for salvation.


TheVolgun: In time, their numbers dwindled and ours rose. The world began to make more sense when there were fewer things to fear, yet the unexplained can never truly go away, as if the universe demands the absurd and impossible.


TheVolgun: Mankind must not go back to hiding in fear. No one else will protect us, and we must stand up for ourselves.


TheVolgun: While the rest of mankind dwells in the light, we must stand in the darkness to fight it, contain it, and shield it from the eyes of the public, so that others may live in a sane and normal world.


TheVolgun: We secure. We contain. We protect.”


DJ SCIP: Couldn’t have said it better myself.


DJ SCIP: Secure. Contain. Protect. That’s our simple motto. We secure the anomalous and remove them for the general population for everyone’s safety. We contain them to minimize their effects on the outside world or sometimes the outside world’s effect on them. And we protect the world from the harmful effects of the entities within our walls even at the cost of our own lives.


DJ SCIP: We are the last bastion of security in a world where natural laws rapidly break down. We are here to protect humanity from the things that go bump in the night, from people who wield power beyond mortal understanding. We are here to make the world a safer place. We are the holders of wonders, and the caretakers of dreams. We are why the world continues.


DJ SCIP: We hide things that would throw physics on its head, monstrosities that would kill every living thing. We also hold amazing constructs and entities that could just as easily elevate our very existence as they could fry our minds.


DJ SCIP: These are often referred to as ‘S’ ‘C’ ‘P’, followed by an identifying number, but also sometimes called ‘skips’ for short. SCP stands for “Special Containment Procedures” and refers to how an anomalous entity is kept within the Foundation. In order to contain each SCP, special containment procedures make up a list of necessary materials and protocols that must be followed to properly keep it safely tucked away. They are generally classified as ‘Safe’ if they can be locked away without issue, ‘Euclid’ if they need to be more actively monitored and secured, and ‘Keter’ if they present threat even in containment and require the utmost security and surveillance to keep them contained.


DJ SCIP: An SCP might be a person, an animal, an item, a place, even something an occurrence with unnatural, abnormal, paranormal properties and abilities. Things that defy what we know about the universe. They are then numbered for cataloguing purposes and found in all corners of the globe. They are as strange as they are numerous, with some even found beyond our planet, our universe, or our known dimension!


DJ SCIP: You’ll learn some are more well known to personnel while others are much more obscure, rarely referenced at all.  Keep in mind that they are to be treated equally, which is typically neutrally, regardless of what they are or what we know of them. Getting too close to an entity or even loathing one can negatively affect your ability to make rational decisions regarding their containment and the protection of those around you.


DJ SCIP: These horrors and oddities are held at a number of sites and facilities hidden throughout the world, and are secured, researched, and locked away, by just as many people who work in secret, unknown to the outside world.


DJ SCIP: If the Foundation were a body, its bones would be concrete and metal cells. The organs are the deadly shadow people, living cars, hellish nightmares and cheaply made children’s toys, they must be kept inside the body. The personnel would be the skin, and muscles, and life blood. The squishy yet important bits.  From the guardian security forces, to the noble researchers, we the people, are the Foundation.


DJ SCIP: Researchers lead in the understanding of anomalies, testing their strengths and weakness, lighting the way for better containment procedures and safer handling of skips.


DJ SCIP: Security teams are our first line of defense, protecting from dangers within, as well as without, the facilities they patrol.


DJ SCIP: Mobile Task Forces are our sword, reaching out and cutting down dangerous entities and bringing them in for the world’s safety.


DJ SCIP: Dealing with anomalous beings is very dangerous and while we have the latest technology, sometimes you need a human set of hands, eyes, and ears. Often literally cause some of these will only respond to human matter.


DJ SCIP: This is where D-Class personnel come in. Though not here of their own free will, they serve an important role just as well. Usually death row inmates, these men and women are repaying their debt to society by giving their lives to the progression of science! They may be human guinea pigs, but damn it they are our human guinea pigs and they help us to keep the dark at bay one way or another!


DJ SCIP: Lastly, I’m to mention that all personnel, including you newbies, are welcome to join the inter-site intramural softball league! This season starts off soon, so teams are filling up! Will you be on the Site-19’s Staring Statues, the Site-REDACTED’s Unkillable Lizards, or the Site-103’s Landmine Cacti? Hope to see you on field!


DJ SCIP: Now for some FAQ for everyone listening in tonight. I’ve got an old recording from an orientation I did a while back.


DJ SCIP: Since we don’t have a chance for questions later, we’re going to tackle a few frequently asked questions instead.


DJ SCIP: 1. Is the Foundation evil?


DJ SCIP: While we may be using human test subjects, hoarding away a pill that can cure cancer, and possess several never ending supplies of food like a pizza box that will always have a full pie with your favorite toppings on it every time you open the box that could potentially bring about the end of world hunger but instead use it for lowering the food budget.


DJ SCIP: No, the Foundation has no plans to take over, destroy, or change the world. If anything, we want the world to go about doing exactly what it’s doing. Let humanity run its course without being disturbed by the disturbing entities within our walls


DJ SCIP: 2. How many SCPs are there?


DJ SCIP: The exact number is hard to say. There are new SCPs being discovered all the time as well as those only recently being released for certain clearance levels, but currently there are over 2,000 documented SCPs in containment.


DJ SCIP: 3. Why don’t we just kill SCPs?


DJ SCIP: Because it’s not that simple. Some of these can’t be killed, some of them might even become worse, but often it's simply because we’ve been told not to.  We Protect our faculty as well as the entities we house. It’s also harder to learn from a corpse.


DJ SCIP: 4. Are the D-Class Personnel really all death row criminals? Because there seem to be a lot of them and this one guys said he WASN’T a criminal and that he’s got a family back home and blah blah blah.

DJ SCIP: If you hear something like this then you’ve encountered a tricky D-Class personnel and should report them to the Department of Resources, coma, Human so it can be marked on their profile. All D-Class personnel have thoroughly categorized psychiatric profiles, and they will be reassigned properly.


DJ SCIP: 5. Does anyone else know about The Foundation?


DJ SCIP: We don’t talk about them much as it will typically not be in your department, but we want you up to speed. Yes, there are other organizations who know about us and what we do here, and most of them have their own ideas and agendas when it comes to dealing with anomalous objects.


DJ SCIP: Marshall, Carter and Dark Ltd, who sell and trade anomalous objects for profit, the Global Occult Coalition, who seeks to destroy anomalous objects, the Chaos Insurgency, a splinter group broken off from the Foundation, are just a few worth noting. 


DJ SCIP: Beyond that we exist and operate in secrecy to all except for high ranking civilian government officials.


DJ SCIP: Now, while not required viewing material, some media that I may recommend to new personnel would include, “Cabin in the Woods”, “John Dies At The End”, and “Torchwood”, to name a few. A complete list of my personal recommendations can be found on my blog! 


DJ SCIP: Next up! We have a recording that properly covers the full mission statement and operations of the Foundation here. Please enjoy!


*Plays "We Are S.C.P." by SCPReadings*


SCPReadings: Operating clandestine and worldwide, the Foundation operates beyond jurisdiction, empowered and entrusted by every major national government with the task of containing anomalous objects, entities, and phenomena. These anomalies pose a significant threat to global security by threatening either physical or psychological harm.


SCPReadings: The Foundation operates to maintain normalcy, so that the worldwide civilian population can live and go on with their daily lives without fear, mistrust, or doubt in their personal beliefs, and to maintain human independence from extraterrestrial, extradimensional, and other extranormal influence.


SCPReadings:  Our mission is three-fold:


SCPReadings: Secure


SCPReadings: The Foundation secures anomalies with the goal of preventing them from falling into the hands of civilian or rival agencies, through extensive observation and surveillance and by acting to intercept such anomalies at the earliest opportunity.


SCPReadings: Contain


SCPReadings: The Foundation contains anomalies with the goal of preventing their influence or effects from spreading, by either relocating, concealing, or dismantling such anomalies or by suppressing or preventing public dissemination of knowledge thereof.
Protect


SCPReadings: The Foundation protects humanity from the effects of such anomalies as well as the anomalies themselves until such time that they are either fully understood or new theories of science can be devised based on their properties and behavior. The Foundation may also neutralize or destroy anomalies as an option of last resort, if they are determined to be too dangerous to be contained.


SCPReadings: Foundation Operations


SCPReadings: Foundation covert and clandestine operations are undertaken across the globe in pursuit of our primary missions.


SCPReadings: Special Containment Procedures


SCPReadings: The Foundation maintains an extensive database of information regarding anomalies requiring Special Containment Procedures, commonly referred to as "SCPs". The primary Foundation database contains summaries of such anomalies and emergency procedures for maintaining or re-establishing safe containment in the case of a containment breach or other event.


SCPReadings: Anomalies may take many forms, be it an object, an entity, a location, or a free-standing phenomenon. These anomalies are categorized into one of several Object Classes and are either contained at one of the Foundation's myriad Secure Facilities or contained on-site if relocation is deemed unfeasible.


SCPReadings: Operational Security


SCPReadings: The Foundation operates with the utmost secrecy. All Foundation personnel must observe the Security Clearance Levels as well as need-to-know and compartmentalization of information. Personnel found in violation of Foundation security protocols will be identified, detained, and subject to disciplinary action.


SCPReadings: Rival Agencies and Groups of Interest


SCPReadings: The Foundation is not the only organization with knowledge of and capability to interact with or utilize anomalies. While some of these Groups of Interest have similar goals and may cooperate with us on issues of global security, many more are opportunistic and profit-oriented, seeking to adapt or use anomalies to their own ends. Foundation personnel are instructed to treat individuals from such groups with suspicion at all times, and collaboration with such groups without the explicit prior consent of Foundation leadership will be cause for termination or other disciplinary action.”


DJ SCIP: Well that is a lot of material to take in, so we’re going to take a break for now.


DJ SCIP: If you have any additional questions, you are always welcome to call me here at the Foundation After Midnight Radio hotline by dialing (512) 937-2346, that’s (512) 93-RADIO and leave a voicemail!


DJ SCIP: If we like your question and answer it on the air, you could be our lucky winner and receive a level 4 clearance badge! Granting you clearance access to information deemed restricted and top secret!


DJ SCIP: Coffee and snacks are available in your site’s lobby, which are down the hall to the left of bathrooms, but don’t go to the right! How do I know this with so many sites around the globe? Why, I’m your friendly late night Foundation radio host, it’s my job to keep up with everything going on behind the scenes within our behind the scenes organization.


DJ SCIP: Welcome to the Foundation family. It only gets stranger from here. But in a good way. Except for containment breaches. Those are when an anomalous entity has breached its containment. Those are strange in a very bad way.


DJ SCIP: And on that note, goodnight.

**Toadking07 backstage notes:**


This episode was retroactively added after Ep 05 as "00" when looking back I realized that Ep 01 dove head first into the SCP Foundation universe without pause. This is fine for SCP fans but basically a brick wall for any newbies or listeners unfamiliar with the Foundation. Things such as D-Class or what a SCP-682 is are completely lost and baffling without at least knowing the "canon" of the SCP wiki.


Tried to clear up some terms and give a good starting point for those just getting introduced to the Foundation to listen in at. Creating content that doesn't require a ton of SCP numbers being memorized and that ultimately would help bring new fans to the SCP community is a goal of mine. FAM Radio is still for the Foundation, by the Foundation, but with efforts to make it more listener friendly moving forward.


A note on these notes: More behind the scenes info will be posted here by me, toadking07, giving a little insight for interested readers as to what we were thinking, what we're planning, and any other interesting bits of info I think to share.

DJ SCIP: Welcome to Foundation After Midnight, the free Foundation radio show broadcasting globally, transcending site boundaries and clearance levels to bring you all the latest news and happenings here within the Foundation.


DJ SCIP: Not midnight where you’re at? Well it’s midnight somewhere, and that’s where we’re broadcasting from!


DJ SCIP: A quick shout out to all of my researchers, security guards, D-class personnel, agents and the rest of you working the late night to early day shifts within the only organization that keeps our humble planet spinning properly.


DJ SCIP: I’m your host, DJ Scip, you’re listening to 93.[REDACTED] FAM radio and this is a memetic kill agent to weed out those who don’t have the proper clearance level to access this channel.


*INTRO PLAYS*


DJ SCIP: Still with us? Good!


DJ SCIP: In recent news, the “Days since last containment breach” counter has once again been reset.


DJ SCIP: Don’t worry folks, we’ll get to those double digits one day!


DJ SCIP: This just goes to reinforce what I always say! “Don’t run with scips!”
The groundbreaking ceremony for the new Temporal Anomaly Research Development and Integration Station will commence tomorrow. The center will aid in the understanding and utilizing of time and space based anomalies and paradoxes.


DJ SCIP: Construction is expected to be completed last year.


DJ SCIP: Once again, The Overseers wish to remind all, that Site-78 does not, nor has it ever existed. Ever. There is no Site-78. Anyone who says otherwise is a liar and should be reported to their appropriate department head.


DJ SCIP: We have a big announcement here. I am excited to inform you all of the successful first launch of the Foundation Space Program. As I may remind you, this was a new direction for the Foundation, who has in the past maintained that “Secure, Contain, Protect” is the way to handle anomalous subjects. The discussion on the topic over the years finally reached a boiling point at last year’s meeting when O5-8 declared… hold on, let me get the direct quote here. “Fuck it. Go ahead, we just don’t care enough anymore. Launch ‘em all into the bleeding sun. We give up on containing this mess!”


DJ SCIP: The first of many scips sent out into space last week have just passed the planet mercury and within the next 5 minutes, will reach their scheduled final destination. Our sun!


DJ SCIP: As voted upon unanimously by the administrators, the first launched was SCP-682, aka “The Unkillable Lizard.” Researchers believe with the cold of space, then extreme heat and immense gravity of our sun, we will finally finish off the foul beast.


DJ SCIP: Those of us down here who lost someone we knew to the damn gecko, we just wanted to offer a special goodbye; “Say Hi to the sun! Don’t forget to write! We hope it hurts, ya scaly sonovabitch!”


DJ SCIP: Listeners can let us know which scip they’d like to have launched into the sun via the Foundation Space Program by giving us a call at, 512-937-2346.


DJ SCIP: Researchers are reminded that just because they consider their assigned subject to be quote,  “cliched,” “boring” or “over-done” they are not  to leave their post for any reason. Also, venturing off-facility during research hours is not permitted.


DJ SCIP: Even if it’s just to run to that smoothie place at the strip mall. More so if said persons did not bring back smoothies for the rest of the department staff!
A quick note to female personnel new to the site, if a dog enters the women showers and/or locker room, simply steal his glasses.


DJ SCIP: He’s not allowed in there and he should know better.


DJ SCIP: A potential anomalous subject siting has been called in.  Apparently a very well known and jolly holiday entity may or may not now be flying around the Northern Hemisphere due to a young  reality ben- um, due to a certain young “bixbie.”


DJ SCIP: Researchers assigned to the individual ask that staff please reference the approved fairy tales and children stories before conversing with bixbies in containment.


DJ SCIP: Mobile Task Force “Little Helpers” have been assigned to track down the big red fella. Good luck out there boys, stay frosty.


DJ SCIP: We are receiving an update from the Space Program: Alright, we have confirmation that first transport will be making contact with the sun’s surface in T-minus…


DJ SCIP: 4… 3… 2… 1… TOUCHDOWN!


DJ SCIP: The first scip has made contact with the sun! The next few transports are scheduled to make contact at varying times this afternoon. With them they will be carrying a number of euclid and keter class artifacts that will never again plague humanity!


DJ SCIP: Please note that a number of solar flares are expected for this afternoon resulting from the launches and you should not be alarmed if our signal is disrupted temporarily throughout today’s broadcast.


DJ SCIP: This truly is a great day in history.


DJ SCIP: And now, here is Ajoura on 93.[REDACTED], and their track “The SCP Foundation Main Theme”


*SONG PLAYS*


DJ SCIP: And we’re back.


DJ SCIP: Now for our small, and infrequent, but nonetheless beloved, sports corner we have an update on the intramural softball league. Site-[REDACTED]’s Unkillable Lizards are facing off against the Site-19 Staring Statues this weekend.


DJ SCIP: After their close game that went into overtime with Area-02’s Toasters, fans are wondering if the Unkillable Lizards will prove to be as unstoppable as their name suggests.


*STATIC*


DJ SCIP: To whoever has repeatedly put up flyers about an official Foundation “Bring your daughter to work,” day, please stop.


DJ SCIP: All personnel are advised that such an event would never be scheduled and anyone telling you otherwise is misinformed and encouraging unsafe workplace activities. As such, they should be reported immediately.


DJ SCIP: Shenanigans like this can only end in disaster.


DJ SCIP: An update on the status of SCP-682- *static* -871 and the other anomalous objects launched into the sun.


DJ SCIP: Our instruments are reading it is still alive somehow. Uh, I mean, we knew that bastard wouldn’t go down easy… Let’s see here…


DJ SCIP: “After contact with the sun… reached temperatures of...yada yada yada…Ah, here, It appears the subject had been adapting to the heat of the G-class star known as Sol well before reaching its surface…”


DJ SCIP: “It broke free from it’s transport, and while it was unable to escape the gravitational pull, it was able to adapt to living in the vacuum of space…”


DJ SCIP: Thankfully it was unable to interfere with any of the other transports before they reached their projected destination.


DJ SCIP: We are also getting reports that a ticking sound can be heard when viewers look directly into the sun. Those exposed to the phenomena claim that  it sounds like the ticking is counting down to something and fills them with a horrible sensation of dread. Exposure to the sun should be avoided at all costs until this anomalous activity has been properly understood and contained.


DJ SCIP: Man, from the way these are coming in, it’s a good things we didn’t launch that miniature black hole like originally planned… or the sun parasite...


*STATIC*


SCP-682: ..they think they are in CONTROL...


*STATIC*

**Toadking07 backstage notes:**


This was the first episode of FAM Radio to ever be written and uploaded and my first venture into podcasting. I had only recently starting listening to podcasts, namely ones my friends did and of course Welcome to Night Vale, of which this series is greatly inspired from. Having been reading the SCP Wiki for almost a year, it was very clear to me that format would mix nicely with the ever strange and unusual announcements one could write for the Foundation.


I wanted a logo for the podcast that would let people know this was an SCP podcast but also could be recognized as specifically FAM Radio if it ever showed up on its own. The arrows on the SCP logo were flipped out to represent that the broadcast was going out, coming from within the Foundation, and three "radio waves" were added to the outside to try to give it an audio-esque look. Hence the logo that's you've seen over the years before it being updated in 2017.

DJ SCIP: Welcome to Foundation After Midnight, the free Foundation radio show broadcasting around the world and into space! That’s right, we know you can hear us up there! Anyway, we’re bending time and space and clearance levels to bring you all the newest updates from around the Foundation.


DJ SCIP: Not midnight where you’re at? Well it’s kind of hard to tell if it’s day or night with all the anomalous activities going on with the sun lately, but it’s definitely midnight here!


DJ SCIP: I’m your host, DJ Scip, you’re listening to 93.[REDACTED] FAM radio and this is a memetic mind wiping agent to weed out anyone who doesn’t have the proper clearance levels to access this channel.

*INTRO PLAYS*


DJ SCIP: Can you still remember your name? Glad to hear it!


DJ SCIP: To start things off, we’d like to remind everyone that since protocol Svalinn, global quarantine is in effect, all nonessential resources and personnel are being reassigned to site teams. Teams will be focusing on the various ongoing sun-related cataclysms threatening the world and how to best to solve them.


DJ SCIP: In an effort to raise morale within the Foundation, higher ups have been allowing groups to choose their own team names. 


DJ SCIP: So far Team Mechanical Masterminds of Math has had the most promising brainstorming, having the most concepts to be confiscated and classified by higher ups out of any group so far.


DJ SCIP: Reports have come in from the Foundation Space Program about a new satellite mass that has appeared just beyond the Earth’s moon. It seems during the space program’s launchings last week that the shuttle that was transporting two hundred and thirty seven self-replicating keter class cakes, exploded on its way to the sun.


DJ SCIP: So we have bad news and good news. The bad news is that it’s been growing at an exponential rate, nearly doubling in size every day. The good news is this broadcast is coming in clearer as the cakes have been absorbing the increasing solar flare activity. 


DJ SCIP: Via Team Golden Comet’s proposal, a unique crew has been sent to the surface to investigate, comprised of D-Class personnel who have exhibited exceptional skill and cooperation in the past in the consumption of cakes. They have been tasked with exploring options in stemming its growth, and have been fittingly dubbed, Team Death By Chocolate.


DJ SCIP: Well I can’t say I envy the D-Class personnel, but that does sound delicious...


DJ SCIP: An update on the whereabouts of the damned hard-to-kill reptile. With its newly formed “solar wings,” its current course will have it passing Venus in the next few minutes, likely continuing its trajectory towards Earth. Guess the scaly fucker really wants to come home...


DJ SCIP: If anyone has any suggestions on how to secure and contain the space lizard, your team has about one week to submit your ideas. At this point, everything barring, “Throwing it back into the sun.” will be accepted and considered. 


DJ SCIP: Good try Team “Knights who say Nickel.”
While construction for the Temporal Anomaly Research Development and Integration Station has only been underway for a week, exciting new reports have already come in from the station!


DJ SCIP: Unfortunately no researchers have been assigned to the station yet, so the reports are being investigated for authenticity and will not be released to the Foundation public at this time. 


DJ SCIP: This just handed to me, all site personnel are to be on high alert! A suspicious person of interest may or may not be wandering around the facilities. The person in question may be disguised as a member of staff, or as anomalous entity, or maybe as a... cat?


DJ SCIP: So far, no one has been able to record the individual or produce any evidence of their encounter with it, and everyone who claims to have seen the suspicious person seems to have trouble recalling anything about it at all.


DJ SCIP: So if you see someone wandering around that you do not recognize or have trouble remembering, or can’t remember, or they are a cat, or all of those things, please keep a visual on them and try your best to report it as soon as possible.


DJ SCIP: Further updates will be announced as details come in... though don’t hold your breath. 


DJ SCIP: As you all know, or may not know, I am a lover, and supporter, of the arts. With that, the I.T. Department would like me to remind you that DVD copies of the test recordings from SCP-630 are still available for $50 a pop. 


DJ SCIP: Yes that is right, you can now personally own a recording of the spontaneous, and often hilarious,  song-and-dance routines and musical performances acted out by various members of personnel, including such favorites as: Agent Lament!


*LAMENT AUDIO PLAYS*


DJ SCIP: Prof. Bjornsen!


*BJORNSEN AUDIO PLAYS*


DJ SCIP: And Scruffy the janitor!


*SCRUFFY'S AUDIO PLAYS*


DJ SCIP: Just talk to any member of the department or send an email to the usual IT help contact. New videos available every month. Cash or money orders only.


*DJ SCIP HUMMING SCRUFFY'S SONG*


*CLEARS THROAT*


DJ SCIP: It seems tempers reached a boiling point when a food fight got out of hand in the staff lounge yesterday after a research member, whose name has not been disclosed, kicked SCP-294 for dispensing coffee that he claimed was “too cold.”


DJ SCIP: When the researcher ordered another cup with a request for “hotter coffee” 294 proceeded to rapidly dispense hot coffee, in what many witnesses described as an “agitated” manner, splattering the surrounding area.


DJ SCIP: While the offending researcher was able to avoid the coffee spray, a nearby personnel was caught in the crossfire and mistook the action as some sort of a prank. Apparently in response to the imagined insult, they proceeded to throw their own drink into the face of the first researcher. From there the two began to order liquids from the vending machine, and throw them at one another. Drinks, and we’re using that word lightly mind you, recorded during this exchange included but were not limited to: 


DJ SCIP: “Cola Soda,” “Soy Milk,” “Everclear,” “Skunk musk,” “Gasoline,” “Dog Feces,” and “A yet, unidentified grey fluid that when exposed to skin causes yellow boils to appear,”  Though I’m sure much more colorful language was used at the time.


DJ SCIP: All personnel involved were taken to medical and reprimanded accordingly. From now on, three guards of security clearance level 3 will be assigned to monitor the vending machine at all times.


DJ SCIP: We’d like to take a moment and remind all our listeners that when facing...


*STATIC, AN IMAGE IS DISPLAYED*


DJ SCIP: ...or else risk melting the face of every person in the vicinity. Thankfully, we all know better now.


DJ SCIP: If you have access to outside media, you may have heard some of the cover stories for the unforeseen consequences of the Foundation Space Program.  We wanted to take this time to clear up some of these “facts” that have been planted by the Department of Disinformation;


DJ SCIP: For starters, while we do advise you avoid exposure to the sun, it will not give you “sudden cancer” or “extreme cases of blindness.” All the doctors in those commercials are paid by the Foundation.


DJ SCIP: Also, though anxiety and depression are on the rise, the cause is from direct exposure to the sun or the sequential lack of natural light from avoiding the sun, not from any  financial recession, nuclear weapon tension, or the systematic deconstruction of our social communities. These are fabrications by the Office of Misdirection. Good job guys, almost had me going on those ones!


DJ SCIP: And lastly, it should be known that no asteroid has collided with Mercury and the planet has not fractured. The random eclipses that we’ve been experiencing have been from anomalous activity involving the sun, not chunks of planetary debris. For the time being, all faculty engaging with the general public should maintain that Mercury is to be removed from modern star charts.


DJ SCIP: Between all the craziness with the sun, we still have news from our infrequent sports corner! The softball league games have continued as scheduled and in an upsetting turn of events this last weekend, Site-[REDACTED]’s Unkillable Lizards lost to Site-19’s Staring Statues, with a score of 11 - 15.


DJ SCIP: Site-[REDACTED]’s fans were livid, or would have been if it weren’t for the evacuation of the stadium due to another intense wave of sun flares lovingly sent to us by SCP-682. I think that Site-[REDACTED] will likely be considering a new name and mascot as there really is not much love left for that damn lizard since its return trip from the sun as some celestial solar serpent. It seems the sun only made it madder and it’s definitely bringing the heat...unlike the softball team...


DJ SCIP: This week, Site-19’s Staring Statues will face off against Site-103’s Critical Tomatoes, who I may remind you, have been leading in the brackets. Can the Staring Statues ketchup with the Critical Tomatoes? We’ll see..


DJ SCIP: All personnel are reminded that when filing reports, please be specific and carefully clarify your intentions when using the word “terminate”  in reference to disciplinary action. Please define whether you mean “to end the employment of” or “to end the life of” said person.


DJ SCIP: The HR Department would  like to point out that death as a means of punishment is inhumane and unreasonable.


DJ SCIP: The HR Department would also like to go on record that on occasion, death really is the only viable solution, but that is for them to decide, not you.


DJ SCIP: A new plan to solve at least one of our sun related disasters has been proposed by a collaboration between Team Batman Signal and Team Korea's Got Seoul. Though the risk of cross scip contamination is always present, it’s not like we have much to lose at this point.

DJ SCIP: In order to lessen the anomalous effects from exposure to the sun, the teams have devised a method of worldwide overcast, focusing SCP-938 through SCP-1149. While limited on their own, the plan suggests that when combined, the two may-


DJ SCIP: ...


DJ SCIP: And then the sun went out.

**Toadking07 backstage notes:**


Continuing the podcast with the next episode, the script was being made up as we went. Roughly we knew the overarching trajectory but it wasn't a tight timeline. I was playing more and more with ways to distort the audio and video to give a sign of distress and interference with the signal. Might have gotten a bit carried away as editing that became a lot of extra work that most of our fans would never even see!


Then of course there's always the issue of how do you get across that things are going wrong when they are happening off screen or millions of miles away. Really wanted to keep things moving so liberties were taking with the timing of announcements and what was discussed on air.

00:00
DJ SCIP: Welcome to Foundation After Midnight, the free, though thoroughly encrypted, Foundation radio show broadcasting to all the still secure facilities around the globe!  We’re bending time and space and clearance levels to bring you all the newest updates from around the Foundation.


DJ SCIP: Has it been dark where you’re at for over 48 hours? Have no fear, it’s for sure midnight here in our emergency bunker!  Even if it is several miles underground...below sea level...


DJ SCIP: I’m your host, DJ Scip, you’re listening to 93.[REDACTED] FAM radio and I’m...I’m not really sure it’s worth playing the memetic sound agent as there aren’t that many of us left and well, proper clearance level be damned.


DJ SCIP: Well, ah, anyways, just to fill the space, in memory of the late Professor Bjornsen, here is his 630 production.


*BJORNSEN'S AUDIO PLAYS*


DJ SCIP: Such a catchy song. Hope it doesn’t get stuck in your head all day! Though if it did, it might be more pleasant than that dreaded ticking noise that many have been reporting in about.


DJ SCIP: At the Top of the List of Important News Today; Head Foundation Space Program Researchers have announced that all personnel should move to the lower levels of their assigned sites and enter the provided XK-level super structures. 


DJ SCIP: Upon evacuating your site, please be sure to turn off all lights, empty out break room fridges, lock down all cells, and terminate all unassigned D-Class personnel.


DJ SCIP: There are registered Z5 flares, en masse, as the last goodbye from our yellow sun, heading towards the planet at record speeds. A countdown clock has started at...11:00 minutes. You all have 11 minutes before waves of picometre X-rays splash over the earth, more than 10 times that of the great solar storm of 1859!


DJ SCIP: We will continue as normal from here for as long as possible so please stay tuned as you evacuate to your shelters folks.


DJ SCIP: And now we will take a moment and remember all of those brave men and women who have passed away in the line of duty this week. They gave the ultimate sacrifice for the Foundation and for humanity, and for that, we thank them.


LYRAHEL: The following are the names of Foundation personnel we lost to recent events. These brave men and women, gave their lives, sometimes repeatedly, for the preservation of humankind and the world as we know it. They are remembered here, as best we can, in no particular order:


LYRAHEL: Director Alicia Winters, Dr. Athena Grey, Sub-director Idoia Azaki, Researcher Lucy Chang
Dr. Todd King, Samuel Brow, Asst. Director Harold Schwartz, Dr. West Roth, Agent Elliot McNamara, Phil Kowalski.


*RECORDING SPED UP*


LYRAHEL: Dr. Joaquin Abasolo, Edward Hitchington, Dr. Ferdinand Xanders, Researcher Sarah Lopez.


*RECORDING SPED UP*


LYRAHEL: Agent Naomi Rhodes, Comm. Officer Annette B. Williams, Agent Jaryn Mode, Dr. Pleasance Lutwidge.


*RECORDING SPED UP*


LYRAHEL: Security Chief Dwight Strahan, Prof. Anders Bjornsen, Dr. Wesley Johnston, Nurse Tyler Faber.


*RECORDING SPED UP*


LYRAHEL: Jr. Researchers Chris Pinkus, Ryan Pinkus, and Scott Pinkus, Dr. Adam F. Rutherford
Dr. Adam R. Rutherford, Francis Hodge.


*RECORDING SPED UP*


LYRAHEL: Prof. Astrid, Jane McCallister, Dr. James Cantwell, Intern Patel Falls, Dr. Rosalene
Asst. Researcher Dr. Lyons, Containment Specialist Thomson, Dr. Trex, Intern Lucinda Witterstrand, Security Personnel Gordan Nunez, Site Director Roger Hopkins, Agent Michael Chard-


*NAMES BECOME INCOMPREHENSIBLE*


DJ SCIP: Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we had to speed things up a bit during that as we read off the names. Uh, our utmost apologies about that.


DJ SCIP: A recent change in policy has surviving staff grumbling. Administration has declared they will no longer be accepting containment procedures written in over 60% blood.


DJ SCIP: “We are doing this for the health and safety of the Administration Department and its personnel.” a representative stated.


DJ SCIP: No word on if field notes covered in blood, but still legible, will still be allowed or not. 
Now, we would like to remind personnel you should check for rations in your bunker before resorting to cannibalism. Most sites are equipped to last a full year or more of total isolation from the outside world.


DJ SCIP: However, if you do end up resorting to cannibalism, please refer to your ‘Cannibalism And You’ kit. Also, be sure to use the provided microwaves before starting fires using discarded remnants of civilized society. The open flames will set off the smoke detectors and bunker fire alarms and I don’t think I need to remind anyone how loud those can be.


DJ SCIP: Please respect those in your neighboring bunkers and keep your shouting and chanting to a reasonable noise level.


DJ SCIP: A bit of information my Foundation provided psychologist allowed me to share, SCP-990 appeared to me in a dream last night. Our talk was short but the mysterious man and I discussed the current events going on in the real world. To most of my questions he simply responded with exasperated sighs and “I told them!” or “I tried to warn you all, but NOOOO!” or, on occasion, “Called it!”


DJ SCIP: He then told me goodbye and good luck and that this would be his last time he’d be visiting us at the Foundation. When I asked him what he meant by that, he said it didn’t really matter. When I asked him what that meant, he laughed and said something about always asking questions but always being afraid of the answers. Or something. The details are fuzzy.


DJ SCIP: I then tried to ask him to at least tell us who he really was in the real world, but I couldn’t hear him over a growing roar that turned out to be my alarm going off next to my bed. I immediately jumped out of bed and tried to write down as much of the dream as I could so I could share it all with the remaining personnel listening to FAM Radio.


DJ SCIP: It’s not much, but I guess it’s as good a goodbye as we’re likely to get from him. I guess if he’s out there, in the real world, in one form or another, thank you for watching out for us. Sorry if we never really listened, or figured things out in time.


DJ SCIP: And now it's time for music by Foundation Personnel! We try to feature our favorite melodies composed by our very own within the Foundation! This week, it's, well, had a bit of a shortage of personnel free to make music, so this week’s featured music comes from a D-Class personnel named Lyrahel.


DJ SCIP: You’re listening to FAM Radio on 93.[REDACTED] and this is, “The End Is Nigh”


*SONG PLAYS*

DJ SCIP: Oh, it’s over, ahem...Remember, if you would like your song featured on our show, email us at SCP93.FAMRadio@gmail.com. And now, back to the news.


DJ SCIP: Next we would...


*ALARM BOT STARTS TO SOUND IN THE BOOTH*


ALARM BOT: WARNING! WARNING!


DJ SCIP: Next- Next we- NEXT WE WOULD- One second..


ALARM BOT: WARNING! WARNING!


*SMASHING CAN BE HEARD. ALARM BOT DIES AND STOPS*


ALARM BOT: Waaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrnnnnnnniiiiiiiinnnnngggggg....


DJ SCIP: There we go. As I was saying.. uh, what was I saying again?


DJ SCIP: Ah, well, here we go, here’s something! We’ve had a number of Researchers call in asking about updates on scips that were launched into the sun back when the Foundation Space Program sounded like a good idea..


DJ SCIP: Normally that information would be classified, or at least, uh, not publically released within the Foundation, but since things are kind of pretty much shot to- well, since it looks like everything is going out the window, let’s see what some of our old friends are up to!


DJ SCIP: The most popular scips were 173 and 096, both of which we are happy to inform you successfully went into the sun without a hitch. Or well, relatively speaking, without a hitch.


DJ SCIP: 096 is either dead or forever hidden behind the intense light of the sun according to our top  theorists.


DJ SCIP: 173, when hurled at the sun, whose surface heat I may remind you keeps metal in a gaseous form, dissolved. Seems the killer rock, unlike the softball team with its namesake, could not withstand the heat.


DJ SCIP: Speaking of Hotline call-ins, I see we have a message! Glad to see at least some site out there is still active and receiving us!


DJ SCIP: Usually one of my assistants takes those, but since the site wide evacuation and lockdown, it’s just me and the answering machine today. Let see who called us...


*RADIO HOTLINE CALL ABOUT RADIO BLEEDING PLAYS*


DJ SCIP: Oh, uh, well, we don’t usually take maintenance calls but we’ll see about sending someone down for that.


DJ SCIP: Remember, you can always call in to our radio Hotline at (512) 937-2346. That’s uh, (512) 937-2346, where you can leave us a message and we’ll see if we can get back to you. Maybe.
Hmm, now what? Umm, well, let’s see here..


*SORTS THROUGH PAPERS*


DJ SCIP: Ah ha! Here’s some Foundation poetry! From actual personnel! Let’s give this a read!


DJ SCIP: Ahem, “XK” by Very Real Researcher Ruiz “You Need To Secure Your Database You Idiots” Duchamp.


DJ SCIP: We took the damned thing. And wiped the blood and shit and piss and tears from its face. Nothing was beneath.


DJ SCIP: Light shone through the cracks. Reality itself bent to the wills of madmen. Only words remain.


DJ SCIP: Sliced through severed stones. Redundancies enough to keep back a hidden king. Trees in the forest.


DJ SCIP: Deep uncertainty. Undirected hatred fear and loathing shapes it all. And remains unshaped.


DJ SCIP: Fresh porphyria. Dry and wet and old and new and everything between. Solemnly inept.


DJ SCIP: A few swift stabbings. Ten thousand steel doors broken down to scraps of concepts. Moderately gnawed.


DJ SCIP: Knowledge lies in parts. Puzzles upon ciphers upon riddles open doors. Revolving in place.


DJ SCIP: Eternity now. All clocks and time compressed to an instant variance. Cannot change again.


DJ SCIP: WARNING PERSONNEL. PENDING XK CLASS END OF THE WORLD SCENARIO. THANK YOU AND FAREWELL.


DJ SCIP: Oh my, umm, that was, not nearly as cheerful as I was expecting. But uhh, good on them for, uh, expressing themselves with such, words.


DJ SCIP: Unfortunately it seems the Foundation Space Program has failed completely. Most, if not all of the scips we launched into the sun have continued their anomalous effects or have mutated into even greater threats.


DJ SCIP: The official word has just come down, the Temporal Anomaly Research Defense and Integration Station has been activated. A chain reaction has begun, set in motion by the O5 council members, that will launch us through time and space back to a point before the Foundation Space Program was put into effect.


DJ SCIP: All personnel are to stand by as we complete the reality wide jump. You may experience some discomfort or nausea from the dimension shift, so be advised. We also suggest turning off all cellular devices and electronics as they may interfere with the jump. It is suggested that you try to write down as much as possible during this time, using whatever material you have, on whatever surfaces you can. We do not know how much will survive the reset, but what have we got to lose?


*SOUND EFFECTS, STATIC, DISTORTION, ETC PLAYS*


DJ SCIP: The walls are beginning to fade now. They are still there, but everything can be seen through. If, that makes sense. Not that much of this does but now more things are slowly becoming transparent.


DJ SCIP: My coffee cup just disappeared out of my hand, I can see through my control sets before me. It’s like they are still there but no longer visible. Things are becoming, softer? I’m not sure how to explain it all.


DJ SCIP: Hmmm, well, the skin on my hand has now faded, though I can still feel with it, though faintly. I can see my muscles and bones underneath. My chair just faded out completely and though I was still sitting in it I couldn’t help but get up out of it.


DJ SCIP: There’s just, not much left around me anymore, but I can still, somewhat feel things. There was a darkness but even that is now fading to white. Hope you all are ok and that we make it through this together.

**Toadking07 Backstage Notes:**


Things were hitting the fan and I wanted to show that in the audio quality and how DJ Scip was holding up. He sighs more, he stumbles, he questions himself, he sounds tired. Wanted to make this really wear on him, even from the safety of his bunker underground.


We put out the call for personnel to be read as deceased on the episode and got a lot of responses. Unfortunately reading the full list would have made for a dull episode so I had to speed it up a little. My apologies to anyone who didn't make the cut, we are still thankful for your sacrifice and submission. Special thanks to Lyrahel who read most of the list only to have us cut more than half of it.

[[tab Script ]]
00:00
DJ SCIP: Those of you just joining us, I’m your host, DJ Scip, and you’re listening to SCP 93.[REDACTED FAM radio and I promise, today is a memetic kill agent-free day. For tonight’s announcements, yhe time is 0-200 hours and we have successfully reverted the timeline back by one year, two months, 5 days, 6 hours and 4 minutes. Please adjust your clocks accordingly.

DJ SCIP: We have decided to abort the Foundation Space Program before it even began! Please report any overlaps or dimensional differences immediately to the Department of Extra-Universal Affairs.


DJ SCIP: As per usual aborted timeline protocol, personnel not essential for temporal repairs get the day off! Enjoy our continued survival as a species and remember to hug your loved ones...or the Foundation provided equivalent!


DJ SCIP: We have survived to secure, contain, and protect, another day.


DJ SCIP: I’m not sure if the “days since the last containment breach” counter should be reset to zero or not. Or if we should we count the days without a containment breach that had taken place before we jumped back in our timeline. Or if that should include the 24 hour period when most of us were in a coma while reality shifted.


DJ SCIP: On that note, as we continue forward through the days, weeks, months and year we’ve already lived through, be sure to be considerate of others this time around. 


DJ SCIP: For example, if you got to attend one of the insightful and eventful seminars, such as the "Improvisational Acting and SCP Containment" or the “Introduction Seminar for Extra-Universal Operations”, before the reset, please allow new personnel the chance to attend.


DJ SCIP: Besides the fact that it allows new attendees to learn from the speakers, it’s actually not that cool to know the answers to all the questions before they are asked. Seriously, you’ll look like a total nerd and no one will be impressed.


DJ SCIP: I know one little gel that is happy the Foundation has survived to another day! SCP-999, the gelatinous tickle monster! The little gel is happily scooting around Site-17 cooing and tickle wrestling everyone in sight!


DJ SCIP: Morale is up considerably there and it is rumored the little orange gel will be loaned out to a few other sites to assist in adjustment to the timeline reset.


DJ SCIP: Coming to your ears next is a song inspired by everyone’s favorite hugging slime, titled simply “SCP-999” by personnel Jack T. Herbert! Here it goes!


*SONG PLAYS*


DJ SCIP: Remember, you can find the song linked on our Foundation After Midnight Radio pages. If you would like to hear your SCP inspired music on our broadcast, you can email us at SCP93.FAMRadio@gmail.com.


DJ SCIP: For those of you having trouble adjusting and having questions of “what is and is not real,” “Am I still ‘ME’,” or “What if my taste buds have changed and I can’t tell” just try and think about a thought I had one day that helps me sleep at night when things get rough.


DJ SCIP: “For every reality where there is a better looking version of you, there are infinite realities with uglier versions of you.” So don’t get too caught up in your own looks. You are probably a pretty solid median compared to the rest.


DJ SCIP: And heck, there are even more realities of you that wish they were us in our reality. So please, keep that in mind.


DJ SCIP: If you would all join me now in a moment of silence for all the realities where we didn’t survive that last catastrophic event.


DJ SCIP: …


DJ SCIP: Thank you.


DJ SCIP: And now Miss Mercurial would like me to mention we have a donation drive started for realities less fortunate than our own.


DJ SCIP: Currently funds are being raised and will be converted into whatever currency the other realities exchange with and used to improve their worldly economy. The money may go towards supporting the free human rebels against a tyrant worm people, or to send needed medicine to a post apocalyptic America, or to feed the hungry in a world where everything does in fact taste like chicken.


DJ SCIP: This Wednesday is going to once again be the 5th Annual Site 118 Game Night! Grab a friend, meet someone new, and sit down to play a game or two!


DJ SCIP: Light refreshments will be provided in the Site 118 cafeteria, though bring your own drink or snack to share for entry into the game night raffle! 


DJ SCIP: Non alcoholic drinks only, snacks must be of a shareable size. A pack of gum, although shareable, does not count.


DJ SCIP: With a new timeline in the works and a smaller workforce we’re gonna take things easy today and play you guys another song.


DJ SCIP: Here is “SCP-513 Cowbell Song” by Personnel Glenn Leroi:


*SONG PLAYS*


*DINGS A COWBELL*


DJ SCIP: Just kidding! Though even if by some horrific mix up it was the SCP-513 cowbell, experiments have shown that hearing a recording or transmission of the cowbell’s ring does not have the same effect. Or at least, I think.


DJ SCIP: If anyone else starts seeing a thin humanoid with abnormally large hands, we may have a situation..
In other news in our infrequent sports corner, the softball team formerly known as “The Unkillable Lizards” is trying to come up with a new team name and mascot and they’re taking suggestions!


DJ SCIP: After last season’s, errrr, the upcoming future season? Ummm, well after everything that happened and then unhappened, they are looking to adopt a new name and mascot, preferably one that isn’t as hated.


DJ SCIP: The team asks that personnel feel free to submit your ideas for Site-Redacted’s new team name through our toll free Radio Hotline, (512) 937-2346, and we’ll air the best suggestions in an upcoming broadcast.


DJ SCIP: The Temporal Anomaly Research Development and Integration Station will be open throughout the week for all those in need of temporal counseling and time adjustment resources.


DJ SCIP: Please also remember to report all time and space based anomalies and paradoxes to the center as soon as you are able. Even if they haven’t happened yet.


DJ SCIP: Well, I… I uh…


DJ SCIP: I guess that’s it for today. I haven’t been able to really leave the station since...well since next year. I don’t wanna jinx us here but there’s no containment breach, no solar serpent descending upon us.. or global quarantine.


DJ SCIP: I believe I count as non-essential personnel, as far as timeline repairs go, so I guess that means I get the day off!


DJ SCIP: Well then! It’s settled! I’m going go hug my foundation provided family-substitute and then I think I have a slime to challenge to a tickle fight. 


DJ SCIP: So please, if you’ll excuse me, dear listeners, thank you for making the Foundation what it is. Keep on securing, containing and protecting. This is DJ Scip, signing out.

//Episode released Aug 28, 2014//


**Toadking07 Backstage Notes:**


This wrapped up the first story arc of FAM Radio! Wanted to finish the big stuff up and slow down a little. This series started with a real world ending bang, so where we would go from here was unclear. We started planning out a few more episodes, some we still haven't gotten to yet, but nothing as grand or epic as this one has come up yet. 


Obviously having the world end //every// third episode would get a bit dull, so we wanted to get into more day to day happenings in the Foundation. As with the Foundation in-universe, there's plenty of strange things in the mundane, everyday tasks in running a facility for nightmares. Not to say we //don't// have plans for everything to go south again, but the next few episodes keep things on a more personal level.

DJ SCIP: We’d like to thank all of our listeners, all of you damn fine Foundation employees listening in from around the world. We know life within a clandestine organization can be, strict, intrusive, and down right dangerous, but remember, your work in the shadows saves the lives of those who live in the light. 


DJ SCIP: I’m your host, DJ Scip, you’re listening to 93.[REDACTED] FAM radio and today we play our regular, non memetic kill agent theme music!


*JINGLE PLAYS*


DJ SCIP: We now apologize for the memetic kill agent we hid in the previous jingle. Those Groups of Interest are getting trickier out there and we need to take precautions. Now onto announcements for this evening! We’ve got a big list of them and...well, what else do you have to do?


DJ SCIP: After the recent raids on several Sites and Sectors within the Foundation, an undisclosed number of SCPs have had to be temporarily relocated while their normal housing is re-secured. For the time being, keep an eye out for any new additions to your site as you may have some new neighbors in containment cells! You may want to go say hi like they did in the good old days. With a fresh pecan pie and a loaded shotgun or tranquilizer rifle!


DJ SCIP: You will also likely notice additional security brought in while the renovations are being completed. They are there for your protection, so don’t make eye contact for too long!


DJ SCIP: An announcement for all Foundation staff, regardless of security level, if you come across any D-Class personnel wandering around your site facility, call security and maintain a safe distance. You may even want to lock yourself in your lab or office until they have left the area. You never know what they might have been exposed to, and you don’t know what you’ll be exposed to by engaging them! Be safe and secure yourself first!


DJ SCIP: It’s still not too late to sign up your team for the Global Test-A-Thon! Collaborate with your fellow researchers and compete to complete the most experiments on an anomalous item in 48 hours.


DJ SCIP: Expand our knowledge of anomalous objects and compete for fabulous prizes! Contestants are judged on two categories: new discoveries and most creative experiment!


DJ SCIP: See if you can beat last years record of 201 experiments!


DJ SCIP: With that, it looks like we need to get those D-Class personnel numbers up, up, UP!!  So this week we will be having the third annual "Bring In A Drifter!" drive to replenish our human test subject supply! Remember, this week, D is for Drifter!


DJ SCIP: Please note: Unwanted in-laws will not be accepted this time, so do not bring them in, even as a joke.


DJ SCIP: In other new completely unrelated events, the second annual “682 Rodeo Championship” has been canceled. In its place, a brainstorm forum will take place wherein personnel are welcome to submit any and all new ideas for how to destroy SCP-682 - The Unkillable Lizard.


DJ SCIP: At this time the brainstorm forum board would like it noted that Dr. Kondraki’s suggestions are not welcome and will not be accepted.


DJ SCIP: And please note that your ideas should be more developed than, “Kill it with fire!”, “Shoot it a lot.”, or “Throw it into the sun!” We already tried those and we should all remember how well those worked.


DJ SCIP: The forum will begin after a short memorial service for the hundreds who died during the 1st “682 Rodeo Championship” held last year.


DJ SCIP: Now for a related Personnel Note of the Day: After 55 years of research, Dr. Bruce Richardson the III is retiring from the foundation and I think you all know what that means! Dr. Richardson will receiving his own, custom, “G.Y.A.P.O.K. FM’s Greatest Hits!"
 

DJ SCIP: The GYAPOK counter agent initiative was founded by Dr. Fantem and is the alternative Foundation funded radio station, not hosted by yours truly.  The hidden memetic agents there increase the productivity, lifespan, and general moral with a hint of compulsions to follow rules and procedure. Unfortunately, after not listening to the station for a few days, you may develop irritation, chronic headaches, insomnia, and worse of all a lack of drive and lowered productivity.
 

DJ SCIP: To combat that, this custom mixtape has been designed specifically for Dr. Richardson's brain waves to slowly wean him off those soothing memetics without the pain. As for the pain of missing his Foundation family? We don't have a mixtape for that.
 

DJ SCIP:  We hope as many of you as we can spare can make it down to see him off.  The retirement party will be held in the staff lounge of sector 23. Which is just past the temporary holding pen for SCP-682 since the cancellation of the Rodeo Championship.


DJ SCIP: Everyone in the sector is invited to stop by and grab a slice of non-Scip birthday cake.
An additional note to all personnel attending, you are advised to wear full tactical gear. Attending Mobile Task Force members are asked to arrive a half hour early to help set up a perimeter. All security teams are to be on standby.


DJ SCIP: We go now to our infrequent sports corner!


DJ SCIP: Right now the the “SCP Foundation / Global Occult Coalition, Inter-Agency Charity Ice Hockey Game” is underway over at the Sloth's Pit Ice Rink. All proceeds from tonight's game go to benefit the Foundation Widows and Orphans Relief, as well as the United Nation International Children's Emergency Fund. Now in the third period, the score is currently tied at 0-0. It’s anyone’s game and the stadium is tense with sports related tension!


DJ SCIP: Things have been off to a rocky start as 5 minutes into the first period, Foundation forward Dr. Jackman collided with GOC defenseman Agent 'Marimba' at center ice, resulting in a high-sticking call for Dr. Jackman, and an interference call for Agent Marimba. Coalition team coach 'Dulcimer' objected to the two-minute penalty, claiming that, 'Putting these guys in a box won't do anything in the long run. A permanent solution is required,' and offering to eliminate both 'threats to the game' using his sidearm. Foundation coach Dr. Bright took exception to this argument, claiming that murder is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. He cited that the penalty boxes were insufficiently secure to contain the two players, noting that they lacked electrified fences and any sort of memetic-kill agent in case of outside intrusion. Both coaches were ejected from the game for unsportsmanlike conduct and roughing an official.


DJ SCIP: Whoo, this is going to be a match to keep an eye on! More on the game as it develops.


DJ SCIP: For those of you who missed it, Dr. Clef’s seminar, “Reality Benders and You: How to Survive when Existence Doesn’t” will take place at 2 pm tomorrow in seminar room B. Those attending are reminded that all seminar rooms are weapon free zones and to check your weapons at the door.


DJ SCIP: This will be your best chance to get certified on dealing with reality benders and enjoy a gripping lecture by one of the Foundation’s most… uniquest! Free muffins and coffee provided, so come hungry!


DJ SCIP: Wait no, this says that coming hungry is actually a requirement for attending the seminar?…so do that...I guess.


DJ SCIP: Speaking of Alto Clef, to whoever keeps signing things with a “#” followed by the “$,” you need to stop. You are not Dr. Alto Clef and no one recognizes your signature.


DJ SCIP: We’ve got some big news for you guys tonight. So big we’re not even sure if we’re allowed to talk about it but here goes!


DJ SCIP: The higher ups heard about our broadcast during the universe wide reset and said it was, and I quote, “essential to maintaining morale high enough to keep personnel from resorting to their primal animal natures.” They have recognized us here at Foundation After Midnight Radio as more than just a third shift radio station burning the sweet midnight oil and have decided to give us more funding. With it I’ve gone ahead and upgraded some new equipment, added more security measures, and secured what I’m second most excited about, my new APR, Andrew Alexeev!


ANDREW: That’s not my official title


DJ SCIP: That’s Assistant -slash- Possible-Replacement Andrew Alexeev for you folks unfamiliar with broadcast terms. He’s here to learn how to handle the broadcast in case anything happens to yours truly. As we know, and are reminded of everyday here, life is fleeting and we could all disappear from existence before we were even born!


ANDREW: Technically sir-


DJ SCIP: Call me Scip. No need to be formal.


ANDREW: Technically, Scip, I’m here in to help transcribe the broadcast and to fill in for you in case you finally decide to take any of your amassed sick days.


DJ SCIP: I’m glad you’re taking this job so seriously Andrew! Always remember, if anything happens to me, you’re next in line for the throne.


ANDREW: You mean the rolly chair?


DJ SCIP: Haha,it’s more than just a rolly chair. You’ll learn. You’ll learn. So Andrew, you’re new to the Foundation After Midnight Family, but how long have you been with the SCP Foundation?


ANDREW: I’ve been with the Foundation for [REDACTED] years...was that, was that just redacted?”


DJ SCIP: You get used to it. To let the fine folks of the Foundation get used to hearing your voice, how bout you take the next segment? The mic is yours! 


*ROLLY CHAIR OUT*


ANDREW: So...hey everyone...um, so next up, we have a new section to improve interpersonal relationships. We give to you “Foundation Missed Connections”


ANDREW: To the one with the gun named 'Martha' - Dinner on me? - Male For Female


ANDREW: To the red-haired female agent I saw in the mess hall on saturday at 12:30ish, thank you for buying me lunch. I lost my wallet and you were kind enough to buy me something to eat- I was STARVING! Sadly, you left before I could even get your name. You told me a little bit about how you used your gun. I think you referred to it as 'Martha'? I'd like to know more about you! I'm stuck in the labs mostly so maybe you can tell me some stories about the outside over dinner? It's on me! Please meet me outside site 19's mess hall at 5pm on the 21st (sunday!)


ANDREW: You Saved My Life And I Don't Even Know Your Name - Female For Female


ANDREW: During the last containment breach I was the researcher who got trapped under the falling debris. You were the black haired security guard who unloaded your gun at SCP-13- 


ANDREW: Am I allowed to say these live? 


ANDREW: Okay. SCP-1305, you may know it as the Cat Lure, and drew it away from me. Without you I know I would have been turned into one of those things. I would enjoy the chance to at least buy you a drink or dinner sometime at the site cafeteria, so please reply with what SCP-1305 said just before you shot at it.


ANDREW: I Hope You Remember Me! - Male For Female


ANDREW: I'm a researcher at site [Redacted]. You were the one working with me on Project [Redacted]. I'm the one who was able to [Redacted] when the [Redacted] went [Redacted]. I hope this message will help you remember me, because I really think we had a thing. The number to contact me is [Redacted]


ANDREW: Meet me for Pizza? - Female For Male


ANDREW: To the person who used SCP-458, “The Never-Ending Pizza Box,” on Tuesday the 13th prior to 1:30 PM. I thought I was the only one who enjoyed pineapple and anchovy pizza on a wheat crust with white sauce, but after discovering the remains of your lunch set in the waste disposal unit, I have discovered that I am not alone in my strange preferences for pizza. I would love to meet up for lunch. Please meet me in the Site 17 cafeteria tomorrow at 1:30 PM. We can share our unique tastes and maybe something more. I'll be wearing the yellow tie and the black rimmed glasses.


ANDREW: Let's Hang Out Sometime” - Male For Male


ANDREW: Hey, most people know me as SCP-076-2, but some call call me Able-


ANDREW: Again, are you sure we can say these on air?...Are you positive? Okay.


ANDREW: -I'm here at the bottom of an elevator shaft at Containment Area 25B. I was trying to find the operative who beat me to death with a fire extinguisher in Japan last week. I was kinda thinking, I dunno, we should hang out sometime, you know, do battle, reminisce on foes defeated in combat, restart Pandora's Box, nothing special. If you're interested, reply with the method I used to kill your commander.


*ROLLY CHAIRS IN. SOUND OF PAPER. ROLLY CHAIR OUT*


ANDREW: Oh. We interrupt our current segment to bring you an update I've just been handed from the SCPFGOCIA-, uhhh, darn it, the SCP Foundation/GOC Inter-Agency Charity Ice Hockey Game!


ANDREW: Still tied at 0-0, the game has now gone into overtime. 


ANDREW: We have received word that Global Occult Coalition goalie 'Baritone Sax' has received a game misconduct and ejection from the game for illegal equipment. It seems he was wearing a powered-armor "white suit" under his goalie pads. This was discovered after a miscalibrated servo caused Mr. Sax to propel the puck at supersonic speeds across the ice, smashing through the glass and injuring an innocent cashier while attempting to clear the puck. 


ANDREW: More on this game as things develops! It’s really heating up out there!


*ROLLY CHAIR ROLLS BACK*


ANDREW: So...did I do it right?


DJ SCIP: You did just fine, Andrew. Just fine. I remember my first time on the air. You’ll get your wings. Now I’ll take it from here.


ANDREW: Ok, well I’ll just be over here then, transcribing everything. You didn’t, by chance, transcribe what I just read did you?


DJ SCIP: Nope.


ANDREW: *sigh* Of course. Well, I better catch up then.


DJ SCIP: An update on the Personnel Note of the Day:


DJ SCIP: It seems the shockwaves from today’s big hockey game are being felt even at the retirement party for Bruce Richardson the III. Due to rising hostilities between the Foundation and G.O.C. in the stadium, several high risk SCPs are being transferred from their current containment wings to the facility bunkers, which happen to be located right next to the staff lounge, which happens to be where the retirement party is being held. I hope during this time the good doctor is enjoying being surrounded by some of the best and brightest the Foundation has to offer, while also being surrounded by some of the deadliest most horrific abominations the Foundation has to contain. For as we all know, the best part about a Foundation party is a Foundation party don’t stop until a Containment breach goes off!


DJ SCIP: If you are helping with the transfers, you are invited to swing by the retirement party when you’re done! Remember, just go out of the cafeteria and take a right at the temporary holding cell being used to hold SCP-682, the Unkillable Lizard. Just head towards the party music trying to drown out the sound of claws on metal and you’ll find it! 


DJ SCIP: Worth noting is a quick list of some of the other Keter and Euclid class SCPs currently being moved to the temporary holding cells. This includes a pack of SCP-939, various instances from the body horrors of SCP-1429, and SCP-1616, otherwise known as “Nibbles the hungry hamster who can fit anything in his mouth”


DJ SCIP: Hmm… I’m pretty sure everything will be just a-okay with the retirement party, but uh, now that I’ve read that all out loud, I think I’m going to make a phone call..


DJ SCIP: While I do that, we have a very special recording for you today my fine foundation family. With our new funding comes new security clearance. With it, yours truly got a chance to interview the one, and only, SCP-1761-1: The Republic of Arnold Fitzwilliams! 


DJ SCIP: Please Enjoy.


*PLAYS INTERVIEW WITH SCP-1761-1*


DJ SCIP: I've just received word that the Foundation/GOC Inter-Agency Charity Ice Hockey Game has ended in a shootout. . . literally. Witnesses are unclear as to who drew their concealed firearms and opened fire first, but all agreed that both sides were responsible for the extensive damage to the Sloth's Pit Ice Rink, which is now riddled with bullet holes, several grenade craters, and a burning, melted Zamboni, after a daring but foolhardy attempt by Coalition players to use the ice-cleaning machine as a makeshift armored vehicle.


DJ SCIP: Harkness Manchester, the owner of the Ice Rink, has stated that the Foundation and Coalition are no longer welcome at his facility, and that neither agency will be getting back their $700 security deposit.


DJ SCIP: On the bright side, it has been estimated that the Foundation/GOC Inter-Agency Charity Ice Hockey Game has raised. . . 


*TYPING IS HEARD*


DJ SCIP: ...after taking into consideration repair costs for the arena...


DJ SCIP: ...about ten bucks.


DJ SCIP: ...


DJ SCIP: Well I guess this is a good a time as any to talk about our back up fundraiser event, the Keter Cake Bake Sale! We have 237 cakes of various sizes and flavors that must go! Literally! We need to get rid of these cakes in the next 24 hours! As mentioned before, we are low on D-class personnel who typically consume these cakes and we are a tad short handed today, so come and eat some cakes! I don’t care what your diet says, just consider this your cheat day…


DJ SCIP: There’s a type of cake for everyone at this bake sale! We’ve got all sorts of cakes, from baumkuchen to miniature cupcakes! There’s a cake with your name on it just waiting for you! Well, ok, there actually is a cake here with your name on it if your name is Rebecca, Roth, Patel, Tyrone, or Juan.


DJ SCIP: The funds go towards the original charity cause of the Hockey Fundraiser event, the Foundation Widows and Orphans Fund, as well as the United Nation International Children's Emergency Fund...as well as to cover the cost of the Hockey Fundraiser event!


DJ SCIP: Get your cakes before they repli-cake!


DJ SCIP: As we wind down, it’s time for music by personnel! We have a segment here by Junior Researcher Kix entitled, “Memetic Or Something.” Huh, well that shouldn’t actually be memetic, or at least not in any sort of dangerous way.


DJ SCIP: Remember, if you would like to have your music featured in our show, reach out and email us at SCP93.famradio[at]gmail.com and let us know who you are!


DJ SCIP: And now, please listen in for “Memetic Or Something.”


*SONG PLAYS*


DJ SCIP: In Other News, Dr. Bruce Richardson the III's retirement party went off without a hitch. Sorry from those of us who couldn’t make it, Doc, but from what I’ve heard from the mobile task force operatives afterwards, the cake was delicious and the decorations fun and delightful!


DJ SCIP: Have a happy retirement and enjoy that greatest hits tape!


DJ SCIP: ...


DJ SCIP: I’m...I’m not sure what to say here. I never really made a call sign. We typically went until my recorder’s battery died or some other cataclysmic event stopped us, but now that we have funding I guess that’s not as likely…


DJ SCIP: Um, thanks for listening and good night or good morning for those coming into the first shift.

**Toadking07 Backstage Notes:**


This was one of our first big submissions for the podcast, with Dr. Clef sending us the announcement script for the SCP Foundation / Global Occult Coalition Inter-Agency Charity Ice Hockey Game. It was a lot of fun to read and to work an episode around it. We've used voicemails and fan suggestions before, but this was the biggest and most fleshed out submission to date!


This also became out longest episode, nearly three times our shortest episode and still twice as long as our previous longest episode! It just was so much content to fill and edit, but in the end, a favorite episode to produce. The ice hockey game is full of quality antics and references and I really enjoyed subverting the old "he was one day away from retirement" trope with the substoryline we wrote going on in the background.


On top of the guest written material, we also added our first recurring character, Andrew! I had wanted to start branching out, including more people from the Foundation world and PaperAirship was one of the first to approach me about helping out. Wanted to make him more than just an intern but have him come and go with broadcasts as needed.

00:00
DJ SCIP: It’s Christmas Eve here at Foundation After Midnight, well, it’s not the calender Christmas eve, but the real christmas eve, from before the, uh, incident. 


DJ SCIP: It seems that we’ve all been infected with cheer and the anomalous effects of Mr. Kringle because the amount of work getting done is non existent. I gave Andrew the holiday off so it’s just me here today in the studio. Me, you listeners, and a hot cup of cocoa. Ah, festive.


*INTRO PLAYS*


DJ SCIP: Most experiments, expeditions, research, and non containment procedure tasks have been put on hold for the next few days. Partly this is to give the personnel time to relax and enjoy the holiday with friends and family. This partly might also be because the higher ups would feel bad if they indirectly allowed someone to get horrifically killed at Christmas time.


DJ SCIP: Tis the season! Well, errr, tis the season for holiday cheer, not for, getting killed..


DJ SCIP: Anyways, since I know you’re out there, I’ll be taking calls on the  radio hotline and broadcasting them to spread the holiday cheer throughout the global Foundation organization! Speaking of which, I have one already waiting so let’s hear who it is!


*JACK BRIGHT MESSAGE PLAYS*


DJ SCIP: Ah, thank you Dr. Bright. I’m sure no one will mess with your shotgun filled Christmas.


DJ SCIP:  Let’s hear another!


*BETA PHI BETA MESSAGE PLAYS*


DJ SCIP:  Hey Foggy! Thanks for the shout outs and don’t worry, we’ve got plenty of broadcast for you tonight! Like this next message!


*AGENT HOSMAN MESSAGE PLAYS*


DJ SCIP: Haha, oh Bio site 66, good times, good times. Hope Dr. Rich is alright though.. SCP-1933 is, volatile.. Errr, you see, If a fat man in a suit tries to offer you a drink-he’s a fat man, with a lot of alcohol in him... 


DJ SCIP: Well no, if you are giving a drink that has any Irish Cream, or is entirely Irish- no no, um…
Let me just play you guys the report for what we’re trying to talk about.. Holiday PSA 572!


*DR. COOL HOLIDAY PSA 572 "SCP-1933 BAILEYS SANTA READING PLAYS*


DJ SCIP: Now that that’s out of the way, a little holiday theatrics playing at a site near you!


DJ SCIP: Taken from the trash, and put on the stage, comes a classic christmas tale with a Foundation Twist. Site-19’s a Christmas Carol is being put on this year, with your favorite personnel, and you don’t want to miss it!


DJ SCIP: Also, please remember that Site-19 ink is designated for Foundation work only.


DJ SCIP: Before he left, Andrew record this PSA for all of you.


*ANDREW GREETING MESSAGE PLAYS*


DJ SCIP: Well Andrew, we hope you're having a happy holiday!


DJ SCIP: An important security note to all Foundation personnel: 


DJ SCIP: “Yesterday, containment for several SCP artifacts, including 1252, a half formed imaginary friend, 1551, the repeating house, and 747, a group of animal mask wearing children, was breached. In all instances where the SCP object has been capable of speech, the effector of the breach was described as “a kind man.” While the breaches were not in and of themselves, severe, the fact that a single individual, apparently acting alone, has proven capable of bypassing all security measures, and has chosen to do so on a day as significant as yesterday, should be troubling to all Foundation employees.


DJ SCIP: To be clear: as there has been no indication of negligence on the part of Foundation employees, no one is being punished for this incident. This is only a reminder that, despite however human SCP objects may appear, we are still interacting with entities far beyond our ability to comprehend. It should go without saying that all Foundation personnel, of all levels, must maintain absolute vigilance at all times. - O5-██”


DJ SCIP: Whew, even during this festive season, it’s important to keep on your toes people. Got to stay sharp, cause we deal with some pretty crazy things on a daily basis.


DJ SCIP: Take for example the Are We Cool Yet? group of interest. This GOI is, I’ll get the official write up here, ahead: 


DJ SCIP: “A collective of "art terrorists", the members of Are We Cool Yet? are capable of either obtaining or producing anomalous objects and entities, and using them to create art installations. These installations are placed for maximum public exposure, and are often — but not always — fatal to bystanders; the phrase "Are We Cool Yet?" is always present in some way.”


DJ SCIP: They are anartists if you will. To emphasis this, I’ll read a little fictional christmas themed story about them.


*READS "ARE WE CHRISTMAS YET?"*


DJ SCIP: Hmmm, I think it’s a good time to listen to some more hotline calls. Remember, the FAM Radio hotline is open all year around, so give us a call! The number to call is 512-937-2346.


DJ SCIP: So, here goes!


*DOCTOR HALL'S MESSAGE PLAYS*


DJ SCIP: Ah, thank you doctor! Hopefully everyone is making the best of their night. Whether you’re at home with family, out huddled around a heater eating Christmas cookies, or trapped in your office with a mountain of paperwork, here’s to you personnel! 


DJ SCIP: And here’s to our next message!


*ELVES MESSAGE PART 1 PLAYS*


DJ SCIP: Uh, ok, well that was, concerning..  At least umm, well there’s already another so let’s hear that!


*ELVES MESSAGE PART 2 PLAYS*


DJ SCIP: Well thank you very much, Researcher Twinkle Toes. That sounds like a lovely use of one of the Research facilities and I don't see why anyone would be calling security or doing anything about what we just heard..


*DIALS PHONE UNDER TABLE*


DJ SCIP: If I can bring to your collected attentions now, the 14th Annual Site-19 Senior Staff Christmas Eve Caroling event, hosted by Researcher Conwell is coming to town again. A group which consists of many recognizable faces including yours truly. We’ll be singing classics like:


DJ SCIP:  We Wish You A Merry Safemas! I Saw Mommy Kissing SCP-076, Navarro Saves Christmas, SCP-682 Roasting on an Open Fire, Set Up Thine Altar Here, Deck The Halls With Scranton Anchors! No One Should Be Alone, Oh Holy Bright, I Hope That I Get Old Before I Die, Walking in a Winter Wondertainment Land, The North Pole, SCP-1440 is Coming to Town! And The Main Theme to Die Hard.


DJ SCIP: Researcher Conwell would also like to note that due to the events that transpired during last year’s caroling, they’ll no longer be visiting the Keter wing. They admit it isn’t optimal, but -quote- we’re supposed to be spreading Christmas cheer, not Christmas tears. -end quote-


DJ SCIP: To give you a taste of our performance, here’s a personal favorite of mine that didn’t make the list this year, “The 12 Days of SCP”


DJ SCIP: On the twelfth day of Christmas the O5 gave to me… Twelve days of headaches, eleven cauterpillars, ten clever prankings, nine apple seeds, eight puffer kittens, seven creepy crawlies, six floating eyepods, five MTFs! Four lazy guards, three new class-D’s, two cups of Joe, and another round of keter duty.


DJ SCIP: This isn’t new news, but something worthy of the holiday season and of giving thanks and for remembering. A few years back after Christmas and new years, the Foundation lost one of it’s finest. Tyler Bailey, inventor of the MUTA, or Multi-Universal Transit Array, died of an aneurysm on January 19th, 1997. His invention allows us to explore alternate realities and is at the height of Foundation studies and research. His sons Trevor, Tom, and Tristan are all outstanding members of the Foundation family and together they dedicated a plaque at the site in honor of the late Dr. Bailey.


DJ SCIP: Well shoot it seems I’m running low on cocoa. While I refill my festive mug of festive fluids for my festive maw, please enjoy Dr. Cimmerian reading the classic, “The Night Before Redacted.”


*DOCTOR CIMMERIAN "THE NIGHT BEFORE REDACTED" PLAYS*


DJ SCIP: But first, more messages to play for you all!


*MTF CAPPA MESSAGE PLAYS*


DJ SCIP: I can’t say I can really help with that Bran. Maybe just accept the red coloring as part of your uniform. Or, maybe a new uniform would make a great gift for Lieutenant Bran, hint, hint, wink wink, anyone need any last minute gift ideas out there..


DJ SCIP: Or, for those not with the budget to buy a completely new Mobile Task Force team uniform and outfitted patrol gear, consider a 2-disc CD titled “Dr. Clef’s Holiday Hits”. This amazing album has tons of holiday hits! At least, it seems to boast a number. Can’t really tell. The cover depicts Dr. Alto Clef in a Santa outfit and holding a microphone, so at least that should be interesting.


DJ SCIP: While not a holiday song, it is full of holiday cheer. Please enjoy Researcher Zyn’s demo of “Do You Want To Catch a Bixby”


DJ SCIP: I for one hope to hear more from her in the future!


*RESEARCHER ZYN SINGING "DO YOU WANT TO CATCH A BIXBY" PLAYS*


DJ SCIP: Okay wait, so I just noticed this sticky note on my desk to play an audio log.  I can’t seem to remember what it is, but I’ll trust my own handwriting.


*DOCTOR CIMMERIAN 055 SONG PLAYS *


DJ SCIP: Oh Right! That what...what was I talking about? And why is there a sticky note on my desk?
 I think I see some more messages ready to go! Let’s hear what they got!


*GAMMA QUADRANT MESSAGE PLAYS* 


DJ SCIP: Well, thank you year 2571! That’s probably going to have to be authenticated and looked into, but for now, happy holidays to you too!


*FIELD AGENT THOMAS MESSAGE PLAYS*


DJ SCIP: Hey Field Agent Thomas! Thanks for calling in! Always happy to hear from our guys in the fields! While I’m at it, a special shout out to all of our SCP Foundation branches, including our friends in the Russian Branch, our Korean Colleagues, the Chinese Branch, the Polish Branch, Spanish, Thai, and Japanese Branches!


DJ SCIP: Well now the messages are just coming in faster and faster!


*BEAR MESSAGE PLAYS*


DJ SCIP: No matter what your beliefs are, what holidays you observe, if you’re part of the Foundation, you’re part of a family. A family of personnel working hard to keep the world a little brighter, a little safer, a little merrier. A special warm thank you to all of you out there.


*PLAYGROUND MESSAGE PLAYS*


DJ SCIP: Huh, well they didn’t leave a name, but I think that must have been one of the Researchers down there. Ah, well onto the next message! 


*CREEPY JINGLE BELLS MESSAGE PLAYS*


DJ SCIP: Well my oh my wasn’t THAT a strange holiday carol. People can sometimes get a little...too in the spirit around here and let the holidays get to their head.  I’ll just be...making a call to get some more party-goers down there to uh...lighten up the mood a little.


DJ SCIP: But before I go, let me just take this time to thank you for listening and wish you all a very merry christmas and a happy holiday. Here’s to another year within the Foundation.

**Toadking07 Backstage Notes:**


This is one of my favorite episodes as we got a lot of call-ins from SCP fans and it was fun to work as many of them in as I could! All of our hotline messages are left by fans and are not previously scripted or planned by us. It was great to get so many to work with, with a few new and well known personnel making appearances.


The radio hotline number is a real number fans can call in to, thanks to Google Voice. I don't check it daily, or even weekly, but I do listen to each and every one of the voicemails and read every messages we are sent. I also don't shy away from quietly blocking anyone who spams or is clearly just being an asshat. Another note is that although international call rates do apply since the number is based in the US, international fans can also email us audio files in the style of a voicemail for us to use as well!


Callers are welcome to talk in-universe, role play, or even just talk out of character as they please. We've gotten over 500 unique callers over the years now, with maybe a quarter of them being suitable for episodes. A new episode with a call in prompt like this holiday episode has been on my to-do list for a while now. Keep an eye out on social media for an announcement for when that comes up!

BACKUP SYSTEM: The time is [12:01] [AM] at location site-[REDACTED]. It has been [REDACTED] days since last broadcast. Backup system protocol [EMPTY SEAT] initiated. 


BACKUP SYSTEM: Beginning protocol:


BACKUP SYSTEM: Welcome to Foundation After Midnight Radio, the Foundation based radio show transmitting to all of you [LOVELY] Foundation personnel around the [WORLD].


BACKUP SYSTEM: The Foundation was established long ago to protect mankind from terrors and strange objects that would threaten the world as we know it. Working in the dark to keep civilization in the light. If you are hearing this broadcast you are more than likely an employee or operative of the Foundation, whether you are aware of this or not.


*MEMETIC KILL AGENT PLAYS*


BACKUP SYSTEM: [MEMETIC KILL AGENT] audio completed. All unauthorized listeners without proper clearance neutralized.


BACKUP SYSTEM: Please contact your local [SITE DIRECTOR] if you are not receiving this broadcast.


BACKUP SYSTEM: Now playing [NON MEMETIC] audio for your listening [PLEASURE]. Please enjoy, [SCP-ONE, TWO, REPORT TO]:


*SCP-ONE, TWO, REPORT TWO PLAYS*


BACKUP SYSTEM: [NON MEMETIC]  audio enjoyment complete. The time is {EXACT TIME SINCE LAST TIME ANNOUNCEMENT}.


BACKUP SYSTEM: Seat pressure registered, switching to live audio feed. Protocol [EMPTY SEAT] on standby. Thank you for listening to the Foundation After Midnight Radio back up system.


ANDREW: Hmmmm, okay, now the mic is on, levels are good, looks like things were setup to broadcast buuuuuut no DJ Scip! Huh. Maybe he stepped out? Automated broadcast was playing though..


ANDREW: Well listeners, it has been a while. 


ANDREW: I’m uh, not sure how long it’s been for you since the last manned broadcast, I took a leave of absence as my Foundation intramural softball team the Preserving Pendants made it to the international championship this year! Before things got messed up with the Foundation Space Program, my team had been knocked out of the brackets after most of the team died in a containment breach involving SCP… Uh, well it doesn’t matter as after the reality reset we were able to swing our way to victory, as DJ Scip would say!


ANDREW: I guess that’s our sports corner update for today! We beat the Site-103’s Critical Tomatoes team narrowly! Good game guys!


ANDREW: So that was, huh, that was a few weeks back at the least. Sorry, I just got back in here and I’m kind of just killing time until he gets back.


ANDREW: DJ Scip didn’t mention that he was going away anytime soon when I left. He said he’d have the broadcasts recorded for me to transcribe when I got back, but there doesn’t seem to be anything on the broadcast recorder..


ANDREW: Oh, looks like we’ve got a phone call coming in? Uh, okay, you’re on the air!


*PICKS UP CALL*


BELFORD: So I finally have a small break so shoot. Do your thing. Ask away, I’ll see what I can tell you. 


ANDREW: Uhhhhh, okay then, what happened to DJ Scip?


BELFORD: What? How should I know? I thought this was the radio hotline number of his?


ANDREW: Ummmmm, no wait, yes, this is the Foundation After Midnight Radio hotline, but I’m not DJ Scip. He scheduled an interview with you right now?


BELFORD: Well no, not actually right now, but he's been bugging me to come on the show for a month.I finally had a breakthrough in my research and I’m waiting to hear back from my good for nothing team lead to move things forward. Figured this would be the most efficient use of my time. I hadn’t heard from DJ Scip or whatever he’s going by now for awhile and  the silent treatment always gets at me, so here I am.


ANDREW: And you would be..?


BELFORD: I'm Researcher Belford. Dr. Belford? I’m from the Memetics Department? Oh I don’t know why I’m telling you this, you’re just what? The station intern?


ANDREW: No, I’m the assistant and or replacement midnight DJ host. I could interview you right now if you’d like!


BELFORD: And you are?


ANDREW: Oh, I'm Andrew. Usually I just transcribe the broadcasts.


BELFORD: Do you have any idea what branch I work in? What my research encompasses?


ANDREW: Uh, the Memetics branch? 


BELFORD:  …


ANDREW: Did DJ Scip actually know either? You could explain it to me on air?


BELFORD: I think I'll call back another time. I’m going to send another passive aggressive email out before the weekend excuses everyone from checking their emails for two days.


ANDREW: Okay, I'll be sure to let DJ Scip know you stopped by, Ms Belford.


BELFORD: Oh he will be aware. And it's Dr. Belford. Goodbye.


ANDREW: Right, got ya. Bye.


*CALL ENDS*

ANDREW: This is why I’m glad I don’t work with researchers anymore.. Ah, ummm, ahhh well, the voicemail light is flashing so, let's play some of those!


*RESEARCHER HADLEY BAND MESSAGE PART 2 PLAYS*


ANDREW: I’ll pass that along to Scip as he’s in charge of the music line up, though I now look forward to hearing the “Bleeding Radios.” I don’t play but I always love Foundation based music groups!


ANDREW: Next voicemail coming at you!


*AGENT HOSMAN MESSAGE PLAYS*


ANDREW: Oh uh, they’re talking about what happened back over Christmas while I had some time off for the holidays.. Hmmm, not sure on the date on that. Well, uh, congratulations on the promotion, Doctor Hosman now!


ANDREW: Let’s see who else called in.


*VOICEMAIL MESSAGE PLAYS*


ANDREW: Well, thank you, I’m sure DJ Scip appreciates your call and I know I’m glad we’re helping to keep the morale up. I think I can save this for him to hear when he gets back, yeah there we go.
ANDREW: Hmmm, does seem to be a pile of papers next to the soundboard here. Let me sort through this pile, so while I do that, here’s a word from our sponsor!


*MESSAGE FROM TOADKING07 PLAYS*


ANDREW: Welcome back listeners. Seems we have a note for immediate announcement,


ANDREW: “Experiment Chamber Sixteen will be temporarily unavailable to staff  until the dimensional breach in the chamber is closed. The dimensional breach was reportedly caused due to an unauthorized experiment involving SCP-826.”


ANDREW: Side note, for those unfamiliar that is a pair of bookends that transform a room into the setting of whatever book is between them.


ANDREW: The note continues: “All personnel involved are directed to read the Foundation’s policy on fanfiction, specifically the crossover subsection, and report to Human Resources.”


ANDREW: Well, as far as experiments gone wrong, fanfiction coming to life doesn’t sound like the worst, but that definitely is a gross use of SCP artifacts...Also, why ponies?
ANDREW: I’ve got an announcement that was pre-recorded by DJ Scip! Seems it was queued to go out before, so not sure how long he’s been sitting on it but here goes:


*DJ SCIP ANNOUNCEMENT PLAYS*


DJ Scip: Just a quick announcement from the O5 Council: There is no SCP designation between numbers 2520 and 2522. For all intents and purposes, there is no such number in any regard. 


DJ Scip: On an unrelated note, the pervasive memetics on Foundation sites has recently been updated. Anyone who finds that they are missing a number in the region of 2520 to 2525, but can not understand why, should report to Medical for treatment. The less you know about it the better!- O5-[REDACTED]


ANDREW: Okay, well that might not have been as helpful as they were hoping. But he’s not wrong, the less you know about SCP-2521, the better!


ANDREW: Moving on, I’ve got some more announcements here.  Ahem, Here’s your “Dog Fact of the Day: Your lifestyle determines your deathstyle.” Wait, what? Why is that in here?


ANDREW: Okay, the rest of these are either past the date or don’t make much more sense than that last one.


ANDREW: Well the red light is still flashing so I guess we still have more messages to go through.


*RESEARCHER HADLEY PART 2 MESSAGE PLAYS*


ANDREW: Ah, well that’s an unfortunate turn of events. Sorry to hear it, I was looking forward to that. To our listeners, if you or anyone you know has Foundation related music you’d like aired in future broadcasts, be sure to submit it to scp93.famradio@gmaill.com! We look forward to hearing what you got!!


ANDREW: Geez, how many messages has DJ Scip let sit on here? Next voicemail!


*DJ SCIP MESSAGE PLAYS*


DJ SCIP: Hey Andrew, just calling to let you know I'm running from the smoothie place and will be a little late. I realize now that you probably have already left for your softball team championship, so I guess tonight I'm having two smoothies. Oh well, worse things can happen, I'll catch you when you get back.


DJ SCIP: Okay, one more thing, that's the second time that van has circled by, and I'm not seeing the typical Foundation markings and tell tale play on SCP branding so I'm going to guess I'm being followed. Yup, third time they've circled around now. Guess I’m about to get kidnapped. Yep, they’re getting out and they have black ski masks on.


GOI THUG #1: There's out guy! Get'em!


DJ Scip: Don’t worry, I’m complying. I’m *twack, phone drops* oh, and he punched me. Well now I’m not gonna make this easy for you. DEAD WEIGHT! DEAD WEIGHT!


GOI THUG #2 : You're coming with us!


GOI THUG #2: Get him in the van!


GOI THUG #1: DRIVE DRIVE!


*CAR DOOR SLAMS, VAN DRIVES AWAY*

ANDREW: Oh shit.

**Toadking07 Backstage Notes:**


After nearly a year off, FAM Radio returned! But we wanted to address the gap, to play up that something happened that would delay broadcasts. Hence DJ Scip not showing up at the beginning of the episode and his whereabouts being still very unclear by the end.


Outside of the podcast, I had been running myself ragged with my day job, freelancing, trying to cover my bills, and the eventual feeling of complete burnout from spinning one's wheels in place for too long. Everything took a hit and I stopped nearly everything except getting through my days. Finally I got out of my depression pit and sought counseling, starting enjoying my evenings again, took better care of myself, and started making plans to overhaul my situation.


It wasn't easy, it wasn't fun, and it isn't even over yet, but I got back to a place I could write and work on FAM Radio again. But now I had to pace myself better, had to spread things out. It's largely a one man show back here, try as I might to incorporate a lot of other SCP works and creations. The bulk of the scripts are written by myself, with Kyle helping to edit and flesh things out.


Most of the voice talent we have on are great voice actors and friends of mine who lend their time and talents. Of the SCP readings and audio recordings you were, a lot of them are just pulled off Youtube and added in to help break up the sound of just DJ Scip talking. The voicemails are call ins left by fans on the hotline number, though they are not scripted and sometimes working them in is harder than it seems.

00:00
BACKUP SYSTEM: The time is [12:01] [AM] at location Site-[REDACTED]. Foundation Security Advisory Level: [TUSCAN YELLOW]. Broadcast schedule: [LIMITED]. Broadcast frequency FAM 93 point [REDACTED].


BACKUP SYSTEM: Backup system protocol [EMPTY SEAT] on standby.


BACKUP SYSTEM: Welcome to Foundation After Midnight Radio, the [LATE NIGHT] radio show that serves the [GLOBAL] Foundation community with site announcements, interpersonnel news, and other [ENTERTAINING] audio segments.


BACKUP SYSTEM: If you believe you have received this signal by mistake, please stay where you are. You may have questions such as; What is the Foundation? Where is it located, how does it operate? Please continue listening for more information.


BACKUP SYSTEM: Clearance Level [ZERO] accessed. While much of this information is [CLASSIFIED], at its core, the Foundation stands to protect humankind, the planet earth, and the prevailing reality. There exist groups, entities, and phenomena that threaten human life outside of what is deemed normal, rational, and acceptable.


BACKUP SYSTEM: accessing recent archives: SCP-3024 The doxing ghost account, SCP-3009 the insulting sentient skee-ball machine, and SCP 3040 the left hand of a former Foundation Agent which now hosts an extradimensional void of unknown volume.


BACKUP SYSTEM: Instances are secured, contained, and protected when possible. Neutralization is held as a last resort. The Foundation is not cruel. The Foundation is calculated. The Foundation is listening. 

*PLAYS MEMETIC KILL AGENT INTRO*

Computer: [MEMETIC KILL AGENT] audio completed. All unauthorized listeners neutralized. Stalling protocol successful.Thank you for listening.


BACKUP SYSTEM: For listeners who are still [CONSCIOUS], the Foundation After Midnight Radio team thanks you for your patience during the increased security measures.


BACKUP SYSTEM: Your regularly scheduled radio programming will now continue.


ANDREW: Welcome back listeners, you are listening to FAM Radio, newly relocated over here at site, well, I still don’t think I can say that on the air. [REDACTED] Nope, still scrambled.


ANDREW: Ever since DJ Scip got uh, well, since he got kidnapped, things have been a bit tense around the facility. Just take a listen to this voicemail left on the radio hotline number:


*SECRETARY TO O-5 MESSAGE PLAYS*


ANDREW: And there’s been a few others that have come in through various channels as well. We here at the radio station do appreciate your concerns and thoughts on finding DJ Scip, though to be honest I’m as in the dark as you all are. The various Foundation security groups have been in and out of here a lot but they really don’t tell me much about what happened.


ANDREW: If you have any thoughts on DJ Scip’s, uhh, disappearance, or have seen anything suspicious, feel free to call us at (512) 937-2346. Our voicemail is always open!
Andrew: Now let’s get to some of tonight’s announcements!


ANDREW: First up, the first annual, 5k Labcoat Fun Run, “Running From Science!” Err, wait, that says “Running For Science,” not from. Sorry.


ANDREW: The event is for all ages and all physical fitness levels. Everyone is welcome! You can run, walk, or wheel at your own discretion! It’s good exercise and good practice for all your researchers out there! Um, funds raised go towards the Manna Charitable Foundation this year and their unnatural disaster relief efforts.


ANDREW: Sign up today and pay your entry fee to secure a 5k Labcoat Fun Run 2017 t-shirt for yourself! Personnel are welcome to bring their own lab coat, otherwise all fun runners can pick up a running lab coat the day of at the starting line.


ANDREW: I think.. Yes, think this is it.. On your mark, get set, sign up!


*WHISTLE SOUND EFFECT PLAYS*


ANDREW: Ah ha, sorry, couldn’t help myself. Been playing around with the controls trying to turn the backup system off and I found the soundboard controls.


ANDREW: Moving to the next announcement, this one might be a little less healthy for you.


ANDREW: Due to an incident during a standard anomalous item testing at Site-87, over in Sloth’s Pit, Wisconsin, sites are being shipped truck loads of Lays brand potato chips.


ANDREW: Apparently a Researcher Brian Cohen was.. upset about a test missing from the authorized test list assigned him by the Foundation Smart Test List Initiative for a slightly luminescent nacho bowl. Previous tests had included.. wearing the bowl, bombarding it with amusingly high levels of secret radiation, and seeing if the bowl made people’s bladder.. weaker.


ANDREW: From the report notes it seems Brian initiated an unauthorized test on the object himself, pouring a bag of chips into the bowl. Despite the bowl showing no anomalous properties during the 300 prior tests, this action caused the entire test chamber to become filled with chips.


ANDREW: Though Researcher Brian Cohen was severely injured during this, he is stable and current recovering. The chips have been deemed safe to consume after additional testing and have been sent out for all to enjoy. So enjoy your free chips everybody! Thanks Researcher Brian!


*CRUNCH OF A POTATO CHIP PLAYS*


ANDREW: And now to the weather-


CARTER: Hello? DJ Scip you in?


ANDREW: Uh, hi? We’re- I’m on the air, didn’t you see the big red light above the door? Hold on a sec…


ANDREW: Let’s go to some SCP music! We have “[REDACTED]’s Lament” by personnel DJ Cynd3r for your listening enjoyment!


*[REDACTED]'S LAMENT STARTS BUT THEN STOPS*


BACKUP SYSTEM: Audio Entertainment [PAUSED] Resuming live feed.


ANDREW: Okay, I went to a song. Now what are you here about? Also, wasn’t that door locked? 


CARTER: Negative, and this will just be a moment. You’re not DJ Scip, have you seen him around though?

ANDREW: No? Cause he got kidnapped? Like, a while ago..

CARTER: Oh. That makes sense a lot of sense actually why he’s missed so many sessions. Or not returned my texts..


ANDREW: Yeah. You didn’t hear the broadcast? Or get the memos about it?


CARTER: Listen, the application of amnestics is not an exact science. Well, it is an exact science, but one that also makes you forget things like what happened last week... Or birthdays... Or how to tie your shoes.


ANDREW: Are you wearing velcro strap shoes?


CARTER: That is neither here nor wherever DJ Scip is! I was just coming by to make sure he was still interested in our S & B sessions.


ANDREW: What is that? Like a Foundation kink group?


CARTER: No! Gods no! It’s like D&D, but for super scientists with enough fantasy in our lives already. It’s great after a long week of monitoring squirrel knights or sending in D-Class to fight in a wild hunt, to just open a beer and pretend to be someone whose only concern is paying their mortgage.


ANDREW: S&B?


CARTER: It stands for Suburbs & Bosses. For 3 to 6 players, everyone drafts up their own persona with normal skills and day jobs. Think of it like a homebrew tabletop version of the Sims games only more social and focused on everyday challenges, and triumphs on a home based level! We meet Thursday at 7 pm in the Site-17 multipurpose room, usually going until about 9PM. Next Thursday though we’re starting at 5 until 7. The room got booked before us for a presentation of the Level 1 Research Staff Laboratory Induction by uh Dr. Eisenberg.


ANDREW: Did you just pitch me? ..Was that a pitch to join your game sessions?


CARTER: I mean, no, not exactly. I might have gotten carried away there a bit.. But would you happen to be interested? You could pick up DJ Scip’s character, Mr. Fax! Part time Teacher, part time lead bass guitarist in a local band? Eh? 


ANDREW: Eh, I’ll think about it. Maybe DJ Scip will be found before the next session and you won’t need me anyways!


CARTER: Let me know before next week then! If you do attend we only ask that everyone bring a snack food item to share. Bag of chips or carrots.


ANDREW: Uh, sure, hey I’m going to get back to this radio show now. Thanks for asking about DJ Scip.


CARTER: Yeah, sure, hope he’s found soon. Wow, kidnapped. I don’t remember the last time I was kidnapped..


ANDREW: Going back to the broadcast now.


CARTER: Of course! Break a leg!


ANDREW: And we’re back! Uh, wait, why was the music paused? Crap, did I leave you guys with dead air for all that? Sorry folks.


*SAD TROMBONE SOUND EFFECT PLAYS*


ANDREW: We love all of our listeners and friends of the Foundation, though maybe hold off on stopping by the broadcasting booth until off air hours. We are always up to hear from you though! You can email Foundation After Midnight Radio at SCP93.FAMRadio@gmail.com!


ANDREW: If you have a Foundation Role Playing group you partake in, how about you tell us about it and what kind of character you play as!


ANDREW: That reminds me actually, here’s the announcement from the infrequent sports corner! Sign ups for the intramural site sports teams are now open! Join a team, get some exercise, and mix with other personnel! 


ANDREW: There’s softball, kickball, cricket, volleyball, soccer, bowling and more activities that are more or less sports! Various leagues for various levels of competition and athletic ability.


ANDREW: As listeners may remember, I’m on the Foundation intramural softball team, the Preserving Pendants! Depending on your site, you might end up with the Critical Tomatoes, the Site-[REDACTED]’s team formerly known as the Unkillable Lizards, the Site-19 Staring Statues, or the Site-66 Vegetables! Errr, veggie-bulls? Vegetabulls!


ANDREW: Get it? Cause their vegeta-


BACKUP SYSTEM: Please enjoy the remaining [THREE] [MINUTES] of audio from [REDACTED’S LAMENT] and a [WORD] from the [CREATOR].


*[REDACTED'S LAMENT] FINISHES*


ANDREW: Finally! This is getting out of hand, going to have to get some of the tech guys in here and turn that that thing off for good! Maybe I can file a Technical Issue with that Technical Researcher David Rosen..


*TAKES NOTE AND SHUFFLES PAPER*


ANDREW: Any personnel who have information on the double containment breach that took place last week are asked to give a statement. An investigation is ongoing as to what caused the hostile biomechanical construct SCP-2427-3 to breach its containment at the same time as a large humanoid originating from the SCP-407 “The Song of Genesis”  test chamber.


ANDREW: While the testing of SCP-407 was scheduled and standard precautions were taken, Dr. Mueller and Dr. Mulligan were sadly killed during the breach. The D-Class personnel, “Connor”  that was recovered at the scene where the two SCPs crossed paths and fortunately neutralized each other had been a part of the test with SCP-407 and he has claimed his mind was invaded during all this. Details on the SCP-2427-3 breach are less clear as all the personnel involved in the daily scheduled goat feeding were killed by the carnivorous, lethal walking cognitohazard.


ANDREW: Any details can help prevent future tragedies like this. You can call and leave a tip at 512-937-2346


ANDREW: Okay, the higher ups want me to spend some time walking about the Groups of Interest or GOIs that the Foundation is aware of and that personnel should keep an eye out for.


ANDREW: Here’s a few of the usual suspects.. Ahem..


ANDREW: Are We Cool Yet?


ANDREW: overview: A collective of anomalous artists, or anartists as some might call them, members of Are We Cool Yet? are either capable of obtaining or producing anomalous objects and using them to create art installations. These are often placed for maximum public exposure, and can be fatal to bystanders; the phrase "Are We Cool Yet?" is almost always present in some way.


ANDREW: The Global Occult Coalition, or the GOC for short.


ANDREW: Overview: The GOC was created in the aftermath of WWII by the Allies, from the various defecting occultists, priests, and scientists from the Nazi, Soviet, and Allied forces. As the world stage broadened, so too did the number of countries that had forces in the GOC, until it became what it is today.


ANDREW: The GOC are a largely political force, seeing themselves as the police of the paranormal world. Priding themselves with destroying supernatural entities, they make use of the most high-tech experimental technology possible. Many potential SCPs have been destroyed by them before the Foundation could secure and contain them.


ANDREW: They have been both on the side of the Foundation and against it at times, depending greatly on the situation. They largely hold the Foundation in contempt for their use and containment of SCP items rather than outright destruction. The GOC has respected the Foundation's formidable might enough to leave it alone, mostly, although there have been some questionable incidents which the GOC have strictly denied involvement with.


ANDREW: All agents of the GOC are to be treated with suspicion.


ANDREW: The Serpent's Hand and the Wanderer’s Library


ANDREW: Overview: The Serpent's Hand is a small but formidable organization though the Foundation’s information on them is limited. Almost all known information about the Serpent's Hand has been leaked from GOC intelligence. The total number of members belonging to this organization is unknown, as is their level of technology, number of possible SCPs held, or total threat level. It is clear, however, they are coordinated and dangerous to deal with. 


ANDREW: The group seems to embrace the use and existence of paranormal items, and in particular seems to embrace humanoid and sentient SCPs. The Serpent's Hand has been highly vocal in criticizing the containment and neutralization of sentient SCPs, especially those which are fully human and are not particularly destructive.


ANDREW: The Serpent's Hand seems primarily based in an anomalous location called the Wanderers' Library, a building accessed through portals found in many different parts of the world. Direct assaults on the Library have so far proven unfeasible, even when entrance could be found. 


ANDREW: Attempts to infiltrate the Wanderers' Library are ongoing. 


ANDREW: That’s our announcement on Groups of Interest to keep vigilant for now.


*SHUFFLES PAPERS*


ANDREW: “Reminder; Pumpkin Spice flavored beverages are strictly prohibited in light of the recent containment of E-8820. For details, please see Site-87 general mail 'Re: Subcutaneous Ginger', sent last Wednesday. Sloth’s Pit Department heads, please notify your teams.”


*ANDREW SIPS A DRINK*


ANDREW: Oh, this is Maple Pecan Spice! I’m sure it’s fine.


ANDREW: Here’s a quick proverb of the day for ya: “If a D-class personnel dies screaming in agony in a containment cell, and no one is in the observation room to document it, do they make a sound?”


ANDREW: Huh.. I wonder if DJ Scip usually proofreads these announcements ahead of time..


ANDREW: Well, good night all you fine Foundation listeners out there. Stay vigilant and stay safe! I’m sure wherever DJ Scip is, we’ll hear from him soon. This has been your Assistant Radio Host, DJ Twisted Toaster.


*AUDIO OUTRO PLAYS*


ANDREW: Toaster.


ANDREW: Toaster.


*END CREDITS PLAY*

DJ SCIP: Hey Andrew, Foundation agents listening to this, I lost my phone when I got grabbed, but I had a backup phone hidden on my person. These guys don’t know who they’re dealing with, almost feel sorry for them. Oh, they’re coming back, gotta go!

**Toadking07's Backstage Notes:**


This was the first episode written solo by Toadking07. I admit, it's not the most exciting of episodes, but this was written over the course of a very long process of reclaiming my energy and time again. Still, while editing this one I had the horrific realization that reading the GOI pages was going to be dull air time for those who already know them by heart. Still, during a crunch for time, I got it done, which is still better than another year of radio silence.


Continuing to introduce new characters and expand the world a bit more. This episode sets up a lot of things to come, so hopefully it'll all pay off as things kick in over the next few broadcasts. This also marks Andrew's second broadcast all by himself. He's slowly but surely getting the hang of it, though all that power of sitting in the rolly chair might be going to his head..


And now you have now caught up with FAM Radio as it stands now. Sorry[[footnote]] Not sorry. [[/footnote]]!It's been a fun few years working on and off it, and I am thankful for old listeners who still remember my original post on the forums and for new listeners who are only now just finding the podcast. I'm at a better place in my life right now and I'm hopeful that I can release more episodes in a more timely manner moving forward.

SFX: *SIREN IN BACKGROUND*

ANOMALOUS HOST: Hello listeners. There is nothing wrong with your radio. Do not attempt to adjust the signal. I control the transmission. I mean, you can totally change the station, if you want, but I'd rather it if you continue listening. I worked so hard to get this broadcast out. It would be a shame if all this commotion, all these broken procedures, these personnel, went to waste..

SFX: MUSIC PLAYS

BACKUP SYSTEM: Anomalous activity [DETECTED]. [WARNING]. Hume level two hundred thirty two, one hundred fifty six, three hundred seventy nine. [ERROR]. [MISTAKE]. [FUCK]. [WARNING]. Frequency lock down in [THREE], [TWO], [TWO], two? Who?

ANOMALOUS HOST: Oh hello there! You remind me of a friend of mine. She likes listing off numbers too. Let’s hold that thought for now though..

SFX: *COMPUTER POWERING DOWN* 

ANOMALOUS HOST: Sorry for all the noise listeners, it's just you and me now. Your favorite radio host. I've, I've missed talking to you all. I've also missed the screaming sun rises and the mysterious lights overhead in the night sky. I've missed my friends, my family, my job, and you!

ANOMALOUS HOST: You see, I’ve been in what they call, “containment” here for a while now. But being an anomalous person of interest held within a vague, yet menacing government agency against his will, isn't all bad. They normally won’t let me near any broadcasting equipment, but I do get my own “standard humanoid containment cell,” as they say. Oh, I guess I should be more clear about who they are.

ANOMALOUS HOST: The Foundation, or the SCP Foundation? Oh I can never remember what they prefer to be called. Sorry if I mess up the name, folks! They came looking for our little desert community a while back. Not sure how they managed it, but they found us and started poking around doing just harmless scientific experiments like taking soil samples, radiation readings, taking pictures of birds taking pictures of them, and falling into chasms that opened up underneath them while local onlookers chanted, “INTERLOPERS”! 

ANOMALOUS HOST: After a while they came by the radio station for a meet and greet with yours truly. Apparently they did not understand how I could narrate their comings and goings from my broadcasting booth. But, as I told them, it’s just another responsibility of a local community radio show host.

ANOMALOUS HOST:After a brief, ummm, encounter with station management, the surviving field agents invited me to come with them by the usual method of putting a bag over my head and taking me with them. 

ANOMALOUS HOST: We got in their unmarked van that read, “SCP Foundation: Scaffolding, Construction, Plumping. We work in the dark so you can live in the light!” License plate number MTF E6VI. Front bumper damaged from ramming into station management on their way out. It is a little unclear who was ramming who, though, to be fair.

ANOMALOUS HOST: Now I’m all for the government protecting citizens. All for securing and protecting people for the good of all. But sometimes a guy just wants to broadcast out into the world and have a one-way conversation with it? You know?

ANOMALOUS HOST: Luckily I'm not alone here. I do get visitors from time to time! The faceless old lady who lives in everyone’s home, she still visits me here! Well, I think she does. I believe that's what the dead flies left in the corner of my containment cell mean.

ANOMALOUS HOST: Who else would take the time to remove their wings, knit the flies little sweaters with letters on them, and arrange them into cute messages like, “COMING FOR YOU” or “SOONER THAN LATER” or “THIS IS TAKING LONGER THAN EXPECTED,” every morning?

OLD WOMAN: *Laughter in background*

ANOMALOUS HOST: I also get to see, well, he told me not to tell anyone, but a certain scientist got himself a new job so he can still see yours truly. We're still working on how to do date nights here, but so far it's been nice just to see him and his beautiful hair through the bullet proof plexiglass. A friendly, handsome face, with perfect teeth, in a cold, but not cruel, world.

ANOMALOUS HOST: But enough about my personal life! This after midnight radio show provides an important service I’m told! Here are some community announcements from within the Foundation.
SFX: *BANGING OF METAL*

CONNOR: AHHHhhhh!

SFX: *CRASH*

CONNOR: Oof, that’s going to hurt tomorrow. Or, right now..

ANOMALOUS HOST: Oh it’s our new station intern, Connor! 

CONNOR: Uh, hey. Here’s the announcements you asked for in your demands.

ANOMALOUS HOST: That’s great, Intern Connor! Thank you for retrieving today’s announcements for me! 

ANOMALOUS HOST: You see listeners, Foundation interns have these nifty bright orange jumpsuits that make them real easy to spot when they’re hiding! The staff had him crawling around in the vents since I barricaded myself in the studio here. 

CONNOR: Yeah and I’m supposed to tell you that they want you to surrender yourself to the mobile task force out there and that they want you to stop broadcasting on every frequency.

ANOMALOUS HOST: Now if you could pass this note along to my husband, 

CONNOR: Sure, but I really want to point out that those guys outside are serious. Like, full combat gear, armed with M4s that have more attachments than an Ita bags. I think there was even a guy with one of those under barrel shotgun attachments. Can you say compensation? Geez.

CONNOR: As well as shit ton of C4 or whatever. 

ANOMALOUS HOST: -and also bring me

CONNOR: That’ll probably blow that door off its hinges. Sealed or not..

ANOMALOUS HOST: a fresh cup of-

CONNOR: Just saying, I wouldn’t want to be in here when that goes off. 

ANOMALOUS HOST: -chicory coffee.

CONNOR: What are you anyway? Euclid? 

ANOMALOUS HOST: Black. 

CONNOR: Keter?

ANOMALOUS HOST: Sugar on the side. 

CONNOR: I definitely don’t believe you’re “Safe” class..

ANOMALOUS HOST: That would be great! 

ANOMALOUS HOST: Whomever last checked the "flesh car," designated R-1415-02, out from Storage 48 for testing, you left the keys in the ignition in the Site 23 parking lot.

ANOMALOUS HOST: While this might be part of an experiment, the fact that it's been winking its eye headlights at passerbyers and licking its seat tongue at pigeons in the parking lot has other researchers unnerved. Please either retrieve the keys or move the flesh vehicle to a less prominent parking space.

ANOMALOUS HOST: This Saturday is the First Divided Fifthist Church’s Annual Pancake Buffet, from ten in the morning until seven in the evening. A raffle will be held after the dinner, and door prizes will be given out throughout the day. Tickets are seven dollars for adults and three dollars for children under 12. Regular, buckwheat, and the First Divided’s famous bonemeal pancakes will be served.

ANOMALOUS HOST: And now to your daily traffic report[[footnote]] Read the full tale read for the traffic report: [http://www.scp-wiki.net/n Time Keeps On Slippin'][[/footnote]]:

ANOMALOUS HOST: Rrrrrrriinng! The alarm in the mall went off, as security officers noticed a young man shoplifting on the cameras. He seemed in no hurry to run, and continued to stow away valuable goods in a few bags.

ANOMALOUS HOST: By the time security had caught up to him, though, he was nowhere to be seen. When the camera footage was reviewed, the man had fiddled with something on his hand, then… just disappeared.

ANOMALOUS HOST: This hadn't been an isolated event. Even a couple of banks had reported thieves. All the accounts had had several things in common; the thief was a young man, he had bypassed all security, then disappeared after fiddling with something on his right hand. Managers and shopkeepers, when questioned, said they couldn't recall any details about the crime, and would prefer to just move past the whole thing. 

ANOMALOUS HOST:  Some people, though, paid very close attention to the crimes indeed. They had all the tapes, all the eye-witness reports. They had waited until they were sure.

ANOMALOUS HOST: Jayun walked down the street, in broad daylight. He wasn't concerned. He'd made sure to cover his face while robbing, and even if someone did recognise him, he had an easy escape route. He tapped the metal under his sleeve.

ANOMALOUS HOST: He was probably just being paranoid, but— Apart from him, there were only two other people on the street. One behind him, walking in the same direction, and one at the end of the street, just standing there.

ANOMALOUS HOST: The one in front pulled a black object out from their pocket and pointed it at him.
 
ANOMALOUS HOST: He wasted no time in pulling the lever, and he thought he heard a bang as he left them behind.

ANOMALOUS HOST:: The world came into view again, this time a small alleyway. He often used this place to escape, as it was located behind some of the major store-lines. The alley was a gap in the city, and it led nowhere. He didn't think anybody else knew about it.
 
ANOMALOUS HOST: Two more people in black proved him wrong on that count.
 
ANOMALOUS HOST:: Before he could react, the one on the left raised their gun and fired at him. As he pulled the lever, he felt something hit his leg.
 
ANOMALOUS HOST: He hadn't had any time to think, so he went with the first place that came into mind: his home. It was some ways away, so he had a lot of time to ponder his next move.
 
ANOMALOUS HOST: And that is our riveting traffic report for today! Time keeps on slipping into the future though, so we'd better move on.

SFX: *Metal bang*
 
ANOMALOUS HOST: Connor! Are you trying to breakdown my barricade?

CONNOR: What? No I was just, uh trying to get out to get you that fresh cup of joe, I mean coffee so, uh- Oh god what are those- 

CONNOR: AHHH! *DEATH SOUND*

SFX: *WEIRD SOUND EFFECT OF TENTACLES KILLING CONNOR*

ANOMALOUS HOST: To the family of station Intern Connor, he was not a very good station intern, but he did-

SFX: *CONNOR POPPING BACK INTO EXISTENCE ALIVE AND UNHARMED*

CONNOR: Listen man-

ANOMALOUS HOST: Oh! Huh. You’re alive! You don’t stay dead, do you? Wow! You’ll definitely make a great station intern after all!

CONNOR: Yeah, it’s a thing. Confinement, look it up. Listen, I’m just following the directions the MTF guys out there told me. 

SERGEANT (THROUGH DOOR):  Connor, what the hell is going on in there? You kick that creepy bastard’s barricade down yet or did you get stuck in the vent again?

CONNOR: I’ll tell them you wouldn’t let me near the barricade if you just push me back into the vents so I can get out of here.

ANOMALOUS HOST: Sure, that’s fine by me. And your dead body, will that just stay behind when you leave?

CONNOR: I mean, you did kill me, so that’s on you.

ANOMALOUS HOST: So you’re not using it anymore?

CONNOR: First off, no I’m not. Second off, that’s a weird thing to say to someone. Also, wait, how is that mic still on? Because the MTF is totally listening to your broadcast and if they hear this-

ANOMALOUS HOST: Oh, they totally can. let me give you a boost!

CONNOR: No, I’m good! Just, oof! Where-where are those coming from? Oof, ahhhhhhh!

SFX: *STRANGE SOUNDS OF TENTACLES PUSHING A MAN BACK INTO A SMALL METAL AIR VENT*

ANOMALOUS HOST: Scrambled right back up into the air vents! That Connor sure is a resilient one.

ANOMALOUS HOST: Ah, never a dull moment here inside this Foundation. Almost reminds me of home. Almost. Sometimes this place is a little too strange though.

ANOMALOUS HOST: Let’s take some time for another popular Foundation After Midnight Radio segment! Listener call-ins! Remember listeners, you can always call in and leave a voicemail at 512-937-2346! That’s 512, 937, 2346! First caller!

VOICEMAIL 1: *PLAYS DISTRESSED WOMAN LOST IN WOODS VOICEMAIL*

ANOMALOUS HOST: Ah, sounds like someone fell through a pocket dimension or otherworldly portal. Or opened a door that appeared in the desert. Either way, there are some nifty tricks out there you can use to figure out where you are using the simple government tracking devices in your phone!

ANOMALOUS HOST: Next voicemail!

VOICEMAIL 2: *PLAYS A MESSAGE BY DJ SCIP *

DJ SCIP: Hey Foundation fam, had another phone I smuggled in on my person. Been a while. I’ve actually lost track of how long I’ve been here now. There are no windows and my guards don’t seem to keep a schedule for meals and such. Amateurs. 

DJ SCIP: Anyway, really want to get out of here soon. Think I hear someone coming back! Talk to you later!

ANOMALOUS HOST: Ah, I think that was the normal host they had. He’s been gone a long time it seems. Years maybe. Or just days? Hard to tell sometimes. Anyways, glad he’s still alive.

VOICEMAIL 3: *PLAYS VOICE MAIL MESSAGE*

ANOMALOUS HOST: Got to say, these Foundation personnel sure know how to run a secret world organization! I mean, I hadn’t even heard of them before they started tapping my phone lines and circling my little town, but now they pop up all over the place!

ANOMALOUS HOST: Ah, here’s another announcement for personnel: If you happen to be driving out late at night and see a police car, please make sure to properly identify it as belonging to the sheriff’s secret police. If the car is on fire, it is most likely a demon cop. If you hear unexplained expletives coming from your radio, I advise speeding up. You might be able to outrun him.

ANOMALOUS HOST: The team formerly known as the Unkillable Lizards played their alternate reality doubles, still known as the Unkillable Lizards in their own timeline, this last weekend! Due to a reality overlap, both teams found themselves being pitted against each other, while a soft ball loving reality bender looked on.

ANOMALOUS HOST: Both teams were evenly matched, with only minor differences such as their depiction of SCP-682, the Hard to Destroy Reptile, as their mascot, or former mascot, as well as various differences noticed between the players and their doppelgangers.

ANOMALOUS HOST: Thankfully, no one attacked their double, but plenty had questions and could be overheard muttering to themselves, “So that’s what I would look like with short hair” or “Is that the more successful me, or is he just more confident in himself?” and “Did they just say that their team captain, Dr. Roth, is a full grown snow leopard in their reality?”

ANOMALOUS HOST: The game ended in a close, 13 to 15 score, or would have, if the combined realities’ mobile task force teams hadn’t descended upon the reality bender in the last inning and chased him off the field before the final pitch with bases loaded! The reality bender out of range of the field and scranton reality anchors in place, the overlap in realities faded from view, and each team went away knowing more about themselves than they would like.

ANOMALOUS HOST: This has been, the infrequent sports corner!

ANOMALOUS HOST: Now listeners you know there's nothing I love more than helping people, and non people, who have a special connection find each other again against all odds. So, yours truly will be reading from the Missed Connections board from the Wanderer's Library![[footnote]] Read more Missed Connections: [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/missed-connections Wanderer's Library Missed Connections] [[/footnote]] 

ANOMALOUS HOST: “You seem pretty normal. M for W.”

ANOMALOUS HOST: We passed each other in the "Early European Section." Your red hair was beautiful and you had the requisite four limbs and one head that I find lacking so often around here. I'd like to get to know you. Maybe we could be friends? It's rare that I find anyone like myself around here, especially after the calamity.

ANOMALOUS HOST: Connections of all kinds are important. We meet people for a reason, a season, or a life sentence.

ANOMALOUS HOST: “Book Buddies! M for W.”

ANOMALOUS HOST: Looking for the girl I shared a copy of "DeBlazian's 4th Metaphilosophy and Contrarian Physical Spaces" with! I was wearing a black turtleneck sans shell, and you had a mug of coffee and tentacles that went all the way up. Winky face emoji.

ANOMALOUS HOST: Shared books can bring people together. Hoarded books can bury people alive! All alone in their apartment because they refused to give up possession of something they thought would bring them comfort but has only become a burden to find the space for.

ANOMALOUS HOST: “The ferocity of the hunt requires a pack! V for M.”
 
ANOMALOUS HOST: This one stalked you through the windblown sands while you were separated from your peers. This one had hoped to hunt you down and consume you while your back was turned and your guard lowered. However this one's assessment of your usefulness as raw protein was changed when this one watched as you gouged out the eyes of a lion with your clawless hands. You are an impressive mammal. We should exchange pleasantries. This one hopes you can detect pheromones.

ANOMALOUS HOST: “Ah, nothing like apex predators bonding over a shared drive to survive and hunt down prey.”
 
ANOMALOUS HOST: “Your hands are so gentle. B for W.”
 
ANOMALOUS HOST: You were reading me the other day in the Eschatology section. I'm the one with the thick leather binding, gold leaf illumination, and vellum pages. You had very gentle hands. I would like to meet again. Mayhaps we can read some more? Speak with Bobby if you see this, he delivered this message for me.
 
ANOMALOUS HOST: Book love goes both ways. Again, it’s always important to find people we care about in this journey of life. Whether platonic, romantic, or just finding shared interests among peers. There’s a Foundation Missed Connections page up as well, for personnel looking for someone they passed in the halls, lost touch with after a site transfer, or someone they vaguely remember after a temporal shift rewrote a year of their life!

ANOMALOUS HOST: In other community public service announcements, most tarantulas don't finish high school and even fewer go on to attend college. Now I’m sure most of you within the Foundation already knew this. 

ANOMALOUS HOST: What you may not know is that the Foundation already houses and supports several sentient spiders and spider related communities! From the tiny psychic spider, to the vast communist spider society in the Big Thicket National Park, to the 11, three meter spiders of the Kemberly sleepover. 

ANOMALOUS HOST: Personnel can volunteer to tutor young spiders during their lunch break or after work hours on site. Obviously, those with arachnophobia need not apply, and may want to skip the Site 66 cafeteria after-

SFX:*CRACKLE OF METAL BEING CUT*

SFX: *SECURITY SHOUTING FROM BEHIND THE DOOR*

SERGEANT (THROUGH DOOR): Time to get paid people! No one lives forever!

ANOMALOUS HOST: Ah well, seems like I have some visitors coming in.

ANOMALOUS HOST (AWAY FROM MIC): I’ll be with you folks in a minute!

ANOMALOUS HOST: I swear these Foundation personnel are more uptight than our Station Management back home..

ANOMALOUS HOST: Now might be a good time to go to the weather!

*PLAYS The King by The Atomic Beau Project*

BACKUP SYSTEM: Anomalous activity [SUBSIDED]. Humes at [ACCEPTABLE] levels. Broadcast is [SAFE] for audio listening [ENJOYMENT]. Welcome back.

SFX: DJ TWISTED TOASTER INTRO MIX

ANDREW: Never uneventful around here, eh listeners? The anomalous entity that escaped and hijacked the radio booth has been secured and recontained. No dangerous memetic or cogni-hazardous effects were detected during the broadcast, though they were unable to disrupt his signal despite cutting power to the booth.

ANDREW: Unfortunately, cutting the power only made getting back into the radio station that much harder, largely due to the newly reinforced security doors added since DJ Scip’s kidnapping. They ended up having to cut through the doors manually, after trying to send in a D-Class through the air vents a few times.

ANDREW: While the Foundation is a place that accepts all kinds, it is generally too dangerous to work directly with anomalous persons of interest. The risk of cross SCP contamination is too great. The Foundation’s firm stance is that anomalous entities should be contained and never allowed to wander sites unsupervised under any-

CONNOR: Hey, so uh, the door was literally off the hinges, I let myself in. Is that weird guy that was doing the radio broadcast before gone?

ANDREW: Oh, uh, hey Connor, yeah, uh, he’s gone. I’m just starting the After Midnight Radio broadcast.

CONNOR: Well that’s great. I’m just gonna put this coffee down and go then. Gonna go see Natalie.

ANDREW: Who-?

CONNOR: Dr. Powers? One of the psychologists? She-

ANDREW: Oh, I meant, who is this coffee for?

CONNOR: Well it was for that reality bender guy who was in here before, but since he’s probably back in the containment wing, I’m not going to bring it to him. They sent me in here to see what his demands were, but it seems he just, really loved radio broadcasting. They should give him his own show. Or at least a podcast..

ANDREW: Uh, thanks, Connor. Going back to broadcasting.

SFX: *COFFEE BREAK SOUND BOARD EFFECT*

ANDREW: What was I talking about again?

[[tab Backstage]]
Toadking07's Backstage Notes:

So this episode was a long time coming, in that it took a very long time to finish. The original script was started shortly after episode 08 was posted, but after that, life got in the way. The script dragged along and hit several bumps before being put on the backburner, revamped, and pushed to the finish line.

I had a lot of personal drama going on in my life in 2018 that made being creative and productive increasingly difficult. Think of your day as having a limited number of points you can put towards actions. When you're at your best, you have a lot of points to put into things, maybe even more than you need. When you're stressed, anxious, depressed, you have less than you need to get even the basic actions you need for your day. I spent a lot of the year without enough points and then building myself up to a point where I could finally have the points I needed again.

The podcast is a lot of work to produce. I put my Patreon on hold, I worked on smaller projects I could complete, I picked away at the script. I restarted the script after a suggestion to scrap what I had and figure out a script that I would enjoy writing again. Thus the idea to make an episode that was basically one big WtNV reference.

Night Vale is what originally inspired me to produce FAM Radio. For some, this might be pretty clear, others might not have known if I didn't acknowledge it. I discovered their podcast shortly after they started it and loved it. It came during a time in my life when I was directionless, without a place to call my own, no job, no girlfriend, nothing really. I had just found the SCP wiki and lost a few days to reading articles and tales. The two made so much sense together that I couldn't help but try my hand at it. Both then, and now.

I might have got carried away with this episode. Maybe I shot too big, or made it too on the nose. I have no idea what WtNV thinks or would think of this episode. I reached out to a voice actor from their podcast about voicing something for my episode, but they turned it down, saying it was basically, "Night Vale fanfiction." I went through two different voice actors before finding a solid anomalous host voice in a coworker from my day job.

There were other delays along the way, things that delayed production or complicated finishing it. But it exists now, it's out there, and I am so happy for it. We did a live stream premiere of the episode which was a lot of fun. Hoping to do that again in the future. Here's to never giving up on a project, finding what inspires you, and making the best of something you can!

+ Characters and Universe
[[tabview]]
[[tab Recurring Characters]]
**DJ SCIP**
Host of Foundation After Midnight Radio, he is the ever optimist and always looking on the bright side of things. Whether he's reporting on a dimensional rift in the cafeteria, the end of the world, his own kidnapping, or a tickle goo monster running around the site! He is the usual voice you hear bringing site announcements, PSAs, and containment breach updates to you after the midnight hour.


**Andrew Alexeev** aka DJ Twisted Toaster
Also known as the Assistant/Possible Replacement, Assistant DJ, or DJ Twisted Toaster, Andrew helps Scip with the broadcasts and behind the scenes running of the show. He handles a lot of the grunt work like transcribing the show that DJ Scip often neglects. Andrew was an agent before coming to the FAM Radio booth, and he's happy with the quieter job, even if he's not sure about some of the broadcasts.
[[/tab]]
[[tab Other Characters]]
**Backup System**
If a radio broadcast is not sent out after a set amount of time, protocol "Empty Seat" is initiated and the Backup System voice goes live, fulfilling the role of a radio host until it detects someone else. Currently acting up and overriding controls, seemingly on their own, the Backup System hops in from time to time still.


**Dr. Belford**
Researcher with a lot on her plate in the Memetics Department and less than punctual co-workers, she's got way too much to do and way too little time for nonsense like "taking a break" or heading out for the "weekend" as others tend to do. She was supposed to give an on-air interview with DJ Scip, but he was not around.


**Researcher Carter**
A man who has had more than his fair share of run-ins with amnestics. Forgetful, absent minded, but still a fun guy to play some Suburbs and Bosses with on a Thursday night! He's probably given more to the Foundation than he'll ever remember.

**Connor**
Anomalous test subject who respawns after a fatal injury. Popping back into existence near by with all his memories and body intact. See more of his adventures in the Confinement series by Lord Bung.

A mod for Fallout: New Vegas to add a radio station that plays FAM Radio broadcasts. 
By JustAnotherNerd. [*https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/64539?tab=description link]

[[tab Wishlist]]
Here is my [https://media1.tenor.com/images/3d3c98e128839ce17b19fadacec358ab/tenor.gif?itemid=7246089 amazon wishlist] if you buy me... JK! BUT WAIT, there is actually a wishlist, //for// the series!


Here you'll find things that I would love to see done for use in FAM Radio. These things might be outside of my own skill set, or just would distract too much from getting the next episode done, or maybe I just want to see what you all can do! If someone does one of the items, wonderful! Celebrations! Let me know and I'll be forever thankful and credit you whenever it's used! If no one ever does an item, oh well, it's a wishlist and these things would be nice but not necessary for future episodes.

**WARNING! MAY INCLUDE MINOR SPOILERS FOR FUTURE PLOT DEVELOPMENTS!**


__**Current wishlist for FAM Radio:**__


# Audio intro for DJ Twisted Toaster to play in ep 09. An evolution of [*https://youtu.be/4MfOb0mWSN0?t=19m28s this]. Audio files can be [*https://www.dropbox.com/sh/nkxduo7n9udn7ra/AADZdYijSIAFvvD7ZW59_4Lsa?dl=0 downloaded here] to use, though feel free to also create something completely new! Short and sweet, style is an over the top DJ using a few too many sound effects and filters.
# Artwork of what SCP-682 looked like after being shot into space and transforming into a "solar serpent" during the Foundation Space Program. Likely wouldn't be seen in episode, but would love to see artist renderings of what it looked like.
# Transcribing the final episodes as they appear on Youtube and Soundcloud is something that has been requested and I would love to see happen for all the episodes. A few I have added captions to on Youtube, though the auto closed captions Youtube generates are complete rubbish. This takes a decent amount of time and patience as but helps listeners who are hard of hearing as well as international listeners who want to translate scripts to their own language. I believe Youtube allows transcripts to be submitted/uploaded on each episode, otherwise Google Docs might be the best bet.


Please send all finished items to the email address, SCP93.FAMRadio(at)gmail.com and be sure to let me know how to credit you!

[[tab Note]]
One //more// thing before you go.


This hub got away from me. In Google Drive it's over 95 pages with all the scripts, credits, lists, and wiki text code. I'll be keeping this updated as time goes on, though sometimes I may fall behind on that. Simple spelling or credit corrections are welcome. If you have any comments or issues, feel free to get in touch with me, [[*user toadking07]], about it and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.


If anyone is interested in submitting their own announcements or calling in and leaving a voicemail as a character, you are always welcome to send stuff in! We try very hard to work in as much as we can into episodes, but sometimes things just don't fit right. Some submissions find their way in //years// later though, so don't lose hope if you don't hear yourself in there in the next episode.


And lastly, a big thank you goes out to the SCP community, the site staff, and the SCP fandom at large. This podcast literally wouldn't exist without you all. FAM Radio is only what it is because there's so much to pull from and weave into each episode. We're constantly reading new content being made and getting inspired to try to work it into a new broadcast. Here's to growing and making more cool things in the Foundation-verse.


So thanks and stay tuned.
