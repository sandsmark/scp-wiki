**Item #:** SCP-1260

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the nature of SCP-1260, full containment is impossible. At no point is exploration or testing permitted aboard SCP-1260. The waters around the vessel are to be under constant satellite surveillance. Any vessel attempting to navigate the waters within a 20 km radius of SCP-1260 is to be diverted by Foundation personnel aboard the SCPS //Cassandra//. In the event that contact with SCP-1260 is lost due to a containment breach or emergency relocation, the next ocean in SCP-1260's location cycle is to be monitored until SCP-1260’s GPS beacon reappears. At this time, the Foundation vessel assigned to SCP-1260 in that ocean will immediately be redeployed to allow continued containment. These vessels are the SCPS //Cassandra//, SCPS //Melampus// and the SCPS //Polyeidos// for the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans respectively.

**Description:** SCP-1260 is a 18th century 42 gun Royal Navy 5th rate frigate entitled the HMS //Tiresias// currently adrift in the southern Pacific Ocean.  Despite the ship’s age the vessel appears to be in perfect sailing condition. 

Aboard SCP-1260 reside the skeletal remains of the ship’s original 2██ crewmen in addition to a total of ██ other individuals and the █ Foundation agents lost during Exploration 1. A majority of these remains lie fully intact upon the ship’s gun decks or within SCP-1260’s hold. All clothing and equipment recovered from SCP-1260 continue to function as normal despite age and environmental exposure.

Twenty minutes following any boarding of SCP-1260 a large bank of fog will begin to gather around the ship with a radius of 1 km. This fog fully encloses the ship an additional 15 minutes later at which point all electronic devices aboard issuing a transmission will cease to function. Any subject still aboard SCP-1260 at this time will become irretrievable.

The fog will dissipate ten minutes after SCP-1260 is fully enveloped. At this point the subject will have vanished along with anything aboard the ship at the time of encasement. SCP-1260 will reappear in a random site in the next major ocean 2 to 12 weeks later, moving from east to west as it circles the globe. At this time all human life aboard the ship at the time of its disappearance will be among the skeletal remains. To date there has been no instance of SCP-1260 appearing in the Arctic or Southern Oceans.

Exploration attempts have shown that the ship’s cargo hold has been completely emptied of food and that messages have been carved into a large percentage of the ship’s interior surface area. The captain’s log has been recovered, though no abnormalities were reported in any of the entries. No evidence exists to suggest pages were removed from the log prior to discovery. 

**Addendum: 1260-01: Exploration Logs:**

[[collapsible show="+ Exploration Logs" hide="- Exploration Logs"]]
**Exploration 1:**

> //SCP-1260 is adrift in the South Indian Ocean. Exploration Team 1 consists of █ Foundation Agents. Each is equipped with a headset providing an audio feed to Control aboard the SCPS Melampus. A video feed from aboard the Melampus captures the exploration in progress. The exploration team approaches SCP-1260 in a raft.//
> 
> **Team Leader:** Attention //Melampus//, we have just made contact with the //Tiresias//. Preparing to board now.
> 
> //Exploration team boards SCP-1260 from the starboard side.//
> 
> **Team Leader:** Alright //Melampus//, we are now aboard the vessel. We have visual on several sets of human remains. All skeletal.
> 
> **SCPS //Melampus//:** Do we have a count on how many bodies?
> 
> **Team Leader:** From an estimate I’d say over twenty on this deck alone. We will need more time to provide a more accurate count.
> 
> **SCPS //Melampus//:** Roger that. Please continue to search the ship. Report any anomalous findings.
> 
> //Exploration team begins to search SCP-1260, venturing into the vessel’s interior. 15 minutes pass since boarding.//
> 
> **Team Leader:** Alright //Melampus//, we have a count. There appear to be 2██ total bodies scattered throughout the ship. 2██ appear to be a mixture of period sailors and Royal Marines. We also count ██ other individuals from a variety of eras. At least █ of these guys are French marines from the same period. We also have a variety of fishermen.
> 
> **SCPS //Melampus//:** Very good. Have you searched the cargo hold yet?
> 
> **Team Leader:** We have. It is completely emptied of food though all other supplies are untouched. Nothing appears to have aged a day. I wouldn’t be surprised if you could still light the gun powder.
> 
> **SCPS //Melampus//:** Strange, is this effect only concentrated on the cargo hold?
> 
> **Team Leader:** Negative, it’s the whole ship. The entire vessel appears to have taken no damage despite how long it has been at sea. It’s in perfect sailing condition. Even the clothing and weapons we found on the bodies haven’t decayed.
> 
> **SCPS //Melampus//:** Roger. Have any other anomalies been spotted?
> 
> **Team Leader:** None yet, but the entire interior of this place is covered in carved messages.
> 
> **SCPS //Melampus//:** Noted. Please make sure to document those messages you deem important. Have you located the captain’s log yet?
> 
> **Team Leader:** Negative. We’re combing the ship for it now. We’ll let you know when we find it.
> 
> //Exploration team continues to search SCP-1260. 30 minutes pass since boarding. Fog has begun to gather around SCP-1260 for the past 15 minutes.//
> 
> **Team Leader:** Hey //Melampus//. Do you know anything about this fog? We are beginning to lose visual on you.
> 
> **SCPS //Melampus//:** Affirmative. Our equipment detects that it has so far gathered only around the ship. Return to the //Melampus// when the captain’s log has been found.
> 
> //Fog continues to gather around SCP-1260 until it is fully encased. At this time, all of the exploration team transmitting devices go dead. Attempts to regain contact fail. Ten minutes later the fog dissipates. SCP-1260 has vanished.//



**Exploration 2:**

> //SCP-1260 is adrift in the North Atlantic. Exploration Team 2 consists of █ Foundation Agents. Each is equipped with a headset providing an audio feed to Control aboard the SCPS Polyeidos. A video feed from aboard the SCPS Polyeidos captures the exploration in progress. The exploration team approaches SCP-1260 in a raft. A GPS tracker has been provided for attachment to SCP-1260’s hold.//
> 
> **Team Leader:** Attention //Polyeidos//, we have just made contact with the SCP-1260. No signs of Team 1 are visible. Preparing to board now.
> 
> **SCPS //Polyeidos//:** Roger, Team 2. Team 1’s tracker is still active according to our equipment. Please board the ship and locate any remains of Team 1. We will have you abandon ship in the event that the fog reappears.
> 
> //Exploration team boards SCP-1260 from the port side.//
> 
> **Team Leader:** Alright //Polyeidos//, we are now aboard the vessel. The message “Beware the fog,” has been carved across a majority of the deck. This was not reported by Team 1, correct?
> 
> **SCPS //Polyeidos//:** Correct. That is new. Please document this and any other changes in the ship that you discover. 
> 
> **Team Leader:** Roger. We have also located Team 1 Leader’s remains propped against the mainmast. His beacon is active and he is clutching what appears to be the captain’s log in his hands.
> 
> **SCPS //Polyeidos//:** Excellent. Recover the log for study. Have your team continue to search the ship for the remainder of Team 1 and attach the GPS tracker to the ship’s hold. 
> 
> //Exploration team continues to search SCP-1260, venturing into the vessel’s interior. 25 minutes pass since boarding. Fog has begun to appear around the ship//
> 
> **Team Leader:** We have located all █ agents. █ were found on the top deck, █ in the cargo hold and █ in the various gun decks. All bodies have now been recovered and the GPS tracker has been fixed to the cargo hold.
> 
> **SCPS //Polyeidos//:** Roger. Fog has become visible. Please have your team return to the boarding craft immediately. 
> 
> //Exploration team returns to their boarding craft. 30 minutes pass since boarding. Fog has begun to gather around SCP-1260 for the past 10 minutes. Exploration team returns to SCPS Polyeidos without incident. SCP-1260 is fully encased in fog an additional 5 minutes later. At this time the GPS tracker ceases to issue a signal. Ten minutes later the fog dissipates. SCP-1260 has vanished.//

**Addendum: 1260-02: Agent ████’s Note :**
[[collapsible show="+ Agent ████’s Note" hide="- Agent ████’s Note"]]
//The following was recovered written in the back of the Captain’s log://

    
> I’m writing this in the hope that the Foundation will find it again. I doubt I’ll be alive for debriefing considering what has already happened to ████████, ██████ and ████, so please excuse me if I’m a little informal.
> 
> We remained encased in fog god knows how long before it dissipated. We were then spit out in a different place, though I can’t say where. The sea is black as ink. Our lights don't penetrate the surface so we have no idea what the fuck lurks below. The sky is also pitch black. No stars or moon. If it wasn’t for our flashlights we would be totally in the dark. Not that it really matters considering how royally screwed we are.
> 
> 	We hear whispers in the distance, soothing at first but over time they become more sinister. None of us can make out where they are coming from, but what they say to us is crystal clear. They call to us. They call us by name, and tempt us with personal details about our lives. They ask me about my daughter and my wife. They ask me if I miss them and if I’m strong enough to see them again. I have tried to respond, but they don’t reply. I don’t know what the fuck they want from me.
> 
> 	I have personally flipped through the Captain’s log, but there is absolutely nothing here to indicate the captain or the crew had anything to do with this. The final log puts the crew on a mission to investigate pirate attacks in the East Indian Ocean, with good conditions. I doubt the Foundation will ever find out how the //Tiresias// became what it is today or where we even are.
> 
> 	I don’t have too much strength to continue writing. Each of us has been dying since we arrived. The victims slowly wither away. The body then rots a few hours later, leaving only clothing and bones behind. So far three of us have gone. I know that I'm going to be next.
> 
> 	I have placed myself against the mainmast with the log in my hands. I only hope that I have shed some light on this monstrosity. Hopefully I prevent other agents from being sent to this fate. The voices call my name again.
> 
> 		Agent ████, Team Leader, Exploration Team 1
