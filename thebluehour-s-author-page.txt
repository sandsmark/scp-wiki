**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-BLUE does not currently require any containment procedures. In the event that containment of SCP-BLUE becomes necessary, it is to be contained via the following method:
@@@@
1. All available staff are to begin jumping up and down on SCP-BLUE's back. 
@@@@
2. [[[SCP-096]]] is to be thrown into the fires of Mount Doom.  
@@@@
3. Dr. Bright is to perform [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-231-j Procedure 110-Montauk] on [REDACTED].
@@@@
4. [[[SCP-3999]]] is to beat Researcher Talloran over the head with a one-point-five (1.5) meter --titanium-- steal rod while screeching ''ni'' in the loudest, most annoying voice possible for all eternity (∞). 
@@@@
5. Jeff the Killer is to be stabbed to death with a fish knife then have his body dumped in a ditch besides a Massachusetts highway. 
@@@@
6. The sun is to be destroyed by any means available. 
@@@@
7. All data in this containment procedure is to be expunged and replaced with disinformation. 
@@@@

It is currently unknown why this procedure is capable of neutralizing SCP-BLUE's anomalous abilities, but its effectiveness was proven during Incident-BLUE-666.

**Description:** Hello, I'm [[*user TheBlueHour]]. I first learned of SCP through the TVtropes website. Being a life-long lover of ghost stories, spooky stuff and everything weird, I was almost instantly hooked and have been a fan ever since. I started writing around February 2019, before finally managing to get my first piece up in May. Since then I've been trying to write more stuff for this site so I'll have something to do in my last two years of collage. That's it really.

**[[[SCP-4913]]], Five Star [REDACTED]**

My first surviving SCP. The story behind this one is pretty funny, I randomly thought it up one day when I was waiting for the bus and liked the idea enough to work on a draft for it. I decided that the idea couldn't work, so I abandoned it and worked on some other stuff for a bit. Weeks later, I looked at the draft again and I liked it so I decided to start it up again and managed to get it posted. It's a pretty small-scale skip, but I'm pretty happy with the way this one turned out.

**[[[SCP-4373]]], Drown** (collab with [[*user Nameless Mediocre]])

While trying to think of the most ludicrous GOI combination possible I came up with Pattern Screamers X SPC. I originally had a pitch for an idea that was more a direct SPC version of [[[SCP-3930]]], Nameless was the one who came up with the awesome Shark Paralyzer thing. Nameless added the video logs and the last email, and I worked on the interview log, the first email and editing the whole thing. This collab was a ton of fun and is my personal favorite of my articles so far.

[[tab Tales]]

**[http://www.scp-wiki.net/empty-ocean Empty Oceans]** (collab with [[*user Nameless Mediocre]])

This was my first Tale, a short action story involving sharks and Pattern Screamers. I feel we could have done a bit more for Collabcon, but the Tale itself I had a ton of fun writing. [[*user Nameless Mediocre]] was a blast to work with. If you're seeing this Nameless, thank you!

**[http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-streamliner The Streamliner]**

My longest piece to write so far. I originally intended to submit this for Jamcon's Pulp Fiction theme, but couldn't get enough crit in time. Originally this story was just going to be the fight scene, but after showing some people it I realized that the ending makes no sense if you haven't read SCP-4455. So I massively expanded everything so that the Streamliner's power would be revealed in the story itself. This was a ton of fun to write even if it took millions of years to finish!

**[http://www.scp-wiki.net/spc-3871-j SPC-3871]**

I have mixed feelings about this one. On one hand it is pretty fun (IMO at least) and I enjoyed writing it, but on the other hand I feel that getting a few more people to crit it would have been a good idea. This was written entirely to justify the punchline at the end. I originally just thought of a gag based on something about the GOC's Orange Suits and then wrote an entire article around it.
