**Item #:** SCP-1217

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** A barbed-wire fence, with a single gate to allow authorised access, is to be maintained in an area surrounding SCP-1217’s active zone, around which several signs, warning of highly toxic substances being present, are to be placed in clear view. Several CCTV cameras are set up in a perimeter around SCP-1217’s active zone, monitored by a nearby Observation Post (OP 1217-Alpha). A minimum of two guards are to be present at this station at all times, and any individuals attempting to enter SCP-1217 are to be detained, interviewed, and – if they present no clear threat – released after being provided with a Class-C amnesiac.

Several enclosed rooms near the entrance of SCP-1217-1 have been modified and equipped with observational equipment to serve as testing chambers – any experimentation involving SCP-1217-2 is to take place only in these designated areas (please refer to Document 1217-A). Subjects should be placed into these chambers, released, and monitored. After the experiment is complete, the refuse is to be removed and disposed of via incineration.

**Description:** SCP-1217 consists of two parts:

* SCP-1217-1, formerly an office complex owned by the █████████ Corporation, located in [REDACTED], Massachusetts, US. The 250 m × 300 m area surrounding SCP-1217-1 is considered SCP-1217’s active zone.

* SCP-1217-2, any member of the species //Felis catus// which enters SCP-1217’s active zone.

Upon entering the aforementioned area, a specimen of SCP-1217-2 will display no significant behavioural deviations from its previous activity, apart from the fact that subjects of SCP-1217-2 will remain within the active zone of SCP-1217, and will respond aggressively to any attempts to remove it from said area. Removal is still possible; however, successfully removing a subject from the area will not prevent the anomalous event associated with SCP-1217 from occurring.

Fifteen to twenty minutes after entering the area, specimens will begin acting in a notably erratic manner, which typically involves spontaneous pouncing and vocalising. Several minutes after this, subjects will protract their claws and attempt to repeatedly lacerate their underbelly. Shortly after this begins, specimens will (if unimpeded) successfully disembowel themselves, despite pain, shock or other associated sensations which would result from this.

The viscera and blood released from this process will invariably form itself into a shape resembling a short, semi-coherent sentence, consisting of English characters. Said messages display no consistency between instances of SCP-1217-2, in addition to showing occasional notable spelling and grammatical incorrectness. The text constituting these sentences largely consists of blood, which will retain this shape if left undisturbed, until drying; however, extracts of other organs – particularly the colon and intestinal tracts – have been known to fold in such a way to form appropriate letters if cut from the original lacerations, though this is a rare occurrence. Excess tissue does not appear to be affected, and pools normally a short distance away from the remaining substance. The method by which the aforementioned viscera assumes shape of coherent text is currently unknown.

The anomalous properties of SCP-1217 came to the attention of the Foundation on 2005-██-██, when a stray cat entered its active zone before initiating typical behaviour in front of several █████████ employees. The building was then transferred into Foundation possession, relevant witnesses were administered Class-B amnesiacs, and a cover-story regarding the discovery and continued removal of asbestos within the building was released.

**Excerpt from Document 1217-B:** //Note: The following are copied as accurately as possible from the original text, produced as a result of successive tests. For an extensive log of all messages produced, please refer to the relevant documentation.//

__Test ███__
> Is thsi it?

__Test ███__
> why can't it?

__Test ███__
> Can I play too?

Between Tests █81 and █87, the text produced by SCP-1217 began deviating significantly from its previously established pattern, as follows:

__Test █80__
> what happens now?

__Test. █81__
> I’m sick of doing this.

__Test █82__
> I’m sick of letting them talk.

__Test █83__
> I want to stop for now.

__Test █84__
> Stop it.

__Test █85__
> STOP IT!

__Test █86__
> STOP IT!

__Test █87__
> STOP IT!

Shortly after this, Dr. ███████ requested an extended reprieve from experimentation, which was approved by O5-█. Testing was stopped between 20██-04-██ and 20██-07-██, at which point it was resumed. The resulting text appears to be consistent with the usual pattern of that produced by SCP-1217:

__Test █88__
> i’m so sorry.

__Test █87__
> it's all lost.

__Test █89__
> its hurts so much.

The item’s Object Class was upgraded to Euclid on 20██-07-██.
