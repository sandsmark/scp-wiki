**Item #:** SCP-162 

**Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP-162 is to be kept in a sealed steel container at all times. Any handling is to be done with thick steel-plate gloves and heavy body armor. Any personnel attempting to touch the item without proper protection or acting in an erratic or non-responsive manner, is to be immediately removed from the containment area. All personnel are to submit to mental testing and review for two weeks after interaction with #162. 

**Description:** 

SCP-162 is a mass of fish hooks, fish line, needles, scissors and other sharp objects in a rough ball shape close to eight feet across and seven feet tall. After being in SCP-162's vicinity, subjects have reported feeling drawn to the object in order to touch it. Subjects have been seen stating they do not wish to touch it even as they touch it. This desire can extend for several weeks after seeing the item, becoming an obsession in many cases. 

Touching SCP-162 will immediately result in several hooks becoming embedded in the subject's skin. The experience is extremely painful, much more so than normal fish hooks. Struggling or attempting to escape will ensnare the subject more, likely resulting in the subject's complete entrapment on the surface of #162. Subject will bleed profusely; resulting in death after a prolonged period of time. 

Attempting to remove a subject from SCP-162 will result in the entrapment of the remover, or gross bodily harm to the subject's flesh.
