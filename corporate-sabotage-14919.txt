Pipe had been inaccessible for some time due to heightened activity of invasive Asian carp species.

DESCRIPTION:

[[row]]
[[cell style="border: 1px solid black;  padding: 0 1%" colspan="2"]]
Unknown saboteurs blocked an important drainage pipe, causing setbacks in the form of monetary and efficiency loss due to damage. This was not immediately apparent due to the agitated state of an invasive species that has colonized the drainage area in the Ohio River Basin. By the time proper assessment took place, the pipe had become irreparably damaged, and needed to be completely shut off for repairs. This resulted in monetary loss as orders were unable to be wholly filled during repairs.

An unknown number of saboteurs accessed the primary wastewater piping in the middle of the night and blocked it using a combination of mud, rebar, and water plants.

As a result of the sabotage, piping efficiency fell to below expected parameters.

Worker Walter Pesek was sent to the problem area to directly identify the cause of efficiency loss and handle any discovered issues.

Animal interference by wild invasive carp resulted in Worker Walter Pesek's inability to perform a proper inspection.

Worker Walter Pesek was unable to properly identify the cause of efficiency reduction, and retreated after sustaining critical damage to the head and hands.

Worker Henrik Darby was sent to asses the piping after being equipped as per animal interference protocols.
[[/cell]]
[[/row]]

[[row]]
[[cell style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%"]]
Animal interference was diminished after execution of standard protocols, and then increased past the previous parameters. Interference was further enhanced by non-standard attachments to the carp. All attachments appeared to be composed of miscellaneous sharp objects and endemic flora.
[[/cell]]
[[cell style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%"]]
After repeated executions of standard protocol for wildlife interference, the provided wildlife pacifying equipment was used incorrectly. Worker Henrik Darby was severely damaged, and unable to properly assess the piping.[[footnote]]
@@@@
> Employees should be reminded that all provided equipment is only to be used in the appropriate situations. Due to misuse of equipment, Worker Henrik Darby's contract has been extended to recompense the loss.[[/footnote]]

After sustaining repairs, Worker Walter Pesek was sent back to the pipe to assess the damage. Security Officer Dianne Ainsworth and Security Officer Erika Payne accompanied Worker Walter Pesek to prevent further damage.

Animal interference began as soon as Worker Walter Pesek entered the vicinity. All wildlife exhibited non-standard attachments at this point.
[[/cell]]
[[cell style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%"]]
Upon arrival at the pipe, Security Officer Erika Payne began to enact enhanced wildlife pacification protocols, which immediately ceased interference. Worker Walter Pesek was able to perform an appropriate inspection of the pipe. The blockage was unremovable due Worker Walter Pesek's formatting at that time. However, this was irrelevant due to severe corrosion and water damage in the piping. The assessment confirmed that the piping would need to be shut off and repaired as soon as possible to minimize the chances of a burst. The Factory agreed, and committed the nearest worker to the repair process.

Before Worker Walter Pesek could finish merging with the pipe, the wildlife resumed their activity. One of the wildlife, a carp with unusual coloration and a harpoon attachment, directly contacted Security Officer Erika Payne. The resulting damage was prevented from negatively impacting Security Officer Erika Payne's employment, however, Security Officer Erika Payne entered the watershed. [[footnote]]
@@@@
> When Security Officer Erika Payne's remains have been reconstituted from the wildlife in the surrounding Great Miami River area, she will be offered a promotion in light of her exceptional actions in managing the wildlife issue.[[/footnote]]
[[/cell]]

[[cell style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%"]]
Security Officer Dianne Ainsworth continued to follow wildlife pacification protocols until multiple direct contacts with interfering carp resulted in entry into the watershed, despite the provision of appropriate peacekeeping equipment.[[footnote]] 
@@@@
> We would like to remind security that the proper usage of peacekeeping equipment is on those who require subduing, and not on oneself, especially when surrounded. In light of her actions, Security Officer Dianne Ainsworth has been remanded to retraining as soon as she is retrieved from the Great Miami River area. [[/footnote]] Upon entering the watershed, Security Officer Dianne Ainsworth and Security Officer Erika Payne sustained severe damage due to wildlife interference. Worker Walter Pesek could not complete repairs before being critically interfered with.[[footnote]] 
@@@@
> We would like to thank Worker Walter Pesek for very nearly fulfilling his duty in spite of interference. Thanks to his actions, the consequences of the pipe's sabotage were much less detrimental than they could have been. Worker Walter Pesek will be offered a promotion to a management position after he returns to a solid-state form.[[/footnote]]

Due to the current difficulty in repairing the damaged piping, it has been deemed most monetarily efficient to reroute the watewater piping to a new area. The Factory is currently working with the Ohio State Government to ensure that the new piping is most satisfactory and efficient to all members of the company, as well as being updated with the most recent anti-saboteur technology.
