**Item #:** SCP-4514

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4514 is to be held in a standard Safe-Class container. SCP-4514 is only to be used with the approval of the O5 council.

**Description:** SCP-4514 refers to a very pointy yucca plant. SCP-4514's anomalous properties are known to manifest should it:

* Stab an individual


--Investigation is underway to discover additional ways to trigger SCP-4514's anomalous properties.--

Should an individual be injured by SCP-4514 in such a way that activates its anomalous properties, that individual will die.[[footnote]] Caused by aggressive scratching of the stabbed area.[[/footnote]] 

**Experiment Log:**

> **Experiment #:** 1
> 
> **Subject:** D-3314, 36-year-old caucasian female, healthy
> 
> **Procedure:** Subject is asked to touch the yucca plant.
> 
> **Result:** Subject refuses, citing that the yucca plant is pointy and they do not want to be poked.

Testing was halted due to concerns that being stabbed by a yucca plant is unpleasant.
