**Item #:** SCP-4514

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4514 is to be held in a standard Safe-Class container. SCP-4514 is only to be used with the approval of the O5 council.

**Description:** SCP-4514 refers to a standard switch knife. SCP-4514's anomalous properties are known to manifest should it:

* Injure an individual such that they lose 40% of their blood
* Injure an individual to cause significant damage to the brain
* Injure an individual to cause significant damage to the heart
* Injure an individual such that they are incapable of respiration

--Investigation is underway to discover additional ways to trigger SCP-4514's anomalous properties.--

Should an individual be injured by SCP-4514 in such a way that activates its anomalous properties, that individual will die.[[footnote]] Caused by the cessation of neurological activity.[[/footnote]] 

**Discovery:** On 5/14/2130, SCP-4514 was recovered following a violent altercation between two inebriated individuals. The quarrel resulted in SCP-4514 being used to kill one of the involved persons. Foundation personnel were alerted after the local paper published a story covering the event, who administered amnestics to all witnessing parties. A disinformation campaign was run thereafter to discredit the news agency.

**Experiment Log:**

> **Experiment #:** 1
> 
> **Subject:** D-3314, 36-year-old caucasian female, healthy
> 
> **Procedure:** Subject is to be given a minor incision (0.125cm deep, 3cm long) into her arm with SCP-4514.
> 
> **Result:** Subject survived.

> **Experiment #:** 2
> 
> **Subject:** D-3314, 36-year-old caucasian female, healthy
> 
> **Procedure:** Subject is to be sedated and given a major incision (1cm deep, 10 cm long) into her leg with SCP-4514. Afterwards, the wound is to be stitched together.
> 
> **Result:** Subject survived.

> **Experiment #:** 3
> 
> **Subject:** D-8833, 93-year-old asian male, inhibited cerebral function
> 
> **Procedure:** Subject is to be sedated, and then punctured with SCP-4514. The puncture is to target the brain, and occur as swiftly as possible. 
> 
> **Result:** Subject expired.

> **Experiment #:** 4
> 
> **Subject:** D-11424, 131 year-old caucasian female, suffering from muscle spasms and numbness due to complications arising from neck surgery. 
> 
> **Procedure:** Subject is to be sedated, and given a major incision (1cm deep, 10 cm long) across her midsection. If the subject is still alive after 50% of the subject's blood has left her body through the incision, the wound is to be stitched together, and an adequate amount of blood is to be siphoned back into the subject.
> 
> **Result:** Subject expired after 40% of her blood left her body.

<**Additional Tests Hidden For Brevity**>

> **Experiment #:** 47
> 
> **Subject:** Researcher George Haus, 132 year-old caucasian male
> 
> **Procedure:** A small portion of SCP-4514 is to be removed, and melted. It is to be fused with a standard 45 caliber bullet. The subject is to be sedated and then shot in the head with the bullet.  
> 
> **Result:** Subject expired.
 
> **Experiment #:** 48
> 
> **Subject:** Researcher Tanya Luvoi, 89 year-old caucasian female
> 
> **Procedure:** Subject is to be sedated. Pressure is to be applied to the subject's throat using the handle of SCP-4514 such that the subject suffocates. 
> 
> **Result:** Subject expired.

> **Experiment #:** 49
> 
> **Subject:** Site Director Charles Panthe, 149 year-old caucasian male

= **===MESSAGE FROM ETHICS COMMITTEE RECEIVED===**

> Dr. Young,
> 
> We have reviewed your experiment logs, and deemed them excessive, and unwarranted.
> 
> However, if we are to be honest, we noticed your undue testing of SCP-4514 a while ago. It's rare to have D-Class actively line up for experimentation. Testing actual employees was only inevitable.
> 
> We needed to discuss what the next step should be: create a standardized process for choosing SCP-4514 test subjects, offer this service to the public, etc.
> 
> In the end, as you can tell, we returned to our core principles as an organization. The world has forced us to redefine the status quo, but it is not our job to change it back. No matter how much we want to be at eternal peace, normalcy dictates that we can never achieve it.
> 
> Officially, you are hereby removed from the SCP-4514 project.
> 
> Unofficially, we get it. [[[end-of-death-hub | Life's a bitch.]]]

> - Dr. Violet Mesmur, Ethics Committee
