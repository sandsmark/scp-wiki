[[size large]]**Description:**[[/size]]
A gigafauna (measuring approximately 100 meters long) displaying a mixture of crocodilian and cephalopodic traits. The body plan of the parathreat - with the exception of the head - was pentaradially symmetrical. The lower body of LTE-0851-Cetus terminated in five tentacles, radially arranged. The entity possessed five arms, each arranged along the same axis as the tentacles.

While the head of the entity was outwardly similar to that of a baseline crocodile, the entity possessed five eyes, arranged in an arc along the head. LTE-0851-Cetus had significant anomalous regenerative capabilities, allowing it to survive most conventional weaponry.

LTE-0851-Cetus possessed numerous unique thaumaturgic capabilities, including the emission of large amounts of [[[goc-supplemental-arad|Elan Vital Energy]]], the ability to detect EVE patterns, the ability to cross certain thaumaturgic boundaries, and Red-IV Regenerative properties. It apparently used the EVE detection abilities in order to hunt.

Shortly before its liquidation, LTE-0851-Cetus displayed the ability to release large quantities of thaumaturgic fire from its mouth. This characteristic was not previously observed, but has been conjectured to have been an ability LTE-0851-Cetus previously did not possess the required EVE to use, until the events surrounding its liquidation made this possible.

[[size large]]**History and Liquidation:**[[/size]]
LTE-0851-Cetus was discovered in the North Atlantic Ocean, following an attack on three commercial civilian vessels. An assessment team was deployed to investigate the matter and discovered the entity, as well as determining that the parathreat had previously been held by the Foundation.

Initial liquidation efforts were unsuccessful, due to several factors. Following these, the decision was made to make an attempt in Greenland. However, the parathreat began to travel towards [[[Nx-03|Hy-Brasil]]], [[footnote]]A sovereign, independent, anomalous free port off the coast of Ireland, with diplomatic relations with the Coalition. Notably, Hy-Brasil could typically only be reached using thaumaturgic methods, with some anomalous organisms able to reach the island naturally.[[/footnote]] due to outside thaumaturgical interference.

LTE-0851-Cetus was successfully terminated on June 13, 1988 during the attack upon Hy-Brasil, at the cost of significant damage to the island. As a result of the arrangement made with the monarchy of Hy-Brasil, the Coalition was forced to immediately retreat, and was not allowed to interact with the corpse of the entity.

The current location of the corpse of LTE-0851-Cetus is [[[kaiju-caviar-ocn39-t5fg6-7hjl2|unknown.]]]

Following the failure to properly liquidate LTE-0851-Cetus in a naval setting, the decision was made to lure the entity to an appropriate terrestrial setting, in which PHYSICS Division operatives could properly prepare for an encounter. 

Due to the position of LTE-0851-Cetus in the Northern Atlantic, it was concluded that the best location in which to liquidate it was a secluded beach on the western shore of Greenland. The government of Denmark was contacted, and agreement was reached to liquidate the entity in the previously determined area.

Operatives began to lure LTE-0851-Cetus north using EVE patterns, which LTE-0851-Cetus appeared to hunt using. This strategy was successful, and the parathreat began to travel towards the planned liquidation location.

However, operations did not go according to plan.

[[size 150%]] **Analysis of Wards Surrounding Hy-Brasil** [[/size]]

By A. Ketterley, L. Belacqua
 
[[size 130%]] **Abstract:** [[/size]]
The thaumaturgic wards surrounding Hy-Brasil appear to be failing, and are no longer properly protecting the city. These wards were established to prevent misfortune from occurring upon the island, which has resulted in a minor aura of anomalous good luck within the boundaries of the island.
 [((bibcite Luck))] Based upon prior indications of anomalous fortune auras, should the wards completely fail, the accumulated misfortune will collapse onto the island. [((bibcite misfortune))]

The sudden reversal of anomalous probability within Hy-Brasil within a short time frame will likely have drastic repercussions upon the island and the city located within. The exact nature of these repercussions is unknown, but could be drastic.

Based upon past results, it is expected that the failure of these thaumaturgic wards will be accompanied by sudden, anomalous meteorological patterns [((bibcite weather))] as well as extremely high EVE patterns.

On June 13th, 1988, the wards surrounding Hy-Brasil suddenly and unexpectedly failed, resulting in an immediate anomalous weather patterns, and a sudden EVE spike. LTE-0851-Cetus was close to Hy-Brasil as a result of the GOC's intentions to terminate it in Greenland, and immediately traveled towards Hy-Brasil instead.

LTE-0851-Cetus was one of the few anomalous organisms capable of reaching Hy-Brasil under its own ability, and it swam towards the island. The Coalition was unable to immediately prepare a method of reaching Hy-Brasil, and was unable to reach the island immediately.

By the time the Global Occult Coalition was able to reach Hy-Brasil, LTE-0851-Cetus had already caused substantial damage to the infrastructure of the island, including the destruction of the palace. General Rockefeller immediately ordered heavy bombardment of the parathreat without regard for the existing infrastructure, the majority of which had already been destroyed.

During the attack, LTE-0851-Cetus displayed the ability to breathe large amounts of thaumaturgic fire, which had not been previously observed. It has been theorized that LTE-0851-Cetus needed a requisite amount of EVE in order to release such an attack, which it did not have access to until it absorbed the large amount of EVE released during the fall of Hy-Brasil's wards.

The initial assault upon LTE-0851-Cetus was unsuccessful, as a result of the entity's regenerative properties. Continued bombardment of the parathreat continued until General Rockefeller gave the order to deploy a Casaba-Howitzer Nuclear Directed Energy Weapon, which had been intended for usage as a last resort.

The CHNDEW was successful at liquidating the parathreat, but resulted in a significant amount of damage to the surrounding area of Hy-Brasil. During the resultant cleanup and aftermath of the event, the heir apparent to the throne of Hy-Brasil commanded the Coalition to immediately withdraw. As a result, the GOC was not able to conduct proper cleanup measures of LTE-0851-Cetus's remains.

||||||||~ __Office of the Undersecretary General__||
||~ Sender||= General Rockefeller||~ Recipient||= Madam Al Fine||
||||||~ Subject||= Liquidation of LTE-0851-Cetus and Resultant Damage to Hy-Brasil||
|||||||| I am pleased to report that our operatives were able to kill LTE-0851-Cetus (the Crocodilian Kraken) on June 13th, 1988, in Hy-Brasil. _
 _
By the time we made it to Hy-Brasil, the city had already descended into chaos and ruin. The storm was bad enough to cause panic, and then a fire-breathing squid monster crawled out of the ocean. It was a recipe for disaster, and that is what happened. _
 _
We bombarded that beast with everything we had, but it regenerated from just about everything we threw at it. It healed even faster than what the Foundation had described in their files, and they had thought the regeneration made it the most dangerous on the island. _
 _
It took hours of blasting it with our most advanced weaponry for it to begin to falter. We shot it with magic, with bullets, with fire, with plasma and they only slowed it down a little. _
 _
After all of our weapons had done nothing to it, I decided I had enough. The only weapon that had done much of anything were the Plasma Tanks, and I came to the conclusion that an energy weapon was our best option. Given that, the usage of the Casaba-Howitzer became justified. _
 _
Since that was the first field usage of the Casaba-Howitzer, I am expected to briefly address how it functioned: extremely well. It annihilated the parathreat. Left a hole right in its head that didn't grow back. _
 _
But that's my problem - the parathreat was not the only victim of the device. It destroyed far too much of the surrounding area of Hy-Brasil for my standards. Initial reports of the incident have indicated that there were several hundred civilian casualties of a result of the deployment of the device. The usage of the Casaba-Howitzer was not justified. _
 _
The decision to use the Casaba-Howitzer was entirely my own. None of my men were responsible, and those that activated it were only following orders. The deaths of those caused as a result of the weapon's deployment are my responsibility _
 _
Madam Al Fine, I am filing a court martial against myself for violations of Third Mission Concerns. Regardless of their findings, I will be retiring from service, as I can no longer view myself as equitably acting out the good of the world. _
 _
I have failed the Coalition and, more importantly, humanity.||

General Rockefeller was tried by the Council of 108 for violations of Third Mission (Protection) Concerns, and was found Not Guilty, by reason of the primacy of the First Mission (Survival) over the Third Mission. The liquidation of LTE-0851-Cetus was deemed to be a significant enough threat to First Mission concerns as to necessitate the complete abandoning of all other Missions. Thusly, the deployment of the Casaba-Howitzer Nuclear Directed Energy Weapon was excusable.

Based upon the testimony and insistence of General Rockefeller, further usage of the CHNDEW has been permanently suspended by the Global Occult Coalition for general usage. However, the Council of 108 has retained the right to deploy the CHNDEW in high priority decisions, as decided by the Council of 108.

Following his acquittal, General Rockefeller voluntarily retired from Global Occult Coalition service.
