**Item #:** SCP-1201

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**  The Bezuhov Nuclear Power Facility and the five mile perimeter surrounding it is fenced and monitored by security cameras. Radiation sensors wired to alarms provide an early warning system in case of an unlikely containment breach. Guard posts located on the perimeter are manned by personnel armed with flat-dock Gv20 Gravitational Emitters to subdue SCP-1201 should the need arise.

**Description:**  The phenomena documented as SCP-1201 was discovered after the previously condemned and vacated Bezuhov Power Plant’s nuclear reactor once again became active. 

Entities commonly spotted at the site are a glowing and translucent humanoid figures. The first and documented figure, SCP-1201-a is occasionally spotted walking the grounds leisurely, sitting on walkway benches, and in one occurrence appeared to be smoking something in the shape of a cigar. The figure, SCP-1201-a, does not appear hostile, sometimes waving and approaching guards. As a result several guards have since been treated for severe radiation poisoning. SCP-1201-a obliged to guards orders for it to keep away after seeing that it had ‘inadvertently’ killed two.

No physical testing can be done due to the harmful and incorporeal nature of the entity. Gunshots fired on SCP-1201-a pass through the body, and explosives appear to destroy the being temporarily, SCP-1201-a reconstituting shortly afterwards.

**Containment and Research Summary:**

The Omask site remains functional eight months after the unexplained re-activation, and SCP-1201 persists. The following documentations outline containment procedures over this time and attempts at exploration within the facility.

**██/█3/██ Perimeter Observation Log:** A new entity has been sighted on the grounds, similar in appearance (and suspected, composition) to SCP-1201-a. The entity often accompanies SCP-1201-a, the two appearing to converse and make demonstrative physical contact with each other. This entity will henceforth be referred to as SCP-1201-b.

**██/█4/██ Exploratory Drone Report:** Locks and security panels in the reactor area of the site remain intact, making further exploration impossible for the current drone. An order has been put into headquarters to send parts to refit the drone with a laser cutter.

**██/█4/██ Perimeter Observation Log:** Two smaller figures similar in appearance emerge from the cargo bay of the facility and appear to chase each other and make harmless physical offensives on one another. SCP-1201-a and SCP-1201-b emerge from the ground behind the two figures appearing to surprise them. After hearing a low-frequency moan similar to human speech the group fades from sight.

**██/█5/██ Exploratory Drone Report:** Main reactor accessed. Photos transmitted to HQ. Filaments appear to be growing around the reactor cores. Figures visually similar in composition to SCP-1201-a are visible within the cores. SCP-1201-a, in the series of photographs, is wandering to and from each core.

**██/█5/██ Perimeter Observation Log:** Since the appearance of three more similar entities which resemble a cat, a dog, and another humanoid figure, command has decided action should be taken to eliminate them. Reason being that their appearance has coincided with increased radiation from the facility. The facility is now being subjected to rounds of Gv20 Grav bombs. As of the recording of this log, all entities save for SCP-1201-a have been eliminated, not including the entities located within the reactor chamber.

**Audio recovered from Exploratory Drone - Fall ████:** 

//Foreword: The tapes the drone recovered were found in the supervisors office. No speech can be made out and it appears to be composed of nothing save for white noise. When the drone returned its housing was laced with strings of glowing filament previously observed in the reactor core. These strings were arranged in such a way to form a series of English letters. The anagram reads as follows://
