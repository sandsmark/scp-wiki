title:Scp 076
Item#: SCP-076

Object Class: Keter


Special Containment Procedures: SCP-076-1 is to be encased in five (5) foot of reinforced titanium, and be lowered six hundred (600) feet below sea level via a vertical shaft. Shaft is to be separated every five (5) feet with a reinforced blast door, constructed of six (6) inch thick titanium shielding. SCP-076-1's containment unit is to be under constant supervision at all times. When SCP-076-1 has been successfully lowered to the bottom of the shaft, shaft is to be completely flooded with water. All personnel on site must be trained in the use of heavy weaponry and hand to hand combat. Should SCP-076-2 show any signs of movement, entire facility is to go into MK 4 lock down, and all personnel are to take up their registered positions. SCP-076-2 is to be rendered immobile at all costs. When SCP-076-2 has been incapacitated, subject is to be placed in the central confinement in SCP-076-1, area is to be resealed and repairs are to be made as soon as possible.

Additional Containment: SCP-076-02 has been allowed certain freedoms in the SCP organization in exchange for it's continued assistance; this arrangement calls for a unique measure of containment. SCP-076-02 is to be monitored by 3 agents selected by the subject, as well as a level 4 agent equipped with a kill switch tuned to SCP-076-02's necklace at all times. SCP-076-02 is to be allowed access to eucilid class items on a case by case necessity as determined the level 4 agent currently assigned to it.

Description: SCP-076-1 is a stone cube twelve (12) foot in diameter. All surfaces outside and within SCP-076-1 are covered in deeply engraved patterns. It is unknown whether the patterns serve a purpose or not, but their likeness has not been recorded in other civilizations or documentation on record. A door is located on one side, sealed with a large lock, surrounded by twenty (20) smaller locks in a circular pattern. When unlocked, pattern rotates clockwise and the door can be opened. As of yet, none of the keys have been found, and door can only be closed once SCP-076-2 has been interred inside. No attempts have been made to breach SCP-076-1 once SCP-076-2 was inside.

Inside the cube, the temperature drops instantly, to around minus three hundred (-300) Fahrenheit, and cannot be changed by any source, internal or external. Directly in the center of the room is a seven (7) foot tall stone coffin, held in place and sealed shut by several chains of unknown make and substance, which are attached to the inner corners of SCP-076-1.

Within the coffin is SCP-076-2.

SCP-076-2 seems to be a lean male Caucasian human in his late twenties. Hair is blond, and eyes are gray. Six foot, five inches (6'5) in height and one hundred and eighty pounds (180lbs) in weight. Subjects is clad in leather belts and scraps of metal, covering mostly the torso and hands. A simple pair of black cloth pants covers the subjects lower waist and legs. Iconography is present all over clothing, mostly in the form of leering demonic faces, and ranges from subtle to openly ostentatious. Subject, when encased inside SCP-076-1, is technically dead.

However, occasionally SCP-076-2 will awaken, effectively "reanimating", complete with all needed vital signs and processes needed to sustain a living human being. After reanimating, subject will attempt to leave SCP-076-1. If this is accomplished, subject will then go off in search of human beings. Upon coming into contact with living humans, SCP-076-2 will materialize a melee weapon, most normally a sword. Survivor eyewitnesses and security footage show SCP-076-2 reaches into shadows, removing the weapons from possible a subspace niche. As soon as the weapon leaves SCP-076-2's grasp, they gradually lose substance and vanish within five (5) minutes.

Once in possession of a weapon, SCP-076-2 will attempt to fight and kill all humans that come into contact with it, only stopping upon death of SCP-076-2. Subjects strength, speed and durability are far beyond that of a living human being. Subject has performed considerable feats, including:

    * Tearing through solid titanium with his bare hands. 

    * Taking a howitzer round directly to the torso and surviving. 

    * Being deprived of oxygen for over four (4) hours before succumbing to asphyxiation. 

    * Swatting bullets out of the air with a weapon. 

    * Surviving water pressures of up to twenty five (25) MPa. 

    * Clearing over two hundred and ten (210) feet of distance in under three (3) seconds. 

SCP-076-2 has effectively been killed several times in various manners and dealt with posthumously in the following ways:

    * Complete destruction of the head via a round fired from a M1 Abrams Tank. 

    * Asphyxiation. 

    * Crushed beneath a fifteen (15) ton piece of elevator equipment for use on SCP-076-1, which was dislodged by SCP-076-2 when it attempted to escape. 

    * Complete dismemberment by prolonged fire, over five (5) minutes, from a M61 Vulcan Gatling gun. 

    * Cremation through the use of a Thermite-TH3 grenade placed directly inside SCP-076-2's open chest cavity. (SCP-076-2 had taken seven (7) point blank shots to the torso with a Remington 1100 tactical shotgun in 12 gauge with 8 pellet 000 buck, effectively neutralizing SCP-076-2. However, this was a last ditch effort by Agent Keller and he was killed in the attempt alongside SCP-076-2.) 

    * Containment Area-25, which previously housed SCP-076, once detonated its on site warhead as a last attempt to contain SCP-076-2 while it was attempting escape, resulting in total destruction of the site and all on-site personnel. SCP-076-1 survived. The organization passed it off as the 1980 eruption of Mount Helens. 

Every single time, SCP-076-2 has somehow, eventually reformed, healed and continued its rampage, sometimes within hours, depending on the severity of its demise. SCP-076-2's clothes also appear to heal after damage. However, when SCP-076-2's remains have been placed within SCP-076-1, SCP-076-2's rate of recovery has been slowed dramatically, and afterwards, SCP-076-2 enters a state of dormancy which can last anywhere from six months, to twenty five years.

It should be noted that SCP-076-2's regenerative qualities only seem to activate while it appears to be dead. While damage ascertained beforehand does heal notably faster than normal human beings, it does not occur at the speeds recorded during the postmortem stages. However, subjects tolerance for pain is amazing, shrugging off, or ignoring lethal wounds. SCP-076-2 seems not to suffer from shock, and if the wound does not immediately kill it, it is unlikely that it will die at all without further damage.

When SCP-076-2's body is completely destroyed, such as in the case of cremation, or the Containment Area-25 incident, SCP-076-1 will seal shut, and SCP-076-2 will reform within the sarcophagus inside.

Posthumous analysis of SCP-076-2 show that it has a highly different internal system to our own, documented in [DATA EXPUNGED].

While it has been confirmed that SCP-076-2 has no need to eat, subject has shown that it can eat, and enjoys the action, although it usually prefers roasted and seasoned meat and heavy alcohol.

Attempts to speak with subject have met with little to no success. Interviews with SCP-076-2, who refers to itself as "Able", set up during its postmortem state, and taken place after reanimation, while informative, have done little to curb it's homicidal tendencies. Subject has knowledge of several languages including English, but most notably was its knowledge of several dialects of ancient Sumerian, which seem to be its preferred language. Subject expressed contempt of humans that could not provide it with a challenge. Subject was disinclined to perform intelligence or aptitude tests seriously, instead gradually becoming more and more aggressive until it became necessary to terminate SCP-076-2 and place it back within the confines of SCP-076-1.


Additional: SCP-076 was found in ████████████ Mongolia, in 18██, by archaeologists from England. When the otherworldly nature of SCP-076 became apparent, the Foundation became involved and confiscated it.

SCP-076 remained in storage for ███████ (██) years, until SCP-076-2 became active and escaped on ████████████, during WWI. It is unknown what prompted SCP-076-2 into action. It took three (3) years and ████ ███████ and ██████ ████ (███) agents to track down SCP-076-2 again, until it was incapacitated by saturation bombing, and retrieved.

Subject reanimated within six (6) days, although subject did not manage to escape as preventative measures had been taken.

Subject was in custody for three (3) more years, under constant supervision, and being terminated whenever it became active, although it occasionally was able to escape for short periods of time. The Foundation's death toll due to this was [DATA EXPUNGED]

Eventually, it was decided to cremate and destroy SCP-076-2's remains, as it posed too much of a risk the the organization alive. After the action is taken, SCP-076-1 seals shut and it is discovered that the two are intrinsically connected. Subject goes into hibernation and remains so until [DATA EXPUNGED]

After the last incident, the current procedures regarding SCP-076 are instated, although they are upgraded regularly with the increase in technological standards.


Addendum 076-01: Recently, SCP-076-2 appeared distressed when Agent ███████, an agent who had previously had a large amount of experience with SCP-076-2 and had been killed in the Containment Area-25 incident, did not appear once it escaped. It asked several personnel, killing those who could not answer it. When it finally did learn of the fate of Agent ███████, SCP-076-2 stopped its rampage and allowed itself to be escorted and restrained.

Subject was then interviewed on the sudden drastic changes in its behavior.

<Begin Log>

Dr. ██████: Why are you so interested in the death of Agent ███████?

SCP-076-2: (Subject begins swearing in ancient Sumerian)

Dr. ██████: Why does his death bother you? You've killed many humans before, why is he so- (Is cut off by SCP-076-2)

SCP-076-2: (now speaking in English) Different? Because, unlike you [Sumerian word, untranslated], he was a challenge, a real enemy.

Dr. ██████: Why would that be good for you? Every time you have awoken you've tried to escape. He was responsible for apprehending you several times. Surely you must be glad he's dead.

SCP-076-2: I would hardly expect you to understand. Do you know, he managed to shoot me in the head over twenty eight times? Even one of the guards next to you would have difficulty hitting me at all, just once. A man like that deserves to die in combat, so close to his opponent he can feel his breath. Not in some [Sumerian words, untranslated] destruction. The rest of you... (SCP-076-2 spits) you disgust me. I don't even have the urge to strike you down.

(Subject is silent from then on, refusing to speak or respond)

<End Log>

Subject was later terminated and placed back into SCP-076-1


Addendum 076-02: Upon the last breakout of SCP-076-2, it did not attack any personnel, only reacting non lethally to violence directed towards it. It requested an audience, or at least "an ear with those in charge". While it was not granted a direct audience, high command did listen to what it had to say.

SCP-076-2 stated it was tired of the "game it played" with the Foundation, and has professed to looking for a bigger challenge. SCP-076-2 then offered its services to the Foundation, stating that it will fight and destroy anything the Foundation wants. However, it also issued several condition would have to be met in order for it to fully accept "employment", namely that it be used at least once every two (2) weeks, and not be used for anything either demeaning, or beneath its abilities.

The organization, taking note of the massive drain on resources while on the receiving end of SCP-076-2's anger, accepted its proposal, although they added several terms of their own, which SCP-076-2 grudgingly accepted.

SCP-076-2 is to wear a device attached to the neck, that if triggered or tampered with, will immediately detonate, terminating SCP-076-2 by way of complete destruction of the spinal cord, trachea and all major blood vessels in the neck. A tracking device has also been attached to SCP-076-2's person. It is to refrain from killing personnel or non-personnel unless asked to, and is to avoid too much damage to the organization's facilities. It is also to avoid divulging sensitive information.

As a direct result of this, a new task force has been set up, directly for handling and support of SCP-076-2, Mobile Task Force Omega 5 (Aka "Pandora's Box"). SCP-076-2 has only allowed personnel to create and join this squad if they met its personal standards, and could beat it, or come close to it, in anything the applicant chooses.

So far, there are only twenty (20) members of the squad, each having to beat SCP-076-2 in a different activity, as it picks up skills very easily. Mainly, SCP-076-2 has been bested in actions that it would have little to no experience in, and the list of things it has been beaten in has included board games, video games, card games and sharp shooting.

So far, SCP-076-2 has not had to deal with anything extreme, only basic threats, and has professed a high amount of agitation at this. In response, it has begun training "Pandora's box", in live combat situations. Although while all personnel use live ammunition, SCP-076-2 has used a foam weapon, and has been using non lethal force. While there have been no fatalities as of yet, several squad members have been hospitalized numerous times for broken bones, torn and strained muscles and ligaments, and multiple severe contusions. SCP-076-2 has not yet been harmed, and has expressed extreme distaste as to the combat proficiency of "Pandora's Box", but has stated that it will continue to train them until one of them, or itself, dies.

Additionally, now that SCP-076-2 is more co-operative, attempts have been made to assess the subjects psychological makeup. However, researchers are to be made aware that despite SCP-076-2's recent co-operation with the organization, it is still a Keter class subject, and can and will kill or maim if irritated, proven following Professor Liham's spinal and facial injuries and subsequent hospital stay after a casual backhanded strike, received whilst trying to forcefully introduce SCP-076-2 to ink blot therapy.

It has been realized that SCP-076-2 either possesses a mind constructed much differently than our own, or is completely insane, with little empathy or ideas in a way we would understand it. Concepts such as sex, love and equality are completely foreign ideas to SCP-076-2, or at least in comparison to its way of viewing them. Subject has shown that it is completely disinterested in sex, barely differentiating between genders except as a form of visual identification. Also, while subject has admitted greatly enjoying the act of killing, causing pain, either emotionally or physically, hold no attraction to it, but neither is it repelled or disgusted by such actions.

Intelligence tests have been wildly inconclusive when applied to SCP-076-2, and no accurate result has yet been obtained. This may be due to the alien thought processes of the subject. SCP-076-2 has however, shown that it has great knowledge of human anatomy (although in a highly violent context), military tactics of open warfare, metallurgy, and, strangely enough, the care of livestock.

SCP-076-2 still either will not, or cannot divulge information on how it acquires it weapons, becoming angry and aggressive when pressed on the matter.


Addendum 076-03: In light of SCP-076-2 proficient use of the Sumerian language, researchers have asked it to translate several documents. While it originally replied with disinterest, it has translated some of the documents it found worthy of its attention. Most of the documents chosen by SCP-076-2 were regarding battles or legendary heroes, one of its favorites in particular being the "Epic of Gilgamesh".

However, one researcher presented it with the symbol from SCP-073. Upon sight of this, SCP-076-2 became highly enraged, killing several of the researchers before its kill switch could be activated. When revived and questioned about this, SCP-076-2 responded aggressively, and that line of questioning was immediately dropped. It is recommended anything pertaining SCP-073 never be brought to the attention of SCP-076-2 and that the two SCP are never in the same facility.


Addendum 076-04: SCP-076-2 occasionally has light blank spells, when it stops whatever it is doing and obtains a blank expression, as if it is listening to some unheard voice. After these spells, SCP-076-2 acts mildly confused. When SCP-182, or "Saint" is mentioned to it, it adopts the same confused characteristics, although is unwilling to elaborate, and if the the matter is pressed, SCP-076-2 responds the way it always responds when attempts are made to force it to do something, that is, with threats of extreme bodily violence and death. Recently, after SCP-182 stopped answering questions, SCP-343 made a joke that perhaps, 'Saint and Able broke up.' When questioned about SCP-182 SCP-076-2, as usual, refused to answer with anything more than a threat to 'Stop asking about him or you won't have a jaw to ask questions with.'


Addendum 076-05: As a direct result of a passing comment made by Agent ███████ in reference to SCP-517, SCP-076-2 has requested a private "duel" with SCP-517. Request granted as results may yield more information in regards to SCP-517 and an increase in morale of SCP-076-2. Arrangements being made for a later date.


Addendum 076-06: At approximately 1500hrs SCP-076-2 was granted access to SCP-517. SCP-517 preceded to attack SCP-076-2 with extreme prejudice. At approximately 1528hrs SCP-076-2 was fatally wounded. At approximately 1800hrs SCP-076-2 reanimated and proceeded to partially dismember SCP-517 and cause an extreme amount of cranial trauma resulting in SCP-517 entering a deep coma. Possible introduction of SCP-076-2 to SCP-682 is being considered.


Addendum 076-07: Recently, SCP-105 has been incepted into Mobile Task Force Omega-7, having beaten SCP-076-2 in a contest to see which of the two could activate several devices, each spaced over a mile away from each other and the starting point. SCP-105 managed to score significantly higher than SCP-076-2 by using her inherent abilities to her advantage. SCP-076-2 ceded defeat and allowed her entry into the group.
