**Item #:** SCP-2214

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The entrance to SCP-2214 is to remain locked at all times. Iron bars are fitted across all windows of SCP-2214 to prevent the entry of foreign objects. Foundation agents are to guard the apartments immediately adjacent, as well as above and below, SCP-2214, under the guise of residents of the building.

Interaction with SCP-2214-1 through -1288 is forbidden under any circumstances. Any personnel seeking to enter SCP-2214 for purposes of research or documentation must first receive express, written permission from an onsite supervisor of level 3 or higher security clearance. 

Foundation personnel may only incorporate outside objects into SCP-2214 with the permission of a supervisor of level 4 or higher security clearance.

**Description:** SCP-2214 is a 85 m^^2^^ apartment located in ██████ Okrug,  Moscow. The layout of SCP-2214 is consistent with late Soviet-era standards for single-resident apartments, and differs in no significant way from that of other units in the building.

SCP-2214 contains 1288 objects, SCP-2214-1 through SCP-2214-1288, mostly typical belongings for a late Soviet-era apartment. The primary exception is SCP-2214-1280, the remains of Konstantin Baranov, former resident of SCP-2214. Any object that remains in SCP-2214 for 72 hours or more will be incorporated into SCP-2214. Once incorporated, it becomes physically impossible to remove an object from SCP-2214[[footnote]]SCP-2214-1282 through -1288, consisting of a ballpoint pen, a paperclip, and five steel ball bearings, were all introduced during initial testing of SCP-2214 by GRU-P personnel.[[/footnote]].

SCP-2214-1 through SCP-2214-1288 change orientation and relative position to one another in response to changes in macroeconomic conditions of the former Soviet Union[[footnote]]This includes the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Podlogistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan.[[/footnote]]. Each object is representative of a single macroeconomic factor, although the sheer number of SCP objects has made interpreting the movements of SCP-2214-1 through -1284 effectively impossible. However, Foundation researchers have made some progress in connecting the movements of objects with macroeconomic conditions; see Addendum 2214-W-78-o91 for a partial list.

Manually changing the position of SCP-2214-1 through -1288 effects changes in the economy of the former Soviet Union. The typical delay between the movement of an object and the economic changes that it effects is three days.

**Discovery Log:** The anomalous nature of SCP-2214 was discovered on October 17, 1990 when ██████████ ██████, the superintendent of the building housing SCP-2214, entered SCP-2214 to investigate complaints about an odor emanating from the apartment. Previously, tenants had complained about persistent noises from the apartment of Mr. Baranov, a deputy assistant sub-director at the Soviet State Planning Committee (Gosplan).

Upon entering SCP-2214, Mr. ██████ found "plates flying everywhere and ghosts moving furniture." In addition, Mr. ██████ located the remains of Mr. Baranov, who appeared to have been killed when a dresser, later discovered to be affected by the state-mandated price for Uzbek cotton, fell on top of him, crushing him. It was estimated that Mr. Baranov had been deceased roughly a week by the time of discovery.

Calls from Mr. ██████ to the Moscow police were intercepted by agents of the GRU-P, who arrived on the scene and successfully secured the area. Mr. ██████ was detained and dosed with a class-R amnestic. In 1992, with the integration of several elements of the former GRU-P, the Foundation gained custody of SCP-2214.
