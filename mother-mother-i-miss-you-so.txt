Mother, Mother, sing me a lullaby.
Wipe my tears when I cry.
Mother, Mother, keep safe.
While out and about from this place.

Mother, Mother, you treat me well.
With love and care, you never yell.
Mother, Mother, you are my friend.
Even in the end when no one else has been.

Mother, Mother, I love you so.
Even in the days, I must go.
Mother, Mother, do not forget me.
Even if the cadets insist see.

Mother, Mother, I’ve lied to you.
I never wanted to make you blue.
Mother, Mother, do not worry.
Even if I leave in a hurry.

Mother, Mother, I miss you much.
In this place full of dust.
Mother, Mother, this place is cold.
Red stained metal it’s getting old.

Mother, Mother, I want your touch.
A loving hug, is that too much?
Mother, Mother, this place is harsh.
I want to come home and get away from this marsh.

Mother, Mother, I hope you know.
Your little boy loves you so.
Mother, Mother, please stay strong.
Even if I’m gone and it is lifelong.
