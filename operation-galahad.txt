++ **Foreword**
> This is a message to all members of the newly-formed Mobile Task Force Omega-16, "Grail Knights".
> 
> First of all, congratulations. You weren't chosen at random - your hand-to-hand combat abilities, skills of judgment, and stamina are all exceptional, among other things. Corbenic is a very strange place in that you will have no Earthly weapons available, and all of your tools will either need to be found, invented, or present on your body. You were chosen for this mission because your bodies are some of the most capable bodies for exploration and combat available. 
> 
> The problem remains, however, whether or not any living soldier is strong enough to navigate and map Corbenic. One of our scientists made her own path through the place - we'll get to //her// later - but it is crucial that the Foundation understand as much about Corbenic as possible. It is a very important realm to the Foundation and Humanity at large, for reasons that unfortunately cannot be disclosed to you.
> 
> I am happy to note that none of you have read the documentation for SCP-2922. Hopefully, I will not have to stress the importance of //not// breaking into a document long since labeled for Level 5 clearance. I will tell you all you need to know - and for all intents and purposes what the Foundation //does// know - about the extradimensional realm known to us now as Corbenic.
> 
> The most important thing to remember about Corbenic is that it is the home of an enemy of the Foundation who claims to have discovered a way to undo the effects of SCP-2718[[footnote]] SCP-2718 is a condition that must be cured. That is all the information you will receive on the matter. [[/footnote]].
> 
> I'll be watching. Win or lose, we secure, we contain, and we protect.
> 
> - Dr. Isaiah Henderson, Project Corbenic Director
**Primary Objective:** Locate and capture SCP-PC-001, a traitor to the Foundation in possession of knowledge crucial to the safety of humanity.

**Secondary Objective:** Explore and provide information about Corbenic and its contents.

++ New entries will be added as Operation Galahad progresses. 
+ **Area SCP-2922-C, Corbenic**
+++ __Access__
Access to Corbenic is done through the highly experimental Procedure 42-Humbaba, during which a human subject must be put into a medically-induced coma. Extraction involves awakening from this coma. Communication between MTF Omega-16 operatives in Corbenic and Project Corbenic personnel on Earth will be done through the one-way telepathic mind-to-phone implant known as SCP-2922.
+++ __Provisions__
There are not yet any known sources of food and water in Corbenic, but a human subject in Corbenic will not experience hunger or thirst, and will possess levels of energy that render rest unnecessary. Injuries are also prone to regenerate.
+++ __Area Overview__
Corbenic is an extradimensional realm of undefined volume. The human population of Corbenic believes that it is some form of afterlife. For all intents and purposes, it is an extradimensional area that can be temporarily accessed through 42-Humbaba. Whether or not it is a form of afterlife is not important.

Gravity, air, and temperature readings are all similar to that of Earth. The sky maintains a pea-green color. Weather is generally unchanging, temperature is usually breezy cold. There is no sun, but light is sustained over the area by three moons. There are no day or night cycles. Only two major areas of Corbenic have been determined to exist.
+++ __The Great Desert__
The most currently well-understood area consists of a large expanse of sand. Once a human subject gains access to Corbenic, they will awaken in a random area of the Great Desert with no clothes or possessions. Other humanoids tend to generate inside the Great Desert, having expressed recent memories of dying.
+++ __The Valley of the Striders__
On one edge of the Great Desert is a mountain range known as the Valley of the Striders. This area can be accessed by following the leftmost moon in the sky through the desert for as long as possible. The Valley is home to a particularly dangerous native species of primate - the Striders, its namesake. A nomadic society of humans also lives in the Valley, as does an entity known as the "Three-Faced Tree," SCP-PC-006.

**Newly discovered areas:**
+++ __Bogal Mountain__
A mountain in the center of the Valley of the Striders, believed to be over 30 km in height. The peak of Bogal Mountain, which is above the cloud layer and has not yet been observed, is said to contain the castle of SCP-PC-007. Bogal Mountain is frequented by Striders, who are often found climbing the mountain.
+++ __The River Tock__
River of greyish sludge that winds through the Valley of the Striders. Squadron 12 has been advised to follow the path of this river.

[[tab Corbenic-Exclusive Objects]]
++ New entries will be added as Operation Galahad progresses. 
------

**Item #:** SCP-PC-001

**Threat Level:** Active

**Location:** Unknown

**Description:** Human, female, African-American, 33 years old. Formerly a Foundation scientist known as Dr. Janet Spiegel. Implanted with SCP-2922. Was the first explorer of Corbenic. Betrayed the Foundation when we refused to meet special demands regarding her husband. Supplied false information, then broke off contact. Is obfuscating information regarding SCP-2718 and Corbenic crucial to the safety of Humanity. Husband is SCP-PC-002. Allied with SCP-PC-005.

------

**Item #:** SCP-PC-002

**Threat Level:** Active

**Location:** Unknown; likely in a separate area from SCP-PC-001

**Description:** Human, male, Caucasian of Swiss descent, 37 years old. Formerly a civilian known as Herman Spiegel. Accessed Corbenic in an attempt to locate SCP-PC-001. Assisted by SCP-PC-005 through as of yet unknown means. Use as a hostage is advised to negotiate with SCP-PC-001.

------

**Item #:** SCP-PC-003, "Striders"

**Threat Level:** Hostile

**Location:** Valley of the Striders, occasionally Great Desert

**Description:** Bipedal primates of tremendous size - most recently encountered specimen during Project Galahad estimated to be at least 3 kilometers in height. Known to wander Corbenic without any apparent purpose. Peaceful when unprovoked. Often attacks humans, but "gently," as if to observe Corbenic's omnipresent healing factor. If provoked with weapons or counterattacks, Striders will not physically attack, but make vocalizations that can cause a variety of effects on humans, including:
* Petrification of human flesh,
* Teleportation to an unknown area,
* Negation of the healing factor, and
* SCP-2718.
As such, Striders are to be ignored if possible, and Strider attacks are to be dealt with passively. They will occasionally collect human subjects from the mountain to feed SCP-PC-007. 

------

**Item #:** SCP-PC-004

**Threat Level:** Minimal

**Location:** All

**Description:** SCP-PC-004 is a blanket entry for all other humans in Corbenic. Information may be gathered if the subject is not hostile. No anomalous qualities save for regenerative factor for all things in Corbenic.

Many instances of SCP-PC-004 taken up permanent residency in the Valley of the Striders in villages and other settlements. Known sources of clothes and building materials include strider hair, stone, mud, and grass.

------

**Item #:** SCP-PC-005, "The Impenetrable"

**Threat Level:** Dangerous

**Location:** Unknown; likely with SCP-PC-001

**Description:** Hostile reality-bending entity working alongside SCP-PC-001 and assisting SCP-PC-002. Entity resembles a massive spider - shapeshifting elements unknown. Seventh godlike being of a council of eight. Little is known about this entity, but it had been encountered previously by the Foundation in trans-dimensional experiments with SCP-████ and SCP-████, resulting in the deaths of 52 members of Mobile Task Force Nu-7 "Hammer Down" in Incident-29415-Bravo. Use extreme caution.

------

**Item #:** SCP-PC-006

**Threat Level:** Neutral

**Location:** Valley of the Striders

**Description:** Plant-based lifeform on the top of a mountain near Bogal Mountain. Entity resembles a tree with three canine faces. Entity claims to be a guide for "whosoever may ask." Height and location of its mountain makes access difficult. Locals assert that only one face tells the truth.

------

**Item #:** SCP-PC-007, "The Witch-Queen of Bogal Mountain"

**Threat Level:** Hostile

**Location:** Bogal Mountain

**Description:** Eldest of SCP-PC-003 instances. Never leaves the castle on the peak of Bogal Mountain. Known disdain for humans, harsh temperament, and reality-bending abilities. To speak negatively of SCP-PC-007 in the Great Desert or the Valley of the Striders will cause the speaker's flesh to petrify. 

SCP-PC-003 is one of the few entities in Corbenic known to eat. Striders have been known to collect wayward human subjects in stone baskets to feed SCP-PC-007. If captured for this purpose, //it is crucial to cooperate and refrain from resistance.// SCP-PC-007 has devoured two agents of MTF Omega-16. Digestive processes of SCP-PC-007 take two months, and both have healed returned to duty after defecation. The process has left both agents with deep psychological trauma. This is to be understood as an accepted risk, and preferable to petrification or other Strider-curses, which are incurable.
