**Name:** ███ ("Eekium") ██████

**Date of Birth:** ██/██/19██

**Gender:** Male

**Occupation:**  Weird Art Kid

**Profile:** ███ joined The Foundation in April of 2015, and has poured countless hours down the drain reading and writing SCP articles. The current working theory is that he has way too much time on his hands, though this has yet to be confirmed. He also has copious amounts of other projects that he works on, including his music (he currently has published two albums which are both available on [https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/exile-of-the-hummingbird/id1057465949 iTunes], [https://player.spotify.com/album/44vPgWpKyH2OdQza7kj7rZ Spotify], etc), visual and audio design for an [http://www.hullabaloo-es.com/abysm.html indie game], and 3d modeling.

He has been noted to be introverted, creative, and rather friendly. Other interests include Steven Universe, music of all kinds (but a lot of Radiohead and Porcupine Tree), Cosmology, and surreal horror (despite having ██████████ ███████ ████████).
