**Name:** ███ ("Eekium") ██████

**Date of Birth:** ██/██/19██

**Gender:** Male

**Occupation:**  Weird Art Kid

**Profile:** ███ joined The Foundation in April of 2015, and has poured countless hours down the drain reading and writing SCP articles. The current working theory is that he has --way too much time on his hands-- (See Addendum), though this has yet to be confirmed. He also has copious amounts of other projects that he works on, including his music, visual and audio design, and 3D modeling.

He has been noted to be introverted, creative, and rather friendly. Other interests include music of all kinds (but a lot of Radiohead and Porcupine Tree), Cosmology, and surreal horror (despite having ██████████ ███████ ████████).

███ came to The Foundation during a period of time in which [REDACTED]. The Foundation served as an ██████ ███ ███ ███████ and a means of ██████ while he was [REDACTED]. 

**Addendum 2/10/2017:** During the latter portion of 2016 and early 2017, ███ took an extended leave from The Foundation. He has reported this being caused by being busy with work, school, and other creative pursuits (See Appendix "Personnel Absentee Report Feb. 2017"). He does, however, intend on returning to active involvement with Foundation activities starting within the next few weeks.

Work on the ongoing "[[[Aleph-Null Hub | Aleph-Null]]]" project will also continue and be brought to a conclusion.
