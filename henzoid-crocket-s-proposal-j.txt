> You find the access tunnel, hidden within a Wendy's bathroom stall. 
> 
> You don't need a key card, the door is a jar. You grab some pickles and move on.
> 
> It smells here. Duh. You're in a public bathroom, idiot.
> 
> There is a slick trail that leads from the stall next to you and into the depths of the site. If it's blood or shit, or something that smeared off one of those //things//[[footnote]] humans [[/footnote]], you cannot tell. You make a point to avoid it.
> 
> You're still receiving the distress signal. Sighing, you turn your pager off.
> 
> Your footsteps echo throughout grimy sewers. You wish the site wasn't in such a gross, horrible place, but then again, so do //they//.
> 
> Elevator is down, so you take the stairs, ending on floor B935: The Authorization Hub. You run for literally hours because 935 floors is a lot of fucking stairs. 
> 
> You try not to think about [[[*SCP-087|087]]]. 
> 
> The trail takes you to another Wendy's, which is really weird, because you are very far underground. The door is closed, so you grab a big rock and throw it as hard as you can at the door. It opens with ease, because it wasn't even locked, you just didn't check. Dumbass.
> 
> Something throws itself at you like a horny teenager with daddy issues and tries to confront you. You tell it to piss off and run past it.
> 
> It seems hurt, and leaves. 
> 
> You finally find the source of the signal in a room near the back. It's dark and covered in trash, as if the resident was raised by raccoons and could never successfully navigate the social norms of humans.
> 
> The single desk lamp casts a gray haze on a copy of playboy magazine. You attempt to open it, but the pages are sealed shut. It emanates a smell so bad that it almost smells good, like a shit covered integer overflow.Â Â It smells like a masturbating hobo with syphilis, like, I'm talking really going at it -- two hands and everything. It smells so bad it doesnâ€™t even deserve a goofy simile. Itâ€™s ruined the concept.
> 
> You scan the room. Soiled clothes, half eaten food. Despite the presence of an adjoining restroom, there is excrement in a bucket in the corner. A hole connected to the kitchen suggests a diet of only chicken wings, as the entrance to the hole is stained with special sauce.
> 
> There's grease on the floor, forming a sickening puddle. You spot three cans - further inspection reveals them to be expired bud-light. They're all empty.
> 
> There's a desk with a computer atop it. Approaching the terminal, you can see an Alienware logo clearly pressed into the side.
> 
> You take a seat. Turn it on.

+++ Revision 6/9 updated {{A Whole Buncha}} days ago
[[include component:image-block name=WendyBreaks.png|caption=SCP-001-Ex, minutes after its activation. Photographer unknown.|width=300px]]

**Item #:** [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/shaggydredlocks-proposal SCP-001-Ex] 

**Object Class:** Apollyon

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to its nature, SCP-001-Ex cannot be contained. Survivors of the SCP-001-Ex event are to keep in touch, because it gets lonely out here. And no, I don't mean keep in touch like "let's add each other on Snapchat and then talk like 2 times a year," I mean like, share cool things that happen and actually have conversations. Just because we're not in the same physical space doesn't mean we can't still "hang out" with each other, and I'll be damned if I let distance be the thing that gives me another excuse to be antisocial. God.

Anyways, Personnel are advised not to go outdoors, for danger of being overtaken by SCP-001-Ex-A instances, and I of all people know that is a very very bad idea. Avoid all heavily populated areas, because they are absolutely crawling with those things, and I do not need more on my hands than I already have. 

Personnel are also to be advised that, despite SCP-001-Ex-A's apparent ties to Site-96 Researcher Karen Day, she is by no means responsible for this mess, and those who consider her to be are essentially victim-blaming.

Personnel stationed at Site-19 are to lock the fucking doors and hope to god there are still janitors in the building.

To those of you with families, or God forbid, children - That sucks.

**Description:** SCP-001-Ex is the designation given to the Sun, after an event on {{[SYSTEM ERROR]}} [[size smaller]]//Data lost: beep boop system.exe has failed ... rebooting. Please delete system-32 or contact Wendy's finger-lickin-good customer service.//[[/size]] resulting in ~6.9 billion exposures within the first twenty-four hours. The SCP-001-Ex effect stems from visible light, as well as, in some rare cases, visible dark. For more information on the differences between visible light and ultraviolet light, please visit your local pre-school.

Upon contact with visible light produced by SCP-001-Ex, living organisms instantly transform into a pile of writhing goo. Visually, this is reminiscent of my fatass grandpa Earl every time he tries to sit down. 

Upon completion, these piles of goo (SCP-001-Ex-A) begin wiggling and jiggling about, until their shape looks sorta like a person again, though studies have shown that they still look like goo, and are fooling literally no one.

It doesn't affect animals because gross.

Due to their goo-ness, instances of SCP-001-Ex-A that make contact with one another become a bigger piece of goo. Even though this seems like it would be beneficial, it actually makes the goo way slower and dumber, and it usually just ends in the instance collapsing on itself and crying in shame. In these cases, SCP-001-Ex-A instances may be heard attempting to form rudimentary phrases such as "never love me, too fat" and "wish went more gym."

SCP-001-Ex-A instances have one main priority, and it's fucking bullshit. As soon as they are physically able, they will begin using any method possible, including walking, running, or hitching a ride, to attempt to position themselves closer, but not too close, to Researcher Day. Using what's left of their vocal systems, they will attempt to persuade her to become romantically involved with [DATE EXPUNGED]. This has never proven successful, and never will, because fuck [DATE EXPUNGED], I said never again and I meant it!
