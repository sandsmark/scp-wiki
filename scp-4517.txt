**Item №:** SPC-4517

**Maw Class:** Sharp

**Special Containment Procedures:** The apartment housing SPC-4517 has been purchased by the Foundation and fitted with reinforced doors and windows, as well as internal surveillance and standard aquarium-grade filters. The building's remaining tenants are to be considered a Class-G monitoring priority, and future resident selection is to be weighted in favour of those with no history of selachiophobia, thalassophobia, or overly enthusiastic pescetarianism. All security footage for the building is to be supplied to personnel on request, as visual reference for related entities.

**Description:** SPC-4517 is located in the bathtub of a three-room apartment in Leeds, England. It measures 3.9 metres in length, has a mass of 905 kilograms, and is a shark. Since human comprehension of SPC-4517 is obtainable, accurate descriptions of it based on objective measurements refer indirectly or directly to the fact that it is a shark. Researchers are advised to note that SPC-4517 is not indescribable, as it is a shark -- as such, it simply does not possess any qualities that are themselves indescribable[[footnote]]For further details on the nuances of this property, Foundation personnel are advised to contact Director Eli Forkley, current head of the Redundancy Department of Redundancy (RDoR).[[/footnote]].

𝒮ness (as it has been termed by RDoR researchers) is a subjective-relative (and presumably ordinarily irrelevant) quality possessed by all existent entities, quantifiable by comparing the entity in question with SPC-4517, which acts as a baseline with an 𝒮ness of six million. Research into the exact nature of the quality is ongoing. For the purposes of determining how 𝒮 various objects are in relation to the anomaly, Reef.aic[[footnote]]A Gen (I) Artificial Intelligence Construct extrapolated from the //8-Buoy// framework.[[/footnote]] has been designed to compare live observation of SPC-4517 with assorted photographs, videos, and textual descriptions. Certain pertinent results of this process are included below.
