**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation web crawlers are to search for any mention of SCP-XXXX instances. Web content discussing SCP-XXXX or SCP-XXXX-A are to be taken down. All persons affected by SCP-XXXX instances are to be sought out and apprehended under the pretence of going through immediate tattoo removal therapy due to a production mistake in the ink used by SCP-XXXX-A. Apprehended individuals are to be contained in a Standard Humanoid Containment Cell until after the conclusion of the Superbia-Event, at which point they are to be amnesticized and released.

SCP-XXXX-A is currently uncontained, but reports of activities matching the behaviour of SCP-XXXX-A are to be investigated.



**Description:** SCP-XXXX is the collective designation given to a series of anomalous tattoos, currently on the body of fourteen subjects in containment and an unknown number still uncontained. Two months after acquisition by an individual, SCP-XXXX instances develop the abilities to change shape and move through skin cells, as well as to react to outside stimuli. The specific way these abilities manifest is unique for all instances and dependant on the subject of the tattoo.

Four weeks after a subject has been tattooed with an instance of SCP-XXXX, they will undergo a Superbia Event. A Superbia Event is the complete transfiguration of the affected flesh into the likeness of the respective SCP-XXXX instance, which will proceed to expel itself from the body of the subject, typically leaving behind large avulsion. There have, however, also been unique Superbia Events which only partially adhere to this description or not at all.



**Discovery:**
On 2018/07/21, videos depicting the anomalous effects of SCP-XXXX instances started to appear on the social media platform Twitter. A disinformation campaign was immediately put into action and the first containment procedures were devised and executed but could not prevent the initial spread of information about SCP-XXXX. This led to a rise in popularity for SCP-XXXX-A and the creation of a significant number of SCP-XXXX instances. 

During interrogation, all subjects unanimously report acquiring their instance at a tattoo parlour named "Pride Parlor" in Berlin, Germany. The business was previously owned by SCP-XXXX-A, a person of unknown identity, responsible for the creation of all SCP-XXXX instances according to interrogated subjects. When Foundation forces arrived at the address the building was empty and SCP-XXXX-A could not be found. Despite all interrogated subjects supposedly meeting SCP-XXXX-A face to face, and being fully conscious while receiving their instance, none of them could comment on any specifics regarding SCP-XXXX-A, except for repeated insistence on their skilful handling of the tattoo gun and pleasant appearance.

**Addendum SCP-XXXX.1: Overview of SCP-XXXX instances currently in containment**
Below is a table with a selection of examples for SCP-XXXX instances currently in containment.

A black line wrapping around the wrist of the subject, forming a lemniscate on the underside. It is animated as if moving around the arm, tracing its path.

Superbia Event

[[cell class="table-cell" colspan="2"]]
While the lemniscate remained a two-dimensional tattoo, the black line converted into a black string and detached itself off of one side of the symbol.

Post Superbia Event

Pulling on the string produces a seemingly infinite amount of it. It is made up of tattoo ink but retains shape and consistency through anomalous means.

[[/row]]
[[row]]
[[hcell class="table-hcell"]]
Further Handlings
[[/cell]]
[[cell class="table-cell" colspan="2"]]
The usage of the string as a resource has been denied due to it dissolving in water and leaving ink stains upon touch. It was instead decided to neutralize the instance by completely dissolving it in water, leaving only the non-anomalous tattoo of the lemniscate. The subject was amnesticized and released.

The Superbia Event procedurally converted the tattoo into a live Eastern Green Mamba starting at the head and ending at the tip of the tail, at which point it fell onto the ground and fled to a corner in the room.

 A simplified drawing of the subject's daughters, both of whom had died in a fire six years prior. They spend several hours a day walking around or playing with each other and otherwise lie down. When their names are called they look around with a confused expression.

Superbia Event
[[/cell]]
[[cell class="table-cell" colspan="2"]]
Over two days, fat tissue in the subject's body travelled towards the instance where it formed a growing lump. Shortly after the subject was brought into the site's medical bay due to extreme malnutrition, the lump burst, expelling a large amount of fluid and two live human newborns, connected to the arm of the subject by an umbilical cord.

Post Superbia Event

[[cell class="table-cell" colspan="2"]]
The subject was continually fed high-calorie solutions. The newborns continued to grow and age at different speeds, reaching the age of their death within one month. They remained in a coma-like state during this time. When the endpoint was reached, they gained full consciousness, as well as the memories and personalities of the late daughters of the subject, according to her words.

As both children tested anatomically, psychologically and genetically non-anomalous, both them and the subject were amnesticized and released.
