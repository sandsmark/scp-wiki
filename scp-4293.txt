[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]**Item #:** SCP-2943

**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2943-A is currently within the boundaries of Site-51. A digital display showing the current date and time is to be kept within visible range of this manifestation point at all times. A timer counting down until precisely 8,640 minutes have elapsed since the previous SCP-2943 manifestation is to be kept running at all times, and reset as required. Tests conducted with any SCP-2943 instances are to be catalogued in the SCP-2943 Testing Log.

All instances of SCP-2943-1 are to be catalogued according to manifestation time and stored accordingly. New instances of SCP-2943-1 are to be timestamped immediately for ease of cataloguing.

Instances of SCP-2943-2 are to be processed similarly to SCP-2943-1 before being transported to Lunar Area-32, to facilitate satellite imagery of the Earth as depicted through each instance, to assist in determining the cause of their manifestations. SCP-2943-2 are to be stored at Site-51 when not in use, separately from SCP-2943-1 instances.[[/span]]
[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]][[collapsible show="Additional procedures for Level 3 or higher personnel only." hide="Displaying additional procedures."]][[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]SCP-2943 storage areas are to be frequently inspected for the appearance of SCP-2943-3 instances. The content of SCP-2943-3 instances is to be recorded and available information utilised to prevent the reoccurance of any observed K-Class scenarios. Information regarding SCP-2943-3 instances is restricted to Level 3 or higher clearance.[[/collapsible]]

In the event of an impending severe K-Class scenario,[[/span]] Procedure [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]SATURN[[/span]] LAMENT is [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]to be[[/span]] initiated as a last resort. [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]Under no other circumstances whatsoever are any potentially destructive tests to be conducted on any SCP-2943 instances.[[/span]]

**Procedure [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]SATURN[[/span]] LAMENT:** Information [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]detailing[[/span]] pivotal [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]events regarding the imminent K-Class scenario, such as events that directly instigated the event or alternate outcomes that were not explored,[[/span]] are [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]to be[[/span]] left exposed [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]within reasonable distance of SCP-2943-A  until an SCP-2943-1 or SCP-2943-2 instance manifests[[/span]]. [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]Once this has occurred, --an available SCP-2943-1 or SCP-2943-2 instance that manifested prior to the first event pivotal to the impending K-Class scenario-- the most recently manifested SCP-2943-1 or SCP-2943-2 instance is to be destroyed by any means necessary.[[/span]]

**Item #:** SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3924[[/span]]

[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]**Object Class:** --Euclid-- --Uncontained/Neutralised-- Euclid[[/span]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3924[[/span]] [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]should be monitored via sonar at all times for any atypical behaviour. Records of its courses and speeds should be catalogued.

Non-Foundation vessels[[/span]] must remain [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]within 3,500 metres of sea-level while with[[/span]]in the [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]Hellenic Trench[[/span]] region. All [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]vessels[[/span]] attempting to[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]], or successfully,[[/span]] surpass [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]a depth of 3,[[/span]]50[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]0[[/span]] metres must be apprehended, questioned [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]and amnestised, if recoverable[[/span]]. Lethal force is permitted [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]if vessels resist apprehension[[/span]].

[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]--All manned Foundation vessels must remain above 4,000 metres below surface at all times while within the Hellenic Trench region.--[[/span]] All [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]manned[[/span]] Foundation [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]vessels[[/span]] must remain [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]at least 20 km[[/span]] away from SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3924[[/span]] at all times. [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]] (See: Addendum III.)[[/span]]

**Description:** SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3924[[/span]] is [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]a[[/span]] mobile[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]], submersible object that roams the hadal zone of the Hellenic Trench region[[/span]]. SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3924[[/span]] typically moves at 4[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]0[[/span]] km/h and at depths of 4,45[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]0 to 4,980[[/span]] metres below surface, but is capable of [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]reaching speeds of --55--[[/span]] 33[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]7[[/span]] km/h[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]][[footnote]][[span style="color:white"]]See: Addendum I.[[/span]][[/footnote]] and depths of 5,250 metres[[/span]]. In all encounters, SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3924[[/span]] has evaded [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]visual[[/span]] observation[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]; because of this, its approximate physical appearance is only known through sonar imaging (Depicted above)[[/span]].

[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]SCP-3924 perpetually emits an indeterminate sound, depending on its current “state”; although the sonics change depending on whether or not SCP-3924 is passively roaming or actively engaged in battle, --at no point does SCP-3924 cease emitting noise--. (See: Addendum III.) Because of SCP-3924’s normal depth, these sound are heavily distorted due to seawater; ongoing audio analysis has identified an ongoing rhythm between the various sounds, suggesting they may be musical in nature. To date, no patterns typical of vocalisations have yet been identified.[[/span]]

Whenever [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]a vessel approaches a depth of 4,100 metres below surface while within the Hellenic Trench region,[[/span]] SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3924[[/span]] enters an active state, [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]immediately changing course to intercept and broadcasting an alternate audio signature (unique to this state) directly at the encroaching vessel. This will continue until the vessel rises above a varying depth.[[footnote]][[span style="color:white"]]Typically around the same depth at which SCP-3924 entered its active state, but has been known to increase or decrease by up to 200 metres, depending on the vessel's rate of ascension.[[/span]][[/footnote]]

If the offending vessel dives below 4,100 metres,[[/span]] SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3924[[/span]] becomes hostile and will attack [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]by use of incendiary torpedoes and/or rising mines[[/span]]; SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3924[[/span]] will become increasingly aggressive in tactics [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]the longer the vessel is below the 4,100 metre threshold, the deeper it gets, and[[/span]] the more aggressive the [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]vessel becomes in[[/span]] retaliation [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]](if at all)[[/span]]. SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3924[[/span]] will continue attacking until [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]the encroaching vessel either rises above 4,100 metres below surface, or is[[/span]] catastrophically destroyed; [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]due to the fact SCP-3924’s primary strategy[[/span]] appears to be focused upon [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]rupturing ballast tanks,[[/span]] the [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]latter is the most common[[/span]] outcome. If [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]a vessel[[/span]] rises above [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]the[[/span]] 4,[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]1[[/span]]00-metre [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]threshold[[/span]], SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3924[[/span]] will immediately cease [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]attacking, but will remain in an[[/span]] active state [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]until the vessel rises above a “sufficient” depth[[/span]].

[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]SCP-3924 periodically enters an active/hostile state in the absence of any encroaching vessels; in all such cases, SCP-3924 appears to broadcast, and attack, an indeterminate object/entity between it and the seafloor. To date, sonar has failed to detect any such objects/entities.[[/span]]

**Addendum I:** [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]Incident 3924-A[[/span]]

On [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]January 9,[[/span]] 2018, [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]SCP-3924 entered a hostile state and began firing munitions towards the seabed. During this time,[[/span]] a [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]pre-prepared and un[[/span]]man[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]ned submersible[[/span]] was deployed [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]several hundred kilometres away[[/span]] in an attempt to reach [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]the Hellenic Trench seafloor while[[/span]] SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3924[[/span]] [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]was preoccupied[[/span]].

[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]Once the submersible passed the 4,100-metre threshold, SCP-3924 immediately began firing torpedoes in its direction, despite showing no awareness of the submersible beforehand. SCP-3924 made no attempts to intercept the submersible, apparently prioritising the unseen threat below it.[[/span]]

After thirteen minutes, SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3924[[/span]] [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]ceased firing towards the seafloor and[[/span]] immediately changed course to intercept [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]the submersible (which had reached a depth of 4,954 metres). SCP-3924 rapidly accelerated to 337 km/h[[/span]], reaching [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]the submersible[[/span]] within several minutes and destroying it -- [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]sonar[[/span]] observation detected portions of SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3924’s[[/span]] [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]hull[[/span]] shedding during this [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]manoeuvre[[/span]].

SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3924[[/span]] then ascended to a depth of 4,50[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]0[[/span]] metres [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]and began deploying rising mines in an attempt[[/span]] to damage [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]or sink ships at[[/span]] the [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]sea’s[[/span]] surface; [DATA REDACTED], [DATA REDACTED] [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]and[[/span]] [DATA REDACTED] [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]were[[/span]] critically damaged [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]and sunk[[/span]]. SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3924[[/span]] remained aggressive [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]to surface vessels[[/span]] for [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]a further[[/span]] three hours, after which it resumed normal behaviour. To date, this is the only time SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3924[[/span]] has attacked [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]vessels[[/span]] outside [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]of[[/span]] its active zone.

[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]Further attempts to surpass the 4,100 metre threshold are strictly forbidden.[[/span]]

**Addendum II:** Incident [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3924-B[[/span]]

On [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]April 3,[[/span]] 2018, SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3924[[/span]] [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]again entered a hostile state in response to an undetected threat. Unlike previous renditions, SCP-3924 continuously fired towards the seafloor for 334 consecutive hours[[footnote]][[span style="color:white"]]Fourteen days.[[/span]][[/footnote]], during which it[[/span]] progressively descended to a depth of 5,250 metres.

[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]On April 17, SCP-3924 ceased firing and began broadcasting a previously unrecorded audio signature in all directions;[[/span]] three minutes later, SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3924[[/span]] [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]rapidly descended towards the seafloor, but[[/span]] disappeared from sonar detection [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]immediately prior to impact[[/span]].

Attempts to locate SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3924[[/span]] [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]or its wreckage throughout the Hellenic Trench[[/span]], either through sonar or visual detection, [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]are currently ongoing, but[[/span]] are thus far inconclusive.

SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3924[[/span]] tentatively reclassified Uncontained/Neutralised.

**Addendum III:** Incident [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3924-C[[/span]]

On [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]April 20,[[/span]] 2018, SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3924[[/span]] was detected [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]by sonar within the Calypso Deep region of the Hellenic Trench,[[/span]] approximately 7[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]5[[/span]] km from where it disappeared. [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]Sonar imaging shows that SCP-3924 appears to have suffered catastrophic rupturing of most, if not all, ballast tanks, but is attempting to ascend under (assumed) thruster propulsion alone.[[/span]] Since reappearance, SCP-3924’s behaviour has drastically changed[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]; SCP-3924 will only respond to vessels within a 15 km radius, which it will aggressively fire upon, and SCP-3924 no longer produces any detectable audio[[/span]].

[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]SCP-3924, at its current heading and speed, is estimated to return to its regular roaming zone by 23 March, 2019.[[/span]]

Proposals to rescind approved requests are to be submitted to the Ethics Committee[[/span]]; [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]any other[[/span]] attempts by staff to impede [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]approved requests[[/span]] will result in severe reprimands [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]at the discretion of the Overseer Council. The full list of approved and rejected requests are outlined in Document 2493-1; “//Approved & rejected requests by SCP-2493-1 for updates to containment procedures[[/span]].//[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]”[[/span]]

[[collapsible show="Special Containment Procedures (Revision 1)" hide="Note: These procedures are no longer in effect!"]]
[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]SCP-2493-1 is to wear SCP-2493-2 at all times. SCP-2493-1 is to be kept in its modified humanoid containment cell at Lunar Area-32. The cell is to be filled with pure helium gas at a pressure of approximately 20 kilopascals, and kept at a temperature of approximately 280 Kelvin. The interior of the room is to be kept above a minimum of 270 Kelvin, to ensure continued biological function of SCP-2493-1.[[/span]] The interior surface of SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]2493-1[[/span]]'s containment cell is to be padded with a three centimetre thick layer of soft rubber. No sharp corners or points are to be present within SCP-2493-1's cell; all such corners or points are to be removed or padded.  [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]In the event of SCP-2493-2 becoming punctured, it and[[/span]] SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]2493-1[[/span]] [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]are to be immediately jettisoned from the facility. MTF Gamma-4 ("Blondebeard's Crew")[[/span]] is to be [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]notified to adjust the trajectory of the anomaly as required, and to[[/span]] prevent [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]it[[/span]] from [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]entering the earth's atmosphere and[[/span]] causing a [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]U[[/span]]K-Class [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]Global Irradiation[[/span]] event.

**Description:** [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]SCP-2493 is the collective designation for two components; SCP-2493-1 and SCP-2493-2.[[/span]]

SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]2493-1[[/span]] is a male humanoid entity [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]approximately 1.7 meters in height, and weighing approximately 95 kilograms[[/span]]. SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]2493-1[[/span]] is [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]composed entirely of antimatter, but[[/span]] physically [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]appears to be[[/span]] an ordinary human. SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]2493-1[[/span]] [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]responds to the name of Joe Smith, and[[/span]] claims to originate from an alternate dimension [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]composed primarily of substances with similar atomic composition to his[[/span]]. Psychological evaluation of SCP-2493-1 has revealed that it suffers [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]from nostophobia[[footnote]][[span style="color:white"]]The fear of returning home.[[/span]][[/footnote]] --and[[/span]][[/span]] an obsession with completing their mission--. [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]] (See Addendums)

SCP-2493-2 is a suit composed entirely of a previously undiscovered and currently poorly-understood substance that SCP-2493-1 refers to as ‘Buffer’, superficially resembling an airtight type 1 hazmat suit. This substance is entirely non-baryonic in nature, uniformly reflects all wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation resulting in a mirrored surface, and is also capable of preventing interaction between matter and antimatter. These properties prevent the contents of anything composed of this material from being examined by use of X-ray scanning, and severely impede physical examination. The material comprising SCP-2493-2 is flexible in a manner comparable to rubber, but has a texture consistent with polished metal. An impermeable barrier replaces the substance around SCP-2493-1’s facial region, serving as a two-way visor. The interior of the suit is also capable of emitting light from an undetermined source, and will do so upon instruction by SCP-2493-1.

On the back of SCP-2493-2 is a multifunctional backpack that serves as an air recycler, --a method of exchanging resources obtained by SCP-2493-1 for canned provisions,--[[footnote]][[span style="color:white"]]This feature has now become non-functional (See Addendum 3).[[/span]][[/footnote]] and an airtight input for canned provisions. SCP-2493-1 has never been observed to physically ingest these supplies; the entity states that this is attributable to nanites present within the interior of the suit, which constantly reassemble small sections of food within his mouth whenever available. --It is theorized that the device is connected to SCP-2493-1's reality of origin via a stable extradimensional anomaly in the device, as this is the only reasonable explanation of how the provided waste materials can be converted into edible substances composed of antimatter.--[[/span]]

[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]][[collapsible show="+ Addendum 1: Information Summary" hide="- Showing summary."]]
[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]The following is a list of information regarding SCP-2493-1’s origins, obtained during several interviews. --It should be noted that the only source of such information is the entity itself, and as such cannot be confirmed to be factual.-- (See Addendum 3.)[[/span]]

* [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]SCP-2493-1 originates from an alternate reality (Henceforth 2493’) consisting entirely of antimatter.[[/span]]

* [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]The society of 2493’ has access to or has developed technology that is significantly more advanced than that of our own, with such technology requiring large quantities of electrical energy to operate, typically exceeding the range of petajoules on a daily basis.[[/span]]

* [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]Technology within 2493’ --approximately 200 years ago-- 173 years ago produced large quantities of waste materials as by-products of their operation. Such technology has since been adapted to recycle their waste materials. These produced waste materials were transported to a poorly-understood location of abnormal geometry, described as being physically located between two of the three axis present within normal three-dimensional space.[[/span]]

* [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]After --an undefined period of time-- 40 years the inhabitants of this space began transporting their own waste materials to 2493’, with several described objects exhibiting anomalous phenomena sufficient to be classified as SCPs. This prompted the inhabitants of 2493’ to develop devices capable of severely hindering the transit of such waste material.[[/span]]

* [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]An unidentified object, presumed to be of abnormal geometric origin, initiated an XK-Class Vacuum Decay within 2493’. Technology developed specifically to counter such a scenario spontaneously activates, protecting a small portion of 2493’ from the event; however, such technology is required to be powered continuously in order to sustain such protection.[[/span]]

* [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]Numerous working-class citizens of 2493’ have been deployed to alternate realities to obtain matter and transport it back, for the purpose of powering antimatter reactors.[[/span]]

> [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]On ██/██/██, contact with 2493’ was successfully established by use of a 4 MHz radio wave transmitted through the extradimensional anomaly located on the rear of SCP-2493-2. The superiors of SCP-2493-1 apologized for the extended period of time taken for them to respond, and requested to speak to SCP-2493-1 personally. Several of SCP-2493-1’s claims, as well as additional false claims, were requested for confirmation to ensure that cooperative disinformation could not be attempted; all claims made by SCP-2493-1 (detailed in Addendum 1) were clarified and confirmed as true, with all additional false claims being denied. SCP-2493-1 was allowed to communicate with his superiors, and was noted to praise Lunar Area-32 staff repeatedly throughout their conversation, promoting trading prospects.

> On ██/██/██, negotiations for trade between representatives of 2493’ and the O5 Council was conducted. It was agreed that in return for digital information regarding assorted 2493’ technology, the Foundation was to provide a continuous supply of matter in the form of waste material. The bulk of this waste material was sourced from the five major ocean gyres and various global landfills.
> 
> The majority of the information received from 2493’ was oriented towards containment or destruction of anomalous entities, specializing in entities, objects or locations with abnormal geometric properties. Additional information enabled large advances in medical science, and artificial food production. Schematics for an antimatter reactor were also utilized to create the prototype FAM-Reactor.
> 
> Further negotiations were conducted to obtain controlled amounts of antimatter from 2493’ in return for random samples of modern music.[[/span]]

> On ██/██/██, [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]Lunar[[/span]] Area-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]32[[/span]] received a transmission [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]from 2493’ stating that several devices critical to the continued existence of 2493’ were failing due to physical strain due to their extended usage. The Foundation was informed that while maintenance would delay total failure, 2493’ was expected to be destroyed within a year[[/span]].
> 
> [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]Several weeks later a second transmission was received, stating that the devices preventing 2493’ from receiving waste material from the location of abnormal geometry had outright failed, and that 2493’ was now being overrun with severely detrimental anomalous objects.[[/span]] Staff at [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]Lunar[[/span]] Area-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]32[[/span]] was advised to prepare to receive [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]several objects essential to ensuring[[/span]] SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]2493-1’s[[/span]] [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]continued biological function. Several devices constructed of the same material as SCP-2493-2 manifested a short distance outside Lunar Area-32, including a large room with airlock capable of safely containing SCP-2493-1 in a vacuum environment, which has since been relocated away from the Area, connected via high-speed rail and further reinforced[[/span]].

> [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]On ██/██/██, a large burst of digital information was received from 2493’, primarily consisting of historic records of 2493’, photographs of various regions of 2493’ and several schematics for devices capable of recycling various non-biodegradable materials into reusable resources.[[/span]] All information received has been archived [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]as required[[/span]].

[[tab SCP-3492]]
**Item #:** SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3492[[/span]]

[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]**Object Class:** Euclid[[/span]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3492[[/span]] should be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]SCP-3492 can be supplied with rewards in return for compliance. SCP-3492 must be fed a standard regimen of three meals each day.[[/span]]

Staff are advised to exhibit caution while in proximity with SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3492[[/span]], as [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]the spatial distortions[[/span]] it [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]experiences[[/span]] may cause [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]unintentional[[/span]] harm to nearby individuals.

**Description:** SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3492[[/span]] is a Caucasian male human [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]claiming to be named "dicks mcSquigee"[[/span]].[[footnote]] [[span style="color:white"]]Despite grammatical inaccuracy, SCP-3492 will always record its name without correct capitalisation.[[/span]][[/footnote]] DNA analysis has proven inconclusive[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]], as collected samples are subject to microscale replications of the entity’s properties, and will spontaneously demanifest after indeterminate periods of time[[/span]].

SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3492[[/span]] [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]sporadically[[/span]] undergoes prominent spatial and/or temporal distortions [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]centralised upon random portions of the entity’s body[[/span]]. These distortions vary [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]in duration and content[[/span]], but typically involve one [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]of[[/span]] or multiple of the following:
* Dislocation of bodily portions[[footnote]] [[span style="color:white"]]This includes joints and/or limbs.[[/span]][[/footnote]] to another [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]fixed[[/span]] position [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]relative to the remainder of SCP-3492[[/span]];
* [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]Over or underexaggerated movement of bodily portions along a single axis, frequently resulting in the above
* Over or underexaggerated rotation of jointed limbs, frequently to physically impossible extents;[[/span]]
* (Supposed) rotation or movement [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]of bodily portions[[/span]] along or around unobservable, higher spatial dimensions;
* Spontaneous loss of [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]one or more[[/span]] spatial dimensions, resulting in SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3492[[/span]] converting into a lower-dimensional form;
* Prominently [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]slowed or[[/span]] accelerated motion [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]of bodily portions[[/span]];
* Apparent motion of limbs independently from SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3492[[/span]];
* [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]Motion of bodily portions occurring in an inverted manner;
* Pseudo-[[/span]]precognitive abilities [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]resulting from SCP-3492 briefly undergoing a period of inverted time[[/span]];

Of note is that [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]affected portions of[[/span]] SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3492[[/span]] appear to be selectively intangible [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]to the remainder of the entity, enabling limbs to pass through other limbs unaffected, and enabling joints to rotate freely upon all axis while affected[[/span]]. Because of this, SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]3492[[/span]] does not suffer from injuries [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]related to its effects, but does experience discomfort[[/span]]. 

SCP-3492 claims its properties stem from the fact it is [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]a component of a partially-functional program developed by the TotleighSoft corporation as a proof-of-concept intended to promote interest in a physics engine[[/span]] being developed. [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]The entity's respective instance of this program (designated SCP-3492-A) has yet to be recovered.

SCP-3492 was recovered during the 2017 Electronic Entertainment Expo, wherein it was attending as part of, and maintaining, an exhibition booth catalogued to be reserved for the TotleighSoft corporation. All attending civilians that observed SCP-3492 prior to recovery were amnestised.[[/span]]

[[tab Non-Standard Designation "TYRFING"]]
**Item #:** SCP-[[span style=“color:#f5f5f5”]]████[[/span]]

[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]**Alternate Designation:**[[/span]] Non-Standard Designation [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]"TYRFING"[[/span]]

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]A physical manuscript containing “TYRFING” infectious information must be kept at all times. This manuscript is to be used solely to create a digital file that can be duplicated if all other sources of “TYRFING” infection are lost.[[/span]]

A digital file [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]containing “TYRFING” infectious material[[/span]] must be kept [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]on an otherwise empty portable storage device[[/span]], access to which must be restricted[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]] to personnel assigned to “TYRFING”[[/span]]. [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]At[[/span]] no [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]point should the original file be opened and viewed;[[/span]] testing[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]] subjects should be exposed to copies of the file during testing only[[/span]].

Communication [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]with “+TYRFING” subjects[[/span]] must be conducted exclusively via a specialised messaging program developed to automatically censor [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]] “TYRFING”[[/span]] infectious information. Personnel attempting to circumvent this must be severely reprimanded.

[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]To minimise disruption during reassignment post-“TYRFING” infection,[[/span]] personnel [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]assigned to “TYRFING” are not authorised to know its numerical designation and[[/span]] must refer to the anomaly by its [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]alternate[[/span]] designation[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]] instead[[/span]].

**Description:** Non-Standard Designation [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]"TYRFING"[[/span]] is [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]an [[/span]]info[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]allergenic[[footnote]][[span style="color:white"]]Infoallergenic anomalies are an uncommon class of infohazard, capable of exhibiting both memetic and antimemetic properties.[[/span]][[/footnote]][[/span]] [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]information-based concept. "TYRFING" is[[/span]] not restricted to any specific medium[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]] — any method of surveying or storing information is capable of surveying or storing "TYRFING"[[/span]]. Individuals or documents that contain explicit information [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]of "TYRFING"[[/span]] are infected by the anomaly, and are henceforth referred to as "+[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]TYRFING[[/span]]".[[footnote]]"[[span style="color:white"]]TYRFING[[/span]]" positive.[[/footnote]]

[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]Sapient[[/span]] "+[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]TYRFING[[/span]]" [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]hosts[[/span]] are compelled to [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]compare "TYRFING" to other concepts they are aware of; these comparisons can[[/span]] be arbitrary and nonsensical[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]], but all relate or compare the two concepts in some manner[[/span]]. Testing has shown that [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]while in its initial infection phase,[[/span]] "[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]TYRFING[[/span]]" exhibits potent mnestic properties, enabling "+[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]TYRFING[[/span]]" [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]hosts[[/span]] to recall [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]all[[/span]] details of "[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]TYRFING[[/span]]" [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]and all comparisons or relations made with other concepts[[/span]] — [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]no[[/span]] amnestic treatment utilised by the Foundation has impeded this property. Hosts show signs of an anomalous compulsion to spread "[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]TYRFING[[/span]]"[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]], frequently attempting to survey[[/span]] information to individuals they believe are unaffected.

[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]When a sapient "+TYRFING" host believes they have infected another individual with "TYRFING", the anomaly will enter its second phase. The success of this attempt is irrelevant; if the host believes they have exposed another individual to "TYRFING", the secondary properties will initiate. During this secondary phase "TYRFING", and all concepts the host (who is designated "-TYRFING" from then on) related to it, will exhibit antimemetic properties for the host alone — they will be unable to recall any information relating to the concept/s. As with the memetic properties of "TYRFING", no mnestic treatment developed thus far by the Foundation has impeded this property.[[/span]]

[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]"-TYRFING"[[/span]] individuals also experience [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]permanent[[/span]] perceptual alterations [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]that prevent them from perceiving any information that directly or indirectly exposes them to lost concepts; subjects show no response to visual, auditory or tactile mediums used to transfer such information[[/span]].[[span style=“color:#f5f5f5”]][[footnote]][[span style="color:white"]]”TYRFING”-Negative hosts claim that printed documents detailing “TYRFING” are blank, that personnel telling them about “TYRFING” mumble or become mute while speaking, and that surfaces with Braille imprinted upon them are blank or smooth in regions that contain information regarding “TYRFING”.[[/span]][[/span]][[/span]][[/span]][[/footnote]][[/span]]

The effects of "[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]TYRFING[[/span]]" are not limited to biological or even animate hosts; dummy [[[aiad-homescreen | AIC programs]]] have shown susceptibility [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]and[[/span]] similar [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]antimemetic impediment[[/span]] to biological [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]"-TYRFING"[[/span]] individuals.

Inanimate mediums of information storage suffer from [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]approximate analogues of[[/span]] "[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]TYRFING[[/span]]"'s antimemetic effect — [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]when an individual is infected by "TYRFING" via one of these mediums, the relevant information in the medium immediately becomes illegible or unintelligible to all individuals (including those unaffected by "TYRFING") in the case of visual and auditory mediums, respectively;[[/span]] digital information will become irreparably corrupt[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]], but will still occupy the same system space. Individuals unaffected by "TYRFING" attempting to read "-TYRFING" visual documents can acknowledge the presence of an inscription, but are unable to discern any meaning from it; similarly, they can also acknowledge recorded vocalisations, but cannot ascertain its content[[/span]].

“[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]TYRFING[[/span]]” was initially contained following an outbreak [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]in Site ██[[/span]]. The majority of staff positioned on-site [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]began suffering from inabilities to perceive randomised objects or concepts; as the lost concepts varied from staff to staff, a cognitohazardous infection was identified[[/span]] and the site was locked down [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]by personnel[[/span]]. First-response containment personnel were able to [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]create a non-infectious document approximating the anomaly and[[/span]] isolate [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]a[[/span]] “[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]TYRFING[[/span]]” [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]infectious document[[/span]] before succumbing to the anomaly’s [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]secondary[[/span]] properties.

[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]**Addendum 1:**[[/span]] Incident Log ████-01
[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]Three[[/span]] researchers were infected with “[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]TYRFING[[/span]]” during a scheduled round of testing [[span style=“color:#f5f5f5”]]with D-Class personnel[[/span]] on [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]10/04/[[/span]]2018. [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]The automated redaction system used to automatically censor attempts to communicate “TYRFING” infectious material during conversation between researchers and test subjects had been updated the day prior; however, the update caused a stack overflow to occur, disabling the program.

While “+TYRFING”, Junior Researcher █████ ██████[[footnote]][[span style="color:white"]]One of the infected researchers.[[/span]][[/footnote]] sent an indeterminate text message to an unknown phone number – due to Junior Researcher █████ being found to be suffering from the secondary properties of “TYRFING”, it is assumed that this text message contained “TYRFING” infectious content. Due to the antimemetic properties of the anomaly, Junior Researcher ██████ is unable to be questioned regarding these actions, nor can the recipient phone number be retrieved. An investigation is underway into whether[[/span]] this was a premeditated action[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]], or compliance with the compulsive effect[[/span]] of the anomaly.

**Addendum [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]2[[/span]]:**
Ongoing surveillance of [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]the three researchers involved with Incident ████-01 has revealed an additional, hereditary property of[[/span]] “[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]TYRFING[[/span]]”[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]; all offspring of Researcher [[span style=“color:#f5f5f5”]]███[[/span]] ███ that were conceived after 10/04/2018[[/span]] have shown [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]perceptual alterations identical to Researcher [[span style=“color:#f5f5f5”]]███[[/span]] ███; specifically,[[/span]] they are [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]all[[/span]] unable to [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]perceive or[[/span]] learn of the existence of [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]pears. Testing with the offspring has, however, shown that they are still susceptible to “TYRFING” infection and therefore, can experience further[[/span]] perceptual shifts.

[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]No abnormal genetic markers have yet been identified to correlate to “TYRFING” infection. Research into identifying potential “TYRFING” markers has been allocated as high-priority.[[/span]]

[[tab SCP-2394]]
[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]**Item #:** SCP-2394

**Object Class:** Euclid[[/span]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]2394[[/span]] is to be kept in a chemically-induced dream state [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]at the veterinarian wing of Bio-Site 84[[/span]]. SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]2394[[/span]] is to be supplied with nutritional package [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]NP2394[[/span]] by [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]method of[[/span]] intravenous drip. Should SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]2394[[/span]] awaken pre-emptively, [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]no less than two veterinarian[[/span]] staff are to respond immediately and resume SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]2394[[/span]]'s dream state. 

[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]SCP-2394's mental health is to be observed once per week by use of accessing its neurological files using "2394filing.exe", and a complete copy of all files should be made once per bi-annual period. Attempts to alter the neurological files of SCP-2394 are to be approved by the site director prior to execution. Research staff assigned to SCP-2394 are authorised to monitor SCP-2394's dreams by use of the "2394REM.exe" program at any time.[[/span]] Research staff [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]not assigned to SCP-2394[[/span]] must be [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]granted permission by level 2 personnel[[/span]] assigned to [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]SCP-2394[[/span]] to monitor SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]2394's[[/span]] [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]dreams[[/span]].

SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]2394[[/span]] is [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]not to be neurologically accessed by any computer connected to any networks at the time, and is[[/span]] to be thoroughly scanned for [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]any potential manifestations of a digital[[/span]] consciousness [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]of SCP-2394 prior to connecting to any networks[[/span]].

**Description:** SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]2394[[/span]] is a single [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]instance of //Litoria caerulea//, or[[/span]] Australian [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]green tree frog[[/span]]. The entity is [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]genetically identical to common members of its species, and is[[/span]] physiologically normal [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]excluding several aspects added by SCP-2394's previous captors[[/span]].[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]] (See Addendum 3.)[[/span]]

The entity has [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]been surgically modified in several manners to[[/span]] extend its lifespan indefinitely[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]], the most prominent of which is an artificial injection site located above the left portion of the hipbone, and an anomalously-powered artificial heart that has yet to cease operation. SCP-2394 also has a Firewire (IEEE 1394) port surgically attached to the top of its skull; this port is directly connected to several parts of the entity's brain, enabling it to be monitored by use of appropriately formatted software. (See Addendum 1 & 2.) Observation of the entity's thought processes and actions have revealed that it is sapient[[/span]].

SCP-2394 can [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]instantly[[/span]] teleport to any location that it has previously physically observed. [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]The mechanism by which the entity is capable of relocating in this manner is unknown, as it does not feature any abnormal organs or genetic sequences from those of its species, and apparently had the ability prior to its surgical modification. (See Addendum 4.)[[/span]] SCP-2394 can activate this ability by certain conscious thoughts, and thus is unable to utilise its ability while unconscious or dreaming.[[footnote]][[span style="color:white"]]SCP-2394 has attempted to utilise its ability several times during its sleep. It has thus far failed to physically activate its effects; however, it is successful in relocating itself within its dreams.[[/span]][[/footnote]][[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]] No successful method of replicating the entity's anomalous properties have been determined, and all attempts to convey the ability to SCP-2394's offspring have failed, suggesting the ability may not be a genetic trait. SCP-2394 has thus far never teleported to a location depicted in a photograph or film, however if this is a conscious decision on its part or an actual limitation has not yet been determined. Documents obtained during[[/span]] SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]2394's[[/span]] [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]recovery state that the entity[[/span]] was capable of teleporting objects and organisms [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]along with itself, as long as they were in physical contact with it[[/span]]. This capability was a conscious decision by the entity[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]], however testing by Foundation researchers have thus far failed to replicate this effect[[/span]]. [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]Attempts to force SCP-2394 to relocate personnel with it are currently pending review by the Ethics Committee.[[/span]] SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]2394[[/span]] is able to teleport to certain locations on the Australian[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]], South American and African[[/span]] continent[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]s, the southern region of the United States, and the central region of Asia. 

SCP-2394 can be neurally interfaced with any device capable of receiving a signal from a Firewire 800 cable either directly or by use of an adapter. The entity does not internally contain downloadable driver software, which must be installed onto devices in order for them to interpret SCP-2394 as an external port.[[footnote]][[span style="color:white"]]Attempting to access SCP-2394 from a device that does not have the appropriate driver software installed will result in SCP-2394 appearing as an irreparable, corrupted external device.[[/span]][[/footnote]] The original software recovered during the raid in which the entity was recovered from has been reverse engineered and improved for testing purposes by Foundation technicians. Two separate programs have been developed that utilise this driver software; "2394filing.exe" and "2394REM.exe", both detailed below. It is currently unknown if SCP-2394 has the potential capability to upload its consciousness to a device via the Firewire connection, but precautions are to be taken to prevent it from uploading itself to the Foundation network or the Internet if it is capable.[[/span]]

[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]**Addendum 1:  2394filing.exe**
The 2394filing.exe software enable devices connected to interpret various aspects of SCP-2394's consciousness as text documents that are numerically ordered in an ascending fashion, with each file allocated a random numerical value. "2394filing.exe" has an inbuilt feature that enables researchers to locate specific files relating to a topic, context or content. SCP-2394 is always locked in a read-only state, preventing any files from being added, altered or deleted from the entity in any way. No method of 'unlocking' SCP-2394 has been determined thus far, if it is at all possible.[[/span]]

[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]**Addendum 2: 2394REM.exe**
The 2394REM.exe software enables researchers to monitor SCP-2394's delta sleep constructs in a visual and auditory format. 2394REM.exe renders the constructs as a three-dimensional environment that can be navigated by the user, however regions that are outside SCP-2394's field of vision are significantly less detailed than regions within and audio that the entity is not consciously aware of fades at a rate of 5 decibels per second.[[/span]]

Observations of SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]2394[[/span]] [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]using 2394REM.exe[[/span]] has shown that [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]it is unaware that it is in a dream state, and[[/span]] if conscious would actively avoid capture and containment [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]by any humanoid being[[/span]]. Also of note is that [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]SCP-2394 visualises itself as an ordinary frog of its species, with[[/span]] the distinguishing features of the entity absent from it[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]s person[[/span]].

**Addendum [[span style=“color:#f5f5f5”]]3[[/span]]:** Recovery [[span style=“color:#f5f5f5”]]log[[/span]]
SCP-2394 was recovered during a raid [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]on a Chaos Insurgency base of operations[[/span]]. Having studied the entity for [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]██[[/span]] years, they [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]had developed functional software drivers for SCP-2394 and[[/span]] were [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]utilising a prototype program in order to[[/span]] influence the entity to utilise its ability [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]for their benefit[[/span]]. Its anomalous capabilities were being utilised [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]to relocate high-priority personnel and items[[/span]] undetected. [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]The program was designed to automatically monitor the thought processes of the entity, and engaged a failsafe of cerebral overstimulation[[footnote]] [[span style="color:white"]]Specifically, the section associated with pain reception.[[/span]] [[/footnote]] to keep it contained on location. A similar method of electrical stimulation of specific areas of the brain associated with memories of locations was also utilised to induce SCP-2394 to use its abilities in a desired manner.[[/span]]

SCP-[[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]2394[[/span]] was showing signs of extreme distress upon retrieval, [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]and was discovered to have been exposed to a cognitohazardous agent designed to induce rapid brain death in an attempt to prevent acquisition of the entity by Foundation agents. The entity was improperly exposed to the agent, resulting in it[[/span]] functioning incorrectly and causing [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]an[[/span]] extreme mental strain [[span style="color:#f5f5f5"]]on the entity[[/span]].
