**Archived Preliminary Containment Procedures:** The area surrounding SCP-4608 is to be quarantined using the cover story of a toxic chemical spill. Following neutralization, the plot of land should be rendered incapable of supporting flora via the application of specialized herbicide PQ4608. 

Due to the circumstance of SCP-4608's recovery, no other containment procedures were developed.

**Description:**  SCP-4608 was a 60-acre apple orchard containing over 22,000 trees, located on the outskirts of Milan, Indiana. Engraved on approximately 75% of trees within SCP-4608 were thaumaturgic sigils and symbols relating to Norse mythology. 
>
Records indicate SCP-4608 was sown in 1826 by John Chapman,[[footnote]]An American pioneer commonly known as Johnny Appleseed.[[/footnote]] who maintained it until his death in 1845. John Chapman's obituary indicated he was the sole priest of the Allen County Church of Iðunn,[[footnote]]In Norse mythology, Iðunn is the goddess associated with apples and youth.[[/footnote]] though no records of a chapel or congregation exist.

Due to the circumstance of their discovery, little is known about SCP-4608-1 and SCP-4608-2. All information has been gathered from the first-hand accounts of MSF Agents and the response transcripts.
>
 SCP-4608-1 were organisms consisting of unidentified plant-like muscular structures and a periderm resembling those found on common hardwoods. Instances ranged in height from 5 cm to 3 m and were capable of locomotion. Instances of SCP-4608-1 were highly aggressive, displaying territorial and predatory behavior. 
>
SCP-4608-2 was a large apple tree with 13 human faces imbedded in its periderm. These faces were capable of speech, though the language used is currently unidentified. SCP-4608-2 was found at the center of SCP-4608 and was hostile, using its roots as a means of manipulation. 
>
**Discovery:** A local logging company had purchased the land on which SCP-4608 was located. During the first logging expedition within SCP-4608, a member of the crew died as a result of a safety equipment malfunction. Shortly after, all remaining crew members were declared dead or missing; the search party was also presumed missing. On October 14, 1947, the Foundation was alerted to the occurrences surrounding SCP-4608 by police reports accompanied by a photograph of an SCP-4608-1 instance. A week later Site-81 sent a three-man investigation team. All three agents were presumed dead after four days without contact.
>
Following the loss of communication with the investigation team,  Site-81 dispatched a high-risk response team, Mobile Strike Force Bravo-7 ("Hometown Heroes"), to handle the situation.

//[Camera pans to a small clearing of recently cut trees.]//

**ALPHA-1:** Alright. BETA Squad, you're heading east. GAMMA Squad, you're going west. Radio me in 30 minutes if you haven't found anything.

**BETA-1:** Got it, Cap. Switching channels.

**GAMMA-1:** Roger that. Move out boys, you heard the man. Switching-

**ALPHA-1:** ALPHA Squad on me. We're scoping out the incident site-- then we're movin' south.

**ALPHA-4:** The equipment is set up just over there. Probably a good place to start, Cap.

**ALPHA-1:** Well, no point in wasting time. Let's get this shit over with.

**ALPHA-7:** Let's. This place gives me the creeps.

//[ALPHA Squad begins approaching the logging equipment; several bodies can be seen.]// 

**ALPHA-5:** Christ, they didn't even clean this shit up.

**ALPHA-4:** Cap, come take a look at this. 

//[ALPHA-1 approaches ALPHA-4, who is crouched in front of mutilated human remains. The chest cavity has been ripped open and filled with apples.]//

**ALPHA-4:** What the fuck would do--

//[A loud shriek can be heard over all radios. The camera pans to the tree line.]// 

**ALPHA-1:** Roll call, squad leads.

**BETA-1:** Wasn't near us, Cap, but we heard it too.

**GAMMA-1:** Came from the south-west. En route now. We are definitely not alone out here.

**BETA-1:** Agreed. It's shy, whatever it is. Caught a glimpse, though; it's...fast.

**ALPHA-1:** Check back in 15. 

//[ALPHA-1 begins walking away from the logging equipment towards the tree line.]//

**ALPHA-1:** We're not doing shit just standing around these stiffs. Let's move.    

**ALPHA-7:** I don't know, guys. I got a bad feeling about this one.

**ALPHA-4:** That's what you said in Ontario too, Sev.  

//[ALPHA-4 and ALPHA-5 both laugh.]//

**ALPHA-5:** Cut him some slack-- that was a //big// fuckin' turtle.

**ALPHA-7:** Listen, that was-

**ALPHA-1:** Cut the chatter.

//[ALPHA Squad enters the tree line.]//

**ALPHA-5:** Look at this tree.

//[Camera pans to an apple tree. A sigil is etched into the periderm.]//

**ALPHA-1:** Shit if I know what that means.

**ALPHA-7:** Got some over here too, Cap.

**ALPHA-4:** Looks like it's all over the place.

//[Another loud shriek is heard. Several seconds later, multiple shrieks are heard in the opposite direction.]//

**BETA-1:** Cap, that second one came from this direction.

**ALPHA-1:** Regis, be prepared for anything. The bodies we found... let's just say you don't want to be on the wrong end of this one.

**BETA-1:** Got it, Cap. We found some sort of path, going to follow it. Stay safe.

**ALPHA-1:** Heads on swivel, boys.

//[ALPHA Squad walks south for 10.5 minutes. Extraneous dialogue removed.]//

**ALPHA-4:** Movement, 2 o-clock-- 3-- 5. Fuck, it's fast.

//[Camera pans to ALPHA-4. A blur of motion can be seen behind him.]//

**ALPHA-1:** Form up!

//[Several gunshots can be heard over the radio; the loud shriek can be heard before several lower shrieks from all directions.]//

**BETA-1:** We've got a man down, Cap. These fuckers don't die right.

**ALPHA-1:** Confirmed kill?

**BETA-1:** Negative. Bullets didn't do a god damn thing. Keep a close eye //[Gunshots can be heard over the radio.]// Keep your //[Gunshots]// fucking trees. They look like fucking plants.

**ALPHA-7:** Fuck. Where's Fives?

**ALPHA-1:** Fives! Fives! Square, you got eyes on Fives? Square? Jesu-

**ALPHA-7:** Shit. Cap, I got Fives over here.

**ALPHA-1:** Fives, why the fuck didn-

//[Camera faces ALPHA-7. Behind him, ALPHA-5  is seen bisected and hanging by his intestines from the trees.]//

**ALPHA-1:** We need to move now. 

//[ALPHA Squad begins moving west at a fast pace. A loud shriek is heard followed by another shriek directly behind ALPHA Squad.]//

**ALPHA-7:** Cap, watch out!

//[Camera blurs before settling on an SCP-4608-1 instance a meter from ALPHA-1.]//

**Squad Members:** BETA-6 "Sixes", --BETA-8 "Eight"--, BETA-9 "Nino"

[BEGIN LOG]

//[BETA Squad is moving quickly down a dirt path.]//

**BETA-1:** Sixes, make sure you keep pressure on that wound.

**BETA-9:** What the fuck! Those things came out of nowhere. What's the plan, Regis?

**BETA-1:** I don't know, Nino. Just stay the fuck away from the apples.

**BETA-6:** //[Strained laughter.]// That's a good one, Reg, but I need a br-  

//[BETA-6 collapses to the ground.]//

**BETA-1:** Nino, get him up, now. I'll cover.

**BETA-1:** Cap, we aren't doing so good over here. One KIA, one injured. Could use a little help. Cap? Cap?

**GAMMA-1:** //[Gunshots]// I think we're on our own, Regis. Switch to high impact //[Gunshots]// or explosive rounds. These fuckers ain't so tough.

**BETA-1:** What's your location? We need assistance.

//[BETA-9 is now carrying BETA-6 over his shoulder as BETA Squad continues down the path.]//

**GAMMA-1:** //[Gunshots]// We aren't exactly having a picnic here. //[Gunshots]// sure you watch out after the first scream. It's like a call-response type thing //[Gunshots]//

**BETA-9:** Regis! Over here, look!

//[Camera pans to show a small brick chapel. The louder shriek can be heard. The response shrieks can be heard from all directions.]//

**BETA-1:** Get him in there! Go go go!

//[The camera view swings behind BETA Squad, showing 3 SCP-4608-1 in close pursuit. BETA Squad enters the chapel and slams the door.]//

**BETA-1:** Put him down and give me a hand with this pew.

//[BETA-9 slouches BETA-6 against the wall before helping BETA-1 barricade the door. SCP-4608-1 can be heard slamming on the door.]//

**BETA-1:** That should buy us so-

**BETA-9:** Oh shit.

//[Camera pans around to show BETA-9 standing in front of a wall composed of human skulls.]//

**BETA-1:** Hey! Snap out of it. We don't have time for slack jawin'. Wake Sixes up. Fuckin' stick a finger in his wound if you have to.

**BETA-9:** Sorry; you got it.

//[BETA-1 begins rummaging through various scrolls and books on the shelves before pushing all of them to the floor.]//

**BETA-1:** God damn, there's nothing but chicken-scratch bullshit. I can't read any of this.

//[The call and response shrieks are heard again. The slamming on the door grows louder and more frequent.]//

**BETA-6:** What is goin-

**BETA-9:** He's up, Regis. You better come look at this wound, though.

//[BETA-1 walks over and focuses his light on BETA-6's leg wound. The area around the wound is showing advanced necrosis. Several apple seeds can be seen embedded in and around the wound.]//

**BETA-6:** What do you mean-- Oh god!

**BETA-1:** //[Hands BETA-9 a small medical kit]// Dig those fucking things out and clean it up. We have to move.

**BETA-9:** Gotcha. Sixes, this shit's gonna hurt.

//[BETA-1 walks back to the other side of the chapel. Sixes' muffled grunts can be heard in the background. The call and response shrieks are occurring more frequently.]//

**BETA-1:** //[Speaking quietly into his radio]// Jones, you copy? I'm fucking trapped. I don't know what to do.

**GAMMA-1:** I'm getting close, I'm- I'm almost to the source. Going quiet.  

//[Static can be heard over ALPHA-1's radio channel.]//

**BETA-1:** Cap! Thank God, where the fuc-

**ALPHA-7:** C-can anyone hear me? Come in, can anyone hear me?

**BETA-1:** Sev, is that you? What the fuck is going on? Where's Cap?

**ALPHA-7:** Dead, the-they're all dead. I'm heading west I think. I can't tell at this point, I- I think I'm getting close.

**BETA-1:** Close to what- //[BETA-1 is cut off by the sound of BETA-9 screaming]//

//[Camera swings around to show BETA-9 flailing on the ground. Twenty-five SCP-4608-1 instances are seen ripping off chunks of his flesh. More instances can be seen emerging from BETA-6's mouth, eyes, and leg wound.]// 

**BETA-1:** Fuck, fuck, fuck! 

//[BETA-1 is seen firing his weapon as the SCP-4608-1 instances begin to rush towards him.]//

**ALPHA-7:** Regis? Regis? ... Anybody?

[BEGIN LOG]

//[GAMMA-1 is slowly walking toward a clearing in the orchard. Several inhuman voices can be heard speaking in an unidentified language.]//

**GAMMA-1:** I gotta put you down, Tener. I think we got bogies ahead.

//[GAMMA-1 slouches as he drops GAMMA-10 off his back.]// 

**GAMMA-1:** Tener? Fuck.

//[Camera swings around to show GAMMA-10 disemboweled on the ground. GAMMA-1 searches GAMMA-10's pockets before pulling out a grenade.]//
 
**GAMMA-1:** Dammit, John, you were too good for this shit. //[Inaudible whispering]//

**ALPHA-7:** --think this is the channel. GAMMA Squad, do you copy? GAMMA Squad, do-

**GAMMA-1:** //[Speaking quietly]// Sev, fuck, what's goi-

**ALPHA-7:** Everyone is dead. I think BETA Squad is the same. Are you guys alright?

//[Camera swings back to GAMMA-10's body.]//

**GAMMA-1:** It's just me. 

//[The inhuman speech stops, and rhythmic shrieks begin. These shrieks last for 93 seconds.]//

**ALPHA-7:** Oh god-- look at the trees.

//[Camera pans to see human faces emerging from the trees surrounding GAMMA-1. The faces are sobbing as blood pours from their empty eye sockets.]//

  **GAMMA-1:** Fuck this.

//[GAMMA-1 stands as he enters the clearing. SCP-4608-2 can be seen in the center. All 13 faces stop shrieking, and begin frantically vocalizing in the unknown language.]//  

**GAMMA-1:** Holy fuck.

//[GAMMA-1 fires several rounds at SCP-4608-2, which continues to vocalize.]//

**ALPHA-7:** Hold on Jones, I'm almost ther-

**GAMMA-1:** Get the fuck out of here, get out and get back up, call in- //[grunting]//

//[Camera snaps down to see a large root constricting around GAMMA-1. The sound of several bones breaking can be heard.]//

**GAMMA-1:** Don't wo- worry, I wasn't going an-anywhere. //[GAMMA-1 gurgles a laugh as he throws the grenade at SCP-4608-2.]//

//[A loud snap is heard before GAMMA-1 goes limp. SCP-4608-2 can be seen erupting into flames as it begins to collapse. The camera and GAMMA-1's body fall to the ground; the camera shows the surrounding trees screaming-- their branches spontaneously combusting. Several SCP-4608-1 can be seen weaving through the trees, also on fire.]//   

**ALPHA-7** Oh my god, shit, shit, Jones I'm- I'm sorry I can't- I have to //[Coughing.]// go.

**Closing Statement:** On October 16, 1947 ALPHA-7 was recovered by the Allen County Fire Department, unconscious and suffering from exhaustion and smoke inhalation. The Site-81 Concealment Team took control of the situation and quarantined the area using the cover story of a toxic chemical hazard.
Following debriefing and a psychological evaluation, ALPHA-7 was administered amnestics and switched to low-risk recovery assignment. The members of MSF Bravo-7 were posthumously awarded the Foundation Star for their efforts during the neutralization of SCP-4608.
