**Special Containment Procedures:** Information regarding SCP-4792 is to be located and deleted by webcrawler IO-RECKONING-SLAVE as soon as it is detected. No further containment procedures are necessary for the time being.

**Description:** SCP-4792 refers to a Class-V megastructure encompassing a star near the Crux constellation. SCP-4792's primary function is to harvest all energy output of its captive star, a structure known as a Dyson sphere. In addition, SCP-4792 is capable of launching [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_spacecraft Von-Neumann Probes] toward other planetary systems for the purpose of replicating itself around each system's host star. 

SCP-4792 operates under two mechanisms: one inner thaumaturgical and one outer mechanical mechanism. The inner mechanism is a self-centering barrier, capable of allowing energy — but not matter — to pass through it. The outer mechanism is comprised of shielding, as well as energy-harvesting devices (presumed to be solar panels or some variety thereof) and computational machinery. Assembly factories have also been observed on its surface.

Inside SCP-4792's mechanical chassis is an artificial intelligence (henceforth PoI-4792) inhabiting an internal computational matrix. PoI-4792 has not responded to hailing attempts, nor otherwise acknowledged the Foundation's existence. However, after exploiting weaknesses in PoI-4792's database, numerous files have been retrieved; these files of significance are attached below. All recovered texts have been translated using an Anomalous Linguistical Application Device.

> Today marks the year-long anniversary of the start of The Great Containment Project. It is a momentous occasion, for it highlights the day we began to change our destinies. I, Geta Ipolet, am honored to hold this position of leadership in the Containment Project. I promise that when it's over, our children will be free to roam this wonderful universe without worries of extinction.
> 
> The history of the project dates back longer than any records will show. A prophecy that is still taught to our children is the center of the project, as I'm sure you all know. But do you remember its details? How often have you looked at the prose of its writing? Allow me but a brief moment to recite to you its verses, just as the elder prophets spoke it:
> 
>> Come gather my fellow brothers,
>> For I shall tell you a tale like no other,
>> Of which the eternal slumber will fall.
>> Arise one day a Dark God shall,
>> Around the Star of //Chiasmus//,
>> And in his madness, blacken the skies,
>> Consuming the world with iron teeth,
>> And silence shall dawn upon all life,
>> Lest a knight arise to defend it.
> 
> My dearest comrades, this is what the ancient god spoke to his prophets millennia ago. Truly a tragic prophecy, but not one that must take effect. If we examine the last line of this poem, you'll find that our fates can be deterred by "a knight" who shall defend all life. 
> 
> My friends, //we// are the knights!
> 
> Our strongest sages have already erected the most powerful barrier known to our kind around //Chiasmus//. It glows a soft pink, and encompasses the entire star! Truly, the most monumental of accomplishments. But we did not plan to stop there, of course, for we could ensure a bright future for our kind even beyond what we planned. That's why I'm proud to announce Operation Sheath, a move to construct a hypothesized stellar shell!
> 
> With over two million workers and mines with enough material to strip normal planets in mere years, we plan on encasing the entire star in not only a magical barrier, but a mechanical one as well. Not only shall we keep Meshet, the Dark God, locked in his cell, we shall use his home to power our own advances into the cosmos!

What idiots; did they expect this thing to be done by the turn of the century? I still have to send a data report on the sphere every year, but what do I tell them? They're politicians, they need something they can preach to the masses to get votes. I just take what's true and spin it to be beneficial to them so I can secure more funding.[[/span]]
> 
> [[span style="font-family: Caveat; font-size: 115%;"]]I've already gone through this rant a dozen times through this journal, I suppose. There's no use babbling again, though I assume it's healthy for me. The job's given me a lot of stress, but it's my legacy, and I'm certain I'll be invested in it to the very end. It's just that everything's too limited; not enough funding, not enough workers, not enough materials, whatever. We need to fix things up.[[/span]]
> 
> [[span style="font-family: Caveat; font-size: 115%;"]]Proposals have been made countless times, but there's a new one that I think has promise. Synthetics have begun to emerge as personalized house-caring tools back on //Lepus-Rem//, being capable of specialization and modification. We could promise "faster results" to the President if we get more money, invest in this new robot trend, and possibly create factories to produce near-limitless workers. Energy would be a bit of an issue at first, but that's not exactly a problem once you have part of a stellar shell up and running.[[/span]]
> 
> [[span style="font-family: Caveat; font-size: 115%;"]]Either way, whatever happens, I'll need to pick a designated successor soon. I'm already in my late seventies, and I probably will have to undergo some surgeries to keep my body up to speed. I've got another, hm, forty years tops, and I'll probably be forced out of the position within twenty. I'll give them a fight before I do, though! You can expect that from old Geta.[[/span]]

> 
> [[span style="font-family: Caveat; font-size: 115%;"]]Funding still runs relatively low, but when doesn't it? Either way, we've made great strides. Our workforce now consists of 90% synthetics, which is quite the notch up from 75% a year ago, or 0% from two decades ago. They follow commands effortlessly, and they don't tire. The speed at which they work is still vastly superior, and in hindsight, I'm ashamed we didn't do it sooner. All of them are under my control.[[/span]]
> 
> [[span style="font-family: Caveat; font-size: 115%;"]]We're still a long, long way from completing the structure, though. Our earliest estimates presume within the next dozen million years, but will be providing near-limitless energy in about two million. That is, of course, assuming we don't speed up the process even further. There's also the issue of conflicting interests with the government, since we generate a lot of energy as-is and consume massive amounts of materials, even if we generate them all ourselves. It's tiring.[[/span]]
> 
> [[span style="font-family: Caveat; font-size: 115%;"]]And then, of course... there's me. I'm already over a hundred, and I've got only a few years left until I drop dead. I've poured half my life into this project, and I have an irrational fear that everything I've worked towards will collapse as soon as I'm gone. This shell is like a child of mine now, and I don't want to abandon it while it's still an infant.[[/span]]
> 
> [[span style="font-family: Caveat; font-size: 115%;"]]That's why I'm going to be going through a specialized procedure. It's a side-project a group of scientists and I have been working on for a decade now, and we're finally ready to use it. We've designed a synthetic body perfectly mimicking my own, and its network is a neural duplicate of my brain. We plan on uploading my consciousness to the robot. The procedure will kill me, but I'm expecting that — if it succeeds, my duplicate will be eternal. If you hear nothing of me from now on? I am dead, and my duplicate is dead as well.[[/span]]

As such, I am incapable of moving my limbs for an indefinite time. No matter.

From what they've told me, the chances of something happening that may cause a serious issue in logic functionality are plausible, but should be fixable given enough technological advancement by our species. They assure me there is nothing to worry about, but I am uneasy. Oh well.

I can command the robotic workers with a few lines of code, and I can also use them to move me from place to place. I'm able to perform complex calculations with ease and make reflex-fast decisions. Truly this will be a turning point of the project. I am elated.

If such an astronomical collision occurred on the structure, it would have destroyed a quarter of what is currently constructed. Thankfully, it did not, and the barrier's integrity has upheld. Despite this, I am concerned in the future such events may destroy parts of the stellar shell. We must construct shielding to prevent such occurrences.
