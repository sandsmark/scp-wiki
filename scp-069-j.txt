**Item #:** SCP-069-J

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-069-J is stored in a secure locker at Site 19. Access to SCP-069-J requires prior permission from at least one (1) Level-3 personnel.

SCP-069-J may only be used on the secure, isolated computer in Isolation Area 3. Use of SCP-069-J on any terminal with a live network or internet connection will be cause for immediate revocation of access rights and possible termination.

Personnel found using SCP-069-J for excessive periods of time, or in dereliction of duty will be immediately terminated.

**Description:**
SCP-069-J was retrieved by [[[SCP-507]]] during a displacement period lasting from ██/█/200█ to ██/█/200█. Upon his return, SCP-069-J was found in his possession, and immediately contained.

SCP-069-J appears to be a commercially produced DVD in its original case. When placed into a standard PC with a Windows operating system, the disc appears to contain a Japanese-style "dating-sim" visual novel program in English. The title of the software is "The Sisters of Cheyenne Point".

SCP-069-J is reportedly "very well written and drawn", according to male test subjects who have used the software. Male test subjects will often use SCP-069-J for hours at a time, neglecting all other activity in an attempt to attain "100% completion". Female test subjects exhibit little interest in SCP-069-J. Possible memetic properties are under investigation.

**Addendum XXX-1:** Research into SCP-069-J has yielded no memetic properties. SCP-069-J has been reclassified from Euclid to Safe.

**Addendum XXX-2:** Excerpts from the manual for SCP-069-J as follows:
