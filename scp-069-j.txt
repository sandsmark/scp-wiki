**Item #:** SCP-069

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-069 is stored in a secure locker at Site 19. Access to SCP-069 requires prior permission from at least two (2) Level-3 personnel.

SCP-069 may only be used on the secure, isolated computer in Isolation Area 3. Use of SCP-069 on any terminal with a live network or internet connection will be cause for immediate revocation of access rights and possible termination.

Personnel found using SCP-069 for excessive periods of time or in dereliction of duty will be immediately terminated.

**Description:** SCP-069 was retrieved by [[[SCP-507]]] during a displacement period lasting from ██/█/200█ to ██/█/200█. Upon his return, SCP-069 was found in his possession, and immediately contained.

SCP-069 appears to be a commercially produced DVD in its original case. When placed into a standard PC with a Windows operating system, the disc appears to contain a Japanese-style "dating-sim" visual novel program in English. The title of the software is "The Sisters of Cheyenne Point".

SCP-069 is reportedly "very well written and drawn", according to male test subjects who have used the software. Male test subjects will often use SCP-069 for hours at a time, neglecting all other activity in an attempt to attain "100% completion". Female test subjects exhibit little interest in SCP-069. Possible memetic properties are under investigation.

**Addendum 069-1:** Research into SCP-069 has yielded no memetic properties. SCP-069 has been reclassified from Euclid to Safe.

**Addendum 069-2:** Excerpts from the manual for SCP-069 as follows:
