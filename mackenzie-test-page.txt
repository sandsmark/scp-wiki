title:Mackenzie Test Page
This is a test page created to experiment with tag filters for Nala's parsing functionality. Please disregard.

-----
**Primary Filter**:

[[module ListPages category=".,decomm" separate="no" tags="-scp -tale -guide -hub -project -author -orientation -creepypasta -supplement -contest -sandbox -orphaned -scp-fuel -splash -admin -template -essay -2000" perPage="200"]]
# %%title_linked%% - [[user %%created_by%%]] - %%created_at%%
[[/module]]
(These pages are in need of tags, as they lack any [[[Tag Guide|main tags]]] other than //orphaned//. Empty is good.)

-----
**SCP-2000 Contest Entries by Rating**:
[[module ListPages separate="no" tags="+2000 -hub" perPage="100" order="rating desc"]]
**%%title_linked%%** //by// **%%created_by%%** (%%rating%% rating from %%rating_votes** votes)
[[/module]]

-----
**Improperly deleted pages**:

[[module ListPages separate="no" category="deleted" perPage="100"]]
# %%title_linked%% - [[user %%created_by%%]] - %%created_at%%
[[/module]]
(Pages in the //deleted// category are ones that were "soft-deleted" by renaming them rather than being completely deleted. As this is contrary to site policy, these pages need to be properly deleted.)

-----
**Pages tagged as //orphaned//**:

[[module ListPages separate="no" tags="orphaned" perPage="100"]]
# %%title_linked%% - [[user %%created_by%%]] - %%created_at%%
[[/module]]
(//orphaned// pages are usually pages that were attached to one or more articles that were subsequently deleted, or pages whose parents are locked and I can't change them myself. Very rarely an //orphaned// page can be cleaned up and made into a standalone tale, but usually they just need to be deleted.)

-----
**Pages tagged as //supplement// with no parent page**:

[[module ListPages separate="no" tags="supplement" parent="-" perPage="100"]]
# %%title_linked%% - [[user %%created_by%%]] - %%created_at%%
[[/module]]
(//supplement// pages should have their parent page set to the SCP from which they are linked. A missing parent page either indicates that the supplement is orphaned or simply needs to be updated.)

-----
**Pages tagged as both //safe// and //euclid//**:

[[module ListPages separate="no" tags="+safe +euclid -keter" perPage="100"]]
# %%title_linked%% - [[user %%created_by%%]] - %%created_at%%
[[/module]]

-----
**Pages tagged as both //euclid// and //keter//**:

[[module ListPages separate="no" tags="+euclid +keter -safe" perPage="100"]]
# %%title_linked%% - [[user %%created_by%%]] - %%created_at%%
[[/module]]

-----
**Pages tagged as both //safe// and //keter//**:

[[module ListPages separate="no" tags="+safe +keter -euclid" perPage="100"]]
# %%title_linked%% - [[user %%created_by%%]] - %%created_at%%
[[/module]]


-----
**Pages tagged as all three???**:

[[module ListPages separate="no" tags="+safe +euclid +keter" perPage="100"]]
# %%title_linked%% - [[user %%created_by%%]] - %%created_at%%
[[/module]]
