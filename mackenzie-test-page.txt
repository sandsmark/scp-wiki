This is a test page created to experiment with tag filters for Nala's parsing functionality. Please disregard.

-----
**Primary Filter**:

[[module ListPages category=".,decomm" separate="no" tags="-scp -tale -guide -hub -project -author -orientation -creepypasta -supplement -contest -sandbox -orphaned -scp-fuel -splash -admin -template" perPage="200"]]
# %%title_linked%% - [[user %%created_by%%]] - %%created_at%%
[[/module]]
(These pages are in need of tags, as they lack any [[[Tag Guide|main tags]]] other than //orphaned//. Empty is good.)

-----
**Pages tagged as //orphaned//**:

[[module ListPages separate="no" tags="orphaned" perPage="100"]]
# %%title_linked%% - [[user %%created_by%%]] - %%created_at%%
[[/module]]
(//orphaned// pages are usually pages that were attached to one or more articles that were subsequently deleted, or pages whose parents are locked and I can't change them myself. Very rarely an //orphaned// page can be cleaned up and made into a standalone tale, but usually they just need to be deleted.)

-----
**Pages tagged as both //safe// and //euclid//**:

[[module ListPages separate="no" tags="+safe +euclid" perPage="100"]]
# %%title_linked%% - [[user %%created_by%%]] - %%created_at%%
[[/module]]


-----
**Pages tagged as both //euclid// and //keter//**:

[[module ListPages separate="no" tags="+euclid +keter" perPage="100"]]
# %%title_linked%% - [[user %%created_by%%]] - %%created_at%%
[[/module]]
