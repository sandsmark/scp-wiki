**Item #:** SCP-668

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** [REVISED] As of [DATA EXPUNGED], no special containment procedures aside from standard security are required. SCP-668 is to be transferred to a locked safe-deposit box at Site 19's High Value Item Storage Facility. Standard positive-action defenses (explosive, chemical, biological, and memetic) are to be in place at all times, according to standard operating procedure.

SCP-668 may only be removed from its safe-deposit box by personnel with Security Clearance 2 or higher. Individuals wishing to make use of SCP-668 outside Site 19 must first submit a Form-668 Requested Course of Action form to O5-11 and be fitted with an explosive killswitch collar on a 24-hour timer before taking SCP-668 into the field. An Auditing Officer with Security Clearance 4 or higher must confirm that SCP-668 has been returned to its safe-deposit box before the collar is deactivated.

**Description:** SCP 668 is a 13-inch chef's knife with a rosewood handle and full-tang construction, crafted at some point in the early 1940s to late 1930s. When first acquired by field operatives, SCP-668 was in badly rusted condition, with heavy pitting from blood stains and other bodily fluids trapped in micro-crevices within the blade. Following thorough analysis, these irregularities were removed for aesthetic purposes. This has had negligible, if any, effect on SCP-668's special properties.

The first recorded appearance of SCP-668 was in the 1940s, during the infamous [DATA EXPUNGED] case. [DATA EXPUNGED], a New York woman living alone, was allegedly raped and murdered by subject [DATA EXPUNGED]. Despite the fact that 38 witnesses reported hearing the attack, none of them attempted to aid the young woman for over six hours, until her eventual death. Whether the item recieved its properties due to this event, or whether it had them beforehand, is a matter of debate (see Dr. [REDACTED]'s paper re: the Bystander Effect, vs. Dr. [REDACTED]'s theory regarding psychic imprintation.)

What is clear, however, is its current properties. When carried by a human or humanoid entity with violent intent towards another human or humanoid entity, SCP-668 broadcasts a psychic signal that renders all sentient beings with a Psionic Resistance Index of 97 or lower incapable of assisting the victim. Affected entities report a sudden sense of apathy while under SCP-668's influence: sensory input is not affected, and affected entities report feeling revulsion and horror, but are simply inacapable of acting, even indirectly, to assist the victim. Meanwhile, it renders the victim incapable of defending themselves against their attacker.

Tests using Class-D personnel have shown no upper limit in the number of entities affected by the psychic resonance. In one test, a thousand Class D Personnel were placed in a room alongside a researcher who was told to randomly select one test subject for termination: the researcher terminated all test subjects one by one, despite their professed horror.

Because of the obvious apocalyptic possibilities, it is the recommendation of this panel that SCP-668 be designated a Keter-level threat and placed in high-level confinement.

**Addendum:** Following further testing, it has been determined that test subjects wielding SCP-668 can be terminated through passive response, so long as the terminating agent is introduced before the subject takes possession of SCP-668. The Running Man protocol is hereby approved for use with SCP-668, and the item in question is hereby reclassified as a Euclid-type object.
