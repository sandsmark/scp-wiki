**Name:** T██████ Lees

**Security Clearance:** 1

**Current Assignment:** Linguistics specialist, Euclid wing

**Location:** Site-45

Researcher Lees joined the Foundation after successfully, independently identifying two new breach patterns in SCP-███. Research Lees has since decoded the texts of █ anomalous objects, and provides translation services for interview documents and international Foundation sites.

Though having performed admirably since induction into the Foundation, Researcher Lees has consistently avoided promotion, going so far as to initiate Incident ████-08, losing Level 2 security clearance as punishment. Counseling began on ██/██/████.

**Item #:** SCP-1778

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1778 is housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber furnished with a comfortable bed. SCP-1778 does not require sustenance, but should be turned daily and is to be given a sponge bath every three days. Though SCP-1778 has so far been docile, no fewer than two personnel are to enter containment at one time.

SCP-1778-A and SCP-1778-B are not to be separated. Should they become separated, see Protocol 1778-Sigma for procedures on reintegration.

**Description:** SCP-1778 is a composite entity comprised of SCP-1778-A and SCP-1778-B, which are ethnically Bambara women. Each has a distended mouth with enlarged, rounded teeth, into which has been inserted the legs and pelvis of the other half-entity, feet-first. Other features, including eyes, ears, nose, hair, and secondary sexual characteristics, have been removed via abrasion. The arms have been reduced to stumps 10 cm long and 5 cm in diameter, and the heads and necks have fused into flattened domes.

SCP-1778-A and SCP-1778-B are both capable of communication in African French, though speech is obstructed. SCP-1778 is capable of self-propulsion at a negligible rate, but tends to remain at rest.

**Addendum:** SCP-1778 was recovered in the Gao region of Mali, 12 km north of the village of Talataye. The following description was composed from interviews with numerous witnesses familiar with SCP-1778-A and SCP-1778-B, referred to as R███ and S█████, respectively.

> R███ and S█████ were known for their constant squabbling. At any opportunity, they argued about anything and everything: clothing, politics, men, who had more money. They had come to blows on numerous occasions, but despite being punished for disturbing the peace, their arguments continued. On their own, they were unpleasant enough, and they had few friends.
> 
> After neither R███ nor S█████ had been seen for four days, S█████'s aunt went to S█████'s house to check on her. The aunt, hysterical, called for a doctor, who confirmed her story: R███ and S█████ had their legs jammed into each other's mouths past the knee.
> 
> They were taken to a medical facility, where R███ and S█████ continued to slowly consume one another. Attempts to pull them apart were fruitless, as neither seemed willing to relinquish her hold on the other.
> 
> They remained in hospital for weeks with no change. Local sentiment built around the idea that they had been possessed by evil spirits and should be gotten rid of if their condition proved irreversible.
> 
> The local council did nothing to stop what happened next. R███ and S█████, still chewing on one another and oblivious to their circumstances, were taken by pickup truck and dumped in the desert. It was seen as the only way to rid the town of their evil, as no one could bring themselves to kill them.

**Incident Report 1778-1**
On April 6, 2012, noises were heard coming from SCP-1778's containment chamber at 0415. Upon investigation, staff found SCP-1778-A and SCP-1778-B had separated and were making distressed noises. Examination of SCP-1778 showed that the legs of each part terminated 19 cm below the knee, and tapered to smooth points there. An effort was made to reunite SCP-1778-A and SCP-1778-B, after which a statement was taken.

> 
> **SCP-1778-A:** We did not wish it to happen.
> 
> **SCP-1778-B:** Something tore us apart.
> 
> **Junior Research Assistant L███:** Can you elaborate?

> **SCP-1778-A:** We did not wish it to happen.

> 
> **SCP-1778-A:** We spent so much time in our old lives fighting.
> 
> **SCP-1778-B:** What has become of us has shown us how petty all our squabbles were.
> 
> **SCP-1778-A:** We have so much in common.
> 
> **SCP-1778-B:** And though we do not see so well nowadays, we understand what we are like. What life would we have apart, in the outside world?
> 
> **SCP-1778-A:** We cannot go back to the way we were, and now we find comfort in each other.
> 
> **SCP-1778-B:** You may even call it love.
> 
> **Junior Research Assistant L███:** I see. I will make a note recommending that you not be separated in the future. Is there anything else you would like to add?
> 
> **SCP-1778:** Thank you.

SCP-1778 was returned to containment and containment procedures modified.
