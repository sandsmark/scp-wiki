title:Personnel File: T██████ Lees
**Name:** T██████ Lees

**Security Clearance:** 1

**Current Assignment:** Linguistics specialist, Euclid wing

**Location:** Site-45

Researcher Lees joined the Foundation after successfully, independently identifying two new breach patterns in SCP-███. Research Lees has since decoded the texts of █ anomalous objects, and provides translation services for interview documents and international Foundation sites.

Though having performed admirably since induction into the Foundation, Researcher Lees has consistently avoided promotion, going so far as to initiate Incident ████-08, losing Level 2 security clearance as punishment. Counseling began on ██/██/████.

**Item #:** SCP-1778

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1778 is housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber furnished with a comfortable bed. SCP-1778 does not require sustenance, but should be turned daily and is to be given a sponge bath every three days. Though SCP-1778 has so far been docile, no fewer than two personnel are to enter containment at one time.

SCP-1778-A and SCP-1778-B are not to be separated. Should they become separated, see Protocol 1778-Sigma for procedures on reintegration.

**Description:** SCP-1778 is a composite entity comprised of SCP-1778-A and SCP-1778-B, which are ethnically Bambara women. Each has a distended mouth with enlarged, rounded teeth, into which has been inserted the legs and pelvis of the other half-entity, feet-first. Other features, including eyes, ears, nose, hair, and secondary sexual characteristics, have been removed via abrasion. The arms have been reduced to stumps 10 cm long and 5 cm in diameter, and the heads and necks have fused into flattened domes.

SCP-1778-A and SCP-1778-B are both capable of communication in African French, though speech is obstructed. SCP-1778 is capable of self-propulsion at a negligible rate, but tends to remain at rest.

**Addendum:** SCP-1778 was recovered in the Gao region of Mali, 12 km north of the village of Talataye. The following description was composed from interviews with numerous witnesses familiar with SCP-1778-A and SCP-1778-B, referred to as R███ and S█████, respectively.

> R███ and S█████ were known for their constant squabbling. At any opportunity, they argued about anything and everything: clothing, politics, men, who had more money. They had come to blows on numerous occasions, but despite being punished for disturbing the peace, their arguments continued. On their own, they were unpleasant enough, and they had few friends.
> 
> After neither R███ nor S█████ had been seen for four days, S█████'s aunt went to S█████'s house to check on her. The aunt, hysterical, called for a doctor, who confirmed her story: R███ and S█████ had their legs jammed into each other's mouths past the knee.
> 
> They were taken to a medical facility, where R███ and S█████ continued to slowly consume one another. Attempts to pull them apart were fruitless, as neither seemed willing to relinquish her hold on the other.
> 
> They remained in hospital for weeks with no change. Local sentiment built around the idea that they had been possessed by evil spirits and should be gotten rid of if their condition proved irreversible.
> 
> The local council did nothing to stop what happened next. R███ and S█████, still chewing on one another and oblivious to their circumstances, were taken by pickup truck and dumped in the desert. It was seen as the only way to rid the town of their evil, as no one could bring themselves to kill them.

**Incident Report 1778-1**
On April 6, 2012, noises were heard coming from SCP-1778's containment chamber at 0415. Upon investigation, staff found SCP-1778-A and SCP-1778-B had separated and were making distressed noises. Examination of SCP-1778 showed that the legs of each part terminated 19 cm below the knee, and tapered to smooth points there. An effort was made to reunite SCP-1778-A and SCP-1778-B, after which a statement was taken.

> **Interviewed:** SCP-1778-A and SCP-1778-B
> 
> **Interviewer:** Junior Research Assistant L███
> 
> Transcript translated from French.
> 
> **<Begin Log, 4/6/12, 0450>**
> 
> **Junior Research Assistant L███:** Can you explain the separation that just occurred?
> 
> **SCP-1778-A:** We did not wish it to happen.
> 
> **SCP-1778-B:** Something tore us apart.
> 
> **Junior Research Assistant L███:** Can you elaborate?
> 
> **SCP-1778-B:** We do not know what it was.
> 
> **SCP-1778-A:** We did not wish it to happen.
> 
> **Junior Research Assistant L███:** Why not?
> 
> **SCP-1778-A:** We spent so much time in our old lives fighting.
> 
> **SCP-1778-B:** What has become of us has shown us how petty all our squabbles were.
> 
> **SCP-1778-A:** We have so much in common.
> 
> **SCP-1778-B:** And though we do not see so well nowadays, we understand what we are like. What life would we have apart, in the outside world?
> 
> **SCP-1778-A:** We cannot go back to the way we were, and now we find comfort in each other.
> 
> **SCP-1778-B:** You may even call it love.
> 
> **Junior Research Assistant L███:** I see. I will make a note recommending that you not be separated in the future. Is there anything else you would like to add?
> 
> **SCP-1778:** Thank you.

SCP-1778 was returned to containment and containment procedures modified.

**Item #:** SCP-2212

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2212 is to be held in a free-standing humanoid containment chamber in a low-trafficked area of Site-██, with a 10-meter perimeter around the chamber clearly marked. SCP-2212 is to be monitored via closed-circuit television at all times, and any movement is to be immediately reported to the Site Director. Testing should be conducted only by small teams (fewer than 10) of D-class personnel being guided by researchers outside the 10 meter radius.

**Description:** SCP-2212 is a blue-skinned humanoid, height estimated at 2.5 meters, with vaguely amphibian features: smooth, hairless skin, minimal nares, lipless mouth, etc. SCP-2212 has four digits on its hand, and three on its feet. SCP-2212 possesses a tail, one meter long. Its only clothing is a pair of burlap pants.

SCP-2212 has, since recovery, remained sitting in a lotus position with its eyes open and focused forward. During this time, SCP-2212 has not moved, voluntarily or involuntarily (see attached Incident Log).

It has not been possible to alter SCP-2212's position, and SCP-2212 does not react to stimuli of any sort. Study of the subject has been limited due to its skin being impenetrable. X-rays have shown it to have internal systems similar to those of a human, but EEGs have been unable to detect brain activity. Despite this, SCP-2212 is considered sentient, if not sapient. SCP-2212 respires once every 75 seconds (an increase of 2 seconds since time of recovery) and has a heart rate of 24 beats per minute (a decrease of 3 bpm since time of recovery).

**Addendum 2212-01:** Recovery of SCP-2212 took place on ██/█/████ in the village of ████████████ in northeastern Bhutan. SCP-2212 was found seated on a dais surrounded by a semicircle of human corpses, arranged concentrically, with those in the outermost rings showing the least decomposition. (See Interview 2212-03.) Initial reports had led recovery teams to the conclusion that SCP-2212 was a statue. This assumption was proven wrong when it jostled during relocation, and recovery procedures were quickly modified.

**Log of Incident 2212-A**
> On █/██/████, a team of six researchers, led by Dr. ██████ and accompanied by one armed guard, were attempting to conduct tests on SCP-2212 when Incident 2212-A occurred. Note that SCP-2212's initial containment chamber was not free-standing, and two other humanoid SCPs were contained in the same wing of Site-██.
> 
> Security footage shows that, at 10:45, SCP-2212's eyelids began to close. Security tapes then returned static for 1.5 seconds. Upon recovery of the visual feed, SCP-2212's eyes were open once again.
> 
> At this point, members of the research team were seen seated in the room in a position similar to that of SCP-2212, with heads down and eyes closed. Also present in the room were one of the two guards stationed outside SCP-2212's chamber, SCP-███, and a junior researcher who it was later confirmed had been walking past the containment chamber at the time of the incident.
> 
> The only person in the room not to be affected, Junior Researcher T█████ L████, claimed to have been searching the floor for a dropped pen, and was facing away from SCP-2212 at the time of the incident. He claims to have blinked, after which the researchers' positions were changed.
> 
> Testing has shown those affected to be in a deep meditative state. Subjects exhibit no voluntary motion and no attempt at self-preservation. No attempts to wake subjects have succeeded. An intravenous feeding drip administered to the highest-level researchers was terminated after ██ months of unresponsiveness, and subjects expired of dehydration within five days. SCP-███ was reclassified Safe and relocated to Site-██.

**Interview 2212-03**

> **Interviewed:** B█████████ D████, village elder of ████████████.
> 
> **Interviewers:** Agent R████, recovery team leader; A████ T██████, translator.
> 
> **Foreword:** A████ T██████, a native speaker of Dzala fluent in English, provided translation during the interview. Translations have been omitted from the interview log.
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Mr. D████:** You have come to take our guru?
> 
> **Agent R████:** Yes. I recommend you let us.
> 
> **Mr. D████:** We do not wish to stand against you.
> 
> **Agent R████:** Why not?
> 
> **Mr. D████:** It is the nature of all things to come to an end. Even he who would lead us to enlightenment must one day leave us.
> 
> **Agent R████:** We appreciate your cooperation. Is there anything more you can tell about your "guru"?
> 
> **Mr. D████:** The guru came to us... //[Makes noncommittal sounds and gestures towards the sky.]// Many generations ago. It chooses those worthy of enlightenment and sends them on to the next plane of existence.
> 
> **Agent R████:** How do you know who's worthy?
> 
> **Mr. D████:** That is not for us to know. Once chosen, enlightenment is achieved. You saw them, the worthy.
> 
> **Agent R████:** So the worthy just sit there and let themselves starve to death?
> 
> **Mr. D████:** When enlightenment is achieved, the body no longer matters. Who would wish to give up perfection?
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** Class-A amnesiacs were administered to all villagers after recovery. Mr. T██████ was hired into the Foundation as a translator.
