Researcher Lees joined the Foundation after having successfully and independently identified two new breach patterns in SCP-███. Research Lees has since proven invaluable in decoding the texts of █ anomalous objects, and provides translation services for interview documents and international Foundation sites.

Though having performed admirably since induction into the Foundation, Researcher Lees has consistently avoided promotion, going so far as to initiate Incident ████-08, losing Level 2 security clearance as punishment. Counseling began on ██/██/████.
