title:Personnel File: T██████ Lees
**Name:** T██████ Lees

**Security Clearance:** 1

**Current Assignment:** Linguistics specialist, Euclid wing

**Location:** Site-45

Researcher Lees joined the Foundation after successfully, independently identifying two new breach patterns in SCP-███. Research Lees has since decoded the texts of █ anomalous objects, and provides translation services for interview documents and international Foundation sites.

Though having performed admirably since induction into the Foundation, Researcher Lees has consistently avoided promotion, going so far as to initiate Incident ████-08, losing Level 2 security clearance as punishment. Counseling began on ██/██/████.

**SCP-1778: Erisychthon**
Two Malian women who got in a fight, started eating each other from the legs up, and got stuck halfway. The body horror didn't seem to be enough to assuage those uninterested in the romance angle. Proof that making your characters gay doesn't automatically make them more interesting!

**SCP-2212: The Meditator**
A blue-skinned alien that beamed down to bring us lowly humans to enlightenment. One of my very first ideas for an SCP; no surprise it didn't work out.

**SCP-2292: Bad Bones and the House of Regret**
A cobbled-together episode of Arthur, viewers of which will literally be haunted by their regrets. An attempt to start up my GoI. People thought it was some kind of creepypasta I'd never heard of, and what can you do in the face of that?

**SCP-2298: May Your Forehead Grow Like the Mighty Oak and Shine With a Light of Many Suns, To Be a Beacon Unto Thy Followers in Worlds Beyond Our Own**
I just wanted to turn that title into a skip. No one was really wowed by the first three drafts, and the fourth time was not the charm. Shine on, you crazy space hippies.

**Tale: Zyn Kriyu only she's a buterfly**
Written for the 2016 April Fool's Contest. For the portion whose rule was "at least one typo per sentence". I took it as a holy edict //you better believe it//. And of course no one appreciated it because they suck. :V But hey, it got [http://scpfoundation.ru/zyn-kriyu-only-she-s-a-buterfly translated into Russian]! (Which is just frickin' fantastic.) And it's doing better over there. At least it's not gumming up my author stats anymore. V:
