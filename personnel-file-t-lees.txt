title:Personnel File: T██████ Lees
**Name:** T██████ Lees

**Security Clearance:** 1

**Current Assignment:** Linguistics specialist, Euclid wing

**Location:** Site-45

Researcher Lees joined the Foundation after successfully, independently identifying two new breach patterns in SCP-███. Research Lees has since decoded the texts of █ anomalous objects, and provides translation services for interview documents and international Foundation sites.

Though having performed admirably since induction into the Foundation, Researcher Lees has consistently avoided promotion, going so far as to initiate Incident ████-08, losing Level 2 security clearance as punishment. Counseling began on ██/██/████.

**SCP-1778: Erisychthon**
Two Malian women who got in a fight, started eating each other from the legs up, and got stuck halfway. The body horror didn't seem to be enough to assuage those uninterested in the romance angle. Proof that making your characters gay doesn't automatically make them more interesting!

**SCP-2212: The Meditator**
A blue-skinned alien that beamed down to bring us lowly humans to enlightenment. One of my very first ideas for an SCP; no surprise it didn't work out.
