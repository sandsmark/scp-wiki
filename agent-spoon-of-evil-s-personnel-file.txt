title:Agent "Spoon Of Evil's" Personnel File
**Name:** ██████████ █████

**Codename:** Spoon of Evil

**Security Clearance Level:** CLASSIFIED

**Assignment:** SCP Acquistion and Recovery

**Location:** CLASSIFIED

**History:** Not much is known about Agent Spoon besides official documentation and whatever information Agent Spoon decides to divulge. Originally from ███ ██████, California, Agent Spoon majored in both law and civil engineering at the University of California ██████████████ before dropping out of sight for ██ years. He later resurfaced as an independent consultant specializing in "high level acquistions" and "making things happen". Confirmed to to have worked with numerous special forces and paramilitary units before being recommended to the Foundation. 

In addition to his many civilian and governmental contacts, Agent Spoon has also admitted during his job interview that he had previously taken jobs with several Foundation groups of interest, including the Global Occult Coalition, the Iranian Republican Guard, and the Church of the Broken God. However, he refuses to divulge any more information than that, stating that would violate the employer/client privacy clause in his contracts and that doing so would be "unprofessional".

Currently, Agent Spoon has shown the ability to find SCP's with an alarming rate of success, often able to arrive at discovery sites long before Foundation recovery teams even recieve notification to mobilize. While this has proven to be an invaluable asset to the Foundation, Agent Spoon's access to Sites that hold SCP's is restricted. 

**Profile:** Agent Spoon has proven himself to be a very able agent, performs his duties with a level of professional quality that is difficult for other agents to match. While on duty, Agent Spoon follows protocol and adheres to a very strict code of business ethics when interacting with staff and civilians. However, this is a double edged sword, as this same code prevents him from talking about his work outside of the Foundation. Agent Spoon also possesses remarkable analytical and combat abilities in the field. However, Agent Spoon almost never gets himself involved in combat operations himself, often deferring the duty to Foundation field teams and other agents.

While not afraid to mingle with Foundation staff and participate in public events, Agent Spoon has shown enigmatic, anti-social, and paranoid tendencies when in private. When talking about sensitive subjects, Agent Spoon purposely remains vague, and becomes annoyed when too many questions are asked about him. However, it is difficult to tell if his frustration and anger are real or a facade, as he always defuses his anger and threats by laughing and saying "just kidding". 

Even though he follows Foundation protocols, the only exception Agent Spoon shows is during SCP acquisition and recovery. It is not uncommon for him to use his (nonexistent) authority to draft Foundation and civilian personnel into assisting him with an operation without authorization. However, due to the level of success these operations have shown, O5 adminstration has decided not to issue a termination order for the time being.

**Addendum:** Agent Spoon has shown that he is capable of some form of limited hypnotic suggestion. A surveillance clip of an encounter with an IRG agent has shown the extents of this ability.

IRG Agent: (Points handgun at Agent Spoon.) Who the hell are you?

Agent Spoon: My, that's a nice gun. Would you kindly let me take a look at it?

IRG Agent: (IRG Agent's face becomes blank of all emotion or expression.) Sure. (Voluntarily hands his sidearm to Agent Spoon.)

Agent Spoon: Perfect.

IRG Agent: (Appears to regain his composure, but looks confused.) Wait, how did you-

Agent Spoon: (Shoots IRG Agent. Then wipes down and disposes of the weapon.)

Also, there have been many complaints among personnel at the sites Agent Spoon frequents that he had somehow managed to fool them into accepting blank paper as monetary recompensation. O5 adminstration have decided to increase surveillance on Agent Spoon.
