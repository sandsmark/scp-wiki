[[include component:image-block name=470758225_0ff0f91d14_o.jpg|caption=A picture Agent Spoon provided when asked to present one. Administration is not amused.]]

**Name:** ██████████ █████

**Codename:** Agent Spoon

**Security Clearance Level:** CLASSIFIED

**Assignment:** SCP Containment, Acquistion, and Recovery

**Location:** CLASSIFIED

**History:** Not much is known about Agent Spoon besides official documentation and whatever information Agent Spoon decides to divulge. Originally from ███ ██████, California, Agent Spoon majored in both law and civil engineering at the University of California ██████████████ and had undergone US Army training where he served a tour in ████ before being discharged and dropping out of sight for ██ years. He later resurfaced as an independent consultant for various civilian and military agencies. His training and experience made him suited for his current position as a CAR (Containment, Acquisition, Recovery) Agent. 

**Profile:** While on duty, Agent Spoon follows protocol and adheres to a very strict code of business ethics when interacting with staff and civilians. He also possesses skilled analytical and combat abilities in the field. However, he almost never gets himself involved in combat operations himself, often deferring the duty to Foundation field teams and other agents.

While not afraid to mingle with Foundation staff and participate in public events, Agent Spoon has shown enigmatic, anti-social, and paranoid tendencies when in private. When talking about sensitive subjects, Agent Spoon purposely remains vague, and becomes annoyed when too many questions are asked about him. However, it is difficult to tell if his frustration and anger are real or a facade, as he always defuses his anger and threats by laughing and saying "just kidding". 

Even though he follows Foundation protocols, the only exception Agent Spoon shows is during SCP acquisition and recovery. It is not uncommon for him to use his (nonexistent) authority to draft Foundation and civilian personnel into assisting him with an operation without authorization.
