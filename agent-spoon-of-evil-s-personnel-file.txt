**Name:** ██████████ █████

**Codename:** Agent Spoon

**Security Clearance Level:** CLASSIFIED

**Assignment:** SCP Acquistion and Recovery

**Location:** CLASSIFIED

**History:** Not much is known about Agent Spoon besides official documentation and whatever information Agent Spoon decides to divulge. Originally from ███ ██████, California, Agent Spoon majored in both law and civil engineering at the University of California ██████████████ before dropping out of sight for ██ years. He later resurfaced as an independent consultant specializing in "high level acquistions" and "making things happen". Confirmed to to have worked with numerous special forces and paramilitary units before being recommended to the Foundation. 

In addition to his many civilian and governmental contacts, Agent Spoon has implied in his performance interview that he possesses rather detailed knowledge of other Foundation groups of interest, including the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, the Chuch of the Broken God, and the FBI Unusual Incidents Unit.

Currently, Agent Spoon has shown the ability to find SCP's with an alarming rate of success, often able to arrive at discovery sites long before Foundation recovery teams even recieve notification to mobilize. While this has proven to be an invaluable asset to the Foundation, Agent Spoon's access to Sites that hold SCP's is restricted. 

**Profile:** While on duty, Agent Spoon follows protocol and adheres to a very strict code of business ethics when interacting with staff and civilians. He also possesses remarkable analytical and combat abilities in the field. However, he almost never gets himself involved in combat operations himself, often deferring the duty to Foundation field teams and other agents.

While not afraid to mingle with Foundation staff and participate in public events, Agent Spoon has shown enigmatic, anti-social, and paranoid tendencies when in private. When talking about sensitive subjects, Agent Spoon purposely remains vague, and becomes annoyed when too many questions are asked about him. However, it is difficult to tell if his frustration and anger are real or a facade, as he always defuses his anger and threats by laughing and saying "just kidding". 

Even though he follows Foundation protocols, the only exception Agent Spoon shows is during SCP acquisition and recovery. It is not uncommon for him to use his (nonexistent) authority to draft Foundation and civilian personnel into assisting him with an operation without authorization.
