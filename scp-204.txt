**Item #:** SCP-204

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-204-1 and SCP-204-2 are to be kept in a 10 m x 10 m fortified holding area in Site-██. The holding area must be constructed out of titanium and heavily-reinforced concrete. The holding area must also be vacuum sealed and contained within an outer shell with a higher air pressure that must always be maintained with at least 2 PSI over the current air pressure in the holding area. At least one full security team must be kept on standby at all times.

It is only during SCP-204-1's scheduled feeding times that D-class personnel are allowed to enter for the purposes of maintenance. SCP-204-1's typical diet consists of any kind of meat, preferably from living subjects. Such subjects will often consist of aggressive animals such as wild dogs, bulls, or any other animal that must be euthanized due to aggression. However, D-class personnel will also suffice if such food sources are unavailable. SCP-204-2's diet consists of a regular human diet with no special measures required. SCP-204-2 is allowed to make special requests, but any and all requests must be given O5 approval. Any personnel caught attempting to deliberately provoke SCP-204-2 will be immediately terminated.

When SCP-204-2 is about to turn the age of fourteen, the Foundation must initiate Containment Protocol 204. Further details may be found in Containment Protocol 204 Requirements.

In the event of a containment breach, EMP generators must be immediately activated in order to keep SCP-204-1 disabled. Once EMP generators have been activated, security teams have approximately thirty seconds to neutralize SCP-204-2 before SCP-204-1 can adapt and reassemble itself. If containment cannot be achieved in this time, SCP-204-1 must be contained by conventional means. Security teams and agents are authorized to use any conventional weaponry at their disposal to contain SCP-204-1 and SCP-204-2. If SCP-204-2 is terminated during containment, then Containment Protocol 204 must immediately be initiated.

**Description:** SCP-204-1 is a semi-organic nano-machine colony that follows SCP-204-2 as a form of protector. SCP-204-1 spends the majority of its time in a dispersed cloud, where it is almost impossible to perceive with normal human senses. However, if SCP-204-2 is put into danger, or if SCP-204-2 commands it to, SCP-204-1 will instantaneously materialize into a solid, physical form. The exact shape and nature of this form is subjective, depending wholly upon SCP-204-2's view, state of mind, and imagination. Despite its variable nature, SCP-204-1 has a number of common traits. These include: massive strength, large size, basic intelligence, perfect obedience to SCP-204-2, and the ability to regenerate itself after consuming living flesh. SCP-204-1 is vulnerable to conventional weaponry, and can be temporarily forced back into its dispersed state if enough damage is inflicted.

SCP-204-2 is always a child, ranging from four to fourteen years old. Physically, there is nothing outstanding about SCP-204-2 besides its ability to call upon SCP-204-1. All incidences of SCP-204-2 have common traits. All of them have had a history of abuse and danger, with many developing acute mental disorders as a result. It appears that SCP-204-1 is attracted to such children, though why or how it finds them is currently unknown. If SCP-204-2 is terminated or reaches the age of fourteen, then SCP-204-1 will abandon it and find a new child to "imprint" on. As a form of self-preservation, if SCP-204-1 cannot find a suitable child, it will immediately materialize and go berserk, attacking anything in sight.

Once SCP-204-1 finds a suitable candidate to protect, it immediately "imprints" upon SCP-204-2 and will follow it until SCP-204-2 is terminated or until SCP-204-1 decides to leave of its own accord. At first, SCP-204-1 appears benign, protecting SCP-204-2 from overt threats. However, through careful study and observation, it has been noted that all incidences of SCP-204-2 begin to adopt much more aggressive, danger-seeking behavior with little regard for human life. It is theorized that SCP-204-1 is able to manipulate SCP-204-2's thought processes in order to behave in a fashion that would benefit it. It is assumed that since SCP-204-1 requires organic flesh for sustenance, it needs SCP-204-2 to be in danger in order to "justify" its activation. See Addendum 1 for further details.

**Addendum 1:** There have been numerous recorded incidences where it is believed SCP-204-1 has been involved. The first such recorded incident was when a car was found in a residential street, completely torn apart and covered in partially devoured human remains. Similar incidents cropped up until Agents managed to track SCP-204-1 to ████████, ███████████ where they first made contact with the first recorded incarnation of SCP-204-2. It took three more attempts and over thirty casualties before SCP-204-1 and SCP-204-2 were contained. Interviews with SCP-204-2 revealed that it seemed to feel a need to experience danger, such as standing in traffic or provoking hostile responses from others. When questioned on its reasons, SCP-204-2 replied that SCP-204-1 allowed it to.

**Containment Protocol 204:** In order to keep SCP-204-1 successfully contained, it has been necessary to keep a permanent stock of candidates to replace SCP-204-2 in the event that the current one is terminated or abandoned. Ideally, all candidates should be orphans below the age of ten with a history of abuse. However, in times of need, Containment Protocol 204 may be authorized to allow candidates that don't meet specific requirements. They will be put under the supervision of "caretakers" which will consist of D-class personnel convicted of violent crimes, child abuse, and pedophilia with Foundation staff present to prevent inadvertent termination of candidates. Personnel selection for Containment Protocol 204 will follow the same guidelines as the special requirements for [[[SCP-231]]].

If SCP-204-2 successfully reaches the cut-off age of fourteen years and SCP-204-1 abandons it, then the former SCP-204-2 will be given a class-A amnesiac and a thorough psychological examination before being reintegrated into the government foster program. If it is deemed that the former SCP-204-2 cannot be successfully reintegrated, then the subject must be immediately terminated.

**Containment Tips:** It has come to my attention that not all of the security staff responsible for the containment of SCP-204-1 are fully knowledgeable on how to handle it. From my experience in actually hunting down this thing as well as dealing with its subsequent escape attempts, here are some vital tips that can mean the difference between life and death.

* Do not hesitate. Even though SCP-204-2 is a child, it will not hesitate to attack and kill you if it feels threatened.
* Do not rely upon surprise. Even if SCP-204-2 is unaware of your presence, SCP-204-1 is. It is impossible to surprise or ambush SCP-204-1 while it is in its dispersed mode. 
* Speed is key. You have to neutralize SCP-204-1 quickly, because it can't be bargained with, it can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. If given the chance, SCP-204-1 will quite literally devour you.
* Attack from multiple directions. Once SCP-204-1 materializes, it suffers from the same limitations as all other physical beings in that it cannot be in multiple locations at once. Flank it and set up a crossfire so that you have multiple lines of sight on SCP-204-2.
* Use //heavy// firepower. Do not be afraid to use the heaviest, most destructive weapons in your arsenal. Even though it's tough to neutralize, SCP-204-1 is not invincible and it will go down if subjected to enough punishment. To put things in perspective, when we finally contained SCP-204-1, we had to use an M1 Abrams battle tank and an AC-130 Spectre Gunship to disable it.

I hope these tips prove useful in your future endeavors. They will most likely save your life.

**Addendum 2:** The current SCP-204-2 is a twelve year old Caucasian girl by the name of "Jill". Outwardly, she appears calm and docile. However, in reality, this is merely a facade to hide her cold and calculating personality. SCP-204-2 possesses almost zero empathy for others and a feeling of superiority over its peers. During all interviews, it shows little respect and often makes threats to activate SCP-204-1. Like in all previous cases, SCP-204-2 must be approached and dealt with carefully to prevent from provoking SCP-204-1.
