**Item #:** SCP-2973

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** While not being tested SCP-2973 is to remain in a locked plastic case in Storage Site-12. SCP-2973's should remain at least 10 meters from all televisions, smart phones, or any other device that has a display screen. 

In the event that security around SCP-2973 is compromised, on-site personnel are authorized to destroy SCP-2973-1 either by destroying the device it is contained in or by powering down the device. It is necessary to destroy the device in the case that SCP-2973 has rendered this impossible to do digitally.

Digital devices with visual display screens are not permitted within 10 meters of SCP-2973's containment chamber. Testing of SCP-2973 and SCP-2973-1 require the approval of level-2 administrative personnel.

**Description:** SCP-2973 is an object identical to a Tamagotchi brand virtual pet toy, discovered in an elementary school in Albany, New York. The device was located when local reports were cross referenced regarding a computer virus plaguing the school. All televisions, computers, and phones in the school were rendered inoperable due to irreparable screen malfunctions at the time of its recovery. 

The toy itself displays no anomalous properties at the present although it may be capable of producing unique instances of SCP-2973-1.

The anomalous properties of SCP-2973 manifest when the device is turned on. When activated, SCP-2973 will display a blank screen with a pixel depiction of a tombstone in the center of the screen from which a new pixel sprite will emerge. This new sprite appears visually identical to typical Tamagotchi sprites with the exception of X symbols where eye sprites would typically be. The user of SCP-2973 cannot interact with this sprite in any way attributed to traditional use of a Tamagotchi toy. This character is referred to as SCP-2973-1.

SCP-2973-1 can exit the boundaries of SCP-2973's screen to appear on other electronic display. While inside of a display screen SCP-2973-1 is capable of interacting with file thumbnails and utilizing them in the typical manner that their thumbnails would in a physical reality, but cannot access the program functions of the files themselves. SCP-2973-1 will often consume these thumbnails, and in turn destroy the files, while it is present on a display outside of SCP-2973. It will then produce waste pixels in a fashion typical of a Tamagotchi pet after feeding. Devices containing waste pixels from SCP-2973-1 exude a scent typical of animal feces.

While SCP-2973-1 is inside of a display screen outside of SCP-2973 the user can interact with it through the device's main interface[[footnote]] Mouse, touch screen, touchpad, etc. [[/footnote]]. SCP-2973-1 can then be picked up and manipulated in this manner and can be flung by the user into another display screen using this momentum.

SCP-2973-1 will avoid directly interacting with the user at all times and will instead attempt to consume files the user deems important as dictated by how often the user accesses the file.

**Addendum A:** Testing event 2973-58. Presiding researcher Dr. Hollands. Transcript.

> {{**22:00**}} SCP-2973 is placed next to a mundane Tamagotchi virtual pet that has been activated five minutes prior to the testing (the subject).
> 
> {{**22:15**}} SCP-2973-1 turns to the subject.
> 
> {{**22:30**}} The subject begins buzzing[[footnote]] This action typically indicates that a Tamagotchi is well fed and does not require further feeding [[/footnote]] although it has already been fed. After executing a discipline function on the subject, it continues to buzz.
> 
> {{**22:31**}} SCP-2973-1 approaches the subject's device.
> 
> {{**22:31**}} SCP-2973-1 enters the subject's screen.
> 
> {{**22:35**}} The subject's device emits a continuous buzzing. The subject disappears into the right side of the screen, and is followed by SCP-2973-1. SCP-2973-1 continues chasing the subject in a scrolling parallax.
> 
> {{**22:36**}} The subjects are not depicted on the screen. The buzzing becomes erratic, and then stops.
> 
> {{**22:50**}} SCP-2973, 2973-1, and the testing subject remain inactive for an extended period.
> 
> {{**23:32**}} SCP-2973-1 reemerges from the side of the screen followed by a new instance of SCP-2973-1. The new instance of SCP-2973-1 displays visual similarities to the Tamagotchi pixel sprite from the subject's display screen.

**Addendum B:** Testing event 2973-58. Presiding researcher Breen. Transcript.

> In this test, SCP-2973 was placed beside a powered-off television to view the effects it has on such display screens.

> {{**12:20**}} SCP-2973 is placed before a security monitoring screen with the wireless adapter facing the display. The security monitor is assigned to the office of researcher Breen.
> 
> {{**12:22**}} SCP-2973-1 appears on the display screen of SCP-2973 and moves to the top of the screen where it then vanishes off-screen.
> 
> {{**14:23**}} SCP-2973-1 remains outside of any surrounding display screens for two hours.
> 
> {{**14:23**}} SCP-2973-1 unexpectedly appears on the security monitor of Dr. Breen's office, and approaches him. Dr. Breen does not react and is presumed unaware of/unable to percieve SCP-2973-1.
> 
> {{**14:24**}} SCP-2973-1 grasps Dr. Breen's arm and forcefully removes it. Post-test reports from outside of Dr. Breen's office report a loud cracking sound. Breen screams and begins to bleed profusely but shows no awareness of SCP-2973-1.
> 
> {{**14:25**}} Security personnel enter Dr. Breen's office but are unable to locate the source of Dr. Breen's injuries. SCP-2973-1 continues to maul Dr. Breen on the display screen. SCP-2973-1 then consumes Dr. Breen's head, killing him instantly.
> 
> {{**14:40**}} SCP-2973-1 remains on-screen for fifteen minutes before producing a waste pixel sprite. Personnel present in Dr. Breen's office report an overpowering scent typical of animal feces.
> 
> {{**14:42**}} Security vacates the room and seals it behind an emergency containment door as of Protocol 12-17[[footnote]] In the event of an anomalous manifestation in a non-containment wing of Site-12, all entries and exits affected by the effect, event, or entity must activate their emergency containment blast-doors.[[/footnote]]. Cameras are then disabled.
> 
> {{**14:45**}} Cameras and monitors to Dr. Breen's office are reactivated.
> 
> {{**14:46**}} SCP-2973-1 is no longer present on the security monitor and has reappeared on SCP-2973. Containment procedures have been updated.
