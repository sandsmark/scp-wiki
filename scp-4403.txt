**Item #:** SCP-4403

**Object Class:** --Keter-- Safe[[footnote]]##white|Uncontained ##[[/footnote]]

**Date Accessed:** 04/09/1983

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4403-1 is to be kept in a maximum security vault at Site-11. Due an ongoing attempt by members of Silent Crusade (Assigned GoI-4403) to recover SCP-4403-1, SCP-4403’s containment vault is built to specifications that are compliant with requirements for a class IX shelter.[[footnote]] Including but not limited to 30 meters of rebar concrete foundation, 2 meter thick steel walls reinforced with █████ Alloy compression mesh, and ███████ technology blocking flux from both tachyon and █████  particles[[/footnote]] Furthermore, following several espionage attempts on Foundation personnel with access to SCP-4403-1’s containment information by members of GoI-4403, Protocol Iron Sheaf [[footnote]]”Protocol Iron Sheaf is a step up from what the Foundation usually does for at-risk intel. On top of the information being only available on a need-to-know basis, the actual documents pertinent to SCP-4403 have been fully expunged in all electronic databases, and are only available in print in █ locations.” – RAISA Director Cade Whittaker [[/footnote]]and Protocol Blank Check[[footnote]]"Should a Foundation personnel be subject to blackmail by GoI-4403, amnesty will be granted to said employee for most crimes committed against the Foundation in exchange for reassignment of said personnel as a double agent working for the Foundation to gather information on GoI-4403." - Olga Dostov, Member of Foundation Intelligence Council and Former Head of MTF Iota-10 (Damn Feds).  [[/footnote]] has been enacted for all documents/personnel related to SCP-4403-1's containment. MTF Mu-32 (Janissaries)[[footnote]] Maintaining SCP-4403-1 under the Foundation's possession is of paramount importance due to the extreme deviation from normalcy misuse of SCP-4403 can cause to the standard time-line. Therefore, over 85% of Mu-32 personnel are combat veterans drafted from other MTFs[[/footnote]] have been assigned to Site-11 to safeguard and repel any attempts from armed members of The Silent Crusade to reclaim SCP-4403-1.

**Description:** SCP-4403 is an extradimensional space of indeterminate size that is currently in use by The Silent Crusade (GoI-4403) as their base of standard operation. 

The Silent Crusade utilized SCP-4403's anomalous properties to engage in various acts of inconspicuous warfare and subterfuge against nations and groups deemed 'unjust' in order to dramatically alter the events of standard time-line. For more details regarding The Silent Crusade, refer to the addenda below.

Entrances to SCP-4403 are capable of materializing in multiple locations simultaneously in the form of a passenger train with the doors leading to the interior of the train leading to the same space. The interior of SCP-4403 is incongruous to one of a non-anomalous passenger train, but rather presents the interior of a large building. Foundation personnel report seeing large dining halls, kitchens, bedrooms, offices, hydroponic farms, research labs, as well as multiple armories, training facilities, medical wards, and air locks[[footnote]]"Presumably to allow Silent Crusade Operatives to enter and exit vacuum or aquatic environments without compromising the entire facility, which raises another question - have these guys been fighting future wars in Space?" - Sargent Barry Choi, assigned to Mu-32[[/footnote]]. The fullest extent of SCP-4403's interior is unknown to the Foundation.

There seems to be no geographical limitation on SCP-4403's ability to manifest and de-manifest entrances to it. Furthermore, this ability is not limited to different locations in space, but also time. Therefore, SCP-4403 serves as a means for The Silent Crusade to rapidly deploy its personnel anywhere and anywhen. All entrances will vary in style and size depending on geographical location and temporal location, but they will always take form of a passenger train, or some mode of transportation should the time the location of the portal was created predates use of passenger trains.

It is hypothesized that SCP-4403 exudes a light antimemetic field that cloaks it from most casual observers. This effect extends to those that exit from SCP-4403 for an indeterminate amount of time. According to claims made by members of The Silent Crusade, SCP-4403 and people hidden in this way are visible to those with 'a heart that yearns for justice'. Further testing is ongoing to test the validity of this claim.[[footnote]]"We can't use most D-classes, that's for sure. Progress has been slow." -Level 4 Researcher Advaitha Singh[[/footnote]]

--It is theorized that a control room exists that allows the upper echelon of The Silent Crusade to select the location and time for gateway deployment-- SCP-4403-1 is a master key that fits into a control panel in the 'conductor's room' inside of SCP-4403. Use of SCP-4403-1 activates the control panel that allows one to make location and time selections for gateway creation. By extension, without SCP-4403-1, SCP-4403 would be rendered inert. For more details, see addendum 1

**Discovery:** SCP-4403, and by extension, The Silent Crusade as a group of interest was discovered by coincidence in 1982 when Doctor [[[Unforgettable, That's What You Are|Lyn Marness]]] noticed a pair of men in U.S. Union standard uniform and gear chatting in the middle of a local market in Kisuru, Kenya. At the time, Dr. Marness was under the influence of Class-X Mnestics, as he was returning from an assignment for the [[[Antimemetics Division Hub|Antimemetics Division]]]. Dr. Marness suspected anomalous activity related to antimemetics when he noticed that while the pair were present in a crowded Kenyan Marketplace, the local population did not react to the presence of the men. Doctor Marness approached the men, and the following exchange occurred:

> **Doctor Lyn Marness:** Excuse me gentlemen. //Doctor Marness puts his hands on the shoulder of one man from behind.// I couldn't help but admire the workmanship that went into your uniforms. Tell me, is there a reenactment of a battle going on nearby?
> 
> **Man 1, later named 'Absko':** //Man 1 noticeably jumps and looks startled.// How is it that you are able to see? Does your heart, too, burn with justice, for the desire to make things right, to right the endless wrongs committed, and will be committed by the wicked?
> 
> **Man 2, later named 'Thabiti':** Absko, he must be. The Knights oft regale us of tales of how our founder, the just flame in whose heart to that of ours was as the sun is to a candle, first found the Citadel and laid claim to it, so that the righteous everywhere and everywhen may heed the clarion call and congregate.
> 
> **Man 1 (Absko):** Tell me friend. Does what we described ring true for you? Indeed, we go to fight in the good battle, but not for amusement; we put our lives on the line to correct a terrible wrong.
> 
> **Doctor Lyn Marness:** My life's work is that of protecting the helpless and the unaware. 
> 
> **Man 2 (Thabiti):** Then you are worthy of seeing the Great Citadel. Tell me brother, are you able to come with us at this moment?
> 
> **Doctor Lyn Marness:** I have other duties to attend to at this moment. They are of paramount importance for completing my mission of protecting the innocent from a lurking threat that cannot be seen.
> 
> **Man 1 (Absko):** Then go, brother, and protect the helpless. Give us a time and a place brother, and Thabiti and I shall endeavor to meet with you.
> 
> **Closing Statement:** Dr. Marness made an appointment to meet the pair a week later. Upon returning to Site, Dr. Marness reported to the site director what had transpired. After deliberation, Dr. Marness was given approval to follow the men and find out more about The Silent Crusade (thereupon assigned GoI-4403), should he volunteer to do so. Dr. Marness agreed to the assignment, and entered SCP-4403 accompanied by Absko and Thabiti a week after. Upon his return, he had procured vital intelligence regarding SCP-4403 and the Silent Crusade.
[[/collapsible]]

Several Documents were given to Dr. Marness during his time inside SCP-4403. A scanning mechanism built into a pair of contact lenses were able to record the documents prior to Dr. Marness's amnesticization and release by The Silent Crusade. Summary of other vital information regarding The Silent Crusade is also given below.

]]

**Our Mission:** As a great man[[footnote]]Quote attributed to Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. in current time-line.[[/footnote]] will have put so eloquently: "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny." 

The said garment of destiny is slowly being woven from the inexorable loom of history. For those outside of The Citadel, they can only lament when they run their hands across the garment and see great holes rent in it by various injustices - seemingly irreparable wounds inflicted upon the human race by the wanton hatred and shortsighted greed of the unjust, and enabled by the indifference of the ignorant, and the apathy of the cowardly.

 It is not enough for the righteous to seek out infamy and fight it everywhere they find it, for the rips and tears inflicted cannot be mended this way. Therefore, the righteous must strive to do battle everywhere and **everywhen**.

While our numbers are humble, we are armed with knowledge of how all things that must be mended came to pass, and our hearts burn with the passionate flame to give our good cause our all. We are The Silent Crusade, and we shall mend the garment of destiny until the events come to pass where the speech in which the aforementioned garment was mentioned will never have been need to be said.

[[tab Structure of GoI-4403]]
"It seems The Silent Crusade is organized into a strict hierarchy where merit determines eligibility for promotion. As far as I could tell, there were no distinction in titles between Silent Crusade personnel that work as combatants in the field, research personnel, or bureaucrat. -Dr. Lyn Marness

**'The Founder':** "The Founder is a mysterious figure that supposedly first discovered SCP-4403 and established The Silent Crusade. Not much is known about this figure, but it is obvious that all members of GoI-4403 I've encountered hold him in reverence, some even to a fanatical degree."

**???:** From snippets of conversation I picked up, there is a good chance that the Templars are not the highest in the pecking order of the Silent Crusade. However, I could not push for more information without drawing suspicion/ire of others.

**Templars:** The existence of the Templars as a class were mentioned in a passing remark when I talked to the Knight that Absko and Thabiti brought me to. He mentioned submitting a report regarding their last mission to the Templars. This leads me to believe that Templars are the foundation analogue of Senior Researchers and Site Directors.

**Knights:** I had an opportunity to talk to a Knight when Absko and Thabiti first brought me into SCP-4403 to discuss my entry into The Citadel. Despite all three of them being in the Union Standard, the Knight definitely stood out. I don't know how to best describe it. Despite his diminutive stature being full two heads lower than mine, he exuded almost an aura of calm and confidence that I've only ever seen in two other people during my 35 years in the Foundation. He gazed at me with a set of piercing eyes that seemed to hint at me that he knew I was not being completely forthcoming with them. Made me real uneasy about what was about to happen without even saying a word. From what I've seen, it seems that as far as responsibilities go, knights are the Foundation analogues of MTF Captains/Researchers.

**Squires:** Squires are pages that have received the privilege of being considered full-fledged members of The Silent Crusade. They make up the brunt of the personnel in terms of sheer numbers. In the field, anywhere between 2 to 35 Squires are assigned per Knight. It is presumed that these groupings are kept between assignments, allowing for increased cohesion and communication between members. Closest Foundation analogues are low-ranking MTF Members and Junior Researchers.

**Pages:** Pages are the newest recruits into The Silent Crusade. From what I've gone through, an orientation of sorts followed by a vow of secrecy is needed in order to be considered a Page. Pages receive rudimentary training in order to become contributing members in various areas, whether it be research, combat, etc. Those that refuse to take the vow are given a drug that acts similar to a low-class amnestic before being released. I was under the influence of weak mnestics during the time I was given the amnestic, so I was successfully able to retain the information garnered, albeit with serious side effects[[footnote]]"Simultaneous use of Amnestics and Mnestics are the chemical equivalent of Trepanation" - [[[CASE COLOURLESS GREEN

[[tab Contingency Protocols of GoI-4403]]

**Protocol Nth Chance :** Enacted when a change to the time-line invariably contributes to a 'worse' outcome in the same conflict. Actions taken can range from preventing the execution of the original mission, to trying different methodologies.

**Protocol Crossroads:** Enacted when a change to the time-line invariably contributes to a 'worse' outcome in a separate conflict. Actions taken can range from preventing the execution of the original mission, to trying different methodologies.

**Protocol Deus Vult:** Used as a last resort, Protocol Deus Vult is enacted when a conflict becomes impossible to remedy with resources available to GoI-4403 alone. Involves breaching secrecy by members of GoI-4403 in order to prevent catastrophic damage to Earth, its biosphere, and human civilization.

Soon after Dr. Marness submitted his report, an emergency meeting was held by the upper echelon of The Foundation[[footnote]]Including but not limited to: Most Site Directors, MTF Heads and Veterans, The Ethics Council, the O5 Council, and Senior Members of RAISA[[/footnote]].

##white|[DATA EXPUNGED BY THE ORDER OF THE O5 COUNCIL]##

MTF Mu-32 (Janissaries) was rapidly formed for the express purpose of disabling SCP-4403 and/or neutralizing GoI-4403. Two days after Dr. Marness's return from SCP-4403, MTF Mu-32 supported by personnel from MTF Tau-5 (Samsara) and MTF Nu-7 (Hammer Down)[[footnote]]"There was a great amount of debate on whether if this level of armed response was necessary, as the Foundation has limited personnel, and there is an opportunity cost for using a MTF to aid in the containment of one anomaly. I cannot stress this enough, SCP-4403 was actively changing base timeline on a whim. We are lucky to have found GoI-4403 before they went and changed something in the past that potentially could have caused a cascade of events that eventually would have rendered the Foundation Nonexistent." -O5-2 [[/footnote]] entered SCP-4403 through a gateway. Despite heavy resistance from Silent Crusade operatives and the availability of technologically advanced weaponry to GoI-4403 members, Foundation MTFs were able to locate a heavily guarded room where SCP-4403-1 was recovered. SCP-4403-1 was successfully recovered and placed under Containment.

[[collapsible show="..."    hide="you have the right to know"]]

Aren't you curious as to what happened during WWII had the Silent Crusade not intervened?

Whoever you are, I know that you might be surprised to find data that was supposedly expunged by the O5 Council stapled behind the actual containment papers. You see, the one downside of Protocol Iron Sheaf is the fact that if someone with clearance decides to make... modifications to the documents, those will stay there until someone with the same clearance decides to do a parity check and decides to undo those changes.

But first, don't you think it's strange how despite the fact that you are one of the trusted few allowed access to this document, pieces of information are still expunged by 'The order of the O5 Council'?

Let me make this clear. Because of Protocol Iron Sheaf, No other versions of this Containment Procedure exist. As powerful as the Overseer Council may be, they are still subject to this protocol - meaning that they can't just enter some level 5 credential in a terminal somewhere and gain access to the expunged information. 

Funny considering one of the pieces of information is literally just what would have happened during WWII if the Silent Crusade had not intervened. We know it's not memetic or cognitohazardous, since if it was, they would have just said that it was, and would have circumvented it using one of the multitudes of methods available to the Foundation.

So why do they not want you to know?

I'll show you the redacted information, and hopefully the reason why this information was redacted becomes clear.

As influential the Silent Crusade was in influencing historical events, the resources available to them paled in comparison to what the Foundation had to offer. After SCP-4403-1 was recovered, there was a great fracas among the upper echelon of the Foundation on what the best course of action was. 
There was much talk of using SCP-4403 in conjunction with the other resources that the Foundation had at its disposal - both mundane and anomalous - to basically carry on what the Silent Crusade was doing, albeit under careful scrutiny of our organization. If a tiny organization could limit the damage done to the world in a major global conflict such as WWII by such an immense amount, imagine what the Foundation could do - or so the argument went.

 Of course, the old guard, like O5-1, wanted to lock SCP-4403-1 up and forget about it just like the other hundreds of safe class objects we had. 

What they didn't count on was that between the time that they had first came to power and now, how most people thought the way the Foundation ought to be run had [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3241|Changed. Dramatically.]]] You see, to a substantial number of us, working for the Foundation was more than just taking anomalies and sticking them inside boxes, oh no. As cheesy and idealistic as this may sound, for some, to work for the Foundation was to make a positive difference in this world. To these new faces, SCP-4403 presented an unprecedented opportunity. For others, SCP-4403 presented a chance to atone for horrible deeds that they had committed in the name of the [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-foundation-eats-babies|greater good.]]]

The resulting furor over the difference was nothing like the Foundation had ever seen before.

> **Subject:** "On nature of Spatiotemporal Dimensions" by Dr. Advaitha Singh, head of Extradimensional Paratech Application Team at Site 199.
> 
> As of currently, there are two major arguments on why SCP-4403 ought to be rendered inert instead of being actively utilized by The Foundation. The first is the age-old platitude that the Foundation's mission is to only interfere in the realm of the anomalous. This argument is disingenuous because it blithely assumes that the realm of the anomalous and the realm of the mundane are discrete from one another, when in reality, they share the world that we live in. It is because that these two realms overlap, present dangers to normalcy caused by the anomalous are able to exist, and it is our duty to preserve that normalcy as members of the SCP Foundation.
> 
> But then the question inevitably arises: what is the fundamental difference between disruption to normalcy caused by, lets say, an omnicidal lizard and a genocidal regime? The answer is, there is none. Therefore, if we have a moral duty to prevent wanton loss of life and unnecessary destruction at the hands of the anomalous, then we cannot shirk at giving the same treatment to disasters caused by more worldly causes. 
> 
> The other, more substantial argument is the prudent concern that meddling with the past can create unforeseen negative consequences. However, this unfair misconception is grounded in a mistaken belief that there is a fundamental difference between space and time. Let me make this clear. There is no intrinsic difference between the dimension of 'space' and the dimension of 'time'. It is the law of this particular universe that while movement in the 3 dimensions we have designated 'spatial' be a simple undertaking, movement along the 4th dimension that has been designated as 'temporal' be limited to that of a constant, unidirectional one. As far as the universe is concerned, causal events that propagate due to changes made in different spaces and different times are exactly identical. 
> 
> For example, let us say I was to travel backwards along the axis of time and - lets say - shoot someone. To a being that can freely move along dimension axes we have designated 'spatial' and 'temporal', the causal structure generated from that change is indistinguishable to the causal structure generated by a change effected along an axis of 'space'. To us, the only difference between changes along 'time' and 'space' are how difficult to rectify the unforeseen consequences of such changes. SCP-4403 removes that difficulty for the former.
> 
> I'll be blunt. The Foundation has extensive knowledge on nature of causality, thanks to research done on several [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2820|anomalies]]] we have at hand. Using our knowledge, we can prevent some of humanity's greatest tragedies it has inflicted on itself. Our methodology will be much more refined than the Silent Crusade - I daresay it will be akin to comparing a surgeon's scalpel to a sharpened rock club.

> I implore the Overseer Council to take into consideration the latest developments and findings in this field and make a decision that isn't based on past prejudices and fears, but rather one based on rationality and what is best for humanity.

Investigation shows that had the failsafe been in place, the damages done on ██/██/1999 would have been greatly mitigated.

While you may have chuckled at the idea of several prominent members of the Foundation calling O5-1 a 'stubborn old fart', to the aforementioned old guard, the fact that so many under their chain of command had such incompatible views on what to do with these anomalies was a wake up call. In response, they not only expunged what had happened during that meeting, but even the fact that there was something to be expunged. To the untrained eye, there is nothing unusual here. The Foundation is exactly the same as it was 25, 50 years ago.

Herein lies the problem. Most Foundation Personnel were recruited for being brilliant thinkers and innovators in their field. Forming a gathering of such thinkers, and then telling them to not think and obey blindly, in hindsight, was foolish. 

And the funny thing is, prior to the debacle that was the last motion of the meeting, those that did voice dissent still followed protocol and followed their orders to the letter. Doling out punishments for violating orders and protocol is one thing. Actually doling out harsh punishments for daring to question authority was something that was never done before in the history of the Foundation. Ironically, O5-1 did set a dangerous precedent.

I'll be blunt, SCP-4403-1 is no longer in the Foundation's possession. Take a couple hundred people who had spent decades working for our organization. All this time, they've been told that despite knowingly sending people to die at hands of horrors untold, despite seeing their friends and comrades be devoured by the same horrors, and in some cases, committing what would normally be a crime against humanity, their actions were just because the Foundation was just. 

We were content to send others to die in the dark, and die in the dark ourselves - because the world would live on in the light because of it.

There weren't any 'active espionage attempts' or 'threats of invasion' from The Silent Crusade. Why would they need to use force and deception when the very people that are supposed to stand in opposition to them believed in what their mission?

It just took one disillusioned person to defect to The Silent Crusade with SCP-4403-1.

What happened with SCP-4403 was a huge wake up call for these people. They now had doubts. They weren't working for an organization that sought to do the most good, but instead for an organization who cared about maintaining control. The fact that the Foundation spent millions in funding and dwindling human resources to keep up the farce of containing an anomalous item that no longer existed in their possession was the final nail in the coffin for those that knew the truth.

If you don't believe me, when the word inevitably comes out, The Foundation will blame their loss on 'Protocol Sleeping Nephilim' and the need to 'prevent panic and demoralization' or some other platitude along those lines. 

What is Protocol Sleeping Nephilim anyways?

In short, The Silent Crusade sent its soldiers far ahead in time to acquire armaments so technologically advanced, any armed conflict between them any non-anomalous contemporary fighting force would result in a rout for the latter.

These 'super soldiers' were put in stasis at a secure location, and every month, a member of the Silent Crusade would open a gateway to that safe location in order to prolong the stasis for another month.

Should the Silent Crusade be unable to follow through because SCP-4403-1 was taken by force from an external enemy, the soldiers would awaken and, using quantum resonance tracking, relentlessly try to retrieve SCP-4403-1. 

You'd be surprised to learn that Protocol Sleeping Nephilim was never needed for the Silent Crusade to recover SCP-4403-1. Why win us over with bolts of plasma and motion projectors when they've already won over many of our hearts and minds?

I tacked these pages onto the back of this document sheaf on 08/21/1983. On average, I wager a unique person with the clearance to view this document visits this particular location once every 50 days or so. The fact that this is still around for you to read should be proof enough of the wavering loyalty of many among our ranks to the Foundation.

But know this, while I may have betrayed the Foundation by writing this, I still serve the idea the Foundation stood for, and hopefully will stand for in the future.

So. With this knowledge, what will you do? 

Will you rip these unsanctioned addenda off the back of the containment file and report a major security breach as protocol demands?

Will you decide that whoever comes after you has the right to know what happened to SCP-4403-1 and just leave this here?

Will you leave the Foundation and look for other ways to serve humanity?

It honestly does not matter to me which you choose. I chose what I thought would be the best for the world moving forward, and I made that choice by weighing the facts and coming to my own conclusions, instead of blindly following orders from a bureaucrat who, to me, was clearly out of touch. 

Many of my colleagues chose to stay, believing that as years pass and people die, there will come a time when those with their hearts in the right place will rise to positions of authority in the organization. Just as many chose to defect.

Regardless, we shall die in the darkness so that the world can live in light. The battlefields in which we fight and die may differ, but our goals remain the same.

I see one now. A dilapidated tram car, just like the one I used to ride in Mumbai with my mother before she passed away from tuberculosis. Right in the middle of the park 300 meters away from our building.

Funny though, I don't remember taking any Mnestics.
