What's been going on in the community aside from our site? Well...

* [[*user A Random Day]] diligently scoured the web for all manner of fan art, but if you know of something he missed, let him or [[*user rumetzen]] know!

++++ Fanart

Thanks for tuning in again, folks! If you're unsatisfied with the blurb(s) provided for the article(s) you wrote, feel free to change it. Of course, you could just avoid that problem entirely by sending [[*user A Random Day]] or [[*user rumetzen]] a blurb for your article. We may or may not use it (if we can think of something more attention-getting, though we can try to stick with one you give us) but we'd really would just like them in order to make the process easier for making these. This is a community thing, and we want authors to give their blurbs to sell these articles much easier. It reduces the workload we have to do, and helps the news come out that much earlier! 


Thank you all for continuing to be an excellent community <3
