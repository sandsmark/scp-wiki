**Item #:** SCP-333

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-333-α 1-1618 are to be stored in a standard Secure Containment Locker within Site ██, accessible only by personnel possessing Level 3 Clearance or greater with authorization of at least two (2) Clearance Level 4 personnel. As testing with SCP-333-β and SCP-333-γ has concluded, any performance of SCP-333-α is strictly prohibited.

**Description:** SCP-333-α are 1,618 identical copies of a musical score of unknown title and origin. When the score denoted by SCP-333-α is performed by an orchestra of sufficient size, (see **Addendum 333-β-1**) SCP-333-β manifests. The chamber SCP-333-α is performed in may be entered normally; however, roughly three minutes into a performance, anything leaving the chamber arrives in SCP-333-β. Reentry of the performance hall from SCP-333-β is possible, given it is temporarily integrated into SCP-333-β.

SCP-333-β appears to be a metropolitan area, devoid of any signs of habitation, past or present. Due to its nature, it is unknown when SCP-333-β was constructed, using what materials, by whom, or even if it was constructed in the conventional sense at all (see **Addendum 333-α-β-1**). For as long as performance of SCP-333-α continues, SCP-333-β may be traversed --freely. Preliminary testing concerning utilizing SCP-333-β as a multipurpose Foundation facility appears promising (see **Addendum 333-β-2**).-- (see **Addenda 333-γ-1 and 333-α-β-2**) Following cessation of a performance, SCP-333-β dematerializes, along with anything within at the time (see **Addendum 333-α-1**). Instrumentation left within suggests that unless a performance of SCP-333-α is occurring, SCP-333-β experiences no passage of time and may not exist at all.

SCP-333-γ, codenamed Discord, is a highly aggressive entity of variable appearance and composition residing within SCP-333-β. All manifestations of SCP-333-γ have proven much more durable than its composition would suggest, requiring considerable firepower to terminate outside of SCP-333-β and possessing apparent invincibility while within (see **Addendum 333-γ-2**). Should SCP-333-γ manage to escape SCP-333-β, it will remain until the next time SCP-333-β manifests unless terminated; following termination, SCP-333-γ will dematerialize as well.

**Addendum 333-α-1:** The content of all 1,618 original instances of SCP-333-α have been observed to change following each performance. All remain identical to each other. Copies of SCP-333-α do not display this polymorphic nature.

**Addendum 333-α-2:** Changes undergone by 333-α appear to constitute the inclusion of motifs representing any foreign materials left behind by exploration teams. Given that copies of original 333-α do not update to reflect material within 333-β, it may be possible to selectively manifest materials and possibly even personnel within 333-β. A more in-depth cost-benefit analysis will follow.

**Addendum 333-β-1:** 333-β will not fully manifest unless 333-α is performed by a minimum of forty-nine (49) musicians within a single concert hall. Larger numbers of musicians appear to correlate to a larger and more complex metropolitan area. Additionally, simultaneous performances in differing locales results in integration of all concert halls within which 333-α is being performed. 333-β could hypothetically serve as a means of rapid transit between Foundation facilities.

**Addendum 333-β-2:** Cost-benefit analysis RE: SCP-333 as a Foundation asset.
* --Rapid long-distance transit.--
 * --If used for transit between facilities, 333-β could allow for rapid dissemination of SCP objects in the event of a containment breach. This risk should not be taken lightly.--
* --Cloning of personnel, items, SCP objects, etc, effectively granting the Foundation access to infinite resources.--
* --A contingency plan in case of ██, ██, or ██ Class events.--
 * --Personnel critical to the operation of the Foundation, a cache of useful SCP objects, and a store of various provisions and resources could be left within 333-β. This would ensure their survival, provided performance of a suitable copy of 333-α may take place.--
* --A garrison and armory.--
* --The song itself could be utilized as several different Foundation facilities simultaneously.--
 * --Particularly dangerous Euclid and Keter objects could each be deposited in their own instance of 333-β.--
  * --If 333-α is performed as it was prior to an SCP object being deposited, 333-β will manifest without the SCP.--
  * --If 333-α is performed as it is following an SCP object being deposited, 333-β will manifest with the SCP present.--
 * --Performances of identical copies of 333-α could take place in several locations, allowing access to the prospective facility from several places.--
  * --A kill switch to sever 333-β from any adjoining facilities is strongly advised.--
--The risk of accidental discovery of the 333-α should be carefully considered before any utilization of the 333-β for these purposes takes place.--

Consult **Addendum 333-α-β-2**.

**Addendum 333-α-β-1:** Visual, chemical, and mass spectrometric examination of structures within 333-β indicates their composition is directly dependent upon the composition of instrumentation utilized for the corresponding performance of 333-α. Additionally, it appears that the better a particular instrument is played, the less its composition is reflected within 333-β. Given that structures within 333-β are always of similar composition to the instruments utilized, it has been suggested that these structures may not have a finite composition. However, considering errors cause the composition of a particular instrument to feature more prominently, it is also possible that corruption of 333-β is unavoidable due to general inability to perform 333-α precisely enough.

Experiment Logs SCP-333-α-β 1-9 are pending declassification.

**Addendum 333-α-β-2:** //Corruption of materials left within 333-β has been noted. This corruption generally takes the form of miniscule changes in chemical composition of objects left within, though in extreme cases physical deformation has been observed. Notable examples include malfunction of RoV-13b due to critical circuitry being displaced by [REDACTED] and the discovery of D-17711's skeletal system being comprised of .1% brass by weight. I hereby rescind my prior recommendations for utilization of SCP-333.// - Dr. N██████

**Addendum 333-γ-1:** 333-γ is capable of leaving 333-β. Any sighting of 333-γ within 333-β is grounds for immediate evacuation and cessation of 333-α performance.

**Addendum 333-γ-2:** Operation ██████████ unsuccessful. Operational losses exceed 90%. A five (5) megaton tactical nuclear device was detonated within 333-β in a last-ditch attempt to prevent 333-γ escaping. 333-γ was undeterred.

**Addendum 333-β-γ-1:** Composition of 333-γ appears linked to musical instruments utilized in similar fashion to 333-β. Closer scrutiny of footage recorded during Experiments SCP-333-α-β 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 has found 333-γ present, appearing to be of similar composition to each corresponding instance of 333-β, making it difficult to distinguish from its surroundings. This likely explains why its presence initially went unnoticed.

**Addendum 333-α-β-γ-1:** Computer-aided analysis of 333-α and all copies thereof, considered alongside the events of Experiments SCP-333-α-β 1-9 and Operation ██████████ indicates beyond a shadow of a doubt that 333-α dictates any and all occurrences within 333-β, including activity of Foundation personnel and 333-γ. All further testing of SCP-333 is hereby suspended indefinitely.
