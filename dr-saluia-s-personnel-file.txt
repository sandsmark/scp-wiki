------
**Background:** Graduated University of Calgary //magna cum laude// with a PhD in Clinical Psychology and a Masters in Forensic Psychology. He was headhunted by the Foundation from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's Criminal Psychology Unit, K Division. He spent five years as a Level 0 Site-17 Staff Counselor until incidental exposure to SCP-████ during Incident C-████-14. A subsequent re-evaluation of his psychological profile showed the propensity for anomalous psychological research. His security clearance was subsequently elevated to Level 3 and he was inducted into the Anomalous SCP Psychotherapy (ASP) research wing.

**Miscellaneous:** Dr. Salvia lost his right leg at the knee during Incident C-████-14 and now relies on a prosthetic to walk. He owns a snake-headed maplewood cane he claims to have made himself. In China, evidently, from words stamped on the cane.  He often expresses strong nationalist pride in his home country (Canada), is bi-lingual in English and French, and is a certified Dudeist priest.

**Reprimands:**
* 4 Incidents involving smoking in restricted areas.
* 3 Incidents involving being reminded to shave and groom his hair before taking part in research projects where sanitation is crucial.
* 1 Incident involving his attempt to wed Doctors Bright and Light without their consent via his authority as a priest of Dudeism. (//C'mon, how could I not? Light-Bright! Light-Bright! Turn on the magic of colored light!//)
* 3 Incidents involving the smuggling of restricted foodstuffs into the Site-17 mess hall. (//They're just cheese curds. I'm not eating poutine with goddamn mozzarella. That's just wrong, man.//)

> **O5 Addendum:** Dr. Salvia has passed each of his routine psychological evaluations with flying colors. This in and of itself would not be alarming for certain jobs, but this Foundation work. Even the loss of his leg and subsequent exposure to anomalous threats has done nothing to affect his stress or performance levels. This phenomenon required more study, so Dr. Salvia was given Level 3 clearance and put in a position where he could be more closely observed.
