||||~ ^^Apparently this is the only image we can get of him that has not been corrupted by [[[SCP-732]]]. It is very probable that this picture has also been contaminated. Or is it caused by the guy himself?^^ ||

**Notes about Subject:**
Agent Carrion Trooper was found walking around Site-██ while wearing a flak jacket and civilian clothes. When subject is about to be terminated, he managed to disable some of our security personnel, while all the time muttering that this was a mistake. Eventually we were able to negotiate with him and discover what his intentions are. His reason of breaking in Site-██ was because he 'could not find the receptionist, and besides, it's an effective way to show you what I got to offer'. He is in complete support of the organization, and is found to have no connections with forbidden or highly dangerous organizations. After assessing his skills, we decided that he should be assigned to undercover duty in his hometown of █████████, Indonesia. So far he has located some SCPs with aid from his intelligence sources, and proved to be a useful agent on the field. From time to time we will contact him for field duty. 

**ADDITIONAL NOTE(S):**

-It seems that Agent Carrion Trooper has a mutated strain of SCP-008 in his blood. How it got there is unknown, and when informed of this, he just shrugs it off. "I don't know how it got there either, but it's best this way... it doen't do any harm, does it?" Agent Carrion Trooper afterwords decided on his codename. Some research may be done in regards on using the mutated SCP-008 strain as a counter agent to SCP-008 (//approval pending//).

**SCPs Acquired:**
[[[SCP-494]]]
[[[SCP-684]]]
[[[SCP-741]]]
[[[SCP-752]]]
[[[SCP-864]]]
[[[SCP-920]]]
[[[SCP-821]]]
[[[SCP-605]]]

**Note:** That's the cover story anyways. In reality, ''Carrion Trooper' is Ed Bates, Site 17 janitor. Thanks to a bet between Bright and Kondraki, he is being reconditioned to believe this about himself. The officially stated reason is that 'it'll have to be good for something, somewhere down the line.'

**Note:** Further background checks reveal that there is no personnel named 'Ed Bates' in Site 17. We are absolutely in the dark about this. Document has been checked for corruption involving SCP-███, but after extensive testing there is no evidence of corruption.

**Note:** Yes, That's what we want him to think too.

**Note:**
I snuck a sample taken from 304 into his food. This should be amusing.

**Note:** It seems that after Agent CarrionTrooper had found SCP-304 in his food, he proceeds to eat it. After a physical examination, thethere seems to be an inert, mutated strain of SCP-008 in his blood. Agent CarrionTrooper is showing no weird behavior or physiological change. Only comment when told that there's a sample of SCP-304: "Wait, what?"

**Note**
Kind of anticlimactic, but still quite amusing. We should sneak a sample into Joystick's food next.

**Note:**
It has been found out that Agent CarrionTrooper was a victim of SCP-008. We have given him an SCP-500 duplicated by SCP-038. It was a very rare window of chance that recovered him almost completely, and only a few inert strains of SCP-008 are found in the bloodstream. The test reports on him were previously thought to have been lost on Site-██'s destruction, but a copy of it was recently found in Site-██. His reason for snooping around in Site-██ was actually to find a cure, and well, it did. His memory was altered slightly, which explains the contradicting statements above.

**Note:** //Agent "CarrionTrooper" is obviously a deranged and dangerous reality bender. Will terminate at first opportunity.//  - Clef

**Note:** //Dangerous? The man claims to be able to talk to coffee.// - Kulzn

**Note:** //I do not claim to be able to bend reality, but to each their own. Reality is as what we claim to as 'real', nothing more and nothing less... Some people's realities are more malleable than others, that I take for granted... And oh, there's someone waiting for Kulzn beneath the coffee.// - Carriontrooper

**Note:** //Carrion has been reprimanded for the failed attempt to "hide" a claymore mine under Kulzn's coffee, the consequences of which were minor due to the incredibly obvious nature of the trap and the failure to actually arm the device. As of █-█-████ has been put on probation, and his security clearance has been temporarily revoked. Reasons include not only dangerous intent, but the incompetence involved in operating a simple explosive device.// -Dr. Kondraki

**Note:** //WUT? Of course it's not armed! It's meant to be a birthday present to Kulzn! Since I don't know when his birthday is (or anyone else in the Foundation; for all I know, they're all born on [DATA EXPUNGED]...), I decided to give him a little suprise gift! Can't you see the blue, green, and red ribbons I thinly disguised as wires?//

**Note:** //Despite repeated requests, (and yes Bright, I know most of them were from you, changing the name signed does not change your writing style), Carrion Trooper will not be, and I quote 'Terminated for his own good.' Yet. Carrion Trooper (God, what a silly name) is instead assigned to be nursemaid for [[[SCP-590]]], for a 6 month shift.// -O5-6

**Note:** //Talks to coffee, speaks Javanese, you see where I'm going with this.// - Kulzn

**Note:**//It's not quite clear, but this record may be corrupted by [[[SCP-732]]]. Proceed with caution.// - Agent Carriontrooper

**Note:**//There's COFFEE... and there's JAVA... you see?// - Kulzn

Without beginning or end, his faggotry stretches into the infinite.  Godspeed.

**Message to CarrionTrooper**
I hereby declare myself your arch-fucking-nemesis.
-Malign

**Note:**//COFFEE! JAVA! It's not that hard to grasp!// - Kulzn

**Note to Malign:**
Meh, it ain't my contaminant. But okay, if you do want a nemesis, I would happily make your life hell. It's where we're all headed now, isn't it? Oh, and do mind that tripwire I've put in your office, it's stealthy.
- CarrionTrooper

**Note:** //It should be noted that Carrion is inept in matters involving the operation of explosive devices. It turns out Carrion installed the damn thing vertically, which only served to make a single small area of his office dangerous.// - Dr. Kondraki

**Note:** //I have an office?// -Malign
