**Expertise:** Intelligence gathering, [DATA EXPUNGED], and [DATA EXPUNGED].

**History:** Information about this person is largely corrupted, but it is known that he originated from Indonesia. He had entered Universitas Gadjah Mada (Gadjah Mada University) in Yogyakarta, but his records were incomplete and rendered as useless data. He was initially encountered by the foundation while investigating a possible SCP in [DATA EXPUNGED], and intrigued field agents by discreetly [DATA MISSING]. After an intense quarantine and testing period of [DATA EXPUNGED], he was recruited as an undercover agent. His skill in intelligence gathering is quite high, and personnel must keep from telling him [DATA MISSING].

It is noted, however, that the subject had suffered mental delusions that could be attributed either to his slightly eccentric nature or a past experience with a memetic SCP. Also, due to an unknown reason, he had often been mistaken for a lot of things, resulting in confusion, annoyance, and/or hilarity for other personnel. 

Additional note: Agent Carriontrooper is not very adept at the proper use and deployment of explosives, although he often uses them. Excercise caution when he is in the vicinity. Please return all unexploded ordnance or explosives found in the immediate area back to the explosives storage or the armory.
