Commentary on said works, if you wish to read it:

* Ever, Only, All: This was my first work on the site - literally 6000+ words recapping what I know about evolutionary history so far, as seen through Bronze Age eyes. Slightly Granola Sarkic, looking backwards.
* Kadakúni tales: Another internet writer, [https://fialleril.tumblr.com/tagged/tatooine-slave-culture fialleril], developed an AU culture for Star Wars Tatooine. I decided that I wanted one of those things for myself, so I made one.
* Klavigar Character Studies: Second-person point of view is difficult to pull off, sometimes, but I do think it serves well for characters that occupy a somewhat mythical role, where first-person would feel too intimate and grandiose, while third-person would feel too cold and would not permit the reporting of private thoughts and feelings.
