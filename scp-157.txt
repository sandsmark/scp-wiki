**Item #:** SCP-157

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Item SCP-157 is to be kept in a sealed lead box inside an otherwise empty room. Personnel assigned to study SCP-157 must be unarmed, wearing Class IV biohazard suits. In the event of a suit breach, the compromised personnel will be subject to a cavity search and X-ray. If SCP-157 is not on the offender’s person, they will be subject to a full body MRI before being released.

**Description:** SCP-157 is a firearm cartridge of inconstant make and caliber, shifting form to match the make of any gun brought within 30 meters. Previously, SCP-157 has been recorded changing size as large as an artillery shell. (See Documents) SCP-157 exerts an unconscious pull on persons within 30 meters. Class D personnel exposed to the cartridge outside of its lead case report feelings of euphoria and delusions of grandeur. They also report a strong desire to load SCP-157 into a weapon, and become violent when they are restrained from doing so. When a gun is loaded with SCP-157 it will not fire unless pointed at a living target.

**Addendum 157-1:** SCP-157’s first recorded use was in April of 1775 during the battle at Old North Bridge in Concord, Massachusetts. SCP-157 was seen again in 1914 on June 28th, where it was used to assassinate the Archduke Franz Ferdinand. SCP-157 showed up a third time in Russia during the October revolution as an artillery shell fired from the Cruiser Aurora. (As the shell fired was a blank, SCP-157 seems to have the capability to change its composition.) The most notable appearance of SCP-157 was when it was a 6.5 x 52 mm round fired from the Italian Carcano rifle that killed John F. Kennedy. SCP-157 was last found in a Titan Missile Silo in 1989, where it was sealed and transported to its current location.

**Addendum 157-2:** When brought near [[[SCP-127]]], SCP-157 changed shape to a large bone slug, approximately 7.62cm (3in) in length and 2.54cm (1in) in diameter. The slug was irregularly shaped and appeared to be boiling as if from the inside. At the same time, an orifice in SCP-127 appeared to allow the slug to be inserted.

Testing with class-D personnel have been scheduled to discern the effects of this slug.

**Addendum 157-3** SCP-157 was brought near [[[SCP-985]]]. SCP-157 changed shape into a round of unknown caliber with a pointed tip, apparently glass. Further examination revealed what looked appeared to be an antimatter reservoir inside the glass tip, suspended by unknown means. Firing not recommended, as the range of the smallest possible explosion would be far greater than the range of the bullet.
