**__Quotations from Coworkers:__**

"Dr. Mander-Bassen is a fantastic person to work for. Some people in higher staff positions can become very stern and easily upset. That will never happen with Gerry, because getting angry requires way too much effort and cannot easily be done while reclining on a couch." - Researcher Gary Weinrib 

"That guy is at least easy to tolerate. If the entire staff of Site 19 was stranded on a mountain and we had to eat each other, I'd eat him last. I'd still eat him though." - Researcher Nick Mason

"Oh yeah that balding guy. Yeah he's nice I guess, kind of weird though." - Senior Researcher Guillaume Emmanuel 

"Gerry is a sweet, friendly, and compassionate man. He tries to the best of his ability to befriend everyone in the office. This is a perfect example of someone growing their positive qualities to make up for their incredibly disappointing █████." - Dr. Madison Acid

"This is the worst resume I've ever seen. It looks terrible, most of it is completely irrelevant, and you don't put quotes from coworkers on a resume." - Site Director Rody Walker
