**__Quotations from Coworkers:__**

"Dr. Mander-Bassen is a fantastic person to work for. Some people in higher staff positions can become very stern and easily upset. That will never happen with Gary, because getting angry requires way too much effort and cannot easily be done while reclining on a couch." - Researcher Gary Weinrib 

"That guy is at least easy to tolerate. If the entire staff of Site 19 was stranded on a mountain and we had to eat each other, I'd eat him last. I'd still eat him though." - Researcher Nick Mason

"Oh yeah that balding guy. Yeah he's nice I guess, kind of weird though." - Senior Researcher Guillaume Emmanuel 

"Gary is a sweet, friendly, and compassionate man. He tries to the best of his ability to befriend everyone in the office. This is a perfect example of someone growing their positive qualities to make up for their incredibly disappointing █████." - Dr. Madison Acid

"This is the worst resume I've ever seen. It looks terrible, most of it is completely irrelevant, and you don't put quotes from coworkers on a resume." - Site Director Rody Walker

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-3636 - The World's Greatest Jukebox (and Experiment Log 3636)"  hide="- How I wrote a lesbian trickster sorceress in the form of a Wurlitzer and got away with it."]]

Wow what a way to start off my SCP writing career. Easily my most well known and beloved article, this was something that crawled into my head one day after hearing about Elton John's fan music video contest. I just imagined making goofy unauthorized music videos for different songs.Then I started writing it as an SCP. I always liked the rainbow-y jukebox design and that's the famous Wurlitzer design. I didn't put two and two together that I lived like ten minutes away from the place they used to be produced and that probably had something to do with it. 

People love this SCP, and at first I saw that as kind of intimidating that I could never possibly live up to my first article. Now I'm just happy that so many people like the character. People have made memes, web comics, and fan art of my goofy little jukebox. Not to mention the experiment log that has taken on a life of its own. I used to strictly curate everything on there and now I only really clean out things that are complete grammatical disasters or overtly out of place entries when I notice them. The "Ode to a Superhero" entry is not mine, but it is probably the funniest one on there so someone managed to get an even bigger laugh out of one of my ideas, which I love.

If this is the only thing I'm remembered for writing, that's fine by me.

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-4462 - Fan Death"  hide="- Oof."]]

This one has been controversial since day one. I originally started writing this right after the SCP-3636 Experiment Log and it was controversial since day one. Over the course of two years I must have shown this draft to three dozen people.  I don't think I got the same opinion once.  Eventually after kicking around the draft to 150ish revisions I decided just to get a few last people to critique it and give it a post. 

This was my take on how as a writer I felt like I was never the person that my writing conveyed, that I was always kind of in the shadow of my writing, and that my best ideas were behind me. I was also reflecting on my larger mental well being to the struggles of authors I admired. This was the end result. I don't expect it to ever be all that popular unless I give it a rewrite but I don't even know where to start. I've heard people say I should just take the letters and make them a separate story but I feel like the context is important.

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-5017 - Hard Landing"  hide="- No one is ever gonna solve that cipher"]]

5kon entry. Didn't place all that high. I had a ton of fun writing it though, and the cipher was a fun touch that I'm glad I added. I've always loved druids, Celtic paganism, D.B. Cooper, stories with historical connections, and stories where The Foundation are the cast as sort of an evil protagonist. That all kind of came to a head in this story and for better or for worse, it contains all of those elements. Now it is a mostly ignored article, maybe some day I'll touch up the story a little bit.  

I will buy candy for whoever ends up cracking that cipher.

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-5544 - Are You Sick of All The Stares?"  hide="- ''Because love can burn like a cigarette and leave you with nothing''"]]

I'm glad this found an audience. Needless to say, there's a lot of myself in this character and I think if somebody really did the time and did some digging they'd see that there's even more of myself in there than you'd probably expect. I wanted to give an apt metaphor for my own struggle with panic disorder and depression. I wanted to capture that feeling of absolute dread, knowing that it is going to happen again. Rolling all of my fears into this article the very noticeable incident, the lowering of status, the ability to affect other people negatively, the social barriers it creates, the failed relationships, the inability to truthfully move on because you know it is going to happen again. I somehow turned all of that into an article and it worked.

There's also copious amounts of TV Girl influence, specifically references to their fantastic album //French Exit// which are littered throughout. Lyrical references are sprinkled in throughout and every single song shows up at least once in some capacity. The final line of the article (excluding footnotes) is even an intentional parallel to the final line of the album. 

I saw a fantastic meme about this article that someone made when this was published but it was a really busy time with Jamcon, the 096 short film, and a handful of other fantastic SCPs taking up most of the attention. I hope this will someday go from sleeper hit to legitimate contender for my most popular article, but the road to the Jukebox's throne is long and difficult.

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-5064 - Safety Dance"  hide="- Explosions!"]]

Jamcon 2020, prompt one. 

I used to film dance competitions every weekend. Most of the time quite literally as the videographer but some times as an event manager which basically meant salesperson.  The point being, for three years of my life I was in another part of the country every weekend watching kids dance for incredibly long hours. There's something so unique, so focused about gathering people together for a competition that it just sort of becomes normal that it is all that everyone is talking about. Having a conversation that didn't revolve around the event was just not the norm.

 Anyways the job had great weekends and horrible weekends and you never knew what you were going to get and that made the job all that more interesting to me. I got dropped like a rock recently and reflecting on the experience has made me miss it more than I thought I would. I had kind of romanticized the "I'm going on an adventure to another state to see what awaits me there" part of the job and I just kind of accepted the fact I'd be watching somewhere between six to fourteen hours of dance a day.

That's what lead to these dance obsessed sticks of dynamite. I do someday want to add more to the interviews and give this article a proper ending, but a researcher just enjoying a weird, funny quirk of their job was enough for me, and it seems it work for other people as well.

[[collapsible show="+ Just Desserts"  hide="- Delicious"]]

Jamcon 2020, prompt two.

I wrote this in one go and then went to bed. I woke up and did some edits for grammar and clarity. Got a little bit of critique and had it in fairly early. I felt like a fucking badass writing this and I still love that I managed to get some personality for this guy with so little in terms of word count. I did Jamcon because my typical article took months, if not years to reach a point I was happy with it. 

It also helps that I adore SCP-871 and I instantly took a shot to write a tale about it the second I had an excuse to do so. There's some wonderful imagery of someone just eating an entire cake by themselves that the article conjures up and I wanted to give that some emotional power behind it. 

I'm not the first person to employ the "character eats a delicious meal after getting revenge and/or justice" trope but I hope that I'm a worthy example of why that trope works so well.

[[collapsible show="+ When I Saw Her"  hide="- More than meets the eye"]]

Jamcon 2020, prompt three.

What a sweet little song I managed to cook up. Yet again, I wrote this in one go really late at night, fell asleep, and then edited in the morning. Then I spent a day gathering my band to get together and record this, old school hippie style by sitting around the microphone and performing it. There was probably a better method of doing that but we didn't have enough time to think about that.

I've been in an out of bands for about a decade and while none of them last, I always ended up as the primary lyricist. Many musicians, in my experience at least, don't like the process of writing lyrics because there's no "right" way to do it like there is with say, playing a solo in the blues scale or creating a standard four chord progression. In that regard, I've built up a method of lyric writing that translates well to tailoring itself around the "rules" of music. That was an easy skill for me to tap into on something as time limited as Jamcon. 

I've always loved making lyrics, so this was a great outlet for that part of me.

I guess I should actually talk about the lyrics themselves. The story is pretty straight forward. Boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, girl is actually a space alien, girl is actually using some sort of shape-changing to hide her true form from boy, girl feels guilty and shameful, boy loves her anyways, boy and girl continue to love each other. 

There's probably a metaphor in there somewhere. 

It could be seen about a man loving a woman with body image issues, but he disagrees and finds her beautiful.

It could be interpreted as someone falling in love with a transwoman who isn't immediately upfront about her situation, but he loves her and that's all that matters to him.

It could be a story of a man falling in love with a woman who has depression and she's afraid of scaring him off, but he knows that she is more than just her failings and that she's just being too hard on herself. 

Or it could just be a song about a  lovely, happy, sexy relationship with an alien. Aliens are hot.
