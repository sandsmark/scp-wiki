After going through a nasty bout of food poisoning, I gathered my courage and turned my suffering into art. 

This is essentially just a long, convoluted poop joke, but I think it's my proudest achievement on this site. A good fit of laughter is a rare and precious thing, so it brings me great joy to hear that so many people experienced one thanks to this article.

Many sci-fi and fantasy creatures feed on the fear of humans. This article explores what would happen if a creature fed on awkward situations.

The Squeedles' speech pattern is based on a silly voice my siblings and I frequently use with each other.

My first SCP! As you may have guessed, this was an experiment in throwing creepiness at the wall in hopes that something would stick. After I authored a few more pages, I changed the ending so that the anomaly's malevolence is more ambiguious. 

The motif of clowns and confetti shows up again in SCP-1921.

Inspired by a nightmare I had where my phalanges outgrew my hands. I don't remember where the idea to add Spongebob into the mix came from, but after it entered my mind, there was no going back.

I'm still surprised that so many people thought it wasn't "a proper MC&D SCP." I mean, think about it: it's the perfect interrogation device. No, it's not //glamorous,// but it's priceless in its functionality. I highly doubt a wealthy mob boss would turn up his nose at it just because it's tacky. MC&D doesn't create anomalies, it acquires and sells them, regardless of how tacky they may be. 

IDK. Your headcanon may vary.

Based on //The Crew of the SS Wintersheimer// by MysteriousWanderer, whose account has sadly been deleted. It was a newbie coldpost that went down the way coldposts usually do, and I wanted to prove that even a "bad" SCP can be saved by simply making it weirder. 

Years later, I discovered that a Russian surrealist artist [[[https://alexandreev.deviantart.com/art/Scp-1861-571929721|made a painting]]] based on this SCP, which was later included as the October entry in an SCP calendar he sold in St. Petersburg. I occasionally brag about this when in the company of fellow super nerds.

MysteriousWanderer still seems to lurk the /r/SCP subreddit occasionally.

My second SCP started out as a pair of anomalous fuzzy dice that caused random effects. Someone on chat informed me that random effects don't usually go over well, so I made the skip a hula girl and changed the effects to connect with different speeds. I'm much happier with it this way. 

The idea came from a conversation with some IRL friends who are also SCP enthusiasts. I was the only one among who had actually published something on the site, and everyone was eager to suggest my next big foray. Ideas ranged from "a potato that eats you" to "a bicycle that makes you Mormon". Eventually, someone suggested a car that spits out its occupants while driving down the highway, which eventually led to the hula girl.

I like to think that Tiff found some old, demonic tome in a bookstore, and used it to curse the hula girl in a jealous rage, completely oblivious to the far-reaching consequences her actions would have.

One of the oldest and most infamous sideshow acts is the [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek_show|geek]]]. In the early days it was limited to biting the heads off chickens to warm the crowd up before the real freaks came out; however, modern geekery primarily consists of swallowing and regurgitating small objects and living creatures. This was the primary inspiration behind Barney—2094, that is—and his anomalous abilities.
 
By the time I got to writing this, the Circus of the Disquieting was already a recognized GOI with a number of highly successful articles under its belt. But as I started looking back over those pieces, I realized that my slow-burn approach to writing Circus articles hadn't adequately conveyed the culture, history, and motivation I'd envisioned for the group. 

Admittedly, SCP-2094 was designed to be a vehicle for exposition on the inner workings of the post-Fuller Circus. It was originally going to end with Manny's appearance, but I grew so attached to Barney in the process of writing his dialogue, I decided to expand the story and give him a happy ending.
