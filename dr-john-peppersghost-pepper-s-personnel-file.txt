__Dr. Pepper's SCP commentary:__

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-1602 - A Shower Curtain" hide="- Access granted."]]

You never forget your first. The image comes from a reddit post I stumbled across one day. As soon as I saw it, I knew that it was going to be my first SCP. I wanted it to seem as authentic as possible, so I edited it in photoshop to make it look like a frame from a security recording. 

Besides the image, the inspiration for this SCP was my own irrational fear of drawn shower curtains. In my own home, I always leave the curtain open, so when I visit other people's houses and I see the curtain drawn, my brain immediately tells me that someone is behind it.

The theme of this SCP is insecurity. Shower curtains are a way of covering up one's indecency, providing security from prying eyes. When a person is alone with the curtain, the darker parts of themselves that they try to hide are physically manifested on the other side. Sometimes people are devoured by their darker, hidden side. Sometimes people let that part of them become their being. And, sometimes, they're able to make peace with themselves and come out cleansed and refreshed. 

This SCP features clowns, fetuses, and skeletons. Can you tell I was trying really hard to write horror?

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-1975 - Vindictive Hula Girl" hide="- Access granted."]] 

Fun fact: this one started out as a pair of anomalous fuzzy dice that caused random effects. I remember someone on chat saying that random effects didn't usually go over very well, so I made the skip a hula girl and changed the effects to connect with different speeds. I'm much happier with it this way. 

The idea came from a conversation I had with some friends of mine who are also SCP enthusiasts. I was the first among my friends to actually publish something on the site, and everyone was eager to suggest my next big foray. Ideas ranged from "a potato that eats you" to "a bicycle that makes you Mormon". Eventually, someone suggested a car that spits out its occupants while driving down the highway, which eventually led to the hula girl.

I like to think that Tiff found some sort of old, demonic tome in a bookstore and, in a jealous rage, used it to curse the hula girl, completely oblivious to the far-reaching consequences her actions would have.

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-1808 - Spongebob Watches" hide="- Access granted."]] 

Inspired by a nightmare I had where my phalanges outgrew my hands. I don't remember where the idea to add Spongebob into the mix came from, but after it entered my mind, I knew there was no going back.

I'm still really surprised that so many people thought it wasn't "a proper MC&D SCP". I mean, think about it: it's the perfect interrogation device. No, it's not //glamorous,// but it's priceless in its functionality. I highly doubt a wealthy mob boss would turn up his nose at it just because it's tacky. MC&D doesn't create anomalies, it acquires and sells them, regardless of how tacky they may be.

A couple of people have expressed interest in contributing to the Circus Of The Disquieting mythos, and there may be more later, so I'm gonna go ahead and use this space to paint a general picture of what the Circus is so we can keep things more or less consistent. Feel free to use this as a guideline/jumping-off point. If you want to do something that contradicts my headcanon, I won't mind in the slightest as long as you can make it awesome. I originally started this whole mess because I was shocked by the site's complete lack of circus/carnival themed skips, so it's nice to see people taking an interest in filling that void.

Picture in your mind a local circus or carnival. Plastic tarps, dusty floors, metal bleachers that are always too hot or too cold. Acne-ridden college kids and highschoolers take the tickets to the rides. Old men in dollar store make-up hobble try to make you laugh. They succeed, but only because you're astounded at how pathetic they are. The midway games are rigged against you, and even if you win by some miracle, the prizes are awful. Snacks are overpriced and taste like garbage. The ringmaster is dressed in a rented tux and speaks into a tinny microphone from the 80s. The acts are mostly comedic theatrical routines, with a gymnast or two sprinkled in, and if you're lucky, a tightrope walker who daringly walks two whole meters off the ground. 

You have that picture clear in your mind? Good. Herman Fuller's Circus Of The Disquieting is nothing like that. 

Herman Fuller's Circus is a romanticized version of the circus in its heyday. Outdoor locations are surrounded by beautifully cut grass, and the interiors of the tents have dirt floors packed so tight that they can be mistaken for rich, brown concrete. The wooden benches in the big-top are ornately carved and provide wonderful back support. Bright-faced young men and women in colorful pinstriped suits greet you at every turn. Clowns run about by the dozen, each one full of lively energy, their faces works of art, and all of them genuinely hilarious. You can win giant stuffed animals from the midway with barely any effort at all. In the evenings, all the acts gather together underneath the bigtop for a show that would make Barnum & Bailey clutch their wallets and sob. The finely-dressed Ringmaster needs no microphone. Every kind of act conceivable takes place right before your eyes, and the inconceivable as well. The constant, real danger throughout keeps you on the edge of your seat. The acrobats have no safety net, and yet they soar through the air without a care in the world while the orchestra plays a sweeping, majestic score. 

Although it is called a Circus, it also has many carnival elements, such as rides and the aforementioned midway games. There are also tents upon tents upon tents filled with interesting people and things to look at. The freak show is another popular pastime for guests, as political correctness has eradicated them from virtually every other circus in the world. There's a tent of curiosities, and a tent of oddities, and a tent of horrors, and everything is so strange and impossible but you're too giddy to question it or call the police. 

The Circus has been around for a long, long time, and it's only gotten bigger through the ages. There are hundreds, possibly thousands of employees and performers who travel from town to town together. But between shows and gigs and performances, the Circus' many members live out their daily lives. They are united on stage once every week or so, but most of the time they just do their own thing. Herman Fuller's Circus isn't an organization, it's a community, a mass of people brought together by a common cause and paid for their efforts. As a whole, the Circus' only objective is to put on a good show, but many of the individual performers have their own agendas and reasons for being there. Not all of them nice. 

Thanks to careful planning by the Ringmaster, they've managed to stay completely under the Foundation's radar. At least until very recently. Now that the Foundation knows the Circus exists, a game of cat and mouse is inevitable. The circus is a group in the truest sense, staying with each other constantly, and if the Foundation ever catches up with them, the tour will be over permanently. The Ringmaster has been trying to cover their tracks, but every now and then things slip through…

So there you have it. As you can see, I've left things pretty open ended. The only topics that are strictly off-limits are cotton candy, calliope music, weight guessing, and the upside-down faced man, all of which I plan to use in future articles. In general, try to keep things as weird as possible. Part of the fun (and terror) of good circuses is they shock you and take you to another world. Popular media has fallen into a rut of hackneyed evil/magic circus tropes, so be as off-the-wall insane and original as you can. 

[[[SCP-1834]]], [[[SCP-1884]]], [[[SCP-1921]]], [[[SCP-1931]]], and [[[Opening Night]]] are the five articles written about the circus so far.
