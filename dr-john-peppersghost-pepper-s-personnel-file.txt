[[collapsible show="+ Dr. Pepper's analysis of //Herman Fuller's Circus Of The Disquieting//" hide="- Hide]]

A couple of people have expressed interest in contributing to the Circus Of The Disquieting mythos, and there may be more later, so I'm gonna go ahead and use this space to paint a general picture of what the Circus is so we can keep things more or less consistent. Feel free to use this as a guideline/jumping-off point. If you want to do something that contradicts my headcanon, I won't mind in the slightest as long as you can make it awesome. I originally started this whole mess because I was shocked by the site's complete lack of circus/carnival themed skips, so it's nice to see people taking an interest in filling that void.

Picture in your mind a local circus or carnival. Plastic tarps, dusty floors, metal bleachers that are always too hot or too cold. Acne-ridden college kids and highschoolers take the tickets to the rides. Old men in dollar store make-up hobble try to make you laugh. They succeed, but only because you're astounded at how pathetic they are. The midway games are rigged against you, and even if you win by some miracle, the prizes are awful. Snacks are overpriced and taste like garbage. The ringmaster is dressed in a rented tux and speaks into a tinny microphone from the 80s. The acts are mostly comedic theatrical routines, with a gymnast or two sprinkled in, and if you're lucky, a tightrope walker who daringly walks two whole meters off the ground. 

You have that picture clear in your mind? Good. Herman Fuller's Circus Of The Disquieting is nothing like that. 

Herman Fuller's Circus is a romanticized version of the circus in its heyday. Outdoor locations are surrounded by beautifully cut grass, and the interiors of the tents have dirt floors packed so tight that they can be mistaken for rich, brown concrete. The wooden benches in the big-top are ornately carved and provide wonderful back support. Bright-faced young men and women in colorful pinstriped suits greet you at every turn. Clowns run about by the dozen, each one full of lively energy, their faces works of art, and all of them genuinely hilarious. You can win giant stuffed animals from the midway with barely any effort at all. In the evenings, all the acts gather together underneath the bigtop for a show that would make Barnum & Bailey clutch their wallets and sob. The finely-dressed Ringmaster needs no microphone. Every kind of act conceivable takes place right before your eyes, and the inconceivable as well. The constant, real danger throughout keeps you on the edge of your seat. The acrobats have no safety net, and yet they soar through the air without a care in the world while the orchestra plays a sweeping, majestic score. 

Although it is called a Circus, it also has many carnival elements, such as rides and the aforementioned midway games. There are also tents upon tents upon tents filled with interesting people and things to look at. The freak show is another popular pastime for guests, as political correctness has eradicated them from virtually every other circus in the world. There's a tent of curiosities, and a tent of oddities, and a tent of horrors, and everything is so strange and impossible but you're too giddy to question it or call the police. 

The Circus has been around for a long, long time, and it's only gotten bigger through the ages. There are hundreds, possibly thousands of employees and performers who travel from town to town together. But between shows and gigs and performances, the Circus' many members live out their daily lives. They are united on stage once every week or so, but most of the time they just do their own thing. Herman Fuller's Circus isn't an organization, it's a community, a mass of people brought together by a common cause and paid for their efforts. As a whole, the Circus' only objective is to put on a good show, but many of the individual performers have their own agendas and reasons for being there. Not all of them nice. 

Thanks to careful planning by the Ringmaster, they've managed to stay completely under the Foundation's radar. At least until very recently. Now that the Foundation knows the Circus exists, a game of cat and mouse is inevitable. The circus is a group in the truest sense, staying with each other constantly, and if the Foundation ever catches up with them, the tour will be over permanently. The Ringmaster has been trying to cover their tracks, but every now and then things slip throughâ€¦

So there you have it. As you can see, I've left things pretty open ended. The only topics that are strictly off-limits are cotton candy, calliope music, weight guessing, and the upside-down faced man, all of which I plan to use in future articles. In general, try to keep things as weird as possible. Part of the fun (and terror) of good circuses is they shock you and take you to another world. Popular media has fallen into a rut of hackneyed evil/magic circus tropes, so be as off-the-wall insane and original as you can. 

[[[SCP-1884]]], [[[SCP-1931]]], and [[[Opening Night]]] are the three articles written about the circus so far.
