@@       @@Once upon a Big egg dreary, while I masticated weary,
Over many a crisp and juicy omelette with a cheesy core—
@@       @@While I clammered, nearly clanging, suddenly there came a banging,
@@       @@Like a person I'd left hanging, hanging at the chamber door.
“’Just some personnel,” I sputtered, “hanging at the chamber door—
@@                @@On the wrong containment floor.”

@@       @@I remember pretty surely, I was up quite bright and early;
Having just assisted someone in MTF Eta-Four.
@@       @@So I'd snuck into the kitchen;—seeking something to enrichen
@@       @@My breakfast before my switch in—to room two seven one four—
For the reading and recording in room two seven one four—
@@                @@Which was on a different floor.

@@       @@And each oval in the carton did its very best to hearten
Me and my hand knitted tartan like I'd never been before;
@@       @@So that in this hour witching, I stood at the table, twitching
@@       @@“’Just some dumbass D-Class bitching cuz he's on an errant floor—
Or a researcher with munchies who is trying to emplore;—
@@                @@That is what it is, for sure.”

@@       @@So I got a little braver; then deciding not to waver,
And I filled my mouth with flavor before heading to the door;
@@       @@"You there, what's your level clearance? Come on, keep with the adherence,
@@       @@Better make your disappearance from this here containment floor,
I can hear you, sneaky guy”— I said, as I unlatched the door;—
@@                @@Empty hall and nothing more.

@@       @@Down the hallway, both directions, I was making quick inspections,
Looking for those insurrections that had happened at the peg;
@@       @@But the door was held and sturdy, not a peg missing of thirty,
@@       @@So I sought the shifty birdie and called past the coffee keg
Making fun of lowly D-Class, “Come to me I humbly beg!”—
@@                @@But no person stretched a leg.

@@       @@So there I retired fuming, to the meal I'd be consuming,
Then there came a second booming at the kitchen's sturdy gate;
@@       @@“Fucker,” said I, “of a mother, why must there now be another;
@@       @@Let me see, then, what this other sound could possibly equate—
I'll be right with you, dear omelette, stay there still upon your plate;—
@@                @@"No one's there!” I cried, irate.

@@       @@So I flung the cabinets open, for some sign of life was hopin',
When I spotted in the corner of my eye something irreg;
@@       @@No, the light was not projecting this image right there erecting;
@@       @@I had happened on a specimen; a small pristine Big egg—
Quietly perched on a platter next to my right-sided leg—
@@                @@Near the coffee in its keg.

@@       @@Then the egg, it started moving to the music, swiftly grooving,
And I thought myself behooving as to keep the Big egg safe 
Lest it fall and crack its shell or on some jagged surface chafe,
@@       @@“Ok sure, you're pretty funny but you,” I said, “might be runny,
@@       @@And your yolk is precious, honey, since your Bigness is so naif—
Tell me of your fowl maker, of your organ guarantor!”
@@                @@Quoth the Big egg “Nevermore.”

@@       @@I was visibly astounded, surely not the egg had sounded,
I was just being unbounded with my cuteness towards the dish;
@@       @@The Big egg was quintessential, bursting egg with Big potential
@@       @@Not the least bit differential, all an eating man could wish—
So I gathered up some spices and set them about the floor,
@@                @@Which the Big egg did deplore. 

@@       @@So it started madly hopping, like a fish so fiercely flopping
With no earthly chance of stopping without triggering a war.
@@       @@But it still was early morning and I'd have to start adjourning—
@@       @@Or my boss would soon be scorning for the duties I ignore—
"When will that damn guy retire so I can be level four.”
@@                @@Quoth the Big egg “Nevermore.”

@@       @@Though my wit was rather glassy I could tell the egg was sassy,
“Okay,” said I, “this here lassy better learn some manners more
@@       @@With an egg as Big as this one, I'd be wrong to say it is one
@@       @@Likely now to make admission of the Bigness at its core—
Though its Egginess revealing, I find eggs to be appealing
@@                @@And its Bigness I adore’.”

@@       @@But the Big egg was so big and was becoming like a brigand
To me, snatch'd up my wig and tossed it gruffly on the floor;
@@       @@However, not to sound perverse, I see that it could have been worse
@@       @@My wig was simply borne of verse, it was poetic metaphor—
To show my utter consternation at the Big egg's short vocation
@@                @@Of the pithy “Nevermore.” 

@@       @@I tried simply ascertaining that which needed more explaining
Was the Big egg's meaning feigning, was it seeking something more?
@@       @@All of this I sat discerning without once my noggin turning
@@       @@Till I thought a thought concerning, where the Big egg would explore;
Glances left and right confirming it was not here anymore;
@@                @@Giving me another chore.

@@       @@Over counters, under tables, past the baskets full of labels
Tangled up in oven cables, it was nowhere to be found
@@       @@“Egg,” I cried, “Oh egg of Big—under every plate I'll dig
@@       @@Until—Until I up your jig and toast you evenly till browned";
A crash, a crack, way in the back, and with a wack, I caught the round 
@@                @@It didn't even make a sound.

@@       @@“Ovum!” said I, “membrane dweller!"—stood I, grabbing the de-sheller—
"I will take you to the cellar and store you among the wine!,
@@       @@You may be Big but I am long, you may be egg but I am strong—
@@       @@And so my life I will prolong by serving you in pickle brine—"
And then the worst thing I have ever witnessed started to arise
@@                @@The egg was Biggening in size.

@@       @@The egg had begun to increase its Bigness whole, not piece by piece
I knew that I would soon decease if I could not impede its motion—
@@       @@And yet, then and there it stopped, my jaw and testicles both dropped,
@@       @@The thing the egg was Bigging swapped, it now was Biggening its notion—
Making everything about it simply egg and only Big.
@@                @@Big egg Big egg Big egg Big

@@       @@Big egg Bigg’d, Big and eggly—egg and Big and egging Begly
Begged the egg “Egg Beg my Geg” he Bigly egged it on some more
@@       @@“I cannot take the egg!” I shouted, “nor incessant Big” I spouted
@@       @@Scampring all around I scouted for some thing to ease my sore
Till I found a cap of mnestics left forgotten on the floor.
@@                @@Quoth me in the moment “Score!”

@@       @@Popped a pill and then I waited, with a breath completely bated
And my headache was elated when there was no egg in store
@@       @@All its Bigness was inverted, nothing was remotely hurted 
@@       @@Just me and a man, no-shirted, who was running out the door;
And I laid alone recalling, joyous to the point of balling
@@                @@The big egg was nevermore.
