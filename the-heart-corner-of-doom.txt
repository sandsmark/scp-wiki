title:The Heart Corner of Doom AKA The Author Page
Hello hello! I am Kara, short for my alias Karakatt! 

Often people wonder why I am like this… But then I remember my uncle dropped me on my head when I was 3! 

Anyway! I’m here, and I exist? I don’t actually know.

You can probably see a lot of my personality seeping into everything I do, but it's really because I have no filter on these things!

Past that, I enjoy art and music, while I personally play piano, bassoon, and trombone I understand minor mechanics on all instruments.. I write music in my free time, though, I’m not anywhere near professional I’d like to think it sounds good at least a little bit.

As for my art, I prefer doing water color and digital art. What's really funny is that I have literally no patience, and yet I picked up the medium of watercolor. If you didn’t already know, working with water is very time consuming and requires a degree of patience I have not yet unlocked. 


++ Arts!!

My Deviant art is fire, and I post pretty much everything I posted on my He-ART Page on there too. [https://www.deviantart.com/karalinekatt My DA is the best fucking thing ever]

I am not violent! Sure, I may get testy but I’m not violent. Not unless I have to be…

Alright. We’re done with quotes.

I am Kathoreian Heart, Ex MTF-Eta-11, and founder of the H.E.A.R.T.S Association. 

I have doctorates in both Music Composition and Music Technology, so I am fairly qualified. At least that's what I tell myself. 

Anyway! If you wanna read my journal I guess you can. It’s over in “The Hearts Strings” Tab.

Then I will break your other limbs individually slowly breaking them off and feeding them to 682 while you, weeping in pain, calling for your mother, crying for help, will be left to bleed slowly in your useless pitiful state. So please unless you want this fate: I am Dr.Heart to you"
