What do Karas do? We’re very unsure.

We know that she enjoys art, music, and occasionally fire. Possibly avian in nature? Though, she has shown signs of being a cat, and a human. Probably a shapeshifter. --Contain at all costs.-- To never be contained.

She had an odd quote she keeps carving into everything. We understand nothing about this weird creature.

//”Capitalism is a lie and so is Communism.”//

She has ruined 40 desks.

Hello Hello!

I’m Kara! 

No, no. Sit down, and shut up. Leaving is illegal, and there will be --appropriate-- lethal force taken to ensure you stay in this room.


So, about me…

I somehow managed to get an author page, so uh, yay!!! I have a [http://www.scp-wiki.net/kara-s-page-of-art cool art page] I guess? Gonna try and break it soon! I write mostly tales here on this wiki. So, I guess if you want those you could scroll down. Maybe? 

In the meantime, I like [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/bird Team Bird] WAY too much and I’ve read everything over like 5 almost 6 times now. Same with Parks and Recreation, but I’ve watched that show about 50 times over and have almost all of the script memorized. Did you know that I also hold a 2nd place speed run time for SCP-022? 

Aside from my bragging, we should get into things ACTUALLY about me. I’m 17 and in band, I play bassoon, piano, and synth. We here in Texas love our football, but I just enjoy marching band. I have made region band 3 times, and honestly if you get me talking about band I may never shut up! 

As you could probably tell I really like doing art. Did I mention my art page yet?!?

“Yeah, like 2 times now.” 

Well, fuck you too then!

“That's it?” 

Don’t like it? Wait a month or five, there might be more! Or not, I don’t know...

Hello hello! I am Kara, short for my alias Karakatt! 

Often people wonder why I am like this… But then I remember my uncle dropped me on my head when I was 3! 

Anyway! I’m here, and I exist? I don’t actually know.

You can probably see a lot of my personality seeping into everything I do, but it's really because I have no filter on these things!

Past that, I enjoy art and music, while I personally play piano, bassoon, and trombone I understand minor mechanics on all instruments.. I write music in my free time, though, I’m not anywhere near professional I’d like to think it sounds good at least a little bit.

As for my art, I prefer doing water color and digital art. What's really funny is that I have literally no patience, and yet I picked up the medium of watercolor. If you didn’t already know, working with water is very time consuming and requires a degree of patience I have not yet unlocked. 


++ Arts!!

My Deviant art is fire, and I post pretty much everything I posted on my art page too. [https://www.deviantart.com/karalinekatt My DA is the best fucking thing ever]

I am not violent! Sure, I may get testy but I’m not violent. Not unless I have to be…

Alright. We’re done with quotes.

I am Kathorien Heart, Ex MTF-Eta-11, and founder of the H.E.A.R.T.S Association. 

I have doctorates in both Music Composition and Music Technology, so I am fairly qualified. At least that's what I tell myself. 

Anyway! If you wanna read my journal I guess you can. It’s over in “The Hearts Strings” Tab.
