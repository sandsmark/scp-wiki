[[span style="font-size: 120%; font-weight: bold; font-family: "Trebuchet MS", Trebuchet, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica; letter-spacing: 1px;"]][[collapsible show="+ The Pennsylvania Dark" hide="- The Pennsylvania Dark"]][[/span]]The village of New Northton, Pennsylvania, does not appear on any maps.Â Â No newspapers, no census, almost no official record exists at all, save for the scant, disquieting information gathered by the Foundation.Â Â A battered almanac, found in a Philadelphia motel.Â Â A sheet of paper, discarded in a library.Â Â There are a half-dozen tenuous links and hesitant hypotheses, but very little is certain.Â Â We do know that people have a way of mysteriously vanishing when they get too nosy around those parts.

We also know a few names -- perhaps pseudonyms.Â Â "New Northton," the name of the town.Â Â "Henry Glattfelder" crops up occasionally, in labyrinthine bank transfers and moldy property records dug out of old filing cabinets.Â Â There are a few civilians who wander out, and they don't have much to say. "//Haernacht//," sometimes.Â Â The Lord of Nocturne, in the dialect of German still spoken in some parts of Pennsylvania.Â Â "//Nachtkarich//," a Church of that same Lord.Â Â "Nix."

We tapped imaging satellites.Â Â There's nothing there.Â Â That's when we took notice.

We sent in spies.Â Â They went dark, and didn't return.Â Â That's when we got scared.

There are only three things we know for sure:

They are not secure.

They are not contained.

And we are not protected.

//Haerrnacht loss komme.//
