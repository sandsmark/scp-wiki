**Item #:** SCP-1144

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1144 currently resides in the fifth storage basement of [DATA EXPUNGED], within a steel foot-locker labelled '█████████'. Handling of SCP-1144 requires clearance from Level 2 or above, while further analysis of SCP-1144 requires clearance from Level 3 or above.

**Description:** SCP-1144 resembles an Orion HR-120 Analytical Balance, a brand of precise weighing scales. Like the HR-120, SCP-114 is a box-like structure, measuring 21.3cm x 32.0cm x 30.2cm, consisting of a base, which presumably houses the electronic components of the device, and a transparent cage. The base itself comprises an LCD display, as well as several buttons for adjusting the scales. [Note: These buttons have no effect on the functioning of SCP-1144, or the results it provides.]
SCP-1144 is permanently active; the display will show no signs of being on until an object is placed upon the scales, at which point, the display will flicker into life, providing a reading for the observer.
It should be noted that the reading SCP-1144 provides is not a measurement of the object’s mass; repeated testing seems to suggest that both mass and weight are entirely irrelevant.  Ongoing testing has yielded no indication of what exact objective quantity SCP-1144 is able to measure, although tenuous patterns have been established. For example, two similar objects will tend to produce similar readings.

SCP-1144 is able to withstand immense pressures and temperatures. It has been shown to function normally at temperatures up to 3500°C and pressures up to 211 MPa, without sustaining any change to its structural integrity.

**Addendum I:** Experimental data log, involving Dr ██████  and Junior Researchers █████ ██████ and ██████ ████.
This log documents the findings of the preliminary research team, two days following the retrieval of SCP-1144 from [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Addendum II:** Experimental data log, involving Dr ██████ and Senior Researcher ████ █████.
It was postulated by Senior Researcher █████ that the transparent cage could be removed. With approval from Dr ██████, the cage was disassembled with relative ease, and the components were placed in a large brown envelope, to be labeled SCP-1144-1. SCP-1144-1 is to be kept within two feet of SCP-1144 at all times. SCP-1144-1 does not appear to have any extraordinary properties, other than exceptional strength and durability. However, it remains to undergo further investigation.
With SCP-1144-1 removed, SCP-1144 continued to function as before, albeit without the constraint of the shielding, allowing much larger objects to be measured. This log documents the findings of the secondary research team, two months after the initial observations.

**Addendum III:** Experimental data log, involving Dr ██████, Senior Researcher ████ █████ and Junior Researcher █████ ███████. Four D-Class personal were kept at hand, under supervision from armed personnel.
Following the second round of testing. Dr ██████ put in a request to have several SCP specimens from various [DATA EXPUNGED] to be brought in for measurement with SCP-1144. His request was reviewed and accepted; this log documents the observations of the tertiary research team.
[Note: Many Euclid specimens were transferred from their holding cells and contained within tungsten superalloy crates during the procedure. Dr ██████ was aware that
