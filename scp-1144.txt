**Item #:** SCP-1144

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1144 currently resides in the fifth storage basement of [DATA EXPUNGED], within a steel foot-locker labelled '█████████'. Handling of SCP-1144 requires clearance from Level 2 or above, while further analysis of SCP-1144 requires clearance from Level 3 or above. Currently, both SCP-1144 and SCP-1144-1 have been scheduled for transfer on ██████████ to [DATA EXPUNGED] in order to receive thorough review and analysis.

**Description:** SCP-1144 resembles an Orion HR-120 Analytical Balance, a common brand of precise weighing scales. Like the HR-120, SCP-114 is a box-like structure, measuring 21.3cm x 32.0cm x 30.2cm, consisting of a base, which presumably houses the electronic components of the device, and a transparent cage. The base itself comprises an LCD display, as well as several buttons for adjusting the scales. [Note: These buttons have no effect on the functioning of SCP-1144, or the results it provides.]
SCP-1144 is permanently active; the display will show no signs of being on until an object is placed upon the scales, at which point, the display will flicker into life, providing a reading for the observer.
It should be noted that the reading SCP-1144 provides is not a measurement of the object’s mass; repeated testing seems to suggest that both mass and weight are entirely irrelevant.  Ongoing testing has yielded no indication of what exact objective quantity SCP-1144 is able to measure, although tenuous patterns have been established. For example, two similar objects will tend to produce similar readings, and [DATA EXPUNGED]. Under ‘normal’ conditions, SCP-1144 provides its data to 3 decimal places.

SCP-1144 is able to withstand immense pressures and temperatures. It has been shown to function normally at temperatures up to 3500°C and pressures up to 211 MPa, without sustaining any change to its structural integrity.
During initial testing, each object was ‘weighed’ three times, and each time the exact same readings were produced. This was taken to be evidence that SCP-1144 is in fact weighing a particular quantity, which varies in magnitude amongst a given set of objects. During secondary and tertiary testing, each object was only weighed once.

**Addendum I:** Experimental data log, involving Dr ██████  and Junior Researchers █████ ██████ and ██████ ████.
This log documents the findings of the preliminary research team, two days following the retrieval of SCP-1144 from [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Addendum II:** Experimental data log, involving Dr ██████ and Senior Researcher ████ █████.
It was postulated by Senior Researcher █████ that the transparent cage could be removed. With approval from Dr ██████, the cage was disassembled with relative ease, and the components were placed in a large brown envelope, to be labeled SCP-1144-1. SCP-1144-1 is to be kept within two feet of SCP-1144 at all times. SCP-1144-1 does not appear to have any extraordinary properties, other than exceptional strength and durability. However, it remains to undergo further investigation.
With SCP-1144-1 removed, SCP-1144 continued to function as before, albeit without the constraint of the shielding, allowing much larger objects to be measured. This log documents the findings of the secondary research team, two months after the initial observations.

**Addendum III:** Experimental data log, involving Dr ██████, Senior Researcher ████ █████ and Junior Researcher █████ ███████. Four D-Class personal were kept at hand, under supervision from armed personnel.
Following the second round of testing. Dr ██████ put in a request to have several SCP specimens from various [DATA EXPUNGED] to be brought in for measurement with SCP-1144. His request was reviewed and accepted; this log documents the observations of the tertiary research team.
[Note: In most of the cases, SCP-1144 was brought to the holding cell of the Euclid or Keter specimen, and the containment cell was carefully balanced upon SCP-1144. In the case of a fixed holding cell, the specimens were transferred into tungsten superalloy crates and placed upon SCP-1144. Specimens were managed according to their specific containment procedures.]

**Object:** SCP-1144-1
**Reading:** (The screen remained blank.)

**Object:** SCP-173
**Reading:** ERROR

**Object:** SCP-058
**Reading:** ERROR

**Object:** SCP-426
**Reading:** (The screen remained blank.)

**Object:** SCP-106  
**Reading:** (The reading fluctuated unpredictably. The lowest value observed was 0.001, and the highest was 80901.099. Several electronic artefacts were also observed, such as non-standard glyphs. Occasionally, letters would be visible on the display, but rarely formed intelligible words. The only two examples were the words 'NEVER' and 'LIKE'. It is unknown whether these words formed as a result of random or pseudorandom patterns, or were intentionally displayed by SCP-106, SCP-1144, or an unknown third party.

**Addendum IV:** Letter from Senior Lab Technician ████ █████████ to Dr ██████. On █████████, Dr ██████ sent out a request for atomic analysis of SCP-1144-1, citing that the structure of SCP-1144-1 could be disrupted to whatever extent was necessary.

//Dear Dr ██████//

//See attached for full, detailed lab report. My team and I found that 20 kW was the minimum power of a laser needed to cut through SCP-1144. We removed a 5mm x 5mm square section of the frontal transparent pane. We then removed four transerve sections for analysis with X-ray crystallography, each weighing approximately 85 ng, using the remaining material in a mass spectrometry procedure.
Results from the mass spectrometer indicate that the material is composed of 25% carbon-12, 13% nitrogen-14, 10% hydrogen-1, 5% selenium-79 and 3% phosphorus-31. Non-organic composition included 20% iridium-192, 20% molybdenum-96 and 4% platinum-195. The results of the X-ray crystallography indicate that SCP-1144-1 comprises both polypeptide chains and metallic lattice sheets. The high presence of selenium atoms in the organic molecules is most interesting. I would recommend further investigation with [DATA EXPUNGED] into the use of SCP-1144-1 as the starting-point for a new branch of molecular technology.//
//Yours sincerely,//
