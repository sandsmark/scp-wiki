**Item #:** SCP-1144

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1144 currently resides in a 

**Description:** SCP-1144 resembles an Orion HR-120 Analytical Balance, a brand of precise weighing scales. Like the HR-120, SCP-114 is a box-like structure, measuring 8.4” x 12.6” x 11.9”, consisting of a base, which presumably houses the electronic components of the device, and a transparent polymer cage. The base itself comprises an LCD display, as well as several buttons for adjusting the scales. [Note: These buttons have no effect on the functioning of SCP-1144, or the results it provides.]
SCP-1144 is permanently active; the display will show no signs of being on until an object is placed upon the scales, at which point, the display will flicker into life, providing a reading for the observer.
It should be noted that the reading SCP-1144 provides is not a measurement of the object’s mass; repeated testing seems to suggest that both mass and weight are entirely irrelevant.  Ongoing testing has yielded no indication of what exact objective quantity SCP-1144 is able to measure, although tenuous patterns have been established. For example, two similar objects tend to produce similar readings. However, when [DATA EXPUNGED].
SCP-1144 is able to withstand immense pressures and temperatures. It has been shown to function normally at temperatures up to 3500°C and pressures up to 211 MPa, without sustaining any change to its structural integrity.

**Addendum I:** Experimental data log, involving Dr ██████  and Junior Researchers █████ ██████ and ██████ ████.
This log documents the findings of the preliminary research team, two days following the retrieval of SCP-1144 from [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Addendum II:** Experimental data log, involving Dr ██████ and Senior Researcher ████ █████.
It was postulated by Senior Researcher ██████ that the transparent cage could be removed. With approval from Dr ██████, the cage was disassembled using a screwdriver, and the components were placed in a large brown envelope, to be labeled SCP-1144-1. SCP-1144-1 is to be kept in the same room as SCP-1144 at all times. SCP-1144-1 does not appear to have any extraordinary properties, other than exceptional strength and durability. However, it remains to undergo further investigation.
With SCP-1144-1 removed, SCP-1144 continued to function as before, albeit without the constraint of the polymer cage. This log documents the findings of the secondary research team, two months after the initial observations.
