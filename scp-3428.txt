**Item #:** SCP-3428

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Reports regarding the discovery of SCP-3428 are to be investigated immediately, and the instance is to be secured as soon as possible. Should it activate before being properly secured, Mobile Task Force Alpha-21 ("DDT Did Nothing Wrong") is to be sent in to subdue and capture the instance. Class-A amnestics are to be administered to all witnesses.

SCP-3428 instances in custody are to be submerged in soil unless needed for experimentation. Testing involving SCP-3428 requires Site Director approval, and must be submitted six (6) days in advance.

**Description:** SCP-3428 are crude statues of hummingbirds with wingspans no larger than 5 meters. "CtM" is engraved upon the underside of each instance. Individual instances differ slightly in make with one another, although most instances are typically composed of scrap metal and polyester. SCP-3428 are typically found around .5 to 1.5 m underground, either in archaeological dig sites or urban construction areas. While buried underneath at least .5 m of soil, SCP-3428 remains inert.

Approximately five (5) to ten (10) days after being unearthed, SCP-3428 will spontaneously animate. Behavior varies between instances, although most have shown destructive tendencies upon animating. Instances of SCP-3428 will generally only cause damage if the act of doing so is clearly visible. It is rare for instances of SCP-3428 to outright attack humans.

Although SCP-3428's crude physiology renders them unable to feed, instances have been observed attempting to scavenge for food and drink, much of which lies outside the typical trochilidae diet.

**Addendum:** SCP-3428 instances of note are listed here:

|| SCP-3428-46 || 12/8/2005 || Site 56 || SCP-3428-46 dug itself out of the ground and proceeded towards Site 56's front entrance. Its attempts to force itself through ended when the automatic security system decapitated it. || SCP-3428-46 is the first instance to unearth itself without observed human assistance. In addition, SCP-3428-46's insides housed a nest of wasps, which proceeded to fly out after SCP-3428-46's destruction and unsuccessfully attack a soft drink vending machine. ||

Chill out with a █████.". An investigation of █████Co is underway. ||
