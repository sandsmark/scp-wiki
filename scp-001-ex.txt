**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-001 is to remain in a TEMPEST-certified[[footnote]]TEMPEST is a NATO certification for emission security (EMSEC) indicating that equipment and/or structures are insulated from 'leakage' of data via electromagnetic or acoustic emissions.[[/footnote]] chamber at Site-5. Four or more IntSCPFN[[footnote]]The International SCP Foundation Network is a global network intended to provide synchronized information regarding Foundation containment procedures across all sites, areas, and countries.[[/footnote]] technicians are to be available on-site to provide technical support and perform daily maintenance on all wireless transmission components connected to SCP-001. All major Foundation areas, sites, and administration buildings are to maintain a minimum of two teleprinters connected to the IntSCPFN network for the dissemination of emergency bulletins and/or instructions regarding the prevention of containment breaches. Under no circumstances is SCP-001 to be deactivated or otherwise disconnected from IntSCPFN servers.

Predictive anomaly reports produced by SCP-001 are to be forwarded to RAISA for analysis and review. A Level-4 RAISA officer is to be assigned to each report; this officer is to be responsible for evaluating the immediate threat presented by the predicted anomaly, producing a credible cover story to explain its discovery by the Foundation, and assigning a Containment Director[[footnote]]Containment Directors are part of the Containment Command System (CCS); a chain-of-command model for first contact with an anomaly. It was established in 1945 as a structured hierarchy for multiple agencies (both internal and external to the Foundation) to coordinate the safe recovery and containment of an anomaly.[[/footnote]] to investigate, devise, and execute a containment strategy. All containment procedures suggested or produced by SCP-001 must receive approval from the majority of the O5 council.

**Description:** SCP-001 is the ERZATZ Type AK9 Computational Engine[[footnote]]The ERZATZ Type AK9 Computation Engine is a digital, general-purpose computer with Turing-complete specifications.[[/footnote]] constructed by the Foundation in 1955. It was built to provide predictive analysis regarding the location and properties of undiscovered anomalies. It accomplishes this via use of a multi-layer perceptron[[footnote]]A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is a 'feed-forward' computation system consisting of three or more layers of nodes: an input (or 'top') layer, one or more hidden (or 'middle') layers, and an output (or 'bottom') layer. The nodes of each layer are connected to all nodes on the layer below via directed edges. The perceptron accepts a value in its input layer, then directs and transforms this value as it traverses each successive layer until it produces an output.[[/footnote]] relying upon training datasets derived from the location and properties of previous anomalies. This application of a multi-layer perceptron as an effective predictive model was only made possible by an advanced backpropagation algorithm developed by several ex-employees of Prometheus Labs (acquired by the Foundation's Department of Analytics in 1951). 

In 1959, it was hypothesized that SCP-001 could be used to assist in augmenting containment procedures for Euclid- and Keter-class anomalies via the production of predictive text. SCP-001 was trained with a dataset containing drafts for several thousand containment procedures (both previous and current iterations), which were weighted on the basis of their performance (particularly in how well they performed in comparison to their predecessors). When adopted, revisions to containment procedures "suggested" by SCP-001 consistently reduce the rate of breaches not only for the anomalies to which they apply, but for numerous unrelated anomalies. In many cases, these revisions have also resulted in the cessation of anomalous behavior.
