**Item #:** SCP-166

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-166 is mainly peaceful, and can be kept safely in a minimal security environment. At the moment, SCP-166 is housed in a standard Class B suite. Any requested alterations to the room are to be effected no later than three shift rotations following receipt and approval of requests.

To date, SCP-166 has requested:

* A copy of the Holy Bible, King James Version, with Apocrypha (granted).

* A Catholic rosary (granted).

* Access to a Catholic priest for confession, mass, and other sacraments (denied).

* Various books and magazines, mostly religious in nature (granted, pending review and approval of contents).

* A telephone with which to contact the Abbess of the ████████ ██ ████████ ██████████ Convent in Cornwall, England (granted: SCP-166 is to be allowed 1 hour of telephone time a week to this phone number only).

SCP-166 is generally content to remain in her quarters, as long as she is provided with entertainment in the form of religious materials, books, television, and art supplies. On occasion, she will express a desire for some time spent outdoors: Limited Release Protocol 19-A is to be observed in these cases, with the added restriction that no male personnel are to be allowed within 500 m of SCP-166 during transport, and no male personnel are to be allowed on the island during her stay. SCP-166 is authorized to have 24 hours outside her containment facilities every thirty days with O5-level approval.

SCP-166 normally prefers not to wear clothing, but will do so if asked. As even the lightest clothing tends to cause pressure ulcers (bedsores) within 45 minutes of constant wear, SCP-166 is allowed to go nude for medical purposes. In addition, all bedsheets and linens are to be made of 100% extra-long staple cotton with a thread count of at least 200, changed daily. SCP-166 prefers to do this herself, as long as fresh linens are provided every morning.

Male staff are forbidden from viewing or entering the direct vicinity of SCP-166. Violation of this order will result in immediate disciplinary review and possible termination. At least one female staff member must remain in adjacent observation room at all times, and maintain direct visual observation of SCP-166 through viewing slits or remote camera. In order to minimize the risk of accidental exposure, all cameras and windows shall be equipped with translucent filters with at least 50% exclusion of detail. No permanent record shall be kept of any photographic evidence of SCP-166's appearance.

SCP-166 requires no sustenance save approximately 1 cc of fresh human semen daily, administered orally, to be procured by on-base staff as needed. It is believed that she would normally obtain her nutrition using her abilities over human males. //Addendum: Please have a little respect, guys. Anyone else caught making jokes about "feeding 166" is gonna get a short stint as [[[SCP-682]]]'s personal trainer. - Dr. Elizabeth Rossiter//

**Description:** SCP-166 appears as a female human, around 16-18 years of age, of average height and slender build, described by female personnel as "cute, but nothing special." Aside from the fact that her hair grows at an advanced rate (approximately 15 cm [6 in] per month), she is otherwise in perfect health. She is, however, particularly vulnerable to airborne particulate matter such as cigarette smoke and aerosols, which can induce symptoms similar to an acute asthma attack.

SCP-166 is noted for her unusual effect upon human males: upon catching sight of her, 100% of male test subjects became enamoured of her and attempted immediate sexual contact, regardless of their normal sexual orientation. In 70% of these test subjects, the impulse faded after being removed from SCP-166's presence. In 30% of these cases, however, the desire turned into dangerous obsession, resulting in violent attempts to gain access to SCP-166, requiring termination. In addition, affected males report a sensation similar to that of a hypnotic trance, in which they became extremely susceptible to suggestions made by SCP-166.

SCP-166's effect on males causes her no small amount of distress, not least due to her desire to follow a monastic life based on the principles of chastity, poverty, and obedience. For this reason and others, contact between her and any human male is strictly prohibited.

**Addendum 166-A: Circumstances of Retrieval:** SCP-166 was originally retrieved from a convent in Cornwall, England, on ██-██-████. According to the nuns, she had originally been delivered to the convent by a young woman of indistinguishable features who claimed that she was the offspring of an elder creature of great power. All attempts to locate the mother have been unsuccessful to date. //(ADDENDUM: On ██-██-████, Foundation Staff// [**DATA REDACTED. ALL FURTHER INFORMATION RE: THIS SUBJECT TO BE SEALED BY O5-LEVEL ORDER**]). 

SCP-166 was raised by the nuns in a cloistered environment (her special nutritive needs provided by a local priest) until a young man (Subject A) who sneaked into the convent to visit one of the novices accidentally caught sight of her. Three days later, Subject A became violent and attacked the convent, attempting to gain access to SCP-166 for sexual purposes. Subject A proceeded to kill one nun and severely injure three others before being neutralized by force. 

An SCP operative consulting with a local priest heard of the incident and proceeded to the scene. When he too became enamoured, the operative immediately cut off contact, placed himself into confinement, and requested a female Operative from Command to take over the retrieval operation. Agent Beatrice Maddox made contact with the Mother Abbess shortly afterward, negotiating the transfer of SCP-166 to Foundation facilities for containment and research.

**Addendum 166-B: Unauthorized Male Contact:** 

On ██-██-████, an observer noticed a second individual sitting in SCP-166's containment cell and declared a containment breach alert. Female security officers responding to the scene discovered [[[drclef-member-page|Dr. "Alto Clef"]]] sitting across from her in a steel folding chair, with SCP-166 wearing Dr. Clef's lab coat. The two appeared to be chatting amicably, without incident, and Dr. Clef made no attempts to establish sexual contact (confirmed by later medical examination). Dr. Clef was unresponsive as to his reasons for making contact with SCP-166 (see personnel file), while SCP-166 reported that she and Dr. Clef had a "nice conversation about her mother," but could not recall details. Dr. Clef was severely reprimanded for this breach of protocol, but as no further effects were detected, has been allowed to return to active duty.

**Addendum 166-C:** //Based on [[[incident-239-b-clef-kondraki|Dr. Clef's actions at Site-17]]], his little visit with SCP-166 might not have been as innocuous as we thought. Request further investigation.// 

//-O5-11//

**Note:** //SCP-166 has been acting strangely of late. She hasn't been sleeping and her apparent requirement of nutrition has seemingly increased. Most recent examination shows a height increase of 10 cm (4 in) in only six months.  Request a thorough physical examination.// Containment Officer Devereux.

**Note:** //SCP-166 has experienced a growth spurt, Catherine, nothing more sinister I assure you. Her vitals are all stable. Increased requirement of semen has been noted and will be supplied.// Dr Frost.  

**Note:** //Addendum: SCP-166 broke a security officer's arm today as her room was cleaned. Her strength has noticeably increased in the last few months. Insist Dr Frost makes a more in-depth investigation in her physical growth. Four personnel were required to subdue her. Request additional personnel assigned to my level. Females, of course.// Containment Officer Devereux.
