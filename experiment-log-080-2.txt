> 
> //Dr. █████//: D-080-1, do you see anything?
> 
> //D-080-1//: No. It’s pitch black in here.
> 
> //(Subject is silent for several minutes)//
> 
> //D-080-1//: Did you just let something in here? It feels like something’s watching me.
> 
> //Dr. █████//: No, D-080-1. We did not let anything into the room.
> 
> //D-080-1//: What the fuck is that? //(D-080-1 is seen tripping and falling to the floor.)//
> 
> //Dr. █████//: What do you see?
> 
> //D-080-1//: This giant blackness, like someone just standing in the corner. Oh God, it’s looking right at me! Let me out! //(D-080-1 proceeds to pound on the door leading into the antechamber.)//
> 
> //Dr. █████//: It’s looking at you? Please describe it’s physical appearance.
> 
> //D-080-1//: I don’t know! Oh God, let me out. I don’t want to be in here. //(D-080-1 starts whimpering.)//
> 
> //Dr. █████//: Tell me what it looks like D-080-1. Then we can let you out.
> 
> //D-080-1//: It- it looks like a figure, hunched in the corner.
> 
> //Dr. █████//: Is it a human?
> 
> //D-080-1//: It’s too big to be human. //(D-080-1 yawns.)// It’s still looking at me, Doc, still staring.
> 
> //Dr. █████//: Move closer to it.
> 
> //(D-080-1 proceeds to move to the corner of the room, obviously experiencing difficulty staying on his feet.)//
> 
> //D-080-1//: Its eyes look like vapour, just staring at me. Like it wants me to do someth- //(D-080-1 falls to the floor again.)//
> 
> Dr. █████: D-080-1 can you hear me?
> 
> //(Subject is unresponsive for the next 5 minutes)//

//Subject presumably collapsed. Subsequently no remains of D-080-1 were found and it is assumed SCP-080 consumed D-080-1.//


**Experiment 080-2-B:**

**Date:** ██-██-20██
**Subject:** D-080-2, Female, 30 years old
**Procedure:** Subject was sent into room with SCP-080, with intent to physically interact with SCP-080.

> 
> //D-080-2//: I feel drowsy... did you slip me something, or what?
> 
> //Dr. █████//: Reach out and touch it. Tell me what you feel.
> 
> //D-080-2//: You want me to touch that thing?
> 
> //Dr. █████//: Yes, please proceed.
> 
> //(After a few minutes of argument, it is presumed that D-080-2 proceeds to touch SCP-080, at this time the subject becomes unresponsive.)//
> 
> **<End Log, [18:12]>**

//Subject was found asleep in the corner of SCP-080’s containment room, subject appeared to suffer no physical harm during experiment.  Subject was interviewed after medical staff deemed D-080-2 to be in good physical health. (See Attached Interview Log 080-1).//

**Experiment 080-3-C:**

**Date:** ██-██-20██
**Subject:** D-080-3, Male, 24 years old
**Procedure:** Subject was sent into room with SCP-080, having been given a powerful amphetamine.

//Upon entering the room, subject was advised to tell researchers what he saw.  Subject describes a shadow-like figure in the center of the room.  Subject was informed to stand still and inform researchers of any changes.  Ten minutes into the experiment, subject began yawning and became noticeably frightened.  Subject became uncooperative and attempted to escape the containment room.  Upon failing to escape, subject announced an intent to harm SCP-080, and presumably attempted to attack it.  Upon doing so, subject immediately collapsed.//

//D-080-3’s body was recovered from SCP-080’s containment room soon afterwards, having apparently suffered a major heart attack.  Upon collecting D-080-3’s body, researchers described an intense feeling of unease, a feeling of being watched, as well as a more acute awareness of SCP-080’s presence in the room.//

>
