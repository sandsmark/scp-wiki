**Item #:** SCP-4441

**Object Class:** Keter

**Threat Level:**  [[span style="color:red"]]●[[/span]] Red

**Special Containment Procedures:** As of September 2018, SCP-4441-1 is uncontained. MTF-Epsilon 6 (”Village Idiots”) is currently deployed in rural areas of New York state to track SCP-4441-1 and retrieve any discovered instances of SCP-4441-2. Civilians who retain information regarding the Foundation, other GOI’s or any anomalous activity through SCP-4441-2 must be apprehended and amnesticized.

Falsified rumors about aggressive bears in the areas which SCP-4441-2 are found have been spread in order to mitigate the chance that civilians encounter them. In addition, a cover story of an ARG [[footnote]]Augmented Reality Game, in this case a form of collaborative competition which is supplemented or enhanced by virtual content.[[/footnote]] has been established in the event that a civilian encounters an SCP-4441-2 instance.

Foundation activity in the State of New York will continue as before until further notice. The Foundation is to expend all available antimemetics-suppressing technology to protect Foundation-owned locations in the State of New York.

**Description:** SCP-4441 is the designation for anomalous activity in the state of New York orchestrated by an uncontained entity hereafter referred to as SCP-4441-1. No reliable physical description of SCP-4441-1 exists. However, through SCP-4441-2 the Foundation has inferred that SCP-4441-1 is likely a hostile antimemetic entity.

SCP-4441-2 are non-anomalous documents relating to SCP-4441-1 and its activity in the state of New York. SCP-4441-2 are found exclusively in rural areas of New York State, most commonly in the counties of Hamilton, Herkimer and Saint Lawrence. Most appear to be written by Foundation personnel.

Every instance recovered so far has been an A4 size paper printed in standard black ink and placed onto a tree using double-sided tape. The paper has proven to be weather-resistant and will not detach from the trees they were placed on unless handled by humans. No traces of fingerprints or DNA has been found from any instance of SCP-4441-2.

The integrity of SCP-4441-2 is questionable, as all personnel and Foundation sites mentioned in SCP-4441-2 conflict with archival information. These discrepancies could however be the result of SCP-4441-1's antimemetic properties.

SCP-4441 is believed to be either the result of selective interdimensional travel of documents, or a massive antimemetic attack on both civilian and Foundation activity by SCP-4441-1. Due to the non-trivial possibility of the latter, containment of SCP-4441-1 is currently the foremost immediate goal of the Foundation in the Eastern United States.

**Addendum SCP-4441-Alpha:**

Below is an abridged collection of SCP-4441-2 instances retrieved by various Foundation personnel between 6/6/2018 and 9/27/2018. Of note is that SCP-4441-1 is designated as SCP-6762 in all instances of SCP-4441-2.

> **Description:** SCP-6762 is a humanoid entity. SCP-6762 projects an antimemetic aura with a radius of about ten meters, outside of which its influence and actions are impossible to observe directly. The only reliable method of gaining information about the entity is for a human being to enter this ten meter radius, observe the entity and exit the radius successfully.
>
> While within this perceptive radius, personnel report that SCP-6762 is approximately 2.5 meters tall and has a humanoid physical appearance with various abnormalities. This includes:
> * A dark purple skin pigment.
> * Four pairs of cervine antlers protruding from its back.
> * An as-of-yet unidentified glyph replacing all facial features except the mouth.
> * Elongated arms with tertiary joints between the elbow and the wrist.
> * Total syndactyly – all of the entity’s fingers are fused into a single agglomeration, including those on different hands. This leads to the arms of SCP-6726 to be fused together at the knuckles.
> * Capability of locomotion at a supersonic velocity through unknown means.^^[[span style="color:red"]]1[[/span]]^^ [[footnote]]The original documentation had a footnote here, but this has obviously not persisted in the physical document[[/footnote]]
>
> SCP-6762 preys on humans. It typically relies on its antimemetic aura to ambush people settled in remote locations and assault them by means of blunt trauma before consuming the brain matter and spinal fluid of its victims. SCP-6762 has also been observed to attack expired individuals who do not exhibit signs of immediate physical damage.

As informed to me by the on-site emergency announcements, Site 68 contains six Keter-class objects, one of which, SCP-████[[footnote]]A designation that has not been used by the Foundation at any point in time[[/footnote]], will breach containment within the next twenty hours if left unattended.

> I, Harry Forrester, a containment specialist on off-site duties visiting Site 68, was called to improve upon the containment of a presumed-to-be escaped entity known as SCP-6762. As I entered the containment chamber along with other two of my colleagues, I was however able to see the purportedly dangerous entity within. Due to my exceptionally high CRV[[footnote]]Stands for Cognitive Resistance Value, a measure of a person's natural capability to resist the influence of cognitohazards, memetics and antimemes[[/footnote]] I was the only person in the group to recognize its existence. I realized that this was a clear breach of conduct and fled the chamber, regrettably allowing the monster to bludgeon my oblivious colleagues and escape in the process.
>
> Upon further review of SCP-6762’s description, I came to the conclusion that this entity possesses more than just antimemetic properties. All of its written descriptions are inconsistent. Some have described it as a tall purple humanoid with conjoined arms and deer-like antlers on its back, while others proclaim that it has purple skin, eight cervine antlers growing from its spine and arms that are joined together at the hands.
>
> It became readily apparent to me that no two humans are able to perceive SCP-6762 as having the same appearance. In addition, all humans without a sufficiently high CRV will perceive descriptions of SCP-6762 as correlating with their own perception. Needless to say, there’s no guarantee that my own interpretation of a large purple creature with spiny back spikes and triple-jointed front limbs is any more accurate.

**Addendum SCP-4441-Beta:**

[[collapsible show="+ Click here to view the current documentation of SCP-4441." hide="- hide current documentation of SCP-4441."]]
**Item #:** SCP-4441

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Threat Level:** [[span style="color:green"]]●[[/span]] Green

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4441-1 is to be held in a standard Euclid-level containment chamber. It is to be fed 500 grams of uncooked freshwater fish per week. In addition, SCP-4441-1 is to be provided with bedding material consisting of 20 kilograms of dried leaves and grass. This material is to be replenished every six months, or if previous material has been spent.

Remaining instances of SCP-4441-2 are to be recovered and destroyed, and all civilians who have witnessed them are to be amnesticized. A cover story of an ARG is prepared in case information control becomes unfeasible.

The enclosure must be cleaned bi-weekly. During this, instances of SCP-4441-2 accumulated in SCP-4441-1’s containment chamber are to be collected and incinerated.

**Description:** SCP-4441 is the designation for an entity hereafter referred to as SCP-4441-1 and anomalously produced documentation hereafter referred to as SCP-4441-2.

SCP-4441-1 is a 128 cm tall bipedal mammalian entity with brown fur marked by black spots. It has two fingers on each hand, a short hairy tail and a 10 cm long flexible appendage on its forehead of indeterminable purpose. Its abdomen has a rigid slot akin to a standard A4 size printer.

In its natural habitat of the forests of New York state, SCP-4441-1 is nocturnal and sleeps curled up in bushes and leaf piles during the day, camouflaged by its fur. SCP-4441-1 persists on a diet consisting entirely of fish, which it typically catches itself. In nature, SCP-4441 will wander aimlessly and occasionally produce an instance of SCP-4441-2 from the slot in its abdomen before placing it onto a tree. SCP-4441-1 shows minor aversion towards human contact, but is otherwise docile.

SCP-4441-2 are documents produced by SCP-4441-1. All instances of SCP-4441-2 found so far are A4 size and contain four slips of double-sided tape on one side. The paper has proven to be weather-resistant and will not detatch from the trees they were placed on unless handled by humans.

SCP-4441-2 instances are invariably fictional, but are mostly internally consistent and contain in-depth knowledge about the Foundation’s internal matters. It is currently unknown whether SCP-4441-1 itself is responsible for gathering this information, as the entity has not displayed any signs of sapience besides producing SCP-4441-2 instances.

While SCP-4441-1 itself is harmless, SCP-4441-2 commonly contain sensitive information about the Foundation’s operations. Thus, full containment mandates an indoors enclosure, and routinely disposing of SCP-4441-2 instances.

**Discovery:** SCP-4441 was originally the joint designation for the undiscovered phenomenon responsible for producing SCP-4441-2 instances, SCP-4441-2 themselves, as well as the non-existent entity referred to as SCP-6762. As the found SCP-4441-2 documents presented both an informational and existential hazard for the Foundation, a large-scale operation to recapture ‘SCP-6762’ was launched during the summer of 2018.

SCP-4441-1 was discovered on the fourth of October in Beaver Creek State Forest by two agents of MTF Epsilon-6 searching for SCP-6762. The entity was originally mistaken for an unrelated anomaly, before producing an SCP-4441-2 instance. After containment was established and SCP-4441 was recognized as the source of SCP-4441-2, operations to capture SCP-6762 were halted.
