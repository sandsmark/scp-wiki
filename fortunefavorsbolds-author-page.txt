**Name:** Garrett ███████

**User Account:** FortuneFavorsBold.

**Age:** 27 of your Earth years

**Occupation:** Office Unit

**History:** Garrett ███████ is totally not a sentient robot from outer space intent to enslave your pathetic little planet and work you insignificant ape-like beings to extinction in his unquenchable lust for strength and power. He would never travel 40 light years to suck your precious planet “Dirt” of its metals, water, fissile material, or other valuable commodities. Accusing Garrett ███████ of any of these foul blasphemies against what he's sure are a very 'proud' people here on planet what-you-call will absolutely not be grounds for summary disintegration and a full history-wipe of your presence. It would be silly to tell you not to be alarmed while in the presence of Garrett ███████, as he is perfectly normal in every way. Garrett ███████ would like to be your human friend instead. Please inform Garrett ███████ if you would like to participate in friendly human activities, and what exactly those are.
