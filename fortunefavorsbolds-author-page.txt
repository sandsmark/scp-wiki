**Name:** Cassidy ███████

**User Account:** FortuneFavorsBold

**Age:** 33 of your Earth years

**Occupation:** Office Unit

**History:** FortuneFavorsBold is totally not a sentient robot from outer space intent to enslave your pathetic little planet and work you insignificant ape-like beings to extinction in her unquenchable lust for strength and power. She would never travel 40 light years to suck your precious planet “Dirt” of its metals, water, fissile material, or other valuable commodities. Accusing FortuneFavorsBold of any of these foul blasphemies against what she's sure are a very 'proud' people here on planet what-you-call will absolutely not be grounds for summary disintegration and a full history-wipe of your presence. It would be silly to tell you not to be alarmed while in the presence of FortuneFavorsBold, as she is perfectly normal in every way. FortuneFavorsBold would like to be your human friend instead. Please inform FortuneFavorsBold if you would like to participate in friendly human activities, and what exactly those are.
