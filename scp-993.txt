**Item #:** SCP-993

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Any broadcasts of SCP-993 are to be intercepted as detailed in Protocol Upsilon-Beta 3 and blocked from public viewing. All intercepted broadcasts are to be recorded and stored for future viewing. Any subjects used to view SCP-993 must be under the age of ten and are to be dosed with a Class A amnesiac after they have described the episode.

Viewing of SCP-993 must be authorized by three (3) Level 4 personnel.

**Description:** SCP-993 is a children's television program entitled "Bobble the Clown'. SCP-993 seems to have been made in the style of an educational cartoon, with the primary plot of most episodes being the titular character, Bobble the Clown, learning a new skill or activity. The program appears to have no supporting cast and the setting of the program often changes between episodes.

SCP-993's anomalous properties become obvious when the program is viewed. Anyone watching of or above the age of ten will immediately fall unconscious when the program begins and will remain incapacitated until the end of the program, later reporting a stabbing headache immediately before blacking out. 

Children under the age of ten viewing SCP-993 later report that it teaches and advocates activities such as cannibalism, murder, torture, [DATA EXPUNGED]. These activities appear to become ingrained in the subjects mind and repeated exposure to SCP-993 can result in permanent psychosis and schizophrenia.

Episodes of SCP-993 are regularly broadcast from a currently unknown source, but all broadcasts to date have been successfully intercepted using Protocol Upsilon-Beta 3 and blocked from public viewing.
