I close my eyes. 

I've always been good at holding myself together. It would be wrong to say I felt like a bird in a gilded cage. A bird just sits there on its perch, chittering a melancholy song and pining for the blue sky beyond the golden bars, oblivious to the fact that it would likely be eaten by a cat within a matter of hours. No, I was more of a dog in an iron crate. I fumed and seethed and barked and threw myself against the walls confining me with all my might, and whenever I made enough noise I would get thrown a steak to quiet me down. But even as I moistened my chops on steak after steak, my anger never left me. I may have quieted down and quit bruising my sides on the walls, but I never stopped hating my confinement, never stopped loathing my own pitiful existence never stopped wanting to rip the throat out of my captor. It wasn't simply a matter of wanting to experience //more//, per se. It was a justified, carnal desire to experience //something//, anything at all. My entire life had been lived in a four-by-four-by-four box, and I knew that when I broke out it wouldn't be a pretty sight.

I remember standing there in my office, looking down at the tiny, tiny people. There were so many of them. They were like grains of sand on a beach, carefree and without a clue that the tide was about to come in. At the time I thought myself an important personâ€”or at least that I was living a marginally more consequential existence than the people below me. I enjoyed the comforts of an extravagant home, a full wardrobe, and every other perk and luxury one would expect of a young man from Wall Street. 

But even with a steak, a dog in a cage has full reason to be furious at the world that locked him there.

I didn't expect it to last forever, but I never would have guessed it would end as suddenly as it did. 1929 changed everything in the twinkling of an eye. Not only was I still trapped, but now my diet of steak had been ripped violently from my jaws. Like so many others, I stammered deliriously through the streets in a half-lucid daze. On the inside I was a wild animal, suffering internal paroxysms and chewing at my iron confines until my teeth fell out. But I've always been good at holding myself together, at least on the outside, and so I calmly scraped together what little I had left and made the dreaded journey back to Kansas. I had told myself years ago that I would rather die than go back. But in reality I did not want to die, and since it was becoming increasingly clear that I could very well perish in my present situation, I discarded what little dignity I had left and made for home.

I was a dog in a cage on his way to be surrounded by cats with tar and feathers. 

I didn't send a letter to inform them of my arrival. I knew that when they saw the papers they would be expecting me. Sure enough, there was an extra set of dinnerware set at the table when I arrived. Mom was the only one who hugged me. Ted, my brother, shook my hand and smiled like we'd just met at a church picnic. Uncle Lem said, "right on time!" and laughed, but not in a cruel way. Aunt Margie commented on how thin I was and how I'm lucky it was that I didn't die in the riots and thank the shining Lord in heaven nobody slit my throat and stole the clothes off my back. Dad didn't say anything, and I was grateful for that. 

From that day forward, I was an employee (I had stopped being a son a long time ago). To prove myself, I worked almost twice as much land as anyone else, yet the taunts of "city boy" and "Mr. Fancypants with his //edgey kayshun//" persisted in full force. Everyone, //everyone// went wild with glee whenever they watched me working the fields, pushing myself until my hands were blistered and bloodied.

In New York, the world had seemed to go to Hell in a hand basket; however, in Kansas, things were looking brighter than ever. "Wheat is gold for a reason," Uncle Lem would say. Ted and I would walk past a lush patch of growing crop he someone would never fail to elbow me and ask me which greens were worth more now. I swallowed my pride and endured every humiliation. I just kept on existing, tarred and feathered, beaten and bloodied, caged and enraged, calm and collected. I've always been good at holding myself together.

Nobody seemed worried when the price of wheat first dropped. They were annoyed and inconvenienced by it, but //it'll pass,// they said, //and before you know it things will be back to normal; yessirree, everything's going to be blue skies and golden wheat from now til Christ comes back.// I was skeptical. I had a feeling I knew what was coming. I'd seen it before. And I was half right: I had anticipated the dropping numbers just fine, but the dust came as a surprise. 

After the first storm, everyone emerged from their houses excitedly talking about the storm of the century. 'Wasn't that something?' 'How about that?' 'It'll take me all day to clean the car!' 'Kids, help me sweep the dirt out of the barn!' Everybody jabbered on about the big dust storm and how glad they were it was over. A week and a half later, the next storm came. And then the next one. And the following one was even bigger, and the one after that made the one before look minuscule in comparison, and within a matter of months we were all habitually setting the table with the cups and plates upside-down. //It's a bad season. We'll take a hit, to be sure, but we'll just have tough it out until ol' mother nature's sniffles go away.//

You'd see the storms coming over the horizons like rain clouds, and within minutes your property would be covered in a thick brown haze that made the world look like a tinted photograph. We closed the windows, but some dust would always get on our nice curtains and rugs, and Mom always made sure to wash them all spotless just in time for the next storm to dirty them again. The dust surrounded you, got into every inch of your house, every corner, every drawer. You woke up each morning and shook the dust off your sheets. You knocked your shoes against the floor before putting them on. If you were a kid, you could draw on literally any available surface. If you were a woman, your entire existence became a blur of scrubbing, sweeping, and praying that the attic didn't start raining down dirt into the porridge. Actually, //everyone// prayed the dust didn't get into our food, because if it did we had to eat it anyway. We got by from week to week by telling ourselves this storm will be the last one, it won't be like this forever. 

Then people started dying. 

It started as suicides. People going broke, losing their farms. One headline told us a doctor went stone cold broke and shot both his wife and himself. I woke up one morning to hear Mom and Aunt Margie wailing because one of their friends had hanged herself. She just could't deal with the dust anymore. Then the cattle started getting sick. You could see the dust in their noses and ears and mouths. Sometimes they'd eat a mouthful from their trough and get more dust than they did food. Then the people started getting sick. Same thing. They called it 'dust pneumonia.' It got so bad that if a child so much as cleared their throat, their mother's heart would skip a beat. Cathie, Ted's wife, made their daughter Grace wear a get-up with goggles and a mask. Grace said it was harder to breath with the mask on, but Cathie insisted that it was better than dust pneumonia. 

One day I noticed Grace sitting by the front steps while Cathie was cleaning inside. Mother and daughter were only a couple of yeards away, and yet Cathie never noticed Grace sobbing her little eyes out beneath her dusty goggles, nor did she notice me pick her up and tell her everything would be okay. It was out of character for me, but I told her a couple of jokes. I took some of my savings and told her to get in my car. Told her I'd take her to a picture show, and I did. I needed something to get my mind off the living nightmare my life had become, and I figured that if this kid's own mother couldn't bother to hear her crying, then Grace probably needed some cheering up too.

It had been years since I'd seen a picture show. It was Grace's first one. It was King Kong, and I remember every second of it since we ended up watching it twice. Never figured out how they made that monkey. And I realized on the car ride home that I wasn't all that angry anymore. Before the dust, I'd felt alone in my misery. After the dust, I felt like everyone else was just as miserable as I was, and I took some petty joy in that. And now I was driving back to the farm with my mind full of Fay Wray and Bruce Cabot and fifty-foot monkeys, and Grace was there to share it with me. I hadn't left my cage, but at least there was a little hand between the bars to hold onto me from outside. 

We went to the picture show at least a dozen times after that. We made sure to space it out, of course, since money was tight, and I know I spent more than I could afford, but it was the only thing that made life bearable during that time. There was a nice girl named Phyllis who took our tickets. I started flirting with her at the sixth show. I think she was interested in me. I don't now if Cathie ever found out about our little excursions, but if she did, she didn't say anything. Grace told me one day that she was going to grow up to be a famous movie actor one, and if you'd have laid eyes on that girl you would have believed it. 

March 14, 1934. The sky was finally blue again. For the first time in recent memory, there was no wind at all. Everyone gave thanks to Jesus and celebrated with picnics and parties. We had hardly anything left at that point, but everyone still put forward a little bit for the sake of the occasion. It felt like ages since I'd seen everyone so happy. Even Dad didn't look at me with quite as much bitterness as he usually did. Our neighbor Cecil baked an enormous chocolate cake and nearly gave us all heart attacks when he said he'd share it with our family. It was a terrific day, really. That's why I don't think what happened later was a punishment. If someone does something wrong, you don't make them happy before you punish them. That blue sky and giant cake was an apology, I think. Some kind of note from God or whoever to say, //you don't deserve what you're about to get, and I'm so, so sorry.// 

It was still 3:00 in the afternoon when we saw it coming. For split second we thought it was another dust storm, but that theory was quickly set aside. This was coming much quicker. Plus, dust storms were so huge they looked as though the mountains themselves were running toward you. This thing started at the ground and ended up somewhere in sky beyond one's eyes care to see. It extended infinitely to the left and went on forever to the right. Nobody said anything. We knew what to do. We all climbed inside the house, gathered together in a circle, and covered ourselves with blankets and clothes and anything else we could get our hands on. 

The storm carried on all night. You could feel and hear the house rattling on its foundation. Cathie started crying, and when Ted told her to shut up I just about knocked his head off. Besides that, nobody said anything until the storm quit the next morning. It was dead quiet when we opened the door. It was dark. Not as dark as night, but dark. Brown, too. We were used to the air being dusty, but this felt like the air //was// dust. We had the women stay inside while we went to inspect the damage to the property.

Ted had left the barn door open and the whole thing was pretty much packed full of dirt now. Dad screamed at him, hit him, kicked him when he was down, only stopped when saw a rabbit nearby. Rabbits had been eating virtually everything that was left of the greenery, and smashing them to death was how most people passed the time. But right before Dad caved its head in, we heard something that sounded for all the world like a human cry for help. Coming from the rabbit. We all looked at each other, wondering if the others heard it, too, but none of us said anything. 

Days passed. Nothing changed. The dust still hung over everything, blocking the sky and the sun. When Dad and Uncle Lem screamed at each other about whether or not to get back to work, I would take Grace up to her room and we would talk about the actors and actresses we liked and which stories we thought were best. 

The difference between day and night had grown so difficult to distinguish that we eventually lost all track of how much time had passed. At some point or another, Cecil came banging on our door, his face like he'd seen a ghost. He gathered me, Dad, Ted, and Uncle Lem together and told us that he'd been hearing rumors. He said Ruben Peterson down the way had hanged himself. We told him that this kind of news wasn't surprising anymore. Then Cecil said that Ruben Peterson's wife found his head lying on the floor, screaming, sitting five feet away from his body, dust pouring out of his neck and head like sawdust from a doll that's been ripped apart. Dad called Cecil a gullible idiot and threw him out of our house. 

One nightâ€”I think it was nightâ€”me and most of the family were sound asleep when we heard Ted hollering outside. Uncle Lem just about died when he saw Aunt Margie walking away from the patio and into the cloudy distance. He yelled at her, pleaded from a distance, begged her to come back. He tried to chase after her, but Dad and Ted held him back. I'd never seen Uncle Lem cry before, but he just sat there in a broken puddle, and we all eventually left him and went back into the house. He came back inside hours later. Told us that he only stopped crying because the dust had dried up all his tears. Nobody was able to go back to sleep. I wondered if anyone else had seen a figure way off in the distance, the figure Aunt Margie had been walking toward. 

Food was running low and Dad was certain we would starve to death if he didn't try to drive to market. Mom begged him not to go, but he insisted. Thing is, right after he opened the door and right before he stepped outside, he looked at me and said, "g'bye." He didn't look at Mom, or Ted, or Uncle Lem when he said that. He looked at me. We never saw him again after that. I still wonder what that meant. 

Uncle Lem and Ted went next door to check if Cecil was dead. If he had food he wasn't using, we needed it. They told me to stay behind and guard the girls. They came back empty-handed, their eyes haunted. They wouldn't tell us what they saw, they just hugged everyone and told them that they loved them. 

We all slept together in the living room after that. I awoke to a loud noise in the middle of the night, again, only this time the source was a gunshot. Mom was dead. I grabbed Grace and raced her upstairs while Ted tried to wrestle the gun away from Uncle Lem. He was able to, but only after Lem had put a bullet through his own head. When I came downstairs to help clean up, I asked where all the blood had gone. Ted just looked at me and handed me a broom, and I realized that there hadn't been any blood at all. 

It was just me, Ted, Cathie and Grace after that. Cathie clutched Grace so close to her that I was afraid she'd strange the poor child, and occasionally I thought that might be her intention. Ted pointed out that none of us had eaten in a week. Cathie pointed out that we were all starving to death.

A week after that, we had a very similar conversation. 

I caught Cathie sitting by herself on the front porch one day. She was rubbing her fingernail along her forearm, chipping away the dust that had built on her skin. We all had dust on our skin. But as she picked away the dust bit by bit, I realized that the crater she was making in her arm was getting a little too deep. I stopped watching after that, because I knew she would just picked on through to the other side, and all she would find would be dust. 

Grace was asleep when Ted and I found Cathie lying outside, her face fluttering the breeze, kept attached to her head by a tiny scrap at the right ear. We didn't say anything. Ted didn't even look upset. I probably didn't, either, but I still felt like he should have at least //tried// to look sad. Her face fluttered away into the distance as Ted and I dug her grave. 

Her face came back not long afterward. It was attached to a cat. It killed Ted. He didn't seem to mind.

I walked up to Grace's room. The stairs wobbled. I had a feeling that all that held them together now was dust. Wind was blowing everywhere, even though we were indoors. Grace sat on her bed, with that calm look that children have when all the adults are hopelessly upset. She'd become pale and thin, but by God you would swear she'd be a movie star one day. I took her into my arms as the wind blowed circled around us. We talked about King Kong one last time. She would have these long periods of silence, and I would keep thinking she'd passed, but then she'd come back and tell me that she wondered if they built a giant robot monkey and had it climb the Empire State Building. We talked about the Empire State Building some more, and I told her what it looked like on the inside, and then she never responded. When Ted died, the wind blew him away in chunks, but Grace went away in a single gust like sand along a shore. 

I think I'm the last one in the world who hasn't crumbled into dust yet. I've always been good at holding myself together. 

I don't need to eat, drink, or sleep anymore, even though my brain tells me I do. Sometimes I see shapes in the distance that look like people, but when I get closer I just see things that were once animals. 

Cathie came back once and stood over Grace's bed for an hour or so. I put a mask over where her face used to be and told her that Grace wasn't here anymore. I buried Cathie again, but she was already out again the next day. I haven't seen her since, though.

I'd lost all hope until a little black bird came flying out of the dust and into my hands. I can't explain how I knew, but I //knew// it was Grace. I could feel it in the dust inside the bird inside the dust. She didn't say anything, but she didn't need to. 

It took forever to find them all, but I did. 



I open my eyes. I'm ready. 

In each hand I hold sets of strings tied to corresponding birds. Aunt Margie, Uncle Lem, Ted, Grace, Mom, Dad, Cecil, and even Phyllis from the theater are here, along with some other folks I don't recognize. I thank them for being kind enough to volunteer. Their wings are twitching in anticipation. I take a deep breath, allowing the dust to fill my lungs. It's so much easier to breath now that I just accept it. Normally this plan would seem insane and impossible, but since the world is now insane and impossible as a general rule, now seems like the best time to try it. Besides, I'm so much lighter now. There's no more anger now. No more hatred. 

I open the door to the gilded birdcage. The little black birds pour out and fall upward into the sky. As I feel my feet leave the ground, I stare into the beautiful brown oblivion and whisper a dusty word of gratitude for finally setting this old dog free.
