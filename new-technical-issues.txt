> Welcome to the Technical Issues page. You are all free to ask me about any issue you might be having (with a computer, mind you), I will try and assist you in resolving those issues. Don't be bashful about asking me questions, I probably won't mess with your clearance level if you aggravate me. Probably. Mark your request with the date at the bottom of the page, I will answer all questions in the order received. Your call is very important to us...
> ~Technical Researcher Rosen

> Due to a... charmingly high number of requests, I am no longer responding to inquiries related to the following subjects and bodily functions.
> * Semen, whether human or animal
> * Any other sexual excretion
> * Really, anything gross coming out of a human body is your own problem.
> * Any other equally horrible things I haven't thought of at time of writing.
> 
> Anything added to this page relating to anything on this list will be deleted summarily, and we will be very, very cross with you.

//Hey Rose, I just installed enabled wireless access on one of my younger robots and you know how it is, it seems like a good idea to connect to random access points because viruses only hit bad robots. Long story short, despite programming it to always monitor downloads and make safe connections, I think my robot may have contracted E-AIDS. Anything you can do to help?// - Junior Research Assistant Dr. Gravity

> Here's my advice: Tell your robot to get itself defragmented and to inform all the data ports it may have interfaced with over the last month to get themselves scanned. It's the responsible thing to do.
> ~Rosen

//Do EMPs work on those damn kids skateboarding on my street? If so, can we use one?// -Research Assistant Reject


> Sorry dude. EMPs only nail electronic stuff. Unless those teens are androids, that wouldn't work. However, I can refer you to munitions, and I'm sure they would love to hook you up. Happy hunting!
> ~Rosen

//The security camera in my holding cell is emitting a high pitched buzz and the intercom is yelling at me in what sounds like the language associated with GoI Alpha-388. Are they supposed to be doing that?
~'Prisoner' NEXER//

> I think the more important question we ought to ask is this: how does a prisoner have network access from his cell?
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-23-12__
//Rosen, do me a favor and re-enable my status. Pat was a jackass lunatic, but he was thorough. I've been dodging misdirected "demonstrationtion to D-class" orders since Pat threw his hissy fit. Also, I may or may not have sent this through someone else's workstation, as mine has attempted to kill me on three different occasions despite not having any self-propelling mechanism.// ~ --Dr. Martin-- Engineer Kap

> Yeah... about that. Y'see, Pat was pretty anal about his security protocols. So much so, that he didn't disengage them before he mysteriously disappeared. I've been going through his notes to try and find what he actually did, but most of it is just him ranting about somebody names "Dumont the Destroyer" and long winded eulogies about pudding. The best I can do is transfer you to work that exempts you from the monthly execution until I can get this figured out. How does "Procedure 110-Montauk" sound?
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-23-12__
//Hey Rosen, my computer was being a little slow a minute ago, so I tried to increase the voltage that the computer received to around 10 kW more. I thought it made sense because more power makes more energy, right? Well, it didn't work. I tried looking online for a fix, and they suggested I delete something called win32. After doing that, I kept getting errors or something like that. A colleague of mine told me he could format the BIOS for me, and I graciously accepted; yet that still did not work. I have tried many fixes, and right now my computer is kind of on fire. I'm not worried about that, though. How can I make my computer work again, maybe to where I can make it faster?// ~ Dr. Taylor

> Try to download some more RAM. If that doesn't work, reformat your ZIP drive. If all else fails, reboot it twice and call me in the morning.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-23-12__
//Rosen, for some reason, my inbox keeps getting spam sent to it. The strangest thing about it is that they all say something along the lines of, "To the Past Me: X", with the the X being something mundane that apparently has 'harsh consequences on the future'. I've done all the things that it says will cause 'the disruption of the timeline', and so far nothing of ill consequence has happened. Should I chalk this up as a prank, or should I be worried?// ~Dr. Nyehcat

> Unless your computer has an external TARDIS drive or a flux capacitor wireless adaptor, I wouldn't lose much sleep over it.
> ~Rosen

//Rosen, I got Dr. Nyehcat a TARDIS for his birthday but now I want it back. What do?// -Agent Convit

//...I would like to recommend that you upgrade your firewall, as it is someone dangerous could get network access.

**Note:** __03-24-12__
//I think there's some kind of malfunction in the Site 38 vending machines. The guy swears he's putting Cheez-Puffs in, but they disappear almost as soon as the guy leaves. I'm afraid there might be a heretofore undocumented SCP inhabiting Site 38, possibly a dark eldritch terror whose lust for death and pain can be slated only with Cheez-Puffs. And also death and pain. But just in case it's that kid we keep locked in the basement, how do I request land mines for the detention level? I think it'll slow him down.// ~Mr. Eskobar

> Now the trick here is how strong you want your mine to be. You don't want to blow up the snacks along with the thief, but you also want to make sure he's crippled. I'll send the catalog your way.
> ~Rosen

//Hey Rosen, should I take the red pill or the blue pill?// ~Dr. Epsilon

//MY CAPS LOCK KEY IS STUCK WHAT DO I DO?// ~Dr. Edison

> TRY HOLDING DOWN THE SHIFT KEY WHILE TYPING UNTIL I CAN REQUISITION YOU A NEW KEYBOARD. PERHAPS SEE IF ONE OF YOUR COWORKERS WILL LOAN YOU ONE. IF YOU CAN, TRY TO UNSTICK THE BUTTON. LET ME KNOW IF YOU DO SO I DON'T HAVE TO ORDER A NEW KEYBOARD BECAUSE FILLING OUT THOSE DAMN HUNDRED PAGE REQUISITION FORMS IS A //HASSLE//.

//In nomine Patris et Eber et Spiritus sancti, quaeso.  Ego sum habens difficultatem usura artificio anima inspectionem quod dicitur ad Site XIX. Ut scitis, nostri doctrinis enim continentiam de quaedam requiram illa actiones a humana singulorum qui demonstrationnstrare appropraite gradu pietatis. Dum normalis usu fuerat confirmare et temptare fidem pertinet singulorum per inquisitionem, nostri reductiones in numerum elit non requiritur uti processus mechanica et electrica ad automate inquisitio.  Nostri artificio inquisitionem non ipsos proprie.  Consilium ergo asserit apostolus et ego nego tamen verbi Filioque vel haereticus. Hoc est non ita.  Arte possunt reparari per inpositionem manus aut exorcismi opus?//
//Vestrum in Christi, Pater Gomez, SJ. Capellanus, Institutum XIX//

> If you're looking for an exorcist you've really come to the wrong place. If you don't mind doing things God might find displeasurable, like allowing undead tin zombies to possess your stuff, I'm sure the Church of the Broken God would be all over that like cultist flies on a holy shit.

//Hello, Mr. Rosen: I have many names. My operator has named me Belu the Unwavering, even when I insisted on being named my natural name. I am sending this message to you for help. Get me away from this maniac, Dr. Taylor. He tries to insert baloney into my CD drive, even when I plead him not to. This ridiculous name that he has assigned me has been burned into my artificial memory. His browser history is enough to drive one into madness. He drops food all over the monitor and keyboard. As Technical Researcher, I hope you will take pity on a sentient computer and re-assign me to another, more competent user.//

-Belu the Unwavering

>  Uuuugh... I have requisitioned Dr. Taylor ANOTHER computer. His old computer has been put into storage and cataloged as an anomalous object until such a time comes when I have a use for a snobby computerbox.

//Dear Sir,
It seems our correspondence route with our own technical support has fallen victim to a temporal anomaly. We of the American Security Containment Initiative can do very little to remedy this and would much appreciate assistance from your end.//

//Regards, B. Franklin, ASCI Researcher//

> Nice try, But It's common knowledge that Benjamin Franklin was mourning the death his wife Deborah in 1774, and would not have had the time to look into computerbox tech-y matters. Obviously.

**Note:**  __4-3-12__
//Hi tech...
I loaned my laptop to Dr. Bright. Upon getting it back, I found:
-Sleazy pictures of [REDACTED]
-Videos of [REDACTED]
-18 viruses
-A picture of [[[SCP-050]]] on the desktop
-and 9 conversations with Nigerian princes.//

//What'd the monkey do this time? And what can I do in the future to prevent it from happening again? Or, how can I fix it now?// -Anonymous

> Holy shit dude. That laptop was... something. First off, that thing reeked. I don't know what he did to it, but it smelled of [REDACTED]. The keys were sticky and coated in some sort of epoxy. The CD tray had some sort of black liquid oozing from it. I sent a sample to the lab, but the test results were inconclusive. And those pictures... I don't know what I saw, but I know that I never want to see it again.
> I have since incinerated your old laptop and sent for a new one. I hoped you learned your lesson about the consequences of sharing. Now excuse me, I'm going to go see Dr. Glass about getting an increase in my medication dosage.

//Be afraid. Be very afraid.// -Security Bot A-23

//My Deborah? Dead? This year? Bloody Hell, man! When?//

//B. Franklin, ASCI Researcher//

> Uh... whoops. Pretend I never said anything. Your wife is totally fine. Not dying at all. I don't know why I'm even talking about this. //YOU NEVER SAW ME//.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __4-10-12__
//Roseman, my pornography collection got erased from my Gateway. Can you retrieve it?// -Agent Convit

> Look over here, we got ourselves a wise guy. Well, Mr. Convit, I regret to inform you that your computers files were all irretrievable, so I had your computer disposed of. Not to worry, because this time tomorrow a brand-new **//e-machine//** will arrive at your desk, just for you. You're welcome.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __4-11-12__
//Rosen, another problem that may or may not be related to Senior Staff Shenaningans. Someone did an in-place reinstall of// every //one of my computers (including my personal laptop, somehow), made Internet Explorer 7 the default and only browser, and revoked my software-installation permissions on all of them. As my work requires extra precautions against drive-by downloads and other viruses, I need Firefox reinstalled (or at least unlock my account so I can do it myself), because AdBlock Plus is the only workable solution I've found to prevent them from even reaching the system, since the antivirus won't catch it in time to prevent [DATA EXPUNGED] (How the heck did they get access to my laptop? It's at home, for crying out loud!).// - Dr. Okagawa

> It seems your problem is that your computer is too desirable, and people keep messing with it as a result. As such, I have replaced your computers with a complete suite of WebTV applications. Then I went ahead and replaced the laptop with a Commodore PET. Then I forgot what I came in your office to do, so I ate your lunch and called it a day. I hope it solves your tampering issues.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __4-11-12__
//The janitor's Roomba won our damn NCAA bracket. Can you deactivate it so that I can claim my rightful prize?// -Agent Convit

> Dude, the Roomba has won the tournament for the last 4 years. Don't see why you're so upset. And even if I wanted to deactivate it, then Robo-CDC says that would make my office a hazardous working environment. Just let it go.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __4-11-12__
//My computer keeps telling me that it wants a cheeseburger and I don't know what to do. There was this cat, and some other thing, and now I'm just so confused. Why does it "want cheezbrger"? It's an appliance. It has no gastrointestinal tract. It cannot "haz et". Please fix this infernal contraption before I have to take drastic action.// -Doctor Wog

//Rosen,//

//That damn D-Class dropped me into an email on [[[SCP-713| 713]]] and sent it to my own laptop. GET ME OUT OF HERE!//

-A pissed off researcher.

> I guess I'll just go through every laptop on-site looking for you, since it must be //urgent// if you don't tell me who or where you are! //I'll be right on it.//
> ~Rosen



**Note:** __4-13-12__
//Hey Rosy, my computer terminal stole my vuvuzela somehow. Tell me if you see it about, won't you?// - Junior Agent Lucas

> Good news- I killed two birds with one stone by fixing both of your problems.
> Bad News- The stone in that analogy is the big rock I keep in my office, and the bird was Ax's monitor. So... yeah. Problem solved.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __4-13-12__
//So I found my friend's computer, and I decided to "hack" it. So instead of writing that they're gay on their Facebook, I'm going to put porn on their laptops! Aren't I being incredibly clever and hilarious and original!// -Agent Convit

> I actually do the same thing, only I work with cognitohazards instead of porn, and the people who reject me instead of friends!
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __4-13-12__
//Rosen, I know what you're thinking... "why is Taylor writing me again? Does he need a Gateway today again? Well, no, but I still need help. See, I'm not the superstitious kind of guy, so to keep the meddlers out, I tried to make a machine that would drop a step-ladder on anyone who walked into my office. Unfortunately, I forgot about this and did not turn it off before entering. Long story short, I have a splitting headache (though that may just be the stitches above my skull breaking), there's a video starring Sasha Grey on my computer (which is now covered in what I could only hope as rather viscous milk), and my pants are nowhere to be found. Talk about bad luck! So, Rosen, what do?// ~Dr. Taylor

> **NOTE TO ALL PERSONNEL WHOM IT MAY CONCERN**

>
> Dr. Taylor is officially banned from requisitioning any new equipment from the IT department. After //3// separate towers, 4 monitors, and god knows how many repairs, I am throwing in the towel. Taylor, you will have to make do with what you have.

//Um...hey, say...hypothetically... someone were to coat a desktop with [[[SCP-447| 447]]] goop, where would it take the most trouble to get off?// - Assistant Researcher Fairbairn

> Depends on whether or not the desk is made of dead bodies.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __4-26-12__

//Alright, so after my third reprimand, I received a laptop whose owner had mysteriously disappeared several months before as a replacement computer. Now, this was all well and good, until I tried to check my e-mail. Turns out that they failed to completely wipe all the personal details, so I find myself logged on to what must have been the previous user's account. Out of curiosity, I idly looked through a few of the things in his inbox, and now wherever I click there's an emaciated corpse on the monitor. Not only does this prevent me from looking at my... research... but whoever it was appears to have scrawled "help" and something about D-Class personnel in blood and faeces on the desktop.//

//You can understand how this is a source of annoyance, but I'm afraid that if I file a request for a new computer, they won't give me anything back. Rosy, what should I do?// - Researcher Marigold

> Yeeeah... turns out that Memetics didn't totally wipe the computers we loaned them, and you apparently got part of the bad batch. I would recommend dealing with it until they come up with a solution. Good luck!

//Ever heard of 'wheeking'? It's a sound that guinea pigs make. Unfortunately, it's not a sound that the voice commands accept on my computer. Or any computer for that matter. Do you know how hard it is to type on a full-sized keyboard when you're 22cm in length?// -S███████

//I'm not sure if you're the one I should be talking to about this, but there appears to be a large, angry squid inside my monitor. The problem is, it just gets... let's say "uncooperative"... when I try to get it out. Should I try something else, or just ignore it and hope it goes away?// -Dr. Marvel

> That is a screen-saver, Dr. Marvel. There are no sea creatures living in your computer. Remember when we had this lecture over the "crazy ball" that was bouncing around in there?
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __5-1-12__
//Okay, how about, could you either get me a keyboard small enough for a guinea pig to use easily, or have the computer systems recognize wheeking as voice commands? The huge keyboard just made things worse.// -S███████

> I actually went over-budget with that keyboard, so you will have to wait for the next budget cycle. Seriously, keys the size of dinner plates eat up funding like you wouldn't believe.

**Note:** __5-5-12__
//The corpse on my computer screen seems to be coming back to life. For now it's just the occasional spasm, but now-and-then he bursts into very distracting screaming fits. I suspect that this may have to do with the random error messages I'm getting whenever I try to access the network. Generally something along the lines of "ERROR 535: REANIMATION DIFFICULTIES". I'm a little afraid, in all honesty, because the last thing I heard the Memetics Department needed computers for was a thought transference vector for viral diseases. Did someone digitalise [[[SCP-008]]]?// - Researcher Marigold

> ~Rosen

**Note:** __5-6-12__
//Hello, IT.  We are down at Site-██, Memetics Lab 12C. And we were wondering if there is a way to revert a desktop background image without looking at the screen? It seems someone opened a rather nasty Visual Memenetic and managed to set it to the background. This would normally not be a problem, but several files are needed on the hard drive. We've already lost several researchers, and the first tech that tried. For now the screen is unplugged, but we have no way of resetting the desktop. Help?//

//Hello, Rosen. Due to the nature of my first few research assignments, I've been thinking of booby trapping my laptop to avoid the chance of someone stealing it and compromising containment. I already have a trigger program in place, but I was hoping you could help me with the payload. Assuming someone sets the trap off in a standard Site corridor, what type of explosive would you recommend that would avoid causing structural damage while still destroying the contents of the hard drive?//

//Hey, I got sent here by my supervisor because he told me that he had no idea what to do, and, I quote, "those chowderheads at technical might know what to do." What happened was that I was trying to get access to my files, and when I opened up my research from the previous day, all there was was a black redacted line through my entire months work. I couldn't delete it, and I couldn't write over it, so do you/Pat have any idea what I am supposed to do to get this off my work? This was the only save file there was, so I can't reopen it somewhere else. So, in short, any help would be great.//

//Rosen, I have an unusual request that I can't find under the standard requisition form. I need an industrial strength cooling generator, or a meat locker. The reason behind this is that my new, customized, ANOMALOUS desktop seems to have near-infinite processing power, and the ability to survive an almost limitless heat source without problems. However, even though cooking lunch on my computer was fun, it's kind of a safety hazard because it's generating a heat of 380 degrees Farenheit. Do you have a solution?//

//Ignore the blood at Sanin’s desk, please. I had to knock him out and demote him to D-Class. Is that even allowed? Eh, whatever. I did the gene pool a favor.//

//Hi Roget, Dr. Fossil here.//

//My son's really into computing and he's great at keeping secrets, so I think he'd do great at the Foundation. To help establish him, could you take him in for work experience? It'd mean so much to me, and he isn't any bother. He can look after himself, so he'd really just be a bit of help around the requests. Please? If you can help him ultimately get a job, I promise I'll handle all the requests for my site for as long as he's employed.//

//Please?//

//Hey, it seems that some shithead newbie added a random thing of no value whatsoever to this page. I hope it won't be a problem.//

>Hey, Roget here. Please add stuff to this page above the "Some Shithead Newbie" thing, because I leave that at the bottom of the page on purpose because I think it's a funny way to end the page. Thanks in advance!
