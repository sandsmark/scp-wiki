[[module Rate]]


Since Pat has disappeared into the ether(again), and the technical page was getting backed up, I have been authorized to create this NEW! technical issues page. Feel free to ask about any issue you might have, and I will try and assist you in resolving those issues.

//Hey Rose, I just installed enabled wireless access on one of my younger robots and you know how it is, it seems like a good idea to connect to random access points because viruses only hit bad robots. Long story short, despite programming it to always monitor downloads and make safe connections, I think my robot may have contracted E-AIDS. Anything you can do to help?// - Junior Research Assistant Dr. Gravity


> I would advise instructing your robot to inform all the data ports it may have interfaced with over the last month to get themselves scanned. Its the responsible thing to do.
