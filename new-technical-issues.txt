//Hey, Rosen. Newly-assigned-to-914 J.R. Cens here.
So, funny story. I [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/experiment-log-914/offset/13 put a flash drive with Windows 10 through 914] as one of my first tests, and the output was a Terminator figurine that installs Skynet onto a computer via USB upload. It replaced the OS of the computer, connected to the Facility 23 network, and made all network-enabled prosthetics start slapping their users repeatedly. You have an hour or two to help me?//

//Hi, What do you suggest in case of a rogue A.I. uprising? I tried to print a text file I had on a flash drive that went through 914, but the printer suddenly grew arms and legs, introduced himself as "pAInapple" and wants to conquer the town of Fleurus, in Belgium. I'm not sure what to do but now it won't print my files unless I provide it with a sufficient amount of weapons to escape the site and conquer Fleurus. Help? Please?//
//- Intern Francois Beauvillier//

> I mean, why not just let him have it? Often times, rogue A.I. will behave after they conquer some humans and then have to be responsible for human problems. Give 'em some foam dart guns and let it go nuts. Fleurus hasn't seen any action since Napoleon, I'm sure they could use the excitement.

//Hello Rosen. It appears that my laptop has suffered major physical damage from a pair of metal handcuffs that have been fired via cannon through its monitor screen at Mach 5. May I request a replacement that is less vulnerable to these kinds of attacks? Thank you in advance.//
//- Junior Researcher Yuyuni Belopaku//

> Sure thing. You've got a new hazardous environment Foundation-made luggable system. It weighs 50 pounds and it will take .44 rounds for you if you asked it to. I've also credited you for that gym membership you signed up for, you're probably not going to be needing it anymore.

//Hello again, Rosen. I have received an email from an unknown address, stating that they are the O5 Council and that my laptop used to be a massive hamster ball. I am aware that this information is likely false, but can you verify this just to be sure?//

//Rosen, this may be a bit of a peculiar request, but would you happen to know anything about "Seussian" devices? I have been speaking with the pataphysical department, and they want to know if you know anything about a "Super-Zooper-Flooper-Do", or are able to write someone who does.//
//- Junior Researcher Madden, Site 19//

> You don't know what to do with a "Super-Zooper-Flooper-Do?" Well, ask someone else, because I don't want to.

//Hey, it seems that some shithead added a random thing of no value whatsoever to this page. I hope it won't be a problem.//

> Thanks to a modest budget increase I’ve added several interns to help me with the work here. I haven’t learned their names yet but they’re all interns so... yeah. Let me know if they screw up. 
> ~Rosen

> Quite assuring welcome, sir. And why does all senior staff treat me as an intern? Anyways, I should introduce: I am a Technician from the 914 crew. 

> ~Akchote

>Hey, Roget here. Please add stuff to this page above the "Some Shithead" thing, because I leave that at the bottom of the page on purpose because I think it's a good way to end the page. Thanks in advance!
