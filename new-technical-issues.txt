Since Pat has disappeared into the void (again), and the technical page was getting backed up, I have been authorized to create this NEW! technical issues page. Feel free to ask  me about any issue you might have, and I will try and assist you in resolving those issues.  Don't be shy about asking me questions, I probably won't mess with your clearance level if you aggravate me. Probably.

//Hey Rose, I just installed enabled wireless access on one of my younger robots and you know how it is, it seems like a good idea to connect to random access points because viruses only hit bad robots. Long story short, despite programming it to always monitor downloads and make safe connections, I think my robot may have contracted E-AIDS. Anything you can do to help?// - Junior Research Assistant Dr. Gravity


> I would advise instructing your robot to inform all the data ports it may have interfaced with over the last month to get themselves scanned. It's the responsible thing to do.

//Do EMPs work on those damn kids skateboarding on my street? If so, can we use one?// -Research Assistant Reject


> Sorry dude. EMP's only nail electronic stuff. Unless those teens are androids, that wouldn't work. However, I can refer you to munitions, and Im sure they would love to hook you up. Happy hunting!

//Dr. Rosen, it has recently come to my attention that the Foundation's fleet of transportation helicopters are experiencing an unacceptable degree of wear and tear on their rotors and that performance has significantly degraded as a result.  With that in mind, could you please prepare a manual on parachute fabrication and use to be distributed to all helicopter crews, preferably some time in the next fifty to sixty seco//
