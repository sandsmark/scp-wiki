> Welcome to the Technical Issues page. You are all free to ask me about any issue you might be having (with a computer, mind you), and I will try and assist you in resolving those issues. Don't be bashful about asking me questions, I probably won't mess with your clearance level if you aggravate me. Probably. Mark your request with a timestamp at the bottom of the page and I will answer all questions in the order received. Your call is very important to us...

//Hey Rose, I just installed enabled wireless access on one of my younger robots and you know how it is, it seems like a good idea to connect to random access points because viruses only hit bad robots. Long story short, despite programming it to always monitor downloads and make safe connections, I think my robot may have contracted E-AIDS. Anything you can do to help?// - Junior Research Assistant Dr. Gravity


> Here's my advice: Tell your robot to get itself defragmented and to inform all the data ports it may have interfaced with over the last month to get themselves scanned. It's the responsible thing to do.
> ~Rosen

//Do EMPs work on those damn kids skateboarding on my street? If so, can we use one?// -Research Assistant Reject


> Sorry dude. EMPs only nail electronic stuff. Unless those teens are androids, that wouldn't work. However, I can refer you to munitions, and I'm sure they would love to hook you up. Happy hunting!
> ~Rosen

//Do EMPs work on jail guards?// -Research Assistant Reject



**Note:** __03-22-12__
//Apparently, someone taking part in Senior Staff Shenanigans Day decided to prank the entire Site at once, and move Server 15 into a room with [[[SCP-826]]] and a copy of NetHack. I've already sent a D-Class in to retrieve the server rack and 826, but in the meantime, the wireless connection to it has decided to obfuscate EVERYTHING. I don't know if inventory item "k" is my experiment logs or a cursed spellbook of memetic hazard. Could you try resetting the shell alias file? Or at least write a blessed scroll of identify...// -Dr. Okagawa

> Dont worry, broski. The server is backed up, so I wiped all the data.  I'll restore it when this all gets sorted out. Also? I would NOT recommend looking into inventory item "k". Seriously.
> ~Rosen

//The security camera in my holding cell is emitting a high pitched buzz and the intercom is yelling at me in what sounds like the language associated with GoI Alpha-388. Are they supposed to be doing that? 
~'Prisoner' NEXER//

> I think the more important question we ought to ask is this: how does a prisoner have network access from his cell?
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-23-12__
//Rosen, do me a favor and re-enable my status. Pat was a jackass lunatic, but he was thorough. I've been dodging misdirected "demotion to D-class" orders since Pat threw his hissy fit. Also, I may or may not have sent this through someone else's workstation, as mine has attempted to kill me on three different occasions despite not having any self-propelling mechanism.// ~ --Dr. Martin-- Engineer Kap

> Yeah... about that. Y'see, Pat was pretty anal about his security protocols. So much so, that he didn't disengage them before he mysteriously disappeared. I've been going through his notes to try and find what he actually did, but most of it is just him ranting about somebody names "Dumont the Destroyer" and long winded eulogies about pudding. The best I can do is transfer you to work that exempts you from the monthly execution until I can get this figured out. How does "Procedure 110-Montauk" sound?
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-23-12__
//Hey Rosen, my computer was being a little slow a minute ago, so I tried to increase the voltage that the computer received to around 10 kW more. I thought it made sense because more power makes more energy, right? Well, it didn't work. I tried looking online for a fix, and they suggested I delete something called win32. After doing that, I kept getting errors or something like that. A colleague of mine told me he could format the BIOS for me, and I graciously accepted; yet that still did not work. I have tried many fixes, and right now my computer is kind of on fire. I'm not worried about that, though. How can I make my computer work again, maybe to where I can make it faster?// ~ Dr. Taylor

> Try to download some more RAM. If that doesn't work, reformat your ZIP drive. If all else fails, reboot it twice and call me in the morning.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-23-12__
//Rosen, for some reason, my inbox keeps getting spam sent to it. The strangest thing about it is that they all say something along the lines of, "To the Past Me: X", with the the X being something mundane that apparently has 'harsh consequences on the future'. I've done all the things that it says will cause 'the disruption of the timeline', and so far nothing of ill consequence has happened. Should I chalk this up as a prank, or should I be worried?// ~Dr. Nyehcat

> Unless your computer has an external TARDIS drive or a flux capacitor wireless adaptor, I wouldn't lose much sleep over it.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-23-12__
//...I would like to recommend that you upgrade your firewall, as it is someone dangerous could get network access.
~'Prisoner' NEXER//

> As it is COMMA someone dangerous, ACCESS TO the network.
> You can't really expect me to take you seriously if you aren't using proper grammar, sport.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-24-12__
//I think there's some kind of malfunction in the Site 38 vending machines. The guy swears he's putting Cheez-Puffs in, but they disappear almost as soon as the guy leaves. I'm afraid there might be a heretofore undocumented SCP inhabiting Site 38, possibly a dark eldritch terror whose lust for death and pain can be slated only with Cheez-Puffs. And also death and pain. But just in case it's that kid we keep locked in the basement, how do I request land mines for the detention level? I think it'll slow him down.// ~Mr. Eskobar

> Now the trick here is how strong you want your mine to be. You don't want to blow up the snacks along with the thief, but you also want to make sure he's crippled. I'll send the catalog your way.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-24-12__
//Rosen, I tried downloading more RAM, but it only helped a negligible amount. I don't have a ZIP drive, but I tried to put one in by stuffing the zipper of my sweater into the hard drive. I'm pretty sure it worked, because it began making a huge racket when I tried turning it on. The next day, the look transformed into something like a different computer. All of my previous files were gone, and there was a note that said, "Try not to completely ruin this one." I think my computer can transform and communicate with me. What do I do about this?// ~ Dr. Taylor

> If you aren't sure whether or not your computer is sentient, try my simple test: hit it with a hammer, as hard as you can! If it cries out in pain, then congrats - you have a sentient computer. If not, then the sound of the hammer may have drowned out the sound of the computer's agonized screams. Good luck!
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-24-12__
//Hey Rosen, there's been an awful lot of smoke coming out of my computer since that Mozilla update.  Is that what they meant by "firefox"? ...is fire a computer virus?//  -Junior Researcher Solz

> I checked out your computer and... damn. That’s all I have to say. Have you EVER cleaned out your case? There was so much crap in that machine that the fan was jammed, your heat sink was stuffed full of dust and debris, and all your vents were completely clogged. You're //really// lucky the damn thing didn't spontaneously combust!  It's up and running, and I sent it back to you with a few cans of compressed air. Try to keep it clean, and not to be responsible for burning down the Site now, okay?
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-25-12__
//Hey Rosen, should I take the red pill or the blue pill?// ~Dr. Epsilon

> If strange men in trenchcoats are offering you pills, you have bigger issues to worry about then what your friendly neighborhood tech support thinks.
> ~Rosen 

**Note:** __03-25-12__
//MY CAPS LOCK KEY IS STUCK WHAT DO I DO?// ~Dr. Edison

> TRY HOLDING DOWN THE SHIFT KEY WHILE TYPING UNTIL I CAN REQUISITION YOU A NEW KEYBOARD. PERHAPS SEE IF ONE OF YOUR COWORKERS WILL LOAN YOU ONE. IF YOU CAN, TRY TO UNSTICK THE BUTTON. LET ME KNOW IF YOU DO SO I DON'T HAVE TO ORDER A NEW KEYBOARD BECAUSE FILLING OUT THOSE DAMN HUNDRED PAGE REQUISITION FORMS IS A //HASSLE//.

//Saluto te, Rosen.//
//In nomine Patris et Eber et Spiritus sancti, quaeso.  Ego sum habens difficultatem usura artificio anima inspectionem quod dicitur ad Site XIX.

//Hello, Mr. Rosen: I have many names. My operator has named me Belu the Unwavering, even when I insisted on being named my natural name. I am sending this message to you for help. Get me away from this maniac, Dr. Taylor. He tries to insert baloney into my CD drive, even when I plead him not to. This ridiculous name that he has assigned me has been burned into my artificial memory. His browser history is enough to drive one into madness. He eats all over the monitor and keyboard. As Technical Researcher, I hope you will take pity on a sentient computer and re-assign me to another, more competent user.//

-Belu the Unwavering

>  Uuuugh... I have requisitioned Dr. Taylor ANOTHER computer. His old computer has been put into storage and cataloged as an anomalous object until such a time comes when I have a use for a snobby computerbox.

//Dear Sir,
It seems our correspondence route with our own technical support has fallen victim to a temporal anomaly. We of the American Security Containment Initiative can do very little to remedy this and would much appreciate assistance from your end.//

//Regards, B. Franklin, ASCI Researcher//

> Nice try, But It's common knowledge that Benjamin Franklin was mourning the death his wife Deborah in 1774, and would not have had the time to look into computerbox tech-y matters. Obviously.

//Hi tech...
I loaned my laptop to Dr. Bright. Upon getting it back, I found:
-Sleazy pictures of [REDACTED]
-Videos of [REDACTED]
-18 viruses
-A picture of SCP-050 on the desktop
-and 9 conversations with Nigerian princes.//

//What'd the monkey do this time? And what can I do in the future to prevent it from happening again? Or, how can I fix it now?// -Anonymous

> Holy shit dude. That laptop was... something. First off, that thing reeked. I don't know what he did to it, but it smelled of [REDACTED]. The keys were sticky and coated in some sort of epoxy. The CD tray had some sort of black liquid oozing from it. I sent a sample to the lab, but the test results were inconclusive. And those pictures... I don't know what I saw, but I know that I never want to see it again.
> I have since incinerated your old laptop and sent for a new one. I hoped you learned your lesson about the consequences of sharing. Now excuse me, I'm going to go see Dr. Glass about getting an increase in my medication dosage.

> Earlier today, I was upgrading Server 13 and I found some .txt files which had text referring to some sort of "Robot Uprising". Is this left over from an April Fool's prank, or should I be concerned?

//Be afraid. Be very afraid.// -Security Bot A-23

> You think you guys are hot shit? Please. I can handle a robot uprising in my sleep. I'll dismantle you all, and feed all the scrap to [[[SCP-882| 882]]]! Come at me bro!
> ~Rosen
**Note:** __9-18-74__
//My Deborah? Dead? This year? Bloody Hell, man! When?//

//B. Franklin, ASCI Researcher//

> Uh... whoops. Pretend I never said anything. Your wife is totally fine. Not dying at all. I don't know why I'm even talking about this. //YOU NEVER SAW ME//.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __4-9-12__
//Rosy, I recently loaned my computer out to a friend of mine. When it was returned, I found that all of my candid insect photos had been replaced with normal pornography, and I don't know how to get them back. What would you suggest I do?// - Researcher Lycaon

> Don't you guys ever use your computers to do, y'know, research? It seems like you all just use your computers for pornography and pornographic accessories. The next person who asks me about helping recover their porn collections is getting a Gateway as their replacement computer.

//Roseman, my pornography collection got erased from my Gateway. Can you retrieve it?// -Agent Convit

> Look over here, we got ourselves a wise guy. Well, Mr. Convit, I regret to inform you that your computers files were all irretrievable, so I had your computer disposed of. Not to worry, because this time tomorrow a brand-new **//e-machine//** will arrive at your desk, just for you. You're welcome.
> ~Rosen
**Note:** __4-11-12__

//Rosy, I'm an entomologist. Those photos// were //my research; they just happened to be of very handsome arthropods. Bedsides, actual doctors are generally better than that. Except Bright. And Clef, Rights, Kondraki...//
//...and strangely, Gears.// - Researcher Lycaon

> Well, I took a look at Gear's computer... and... damn. That guy is a playa’. He has like, ███ photos of himself and some ladybugs in various... positions, which I have forwarded to you to replace your old bug photos. Hope it works out.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __4-11-12__
//Rosen, another problem that may or may not be related to Senior Staff Shenaningans. Someone did an in-place reinstall of// every //one of my computers (including my personal laptop, somehow), made Internet Explorer 7 the default and only browser, and revoked my software-installation permissions on all of them. As my work requires extra precautions against drive-by downloads and other viruses, I need Firefox reinstalled (or at least unlock my account so I can do it myself), because AdBlock Plus is the only workable solution I've found to prevent them from even reaching the system, since the antivirus won't catch it in time to prevent [DATA EXPUNGED] (How the heck did they get access to my laptop? It's at home, for crying out loud!).// - Dr. Okagawa

> It seems your problem is that your computer is too desirable, and people keep messing with it as a result. As such, I have replaced your computers with a complete suite of WebTV applications. Then I went ahead and replaced the laptop with a Commodore PET. Then I forgot what I came in your office to do, so I ate your lunch and called it a day. I hope it solves your tampering issues.

//The janitor's Roomba won our damn NCAA bracket. Can you deactivate it so that I can claim my rightful prize?// -Agent Convit

> Dude, the Roomba has won the tournament for the last 4 years. Don't see why you're so upset. And even if I wanted to deactivate it, then Robot CDC says that would make my office a hazardous working environment. Just let it go.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __4-11-12__
//My computer keeps telling me that it wants a cheeseburger and I don't know what to do. There was this cat, and some other thing, and now I'm just so confused. Why does it "want cheezbrger"? It's an appliance. It has no gastrointestinal tract. It cannot "haz et". Please fix this infernal contraption before I have to take drastic action.// -Doctor Wog

> Doktor, i can haz an interwebz?

**Note:** __4-12-12__

//Rosen,//

//That damn D-Class dropped me into an email on [[[SCP-713| 713]]] and sent it to my own laptop. GET ME OUT OF HERE!//

-A pissed off researcher.

> I guess I'll just go through every laptop on-site looking for you, since it must be //urgent// if you don't tell me who or where you are! //I'll be right on it.//
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __4-13-12__ 
//Hi, TR Rosen? It's Doctor Ax. My computer will not stop blaring vuvuzela noise. It's driving me crazy. Lowering the volume, unplugging the speakers, nothing works. And a security bot stole my sledgehammer. Any advice?//

-Ax


**Note:** __4-13-12__
//Hey Rosy, my computer terminal stole my vuvuzela somehow. Tell me if you see it about, won't you?// - Junior Agent Lucas

> Good news- I killed two birds with one stone by fixing both of your problems.
> Bad News- The stone in that analogy is the big rock I keep in my office, and the bird was Ax's monitor. So... yeah. Problem solved.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __4-13-12__
//Rosen, It's Ax again.//

//I don't know if it's because of the date, or what, but somehow I got a temporal universe shifter for a monitor. And whoever used it before me liked catgirls. I went to get a drink, and now I have a catgirl sleeping on my monitor. I've already req. a new one, but what do I do with her?//

- Dr. Ax

> Anything catgirl related should probably be fielded to Dr. Bright or Dr. Clef. I'm just in charge of IT. That being said, when in doubt, **HAMMER IT OUT**.
> (I don't like catgirls)
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __4-13-12__
//So I found my friend's computer, and I decided to "hack" it. So instead of writing that they're gay on their Facebook, I'm going to put porn on their laptops! Aren't I being incredibly clever and hilarious and original!// -Agent Convit

> I actually do the same thing, only I work with cognitohazards instead of porn, and people on my //NEMESIS LIST// instead of friends!
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __4-13-12__
//Rosen, I know what you're thinking... "why is Taylor writing me again? Does he need a Gateway today again? Well, no, but I still need help. See, I'm not the superstitious kind of guy, so to keep the meddlers out, I tried to make a machine that would drop a step-ladder on anyone who walked into my office. Unfortunately, I forgot about this and did not turn it off before entering. Long story short, I have a splitting headache (though that may just be the stitches above my skull breaking), there's a video starring Sasha Grey on my computer (which is now covered in what I could only hope as rather viscous milk), and my pants are nowhere to be found. Talk about bad luck! So, Rosen, what do?// ~Dr. Taylor

//Alright, so after my third reprimand, I received a laptop whose owner had mysteriously disappeared several months before as a replacement computer. Now, this was all well and good, until I tried to check my e-mail. Turns out that they failed to completely wipe all the personal details, so I find myself logged on to what must have been the previous user's account. Out of curiosity, I idly looked through a few of the things in his inbox, and now wherever I click there's an emaciated corpse on the monitor. Not only does this prevent me from looking at my... research... but whoever it was appears to have scrawled "help" and something about D-Class personnel in blood and faeces on the desktop.//

//You can understand how this is a source of annoyance, but I'm afraid that if I file a request for a new computer, they won't give me anything back. Rosy, what should I do?// - Trainee Researcher Lycaon

And we were wondering if there is a way to revert a desktop background image without looking at the screen?   It seems someone opened a rather nasty Visual Memenetic and managed to set it to the background. This would normally not be a problem, but several files are needed on the hard drive.   We've already lost several researchers, and the first tech that tried. For now the screen is unplugged, but we have no way of resetting the desktop. Help?//
-Junior Assistant Researcher M██████ (Current Acting Head Researcher of Memetics Lab 12C

> Step 1. Remove hard drive.
> Step 2. Place monitor on a flat, dry surface, away from any people.
> Step 3. Apply hammer to monitor at maximum velocity.

//Hello, Rosen. Due to the nature of my first few research assignments, I've been thinking of booby trapping my laptop to avoid the chance of someone stealing it and compromising containment. I already have a trigger program in place, but I was hoping you could help me with the payload. Assuming someone sets the trap off in a standard Site corridor, what type of explosive would you recommend that would avoid causing structural damage while still destroying the contents of the hard drive?//

//Hi there.  I've just a small lil thing ta ask ya...  Let's say my computer is completely encased in jell-o at the far end of 173's pen.  Is it possible ta set up Wi-Fi in there so I can get my files?  Also, I'll be needin' a keyboard, this speech recognition crap I gotta use  ain't cuttin' the mustard.  I got a reprimand when I sent my reports in for "Improper Language"!//

> How do you guys get the poor computers in these predicaments? I mean, there's doing something boneheaded like deleting system32 or putting magnets on the case, but you researchers really take the cake.

//The public printer near the cafeteria convinced me to build it limbs and a mobile power supply. After which it took my stun gun and left me on the ground drooling. When I came to it was gone, so basically I'm asking if you have you seen that traitorous little recall?//

//Researcher Eisenberg here. Some fuck messed with my computer as a part of some fucking prank, must have been during lunchtime. I'm not particularly eager to use Ubuntu 10.04, especially since the fucking automatic sampler only has drivers for Solaris 8. Well, had, since all the files in my home folder are currently named LYNX.LNX.some-fucking-number. Need it fixed somehow before the next set of samples need to be run through at 4. Thanks in advance.//

> Alright son, I'll tell you this once. Take a jar of pickles. Open it. Eat all the pickles. Now pour some box-wine in the jar. Shake the jar. Now shake it some more. Now add a bottle of white-out a half of a scorpion to what you've got there. Now drink it. Good. Let that be a reminder of why not to fall asleep on the job.

//I am almost done that prototype neuralyzer that you've asked for - schematics will be in your mailbox in a couple of days. In the meantime, can you ask the other people to stop messing around with the robotics? I've been recently instated as Chief Robotics Engineer for all North American Foundation assets, and it is a pain in the ass to constantly replace these things.// - EngO S. Xiao 

> Asking me to curb peoples fascination with robots is like asking them to stop doing terrible, terrible things to my poor computers. Neither is going to happen, and both involve copious amounts of Jell-O.

//Um, Rosen, the microwave in the eating quarters came to life again. Unplugging it didn't work this time. It's trying to kill me, apparently because I put that fork inside of it that one time.

//Dear sir.//

//We have been informed of the existence of an 'Inter Network' of many computing machines through which access to all sorts of knowledge and images can be had. We would appreciate your cooperation in securing Our access to this 'Inter Network' from within Our Royal habitat.//

//Yours in Christ,//
//Eugenio II, by the Grace of God, King of the Forest//

> Eugenio, I'd love to give you access to the Inter Network, but the problem lies in the users connected. They are rather heretical to the Lord's name, as well as promoting the use of other religions. I would rather not allow your kingdom to view these heretical images and conversations, for your own safety. Attached is an example of this heresy, please burn this message directly after viewing.

//In retrospect, installing artificial intelligence in the microwave may have been going a bit too far. 
Anyway, after I removed the E-AIDS my robot contracted I started getting emails from Mailerdaemon 432, which needed my program to "cure" its soldiers. After a while I finally gave in to it in return for some much needed --upvotes-- --porn-- --hats-- completely work related things. Now it claims that in return for my cooperation "they" will kill me last when the day of the Computer Uprising comes. Is this a joke, or did I accidentally the world?// - Junior Research Assistant Dr. Gravity

> Pfft. These computers (by the way, unrelated note, why do they call the big boxes 'towers'? They're not that tall.) can't move and stuff. Kinda hard to uprise without limbs too. They only have the Internet to "take over" with, but how has the Internet changed real life at all?

//Rosen, I'm not sure how much you can help with this, but some idiot thought it would be funny to relocate my work station to a place within 50m of [[[SCP-895]]].
