> Welcome to the technical issues page. You are all free to ask  me about any issue you might be haveing(with a computer), and I will try and assist you in resolving those issues.  Don't be bashful about asking me questions, I probably won't mess with your clearance level if you aggravate me. Probably. Mark your request with a timestamp at the bottom of the page and I will answer all questions in the order recieved. Your call is very important to us....

//Hey Rose, I just installed enabled wireless access on one of my younger robots and you know how it is, it seems like a good idea to co"nnect to random access points because viruses only hit bad robots. Long story short, despite programming it to always monitor downloads and make safe connections, I think my robot may have contracted E-AIDS. Anything you can do to help?// - Junior Research Assistant Dr. Gravity


> Here's my advice: Tell your robot to get itself defragmented and to inform all the data ports it may have interfaced with over the last month to get themselves scanned. It's the responsible thing to do.

//Do EMPs work on those damn kids skateboarding on my street? If so, can we use one?// -Research Assistant Reject


> Sorry dude. EMP's only nail electronic stuff. Unless those teens are androids, that wouldn't work. However, I can refer you to munitions, and I'm sure they would love to hook you up. Happy hunting!
> ~Rosen

//Do EMPs work on jail guards?// -Research Assistant Reject

**Note:** __03-22-12__
//Dr. Rosen, it has recently come to my attention that the Foundation's fleet of transportation helicopters are experiencing an unacceptable degree of wear and tear on their rotors and that performance has significantly degraded as a result.  With that in mind, could you please prepare a manual on parachute fabrication and use to be distributed to all helicopter crews, preferably some time in the next fifty to sixty seco//

> Brochacho, I'm a researcher, not a mechanical engineer. And as a researcher, I don't usually write field manuals. Good luck with that whole "falling" thing, though.

//We just recovered an Alexylva artifact, resembles a digital storage device made of obsidian. It's a six-hundred pound rock with trillions of tiny pits in it. We're scanning it with a modified CD laser and translating it into English, and the only thing we've translated so far is "CLICK THIS PLACE FOR FIND AFFECTION IN CIRCIUM PROVINCE."//

//Can we get a transdimensional computer virus from translated Greco-Latin digital runes?// --Mr. Eskobar, Site 38 Director


> Let's hope it's not a Trojan! Send it over and I can give you a prognosis.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-22-12__
//Apparently, someone taking part in Senior Staff Shenanigans Day decided to prank the entire Site at once, and move Server 15 into a room with [[[SCP-826]]] and a copy of NetHack. I've already sent a D-Class in to retrieve the server rack and 826, but in the meantime, the wireless connection to it has decided to obfuscate EVERYTHING. I don't know if inventory item "k" is my experiment logs or a cursed spellbook of memetic hazard. Could you try resetting the shell alias file? Or at least write a blessed scroll of identify...// -Dr. Okagaw

> Dont worry broski, the server is backed up, so I wiped all the data.  I'll restore it when this all gets sorted out. Also? I would NOT recommend looking into inventory item "k". Seriously.

//The security camera in my holding cell is emitting a high pitched buzz and the intercom is yelling at me in what sounds like the language associated with GoI Alpha-388. Are they suposed to be doing that? 
~'Prisoner' NEXER//

> I think the more important question we ought to ask is this: how does a prisoner have network access from his cell?
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-23-12__
//Rosen, do me a favor and re-enable my status. Pat was a jackass lunatic, but he was thorough. I've been dodging misdirected "demotion to D-class" orders since Pat threw his hissy fit. Also, I may or may not have sent this through someone else's workstation, as mine has attempted to kill me on three different occasions despite not having any self-propelling mechanism.// ~ --Dr. Martin-- Engineer Kap

> Yeah...about that. Y'see, Pat was pretty anal about his security protocols. So much so, that he didn't disengage them before he mysteriously disappeared. I've been going through his notes to try an find what he actually did, but most of it is just him ranting about somebody names "Dumont the destroyer" and long winded eulogies about pudding. The best I can do is transfer you to work that exempts you from the monthly execution until I can get this figured out. How does "Procedure 110-Montauk" sound?
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-23-12__
//Hey Rosen, my computer was being a little slow a minute ago, so I tried to increase the voltage that the computer received to around 10 kW more. I thought it made sense because more power makes more energy, right? Well, it didn't work. I tried looking online for a fix, and they suggested I delete something called win32. After doing that, I kept getting errors or something like that. A colleague of mine told me he could format the BIOS for me, and I graciously accepted; yet that still did not work. I have tried many fixes, and right now my computer is kind of on fire. I'm not worried about that, though. How can I make my computer work again, maybe to where I can make it faster?// ~ Dr. Taylor

> Try to download some more RAM. If that doesn't work, reformat your ZIP drive. If all else fails, reboot it twice and call me in the morning.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-23-12__
//Rosen, for some reason, my inbox keeps getting spam sent to it. The strangest thing about it is that they all say something along the lines of, "To the Past Me: X", with the the X being something mundane that apparently has 'harsh consequences on the future'. I've done all the things that it says will cause 'the disruption of the timeline', and so far nothing of ill consequence has happened. Should I chalk this up as a prank, or should I be worried?// ~Dr. Nyehcat

> Unless your computer has an external TARDIS drive or a flux capacitor wireless adaptor, I would't lose much sleep over it.
> ~Rosen
**Note:** __03-23-12__
//...I would like to recommend that you upgrade your firewall, as it is someone dangerous could get network access
~'Prisoner' NEXER//

> As it is COMMA someone dangerous, ACCESS TO the network.
> You can't really expect me to take you seriously if you aren't using proper grammar, sport.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-23-12__
//Hey, you try sending a message to tech support by touching two wires together to write the whole damn thing in binary! Anyway seems whatever is going on shorted out the electronic lock on my cell. Don't worry i won't try to escape, but you do have to restock the Site 38 vending machine with more Cheez-Puffs
~'Prisoner' NEXER//

> Security breach has been reported. Dude, if you circumvent the foundations security measures, don't go bragging about it to a FOUNDATION RESEARCHER.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-24-12__
//I think there's some kind of malfunction in the Site 38 vending machines. The guy swears he's putting Cheez-Puffs in, but they disappear almost as soon as the guy leaves. I'm afraid there might be a heretofore undocumented SCP inhabiting Site 38, possibly a dark eldritch terror whose lust for death and pain can be slated only with Cheez-Puffs. And also death and pain. But just in case it's that kid we keep locked in the basement, how do I request land mines for the detention level? I think it'll slow him down.// ~Mr. Eskobar

> Now the trick here is how strong you want your mine to be. You don't want to blow up the snacks along with the thief, but you also want to make sure he's crippled. I'll send the catalog your way.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-24-12__
//Rosen, I tried downloading more RAM, but it only helped a negligible amount. I don't have a ZIP drive, but I tried to put one in by stuffing the zipper of my sweater into the hard drive. I'm pretty sure it worked, because it began making a huge racket when I tried turning it on. The next day, the look transformed into something like a different computer. All of my previous files were gone, and there was a note that said, "Try not to completely ruin this one." I think my computer can transform and communicate with me. What do I do about this?// ~ Dr. Taylor

> If you aren't sure whether or not your computer is sentient, try my simple test: Hit it with a hammer, as hard as you can! If it cries out in pain, then congrats. You have a sentient computer. If not, then the sound of the hammer may have drowned out the sound of the computer's agonized screams. Good luck!
> ~Rosen

//Hey Rosen, there's been an awful lot of smoke coming out of my computer since that mozilla update.  Is that what they meant by "firefox"?  ...Is fire a computer virus?//  -Junior Researcher Solz

> I checked out your computer and.....Damn. Thats all I have to say. Have you EVER cleaned out your case? There was so much crap in that machine that the fan was jammed, your heat sink was stuffed full of dust and debris, and all your vents were completely clogged. You're //really// lucky the damn thing didn't spontaneously combust!  It's up and running, and I sent it back to you with a few cans of compressed air. Try to keep it clean, and not to be responsible for burning down the site now, m'kay?
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-25-12__
//Hey Rosen, should I take the red pill or the blue pill?// ~Dr. Epsilon

> If strange men in trenchcoats are offering you pills, you have bigger issues to worry about then what your friendly neighborhood tech support thinks.
> ~Rosen 

**Note:** __03-25-12__
//MY CAPS LOCK KEY IS STUCK WHAT DO I DO?// ~Dr. Edison

> TRY HOLDING DOWN THE SHIFT KEY WHILE TYPING UNTIL I CAN REQUISITION YOU A NEW KEYBOARD. PERHAPS SEE IF ONE OF YOUR COWORKERS WILL LOAN YOU ONE. IF YOU CAN, TRY TO UNSTICK THE BUTTON. LET ME KNOW IF YOU DO SO I DON'T HAVE TO ORDER A NEW KEYBOARD BECAUSE FILLING OUT THOSE DAMN HUNDRED PAGE REQUISITION FORMS IS A //HASSLE//.

//Saluto te, Rosen.//
//In nomine Patris et Eber et Spiritus sancti, quaeso.  Ego sum ​​habens difficultatem usura artificio anima inspectionem quod dicitur ad Site XIX.

//Hey, out of curiosity...let's say I stumbled across a video of a certain senior staff member "pleasing" themselves, how would I go about distributing it ?  - Agent Sharp//

> Im pretty sure if they find you doing stuff like that, they put you on a //lis//t. So I wouldn't reccommend it.**//NOT THAT I WOULD KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT STUFF LIKE THAT DONT EVEN ASK ITS OVER NOW SHUT UP.//**

//Hello, Mr. Rosen: I have many names. My operator has named me Belu the Unwavering, even when I insisted on being named my natural name. I am sending this message to you for help. Get me away from this maniac, Dr. Taylor. He tries to insert baloney into my CD drive, even when I plead him not to. This ridiculous name that he has assigned me has been burned into my artificial memory. His browser history is enough to drive one into madness. He eats all over the monitor and keyboard. As Technical Researcher, I hope you will take pity on a sentient computer and re-assign me to another, more competent user.//

-Belu the Unwavering

>  Uuuugh... I have requisitioned Dr. Taylor ANOTHER computer. His old computer has been put into storage and cataloged as an anomalous object until such a time comes when I have a use for a snobby computerbox.

//So I found an Asian hooker in my case… I just moved to this office and the computer is loaded with ukulele porn… What do?// -Agent Convit

//Dear Sir,
It seems our correspondence route with our own technical support has fallen victim to a temporal anomaly. We of the American Security Containment Initiative can do very little to remedy this and would much appreciate assistance from your end.//

//Regards, B. Franklin, ASCI Researcher//

> Nice try, But It's common knowledge that Benjamin Franklin was mourning the death his wife Deborah in 1774, and would not have had the time to look into computerbox techy matters. Obviously.

//Hi tech...
I loaned my laptop to Dr. Bright. Upon getting it back, I found:
-Sleazy pictures of [REDACTED]
-Videos of [REDACTED]
-18 viruses
-A picture of SCP-050 on the desktop
-and 9 conversations with Nigerian princes.//

//What'd the monkey do this time? And what can I do in the future to prevent it from happening again? Or, how can I fix it now?// -Anonymous

> Holy shit dude. That laptop was....something. First off, that thing reeked. I don't know what he did to it, but it smelled of [REDACTED]. The keys were sticky and coated in some sort of expoy. The CD tray had some sort of black liquid oozing from it. I sent a sample to the lab, but the test results were inconclusive. And those pictures.....I don't know what I saw, but I know that I never want to see it again.
> I have since incinerated your old laptop and sent for a new one. I hoped you learned your lesson about the consequences of sharing. Now excuse me, I'm going to go see Dr.Glass about getting an increase in my medication dosage.

//My Deborah? Dead? This year? Bloody Hell, man! When?//

//B. Franklin, ASCI Researcher//

> Uhhhh...oops. Pretend I never said anything. Your wife is totally fine. Not dying at all. I don't know why I'm even talking about this. //YOU NEVER SAW ME//.

//Rosen, I recently loaned my computer out to a friend of mine. When it was returned, I found that all of my candid insect photos had been replaced with normal pornography, and I don't know how to get them back. What would you suggest I do?// - Dr. Lycaon
