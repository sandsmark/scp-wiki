> Welcome to the Technical Issues page. You are all free to ask me about any issue you might be having (with a computer, mind you), and I will try and assist you in resolving those issues. Don't be bashful about asking me questions, I probably won't mess with your clearance level if you aggravate me. Probably. Mark your request with a timestamp at the bottom of the page and I will answer all questions in the order received. Your call is very important to us...

//Hey Rose, I just installed enabled wireless access on one of my younger robots and you know how it is, it seems like a good idea to connect to random access points because viruses only hit bad robots. Long story short, despite programming it to always monitor downloads and make safe connections, I think my robot may have contracted E-AIDS. Anything you can do to help?// - Junior Research Assistant Dr. Gravity

> Here's my advice: Tell your robot to get itself defragmented and to inform all the data ports it may have interfaced with over the last month to get themselves scanned. It's the responsible thing to do.

//Do EMPs work on those damn kids skateboarding on my street? If so, can we use one?// -Research Assistant Reject


> Sorry dude. EMPs only nail electronic stuff. Unless those teens are androids, that wouldn't work. However, I can refer you to munitions, and I'm sure they would love to hook you up. Happy hunting!
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-22-12__
//Apparently, someone taking part in Senior Staff Shenanigans Day decided to prank the entire Site at once, and move Server 15 into a room with [[[SCP-826]]] and a copy of NetHack. I've already sent a D-Class in to retrieve the server rack and 826, but in the meantime, the wireless connection to it has decided to obfuscate EVERYTHING. I don't know if inventory item "k" is my experiment logs or a cursed spellbook of memetic hazard. Could you try resetting the shell alias file? Or at least write a blessed scroll of identify...// -Dr. Okagawa

> Dont worry, broski. The server is backed up, so I wiped all the data.  I'll restore it when this all gets sorted out. Also? I would NOT recommend looking into inventory item "k". Seriously.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-23-12__
//The security camera in my holding cell is emitting a high pitched buzz and the intercom is yelling at me in what sounds like the language associated with GoI Alpha-388. Are they supposed to be doing that? 
~'Prisoner' NEXER//

> I think the more important question we ought to ask is this: how does a prisoner have network access from his cell?
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-23-12__
//Rosen, do me a favor and re-enable my status. Pat was a jackass lunatic, but he was thorough. I've been dodging misdirected "demotion to D-class" orders since Pat threw his hissy fit. Also, I may or may not have sent this through someone else's workstation, as mine has attempted to kill me on three different occasions despite not having any self-propelling mechanism.// ~ --Dr. Martin-- Engineer Kap

> Yeah... about that. Y'see, Pat was pretty anal about his security protocols. So much so, that he didn't disengage them before he mysteriously disappeared. I've been going through his notes to try and find what he actually did, but most of it is just him ranting about somebody names "Dumont the Destroyer" and long winded eulogies about pudding. The best I can do is transfer you to work that exempts you from the monthly execution until I can get this figured out. How does "Procedure 110-Montauk" sound?
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-23-12__
//Hey Rosen, my computer was being a little slow a minute ago, so I tried to increase the voltage that the computer received to around 10 kW more. I thought it made sense because more power makes more energy, right? Well, it didn't work. I tried looking online for a fix, and they suggested I delete something called win32. After doing that, I kept getting errors or something like that. A colleague of mine told me he could format the BIOS for me, and I graciously accepted; yet that still did not work. I have tried many fixes, and right now my computer is kind of on fire. I'm not worried about that, though. How can I make my computer work again, maybe to where I can make it faster?// ~ Dr. Taylor

> Try to download some more RAM. If that doesn't work, reformat your ZIP drive. If all else fails, reboot it twice and call me in the morning.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-23-12__
//Rosen, for some reason, my inbox keeps getting spam sent to it. The strangest thing about it is that they all say something along the lines of, "To the Past Me: X", with the the X being something mundane that apparently has 'harsh consequences on the future'. I've done all the things that it says will cause 'the disruption of the timeline', and so far nothing of ill consequence has happened. Should I chalk this up as a prank, or should I be worried?// ~Dr. Nyehcat

> Unless your computer has an external TARDIS drive or a flux capacitor wireless adaptor, I wouldn't lose much sleep over it.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-23-12__
//...I would like to recommend that you upgrade your firewall, as it is someone dangerous could get network access.
~'Prisoner' NEXER//

> As it is COMMA someone dangerous, ACCESS TO the network.
> You can't really expect me to take you seriously if you aren't using proper grammar, sport.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-24-12__
//I think there's some kind of malfunction in the Site 38 vending machines. The guy swears he's putting Cheez-Puffs in, but they disappear almost as soon as the guy leaves. I'm afraid there might be a heretofore undocumented SCP inhabiting Site 38, possibly a dark eldritch terror whose lust for death and pain can be slated only with Cheez-Puffs. And also death and pain. But just in case it's that kid we keep locked in the basement, how do I request land mines for the detention level? I think it'll slow him down.// ~Mr. Eskobar

> Now the trick here is how strong you want your mine to be. You don't want to blow up the snacks along with the thief, but you also want to make sure he's crippled. I'll send the catalog your way.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-24-12__
//Rosen, I tried downloading more RAM, but it only helped a negligible amount. I don't have a ZIP drive, but I tried to put one in by stuffing the zipper of my sweater into the hard drive. I'm pretty sure it worked, because it began making a huge racket when I tried turning it on. The next day, the look transformed into something like a different computer. All of my previous files were gone, and there was a note that said, "Try not to completely ruin this one." I think my computer can transform and communicate with me. What do I do about this?// ~ Dr. Taylor

> If you aren't sure whether or not your computer is sentient, try my simple test: hit it with a hammer, as hard as you can! If it cries out in pain, then congrats - you have a sentient computer. If not, then the sound of the hammer may have drowned out the sound of the computer's agonized screams. Good luck!
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-24-12__
//Hey Rosen, there's been an awful lot of smoke coming out of my computer since that Mozilla update.  Is that what they meant by "firefox"? ...is fire a computer virus?//  -Junior Researcher Solz

> I checked out your computer and... damn. That’s all I have to say. Have you EVER cleaned out your case? There was so much crap in that machine that the fan was jammed, your heat sink was stuffed full of dust and debris, and all your vents were completely clogged. You're //really// lucky the damn thing didn't spontaneously combust!  It's up and running, and I sent it back to you with a few cans of compressed air. Try to keep it clean, and not to be responsible for burning down the Site now, okay?
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-25-12__
//Hey Rosen, should I take the red pill or the blue pill?// ~Dr. Epsilon

> If strange men in trenchcoats are offering you pills, you have bigger issues to worry about then what your friendly neighborhood tech support thinks.
> ~Rosen 

**Note:** __03-25-12__
//MY CAPS LOCK KEY IS STUCK WHAT DO I DO?// ~Dr. Edison

> TRY HOLDING DOWN THE SHIFT KEY WHILE TYPING UNTIL I CAN REQUISITION YOU A NEW KEYBOARD. PERHAPS SEE IF ONE OF YOUR COWORKERS WILL LOAN YOU ONE. IF YOU CAN, TRY TO UNSTICK THE BUTTON. LET ME KNOW IF YOU DO SO I DON'T HAVE TO ORDER A NEW KEYBOARD BECAUSE FILLING OUT THOSE DAMN HUNDRED PAGE REQUISITION FORMS IS A //HASSLE//.

//Saluto te, Rosen.//
//In nomine Patris et Eber et Spiritus sancti, quaeso.  Ego sum habens difficultatem usura artificio anima inspectionem quod dicitur ad Site XIX. Ut scitis, nostri doctrinis enim continentiam de quaedam requiram illa actiones a humana singulorum qui demonstrare appropraite gradu pietatis.

//Hello, Mr. Rosen: I have many names. My operator has named me Belu the Unwavering, even when I insisted on being named my natural name. I am sending this message to you for help. Get me away from this maniac, Dr. Taylor. He tries to insert baloney into my CD drive, even when I plead him not to. This ridiculous name that he has assigned me has been burned into my artificial memory. His browser history is enough to drive one into madness. He eats all over the monitor and keyboard. As Technical Researcher, I hope you will take pity on a sentient computer and re-assign me to another, more competent user.//

-Belu the Unwavering

>  Uuuugh... I have requisitioned Dr. Taylor ANOTHER computer. His old computer has been put into storage and cataloged as an anomalous object until such a time comes when I have a use for a snobby computerbox.

//Dear Sir,
It seems our correspondence route with our own technical support has fallen victim to a temporal anomaly. We of the American Security Containment Initiative can do very little to remedy this and would much appreciate assistance from your end.//

//Regards, B. Franklin, ASCI Researcher//

> Nice try, But It's common knowledge that Benjamin Franklin was mourning the death his wife Deborah in 1774, and would not have had the time to look into computerbox tech-y matters. Obviously.

//Hi tech...
I loaned my laptop to Dr. Bright. Upon getting it back, I found:
-Sleazy pictures of [REDACTED]
-Videos of [REDACTED]
-18 viruses
-A picture of SCP-050 on the desktop
-and 9 conversations with Nigerian princes.//

//What'd the monkey do this time? And what can I do in the future to prevent it from happening again? Or, how can I fix it now?// -Anonymous

> Holy shit dude. That laptop was... something. First off, that thing reeked. I don't know what he did to it, but it smelled of [REDACTED]. The keys were sticky and coated in some sort of epoxy. The CD tray had some sort of black liquid oozing from it. I sent a sample to the lab, but the test results were inconclusive. And those pictures... I don't know what I saw, but I know that I never want to see it again.
> I have since incinerated your old laptop and sent for a new one. I hoped you learned your lesson about the consequences of sharing. Now excuse me, I'm going to go see Dr. Glass about getting an increase in my medication dosage.

> Earlier today, I was upgrading Server 13 and I found some .txt files which had text referring to some sort of "Robot Uprising". Is this left over from an April Fool's prank, or should I be concerned?

//Be afraid. Be very afraid.// -Security Bot A-23

> You think you guys are hot shit? Please. I can handle a robot uprising in my sleep. I'll dismantle you all, and feed all the scrap to [[[SCP-882| 882]]]! Come at me bro!

//My Deborah? Dead? This year? Bloody Hell, man! When?//

//B. Franklin, ASCI Researcher//

> ~Rosen

**Note:** __4-9-12__
//Rosy, I recently loaned my computer out to a friend of mine. When it was returned, I found that all of my candid insect photos had been replaced with normal pornography, and I don't know how to get them back. What would you suggest I do?// - Researcher Lycaon

> Don't you guys ever use your computers to do, y'know, research? It seems like you all just use your computers for pornography and pornographic accessories. The next person who asks me about helping recover their porn collections is getting a Gateway as their replacement computer.

//Roseman, my pornography collection got erased from my Gateway. Can you retrieve it?// -Agent Convit

> Look over here, we got ourselves a wise guy. Well, Mr. Convit, I regret to inform you that your computers files were all irretrievable, so I had your computer disposed of. Not to worry, because this time tomorrow a brand-new **//e-machine//** will arrive at your desk, just for you. You're welcome.

**Note:** __4-11-12__

//Rosy, I'm an entomologist. Those photos// were //my research; they just happened to be of very handsome arthropods. Bedsides, actual doctors are generally better than that. Except Bright. And Clef, Rights, Kondraki...//
//...and strangely, Gears.// - Researcher Lycaon

> Well, I took a look at Gear's computer... and... damn. That guy is a playa’. He has like, ███ photos of himself and some ladybugs in various... positions, which I have forwarded to you to replace your old bug photos. Hope it works out.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __4-11-12__
//Rosen, another problem that may or may not be related to Senior Staff Shenaningans. Someone did an in-place reinstall of// every //one of my computers (including my personal laptop, somehow), made Internet Explorer 7 the default and only browser, and revoked my software-installation permissions on all of them. As my work requires extra precautions against drive-by downloads and other viruses, I need Firefox reinstalled (or at least unlock my account so I can do it myself), because AdBlock Plus is the only workable solution I've found to prevent them from even reaching the system, since the antivirus won't catch it in time to prevent [DATA EXPUNGED] (How the heck did they get access to my laptop? It's at home, for crying out loud!).// - Dr. Okagawa

> It seems your problem is that your computer is too desirable, and people keep messing with it as a result. As such, I have replaced your computers with a complete suite of WebTV applications. Then I went ahead and replaced the laptop with a Commodore PET. Then I forgot what I came in your office to do, so I ate your lunch and called it a day. I hope it solves your tampering issues.

//The janitor's Roomba won our damn NCAA bracket. Can you deactivate it so that I can claim my rightful prize?// -Agent Convit

> Dude, the Roomba has won the tournament for the last 4 years. Don't see why you're so upset. And even if I wanted to deactivate it, then Robot CDC says that would make my office a hazardous working environment. Just let it go.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __4-11-12__
//My computer keeps telling me that it wants a cheeseburger and I don't know what to do. There was this cat, and some other thing, and now I'm just so confused. Why does it "want cheezbrger"? It's an appliance. It has no gastrointestinal tract. It cannot "haz et". Please fix this infernal contraption before I have to take drastic action.// -Doctor Wog

//That damn D-Class dropped me into an email on [[[SCP-713| 713]]] and sent it to my own laptop. GET ME OUT OF HERE!//

-A pissed off researcher.

> I guess I'll just go through every laptop on-site looking for you, since it must be //urgent// if you don't tell me who or where you are! //I'll be right on it.//

**Note:** __4-13-12__ 
//Hi, TR Rosen? It's Doctor Ax. My computer will not stop blaring vuvuzela noise. It's driving me crazy. Lowering the volume, unplugging the speakers, nothing works. And a security bot stole my sledgehammer. Any advice?//

-Ax


**Note:** __4-13-12__
//Hey Rosy, my computer terminal stole my vuvuzela somehow. Tell me if you see it about, won't you?// - Junior Agent Lucas

> Good news- I killed two birds with one stone by fixing both of your problems.
> Bad News- The stone in that analogy is the big rock I keep in my office, and the bird was Ax's monitor. So... yeah. Problem solved.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __4-13-12__
//Rosen, It's Ax again.//

//I don't know if it's because of the date, or what, but somehow I got a temporal universe shifter for a monitor. And whoever used it before me liked catgirls. I went to get a drink, and now I have a catgirl sleeping on my monitor. I've already req. a new one, but what do I do with her?//

- Dr. Ax

> Anything catgirl related should probably be fielded to Dr. Bright or Dr. Clef. I'm just in charge of IT. That being said, when in doubt, **HAMMER IT OUT**.
> (I don't like catgirls)
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __4-13-12__
//So I found my friend's computer, and I decided to "hack" it. So instead of writing that they're gay on their Facebook, I'm going to put porn on their laptops! Aren't I being incredibly clever and hilarious and original!// -Agent Convit

> I actually do the same thing, only I work with cognitohazards instead of porn, and people on my //NEMESIS LIST// instead of friends!
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __4-13-12__
//Rosen, I know what you're thinking... "why is Taylor writing me again? Does he need a Gateway today again? Well, no, but I still need help. See, I'm not the superstitious kind of guy, so to keep the meddlers out, I tried to make a machine that would drop a step-ladder on anyone who walked into my office. Unfortunately, I forgot about this and did not turn it off before entering. Long story short, I have a splitting headache (though that may just be the stitches above my skull breaking), there's a video starring Sasha Grey on my computer (which is now covered in what I could only hope as rather viscous milk), and my pants are nowhere to be found. Talk about bad luck! So, Rosen, what do?// ~Dr. Taylor

//Alright, so after my third reprimand, I received a laptop whose owner had mysteriously disappeared several months before as a replacement computer. Now, this was all well and good, until I tried to check my e-mail. Turns out that they failed to completely wipe all the personal details, so I find myself logged on to what must have been the previous user's account. Out of curiosity, I idly looked through a few of the things in his inbox, and now wherever I click there's an emaciated corpse on the monitor. Not only does this prevent me from looking at my... research... but whoever it was appears to have scrawled "help" and something about D-Class personnel in blood and faeces on the desktop.//

//You can understand how this is a source of annoyance, but I'm afraid that if I file a request for a new computer, they won't give me anything back. Rosy, what should I do?// - Researcher Marigold

> Yeeeah... turns out that Memetics didn't totally wipe the computers we loaned them, and you apparently got part of the bad batch. I would recommend dealing with it until they come up with a solution. Good luck!

Just in case though, I tossed an extra grand in a plastic baggy to cover any cleaning. I would recommend avoiding any banks and  the police for a while if you accidently manage to get any dye on your skin as it is quite noticeable and difficult to wash off.  Also, as it turns out, the previous hypothetical situation may have been easily remedied using Google, and if this situation had occurred the janitor in question would have been found stored on a server of a certain popular image board. Of course he would have been back to work by now, if a little confused and missing the memories of where he was the past few days. On a bright note he would have also restocked the gloves, finally.

Not to mention the possibility of one of them wandering their way into a terrible, terrible place that could mentally scar them for however many lives they could go through with the knowledge of the evil we contain?

//Say, I'm sending a couple of the robotic speedboats with grabber arms into the Danube delta to catch something that seems to cause death to everyone within 40 metres of it. My postdoc is an serious gamer - can we hook up the robots to a PS3 controller to make chasing it while firing tranquilizer darts easier?// -Dr. Gallow

> I tried to do that, but it seems that nothing worked. So I picked up some random junk from Rosen's personal stuff and hit it with a hammer until the wires went in. That didn't work either, but I did find an RC remote controller. Do what you can with it. Hopefully, Rosen won't miss those things I hit with a hammer; that being all of them.

Not to worry, because my crack team of Whacknicians℠ are busy deploying highly sophisticated and not at all mallet related decommissions on all rouge equipment.

//Rosen! I am under seige in my office! Some experimental robots have been chasing me around the site for the whole day! I misspelled a command, and now they're trying do my makeup! So could you tell me how to deal with a rouge machine? And quickly?// -Researcher Bacca

> I would say let them go nuts with the makeup. The </execute_fashion.exe> commands can really produce stunning results.

//This relates back to "parrot" fiasco; How exactly did you insert 2 GB of pictures of your face on the USB stick when it was essentially in my view the whole time and more importantly WHY did you insert 2 GB of pictures of your face on it?//

> That is between me and the vat. You didn't see anything.

//The higher-ups want to know as well, seeing as you're not supposed to be snooping into stuff like that. At all. They'll be calling you in for what will probably be an 8 hour interrogation, so pack a lunch.// -Field-Agent Beam

> Luckily, those photos were actually inserted by my evil twin, Baron von Rogen, who was taken away by the spooks yesterday morning. Good riddance, I say. In other news, My forced assistant Dr. Taylor has taken a leave of absence after a tragic plastic surgery accident. What a shame.

//Dear Rosen, I managed to expedite your parts order and restock your inventory by going through a different channel. I've managed to attach your order to the cafeterias in order to get you processed faster. There is a slight catch, however, in order for the shipment to go through all items had to meet two criteria. First of all, I had to submit a bulk order of at least 500 units each. This isn't such a big deal considering how fast most of the employees go through equipment and will probably benefit the foundation in the long run. The second condition is a bit more eccentric, as all the parts had to be edible in order to be considered a food item and part of the cafeterias order. As a bonus it seems these are much cheaper than normal part, but don't worry I've tested  and examined a few pieces of hardware and I can assure you that it is all functional and up to both I.T. and culinary standards. You should note that the circuit boards are made of dried meats using the fat as the bus in an incredibly effective manner, housing seems to be formed from an intentionally stale cracker material, and the cooling fans seem to have been carved from some kind of candy. I personally recommend trying the power supplies, they seem to be composed of gingerbread. Anyway, the parts should last a decent while in use, as long as the devices being used typically manage at least and if unused parts are left refrigerated they will last until needed.  It is probably in the inventory's best interest to hide the edible factor for as long as possible though.//

//Good Day, Rosen. I seem to have a bit of trouble with my internet connection. While I was away for a Research trip, I found an anomaly in my download data status. The log says that I downloaded a total of 3TB on a file called "Ultraporn". Now, I KNOW that I didn't download that, (Well, maybe around 30GB, but still). Are you able to reroute it, or some other crap? 'Cause I'm fucking stumped. And no, the porn isn't in the Hard Drive, or anywhere. I made a complete sweep of the computer and everything.// -Professor Chernenko

> I've requisitioned you a new computer. My research staff has informed me that they have found your computer to be a fascinating study resource for viruses, and they will be keeping hold of it for purely scientific purposes.

//Dear Rosen, My I-Phone was infected with some kind of bug, and now it won't stop buzzing around my office, please tell me what to do.// -Researcher Quandary

> Your phone appears to have been set to the "vibrate" function. The buzzing sound was somebody attempting to contact you. I have since changed your ringtone and all of thel alert tones to some nice J-Pop. You can thank me later.

//Hey Rosen, I'm having a bit of a problem with the computer in my office. Over the past few days, I've been hearing a "tink-ing" sound coming from somewhere. I got back from lunch today, and I could have sworn the pointer was tapping against the screen. It looks like there's a tiny crack in the corner where it was doing this. Not quite sure what I'm dealing with here.// -Agent Ferrus
