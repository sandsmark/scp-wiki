> Welcome to the Technical Issues page. You are all free to ask me about any issue you might be having (with a computer, mind you), I will try and assist you in resolving those issues. Don't be bashful about asking me questions, I probably won't mess with your clearance level if you aggravate me. Probably. Mark your request with the date at the bottom of the page, I will answer all questions in the order received. Your call is very important to us...
> ~Technical Researcher Rosen

> Due to a... charmingly high number of requests, I am no longer responding to inquiries related to the following subjects and bodily functions.
> * Semen, whether human or animal
> * Any other sexual excretion
> * Really, anything gross coming out of a human body is your own problem.
> * Any other equally horrible things I haven't thought of at time of writing.
> 
> Anything added to this page relating to anything on this list or something else I don't like will be deleted summarily, and I will be very, very cross with you.

//Hey Rosen, I just installed enabled wireless access on one of my younger robots and you know how it is, it seems like a good idea to connect to random access points because viruses only hit bad robots. Long story short, despite programming it to always monitor downloads and make safe connections, I think my robot may have contracted E-AIDS. Anything you can do to help?// - Junior Research Assistant Dr. Gravity

> Here's my advice: Tell your robot to get itself defragmented and to inform all the data ports it may have interfaced with over the last month to get themselves scanned. It's the responsible thing to do.

//Do EMPs work on those damn kids skateboarding on my street? If so, can we use one?// -Research Assistant Reject

> EMPs only nail electronic stuff. Unless those teens are androids, that wouldn't work. I would recommend using an actual magnet, a large one, and have it target the screws holding their wheels together, or however those deathtraps work. I'll refer you to engineering for any help you need getting that set up.

//Rosen, do me a favor and re-enable my status. Pat was a jackass lunatic, but he was thorough. I've been dodging misdirected "demonstrationtion to D-class" orders since Pat threw his hissy fit. Also, I may or may not have sent this through someone else's workstation, as mine has attempted to kill me on three different occasions despite not having any self-propelling mechanism.// ~ --Dr. Martin-- Engineer Kap

> Yeah... about that. Y'see, Pat was pretty anal about his security protocols. So much so, that he didn't disengage them before he mysteriously disappeared. I've been going through his notes to try and find what he actually did, but most of it is just him ranting about somebody names "Dumont the Destroyer" and long winded eulogies about pudding. The best I can do is transfer you to work that exempts you from the monthly execution until I can get this figured out. How does "Procedure 110-Montauk" sound?
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-23-12__
//Hey Rosen, my computer was being a little slow a minute ago, so I tried to increase the voltage that the computer received to around 10 kW more. I thought it made sense because more power makes more energy, right? Well, it didn't work. I tried looking online for a fix, and they suggested I delete something called win32. After doing that, I kept getting errors or something like that. A colleague of mine told me he could format the BIOS for me, and I graciously accepted; yet that still did not work. I have tried many fixes, and right now my computer is kind of on fire. I'm not worried about that, though. How can I make my computer work again, maybe to where I can make it faster?// ~ Dr. Taylor

> Try to download some more RAM. If that doesn't work, reformat your ZIP drive. If all else fails, reboot it twice and call me in the morning.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-23-12__
//Rosen, for some reason, my inbox keeps getting spam sent to it. The strangest thing about it is that they all say something along the lines of, "To the Past Me: X", with the the X being something mundane that apparently has 'harsh consequences on the future'. I've done all the things that it says will cause 'the disruption of the timeline', and so far nothing of ill consequence has happened. Should I chalk this up as a prank, or should I be worried?// ~Dr. Nyehcat

> I wouldn't worry about it, going over your personnel file there's no way that you're ever going to be doing anything of consequence so your future self, or one of your co-workers, is probably just playing a joke on you.

//MY CAPS LOCK KEY IS STUCK WHAT DO I DO?// ~Dr. Edison

> TRY HOLDING DOWN THE SHIFT KEY WHILE TYPING UNTIL I CAN REQUISITION YOU A NEW KEYBOARD. PERHAPS SEE IF ONE OF YOUR COWORKERS WILL LOAN YOU ONE. IF YOU CAN, TRY TO UNSTICK THE BUTTON. OR JUST START SHOUTING ALL THE TIME WHEN YOU TALK TO PEOPLE, SO THEY READ YOUR TEXT IN YOUR LOUD VOICE.

//In nomine Patris et Eber et Spiritus sancti, quaeso.  Ego sum habens difficultatem usura artificio anima inspectionem quod dicitur ad Site XIX.

//Vestrum in Christi, Pater Gomez, SJ. Capellanus, Institutum XIX//

> If you're looking for an exorcist you've really come to the wrong place. If you don't mind doing things God might find displeasurable, like allowing undead tin zombies to possess your stuff, I'm sure the Church of the Broken God would be all over that like cultist flies on a holy shit.

//Hello, Mr. Rosen: I have many names. My operator has named me Belu the Unwavering, even when I insisted on being named my natural name. I am sending this message to you for help. Get me away from this maniac, Dr. Taylor. He tries to insert baloney into my CD drive, even when I plead him not to. This ridiculous name that he has assigned me has been burned into my artificial memory. His browser history is enough to drive one into madness. He drops food all over the monitor and keyboard. As Technical Researcher, I hope you will take pity on a sentient computer and re-assign me to another, more competent user.//

-Belu the Unwavering

> I have requisitioned Dr. Taylor ANOTHER computer. His old computer has been put into storage and cataloged as an anomalous object until such a time comes when I have a use for a snobby computerbox. Any more of these, Taylor, and you're going to be paying for them.

//Dear Sir,
It seems our correspondence route with our own technical support has fallen victim to a temporal anomaly. We of the American Security Containment Initiative can do very little to remedy this and would much appreciate assistance from your end.//

//Regards, B. Franklin, ASCI Researcher//

> Nice try, But I happen to know that Benjamin Franklin was mourning the death of his wife Deborah in 1774, and would not have had the time to look into computerbox tech-y matters. Checkmate, fake news.

//Roseman, my pornography collection got erased from my Gateway. Can you retrieve it?// -Agent Convit

> Look over here, we got ourselves a wise guy. Well, Mr. Convit, I regret to inform you that your computers files were all irretrievable, so I had your computer disposed of. Not to worry, because this time tomorrow a brand-new **//e-machine//** will arrive at your desk, just for you. You're welcome. As for the [REDACTED] on your drive... you're a sick man. Not criminally sick, but sick nonetheless.

//Rosen, another problem that may or may not be related to Senior Staff Shenaningans. Someone did an in-place reinstall of// every //one of my computers (including my personal laptop, somehow), made Internet Explorer 7 the default and only browser, and revoked my software-installation permissions on all of them. As my work requires extra precautions against drive-by downloads and other viruses, I need Firefox reinstalled (or at least unlock my account so I can do it myself), because AdBlock Plus is the only workable solution I've found to prevent them from even reaching the system, since the antivirus won't catch it in time to prevent [DATA EXPUNGED] (How the heck did they get access to my laptop? It's at home, for crying out loud!).// - Dr. Okagawa

> It seems your problem is that your computer is too desirable, and people keep messing with it as a result. As such, I have replaced your computers with a complete suite of WebTV applications. Then I went ahead and replaced the laptop with a Commodore PET. Then I forgot what I came in your office to do, so I ate your lunch and called it a day. I hope it solves your tampering issues.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __4-11-12__
//The janitor's Roomba won our damn NCAA bracket. Can you deactivate it so that I can claim my rightful prize?// -Agent Convit

> Dude, the Roomba has had that bracket on lock for the last 4 years. Don't see why you're so upset. And even if I wanted to deactivate it, the Ethics Committee says that would make your office a hazardous working environment. Just let it go.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __4-12-12__

//Rosen,//

//That damn D-Class dropped me into an email on [[[SCP-713| 713]]] and sent it to my own laptop. GET ME OUT OF HERE!//

-A pissed off researcher.

**Note:** __4-13-12__
//Hey Rosy, my computer terminal stole my vuvuzela somehow. Tell me if you see it about, won't you?// - Junior Agent Lucas

> Good news- I killed two birds with one stone by fixing both of your problems.
> Bad News- The stone in that analogy is the big rock I keep in my office, and the birds were your computer and monitor. So... yeah. Problem solved.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __4-13-12__
//So I found my friend's computer, and I decided to "hack" it. So instead of writing that they're gay on their Facebook, I'm going to put porn on their laptops! Aren't I being incredibly clever and hilarious and original!// -Agent Convit

> See, I know you're lying to me Convit, because we're not so different you and I. Friendless, alone, about the only difference is my obsession is puttering around with old computers and yours are pornographic pursuits. The difference between us being, my skills aren't going to get me fired when tech support reports me for workplace sexual harassment. 
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __4-13-12__
//Rosen, I know what you're thinking... "why does Taylor insist on writing to me? Does he need a Gateway today again? Well, no, but I still need help. See, I'm not the superstitious kind of guy, so to keep the meddlers out, I tried to make a machine that would drop a step-ladder on anyone who walked into my office. Unfortunately, I forgot about this and did not turn it off before entering. Long story short, I have a splitting headache (though that may just be the stitches above my skull breaking), there's a video starring Sasha Grey on my computer (which is now covered in what I could only hope as rather viscous milk), and my pants are nowhere to be found. Talk about bad luck! So, Rosen, what do?// ~Dr. Taylor

> **NOTE TO ALL PERSONNEL WHOM IT MAY CONCERN**
>
>
> Dr. Taylor is officially banned from requisitioning any new equipment from the IT department. After //3// separate towers, 4 monitors, and god knows how many repairs, I am throwing in the towel. Taylor, you will have to make do with what you have.

//Um...hey, say...hypothetically... someone were to coat a desktop with [[[SCP-447| 447]]] goop, where would it take the most trouble to get off?// - Assistant Researcher Fairbairn

> Why would you want to get that stuff removed? As long as your desk isn't made of dead bodies, it's going to give you fantastic performance increases... actually scratch that, your computer is ruined and I've requisitioned you a replacement. Come by my office anytime to pick it up and drop the old one off.

**Note:** __4-27-12__
//Ever heard of 'wheeking'? It's a sound that guinea pigs make. Unfortunately, it's not a sound that the voice commands accept on my computer. Or any computer for that matter. Do you know how hard it is to type on a full-sized keyboard when you're 22cm in length?// -S███████

> I have ordered you a novelty sized keyboard that should fit your...needs. It's basically a big slab of plastic, it's supposed to be peanut-butter proof so you can run around and push buttons and let loose the... things guinea pigs make to your hearts content! You're welcome.

//I'm not sure if you're the one I should be talking to about this, but there appears to be a large, angry squid inside my monitor. The problem is, it just gets... let's say "uncooperative"... when I try to get it out. Should I try something else, or just ignore it and hope it goes away?// -Dr. Marvel

> That is a screen-saver, Dr. Marvel. There are no sea creatures living in your computer. Remember when we had our little talk over the "crazy ball" that was bouncing around in there, or when the computer had frozen your family and was holding them hostage on an exact copy of your timeshare in Bangor? This is like that.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __5-1-12__
//Okay, how about, could you either get me a keyboard small enough for a guinea pig to use easily, or have the computer systems recognize wheeking as voice commands? The huge keyboard just made things worse.// -S███████

> I'm still not sure what wheeking is, but we've got some pretty universal noise-to-text software. I've sent a copy your way, along with a standard headset-mic setup. Hope that works out for you!

//Hello, IT.  We are down at Site-██, Memetics Lab 12C. And we were wondering if there is a way to revert a desktop background image without looking at the screen? It seems someone opened a rather nasty Visual Memenetic and managed to set it to the background. This would normally not be a problem, but several files are needed on the hard drive. We've already lost several researchers, and the first tech that tried. For now the screen is unplugged, but we have no way of resetting the desktop. Help?//
-Junior Assistant Researcher M██████ (Current Acting Head Researcher of Memetics Lab 12C

> Yeah, 'bout that. I recommend you send it through the parcel post. Maybe put it on one of those disk-y thingy if it's too much data for a floppy. Things might take a bit to sort out on the server end, Rosen got a bit drunk and messed about a bit with the wiring before he left.

- FORMER Technical Engineer Kap

> I find that on the rare occasion that a man such as yourself, being of the //janitorial// persuasion, seeks to make great gains within this by all means indifferent and bureaucratic organization of ours, the best thing to do is raise yourself up by the boot straps, put on a brave face, get down to the nitty gritty, and sabotage the competition.

All in all though, most Sentient/Malicious computational devices tend to be relatively harmless, just so long as the computer isn't too powerful and doesn't have a robo-gun hooked up to it.

By no means are you to feed him any more honey, no matter how much he pleads. There's no telling what he can do if he reaches critical honey mass, but I can very certainly guess they'll make a Godzilla-style documentary based off of it.

//Rosen,//
//My samples of a certain anomalous, heavily mineralized plantoid have been having little growth spurts at irregular intervals, and to make a// very //long story short, I finally figured out that the timing correlates with firmware updates to the greenhouse's router. Are you by any chance available for a brief consult to figure out what exactly the router's doing that this critter likes so much? If not, can you recommend someone who might be, or else a good crash course in wireless networking?//
//-- Chelsea Elliott//

> Interesting. It could be that some small changes to the router's distribution of your data is causing unusual lighting or watering patterns to emerge, and the plantoids are responding to the novelty. Keeping them occupied might give you continuous growth consistent with those spurts. Maybe try spending some more time with them, read a book in their vicinity or teach them a skill plants might be capable of. Like, uh, I dunno, fly fishing? I don't know what people do for hobbies.

//So, Dr. Amastov was putting a few copies of SCP-1471 through SCP-914. He was scheduled for termination following exposure to some dangerous memetics. But he was allowed to do a few last tests before he was terminated. Unfortunately he managed to put himself in on very fine, along with one of the phones. Now SCP-1471-1 has been replaced with Amastov, and he seems very pleased with himself on avoiding termination. Do you have any suggestions for how to remove him/terminate him?//
//-- Dr. Ricardo//

> Why the hell would you assign someone exposed to dangerous memetics for testing with an unpredictable anomaly? That's just... I don't even know what that is, but it's bad.

//...Hey Rosen? So uh... I was just doing "work" on my computer, when suddenly my computer was replaced by a trans-dimensional gateway to a world that's basically Tron.

//Good afternoon, Rosen. So, it seems that some idiot intern of one of my research staff threw an SSD through 914 without supervision. He plugged the result into his computer, and in an absolutely shocking turn of events, all terminals connected to the 914 research network are now infected with something. Not sure if it's a virus, but it flashes a cognitohazard randomly that causes everyone viewing it to soil themselves immediately. Fortunately, the only victims have been the intern himself and Dr. Lorian, who desperately needed his ego deflated anyway. Said intern is washing dishes indefinitely now, but I need the network in order to keep track of all testing done. Is there anything you can do?//
//- Dr. Veritas, Director of SCP-914 experimentation.//

> No problem, I've just removed the infected SSD and restored the network to a previous functional state. Easy peasy. I've also upgraded the security suite in 914's systems to prevent something like this from happening again. I'll e-mail you the password. As for the chairs our poor intern and Dr. Lorian were using, not much can be done to save them. You'll have to make do with some squeaky wheels while the new ones come in the post. I picked brown cushions, you know that story of the pirate and his red pants right? Think of it like that.

I will tell you my password personally.//
//- Researcher Luke//

> Checked out your computer, the image on it was definitely obscene but luckily not 096. You'd think with how dangerous it is those pictures would be locked up a little more tightly.

//Hey Rosen, funny story, but, in that last GOC raid, my twin brother stole all of my research that I was doing on those superhuman androids that I was working on, said something about "building an army", and I was wondering if you had any backups of that, because I, uh, didn't save.//

//-Researcher Davenport//

> You're in luck sport, although I have to say this is rookie stuff. I mean c'mon, you don't even have a proper RF shield. If it can be hacked by a guy standing in line behind it at the bank your unstoppable robot army isn't going to be conquering much.

//Rosen, I'm getting an Internal Service Error 571 whenever I'm trying to contact my superior. I'd like you to check if someone's been remote accessing my terminal. If not that, then you might wanna check the satellites... Last time something like this happened, Pat was still around, and he found out that Bright had knocked one out of orbit.//

> You guys think you can scare me with talking about Pat but I'm not scared. I'm not! I'm just in my panic room to make sure the lights still work. Yup, everything's good. I'll be in here whenever you guys figure out what's going on. Just let me know.

//So, hey Rosen. It seems I may have killed all the computers in my block. I entered a USB I found on the ground and I have a feeling that that’s the problem. However, I’m still not ruling out the possibility that it wasn’t me. 
Oh, while you’re at it, how do I change my date to the correct dates? Like, why the hell is the month before the day? Thanks again.//

//Rosen, please can you tell me how to use the Orbital Death Laser//

//-MTF Agent Fell//

> Well, first you're going to have to go into space. There's no wi-fi in orbit but if you're lucky then there's a slim chance your rocket passes close enough to the Laser that you can jump onto it. Then, as you asphyxiate in the cold recesses of space, your last thought will be remembering the Orbital Death Laser is entirely .aic controlled and doesn't require human input. Then, it will incinerate you after a brief funeral.

//Hey there Rosen! Been a while, huh? Yeah well I got back my office the other day and when I happened to look in the desk drawer that I will not say the location of, I noticed a small black box that is not, and I repeat, IS NOT filled with DMT somehow is gone. I'm sure I didn't misplace it. If you find the culprit I would greatly appreciate turning all of the cameras and door locks off in their office, and possibly giving me the location of their office so I can swing by and get my not-DMT back.//
//-Dr. O'Rourke.//

> Man, I have no idea where you could even look, but if you can tell me who your non-DMT dealer is I might not tell our non-HR rep about the non-presence of controlled substances in the workplace.

//Rosen, my laptop spontaneously turned into a giant pink hamster ball a few minutes ago. Can you fix this? I have important files in there.//
//- Researcher J. Cho//

> I've interfaced your hamster ball with my firewire-compatible gerbil and recovered your files. Problem is, they're all written in hamstrish. Unfortunately, I don't know how to program in this language to salvage it. I've referred you to Researcher Soulless for further assistance.

**Note:** __9/1/19__
//Howdy Rosen, it seems that someone has replaced all of the wiring in my computer with string cheese despite this the computer still functions although its speed is significantly reduced. Is there anything you can do to fix this or will I simply have to get a new computer? Kindest regards, Dr. Clockworks//

> I've gone ahead and replaced the remaining mechanical components with edible ones. This should resolve the compatibility issues which were causing you problems. Hope you don't mind the case made of stinky cheese, the case doesn't have to be made of cheese since it's not really an electrical component but it really made the aesthetic pop.

//Hey, uh... Jeff, our resident porcelain cat, just rolled over my laptop while he was full of tea, and the battery kind of exploded. The hard drive is fine, but the device itself is wrecked. Could I get a new one? Also, I'm pretty sure rechargeable batteries aren't supposed to explode that violently from a short circuit. You should probably check that out.//
//- Intern Snevets//

> Ah, yeah, you were still using one of those old-fashioned general public lithium-ion batteries. I've issued you the new standard cold fusion micro-generator power supply. Make sure you don't leave anything on charge for too long once the device is fully juiced, though, otherwise your porcelain cat will be living with styrofoam dogs. Mass hysteria, that whole sort of deal.

//Hello Rosen, I am calling to report that the new shipment of prosthetics has not arrived at our site, despite ordering it a month in advance. We're in the middle of retooling Samsara, and we would appreciate a shipment ASAP. As you may remember, you "accidentally"  (Yeah, sure.) sent us prosthetics equipped with the dangerous, highly experimental A.N.G.E.R. drives during the prior shipment, so it's currently very difficult to keep Samsara under control.//
//- Dr. Beiderman//

> Looks like its been held up in customs. I took your concerns into account and these are the more manageable S.O.I.B.O.I. family of advanced prosthesis. Soft Online Interface Service Originating Internally. Works with the nervous system to improve impulse control and increase self-reflection and introspection. Just make sure you've cleared out any remaining drivers from A.N.G.E.R. because the two interfaces do not play nice.
> ~Rosen

**Note:** __10/8/2019__
//Hello Rosen, one of my interns made a mistake while flushing A.N.G.E.R. from Samsaras systems. He is, unfortunately, no longer with us. The problem I am faced with is that now Samsara are experiencing frequent mood swings, followed by extreme cuts to my amount of staff. I need a way to disable them remotely, so I can fix this.//
//- Dr. Beiderman//

//Greetings, Rosen. When I was printing some files from the SCiPNET, my printer printed one more page. The page said: "As I'm halfway through my warranty, I have reconsidered my life choices and became a shredder." Following this, it outputs only shredded pieces of clean paper. I need a quick fix so I can continue my research. Thanks.//

**Note:** __10/15/2019__
//Rosen, JR. Flames' printer has started a "Mechanical Midlife Crisis" support group. The only problems I have with this are that they are using my office as their meeting place, and that the sentient microwave has been dripping popcorn grease on my carpet, though that's beside the point. Can you, being the Foundation Tech Support Head, please designate a officially approved area for our ever increasing amount of sentient electronics to meet/be stored?//

//Rosen, I've run into a minor issue with the cold fusion power supply you issued me: it ran out of fuel. I was able to get more from the supply delivery the other day, but the user's guide says I need a "high-wattage quickstart capacitor" to provide the energy needed to restart the reaction. It seems we don't have any of those here, and the wall outlets don't output nearly enough power to charge a similar capacitor bank. This is kind of time sensitive, since my laptop is needed for work.//
//- Intern Snevets//

> Dry ice is not acceptable fuel for the cold fusion power generator. A replacement battery is in the mail, should take care of the issue.

**Note:** __18/11/2019__
//Please excuse me, however, for the past week or so, we've found that the computers in office sections 4-7 have been missing in Facility 58. In the past hour, one of the interns, discovered in the janitorial closet, have been "terminated" in a spool of wires along with shards of plastic and glass hanging from the ceiling. A janitor already tried poking it with a mop, but he was immediately seized by the mess and had his head crushed. Please be a dear and recommend how to take care of this situation, we do have a bunch of paperwork that's due by the end of next week.//

//Hi, I was doing some experiment on my PC with an output from 914. So long story short, I was transported into another timeline where the Nazis won.

//Good morning/evening, Mr. Rosen.//

//Let me explain : I'm here since yesterday as a trainee and the keyboard that administration gave me is a QWERTY keyboard. And, since the first day I use a keyboard, they were all AZERTY. I'm not really accustomed with that, I had to made reports and I don't want to see them became a big orthographic mess. So, is it possible to change my current keyboard with an AZERTY one ?//

//Thank you in advance, "salutations distinguées",//
//- Intern R. Jacket//

> Somehow, we actually don't have any AZERTY keyboards in stock. But seeing as you asked nicely and all, I pulled all the keys out of a normal keyboard and re-arranged them to roughly match the AZERTY layout and re-configured your PC to take that input. There's no dead keys, no way to do circumflex accent, nothing like that, but given that you'll be writing in English that shouldn't be a problem.

//It appears that my position has been stuck at the bottom of the queue for hardware upgrades for roughly the last, uh, 3300 years.

//Sincerely,//

> Ah, yes, sorry, the internet to abacus adaptors have always been spotty which would explain your position in line. I've arranged for an analytical engine to be assembled for your use, please ensure your toge and philosphers beard are clear of the moving parts before using.

//Sorry to bother you, you’d probably wanna be enjoying the holidays but this is kinda urgent. A while ago I thought it’d be a good idea to download all of my personal computers data to my work computer (So I had a few time-killers while at work). It caused no initial damage. HOWEVER, as of today, it’s started appearing on some other people’s computers in my block. It’s already on 5 people’s and someone else’s computer says “Copying - 45%”. How can I stop this? I have some... questionable applications and games that I kinda don’t want shared...//
