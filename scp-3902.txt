**Description:** SCP-3902 is a nut and chocolate nutrition bar with packaging resembling an edited version of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/classification-committee-memo the Anomaly Classification System]. This packaging advertises SCP-3902 as "anomaly class bar" created by the para-entrepreneur "[http://www.scp-wiki.net/dado-hub dado]". 30 minutes after SCP-3902 is fully consumed, the subject will expel a piece of paper from their mouth[[footnote]]Other orifices have been recorded.[[/footnote]] listing several statements about the subject each in a format resembling SCP Foundation Object Class Designation. 

Statements recorded are universally correct and/or will be correct. Once any individual has read the paper fully, several bones, organs, or objects of monetary value present on the subject will disappear. These disappearances are described in the expelled paper. 

**Discovery:** SCP-3902 was discovered after spontaneously replacing Skittles in all Foundation vending machines on 8/22/19. Along with this, a box of 100 SCP-3902 instances was recovered under the desk of Site-81 Director Jean Karlyle Aktus alongside the following note:
