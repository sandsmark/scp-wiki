**Item#:** SCP-3401

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3401 is contained in a standard anomalous item locker.

**Description:** SCP-3401 is a small dark brown clay teapot, measuring 11cm in height and 17cm in length.

SCP-3401's anomalous effects manifest when a small portion of human ash, approximately equivalent to a single teaspoon is placed into SCP-3401 and then filled with boiled water. Ashes placed inside SCP-3401 will begin to infuse with the boiled water in a manner consistent to fermented tea leaves. The water will experience a change in colour and gain a particular scent depending on the ashes.

After 2-3 minutes, the water inside SCP-3401 will take a quasi-liquid form, coated in a thin clear membrane consistent with vegetable oil. In this state, the resulting ‘brew’ will resemble a miniaturised limp human body, resembling the individual of the respected ashes used (SCP-3401-1). SCP-3401-1 instances are intricately detailed, portraying minor features of the individual, such as finger/toe nails, hair and wrinkles. SCP-3401-1 will behave partly as a single liquid mass, separating only when manipulated feasibly by exterior sources. Closer examination of SCP-3401-1 instances reveal a faint sound emanating from them, resembling a heart beat. 

SCP-3401-1 may be drank and is often described as having a consistency similar to hot tea and watery jelly. SCP-3401-1 each have their own distinguishing taste depending on the persons ashes used, often being a complex mixture not limited to but including, average tea flavours. In all cases, SCP-3401-1 instances have been reported as having a flavour barring similarities to the respected persons cause of death[[footnote]]Allergic reaction to almonds: slight nutty taste, death by burning: smokey, drowning: sea air and fish, homicide: decaying wood, iron and compost.[[/footnote]].

A mixture of ashes to brew SCP-3401-1 is possible, however the produced instance will appear as a physically deformed fusion of the respected bodies, and is described as tasting of blood and various other bodily fluids.
