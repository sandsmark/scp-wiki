**Item #:** SCP-485

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-485 is to be kept in a locked safe-deposit box at all times with the key to be kept in a secure location.

**Description:** SCP-485 appears to be a standard retractable pen with an unusually easy to click button. The pen itself was accidentally stolen by an SCP agent renewing his life insurance policy. The pen once belonged to Agent ████████ of ████ Life Insurance inc. Each time the pen's tip is extended, a random person known to the user dies by an unknown cause. Since the button is abnormally smooth, many successive clicks in a row were recorded during preliminary tests. The phenomena exhibited by the pen's action was only discovered by a Class-D personnel whose social awkwardness and preclusion toward avoiding human contact only caused him to personally know approximately 39 people. Said personnel successfully dispatched upwards of 90% of the remaining test subjects on hand, as they had all been selected from the same dormitory wing on-base. Procedure for obtaining live testing personnel has been updated to require more randomization in the selection process.

**Addendum:** Due to Dr. Dahij's recent personal tragedy involving nearly all of his friends and family, SCP-485 is hereby remanded to off-person custody in a locked safe-deposit box.

//**Note:** At least he's stopped that damn infernal clicking at all hours at his desk...//
