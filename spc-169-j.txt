**Item #:** [[[scp-169|SPC-169]]]

**Object Class:** Megalodon

**Shark Punching Contingencies:** Due to its immense size, direct punching of SPC-169 will prove impractical. As such, Project Ahab has been established for the full-scale pugilization of SPC-169. 

Project Ahab consists of simultaneous Dreadnought-class punchery from five separate sources in the southern Atlantic Ocean:

# **Ahab-1 "Fist of Neptune":** 50 satellites currently located in stationary orbit over critical points of SPC-169's anatomy. These satellites are capable of releasing 100kg tungsten-osmium sculptures of fists into Earth's atmosphere, which will use the natural acceleration of Earth's gravity to punch SPC-169 at terminal velocity.
# **Ahab-2 "Fist of Triton":** Ten volleys of 20 intercontinental ballistic missiles modified for shark-punching purposes with Kaiju-grade Doomfist tips.
# **Ahab-3 "Fist of Calypso":** Two-stage operation in which Megara-277EA92R (a van-sized asteroid in an L4 orbit around the Earth) is 1. implanted with several boxing gloves, and 2. magnetized directly onto SPC-169.
# **Ahab-4 "Fist of Cthulhu":** 500 modified drilling rigs will be installed on the exterior of SPC-169 for the purpose of applying continuous punching action over the course of several years.
# **Ahab-5 "Fist of Nemo":** [DATA EXPUNGED] will be trained in bareknuckle boxing techniques and summoned to challenge SPC-169 to fisticuffs.

**Description:** SPC-169 is the largest shark ever encountered by the Shark Punching Center, believed to be between 2,000 and 8,000 km in length. Radar analysis has detected a hardened outer carapace, indications of a state of dormancy, and, unfortunately, a complete lack of exterior indications of punching. SPC-169 is believed to have existed since the Pre-Cambrian era. Due to the ethical ramifications of a shark having remained unpunched for that long, Project Ahab is to be executed as soon as possible.

**Addendum 1 - Shark Identification Discrepancies:**
> <Begin Log>
> 
> **Dr. Swayze:** Sir, we have reason to believe that SPC-169 is not a shark.
> 
> **Administrator:** Explain.
> 
> **Dr. Swayze:** SPC-169 has an exoskeleton, as well as multiple sets of limbs and feelers. In truth, I believe SPC-169 is a very large arthropod.
> 
> **Administrator:** Interesting. Tell me, is SPC-169 located in the ocean?
> 
> **Dr. Swayze:** Yes.
> 
> **Administrator:** Is it larger than a dolphin?
> 
> **Dr. Swayze:** [Audible sigh] Yes.
> 
> **Administrator:** Does it have lots of pointy parts that could potentially be dangerous? Then it's a shark! This is entry-level sharkspotting; you really should know better at this point.
> 
> **Dr. Swayze:** Sir, with all due respect: by that logic, sperm whales, orcas, and narwhals could also be called "sharks".
> 
> **Administrator:** ...oh God, no.
> 
> <End Log>

Following this meeting, an emergency initiative was established for the investigation and immediate punching of SPC-170 ("Moby Dick Sharks"), SPC-171 ("Free Willy Sharks"), and SPC-172 ("Sword Sharks?!").

**Addendum 2 - Ethics Committee Review:**
> <Begin Log>
> 
> **Dr. Balboa:** We've been going over the agenda for Project Ahab, and I think we need to step up the lethality.
> 
> **Administrator:** On what grounds?
> 
> **Dr. Balboa:** If we were to punch this... shark, and we did not kill it, I'm fairly certain its enraged awakening would potentially cause irreversible damage to human civilization.
> 
> **Administrator:** But would it be punched?
> 
> **Dr. Balboa:** The human race would go extinct, but yes, SPC-169 would be punched.
> 
> **Administrator:** Look, whatever the fine print says, our job is done once the fist is in the shark's bitch face. Forgive me if I fail to see how the most punchable shark in our organization's history is generating so much nitpicking.
