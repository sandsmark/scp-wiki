[[# content]]
+ Content Archives 
* [[[Joke SCPs]]] - Some of the best articles on the site are clever and funny. Make sure yours is before you add it.
* [[[Archived SCPs]]] - SCPs preserved due to their use in a Foundation Tale or because of staff purview.
* [[[SCP-EX]]] - These are SCPs which are no longer considered odd, paranormal, or extraordinary by current standards.  They are written with this in mind.
* [[[Log Of Anomalous Items]]] - For those objects that are not quite an SCP but are still abnormal in some way. Feel free to add to it, but be aware that it is regularly pruned.
* [[[Log of Extranormal Events]]] - For when things happen which are unexplained, but occurred too briefly or quickly for the Foundation to contain them. Feel free to add to it, but be aware that it is regularly pruned.
