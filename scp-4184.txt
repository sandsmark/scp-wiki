**Item #:** SCP-4184

[[include component:image-block name=sheetmusic|caption=SCP-4184]]

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4184 is to be stored in a standard anomalous-items locker. No other containment is needed.

**Description:** SCP-4184 is a lightly-used musical notation booklet bearing a piece of sheet music resembling Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Requiem in D Mass Minor.

SCP-4184's anomalous effects manifest when someone who has lost a blood relative in the past year plays or hears the piece. For 12 hours after doing so, every document the subject writes will be a letter to the dead relative. The subject will believe they are writing normally, and will not see the difference between their intended writing and the product, even when pointed out. Furthermore, the subject's mental state begins to deteriorate to severe grief, often manifesting itself as nostalgia and depression towards the loved one. 

> **Details of Recovery**
> 
> ------
> 
> SCP-4184 was recovered after a composer, Anna Swalls, began to display frequent mood swings, despite not taking any form of psychosomatic medication, having no history of depression, and having no history of drug abuse. Mrs. Swalls eventually took her life. Based on reports from her brother, Junior Researcher Jakob Swalls, she often kept to her room, and when pressured, explained she was listening to "a song from the heart." Upon Mrs. Swalls' death, the Foundation located SCP-4184 on a bedside table, showing signs of wear and tear from being played. Junior Researcher Swalls was not immediately notified of his sister's passing to ensure he would not be affected by SCP-4184.

Grandmama, are you out there? It's me, your Bill. It's been a long time since I talked to you, Grandmama, but --I just-- I want you to know that I love you, and I miss you. I'm sorry for --for taking-- taking it a bit too far. I remember those nights where you used to make me lemonade, sit me down, and tell me about Dad, tell me jokes, tell me stories. Oh, the fun we used to have. I remember when you used to tuck me in at night. But, when I grew older… I guess I thought that I didn't need that anymore. So I suppose that’s why I stopped talking to you and Pops. And, we didn’t end up talking for a long, long while after that. And that’s probably why I ended up where I am now. I had a family. No matter now. I went to jail, Grandmama, and Dad and Mom don’t even visit anymore. As lonely as I may be, Grandmama, I still love you, and I know if you knew where I was, you’d come visit too. You always did try to, because you loved me too.

> **<00:30> D-95671:** (//Chuckling, D-95671 remains silent, before pointing at Junior Researcher Swalls.//) Emma was probably the best of the two of us. I remember her smile... it's funny how all I remember about her now is when she was a kid. She'd run out to the swing on the big oak in our backyard, giggling, so happy. She'd hardly be where I am now. As fucking corny as it sounds, those of us who smile a lot, tend to frown a lot on the inside, and I suppose I didn't notice until it was too late. She'd gotten caught up in some shady stuff... drugs, crime, the whole lot of it, and then I took a turn for the worst. We were each other's support.

Emma was a beautiful being. She blazed beautifully, and I know she could've gone even brighter, if I had done something. I suppose I seem very, well, standoffish at times. It's just, well, we did everything together, like twins should, so once someone goes, it's hard to replace them. You go about your normal day, but it's just //not normal// because they're gone. You ask for them to get something, or for them to help pick something up, and you yell, and yell, but no one ever responds. It's like there's an Emma-shaped hole in my life. A hole only she could fill. Even now, I still can't believe she's gone. But I suppose that's why I am where I am now. Because we completed each other. What's the use of a jigsaw puzzle that's missing a middle piece?

> **<00:09> Junior Researcher Swalls:** When D-95671 was talking about Emma, it- felt a lot like Anna. I loved her. We always used to do everything together. Halloween, we'd be PB and J. Birthdays, we'd celebrate together, even though hers was in October, and mine was January. (//He wipes his eyes with his sleeve.//) When I used to cry when I was little, she'd put her little, fuzzy pink wool sweater around me, and tell me everything was alright. I miss that. I miss her. It's the little things you miss about a person, before the void sets in. Before acceptance, grief, denial, whatever else those five stages are. And I suppose I'm still stuck on the little things. I just want another sweater. To feel those arms around me one more time, and to hear someone say everything is alright, and that I'm loved. That I'm valid. But, I suppose, we don't always get what we want. To write what we feel, is liberating, to say the least. Anna? If you can hear me, whatever heaven or hell you're in, I miss you. I hope they take mail. If they do, here's my message: It's Jake. I love you. I miss you.
