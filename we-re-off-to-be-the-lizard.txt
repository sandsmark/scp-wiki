title:We Re Off To Be The Lizard
"And so," Dr. Samet continued from his wheelchair, his right foot still in a cast after that terrible, accidental firearm discharge, "We must now proceed with the application of-" He stoped, staring at Dr. Bright in some kind of horror. "What, is that?"

Bright smiled calmly, as his assistants continued to aide him in the final calibrations. Laying on the table before him, in pieces at the moment, were the three pieces of a rather ugly looking metal staff. Wires and cables trailed off at odd angles, and continued to look more bizarre the more the Lucky Bunch fiddled with it. "It's a staff, Samet."

"I can see that much, 963." The doctor with out a clue snarled. "But why do you have it here?"

Firmly grasping the now assembled staff, Bright turned on Samet with a scowl. "My name, is Dr. Bright. And, this, is to attract 682s attention. How were you planning on getting SCP-963 onto 682?"

"Well, ah, a launcher, and, ah, hmmm..." 

"Exactly. With this prototype, I shall endeavor to anger it, to the point at which it comes for me. Form there it will be childs play to get 963 inside it."

Samet nodded. "Of course, of course 963, but what does it DO?"

Some people never learn. And other people continually insult a vengeful immortal with a habit for killing people. The really stupid people feed Bright straight lines. "This." He raised the cane to point in a vaguely Samet direction, and pressed a button. Immediately, a purplish arc of electricity arches through the air, grounding itself in Samets injured foot. The doctor screamed, desperately rolling his wheelchair backwards, even as the bandages catch fire. "Hmm, Dr. Samet, it appears as if you have some sort of metal in your cast. Wonder how that happened."

As Samets lackies hurried to put their boss out, Bright turned to Dr. Light and nodded. "All right Sophia, we know what we're doing. What're the current odds?"

Dr. Light checked her clipboard, frowning. "2-1 it doesn't work. 5-1 you get in it and rampage across the site. Side bet on that one, even odds are that you use said rampage to kill Samet over there. 10-1 says something goes wrong, and you get stuck inside 682. 20-1 odds say that this goes bottoms up, and we all end up as you, somehow." 

"I like those odds."

"963!" Samet yelled, as his foot smoldered. "You! You, I! You-!"

"Dr. Samet. Understand this." Bright stalked over to tower over the other researcher. "I am about to be put in the most dangerous SCP we've ever discovered. I will offer you this deal then. If you cover your feet in barbecue sauce, I will stop at them."

And with that, Bright turned, and stalked down to the staging floor.
