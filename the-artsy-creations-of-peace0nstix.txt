[[collapsible show="+ Dr.Bright and a Magical Cat!" hide="- Heehee funny doctor go brrrr"]]

**For a weekly art contest on an SCP discord server I'm in (BrightCult). The theme was to draw the dr_bright's* cat, Gina, with superpowers. Out of all of the submissions, I won! :D**

//*dr_bright is a tiktoker who cosplays Dr. Bright. He also knows how to draw. It's pretty sweet.// 

Context: A magic cat is constructing a chainsaw cannon for Dr. Bright (whose appearance is based on dr_bright). Who else would force a magical cat to do such a thing? :P

(Gina sadly passed away on July 2nd, 2020. May she rest in peace.)

[[tab About Me!]]

+ Hello! My name's Alana! You may refer to me as Peace or Stix.

+++ //(The character in my icon is Nina, my 1930's cartoon persona! I made her wear SCP-inspired glasses just for this account ^v^)//

I am a young woman living in sunny California in the US of A. Not only do I draw and animate, but I also enjoy gardening, listening to music, watching random Youtube videos, wasting my time on multiple social media apps, and daydreaming. A lot.

I specialize in digital art, though I do draw traditionally from time to time (excluding all the traditional art I have to do for college, lol). If I'm not hanging out with family and/or friends, I will most definitely be at my desk, my face too close to my tablet, drawing whatever inspiration hit that day. 

I got into SCP in December 2019 thanks to the Oversimplified comics. Although I learned about SCP when Containment Breach was popular, I had forgotten about it until I stumbled upon the comics. I've never been a fan of horror, but the universe of SCP fascinated me.
