**Lost and Foundation** is a twice-monthly podcast about exploring and evaluating the SCP wiki. Each episode, we review several SCPs completely at random -- be they good, bad, or ugly -- and then cleanse our palates by sharing a few underrated articles we like. The podcast is hosted by Scantron with the help of various guests from the community. It is frequently not safe for work.

Since this is a podcast about writing, we strongly encourage you to actually read the articles we review, and to share your thoughts in their discussion pages. You don't //have// to agree with us, but you //should//.

The show also has **[https://www.patreon.com/lostandfoundation a Patreon page]** where you can support it financially; in return, you'll get patron-exclusive bonus content for as little as $1/month. Click through to learn more and sign up!
