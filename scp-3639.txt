**Item #:** SCP-3639

**Object Class:** --Safe-- Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-3639 is to be held in a standard containment locker, available for testing with approval from the Level 3 Contact Researcher.--

SCP-3639 is to be worn by a D-Class personnel in a vegetative state, held in an M-Type containment unit. Once per month, they are to be inspected by Agents and medical personnel who have cleared Level-3 psychic resistance training. Psychological counseling is to be made available to all sentient beings which may interact with SCP-3639. 

**Description:** SCP-3639 designates a pair of military footwear, of Hungarian origin. They display wear and tear typical of footwear used in wartime, albeit in wearable condition. Tags and other manufacturers information have been worn off over time, however the initials "K.L" have been branded into the inside of the heel.

Actions taken by subjects wearing SCP-3639, hereafter designated as SCP-3639-1, will cause primary and secondary observers to rationalize any actions taken by SCP-3639-1. If pressed to intervene, they will express ambivalence towards SCP-3639-1's actions, even if they find the actions to be abhorrent, frequently justifying their hesitance by citing some real or speculative equivalence between SCP-3639-1 and the objects or person(s) they take action against.

This effect will persist permanently even after subjects have been removed from the presence of SCP-3639. They will continue to justify and defend the actions taken by SCP-3639-1, until they cease to wear SCP-3639, at which point the affected subjects will be susceptible to argument and amnestic therapy. In addition, those who have not directly witnessed SCP-3639 will also be affected, to a lesser extent. They will defend the actions taken by SCP-3639-1 less stridently, frequently seeking compromise or middle ground regardless of the severity of SCP-3639-1's behavior.

While SCP-3696 has no anomalous properties relating to its physical state, subjects will express extreme reluctance to damage or destroy it. Weaker willed individuals will often take action to protect SCP-3696 from forces seeking to harm them. 

**History:** Manufacturers records relating to SCP-3639 were destroyed during wartime. Historical documents recovered after the fall of the Soviet Union indicate that the Red Army first encountered SCP-3639 in the possession of a Hungarian soldier, SCP-3639-1, who had taken possession of a small village on the outskirts of Budapest. 

GRU-P commissars were able to identify SCP-3639's anomalous properties, and were able to terminate SCP-3639-1 from a distance. After testing for potential political uses, they were determined to be too volatile to use and placed into storage. The Foundation was able to take possession of SCP-3639 in September of 1995, as part of an agreement with the Russian Federation.

**Addendum 3639-A:** Testing Log Records.

Testing of SCP-3639 was initiated by Site-30 personnel after request by Researcher David Bolland, who had been recently promoted from Junior status. It was the first project undertaken by this research team.

__**Test A - ██/██/████**__ 
> **Subject:** D-0127(SCP-3639-1), D-0412
> **Procedure:** D-0127 was instructed to place SCP-3639 on their feet, then destroy a glass jar while being observed by D-0412 inside of a viewing room.
> **Results:** D-0412 wrote afterwards of the dangers of glass and how the actions taken by D-0127 made them feel safer.
> **Analysis:** //It appears as though the properties described by the reds were accurate, to some extent. Further testing is required to see if any additional properties emerge.// -- Researcher Bolland

__**Test B - ██/██/████**__ 
> **Subject:** D-0127, D-0412
> **Procedure:** D-0127 was instructed to take physical action against D-0412, who would be debriefed following the test. Test duration was one hour.
> **Results:** D-0127 initially took minor actions against D-0412, pushing and shoving them to the ground. As the testing period progressed, D-0127 became more violent, eventually rendering D-0412 unfit for future testing. Debriefing is pending.
> **Analysis:** //It appears as though D-0127's behavior was exacerbated by D-0412's resistance, which they were instructed not to give. More compliant test subjects will be necessary in the future. We do not have the budged to request future test subjects.// -- Researcher Bolland 

__**Test D - ██/██/████**__
> **Subject:** D-0127
> **Procedure:** D-0127 was instructed to attempt a logic puzzle while wearing SCP-3639.
> **Results:** D-0127 did not attempt to solve the puzzle, instead berating the personnel conducting the test. Test was terminated after 45 minutes.
> **Analysis:** //Testers are encouraged to take a more conciliatory attitude towards D-0127 to improve cooperation for future testing.// -- Researcher Bolland

__**Test G - ██/██/████**__ 
> **Subject:** D-0127
> **Procedure:** Researchers cleared for engagement were encouraged to interact with D-0127 in order to prevent the need for additional test subjects, while also documenting their interactions to examine SCP-3639's effect in a conversational environment.
> **Results:** D-0127 agreed to continue as a testing subject, in exchange for additional accommodations. Research personnel noted that D-0127 did not make unreasonable demands, despite their disposition.
> **Analysis:** //Until further notice, D-0127 is to be housed in the research quarters, with appropriate measures being taken in accordance with their D-Class status.// -- Researcher Bolland
> 
> //Bolland, this is highly unorthodox. Please fill out the necessary documentation for a meeting with me justifying this move.// -- Deputy Director MacKenzie

__**Test J - ██/██/████**__
> **Subject:** D-0127
> **Procedure:** D-0127 was placed in a standard living chamber, with a sealed door between them and double food rations. Materials to remove the door were placed in their presence.
> **Results:** D-0127 destroyed the door in a violent fashion, ignoring the keycard and other nondestructive tools placed at their disposal.
> **Analysis:** //D-0127 is to be given access as necessary to prevent more negative interactions with barriers, as they have been shown to be harmful for persons attempting to meet their goals.// -- Deputy Director MacKenzie

**Addendum 3639-B:** Following the completion of the testing battery, SCP-3639-1 had been given full access to the Site-30 facility, living in the quarters of Researcher Bolland's team. A critical mass of personnel on-site had become affected by SCP-3639, forming a shadow chain of authority on-site. SCP-3639-1 used this influence to disrupt on-site activities for their personal gain. 

Several days after this state of affairs came to be, off-site communication analysts noticed aberrations in Site-30's reports. SCP-3639-1 had instructed the falsification and misrepresentation of on-site activities, which eventually led to noticeable inconsistency.

At this point, Foundation agents began investigating and quickly contacted unaffected members of the site, who provided intelligence revealing the scope of SCP-3639's influence over Site-30. MTF Eta-10 was deployed, and were able to recover SCP-3639 and terminate SCP-3639-1 via long-distance firearms.

All personnel affected by SCP-3639 were given amnestic treatment and therapy, while all other personnel were reassigned while Site-30 was reorganized due to this critical failure destroying morale and the capacity for research or containment in its present state.

**Addendum:** Interview Log 3639-G

> **Interviewed:** Researcher Bolland
> 
> **Interviewer:** Agent Hikks
> 
> **Foreword:** Subject was detained for possible collaboration with D-0127
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **//Ancillary communication redacted//**
> 
> **Agent Hikks:** Tell me how this all began.
> 
> **Rsr. Bolland:** It was... our first project. My first project, leading a team. We'd been cleared, passed our psych evals, which maybe could've maybe been the problem. We all knew, in our heads, the danger was there, but there was some kind of a safety bubble. We were ready, couldn't happen to us.
> 
> **Agent Hikks:** What was your process for choosing D-0127, specifically, among the D-Class available to you?
> 
> **Rsr. Bolland:** They were a non-violent, or it said so in their files. More or less stable, maybe, not likely to be problematic in testing.
> 
> **Agent Hikks:** My records show you indicated there were 'slim pickings'.
> 
> **Rsr. Bolland:** Usually the cream of the crop gets taken by higher-priority projects. Allocation is biased. Not fair to the younger generation-
> 
> **Agent Hikks:** Let's stick to what we're here for. Things seemed to have escalated quickly.
> 
> **Rsr. Bolland:** I think the problem... D-0127 figured out what they were wearing pretty quickly. I don't know how they ended up as a D-Class, but if it was because of something non-violent, maybe, maybe we shouldn't have picked them.
> 
> **Agent Hikks:** Focus. It didn't seem to take long to start sympathizing with the D-Class, did it?
> 
> **Rsr. Bolland:** Um, yeah, maybe, I don't know. It could have been that way from the beginning. They got into our heads, we felt badly for them. Like a puppy that had been kicked around.
> 
> **Agent Hikks:** So pity turned into obedience?
> 
> **Rsr. Bolland:** I wouldn't say obedience. It was just... easier. To think of some justification for why we did what we were doing. To go from privileges, to providing. There always seemed to be a good reason in our heads. Especially once administration got involved.
> 
> **Agent Hikks:** Would it be fair to say Deputy Director David MacKenzie was affected fairly early on?
> 
> **Rsr. Bolland:** That would be fair to say, I think, maybe, yes.
> 
> **Agent Hikks:** Would you say a large portion of those on-site were affected?
> 
> **Rsr. Bolland:** Uh, maybe... I didn't really get around much after a day or so, you know? They... D-0127, they kept me in my quarters most of the time they were running around, having me write stuff up for them. Memorandums and such.
> 
> **Agent Hikks:** I reviewed them. It seems you were focused more on reassuring your colleagues than anything else.
> 
> **Rsr. Bolland:** A lot of people came to me concerned, and I wanted people to feel safe. Maybe... I felt it was normal. I wanted them to know they could feel like it was normal too.
> 
> **Agent Hikks:** If people didn't feel it was normal, why would they comply?
> 
> **Rsr. Bolland:** Fear, maybe. Going with the crowd. Enough key people, high ups, were affected or cowed. Maybe... I just don't know. I'm sorry this happened. Everything went out of control so quickly...
> 
> **Agent Hikks:** Hey, stay focused. What did you see from your coworkers?
> 
> **Rsr. Bolland:** Sorry. After the first day not a lot of people talked to me. Maybe they thought I wasn't... someone they could talk to. I saw a lot of people keeping their heads down.
> 
> **Agent Hikks:** Did you hear anything much, after that first day?
> 
> **Rsr. Bolland:** There was, maybe you could call it tension, something in the air. Nobody had experience a breach like this. You expect these things to be sudden, and this was sudden, but sudden in a different way. Blood and guts and twisted metal. Not handwritten orders from your boss to do what this... person who essentially wasn't human, to us, a slave, the day before.
> 
> **Agent Hikks:** What did this person, D-0127, say to you directly? 
> 
> **Rsr. Bolland:** After the testing, the flattery, the sympathy... not a lot. I guess once they were done with me I wasn't really a part of their life anymore. In my head, I justified it. Helping a person. Maybe they would talk to me again later. In my head there were so many injustices we had done to them, I couldn't really see anything they were doing to me as that awful. Nobody was being lined up to get shot at the end of the month, whether that happens or not, maybe, what we do to them, the D-Class, it can be a fate worse than death.
> 
> **Agent Hikks:** Do you still have these feelings about D-Class?
> 
> **Rsr. Bolland:** I do. I think about it a lot more than I did before all this happened. Maybe it's happened in other places too. I'm not sure I can look at them the same way again.
> 
> **Agent Hikks:** I think we've got everything that will be productive here. We'll contact you for the next follow-up soon...
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:**  //After action reporting indicates that the broad majority of staff were not affected by SCP-3639. It was not a matter of a thug taking control of the site and calling all the shots directly. There may not have been more than a half-dozen key persons taken by the effect. It was social and peer pressure that played the main role in allowing D-0127 to seize effective control of the facility for as long as they did. When people are given a role, they tend to follow along. Even if the role is mad. -- Agent Hikks//
