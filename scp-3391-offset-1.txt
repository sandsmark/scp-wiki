title:SCP-3391-Updated
**Item #:** SCP-3391

**Object Class:** Euclid/Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3391 is the current subject of Project Hubris, which is to be overseen and carried out only by staff personally vetted and selected by the O5 Council. All information about Project Hubris and SCP-3391 in its current form are to be kept from the Ethics Committee, Sitra Achra personnel and all Groups of Interest. Staff assigned to work with SCP-3391 are to stay at Site 104 until Project Hubris is complete, and are to be within lowest 1st percentile of the human population for psionic sensitivity.

Due to the antimemetic and psionic properties of SCP-3391, no specific containment procedures are necessary to prevent civilian exposure to the anomaly. Site 104 has been constructed inside the anomaly in order to house staff and provide a platform from which to interact with the anomaly. Site 104 is to be armed with several explosive devices that may be detonated by any two members of the O5 council, in the event that SCP-3391 begins posing a threat to The Foundation and reality at large.

As SCP-3391 poses a non-zero risk of a YK-class end of the universe scenario, Akiva radiation and Hume levels are to be kept precisely at background levels around the anomaly. Previous containment efforts centered around suppression of the entity and staffing the entity's chamber resulted in many repercussions, including failure of the Veil protocol and the aforementioned YK scenario. Due to SCP-3391's impressionable nature and psionic abilities, a minimal number of staff should be exposed to the entity.

**Description:** SCP-3391 is a spherical region with radius ≈200m in the Mediterranean ocean that expresses extremely powerful antimemetic properties. Even on the strongest mnestics available, it has proven impossible for personnel to observe the region. Individuals will subconsciously attempt to avoid SCP-3391 if directed to move toward it, even when aware of its properties. Should an individual enter the anomaly however, they become fully cognizant of the area within the anomaly's range. Upon leaving SCP-3391's effective radius, its antimemetic properties will resume, removing any memories of the anomaly from the affected.

Matter and energy can still freely circulate in and out of SCP-3391 and as such radio signals can be transmitted from it. Persons within SCP-3391 may freely communicate with persons outside of it without their speech displaying antimemetic properties, however visual information transmitted from within SCP-3391 shares such qualities with the main anomaly itself.

SCP-3391-1 is a large undifferentiated mass of cardiac tissue that acts as the central point of the SCP-3391 phenomenon. It remains in a fixed position relative to the Earth's centre of gravity and cannot be moved or damaged.

SCP-3391-1 is a Class-V eschatological entity. While initial measurements have been inconclusive, it is estimated to have an internal Hume measurement of 650-850, granting it powerful reality bending abilities. The object is currently devoid of any identifiable consciousness but is known to be able to host one under unknown conditions. It is believed that if it were to develop sentient thought its reality bending capabilities would be amplified significantly.

Documents recovered from the original iteration of SCP-3391 were archived on a separate page from the original SCP article. They have been placed here due to their relevance to the project and SCP-3391-1 itself.

**Recovered Text Excerpt 1:** “Aleazu Ma’Limua"[[footnote]]Roughly translated as “The Path to Ascension”,  a religious script written by an unnamed historian from Anatolia c. 1440 BCE, which was at the time part of the Adi-um Empire, an anomalous civilisation responsible for the Bronze Age Collapse. Most, if not all Proto-Sarkic cults consider it an illegitimate narrative of the Sarkic belief system, but several modern Sarkic sects regard it as one of their core scriptures.[[/footnote]]

> ...And so Ion[[footnote]]First name of Grand Karcist Ion, the founder and former leader of the Adi-um. He is regarded as one of the core mythological figures of Sarkicism.[[/footnote]] walked the endless steps from the Adytum[[footnote]]The capital city of the Adi-um empire[[/footnote]] to the gates of Kashur[[footnote]]The significance of this title is unknown, as it only appears in a small number of texts written in the 14th century BCE by the author of Aleazu Ma’Limua; however, based on historical context, it is believed to be a mislabelled location of religious importance, possibly outside of physical space.[[/footnote]], following the whispers of his own flesh. He endured the sweltering embrace of the sun, the biting cold of the night, but felt nothing in it - for this was nothing to the greatest of essences. Grand Karcist Ion, came to an empty plain, overlooking the ruins of the once mighty Daevas; and he spoke to Važjuma [[footnote]]The primary deity of Sarkicism, also known as “Yaldabaoth”, and “The Great Winnower”, among other epitaphs[[/footnote]] in the desolate place where men had once bowed in supplication to gods, and gods had once been bound by men.
> 
> “Great Winnower” he said. “I have followed the call of the rapacious angels. I have seen the countless creations and powers of this world, from the bastard-god Mekhane to the mighty yet falling Daevas. And yet, none can compare to the strength of my Kalmaktama, nor you. I have overcome my bondage, the profane slavers, and I shall overcome you soon as well.”
> 
> “You will give me your strength, and I shall become your greater. I shall rise to be the master of all flesh and creation. As all creation is but the skin in which you wrap yourself, so shall you be the robes which I drape upon myself.” And Ion struck the ground with a staff of bone, and drew forth the forms of the terrible archons, who smiled at his strength: for he was as worthy in strength as the Devourer themselves.
> 
> So thus the Archons brought him down to Kashur where Yaldabaoth had once roamed the emptiness of uncreation, devouring the Old Gods. And there, Ion suffered the first of six trials; a terrible force that tore his mind and spirit asunder, and spread his essence thin across all worlds and all planes. Any other being would have been burnt from reality and swept from history; but Ion’s will was indomitable enough that his mind remained, becoming one with all reality. Thus, he became all seeing and all knowing, as god must be.[[/collapsible]]

**Recovered Text Excerpt 2:** “The Forging of Dreams"[[footnote]]A historical narrative written by a historically prominent Mycenaean scholar c. 1154 BCE who had supposedly spoken with Mekhane, shortly preceding the collapse of the Mekhanite state, a predecessor civilisation to the Church of the Broken God. The text describes the origins and core tenets of the Sarkic belief system, as well as the clashes between the late Mekhanites and Adí-üm empire - as well as several Thaumic techniques and principles involved in transmutation rituals and containment of eschatological entities.[[/footnote]]

> ...And the endless mechanism spoke to me in my dream, whispering structure into my mind. I saw the world then as the continuous equation; that which the entirety of creation has been a part of. And I saw the world, spinning around a burning mass of heat among countless other suns; enormous streams of light and stuff in between vast gaps of entropy and space. I saw the motion of stars in the sky as cogs in a machine, coalescing and pulsing like embers amongst an empty night. I saw the grand design that The Fragmented One had forged for us, the perfect order amongst which mortal flesh found no place.
> 
> And I believe I saw the answer to time, and it was Wan[[footnote]]A known name for the primary deity of Mekhanite civilisation, Mekhane - also known among the Church of the Broken God as The Fragmented One, The Great Creator and The Broken God.[[/footnote]]. The universe is equal to God, and God is equal to the universe; and they are as interchangeable as sticks of the same tree. Like ice and water, we are all just expressions of essence. The concept of being shaped in different ways.
> 
> In my dream, I saw all the things that we: the rocks, the stars and the oceans, could be - the ways the fragments of God could be reassembled to make something greater. Just as on Mekhane’s anvil he turned the mindless human flock to thinking men, so too did he reveal earthly anvils might do the same: turning slag into a blade, making stone into a monument and a pauper into a king.
> 
> And so too, could man beget a God.[[/collapsible]]

**Recovered Text:** Diary retrieved from SCP-3391

This excerpt is from a journal written by an individual known as “Karcist Iahel”, an obscure self proclaimed Neo-Sarkic leader, supposedly hailing from a now "lost"[[footnote]]Potentially due to anomalous activity on his part, or that of his followers[[/footnote]] Italian commune, in which he established a small cult. An anomalous group[[footnote]]≈24 members[[/footnote]] matching their description were last documented coming into conflict with the Global Occult Coalition in Turkey and Greece. How they came to be associated with SCP-3391 is currently unknown, however; they are speculated to have been involved in the process that led to its current state in some capacity. The earliest entry in the diary is from 13/07/1985, but it is expected that Karcist Iahel had been alive for some time before he began writing in this particular journal.

> **Excerpt: 14/01/15:** My endeavours have been set back once again by the bookburners. The man in Antalya claimed I would be safe in the countryside, but I have no doubt he was another one of their informants. All they were doing was luring me into a trap. But I am alive. My followers dwindle in number, but their minds remain as determined as ever. 
> 
> I admit however, that sometimes, I wish I had never left Italy. Everything was simpler in that small town, where secrecy and subterfuge were of no issue. But I must stay strong. I will not waver. My grand design will not be deterred by mere acts of violence.
> 
> The texts I reclaimed concur. The Archons took Ion beyond creation, and forged his mind, body and spirit into the perfect form through six trials. Ion the Karcist died and from his corpse Ion the God arose. In the same vein, The Archons themselves were created from the excretions of The Great Devourer. A simple man cannot ascend to be a demiurge with the limits of mortal flesh. I must create an Archon; so that Archon can create an even better version of myself. Then I will have become one with all creation, a guardian of life.
> 
> **19/02/15:** The texts are of no use. Not even the vaunted [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2191 Solomonari] could help me. It is clear that I am the first to walk this path. How cowardly, how limited the vision is of the other cults, that they never thought to do this - that even despite the teachings of Sarkicism, those of strength and ascension, none have ever dared to breach the realm of godhood. They are fools.
> 
> But even so, my workings have been fruitless. I have created great beasts, writhing works from the resources I have, but I cannot make a God without a similar base. Just as one cannot grow a child without a womb. I must seek out the greatest foundation. The perfect specimen, from which a God will blossom. I have the skill to do so, I have the power to do so, and soon, I shall have the materials as well.
> 
> **13/04/16:** I met a strange man in Polis today who claimed to know where the heart of God was. It seems that long ago, the greatest minds of Adytum had thought to generate a deity as well. They even did almost all of the work for me, from what I’ve heard of them. Supposedly, a traitor Minoan fleet was transporting the dawning god across the sea when it was beset and destroyed by the mechanists’ warships. However, if the legends are to be believed, this God survived, and now sleeps beneath Cyprus. I thanked the man for his words, and collected my disciples. I must seek out this relic, lest it fall into less worthy hands.
> 
> **22/04/16:** It took many attempts and much negotiation, but I have finally found and entered the Heart of God, with the help of some local divers. It pains me to act so cautiously, but I cannot allow word of my presence here to reach the innumerable hunters. The seventh of the Great Creator's limbs lies at the bottom of the Syrian sea. I have built myself a shelter around it, that my work may be uninterrupted. Many of my disciples have abandoned the cause, or given into to death, but I will not be fazed. I am so close now.
> 
> **29/04/16:** Success! The last few days were gruelling, trying to solve the puzzle of this heart. At first, it seemed as resistant to my workings as the rocks and stones in the earth itself, but it was not a deficit in strength or skill, but one of technique. A figment of God would never have submitted to forceful manipulation, and in the same way, it would never resist the chance to grow stronger. I believe I can grow it, as the ancients of Adytum did, by providing it a steady source of flesh; molding it into my design as it expands. The fish should be a plentiful source of food, both for this blossoming deity and for my following.
> 
> **11/05/16:** The creatures in the water have steadily become more evolved, more accustomed to Sarkic designs. Even as it sleeps, this god continues to unknowingly manifest its power. It has begun beating to my pulse as well - or perhaps the other way around. Regardless, it seems that me and my following have the same rhythms in our chests as the heart. My disciples claim that this is sickening, that the heart cannot be controlled. Two of them deserted me in the night, disappearing without a trace. I must not let this impede me. I will see this through, whether alone or together.
> 
> Their worries are unfounded. This creature, as powerful as it is, remains mindless. The thing does not think yet. Its power is great, but maddeningly unharnessed. If only I were able to seize that power, I would be able to complete this project that very same instant. But I must be patient. If I must do this alone, then so be it; for when I have become one with the Archons, time will have no grasp upon me. I will try to give it a mind. Try to create a way by which I can force it to think, and obey me.
> 
> **15/05/16:** There are only five of us left. The others departed last night. This work must be completed, before those defectors tell someone where I am. I will not let this opportunity escape me. The heart has begun synchronising us more and more. Even our minds are attuned now. I can see that my disciples are as determined as I am to stay the course. I spoke to them today, and we have agreed that tomorrow, we will feed ourselves to the heart. I cannot find a way to grant it a mind; so I will grant myself its body. I will dominate its faculties, and then, I will have ascended.[[/collapsible]]

SCP-3391-1 is the subject of Project Hubris, an ongoing initiative to study SCP-3391-1 among other eschatological entities and find ways to counteract their effects. It is unknown how much Foundation science stands to gain from the study of SCP-3391-1 as currently no methods to move, affect or interact with the anomaly exist.

**Notice from O5-1:**

> You’ve all read the archived document by now, and it’s probably raised a lot of questions; not the least of which is why we haven't neutralized 3391 yet; which I would like to address. We can't. When we first found the files from the temporal archives we went into a frenzy to find and destroy the thing. We plumbed the depths of the Mediterranean, and stumbled across it by nothing more than chance. From the lowliest of scalpels to stuff so far above your clearance that even the Overseers don't know about it, not a single tool or technique we have managed to even so much as scratch the thing.
> 
> Our teams have been running scans on it for years now, and we still have no clue what it is. The texts we recovered from the anomaly imply that it's some sort of artificial god made from some fragment of creation. Whether this is a literal interpretation or something deeper is probably irrelevant, considering our circumstances. What we know for a fact however is that SCP-3391 represents a heretofore unprecedented source of information on eschatology and the wider world; but right now we can't so much as scratch it let alone run tests on it. That's where Project Hubris comes into play.
> 
> You were a part of Project Hubris from the moment you received this document. Your job and that of your colleagues is to study this thing and find a way to interact with it. Anomalous phenomena have been and are on the rise. Current models estimate that we have less than fifty years before our current operations become unsustainable. SCP-3391 is, in essence, a god shaped canvas. If we can study it, learn how to control it, it may present to us an unfathomable degree of power and intelligence; and if nothing else it will be a deterrent to the next half-bit god that decides to have a go at our reality.
> 
> The risks are inherently enormous. This thing could take the minds of half of Europe if it so chose to. It would consume our reality and we'd be powerless to stop it. As damning as that seems, the only alternative is letting the Foundation bleed itself to death. With SCP-3391 we have a chance to change our fate. Without it we resign ourselves to the pre-cognitives and the countless impending apocalypses in our future. Our mission is to secure our future. It is to contain the anomalous. It is to protect humanity. We will not die just to hold on a little longer. We will take advantage of every lucky incident that comes our way so that some day we might no longer have to worry what might come crawling out of the dark to devour us whole. So that one day we will not longer be needed.
> 
> Given your time and effort SCP-3391 may prove to be our first, last and best weapon in our war for normalcy. Do not let it be our downfall.
