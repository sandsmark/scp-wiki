**Full Name:** Dr. ████████ ███████ Kaktus

**Security Clearance:** Plenty

**Location:** Site ██, ███████████, IN

**Area(s) of Expertise:** Tearing up the dance floor with his sharp, painful spines, sitting in the DJ booth wearing headphones, veterinary studies.

**Object Class:** Apollyon

**History:** Dr. ████████ ███████ Kaktus was born a poor black woman, but gradually grew from a tiny little home depot cactus into the towering saguaro of a man who stands before you to-day. He personally does not enjoy wearing slacks, and he always wins at hopscotch[[footnote]]Claims that Dr. Kaktus always wins at hopscotch are unverified.[[/footnote]]. Despite being immobile, spiny, and often late for dinner, he has risen through the ranks of the Foundation to become an invaluable asset to O5-██'s office decor
