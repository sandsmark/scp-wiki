[[include component:image-block name=djkaktus.jpg|caption=Dr. Kaktus, performing at the ██████ █████████ Music Festival in 2013.]]

**Full Name:** Dr. ████████ ███████ Kaktus

**Security Clearance:** Plenty

**Location:** Site ██, ███████████, IN

**Area(s) of Expertise:** Tearing up the dance floor with his sharp, painful spines, sitting in the DJ booth wearing headphones, veterinary studies.

**Object Class:** Doomageddon

**History:** Dr. ████████ ███████ Kaktus was born a poor black woman, but gradually grew from a tiny little home depot cactus into the towering saguaro of a man who stands before you to-day. He personally does not enjoy wearing slacks, and he always wins at hopscotch[[footnote]]Claims that Dr. Kaktus always wins at hopscotch are unverified.[[/footnote]]. Despite being immobile, spiny, and often late for dinner, he has risen through the ranks of the Foundation to become an invaluable asset to O5-██'s office decor

**Note:** Apparently he got loose and started doing a [[[kaktuskast-hub |podcast]]] too, so maybe keep an eye on that.

[[tab Author Article Discussion]]

--A lot of the cool kids are doing this nowadays, so I figured I might as well too. Peer pressure is rough. That being said, these are my thoughts and meditations on some of the things I've written.-- Hahahaha fuck that have you seen how many articles I've written so far? I'll just leave my favorite quotes from each article like I've got my own little goddamn Criterion Collection in here.
