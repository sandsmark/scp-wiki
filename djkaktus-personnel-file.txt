A lot of the cool kids are doing this nowadays, so I figured I might as well too. Peer pressure is rough. That being said, these are my thoughts and meditations on some of the things I've written.

**Item #:** SCP-XXXX

**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-XXXX are to be stored within high security storage lockers at Site 81. Due to the nature of SCP-XXXX instances, these lockers must be at least 50m from one another, and under no circumstances should any instance of SCP-XXXX come within 50m of another instance of SCP-XXXX, except for testing and research purposes. 

**Description:** SCP-XXXX is the group designation for a series of 19 hammers found in █████████████, Norway. Individual instances are designated SCP-XXXX-1-19.

SCP-XXXX instances are individually unique in their design, and vary in size and weight. Carbon dating has placed their creation to approximately 3500 BCE[[footnote]]Nearly 500 years before the first recorded human habitation in the region.[[/footnote]]. Each instance of SCP-XXXX has inscribed upon it a name[[footnote]]Written in the style of the //"Slag aver Nitta".//[[/footnote]], currently assumed to be the original owner of that specific object. 

Separated from other instances of SCP-XXXX, each object displays no anomalous characteristics. However, when two or more instances are brought together, they will enter a "powered" state. While in this powered state, each instance of SCP-XXXX will undergo several changes, primarily to the appearance of the "head" of the object, as well as to its ease of use. Generally, these changes are:

* Certain parts of the hammer head may "open up", or extend and expand, increasing total surface area and revealing additional functions (i.e. exposing sharpened blades, spiked protrusions, etc.).

* Previously unseen lighting elements will illuminate, usually along primary features of the hammer head and extending down upon the shaft and onto the grip.

* The object will seem to become significantly lighter and easier to wield, but only if held by a living human being. Objectively, the object's mass and weight will not change.

* The object will seem to impart far more force than mathematically probable upon impact, but only upon impact with another human being. Lightly tapping human subject has caused bruising and slight fractures, while a full swing [DATA EXPUNGED] necessitating the use of caution during transit.

* [DATA EXPUNGED] //See Addendum XXXX-Th for additional information regarding SCP-XXXX.//

Research into the origins of SCP-XXXX led to the discovery of a series of historical writings entitled "//Slag aver Nitta//[[footnote]]Battle of the Nineteen.[[/footnote]]", which appears to be written in an early Norwegian dialect[[footnote]]Although other influences have been observed throughout.[[/footnote]]. The apparent author of these texts claims to be a human male named Tak Ma, who resided within the Scandinavian city of Akka in roughly 3500 BCE. The author describes how, in response to an army of demon children (referred to as the Nubath in the text) by the ruler of a neighboring kingdom (a rough translation indicates the ruler's name as Markith), the king of Akka commissioned 19 hammers to be forged for his 19 strongest warriors. When the Nubath reached the walls of Akka, they were met by only the Nineteen[[footnote]]The proper noun Nitta is used throughout the text in reference to the group.[[/footnote]]. The author remarks that, despite being wildly outnumbered, the Nineteen were able to defeat the demon army handily, securing their place in Hallav[[footnote]]A proper noun used as a location for the afterlife, or possibly "hall of paradise".[[/footnote]] for all of eternity.

Foundation archaeological efforts in the region have been unable to verify any of the claims that the author of the text makes regarding the existence of Akka, the neighboring kingdom, or any kind of civilization that resided in present-day Norway before 3000 BCE.

**Discovery:** All instances of SCP-XXXX were discovered by a ████ █████, an amateur Norwegian archaeologist, during an expedition through a cave system near █████████████. Mr. █████ reported his findings to a local university, where embedded Foundation assets quickly assessed the validity of the source, leading to the containment of the objects. During initial containment, all instances of SCP-XXXX were discovered in different antechambers within the cave system proper, each roughly 100m from any other instance of SCP-XXXX. It was not until they were gathered for transit that the anomalous nature of the objects presented itself.

**Document XXXX-A:** The following is an excerpt from //"Slag aver Nitta"//, where the author accounts the names of the Nineteen and briefly describes the hammer they were given. Annotations have been made to specify the instance of SCP-XXXX referenced.

//And then came the Nineteen before King Arrogotte,//
//Cervinus, whose hammer rung with the sound of the stampede.// (SCP-XXXX-1)
//Atroyphy, whose hammer would wither the hearts of men on sight alone.// (SCP-XXXX-2)
//Dorriken, whose hammer was swift and true, and suffered not the meek.// (SCP-XXXX-3)
//Boundlic, whose hammer sang the song of twisted men.// (SCP-XXXX-4)
//Arcrayn, whose hammer was seeped in darkness and despair.// (SCP-XXXX-5)
//Gravemark, whose hammer would shatter the realm of the dead.// (SCP-XXXX-6)
//Dariux, whose hammer rang the bells of endless war.// (SCP-XXXX-7)
//Esrikbor, whose hammer was the strength of the unforgiving wilderness.// (SCP-XXXX-8)
//Brillia, whose hammer was the unwavering sun.// (SCP-XXXX-9)
//Altcleft, whose hammer was the quiet laughter of madness.// (SCP-XXXX-10)
//Synthos, whose hammer shattered the bodies of the wicked.// (SCP-XXXX-11)
//Piphin, whose hammer was the thundering release of a thousand loosed bolts.// (SCP-XXXX-12)
//Fourieus, whose hammer cared little for the laws of nature, and less for the laws of men.// (SCP-XXXX-13)
//Worozug, whose hammer was the last wavering breath before eternity.// (SCP-XXXX-14)
//Flamien, whose hammer was the scorched earth and the charred skies.// (SCP-XXXX-15)
//Werian, whose hammer was Legion and whose fury was boundless.// (SCP-XXXX-16)
//Soroziao, whose hammer was the gnashing of teeth and the tears of those who remained.// (SCP-XXXX-17)
//Zyandros, whose hammer was soft to speak and roaring to devastation.// (SCP-XXXX-18)
//Sourromin, whose hammer was the nightmare that never ended.// (SCP-XXXX-19)

**Addendum XXXX-Th: LEVEL 4 ACCESS REQUIRED**
During testing, SCP-XXXX exhibited an additional property. While in the "powered" state, instances of SCP-XXXX were able to create temporal dilations limited to specific human test subjects. This would surround the subject with a "bubble", within which the subject would not experience the passage of time. The duration of these effects seem to be directly related to the number of SCP-XXXX instances present, as a dilation initiated when thirteen instances were powered lasted significantly longer than one initiated when three instances were powered[[footnote]]In the aforementioned test, 3 powered instances created a dilation lasting 30 minutes, while 13 powered instances created a dilation lasting roughly 168 hours.[[/footnote]] Additional testing showed that this effect could be both applied at will (through the use of a mechanical switch on the grip of the object), and be applied to non-human subjects and objects. In all cases, subjects appeared to enter into a temporal stasis upon contact, and while these subjects could not be removed from the dilation, they could be acted upon by outside forces.

Upon verification of this discovery, Site 81 staff requested permission from Overwatch Command to begin experimentation with low-threat SCP objects, which was summarily approved. Testing concluded that anomalous objects were equally as susceptible to the effects of SCP-XXXX instances, which later proved useful during the containment of SCP-████. 

Although testing has yet to verify the results, current computer models indicate that a temporal dilation caused by a powered instance of SCP-XXXX in the presence of 15 or more other instances of SCP-XXXX would initiate a long-term stasis effect for the subject upon which SCP-XXXX is applied, and the same models predict a potentially indefinite dilation created by a powered instance of SCP-XXXX in the presence of all 18 other objects. Because of the results of these models, Site 81 staff proposed that SCP-XXXX be used as a method by which to more effectively contain higher threat SCP objects, specifically SCP-████, SCP-████, and SCP-███. Additionally, a request was made to upgrade the object class of SCP-XXXX to Thaumiel.

**Overwatch Proposal Response:**

* SCP-XXXX Upgrade to Thaumiel: //Approved//

* SCP-XXXX Containment Application: //Pending//
