**Full Name:** Dr. ████████ ███████ Kaktus

**Security Clearance:** Level 4

**Location:** Site ██, ███████████, IN

**Area(s) of Expertise:** Tearing up the dance floor with his sharp, painful spines, sitting in the DJ booth wearing headphones, veterinary studies.

**Object Class:** Apollyon

**History:** Dr. ████████ ███████ Kaktus was born a poor black woman, but gradually grew from a tiny little home depot cactus into the towering saguaro of a man who stands before you to-day. He personally does not enjoy wearing slacks, and he always wins at hopscotch. Despite being immobile, spiny, and often late for dinner, he has risen through the ranks of the Foundation to become an invaluable asset to O5-██'s office decor.
