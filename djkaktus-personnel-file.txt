**Full Name:** Dr. ████████ ███████ Kaktus

**Security Clearance:** Plenty

**Location:** Site ██, ███████████, IN

**Area(s) of Expertise:** Tearing up the dance floor with his sharp, painful spines, sitting in the DJ booth wearing headphones, veterinary studies.

**Object Class:** Doomageddon

**History:** Dr. ████████ ███████ Kaktus was born a poor black woman, but gradually grew from a tiny little home depot cactus into the towering saguaro of a man who stands before you to-day. He personally does not enjoy wearing slacks, and he always wins at hopscotch[[footnote]]Claims that Dr. Kaktus always wins at hopscotch are unverified.[[/footnote]]. Despite being immobile, spiny, and often late for dinner, he has risen through the ranks of the Foundation to become an invaluable asset to O5-██'s office decor

[[tab Author Article Discussion]]

A lot of the cool kids are doing this nowadays, so I figured I might as well too. Peer pressure is rough. That being said, these are my thoughts and meditations on some of the things I've written.
-----
> **[[[SCP-2812]]] - Echoes of Yesterday**
> //"By the time I'm finished with you, I'll have scorched the earth so thoroughly in ███████ that your grandchildren will feel the heat."//
-----
> **[[[SCP-2399]]] - A Malfunctioning Destroyer**
> //"In theory SCP-2399 might be left vulnerable by a powerful enough electromagnetic pulse. Unfortunately, this technology does not yet exist."//
-----
> **[[[SCP-2980]]] - Devil's Nightlight**
> //"You can't please everybody, though, but sometimes you hit one out of the park. That's why we do it, you know? Write, I mean. It's all about pleasing an audience."//
-----
> **[[[SCP-947]]] - Their Own Fault [REWRITE]**
> //" I would've been satisfied with the bare minimum, what is expected of decent human beings. I guess that was too much."//
-----
> **[[[SCP-2598]]] - Traveling Moth Salesman**
> //"During conversation, SCP-2598 will invariably attempt to redirect the conversation towards a sales pitch for, specifically, a helmet designed for moths."//
-----
> **[[[SCP-1994]]] - Rot**
> //"While the growth of the teeth across the body has progressed exactly as I had intended, the growths now quickly develop extensive caries across all surfaces and turn to rot."//
-----
> **[[[SCP-1781]]] - The Moonlight Theater Presents: Hugh Jackman**
> //"While the type of film shown can vary wildly, the single constant throughout all observed showings is the presence of Australian/British film actor Hugo Weaving in some role previously filled by another actor, actress, or prop."//
-----
> **[[[SCP-2890]]] - World Group Auction House**
> //"A low rumbling is heard, punctuated by the sound of some kind of firearm. The camera shakes violently, and then cuts to black. Throughout the entire exchange, a caption reading [MOMENTARY DISTRESS] is visible on the screen."//
-----
> **[[[SCP-2464]]] - Suspension**
> //"It is currently believed that SCP-2464-2 is a Class V Reality Bending Entity, and that the entirety of SCP-2464-1, outside of the existence of SCP-2464-3 and SCP-2464-4, is a result of that nature."//
-----
> **[[[SCP-2125]]] - You Can Always Try Again**
> //"Just because you didn't make it then//
> //Doesn't mean you won't make it now//
> //Things will be better this time//
> //I believe in you"//
-----
> **[[[SCP-2996]]] - It Follows You**
> //"Throughout interviews, it has become clear that SCP-2996 believed that it lingers in this world in order to enact revenge upon its killer, and that it was a powerful, unbound spirit. This, of course, is in direct conflict with both information that we have provided to SCP-2996 in regards to its death, as well as its containment within Site 81."//
-----
> **[[[SCP-2120]]] - Damage Control**
> //"All of these things that aren't working, that keep falling apart, that "inadvertently slaughter thousands of innocent civilians", we're going to have to find a way to get rid of them. Got to keep our hands clean here."//
