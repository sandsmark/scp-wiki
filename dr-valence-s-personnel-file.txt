Adrian Valence is a slightly tall man in his thirties. His most memorable features are his well-kempt brown hair and matching brown beard, and his dull hazel eyes. Adrian is of average build, leaning ever-so-slightly towards the heavier side. He is almost never seen without his glasses, and will frequently adjust them while speaking.

Dr. Valence has, over the course of several years, achieved a triple PhD. in the fields of Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics. His cover job is as a Professor at ███████ University in [DATA EXPUNGED], but the full extent of his talent shows in his work with the SCP Foundation.
