**Item #:** SCP-1535

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-1535 is to be kept in a security locker at Site-18. The object should be handled carefully during testing due to its fragile nature. The lid of SCP-1535 is to be kept in a separate locker, only to be removed during testing.

**Description:** SCP-1535 is a glass mason jar manufactured by the Ball company in 1946. SCP-1535 is physically similar to a typical glass mason jar.

Anomalous properties of SCP-1535 present themselves when non-sapient entities such as insects or reptiles are placed within and the lid of SCP-1535 is sealed.

Entities present within SCP-1535 after it has been sealed gain the ability to reason, fluency in the Spanish language, familiarity with Catholicism, and knowledge of Morse code. Residents of SCP-1535 are referred to as SCP-1535-1.

Attempts to open the lid of SCP-1535 without damaging SCP-1535 have proven to be ineffective while living SCP-1535-1 are located within. The lid of SCP-1535 is removed simply when SCP-1535 no longer contains living SCP-1535-1. SCP-1351-1 expires 1-2 hours after being sealed within, presumably due to lack of oxygen.

**Interview 1535-1:** A firefly is used in the following test for ease of communication. Testing with species of reptile and insect have proven themselves to be similar in result.

SCP-1535-1 communicates by blinking in Morse code.
