[[include component:image-block name=strange.png|caption=One variation of SCP-3335's chemical structure. Note: compound proved to be impossible to replicate in Foundation laboratories.]]


**Item #:** SCP-3335

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the popularity of SCP-3335, it is currently considered uncontained in certain dense population centers of the world.

Foundation agents inserted into the various underground trade markets of the substance are to monitor the use and distribution of SCP-3335.

Clandestine laboratories are to be expunged of all compounds bearing resemblance to the anomalous chemical structures seen via SCP-3335's gas chromatography and mass spectrometry testing. This is done to minimize population exposure to the effects of the compound and regulate any further synthesis of the substance.

Sensationalist media is to be distributed through routine drug scare tactics, while other outlets are to be manipulated in order to mitigate further damage to major populace centers. This method of containment has proved successful in most situations, as the usual "War on Drugs" methods are currently useful in self-containing the compound itself. Amnestic application has proved capable of handling most other cases.

As of ██/█/████, SCP-3335's global trade markets and laboratories have been reduced by approximately 85% from 1974. Despite this, there are assumed to be ██ facilities still producing SCP-3335 to this day.   

Foundation interception of large-scale distribution is considered a top priority at this time.

**Description:** SCP-3335 is an off-white compound similar in appearance to flour. It is a hallucinogenic substance of Arylcyclohexylamine structure, with effects similar to other NMDA Antagonists, specifically those of phencyclidine (PCP) and its derivatives.

Analysis of SCP-3335 samples have proven to be not useful, many of which have resulted in conflicting or inconclusive outcomes. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) procured during testing have effectively culminated in various erroneous information. These outcomes imply an inconsistent or variable chemical structure. It is unknown how synthesis of this compound is formed, and is likely anomalous in nature. 

Since the time of its surfacing in human populaces, over █% of the Earth's population have willingly consumed SCP-3335 for recreational purposes.

SCP-3335 exhibits a large array of effects, most of which are common to substances of its kind. These effects include, but are not limited to:

* Euphoria/Sense of serenity
* Closed and open-eye visual hallucinations
* Analgesia, numbness
* Significant change in perception of time (Dilation and constriction)
* Confusion/disorientation, delirium
* "Hole" experiences[[footnote]]The term has been used in a seemingly literal or figurative sense in various studies[[/footnote]]
* Intense mind-body dissociation, out-of-body experiences
* Ambulatory psychotic behavior
* Paranoia
* Nausea, vomiting
* Psychological dependency/addiction, compulsive dosing
* Frightening or untimely distortion or loss in sensory perception


However, SCP-3335 exhibits henceforth unrecorded anomalous properties that deviate highly from those of its more explainable analogues, including personality changes, photosensitivity and hematophagy (drinking of blood) of themselves or others with SCP-3335 still present in the bloodstream, so as to mimic the effects of titration and propagation of the effects of the compound. 


 Toxicity reports of affected individuals reveal a consistent low-level blood content of SCP-3335 that does not appear to dissipate nor filter out of the body through the kidneys. Dialysis treatments have shown to be ineffective in hindering the production of SCP-3335 in the body. It is theorized that SCP-3335 may cause lasting changes in physiology that aid in the endogenous synthesis of the chemical.

Due to the inability to remove SCP-3335 from the bloodstream and treat affected individuals, widespread use supports theorized potential for large-scale LK-Class Personality Transmutation Events. As such, experimentation and thaumaturgic use is currently halted, per O5 request.

**Incident Log 3335.1:** On ██/██/████, ███ civilians in the New York City area that were known users of SCP-3335 reportedly stopped moving, and stared at a nearby floor. Subjects that proceeded to walk to this area immediately collapsed without warning. All affected individuals have remained comatose since the event.

**Incident Log 3335.2:** More individuals continue to experience this phenomenon. O5 council holds a conference after the number of unconscious individuals reaches ████ on ██/██/████. Widespread amnestic dispersal considered if situation worsens.

> **████████:** Look, man, I don't know anything about this stuff, okay? I was told it was still legal in the area, yeah? I need a lawyer or something, right? Someone give me a lawyer.
> 
> **Agent Francis:** Hey, kid. You aren't in any trouble here. I just gotta ask you a few questions about what you were selling over at ███████ ████. Plain and simple.
> 
> **████████:** Yeah, okay. You're the good cop, right? Nice uniform for an officer, but I'm not saying anything.
> 
> **Agent Francis:** (sighs) Look, I'm serious, you answer my questions, you walk free this evening. Otherwise, I'll have to throw you in a tank for the night. You don't have any prior convictions, you're mostly clean otherwise. This can be over in an hour if you just answer a couple of questions. I'm not here to charge you for distribution.
> 
> **████████:** (pauses) You're serious?
> 
> **Agent Francis:** Yeah. So, let me get this straight. You got this, uh, what are you kids calling it on the streets now?
> 
> **████████:** My boy's over in the Bronx calling it 'Transcendence' or some shit. I don't know much about it, okay?
> 
> **Agent Francis:** Alright. And have you tried the drug itself?
> 
> **████████:** Yeah, man. I know that's not illegal. My body, my choice, right?
> 
> **Agent Francis:** Okay. Like I said, no trouble for you tonight. It's your lucky day. So, tell me, what's this stuff like?
> 
> **████████:** Uh, It's hard to explain. Not to be that guy, but you have to try it to know what it's like, okay. It's not easy to describe. It's weird shit, man. Crazy stuff.
> 
> **Agent Francis:** Just do your best. I was your age once, you know.
> 
> **████████:** (scoffs) Yeah, I bet. Trying to get all chummy with me, is that it? You think I'm gonna relate, y'all tried the same shit when you were young, yeah? Well, not this. I know the scene, some of you been around the block before you got your badge, I get it. But this is something new. They got scientists or some shit working on this stuff. I don't know nothing about nothing when it comes to cooking up this designer shit. 
> 
> **Agent Francis:** Right. So, you cannot provide any details as to what your average experience is like?
> 
> **████████:** (laughs) I told you, I can't put it into words. They had this shit called 'roflcoptr'[[footnote]]Slang term for Methoxetamine, a non-anomalous compound of similar effect [[/footnote]], lame-ass name if you ask me, but that stuff was fire. It was like you were walking around with your body just laying there, ya' know? It's kinda like that.
> 
> **Agent Francis:** Okay. Well, what made you start dealing this stuff? What does it have over the other drugs that are being sold out there on the streets?
> 
> **████████:** I don't know, man. It's got this magical quality to it. Warm. Took it once and it was like I went to another place entirely. With that rofl shit, you knew you was fucked up. Knew it was a drug, right? This was something different. Same deal, I saw myself layin' there on that fuckin' futon. But it was like I could walk away and never come back. Nice feeling. Don't have to deal with none of this shit that's happening out there in the world right now. You got that free roam. My body could be cut to shit and I could care less because, fuck it, right?
> 
>  **Agent Francis:** Sounds nice.
> 
>  **████████:** Yeah it does. But you snap back after a coupla' hours, you know? Pull you right back in. Like a dream, I guess. Gotta wake up sometime.
> 
> **Agent Francis:** I understand. Now, a couple of people have been found comatose because of this drug, you know anything about that?
> 
> **████████:** Yeah, not my people though. Nobody got hurt from my deals, probably some asshole who cut it with something nasty, yeah.
> 
> **Agent Francis:** Actually, all of their tox reports came back and there was nothing unusual in their systems. So, what's the difference?
> 
> **████████:** Fuck if I know, man. The stuff I sold was clean. I'm not about to fuck anyone over. I'm just trying to get by. Maybe they just OD'd, you know? I didn't kill nobody, okay? You know what, I'm not saying anything else. Get me a lawyer, okay?
> 
> **Agent Francis:** That isn't possible. And you're not in trouble. Relax, kid.
> 
> **████████:** (pauses) 'Ight. Okay. Okay. 
> 
> **Agent Francis:** Have you noticed anyone acting odd or abnormal? Your buyers? Friends?
> 
> **████████:** Yeah, you know what? There was something someone said, this young girl. Blonde. Didn't look the type. She said something about a hole. I heard it before, but she said some weird shit about it. Got me all messed up for a bit. Sold her some anyway, money's always green, right? 
> 
> **Agent Francis:** What did she say?
> 
> **████████:** She said next time, she was gonna jump into it for real. Weirded me the fuck out. Drugs are drugs, right? Still, don't go jumping into some goddamn hole in the floor. High as balls or not. Can I leave? I'm tired, man.
> 
> **Agent Francis:** Alright. One last thing.
> 
> **████████:** (groans) Okay, what?
> 
> **Agent Francis:** Did you ever see this so-called 'hole'?
> 
> **████████:** (pauses) I think so. Took a few bumps at a party and it caught my eye. Looked dark as fuck. Wouldn't jump in if I had the choice. Part of me said go on, you know? You smoke crack on the streets, what's some shit your seein' gonna do to you that's worse than what rock has on you? I see them crackheads out there, itching themselves, suckin' dick for a little piece of that cook-up. But this? Nah man, I felt something bad. Something real bad. Down that hole, I dunno man. I told myself I was tripping out, but that hole seemed like a one-way trip, if you know what I'm saying.
> 
>  **Agent Francis:** I see. Alright, you're good to go.
> 
>  **████████:** Really? I'm just gonna walk? That's that?

**Incident Log 3335.3:**

As of ██/█/████, multiple cases have been reported comatose users having experienced "Hole" effects re-awakening with massive alterations in personality and physiology. Extreme mood swings, mania, and psychosis seem to be most prevalent. Affected individuals have shown marked increase of adrenaline and cortisol present in blood testing, as well as a higher blood concentration of SCP-3335. 

Electroencephalography tests yielded unusual patterns of electrical activity in the brains of SCP-3335-1 instances, similar in effects to those who have undergone corpus collostomy procedures. As a result, many subjects develop symptoms similar to callosal disconnection syndrome, also known  as "split-brain". 

When a subject appears to have acquired symptoms of callosal disconnection syndrome, hemispheres of the brain take on unique attributes of their own. This results in separate impulses and perceptions for both halves of the subject's body. 

Unlike usual cases of callosal disconnection, both hemispheres of affected victims develop their own consciousness, one half of which may usually retain some personality traits of the original individual, but with extreme emotional dampening and lethargy. The other half seems to be occupied by a unique consciousness. These personalities are often highly erratic and violent by nature (See Interview Log 3335-1B).

**Addendum 3335.5:**

Reports of SCP-3335 consumption in ████████, ██ led to an investigation of several known "drug dens" in the area. Mobile Task Force Pi-1 ("City Slickers") has been assigned the task of raiding affected homes, terminating users of SCP-3335 and destroying all paraphernalia or lab equipment that may have come into contact with the substance. Records of MTF operations can be found below.

[[collapsible show="+ Access MTF Pi-1 Mission Log 1" hide="- Close"]]

> **Mission Parameters:** Investigate sites of interest and terminate all affected individuals.
> 
> **Personnel:** Mobile Task Force Pi-1 ("City Slickers")
> 
> **Additional Information:** The following is an audiovisual transcript of a staged raid on an apartment complex in downtown ████████. Members of MTF Pi-1 were equipped with standard deep-cover tactical wear, including low-profile Kevlar suits and suppression-integrated Maxim 9mm handguns. Agents were posted outside exit points from the apartment complex while Pi-1 infiltrated the interior.

> 
> **Command:** Delta? Where's Delta?
> 
> **Delta:** Here, sorry. Setting up the camera. Should be coming live now.
> 
> **Alpha:** We're ready to go. Command, please confirm video feed.
> 
> //Delta's visual broadcast activates, revealing a run-down urban alleyway leading to the back entrance of the complex. The building has multiple floors, the windows of each have been boarded up with plywood.//
> 
> **Command:** Affirmative. You are clear to proceed.

> //Pi-1 is seen swiftly making their way to the door, treading through puddles and various detritus.//
> 
> **Alpha:** Alright, we are approaching the entryway. Control, anything we should know about this place?
> 
> **Command:** Your guess is as good as ours.
> 
> **Delta:** Shit, door's locked.
> 
> **Alpha:** I told them they should have got us a dremmel. (sighs) Command, do we have permission to barge the door?
> 
> **Command:** That is not advised. It is very likely to draw attention.

> **Alpha:** That outta do it.
> 
> **Bravo:** What the fuck, man. No one said they were our targets! I feel like we would know. 
> 
> **Alpha:** They've got the powder, though.

> //The screaming ceases abruptly and a loud thump is heard, the figure falling unconscious.//
> 
> **Bravo:** Well, that was something.
> 
> **Command:** What is your status?
> 
> **Alpha:** Uh, well, we had an affected individual here, but he just collapsed. He doesn't look dead. Major bandaging on his head, some blood soaked through. Delta is taking a closer look.
> 
> **Delta:** You guys might want to see this.
> 
> **Echo:** What is it?
> 
> **Bravo:** Oh god, what the hell.
> 
> **Foxtrot:** I'm going to be sick.
> 
> //Delta pulls back the bandaging to reveal uneven stitches and metal pins that run in a circle around the individual's head. The wound is infected and continues to bleed.//
> 
> **Alpha:** So, Command, this guy looks messed up. If I had to guess I'd say they tried to put their skull back together. Did a hasty job too, if you ask me.
> 
> **Delta:** Yeah, these sutures look loose-fuck!
> 
> //The stitching appears to dislodge, the portion of skin and bone falling away, revealing an open hole into his cranial cavity.//

> 
> **Bravo:** You alright?
> 
> **Command:** Alpha? What happened?
> 
> **Alpha:** Drugheads, came to life without warning. They were all over Foxy here. Damn things were bleeding everywhere. It pinned him down.
> 
> **Foxtrot:** (gagging) It bled in my mouth.
> 
> **Alpha:** What?
> 
> **Foxtrot:** The fucking thing wrung out its wounds in my mouth! Look at the wrists.

> **Alpha:** Command, please be advised that Foxtrot may have had contact with the chemical agent in question. Likelihood of contamination unknown.
> 
> **Command:** Understood, we are suggesting evac for Foxtrot, followed by standard decontamination procedures.
> 
> **Foxtrot:** No, I'm okay, I'm okay. Let's keep going.
> 
> **Alpha:** You sure about this?
> 
> **Foxtrot:** Yeah.
> 
> **Alpha:** Alright. We will continue for now. Let's terminate the rest of these half-brains.
> 
> **Bravo:** Right.
> 
> //The team moves out into the hallway again, checking the rest of the doors on the floor and revealing them to be empty, aside from one with three unconscious individuals. Several water bottles are littered around them, filled with what appears to be blood.//
> 
> **Alpha:** Damn. At least these will be easy. Keep your distance though.
> 
> //After termination, the bottles are recovered for analysis. Pi-1 proceeds back to the stairway and climbs to the third floor.//
> 
> **Bravo:** I think I know where the smell is coming from, guys.
> 
> //The third floor landing comes into view, the remains of several individuals piled in the far corner. All appear to have undergone the same head trauma, with varying degrees of repair. Foxtrot is heard vomiting off camera.//
> 
> **Echo:** Jesus mate, sensitive stomach much?
> 
> **Foxtrot:** Can't help it, all I can taste is junkie blood.
> 
> **Echo:** Fair point.
> 
> **Alpha:** Have some water, you'll be fine.
> 
> **Foxtrot:** Fuck! Did you see that?
> 
> //Camera wheels around to show Foxtrot staring back at the stairwell.//
> 
> **Delta:** What? What was it?
> 
> **Foxtrot:** Someone was behind us. 
> 
> **Alpha:** Alright, stay alert. Bravo, go ahead and check the stairs. The rest of you, let's start trying doors.
> 
> **Bravo:** You got it, cap.
> 
> //Pi-1 is seen attempting access to the apartments, but the first three are barricaded.//

> //A scream is heard coming from the far end of the hall, followed by some dampened vocalizations.//
> 
> **Alpha:** New plan. Let's go.
> 
> //The team silently makes their way to the door, which turns out to be locked.//
> 
> **Alpha:** Echo, get this lock here.
> 
> **Echo:** Yeah, yeah.
> 
> //After a moment, Echo bypasses the lock and pushes the door open.//
> 
> **Echo:** Oh my god.
> 
> //Camera comes into the view of the doorway, revealing the floor to be littered with SCP-3335-1 instances, at least twenty. All appear unconscious or dead. Blood coats the floor. In the corner, two individuals are hooked up to makeshift IV tubes that were apparently used to siphon off blood into buckets.//
> 
> **Alpha:** What the hell is this? Some sort of hive?
> 
> **Delta:** Jesus. Let's fucking torch this place and get out of here.
> 
> **Alpha:** That's starting to sound like a good idea. Let's finish up, I don't think there is much more to learn here.
> 
> //Sounds of movement are heard coming from another room in the apartment. Alpha gestures towards it, he and Foxtrot slowly making their way around the bodies and into the bedroom. Alpha is seen crossing the threshold and disappearing out of view. The camera reveals a lone instance of SCP-3335-1 convulsing on the floor.//
> 
> **Alpha:** (sighs) Alright. (quietly) Let's douse this place.
> 
> //Bravo is seen producing a small container of accelerant from his pack. He starts to pour it on the floor but stops when sounds of struggle are heard. Delta's camera spins to see Echo being restrained from behind, his gun now being held to his head. Instance of SCP-3335-1 is seen, this time without bandaging. He is seen smiling and appears more lucid than the others. The rest of Pi-1 raises their weapons.//
> 
> **SCP-3335-1:** Everybody just calm the fuck down. Nice and easy. 
> 
> **Alpha:** Let him go!
> 
> **SCP-3335-1:** Nuh-uh. He's my security deposit. Now you guys are going to leave or I'm going to paint the walls with his blood.
> 
> **Alpha:** What do you want? Who are you? 
> 
> **Alpha:** What happened to their brains?
> 
> **SCP-3335-1:** (laughs) Everything is already in motion. You'll join them one day.
> 
> **Delta:** We aren't leaving without him.
> 
> **SCP-3335-1:** Then you've made a mistake.
> 
> //Instance smiles as the bodies laying around him start to stir.//
> 
> **Alpha:** Shit, take them down!
> 
> //Bravo is seen firing at the bodies, some of which appear unfazed. One figure, a young woman, stands in front of Alpha. He fires a round, which strikes her in the head. Figure appears to stagger, and then rights herself, a clean hole perforating her head and exiting the back side as pinkish-red cerebral fluid runs down her face. She adjusts her bandages to account for the new wound and lunges at Alpha. Delta appears to be attacked from behind, the camera being knocked off his shoulder and hitting the ground, cutting the feed for approximately one minute. Audio broadcasting still works fine.//
> 
> **Delta:** (muffled scream)
> 
> **Bravo:** Get him, get him.
> 
> //More gunfire, followed by the sound of falling bodies.//
> 
> **Echo:** Please, I-
> 
> **Foxtrot:** Fuck, fuck, fuck-
> 
> **Bravo:** You can't-
> 
> //Video feed is reestablished, the camera now laying on its side. Delta is seen laying on the ground, surrounded by bodies. Another instance of SCP-3335-1 is seen producing a water bottle filled with blood. She unscrews the cap and pours it on Delta's face. Alpha and Bravo are not seen, although background noise suggests they are in another room. Foxtrot is still pointing his handgun at the instance with Echo.//
> 
> **SCP-3335-1:** Go ahead, shoot me. Don't you have a train to catch, though?
> 
> **Foxtrot:** Excuse me?
> 
> //Foxtrot briefly appears confused, swaying slightly. SCP-3335-1 laughs.//
> 
> **Foxtrot:** What is this? Who is this?
> 
> **SCP-3335-1:** Your ride home. Join the family.
> 
> //Foxtrot is suddenly aware of something else in the room, glancing over and down at the far corner, out of the cameras view.//
> 
> **Foxtrot:** Is that- 
> 
> **SCP-3335-1:** Yes. You hear them too, don't you? Singing. They are in harmony. They shed their flesh, uncoiled like a snake in molt. I guide them there. I'll take you there too. You just have to walk through the door.
> 
> //Shaking, Foxtrot slowly lowers his gun and walks to the other side of the room. Reaching the far wall, he collapses and does not move.//
> 
> **SCP-3335-1:** And for you-
> 
> //SCP-3335-1 instance hits Echo over the head with the butt of the pistol, knocking him unconscious.//
> 
> **SCP-3335-1:** I'll be back for you.
> 
> //SCP-3335-1 is seen heading off camera. A shout can be heard followed by silence. Some time later, Alpha and Bravo are seen emerging into the camera's view, dragging the instance of SCP-3335-1 who appears to be unconscious.//
> 
> **Bravo:** Shit! Foxtrot, you okay?
> 
> **Alpha:** He's breathing. Comatose. I think he's turning. 
> 
> **Bravo:** Fuck, Delta is out too, covered in blood. Echo? Echo!
> 
> //Echo is slowly seen coming to. They hoist him up and help him to his feet.//
> 
> **Alpha:** Did they bleed on you?
> 
> **Echo:** N-No. 
> 
> **Alpha:** Alright. Bravo, finish dousing this place and light it up. We're taking this guy with us, since he seems more willing to talk than the others.
> 
> **Bravo:** Outbound. Let's do this.
> 
> //Bravo pours the rest of the accelerant, lighting a match.//
> 
> **Bravo:** Burn in hell.
> 
> //Tossing the match, Bravo turns and leaves as the fire starts to spread. Pi-1's egress is largely uneventful and the rest of the team members returned without incident. SCP-3335-1 was placed in a maximum security chamber while interrogation measures were implemented.//

> **Dr. Hoffman:** SCP-3335-1, can you hear me?
> 
> //Silence.//
> 
> **Dr. Hoffman:** SCP-3335-1, answer the question.
> 
> //SCP-3335-1 glances up at the one-way mirror.//
> 
> **SCP-3335-1:** I hear you.
> 
> **Dr. Hoffman:** Who are you?
> 
> **SCP-3335-1:** I'm the herald.
> 
> **Dr. Hoffman:** The herald of what?
> 
> //SCP-3335-1 laughs.//
> 
> **Dr. Hoffman:** SCP-3335-1, if you do not respond, we will be forced to use alternative methods.
> 
> **SCP-3335-1:** You can't hurt me. Kill me, sure. Won't do you any good though. The mind is bigger than you.
> 
> **Dr. Hoffman:** Tell me about this mind, this other consciousness.
> 
> **SCP-3335-1:** It knows you're hunting it down.
> 
> **Dr. Hoffman:** Is that so?
> 
> **SCP-3335-1:** It isn't happy about it.
> 
> **Dr. Hoffman:** Why hasn't it affected you like it has the others?
> 
> **SCP-3335-1:** It needs me to help with the relocation.
> 
> **Dr. Hoffman:** Relocation? What relocation?
> 
> **SCP-3335-1:** I think that is enough for now. It will find someone else to do it.
>

**Addendum 3335.27:** 

Surveillance of the New York City area revealed a large abandoned textile factory that was being used by SCP-3335-1 instances as a nest. Upon termination of SCP-3335-1, autopsies confirm the removal of one side of the brain (hemispherectomy).

In addition, several unidentified hemispheres were recovered from the building, having been removed and carefully reconnected to one another in chains using an unknown but highly sophisticated procedure. Nerve endings in the brain stem were found to have been "rewired" to those of the others.

The reason for this is currently unknown.
