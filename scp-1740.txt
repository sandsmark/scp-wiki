**Item #:** SCP-1740

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Warning signs are to be placed outside of SCP-1740, claiming it as structurally unstable. SCP-1740 is to be surrounded by a 4 meter high wall, to prevent the viewing of SCP-1740-1. Any instance of SCP-1740-1 found attempting to exit SCP-1740 may be subdued by security personnel (stationed in nearby homes).

**Description:** SCP-1740 is a public playground in ██████, ███ ████. It contains standard recreational equipment, such as slides, ladders, mountable spring animals, and a swing set. Standard materials such as metal and plastic are present, though no anomalous properties surround the composition of any of the equipment in SCP-1740.

SCP-1740's anomalous properties originate from its development of SCP-1740-1. A typical instance of SCP-1740-1 is an animate plastic mold of an animal, mounted upon a metal spring. There are currently 9 instances of SCP-1740-1 recorded to inhabit SCP-1740. Autonomous behavior will only occur with instances of SCP-1740-1 if a human adolescent of less than 13 years in age comes within 1 meter of SCP-1740.

Upon nearing SCP-1740, two to three instances of SCP-1740-1 will immediately activate and bounce[[footnote]]Average speed recorded is 1.2 km/h[[/footnote]] towards the adolescent (hereby referred to as the subject), and will attempt to prevent them from leaving SCP-1740. It will accomplish this through repeatedly slamming into the subject, often continuing until the subject complies. If the subject manages to escape, SCP-1740-1 instances will pursue them as far as 20 meters before returning to SCP-1740. If the subject is compliant, instances of SCP-1740-1 will escort the subject underneath SCP-XXXX, and will begin to patrol around SCP-1740.

Subjects will be imprisoned for an indefinite amount of time, as SCP-1740-1 instances display no fatigue or need for nourishment. Subjects will also be provided with water and meals by SCP-1740-1, though are produced through unknown means. Escape is possible for subjects, as instances of SCP-1740-1 appear to lack peripheral vision, and will only look at what is directly in front of them. However, subjects caught escaping will be forcefully escorted by 5 to four instances of SCP-1740-1 to what appears to be a miniature guillotine, incorporated into the swing set of SCP-1740. Approximately 1 cm portion of the subject's toe or finger will be sliced off as a repercussion. However, bandages will be provided by instances of SCP-1740-1.

SCP-1740-A is a set of three wooden benches situated four meters from SCP-1740. Each is covered in green paint, and show average wear and damage consistent to being outdoors. SCP-1740-A's anomalous properties manifest whenever a non-virgin human of more than 18 years in age sits on a bench. 

After sitting on SCP-1740-A, a clear viscous liquid will enclose the subject from beneath the area they sat. When enclosed by this substance, the subject will immediately enter a vegetative state, and will not respond to external stimuli. The liquid contains several enzymes and electrolytes, though show abnormalities in [REDACTED], making the identification of a terrestrial species impossible. The only known method in removing this substance from the subject is physical contact with the subject's biological child, which will cause the liquid to disperse and rapidly evaporate. The affected subject will not remember being incapacitated, and will react with confusion and denial if questioned.

**Addendum 1740-B:** SCP-1740 was found with a bronze plaque standing 2 meters from it. The following is the inscription of the plaque:
