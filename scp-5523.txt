**Containment Update:** Following the incident encompassing Sid Rothenberg, the Alberta provincial government has enacted an indefinite ban on the hunting and consumption of //cervidaes// species. Rothenberg has been taken into Foundation custody, and is receiving intensive care.

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the ecological niche SCP-5523 facilitates, removal of SCP-5523-1 specimens from Kananaskis Country[[footnote]] A region in Alberta, Canada, notable for its close vicinity to the Canadian Rocky Mountains. [[/footnote]] is currently prohibited. Regions containing significant SCP-5523-1 populations have been cordoned from the public, with low-level security fences established around the perimeter of SCP-5523 affected areas.

**Description:** SCP-5523 is a Terminal[[footnote]] Originally refering to an entity or anomaly that incorporates human beings into it following death. Following the discovery of SCP-5523, it has been determined that animal specimens can be incorporated into Terminal anomalies.] [[/footnote]]-Class biological behavioral change affecting female members of the Cervidaes family[[footnote]] A biological group consisting of Deers. [[/footnote]] within Kananaskis County, Canada. SCP-5523 consists of the ingestion of //Vaccinium vitis-idaea//[[footnote]] Variously known as lingonberry, partridgeberry, mountain cranberry or cowberry. [[/footnote]] berries. //Vaccinium vitis-idaea// are typically not eaten by Cervidaes specimens, due to the individual berries containing toxic substances.

SCP-5523 affected individuals[[footnote]] Designated as SCP-5523 instances. [[/footnote]] who are currently nursing will ingest great quantities of //Vaccinium vitis-idaea//, in which the poisonous materials will accumulate within the mother's milk, along with trace material of //Vaccinium vitis-idaea// seeds.  Fawn fed SCP-5523-1 produced milk will die within twenty-four hours upon ingestion, following the mother's death. Rapid decomposition occurs following death, without assistance from maggots or other decomposer organisms. Skeletal remains will develop //Vaccinium vitis-idaea// saplings, along with spear-heading the growth of boreal plants, including Greenbrier, Posion Ivy, and Buckweed, all specimens of plants favored by Cervidaes. Following continued research, it has been determined that over eighty-two percent of forest growth within the Kananaskis County region has developed due to SCP-5523.

**Addendum No. 1: Rothenberg Incident

Sid Rothenberg, an Albertan civilian, outdoorsman and biologist, experienced a period of confusion and delirium following ingestion of venison harvested from an SCP-5523-1 specimen. An outdoor journal, kept during the period of delirium, was recovered. The following is an excerpt.

> I am sick. There is a sickness within my body, I feel it inside me. The simple explanation is maggots, improperly cooked meat. But I feel as if there is something more, something that can explain why my mind is repeating words to me. '//Greenbrier.//' '//Posion Ivy.//' '//Buckweed.//' Why are these words repeated to me? All speculation, at this point.
>
> I'm resting by the fire, waiting for rescue. I'm looking at the forest around me, hearing the rutting of elk, the cawing of crow. The howl of a wolf. Something is clear to me. The Earth is dying, and we do not notice. 
>
> I fell asleep by the light of the moon, and I dreamt of my death, my skeleton, my bones, growing across the forest, like the roots of a tree. My death will bring the forest green, and the earth as brown as the first people.
