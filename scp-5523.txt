**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the ecological niche SCP-5523 facilitates, removal of SCP-5523-1 specimens from Kananaskis Country[[footnote]] A region in Alberta, Canada, notable for its close vicinity to the Canadian Rocky Mountains. [[/footnote]] is currently prohibited. Regions containing significant SCP-5523-1 populations have been cordoned from the public, with low-level security fences established around the perimeter of SCP-5523 affected areas.

**Description:** SCP-5523 is a Terminal[[footnote]] Originally refering to an entity or anomaly that incorporates human beings into it following death. Following the discovery of SCP-5523, it has been determined that animal specimens can be incorporated into Terminal anomalies.] [[/footnote]]-Class biological behavioral change affecting female members of the Cervidaes family[[footnote]] A biological group consisting of Deers. [[/footnote]] within Kananaskis County, Canada. SCP-5523 consists of the ingestion of //Vaccinium vitis-idaea//[[footnote]] Variously known as lingonberry, partridgeberry, mountain cranberry or cowberry. [[/footnote]] berries. //Vaccinium vitis-idaea// are typically not eaten by Cervidaes specimens, due to the individual berries containing toxic substances.

SCP-5523 affected individuals[[footnote]] Designated as SCP-5523 instances. [[/footnote]] who are currently nursing will ingest great quantities of //Vaccinium vitis-idaea//, in which the poisonous materials will accumulate within the mother's milk, along with trace material of //Vaccinium vitis-idaea// seeds.  Fawn fed SCP-5523 produced milk will die within twenty-four hours upon ingestion, following the mother's death. Rapid decomposition occurs following death, without assistance from maggots or other decomposer organisms. Skeletal remains will develop //Vaccinium vitis-idaea// saplings, along with spear-heading the growth of boreal plants, including Greenbrier, Posion Ivy, and Buckweed, all specimens of plants favored by Cervidaes.

Following continued research, it has been determined that over eighty-two percent of forest growth within the Kananaskis County region has developed due to SCP-5523.
