title:Classical Revival Index Page
This is the hub page for all stories within the Classical Revival canon. For those unfamiliar with it, the Revival is an attempt to hearken back to the old, pre-Mass Edit days of the site, but with more modern sensibilities. This Foundation is smaller, more tightly-knit, and in some ways both more outrageous and more reasonable than the usual: SCPs that can be used or reasoned with are used to the fullest extent possible, harmless SCPs will have far more relaxed security measures, and incredibly dangerous ones are on the list to be destroyed as soon as possible.

Anyone wishing to write a tale set in the Classical Revival canon is more than welcome to do so, but it’s advised that you check with Dr. Djoric to make sure it does not clash with canon or planned stories.

This document will be updated as the series develops.

**The O5 Board**

Note Bene: The O5 designation was officially designated in June of 1997, and contrary to what this page said before, does //not// include the senior staff.

The O5’s, as of Interlude 1, are:

• O5-1: “Crom”

**The Senior Staff**

• Dr. Adam Pathos Crow – b.1950 – An eccentric scientist and four-time doctorate (astronomy, mechanical engineering, biology and chemistry). Blinded during a car accident in 1986: never seen without his guide dog Kain. Officially named Foundation Administrator in June 1997, though he had served the position unofficially since its beginnings.

• Dr. Connor Owen Gerry – b 1949 – A close friend and once-roommate of Dr. Crow. Injured by SCP-173 during the initial encounter, leaving him with permanent brain damage. Speaks and acts in a robotic manner. Serves as Dr. Crow’s second in command.

• Dr. Jack Bright - b. 1962 - An insufferable curmudgeon, though a brilliant one at that. Currently the body-hopping host of SCP-963.

• Dr. Sophia Light – b. 1958 – Lead of an unknown project of Crow’s alongside Drs. Mann and Glass. Currently planning on neutralizing Ukulele, and has become distrustful of Crow.

• Dr. Everett Mann - b. 1955 

• Dr. Simon Glass - b. 1953 - Staff psychiatrist. A friendly fellow, fond of horribly tacky sweaters.

• John “Yoric” Dawson - b. 1959 - Former CIA agent. Co-director of Field Agent Recruitment and Training. May or may not speak with a thick southern drawl. Fond of shooting things.

• Francis Wojciechoski - b. 1967 - A graduate student who always seems to get the short end of the stick. A lover of music in all its forms: can play alto saxophone and ukulele. A reality-bender.

* Agent Ukulele – A constructed personality designed to both use and limit Francis’ powers. Essentially a cartoon character with limited characterization, used to destroy or subdue incredibly powerful entities.
* Alto Clef – A secondary constructed personality, designed to allow Francis to operate as a normal human being.

• Agatha Rights – b. 1966 – A peer of Francis’ from graduate school.

• Cpt. Dmitri Strelkinov b. 1961 - Former USSR army captain. Co-director of Field Agent Recruitment and Training. Most certainly speaks with a thick Russian accent. Fond of shooting things. 

• Benjamin Kondraki – b. 1963 – A man who dropped out of his graduate studies to hitchhike around the world.

• “Fats” – A friend of Kondraki’s. A man of few words and a wide waist.

• “Nemo” – A friend of Kondraki’s. Never seen without his trademark fedora and greatcoat.

**Other Staff:**
• Dr. Julian Iceberg – He likes paperwork.
• Dr. Chelsea Elliott – She likes plants. Called in to replace Francis’ duties during his absence.
• Patrick Gephart – He works with the computers.
