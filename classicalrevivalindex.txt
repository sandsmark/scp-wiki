title:Classical Revival Index Page
This is the hub page for all stories within the Classical Revival canon. For those unfamiliar with it, the Revival is an attempt to hearken back to the old, pre-Mass Edit days of the site, but with more modern sensibilities. This Foundation is smaller, more tightly-knit, and in some ways both more outrageous and more reasonable than the usual: SCPs that can be used or reasoned with are used to the fullest extent possible, harmless SCPs will have far more relaxed security measures, and incredibly dangerous ones are on the list to be destroyed as soon as possible.

Anyone wishing to write a tale set in the Classical Revival canon is more than welcome to do so, but it’s advised that you check with Dr. Djoric to make sure it does not clash with canon or planned stories.

This document will be updated as the series develops.

**The Main Storyline**
