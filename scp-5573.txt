[[include component:image-block name=farwell-map.jpg|caption=SCP-5573 exclusion zone|width=300px]]
A 20 kilometer exclusion zone has been established around and above the city of Farwell, Minnesota. Cover story Finlay-Bravo ("Viral outbreak") has been put into place with the authorities of Pope County in order to establish "Federal" jurisdiction over the local area. 

All entities attempting to enter the exclusion zone from Farwell must submit to identification. Any refusal to such identification must be met with immediate and lethal force. All Foundation personnel exiting Farwell must submit to thaumaturgical scan to ensure that they are not host to any foreign entities. Refusal will result in immediate termination. 

Commercial and private air traffic flight patterns have been altered to further ensure no registered flights pass over the affected area, and station-keeping interdiction drones have been deployed in the area to enforce the no-fly zone against un-registered flights.

Four mid-range Class 2 Scranton Reality Anchors have been installed around the perimeter of St. John's Church of the Messenger in an effort to prevent the spread of SCP-5573-B and to stabilize the extra-dimensional rift within. Under no circumstances are any personnel to enter the church without prior written approval from the HMCL supervisor or the current head of Site-06. 

Anyone entering the field without permission will be immediately declared deceased and will be summarily terminated upon egress.

++++++ __**Description**__
[[/div]]
SCP-5573 is the designation given to the events and anomalies surrounding the manifestation of a Class 3 extra-dimensional portal within the St. John's Church in the town of Farwell, Minnesota.

The specific nature and physical description of the portal are unavailable due to the highly unstable fluctuations Hume levels within the church. While the deployed SRAs are able to prevent the phenomenon from spreading, they have so far been unable to successfully stabilize the area to allow for additional exploration.

++++++ **Discovery**
[[/div]]

At 1013 on July 22, 2018, the Aureole Orbital Recon Array[[footnote]]See //Project AurORA - Akiva, EVE, and Hume Spectra Analysis From Low-Earth Orbit// 2nd ed., 2001 by Dr. Emmanuel Salazar for more details on the array.[[/footnote]] detected a massive spike in localized Akiva radiation in north central United States and subsequent investigation by the Foundation led to the discovery of the ongoing phenomena within Farwell. 

This massive fluctuation was intense enough to register on Bonfield-Carizza Hume detectors throughout the central portion of North America, and the full scope of the resulting chaos has yet to be fully surveyed.

At 10:38, wide-area SRA's were able to be deployed from orbit in an attempt to stabilize the ongoing rupture in the local reality substrata. Due to the high energy requirements of these types of SRAs, the window for localized stabilization was extremely narrow.

This allowed for the insertion of a single Tau-6 strike team via drop-pod. This team was sent in to conduct search-and-report reconnaissance and has since been declared MIA. 

There are currently no plans for a retrieval operation. 

[[/div]]

++++++ **Additional Records**
[[/div]]
The expedition into SCP-5573 was conducted by MTF Tau-6, details of which were captured by intermittent burst uploads from various cameras carried about their persons. The heavy interference created by the local Hume field displacement ripples made a continuous uplink impossible. 

The wide-area SRAs were programmed to cycle through infrequent field harmonics to allow for occasional and randomly-spread moments of very localized stability in order to sync up with data uplink burst transmissions from the MTF.  

The first transmission contained the first on-ground video, a transcription of which follows.

[BEGIN LOG]

//[Helmet camera shows interior of a LOSODS[[footnote]]Low Orbit Single Occupatant Delivery System[[/footnote]] Pod. Clouds can be seen rushing past the pod's viewport.]//

**Tau-6 One:** //[Over Radio]// Keep your ears on. High Akiva, no real visuals.

//[No response is heard over the sound of the airbrakes firing.]//

**Tau-6 Five:** -and gun?

**Tau-6 Two:** No. Not stealth, but-

**Tau-6 Four:** We're dropping into unknown numbers, weapons hot. //[Pause.]// Makes me wish for the days when D-Class ran these ops.

**Tau-6 One:** Four, take overwatch. Hill on your-

//[No audio captured due to airbrakes firing.]//

**Tau-6 One:** Rest with me.

//[The opening of the canopy drowns out all audio. The LOSOD Pods make impact with the ground. Camera shows Three being launched five feet into the air before landing.]//

**Tau-6 One:** Sound off.

//[Tau-6 sounds off, all members unharmed and accounted for. The task force begins to move towards the edge of the town. The trees in the area are covered with large claw marks and a viscous reddish-black fluid. The task force climbs over several downed trees before approaching a house on the outskirts of Farwell. The door is ajar.]//

**Tau-6 One:** Three, Five. Move to breach.

//[Camera follows Three as she enters the house. The walls of the foyer are decorated with symbols of unknown origin and a trail of blood leads further down the hallway. The team moves down the hallway and enters the kitchen where a table piled high in books sits in the middle of the room. Candles cover every other surface.]//

**Tau-6 One:** Two, check the table.

//[Two approaches the table. As he reaches out to towards the books, the books ignite and rapidly burn. After two seconds, a small book is left on the table, surrounded by arcane symbols and a red liquid.]//

**Tau-6 Four:** //[Over Radio]// Heads up team. Potential hostile outside.

**Tau-6 One:** Take the shot. 

**Tau-6 Four:** //[Over Radio]// Negative, One. It's too b- No way.

**Tau-6 One:** Repeat, Four. Do you have a visual?

**Tau-6 Four:** //[Over Radio]// No, One. It shimmered and just disappeared. Unknown entity, roughly seven meters in height, some sort of armored and horned carapace on head, no eyes seen. Appeared to be scratching something into the wall of the house to your North East. 

**Tau-6 One:** Copy that. Will investigate.

**Tau-6 Two:** Should I grab the book?

**Tau-6 One:** Negative. No complications.

//[Radio static is heard for eight seconds. The team exits through the back door of the kitchen and crosses the backyard, vaulting the fence.]//

**Tau-6 One:** Four, we've entered the alley as instructed. Is the path clear?

**Tau-6 Four:** //[Over Radio]// Repeat, One?

**Tau-6 One:** You told us to exit the house immediately.

**Tau-6 Four:** //[Over Radio]// No such message given. Do not trust your com- What the hell!?

//[A shout and several gunshots are heard over the commlink.]//

**Tau-6 One:** Four? Come in, Four.

//[No response.]//

//[Five begins to nervously tap his feet on the pavement.]//

**Unknown Voice[[footnote]]Later Identified as Tau-6 Four[[/footnote]]:** RUN 

//[An opaque black hand measuring two meters across pushes through the fence to the team's right, causing the boards and slats of the fence to vanish. The hand closes around One and Two and they disappear. Three and Five begin to sprint down the alley. Three loses her footing and falls, turning over to see the hand dissolve into a golden light.]//

**Tau-6 Five:** Uh... What the fuck just happened?

**Tau-6 Three:** I have... no idea.

//[Three climbs to her feet and walks over to one of the alley fences. A hand-shaped hole is burned through the wood.]//

**Tau-6 Three:** Hey Fives, come look at this. That hand zigzagged through the alley, right? 

**Tau-6 Five:** I was busy running, sorry.

**Tau-6 Three:** Yeah yeah, running. But look at this hole, this wood looks like it was just removed, like with a laser.

**Tau-6 Four:** And? 

**Tau-6 Three:** Well, why aren't there clean-cut pieces of One and Two back there?

//[Camera feed flickers for the next thirty seconds. Feed now shows Three and Five standing in front of a concrete wall, where a crude picture of a sun and a star have been carved into the wall.]//

**Tau-6 Three:** What do you think it me-

//[Three and Five are now standing in the kitchen of the house they had come from.]// 

**Tau-6 Five:** Wait we were just-

//[A tear runs across the wall to their left and splits open, revealing a massive eye. It stares at the pair for a second before turning black and dragging the contents of the room into it. Five and Three run out the back door and enter the backyard. Both appear to be sprinting, but the fence remains approx. ten meters away. This behavior continues for five minutes.]// 

**Tau-6 Three:** Fives! Break Sideways!

**Tai-6 Five:** Heard!

//[Three abruptly moves to her left and immediately collides with the fence. The camera feed is disrupted by debris for several seconds but resumes to see a ~50-meter cone of wreckage in front of Three. The corner of a nearby house is destroyed and several small entities can be seen crawling out.]//

**Tau-6 Five:** Christ, I hate rubberbanding.

**Tau-6 Three:** We've got hostiles. Move to the alley.

//[Three draws her service rifle and starts firing on the entities. She is soon joined by Five's chaingun as they push back towards the alley.]//

The team separation placed additional strain on the interlink connections between the various members, which denied the metaconcentrated bursts from conjoined uplink attempts. While the majority of the video transmissions are believed to have been captured, the data packets retrieved had to be stitched together by Foundation .aic. 

The transcript of the second data transmission follows.

//[All Audio Lost.]//

//[All Video Lost.]//

//[Five minutes omitted for brevity.]// 

//[The sound of wood clattering can be heard, as well as the sound of human groans. One climbs to their feet.]//

**Tau-6 One:** Two?

//[Two pushes off fence slats covering him and sits up. One turns and the camera shows a room decorated in human remains. Intestines are strung from the rafters, elongating and contracting randomly. The wall opposite of door is covered in embedded human arms that twitch and grasp at nothing. As the pair move closer, the hands briefly stop moving and the palms open up, revealing a milky blue eye. Two steps forward and the arms begin moving in unison, all making the same series of gestures.]//

**Tau-6 One:** Two, get back.

**Tau-6 Two:** It's not thaumaturgy, it's ASL.

**Tau-6 Five:** Well, what's it saying?

**Tau-6 Two:** Happy Salvation Day. Over and Over.

//[Screams can be heard from the floor above the two and the heads begin bursting through the ceiling. The hands reach towards them and clench into fists, collapsing the floor everywhere but above One and Two. The room fills with small entities, their rotting flesh and skeletal systems can be seen as they turn towards the MTF.]//

**Tau-6 One:** We're cornered. Fire at will.

//[One and Two open fire into the swarm of entities.]//

//[Connection Lost.]//

It is unclear if the instability in the video feed is caused by the intermittent quality of the transmission, a failure in the stitching algorithms utilized by the .aic, or represented actual events experienced by the MTF. Retrieved dialogue seems to support the last hypothesis,  which would represent much stronger Hume/Akiva fluctuations in the local reality structure than previously indicated.

The third transmission appears to be slightly out of sync with the previous two, but it is difficult to properly ascertain whether this represents temporal fluctuations along with the reality destabilizing effects or is simply a property of the intermittent transmission lag.

Transcript of the third transmission follows.

{{Camera Powering ON.....}}

**Tau-6 Four:** Aaah. Ouch. This is Tau-6 Four. Encountered three hostiles at my position and have totally lost radio contact with the team. No comms with Overwatch Command either. Switching to rifle camera... now.

//[Camera opens to show the town of Farwell from Four's position in the hills. Movement is seen on the west side of the town.]// 

**Tau-6 Four:** Something big over there.

//[Four flicks the camera into the rifle's scope. The camera now shows a ~ten-meter tall quadrupedal reptilian entity chasing a smaller entity through a clearing]//

**Tau-6 Four:** Shit. That's a kid. Switching to explos-

//[A eight-meter tall humanoid creature is seen slowly descending on white, chiropteran wings; carrying a large spear, the head and shaft by a cascading motif of stars and suns. Its head is covered in a bony carapace and ram-like horns spiral out from the sides of its head.]// 

**Tau-6 Four:** No eyes...

//[The smaller entity lands on the ground and severs a tree with an upward motion while spinning, using the butt of the spear to launch the tree at the taller entity like an arrow. The projectile pierces the entity's shoulder and it turns, letting out a roar that carries to Four's position.]//

//[The reptilian entity lunges to towards the small child, as the smaller entity moves to intercept. The child can be seen climbing a tree in an attempt to escape. The smaller entity pierces the reptile's flank with the spear. The reptile flails, tearing the weapon from its owner's hands. Using its forepaw, it strikes the smaller entity, knocking it across the clearing. As the reptilian entity moves to attack the prone entity, Four begins firing his rifle, striking the reptile six times across the face and jaw. Moving faster than anticipated, the smaller entity grabs the spear and pushes it deeper into the reptile, the point protruding from its mouth. It then threads its fingers between the teeth of the upper and lower jaws before jerking its arms wide, tearing the creature's head in half. The body begins to smoke and light can be seen glowing inside it.]//

**Tau-6 Four:** Perhaps I'm the //Divine Intervention// here.

//[The winged entity reaches out and lifts the child from the branches of the tree and places them on its shoulder. It then turns and appears to nod in Four's direction before walking away from the town of Farwell.]// 

**Tau-6 Four:** Now. Where is the rest of-

[Connection Lost.]

The final transmission is also the most corrupted. It is believed that this is a result of the team converging upon the central locus of the powerful ripples in the local Hume field. Lambent spikes of Akiva radiation show as vermilion waves of static across the visual field. 

Again, this is unclear if it is simply a manifestation of the disruption to local reality experienced by the team, a byproduct to the disruption caused to the equipment, or the interference in the transmission burst.

The transcription of the final log follows.

//[One and Two are seen firing into the horde of entities. Despite sustaining injuries to all presumed vital areas, these creatures continue to move towards the pair.]//

**Tau-6 Two:** Running low!

//[One does not appear to hear. A creaking can be heard and the wall next to them explodes outward. Three and Five move through the gap and begin providing covering fire.]//

**Tau-6 Three:** Move! Now!

//[The team begins to run down the street as the creatures slowly pursue.]//

**Tau-6 One:** Move to the church!

//[More creatures pour out of homes and buildings and join the horde. As the team approach the town square, a 2 meter tall horned entity steps into their path holding a large metallic object.]//

**Horned Entity-1:** [[span style="font-family: 'Macondo Swash Caps', cursive; font-weight:500;"]]Split. Now![[/span]]

//[The team dive to the sides as a blue beam fires out of the metallic object and launches a dozen of the smaller pursuing entities backward. Several more horned entities, as well as Tau-6 Four, emerge on the rooftops and begin firing into the horde.]//

**Horned Entity-1:** [[span style="font-family: 'Macondo Swash Caps', cursive; font-weight:500;"]]Get in the square. We have locked them out.[[/span]]

//[The MTF stands up and begins backing up, laying down additional fire support. As they pass the horned entity, the camera feed flickers briefly.]//

**Horned Entity-1:** [[span style="font-family: 'Macondo Swash Caps', cursive; font-weight:500;"]]Twelfth Company! Stand down.[[/span]] //[Turning to One.]// [[span style="font-family: 'Macondo Swash Caps', cursive; font-weight:500;"]]Do you have injured?[[/span]] 

**Tau-6 Five:** No, we... what's going on?

**Horned Entity-1:** [[span style="font-family: 'Macondo Swash Caps', cursive; font-weight:500;"]]My name is Azazel, leader of Hell's Twelfth Company and you are actively interfering with a Class Five Demon Containment Operation. Seeing as you are not with the Horizon Initiative, you do not even remotely have clearance to be operating in this sector.[[/span]]

//[Three steps between One and Azazel.]//

**Tau-6 Three:** Hey, we're not here of our own volition.

**Azazel:** [[span style="font-family: 'Macondo Swash Caps', cursive; font-weight:500;"]]This does not change the fact you brought a horde of krulii to my doorstep and endangered my team. And you dropped in here without sanctified or desecrated weapons. Are you trying to get killed?[[/span]]

**Tau-6 Five:** //[Whispered.]// Hey, Two. How are they doing that with their mouths?

**Tau-6 Two:** I have no idea, Fives.

**Azazel:** [[span style="font-family: 'Macondo Swash Caps', cursive; font-weight:500;"]]All of you are a liability to this operation, except your teammate 'Four' up there.[[/span]] 

**Tau-6 One:** Well, we can't leave...

**Azazel:**//[Pointing.]// [[span style="font-family: 'Macondo Swash Caps', cursive; font-weight:500;"]]Go down that road. The area has been cleared and we are currently pulling out survivors. Pitch in there, or just wait in the church until we finish cleaning this up.[[/span]]

//[The MTF moves out along the route that Azazel indicated that leads away from the church.]//

**Tau-6 Five:** Hey, One? What kind of //divine// mess did we fall into? A company of devils? Fighting demons? The Horizon Initiative? 

**Tau-6 Two:** Well the Horizon Initiative is a GoI-

**Tau-6 Five:** I know that. But what is a company of devils doing in Minnesota? 

//[The team enters a street filled with rubble and makeshift tents, where humans can be seen being tended to by more devils[[footnote]]Classification pending based on additional evidence.[[/footnote]] Most of the survivors appear injured. A shout can be heard from a one-room schoolhouse down the street. A nearby devil beckons to the MTF while running in that direction.]//

**Devil-2:** [[span style="font-family: 'Macondo Swash Caps', cursive; font-weight:500;"]]If you can help, get over here![[/span]]

//[As the MTF follows the devil, the camera shows the heavily damaged schoolhouse. The outside is completely covered in symbols depicting the sun and stars and it appears to have suffered immense structural damage at some point. Two devils are struggling to keep the doorway from collapsing in on itself and taking the rest of the building with it.]// 

**Devil-3:** //[Holding door frame.]// [[span style="font-family: 'Macondo Swash Caps', cursive; font-weight:500;"]]There... are... still people in there! [[/span]]

//[The point of a sword appears from the dark doorway and swings upwards, flat against the buckling frame. The blade flexes and begins to lift the frame as five children run out and grab the legs of a woman standing nearby.  A tall figure walks through the door carrying a child. Dressed in a simple black uniform with maroon highlights, he nods for the devils at the door to let go and hands the child to the woman.//

//Waves of Akiva radiation seem to pulse from him, greatly distorting his image in the visual pickups. It randomly flickers and his form replaced by a brilliant winged figure, surrounded by a corona of coruscating washes of incandescent fire.]//

**Unknown entity:** Ah! A Mobile Task Force. I'm glad you could join us.

**Tau-6 One:** Yes, well, it wasn't exactly planned. Excuse me if I don't shake your hand, but do you mind telling us what the hell is actually going on around here?

//[The entity laughs, and the sound can be seen in the rippling waves of Akivars flooding off of him.]//

**Unknown entity:** Aren't you just the cutest? I am pretty certain that Azazel already told you that. Now, as much as I'd like to just stand around and shoot the shit with you lovely people, we're on a bit of a time table.

//[His words are punctuated by the sound of a violent concussion somewhere off the the distance. 3 seconds later another lambent spike of Akiva radiation distorts the visual field.]//

**Unknown entity:** And that is our queue to leave. Spending too much time here causes... problems. I am frankly too much of a target up here, so it's time to go! Come come. Back to the church.

//[Another spike in Akivars causes the video feed to cut out completely.]//

//[94 seconds of static omitted.]//

//[When the feed returns, the MTF is following along behind the unknown entity towards the church, where they are intercepted by Azazel and two of the winged entities. Azazel briefly bows before the unknown entity, then glances back at the MTF]//

**Azazel:** [[span style="font-family: 'Macondo Swash Caps', cursive; font-weight:500;"]]My Lord, we have the majority of the town sealed off, but it is only a matter of time before the others arrive. If we leave now we can get out before they rupture forth. Perhaps we should...[[/span]]

//[He nods back towards the MTF, and the unknown entity reaches up (across?) to gently pat the demon on it's shoulder.]//

**Unknown Entity:** Unfortunately, I think that the time has come for us to throw a little wrench into the plans. Maybe it's time to shake things up a bit, hmm?

**Azazel:** [[span style="font-family: 'Macondo Swash Caps', cursive; font-weight:500;"]]Yes, my Lord. We talked about this before, and I am afraid I must still agree with Uriel. Humans are just too unpredictable.[[/span]]

**Unknown Entity:** And that's precisely why they're coming with us.

**Tau-6 One:** Excuse me, but what? No one said anything about going anywhere. We're just here to observe and report, that's it.

**Azazel:** //[Turning to look at them.]// [[span style="font-family: 'Macondo Swash Caps', cursive; font-weight:500;"]]Your plans have changed. My Lord has decreed otherwise, and thus it shall be.[[/span]]
 
**Tau-6 Five:** Now wait just a fucking moment, I don't give a rat's fart who-

//[A massive spike of Akiva radiation emanates from the unknown entity, and for a moment his form stabilizes as the full winged entity. The MTF shield their eyes from the brilliant light, and Azazel looks away.]//

**Unknown Entity:** [[span style="font-family: 'Macondo Swash Caps', cursive; font-weight:600;"]]I have been kind. I am understanding. This is not your battle. But you are here, and I have need of you.[[/span]]

//[The glow fades and he has resumed his human form.]//

**Unknown Entity:** One thing I cannot abide is rudeness, but I am afraid I simply do not have the time for the niceties. Now, I will ask kindly. //[He smiles and spreads his hands in an expansive gesture.]// How does the title 'Savior of Heaven, Earth, and all the Hells' sound to you? Because that's precisely what I'm offering.

//[One glances around at the rest of the team, a concerned look on their face. After a moment, they look back at the entity.]//

**Tau-6 One:** Doesn't sound like we have much of a choice. //[Pausing]// Fine. First, you gotta tell us who the fuck you are.

//[The entity grins, showing a row of perfect white teeth.]//

**Unknown Entity:** Haven't you already guessed? I'm Lucifer, Herald of the Goddamn Morning.

The transmission ended there, and no more bursts uplinks were transmitted. 

12 minutes after the final transmission, the wide-area SRAs expended the last of their energy and ceased to function. A single spike of Akiva radiation was recorded before receding to a level .08 Akivars above normal. 

37 minutes later, a Foundation fast action team arrived on scene to find the town of Farwell mostly destroyed, with the civilian survivors gathered in front of St. John's Church of the Messenger.[[footnote]]The only remaining undamaged structure in the town.[[/footnote]]

Subsequent interviews revealed that the civilians had already been amnesticised and had no recollection of the events leading up to the destruction of their town. Blood tests confirmed that there was no trace of amnestic chemicals in their system, which indicates that they were not under the affect of Foundation-issued amnestics.

An additional investigation into whatever could have caused such untraceable amnesticisation is ongoing.
