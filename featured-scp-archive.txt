10. **[[[SCP-882]]]** (by Dr Gears): A Machine
* A monstrous heap of moving metal, you soon discover that it is no purposeless pile of junk.

9. **[[[SCP-055]]]** (by xtheevilecorruptor): [unknown]
* The self-keeping secret. Nobody knows what it is, nobody knows what it does. Anyone who sees it forgets about it entirely in the space of minutes.

* A beautiful globe, built by an artist group...that causes the rapid decay and disintegration of every nearby man made object...and Man itself, for that matter.  What's more, this is no accidental device, or a strange twist of time and space...//it is doing exactly what the builder wants it to do.// 

5. **[[[SCP-002]]]** (by The Administrator): The "Living" Room
* A huge ball of tissue, like a massive tumor, with a heavy hatch door, leading in to... a small, crappy apartment.  A bit of a let down... until testing shows that everything inside is made from human beings.  Woven hair, sculpted bone, and other, less pleasant, materials make up the furniture...//and SCP-002 is always looking to grow.//

4. **[[[SCP-914]]]** (by far2): The Clockworks
* A device capable of taking the simplest things, and changing them at their basest level to something else, though what it produces can vary greatly. Most often, the returned items in question can be related to the original, but other times.... //The results are unique.// 

3. **[[[SCP-294]]]** (by far2): The Coffee Machine

2. **[[[SCP-184]]]** (by Dr Gears): The Architect

1. **[[[SCP-173]]]** (by Moto42): The Sculpture
* Perhaps the first SCP ever created, no one really remembers. It stands as a shining example as to why the Foundation exists.
