As you listen to its grinding, wheezing, clicking, and whirring, you begin to hear a message; it is the voice of God, gently whispering for you to heed its call, and help it realize its enigmatic machinations.

9. **[[[SCP-055]]]**: [unknown]
* The self-keeping secret. Nobody knows what it is, nobody knows what it does. Anyone who sees it forgets about it entirely in the space of minutes.

5. **[[[SCP-002]]]**: The "Living" Room
* A huge ball of tissue, like a massive tumor, with a heavy hatch door, leading in to... a small, crappy apartment.  A bit of a let down... until testing shows that everything inside is made from human beings.  Woven hair, sculpted bone, and other, less pleasant, materials make up the furniture...//and SCP-002 is always looking to grow.//

4. **[[[SCP-914]]]**: The Clockworks
