//Kumusta, mga kasama ko sa SCP Foundation!//[[footnote]]'Hello, my co-workers in the SCP Foundation!' in Tagalog.[[/footnote]]

So, it seems that you have stumbled upon a certain Veraltanic author page. Since it may have taken you (a lot of) effort to do so, let me introduce myself.

I am a 15-year-old male who hails from Cabuyao City, Philippines. You should visit our place sometime since it's chill around here. My main interests are science (particularly physics), languages[[footnote]]My current focus is Spanish, though I have tried to learn other languages such as German, Czech, and Russian.[[/footnote]] and comedy/slice-of-life works, particularly anime and manga.

I'm primarily someone you can find at my school's newspaper club; I mainly hang out there, do a bunch of things with friends, get reminded by our school adviser that we're making a newspaper, and then write news, feature and sci-tech articles, and then hang out again. So basically, it's fun.

I have been sometimes called the laziest Editor-in-Chief the club has encountered[[footnote]]You see, I work quickly and better when no one is looking.[[/footnote]], but the paper is faring well, especially the science and technology page, which I primarily direct.

As for my (hopefully smooth) career in writing for the Foundation, I hope to establish unique stuff, like weird SCPs, canons, and GoI Formats, while I can improve my own writing style and command of the English language.

In any case, feel free to contact me with regard to journalistic matters, creative and absurd ideas, or anything else that will not break my back[[footnote]]Unfortunately, coding is not one of them. I plan to learn Python and Javascript when I have the time.[[/footnote]]. I am often active on #site19 and #thecritters, while I sometimes hang out in #site34, the Spanish branch's discord server.

Without further ado, let's get to business.

My niche primarily involves slice-of-life works and weird pieces that subtly take on social issues.
