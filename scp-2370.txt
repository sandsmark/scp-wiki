**Item #:** SCP-2370

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2370 is to be contained in a Standard Type-B Humanoid Cell and a body temperature sensor configured to monitor SCP-2370's usage of its ability to generate causal loops. Should SCP-2370's body temperature rise above 39.5ºC, SCP-2370 should immediately be sedated and treated for symptoms of hyperthermia. Following testing, it is assumed that at some point in the future, SCP-2370 will disappear in order to courier the requested item to its past self: this is to be treated as normal, as SCP-2370 will reappear in its former position several minutes later.

**Description:** SCP-2370 is an Asian male of Indonesian-Chinese descent, 27 years of age and 174 cm in height. Its face has been disfigured heavily with a bladed object; SCP-2370 has been unwilling to divulge the reason for this. SCP-2370 appears to possess no physical anomalies, however, radio and X-ray imaging have shown that SCP-2370's back has been implanted with several devices resembling sensors, connected to SCP-2370's spinal cord. The heat dissipating from said device (designated SCP-2370-A) is believed to be the cause of SCP-2370's baseline body temperature being 38.9ºC, as opposed to the typical 37ºC.

SCP-2370 has demonstrated the ability to initiate a causal loop where it can effectively obtain items and information from the future, which are couriered by its future self. In order to create such a loop, SCP-2370 enters a state where its body temperature steadily increases, before suddenly returning to baseline – immediately following this, its future self will appear to give SCP-2370 the items it requested.

As a result of this, SCP-2370 will often disappear from containment in order to complete the causal loop. SCP-2370 appears entirely unable to control the length over which the loop takes place, suggesting that it does not possess any precognitive abilities. The length of the loop in question appears to be proportional to the increase in body temperature, meaning that the scope of SCP-2370's abilities is effectively limited by the risk of hyperthermia.

When returning to the past, SCP-2370 is completely unable to perform any actions that would be secondary to returning the requested items, such as informing its past self about events from the future when a material item is requested. Following the completion of this task, it will immediately return to its prior physical and temporal location. See Document SCP-2370-A (Experiment Log) for further details.

**Discovery Log:** SCP-2370 was initially discovered following a standard search of John Does and flagged as a possible anomaly following continuing reports of SCP-2370 "cloning" itself. On ██/██/████, an incident occured during which SCP-2370 was arrested for using its anomalous properties to obtain a rifle and attempting to attack two Foundation researchers – namely, Researcher Myrna Callaghan and Researcher Iskander Sukarno. During the attack, SCP-2370 managed to render Researcher Sukarno unconscious and giving him a concussion prior to its arrest. 

Foundation assets immediately took SCP-2370 into custody as per AFP/Foundation protocol. A search of SCP-2370's possessions included a USB drive containing notes relating to its anomalous abilities, including a 148 page document detailing a possible explanation for how the device operates. The compilation of notes can be found in Document SCP-2370-EX (Collated Notes) – notably, these notes contain repeated mentions and heavy emphasis on the date SCP-2370 was taken into containment. Due to the aforementioned lack of precognitive abilities, it is unknown how it deduced this.

Researcher Callaghan has been interrogated as to how SCP-2370 knew her location and name, as well as several personal details. Callaghan has continually denied any knowledge of SCP-2370 or communications with the anomaly, apart from stating that he appeared "familiar". Unusually, due to being held at a secure location for interrogation, Researcher Callaghan's visit to Site-24 was delayed – this allowed her to avoid being injured in the breach event at Site-24 which occured the same day. Note that Document SCP-2370-EX also contained repeated references to this event and its repercussions.

**Addendum SCP-2370-1:** Results from weekly medical examinations of SCP-2370 have shown that SCP-2370 demonstrates signs of heavy metal and radiation poisoning, specifically by ^^137^^Cs. Geiger counters have confirmed that the source of this caesium is the device attached to SCP-2370's spine; if the blueprint detailed in Document SCP-2370-EX is correct, this was caused by corrosion of the metal present inside SCP-2370-A. Despite undergoing radiogardase therapy, SCP-2370's physical condition continues to deteriorate – the Ethics Committee is currently debating the issues involved with removing the device and possibly neutralising the anomaly. 

**Addendum SCP-2370-2:** The proposal was passed by the O5 Council 8-5 and the device successfully removed from SCP-2370, who has been redesignated SCP-2370-N and given Class-E status. Following the experimental confirmation of several theories detailed in Document SCP-2370-EX, an attempted reverse-engineering of SCP-2370-A[[footnote]]See Project Vonnegut Overview for further details.[[/footnote]] for the purpose of possible controlled temporal manipulation is ongoing. Due to the retrocausal effects this would entail, [[[SCP-2400]]] will be employed in order to ascertain whether or not the completed device has functioned.

> **D-Class ID:** D-12975
> 
> **Reason for D-Class Classification:** Mass murder involving abuse of SCP objects 
> 
> **Background:** D-12975 was formerly a Foundation researcher stationed at Site-24, dedicated to studying and housing temporal anomalies. During investigation of Incident Haruspex, it was found that he was responsible for the breach which caused the incident, making him directly responsible for the death of over 50 Foundation personnel. It was later found that D-12975 had attempted to use several SCP objects in an attempt to "undo" the death of a colleague in a prior breach event by going back in time to prevent the death from occuring. Despite his claim that he "would succeed" in doing so, he was re-classified as D-Class and scheduled for testing of SCP-████ prior to this experiment.

**Addendum SCP-2370-3:** Project Vonnegut appears to have succeeded in producing an observable violation of standard causality, as evidenced by the change in data. However, because of an unforeseen technical malfunction, D-12975 failed to arrive at the correct temporal location. It is believed that D-12975 was killed due to the malfunction, considering the statistically negligible probability of his survival – in addition, the radiation leakage issues present in the original iteration of SCP-2370-A were unaddressed in SCP-2370-Ω and left in as a failsafe should D-12975 escape.
