**Item:** SCP-2614

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2614 is to be kept in a locked container in the personal office of Dr. Schmidt. Requests to research SCP-2614 must be forwarded to his office.

**Description:** SCP-2614 is a DVD copy of the fifth season of drama television show //The Sopranos.// The disc itself is moderately scratched consistent with deterioration after heavy use. The object does not bear any marks of origin, although the word "BOOKSHELF" written in black marker obscures the title logo on the top face.

When played, SCP-2614 is non-anomalous unless an action is performed during a scene where a character is watching the film █████ ██████. If the Play button is pressed on any working remote device, the viewer becomes able to control the camera view through the directional pad and a center button used for forward movement. The camera is free-moving and fully maneuverable. Upon the performance of this action, it is not possible to revert to the previous non-anomalous state without ejecting the object and thoroughly cleaning with isopropyl alcohol.

After assuming control of the camera, the show's setting will begin to elapse in real-time. It is not possible to fast forward or rewind. Judging by the apparent in-universe date at the outset, the user would have to wait three days and fourteen hours and navigate the camera to the DiMeo Crew's strip club hangout to be present for the next chronological broadcast scene. Characters have also been observed to continue interacting after what would originally have been a scene transition.

The viewpoint cannot pass through solid objects. If maneuvered out of the Sopranos residence, it is theoretically possible to ascend to deep space, although this is not feasible given the rate of travel.

The movement of this observational point is not bounded in three-dimensions. Recent research has succeeded in navigating the camera to Boston, MA. It appears that the world depicted contains numerous cities populated by actual individuals. However, despite the show's realism, its own stylistic flourishes and nature as a television show continue to be apparent, such as major characters being unusually audible in social settings. These - what might be referred "meta-anomalies" - are not commented on by characters or "bystanders".

The POV itself cannot manipulate the environment (with the sole exception of Document 2614-10 available below) but is capable of interacting with fictional visual media if directed into a television or computer screen. 

Researchers concede the impossibility of fully mapping these memetic universes although efforts are ongoing. Since these mediums can potentially differ radically from their parent universe - such as actors existing as their actual character portrayal - it is possible to enter alternate or unknown media.

What follows is a transcript log of mimetic travel and accounts of what can be referred to as extra- or supra-canonical material.

**Universe:** //Snow White//
**Diegetic Date:** [REDACTED]
**Description:** POV maneuvered from Dorothy character's Kansas Home to a private showing of the Disney film in Denver. POV was subsequently directed upwards, and once having gained a sufficient altitude, descended on a continent east of the events of the film. In this continent, researchers discovered a young man who must hunt a boar-like monster to win the hand of a virgin princess. It was revealed the princess' stepmother is a dark sorceress and had been manipulating the events to ensure the crown for her youngest son. As there are obviously no television sets in this setting, testing was suspended and resumed in home universe.

**Universe:** //Goodfellas//
**Diegetic Date:** [REDACTED]
**Description:** POV ordered to inspect the cockpit of a helicopter Ray Liotta's character fears to be the federal authorities. Upon inspection, helicopter pilot revealed to be a civilian.

**Universe:** //Gladiator//
**Diegetic Date:** [REDACTED]
**Description:** Encountered playing in the home of a character known for his love of the film. When entered, POV traveled to southern Antioch to see the earliest Christian churches. The churches themselves were considerably more elaborate and lavish than their real world counterparts, typical of Rome's depiction in the actual film. 

**Universe:** //The Sopranos// 
**Diegetic Date:** Date in final broadcast episode, "Made in America"
**Description:** After SCP-2614's effects were understood, a research team made a copy of SCP-2614 and discovered its effects were replicable. A subgroup of the research team were told to let the DVD play until the in-universe date of the series finale. During the final scene, the diner's lighting becomes a deep red color [DATA EXPUNGED]
