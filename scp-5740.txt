**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation assets are to identify, locate and shutter all instances of SCP-5740. Individuals affected by instances of SCP-5740-A are to be remanded to Site-57 for analysis and medical treatment. 

**Description:** SCP-5740 is a series of pop-up restaurants that appeared in the ██████████, █████████ area starting on June 5th, 2020. The restaurants are small, cubical structures with no discernible openings save for a small metal chute next to a touchscreen interface on, presumably, the front side of the structure. The entire remaining surface of the building is covered in advertisements for the building itself. These ads identify the restaurants as "dado-nuts by dado".

[[include component:image-block name=donut2.png|align=right|caption=Touchscreen interface of SCP-5740.]]

Gathering from the advertisements on the exterior of the various instances of SCP-5740, as well as from television advertisements that were purchased to run in the area at the time, SCP-5740 is a stand-up donut shop that advertises specifically to members of local law enforcement. In contrast to the supportive tone of many of the advertisements, the donuts (hereafter identified as SCP-5740-A) are not conducive to human health.

When a member of law enforcement approaches SCP-5740, a jingle will begin to play from within the structure. Afterwards, the touchscreen interface will activate, encouraging the individual to press a red button on screen to receive a donut. Once this is done, an instance of SCP-5740-A will drop out of the metal chute.

Note that instances of SCP-5740-A only generate when SCP-5740 is activated by members of law enforcement. SCP-5740 will still activate when others approach, but will typically drop non-anomalous donuts of varying shapes and designs based on the person's profession. A full list of known deviations is available below:

||~ **Subject**||~ **Outcome**||
||Civilian||Glazed donut||
||Healthcare Worker||Donut with white frosting and red cross sprinkles||
||EMT||Donut with chocolate frosting and a bottle of Gatorade||
||Firefighter||Donut with red frosting and blue water droplet sprinkles||
||National Guard||Cake donut with the word "behave" written across it in red frosting||
||Law Enforcement||SCP-5740-A||

The effects of SCP-5740-A are typically not observed until roughly 4-6 hours post-consumption. Affected individuals will briefly experience stomach discomfort and bloating, followed by extreme diarrhea. Immediately afterwards, the subject will begin to excrete a domesticated pig (//Sus domesticus//) from their rectum. How this animal, which is otherwise non-anomalous, manifests within the subject's bowels is currently poorly understood. 

How the size of the excreted hog is determined is a point of ongoing discussion among SCP-5740 researchers. While there appears to be no correlation between the size of the animal and the size of the subject, there does appear to be at least a mild relationship between the size of the animal and the disciplinary record of the subject. Officers with fewer disciplinary offenses or who had commendations for service to their community typically excrete smaller hogs. However, those with records that indicate they have been the subject of disciplinary action, or who have taken actions in their line of work that should warrant disciplinary action, regardless of whether or not they were disciplined, are more likely to excrete hogs of considerably larger sizes.

[[include component:image-block name=pig.jpg|align=left|caption=Various hogs excreted from members of the ███████████ Police Department.]]

Despite the vast disparity in some cases between the size of the excreted hog and the size of the subject's anus, the bodies of affected individuals are anomalously capable of passing the swine, though not without effort. In many cases, the act of passing a four to five hundred pound hog can take many hours and be excruciatingly painful for the affected individual. This, coupled with the fact that the hogs in question are almost always panicked upon their formation within the rectum, often results in the process being extremely traumatic for both the subject and the excreted hog. 

The traumatized anuses and rectums of affected subjects will eventually recover and return to their pre-anomalous state, typically over the course of several weeks and with medical therapy. However, to date no subject who has passed a hog larger than 20kg has ever fully regained complete control over their sphincter.

**Addendum 5740.1:** Communication with POI "dado"

Shortly after the discovery of the first instance of SCP-5740, it was also discovered that the touchscreen interface could be manipulated to reveal a text interface. This interface appears to be solely for processing refunds; however, a large sign just above the interface boldly states "no refunds".

Using this interface, Foundation agents attempted to communicate with the POI "dado".

**Addendum 5740.2:** Ongoing Containment Attempts

During the teardown of one instance of SCP-5740[[footnote]]The interiors of SCP-5740 were revealed to be empty[[/footnote]], Agent Derek Mills accidentally pressed the button on SCP-5740, which produced an instance of SCP-5740-A from within the structure. A small piece of paper was stuck into the donut, which read as follows:

||~ **subject**||~ **outcomings**||
||foundationman who is assault dado business||dado special blend||

The SCP-5740-A instance in question was revealed to be a stale donut with a bitter frosting. The frosting was later revealed to be 92% guinea pig feces by weight.
