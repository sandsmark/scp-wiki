title:Thy Will Be Done
The two men quickly walked down the hall, pushing the small cloth-covered cart in front of them.  A sudden door slam far behind them made the older man cry out, to be quickly stifled by the younger as they picked up their pace.

“This is wrong…we shouldn’t be doing this.  They are going to find out, they have eyes everywhere…” the older man looked about the ceilings, seeing to search for cameras.

“Just shut up and get it to the labs…once we’re there, we can just say it got spat out from some test.  It’s shift change, and as long as nothing hits the fan, they won’t look over hallway tapes that closely.” The younger man scratched his arm nervously, pushing the cart at just under a run.  “Besides…we’d never get it up and running without this stuff.  We need it, and The Foundation would never let us have it without years of testing.  Just shut up, smile, and nod at the right times.”

The older man grumbled as he pushed open a heavy door, letting out a puff of very cool, well-filtered air.  “I still think this is a bad idea.  Dr. Valence may have told us to get this done by any means, but I really doubt he meant this.”  The younger man sighed, shaking his head as he pushed the cart past the older man and into the room.  “Listen, all that matters is the bottom line.  Its two years of research into biomechanics, polymorphic computational components, and tons of red tape, or an hour with a screwdriver and some sterile gloves.  Now shut the damn door so we can get in the clean room.”  The older man complied, grumbling something about a church as the door swung shut.

Neither noticed the small drop of grey liquid that had dripped from the cart.  Neither noticed it suddenly gain surface tension and roll like a washed out drop of mercury as well.  The blob quickly slid under the microscopic gap under the door, and rolled quickly up the outside of the older man’s pant leg, before hopping across and sliding back under the cloth covering the cart.  Both men were too absorbed in the task at hand to notice the small shift under the cloth, and too focused on the robotic frame in front of them to contemplate it even if they had noticed it.

He sat in the middle of the smoke.  He sat and inhaled deeply, eyelids fluttering sweat dripping from his body to mix with the soot and ash on his skin.  The smoke was strong, and smelled of machine oil, wood, coal and flesh as it billowed from four grates in the floor, pooling in a noxious cloud in the ceiling as the ash rained down.  He opened his mouth, and exhaled the smoke, pouring forth the ash and soot as would the Lord.  Truly he felt the touch of God, felt his body within his own, his flesh within-

A sudden knock on the unseen door broke his concentration, causing him to cough on the suddenly biting and acrid smoke.  A few choking, horse commands caused the grates to snap shut and the ceiling to open, the smoke quickly venting away.  He pulled on the heaped robe he had hung in the corner, still coughing and silently cursing whoever had broken his communion.  He wrenched open the door, letting a thin yellow light spill in.  “I swear to you, if this is any less then a message of the utmost end of need, I will personally head up an Inquisition on your behalf.”

The young girl kneeling in the hall trembled, wincing and trying to shrink into an even smaller heap.  “I…I was…told…” she stammered, near tears, her voice starting to waver.  He sighed, crouching down and taking her chin in his hand, tilting her face up to see her green eyes nearly drowning in unwept tears.  He smiled, the black ash and soot causing his teeth to shine even whiter.  “Ease, my child…I was in deep communion with the Lord.  Your coming scattered His Voice…it is not your fault.  Calm yourself, and speak.”  The girl rubbed her face with her wrist, managing a small smile before blushing slightly and looking away.  “I…was told to come and tell you that the Will of God had been delivered to the Jailors.”

He blinked several times, the girl shyly looking back and smiling, but his returning grin was not for her.  Indeed, his eyes appeared to be miles away as he asked “Who has done this great thing?  Who has delivered Salvation to the Corrupted?”  “Brother Jacob,” said the girl, watching as he rose again, “he is still coming back, but I was told that the Will had been given over freely to them.”  He quickly stepped around her, striding down the hall without a word, leaving her still kneeling and watching is quickly receding form.  Truly, he thought as he quickly went to meet with the Faithful, God is great.  Even as he is Broken, the portions of the Lord can still do his Will.
