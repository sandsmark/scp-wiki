title:Thy Will Be Done
The two men quickly walked down the hall, pushing the small cloth-covered cart in front of them.  A sudden door slam far behind them made the older man cry out, to be quickly stifled by the younger as they picked up their pace.

“This is wrong…we shouldn’t be doing this.  They are going to find out, they have eyes everywhere…” the older man looked about the ceilings, seeming to search for cameras.

“Just shut up and get it to the labs…once we’re there, we can just say it got spat out from some test.  It’s shift change, and as long as nothing hits the fan, they won’t look over hallway tapes that closely.” The younger man scratched his arm nervously, pushing the cart at just under a run.  “Besides…we’d never get it up and running without this stuff.  We need it, and The Foundation would never let us have it without years of testing.  Just shut up, smile, and nod at the right times.”

The older man grumbled as he pushed open a heavy door, letting out a puff of very cool, well-filtered air.  “I still think this is a bad idea.  Dr. Valence may have told us to get this done by any means, but I really doubt he meant this.”  The younger man sighed, shaking his head as he pushed the cart past the older man and into the room.  “Listen, all that matters is the bottom line.  It's two years of research into biomechanics, polymorphic computational components, and tons of red tape, or an hour with a screwdriver and some sterile gloves.  Now shut the damn door so we can get in the clean room.”  The older man complied, grumbling something about a church as the door swung shut.

Neither noticed the small drop of grey liquid that had dripped from the cart.  Neither noticed it suddenly gain surface tension and roll like a washed out drop of mercury as well.  The blob quickly slid under the microscopic gap under the door, and rolled quickly up the outside of the older man’s pant leg, before hopping across and sliding back under the cloth covering the cart.  Both men were too absorbed in the task at hand to notice the small shift under the cloth, and too focused on the robotic frame in front of them to contemplate it even if they had noticed it.

He sat in the middle of the smoke.  He sat and inhaled deeply, eyelids fluttering, sweat dripping from his body to mix with the soot and ash on his skin.  The smoke was strong, and smelled of machine oil, wood, coal and flesh as it billowed from four grates in the floor, pooling in a noxious cloud in the ceiling as the ash rained down.  He opened his mouth, and exhaled the smoke, pouring forth the ash and soot as would the Lord.  Truly he felt the touch of God, felt his body within his own, his flesh within-

A sudden knock on the unseen door broke his concentration, causing him to cough on the suddenly biting and acrid smoke.  A few choking, hoarse commands caused the grates to snap shut and the ceiling to open, the smoke quickly venting away.  He pulled on the heaped robe he had hung in the corner, still coughing and silently cursing whoever had broken his communion.  He wrenched open the door, letting a thin yellow light spill in.  “I swear to you, if this is any less then a message of the utmost end of need, I will personally head up an Inquisition on your behalf.”

The young girl kneeling in the hall trembled, wincing and trying to shrink into an even smaller heap.  “I…I was…told…” she stammered, near tears, her voice starting to waver.  He sighed, crouching down and taking her chin in his hand, tilting her face up to see her green eyes nearly drowning in unwept tears.  He smiled, the black ash and soot causing his teeth to shine even whiter.  “Ease, my child…I was in deep communion with the Lord.  Your coming scattered His Voice…it is not your fault.  Calm yourself, and speak.”  The girl rubbed her face with her wrist, managing a small smile before blushing slightly and looking away.  “I…was told to come and tell you that the Will of God had been delivered to the Jailors.”

He blinked several times, the girl shyly looking back and smiling, but his returning grin was not for her.  Indeed, his eyes appeared to be miles away as he asked “Who has done this great thing?  Who has delivered Salvation to the Corrupted?”  “Brother Jacob,” said the girl, watching as he rose again, “he is still coming back, but I was told that the Will had been given over freely to them.”  He quickly stepped around her, striding down the hall without a word, leaving her still kneeling and watching is quickly receding form.  Truly, he thought as he quickly went to meet with the Faithful, God is great.  Even as he is Broken, the portions of the Lord can still do his Will.

“Dr. Valence, a question:  why do you call it ‘hatbot’?  Isn’t there something a little more…appropriate?”  Dr. Valence shook his head, still grinning at the assembled staff.  Behind him stood a small, slightly skeletal android, with what appeared to be a top hat pulled three quarters of the way down on its “head”, leaving only a small LCD screen displayed below it.  To the robot’s left stood a nervous older man with a nametag reading “Prof. Grommet”, and to its right stood a beaming young man in a suit, whose name tag declared him as “Agent Gild”.

Dr. Valence shook his finger playfully at the staff member who had asked the question.  “Now now young man…didn’t anyone teach you not to question your elders?”  The assembled staff chuckled, and the questioning doctor’s face started to take on a mild shade of red.  “Yes, Hatbot does seem like a very silly name, however during the initial testing, the processing unit looked very similar to a top hat.  We’ve moved away from that design with the now completed prototype, however the name has stuck.  Also, the somewhat…whimsical configuration allows for more acceptance and ease of interaction.”  The good doctor continued to beam like a proud father as he gestured to Dr. Grommet, who quickly reached over and pressed a sequence of buttons on the robot’s back.

The robot suddenly sprang up in a slight hop, before landing several inches forward of its original position, causing many of the staff to abruptly retreat several steps, a few of them even producing weapons.  The LCD screen below the top hat suddenly lit up, and the robot raised one skeletal, wire-wrapped arm and waved to the staff, while a small animated cartoon mouth appeared on the LCD and a voice emanated from it.  “Hello, I am Hatbot!  Hatbot I am.  Hello!”

Silence dominated the room for several seconds.  Dr. Valence’s smile faltered a moment as he observed none of the staff to be abandoning their position of retreat.  Or their firearms.  “Hatbot, don’t be rude,” he said, keeping the nervousness from his voice with a small effort, “Let the nice people know what you are.”  The robot suddenly snapped to attention, and rattled off the lines not unlike a new army recruit.  “Hatbot is a speech recognition, interpretation, and deciphering system!  Hatbot’s polymorphic computational matrix is able to adapt, interpret, and utilize any form of vocal or written communication!”

Dr. Valence was suddenly bombarded with questions as the staff overcame their initial concern with the desire to know more.  Several began to test Hatbot’s speech capabilities, watching as it not only parroted back words, but then use them in new sentences.  Dr. Valence described various technical details, and laid out his proposal to use it to decipher some of the unreadable texts and untranslatable languages that The Foundation had been unable to crack.

“Doctor, how did you develop a processor capable of such advanced communication recognition in such a short time?  You’ve only had this project a few months, it seems almost impossible.”  Everyone was too engrossed in Dr. Valence’s reply about “late night 914 work” and Hatbot’s slightly confusing responses to notice the sudden cold sweat break out on Professor Grommet’s face, and the harsh, silencing look from Agent Gild.  The staff started to slowly filter out as Dr. Valence stated his need to run more tests.  Two lingered, however, watching Hatbot and the two men who stood slightly behind them.

“What’s wrong boy?  Got the scent?  Did Timmy fall down the well?” the short woman asked, using a tone better reserved for a small, over-eager puppy. 

The tall man in the outlandish hat to whom this statement was addressed continued to stare and grin at the small robot.  “That is the most evil thing I've seen in years," he said, continuing to smile cheerfully.  "I think there’s a world-destroying demon in it.”  

The woman laughed, swatting his arm.  “Oh would you lay off the ‘I’m The Devil, booga booga!’ crap?  It’s a weird little socially awkward robot who has issues communicating normally.  Basically someone made a fun-size Dr. Gears."  

"I shouldn't leave. Every time I do, things go to pot. I don't know why I let Glass convince me to do this," the tall man muttered. The pom-poms on the rim of his hat swayed gently. "Maybe I should cancel. Tell the others I'm staying here, just to be sure."

"Don't be such a stick-up the ass. Try to relax, you're on vacation. Now, can we please go?”  She grabbed his arm, starting to tug him away, and he reluctantly followed, craning his neck to try and still see the robot.  

Had he hesitated a few seconds more before being pulled through the doorway, he would have noticed the sudden flicker in the mouth screen.  It was quickly back to its normal, smiling mouth, but for a moment, it displayed a roiling, bubbling mass of grey strings, wavering against an oily, black background.
