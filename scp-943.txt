**Item #:** SCP-943

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-943 is to be stored in a secure lockbox in a High Security Containment Vault, accessible only to Level 2 or higher personnel. For purposes of interrogation, Level 1 personnel may request access to SCP-943, but the request must be approved by Level 2 personnel, and the individual signing SCP-943 out must record a date, time, location of use, and appropriate protective measures taken to preserve SCP-943's integrity. Failure to do so will result in all personnel involved having their service records subject to immediate review and penalties of demotion or termination for those found negligent.

**Description:** SCP-943 is a band of unidentified metal, adjustable through a sliding mechanism to become anywhere from 5cm in diameter, to 38cm in diameter. The band bears inscribings along its outside surface reading in English: "That Justice may flow like water". When placed onto a human subject's arm, the device appears to induce visual, auditory, and tactile hallucinations in a staggered pattern. In all cases, the hallucinations appear to be of a event that is connected to the subject in some way. Invariably, the subject is connected in a way that makes them the aggressor, and in the induced hallucinations, the subject assumes the role of victim. All recorded hallucinations have been of conflict, and are documented in Experiment Log 943-1 through Experiment Log 943-3.

**Addendum:** In each experiment, the subject was prepared by repeatedly reminding them of the crime that caused their incarceration, causing it to be foremost in their minds prior to the beginning of the recording.

> Subject D-39393 is guilty of multiple incidents of embezzlement as an employee of a Foundation cover company. 
> 
> Dr. Heiden: D-39393, put on the bracelet.
> 
> D-39393: You can't make me do this, you know! I'm a citizen of ██████████████████████████████!
> 
> Dr. Heiden: Actually, D-39393, we can, according to the terms of your employment agreement. You know, the one
> that you /never read/ because of the big number on the first page.
> 
> D-39393: [splutters incoherently] Uh, ah, that doesn't mean anything! You still can't do this! I'm a person, not cattle for you to use!
> 
> Dr. Heiden: I am aware you are not livestock. Now put on the bracelet, and you'll be on your way to repaying 
> the $██,███,███ you owe.
> 
> D-39393: You never proved that! You can't prove any of that!
>  
> Dr. Heiden: D-39393, you will be sedated and the bracelet will be placed on you if you continue to resist. Now 
> **put on the bracelet**.
> 
> D-39393: Fuck you! You won't do that, you can't do th-
> 
> [At this point, Foundation security personnel neutralized D-39393 with a stun baton and strapped him into the 
> chair nearby, waiting until D-39393 regained consciousness before placing SCP-XXX on his arm.]
> 
> Dr. Heiden: The debt repaid by your participation has been reduced by ten percent due to your refusal to 
> cooperate, Mr. ███████. Further refusal will result in accordingly more severe dockings. Now, tell me how you feel.
> 
> D-39393: Uh... I don't feel anything, really. A bracelet on my arm, now... the hell is that thing, anyway?
> 
> Dr. Heiden: Just keep giving me updates, Mr. ███████.
> 
> D-39393: I... I guess I feel a little nervous. No, a lot nervous... God, what is this thing?
>  
> Dr. Heiden: You're doing well, keep it up.
>  
> [The subject is sweating profusely and has an elevated heart rate.]
>  
> D-39393: I am so, so fucked... [D-39393 begins to sob softly]
>  
> [D-39393 continues in this vein for approximately five and a half minutes.] 
>  
> D-39393: Oh, man... man... [D-39393 perks up slightly] Wait - shh, did you hear that? Fuck...
> 
> Dr. Heiden: What do you hear, D-39393?
>  
> D-39393: ...uh, voices... real faint, though, trying to hear 'em.
> 
> Dr. Heiden: Continue, Mr. ███████.
>  
> D-39393: Yeah, yeah... hey, how's it going? God, it sounds like I'm back at work... just a bunch of noise.
> 
> Dr. Heiden: Subject appears to be switching from talking to the voices addressing him and myself.
> 
> [Approximately three minutes pass, the subject muttering rapidly to nothing in particular before his voice rises again]
> 
> D-39393: Yeah... no, I hadn't seen the budg- gah! Sorry, I didn't see you there... you want to show me a ledger? 
> Well, alright...
> 
> D-39393: Uh, no, I don't know what happened... no, of course not.  No, no, it wasn't me! I don't know where the fuck
> it went!
> 
> Dr. Heiden: Mr. ███████, can you hear me? Hello?
> 
> D-39393: Please, it wasn't me! ...what? Tell the Overseers? Me? 
> 
> Dr. Heiden: Note for the record - D-39393 ought not have been aware of the existence of O-5 level personnel,
> considering his position held prior to becoming D-class personnel.
> 
> D-39393: [his voice rising to a shriek] No, I am //not// telling the Overseers that we're missing over
> █████████████████████ when I had nothing to do with this! 
> 
> D-39393: You do it! I'm not going to get turned into Keter-bait because of some fucking accounting error! We've
> got to find where the fuck this went before /they/ do!
> 
> Dr. Heiden: Terminating recording, the subject has clearly demonstrated all three stages of hallucinatory patterns.
> 
> D-39393 will remain under Foundation control until his debt is repaid... Experiment XXX-1 has erased $███,███ of his 
> debt to the Foundation, less ten percent.
> 
> LEVEL 4 EYES ONLY: Subject D-39393 cannot be removed from Foundation employment, having demonstrated
> knowledge of O-5 level personnel in this experiment and a marked unethical bent in the actions leading to his 
> incarceration. Current recommendation upon release is termination.

> D-14454: Naw, I don't have to do that. Put me back in my cell, I want my lawyer.
> 
> Dr. Heiden: You will not be afforded the luxury of a lawyer, D-14454. Put on the bracelet or you will be terminated

> 
> D-14454: Shh. Shhhh, it'll find me! I... I think I can hear it!
> 
> [D-14454 recoils in his seat, pressing himself as deeply into the steel frame as possible]
> 
> D-14454: [whispering] Doctor, get me out of here, please, please...
> 
> Dr. Heiden: The experiment is not complete, D-14454. We will proceed.
> 
> D-14454: Shhh!
> 
> [Four minutes pass]

> 
> D-14454: It heard me! It heard me! //It heard me!//
> 
> [D-14454 begins struggling against the chair's restraints]
> 
> D-14454: It can **see** me!

> 
> Dr. Heiden: The bracelet, D-31415.
> 
> D-31415: This thing?
> 
> [D-31415 picks up and examines the bracelet]
> 
> D-31415: ...'that justice may flow like water'... hah. Really, Doctor? You're using me as a test subject on //this//?
> 
> Dr. Heiden: Yes, we are, D-31415. Put the bracelet on or it will be put on you.
