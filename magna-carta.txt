[[[SCP-3531]]] - Skyfood

[[collapsible show="probably will be my best title" hide="that does not bode well for my future titles"]]
this article came to me after looking through my window right after my plane took off and seeing that the plane's shadow looked kind of like a swordfish. from then i just came up with more sea related imagery on a plane. this is a strange thing for me to have written, something primarily imagery-based, and i don't think i'll write a lot more like this in the future. but who knows?

[[[SCP-4543]]] - Dead Men Sell No Sales

[[collapsible show="zombies" hide="sharply dressed charismatic zombies"]]
i came up with this idea off of the incredibly dumb title, and then also based off of an SCP inspired storyline i was working on about an AI named Seraph that did fleshcrafting and a whole bunch of lovecraftian what have you. obviously very little of that went into this, but i think that would explain where all the weird shit in this thing comes from. body horror, funnily enough, is also not something that i would say is generally in my area of expertise, but i'm quite proud of this one.

[[[SCP-4232]]] - Thought Crustacean

[[collapsible show="you like art? you like lobsters?" hide="i know i do"]]
i honestly don't know where i got this idea. originally this was going to be way more technical and science-fictiony and full of jargon, with a bunch of noosphere stuff, but then at some point i got really frustrated with myself and the SCP wiki and i decided to take it out on this poor little draft. now that i think about it, taking random things and colliding them seems to be a pretty big part of my writing process.
