this article came to me after looking through my window right after my plane took off and seeing that the plane's shadow looked kind of like a swordfish. from then i just came up with more sea related imagery on a plane. this is a strange thing for me to have written, something primarily imagery-based, and i don't think i'll write a lot more like this in the future. but who knows?

i came up with this idea off of the incredibly dumb title, and then also based off of an SCP inspired storyline i was working on about an AI named Seraph that did fleshcrafting and a whole bunch of lovecraftian what have you. obviously very little of that went into this, but i think that would explain where all the weird shit in this thing comes from. body horror, funnily enough, is also not something that i would say is generally in my area of expertise, but i'm quite proud of this one.

i honestly don't know where i got this idea. originally this was going to be way more technical and science-fictiony and full of jargon, with a bunch of noosphere stuff, but then at some point i got really frustrated with myself and the SCP wiki and i decided to take it out on this poor little draft. now that i think about it, taking random things and colliding them seems to be a pretty big part of my writing process.

you can thank [[*user Rounderhouse]] for the inspiration of this one. this draft started when he was incredibly bent on the chicago spirit. at the time, i myself was way into fifthism (still am) and we would occasionally banter about which was the better GoI. after a while, i proposed this GoI format to him, to which he replied "a union for the ages" and so i started on it the next day. appropriately enough, a long ass period of me not working on it meant i released it 5 months after i started working on it. this is yet another example of me shoving two things together and making it work.

[[[Crushing Your Dreams]]] - Collab-Con 2019 entry

[[collapsible show="i swear half the reason this format exists is to fit in as many easter eggs as possible" hide="i should have added more"]]
as my impromptu subtitle states, this was indeed my collab con entry. i wrote most of my contributions over the course of 2 days, and barely had any time to implement feedback, so this is //almost// a coldpost. had it not been for the GOC tweets and the early on complaints of "corporeal organizations" then this would be a coldpost. regardless, this was written as a comedic exercise in how the internet reacts to the apocalypse, driven by a plot about fifthism and corp/pure tension.
