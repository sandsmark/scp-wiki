Apparently I get to make one of these now. This version is mostly a placeholder, and will be updated as I improve it.

**Overview:** Existential imagery and dumb jokes ahoy! This be CryonicAutumn! 
I'm relatively new, but I tend to throw myself into things I like. If you've got a question about competitive or speed chess feel free to send me a PM.

**Hit:** Dumb humor, absurdism when done well, techno that isn't dubstep, [*http://www.mspaintadventures.com/sweetbroandhellajeff/ Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff][[footnote]] and the parent comic, don't @ me [[/footnote]], existential horror, Advance Wars 2 (where I shamelessly stole this format from), chess, parkour (even if I'm not terribly good at it).

**Miss:** --I guess they never miss, huh?-- My sense of humor sometimes.



**Collected works:**
[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4903 SCP-4903: Eternity, Served Cold]. The least deadly thing the Foundation has ever found. My first SCP, and one that I am extremely proud of despite rocky beginnings. Existential horror and weird ideas await. I might also bring in Dr. Elmsway for later projects, as I'm happy with the character I created there.

[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3034-J SCP-3034-J: Voresnake]. Yeah, uh, we don't talk about this one. Moving on.
-----
[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-939-j SCP-939-J: Crime Time Canine]. Full disclosure: I got the idea from this after an uproarious round of Secret Lab.[[footnote]] Turns out you can get away with pretty much anything if you're decent at improv comedy in that game.[[/footnote]] Another one that I'm proud of.
-----
[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4312 SCP-4312: Drift Into the Sky]. Prouda this one. A somewhat melancholy one. First draft was written in about an hour of inspiration at midnight or so. Fortunately, I worked out the issues brought on by writing that late at night.[[footnote]] he says, updating his author page at 1 am [[/footnote]]
