Apparently I get to make one of these now. This version is mostly a placeholder, and will be updated as I improve it.

**Collected works:**
[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4903 SCP-4903: Eternity, Served Cold]. The least deadly thing the Foundation has ever found. My first SCP, and one that I am extremely proud of despite rocky beginnings. Existential horror and weird ideas await. I might also bring in Dr. Elmsway for later projects, as I'm happy with the character I created there.

[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3034-J SCP-3034-J: Voresnake]. Yeah, uh, we don't talk about this one. Moving on.

[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-939-j SCP-939-J: Crime Time Canine]. Full disclosure: I got the idea from this after an uproarious round of Secret Lab. Another one that I'm proud of.

More to come!
