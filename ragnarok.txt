++ Baseline
A Ragnarok event refers to an apocalyptic event either caused by or directly related to a set of two related anomalies, the World Tree and Niddhogg. ##609217|On my world it is the Tree of Knowledge and the Serpent.##  ##ff004d|ive heard it was some crocodile motherfucker##  ##491792|The name isn’t what is important. Continue, Gnosis.## The Tree is the physical form of all of the dominant species' knowledge. It can manifest in various ways, but at one point it usually manifests as an extremely large tree, for the anomaly to center around, after which Niddhogg appears. Niddhogg is a dragon-like entity manifesting around the World Tree. Niddhogg is aggressive to the Tree and tries to destroy it. ##491792|It seems to be attracted to secrets, as those are the weakest parts of the Tree. ##  When the parts of tree are destroyed, the information that branch represents is erased from existence, which can begin a Ragnarok event.
++ Prerequisite
For the Tree to exist, the dominant species must be sapient and have developed a language system and stories. As those prerequisites are extremely general, the Tree is present in a vast number of realities. The Ragnarok events themselves are less common. While the presence of a Tree, in some form, is necessary for a Ragnarok Event to occur, the presence of a Tree does not guarantee a Ragnarok Event. Certain events can lessen or increase the changes of Ragnarok occurring: the existence of the Foundation increases the chances by about 75%; conversely, the existence of the Serpent’s Hand decreases the chances by about 30%, due to their desire to share anomalous information.
++ Vunerability
##609217|The only way to totally keep Ragnarok from happening is to make sure you keep the Knowledge flowing.  You damn up a river, and everything gets all stagnant and dies.  That’s hard, but there’s things that can help.  So, like, ‘Breaking the Masquerade,’ right?  For any Timeline’s major info horder, you have them throw open the vault doors, see?  Sometimes that knocks the Ragnarok chances down to nothing. ## ##ff004d|lol how does that help## ##609217|Knowledge flowing free makes the Tree strong, so there’s only so much Nidhogg or the Serpent or whatever can do.  Take a few bites, the tree grows back.  It’s kinda cool, really.  So they’re both these, like, metaphysical enti- ## ##ff004d|we get it, its magic bullshit. lets keep moving##

++ Instance: Timeline A-128
The Foundation had a very strong presence in this timeline meaning the population was more dependent on it. The entity consumed the concept of the Foundation, effectively destroying it. The multitude of anomalies contained by the foundation remained, and wreaked havoc amongst the population. Only a few survivors remain to this day. ##609217|Yeah, that happens a lot.## Indeed.
++ Instance: Timeline A-343:
 ##ff004d|my timeline! no apocalypse yet here, things are pretty chill. we got some weird trees that show up sometimes though, i think thats connected? they get attracted to smart people and books or some crap like that. one grew in my roomates face a while back. pretty funny##  ##491792|Wait a minute, in?##  ##ff004d|yeah. it was kinda hilarious##  ##491792|Oh my god, I’m going to be sick.##
++ Instance: Timeline B-296:
##491792|This one was my timeline. It was insidious at first. People disappeared occasionally and no one noticed. Like they had never been there. It was like that for a while before things started snowballing. Swaths of people, gone. Companies, governments, organizations, ceasing to exist in the blink of an eye. And no one knew. ## 
++ Instance: Timeline F-012:
##609217|Some government found the Tree and decided to use it to control the citizens. Anyone who speaks out gets wiped from existence. Took over the entire timeline. The Foundation got erased along with who knows how many people.##  ##ff004d|thats some orwellian shit right there##  ##609217|No kidding.## ##491792|What the hell? That’s horrible! Can we do something? We can’t just let this happen can we?## We’ll look into it, Valkyrie.
++ Instance: Timeline K-459:
##609217|A cult popped up around the tree and settled around it.  Eventually the cult got really popular, might have used memetics or something, it’s not important. It kept growing until it became the Timelines most popular religion. So, like, almost everyone there knows about the tree so things are pretty chill. No one’s disappeared, and no governments are cracking down, and no doomsday is coming unless you count the whole “cult takeover” thing.## ##491792|Oh no, was anyone hurt?## ##609217|Nah, like I said, it seems pretty chill, despite how quickly the cult spread.  Anomalously quickly, actually, but they don’t seem to be hurting anybody. Dangerous anomalies are still contained and the cult’s all about the spread of knowledge, so the chances of the Ragnarok event happening? Meh. ## What of Nidhogg and its servants? ##609217| Pretty chill too.  The lizards chow down, but the trees grow back.  Works out pretty well, like the circle of life or something. ## ##491792|Sounds nice.## Indeed. ##ff004d|sounds like hippie bullshit if you ask me##
