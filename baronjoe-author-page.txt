[[tab Commentary]]

> **SCP-3551:** I will admit, this SCP largely exists due to the image. I was scrolling about CC images and the image was amusing so I developed an idea surrounding it. The best way was to have it a Wondertainment product which was perfect. The SCP also has a few references in it too. The name "Invaders" is a nod to Invader Zim, which is a title given to scouts of the titular character's species. It also fitted with B-movie sci-fi alien invasion film titles.
> 
> There is a reference to Area 51 with the designation of the storage locker. Also, there is a reference to one of the main alien protagonists of the game series //Destroy All Humans!// whose name is Orthopox but is referred as Poxy for short in-game. One of the -1 instances is called this in the incident log.
> 
> Yeah, it's awesome how they are my first successful skip and I'm proud of my little inflatable dorks.

> **SCP-3938:** This skip was inspired by an image I found while looking for CC images as well, like 3551. The image was of a fictional character from Austria named Tom Turbo, a magical bike capable of doing many things, as a ride. I didn't know the latter (neither the former) but the character's appearance yelled Wondertainment to me at the time. Note that my skip and Tom Turbo are very different in their own regards.
> 
> I thought of it being a vehicle and all, it would be about it taking people to places. Also, I was thinking of Michael Jackson's Speed Demon at the time too, which is some of my favorite songs.
> 
> I am not sure how the narrative came to me but the idea, you know, it being a defective product. I think I wanted to do something with the Marshall, Carter, and Dark format so my mind thought of how they would be in possession of it. I think I was inspired by the explosive aspect of the narrative by a Tom and Jerry cartoon, where there was a white lab mice that would explode if hurt? Not sure but it blowing up sounded like a good reason Wondertainment would recall the thing.
> 
> Anyway, that is pretty much all I have to say about my second SCP. Although, I could say that the previously mentioned CC image of Tom Turbo was going to be in the article. I went against it due to how it was an established character, and those familiar with the show from Austria would recognize it, likely breaking immersion. I was hoping the image was of a unique ride not based on anything but oh well. Besides, it did not fit with the imagery I had in mind of what the Take-You-Anywhere Machine looks like, which I developed during production on the draft.

> **SCP-3783:** Ah, 3783, Baba Yaga's Cottage. It was originally designated 783, but it fell into deletion range. It was replaced by the Crooked Man skip, which is interesting in my opinion. Both can be described as fairy tales or something told to children. Parents would say to their children Baba Yaga would come for them and take them to her cottage to eat them.
> 
> Anyway, 783 had others interested in rewriting it and I was among them. I am passionate about Series 1 articles for it established the site, and we wouldn't be here. It pains me to see some go so I decided to try and save Baba Yaga's Cottage. It was also my first dangerous, monstrous SCP I worked on too.
> 
> The original article lacked any details referencing the iconic feature of Baba Yaga's Cottage, that being its legs and moving around. So I decided to maintain the original anomaly (that being stuff being mutated fro going inside it), and add the iconic features of the Cottage. I fixed and expanded the testing log it had, which was on a separate page and more highly rated than the main article. The testing log is my favorite part, and I enjoyed working on it.
> 
> Other than the goal of preserving the feel of the original, I wanted to establish a narrative with it. Like, how did the Foundation learn of it? Also, I wanted to establish a connection with [[[SCP-352]]], who is Baba Yaga herself. It made sense to do so, and I wrote it 3783 to be a slight sequel to 352's article. Not to mention, there is parallels between the two articles.

[[tab Lego and SCP]]
We all love Lego. I mean, we have an SCP that is Lego. Wouldn't it be cool if there was official Lego sets of SCP? God, that be awesome but sadly the nature of the site's content and license will have it be unlikely to ever happen. At least we can make our own with the many pieces out there which this tab is about. I was inspired by the Lego MOCs posted on the official SCP subreddit from user CephalopodOverlord.

So yeah, this is just advice to make things based on the SCP Foundation out of Lego. Lets begin.

**Class D Personnel:** You can make a Class D minifigure from a few sources. For the orange jumpsuit, you could get one from the Lego Batman Movie set Arkham Asylum. A few minifigures from the set wear one and you can take the torso piece. To have a nod to SCP Secret Laboratory, that multiplayer game, you can find a beanie head piece in Lego Police/City sets. The faces are up to you with whatever piece.

**Researcher/Scientist:** You are able to use a minifigure from the Jurassic World Lego set of the character Dr. Wu for the chest piece. There exist two versions if I recall. From the Lego Batman Movie, you can also use the Dr. Hugo Strange figure for both the chest and leg piece. As a bonus, if you want a researcher dressed in a hazmat suit then you can for Lego has released a minifigure which wears one.

**Technician/Engineer:** This is an easy one and may not be necessary but let's do it. A good torso would be from Emmet, the protagonist of The Lego Movie. There is another version from a similarly designed technician figure. The difference is that it has an ID tag unlike the Emmet figure who has it on his leg piece.

**Guards/MTF:** The torso for these guys can be acquired from the Lego Space Police sets of, well, the space police officers. It resembles a vest so it will do. Although, if you don't wish to be a Lego purest, you could get a vest piece from Brick Arms or Brick Forge, which sell unofficial pieces. Then for the lower area, have a black hip piece with white legs. I think they sell specific parts so it be easy to acquire or you can take one from one you have. Also, if you want an MTF to wear hazmat then you can too for it fits in their line of duty as well. You can also have them wear a helmet with a visor or have their face exposed. If the latter, there are head pieces that have a headset print to use.

**MTF Tau-5 ("Samsara"):** Not sure of their appearance but essentially they are cyborgs. Well, here is how to do each team member.
* **Nanku and Onru:** In the Lego Minifigure series, they released a figure that made me immediately thought of Nanku. The figure is Female Cyborg Girl and it's head piece is so perfect you may use. I would pretty much use the whole figure to depict Nanku but you can do some modifications. Although, the figure can be used to also depict Onru. Since the task force are also described as clones, perhaps a different hair piece could be attached to depict her.
* **Irantu and Munru:** For them, hmm. Perhaps the minifigure of Cyborg of DC Comics can be of use. Admittedly, it can also be used for Nanku and Onru. The arm canon on Cyborg figure is cool and fits with Nanku that once had her arm turn into a blaster thing.

There is many ways to go about Tau-5. You could have their faces obscured by a helmet (perhaps from the Galaxy Trooper minifigure), use some Ultron minifigures (particularly the jar piece and torso), whatever. Overall, the best outcome is to mix both the Female Cyborg Girl and Cyborg from DC Comics (slightly). The color of the Cyborg Girl fits to what I imagine Tau-5. Also, to have another head piece you get one from the Dark Cyborg minifigure.

**GOC Operatives/Strike Teams:** Operatives of the Global Occult Coalition in there special gear mostly to be precise. You can find it mentioned [http://www.scp-wiki.net/goc-supplemental-equipment here]. Now, to depict an operative in a Mk. II Combat Garment (White Suit). There is two figures whose accessories you can use. One, in the Lego Minifigure series there is a space marine with a bulky chest piece and has a cool helmet. It's blue but there is another figure with the same piece that is grey, the Space Miner. The second is the Galaxy Trooper, which was mentioned previously.

The GOC has mech suits, the MK. III Ultra-Heavy Engagement Chassis (Orange Suit). A bulky, walking tank pretty much. I don't have much to help with but I recommend taking notes on other custom Lego mech suits. Here is some YouTube tutorials/videos. You can make modifications to fit what you like from the tutorial videos and, again, take notes on the non tutorial videos or both.

Finally, let's get into SCPs.

**SCP-008 (Zombie Plague):** Lego has released multiple minifigures that are zombies so this isn't hard to acquire.
