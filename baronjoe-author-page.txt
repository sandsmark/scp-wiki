[[tab Lego and SCP]]
We all love Lego. I mean, we have an SCP that is Lego. Wouldn't it be cool if there was official Lego sets of SCP? God, that be awesome but sadly the nature of the site's content and license will have it be unlikely to ever happen. At least we can make our own with the many pieces out there which this tab is about. I was inspired by the Lego MOCs posted on the official SCP subreddit from user CephalopodOverlord.

So yeah, this is just advice to make things based on the SCP Foundation out of Lego. Lets begin.

**Class D Personnel:** You can make a Class D minifigure from a few sources. For the orange jumpsuit, you could get one from the Lego Batman Movie set Arkham Asylum. A few minifigures from the set wear one and you can take the torso piece. To have a nod to SCP Secret Laboratory, that multiplayer game, you can find a beanie head piece in Lego Police/City sets. The faces are up to you with whatever piece.
