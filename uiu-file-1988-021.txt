[[size 120%]] **UIU File 1988-021:** Case File "Hy-Brasil Incident"[[/size]]

**Summary:** An event involving an unknown (now-destroyed) giant creature around 100 meters tall, resembling a half-crocodile half-squid hybrid animal, which came out of the Atlantic Ocean to destroy the city-state island of Hy-Brasil.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation became aware of this event following the cessation of all communications from the FBI Field Office on the island, as well as those from Extranormal Informant Ramone Valtruz who resided on the island. Further investigation by the UIU revealed high activity in the area from nearly-all known anomalous parties, prompting the immediate dispatch of UIU Agent Watkins to further investigate the ongoing situation in Hy-Brasil.

Evidence suggests that the creature, and the ensuing battle to eliminate it, nearly destroyed the island of Hy-Brasil. This creature may have been previously-contained or even created by anomalous parties, namely either the Global Occult Coalition or the Foundation.

[[tab Event/Locale Preface]]

**Locale Discovery:** Several suspects under Indefinite Detention were (on several occasions) overheard conversing about a small island off the coast of Ireland which was in-and-of-itself filled with anomalies and anomalous individuals. In late 1960, the UIU began investigating the claims and discovered the island of Hy-Brasil shortly thereafter. The FBI Division deployed armed agents to the island and was met with open arms by the indigenous people, as well as the government of Hy-Brasil itself.

**Locale Summary (Pre-Event):** The island is home to numerous anomalous life forms, including elves, faeries, and individuals of intense anomalous power. The island's government system is that of a monarchy, led by one "King Nuada Airgetlám VII," who allowed the UIU to begin constructing an FBI Field Office on the island. Under the terms-of-stay for the UIU to continue operating on the island, this Field Office would only be permitted to investigate, detain, and arrest anomalous individuals on the island who were previously-wanted by the FBI for crimes committed against the United States.

[[collapsible show="UIU Agent ██████'s Notes - Secret Clearance Required" hide="Authority Approved: Welcome SPECIAL AGENT"]]
**Forward:** These notes were classified by the UIU Assistant Director in wake of the investigation of Case 1988-021, having previously belonged to the Service Log of Agent ██████, who was stationed at the UIU's Hy-Brasil Field Office between 1961-1964. Only four notes were deemed relevant enough to the investigation to be included here.
> 
> **03/07/1961:** "I've been stationed here for about a month, but today was the first day that I actually took a walk away from my apartment and the office. This place is amazing - nothing like back in Denver, but still beautiful in its own way. The Mick-Points[[footnote]] A UIU slang term for the fey at the time, with 'Mick' denoting their Irish accents and 'Point' denoting their elven ears. [[/footnote]] really know how to spruce up the place, all of the sidewalks clean and the planted trees with purple-and-yellow flowers. The boardwalk they have bordering the ocean is really a sight to behold in the evenings. I won't lie, getting stared at constantly is an annoyance, with me always wearing my work suit while the natives all got casualwear. That said, I had a kid come up to me today asking if I was from 'beyond the water.' When I told him yes, he just said, 'Welcome to our land' and ran away giggling in that Mick accent. I gotta say, it was pretty charming."
> 
> **11/23/1961:** "After exploring most of the island I did find out that the Mick-Points have allowed many others on the island as well - including some of the anomalous parties that we normally have to compete with for Carts and Cans[[footnote]] UIU slang for anomalous artifacts and locations, respectively. [[/footnote]]. Not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing that we're all together on the same neutral ground."
> 
> **12/11/1961:** "Okay, so here's what I've got so far:
> 
> * The Suits have what looks like a full-blown embassy here, surrounded by those baby-blue flags with the globe and star on them. I'd have known more if several of their goons hadn't surrounded me and asked me to leave.
> * The Cart Shoppers have several of their subsidiary stores scattered throughout the business district - selling everything from high-end dresses to overpriced food. Honestly, I may get a dress for my Jobelle while I'm here and send it back home as a Christmas gift, it's just too bad that MC&D don't do government discounts.
> * Some whacked-out toy store belonging to a 'Dr. Wondertainment' apparently sits across the street from an MC&D front, which of course the MC&D employees bad-talk every chance they get. Probably some beef between those two that I don't know-or-care about.
> * I did see at least one bar-and-grille here called 'Chicago Spirits & Pizza,' and the guys inside looked shady-enough to keep me from going in. No idea if that place is actually connected to the bastards that UIU investigated back during Prohibition, could just be a coincidence.
> 
> "I'll let the office know what I found soon. Right now we're bogged-down chasing around a bunch of wanted Can Men[[footnote]] UIU slang for anomalous individuals. [[/footnote]] from all over the US that came here to hide from the law. Guess they never thought Uncle Sam would get here too!"
> 
> **04/19/1964:** "One of the Can Men we arrested a few weeks ago has been raising hell in one of the holding cells. Crazy bastard's already wanted for a bunch of robberies he pulled back in the States - only reason UIU gives a shit is 'cause the bastard can change his skin tone to match other races. Anyway, we've had to smack him around a bunch with the nightsticks to try getting him to stop, but the bastard is just //determined// to piss everyone off, screaming about how the island was doomed. He was arrested in a suburban housing area on the island known for dope, and I swear he's just lost it entirely, but we still gotta send him back on the ferry for Indefinite Detention. Ever since we found him he keeps screaming to anyone who'll listen about how the island was doomed by the King and that there's no hope for this place and yadda yadda yadda, you get the idea. Even if he was right, not like I give a damn. I'm shipping out in 6 months anyway to be rotated back to civilization."
> 
**Closing Statement:** Luckily for the UIU, the server storing these records backed-up all data to the FBI's Records Department on 01/20/1965 (in accordance with the Federal Records Act), allowing more insight into Hy-Brasil fieldwork for this investigation.

[[/collapsible]]

**Locale Summary (Post-Event):** The island of Hy-Brasil is unlikely to ever recover from the events of 06/13/1988, and now has an estimated population of under 700. No further UIU personnel are to be stationed on Hy-Brasil until further notice, and all personnel previously-stationed there are to be considered killed in the line of duty, with their families notified.

[[tab Creature Description/Capabilities]]

**Codename:** "Reptilic Cephalopod"

**Physical Description:** Creature appears to have been a 100 meter tall animal with the top-half of its body resembling that of a crocodile with five equally-distanced arms around its body and the bottom-half of its body resembling that of a five-tentacled squid.

**Capabilities:** The creature was, according to UIU Agent Watkins' investigation, capable of breathing fire from its mouth up to 60 meters in front of itself. This ability is not fully understood at this time. The creature was also (due to its massive size) able to inflict massive damage to the surrounding area, using its five arms and five tentacles to destroy buildings and grab prey for consumption. The creature seems to have maintained a competent-enough intellect to be capable of hunting intelligent prey, including those hidden inside buildings and motor vehicles.

**Purpose/Motive:** Unknown/Survival

**Modus Operandi:** Despite its size the creature was highly mobile, sought-out prey for consumption whilst protecting itself from hostile attack, and responded to extreme stress with its anomalous fire-breathing ability.

**Behavior:** The creature behaved in an enraged state from the time that it was first sighted to its elimination by hostile forces, and was highly-destructive in both its hunting and attack patterns.

[[tab Evidence]]

**A: Two Samples of Creature Muscle/Tissue:** Purchased from an elderly man who claimed to formerly be part of an anomalous Chicago group, possibly the Chicago Spirit. This elderly man was also in possession of several photographs of the creature itself, taken during the creature's initial landfall and subsequent attack, which UIU Agent Watkins was unable to purchase due to lack of funds.

**B: Eighteen Photographs:** One day before the UIU's dispatch of Agent Watkins, he was issued a standard Mamiya ZE 35 SLR 35mm camera to document anything suspicious relating to the case. He produced 18 photographs of various locations where the creature had caused significant damage to persons and property, some photos being temporarily withheld and pending release as they depict graphic images of individuals crushed or ripped apart by the creature.

[[collapsible show="UIU Agent Elliot Watkins Welfare Check - Secret Clearance Required" hide="Authority Approved: Welcome SPECIAL AGENT"]]
**Foreward:** Given the graphic and disturbing photos taken by Agent Watkins during this deployment, he was given a psychological evaluation to check for possible symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress on 11/03/1988:
> 
> **<Begin Log, 1330 Hours>**
> 
> [Agent Watkins enters the room, closing the door behind him and sitting across from Dr. ██████, the UIU's dedicated psychologist.]
> 
> **Agent Watkins:** "Afternoon Doc, I was told you needed to see me."
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** "That's correct, Agent Watkins. May I call you Elliot?"
> 
> **Agent Watkins:** "Sure."
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** "Excellent. Now, you may be aware of the UIU's service policy regarding care for agents who have witnessed... undesirable things in the field."
> 
> **Agent Watkins:** [Laughs.] "So you're worried that I can't serve as good as before? Yeah, the stuff I saw on the island keeps me up some nights, but I'm fine. I saw worse things working for the DEA back in Colombia."
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** "You very well might have, but that doesn't mean //these// wouldn't affect a rational person."
> 
> [Dr. ██████ proceeds to place several of the photos taken by Agent Watkins during his investigation of Hy-Brasil on the desk in front of them. This is followed by a full minute of silence, as Agent Watkins picks up and looks at each of the photos.]
> 
> **Agent Watkins:** "All due respect Doc, you don't know what it's like out there. You wouldn't get it. I //need// to stay in the field."
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** "Why exactly is that, Elliot?"
> 
> **Agent Watkins:** "To keep my mind busy."
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** "Busy from what, exactly?"
> 
> **Agent Watkins:** "Busy from shit like this!"
> 
> [Agent Watkins proceeds to stand up from his chair in anger and pace around the room.]
> 
> **Agent Watkins:** "I... I'm sorry, Doc. It's not you, it's just... "
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** "You don't have to explain yourself to me, Elliot. Sudden bursts of agitation is a common symptom of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder."
> 
> [A 12-second pause commences.]
> 
> **Agent Watkins:** "It's just hard to deal with. I had to see so much... do you know what I had to go through to find that EI? The Informant? No government left to speak of, no emergency plan in place to keep track of people in case of a disaster, so I had to look for him myself. I had to check through refugee camps, triage centers, field hospitals, morgues, and every other crevice of the sick, wounded, and dead just to find one man. I even met this young girl along the way who was... well, she was special, and she helped me look for the guy. We went through building-after-building, checking row-after-row of emergency cots and beds, having to see people covered in burns or missing limbs and hear them cry out for help from anyone who would listen. We kept searching for days on end, I couldn't even sleep because all I could hear were their cries. Finally, she helped me find him. But it didn't even matter, I just took his statement and he fucking died a couple days later."
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** "That certainly sounds traumatic. If it helps, I may be able to prescribe you- "
> 
> **Agent Watkins:** "Have you ever seen a 5-year-old boy with pointed ears and blue eyes covered in third-degree burns?"
> 
> [A 6-second pause commences.]
> 
> **Agent Watkins:** "I can still remember him, it's like I can see it perfectly in my mind. The kid was calm - not crying, just lying there on the cot... probably in shock. The nurses had to keep stopping him from moving because if he tried to sit up, the flaked skin on his back and shoulders would shed and peel off his little body. I could see the boy's muscle, Doc. I could see the raw, red meat of his muscles, some of it even cooked into shades of brown or black by the fire. The whole time he just kept staring at the ceiling like... like he didn't know what had happened." [Agent Watkins pauses.] "How do I forget that?"
> 
> [A 32-second pause commences.]
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** "I think that will be enough for today, Elliot."
> 
> **<End log, 1340 Hours>**
> 
**Closing Statement:** Agent Watkins has since taken a temporary paid-leave-of-absence (approved by the Assistant Director of the Unusual Incidents Unit) for further psychological evaluation and therapy following his deployment to Hy-Brasil. All further therapy transcripts are locked per doctor-patient confidentiality policy.

**C: Six Witness Statements:** During the course of Agent Watkins' investigation, he took multiple statements from American citizens (all anomalous individuals, notably) who had resided in Hy-Brasil and witnessed the attack. The witnesses' stories all corroborated each other's statements enough to conclusively determine them to be telling the truth, and one anomalous individual, in particular, has requested to be inducted into the US government's Witness Protection Program in exchange for her statement. This request should be noted as pending evaluation by the US Marshals Service, with Agent Watkins listing the anomalous individual as a "critical witness to a classified UIU investigation."

[[collapsible show="UIU Agent Elliot Watkins Debrief Excerpt - Top Secret Clearance Required" hide="Authority Approved: Welcome SPECIAL AGENT"]]
**Foreword:** Excerpt from the Debrief of UIU Agent Elliot Watkins on 08/15/1988.
> 
> **<Begin Log, 22 Minutes Into Debrief>**
> 
> **Assistant Director ████:** "I understand your annoyance, but we're almost done here. So, you listed a Can Man as a 'critical witness' to your investigation. Can you explain this in greater detail?"
> 
> **Agent Watkins:** "Sir, this individual has key information regarding the creature's assault on the island. If she was taken in by WITSEC, we could have her legally brought to the United States to give more in-depth statements on this event."
> 
> **Assistant Director ████:** "Give statements to who, exactly? The courts? No one outside of that island is even aware of what happened there, and we already have your statements. What more could she provide that we need?"
> 
> **Agent Watkins:** "Sir, we can protect her."
> 
> **Assistant Director ████:** "From what? The dead monstrosity that attacked the island? What do you think, that it's going to snitch on her from the grave to a monster mafia?"
> 
> **Agent Watkins:** "We can protect her from the hellhole that the island will inevitably turn into! We can protect her from-"
> 
> **Assistant Director ████:** "Watch your tone, son. Don't you forget that //I// am the one in charge here."
> 
> [A brief 4-second pause commences as Agent Watkins collects himself.]
> 
> **Agent Watkins:** "Assistant Director, it is our job to protect American lives when we are able, and we have the opportunity to do so here. This girl is about to be trapped inside an apocalyptic post-disaster on that island, and we have the opportunity- no, //you// have the ability to do something about it. I am pleading that you get her into Witness Protection so that she can be rescued from an inevitably-dark fate if she were to remain on that island."
> 
> **Assistant Director ████:** [Takes a moment to clear his throat.] "Agent, why exactly did you pick this girl for WITSEC? There were other American Can Men in Hy-Brasil, several of whom witnessed the Incident up-close, according to your investigative notes. What is she so significant for?"
> 
> **Agent Watkins:** "Unofficially, sir? She's only 15... and she looks just like my daughter did at that age. She fled America - our nation - to hide from the Skippers and other groups hunting her down. Because we couldn't control what was happening here, she had to run to an anomalous island she had heard about during her time underground and beg them for amnesty. Now, that island has been destroyed and I refuse to abandon an underage American girl in a foreign nation that's decaying before her eyes. She's never committed a crime and yet she's being punished by having everything ripped away... "
> 
> [A 7-second pause commences.]
> 
> **Agent Watkins:** "She deserves to be brought home, sir. She deserves the right to live under the star-spangled banner without fear of imprisonment or execution from the Skippers and Suits, and Witness Protection can keep her identity hidden from both. We both know from what I found that the GOC will kill anomalous witnesses trying to flee the island in order to hide their failures following the Hy-Brasil Incident. I am, as one of the longest agents still serving in the UI-Unit, asking you to grant her that right."
> 
> [A long 35-second pause commences as the Assistant Director can be heard shuffling paperwork.]
> 
> **Assistant Director ████:** "I can't guarantee anything, son. You know that we aren't in charge of WITSEC handling... " [Assistant Director stands up from his chair] "But I'll forward the application to the Marshals. Whether they accept or reject it, I'll let you know."
> 
> **Agent Watkins:** "Thank you, sir." [Agent Watkins shakes the Assistant Director's hand] "That's all I ask."
> 
> **<End Log, Interview Completed After 32 Minutes Elapsed>**
> 
**Closing Statement:** As of 08/31/1988, the above-mentioned request for Witness Protection submitted to the US Marshals Service is still pending review. For further details or to issue an update for this log, contact the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Records Department.

[[tab Bureau Record]]

**Current Status of Investigation:** Creature eliminated by an unknown anomalous party on 06/13/1988. Suspected anomalous parties narrowed down to either the Foundation or the Global Occult Coalition. Creature's corpse has been removed by an as-of-this-time-unconfirmed third party, suspected to be Marshall, Carter, and Dark. Case is considered closed.

**Investigation Conclusion:** Creature has constituted a grave threat to United States coastal cities if there are others like it, which the Acting Director of the FBI has deemed to be of critical importance in this investigation. Hy-Brasil deemed to be a lost cause and of no further use.

**History of UIU Action:**

06/13/1988: Initial contact is made by Extranormal Informant Ramone Valtruz during the initial landfall of the creature.

06/17/1988: The EI and the FBI Field Office on Hy-Brasil both fail to submit their weekly reports to the FBI Records Department. The Assistant Director of the UIU is alerted of a possible situation on Hy-Brasil.

06/18/1988: Assistant Director of the UIU launches an investigation and discovers that the area is experiencing one of the highest levels of presence between known anomalous parties to-date. UIU Agent Watkins activated & deployed to the island of Hy-Brasil, soon confirming the FBI Field Office to be destroyed, making document and body retrieval/recovery impossible. Agent Watkins then focuses on the missing EI.

06/29/1988: The EI is finally located by UIU Agent Watkins at a triage-center-turned-field-hospital and is found to have been gravely wounded with third-degree burns. While the EI is originally responsive and gives a full statement to Agent Watkins regarding the events of 06/13/1988, he succumbs to his injuries on 07/03/1988.

08/08/1988: UIU Agent Watkins informs the UIU's Assistant Director of the completion of his field investigation, and requests egress from the island.

08/15/1988: The EI's body is transferred to the UIU's custody and sent back to the US for burial under an alias name, with Agent Watkins egressing the island alongside. UIU Agent Watkins is debriefed by the Assistant Director of the UIU regarding his investigation. Shortly thereafter, the Assistant Director declares all records and investigations regarding the island nation of Hy-Brasil to be closed immediately, and classifies all records involving such as Secret, with the exception of select records being classified as Top Secret as deemed by the Assistant Director himself.
