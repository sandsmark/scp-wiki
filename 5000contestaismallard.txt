**Special Containment Procedures:** RAISA's Surveillance Division is determining the cause of SCP-5000 (ticket #E4K07U2) and creating technical countermeasures to reduce the severity of a similar event in the future (ticket #30VNI4F). The SCP-5000 Containment Director is assigning technicians to replace all damaged components and investigate suspect auxiliaries.

The Department of Internal Security has opened an investigation. [DATA REDACTED 5/INTSEC]

**Description:** SCP-5000 was an outage of PANOPTICON, lasting for three days from 2019/06/10 16:59 to 2019/06/13 21:06 UTC. During this time, surveillance satellites, Site-07 communications, intelligence processing, and IntSCPFN file sync were inoperable. The full extent and nature of the anomaly are presently unknown.

**Project #:** RAISA-31409

**Authorized By:** Overseer Council

PANOPTICON refers to a number of interconnected technological and paratechnological constructs, which collectively enable global oversight.

The Atreus Satellite Array is a Foundation-launched fleet of modular satellites, with orbits configured to ensure full coverage of the Earth at all times. Each satellite has a surveillance installation (see 4/PANOPTICON/HDW04 for schematics), including X-ray antennas and Kant receivers. They also have several hardpoints for weapons and reality anchor attachments, set at the direction of the Department of Applied Force.

    width=200px
]]

Additionally, the Department of Intelligence's Field Monitoring Division is responsible for the installation and maintenance of over ██ million input devices, including SEP-shielded cameras, microphones, links into existing civilian and government surveillance systems, thaumaturgic particle detectors, and Kant counters.

All gathered surveillance information is processed at Site-07, located in the Norton Bay off the coast of Alaska. Due to its secure location and increasing role in Foundation archival operations, it was established as the headquarters of RAISA in 1961. Two years later, the DEEPWELL backup system entered service there as well.

Records are loaded into an anomalous RDBMS (relational database management system) and indexed accordingly. SKYEYE.aic continuously queries this database to look for correlations or abnormalities which may indicate potential extranormal events, objects, or activity by groups of interest.

On 19██/12/12 a thaumaturgic ritual was performed at the direction of the Overseer Council, resulting in metaphysical anchoring constructs being embedded within areas of the infosphere associated with the Foundation, normalcy, and knowledge.

As information is duplicated throughout all PANOPTICON nodes with at least three parallel processing sites each, an extended outage is extremely improbable. Combined with the anchoring constructs, the calculated probability of an outage is less than 1 in 10^^24^^.

All components of the metaphysical anchoring system were found to be active during SCP-5000.

> [[span class="member3"]]<jtaylor>[[/span]] how are the satellite systems looking? the links have been operable for hours but the system still can't do the handshake
> [[span class="member5"]]<rhill>[[/span]] I'm really not sure. I've been running local experiments and they work fine, but once we plug into the real system it fails
> [[span class="member5"]]<rhill>[[/span]] maybe something wrong with our thaumic keys?

> [[span class="member4"]]<lgonzales>[[/span]] all of them are "latched on" so to speak, but a few aren't "transferring"?
> [[span class="member4"]]<lgonzales>[[/span]] the model is weird, if you know about alpha-lambda loops you know what I'm talking about
> [[span class="member1"]]<jjohnson>[[/span]] what how? there aren't many declassified docs but
> [[span class="member1"]]<jjohnson>[[/span]] that is only possible if the originator decides to decouple iirc

> [[span class="member4"]]<lgonzales>[[/span]] I know, it's bizarre
> [[span class="member5"]]<rhill>[[/span]] maybe a third party tried to take it from us?
> [[span class="member4"]]<lgonzales>[[/span]] nah, it would require way too much energy
> [[span class="member4"]]<lgonzales>[[/span]] though I think looking at swapping out conceptual targets is a possibility. [[span class="member3"]]jtaylor[[/span]] can you get me access to the 5/metabed ritual info?
