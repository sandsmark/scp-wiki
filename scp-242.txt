**Item #:** SCP-242

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-242 is kept at home located in ████████, NM procured by the Foundation on ██/██/████.  The original owner was an out of state landlord who had problems keeping the home rented.  After retiring, he moved into the home, but disappeared after living there for only 3 days.

The home is from the outside unordinary and is inhabited by Dr. ██████ and Dr. ██████████ who pose as a married couple with no children.  The backyard is defined along its perimeter with a cinder block wall approximately 2 m high in accordance with the homes in the general vicinity.  The pool is monitored at all times by a single Level 1 guard (Live human monitoring was added after Incident 242-1).  Under no circumstances is the pool to be used by a swimmer for any longer than 5 minutes at a time.
 
**Description:** SCP-242 is a swimming pool approximately 4.5 m wide by 9 m long with a depth ranging from 1 m deep on both ends to 1.5 m deep in the center and a total volume of approximately 53,000 liters.  It has a dual waterfall feature and stairs on one end for ease of entry and exit.

Any substance when placed into the pool will eventually be transmuted into sterile water which will remain sterile permanently even after being removed from SCP-242 and introduced to a non-sterile environment.  Water taken from SCP-242 and poured into a container of water that had been tinted with red food coloring did not mix, but rather stayed together as a sort of non-miscible bubble of sterile water.  The red dye was not able to penetrate the sterile bubble.  Examination of water so sterilized shows it to be nothing more than pure water.  

The length of time required for the transmutation to complete is dependent on the nature of the substance placed therein.  Ordinary river water sampled from █████████, NM was completely sterilized in 7 minutes.  Stagnant pond water taken from ████, NM was sterilized in 18 minutes.  53,000 liters of coal tar was converted to sterile water over the course of 12 days.

While the pool contains sterile water, there is no apparent action of any of the features of the pool.  Once a non-water substance is placed into the pool, the water jets will come on even if disconnected from any power source.  The pool vacuum, if attached, will also activate and drive around the bottom of the pool even through extremely viscous liquids.  After approximately 15 minutes, the substances will start to be chemically broken down into pure water.  There is no cycling of water into or out of the filtration system.  Pipes leading to the filtration system have been completely removed and shown to be empty and dry while pool contents were being sterilized.

**Addendum:**

> **Incident 242-1:** On ██/██/████, a Class D personnel assigned to sample the water from SCP-242 while the house was vacant decided to go for a swim, being unaware of the nature of SCP-242 and also of the monitoring video camera.  Subject fell asleep on an inflatable vinyl raft that was kept in the shed in the backyard.  After 2 hours, the raft dissolved all at once, and subject was immersed completely into the pool.  Significant frothing of the water began with a deep red color being given off from the subject's location.  Subject attempted to reach the stairs to exit, however before exit was possible, the frothing stopped and the pool went from red to clear in approximately 38 seconds.  The decision was made to institute a live guard at the pool from this point on.


**Note:** The use of SCP-242 for possible disposal of any SCP related materials that are "difficult" to manage is being considered at this time.  Contact Dr. ██████ for details and/or permission for testing.
