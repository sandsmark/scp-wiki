**Item #:** SCP-605

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-605 is impossible to contain with currently available resources; all Foundation efforts are currently directed at regulating its behavior and suppressing public knowledge of its existence.

Foundation tracking teams are permanently stationed outside a 15 km radius safe zone from SCP-605, and are equipped with large unmanned aerial vehicles that can be used in case SCP-605 enters an active state.

**Description:** SCP-605 is an airborne gaseous entity located near [DATA EXPUNGED]. It has been known to move slowly, but does not leave the area bordered by [DATA EXPUNGED], [DATA EXPUNGED], and [DATA EXPUNGED], otherwise known as the "███████ ████████".

SCP-605 is visually similar to a high-altitude cloud formation. Its exact appearance varies drastically, from being nearly invisible during its "dormant" phase, to resembling an enormous storm front while "active". While "active", SCP-605 exhibits behavior similar to that of a living organism and will track ships and aircraft in its territory and attempt to engulf them in its body. The "active" state of SCP-605 also causes anomalous disruptions of the local magnetic field, causing compasses and other navigation systems to malfunction.

When a ship or aircraft is completely engulfed by SCP-605, it is consumed by a method that is currently not understood, leaving no trace. All attempts to study this process to date have failed, as a successful "feeding" will cause SCP-605 to revert to a dormant state (usually for several years and as long as several decades at a time), and during this time no anomalous readings can be detected.

Due to SCP-605's ability and its presumed to link to multiple disappearances of civilian and military assets in the past, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles to "feed" SCP-605 has been approved to reduce the chances of publicly known incidents.

**Addendum 605-01:** Analysis of recorded data regarding SCP-605 have shown a minute, but detectable increase in the calculated mass of SCP-605, with spikes consistent with known dates on which SCP-605 entered an active phase. Request for further study and possible countermeasures have been filed and are awaiting O5 approval.
