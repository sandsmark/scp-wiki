**Item #:** SCP-3522
 
**Object Class:** Euclid
 
**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-3522 is to be kept in a standard Foundation domicile at Site-179 with transparent UV-blocking film applied to its windows. No source of electromagnetic radiation is to be brought within four meters of the containment area. For reference, this includes common objects such as radios and televisions. This domicile is to be on the lowest possible level of Site-179 in order to ensure there are no important structures underneath SCP-3522 at any time.
 
Due to the events outlined in Addendum 3522.1, personnel with the possibility of direct interaction with SCP-3522 are to have training in hand-to-hand combat specialising in environments where vision is significantly impaired, and a gaseous sedative is to be administered to the object (through vents in the containment chamber) before any personnel enter.
 
**Description:** SCP-3522 is a twenty-two year old Singaporean human male (170cm, 65kg) whose skin absorbs all forms of electromagnetic (EM) radiation within a four meter radius of its center of mass. This property is effective through solid matter and other such barriers through which electromagnetic radiation should otherwise be unable to pass, such as the walls of a Faraday cage.
 
Due to its properties, SCP-3522 is blind, as all light in the visible spectrum (as a form of EM radiation) is absorbed before entering its pupils. The absorption of all visible light in SCP-3522's area of effect also leads it to be perceived as a black sphere of four meter radius[[footnote]]Confirmation of SCP-3522's self description of its physical characteristics was obtained via tissue testing and physical examination[[/footnote]]. Standard tissue testing has revealed that SCP-3522's skin does not retain its properties when detached from the object.
 
SCP-3522 experiences sunburn at a significantly faster rate than a non-anomalous human of its surface area, as the effective surface area for the sun's rays to strike down upon is of a four meter radius sphere. Due to this, the windows of its domicile are fitted with UV-blocking film (see Special Containment Procedures). Despite this, pain and damage to SCP-3522 by radiation does not ever exceed second degree burns[[footnote]]Approximately the damage caused by an extremely severe sunburn[[/footnote]], even when lethal doses of ionising radiation are applied to it over a significant period of time.
 
In recent times, SCP-3522 has been shown to spontaneously demagnetise (albeit weakly) magnets within its effective radius, as well as interfere with the normal function of electronics. The intensity of these effects is slowly increasing over time. It is hypothesised that the final outcome of SCP-3522's effect may be total absorption of the electromagnetic force within its radius. Due to the fact that electrons are bound to an atomic nucleus via said force, this is likely to cause immediate dissolution of molecular bonds through ionisation of the constituent atoms, resulting in the disintegration of affected matter.
 
Possible methods of containment when SCP-3522 reaches this final stage are being researched, detailed in Addendum 3522.2. If the object is unable to be contained before it approaches this final stage, it may simply fall through the Earth as it disintegrates the ground underneath it, vaporising swaths of Earth's crust and possibly destroying manmade structures as it does so. This scenario is however projected to only cause minor damage as SCP-3522's skin is likely to be destroyed by heat as it approaches and falls into the mantle of the Earth.
 
A proposal for the use of SCP-3522 as a safety measure in experiments involving large amounts of EM radiation is currently pending review by the Ethics Committee.
 
--SCP-3522 is generally cooperative and maintains a positive mood, though it is recommended that psychological intervention is eventually provided to minimise negative effects of Foundation containment, namely "homesickness" as a result of extended family estrangement and a perceived loss of liberty and purpose.-- As of the events in Addendum 3522.1, SCP-3522 has become extremely hostile, screaming at security cameras placed in its cell and attempting to direct its properties in order to disintegrate walls, objects, and at times research personnel. As SCP-3522 is unable to control its anomalous properties in any way, none of these attempts have been successful. The reason for this sudden increase in hostility is pending psychological evaluation.
 
**Discovery**: SCP-3522, formerly known as O█████  S██ was taken to the ████████ Regional Children's Hospital by its parents at the age of 15 due to dark pigmentation appearing on its skin, with its parents hypothesising that SCP-3522 was developing melanism.[[footnote]]Melanism does not occur in humans. SCP-3522 has no anomalous properties regarding misdiagnosis of disease, this was merely due to lack of relevant education[[/footnote]] Within hours SCP-3522's skin had been fully covered by its absorption field, giving the appearance of completely black skin. By the time three days had elapsed from its admission to the hospital, SCP-3522's absorption field had reached its final size of a 4 meter radius sphere.
 
Foundation medical personnel became aware of the object at around this point in time and alerted the Foundation at large, which then acquired the object. Class-A amnestic agents were used to clear memories of any anomalous observations or events from persons who had experienced them. SCP-3522's parents were informed that its darkening skin was a symptom of an extremely lethal and infectious virus, and as such SCP-3522 had expired and its body disposed of to avoid contagion.

> **Events**
> * At 0800 hours a member of D-class personnel (D-3522-09) enters the object's containment chamber and delivers it a tray of food, as per standard procedure
> * D-class turns his back on SCP-3522 to leave the chamber, SCP-3522 takes advantage of this to swiftly approaches him from behind (putting him into its area of effect and thus blinding him), throwing him to the ground with a judo technique (as reported by D-3522-09)
> * D-3522-09 rises to his feet quickly, object is nevertheless easily able to incapacitate him due to greater experience in vision impaired environments. D-3522-09 does not have time to activate his alarm signal
> 
> * SCP-3522 breaches containment for approximately 25 seconds, running outside its chamber and into the main body of Site-190A
> * Object experiences difficulty navigating at speed outside of the pre-memorised environment of its domicile
> * Object is quickly noticed due to presenting as a four metre sphere and is shortly tranquilised with a standard Foundation tranquiliser gun
 
> **Aftermath**
> * Object returned to its domicile
> * Containment procedures updated
> * Application to fast-track object's appointment with Foundation psychologist is entered
> * D-3522-09 treated for minor bruising and concussion

Note: The following proposed containment methods are purely speculative, simply an exercise in preparedness. On-site resources are insufficient to test these proposals before the object reaches its final stage. In addition, these proposals assume personnel have somehow halted its fall through the Earth, a feat which may be difficult (if not impossible) to accomplish.
 
> __**Proposal 1**__
> **Method of containment:** Continuous pressurised water blast from all directions, suspending the object in the air
> **Comment:** //If there's a limit to the speed of its absorption of electromagnetism (or a delay in the time between entering the area of effect and absorption), this method of containment may be possible. With a sufficient pressure and volume of air, it may be possible to overwhelm SCP-3522's anomalous properties and deliver force before the absorption kicks in.// - Senior Researcher ██████
 
> __**Proposal 2**__
> **Method of containment:** Attempt to teach the object to control its anomalous properties
> **Comment:** //Besides the fact that SCP-3522 has become inexplicably hostile in recent times and wouldn't cooperate with us, there is zero indication it is able to control its anomalous properties. I'm sure you've seen it screaming at the security camera while trying to disintegrate everything in sight, and I'm sure you've noticed it's not working.// - Senior Researcher ██████
 
> __**Proposal 3**__
> **Method of containment:** Suspension in magnetic "force-field", taking advantage of the diamagnetic nature of water
> **Comment:** //Besides the fact that it took a 16 Tesla field just to levitate a tiny frog and as such the power cost for levitating a human would be huge, SCP-3522 absorbs electromagnetism, at least in this end-case scenario. This is the one thing that definitively would not work in any way, shape or form. Please read the object file before submitting proposals.// - Senior Researcher ██████
 
> __**Proposal 4**__
> **Method of containment:** Termination of object via methods such as firearm or starvation
> **Comment:** //SCP-3522 is likely to terminate itself simply if we leave it alone, either by asphyxiation through destruction of its surrounding oxygen, or melting as it falls through the crust of the Earth. Please note that that any proposals should aim to keep the object alive.// - Senior Researcher ██████
 
> __**Proposal 5**__
> **Method of containment:** Pre-emptively remove all skin of object before it reaches the final stage
> **Comment:** //I'm fairly certain this one will work, given that SCP-3522's skin doesn't retain the absorbing properties when detached from it. I'd like to keep this as a last resort though, skinning a live human being is unbelievably barbaric and other options should be exhausted first.// - Senior Researcher ██████
