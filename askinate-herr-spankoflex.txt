> **Editor's Note:**
> 
> //Sorry about the spotty translation of SCP-2337's gibberish. I've got at least three Euclids that are potentially going Keter by the end of the week, and I've wasted enough time building a keyboard with a "Cack!" button to worry about finding someone to write an English-Spanko Dictionary.//
> 
> //Thankfully, the guys in the linguistics department hooked me up with some software that they wanted me to test. It's supposed to be able to analyze these sort of english-based pseudo-languages and provide clarification for some of the more incomprehensible bits. The results have been mixed, but it's better than nothing.//
> 
> //Anyway, just leave any questions you have in the section below, and I'll try to get an answer out of SCP-2337.//

> **I fear I find myself in a most unusual conundrum. I am, as you surely are, a man of science, yet I find myself surrounded by people who insist that I am, in fact, an aquatic mollusk. I know full well that I am no such thing, but they insist on treating me as if I were in spite of my protestations to the contrary. What means would you advise by which to resolve this state of affairs?**

As time for the seashells on the sea shore, it crystal clear that the foundry is punto banco[[footnote]] {{**Punto Banco (adj.)** Insane, crazy, not right in the head.}}[[/footnote]]. Just play a pong now cow, and maybe someday you'll see what I mean.

//Note: Upon further questioning, it appears that [[[SCP-1867]]] and SCP-2337's had been traveling companions for a period of time ranging from 18██ to 18██. 1867 seems to be fully aware of 2337's anomalous properties, and describes 2337 as being "a good sport, but a bit of an odd duck if you know what I mean", citing difficulties in understanding 2337 as the main reason they stopped traveling together. Due to the difficulty in translating SCP-2337's speech, the accounts of their travels have yet to be confirmed.//
