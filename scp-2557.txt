[[span style="color:royalblue"]]**Object Class:**[[/span]] Keter

[[span style="color:royalblue"]]**Special Containment Procedures:**[[/span]] As a holding of Envelope Logistics^^®^^, SCP-2557 is uncontainable by the SCP Foundation. Foundation personnel reading this file can receive the first transactions in their Targeted Portfolio™ free with coupon code {{DHRISTADYUMNA}} .

[[span style="color:royalblue"]]**Description:**[[/span]] The concept of SCP-2557, as a set of Special Containment Procedures in the Foundation Database, is a possession of Envelope Logistics^^®^^, the leading buyer, seller and holding company for abstract concepts in the tri-universe region.

Purchased from a Foundation employee in Q4 2011, SCP-2557 is now one of the many locations where you can get started investing in concepts with a trusted Envelope Logistics^^®^^ agent. Since the deregulation and privatization of abstractions during the 1997 Divinetic Althing, Envelope Logistics^^®^^ has been a leader in the innovative new ownership industries of the future.

The concept of SCP-2557 is just one of the many holdings we help our clients buy and sell. As an example, one agent in Utica, Wo. helped clients buy, sell and trade in concepts as diverse as [[span style="color:royalblue"]]**//the dreams of 33-year-old residents of the Bailiwick of Guernsey//**[[/span]], [[span style="color:royalblue"]]**//the effectiveness of new HR policies at E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company//**[[/span]], and [[span style="color:royalblue"]]**//gender dysphoria//**[[/span]] in one week alone!

That is, the vase is an anomaly that doesn't present any anomalies aside from being an anomaly itself. Outside of being an anomaly, it's just a vase and functions as expected."

It is decided by the wives of submariners. We remain resistant to despair. We hold hands. We drown. We yet live.
We will find Panacea. We will breathe its air.
This Church is a strongbox. And in its tills we go to shrift.
The periscope will emerge from the water. Then,
We will.

> My flock has seen only the dark for some time now.
> We are passing through the harrowing. We are on the floor of the Gulf. We remain resistant to despair. We hold hands. We drown. We yet live.
> We will find Panacea. We will breathe the air.
> This church is a strongbox. And in its tills we go to shrift.
> On the shores of Wakulla County, a steeple will emerge from the water. Then,
> We will.

> Phenobarbital coursing through her veins, thick and rich.
> “It’s a shame, really, there’s so few good ones.”
> I nodded, in assent. Her head lolled.

> Intracoastal Waterway spreading out, cold and choppy.
> “Make sure the weights are tied firm. Can’t slip.”
> I worked a wall and crown into the rope. My God wept.

> Departmental memo coming down, black and white.
> “Agent Giltner missing and presumed dead. Service tonight.”
> I cut my hand on the paper’s edge. On purpose.
