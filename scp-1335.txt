**Item #:** SCP-1335

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1335 is to be contained in a Standard Safe-Class Containment Unit at Site-██. The containment unit is to be fitted with a drainage system and the collected liquid is to be disposed of as Level 1 Anomalous Waste. 

As of ██/12/██, SCP-1335 is to be monitored for noise emissions. Following any audio event, SCP-1335 is to be checked for additional notes.

**Description:** SCP-1335 is a fortune cookie, identical in appearance to a standard fortune cookie manufactured by Wonton Foods Inc. However, it displays the anomalous effect of releasing a continuous stream of liquid. SCP-1335 releases approximately 100 mL of liquid every hour. 

The liquid expelled from SCP-1335 is composed primarily of water, but contains traces of lead and calcium as well as an unidentified organic compound. Despite extensive testing, the liquid produced by SCP-1335 contains no additional anomalous properties.

SCP-1335 was contained on ██/01/██ at the ████████ restaurant after it had been advertised as a "genuine Buddhist artifact". Upon arrival, Foundation agents discovered SCP-1335 being displayed in a fountain, with employees encouraging customers to "anoint themselves with the blessings of Confucius". The owner of the restaurant, ████ Smith, and all employees and customers present at the time were administered Class C amnestics, and a standard disinformation campaign was put into place.

SCP-1335 contains a strip of paper within its shell. Efforts to remove this object without damaging SCP-1335 are ongoing. 

**Addendum-1335-1:** On ██/03/██, the note within SCP-1335 was successfully removed. Upon examination, it was discovered to contain the following message:

>
> hey neighbor
>
> please fix your leak
>
> the dripping is driving me crazy
>

**Addendum-1335-2:** On ██/11/██, the barking of a //Canis familiaris// began to be heard from SCP-1335. The barking continued for the next two hours. The next day, the following message was discovered and retrieved from within SCP-1335.

>
> hey
>
> would you mind quieting your dog
>
> and fix that leak while your at it
>

**Addendum-1335-3:** On ██/17/██, the liquid output of SCP-1335 increased to 400 mL/hour. On ██/19/██, the following note was retrieved:

>
> dude
> stop ignoring me
> i know you can see these
>

**Addendum-1335-4:** On ██/23/██, disco music began emanating from SCP-1335 at 100 dB and continued for four hours. Immediately after the event, researchers retrieved the following note:

>
> THATS IT
> IM CALLING THE FUCKING LANDLORD
>

**Addendum-1335-5:** As of ██/29/██, SCP-1335 has ceased anomalous activity. Reclassification to Neutralized pending.
