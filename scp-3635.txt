**Item #:** SCP-3635

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3635 is to be contained in Security Locker #48 in Site-19's East Wing. Personnel are forbidden from viewing the contents of SCP-3635; if viewed, Class-A amnestics are to be administered. Testing with SCP-3635 must be approved by at least one Level 3 researcher.

Any personnel assigned to SCP-3635 who experience inconsistent memories compared to others and/or documentation are to notify the Site Director immediately. Should additional memories include documents or letters, personnel are to make every attempt to replicate them.

UPDATE - 9/25/199█: All transcripts of recalls reported by SCP-3635-A are to be sent to the Historical Research Division for cross-examination with existing historical evidence.

**Description:** SCP-3635 is an entirely blank photograph measuring roughly 9.5 cm by 13 cm in size. Testing of SCP-3635 suggests it is a Cabinet Card[[footnote]]A common photography method used in the late 19th century.[[/footnote]]. Reproductions of SCP-3635 through scanning or photography do not carry its anomalous effect.

When exposed to SCP-3635 directly, the subject (designated SCP-3635-A) will begin to recall one or more events. A large proportion of subjects report a form of traumatic event, which in majority of cases leads to depression or anxiety. Class-B amnestics appear effective at counteracting these effects. Non-Fatal Type-I Memetic Hazards are known to be present in certain events, necessitating basic cautionary procedures.

Most SCP-3635-generated memories share several fundamental characteristics, including interactions between anomalous entities (which, as of 9/25/199█, have included animals, plants, and inanimate objects) and a "green-suited" task force with unknown affiliations. The subject takes the role of an observer, and not as a member of this task force (with the exception of [REDACTED - LEVEL 4 CLEARANCE REQUIRED]).

> **__Interview Extract #:__** D-3635-3
> 
> **D-3635-3:** So, I remember the smell of horses, hay, the like. I think I was working near the barn that day.
> 
> **Interviewer:** According to our documents, you've lived in an urban environment your entire life.
> 
> **D-3635-3:** Not me, you twat, the other me. //That// me lived off the farm since we were born. I don't think I ever gone more than a few miles from it. And yet all I can remember is that specific day. As... As I said, I was working by the barn, loading up some bales, and my wife was coming up to help me.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Can you describe her?
> 
> **D-3635-3:** Beauty, really. Gorgeous brown hair, smooth skin, green eyes... I always loved that about her. Not that I loved her for them, I just thought that they were a signal of something special about her- the way she could take your arm and lead you to the ends of the earth, it was magnificent...
> 
> **Interviewer:** Did anything else happen?
> 
> //D-3635-3 pauses//
> 
> **D-3635-3:** That day, we were feeding the barn animals. I was about to finish up, when from across the barn, I heard her screaming. I ran over, and... her eyes were just gone. Nowhere to be seen. And... she just kept babbling incoherent nonsense...
> 
> //D-3635-3 sighs//
> 
> **Interviewer:** D-3635-3?
> 
> **D-3635-3:** Can... Can we stop the interview?

> **__Interview Extract #:__** D-3635-7
> 
> **Interviewer:** Tell me more about Frank.
> 
> **D-3635-7:** Frank's always been a hothead. You could never get that guy to be happy, always mad at something or someone. Just an old, grumpy man. Anyways, I hear him screaming his god damn head off about some minor offense that I've committed against him, and his family, and his church or something.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Did you do anything to make him upset?
> 
> **D-3635-7:** Not that I can remember. As always. But, anyways, I step out on to my porch to tell him to cool his head off in the well, and that's when I notice that Frank was hell-of-a-lot different. One arm... well, it looked like a giant's arm that was plastered on to Frank's side. All pink and fleshy and...
> 
> //D-3635-7 shutters//
> 
> **D-3635-7:** I think it was growing as I watched it.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Did anything else interesting happen?
> 
> **D-3635-7:** Funny enough, something did. This group of soldiers jumped out of nowhere. Green uniforms, nothing I've ever seen before. They pushed me down as I saw them go after Frank with their bayonets. Man, he was roarin' and bleeding some strange black goo... Horrible.
> 

> **__Interview Extract #:__** D-3635-9
> 
> **D-3635-9:** I first remember writing, a letter, yeah. It was late at night, and really hot. I was using these old-fashioned looking gas lamps and getting really tired.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Did you observe anything abnormal?
> 
> **D-3635-9:** I suppose you could say that. Freaked me the hell out. I got this feeling I was being watched and there was this man... thing... standing in the doorway between my bedroom and the kitchen. Not moving, it looked like a man, but I think it was built out of porcelain. It had a painted and smiling face and these really ragged loose trousers. You know, I don't think it was actually standing up, supported by its legs I mean, it looked like it was hanging from the neck by some invisible rope.
> 
> **Interviewer:** What happened next?
> 
> **D-3635-9:** It spoke, without moving it's mouth. I think it said something along the lines of "Sorry for the intrusion, but do you mind if you could spare a cup of tea?". Really creepy, it sounded like a old man with a smoking habit.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Did anything else happen?
> 
> **D-3635-9:** We must have stared at each other for a few seconds to a few minutes, I can't tell. And then, it broke, as one of its arms suddenly twisted around and shattered into oblivion. All I remember after that was backing into the corner, as these men in green uniforms invaded my home.
> 
> **Interviewer:** And that was all you recall?
> 
> **D-3635-9:** That was- oh, wait, there was one more thing. One of the weapons the man held looked like nothing I've seen before. It was kinda gun, shaped, but it glowed and had these odd rings around the barrel.

> **__Interview Extract #:__** D-3635-11
> 
> **D-3635-11:** There was always a bit of magic about the place, you know?
> 
> **Interviewer:** The library?
> 
> **D-3635-11:** Yeah. You didn't need to be working there as long as I did, you could just //feel// it in the air the moment you walked in. The place was just filled with history, quite literally. I could place my hand on the wooden walls and feel otherworldly //energy// flow through it.
> 
> **D-3635-11:** It didn't take me long to realize I wasn't the only person who spent their time reading books there. Sometimes, if I was really lucky, I could see the words on the pages rearrange before my very eyes. Ink flowed to form new phrases and alter the story ever so slightly. I saw a person like me, a reader, experience the story for himself as a character in the book. I saw him cheer on the hero fighting the dragon, engage in discussion with famous detectives, and act as a witness in dramatic court cases.
> 
> **D-3635-11:** But he left one day, and I couldn't find him again. And then...
> 
> //D-3635-11 pauses, glaring at the floor//
> 
> **Interviewer:* ...And then?
> 
> **D-3635-11:** They burned it. The men you told me about. I was dragged out of my home as they set fire to the place. Everything burned... almost everything.

> **__Interview Extract #:__** D-3635-12
> 
> **Interviewer:** Good evening, D-
> 
> **D-3635-12:** Fuck, those... God damn it!
> 
> **Interviewer:** D-3635-12, please remain calm.
> 
> **D-3635-12:** No, just... It's Jebodiah- I mean, ██████, not D-whatever!
> 
> **Interviewer:** According to the terms of your contract-
> 
> **D-3635-12:** Yes, I know, I know, sorry. I'm just a bit... //overwhelmed//, right now.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Can you provide an account of the event you recall?
> 
> //D-3635-12 laughs weakly//
> 
> **D-3635-12:** Event? Man, I've got a whole lifetime to remember now.
> 
> //D-3635-12 pauses and becomes more sedate//
> 
> **D-3635-12:** I'm... pretty sure I was living in the past, or some form of it. There were no cars, no paved streets, no electricity. Life was... life was calm. I was happy. I owned a lot of land, kinda a big shot in the area, you get what I mean? Large family, grandchildren were on the way.
> 
> **D-3635-12:** We lived kind of in an oasis in a desert. We owed this fortune due to a gift from god, a statue of an angel. Some ancestor of mine, I dunno who, had put it on top of the hill overlooking the wheat fields. As long as we lead good, Christian lives, the gift would bless us with rain no matter the season. Our crops were in high demand for miles around.
> 
> **D-3635-12:** And then... those fucks showed up. Pointing strange guns at our faces, yelling at us, pointing at the hill. I don't think they were from around, I couldn't understand a word they said. Of course, their purpose was obvious. They wanted our statue.
> 
> **D-3635-12:** We were brought up to the site, and then they broke out these sticks. The angel watched over us, expression unchanging, as they started swinging at its base. Chunks of stone broke off and they kept on swinging, like they were felling a tree. My daughter... oh God, my daughter...
> 
> //D-3635-12 pauses and weeps quietly//
> 
> **D-3635-12:** She... She tried to stop them. Grabbed one of their legs and pleaded. The sticks were brought down, and... sh-she stopped moving. And God, the angel just watched silently. The same expression it's always had, as my daughter... as my daughter was taken from me forever.
> 
> //D-3635-12 begins crying, and is unresponsive for the rest of the interview//

On 25th September 199█, during routine testing with SCP-3635, D-3635-18 reported a memory which was inconsistent with previously documented experiences. The subject reported sitting at a writing desk in a concrete room and writing a letter. When asked, the subject was able to perfectly recall the contents of the letter. The letter is replicated in full below.

> 
> To whoever is reading this: Remember. Please.
> 
> Happenings. Events. Unexplained occurrences. We were among the first to notice that things were not as they seemed. Objects behaving, not as they should, but as they wanted. And, of course, there was instantly a race to grab as many of them as possible.
> 
> Atypicals, we called them. We were always out in front. We’d monitor potential atypicals for days, weeks, even months, and then we’d make our move. Before long, we had seized enough of these atypical artifacts to equip a small army. So that’s what we did.
> 
> Up until then, whenever we found an atypical creature – be it man, animal, or plant – we’d leave it alone. However, someone thought it would be a good idea to start searching for them, and kill them before they could kill us. I was always against the decision to begin hunting. Never mind that almost all had not been at all aggressive, never mind that: they were different, so we needed to exterminate them.
> 
> More to the point, we needed something that would make people forget. Something we could carry around when we went out, hunting the atypicals, to erase any memory that anything was wrong. We had to be incredibly stealthy before, but with this, we could be as obvious as we wanted, and nobody would be able to remember a thing.
> 
> I was given that job, because I was the top scientist. I struggled with it for weeks, trying to make something that would erase any memories that we wanted to erase. But my research was futile. There was simply no way I could do it. Except...
> 
> Except, one day, I walked in to my office, and it was on my desk. The photograph. Still a relatively new technology, it seemed to have been created by the Lippmann process on a flexible plastic back. I knew instinctively not to look at it. Something told me that I would not enjoy the consequences.
> 
> Looking back over my memories, I pieced together what had happened. I had created the photograph – exactly how, I did not know, and still to this day it remains a mystery – and it would erase the previous week’s memories from whoever looked closely at it. Preliminary testing showed that subjects exposed to the photograph would deny being unable to remember what had happened over the time they had forgotten, and gave accounts inconsistent with people who did possess memories of the time.
> 
> It wasn’t perfect, but it was a damn sight better than nothing.
> 
> So, we used it. Whatever I’d done to it made it indestructible I could not replicate, but the Dianas could do whatever they liked and it would stay just as potent as the day I’d found it. The photograph was in use for the next three or so years, over which time it became an accepted weapon, along with all the other atypical artifacts we’d created. Again, I always maintained that it was a staggeringly stupid idea to use atypicals to fight atypicals, but my concerns were drowned out by their high effectiveness. Over those three years, we wiped over five hundred memories off the face of this Earth.
> 
> And that’s when things began to go wrong.
> 
> My suspicions were aroused when Jameson, that son of a bitch, woke up one day. He was… different. He said he’d done things he hadn’t, been places he hadn’t, seen things he hadn’t. Everyone attributed it to shock – after all, he had been on quite a traumatic retrieval mission the day before – but I didn’t think so. I tried to tell people, but nobody listened; I was the nerdy scientist, nobody took me seriously.
> 
> I realized he’d wiped himself with the god damn photograph.
> 
> Seeing as he had been carrying the photo for his squad, I assumed he'd use it on himself if he'd seen "things" that he wanted to unsee. Didn't seem like that much of a big deal, at first, besides the... //over-effectiveness// of the memory-wipe. But then, the same thing happened to Quester, Ducat, Price, and some other members. And there was no way on Earth that any of them could have seen the photo. Something was terribly, terribly wrong.
> 
> Throwing myself back into the work, I knew I only had hours, maybe days if I was lucky, to work out what was going on. But it took me minutes. The amnesia was spreading like a virus, jumping from person to person, erasing their memories. How it spread, I did not know. But what I set out to do was reverse that effect.
> 
> After the first day, I was ready to give up. I was constantly fighting a losing battle against my own amnesia-filled mind. There was no way I could possibly do it.
> 
> Knowing this made no difference. I carried on regardless, using logic as opposed to science. I was sure that I knew already what to do.
> 
> Eventually, I did it. I found the answer.
> 
> How, you may ask?
> 
> The Negative.
> 
> The process by which I had developed the photograph seemed to have been the same as one would create a normal photograph, and this meant that there would likely be a negative version of the photograph out there. Assuming the atypical properties of the photograph were transmitted via chemicals, and not magic or anything silly like that, then the negative would possess the inverse properties of the photograph. All I had to do was to find it - I had probably thrown it away once I'd made the photograph I //wanted//.
> 
> Finally, after hours of frantic searching, I found it. Thank the Lord it had survived the incinerator. I shoved it in the faces of everyone who’d forgotten and their memories were restored. A close shave, for everyone involved.
> 
> But there was a catch.
> 
> The negative didn't just give you back //your// memories. It gave you back random memories as well. Memories had by other people. Memories of things vanishing before your eyes, memories of hideous beasts goring entire battalions of men armed with cannons that shot fire and brimstone, memories of watching yourself bleed to death while your family fought against our green-suited Dianas.
> 
> The organization went from a group of amnesiacs to a collection of terrified amnesiacs. Nobody could remember who anyone was. Sure, it was only a weeks' memories, two at the most, but have you ever tried to suppress a thought you know you don't want to dwell on? It's a lot harder than it sounds. And this was worse. Far worse. The negative's memories were burned into your mind; no matter how hard you tried, you couldn't forget. I should know. By the end, once everyone had either committed suicide to scour themselves clean, or fled our organization to live a normal life, there were only thirteen of us left.
> 
> We were done. We knew we were done.
> 
> Now, twelve of the thirteen are dead, whether from suicide, age, or disease. I'm the only one left alive. And I want to forget.
> 
> You're going to remember this. You might remember more; you might not. But, no matter who you are, you need to pass this information on. To whoever is standing in the shadows: move out of the light.
> 
> So I ask you, please. For all our sakes, remember.
> 
> Don’t fight fire with fire.
> 
> Or the whole world will burn.
