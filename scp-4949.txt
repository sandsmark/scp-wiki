**Item #:** SCP-4949

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4949 is contained within a standard secure storage locker in Site-42.  Requested testing procedures may be submitted to the project supervisor for approval.

**Description:** SCP-4949 is a children's toy doctor kit, including a white lab coat, and plastic tools such as a reflex hammer, surgical forceps, and stethoscope.  See Addendum-4949-CL for the complete list.  The plastic doctor's bag from which all components of the anomaly were recovered bears the branding tag "Dr. Wondertainment and dado Present: dr playtime kit for the kiddos" (sic).

When a child under the age of 10 wears the lab coat and utilizes any of the component pieces of SCP-4949 with the desired outcome of performing a related medical test or procedure on a living human, the attempt will be successful.  This success ranges from being able to record accurate data regarding the subject's vital functions, to performing a coronary bypass surgery.  Notably, no components outside of SCP-4949 are needed to perform any steps of these tasks.

The following document is included in SCP-4949's packaging.

> **ATTENDING PHYSICIAN AND SURGEON:** Dr. Lucas Whitehall attending, Joshua Whitehall, age 7, operating.
> **PROCEDURE:** Surgeon instructed to set the broken bone.
> **TEST RESULTS:** Surgeon utilized the plastic bonesaw to cut through the skin of D-1839's left leg, exposing the bone.  During this process, surgeon utilized one plastic syringe to administer a shot to D-1839's left thigh.[[footnote]] Paralytic effect noted immediately following injection. Surgeon remarked that this was 'So [D-1839] will stop squirming.'[[/footnote]]
> 
> Surgeon utilized plastic Metzenbaum scissors to cut away excess flesh surrounding the visible bone break.  Surgeon then used their hands to set the bone.  Surgeon commented on difficulty of handling the bone due to slickness, but completed the procedure after 6 minutes.  
> 
> Attending physician directed surgeon to close D-1839's wounds.  Surgeon subsequently utilized plastic suture needle to sew surgery wounds shut.
> **NOTES:** Post surgical x-rays reveal that not only were the tibia and fibula transposed in position, they appear to have been fused into a single, contiguous bone at two separate contact points.  D-1839 reports no loss of mobility or balance, though has commented that their leg 'creaks' more than it used to.
> 
> When debriefed, Joshua described the procedure as 'fun', indicating that he enjoyed the 'game'.  Notably, at no point was D-1839's discomfort during the procedure acknowledged by Joshua.

> 
> Surgeon subsequently inserted 1 curette into patient's left nostril, inserting the tool 15cm into the nasal cavity before withdrawing the tool, which was trailing a 5cm mass of tumor cells.
>

> 
> **Dr. Whitehall:**  Well, just try to make his muscles a bit bigger all over his body.  One and a half times their normal mass will be... well, it will be noticeably bigger.
> 
> **Joshua Whitehall:**  Alright then, I guess this one's next.  The next shot will combine with it, uh, and that will start a... what's it called, da -- Dr. Whitehall?  We talked about it the other day.
> 
> **Dr. Whitehall:**  A chain reaction.  It will start a chain reaction, go on.
> 
> **Joshua Whitehall:**  Right, the next shot will start a chain reaction with this one.  [D-3824's heavy, ragged breathing becomes audible.]  I'm getting bored of this game, why do I have to keep playing it with them?

----
||||~ OFFICIAL ETHICS COMMITTEE MEMORANDUM ||
||~ From: || Dr. Kiyoshi Inada, Site-42 Psychologist, Ethics Committee Liaison ||
||~ To: || Dr Lucas Whitehall ||
||~ Re: || Joshua ||
|||| Dear Dr. Whitehall, _
  _
  The investigation into your unauthorized addition of Joshua to the list of test subjects for SCP-4949, and subsequent manipulation of the subject list, has been concluded.  I shouldn't need to tell you, Doctor, that your actions during the tests didn't do you any favors, either. _
  _
  However, seeing as the request to have Joshua removed from the project and returned to his mother's custody also came from you, we are inclined to show lenience.  You will be censured for a period of six months.  Your expertise in directing tests of SCP-4949 have been determined to be of significant value, and as such you will not be separated from the project. _
  _
  Further testing will occur with properly selected test subjects.  Further abuses of power will //not// be tolerated, Doctor. _
  _
  Regards, _
  _
  Dr. Kiyoshi Inada ||
