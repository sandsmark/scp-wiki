> 
> **CONTENTS:** Cup of lukewarm coffee
> **TIME INPUT:** 60 seconds
> **POWER LEVEL:** 1
> **TEST RESULTS:** Agent attempted to reheat his coffee. Microwave activated and ran for 1 minute; coffee was still cool upon removal.
> 
> **CONTENTS:** Cup of lukewarm coffee
> **TIME INPUT:** 60 seconds
> **POWER LEVEL:** 4
> **TEST RESULTS:** Agent increased power level, assuming the first setting was too weak. Microwave activated and ran for 1 minute. Upon opening the door, agent discovered his coffee had grown a thick layer of mold and scum, consistent with the amount that would be expected from leaving a cup of coffee out for 5 months. At this point, the agent brought the microwave to the attention of the Foundation.

> **CONTENTS:** Stopwatch
> **TIME INPUT:** 30 seconds
> **POWER LEVEL:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
> **TEST RESULTS:** Series of tests conducted to determine effects of various power levels on time fluctuation. Resulting time on stopwatch was :30, 15:00, 7:30:00, and 99:99:99. There was no result for the last test, as the battery had died. Subsequent test using a more powerful stopwatch with a larger display resulted in 9 days 9 hours and 281 days 6 hours for the last two settings.
> 
> **CONTENTS:** Rattus Norvegicus (common lab rat)
> **TIME INPUT:** 60
> **POWER LEVEL:** 4
> **TEST RESULTS:** Testing had expected the subject to age five months. Upon starting the timer, subject became a blur, barely visible in its rapid movement around the container. At :03, subject ceased all movement. At :05, subject began rotting rapidly. Testing was halted at :10, and SCP-119 is cleaned of excrement and remains of subject. Cause of death was determined to be dehydration.
> 
> **CONTENTS:** Rattus Norvegicus (common lab rat), small cage with lining, external automatic food/water dispenser filled with 5 months of food/water attached to tubes routed through air vent.
> **TIME INPUT:** 60
> **POWER LEVEL:** 4
> **TEST RESULTS:** Upon starting the timer, subject became a blur, rapidly moving throughout its cage. Both the food and water supplies drained from their containers rapidly. At 60 seconds, subject was found to be dirty due to its uncleaned cage, but otherwise fine. SCP-119 cleaned. Autopsy revealed subject to be in poor health due to its living conditions in the uncleaned cage, but with no abnormalities.
> 
> **CONTENTS:** 1L of water in a shallow glass bowl. Temperature in room containing SCP-119 lowered to 1°C.
> **TIME INPUT:** 600
> **POWER LEVEL:** 5
> **TEST RESULTS:** Time inside SCP-119 intended to be approximately 24.7 years, with an initial input of 60 seconds. Test intended to determine the difference of atmosphere and heat transfer between the inside and outside of SCP-119, as demonstrated by the evaporation of water at near-freezing temperatures. The research assistant entering the time added an extra zero, which would bring the total time up to 2,465,753 years, or over four thousand years a second. Upon pressing START, an immense amount of air began to cycle through the vent. The assistant immediately recognized his mistake and opened the door to stop the timer, at which point a wave of bluish spores emitted from SCP-119 and onto the assistant. The assistant began to choke and quickly asphyxiated. Subsequent testing on atmospheric conditions revealed low oxygen and high carbon dioxide levels, as well as elevated levels of sulfur. The spores were found to be an unknown Xerophillic species of mold. Within SCP-119 was a dense ecosystem of molds and Tardigrades (water bears), along with numerous other unknown species, some of which do not neatly fit within existing categories. The entire ecosystem has created a balanced atmosphere, and seems to have stemmed from the original contents of the water, air, and the assistant.

> **CONTENTS:** None. Door is removed from microwave for duration of this experiment. SCP-119 placed in the middle of a large Faraday cage room with freshly painted floor, using paint that changes color as it dries.
> **TIME INPUT:** 30
> **POWER LEVEL:** 3
> **TEST RESULTS:** SCP-119 remotely activated, and all testing observed remotely. Resultant paint pattern demonstrated the falloff of radiation from the microwave. The paint closest to the front of the door demonstrating 8 hours of drying, and the furthest section of the floor behind the microwave demonstrated closer to 2 hours of drying.
> 
> **CONTENTS:** None. Door is removed from microwave for duration of this experiment. SCP-119 is placed in the middle of a large Faraday cage room with dried paint. Lightweight floating debris and dust is released into the room through a vent.
> **TIME INPUT:** 30
> **POWER LEVEL:** 3
> **TEST RESULTS:** SCP-119 is remotely activated, and all testing observed remotely. A pattern of complex air currents reflecting the pattern left by the paint emerges as individual particles float between stronger and weaker radiation. The radiation did not actually apply any force to the particles, but rather affected their momentum in relation to each other, eventually evolving into a detectable air current pattern.
> 
> **CONTENTS:** [[[SCP-442]]]
> **TIME INPUT:** 90
> **POWER LEVEL:** 5
> **TEST RESULTS:** SCP-442 continued to keep the correct time during the entire duration, showing 1 minute and 30 seconds of time passing over the course of the experiment.
> 
> **CONTENTS:** [[[SCP-289]]]
> **TIME INPUT:** 90
> **POWER LEVEL:** 5
> **TEST RESULTS:** None. Permission to carry out experiment denied.
> 
> //Not funny. Do we really need to explain why that is a bad idea? You already know exactly what that would do.// -O5-█
> 
> **CONTENTS:** Bottle of Macallan 12-year Scotch
> **TIME INPUT:** 60
> **POWER LEVEL:** 5
> **TEST RESULTS:** During previous tests, researchers had been joking that they should "nuke" themselves a drink, and one researcher retrieved a bottle of Macallan from his quarters. The 12-year vintage is relatively inexpensive to obtain, but the 25- and 30-year vintages are considered by some to be the best of all scotch commercially available. Upon completion of test, bottle was effectively a 37-year vintage. Intention of test had been to consume during subsequent tests, but at this point the intent had been heard by a superior, who allowed the researchers to keep the bottle as long as they waited until off duty to consume it.

> //Subsequent testing determined that the results of this experiment were delicious.// - Dr. Grant
> 
> //It would seem Dr. Grant is a rather poor whiskey connoisseur, as whiskey does not age outside of the barrel. Your delicious experiment resulted in a 37-year old bottle of 12-year aged scotch. Well done.// - Dr. Derel
> 
> //I stand by my initial assessment. Delicious.// - Dr. Grant
