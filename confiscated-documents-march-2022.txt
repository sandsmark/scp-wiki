**Text:** //I hate your policies BUT this place is cleaner than any hospital or prison I've seen and that's my only frame of reference for whatever this type of place is, so... thanks for that part I guess. -Nicky//

**Staff Note(s) (If Applicable):** Sanitation standards ought to be typical in all hospitals and prisons. Filed into compliments and criticisms records for patient.

**Text:** //I AM NOT BROKEN. I AM NOT AN ANOMALY. I AM NOT A LAB RAT. I AM NOT AN EXPERIMENT. I AM NOT A MONSTER. I AM NOT A MONSTER. I AM NOT A MONSTER. THE WORLD DOES NOT NEED TO BE PROTECTED FROM ME. I AM A PART OF THE WORLD YOU STOLE ME FROM.//

**Staff Note(s) (If Applicable):** Ethics Committee interviewing is recommended. If psych care path does not improve, chemical assistance may become necessary over the next several weeks of containment.

**Text:** //03/'22. I've been in here since Sept 2017. My anomalous effects have only gotten worse. They used to only have to put the reality anchors on the lowest setting. I would watch them move the bar. Mom says they're faking it. She said they make up anomalous stuff so they can keep you longer. She said the activist groups have released something called the expunged docs and that they're proving that at least four sites were caught intentionally making people's effects worse, especially when the person is an anti-Foundation activist in the outside world. Several people were released and then recaptured for "worsened effects" but only coincidentally when they began to speak out about what they do to us in containment. I don't know who to believe anymore. This isn't my home. I'm going to shove this into a hole in the wall beside my bed, I guess...//

**Staff Note(s) (If Applicable):** Visitations and phone calls for this patient are now under approved surveillance.

**Text:** //Hi Mr. Trauss, thank you for standing in the halls all night while one of the monsters was out. I just turned 15 and thanks to you I didn't have to be scared all night on my birthday. Thank you for protecting me. -7 PM//

**Staff Note(s) (If Applicable):** Agent Trauss does not at all mind doing his job.

**Text:** //AGENT TRAUSS, please don't mention this note but I was hoping you'd maybe talk to me after your shift? Can you come here off the clock or do you get in trouble? I miss riding in your car. You were the last person I was with in the outside world and it's fucking with my head. Love(?), Janelle//

**Staff Note(s) (If Applicable):** Agent Trauss can't form a personal bond with an anomaly he captured. Scheduling for counseling will be arranged in the next few days for this patient.

**Text:** //"Anomaly" "object" "skip" "scip" "SCiP" "patient" "subject" I HAVE A FUCKING NAME. I AM HUMAN.//

**Staff Note(s) (If Applicable):** Just venting, it appears.

**Text:** //I shouldn't have to beg on my knees to be treated like a person instead of an experiment. Fuck all of you. I hope every single one of you rots in Hell. -J.//

**Staff Note(s) (If Applicable):** That's correct; no patient should have to beg on their knees to be treated like a person instead of an experiment. Complaints like these should be reported through the proper channels, and the offending staff replaced.

**Text:** //A COMPLAINT: I AM A SAPIENT HUMAN BEING WHO IS HERE WILLINGLY. IF ASKING THE DRIVER TO HAVE SEX WITH ME (IT WAS AN OFFER, NOT A DEMAND) IS "INAPPROPRIATE" THEN FINE BUT DON'T MAKE ME TALK TO THE ETHICS COMMITTEE FOR TWO HOURS. I AM NOT INCAPABLE OF INFORMED CONSENT AND IF IT'S AGAINST POLICY THAT'S ONE THING BUT TRYING TO TELL ME I DON'T CONTROL MY OWN BODY IS ANNOYING AS HELL. I AM PERFECTLY STABLE. DON'T BE ASSHOLES. -("redacted")//

**Staff Note(s) (If Applicable):** It's against regulation in all ways. An anomaly being here voluntarily does not change our sexual conduct policy.

**Text:** //as soon as I get my hands on one of you I am taking them straight out and into the wall and you will hear the screaming for hours on end | go fuck yourself before I do | Fuck you, -"SCP-4427"//

**Staff Note(s) (If Applicable):** Standard violence for this anomaly. Scranton-field plates have been installed in the exterior walls of SCP-4427's containment chamber and guard shifts doubled. This note is now on-file with the anomaly's psychiatric team as well.

**Text:** //my release date is tomorrow 03/30 | thank you for saving my life | I love all of you | thank you for protecting me when the country outside treated me like a creepy story instead of a person | thank you for recognizing that I am sapient | thank you for knowing I was human all along | love, SCP-4699//

**Staff Note(s) (If Applicable):** Now those are the kind of results we're after. Copies of this note will be provided to the regional director of the coastal southeastern sites upon next opportunity.

**Text:** //to the guard who opens my door to check on me every 20-23 minutes, i am trying to sleep. maybe part of the reason so many skips are on "suicide watch" is that you have taken all of our rights and privacy away and left us nothing to live for. please stop talking to me. i am just going to become mute from this point forward. cold and cruel are the same thing.//

**Staff Note(s) (If Applicable):** Object has been refusing to speak in all interviews since the point of this note's reception. Complaints are somewhat valid and have been forwarded to the Ethics Committee and psychiatric health departments.

**Text:** //Thank you, Director! My containment specialist has just told me that I'm clear to go back home NEXT WEEK. I am so ecstatic that I just had to write you personally. When you took me I was scared and I fought the containment team. I have always worried that I permanently injured the German man with the big scar down his stomach. I think I knocked his head into a brick wall and knocked him out. I've felt bad ever since -- I know I've only been in a month and I'm only Euclid but is he okay? Can you find out for me and tell me before I leave? It might always bother. Thank you so much for doing what you do. The SCP Foundation saved me from myself. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, SCP-4512/Cheri Moore//

**Staff Note(s) (If Applicable):** 4512 was too young for their effects anyway, so thankfully they were easy to quell. They have been released as of the time of this documentation. Copies of this note will be provided to the regional director of the coastal southeastern sites upon next opportunity.
