**Item #:** SCP-138

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-138 is not to be touched at any time unless given explicit instructions by level 4 personnel for testing. Those given permission must pass a psychological check before entering SCP-138's containment chamber.-- **Containment Breached, See Addendum**

**Description:** SCP-138 appears to be a simple steel medallion engraved with the Chinese symbols yin and yang. When touched by a human, SCP-138 produces a "clone" of the person. This clone acts similarly to the original subject, except that its actions are based primarily on an emotion. The most common emotion-clones include happiness, sadness, fear, and anger. During a clone's duration, the original subject feels a lack of whatever emotion their clone takes after. Nearly all clones die after 2-3 hours, and the original subject regains the ability to feel the emotion they had lost.  Clones killed before naturally expiring after 2-3 hours will not "return" the emotion to the subject.  Original subject will lose the capacity to feel said emotion.


**Addendum 1:** I would like to take this opportunity to remind all D-Class personnel that losing the emotion of fear does not, in fact, make you invincible.  It is not advisable for you to attempt to aggravate any sentient SCP, ever. -Dr. Klein

**Addendum 2:** Someone find out where this thing got to! When I went to the safe deposit box to try and get it, it wasn't there! -Dr. Chao

**Addendum 3:** Unconfirmed reports indicate that an artifact matching its description was auctioned off by [[[groups-of-interest#toc13|MC&D Ltd.]]] at their last Christmas Charity Auction. Please confirm. - O5-9

**Addendum 4:** Confirmed. We tracked the buyer to the Himalayas, but we lost track of him there. All our leads are dead. - Agent Sanchez, Mobile Task Force Phi-Seven (Custodes Custodies)

**Addendum 5:** I want to know who was responsible for the containment breach. Heads are gonna roll for this. - O5-11
