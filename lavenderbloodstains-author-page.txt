The door to a quiet library opens, revealing the sound of the scritching of an ink quill, included purely for aesthetic value. You wander down the shelves, marveling at the rows upon rows of incomplete works, tossed aside like garbage. 

"**[http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/temmieflakes42old The Junkyard]**," these shelves are labelled. Soon, you reach the end of the lane, and find yourself upon a desk, where sits a woman writing with the aforementioned quill pen.

"##purple|//**Hello.**//##" she says.

"##purple|//**You might be wondering who I'm supposed to be? This narrative is already a little confusing from the start, but don't worry; I'll clarify. I'm The High Pagemaster -- a gaudy name for the self insert of my author.**//##"

It sounds cool, alright? I don't know what you want me to tell you.

"##purple|//**Yes, yes, very well. Anyways, this is supposed to be my-- her's-- our, author page. I can take you on a tour of this Library if you'd like? You've already seen The Junkyard, but we have more than just tossed-aside works. Unfortunately, as I can't respond to anything you may say, I will have to begin the tour regardless. Sorry for giving you the illusion of a choice.**//##"

The High Pagemaster ceases writing with her quill, and the quill ceases to exist as it is no longer needed. She stands and sets off, beckoning for you to follow her.

The two of you walk into a back room together, and unfortunately nothing of an explicit nature occurs. All that you find back here are **[http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/lavenderbloodstains dingy manuscripts for works in progress.]** 

"##purple|//**I don't think I need to explain what these are, but for the sake of keeping the flow of the narrative: this is the sandbox page for my author. It links to a couple of other sandboxes, including The Junkyard. There's a bit of cross linking going on here now. Regardless, follow me.**//##"

She steps out of the back room, and over to a side hallway, where you can see rows of plaques on the wall.

"##purple|//**This is the Hall of Honor. Here you will find a list of all of my author's completed mainsite works.**//##"

[[tab Author Commentary]]
[[=]]
She pulls aside each plaque, revealing a couple sheets of paper taped to the back, which she turns towards you.

"##purple|//**These are the author's commentary on her own works. Read them at your leisure.**//##"

[[collapsible show="+ Tension" hide="- Tension"]]
> **Tension:**
> The first successful article I ever wrote for this site. Back at the beginning of 2018, I had read [http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-cool-war-hub The Cool War] and hoped to make a series of tales to rival it. Tension was supposed to be the first of this tale series, but unfortunately I lost traction shortly after publishing it. My comment on the article states "more to come at a later date," and that may still be true, but I have no idea how much later.
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-4084" hide="- SCP-4084"]]
> **SCP-4084, Then Who Was Phone?**
> Based off a true experience of mine, this article was meant to instill a general fear of the unknown and display a case of Impostor syndrome. Within minutes of posting, the article had already gained 2 upvotes, a very positive sign indeed. Though I feel the article may be lacking an actual "narrative" as most SCPs nowadays do, the reception assures that sometimes its okay to be ambiguous. The less you know, the more there is to be afraid of, after all.
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="+ The Gallows Tree" hide="- The Gallows Tree"]]
> **The Gallows Tree:**
> Probably my least favorite article that I've written thus far, only because of how I limited myself. The concept of a vengeful dryad who was wrongfully convicted in life, and now goes around hanging people in a vain attempt to convict the "true" criminals, is a very interesting one that I should have done more with. Instead, I had the Serpent's Hand pretty effortlessly subdue her, mitigating the horror of her concept, and included a member who wanted to fuck her, reducing her even further. She started off as a horrific concept that I mitigated because I felt it was //too// horrifying. But, the SCP site is a horror website, and I've realized now that I probably shouldn't be limiting my horror on a site about horrifying people with your writing. In the future, I hope to imbue a little more raw fear, terror, and/or horror into my articles.

[[tab Art Gallery]]

Once more, she leads you down another hallway, and into a wide room that resembles an art gallery. As luck would have it, that's exactly what that is.

"##purple|//**As our narrator so kindly spoiled, this is The Art Gallery.**//##"

[[collapsible show="+ There's nothing here right now, but you can look around anyways." hide="- This space is merely reserved for the time being."]]
> Nothing in here but empty frames and blank plaques.

And with that,

"##purple|//**You're probably looking to learn a little about the author herself, aren't you? Come, follow me.**//##"

The two of you turn around and head back to the desk of The High Pagemaster's Library. She sits back down, and picks her quill back up out of the narrative non-space. 

You sit there and stare dumbly at her for a few moments.

"##purple|//**Oh, don't mind me. I'm just going to get back to my writings. The narrator will take control from here.**//##"

[[tab Overview]]

]]

I suppose we've reached that time where the author lays themselves bare for the reader to understand. Never fear, for I shall indulge you. Beyond my screen names and gaudy self-insert names, I am just an ordinary person in the world that you reside in, I assume. 

At time of writing, I am a depressed closeted trans girl furry who has chosen the name "Juli." I am currently in my freshman year of college. My birthday is on Halloween, making me a Scorpio, and my MBTI personality type is INFP, if you care about things like that.

I have been an aspiring artist and writer for years, and constantly immerse myself in fictional worlds, both those that I have created and those that I have not. Additionally, I seem to have a habit of typing very formally and eccentrically throughout this author page, but if you were to speak to me in a more informal setting then you would find that I type like an idiot. 

My interests and hobbies are few, but for the past couple years I've mostly been into Dungeons and Dragons and various anime. I sometimes play games that are heavy on story, or watch video series or listen to podcasts, but most of my media consumption is spent reading the wonderful things authors just like me write on this wiki.

If you care to see things that I have written elsewhere, I have created my own wiki known as **[http://the-compendium.wikidot.com/start The Compendium of Knowledge]**, which is essentially a framework of Existence in which all of my fictional stories that don't quite fit into the SCP universe reside. The wiki is full of jargon and gets incredibly pataphysical at points, so I wouldn't blame you if you didn't want to get into it. It is an open wiki however, and users are free to join and contribute their own stories to the framework.

[[tab The Real Talk]]

I've seen a lot of other authors do this, and I guess it's a pertinent enough issue that I ought to do one myself. It's highly unlikely that I'll ever decide to leave this site for good, no matter how frustrated I get I will always be determined to contribute to this community. 

However, in the off chance that I suddenly drop off the face of the Earth due to unforeseen circumstances that may or may not involve my spontaneous death, the below guidelines should be followed when handling the future of my works.

- If I fail to respond to a rewrite request within two weeks, you may consider me missing in action and hereby are granted permission to rewrite the work so long as you follow my wishes.

- I would not like anyone to fundamentally change the core concept of any of my works when making a rewrite. I want them to remain true to what they were when first published, and if they should fail then so be it.

- That is just about the only guideline I have, actually. You are free to interpret my work however you like, as long as you do not fundamentally change the core concept. I am perfectly content with my works being deleted off of the site long after my disappearance due to the content of their core concept because it shows that they were ideas that were simply not meant to last.

The High Pagemaster speaks without looking up from her paper.

"##purple|//**So, there you have it, I assume. That would conclude our tour. We hope you enjoyed your stay. Please, feel free to visit again.**//##"

You turn around and leave The Library, exiting back to reality.
