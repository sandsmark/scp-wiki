++ About the Artist

Hey all, I'm [[*user barredowl]], a somewhat ambitious artist. I have yet to buy any quality drawing equipment and mostly draw via Microsoft's Paint 3D. However, it does its job, and maybe sometime in the future I'll upload some art I'll draw on paper.

++ The Process

So usually, when I'm thinking of drawing an SCP, I usually tend towards a situation which I can easily display. For example, maybe the interview log in [[[SCP-3980]]], or the gramophone from [[[SCP-3939]]]. If it's just a simple humanoid, I usually just draw their face. I occasionally just draw a character from the SCP, such as the Masquerade figure from [[[SCP-4430]]].

After I've fully convinced myself that drawing that part of the SCP is going to be fun, I head over to a [https://lospec.com/palette-list palette list] and select something that catches my eye (usually a four-color palette, since that's the easiest to handle in Paint 3D). I download it via a .txt file and head over to Paint 3D to select the individual colors using a hex code.

Then, I shift the canvas to an appropriate size. If it's smaller (i.e, a humanoid picture) I usually choose a 30x30 canvas. If it's larger (i.e a situation I want to illustrate) I shoot for a 60x60. Then, I get to drawing, expand the canvas to 300x300 once it's finished, and publish it here!
