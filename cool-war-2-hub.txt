[[collapsible show="+ Show Writing Guide" hide="- But Don't Tell Writing Guide"]]
* ask me on IRC or wikidot message (I am randomini, hello) if you can use the title since other people may be working on a draft of the title you want and we don't want people to stumble over each other in a horrible mess nor try to jam two pegs into one hole. please don't post stuff without asking. that said I will almost certainly say yes it's just that I don't want like a gold rush like .tlds and stuff where people buy out all the 2-character tale names and sell them for millions to facebook or google ten years down the track
* use the titles used here rather than making new ones
* they should act as writing prompts for the thing that you do
* stories should be about anart, maybe
* or maybe not I dunno I'm not your mom
