**Item #:** SCP-236

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:**
Any and all materials leaving the containment area are to be scanned for any contamination by SCP-236.  Any objects showing contamination by SCP-236 are to be immediately returned to the containment area and cleared of contamination.  Personnel leaving the containment area must submit to a full physical examination and x-ray.

No objects are to be left in the containment area without personnel present.  Any objects appearing in the containment area are not to be touched until cleared by supervising personnel.  Blast doors are to be opened only to allow personnel in and out of the containment area.

No sudden movement or aggressive action of any kind is allowed in the containment area.  Containment area it to be kept as dark as possible, with night-vision goggles recommended for all interacting personnel.  Should traditional lighting be necessary, lights must be turned on remotely and a waiting period of one hour is to be observed before entry will be allowed.

**Description:**
Outwardly, SCP-236 appears to be a swarm of near-microscopic crabs.  SCP-236 is in reality a collective of self-replicating machines, operating under some form of collective intelligence.  This intelligence appears to grow when units of SCP-236 are joined, and dissipate when they are divided.  The technological skill used to create SCP-236 is very high, and no nanotechnology appears to have been used.  SCP-236 units appear to be made of 20th century components, but miniaturized to a nearly sub-atomic level.  Testing has shown evidence of silicon chips, copper wire, and even gears and pulleys, all working from some as-yet undiscovered power source.

SCP-236 can create additional units from any organic matter.  This includes wood, cotton, or other materials derived from an organic source.  SCP-236 units appear to remove small portions of matter with their pincers, “ingest” it, and eventually “lay” a small metal sphere, which unfolds into a new unit.  This replication takes one minute on average. 
 
Large swarms appear to exhibit an intelligence that is much greater then the individual.  Swarms show very high problem solving skills, encircling tactics, and a very high degree of stealth.  In addition, swarms appear able to take on the physical aspects and appearance of inanimate objects, such as doors, chairs or even paintings, for extended periods of time.  This mimicry is perfect to the naked eye, and is only detectable under a microscope.
