**Item #:** SCP-236

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:**
Any and all materials leaving the containment area are to be scanned for any contamination by SCP-236.  Any objects showing contamination by SCP-236 are to be immediately returned to the containment area and cleared of contamination.  Personnel leaving the containment area must submit to a full physical examination and x-ray.

No objects are to be left in the containment area without personnel present.  Any objects appearing in the containment area are not to be touched until cleared by supervising personnel.  Blast doors are to be opened only to allow personnel in and out of the containment area.

No sudden movement or aggressive action of any kind is allowed in the containment area.  Containment area it to be kept as dark as possible, with night-vision goggles recommended for all interacting personnel.  Should traditional lighting be necessary, lights must be turned on remotely and a waiting period of one hour is to be observed before entry will be allowed.

**Description:**
Outwardly, SCP-236 appears to be a swarm of near-microscopic crabs.  SCP-236 is in reality a collective of self-replicating machines, operating under some form of collective intelligence.  This intelligence appears to grow when units of SCP-236 are joined, and dissipate when they are divided.  The technological skill used to create SCP-236 is very high, and no nanotechnology appears to have been used.  SCP-236 units appear to be made of 20th century components, but miniaturized to a nearly sub-atomic level.  Testing has shown evidence of silicon chips, copper wire, and even gears and pulleys, all working from some as-yet undiscovered power source.

SCP-236 can create additional units from any organic matter.  This includes wood, cotton, or other materials derived from an organic source.  SCP-236 units appear to remove small portions of matter with their pincers, “ingest” it, and eventually “lay” a small metal sphere, which unfolds into a new unit.  This replication takes one minute on average. 
 
Large swarms appear to exhibit an intelligence that is much greater then the individual.  Swarms show very high problem solving skills, encircling tactics, and a very high degree of stealth.  In addition, swarms appear able to take on the physical aspects and appearance of inanimate objects, such as doors, chairs or even paintings, for extended periods of time.  This mimicry is perfect to the naked eye, and is only detectable under a microscope.  Swarms will sometimes even destroy existing objects and replace them, to better camouflage their mimicry.  

SCP-236 units appear to fear light, rapid movement, or loud noises.  This fear is reduced in proportion to the number of units in a swarm, but even large collectives can be startled by a sudden sound or bright light.  SCP-236 that are startled while mimicking a object will rapidly break apart into individual units.  Individual units will quickly try to escape to any nearby darkness and hide.

When cornered, or unable to escape quickly, SCP-236 units will initiate their “defensive response”.  This entails a unit raising it's pincers, and then detonating with a explosion equivalent to twenty pounds of C-4 explosive.  Unfortunately, this is often enough to startle nearby units into a defensive response, resulting in a chain reaction.  Any surviving units will then emerge and begin to consume any available matter, and re-create the swarm.

SCP-236 will use humans or any other living things as a resource, provided the swarm is of a sufficient size.  Moderate size swarms can convert a whole human being in less then five minutes.  Units have also been observed entering the human body, typically while the subject is asleep, and begin to convert from the inside out.  This behavior, coupled with mimicry and the defensive response, make SCP-236 very difficult to detect and contain effectively.

**Addendum:** 
While SCP-236 has not been observed to mimic organic life, the possibility exists for SCP-236 to develop this behavior.  Notably, during testing on [DATA EXPUNGED].  Such formations are to be immediately reported, and testing area cleared immediately.
