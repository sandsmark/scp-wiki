**Item #:** SCP-3327

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The entrance to SCP-3327, along with approximately 1km^^2^^ of surrounding land, has been placed into Foundation custody by the Russian government. The area has been designated an official military site and is guarded appropriately. Any unauthorized personnel who enter SCP-3327 are to be amnesticized and removed from the site, following standard secrecy protocol.

A safe zone spanning three rooms in each direction has been established around the origin room, and the border of the safe zone is marked in red paint. Though no hostile entities have been found within SCP-3327, its anomalous layout makes it difficult to navigate, so personnel are to stay inside the safe zone to avoid becoming lost. Each of the four corner rooms contains a Relative Positioning System beacon (see Addendum 1). Each beacon is to be inspected once daily, and repaired as necessary.

Any personnel who wish to exit the safe zone must follow the guidelines below, depending on how far they wish to travel from the origin room.

* **No farther than 100 rooms:** Permission from a level 3 or higher researcher, a plan of exploration, a standard one-day supply package, and a Relative Positioning Device (RPD).
* **Between 101 and 10,000 rooms:** Permission from a level 4 or higher researcher, a detailed plan of exploration, an appropriately sized supply package, and an RPD. Must travel in a team of four or more.
* **Between 10,001 and 100,000 rooms:** Must submit an expedition proposal to the current head researcher of SCP-3327.
* **Farther than 100,001 rooms:** Currently not permitted.

**Description:** SCP-3327 is a Cold War-era bunker outside Syktyvkar, Russia. The above-ground portion is a small concrete building typical of bunker entrances at the time. Inside is a ladder leading downwards into the origin room.

The origin room is bare except for the entrance ladder, which is placed against a corner of the room, and a single pedestal in the center of the room. Upon the pedestal is a large mass of heavily damaged machinery of currently unknown function (designated SCP-3327-1).

At the center of each of the four walls is a single doorway, which leads into a neighbouring room. All rooms thus far explored are identical to the origin room, but without the entrance ladder or the device in the center of the room. There is no observable limit to the number of rooms. Four autonomous drones have been deployed from the origin room to explore the rooms, each in a different direction. At the time of writing, the drones have traveled over 1,000,000 rooms from the origin without any change in surroundings.

All rooms in SCP-3327 occupy the same geographical area as the origin room according to all known global positioning systems. However, other devices such as communications systems lose function at great distances as expected. Furthermore, any communication between the outside and inside of SCP-3327 deteriorates abnormally quickly as the distance from the origin room increases, with communication between inside and outside being effectively impossible at roughly 100 rooms away from the origin.

Neither human nor drone exploration has uncovered anything of interest in any of the rooms, with the exception of a single corpse and journal (see Addendum 2). Further exploration is ongoing, with plans to extend the range of the RPS and send human teams farther from the origin room.

**Addendum 1: The Relative Positioning System**

With the ineffectiveness of standard global positioning systems, the Relative Positioning System was designed to prevent personnel from becoming lost while exploring SCP-3327. Four beacons have been placed in the safe zone as detailed in Containment Procedures. The RPDs carried by personnel receive signals from the four beacons, and use the difference in signal travel distances to calculate and display its position relative to the origin room. The RPDs are programmed so each room occupies a single coordinate on a Cartesian coordinate plane, and so the coordinate changes upon stepping through a doorway. The current RPS has an effective range of approximately 120,000 rooms, or 1,200 kilometers.

**Addendum 2:** The following journal was found in room (560, -214) near a corpse, whose nametag identifies him as Dr. Josef Abramov. The age of the corpse is uncertain but estimated at 50-60 years, and the cause of death was determined to be dehydration. No further items of interest were discovered. The text below has been translated from Russian, and the original text is available as Document 3327-1-O.

> **July 12, 1960**
> They contacted me today and told me I was being assigned to a new project. They have acquired a new anomalous object, and they want to use it against the Americans. They told me details would come later.
>  
> **July 14, 1960**
> They call it the Prism. They won't tell me how they acquired it, but they showed me what it does, and it is amazing. The Prism creates space out of nothing. Leave it in a room, and after a day the room has grown twofold in size. Then it starts making new rooms, all within the same space.
> It doesn't work quite right, though. The rooms are flawed, poor facsimiles of real ones. There are floors of glass and windows of wood, and doors and stairs that lead nowhere.
> They told me that my job was to fix this Prism, to make it work right.
>  
> **September 27, 1960**
> The first prototype of the amplifier is complete. If my theories are right, this should bring order to the way the Prism generates rooms. Testing will commence tomorrow.
>  
> **September 28, 1960**
> Success! The Prism expanded the first room as expected, and created a dozen more just like it. However, the rooms still began to decay farther from the entrance.
> I will begin anew tomorrow.
>  
> **November 17, 1960**
> I am still rebuilding and refining the amplifier. With every test, the Prism's behaviour is more and more regular. We plan to use this to build a bunker - no, a network of bunkers - that will span kilometers and kilometers. We can create a new Russia in those bunkers, one that the Americans will never be able to touch.
>  
> **December 26, 1960**
> The end is near. The latest iteration of the amplifier is almost perfect. The Prism generated over ten thousand rooms before its behaviour became irregular again. To step into a room, and see hundreds more just like it branching out in each direction, is a truly stunning experience.
>  
> **January 18, 1961**
> My work is done. The amplifier and the Prism generated more than twenty thousand rooms, and each one was as perfect as the first. They told me that the final stage will begin soon.
>  
> **January 29, 1961**
> They have brought me to the site, and construction has begun. This will be my life's greatest work, and with it I will carve my name into history.
>  
> **February 7, 1961**
> The amplifier has been built in what will soon be the first of many rooms. All that is left is to place the Prism within it.
>  
> **February 12, 1961**
> The Prism has been at work for almost a week now. The squadron they sent said that there should be at least a hundred thousand rooms by now. Every single one is a flawless copy of the first.
>  
> **February 19, 1961**
> I have been given permission to take a backpack of supplies and explore the rooms. I am excited to see the fruits of my labour, but the endless repetition of empty rooms is unsettling.
>  
> **February 21, 1961**
> The rooms are far more confusing than I anticipated. Every direction looks the same.
> I fear I may be lost.
>  
> **February 23, 1961**
> Today, I met a man dressed in strange clothes. He is the first person I have seen in far too many days. I called out to him.
> When he saw me, his face went pale, as if he had seen a ghost. I asked him what was wrong. He asked for my name, and I gave it to him.
> Then, he told me that I could not possibly be Josef, because Josef Abramov was dead.
>  
> **February 24, 1961**
> He brought me to his team, a group of men and women all dressed in the same strange clothes.
> They conversed for a while, and finally took me to a corpse wearing their uniform. A corpse that shares my face.
> They told me that they were part of a group sent to explore the rooms. Not-Josef was to set up camp, while they were to scout ahead. When they returned, not-Josef was dead.
> But what none of us understand is how I came to meet a version of me that was not myself, nor how he died in this endless maze.
> None of this makes sense. I fear my work with the Prism may have gone too far.
>  
> **February 25, 1961**
> They told me more about this bunker. They used words that I did not understand, but I grasped that this bunker was wrong somehow. They told me that they planned to destroy the cause of the wrongness before it could cause more harm.
> They also asked me to leave the bunker with them. I refused, replying that I would rather find my way back into my own world than exit into theirs. They let me leave them, despite their protests.
>  
> **February 28, 1961**
> Is it February 28th? I have been counting the days, but I have not seen the light of day in perhaps a week.
> My food supply is almost gone. I do not know where I am, where the exit is, or where I met the people in strange clothes who showed me my own corpse.
> Maybe I will die in this maze of perfect, identical rooms that I have worked so hard to create.
>  
> //No date given//
> I have not had anything to eat in... I don't know how long. Two days? Three? I am almost out of water as well. This bunker will be my grave.
>  
> //No date given//
> Perhaps the Prism was broken for a reason.
> Perhaps we were not meant to fix it.

Neither the corpse of "not-Josef" nor the entrance from which his team supposedly came from have been found. Several GoIs have been questioned about both the Prism and the project mentioned, but all denied any knowledge of both. Abramov was found to be a member of GoI-████, which was dissolved in 1972. According to partial records, he was killed in action along with the rest of his team while exploring an unspecified spatial anomaly. Further efforts are being made to find complete records of this expedition.
