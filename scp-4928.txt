**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4928 is to be contained in a standard quadruped containment cell, in accordance with the Parazoology Department's Guidelines.

The structure containing SCP-4928-1 has been sealed with concrete.

**Description:** SCP-4928 is a collection of seven kittens dressed in Halloween costumes. Every instance also wears identical collars bearing the word "Billy's" in a child's handwriting. All seven instances are perpetually wet, and staff interacting with them are encouraged to bring towels to dry themselves. All attempts to harm SCP-4928 have failed. 

SCP-4928-1 was a persistent auditory anomaly within SCP-4928's discovery site: A child's voice, crying out for his mother, repeated every thirty seconds prior to being sealed.

**Discovery:** SCP-4928 was discovered at the bottom of a well on the Hollingson Farm in rural Vermont inside of a burlap sack, as well as the skeleton of a 12-year-old boy, later identified as William Elliot. Elliot was reported missing on the night of October 31st, 1960, after his treehouse was found ransacked. A switchblade belonging to one Jonathan Regis, a local fourteen-year-old named as a suspect in the disappearance by local police, was discovered in a cookie tin within the treehouse’s wreckage. No other anomalous properties were observed within the well.
