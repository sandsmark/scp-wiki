**Item #:** SCP-343

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-343 is currently uncontained. No reliable method of containing SCP-343 has been found.

SCP-343 has taken up regular residence in humanoid containment chamber 208 within Site 17. All contact with SCP-343 is to follow standard humanoid interview protocols. In the case of unauthorized contact, personnel are to politely decline conversation with SCP-343 and report the incident to the nearest supervisory personnel. If contact cannot be avoided, all information gathered is to be likewise reported.

In the case of SCP-343 making contact outside of the Foundation’s direct jurisdiction, appropriate cover-up countermeasures are to be taken as soon as the extent and content of contact has been ascertained. 

It must be noted that, due to the nature of SCP-343, the contents of this document may have been edited by the entity. There presence of this statement cannot serve as accurate evidence that this document has not been modified.

**Description:** SCP-343 is an entity of unknown origin capable of the manipulation of reality at will. SCP-343 will regularly vary its appearance and form. Generally it will take the appearance of a human, varying in age, gender, and racial background, but has appeared on occasion in the form of animals or inanimate objects.

SCP-343 does not have to seem a maximum range to its abilities, or any apparent limit to the extent these abilities might be used. SCP-343 has shown itself to be capable of the creation, destruction, and manipulation of matter and energy on a massive scale, the manipulation of space and time on similar scales, and accurate knowledge of persons, places and events that should not be readily known. SCP-343 has yet to show any adverse effects to the use of this ability, contrary to other anomalous entities of this nature.

At no time has SCP-343 been observed to use its abilities in order to aid or damage any outside party: However, due to the nature of SCP-343, it must be presumed that all confirmed actions it has taken were intended to be known. While SCP-343 acts in a non-confrontational manner and has claimed to pose no threat to the Foundation, the fact that action on its part to subvert Foundation interests is impossible to detect makes confirmation of this claim impossible. 

SCP-343 first came into the knowledge of the Foundation when it manifested in the previously unused humanoid containment chamber 208 in Site 17. The chamber was found to be unsecured and fully furnished, with SCP-343 inside. Investigating personnel were invited by SCP-343 for a meal: the request was denied. An official contact team was assembled soon after.

**Addendum-01: Incident Report 343-06** ██/██/20██ - During an interview session with SCP-343, the entity was asked to demonstrate the scope of its abilities. SCP-343 agreed with the request, and proceeded to initiate a CK-class event, wherein Earth was orbited by the planet Jupiter. This state lasted from 14:30 to 16:15, when SCP-343 reverted all changes. Upon reversion, the only records of the event were those made by the Foundation during the period of manipulation: beyond these records, no conclusive evidence of the event could be found. As such, the actual veracity of the event's existence is questionable.

**Addendum-02: Interview Log ██/██/20██** 

> Agent ██████: If you would, please explain your purpose for remaining in Foundation custody.
> 
> SCP-343: I’m doing that right now.
> 
> Agent ██████: What are you doing, then.
> 
> SCP-343: I'm answering your question.
> 
> Agent ██████: No, you haven’t. If you don’t wish to answer questions, that is perfectly acceptable, but I have to ask that you refrain from leading us on like this. It’s very frustrating.
> 
> SCP-343: No, no, see, I believe you misunderstand me. The entire purpose of my existence is to sit here, in this room, and have a conversation with you in which I explain that my purpose is to sit here and talk to you.
> 
> Agent ██████: So when I end this interview and exit this room, you will have no purpose?
> 
> SCP-343: Yes. No. Not anymore. Purpose is a tricky thing, █████. It’s a very tricky thing. If an axe is used to cut firewood, and then is used to kill a man the next day, what is its real purpose, when you really think about it, in terms of the big picture? 
> 
> Agent ██████: I don’t see how it can’t be both, and I don’t see how this is relevant. 
> 
> SCP-343: I’m afraid it’s very relevant, █████. The nature of things is always relevant. Take this chair for example. It is now a washing machine.
> 
> Agent ██████: You haven’t done anything with it.
> 
> SCP-343: Yes I have. I’ve turned it into a washing machine.
> 
> Agent ██████: Excuse me?
> 
> SCP-343: It used to be a chair, now it is a washing machine. Now it is a rhinoceros. 
> 
> Agent ██████: It still looks like a chair. [raps knuckles on the arm of the chair]. Still made of wood like a chair. I’m guessing that if I took this chair down to the lab, analysis would tell me that it is one-hundred percent mahogany wood, with varnish.
> 
> SCP-343: Correct. However, they would be wrong, as it is a rhinoceros.
> 
> Agent ██████: I’m afraid I don’t follow.
> 
> SCP-343: That’s a very simple way of thinking, █████.
