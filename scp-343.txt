**Item #:** SCP-343

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-343 resides in a 6.1mx6.1m (20ftx20ft) room at Minimal Security, Site 17. SCP-343's chamber should be remotely monitored at all times. Any requests made by SCP-343 may be granted without supervisory approval, and it should be personally visited by at least one staff member each day. Attempts to add further safety precautions or required clearances are unnecessary/impossible due to the nature of SCP-343 (see description).

**Description:** SCP-343 is seemingly an elderly male human of indeterminate race, though descriptions of exact features differ between observers, even those viewing him concurrently.  Subject has been noted as the perpetrator of several atypical events: see Incident Log 343 below for more details. SCP-343 is, for the moment, detained willingly in his chamber, though actual attempts to contain him have proven utterly futile.

SCP-343 was originally discovered walking the streets of Prague, during the retrieval operation for SCP-███. His unusual nature first came to the Foundation's attention when a retrieval team coordinator witnessed him disappear from the streets and reappear instantly on a nearby rooftop. During initial interviews, conducted by Dr. Beck, SCP-343 claimed outright to be the creator of the universe, effortlessly breaching containment to prove his claim. SCP-343 is an excellent conversationalist, displaying a constantly pleasant demeanour and a willingness to speak with staff on almost any topic, with apparent authority.

**Addendum #343-1:** "SCP-343 has been colloquially nicknamed "God" by the staff here. This isn't quite surprising: in my first talk with him he said he created the universe. When I asked him to prove it, he laughed, walked through the wall of the chamber and returned seconds later with a hamburger in his hand. On my second visit, I entered the chamber only to find that the previously bare cell had been furnished in up-scale, Old English style, complete with roaring fireplace, with vastly increased internal dimensions. SCP-343 seems to greatly enjoy speaking with people, and visiting SCP-343 has become a daily event for many of the staff here. All employees report feeling generally happier after each visit. Originally, attempts were made to bar staff below Level 3 clearance: these proved unsuccessful when guards assigned to watch the room were found to have permitted all visitors despite express instruction and threats of disciplinary action, repeating only 'You know (SCP-343) likes company' when questioned. Despite this, given SCP-343's history of compliance, all staff have subsequently been granted access. For now, I leave this report open as further questioning of SCP-343 is ongoing." - Dr. Beck

**Addendum #343-2:** "Those exposed regularly to SCP-343 seem to quickly develop an attachment.  Several personnel have given up leave or vacation time to remain close by. Frankly, I find this inexplicable devotion to this SCP after just a brief period of contact worrisome.  I encourage further investigation." - Dr. Duggan

**Addendum #343-3:** "It has come to my attention that staff have begun to refer to SCP-343 as "God" in informal conversation. I would like to take this opportunity to remind all staff that despite pleasant appearances, SCP-343 has demonstrated an unparalleled ability to manipulate reality, apparently at a whim. No countermeasures have yet displayed any level of effectiveness. Staff are asked to keep this in mind in all dealings with SCP-343." - Dr. Hoffman

**Addendum #343-4** "Are you //actually// telling me there's **__no way__** to contain this guy? A sentient reality-altering being that we are //completely powerless// to stop? Do you realize that the integrity of this entire organization, and the continued containment of uncountable dire threats to the existence of the species depend on one man's //good humour//? I'm approving unlimited funding for SCP-343's containment. In the meantime, try not to piss him off." - O5-2

**Addendum #343-5** "On a related note: what precisely is SCP-343's purpose in remaining with the Foundation? A being with what has not yet shown to be anything short of complete omnipotence, and it's fully content to remain in its room and //talk//. Future questioning of SCP-343 is to have illumination of SCP-343's motivations and desires as its object." - O5-1
