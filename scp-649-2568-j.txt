**Item #:** SCP-649-2568

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP 649-2568 is to be kept in a standard animal containment unit. Under no circumstances is SCP 649-2568 to be allowed to discuss illnesses or injuries relating to any personnel.

Interviews of SCP 649-2568 should be scheduled daily, with a focus on preventing any future escape attempts. All other testing involving SCP 649-2568 requires approval from the project director.

**Description:** SCP 649-2568 is an entity which superficially resembles the species //Bucephala albeola//. Despite this resemblance, SCP 649-2568 retains the personality and speech patterns of a human male. SCP 649-2568 has shown a capacity to effectively treat injuries or illnesses it sees, or has heard described in a patient. This effect can occur regardless of a lack of physical contact between a subject and the object.

Events relating to the object's curative function begin with a slight tremor in muscle groups near the site of the injury (or in the case of illness, around affected tissue). These tremors will grow in strength until the subject becomes incapable of voluntary use of these muscle groups. Following 2-6 minutes the subject will regain some control over all muscle groups and symptoms associated with the event will cease.

When interviewed, SCP-649-2568 has professed to have earned several doctorates from a number of prestigious medical schools. Research utilizing names provided by the object have yielded several records which tentatively confirm these claims.

Despite the apparent effectiveness of SCP-649-2568's curative function, the long term effects of these events have yet to be properly cataloged. Interviews should focus particularly on the history of the object and any persons subject to the curative effect prior to containment by the Foundation.
