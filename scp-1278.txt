**Item #:** SCP-1278

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1278 is to be contained in a standard medium-security storage locker at Site-██. Due to the potential for misuse, access is restricted to Level-3 personnel or higher. Any Level-3 personnel wishing to access SCP-1278 for research purposes may generate a password at any Site-██ terminal that will grant access to SCP-1278. Please note that the password will expire after 24 hours. Use of SCP-1278 for any purpose other than research is forbidden. Testing with underwater photographs or photographs taken outside of Earth's atmosphere is forbidden after tests 1278-3 and 1278-5.

**Description:** SCP-1278 is a photo frame, 25cm in length and 20cm in height. The object is composed of a pinewood frame, painted gold, with a glass cover and a cardboard backing. A stainless steel latch can be found on all four edges of the cardboard backing, opening the latches allows access to the interior of SCP-1278. Also present on the back is a cardboard "leg" attached to a stainless steel hinge to allow the frame to rest upright on a flat surface and a hook on the top and left side of the object, allowing it to be hung on a wall in both portrait and landscape orientation. No information regarding who manufactured SCP-1278, or when or where it was made is present on the object, but manufacturing methods and materials used, as well as tests of composition of the paint indicates that it was built sometime between 19██ and 20██. 

SCP-1278's unusual properties manifest when a photograph of no larger than 25x20cm is inserted into the object. Drawings or other artistic depictions do not trigger SCP-1278's affects. The photograph will briefly "shimmer" and waves will be see radiating from the center of the image, visually similar to ripples on the surface of a pond. After a period of between 1-3 minutes, the frame will function as a 2-way portal between the 2 locations. Removing the rear of SCP-1278 allows the photograph to be removed at which point the portal closes. The other end of the "window" appears as a 25x20cm rectangle, apparently 2-dimensional, with one side acting as a portal to the location of the the object and the other being jet-black, absorbing all frequencies of electromagnetic radiation. Any object small enough to fit through SCP-1278 may be passed through from either side. Gases and electromagnetic radiation of all frequencies are also affected, and researchers should take care to avoid opening portals to locations inhospitable to human life except under carefully controlled conditions.

**Addendum: Test Logs.**

**Test 1278-1:**
Location depicted: The exterior of Site-██
Procedure: Photograph inserted into frame. Researchers █████ and ██████████ dispatched to the location the test photograph was taken to observe exit.
Result: Affects manifest as normal, exit of SCP-1278 observed. Sample not taken as the "exit" is incorporeal on one side and indestructible on the other. It should be noted that the "exit" acts as a perfect black-body and may have research applications. Further testing regarding these properties awaiting approval from Site Command

**Test 1278-2:** 
Location depicted: Pencil sketch of New York City skyline
Procedure: Photograph inserted into frame as normal.
Result: SCP-1278's affects did not manifest, after 15 minutes test was discontinued.

**Test 1278-3:**
Location depicted: Underwater photograph taken in Dr. ████'s personal aquarium
Procedure: Photograph inserted into frame as normal.
Result: Affects manifest as normal. Contents of aquarium immediately spill out onto floor of test chamber. Clean-up crew dispatched to test chamber, testing moved to Test Chamber 14.

**Test 1278-4:**
Location depicted: Exterior of Site-██, photograph taken with 20x telescopic zoom.
Procedure: Photograph inserted into frame. Research team dispatched to location photo was taken.
Result: Affect manifests as normal. Exit of SCP-1278 not found at location photo was taken. Portal found 15 meters from Site, photograph was taken 300 meters from site. 

//"So, this thing accounts for zoom. I've got an idea"//- Dr. ████

**Test 1278-5:**
Location depicted: Photograph taken by Hubble space telescope depicting the Horsehead Nebula. Zoom unknown.
Procedure: D-245 instructed to insert the photograph into SCP-1278 and remain in the test chamber. 
Result: Affect manifests as normal, but takes significantly longer, exact time unknown as the test was not timed. Atmosphere of test chamber immediately escapes through portal into deep space. The lens of the camera recording the test exploded due to the pressure differential. Audio records a brief rush of air and a scream before going silent. Sensors in the chamber record increased levels of microwave radiation as well as gamma and beta waves. 
Researcher ███, outfitted with spacesuit normally used in research of SCP-███ enters test chamber to remove the photograph. D-245 was found stuck in the photo frame, with his legs and pelvis on the far end and his torso, arms and head remaining in the test chamber. Autopsy determined cause of death to be asphyxiation and explosive decompression of the lungs. Upon removal of the photograph from the frame, D-245 was cleanly bisected at the waist. D-245's legs and pelvis were not recovered, his torso and upper extremities remained in the test chamber.



//Note: The potential to use SCP-1278 to establish a small Foundation site on the surface of Mars using photos sent from NASA's Mars rovers is being explored, however the size limit presented by SCP-1278 as well as the recent [DATA EXPUNGED] from NASA [DATA EXPUNGED] at this time.//
