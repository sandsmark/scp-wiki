**Item #:** SCP-4586

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4586 is to be kept at Site-19, in a standard humanoid containment cell, connected to a 5m corridor leading to the facility. A control room is to be built adjacent to the cell to monitor the specimen through a camera, placed in the cell. SCP-4586 is equipped with a Mark V shock collar, operated by technicians in the control room. Batteries must be exchanged every 72 hours, and any attempts of the subject to tamper with the collar must be met with an electric discharge to incapacitate it. Should SCP-4586 remove the collar, two guards, outfitted with electric guns and tasers, are to stun the specimen. In the event of a successful containment breach, the site is to be placed on lockdown and Mobile Task Force Lambda-5 ("White Rabbits") on-site team is to incapacitate and recontain SCP-4586. 

Under no circumstances should any mechanical or electric devices be left in SCP-4586's cell, as the specimen is capable of modifying them to an unknown extent and is likely to employ them in an eventual containment breach (See Addendum 4586-02).

Access to SCP-4586 requires Level 3 clearance or above.

**Description:** SCP-4586 is a mobile human skeleton 1.84m in height and 50kg in weight, wearing a 19th century-era suit, matching black shoes, black gloves, a top hat and a decorative wooden cane. Despite the lack of necessary organs, subject possesses visual and auditory capabilities similar to that of a normal person. While it is still unknown how the specimen is able to hear, tests have confirmed SCP-4586 is capable of seeing through its only eye, located on the left socket of its skull. Subject cannot see through its right eye and its respective socket and nose have been covered with a black material believed to be a polymer of unknown composition. Even though SCP-4586 is incapable of blinking, both the eye and the subject’s sight do not appear to be affected. Additionally, while it lacks both muscular tissues and an apparent nervous system, SCP-4586 can walk and run at average speeds. As of yet, no attempts of extracting samples from either SCP-4586's bones, the material in its eye socket or its functional eye have been successful. Subject is capable of enduring extreme temperatures, pressure and kinetic impact. However, while the entity is resistant to most types of damage, electric stun guns and tasers can temporarily incapacitate SCP-4586 (See Addendum 4586-01). 

    Subject is sentient and capable of engaging in both verbal and written communication in several languages, although it has shown a preference for English, and is usually formal in its speech. SCP-4586 is extremely intelligent (tests have shown it to have an IQ of 187) and is knowledgeable on several subjects, such as philosophy, mathematics and history. According to written and oral accounts from SCP-4586, its scientific knowledge ranges from that available during the 19th century to current times. The specimen is capable of building mechanical devices (sometimes with anomalous properties) with few resources available, employing an unknown crafting method. Subject claims to be well versed in a scientific field of difficult comprehension, related to a "work" recurrently mentioned.

    SCP-4586 claims to be Dr. Robert Murthwallen, born in 1830 in █████████, New York. The entity is capable of providing a detailed biography of Dr. Murthwallen’s life. However, should it be questioned about certain events or details, SCP-4586 appears to purposely provide vague answers, and should it be pressed to reveal more, it either attempts to switch the topic at hand or it refuses to answer.  Records from the Murthwallen family reveal that Robert was a reclusive individual who dedicated much of his life and his family’s wealth to his scientific pursuits. In April of 1867, Dr. Murthwallen was reported missing, before he was presumed dead in June of that year. Neither Dr. Murthwallen’s body nor his burial grounds have ever been located.

> 
> **SCP-4586**: Of course, my dear sir. How do you fare?
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: I'm, uh, fine. SCP-4586, I'd like to ask you a couple of questions.
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Very well. How may I be of assistance? 
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: First of all, can you explain what you are?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: As far as I am aware, sir, I am a man. Well, perhaps... an unique specimen amongst others, as my flesh and blood have long expired. Still, a man nevertheless.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: A man, you say? Who are you?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: My name is Dr. Robert Arthur Murthwallen, good sir. I was born on September 19th, 1830, in █████████, New York.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: Okay then. So, your flesh and blood "expired". I take it that you died?
>  
> **SCP-4586**: As a matter of fact, sir, no. I removed them from my body.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: You removed- Why would you remove them?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: I found that, even in the most favorable outcome, I would not survive to see my work completed. Thus, I had no alternative but to alter my body to suit such needs.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: You… altered your body? How?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: I built a... machine that allowed me to safely conduct the transition. But I wouldn't want to bore you with tortuous and rather gruesome details, lest you become unnecessarily confused.  
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: No, I want to hear about it. What kind of machine was it? 
> 
> **SCP-4586**:  Good sir, I'm sure that there are better subjects than a relic of the past for science men like us to discuss. After all, the prog-

> **SCP-4586**: It was an insignificant device, sir.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: I'd like you to clarify about it. What components did you employ in its creation? 
> 
> **SCP-4586**: I would prefer not to speak of this subject.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: How long did it take for it to be built?

> **Interviewer:** Dr. Coulter
> 
> **Date:** 13/02/20██

> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: SCP-4586, come in. 
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Well, hello, good sir! How have you fared in these past days? 
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: Fine, SCP-4586. Today, I'd like to-
> 
> **SCP-4586**: If I may speak with candor, doctor, I expected our interview to take place quite some time after the last one, considering what I believe to have been multiple tests since my incarceration.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: That's exactly the topic I want to discuss with you today, SCP-4586. We've analysed your, uh, skeleton, and we found it impossible to sample it. Now, in our last conversation, you said to have "altered your body" to serve a certain function. I suppose that this alteration process is responsible for that?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Precisely, sir. Were I to remain with my primitive endoskeleton, it would surely be a great detriment to the progress of my work. I had its composition altered to sustain most difficulties I could potentially encounter.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: With your machine, correct?
> 
> [SCP-4586 remained silent for three seconds]
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Yes, sir.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: What is it really, the compound on your skeleton?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: If you really must know, good doctor, it is a type of polymer that I have personally developed. While crafting it was more herculean that I had initially anticipated, I dare say that the results have far outweighted all exertions.
> 
> Dr. Coulter: And that black material in the other eye?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: The exact same compound, sir, in a highly concentrated state. A mere consequence of my transition.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: What about your other eye? What's it made of?
> 
>  **SCP-4586**: Oh, I do not believe, doctor, that such substance is not widely known to others. I myself had only managed to synthesize a meager amount. One could call it, I gather, an artificial matter, assembled in a synthetic organ, one to enable my sight once I had become what I am today.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: Why is it that you have only one eye, SCP-4586?
> 
> [SCP-4586 remained silent for five seconds]
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Well, sir, such is the mark of my initial carelessness. I once possessed the ability to see with both eyes, yet I was cursed from a young age to have the right one unable to properly view the world from a distance. Thus, I had always worn a monocle to circumvent this unfortunate issue. However, upon the commencement of my alteration process, I had forgotten about my machine's unacceptability of metallic devices. I was unable to remove it from the eye in time, which led to its destruction and of the monocle.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: You didn't think about... I don't know, replacing it? Building a new one?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Of course, good sir. Such enterprise, nonetheless, proves to be arduous, as the materials required to craft the required compound are of extreme scarcity. Notwithstanding, sir, not only has the lack of such eye proved completely useless in hindering my work, it is also a manner for me to remember what dire effects can one's haphazardness lead to when dealing with the unknown. 
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: I see. Well, SCP-4586, that'll be all for this interview.
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Certainly, doctor.
>  
> **<End Log>**
> 
>  **Closing Statement:** //SCP-4586 continues to sustain that it modified its body with unknown devices and substances, though it is still unclear how it allegedly did that. Further tests are to be scheduled to determine the specimen's physical endurance. Subject continues to refer to a supposed "work", but was also not specific on its nature.

> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: Alright, SCP-4586. Can you hear me in there?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Yes, I can, good doctor! It has been a long while since we have had our last conversation. 
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: Indeed it has. Though I see that you've been busy, writing on these notebooks we've given you.
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Yes, sir, indeed. While you have shown to be almost entirely incomplient with my requests, I must make do with the resources I have at my disposal. After all, I would rather carry on with my work than to remain idle in this cell.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: I see. SCP-4586, since we last spoke, you have requested access to several materials. When you did so, you claimed that they're vital to your work. What is this work, exactly? 
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Well, sir, such is a subject I am not accustomed of conversing with others about, especially because of its incomparable nature. Nevertheless, I believe the most precise analogy to the answer of this question would be to mend a wound.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: To "mend a wound"? How so?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Firstly, sir, one would need to know of the existence of multiple planes of reality in our universe.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: Planes of reality... as in different dimensions?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Indeed, sir. While they are to remain parallel, however, one of these planes has managed to coincide with ours. Its elements, thus, bleed into our world, and affect it accordingly.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: What sort of elements?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Forgive me, sir, but I cannot explain satisfactorily what they are, especially without proper means. However, I believe one such as yourself could observe them in certain rare objects.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: What kind of objects, SCP-4586?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Objects, doctor, that are not what they seem. Most resemble ordinary items, yet they possess... anomalous proprieties. Some are unique, with no respective versions of themselves to be commonly found. Still, all of these devices were forged, with those elements as its prime material. Their anomalous behavior is not the product of chance, but of careful engineering, sir.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: And how is all this related to your "work"?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: The purpose, and the means with which those objects were created, sir, are vile. As long as the two planes of reality continue to intersect, they will continue to be made. Thus, my work consists of studying the elements of this new dimension and reversing their effects. And if you and your fellow companions were to assist me in such endeavour, we would be certain to make significant progress.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: I'm afraid that's not happening, SCP-4586.
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Well, that is unfortunate. Is there anything else I could be of service to you, my good sir?
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: No, SCP-4586. That will be all for today.
> 
> **<End Log>**

> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: SCP-4586, come in.
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Hello, doctor! How are you today, sir?
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: SCP-4586, I'd like to discuss your attempted containment breach. You managed to disable your shock collar and was using the pieces to build something. I'd like to know what your objective was.
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Good doctor, speaking with full sincerity, I truly aimed to escape this facility and direct myself somewhere I could continue my work uninterrupted. It has been quite some time since it has yielded pragmatic results, and I would __certainly__ not wish it to linger more than it already has.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: Is that why you created that device we recovered?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Yes, sir. While I had not yet found a way to imperceptibly remove its power cell to fuel my machine, it could have assuredly propitiated my flight from this cell.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: This device you were creating, what was it, exactly?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Nothing special, sir. In elementar terms, I believe you could consider it a lockpick of sorts.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: So you've lost your notebooks, the progress of your work over something that wasn't special?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Oh, sir, you misunderstand the value I attribute to them. I merely used them a method of organising my theories and propositions during this incarceration period, as I memorise most of the information regarding my work. All positives aside, I would have preferred to retain them.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: Well, we will taking a better look at them now, SCP-4586.
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Yes, I would assume as much, doctor. Nevertheless, I am not one of great expectations concerning the results from its analysis, due to its uniqueness.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: What makes you think we won't be able to ever understand this work of yours, SCP-4586?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Sir, if I may trouble you for a lamentable comparison, you and your fellow researchers remind me of my father. He was the proprietor of great wealth, yet he did not employ it for anything else other than the achievement of more wealth or mere luxuries. It proved to be quite a challenge to convince him to assist me with my scientific projects, as he did not possess the farsightness necessary to comprehend them. I, on the other hand, understand my work, have the necessary temperance, and, with the right conditions, could accomplish it much faster than at this rate.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: Well, unfortunately, that option is unavailable to you, SCP-4586.

When I was a young man, I came across a reclusive individual who could build inimaginably perfect devices and materials, far beyond of what I had ever seen. I invested heavily on his business, and he eventually revealed to me the source of his craft... and the method which made it incomparable. It was a brutal place, where people were inhumanely butchered and coerced by inhumane beasts. And as their blood was spilled, the runes etched on the floor  ensured perfection to production. I studied them for years, until I conceived a new method of runic research, a much more efficient one than the barbarism that ruled that place. Mr. Anderson, however, the sadistic monster that he was, cared more for that suffering than anything else. When I revealed my new method to him, he... took great issue with it, prompting my escape from that heinous factory. Since then, as I once explained to the doctor, I continue my work into understanding the power of those runes, with the hope of preventing one madman's sadism from swallowing our world whole.

However, I am not inclined to transmit my knowledge to others, only to remain imprisoned while they wield a power of unbeknownst limitations. Not to mention the dificulties in conveying in simple terms the particularities of my work.

SCP-4586 was discovered on ██/██/20██, at ███████████, Pennsylvania. The local police department received a call from a man claiming to have trapped a “living skeleton” in his garage. According to him, he came home and found the skeleton hanging from his electric fence. Upon removing the skeleton and taking it to the garage for closer inspection, it began to autonomously move and grunt, to which the man responded by running inside and trapping SCP-4586 there. Agent ██████, embedded in the police force, notified the Foundation and SCP-4586 was recovered later that day. Class-A amnestics were administered to non-Foundation personnel involved and the incident was expunged from police records.

Additionally, Foundation agents were able to locate what appears to be an industrial "laboratory"  in an abandoned factory ██km from SCP-4586's recovery site. The following is a list of unique equipments recovered from such "laboratory", apparently built by SCP-4586. All recovered devices have a small button. When such buttons are left unactivated, devices operate in an indistinguishable manner to their normal counterparts. When activated, however, they are capable of exhibiting supernatural characteristics. In such conditions, small runes, etched on the devices, glow with a blue light:
> - A brass optical microscope; when its button is activated, it becomes capable of molecular-level observation;
> - A 19th century-clockwork refrigeration device; when its button is activated, the device is capable of refining any material in seconds;
> - A manual machine press; when its button is activated, any materials pressed are transformed into raw obsidian;
> - A steel Graham chemical condenser; when its button is activated, any liquid that goes through it becomes an unidentified blue liquid;
Several notes were recovered in the area, which Foundation researchers are currently attempting to decipher. Symbols, resembling the runes found on the devices, had also been written on the factory floor with chalk. Ongoing research is being done to determine their significance.

Upon SCP-4586's containment in Site-19, the subject was outfitted with a Mark III shock collar. However, on 05/04/20██, when attempting to summon the subject to a scheduled interview, the acting technician found the shock collar to be unresponsive. As per the specimen's standard containment protocol, two guards were dispatched to stun it. Once SCP-4586 was incapacitated, the shock collar was temporarily removed for examination, which revealed its circuitry to be mostly missing. The removed pieces were found within the subject's coat, crudely assembled. It appeared that SCP-4586 had disabled the collar and had been using its pieces to craft a device for unknown purposes, blocking the cell camera's line of sight with a notebook when it was working on it. As of this event, the supply of notebooks to the specimen has been halted until further notice. 
[[/collapsible]]
[[collapsible show="+ Addendum 4586-03: Observation Logs" hide="- Addendum 4586-03: Observation Logs"]]
Since its containment, SCP-4586 has made several requests to the Foundation, claiming to be "vital for the execution of its work":
> - A meeting with the "Leading researcher" -**DENIED**
> - Access to its recovered equipment-**DENIED**
> - Access to resources such as iron, silver, gold, obsidian, copper and lead  -**DENIED**
> - "Paper and a pen" -**GRANTED**; Blank notebooks and pens were provided; Subject's writings under surveillance; Currently revoked (See Addendum 4586-02)

Initially, SCP-4586 spent most of its time writing, stopping only during interviews, to consult its notebooks or to change its pen. Since the specimen had been granted this request, it had completely filled four notebooks with reports on the progress of its "work", mathematical equations and, sporadically, drawings of symbols of an unknown kind. As of 05/04/20██, SCP-4586 spends most of its days either pacing around in its cell or tapping in its walls as if in writing motion. Occasionally, SCP-4586 retrieves a brass pocket watch from its coat and glances at it briefly.
