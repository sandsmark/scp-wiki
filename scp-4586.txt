**Item #:** SCP-4586

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4586 is to be kept at Site-19, in a standard humanoid containment cell, connected to a 5 m corridor leading to the facility. A control room is to be built adjacent to the cell to monitor the specimen through a camera, placed in the cell. SCP-4586 is equipped with a Mark V shock collar, operated by technicians in the control room. Batteries must be exchanged every 72 hours, and any attempts of the subject to tamper with the collar must be met with an electric discharge to incapacitate it. Should SCP-4586 remove the collar, two guards, outfitted with electric guns and tasers, are to stun the specimen. In the event of a successful containment breach, the site is to be placed on lockdown and Mobile Task Force Lambda-5 ("White Rabbits") on-site team is to incapacitate and recontain SCP-4586. 

As per Project HEPHAESTUS directive, SCP-4586 is to be escorted on a daily basis to the site's research wing, where it is to work on SCP-related projects, in an assigned laboratory. During such period, the specimen is allowed to roam the laboratory unrestricted, with at least two guards supervising it. Requests made by SCP-4586 regarding its designated projects are to be submitted to the approval of the Site Director. In order to prevent containment breaches, all mechanical and electric devices employed by the subject must be accounted for before it is escorted back to its cell, as SCP-4586 is capable of anomalously modifying them to its needs.

**Description:** SCP-4586 is a mobile human skeleton 1.84 m in height and 50 kg in weight, wearing a 19th century-era suit, matching black shoes, black gloves, a top hat and a decorative wooden cane. Despite the lack of necessary organs, subject possesses visual and auditory capabilities similar to that of a normal person. While it is still unknown how the specimen is able to hear, tests have confirmed SCP-4586 is capable of seeing through its only eye, located on the left socket of its skull. Subject cannot see through its right eye and its respective socket and nose have been covered with a black material believed to be a polymer of unknown composition. Even though SCP-4586 is incapable of blinking, both the eye and the subject’s sight do not appear to be affected. Additionally, while it lacks both muscular tissues and an apparent nervous system, SCP-4586 can walk and run at average speeds. As of yet, no attempts of extracting samples from either SCP-4586's bones, the material in its eye socket or its functional eye have been successful. Subject is capable of enduring extreme temperatures, pressure and kinetic impact. However, while the entity is resistant to most types of damage, electric stun guns and tasers can temporarily incapacitate SCP-4586 (See Addendum 4586-01). 

    Subject is sentient and capable of engaging in both verbal and written communication in several languages, although it has shown a preference for English, and is usually formal in its speech. SCP-4586 is extremely intelligent (tests have shown it to have an IQ of 189) and is knowledgeable on several subjects, such as philosophy, mathematics and history. According to written and oral accounts from SCP-4586, its scientific knowledge ranges from that available during the 19th century to current times. The specimen is capable of building mechanical devices (sometimes with anomalous properties) with few resources available, employing an unknown crafting method. Subject claims to be well-versed in a scientific field of difficult comprehension, related to a "work" recurrently mentioned.

    SCP-4586 claims to be Dr. Robert Murthwallen, born in 1830 in █████████, New York. The entity is capable of providing a detailed biography of Dr. Murthwallen’s life. However, should it be questioned about certain events or details, SCP-4586 appears to purposely provide vague answers, and should it be pressed to reveal more, it either attempts to switch the topic at hand or it refuses to answer.  Records from the Murthwallen family reveal that Robert was a reclusive individual who dedicated much of his life and his family’s wealth to his scientific pursuits. In April of 1867, Dr. Murthwallen was reported missing, before he was presumed dead in June of that year. Neither Dr. Murthwallen’s body nor his burial grounds have ever been located.

> 
> **SCP-4586**: Of course, my dear sir. How do you fare?
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: I'm, uh, fine. SCP-4586, I'd like to ask you a couple of questions.
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Very well. How may I be of assistance? 
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: First of all, can you explain what you are?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: As far as I am aware, sir, I am a man. Well, perhaps... a unique specimen amongst others, as my flesh and blood have long expired. Still, a man nevertheless.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: A man, you say? Who are you?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: My name is Dr. Robert Arthur Murthwallen, good sir. I was born on September 19th, 1830, in █████████, New York.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: Okay then. So, your flesh and blood "expired". I take it that you died?
>  
> **SCP-4586**: As a matter of fact, sir, no. I removed them from my body.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: You removed- Why would you remove them?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: I found that, even in the most favorable outcome, I would not survive to see my work completed. Thus, I had no alternative but to alter my body to suit such needs.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: You… altered your body? How?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: I built a... machine that allowed me to safely conduct the transition. But I wouldn't want to bore you with tortuous and rather gruesome details, lest you become unnecessarily confused.  
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: No, I want to hear about it. What kind of machine was it? 
> 
> **SCP-4586**:  Good sir, I'm sure that there are better subjects than a relic of the past for science men like us to discuss. After all, the prog-

> **SCP-4586**: It was an insignificant device, sir.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: I'd like you to clarify about it. What components did you employ in its creation? 
> 
> **SCP-4586**: I would prefer not to speak of this subject.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: How long did it take for it to be built?
>

> **Date:** 13/02/20██

> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: SCP-4586, come in. 
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Well, hello, good sir! How have you fared in these past days? 
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: Fine, SCP-4586. Today, I'd like to-
> 
> **SCP-4586**: If I may speak with candor, doctor, I expected our interview to take place quite some time after the last one, considering what I believe to have been multiple tests since my incarceration.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: That's exactly the topic I want to discuss with you today, SCP-4586. We've analysed your, uh, skeleton, and we found it impossible to sample it. Now, in our last conversation, you said to have "altered your body" to serve a certain function. I suppose that this alteration process is responsible for that?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Precisely, sir. Were I to remain with my primitive endoskeleton, it would surely be a great detriment to the progress of my work. I had its composition altered to sustain most difficulties I could potentially encounter.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: With your machine, correct?
> 
> [SCP-4586 remained silent for three seconds]
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Yes, sir.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: What is it really, the compound on your skeleton?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: If you really must know, good doctor, it is a type of polymer that I have personally developed. While crafting it was more herculean that I had initially anticipated, I dare say that the results have far outweighted all exertions.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: And that black material in the other eye?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: The exact same compound, sir, in a highly concentrated state. A mere consequence of my transition.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: What about your other eye? What's it made of?
> 
>  **SCP-4586**: Oh, I do not believe, doctor, that such substance is not widely known to others. I myself had only managed to synthesize a meager amount. One could call it, I gather, an artificial matter, assembled in a synthetic organ, one to enable my sight once I had become what I am today.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: Why is it that you have only one eye, SCP-4586?
> 
> [SCP-4586 remained silent for five seconds]
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Well, sir, such is the mark of my initial carelessness. I once possessed the ability to see with both eyes, yet I was cursed from a young age to have the right one unable to properly view the world from a distance. Thus, I had always worn a monocle to circumvent this unfortunate issue. However, upon the commencement of my alteration process, I had forgotten about my machine's unacceptability of metallic devices. I was unable to remove it from the eye in time, which led to its destruction and of the monocle.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: You didn't think about... I don't know, replacing it? Building a new one?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Of course, good sir. Such enterprise, nonetheless, proves to be arduous, as the materials required to craft the required compound are of extreme scarcity. Notwithstanding, sir, not only has the lack of such eye proved completely useless in hindering my work, it is also a manner for me to remember what dire effects can one's haphazardness lead to when dealing with the unknown. 
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: I see. Well, SCP-4586, that'll be all for this interview.
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Certainly, doctor.
>  
> **<End Log>**
> 
>  **Closing Statement:** //SCP-4586 continues to sustain that it modified its body with unknown devices and substances, though it is still unclear how it allegedly did that. Further tests are to be scheduled to determine the specimen's physical endurance. Subject continues to refer to a supposed "work", but was also not specific on its nature.

> **Foreword:** As authorized by the Site Director, SCP-4586 has been given blank notebooks, and has been writing in them ever since.
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: Alright, SCP-4586. Can you hear me in there?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Yes, I can, good doctor! It has been a long while since we have had our last conversation. 
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: Indeed it has. Though I see that you've been busy, writing on these notebooks we've given you.
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Yes, sir, indeed. While you have shown to be almost entirely incomplient with my requests, I must make do with the resources I have at my disposal. After all, I would rather carry on with my work than to remain idle in this cell.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: I see. SCP-4586, since we last spoke, you have requested access to several materials. When you did so, you claimed that they're vital to your work. What is this work, exactly? 
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Well, sir, such is a subject I am not accustomed of conversing with others about, especially because of its incomparable nature. Nevertheless, I believe the most precise analogy to the answer of this question would be to mend a wound.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: To "mend a wound"? How so?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Firstly, sir, one would need to know of the existence of multiple planes of reality in our universe.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: Planes of reality... as in different dimensions?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Indeed, sir. While they are to remain parallel, however, one of these planes has managed to coincide with ours. Its elements, thus, bleed into our world, and affect it accordingly.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: What sort of elements?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Forgive me, sir, but I cannot explain satisfactorily what they are, especially without proper means. However, I believe one such as yourself could observe them in certain rare objects.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: What kind of objects, SCP-4586?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Objects, doctor, that are not what they seem. Most resemble ordinary items, yet they possess... anomalous proprieties. Some are unique, with no respective versions of themselves to be commonly found. Still, all of these devices were forged, with those elements as its prime material. Their anomalous behavior is not the product of chance, but of careful engineering, sir.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: And how is all this related to your "work"?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: The purpose, and the means with which those objects were created, sir, are vile. As long as the two planes of reality continue to intersect, they will continue to be made. Thus, my work consists of studying the elements of this new dimension and reversing their effects. And if you and your fellow companions were to assist me in such endeavour, we would be certain to make significant progress.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: I'm afraid that's not happening, SCP-4586.
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Well, that is unfortunate. Is there anything else I could be of service to you, my good sir?
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: No, SCP-4586. That will be all for today.
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** //SCP-4586 appears to have a certain familiarity with what appear to be SCPs. Additionally, unlike in the past interview, the specimen has revealed information about its purpose, although it has remained elusive and vague about its details//. -Dr. Coulter

> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: SCP-4586, come in.
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Hello, doctor! How are you today, sir?
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: SCP-4586, I'd like to discuss your attempted containment breach. You managed to disable your shock collar and were using the pieces to build something. I'd like to know what your objective was.
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Good doctor, speaking with full sincerity, I truly aimed to escape this facility and direct myself somewhere I could continue my work uninterrupted. It has been quite some time since it has yielded pragmatic results, and I would __certainly__ not wish it to linger more than it already has.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: Is that why you created that device we recovered?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Yes, sir. While I had not yet found a way to imperceptibly remove its power cell to fuel my machine, it could have assuredly propitiated my flight from this cell.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: This device you were creating, what was it, exactly?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Nothing special, sir. In elementar terms, I believe you could consider it a lockpick of sorts.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: So you've lost your notebooks, the progress of your work over something that wasn't special?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Oh, sir, you misunderstand the value I attribute to them. I merely used them a method of organising my theories and propositions during this incarceration period, as I memorise most of the information regarding my work. All positives aside, I would have preferred to retain them.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: Well, we will taking a better look at them now, SCP-4586.
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Yes, I would assume as much, doctor. Nevertheless, I am not one of great expectations concerning the results from its analysis, due to its uniqueness.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: What makes you think we won't be able to ever understand this work of yours, SCP-4586?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Sir, if I may trouble you for a lamentable comparison, you and your fellow researchers remind me of my father. He was the proprietor of great wealth, yet he did not employ it for anything else other than the achievement of more wealth or mere luxuries. It proved to be quite a challenge to convince him to assist me with my scientific projects, as he did not possess the farsightness necessary to comprehend them. I, on the other hand, understand my work, have the necessary temperance, and, with the right conditions, could accomplish it much faster than at this rate.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: Well, unfortunately, that option is unavailable to you, SCP-4586.
> 
> **SCP-4586**: I urge you gentlemen to reconsider my request! The intent of my work is not detrimental to anyone whatsoever! It is not as if I am an uncontrollable maniac as-

>

> 
> **Agent ████████**: SCP-4586, we'd like to discuss about your operations in your "laboratory". Let's start with the devices we recovered. How were you able to make those things?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: It was a combination of scientific knowledge and my extradimensional expertise, sir. 
> 
> **Agent ████████**: We would like to know where you acquired this knowledge, SCP-4586.

> **SCP-4586**: Well, sir, it is a rather long story, how I came to be what I am, and I would certainly not like to waste time in such purposeless endeavour.

> 
> **SCP-4586**: Still, if only so that a modicum of civility is mantained, I shall satiate your thirst for information. When I was a young man, I came across a reclusive individual who could build inimaginably perfect devices and materials, far beyond of what I had ever seen. I invested heavily on his business, and he eventually revealed to me the source of his craft... and the method which made it incomparable. It was a brutal place, where people were inhumanely butchered and coerced by inhumane beasts. And as their blood was spilled, the runes etched on the floor  ensured perfection to production. I studied them for years, until I conceived a new method of runic research, a much more efficient one than the barbarism that ruled that place. Mr. Anderson, however, the sadistic monster that he was, cared more for that suffering than anything else. When I revealed my new method to him, he... took great issue with it, prompting my escape from that heinous factory. Since then, as I once explained to the doctor, I continue my work into understanding the power of those runes, with the hope of preventing one madman's sadism from swallowing our world whole.

> **SCP-4586**: Well, sir, with the resources available at the time, I was able to progress more than ever, but I made few discoveries. I estimate completion is still far.
> 
> **Agent ████████**: Very well. SCP-4586, we've been analysing your notebooks, but we haven't been able to fully understand them yet. We'd like you to translate them to a more... tangible language, so we can understand your work more precisely.
> 
> **SCP-4586**: It would be of my utmost pleasure working with the Foundation to finish my research, sir. However, I am not inclined to transmit my knowledge to others, only to remain imprisoned while they wield a power of unbeknownst limitations. Not to mention the dificulties in conveying in simple terms the particularities of my work.

> 
> **SCP-4586**: Time, sir, is not a commodity that the world has in store to so lavishly spend. If a game of patience is what it is willing to defeat me with, then it is one it has already lost. Should my work fail to be completed, sir, then all is doomed.

> **SCP-4586**: Hello, good doctor! Why, it has been quite some time since we last conversed. I trust you have fared well in this period of absence?
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: I have, yes. SCP-4586, I'd like to ask you about the operation you were sent on a few weeks ago. What can you tell us about the construct you were able to analyse?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Oh, yes, sir, it was a fascinating device! I had thought its craft was much more limited than the one I was able to observe, although such would be the expected result, since its maker's progress has apparently been unhampered. Despite the unfortunate events that transpired after my arrival, I thought to have been able to register a rather extensive, albeit incomplete, amount of information concerning the Runic Decoder.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: Yes, we've received your notes from Camp Epsilon, SCP-4586. However, much like your impounded notebooks, we're still working on understanding them. We were hoping you could shed a light on the device we found there.
>  
> **SCP-4586**: Of course, good doctor. In simple terms, the purpose of the device is to refine interdimensional elements and direct them towards a desired function.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: I see. These elements, are they the ones you mentioned in one of our past interviews?  
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Not exactly, sir. The elements I spoke of are analogous to crude matter, improper for more exquisite uses. Those produced by a Runic Decoder, however, are pure in their essence, capable of altering objects in an unfathomable scale. 
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: And how does the device create these elements?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Oh, doctor, the Decoder does not craft them on its own. The elements are extracted through the use of runes.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: Runes, SCP-4586?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Yes, sir. Whenever they are submitted to appropriate stimuli, such runes are capable of directly harnessing the elements from their plane of reality.  
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: How are these runes capable of doing that?
> 
> [SCP-4586 remained silent for three seconds]
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Well, doctor... the intricacies of such process are quite sophisticated. A satisfactory answer to your question requires many hours to be properly explained, quite possibly more than our discussion would be allowed to continue. However, good sir, I believe there is an alternative approach to this matter, capable of circumventing such difficulty.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: Oh? And what is that?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: I would wish to personally assist you and your colleagues in comprehending my notes. I am quite certain that such cooperation would allow you to obtain some understanding not only of the manner which the runes function, but of my work as a whole. Even if only its menial details are all that is learned, your enlightment on such subject would make for more auspicious discussions.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: I thought that this matter had already been resolved, SCP-4586. We're not letting you out of there.
> 
> **SCP-4586**: Oh, doctor, I beg to differ. The last occasion your colleagues spoke to me, I was under the impression they were quite interested in understanding my work. You yourself have admitted that confusion still permeates the minds of those who currently possess my notes. And fret not, for I do not aim to jeopardize such a wonderful opportunity by prematuraly attempting to escape, as the products of such cooperation are astonishingly propitious for the both of us.
> 
> **Dr. Coulter**: That is... quite a different behaviour than you had displayed in our previous conversation. What changed?
> 
> **SCP-4586**: If I may be entirely honest, doctor, recent events have provided me with a new perspective of current circumstances. Collaboration, even if not ideal, is perhaps a more suitable alternative than this taciturn confinement, sir.

Despite the difference between the runes present in the subject's notebooks and the ones described in the notes taken at Camp Epsilon, it appears that such is the source of the power behind the Factory-related facilities. However, despite clearly understanding the mechanisms responsible for the harnessing of such power, SCP-4586 has claimed it to be of difficult comprehension//.
> 
> //SCP-4586 is apparently more willing to assist the Foundation with understanding its unknown scientific field of mastery than before. For that reason, I would like to request that my team and I are allowed to conduct a "trial run" with the specimen in order to determine how the entity is capable of crafting devices that are essentially SCPs themselves//. -Dr. Coulter

SCP-4586 was discovered on ██/██/20██, at ███████████, Pennsylvania. The local police department received a call from a man claiming to have trapped a “living skeleton” in his garage. According to him, he came home and found the skeleton hanging from his electric fence. Upon removing the skeleton and taking it to the garage for closer inspection, it began to autonomously move and grunt, to which the man responded by running inside and trapping SCP-4586 there. Agent ██████, embedded in the police force, notified the Foundation and SCP-4586 was recovered later that day. Class-A amnestics were administered to non-Foundation personnel involved and the incident was expunged from police records.

Additionally, Foundation agents were able to locate what appears to be an industrial "laboratory" in an abandoned factory ██ km from SCP-4586's recovery site. The following is a list of unique equipment recovered from said "laboratory", apparently built by SCP-4586. All recovered devices have a small button. When these buttons are left unactivated, devices operate in an indistinguishable manner to their normal counterparts. When activated, however, they are capable of exhibiting supernatural characteristics. In such conditions, small runes etched on each device glow with a blue light:
> - A brass optical microscope; when its button is activated, it becomes capable of molecular-level observation;
> - A 19th century-clockwork refrigeration device; when its button is activated, the device is capable of refining any material in seconds;
> - A manual machine press; when its button is activated, any materials pressed are transformed into raw obsidian;
> - A steel Graham chemical condenser; when its button is activated, any liquid that goes through it becomes an unidentified blue liquid. 
Several notes were recovered in the area, which Foundation researchers are currently attempting to decipher. Symbols, resembling the runes found on the devices, had also been written on the factory floor with chalk. Research is ongoing to determine their significance.

Upon SCP-4586's containment in Site-19, the subject was outfitted with a Mark III shock collar. However, on 05/04/20██, when attempting to summon the subject to a scheduled interview, the acting technician found the shock collar to be unresponsive. As per the specimen's standard containment protocol, two guards were dispatched to stun it. Once SCP-4586 was incapacitated, the shock collar was temporarily removed for examination, which revealed its circuitry to be mostly missing. The removed pieces were found within the subject's coat, crudely assembled. It appeared that SCP-4586 had disabled the collar and had been using its pieces to craft a device for unknown purposes, blocking the cell camera's line of sight with a notebook when it was working on it. As of this event, the supply of notebooks to the specimen has been halted until further notice.

[[collapsible show="+ Addendum 4586-03: Observation Logs" hide="- Addendum 4586-03: Observation Logs"]]
Since its containment, SCP-4586 has made several requests to the Foundation, claiming each request to be "vital for the execution of its work":
> - A meeting with the "Leading researcher" -**DENIED**
> - Access to its recovered equipment -**DENIED**
> - Access to resources such as iron, silver, gold, obsidian, copper and lead  -**DENIED**
> - "Paper and a pen" -**GRANTED**; Blank notebooks and pens were provided; Subject's writings under surveillance; Currently revoked (See Addendum 4586-02)

Initially, SCP-4586 spent most of its time writing, stopping only during interviews, to consult its notebooks or to change its pen. Since the specimen had been granted this request, it had completely filled four notebooks with reports on the progress of its "work", mathematical equations and, sporadically, drawings of symbols of an unknown kind. As of 05/04/20██, SCP-4586 spends most of its days either pacing the cell or tapping the walls as if in writing motion. Occasionally, SCP-4586 retrieves a brass pocket watch from its coat and glances at it briefly.

[[collapsible show="+ Addendum 4586-04: Experiment 4586-Alpha" hide="- Addendum 4586-04: Experiment 4586-Alpha"]]
> 
> **Date**: 27/12/20██
> 
> **Foreword**: In order to empirically analyse SCP-4586's unique understanding of Factory-related items, Experiment 4586-Alpha was devised by Dr. Albert Coulter, supervised by the Site Director and a representative of O5-██. Said experiment consists of the disassembling of all the components comprising [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1106 SCP-1106].
> 
> **Procedure**: Specimen is to be stunned and escorted to Research Wing A, Laboratory 12; once the subject regains mobility, it is to dismantle SCP-1106 in its entirety with the provided tools, describing both the process and the internal structure of the device as precisely as possible (sheets of paper, audio and video recording devices are to be arranged); should the specimen succeed in dismantling SCP-1106, it is to reassemble the device, which is to be later tested to assess its status; at the completion of the test, SCP-4586 is to be escorted back to its cell.
> **Note**: SCP-4586 was informed of the test procedure beforehand, which led the subject to request that several additional resources were made available during the test, claiming such would lead to a "more uneventful transpiration of events"; the requested resources were as it follows: a 3-kilogram block of obsidian, a 200 g 24K gold bar, a 70 g copper wire coil and two one-kilogram iron bars.
> 
> **Results:** Initially, SCP-4586 employed the provided tools and the additional resources to craft an anomalous device resembling a crude scalpel, comprised of obsidian and gold pieces, strung together by copper wires. The specimen then dismantled an electronic calculator and used its batteries to make the tip of its newly-crafted scalpel glow with a blue light. SCP-4586 proceeded to draw a quadrilateral figure on SCP-1106's surface. Upon completing it, the subject removed the figure with its hands, revealing SCP-1106's internal composition, pointing out the "heedlessness in its design" and the "irregular, albeit perilous results" expected from using the device. SCP-4586 proceeded to remove similar portions of different measures from other parts of SCP-1106's surface, making several written and verbal notes during the process. Upon removing six pieces of SCP-1106, the specimen placed its obsidian tool away, claiming that further intrusions were likely to make SCP-1106 inoperable. After being instructed to repair SCP-1106 to its orginal state, SCP-4586 proceeded to press the tip of its obsidian device on a provided iron bar. The specimen then placed the removed pieces of the device back on their original positions, using its crafted tool to apparently weld them onto SCP-1106. SCP-4586 was then ordered away from the device, stunned and returned to its cell. Further testing of the instance of SCP-1106 employed in the experiment confirmed its functionality, as well as the inexistence of any indication that the device had been previously dismantled. The obsidian tool crafted by SCP-4586 was impounded and submitted for further analysis.
> 
> **Analysis:** Experiment 4586-Alpha produced controversial results. SCP-1106 was not entirely dismantled, but the incisions done by SCP-4586 enabled the viewing of the internal structure of the device. SCP-4586 demonstrated its ability to craft an anomalous tool with unrelated resources, although Foundation personnel have not been able to replicate the obsidian "scalpel" on their own. Additionally, the specimen produced several notes regarding SCP-1106 internal composition and functionality. However, their content is predominantly incomprehensible, despite the subject being ordered otherwise. Decryption of said notes is to be carried out alongside the previously recovered writings of SCP-4586 in order to clarify the specimen's unique scientific field.

[[collapsible show="+ Addendum 4586-05: Project HEPHAESTUS" hide="- Addendum 4586-05: Project HEPHAESTUS"]]
Following Experiment 4586-Alpha, by order of the O5 Council, Special Project HEPHAESTUS was comissioned. The goal of Project HEPHAESTUS is the reverse-engineering of Factory-related SCPs with the intent of comprehending the origin of their anomalous proprieties and the utilization of such knowledge to locate and better contain related specimens. SCP-4586, the primary asset involved, has thus been reclassified as **Thaumiel**, and new security measures have been devised to ensure the secrecy and continuation of Project HEPHAESTUS. The subject has been authorized to work with Foundation researchers in Site-19, in a controlled environment. 

The following is a list of all experiments involving interactions of SCP-4586 with other anomalous objects performed to date:

__**Test A -  03/01/20██**__
> 
> **Object Analysed:**  An instance of [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-133 SCP-133].
> 
> **Procedure:** SCP-4586 is to analyse and explain SCP-133's anomalous effect using both provided tools and any equipments it can craft to complete the assigned task. The subject is to be previously briefed on SCP-133. Personnel involved: Dr. Albert Coulter, Dr. Uriel Dönner and Dr. James Schofield.
> 
> **Additional Resources Requested:** A 20 cm X 30 cm steel sheet 1.5 cm thick; 250 mL of water; a bowl comprised entirely of obsidian; a 100 g 24K gold bar; the device crafted during Experiment 4586-Alpha (the specimen requested it as "the Pencil"); the anomalous Graham chemical condenser and the brass microscope built by the subject (See Addendum 4586-01).
> 
> **Results:** SCP-4586 placed the anomalous condenser on the provided recipient, pressed the button and poured the water on the entry chamber, filling the bowl with an unidentified blue liquid. The specimen then inserted the gold bar into the bowl, stiring it with the "Pencil". Three minutes later, SCP-4586 poured the blue liquid on the center of the metal sheet, spreading it with a provided spatula. Approximately twenty seconds after its placement, the liquid was seemingly absorbed by the sheet, with no alteration of its appearance. SCP-4586 then placed and pressed the instance of SCP-133 onto the sheet, leading to its fixture, but not the expected manifestation of SCP-133's anomalous effects. SCP-4586 then proceeded to remove a small portion of SCP-133's surface with the "Pencil" and placed it on the anomalous microscope. Upon examining the removed sample for seven minutes, SCP-4586 began to speak with the researchers about its compostion and likely method of construction. The specimen also wrote 51 pages regarding SCP-133 on the provided notebook, claiming such to be a "crude, but sufficiently elementary summarization" of the device. Once the experiment was deemed finished, SCP-4586 allowed itself to be stunned by Foundation personnel and returned to its cell.
> 
> **HEPHAESTUS Information:** SCP-4586 described SCP-133 to the researchers as a construct of the Factory likely built by the use of the "Mukha'sil" rune. The subject outlined how the dispersal of runic energy alongside the circular edge of the device revealed it as a "product of engineering". However, the specimen comented on how such engineering was imperfect, as the correct employment of the aforementioned rune would ensure the complete penetration of any length and matter that SCP-133 were inserted upon. The written notes made by SCP-4586 reference the "Mukha'sil" rune in certain points, although the subject did not provide its visual representation. Subject's notes submitted for further analysis.

__**Test B -  10/01/20██**__
> 
> **Object Analysed:** An instance of [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-750 SCP-750].
> 
> **Procedure:**  SCP-4586 is to analyse and explain SCP-750's anomalous effect using both provided tools and any equipments it can craft to complete the assigned task. The subject is to be previously briefed on SCP-750. Personnel involved: Dr. Albert Coulter and Dr. James Schofield.
> 
> **Additional Resources Requested:** A 500 g obsidian block; a 10 g 24K gold bar; the anomalous Graham chemical condenser and the brass microscope built by the subject; 50 mL of water; the "Pencil"; a 30 g copper wire coil; 4.19 cm^^3^^ sphere made of steel and a pedestal to "hold it in its place"; a 1 kg aluminum bar.
> 
> **Results:** SCP-4586 began the experiment by using obsidian and gold pieces to etch a small symbol resembling the greek letter Ω (Omega) with four intercepting diagonal lines on the aluminum bar with the "Pencil". The specimen then proceeded to fill the condenser with the provided water to produce the unidentified blue liquid, which it then poured on the carved symbol, filling it in its entirety. SCP-4586 then cut and attached three copper wire strands to the aluminum bar and the bottom of the sphere, on the provided pedestal. The specimen then retrieved the instance of SCP-750 from its case and placed it on top of the metal sphere, shortly before using the "Pencil" to touch the center of the carved obsidian symbol (the entity referred to it as a "process of stimulation"). Immediately after SCP-4586 carried out such action, the instance of SCP-750 firmly attached itself to the metal sphere. Fifteen seconds later, both the sphere and part of the pedestal began to metamorphize into a black, viscous substance. SCP-4586 then cut the copper wires, which led the instance of SCP-750 to detach itself from the remains of the metal sphere. SCP-4586 placed a small sample of the produced black substance on the microscope and examined it for three minutes. The specimen then proceeded to discuss with the Foundation researchers about SCP-750 and the black compound created during the experiment. SCP-4586 also wrote 63 pages regarding SCP-750 on the notebooks provided. 
> 
> **HEPHAESTUS Information:** SCP-4586 described SCP-750 as an excellent example of a phenomenom named "interdimensional corruption". While the specimen was neither brief nor straightforward in its explanation, the phenomenom apparently occurs when matter is directly exposed to interdimensional elements, leading to the eventual breakdown of the physical state of the former and its full conversion into the latter. SCP-4586 outlined that certain procedures, however, could allow one to manipulate these elements and employ the "corruption" to their needs. The entity also argued that SCP-750 is "an artifact of brute constitution and imperfect manufacture", as the corruptive effect during its active state leads to the rapid degeneration of the involved subject, evidenced by the black substance produced in the experiment. SCP-4586 was not capable of determining if this degeneration is a side effect of the improper production of SCP-750 or if such is deliberate. Finally, the specimen's notes mention runes and mechanical devices that can be used to produce instances of SCP-750, though much of the details remain unknown due to SCP-4586's use of unknown terminology and seemingly incomprehensible logic. Subject's notes submitted for further analysis.

__**Test C -  24/01/20██**__
> 
> **Object Analysed:** An instance of [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1317 SCP-1317]. 
> 
> **Procedure:** SCP-4586 is to analyse and explain SCP-1317's anomalous effect using both provided tools and any equipments it can craft to complete the assigned task. The subject is to be previously briefed on SCP-1317. Hazmat suits are to be provided for both SCP-4586 and all Foundation researchers involved in the experiment. Personnel involved: Dr. Albert Coulter, Dr. Uriel Dönner and Dr. James Schofield.
> 
> **Additional Resources Requested:** The anomalous brass microscope built by SCP-4586 and the "Pencil".
> 
> **Results:** SCP-4586 opened SCP-1317's container and placed a sample of the anomalous substance on a glass slide for viewing it on the microscope. Eight minutes after analysing it, SCP-4586 removed the blade from the microscope, removed the cover slip and pressed the glowing tip of the "Pencil" onto the sample of SCP-1317. The sample then immediately combusted, acquiring a similar appearance of that of an ember. Approximately three minutes after its combustion, the sample returned to its previous state. Upon the conclusion of said process, SCP-4586 began to discuss the experiment with the research personnel. The subject also used twelve pages of a provided notebook to record its observations concerning SCP-1317.
> 
> **HEPHAESTUS Information:** SCP-4586 claimed that it had previously encountered SCP-1317, although not as it is in its current state. The specimen outlined, both while discussing with Foundation personnel and on its notes, that the sample resembled a substance produced by devices which employ runic energy to craft anomalous products. SCP-4586 explained that the constant attrition between interdimentsional elements and physical matter periodically produces a seemingly useless material, referred in the specimen's writings as "ferrous dust". Subject described such material as extremely harmful for humans, as its exposure to unprotected segments of living tissue lead to their progressive conversion into a stone-like, grey compound. SCP-4586 claimed that while the removal of limbs or fingers contaminated by "ferrous dust" may lead to the halting of its spread, a hypothetical contamination of organs is irreversible. The specimen theorized that SCP-1317 is an industrially engineered variation of "ferrous dust", due to the similarity of the molecular structures of both substances and the reduced emission of energy upon SCP-1317's combustion. However, the subject claimed that SCP-1317 appears to be incomplete, as, in the specimen's own words, "the runic energy dispersed in this substance is acutely chaotic, with its reasons either being the attempt to direct the runic energy for unknown purposes or as a deliberate endeavour to maximize certain degenerative aspects of ferrous dust". When questioned as to what process and runes could have led to the creation of SCP-1317, SCP-4586 stated that it would be difficult to produce a definite answer, due to the substance's own erratic composition. Subject's notes submitted for further analysis.
