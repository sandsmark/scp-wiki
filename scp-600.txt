title:SCP-600
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-600 is contained in a Class-E suite in Site 17, dimensions 15m x 15m x 3m. Two (2) security cameras monitor the subject at all times.  A standard steel door with a reinforced double-paned window  secures the suite. No special procedures are required for entering or exiting the suite, with the caveat that SCP-600 has a tendency to attempt following researchers out of containment. A simple reprimand and order to return to containment has proved sufficient to curtail this behavior.

**Description:** SCP-600 is a humanoid entity, approximately 1.7 meters tall, with a build approximating an adult human male of average weight for its height. The subject is generally featureless, lacking facial features, external ears, nails, body hair, genitalia, or an anus. Full-body scans have show SCP-600 to have no internal structures of any kind, instead being formed from an unknown material of uniform density approximating that of human muscle tissue. The subject's age has not been determined.

SCP-600 possesses a crude telepathic ability which affects all humans who view it, causing to take on their personal superficial characteristics. This effect only alters the visual perception of affected persons, and SCP-600's actual form can still be detected by cameras, sensors, and touch. The perceived resemblance between SCP-600 and an affected viewer is general and superficial; no viewers have found it to be notable or uncanny in any way. Characteristics imitated by the subject include, but are not limited to, hair color, skin color, eye color, approximate age, clothing style, and general physique. (Note that clothing imitated by SCP-600 is entirely illusory.) Animal tests reveal that non-human organisms appear not to perceive the subject unless they physically collide with it.

When humans are present, SCP-600 will attempt to engage in conversation. Its conversational repertoire is limited; it will discuss trivialities such as weather and other "small talk", or attempt to commiserate with those present about professional matters as if it were similarly employed. Such discussions are superficial, filled with jargon appropriate to the person's area of expertise but consisting largely of obvious statements and platitudes. Attempts at more substantial discussion are deflected, and SCP-600 displays no deep domain knowledge of any field of employment. 

The subject is generally cooperative with requests from researchers but displays an unsettling tendency to refer to itself in the third person around researchers assigned to it, frequently referring to "the SCP-600 case". It has requested that researchers refer to it as "George," but is not upset by refusal to do so.

When not in the presence of humans, SCP-600 is generally inactive, standing in a single pose for hours or even days at a time without any apparent reaction to outside stimulus. It reacts to pain normally, though no means have been found to cut or otherwise break its epidermis. It is self-sustaining; it neither ingests, respirates, or excretes waste, having no mechanisms to do so.
