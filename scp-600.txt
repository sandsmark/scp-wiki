**Item #:** SCP-600

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-600 is contained in a Class-E suite in Site 17, dimensions 15m x 15m x 3m. Four (4) security cameras monitor the subject at all times. An iron door (2.2m x 0.8m x 2cm) is located on the northern wall, and a microphone hooked up to the observation room is located on the eastern wall directly below a speaker. Requests made by or concerning SCP-600 are to always be approved by at least one (1) member of the Ethics Committee unaffected by SCP-600. Access to the containment chamber is prohibited to all personnel except under circumstances deemed appropriate by Site Director Kondraki.

**Description:** SCP-600 is a humanoid entity, with a height of approximately 1.7 meters and a weight of 54.4 kg. Subject is lean and featureless. X-rays and MRI scans have shown SCP-600 to have no internal structure of any form, and is composed entirely of an unknown compound similar to [DATA EXPUNGED]. Age is unknown. SCP-600 has a direct memetic effect on all people who view it, causing it to reflect their personal superficial characteristics. This effect is purely psychological in nature, and SCP-600 can be viewed effectively through use of three-dimensional imaging and physical contact. Pictures and video of the subject have the same memetic effect. Characteristics carried over from the viewer to SCP-600 include, but are not limited to hair color, skin color, eye color, approximate age, clothing (note that SCP-600 in actuality remains nude at all times), and height. It is thought that SCP-600 affects animals as well, due to numerous experiments finding that non-sentient organisms treat the subject as if it were a member of their species.

The personality of SCP-600 is constant, despite the viewer. However, some people may hold differing sentiments towards SCP-600's actions and view them in separate lights. Affected personnel have described the subject as "nice", "helpful", "cool", and "chill." Despite the lack of a mouth, SCP-600 appears to speak normally. This voice carries with it the aforementioned memetic property. It is theorized that the subject's personality itself is not mind-affecting in nature, and it is simply an amicable entity.

The subject ages normally and reacts to injury as would be expected for a healthy, young human. SCP-600 does not need to eat, drink, or excrete waste, as it has no mechanisms to do so. The subject is fully self-sustaining. Aside from these properties, SCP-600 is not anomalous.

No external intervention is necessary for the subject to continue living in its containment unit. However, SCP-600 is fully vulnerable to physical injury and sustains them in a normal fashion. Further research into SCP-600 is ongoing.
