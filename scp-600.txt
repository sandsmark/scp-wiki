title:SCP-600
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-600 is contained in a Class-E suite in Site 17, dimensions 15m x 15m x 3m. Two (2) security cameras monitor the subject at all times.  A standard steel door with a reinforced double-paned window  secures the suite. No special procedures are required for entering or exiting the suite, with the caveat that SCP-600 has a tendency to attempt following researchers out of containment. A simple reprimand and order to return to containment has proved sufficient to curtail this behavior.

**Description:** SCP-600 is a humanoid entity, approximately 1.7 meters tall, with a build approximating an adult human male of average weight for its height. The subject is generally featureless, lacking facial features, external ears, nails, body hair, genitalia, or an anus. Full-body scans have show SCP-600 to have no internal structures of any kind, instead being formed from an unknown material of uniform density approximating that of human muscle tissue. The subject's age has not been determined.

SCP-600 possesses a crude telepathic ability which affects all humans who view it, causing to take on their personal superficial characteristics. This effect only alters the visual perception of affected persons, and SCP-600's actual form can still be detected by cameras, sensors, and touch. The perceived resemblance between SCP-600 and an affected viewer is general and superficial; no viewers have found it to be notable or uncanny in any way. Characteristics imitated by the subject include, but are not limited to, hair color, skin color, eye color, approximate age, clothing style, and general physique. (Note that clothing imitated by SCP-600 is entirely illusory.) Animal tests reveal that non-human organisms appear not to perceive the subject unless they physically collide with it.

The personality of SCP-600 is constant, despite the viewer. However, some people may hold differing sentiments towards SCP-600's actions and view them in separate lights. Affected personnel have described the subject as "nice", "helpful", "cool", and "chill." Despite the lack of a mouth, SCP-600 appears to speak normally. Hearing the subject carries with it the property as viewing it. It is theorized that the subject's personality itself is not mind-affecting in nature, and it is simply an amicable entity.

The subject ages normally and reacts to injury as would be expected for a healthy, young human. SCP-600 does not need to eat, drink, or excrete waste, as it has no mechanisms to do so. The subject is fully self-sustaining. Aside from these properties, SCP-600 is not anomalous.

An iron door (2.2m x 0.8m x 2cm) is located on the northern wall, and a microphone hooked up to the observation room is located on the eastern wall directly below a speaker. Access to the containment chamber is free to personnel with a Level 2 Clearance.

SCP-600 appears to be mid-forties, with very few gray hairs. The subject is always wearing a white collared shirt and khaki pants.

> SCP-600 does not require nourishment in order to fulfill its caloric requirements. In addition, no waste is excreted from the subject. No external intervention is necessary for the subject to continue living in its containment unit. However, SCP-600 is fully vulnerable to physical injury and sustains them in a normal fashion. Further research into SCP-600 is ongoing.
