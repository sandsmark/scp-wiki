**Item #:** SCP-600

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-600 is contained in a Class-E suite in Site 17, dimensions 15m x 15m x 3m. Four (4) security cameras monitor the subject at all times. An iron door (2.2m x 0.8m x 2cm) is located on the northern wall, and a microphone hooked up to the observation room is located on the eastern wall directly below a speaker. Requests made by or concerning SCP-600 are to always be approved by at least one (1) member of the Ethics Committee unaffected by SCP-600. Access to the containment chamber is prohibited to all personnel except under circumstances deemed appropriate by Site Director Kondraki.

**Description:** SCP-600 is a humanoid entity, with a height of approximately 1.7 meters and a weight of 54.4 kg. Subject is lean and featureless. X-rays and MRI scans have shown SCP-600 to have no internal structure of any form, and is composed entirely of an unknown compound similar to [DATA EXPUNGED]. Age is unknown. SCP-600 has a direct mental effect on all people who view it, causing it to reflect their personal superficial characteristics. This effect is purely psychological in nature, and SCP-600 can be viewed effectively through use of three-dimensional imaging and physical contact. Pictures and video of the subject have the same effect. Characteristics carried over from the viewer to SCP-600 include, but are not limited to hair color, skin color, eye color, approximate age, clothing (note that SCP-600 in actuality remains nude at all times), and height. It is thought that SCP-600 affects animals as well, due to numerous experiments finding that non-sentient organisms treat the subject as if it were a member of their species.

The personality of SCP-600 is constant, despite the viewer. However, some people may hold differing sentiments towards SCP-600's actions and view them in separate lights. Affected personnel have described the subject as "annoying", "obnoxious", and "grating." Despite the lack of a mouth, SCP-600 appears to speak normally. Hearing the subject carries with it the property as viewing it. It is theorized that the subject's personality itself is not mind-affecting in nature, and associated behavior of personnel working on SCP-600 does not carry with it any anomalous properties. SCP-600 has requested to be referred to as "George."

The subject ages normally and reacts to injury as would be expected for a healthy, young human. SCP-600 does not need to eat, drink, or excrete waste, as it has no mechanisms to do so. The subject is fully self-sustaining. Aside from these properties, SCP-600 is not anomalous.

> **Description:** SCP-600 is a Hispanic male, standing at a height of approximately 2.1 meters and weighing 79 kg. Subject is skinny and generally weak. It has black hair and hazel eyes. SCP-600 appears to be early-forties, with very few gray hairs. The subject is always wearing a white collared shirt and khaki pants.
> 
> SCP-600 does not require nourishment in order to fulfill its caloric requirements. In addition, no waste is excreted from the subject. No external intervention is necessary for the subject to continue living in its containment unit. However, SCP-600 is fully vulnerable to physical injury and sustains them in a normal fashion.
> 
> The subject's personality has been described as "deterring" by many of the personnel involved with SCP-600. However, due to the relatively short span of time in which these opinions have been formed, they are of little note. Dr. ██████ has shown the least resentment towards the subject. Further research into SCP-600 is ongoing.
