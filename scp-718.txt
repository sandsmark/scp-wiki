title:Scp 718
**Item #:** SCP-718

**Object Class:** Keter 

**Special Containment Procedures:** 

No long-term observation is to be made of SPC-718. Any and all observation and interaction is to be restricted to five and ten minute periods, with personnel rotations every twenty four hours. Extreme care must be taken with SPC-718, and full Haz-Mat suits are strongly advised. Any damage done to SPC-718 must be reported as soon as possible. 

Any personnel observing or interacting with SPC-718 for longer than the advised period must be removed, with force if necessary. Any personnel acting in a erratic or violent manner will be transfered. 

**Description:** 

SCP-718 is an eye, roughly the size of a baseball. It is supported by a long, thin stalk made of tendon and blood vessels. It stands four feet tall, and appears to need no nourishment, nor excrete any waste. The eye will turn and follow any living thing in its field of vision. The stalk is capable of limited movement, and will follow living things for a short distance. SPC-718 will also stare at any observational equipment in its containment area if no living things are present. SPC-718 appears to prefer staring at humans more than other animals. 

SCP-718's stare can cause discomfort and paranoia after a very short time, often resulting in the subject's attempts to destroy SPC-718. The eye, if damaged, will explode, showing clear fluid on all substances in place before shriveling into powder. Anything the fluid touches will develop a clear blister that slowly turns black. After twenty four hours, the blister will burst, and a eight inch copy of SPC-718 will emerge, rapidly growing to full size in a few days. This has been show to occur on all organic substances. 

On living subjects, copies of SCP-718 are permanently affixed. Attempts to surgically remove SCP-718 causes extreme pain, though it is possible. Aside from a vague and persistent desire to destroy other copies of SCP-718, the host is unaffected after removal. 

If SCP-718 is not removed from a living subject, testing indicates that the subject becomes able to 'see' through SCP-718, vision with SCP-718 is different, as [DATA EXPUNGED] is now visible, at the expense of more conventional sight. After roughly one week (or the amount of time SCP-718 takes to fully grow) the subject will attempt to find the area that undergoes the largest amount of traffic and 'plant' SCP-718 at the expense of the subject's life. 

Eighty six copies of SCP-718 are currently contained in the containment chamber
