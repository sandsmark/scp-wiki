**Nash Pinkle's Guide to the Foundation**
**Author:** [[*user CityToast]]

The tale that is 8 years in the making. This tale is based on a conversation I had in 2012 over IRC with one basic premise: How can you explain concepts about the Foundation //badly//...but //correctly//? 

It started with tags, moved on to SCPs, and even Foundation staff. I apparently kept a list in a notepad file that's been sitting in my documents folder since then, and I stumbled across it this week while looking at old SCP files on my laptop. Enjoy.

Thanks to [[*user Croquembouche]] for CSS help.

//Nash Pinkle was a facilities specialist employed by the SCP Foundation. Though his employment has recently ended, he did express interest in becoming a Foundation researcher, and at one time attempted to submit the following “guide” as a body of research work for review. It remains here for archival purposes only and **should not be used for reference**.//
