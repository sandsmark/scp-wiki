++++ **__Special Containment Procedures__**
SCP-5707 is held within Humanoid Housing Unit 14 at Site-51. It will receive an A-Class Amenities Package, including an exclusively vegetarian meal plan. Further requested items may be provided upon approval. 

All information regarding SCP-5707's anomalous capabilities will continue to be expunged from public and academic records by Foundation assets within historic academia. Due to the prominent nature of SCP-5707's identity, further precautions may be taken by the Information Security Division.

++++ **__Description__**
SCP-5707 is a human male formally known as Samuel Wilson[[footnote]]Commonly referred to as Uncle Sam.[[/footnote]], born 1766/09/13. Medical analysis shows SCP-5707's biological aging process ceased at approximately 75 years old. SCP-5707 is capable of transmuting biological matter into forms of meat typically consumed by humans[[footnote]]Most notably chicken, pork, and beef.[[/footnote]]. This process has a conversion ratio of 1:5 kg; producing non-anomalous and unexpired meat product.

During its 166 years of containment, repeated attempts to gauge the full capabilities of SCP-5707 have been met with resistance. Despite these refusals, SCP-5707 has fully cooperated with containment protocols and is considered a low-risk anomaly.

[[div class="addenda-header"]]
++++ **__Discovery__**
SCP-5707 willingly entered containment under the American Secure Containment Initiative on 1854/07/31. Due to its efforts during the War of 1812, SCP-5707 had already been documented by the ASCI, but containment was deemed unnecessary at the time.

SCP-5707 has been in Foundation custody since its formation. The following document was provided upon SCP-5707's acquisition:

**Item Number:** 54-3341

**Classification Type:** Humanoid
-----
**ASCI Protocols for Containment:** In conjunction with local authorities, the death of 54-3341 has been successfully fabricated. A deceased convict was used as a replacement during Samuel Wilson's public burial.

 54-3341 is to be kept within housing suitable to his desire and shall be given all luxuries and personal effects afforded to a man of his stature. Security is to be held at a minimum in regard to 55-3341.

An effort will be made to uphold the public legacy of 54-3341. All information regarding the anomalous capabilities of 54-3341 is currently being expunged from civil and government records. 
>
**Description:** 54-3341 is the skilled carnomancer Samuel Wilson, born 1766 to Edward Wilson, leader of the now-defunct "Massachusetts Lodge of the Flesh Masons". At age 14, 54-3341 joined the Continental Army, wherein his anomalous capabilities became known to the ASCI. Serving as a meatpacker, 54-3341 willingly offered knowledge of his abilities to superior officers. 54-3341 demonstrated skills in carnomancy on slaughtered cows, greatly amplifying the amount of edible meat procured from each carcass. Due to his patriotism, overtly pacifist behavior, and the limited resources of our organization at the time, 54-3341's containment was deemed non-essential.

At the beginning of the War of 1812, 54-3341 was contracted to supply the North-Eastern Continental Army with meat rations. Due to a lack of readily available livestock, 55-3341 contacted the ASCI in an attempt to fulfill his contract. An agreement was reached wherein the Continental Army would provide 54-3341 with deceased enemy combatants for the purpose of transmutation into edible rations. During the war, 54-3341 provided the Continental Army with 2000 barrels of "pork" and over 3000 barrels of "beef".
**Nota Bene:** On July 24, 1854, 54-3341 contacted the ASCI in order to facilitate his own containment.

> I have served this great nation since I was merely a boy, and now in my growing years, I must call upon my nation to serve me. I do not wish to watch as my family, friends, and fellow patriots wither and rot before me, but I refuse to use my gifts in order to interrupt the natural flow of life. A solution to my impasse I hope to find in you. On the 31st of July 1854 I plan to relieve myself of the freedoms I so passionately believe in and commit to solitude within a confinement of your choosing. If the arrangement is suitable, please send word of a time and place for which I can entrust my person to you.

Though informed his containment has been deemed unnecessary, 54-3341 insisted it be so. This document will be further revised upon his containment.

++++ **__SCP-5707 Test Log__**
On 2020/01/20, SCP-5707 was requested to demonstrate its capabilities, for the purpose of update its file with visual records. SCP-5707 agreed to testing under the condition that the meat created would not be wasted. The corresponding video to the following transcript is available upon request. 

[[collapsible show="● Video Log ●" hide="○ Video Log ○"]]
**Foreword:** Present during the test will be Dr. Eliza Jones and SCP-5707. SCP-5707 will be provided one human corpse on which he will perform the transmutation.
------
**[BEGIN LOG]**

**Jones:** Okay Mr. Wilson, are you ready to begin?

**SCP-5707:** As ready as one can be, my dear.

**Jones:** This is the body we would like transmuted.

//[Dr. Jones points to the corpse to her right. SCP-5707 kneels next to the body.]//

**SCP-5707:** So young. Please tell me this boy has not met his end simply for these tests?

**Jones:** I assure you that's not the case.

**SCP-5707:** What is his name?

**Jones:** Is that necessary for the process?

**SCP-5707:** No. But for my peace of mind, it is. 

//[Dr. Jones checks her clipboard.]//

**Jones:** His name was David Conner, age 28, convicted on multiple counts of homicide. Cause of death, suicide. 

**SCP-5707:** I see.

//[SCP-5707 places a hand on the body's forehead.]//

**SCP-5707:** An angry and sad life. I hope you now find the peace you deserve. 

**Jones:** Can we please begin, Mr. Wilson.

**SCP-5707:** As you wish. Please stand back, I would not want to soil your shoes. 

//[As Dr. Jones steps back. SCP-5707 is met with no resistance as he plunges both hands into the chest of the corpse.]//

**SCP-5707:** //[chanting in an unknown language.]//

//[The skin of the corpse begins to liquefy and pool around SCP-5707.]//

**SCP-5707:** My father taught me this technique. He was inspired by the Natives to use every part of the body in the process.

//[SCP-5707 forms the liquefied skin into a sphere and sets it on the ground.]// 

**Jones:** Why use human subjects?

//[SCP-5707 performs a chopping motion with both hands, the corpse begins to quiver. SCP-5707 abruptly motions upwards and the corpse's flesh rips loose. The flesh oozes a pinkish secretion as the muscles, tendons, and fat become one viscous substance.]//

**SCP-5707:** His colony was starving, the land yielded no crops, the forests barren of game. His people turned to him, his strength and knowledge was well known. He perfected this technique on withered remains of his fellow colonists, so that the remaining may survive.

//[Motioning downward the viscous flesh substance begins to solidify, forming a column of meat. SCP-5707 now turns and walks to the remaining skeleton.]//

**Jones:** I'm sure that must have been difficult.

**SCP-5707:** At our most trying times, what would seem difficult, becomes quite easy.

//[SCP-5707 clenches its fists and the skeleton crumbles into dust. It takes the ball of liquefied flesh and begins kneading it into the bone meal.]//

**Jones:** Does the person used have any effect on the end product, flavor or consistency wise?

**SCP-5707:** Some are more malleable than others, but the end result is just the same. Like any form of art it is the hands of the creator that shape the creation.

**Jones:** I see, so what kind of meat are you planning on making?

**SCP-5707:** How does ham sound, my dear?

**Jones:** That will be adequate.

**SCP-5707:** Very well.

//[SCP-5707 stands and places the liquefied skin on top of the meat column. With its index finger SCP-5707 cuts the palm of his right hand and places it on the column. The liquid skin pools over the column and solidifies. After several seconds the flesh column illuminates and SCP-5707 removes his hand.]// 

**SCP-5707:** Only a moment longer.

//[As the illumination fades the meat column is revealed to now have the appearance of uncooked ham; though significantly larger than normal cuts of ham.]//

**SCP-5707:** There you have it, my dear. 

**Jones:** Thank you, Mr. Wilson. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.

**[END LOG:]**

After the conclusion of testing, the ham produced was weighed and analyzed. Using one human corpse weighing 81.64 kg, SCP-5707 created 408.20 kg of non-anomalous boneless pork.
