**Item #:** SCP-621

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-621 are to be kept in the Site ██ greenhouse and watered regularly. Seeds and pollen from SCP-621 are not to be released into the wild. All instances of SCP-621 are not to be released for commercial trade, given as gifts, used as props, or stored in personnel offices.

Any instances of SCP-621 found in the wild are to be exterminated immediately. Any instances of SCP-621 found in public are to be confiscated and whoever in possession at the time be taken in for questioning. 

Cross-pollination of SCP-621 species will require clearance from Command-level Personnel. No cross-pollinations may be done for personal reasons. 

**Description:** SCP-621 is a series of flowering plants, originally released by ██████ & █████ Flower Shop, who have been taken control of by the Foundation as of █/██/0█. These plants, mainly the plant species Didier’s tulips (tulipa gesneriana), are spliced with the fluorescent gene of the █████████ jellyfish (██████████ ████████████). These plants glow a variety of colors, though most instances glow purple, blue, or green. This bioluminescent effect can be best seen at night or in a dark area. The effect is only active while the plants are alive.  

Although SCP-621 has no direct psychological effects, personnel have been mesmerized by their appearance, with numerous requests to store them in their personal offices; all of which have been denied. SCP-621 has varying effects on animals. When exposed to bees, hummingbirds, or cross-pollinating animals, all of the animals subjected have preferred spreading the pollen of SCP-621 as opposed to other flowering plants, and due to its bioluminescence, are capable of doing this at night, increasing its rate of reproduction. However, when exposed to herbivores, such as deer or rabbits, all of subjected animals have actively avoided SCP-621. With a high fertility rate, a natural defense against predators, and an aesthetic quality to most humans, SCP-621 can be deemed a highly effective invasive species. 

Although Didier’s tulips (tulipa gesneriana) are the most common type of SCP-621, there also exists species of SCP-621 that include other types of tulips, roses, and a few instances of lettuce. Before Dr. Z████████ could request any D-Class Personnel to test its edibility, Dr. Leyendecker volunteered to eat an instance of SCP-621 in what he referred to as “a glowing green salad”. After eating, Dr. Leyendecker exhibited no side-effects for the next twenty-four hours, but has reported having “glowing [EXPLITIVE REDACTED]”. No further cases have been reported since then. Further requests for retests by Dr. Leyendecker and other personnel wishing to replicate the effect have been denied. Requests to serve SCP-621 in the Site ██ cafeteria have also been denied.

--**Addendum 621-1:** In light of the recent events involving Dr. Z████████ hoarding several instances of SCP-621 in his personal office, all personnel on Site ██ are aloud to keep at least one instance of SCP-621 in their offices.--

**Addendum 621-2:** In light of Dr. Z████████’s public apology for hoarding several instances of SCP-621 in his personal office, personnel are no longer aloud to keep any instances of SCP-621 in their offices.
