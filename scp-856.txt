**Item #:** SCP-856

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The affected length of the █████████ River is bounded with four kilometers of chain link fencing, three meters in height and topped with razor-wire. The fence lines both banks and connects across the river at both ends of the containment area. Signs are posted every fifty meters in Sudanese and English warning of a chemical spill contaminating the river. Two armed guards are sent twice daily to patrol both banks of the containment area in a standard Foundation off-road vehicle. The vehicle is equipped with a .50 caliber rear-mounted machine gun for use in the event of a containment breach.    

Should a civilian(s) accidentally witness SCP-856, they are to be treated with a Class-B Amnesiac and transported out of the immediate area. The use of force is acceptable if a civilian(s) deliberately attempts to come into contact with SCP-856. 
 
**Description:** SCP-856 is an entity residing in a four kilometer length of the  █████████ River in southern Sudan. If a human being comes into contact with the water, he or she is assaulted by the entity at extremely high speeds. The velocity of SCP-856 is such that it appears to viewers as a flash or blur. 

Extensive evidence compiled through the use of high speed photography reveals SCP-856 to be leonine in nature. Estimations put the entity at approximately the size of an adult male lion (//Panthera leo//). SCP-856 seems by all evidence to be bound to the river, as it has rarely been witnessed extending itself out of the water or beyond the banks by more than 1.5 meters (//Note: see Incident Log//).

Attacks come almost instantly upon any bodily contact with the river. If multiple parties come into contact with the water, SCP-856 will jump between individuals in fractions of a second, entirely regardless of distance. The entity’s ability of instantaneous movement does not apply to water up- or down-river of the containment area, or water physically detached from the confines of the river itself.

Factors that incite attacks appear to be variable. No amount of protective clothing appears to prevent SCP-856 from sensing the contact of humans with the river. Objects placed in contact with the water by human beings have likewise provoked attacks, save for certain instances conducted with extreme care. Fauna in contact with the river generally do not incite attacks from SCP-856.

SCP-856 causes deep incisions and lacerations consistent with leonine teeth and claws. Wounds are fatal in all cases, and generally come to the abdomen or torso. 

SCP-856 by all accounts ceases to exist when not attacking. Extensive photography, satellite surveillance, and sonar sounding have failed to observe the presence of SCP-856 in the absence of a provoking party.  
 

> **Historical note:** 
> 
> //Foundation control over SCP-856 and the four kilometer section of the █████████ River was minimal between the discovery of the site in 1956 and the Sudanese ceasefire of 1995. At that point, greater numbers of personnel could safely enter the area and current containment procedures were put into effect.//
> 
> //Prior to 1995, small village of several hundred people, called ███, was situated on the eastern bank of the █████████ River within the region containing SCP-856. The inhabitants of the village were inexplicably able to draw water from and wash in the river without inciting attacks. Interviews revealed that the villagers believed the entity was a protective spirit, and ritualistically left it offerings of livestock. In 1995, a joint effort between Foundation forces and UN peacekeeping troops resituated the village 9 km downriver with a minimal loss of civilian life.//

**Relevant Incident Logs:**

//__Incident 856-A__//
//Date:// ██/██/1956
//Events:// A troop of twenty one Anya-Nya guerillas attempted to ford the river from the west bank, apparently with intent to attack ███ Village. Eyewitnesses claim that fourteen of the soldiers were killed within thirty seconds, and the remainder fled. 
//Notes:// Reports of this incident led to the first investigation of SCP-856 by the Foundation, and the establishment of rudimentary containment procedures.

//__Incident 856-B__//
//Date:// ██/██/1971
//Events:// Three junior researchers were killed through disembowelment when their motorboat drifted within the section of the river containing SCP-856. The researchers were members of two week task force sent to gain further information on SCP-856 through observation and experimentation.
//Notes:// Following this incident, lines of warning buoys were added to extant containment procedures for SCP-856.

//__Incident 856-E__//
//Date:// ██/██/1995
//Events:// A team of five engineers were killed while attempting to lay a temporary bridge over the section of river containing SCP-856.
//Notes:// Security footage confirms that at no time did any personnel or bridge component come into contact with the water. It appears that under certain circumstances, SCP-856 is able to leave the confines of the river. 

//__Incident 856-F__//
//Date:// ██/██/2009
//Events:// Due to a particularly bad drought, a section of the █████████ River, including the containment area for SCP-856, dried up for a period of 42 hours. At 08:30 in the nearby city of [Data Expunged] 
All three entities were finally pushed back by Foundation forces at 13:50. Total deaths numbered 64 civilian, 17 local law enforcement, 5 Foundation personnel. 
//Notes:// This incident has called into question Foundation understanding of the exact composition of SCP-856. It has been ascertained from this incident that with significant firepower, SCP-856 can be restrained for a short period of time. Requests have been filed for measures to prevent further incidents of this type.
