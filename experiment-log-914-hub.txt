> **Incinerator** A room containing the incinerator, used for the destruction of classified information. The incinerator is occasionally used for the destruction of items produced by SCP-914.[[footnote]]Under circumstances specified in Section 3 of the SCP Foundation Policy on the Handling of Anomalous Phenomena, and Ethics Committee Ruling 10A-0344 (“Retroactive Justification for Unauthorized Neutralization of Anomalies”).[[/footnote]]  The room also functions as a waste management center.

++ Additional Information

Site-19 Facility 23, located in [REDACTED], is a facility built specifically to contain [[[SCP-914]]] and its anomalous products. It is part of the larger Site-19 administration.

Facility 23 was originally built in 1988 as an isolated containment facility for multiple large anomalous items. Following Anomalous Item A██████’s reclassification as SCP-914 in 2008, it was moved into Facility 23 and the facility was converted into a research establishment for the purpose of SCP-914 research. Dr. Charles Gears, former Director of Euclid-level containment at Site-19, was transferred to Facility 23 to oversee its research. Testing of SCP-914 began on September 9th of that year.

During April 2017, Facility 23 was expanded and partly rebuilt to accomodate the increasing number of researchers, and the large amount of testing products accumulated over the years. Dr. Arthur Hackett and Dr. Lucius Veritas were transferred to Facility 23 to replace Director Charles Gears, as Director of Administration and Research, respectively.
