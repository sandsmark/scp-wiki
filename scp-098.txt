**Item #:** SCP-098

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Members of SCP-098 are to be kept in a 10 m x 20 m room with small pools of water and a sandy substrate.  Rocks and driftwood are to be left in a random arrangement for SCP-098 to nest in.

The enclosure is to be cleaned on a weekly basis.  During this time, all members of SCP-098 are to be accounted for first, to prevent injury or death to personnel or SCP-098.  Any members of SCP-098 that appear ill or injured are to be removed and examined.

**Description:** SCP-098 is a species of previously unknown crustacean.  They resemble crabs, but instead of claws, they have small knife-like talons at the end of their front legs.  They are also unusually large, particularly for a land-dwelling species, 40 centimeters tall and as large as 60 centimeters across.

They prefer an environment with ample concealment and shallow pools of water.  They are able to breathe both water and air, splitting their time between the two environments.  They also have a remarkable range of vocalizations.

Most unusually for crustaceans, they use pack hunting tactics to take down prey larger than themselves.  When they detect a prey animal, they will attempt to surround it, repeating its sounds to draw it into position.  When they are in position, one will approach the prey.  While the prey animal is focused on the first individual, others will move behind the prey and attempt to cut the tendons of its legs.  They will continue mimicking it as they attack, which serves to disorient it.  After making a cut, they spit a viscous mucus over the wound.  This substance hardens rapidly and seals the wound, preventing blood loss.  They will continue this until the prey is completely immobilized.  At this point, they will begin to feed by cutting off small pieces of flesh from the prey animal.  They only feed as long as the animal is still alive.  It can take several hours or several days to finish, depending on the size of the prey animal and the number of specimens.

They seem to be able to communicate with each other verbally, alerting each other to the presence of threats or potential food over short distances.  It was initially thought that they might display human-level intelligence, but are now believed to merely parrot human speech.  They are currently being held to determine their origin, as they seem unrelated to any known crustacean species.

They normally pose little threat to adult humans, preferring smaller prey, such as dogs, cats, and pigs.  However, they have been known to go after much larger prey when hungry, including personnel.

They were discovered in ██████, Brazil, after a rash of child disappearances.

**Addendum 098-1:** SCP-098 is more intelligent than previously thought.  They adapt quickly to changes in their environment, and have shown an ability to remember patterns.  Dr. Mann has taught several of them simple tricks, and they seem to understand the meanings of several words.  Testing will continue.
