**Item #:** SCP-098

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Members of SCP-098 are to be kept in a 10x20 meter room with small pools of water and a sandy substrate.  Rocks and driftwood are to be left in a random arrangement for 098 to nest in.

The enclosure is to be cleaned on a weekly basis.  During this time, all members of 098 are to be accounted for first, to prevent injury or death to personnel or 098.  Any members of 098 that appear ill or injured are to be removed and examined.

**Description:** SCP-098 is a species of previously unknown crustacean.  They resemble crabs, but are unusually large, and instead of claws, they have small knife-like talons at the end of their front legs.  They are unusually large for a land-dwelling species, 40 centimeters tall and as large as 60 centimeters across.

They prefer an environment with ample concealment and shallow pools of water.  They are able to breathe both water and air, splitting their time between the two environments.  

Most unusually for crustaceans, they use pack hunting tactics to take down prey larger than themselves.  When they detect a prey animal, they will attempt to surround it.  When they are in position, one will approach the prey.  While the prey animal is focused on the first individuals, others will move behind it and attempt to cut the tendons of its legs.  After making a cut, they spit a viscous mucus over the wound.  This substance hardens rapidly and seals the wound, preventing blood loss.  They will continue this until the prey is completely immobilized.  At this point, they will begin to feed by cutting off small pieces of flesh from the prey animal.  They only feed as long as the animal is still alive.  It can take several hours or several days to finish, depending on the size of the prey animal and the number of specimens.

They normally pose little threat to adult humans, preferring smaller prey, such as dogs, cats and pigs.  However, they have been known to go after much larger prey when hungry, including personnel.

They were discovered in ██████, Brazil, after a rash of child disappearances.

**Addendum XXX-1:** SCP-098 is more intelligent than previously thought.  They adapt quickly to changes in their environment, and have shown an ability to remember patterns.  Dr. Mann has taught several of them simple tricks.  Testing will continue.
