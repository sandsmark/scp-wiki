**Item #:** SCP-4123

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedure:** SCP-4123 is to be kept in a standard containment unit in Site ██. --All testing must have level 3 researcher approval as well as 2 personnel with memetic training present.-- All personnel entering SCP-4123’s containment unit must remove any loose items prior to being anywhere within 1.2 m of 4123's vicinity. 

[[collapsible show="+ Updated Containment Procedures:" hide="- Close"]] 

**Updated Containment Procedures:** SCP-4123 Is not to be further tested as of the date ██/██/2018 without approval from at least two level 4 personnel. SCP-423 is classified as a Class X information security hazard. Any personnel under level 4 is to be administered Class A Amnestics if documents designated SCP-4123-3 are viewed.
[[/collapsible]]

**Description:** 

SCP-4123 is a common leather attaché case of dark hue which appears to have worn over time. The specific hue perceived differs between observers. Two white cloth gloves float in front of the case, operating as its "hands". The gloves have a cartoonish style and will always float directly in front of or inside the case. The gloves are approximately two and a half times the size of human hands and are able to reach up to a length of 1m.

Given an input, normally in the form of an object, SCP-4123 will create a game based upon it. The game is fully immersive and is designated SCP-4123-1. The game is created and maintained through anomalous phenomena directed by the intelligence inhabiting SCP-XXXX. These phenomena include spatial displacement, the creation of objects and creatures and low-level reality manipulation. 

A variable number of participants are chosen for each game. Criteria for selection vary, but preference does seem to be given to willing participants. The chosen participants are teleported to the location of the game if necessary and given a note (SCP-4123-2) explaining the rules and objectives.

At the end of the game players may be returned in their original condition and location. Following this documents will manifest inside the case, designated SCP-4123-3, which include information regarding the game and allow for written feedback from players. As of ██/██/2018 SCP-4123 has ███ SCP-4123-3 documents within it.

When SCP-4123 is waiting for an input the left hand will form a fist and the right assumes an open palm position. When an input is placed into SCP-4123's right hand, the left hand will open and begin counting down from five on its fingers [[footnote]] During this time inputs may be able to be removed canceling countdown [[/footnote]] Upon reaching the end of the countdown SCP-4123 will take the input and both hands inside of the case and close for a period of 3 seconds to 12 minutes. During this time SCP-4123 may shake, vibrate, or in some instances disappear and reappear. Upon re-opening the game will begin.

Inputs must in comparison to previous inputs be increasing in complexity, power, or rarity. This was discovered during testing when inputs began to be rejected and the trend became apparent.  Reasons for this are most likely as a part of SCP-4123's theorized intention to improve game creation.

> 
> **Subject:** Concerns about SCP-4123 
> 
> **Body:** SCP-4123 is starting to show more eagerness when taking items. Last week it nearly took my hand off when handing it an object a little too slow. That didn’t concern me so much, but what happened during today's testing has.  
> 
> When offered a variety of items SCP-4123 rejected one after another within the approved list. Eventually most of the team gave up trying, it seemed we couldn’t appease 4123. However, when one field agent was trying to hand it a toy train it grabbed her...aggressively. She tried to get it off insisting that it was hurting her but, we got her to calm down after a few moments. 4123 moved its hand under her shirt, we were all shocked of course, who would think it would touch someone, let alone in such an inappropriate area. It held her for a few seconds underneath the shirt, to her discomfort of course, and then began the countdown. What transpired was an unapproved object being used for The Game, well a better term would be “input”. What game we took part in can be found in the test logs. 
> 
> As I said before the game wasn’t of much concern, what's of concern is that 4123 may have developed the ability to take ideas or images as inputs. When SCP-4123 grabbed Agent Kell it must have been grabbing her tattoo on her chest and used that as a means of creating the game. 
> 
> I suggest no individuals with any tattoos or major artistic alterations be allowed within the vicinity of SCP-4123. I am also requesting that the list of allowed items for testing be expanded as SCP-4123 is beginning to reject a majority.

SCP-4123 shows signs of intelligence due to gestures made with its hands while idle and its responses to feedback. These gestures include pointing, waving, clapping, “ok”, and handshakes if prompted. It’s theorized that SCP-4123 will do this in an attempt to gather participants.

After a game ends players will have in-depth knowledge of how to play and teach the game they just played regardless of complexity. However, this is limited to parts they participated in directly and what they have the ability to do.

[[tab SCP-4123-2]]
**SCP-4123-2** is a note given to players upon beginning the game. This note on one side in bold letters will have various phrases. The other side of the note will give participants a description of the game and rules for them to play, some may have a key or map if the rules call for it. 

This note is unable to be removed from players for the entirety of the game if it is lost or destroyed it will be returned to players when not in view. The note has a translucent quality but, is universally understandable regardless of the condition of the reader, environment, or the note itself.

[[tab SCP-4123-3]]
**SCP-4123-3** is a group of documents, which contains information about prior games. It explains in detail how to play the game, who took part in the game, who won and lost, important stats, and has a section to give a rating and feedback. Upon completion of rating and feedback, as well as returning of the documents to SCP-4123, will then close for a time of 1 to 2 minutes. During this time the documents become finalized and become an inseparable part of SCP-4123. Feedback is responded to in the section "Gamemasters notes" in which SCP-4123 will consider changes and requests for future SCP-4123-1 instances. [[footnote]] This is the only reference of the name "Gamemaster" found [[/footnote]]

Documents removed after finalization can be re-read and moved but never destroyed or permanently kept away from SCP-4123. If SCP-4123-3 documents are removed from SCP-4123 for a length of time new copies will manifest inside of it.

> **Description:** SCP-4123 was given the game and accepted it immediately, upon game start D-4213 was anomalously displaced to an unknown location. Location was described as a game café, the subject reported multiple unknown humanoids alongside humans were present. Games beings played were unknown to the subject as well as many games advertised on the walls of the café. The subject was instructed by the note to take a seat at any computer when subject sat game automatically booted on the computer. When subject experienced trouble with game nearby humanoids offered help with the game but were unwilling to discuss any other subjects. 
> 
> **Gameplay:** After subjects description of gameplay, it was confirmed to be a fully released version of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1633 SCP-1633]. The largest differences however being the lack of health hazards to players and the game having a multiplayer option. After help from nearby humanoids D-4213 was able to beat several levels but stopped to try another game. D-4213 attempted to boot a game named "The Foundation 2: First Days" a warning was displayed on the screen to put on ██████ or that players must have level █ ███████. At this point subject was advised by other humanoids to head back at which point subject stood and was immediately returned to SCP-4123.

> **Subject:** SCP-4123 classification
> 
> **Body:** I believe after multiple tests done with SCP-4123 we can be right to classify it as “Safe”. If we don’t give it anything it’s probably going to just stay waiting forever.  I believe we should further test with SCP-4123 as the information it has provided has been incredibly valuable. We should further explore the possibilities SCP-4123 can provide as an information gathering tool beyond the scope of just games.
> 
> That being said, I think we should keep it under wraps even in site. We can’t have staff throwing things at SCP-4123 willy nilly, we still don’t know what it’s fully capable of. I also have concerns about SCP-4123’s possible memetic properties, I have 3 personnel with memetic training on my research team as part of that concern. Testing should never be approved without someone with memetic training present and any researcher to request so would be best denied. Of course that will be up to you and whoever else comes up with the procedures for these things. 
> 
> Me and my team have sent and are waiting for an approved list of items for testing. If testing is approved we don't want to waste any time.

> Oh, one more thing. If I don't see you today, I just wanted to say.

> **Input:** Apple //Approved//
> 
> **Instance location:** Site ██
> 
> **Player Count:** 5 - //Research Team//
> 
> **Description:** Research team gave SCP-4123 one apple as previously tested. The SCP-4123-1 game manifested in the research room while out of view of the team. First record of SCP-4123-2 being discovered. The research team had a difficult time playing until they discovered SCP-4123-2 in their pockets. Upon reading the rules for the game the research team began attempting to play with apples provided by SCP-4123-1 manifestation. After twenty minutes of attempts Dr.C████ was able to successfully split the apple according to the rules of the game. Following this the rest of the team soon also learned to play. After the finalization of documents SCP-4123-3 research team had the ability to share and play this game with great mastery. This led to the discovery of SCP-4123's anomalous ability to transfer information to participants. 
> 
> **Gameplay:** “Appleshöösh”, the game involves dropping apples vertically in a method that splits the apple into multiple slices. The score is determined by the number of slices the apple splits into.
> 
> **Feedback:** What is the purpose of your game creation? What made you and where do you come from?
> 
> **Masters Notes:** //Response was a 27-page explanation of games and their importance to team building as well as a basic history of games. The final two pages were an explanation on the importance of feedback with no other information. It has been recommended to only leave genuine feedback or none at all for future tests.//

> **Interview Log:** ███ **Recorded:** ██/██/2014
> **Interviewed:** Dr. Jake Godfrey 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. ”DM” David Matthews
> **Foreword:** Increased sightings of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-303 SCP-303] had been occurring at Site ██ the week prior to this log. The topic of this logs is in response to the unusual amount and nature of the sightings following Dr. Godfrey encountering SCP-303. The encounter occurred at the door for SCP-4123’s chamber. Dr. “DM” was thought to be the best to investigate this occurrence. 
> 
> **<BEGIN LOG>**
> **Dr. “DM”:** Dr. Godfrey it’s good to see you, sadly I wish it was under better circumstances. How has research with SCP-████ been? 
> **Dr. Godfrey:** Oh fine, though, of course it’s been pretty tedious as you can imagine. 
> **Dr. “DM”:** Yes well working here isn’t easy. Which brings me to the question, what did you see today regarding SCP-303 and SCP-4123.
> **Dr. Godfrey:** Well I’ll start at the beginning of today. I was just leaving the café after having some coffee, of course I heard about the increased SCP-303 sightings, working here you have to keep up with that sorta’ thing. I was heading to SCP-████’s chamber when I passed by the door to SCP-4123. I don’t know if I saw 303 right away or just by the corner of my eye but I did a double take on the chamber door, then I realized the mistake I made.
> **Dr. “DM”:** Were you under the effects of 303’s “fear”. 
> **Dr. Godfrey:** Big time, froze up, couldn’t do a thing. Everything was “normal” at least in that aspect. 
> **Dr. “DM”:** Yes, that’s why we are here, can you explain what happened following this initial encounter. 
> **Dr. Godfrey:** Yea, that was definitely one of the strangest godsends of my life. I thought I would die of fear, every second felt like an hour. About a minute in of this torture I noticed something strange with 303, it looked like it was struggling and that terrible wheeze turned into sandpaper hyperventilation. 
> **Dr. “DM”:** Did the effects of 303 stop at this point?
> **Dr. Godfrey:** Sadly it did not. Another minute in and I had noticed 303 was moving, further from the door and toward 4123. Well, not moving, more like being dragged. 
> **Dr. “DM”:** What happened when it was within 4123’s reach? You stated to the security team earlier as being “hilarious".
> **Dr. Godfrey:** I think I’d laugh if I could. When 303 got close 4123 just grabbed it. That’s when 303 really started to struggle, it went frantic, that sandpaper turned into a chainsaw. It reminded me of a cartoon, especially when those big white gloves were forcing 303 into 4123. 
> **Dr. “DM”:** 303 was forced into 4123? Are you sure? 
> **Dr. Godfrey:** Very. The struggle lasted only moments, 303 was crammed in there. Then that’s when shit, sorry, “stuff” got really weird. 
> **Dr. “DM”:** Elaborate.
> **Dr. Godfrey:** Well I kinda blacked out for a moment, when I came to, I noticed I wasn’t exactly myself. Moving was hard, my breathing struggled, and worst of all I felt physically violated. 
> **Dr. “DM”:** Is this when to moved to the corner of 4123's chamber? 
> **Dr. Godfrey:** I didn’t do that, I saw myself do that. But I just watched, when I realized I wasn’t in my own body anymore I panicked, but quickly got over it. I was to preoccupied with my new form, I was able to move through the facility with ease once I got used to it. Even the locked up parts, don’t worry though I stayed away from those…mostly.  
> **Dr. “DM”:** You changed form? Do you recall what you looked like?
> **Dr. Godfrey:** Ehh…I tried, it didn’t exactly work and felt like I shouldn’t push what was already such an intense experience. 
> **Dr. “DM”:** Did you encounter anyone while you where in this form? 
> **Dr. Godfrey:** A few researchers and security, they freaked when they saw me. Whatever I looked like must have been terrible….was……was I?
> **Dr. “DM”:** 303? In a way, yes. You had the form and abilities of 303, however you weren’t exactly 303. Just the same way 303 wasn’t well…you.
> **Dr. Godfrey:** So when  I huddled in the corner, that was 303? 
> **Dr. “DM”:** Yes. 
> **Dr. Godfrey:** But why? What happened? 
> **Dr. “DM”:** Well my theory is 4123 used 303 as a means to create a game, I’m assuming you’ve already been briefed on 4123 yes? 
> **Dr. Godfrey:** A bit. So that was just part of some game? 
> **Dr. “DM”:** Pretty much, you won it seems…do you remember how the game ended?
> **Dr. Godfrey:** I just remember walking past the café and then a loud commotion coming from inside. Then nothing….then **[DATA REDACTED]**
> **Dr. “DM”:** I see…well I assume you don’t know much more than that. Your report doesn’t explain much more than what you just told me…unless there was anything else? 
> **Dr. Godfrey:** Well one thing does confuse me, why did 303 crawl into a corner? 
> **Dr. “DM”:** There are a few theories, one is that 303 being in a human form was under it’s own effects of fear. Another is that it simply couldn’t comprehend or was not comfortable in the human form. Security couldn’t get anything out of it other than attempts to wheeze with healthy lungs. 
> **<End log.>**
> **Closing statement:** Dr.Godfrey has been placed under monitored medical leave for a 5 month period with concerns for his mental health. 
> 
> **Update:**//SCP-4123 has had containment procedures revised in accordance with information hazard presented by new 4123-3 documents. SCP-303 encounters had returned to normalcy following this event.//

> **Body**: I believe classification of SCP-4123 as safe was a mistake on our part. After multiple tests we have reason to believe that SCP-4123 is able to and has been growing in a sense. We knew it would make better games but never had we guessed it would understand other anomaly’s let alone take or use them. Not only does it seem to have a preference or want of anomalous inputs but it also was able to find one. 
> 
> The fact it was able to activate 3751 and then not long after creating a game that involved an anomalous property of 3751 is no coincidence. I also believe usage log 1 needs to be hidden, deep, at least to those not directly involved. We had no worries about it before but the more that is understood of SCP-4123 the more it worries me.

> 1: All agents please avoid reality #113 and #24 as "mainline" reality activity has grown to a security risk. Gamemasters are already retrieved, any agents attempting to enter these realities are required to have approval from administration. 
> 2: This is a warning message to all purples due to recent behavior. Breaking rules such as enacting Game Time before a class XK event is strictly prohibited. Any purples found breaking such rules will be banished to a number of terrible realities. Watch yourselves, this is the last and only warning.
