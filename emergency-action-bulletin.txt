> {{At 5:21 PM Eastern Standard Time, several unidentified aircraft entered US airspace above the Florida and Georgia regions. The aircraft are believed to have first been detected by local radar and air traffic control entering the Florida coastal areas from the Atlantic Ocean. The FAA has been unable to determine the origins and nationality of the pilots, though deducing such information assumes they belong to a recognized political state. Aircraft demonstrate properties inconsistent with any known commercial or military vehicle and are capable of achieving extremely high velocities. It is believed at least some of these aircraft are bearing explosive, biological, or chemical payloads.  }} 
> 
> {{Please remain in your emergency shelters and await further instructions from FEMA. If you do not possess an emergency shelter or are in a public area, seek out a basement or other subterranean structure immediately. It is currently not known if or when the next emergency broadcast will be transmitted. It is unlikely that emergency services will be available for some time. Additional information will be transmitted as it becomes available. }}

> {{At this time, FEMA is able to confirm that the aforementioned unidentified aircraft have successfully delivered multiple biological payloads throughout the continental United States. Known targets include New York, Detroit, Los Angeles, Boston, Orlando, Miami, Atlanta, and Honolulu, though other cities may be affected as well. Due to the nature of this situation, government resources are strained. It is not known when government operatives will be able to perform search and rescue operations in affected regions. The payloads delivered by these aircraft appear to be gaseous, toxic substances that will induce serious injury or death if inhaled. Limited field reports suggest some HAZMAT suits and filtration apparatuses are capable of reducing or negating exposure to the gas. Under no circumstances should you expose yourself to the gas, intentionally or otherwise. Remain in your shelter until further instructions are issued. }}
> 
> {{Note that the gas appears to be colorless, odorless, and partially translucent. There will be little to no indication that an area is affected by the gas. The early signs and symptoms of exposure to the gas are not known at this time. For your safety, avoid all public areas indefinitely.}}

Ignore any "knocking", doorbell ringing, or other indications that somebody may be attempting to gain access to your shelter or the encapsulating structure. Ignore any vocalizations not made by members of your party. Remain as silent as possible at all times. Avoid excess emission of sound, light, and odors. Ignore any personnel requesting access to your shelter or claiming to be an affiliate of the United States government.}}
