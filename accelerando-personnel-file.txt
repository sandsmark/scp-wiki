[[include component:image-block name=Angelakos.jpg|caption=Janitor Doe yelling at his audience.]]

**Name:** Alex Ron Doe

**Security Clearance:** Level 1

**Position:** Your --friendly-- neighborhood janitor

**History:** Mr. Ron Doe was found aimlessly wandering the streets of [REDACTED] during the containment breach of SCP-████. After being subsequently harassed for its possessions by SCP-████, he was then subdued by present Agents, who managed to contain SCP-████ after offering various assorted fruits to it.

Prior to their scheduled administration of amnestics, Mr. Ron Doe mentioned that he was a musician and composer, and would prefer to not forget how to properly play a kettle drum. After several hours of deliberation, it was then agreed that he could take up the position of janitor at Site-30, and occasionally perform during lunch and break hours. However, staff were not informed of Mr. Ron Doe's love of the atonal, minimalistic, aleatoric, and pretty much any damn avant-garde genre of music. He was subsequently booed off the stage during his first performance of //Music for 18 Musicians// for being unable to simultaneously play two marimbas. Due to this incident, Mr. Ron Doe has chosen not to respond to any negative criticism towards his music unless he is holding a microphone.

+ [[[SCP-1940]]] -- The First of Many
After my first SCP went down (a mirrored elevator with a ghost apparition or something), I was slightly discouraged. I used one of my fears to make this, but it had still crashed and burned, due to my lack of experience. Though I guess I wouldn't say "crashed and burned", it was more like "slowly cooked to a crisp in the oven". Still, I looked at each piece of advice given to me, and moved on. 

I then got the idea for this on my way to my next class. There was a bathroom next to another building, but not exactly connected to it. I remembered how much shit (no pun intended) was kept in there for storage, and wondered if we should sell it all. Then, BAM, an idea! After writing it out and having it kicked off the main list (again), Scantron suggested a humorous approach to the idea, and Crayne helped me rewrite it, making it what it is today. Notably, Reject also shared a thought that inspired me to create Light Courier Enterprises.

+ [[[SCP-1920]]] -- A (Minor) GOI is Born
I was surprised by the success of this one (unsurprisingly, after a rewrite). After the initial success of 1940, I was excited to write another article, and my eyes fell upon this old science project I'd made.

Once again Crayne swooped in, liking the idea and helped tighten it up. I had begun to get more confident in my writing skills, but like Crayne said, I was still missing some details which were quite important in making a solid SCP. I cannot stress enough how important perseverance and critique are in making a successful article, because that's what got this to stay up.

I'm sure you can figure out what happened in this SCP, if you read about LCE.

+ [[[SCP-1490]]] -- A Short Nightmare
The inspiration for this was from a nightmare. I'd rather not disclose on //all// the details, but basically it was a giant, costumed, big-headed thing that morphed people into animal shapes.

This had evolved from a big-headed kid that was mistakenly similar to another kid SCP that replaced other kids a family. Luckily, Dexanote pointed that out, and the SCP's progress went on a hiatus.

That dream pretty much made up what I wanted it to be, with a little backstory behind it to supplement it. This was also my first draft that didn't get a line by line review; I felt like throwing it around chat helped it the most. Chat was also where people suggested some more ideas on where to take this article.

The backstory? The people that came to him were from AWCY. They saw potential in him for creating some spectacular projects, but ultimately rejected him. After being rejected by so many people (his parents, friends, etc.), he broke. All he sees is his parents, who he wishes to give a "change in perspective".

+ [[[SCP-1740]]] -- "That's evil. I Love Guillotine"
This was created for the 5-word challenge by Dmatix, and I gotta say I enjoyed writing this one. I admit the words were a bit easy (playground, number, saliva, prison, guillotine) but I'm still happy with how this turned out. 

I also wanted an excuse to use LCE again, so I thought: "Why not have them make a system to prepare their children for their corrupted world?" Some parent in a sheltered society had to think of //some// way to show their kid that life was going to suck.

Only LongWayHome looked at this article before I posted it. I don't see him around very often anymore, but he has my respect and gratitude for giving feedback and critique to others on the site.

+ [[[SCP-1640]]] -- Myth Reborn
So I came on chat late at night, and found Meserach using a random word generator for another member, who was making ideas on the spot. I joined in, and eventually the words "satellite" and "rabbit" came up. I suggested a rabbit with a little den in a satellite, and others in chat pushed for Meserach to use it, which he reluctantly plopped in his sandbox. This was before I had written SCP-1490, and I wanted the rabbit to sing a song. You can imagine why I thought I couldn't write it. 

Time passed, and Meserach still hadn't written a draft. So I started to work on it myself, and foolishly posted it early (a bad habit of mine). After stagnating in ratings, I took it down and rewrote it with help from Fantem, who suggested more dialogue from the rabbit. I finally managed to elicit mild feels from people. Finally.

As for the backstory; the tale of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit_in_the_Moon Rabbit in the Moon] stuck with me from childhood, mainly because of the fact that it involved a rabbit throwing almost throwing itself into a fire for a poor man to eat. 

The article started out as a rabbit simply wanting to go to the moon. Then it became a son of a mother rabbit who sent we son to control the satellite giving religious offerings to the Moon Rabbit, and he crashes it because he feels his life is pointless now that his mother brushed him off as the runt he is. If you're wondering, sleeping on ideas can help when writing.

+ [[[SCP-1530]]] -- A Prelude to Pitch Haven
Oh boy, this one. Definitely my favorite.

I've put several weeks into this, which started from a simple animal abuse idea. It turned into a reality bender's pets, who were tormenting the one beating them. I don't have a clue how I came up with any of that. Or how the pets got into a tussle with the D-Class that wandered in and ended up killing the Josephine. She saw it coming, but was done with everything after seeing one of her "friends" die.

Fantem's Pitch Haven canon was a heavy inspiration in making this, and all of his works as well. A tale is actually in the works for this article, in explaining how Salix and Willow came to meet Josephine, though it may take a while.

That's all I have to say about this. It was great fun painting this story.

+ [[[SCP-1860]]] -- One-Hit Wonder
Herman-Fuller's Circus of the Disquieting has been an original and interesting GOI for me. I've always wanted to write for another GOI, so I decided that Herman Fuller himself was slowly becoming like Wondertainment, and dabbling in anomalies. Somehow, he ended up making a piece of sheet music turn into //this// thing. He thought it was cute, gave it a little side tent for his circus, but slowly forgot about it in his excitement for finding more performers.

Poor little dude. He thought he was forgotten on accident. Now he's stuck singing to a bunch of guys that don't even listen. Except Dr. Reich, because Dr. Reich is cool.

+ [[[SCP-1580]]] -- From Traffic to Tale
My brother and I were talking about SCP things while sitting outside, and we somehow got talking about bad ideas. We talked about basic super strong humanoids, magic items, all that. He then told me that a tree that had leaves that climb back up and place themselves back on would be dumb. I actually thought that was a great idea, and totally wrote it because proving him wrong is fun.

It was originally a society of leaves that thought they were in traffic. I thought I was happy with this article, when I realized that it totally could have been ether like some other people said. So I rewrote it, mainly because I imagine a lot of fairy tales were made by anomalies. I'm glad I did now, since it felt too silly for its own good.

+ [[[SCP-1544]]] -- Collaboration, Contigo 
bluesoul posted a gif of a fancy dancy rainbow slinky man in chat. I said I would write about it, Pendragon said he would write about it, and he proposed we collaborate. It was a long and arduous process, but we finished it.

To be honest, I was not as invested in this one as I wanted to be. It went in a direction that I wasn't altogether satisfied with, but Pendragon seemed happy with it, so I stuck with it.

+ [[[SCP-2990]]] -- An Intermezzo
 I wanted to get back to writing and felt like writing whatever, so I took a picture and went to work with it. The concept is a bit too dull for being without a backstory, so I inserted it into Light Courier Enterprise's universe. This was a little before their Earth's big Crash, in which society collapsed overnight, while Russia had stayed a dictatorship. 

Also, the location from where 2990-A was chosen on purpose. They sort of avoided repeating history by escaping through that place. 2990-A wasn't the portal, actually: it's just the location that people were entering into our world was hit by an ambush, and a dead man fell through the entryway. For now, every instance in our world is at peace. I mean, I would be at peace too if I just got to float around with only a part of my consciousness intact. 

The reason they became statues... imagine that you've just entered the portal. You can feel yourself falling apart, not being torn limb by limb, more like fading away. You see a blue light, a strange voice. She says she can save you, but only a portion. Don't worry about payment, she just felt like doing it. Taking your mess of a consciousness, you enter a new world in a form that you don't quite understand. But that doesn't matter, because you're free. 

+ [[[SCP-550]]] -- Mysteriously Misunderstood
I can't recall what motivated me to rewrite this one. (No, it wasn't the article number.) I think it's because it's methods of consuming corpses wasn't actually described, so I was left to imagine that myself. Somehow, I thought up a giant acidic mouth. 

I imagined this SCP to once be a man with... something in him. Nothing particularly dangerous, just something to constantly put him on edge. He tries to seek help, finds a cult that supposedly can help him. They're more interested in using what's in him to make a sacrifice. Using themselves. Now he's stuck being this monster, having to keep feeding whatever wants to eat inside him. His consciousness is still there, just barely.

The people that first found him were members of occult, and they had just found their new god. Knowing that the creature within was only beginning to think, yet would someday be a godly force, they feed themselves to it, seasoning and all.

When the monster's tongue began poking out, it had gained a new level of sentience and was finally testing its environment. If I had made the article longer, you would have seen an escalation in problems for containment, until... 

+ [[[SCP-2530]]] -- A Misadventure by Josephine
To be honest, the music was the main inspiration behind this article. I had been listening to Pogo's stuff for a while, and had just found Riverman's fantastic remixes of Pogo's classics. The basic concept was the first thing that came to mind.

It was right after that, I looked back and saw Josephine in 1530. If that was going to be her last moments, be it from this universe or not, why not write about her first moments? Why not write about her childhood, in which she could make a falling crate cease to exist, or make an entire class stone a boy for poking her, or turn a cruel clique into liquid? Certainly, she would have tried to fix it as a child, make it better. Though it ended up making her look a bit insane, which she is, in my headcanon. 

I have to give credit to Eskobar for suggesting I make a song instead of a speech, and for giving me a ton of feedback. Hope I made a good name for Green King, because reality benders are cool.

+ [[[SCP-2760]]] -- Back To Basics
My first successful coldpost. I wrote it bit by bit while taking a stay away from the site, reviewed it a bit myself, and posted it a week after I got back. Just goes to show that even when you've written ten articles, coldposting is hard.

I'm unsure where I was inspired to write this, other than the line "wacky waving inflatable arm-flailing tubeman." I actually wanted to make this funny, mostly because the image of a regal and majestic eastern dragon uncontrollably convulsing in midair was amusing. Of course, a story sprouted from the idea, and developed into a dragon couple, confused by their existence, roaming aimlessly until being contained. They're much like dogs, only made of plastic and airborne. I haven't thought of an origin for this SCP (this is the first time it's happened), other than they simply became. A universe with anomalies should have some of that, thrown in with all the deep stories we have on the site nowadays. Something that simply is.

On a final note, the Foundation has no idea that these guys have caused several inflatable tubeman take flight. I gave them the ability to do that because if I saw an inflatable flailing tubeman soaring in the sky, I would love life a little more.

+ [[[SCP-2940]]] -- Where Canons Collide
This idea originally began with me wanting to write something like all the old scary articles with giant exploration logs. It then sort of evolved into a bunker, because the idea of being trapped forever underground is unnerving to me, moreso over periods of time. This is why I had the time "snapshots" in the article, though I had a lot of trouble describing how it worked.

I originally wanted some sort of gross monster, with angelic light and singing, to be the monster, mainly because I like that image. I then realized that the Pitch Haven side-plot I was developing didn't have a true ending for one of the protagonists, so I thought about it and incorporated Ananias. 

Seeing as this article showed more effort does not equal more enjoyment for readers, I'm seeking different methods of approach for the concepts of articles, which is what I value most overall.

[[/=]]
Though it started out as a placeholder name for another group I had in mind, LCE has blossomed into a tiny little flower. LCE isn't one organization, but rather several groups of people in a utopian world invaded by chaos. The world isn't completely destroyed from nuclear bombing or wars of some sort; all of the technology present simply collapsed from a single anomaly, and left everything in a state of perpetual collapse (imagine something like a futuristic utopia, with monstrosities and haywire automatons running wild in partially destroyed cities). Completely unprepared for this kind of collapse, the majority of the world's population has perished or succumbed to malfunctioning services brought by LCE. Several straggler groups work independently, only wanting life to become perfect again.

Light Courier Enterprises may or may not have been responsible for the apocalyptic events. The remaining "people" are using LCE's name for several reasons:

**1.** They used to be an employee. This wasn't called "Enterprises" for nothing, and millions of employees required discipline beyond average regulations.

**2.** They're being a smartass. Worldwide quasi-corporations don't just exist without criticism, even in a utopia. These people want to control what's left, their way.

**3.** They want to rebuild LCE. Think something along the lines of the Enclave from Fallout 3; we have another group of people like that here. 

**4.** They're shouting a cry of help. They hope someone will recognize LCE's name, and are trying to use the remaining experimental technology to get anyone or something to save them.

**5.** Etc, Etc, Etc. The remaining groups are all motivated by their own reasons. Some people may be even enjoying this chaos, and may want to spread it; others are curious about the existence of another world, not broken by power.

So in [[[SCP-1940]]], you have people from #2, and in [[[SCP-1920]]] we have people from #3. [[[SCP-1740]]] is kind of #1, but only partially.

The anomalies in the world of LCE are often sent through dimensional-like means, or even temporal means. The power used to power the thousands of goods LCE produced destabilized the dimension itself, not unlike the Rat's Nest canon.

This certainly isn't one of the most creative GOI's, but I do plan to use it sometime in the future. PM me if you'd like critique on an idea involving them, or need a line-by-line. I'm willing to be flexible with the article formats involving LCE; bronze plaques weren't the only thing LCE issued with their best products.

They see black and white,

I see rounds of reminiscent rondos, with remembrance of days past.

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-332 They see repetitive themes and redundancy, the absence of nostalgia.]

I see mesmerizing minuets, welcoming others to dance along.

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-802 They see forms and lines particularly lined in forms.]

I see a  sobering sonata, pleading for a tear.

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-012 They see no reason, in the trying timing rhymes.]

I see singularity, an aria embedding in all,

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-407 They see a threat to the self, they silence its heart.]

They analyze the angels. They deprive the divine. 

Why don't they see the shapes they can create?

Those soundly shapes, they interlink, 

no longer melodic antiquity.

I see awe-inspiring ensembles, wishing to be heard. 

Yet they question their curious qualities

because they only see
