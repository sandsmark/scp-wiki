title:Contest Entries
Alright ladies and gentlemen, We'll be starting a new contest in light of the positive response for the last one.  A slightly different format this time around, allowing for more freedom of expression.

------

This time around, I'm looking for real originality.  I want to beat a new path, and see if we can wring out some original content.  I'd like horror to be a big player, but it is not a necessity.  Here are the rules to follow:

# Must have a picture
# No "Normal items that work much better then they should", such as cryogenic freezing air conditioners, or dimension-slicing knives
# No Humanoids.
# 


**Applications:**  Due by Friday (5/8/09)
**Voting:** Due by Friday (5/15/09)

Last contest participants:  I will leave these links open until the next contest starts.  At that time, I'll take them back down.  Thank you so much for entering!
