You made it to my author page! I, [[*user DarkStuff]], have created three successful articles at some point. By the time you are reading this, I might have made more. This author page is probably gonna be very bare for a while, and you're gonna have to just wait for me to put more effort into it. Yay!

Where getting a sandbox felt like an accomplishment, getting an author's page feels far, far greater. It feels honorific. I have accomplished something, it says to me. I am slowly becoming a more involved member of this community. Where I might not be the quickest of writers, when I write I put my heart and soul into it. And this has earned me an author's page. It feels so damn good.

I am much more of a brainstormer than I am a writer though, and thus I have ideas far faster than I have works of art to showcase them. I mean, having been a member since 2012, I have made only three articles. To be fair, I had only tried at the very beginning of that and had only started to get back into the swing of things maybe... late last year? Sorry, thinking in terms of school years. Early last year (2016 for those reading from //the future!//). Writing out something I am comfortable with uploading takes a long time. Why is this?

Well, flow. Mostly flow. When I write, it is stream of consciousness. If I have to stop and think about what I am going to write in the middle of a roll, it halts all progress. I need my flow. Thus, first drafts are (since I don't want to stop writing when I start) very much what I call "barfing out an idea". Barfing is when you just //need to get this down// and you don't have time to stop and think about the small things, like clinical tone for example. Flow is very much required when I am writing. This also makes going back and revising it very tedious for me, there is no constant flow when finding small thinks to revise. Thus, I have //massive// author blindness. I will start reading it and my brain goes back to flow mode, where I lose all critical thinking.

This is why critiquing is important to me. I don't think a cold post of mine could ever, //ever// work. Not with all the experience in the world. That's just not how my brain works. My pieces go through a lot of critiquing before they get posted, always in excess of a month. That combined with the fact that I have a life outside of this site (not saying other people don't) makes it take forever for me to crank out a work of mine. You would think this would mean that when they do get posted they're phenomenal, but that's not the case, mostly because in the grand scheme of things I am a fairly inexperienced writer.

Writing tales is, admittedly, easier for me. At the time of writing, I have not written a tale, but stream of consciousness works far better for those. Doesn't mean they don't need revising, but I like how the flow goes. If my writing is flowing, probably means the reader is flowing as well. Still fine tuning this, but you know, practice makes (near) perfect.

Anyways, I will probably have another section in here somewhere where I talk more about myself. I think I am an interesting individual. In fact, everyone is. Every single person on this planet is interesting and unique and worth knowing. However, I know myself the best, so it is easiest for me to write about me. Also, on the off chance that anyone is interested, they can go peek into my personality (if you haven't already gathered some stuff by the way I talk and write).

I hope that doesn't sound... entitled. But I know myself like I know nobody else, and my other goal outside of the writing community is to know someone else to the degree that I know myself. I guess that would have to be a romantic partner, wouldn't it. Hmm.

For serious though, I want to be documented so that people may know me and share feelings with me and be chummy with me and yaddah yaddah yaddah, also I have a fear of being forgotten and having a permanent record of my experiences would be a lot of closure to me, and the best place I could think of putting this where people may read it and converse with me about it is on a respected writing site. You don't have to read if you don't want, and the more I think about it the more selfish and entitled it sounds, it really isn't. I just want to connect with the community and my fellow humans.

[[SIZE 150%]]Diary / Journal / Blag Type Thing (Rarely Updated)[[/size]]
[[/=]]

[[collapsible show="On Giving & Giving & Giving" hide="5/27/17"]]
Welcome to "chapter one". I guess this is like my diary now. Public journal and diary. Shit, that's a blog... whatever, nah, this is what it is. It is what it is. Get ready for sad DarkStuff real world bullshit feelings.

Hmm, I need to have my name shortened for when I'm referencing real world scenarios. I guess I'll just be Dark, then. Uh, where do I start. Hmm. Well, I feel like a dick sometimes. And I know why. I surround myself with overly sensitive people who work more off of emotions than logic and I always value rationality over feelings. Thus I get into weird situations where a person tells me about a dream they had where they met a better version of their family, I commented "side note, did you have to crawl through a previously bricked off door in your house to get to them?" and they say "what?" and I explain it's a Coraline reference and they get all sad. I ask "why sad", and they say "sometimes making fun of things that are important to people feels a little belittling, Dark".

My brain immediately goes to "where in there was it mentioned as something of great importance, I understand it was a very nice dream and I was making a reference", but of course I didn't say that. "I wasn't trying to make fun of it, I'm sorry if it came off that way" so said I. They responded "right", and I responded "I'm sorry" and they said "thank you for apologizing". And I have many, many interactions like this, mostly with this person and their friend group. I... really love them and care about them, but their impulsive irrational nature and depressed personality combine into a concoction that makes it hard for me to interact with them, that and how they have stated many a times before that I don't help them.

I help them god damn it. They have stressed about going home to face their mom, not because there was something particularly bad going to happen but because their mom is always oppressive and overbearing and constantly yelling at them. They couldn't come to my house because there were no chaperones, so I worked my ass off to get a family friend to pick us up and be the chaperone for us at their house. It was ridiculous, talking to my friend's mom and coordinating with this other family friend, it took all school day and I ran out of battery on my phone doing it //just// as the mom said "that's alright". We got picked up, had a heart to heart at my family friend's house, and then my friend went home feeling much better.

And I have never once gotten thanked for that. In fact, it has never been brought up again. I work a thankless job, putting all within my power into helping them, and their online friends who only talk to them exactly like I do don't get //thanked// mind you, but my friend goes to them first. I am their only in real life friend, and as soon as some grueling task I take is over and done with, my friend promptly forgets about it, ignores my everlasting support for them, and continues to be sad over small things. They don't recognize any form of support, I believe.

I can't live with that. That is a toxic... way of life, and I know they can't help the way they are. They can't help being sad, and I don't want them to be sad, and I work to make them not sad, but god fucking damn it they can be more aware when //everyone is conspiring in their favor in everlasting support//. Me, my friends, their friends online, a group of adults who didn't know them personally fought for them specifically because they had a touching experience of how much my friend struggles with school, and they don't ever acknowledge it.

And I know why I'm tethered to them. I'm tethered to them because they got me out of a deep, endless depression. We entered a relationship, which was exactly what I needed, I had my first really intimate interactions with them, and we split off when they found someone else. It was a painless break up, and we remained extremely close friends. We are still - in a weird way that is consensual with everyone, even their new significant other - intimate with each other, because honestly... that's what we befriended over. There are many other things that make me think they have the potential to be wonderful - they are always willing to help others, they are a phenomenal artist, fantastic writer, and they get so passionate over their geekdoms it's impossible not to get roped into their hobbies with them.

I... I don't want to lose my window into the sexual world, and I don't want to lose a very close friend right now. Neither of those are things I feel I'd be better without. But I also can't afford to have interactions like this every other day. Things that take me from my baseline positive demeanor to a pit of inactivity and depression. I can't make a decision. My decisions are to stop caring for them but continue to go do stuff with them, which is shallow, or break things off and leave them with no IRL friends. It hurts. And I need to make a decision. But I don't know the decision to make. Especially because I think if they were just more aware of how much people loved them, they'd be less sad. But they're seemingly oblivious to all signs of compassion and empathy towards them. It's a one way street of giving and no receiving. I don't know what to do.

I love being made fun of by people I respect and look up to in front of people I respect and look up to, Jesus I made a total ass of myself. I... am confused. I don't know if I'm wrong or they're wrong or if I wasn't listening to them or they weren't listening to me, but if none of these are true than what even happened? I thought I wasn't being volatile, I thought I was respectfully communicating my feeling, and I even stated at one point that I might be wrong. Anyone might be wrong. Opinions and beliefs are malleable, and honestly everything is created by culture, so right and wrong are completely subjective. So nobody was wrong. Scratch what I said earlier.

I can't not talk to people, and I don't want to feel like I must keep my beliefs to myself. But I don't know where to put my energy. I feel... disliked. I don't want to alienate people, but I'm not sure if I'm willing to do that if it means limiting my speech. I dunno, I'm feeling shaky.

[[collapsible show="God Fucking Damn It Cont." hide="5/29/17"]]
Ugh, sigh, jeez, insert further exasperated expression. I hate having to look at people differently. On the other hand, nah, I'm not hiding my beliefs and opinions. Absolutely //fuck// that. I find respectful disagreement, and discourse with people who respectfully disagree with you, the best way to find new ideas and flaws in your own ideas. When you try to preach non-violence and say that "you can't kill an idea with violence, you kill an idea with education" and someone responds by calling you out as "emotionally constipated", keeping your beliefs to yourself because of it is exactly what not to do. Fuck that. Fuck. //That//.

I might be wrong. I might be //totally// wrong. But so might you, and so might others, so you know what? I'm gonna be loud and proud. Violence incites more violence, defend yourself but preach before you go off "killing transphobes". Work within the system. Teach. //Teach//. It's a long fucking system, but it works. Guess who has gay marriage now? Guess who has free blacks now?

Guess what's never gonna go away? Assholes and terrible human beings. Killing every last one of them isn't going to make them go away. Why? Because by killing them you are becoming another asshole. Reasons why I might be wrong? Well... Well. I haven't been oppressed before. The most I've ever been "oppressed" is being called a girl. That's like... nothing. It's not even oppression. At all. And that's why I mentioned it that way; I have nowhere near the experience that other people have had. That and I live in California, the most liberal and accepting of all the states. So yes! I have an outsider point of view. But that's allowable.

Do I have to go to war to have feelings about it? Do I have to have made a movie to be able to criticize one? Must I paint a lovely piece of art before I can interpret them? No. The answer is no. Would having done those things helped? Yes. Yes they would have. But they aren't necessary, and you can't act like my opinions are irrelevant because I haven't been there myself. My opinions may change. So may yours. But neither of us will get anywhere if we don't take it calmly and respectfully, and refrain from taking it so fucking //personal//. Like I am. Right now.

Whoops... alright, I have expressed my feeling. I, DarkStuff, Dark for short, wholeheartedly promise to listen to the voices of others, contemplate their world views, and analyze why their ideas may or may not work, with a non partisan point of view. I will recognize their experiences, where they come from, and where my own opinions come from and why they may or may not be wrong. I recognize that everything anyone thinks comes from somewhere. Yes, even the assholes of the world. Even the sexists, the racists, the homophobes. They all have reasons as well.

The main point is people are people. Good and bad is subjective. I think one way, you think another, neither of us are right because we aren't arguing facts we are arguing opinions. The world keeps turning whether or not we think one way or another. Whether we're ruled by fear or by incentive. Whether we love or hate. Whether we accept or reject. In the grand scheme of things, we don't even matter. That got a bit nihilist. But you get the point.

In fact, if you disagree with me but can present yourself in a respectful manner, shoot dude, send me a PM! I'd love to talk with someone like that. With the knowledge that neither of us are pushing our beliefs on each other, that we are simply articulating the whats and whys. And here, [[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muf3XYTXfHk |have a video that I consider to be a perfect example of respectfully disagreeing.]]] Not a single voice is raised. He preaches free speech. And yet he thinks something I think we //all// agree is fundamentally evil. And yet... just watch it. You'll see what I mean.

Phew! That was cathartic. Sorry if I felt a little angry in there. If I'm being honest, it's because I was. I felt like I was attacked for my beliefs. Maybe I wasn't. Who knows. Humans are humans and feelings are feelings and strong emotions shape memories. And I'm also sorry if it felt like I attacked anyone in particular. I think I made sure not to. Alright. I'm done.

Culture is awesome sometimes. US culture is more often than not, //not// awesome. This is very apparent on gender norms. Now, I must preface this with this: women have it worse. Like, holy shit, //way// worse. Patriarchy is a bitch. I am not arguing that, even slightly. I am going to point out that men have their own little cultural norms as well.

When you hear that, you'll probably agree, and think "well yeah, they need to be //strong// and not show their //feelings// and be in //control// and yaddah yaddah yaddah". Well, see, I don't feel any of those things. I am a totally open book, and I am quite emotional, and if I'm being honest, I'm the submissive type. Oh, and I'm flimsy as fuck. If //anyone// says "I can beat you in a fight" I will not argue you for even a second, no matter your muscle mass or size. You'll probably win. And I don't feel pressured to be any of those things. I mean, being able to lift things would be nice, but as long as I'm alive and well I don't feel the need to lift weights every day. I have better things to do.

No, I think I've had a pretty unique experience of getting an insecurity from the culture, and it's that I feel... gross. I don't feel okay with my body. I think I have an okay face (how I see myself depends on the day), I don't feel flabby or fat (pretty average build), sometimes I feel a little unhygienic (but of course that's when I //am// and it's my fault), but I always feel uncomfortable with being naked. Or showing anyone any of that. The two situations I feel alright with being undressed is in bed or in the shower, and I take quick showers and I have to be //really// hot and sweaty for me to take anything off in bed.

Friends (mostly one that may or may not join the site, that'd be cool!) have told me that that feels... weird. Because most often I seem very confident and that I communicate an air of high self esteem. Which I do. Because in general, I have high self esteem. It's just my body. So how did I get this insecurity, and why do I blame culture? 'Cause of a couple of generalities. Unsolicited dick pics are the worst thing possible, and you're an asshole for sending them. Unsolicited nudes from gals are welcome and make people (mostly straight guys I admit) feel better. Women, flaunt your stuff! Guys, keep it in your pants. "Dicks are gross!" (-Aziz Ansari), and it's a regular occurrence for you to see gals grab each other's boobs (at least where I'm from, and I understand that's more my age group and not in general).

And I think I understand where all of this came from. Girls used to be more suppressed, and guys were the people who were able to go do whatever and get away with it. Over time, there was a cultural reaction, and a sort of reversal of roles. Not a total reversal mind you, women are //still// fighting for rights, and people are //still// being total assholes to them just for their gender, so sometimes I feel like I shouldn't really complain about this insecurity of mine because I feel a little guilty about it. But now if a girl reaches down your pants it's sexy and you're an idiot for pulling away, but if you reach up their shirt they have every right to scream bloody murder. So... what's the fix?

Well, go one way or the other. We are in the middle where genders get different privileges over one another. Either nobody gets to touch each other without permission, or everyone gets to everywhere. I don't much care which (might get more into that at a later point), but if that was the culture we grew up in that would have been better. Equality, you know? At this point, I feel like nobody wants to see it. Put it away, it's gross, you have to be very close to someone for it to even be an option, don't be that one overconfident misogynistic asshole by talking about your dick... it's like, I wouldn't have done any of these things anyways, but the constant pounding message that anything to do with your genitalia is wrong and gross and disgusting has really, really worked its way into my psyche and grown roots that extend across my whole cranium. The first time someone wanted to get naked with me I cried.

Sometimes, I really hate the culture.

[[collapsible show="On Past Mistakes" hide="6/1/17"]]
I had a really good friend, let's name them... Tick. Tick or Lick. I think I'll stick with Tick, and cool that rhymed. You prick! I picked this trick, I'll stick with Tick. Okay I'm done. But I had this friend. I've known them since 4th Grade, so we've been friends for quite a long time. They were my very best friend until about 9th Grade, when I started to sort of readjust my friend group.

However, 9th Grade was when I started getting super depressed. Ridiculously down in the dumps. This lasted until 10th Grade, second semester, when my friend I talked about in "On Giving & Giving & Giving" picked me up. I mean, I was pulling out of my depression before then but they helped immensely. Anyways, that's a story for another day. Anyways, I am an introvert, so I like to have a small but extremely close group of friends. I found out through a friend of them that they weren't sharing everything with me.

"Woah!" I said, "what and why?" And then I got into a very heated argument with them that ended in a couple days of uncomfortable glances that were thankfully cut off by winter break. When school started up again, we were chummy as usual, but we barely texted and we never talked outside of school. I always sort of thought this was all their fault for keeping things from me, and not just keeping things, outright lying to me about certain things.

Now I am not depressed, and have a clearer head. I have discovered a couple of things - not from asking around, but by looking inside myself. Firstly, it is absolutely reasonable for someone to not want to tell you everything (I am certain every single person reading this is going to say "no fucking duh" but such is life). This is especially true because they are an extrovert and thus have a lot of friends for different things, and they had already told me that I was their goofy friend that they hung out with to try and get //away// from their problems, not confront them. They had / have other friends for that. Secondly, they really did trust me with some very personal, sensitive information. Stuff that I will not divulge, but some stuff that I'm sure they wouldn't share with just anybody. At the time it irked me that I learned about this stuff so late (some of it happened in 7th Grade and I learned of it this year), but it occurs to me now how they thought about it. To them, I am their escape (or was). They don't want to confront their feelings while with me, that was not my purpose. But they still really trusted me, so they would just give me sensitive information after the fact, when all their feelings had already been worked through. They //did// trust me, they just didn't think of me as that friend. Thirdly, I realized how god damn pushy I was.

I was //so// pushy and abrasive, when it came to personal information from my friends it was hard for me to take no for an answer. This person had known me since 4th Grade, and I think they figured out it was easier to make shit up then try to get me to lay off every single time. If this was mild before I got depressed, it was severe nearing the end of that period of my life. I was in the wrong head space to do anything, and I felt like screaming at people every second of every day. It came to my attention that my friend hasn't been sharing everything with me, and I freaked. I don't remember the specifics of the conversation, but I said something about them having to "man up and face their fears" and they said something back that I can only vaguely recall but I remember cutting very, very deeply. Of course, they were being defensive because I was being offensive, and at the time (and for another couple months) I didn't really get this. I just sort of accepted that they were always a jerk to me and that I was in the right.

Which I really wasn't. In fact, I am looking to apologize today, as it has been weighing on my consciousness and just recently we had a long conversation over text planning on hanging out again. I don't know how much they remember the exchange, or if they were cognizant that it was the reason I didn't put much energy into hanging out with them for a while, but I need to apologize anyways. I can't let this sit in my head any longer. I'm gonna try and make up for past mistakes, and then maybe we can be as close as we were before. That would be very nice.

I don't know what I'm about to write, but I'm going to write it. I'm in a very bad place and writing and drawing are cathartic and help vent out the feelings. I can already feel myself ever so subtly calming down, though I don't imagine that will last much past after I finish writing this.

It's finals week, finals start tomorrow. After that, it's summer, and four days into summer I leave to Arizona to give immigrants across the border water and food after they cross the desert. I'll be there with my brother and a couple of friends. It'll be hot and ridiculous and I have no idea how I'll feel. Last time I was on a trip away from home I broke down. Feeling disconnected from everything, like I have no say in what happens because it's not happening near me, that's for sure. Out of my control. I've been feeling my heartbeat in my gut, and I haven't been eating much. I hear that's a normal depressive thing. Right now is the //worst// time to be relapsing into depression. I haven't been studying for finals, I haven't been doing the work, I've totally crumbled. I don't have good grades that I can use as crutches either, if I don't do well this week I might fail. That's unacceptable. What I thought was a bug bite on my arm is suddenly very large and very red. Looks to be a sunburn. How'd that happen?

I have an album I listen to when I'm sad, it seems impossible to remain unhappy while listening to it. Unfortunately, it's a temporary solution. Lemon Demon's Spirit Phone is an amazing album, probably the best of 2016. I have most songs on it memorized. The best ones are Cabinet Man, Sweet Bod, and Spiral of Ants. Oh, and Reaganomics. Because holy shit, Reaganomics. If you're a fan of lyrics that have actual substance and tell weird twisted stories combined with electronic dance music on top of intentional cluster chords to make it sound intentionally choppy and odd. It's quite the combination. I first listened to it when I was having a terrible time last year.

It was first semester of this school year, and I was crying in bed. I don't remember what exactly it was this specific time. But it wasn't good. My friend, the one I talked of in "On Past Mistakes", let's call them... Tanooki. He had been raving about this album day in and day out. I have never been huge on music (though I have oddly specific tastes, I'll get into that at a later date), but I was in a terrible spot and I needed something to distract me. I remembered Lemon Demon's Spirit Phone, and I thought "fuck it, I need //something//". I put it on. I can't communicate the effect it had on me.

Every song made me just a little less stressed, just a little happier, a little more optimistic. I don't know if there's even a rationale to why it worked so well on me. I just listened and it... worked. It made things click. It marks the turning point for when I started pulling out of that depression. It is now a regular ritual to listen to the album all the way through when I start getting sucked back in. It's not working as well right now. Which worries me. I don't know how this summer is going to go, but my bet is set on badly. Even if it doesn't, I feel like I might perceive it that way. I'm holding people back. Things are out of my hands. I'm letting people down. All this and more on the next episode of Dark barfs his feelings at the internet! I really hope I'm wrong.

[[collapsible show="On Doggy Hardships" hide="6/15/17"]]
I have a dog whose name is Sasha. Sasha is adorable and I love her lots, and she is a pure bred golden retriever. At the moment, she is six years of age, and we (the family) got her as a Yule present (December 21st, I'll go into my family's holidays another time) in 20...12? 2011, because she's six and will turn seven this Yule. She is aggressively loving, and she used to piss herself with excitement when she met new people because she was //so fucking happy to be meeting someone oh my fucking god//. She must be half gopher with how much she digs, and she must have two brain cells for how god damn stupid she is, and we love her to death.

One year into having her, I came home from the store with my dad and saw her convulsing and frothing on the deck. We had no idea what was happening, and thought she must have been dying or something, and it was one of the most confusing, panic inducing moments in my life. After she stopped, she laid for a bit, heaving, and then bit my dad (who was at her side) when she came to, startled at there being someone there. She acted weird and out of it, smelled like fish, and drooled extensively, not responding to her name or any commands for a good thirty minutes. We took her to the vet, and found out that we had witnessed a seizure, and that pure bred golden retrievers had high probability for epilepsy. We got her on pills which kept the seizures at bay, but she still had a seizure once every three or four months (which was normal and we knew how to deal with). Life was good.

Recently, perfectly a week from the time of writing this, Sasha had what is called a "cluster seizure". She had had no seizures for an entire year, and then in the span of eight hours she had eight seizures. She shat and pissed everywhere, fell down the stairs while seizing twice, and we think she hit her head hard on a heavy pool table leg. The next morning, she barely moved and didn't respond to her name. Her breathing was erratic, her eyes were out of focus, and she didn't eat or drink. We took her to the vet, they said we needed to take her to a dog hospital, which we did.

I wish I could have written this during that time so you could have gotten a full scope on the feelings associated with thinking you were going to, quite out of the blue, put your dog down. I can't even describe it right now, but I don't think I had a typical reaction. When the problem came into perspective, I "pre-grieved". I figured that it was the most likely option, so I should accept it as fact so it doesn't hit me that much harder. In two days, I had accepted it, and detached my feelings from the business of paying for the dog to stay another night in the hospital with little improvement. Thankfully, though, she got better, and we got her back... two days ago. Right? Today is Thursday, we got her back on Tuesday. She has trouble walking now, and had diarrhea for a while, but she is alive with limited brain damage. We have her on new medication, and everything is sailing smoothly as far as I can tell. If she has another cluster seizure in the future, there's no chance for her, and the probability of that happening before she dies of something else like old age is about 50/50.

All we can do now is hope. The whole situation happened right before summer break, and it was quite possibly the worst way to start out. This summer is shaping up to be quite dreadful. But right now I am in Arizona learning about immigration, so I will have something to write about after Monday, so that will be very fun.

As I expected, the longer this goes on the more spread out my little entries are. The excitement of having an author's page was too great, and I geeked out and put a lot of entries in a short amolunt of time. This trip got me out of the groove of making entries, but I'm back! I don't think anybody is reading this yet. Hopefully at some point I get "followers", but at the same time I'm not gonna advertise this because I feel like I'm gonna say //something// that //someone// doesn't appreciate and get into arguments with people over the internet. But I also want to have some deep thoughtful discussions with people who disagree with me, and... what am I talking about? I think I've already said this stuff. I am now repeating my self.

So I went to Arizona to meet up with an organization called Borderlinks in Tucson with a combination of my church group and two others. Church being Unitarian Universalist, a very hippie religion that, I shit you not, teaches that you can believe in any higher power or none at all. It is, like I perceive Buddhism, more of a spiritual practice than a religion. Anyways, my church youth group combined with the youth group from Reno, Nevada and two people from Albuquerque, New Mexico. We stayed in these makeshift rooms (didn't have ceilings, were actually just sections of a much bigger room) at the Borderlinks headquarters. Borderlinks is ran by two charitable individuals, Maico (also known as Michael) and Josue. For those who don't know, Borderlinks is an organization that takes volunteers to go out into the desert and drop water and food at dropoff points in the desert (to keep migrants alive as they try to cross the border illegally), and educate visitors on the problems of the US-Mexico border.

It was extraordinarily informative. A lot of stuff that I won't go into right now, but stuff about the detention centers, how there is a financial drive to incarcerate illegal immigrants, all these laws that aren't being followed and the reasons why people migrate to the United States. Lots of very useful information. A lot of the people who came on the trip have cited it as a "life changing experience", motivating them to do more charity work on the border and give immigrants sanctuary in their churches (a thing that is pretty common and works fairly well, but is not without some heavy downsides). I, however, peeled away with just more information. I already knew things were bad, now I know how they're bad. Useful, very useful, but not life changing. I had some things confirmed, I was taught about Operation Streamline and got to sit in on a court that ran through 62 immigrants in just over an hour, I was told stories of what it has taken for people to cross the border and why they did it and would do it again, I even got schooled on Standing Rock for some reason near the end, but it was all information to me. I analyzed it where others //experienced// it. I think both ways of perceiving the trip are useful... but a lot of people didn't notice that we were getting a very one sided approach.

All of what we heard was from illegal immigrants, sympathizers, charity workers, and activists. You know, the people who I am more likely to agree with. But it's just that - I am more likely to agree with them. There was no talking to a Trump supporter, or to a border patrol agent, or to one of the judges (though we got to talk to an attorney). We saw no analytics on how migrants //hurt// the economy or anything, only how they helped. I took in all of it, but it left me very dissatisfied. The only context that they brought up the other side is to find how to better argue their own point against theirs. There was no real consideration of the other side. Our tour was led by people who were here to teach only their side of things, because they have a personal connection to having everything one way. Why would you acknowledge the other side if it means that you might make some people disagree with you when you can play off of their feelings and drag them into your side before they can take in everything?

Yeesh, alright, that was cynical. See, I don't think they thought of it like that. There was no point when Maico and Josue said to themselves "We shouldn't tell them of the other side because they could agree with it." They were only telling us their views and what they knew and found important. But people need to see everything from both sides. I want to know why an educated, not misinformed individual might want strict closed borders. I want to know what compels people to go into the desert and slash the water reserves left for the immigrants. And I didn't get any of that. In fact, how one sided the presentation was leaves me with this disposition to distrust some of it. And there was a disproportionate amount of sob stories to facts and analytics. You can't work purely on ethics, damn it. If I met every single immigrant that crossed the border and heard their story in depth, I bet you that I would say 95% or more of them deserved to come into America. But is that the right decision? Well, I don't know, because I wasn't shown both sides. But it easily might not be. Why should the government spend money on people that aren't its own?

And yes, there needs to be a better process for people to get into America legally, but we also need to focus a little less on charity and a little more on justice. If you keep taking people in and keeping them alive so they don't die in the desert and that's all you do, they're going to keep coming. If you get rid of the reason that they are going through exodus from Mexico, Honduras, or otherwise, then you won't have to sit out in the desert and save people anymore because they will be happy where they are. That's a more noble goal to me. That and changing the laws here to support safe passage and easier legalization processes. Anyways, it's a tough situation, and I don't feel informed enough to give many opinions except my opinion on how much I don't like how uninformed I am. Urgh.

And I hear people saying that I should look stuff up, but information purely from some random sources on the internet is exactly how misinformation spreads. I would much rather hear multiple educated experts hold an open discussion in person and have input and be able to ask my own questions, hopefully not in a government run organization (because look who's in power). You know, less bias. I'd rather read a history paper on how slavery affected the economy and social climate than how bad and terrible it is while citing how bad and terrible it is. I know it's bad and terrible! I agree with you! But when you are so obviously fueled by emotion and bias I figure that you are not a //trustworthy source!// Augh!

Okay. Sorry, rant over. The slavery thing was a paper I read in my AP World History class last school year (yay for summer). Anyways... How about I actually start writing some of the stories of what went down? We went into Mexico and met four sisters who ran an organization called the House of Mercy (I don't remember the Spanish name, I am not bilingual like my brother is). They help give people rations before they cross the border, and they fight for women's rights in Mexico. Their headquarters are in the rural area of Nogales, Mexico (as opposed to Nogales, Arizona, it's a border town). They are more well off than many around them, but the key word is "more". If their house were in America, it would still be in poverty. In fact, the entire city of Nogales felt like a bad neighborhood, with police officers toting submachine guns and a man in the back of a truck holding a gatling gun and watching the crowd of people absent mindedly walking by. It was... interesting. Anyways, seeing these four sisters who still didn't have much continuing to give and help was very uplifting and heart warming. And we had home made Mexican food, which was very nice. They had a wonderful adorable dog named Kaiser, which rivals my own dog in cuteness and greatness, but far surpasses her in cuddliness and sweetness. It was pretty great.

Okay, more stories... well, we got a talking to by a Honduras migrant named Derek. He told us the story of how he came by train hopping, sleeping in the desert, and how he got held up by cartels at gun point to have his shoes and food and water taken away. He passed through the desert, got chased off by //Mexican// border patrol and lost even more rations and got lost in the desert, and then he saw US border patrol and ran again. He found a neighborhood and walked door to door asking for shelter, had many turn him away, some sicked dogs on him, and eventually he was so exhausted he just fell asleep on some doorstep. The story goes on, but you can imagine he finds shelter and eventually he ended up living with Maico through some legal loophole (he has a deportation notice but he's a low priority for some reason). The two things that really stuck with me were that he was smiling and glowing, very positive about his story, and that he ended by repeating very astutely that he would go through it all again if he gets deported. It wasn't tears, or how badly he was living, or his story about why he left that stuck with me, it's that he would do it again. His horrible fucking experience and he'd traverse the same roads in a heartbeat if it meant ending up back in the States. It sticks with me that on this trip, the American Dream has never felt stronger than in the hearts of those who don't live here.

The other thing that I found was a connection with some people I knew on a friendly basis but I only now call my friends. I know a... hmm, let's call them Mushroom (or Mush) and Kite. They are gals, and I've known Mush for a long time but haven't talked to her much. At some point she came into my room and said "I'm bored", to which I replied "Cuddles?" and she said "Yes, actually. But your bed is small. Let's get a group and make a cuddle puddle." This caught me very off guard, but you know what, of course I was gonna do that. She gathered me, Kite, and two friends who I'll call Lucky and Faz (they're brothers, eventually you'll start remembering the entire cast of characters in my life - so far it's Kat from "Giving & Giving & Giving", Mush, Lucky, Faz, Tanooki, and of course me, Dark) and we got some blankets and pillows and made a big cuddle puddle in the "conference room". It was very warm, comfortable, and very enjoyable. Needless to say, I started talking to Mush and Kite, and found that they were very cool. That night Lucky and I hung out a lot more with Kite, and she's very cool. Lucky had never had a cuddle buddy before, so he attached to her like a... well, I don't want to say leech, because he wasn't that intrusive, but you know. He focused his attention there. And later that night, at bed time, Mush, Faz and I fell asleep in a little cuddle puddle. Mush let me rub her legs 'cause it calmed her down, and I played with Faz's hair. Both conked out pretty hard. Unfortunately, the position gave me a kink in my neck, and at like 2:00 in the morning I finally had to gently remove myself from the puddle and get into an actual bed. Mush woke up later and got into her own bed because removing myself from the equation meant she had no source of warmth. Faz stayed there and only noticed he was alone when he woke in the morning. Still was very nice.

I now text Kite a lot, and I should probably message Mush more. She's cool, and cuddle buddies are always appreciated. Anyways, that's //still// a gross over simplification of the trip, but I covered a lot, and maybe if I feel the need I'll talk about the rest of it. I am certain of one part I'll get to writing about in the future, but that's exactly as I said, in the future. The end!

[[collapsible show="I Exploded" hide="7/8/17"]]
...On second thought, I will write this in the morning, on 7/6/17. I am about to listen to an album and enter a trance like state, in which I will stare out into the darkness of my room with calmness and serenity, contemplating life. I will report back here in the morning.

...Whoops, I waited two entire days. Wow. Anyways, all of the emotions that have been building that I described in my very first entry here, "On Giving & Giving & Giving", finally exploded. My friend Kat was getting sad on me, and as usual they started sorta insulting me. They went "grr rarr fire brimstone", to which I replied "//GRR RARR FIRE BRIMSTONE//". I totally blew up on them and all the bottled up feelings spilled out, and this person who was really stressed and volatile before became suddenly calm. After I erupted, they calmed me down and we actually had a very mature discussion. We decided to remain friends, they thanked me for being honest with them, and they finally, //finally// apologized to me. About anything. For once. I was extremely grateful. It was a very emotional conversation. We both cried. It turned out better than I could have ever imagined it would, we're still planning on hanging out over the summer and figure things out. It's very nice.

If I had written this immediately after I experienced it, which I didn't because I needed to air out, I would have had more to say. All I can say right now is that I am very happy with the situation. And, as they pointed out to me, I shouldn't let things build up that badly anymore. I should just say what's on my mind. Which is true. I should.

[[collapsible show="Primitive Dream Journal" hide="7/31/17"]]
Well, I don't remember most of my dreams. But sometimes I have visions of them in my head for a couple hours after being awake, and I lose them the longer I wait. Which sucks, 'cause most of my dreams are a very special flavor of holy shit //weird//. So, I'm about to write the dream I just dreamt so it doesn't escape me.

I, along with my family, were staying in a huge hotel room. It feels somewhat futuristic, and almost apartment sized, but I knew that it was a hotel room. Looking out the two wall sized windows, you could see a view of an enormous city covered by fog, and looking down you could tell that the building we were in was absolutely monolithic. The largest structure made by man. The next thing I remember is that I was alone, walking through the hallways and enormous rooms of this place (but only on our floor, which was still massive). There were large sections of empty rooms, and very sparsely populated areas. The only areas that seemed to have a really consistent number of people were the elevators and the bathrooms. Otherwise, trying to follow someone back to their room resulted in losing them and possibly getting lost yourself.

However, while I was walking around, I slowly realised that I desperately needed to go to the bathroom. I made my way that direction, and when I got there I realized that I didn't want to use a public urinal if anyone else was in there (I, Dark, have a heavy aversion to public bathrooms), but my hotel room was much too far away. I had to wait. I laid down my computer bag (which I imagine I had been carrying this whole time?) and take off my hoodie (because the place was extremely chilly) and sit down. Soon, though, I see my brother peek out from the woman's bathroom and motion me inside. I look suitably confused and don't follow the instruction, instead retreating to my phone to answer a stray text. I look up again when Mush (from Arizona & Mexico Trip) wandered into the bathroom and then motioned me inside. I get up, leaving my computer and hoodie, and finally, nervously, walk inside. The bathroom turns out to be an abandoned computer room, the smallest room I've seen in this entire place. I shoot my brother (and his friend who he's sitting with) an odd look, and he... Okay, the dream gets fuzzy. I know he gave a nonsensical explanation, that didn't clear anything up, but made me accept the fact that it was a computer lab.

For some unknown reason, I lose all urge to use the bathroom. I'm suddenly looking forward to sitting down with my brother and two friends, but first I need to pick up my computer which I left outside. I go out, and... it's not there. I freak out a bit, and an older woman (forties, fifties?) confirms that it was stolen and the perpetrator ran off. There's no way of finding them now. The next thing I remember is walking with the woman down a //long// hallway, that has a ceiling so high that you can't see it when you look up. It is just darkness. I am on the verge of tears over losing my computer, citing that their was very important stuff on there (there isn't, really). I have the final confirmation -- "It was a light, brown greenish bag with tons of pockets." I yell "//fuck!//" at the top of my lungs and toss my coat (when did I get a coat) in anger. The coat, however, smacks someone right in the face, and I immediately start apologising profusely. It's an old, old woman with two extremely large duffel bags. She doesn't even turn to look at me as she removes the coat and tosses it on the floor.

I'm tearing up; my computer is gone and I just accidentally hit someone in anger. I continue to aim apologies at her, but she doesn't respond and continues to walk away in this long hallway. But eventually, she turns around, puts her two wheeled duffel bags in front of her, and sprints at me. Before I know it, she's knocked me back by blasting the corner of the topmost duffel bag into my chest. She continues to wheel it forward until the duffel bags are on top of me, slowly pushing me. It's now that I realise that the hallway has ended, and we are in a massive room that's circular, and has glass windows on all sides except the hallway side. She continues pushing me towards a floor to ceiling window, while I cry and yell apologies. She remains wordless. At the point where I am at the window, she finally talks in this old, haggy voice. It's a dream, and the words are vague, but I recognise it as a much more intimidatingly worded version of "I'm going to push you off!" repeated over and over again.

The glass starts to bend under the pressure, and all of a sudden the black and red duffel bags she was using to push me are now a red and black car that she is driving into my chest, hoping to break the bullet proof massive glass panel behind me and push me off, where I can fall to my death into the foggy city below. At this point I'm screaming, but not for help, yet more apologies for throwing the coat in her face. The glass looks only a couple moments from finally breaking, when someone picks up the car and throws it out of a different window (along with the woman who was driving it).I look up and see, through my teary eyes, three figures in triumphant poses, backlit from the hallway for a second. I ask "who are you?" They come into focus and are shown to be a little group of obvious superheroes. From left to right, they are wearing the same costume except one is green, the other is purple, and the third is red. The letters in the centers of their uniforms are D, U, and I. The leader in the middle says "We are DUI."

I am relieved for a small time, but then something strikes me. This(?) is exactly what I would have made with the vague important stuff on my computer. The crushing feeling of failure and stupidity strikes me again, and the dream ends with me crying with my back up against the glass, with three superheroes standing in front of me.

[[collapsible show="Outlet for Better Thinking, Homework Style" hide="8/3/17"]]
So I'm listening to music and trying to do homework. The homework is a summary of a speech called the "Spirit of Liberty" by Judge Learned Hand, in 1944. [*http://www.btboces.org/Downloads/1_The%20Spirit%20of%20Liberty%20by%20Learned%20Hand.pdfhttp://www.example.com Check it out] if you feel so inclined. Anyways, I am having a lot of trouble collecting my thoughts to summarize it. So I thought it might help to switch mediums. Maybe my psyche will handle "writing to the void, on a creative writing website" better than "writing a summary on a speech that didn't have that much of an impact on you". The idea is that, starting next paragraph, I'll copy and paste whatever I think up from here into a google docs and that'll be my assignment. Sound good? Cool. Oh, wait, I just want to plug this: [*https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXUbdn5mp3LrSh96F5U-ycF2lk44dhDTD the playlist I am listening to!] This music is all hand picked by me. It's all the stuff I enjoy listening to, minus video game soundtracks (everything that I listen to that has //lyrics//). It's a surprisingly small list right now, hopefully it will grow as I get more and more into music and find more and more stuff I like. Yeah, there is stuff I like that's not on this playlist, but I'm trying to collect my favorite stuff. Anyways, back to the task at hand.

So, here we are. Judge Learned Hand (what a name, by the way) made a speech about the Spirit of Liberty to be spoken aloud... somewhere, on "I Am An American Day" (later turned into "Civilian's Day", later turned into "No Longer a National Holiday... Day") in 1944. Of course, this was WWII, so we can imagine where this is going. Except... we don't. It goes a totally different direction than expected. Firstly, Mr. Hand here starts talking about how every single person here (in front of him, in the audience) is from a family of immigrants. I imagine there weren't many Native Americans there if that's how he talked, but I guess the leading theory is that Native Americans were immigrants from Asia way long ago. I doubt that he thought about that, though. Did //anyone// think about that very much at the time? Anyways, he was very obviously talking more recently, about all the people who immigrated here as pilgrims. The English, the French, the Irish, the yaddah yaddah. Europeans! Japanese were in internment camps at the time, there was sort of an anti-Asian bias at the time. Watch [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ_j2ielP1o this propaganda video] explaining "I Am An American Day" and you'll notice a distinct lack of Asians. You might also notice how the narrator says that America was "waiting for people to call it home", and very conveniently glosses over the natives.

Alright, alright, I'll stop looking at this from a 21st Century lens! It's making it hard to get through, seeing all the things that we consider bad now be so blatantly accepted and spread then. Whatever, at least they reveled in the fact that they were a country of immigrants. We're having a wee bit of trouble with that right now. Anyways, back to the speech! He talks about how we are all some shade of immigrant, and that we should be proud of that. Somewhere in our ancestry, someone who we are related to was brave enough to leave every single thing from their original country behind them to migrate to a new country, in the hopes of finding something better. He goes on to say that that takes a certain type of bravery and strength, and that we have a reason to be proud of having that in our genes (Americans are special and should feel special -- I say that sarcastically, but there is a shade of truth, though I can feel that the more complacent we get with being born so privileged the more these genes aren't going to make us any more brave or strong than anybody else in their high first world chair). So, he boosts everyone's morale with "we are all special". He goes on, and asks "but why did our people come here?" And then answers it with the pursuit of happiness and liberty. "But what's liberty?" He lets that sit and be a rhetorical question. It's annoying, but it serves the structure of the speech and he answers it later, so I say it's more than forgivable.

So he transitions into talking about how we may rely too much on laws. So, this part of the speech is kind of confusing. Not only in how he words it, but it's meaning is just... okay, well, it escaped //me// for a bit. Because I can be dumb. I suppose. Basically he's saying that "liberty lies in the hearts of all men and women" (way to be inclusive in 1944, props), and that "when it dies there it can not be saved by any constitution, law, or court." I am paraphrasing of course, these aren't direct quotes. What I was led to believe was that he's saying that a nation of demoralized people can't be saved by any law. Just because our government is built on the ideal of the pursuit of happiness doesn't mean that it will always come to you. It's kind of like saying putting the rapist in prison isn't gonna get rid of the scars, you know? Now, I got lost here because I had no clue how this was supposed to connect back to... anything, honestly. What's this have to do with anything? Well, with some research (and friendly guidance), I came to the conclusion of using //context!// Apparently at the time there was a big divide of whether we should go into the war or not. I knew that, but it didn't click that that's what this was talking about until someone pointed it out to me. He's basically saying that the divide between us isn't gonna be solved by any laws. We need to work through it. And we can! Because we're Americans! And we're special!

And then he's like, "everyone has the spirit of liberty!" And then he makes his little personal definition of liberty, which I am not gonna translate here. He starts taking a Christian angle, and makes references to some bible verses ("a crow does not fall to earth unheeded" for example). I think at this point he's saying that we need to come together? Not that we need to share opinions, but that we need to not think lesser of the other side even if we disagree with them (which I believe is a good message that a //lot// of people need to work on right now), because "we //all// have the spirit of liberty, guys! It's like the American holy ghost! Except we have that too!"

...My train of thought just crashed an burned. Maybe that was all I needed to say? Mr. Hand was like "come together, right now, over me" and people were like... "sure". Oh man. If you ever need a thorough literary analyzer, this is your guy! Hello, I would like to apply for a job reviewing great works of literature, please. Yes, I am the fabled master analyzer you've been hearing so much about. No, an autograph is not too much to ask for.

[[collapsible show="Back to School" hide="8/23/17"]]
Firstly, I am writing this instead of doing anything in my English class. I have a high distaste for my English class this year. Which I'll get to later. Anyways, school started last Wednesday for me, so a week ago. I kept feeling like I should write something about it but I never got around to it. On a separate note, right before I got back to school I had two small outings back to back seeing my auntie and my uncle on my mom's side. I should write about those, because I find those two people to be interesting characters. Anyways, this year in school! I have my friend Lugward in my school now. Previously, he went to a fledgling (and flailing) school, and apparently it was bad. He finally gave in to my pestering and switched schools. He likes this one a lot better.

Okay, so, my classes. I have, in order, Mr. Bread, Mr. Calf, Mr. Pirate, Ms. Space, Mr. Bacon, and Mr. Vacuum (yes, I made up all those names to protect their identities) which teach choir, drama, environmental science, US history, trigonometry, and English respectively. I'll start describing the goods and bads of each class in order. Here we go!

First of all, I have both the advanced choir and the normal boy's choir. The advanced choir meets before school starts, so I'm supposed to be at school at 7:30. I walk to school, so I have to leave my house between 7:00 and 7:15 and wake up at 5:45 or 6:00. It's not terrible when you get used to it, but it means I am often tired by the end of the school day. I have already fallen asleep in English (my last class of the day) twice. The advanced choir has far less boys than girls - about a 1:2.5 ratio. The tenor, tenor 2, baritone and bass sections all have only two boys. The soprano, soprano 2, alto and alto 2 sections all have four or five girls. This is a direct result of -- ah shit, I'm gonna finish this in a sec...

EDIT: //Dark never actually finished this. I thought of taking it out, but nah.//

[[collapsible show="Wilson's Wildlife Solutions" hide="4/9/18"]]
I promised myself I would make another one of these as soon as I got a tag for Wilson's Wildlife Solutions, the Group of Interest that I invented (name originally by [[*user Rimple]] though, credit where credit is due) in [[[SCP-3466]]] (original draft also by [[*user Rimple]], //credit where credit is due//). I don't know exactly what to put here, but I will say that this has been a very productive time. The time since the last entry here and now, that is. --Also I am going to have to leave and come back to this but oh well.-- I am back a day later to finish this. Whoops.

Anyways, so, Wilson's Wildlife Solutions became a tag, people are getting even more interested in writing it, I am super happy that it exists, I am getting some more upvotes due to its new [[[Wilson's Wildlife Solutions Hub|hub]]]! Which is damn neat. It's in the drop down at the top of the page, too. Real neat.

Also, D-11424, invented by [[*user weryllium]] and used in my collab article with him, [[[SCP-3379]]], has a tag now due to being //awesome//.

So... what has actually happened in my life? Well, I'm still single. That's not fun. Recently I've been feeling really bad about it. Uhh, various things have come of that... feeling? Especially since, like, everybody I am close with -- god, there goes my brain again! No, not everyone I am close with is in a relationship. My closest friend is just as single as I am. But the two people I have been friends with since middle school are in stable relationships, and god damn happy, and (I know this is petty) my crush from a while ago is in and out of relationships and doing well with it. I just feel stuck out in the water, or something like that.

I also have been trying to get back into writing Vend-a-Friend, and I am so close to finishing a tale, but I am stuck at the very end of it and having trouble working up the motivation to finish this tale and move on with it. I've actually hit a creative block, really, which sucks, sorta. I haven't written author commentary for 3379 yet, huh... I should do that.

Side chat has been getting more dramatic recently. Which sucks. Glad I'm not on #site19 anymore though. Jesus that place hurts my soul. Girlfriend hunt has been going poorly. Reading Brave New World has been going very well! So has Catcher in the Rye. One of them I'm reading for school, Brave New World I'm just reading on my own. I'm kind of afraid that I'm lapsing back into light depression? Nothing much has changed but I have been feeling pretty bad for a pretty long time (going on two weeks), and that's a little scary.

I think more has happened, but I'm in kind of a bad mood now, and so I am not thinking extremely straight, so getting words from my brain to paper (or in this case, screen) is a little difficult. I am looking forward to the growth of Wilson's Wildlife Solutions though. And making more music. That's about all I have to say.

[[collapsible show="Brief Return to the Site & My Break I Am Taking" hide="7/14/18"]]
I returned to the site to create [[[What a Wonderful World|And I Think To Myself...]]] and my SCP-4000 contest entry (which won't win but oh well). However, those two occurrences were my break... taking a break. I'm on a break from the site to make //music//! I have an album projected to come out in the following year (late 2018 or early to mid 2019) under the artist name Natural Language and the album will be called Artifice! I am so so happy to be putting some creative energy into that kind of stuff. That's why I haven't been writing so much, though since there is a lull in productivity on the album (waiting on someone to be back from the East Coast) I have written two things for the site.

What's been going on in my life? Well, still single. Summer ain't gonna help with that. Someone who I considered a very, very close friend sent me what boils down to an essay on why I am a shitty person, which made me cry, and we are not friends anymore, clearly. Has made for a shitty couple of days. Or, week.

I also have been in a play which has been fun. James & the Giant Peach. The dialogue is really not good, but the music is fun and being in it is fun and the set is above and beyond the expectations of community theater. So that's all good.

In this same edit I am going to add commentary to all the Vend-a-Friend chapters, plus add my new one. I expect to have to edit this again when my 4000 entry has a real spot on the Series V mainlist.

[[collapsible show="Junior Staff Promotion" hide="9/26/18"]]
I feel that getting promoted to Junior Staff, on the Critique Team (Butterfly Squad), was worth making a little post here. So, just, stuff. Album is going okay, we only need a guitarist and then we can start practicing. People don't respond to emails fast enough, which is really really annoying, but yeah, the worst part about making anything collaborative is organizing people.

That's just about it.

Okay, well, some more. Since I'm on the critique team, I'm gonna do one forum critique a day. So far it's been working. But I primarily do critique in #thecritters, an IRC channel. That way I can trade critique for reading my stuff, and that usually works out for me. In this way, I have gained, lemme see... I think... upwards of thirteen upvotes. The goal is to eventually get all my skips over +100 through the power of being a useful member of the SCP society. Which is cool.

Okay, //that's// just about it. Donezo.

//I had an idea called// "Wacky HTML" //sitting in my sandbox forever, and I just felt like trying to write an SCP again (it had been three months since my last SCP posting). I didn't want to come up with a new SCP concept, 'cause that would take too long and I had motivation// that very second! //So I wrote a rough draft up, and started to work. The idea was that I would prime an article to be perfect for an exploration log, or an interview log, and not have either of those. Subvert the expectation, and make a good SCP in other ways. In this case, it was literally a plot point that the Foundation didn't do an interview or an exploration log, because the idea was that they didn't care. They just wanted utility. So, I think that the concept was pulled off. How well it was pulled off is up to you, my dear reader~! Also, in the end [[*user Billith]] completely rewrote the containment procedures// and //description to include some better jargon and feel more clinical, so I couldn't not bless him with the collaborative author title. He also did tons of small edits to the grammar and wording, which all only worked to improve it, so he is a real cool dude. Love that guy.//

**{{Lessons Learned}}**
//Posting time is important. Also, don't feel bad if your article doesn't get as much attention as another article because you did not stoop to a clickbait title -- and for those knowing the article that I am referring to, I am not badmouthing it. It's a good article, and the title fits. But a "woah what" title is... well maybe I should do that, but I would feel bad doing that intentionally. My titles are very deliberate, and they shall not change the creative process behind them. Also, plugging. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes, five well spaced plugs will get you nowhere, and one half-assed plug will get you four new upvotes. Don't be discouraged by the plugs that don't work. Plug on, space cowboy.//

//This was my first successful skip. Though successful is subjective. First skip that wasn't downvoted to hell. I wanted something short and sweet, where a seemingly predictable anomaly throws the Foundation a curve ball and the Foundation misses.//

**{{Lessons Learned}}**
//You just have to work hard at it, and there is a method to see if it will succeed. A good draft critiquing method is to post the link to your sandbox and ask everyone to look at it and say if they would upvote. They don't have to give you a full review, just say whether they'd upvote. That works mighty fine.//

//I might as well just copy what I posted in the discussion page on this one, gimme a second here... okay here we go. I wanted a silent intangible war that was raging on that barely anybody could see. I didn't know the purpose of this war, and then I decided to make it more like a computer simulation. It honestly wasn't made with a message intended at first, but you know… you start talking about war and it's bound to happen. So through revision it was quite clearly guided in that direction.

//So I wrote this with a great guy named [[*user Uncle Nicolini]] and I am glad that I did. This was pretty damn fun to write. This basically came out of Nico having a draft about Wondertainment cereal that he didn't know how to finish, and I swooped in with some ideas, and then we decided to collab. Eventually it turned into a continuation of Judy the Tongue's story, as shown in the intermission episode of Vend-a-Friend entitled "And I Think To Myself...". I think it's a very cute way for the Foundation to have given Wondertainment a lot of money without thinking about it. It's also my first Wondertainment skip!//

**{{Lessons Learned}}**
//Maybe be more assertive about titles in collabs? Probably not, because it's of course an effort on both of your parts. I dunno. Something just doesn't sit right about having a generic Dr. Wondertainment skip title. But I'm weird about titles anyways. Perhaps, the lesson learned is that I am weird about skip titles. As if that was truly new information.//

//This one was wonky. Had an idea of some woodboring beetles fighting off a forest god, and then it became more beetle focused and less god focused, and then I realised I just liked the beetles more, so I removed the god entirely. I then had to find out what the "gimmick" was, and when I did that I realised the bugs didn't have to be sapient anymore, so I left it debatable. Many, many changes and an impatient author made this get posted a bit prematurely, and it's first impression suffered because of it. I worked in an addendum that gave more story and substance, but it was a bit late. Still proud of it though.//

//This was a collab that was technically in development since December, which means that it was "in development" for about four months. But really, we didn't work on it for a while, so it was finished in only about a week. Anyways, it's about a D-Class that explores an (spoiler) interdimensional meat market and is all snarky about it and (more spoilers)// lives! //So, that's pretty cool. It also made D-11424 get popular enough to get a tag, which is sweet! Also, also also, it means I have// two //articles tagged "art-exchange", and this is the first time in the Christmas art exchange history that the gifter and giftee have collaborated on the article that went up on the site. Got to work with [[*user weryllium]], who is one of my earliest friends on the site, so that made me pretty psyched. Just fun all around.//

**{{Lessons Learned}}**
//Not much to put here. I guess it is worth noting that even though D-11424 was supposed to be fun to read, some people found him very grating, but that's alright. This was written mostly for the fun of it, and not for upvotes... which is really how I should write most of the time anyways. I guess that's the lesson here. Also, collabs are fun.

//This was fun! I got it done in just one day (a lot shorter than most of my stuff) and it is my second Wilson's Wildlife Solutions article. The idea was this: I wanted to do something interesting with an object class. That became less of the focus as I went through development, but the name is still a pun on the situation. I also really enjoyed writing inter-GoI (including the SCP Foundation as a GoI) relations. It's fun to do! And I also felt like I didn't// just //tack on Site-64 to this one, I actually used some of the Site-64 established lore (think "scary robot stuff" and the names of the people who worked there).

//This was crazy fun to write. It happened out of a draft swap, an experiment put on by [[*user Rimple]] and [[*user Rat Lord]] that might turn into a regular thing, in which I got given [[*user Rimple]]'s draft where the basis was crows that ran a Burger King. Rimple already had notes asking for a call transcript, and then a log of going into the Burger King and ordering stuff (and some notes on how the crows treated customers). He also had a one off line mentioning Wilson's Wildlife Solutions. Everything past that is yours truly (though there are entire untouched sentences in the description that came from Rimple's draft). It was awesome to work with because I already had a base. The extra motivation let me pump this thing out in less than a week (from Monday to Saturday). Love every part of this. Especially loved writing Wilson's Wildlife... they may appear again in the future...//

//This is a collab with [[*user Roget]], and my third Wilson's Wildlife skip (fourth Wilson's Wildlife article, not including their hub). I'm honestly not sure how this came to fruition? I think Roget approached me and said "hey dude we should collab" and then I said "what on" and he said "something Wilson's Wildlife" and I was like "ooh I have an idea for a Wilson's Wildlife// reserve//" and he said "dope" and then we did it.

//This was a collab with [[*user Captain Kirby]], which was heavily inspired by my [[[SCP-3713]]]. In fact, that's kind of what makes this cool.

//This is my first// proper //collaboration on a fiction article. The [[[Dr. Wondertainment Hub]]] that I pulled off with [[*user taylor_itkin]] was definitely a proper collab, but it wasn't for an SCP, and [[[SCP-1549]]], while a collab with [[*user Billith]], that was more an honorary collab recognizing how much he contributed in the process than this. No, this was a real true SCP collab. We had an idea and we built it from the ground up with each other -- myself and [[*user Rat Lord]], that is. Writing this took a couple months (from November to the time of writing, which would be... March. Yes, I had to think about that for a second, don't judge me. Or do. Anyways...). I had the base idea, Vara had a real solid plot idea and a dream that we wanted to integrate (heavy inspiration for the video log), and yeah! Super fun. Also, for anyone interested,// {{there are more secrets here than first meet the eye}}. //Try to find them. Wink.//

//Collaborating all properly like this is pretty fucking rad, and even without getting a huge amount of upvotes I find myself not caring so much because it is just a testament to how fun a collaborative project is. Ignore the "not a huge amount of upvotes" if you are reading from a future where this is real highly rated (I don't go back and edit these sections after I write them).

//So expect all the commentaries on these chapters to be relatively short. However, I can use this space to comment on Vend-a-Friend as a whole for a second. Vend-a-Friend was an idea that I have had for a very, very long time, perhaps since before I wrote my first article, SCP-2728. Before I wrote Vend-a-Friend, I wasn't even a huge Wondertainment fan. The idea was to A) successfully write a tale series (score) and B) make a very dark Wondertainment plot (something I thought didn't exist because I was a fledgling SCP fan). I don't remember exactly what sparked actually writing it. It might have just been me wanting to write tales, and being tired of writing SCPs, and going "so what tale ideas do I have...". Anyways, what I never expected was to become super involved with creating Dr. Wondertainment lore (as I found I didn't particularly enjoy any currently existing headcanons), or create its hub, or be the second most prolific Dr. Wondertainment author on the site right behind [[*user Salman Corbette]] (who I plan on surpassing one day), or yaddah yaddah yaddah.

//A perspective shift, and my first time ever writing the GOC. I had fun with them. The two operatives here, Baxter and I don't remember the woman's name, are characters that I honestly wouldn't mind coming back to. They're so neat, I just love them to death. The chase scene here was so much fun to write (especially 'cause I thought I didn't like writing action scenes and then I proved myself wrong) and taking a chapter to get outside of Brainy's head and see how other people are viewing his actions was interesting to write.//

**{{Lessons Learned}}**
//It's easy to make people think you are writing about the SCP Foundation when in fact you are writing the GOC. It was fun to play with that, as it comes more into play in the next chapter.//

//Good golly that song reference in the title~! This is the only chapter of Vend-a-Friend to have cuss word in it, and where that single cuss word is used I think makes the scene all the more shocking and dramatic. Not gonna spoil the line for the rare chance that someone is reading all this commentary before reading the story. I liked writing Baxter even more here. I made myself tear up writing that part where... well yet again no spoilers, but people probably know what I'm talking about. Baxter felt really human to me. Loved writing him.//

//I call this an "imaginary" chapter (it's Chapter i) because I don't fully agree with all of Dread & Circuses' headcanons for things, and I want Wonder World to be able to exist outside of the Dread & Circuses canon. That's why not all of the Vend-a-Friend tales are tagged with the canon, of course. Still, this article gets to highlight my second favorite side character, 3T! Thomas Timothy Thompson, love that guy, loved giving him a bigger spotlight and writing more of Wonder World. For all those wondering, Judy the Tongue is my favorite Vend-a-Friend side character.

//Look at that, my second longest article on the site (Waiting on the Good Times takes that cake with over 10,000 words)! This is the largest download of Wondertainment lore in a single article on the site, period. So so much is covered in here. This is basically me putting my headcanon on the site in nigh full and asking, begging people, "look, write this, it's all there!". I can't make people write it, of course, but man, this is so much that it's hardly likely people even need to ask me anything about my headcanon on Wondertainment if they just want to write it. They just have to read this. Which is pretty awesome. Plus, I got to have the main character be my favorite side character of Vend-a-Friend (if I can even reasonably choose), Judy the Tongue! Yay!

I have already made edits to make it be paced better, and I expect to make some more in the future. However, Dr. Neurosis is really fun, and 3T is great, and Pepper is my spirit animal.

//I'm going to use this space for lessons learned from all of Vend-a-Friend. Here goes. Series / books are not as hard to write as people say they are. Outlining your plot before writing it is, however, necessary to make the whole thing flow like it's supposed to. Projects like this are really fulfilling, and fun, and I should do things like this again... perhaps with a real book, intended to be published. That would be crazy awesome. Also, I really like (my version of) Dr. Wondertainment. And I really enjoy having a readership. And I enjoy writing dialogue, characterization,// and //worldbuilding.

//Don't do X-Man syndrome, it's uninteresting. Also, don't try to write humanoids as your first skip. Thirdly, don't do action. This isn't a rule for all authors, but it is for me.

My skips are probably going to follow a path of being either Safe or Euclid and fairly non lethal with very low stakes because of this. I might attempt action in the future, and I might get good at it, but I also enjoy writing more calmly anyways. Action is for tales where I can be overly descriptive, writing action in a clinical tone is damaging to my psyche.//

Exploration log of an MTF going into a huge stone(?) protrusion that's popped up in Belgium with an obvious (but angled) door. They enter it to find a long line of hallways and rooms. They can find a translucent green substance around, and a lot of foliage, along with small holes along the walls and floors. They can also see a lot of Celtic and Christian imagery. Suddenly, the whole things starts moving, and the agents see bugs explode out of the holes in the wall. Later, they find some druids. Even later, they get spit out as the "temple" surfaces in Turkey and spits them out. The anomaly has not been found again, but the agents start acting weird...

Mostly just a working title that I love, but it actually //does// have an idea attached to it. Some kind of reality degradation thing... think, like... well, I was actually going to tie this to [[[SCP-2728]]], so let me start with that idea. It would be Agent LaFerrier, from the alternate dimension, and his cell phone would pick up calls he got from his boss and from other people, and stuff like that. It would tell the story (sort of) of what happens between LaFerrier getting sucked into the anomaly and go even beyond where 2728 ends (with him saying the sky is black). If I //didn't// connect it to 2728, it would be some sort of reality degradation event revolving around some //other// story told through someone's phone calls that gets siphoned through random audio emitting devices throughout the world at random moments.

During a depression, the US government is dealing with an economic crash and finds that they are spending too much money on retirement funds (and they don't have the money to do it). Teaming with the SCP Foundation, a subsection of the CIA is devising an anomalous plan to make people doing dangerous jobs die just before they retire. This would probably take place somewhere in the future, and part of the challenge would be writing the whole thing with accurate governmental and economic terms, and hoping to never break clinical tone (no interviews, no logs, no nothing, all told through the cold veneer of scientific language).

[[SIZE 110%]]##6C7F41|**Stuff from the Grave**##[[/size]]
[[collapsible show="Some Thoughts..." hide="Thinky Things..."]]
So in Oregon (this would be a Wilson's Wildlife SCP) there is a fungus that smells like vanilla and [*https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/PanellusStipticusAug12_2009.jpg looks like this] but with more different colors. It grows on dead things, and it grows very, //very// fast. Its spores are released within a day of its first growing, and it is not edible. It is terrorizing a forest, where anything that dies grows these things and anything that eats these things dies so it spreads itself and removes much food from the ecosystem. Wilson's Wildlife Services and MTF Beta-4 ("Castaways") are dispatched to deal with this eco threat, especially so that it doesn't get near any population centers where the spores will most certainly catch on people and be carried far away, which would be very bad (this thing is Keter but Wilson's Wildlife has been //employed// to help in containment, not claimed it like they would with something Euclid or Keter).

They find the source of the fungus to be a cabin in the woods that is //covered// in this stuff (the wood is rotting, y'know). They find an in tact computer inside that has emails between the guy who owned the computer (bill.horschwitt@gmail.com) and some weird person (mistertobe@stuff.ind). It's just one email sent by the dude, saying "the product is working great but it got into my fridge and doesn't seem to be impeded by the cold, all my lunch meat is ruined and this vanilla smell has stuck around for days, not to mention that I think my dog ate some of it and he's feeling real sick, what should I do?" and then the guy replies with details on CadaVanisher, and it ends with "Sincerely, Stuff Industries".
