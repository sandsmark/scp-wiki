You made it to my author page! I, [[*user DarkStuff]], have created three successful articles at some point. By the time you are reading this, I might have made more. This author page is probably gonna be very bare for a while, and you're gonna have to just wait for me to put more effort into it. Yay!

Where getting a sandbox felt like an accomplishment, getting an author's page feels far far greater. It feels honorific. I have accomplished something, it says to me. I am slowly becoming a more involved member of this community. Where I might not be the quickest of writers, when I write I put my heart and soul into it. And this has earned me an author's page. It feels so damn good.

I am much more of a brainstormer than I am a writer though, and thus I have ideas far faster than I have works of art to showcase them. I mean, having been a member since 2012, I have made only three articles. To be fair, I had only tried at the very beginning of that and had only started to get back into the swing of things maybe... late last year? Sorry, thinking in terms of school years. Early last year (2016 for those reading from //the future!//). Writing out something I am comfortable with uploading takes a long time. Why is this?

Well, flow. Mostly flow. When I write, it is stream of consciousness. If I have to stop and think about what I am going to write in the middle of a roll, it halts all progress. I need my flow. Thus, first drafts are (since I don't want to stop writing when I start) very much what I call "barfing out an idea". Barfing is when you just //need to get this down// and you don't have time to stop and think about the small things, like clinical tone for example. Flow is very much required when I am writing. This also makes going back and revising it very tedious for me, there is no constant flow when finding small thinks to revise. Thus, I have //massive// author blindness. I will start reading it and my brain goes back to flow mode, where I lose all critical thinking.

This is why critiquing is important to me. I don't think a cold post of mine could ever, //ever// work. Not with all the experience in the world. That's just not how my brain works. My pieces go through a lot of critiquing before they get posted, always in excess of a month. That combined with the fact that I have a life outside of this site (not saying other people don't) makes it take forever for me to crank out a work of mine. You would think this would mean that when they do get posted they're phenomenal, but that's not the case, mostly because in the grand scheme of things I am a fairly inexperienced writer.

Writing tales is, admittedly, easier for me. At the time of writing, I have not written a tale, but stream of consciousness works far better for those. Doesn't mean they don't need revising, but I like how the flow goes. If my writing is flowing, probably means the reader is flowing as well. Still fine tuning this, but you know, practice makes (near) perfect.

Anyways, I will probably have another tab in here somewhere where I talk more about myself. I think I am an interesting individual. In fact, everyone is. Every single person on this planet is interesting and unique and worth knowing. However, I know myself the best, so it is easiest for me to write about me. Also, on the off chance that anyone is interested, they can go peek into my personality (if you haven't already gathered some stuff by the way I talk and write).

[[SIZE 110%]][[[SCP-2728]]]  |  ##a9232c|On the Barcelona Skyline##[[/size]]
//This was my first successful skip. Though successful is subjective. First skip that wasn't downvoted to hell. I wanted something short and sweet, where a seemingly predictable anomaly throws the Foundation a curve ball and the Foundation misses.//

**{{Lessons Learned}}**
//You just have to work hard at it, and there is a method to see if it will succeed. A good draft critiquing method is to post the link to your sandbox and ask everyone to look at it and say if they would upvote. They don't have to give you a full review, just say whether they'd upvote. That works mighty fine.//

//Wanted to have some trippy sinkhole imagery. Something you might find on an album cover. This was that. It didn't turn out so well, but I enjoyed writing it and I learned from it so it is a success for me personally. Might rewrite it someday though, with more gusto.//

**{{Lessons Learned}}**
//Sometimes the direction that you are taking your skip is not the direction it needs to go, and trying to cram too many small details into one article can be overwhelming if not done correctly.//

[[SIZE 110%]][[[SCP-3018]]]  |  ##a9232c|France & the Tale of the Well-Intentioned Understudies##[[/size]]
//This one was wonky. Had an idea of some woodboring beetles fighting off a forest god, and then it became more beetle focused and less god focused, and then I realised I just liked the beetles more, so I removed the god entirely. I then had to find out what the "gimmick" was, and when I did that I realised the bugs didn't have to be sapient anymore, so I left it debatable. Many, many changes and an impatient author made this get posted a bit prematurely, and it's first impression suffered because of it. I worked in an addendum that gave more story and substance, but it was a bit late. Still proud of it though.//

**{{Lessons Learned}}**
//Even if it feels like it is taking forever, get some good veteran reviews before posting. I understand, it is hard when #site19 is so bogged down in shiz, but you gotta be patient.//

[[SIZE 110%]]##a9232c|Black Hole Church for a Black Hole Town##[[/size]]
//I wanted to make the King Fisher concept, where the church is the king and the town is the kingdom. Got an amazing review from [[*user A Random Day]] on this one (not a positive review, but his critique was in depth and gorgeous.//

**{{Lessons Learned}}**
//Make sure it has a story, and not just interesting effects. Also make sure that there is tension, and give it a good hook at the beginning. Mediocre articles do not survive.//

**{{Revisit?}}**
//Actually, maybe. I like this idea, I just need to expand upon it. I posted it far before it was ready and then it got downvoted (not to hell, mind you, but it was in the negatives). I might come back to this idea, the King Fisher concept is really quite cool.//

//An area where, if you said a truth out loud or wrote a truth down, it would only be true for the area and when you exited you were in a world where it wasn't true. One might ask "how do they figure this out?" and I have a test that they designed that is so ingenious I'm still proud of it. But alas, it was not meant to be.//

**{{Lessons Learned}}**
//Actually was a good idea. So good it had been done before. Make sure you are being original.//

**{{Revisit?}}**
//No, the reverse causality torus really has this idea on lock.//

[[SIZE 110%]]##a9232c|Anti-Foundation Crystals##[[/size]]
//Some guys made out of crystal that acted like computers and their sole purpose was to divulge information by the Foundation. Later, I decided they should go after a couple different GoI's. Even later, I found out it wouldn't work and I wasn't having fun writing it.//

**{{Lessons Learned}}**
//Don't do X-Man syndrome, it's uninteresting. Also, don't try to write humanoids as your first skip. Thirdly, don't do action. This isn't a rule for all authors, but it is for me. I don't have fun writing action, and I'm not terribly good at it. My skips are probably going to follow a path of being either Safe or Euclid and fairly non lethal with very low stakes because of this. I might attempt action in the future, and I might get good at it, but I also enjoy writing more calmly anyways. Action is for tales where I can be overly descriptive, writing action in a clinical tone is damaging to my psyche.//

**{{Revisit?}}**
//...The more I think about it, the more I remember why I liked this idea in the first place. It has some cool aspects, mainly the abilities of the crystal people. If I took out the action, I think the mystery of their motivations and some of their tailored abilities would be cool to expand upon. Also, who created them? I dunno, a revisiting might do them good.//

[[SIZE 150%]]I Will One Day Write a Character as Complex as I Know Myself to Be[[/size]]
[[/=]]
I hope that doesn't sound... entitled. But I know myself like I know nobody else, and my other goal outside of the writing community is to know someone else to the degree that I know myself. I guess that would have to be a romantic partner, wouldn't it. Hmm.

But anyways, I know myself like no other. I think my strongest suit is looking into myself, analyzing myself, and I hate that I don't have that type of skill with other people. I am an analyst. I act on logic before I act on emotion, and that makes it hard for me to connect with people. I have this basic desire to help people with their personal problems, but I more often than not come off as unfeeling. That is because, unfortunately, I have a lack of empathy. I am unsure, but I think I am borderline sociopath. I know I can't be completely sociopath, because I want to help other people, but at the same time I know that I do so for a selfish reason: to prove my self worth to myself.

If I can't help people, I'm not worth anything. On a similar note, if I can't be trusted with emotions, I have failed as a person as well. I think this deep seated goal of mine arose out of two things: a lack of childhood friends and the realization that I was bad at it. I was, for a long time, off putting. I struggled with emotional outbursts for a long while during childhood, which led to being lonely, which led to more emotional outbursts and often anger issues. I know this doesn't sound like a big deal because I was only a child and don't have those issues (as much) now, but it has left a lasting impression. All feelings come from somewhere.

Oh jeez, this is just the intro for my "About Me" page, what am I doing? Ugh, DarkStuff, find something more relevant for this intro you damned man! Hmm. Well, I know that I want to be documented. I am an open book, even to the most fringe of acquaintances I will most likely spill my guts. I don't think many people gain anything from keeping secrets, being open is the best way to be respected and be connected with. Oh Jesus I'm straying again! Gah, this is what I mean by stream of consciousness!

For serious though, I want to be documented so that people may know me and share feelings with me and be chummy with me and yaddah yaddah yaddah, also I have a fear of being forgotten and having a permanent record of my experiences would be a lot of closure to me, and the best place I could think of putting this where people may read it and converse with me about it is on a respected writing site! You don't have to read if you don't want, and the more I think about it the more selfish and entitled it sounds, it really isn't I just want to connect with the community and my fellow humans! //There!// Let the rest of the page begin, for freaking finally.

[[SIZE 120%]]**This Is Just an Example**[[/size]][[collapsible show="Read" hide="Close"]]
All of my "chapters" will be set up this way. Currently, I have no "chapters". I will soon though. Each chapter may be a specific experience, or it may be a feeling I have, emotions and thoughts or stories or anecdotes, all of the above. The more political ones... I may consider not posting? I am conflicted, because on the one hand I want to be open with everyone, and on the other hand I feel like my opinions will not be appreciated and instead of prompting thoughtful discussion they may prompt argument and hard feelings (the opposite of what I want). Who knows how it will go. I hope somebody reads this stuff though, and comments would be appreciated. I wish more authors (or people in general) might do this kind of thing, reading about people is utterly fascinating.
