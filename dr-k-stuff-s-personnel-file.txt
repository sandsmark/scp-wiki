You made it to my author page! I, [[*user DarkStuff]], have created three successful articles at some point. By the time you are reading this, I might have made more. This author page is probably gonna be very bare for a while, and you're gonna have to just wait for me to put more effort into it. Yay!

Where getting a sandbox felt like an accomplishment, getting an author's page feels far, far greater. It feels honorific. I have accomplished something, it says to me. I am slowly becoming a more involved member of this community. Where I might not be the quickest of writers, when I write I put my heart and soul into it. And this has earned me an author's page. It feels so damn good.

I am much more of a brainstormer than I am a writer though, and thus I have ideas far faster than I have works of art to showcase them. I mean, having been a member since 2012, I have made only three articles. To be fair, I had only tried at the very beginning of that and had only started to get back into the swing of things maybe... late last year? Sorry, thinking in terms of school years. Early last year (2016 for those reading from //the future!//). Writing out something I am comfortable with uploading takes a long time. Why is this?

Well, flow. Mostly flow. When I write, it is stream of consciousness. If I have to stop and think about what I am going to write in the middle of a roll, it halts all progress. I need my flow. Thus, first drafts are (since I don't want to stop writing when I start) very much what I call "barfing out an idea". Barfing is when you just //need to get this down// and you don't have time to stop and think about the small things, like clinical tone for example. Flow is very much required when I am writing. This also makes going back and revising it very tedious for me, there is no constant flow when finding small thinks to revise. Thus, I have //massive// author blindness. I will start reading it and my brain goes back to flow mode, where I lose all critical thinking.

This is why critiquing is important to me. I don't think a cold post of mine could ever, //ever// work. Not with all the experience in the world. That's just not how my brain works. My pieces go through a lot of critiquing before they get posted, always in excess of a month. That combined with the fact that I have a life outside of this site (not saying other people don't) makes it take forever for me to crank out a work of mine. You would think this would mean that when they do get posted they're phenomenal, but that's not the case, mostly because in the grand scheme of things I am a fairly inexperienced writer.

Writing tales is, admittedly, easier for me. At the time of writing, I have not written a tale, but stream of consciousness works far better for those. Doesn't mean they don't need revising, but I like how the flow goes. If my writing is flowing, probably means the reader is flowing as well. Still fine tuning this, but you know, practice makes (near) perfect.

Anyways, I will probably have another tab in here somewhere where I talk more about myself. I think I am an interesting individual. In fact, everyone is. Every single person on this planet is interesting and unique and worth knowing. However, I know myself the best, so it is easiest for me to write about me. Also, on the off chance that anyone is interested, they can go peek into my personality (if you haven't already gathered some stuff by the way I talk and write).

[[SIZE 110%]][[[SCP-2728]]]  |  ##a9232c|On the Barcelona Skyline##[[/size]]
//This was my first successful skip. Though successful is subjective. First skip that wasn't downvoted to hell. I wanted something short and sweet, where a seemingly predictable anomaly throws the Foundation a curve ball and the Foundation misses.//

**{{Lessons Learned}}**
//You just have to work hard at it, and there is a method to see if it will succeed. A good draft critiquing method is to post the link to your sandbox and ask everyone to look at it and say if they would upvote. They don't have to give you a full review, just say whether they'd upvote. That works mighty fine.//

//Wanted to have some trippy sinkhole imagery. Something you might find on an album cover. This was that. It didn't turn out so well, but I enjoyed writing it and I learned from it so it is a success for me personally. Might rewrite it someday though, with more gusto.//

//Sometimes the direction that you are taking your skip is not the direction it needs to go, and trying to cram too many small details into one article can be overwhelming if not done correctly.//

//This one was wonky. Had an idea of some woodboring beetles fighting off a forest god, and then it became more beetle focused and less god focused, and then I realised I just liked the beetles more, so I removed the god entirely. I then had to find out what the "gimmick" was, and when I did that I realised the bugs didn't have to be sapient anymore, so I left it debatable. Many, many changes and an impatient author made this get posted a bit prematurely, and it's first impression suffered because of it. I worked in an addendum that gave more story and substance, but it was a bit late. Still proud of it though.//

//Even if it feels like it is taking forever, get some good veteran reviews before posting. I understand, it is hard when #site19 is so bogged down in shiz, but you gotta be patient.//

//I wanted to make the King Fisher concept, where the church is the king and the town is the kingdom. Got an amazing review from [[*user A Random Day]] on this one (not a positive review, but his critique was in depth and gorgeous).//

**{{Lessons Learned}}**
//Make sure it has a story, and not just interesting effects. Also make sure that there is tension, and give it a good hook at the beginning. Mediocre articles do not survive.//

**{{Revisit?}}**
//Actually, maybe. I like this idea, I just need to expand upon it. I posted it far before it was ready and then it got downvoted (not to hell, mind you, but it was in the negatives). I might come back to this idea, the King Fisher concept is really quite cool.//

//Some guys made out of crystal that acted like computers and their sole purpose was to divulge information by the Foundation. Later, I decided they should go after a couple different GoI's. Even later, I found out it wouldn't work and I wasn't having fun writing it.//

**{{Lessons Learned}}**
//Don't do X-Man syndrome, it's uninteresting. Also, don't try to write humanoids as your first skip. Thirdly, don't do action. This isn't a rule for all authors, but it is for me. I don't have fun writing action, and I'm not terribly good at it. My skips are probably going to follow a path of being either Safe or Euclid and fairly non lethal with very low stakes because of this. I might attempt action in the future, and I might get good at it, but I also enjoy writing more calmly anyways. Action is for tales where I can be overly descriptive, writing action in a clinical tone is damaging to my psyche.//

**{{Revisit?}}**
//...The more I think about it, the more I remember why I liked this idea in the first place. It has some cool aspects, mainly the abilities of the crystal people. If I took out the action, I think the mystery of their motivations and some of their tailored abilities would be cool to expand upon. Also, who created them? I dunno, a revisiting might do them good.//

I brainstorm way more than I write. I will put summaries of ideas here, and when I start working on an idea I will put it in my sandbox in far deeper detail. If you like one of these ideas and wanna see it done, like, I dunno, you can... ask me... to write it yourself... I don't remember where I was going with this but I wanted a fatter beginning paragraph because a short one would look bad. Anyways...

[[SIZE 110%]]##a9232c|The Silent War##[[/size]]
So like, it's a war. Huge war. Going on. But all participants in the war are intangible and silent, and so are their weapons and clothes and battleships and more! They are also invisible... but the more someone sees death in combat the more they can faintly make out the war. It is effectively a worthless anomaly, because it has no effect on anything at all. But I think I can make it effectively creepy. The warring people are all stone faced. Think Broden from Aunty Donna, but less silly about it. Their eyes are out of focus, they never speak, and when they "die" they still have eyes open and are breathing. The last bit would be a German soldier writing a letter (nod to All Quiet on the Western Front). The letter is the only time they see any communicate, but the writing is... disturbing at best. Not world building type disturbing, word salad type disturbing. Unless I can think of something better.

[[SIZE 110%]]##a9232c|Vend-a-Friend##[[/size]]
This would be a tale, or possibly an SCP and a tale, about Wondertainment. The premise is as follows: Wondertainment is more of a company than a single person, and one of the employees (who is a fantastic toy maker) has an outburst. They put him on leave, giving him his own house, and tell him he can come back once he has calmed down, which will be when he has made a successful toy idea (he's been on a downward spiral for a bit). If he calms down, he can come back, if not then he will be respectfully fired. He takes this badly. Very badly. And uh... he decides he wants to trick Wondertainment into selling something... wrong. He stops taking his medication, and he goes a bit fucking crazy. Thus, "Vend-a-Friend" is born. And I don't know if I wanna spoil exactly what that is.

[[SIZE 110%]]##a9232c|Thing What Does Thing##[[/size]]
This is actually the idea of a friend of mine who doesn't have an SCP account but is gonna get one. We'll co-author this when he makes that happen (he's in a bit of a weird situation). That being said, the sentiment of this SCP would be that "anomalies aren't meant to make sense, an anomaly is anything oustide the norm so you're bound to get things that have no meaning behind them". I told him "I think your idea is the 'anomalous items' list". We brainstormed a bit, and came up with a reason it would be an SCP: all objects are oddly connected to this washing machine that... well, explaining what all the objects do would take too long. But they're all connected to this washing machine. In documentation, there were three researchers who worked on experimenting with this SCP, none of which can be found in any other part of the SCP database. Thus, the origin of the objects and how their esoteric natures were discovered is unknown, but nothing seems to make sense. One of the items in this is a pile of croutons, and while you're next to it you can hear a highway. The ending of this SCP would be when the highway sounds stop, they hear someone walk up, and then an individual starts talking to the croutons... and the croutons talk back. This little exchange between them would reveal the person talking is one of the researchers, a Dr. Kai Herrera. I think my friend and I have a sufficiently weird yet cool way for this exchange to go.

They can find a translucent green substance around, and a lot of foliage, along with small holes along the walls and floors. They can also see a lot of Celtic and Christian imagery. Suddenly, the whole things starts moving, and the agents see bugs explode out of the holes in the wall. Later, they find some druids. Even later, they get spit out as the "temple" surfaces in Turkey and spits them out. The anomaly has not been found again, but the agents start acting weird...

I hope that doesn't sound... entitled. But I know myself like I know nobody else, and my other goal outside of the writing community is to know someone else to the degree that I know myself. I guess that would have to be a romantic partner, wouldn't it. Hmm.

For serious though, I want to be documented so that people may know me and share feelings with me and be chummy with me and yaddah yaddah yaddah, also I have a fear of being forgotten and having a permanent record of my experiences would be a lot of closure to me, and the best place I could think of putting this where people may read it and converse with me about it is on a respected writing site. You don't have to read if you don't want, and the more I think about it the more selfish and entitled it sounds, it really isn't. I just want to connect with the community and my fellow humans.

[[SIZE 150%]]Diary / Journal / Blag Type Thing[[/size]]
[[/=]]
[[collapsible show="On Giving & Giving & Giving" hide="5/27/17"]]
Welcome to "chapter one". I guess this is like my diary now. Public journal and diary. Shit, that's a blog... whatever, nah, this is what it is. It is what it is. Get ready for sad DarkStuff real world bullshit feelings.

Hmm, I need to have my name shortened for when I'm referencing real world scenarios. I guess I'll just be Dark, then. Uh, where do I start. Hmm. Well, I feel like a dick sometimes. And I know why. I surround myself with overly sensitive people who work more off of emotions than logic and I always value rationality over feelings. Thus I get into weird situations where a person tells me about a dream they had where they met a better version of their family, I commented "side note, did you have to crawl through a previously bricked off door in your house to get to them?" and they say "what?" and I explain it's a Coraline reference and they get all sad. I ask "why sad", and they say "sometimes making fun of things that are important to people feels a little belittling, Dark".

My brain immediately goes to "where in there was it mentioned as something of great importance, I understand it was a very nice dream and I was making a reference", but of course I didn't say that. "I wasn't trying to make fun of it, I'm sorry if it came off that way" so said I. They responded "right", and I responded "I'm sorry" and they said "thank you for apologizing". And I have many, many interactions like this, mostly with this person and their friend group. I... really love them and care about them, but their impulsive irrational nature and depressed personality combine into a concoction that makes it hard for me to interact with them, that and how they have stated many a times before that I don't help them.

I help them god damn it. They have stressed about going home to face their mom, not because there was something particularly bad going to happen but because their mom is always oppressive and overbearing and constantly yelling at them. They couldn't come to my house because there were no chaperones, so I worked my ass off to get a family friend to pick us up and be the chaperone for us at their house. It was ridiculous, talking to my friend's mom and coordinating with this other family friend, it took all school day and I ran out of battery on my phone doing it //just// as the mom said "that's alright". We got picked up, had a heart to heart at my family friend's house, and then my friend went home feeling much better.

And I have never once gotten thanked for that. In fact, it has never been brought up again. I work a thankless job, putting all within my power into helping them, and their online friends who only talk to them exactly like I do don't get //thanked// mind you, but my friend goes to them first. I am their only in real life friend, and as soon as some grueling task I take is over and done with, my friend promptly forgets about it, ignores my everlasting support for them, and continues to be sad over small things. They don't recognize any form of support, I believe.

I can't live with that. That is a toxic... way of life, and I know they can't help the way they are. They can't help being sad, and I don't want them to be sad, and I work to make them not sad, but god fucking damn it they can be more aware when //everyone is conspiring in their favor in everlasting support//. Me, my friends, their friends online, a group of adults who didn't know them personally fought for them specifically because they had a touching experience of how much my friend struggles with school, and they don't ever acknowledge it.

And I know why I'm tethered to them. I'm tethered to them because they got me out of a deep, endless depression. We entered a relationship, which was exactly what I needed, I had my first really intimate interactions with them, and we split off when they found someone else. It was a painless break up, and we remained extremely close friends. We are still - in a weird way that is consensual with everyone, even their new significant other - intimate with each other, because honestly... that's what we befriended over. There are many other things that make me think they have the potential to be wonderful - they are always willing to help others, they are a phenomenal artist, fantastic writer, and they get so passionate over their geekdoms it's impossible not to get roped into their hobbies with them.

I... I don't want to lose my window into the sexual world, and I don't want to lose a very close friend right now. Neither of those are things I feel I'd be better without. But I also can't afford to have interactions like this every other day. Things that take me from my baseline positive demeanor to a pit of inactivity and depression. I can't make a decision. My decisions are to stop caring for them but continue to go do stuff with them, which is shallow, or break things off and leave them with no IRL friends. It hurts. And I need to make a decision. But I don't know the decision to make. Especially because I think if they were just more aware of how much people loved them, they'd be less sad. But they're seemingly oblivious to all signs of compassion and empathy towards them. It's a one way street of giving and no receiving. I don't know what to do.

[[collapsible show="God Fucking Damn It" hide="5/28/17"]]
I love being made fun of by people I respect and look up to in front of people I respect and look up to, Jesus I made a total ass of myself. I... am confused. I don't know if I'm wrong or they're wrong or if I wasn't listening to them or they weren't listening to me, but if none of these are true than what even happened? I thought I wasn't being volatile, I thought I was respectfully communicating my feeling, and I even stated at one point that I might be wrong. Anyone might be wrong. Opinions and beliefs are malleable, and honestly everything is created by culture, so right and wrong are completely subjective. So nobody was wrong. Scratch what I said earlier.

I can't not talk to people, and I don't want to feel like I must keep my beliefs to myself. But I don't know where to put my energy. I feel... disliked. I don't want to alienate people, but I'm not sure if I'm willing to do that if it means limiting my speech. I dunno, I'm feeling shaky.

[[collapsible show="God Fucking Damn It Cont." hide="5/29/17"]]
Ugh, sigh, jeez, insert further exasperated expression. I hate having to look at people differently. On the other hand, nah, I'm not hiding my beliefs and opinions. Absolutely //fuck// that. I find respectful disagreement, and discourse with people who respectfully disagree with you, the best way to find new ideas and flaws in your own ideas. When you try to preach non-violence and say that "you can't kill an idea with violence, you kill an idea with education" and someone responds by calling you out as "emotionally constipated", keeping your beliefs to yourself because of it is exactly what not to do. Fuck that. Fuck. //That//.

I might be wrong. I might be //totally// wrong. But so might you, and so might others, so you know what? I'm gonna be loud and proud. Violence incites more violence, defend yourself but preach before you go off "killing transphobes". Work within the system. Teach. //Teach//. It's a long fucking system, but it works. Guess who has gay marriage now? Guess who has free blacks now?

Guess what's never gonna go away? Assholes and terrible human beings. Killing every last one of them isn't going to make them go away. Why? Because by killing them you are becoming another asshole. Reasons why I might be wrong? Well... Well. I haven't been oppressed before. The most I've ever been "oppressed" is being called a girl. That's like... nothing. It's not even oppression. At all. And that's why I mentioned it that way; I have nowhere near the experience that other people have had. That and I live in California, the most liberal and accepting of all the states. So yes! I have an outsider point of view. But that's allowable.

Do I have to go to war to have feelings about it? Do I have to have made a movie to be able to criticize one? Must I paint a lovely piece of art before I can interpret them? No. The answer is no. Would having done those things helped? Yes. Yes they would have. But they aren't necessary, and you can't act like my opinions are irrelevant because I haven't been there myself. My opinions may change. So may yours. But neither of us will get anywhere if we don't take it calmly and respectfully, and refrain from taking it so fucking //personal//. Like I am. Right now.

Whoops... alright, I have expressed my feeling. I, DarkStuff, Dark for short, wholeheartedly promise to listen to the voices of others, contemplate their world views, and analyze why their ideas may or may not work, with a non partisan point of view. I will recognize their experiences, where they come from, and where my own opinions come from and why they may or may not be wrong. I recognize that everything anyone thinks comes from somewhere. Yes, even the assholes of the world. Even the sexists, the racists, the homophobes. They all have reasons as well.

The main point is people are people. Good and bad is subjective. I think one way, you think another, neither of us are right because we aren't arguing facts we are arguing opinions. The world keeps turning whether or not we think one way or another. Whether we're ruled by fear or by incentive. Whether we love or hate. Whether we accept or reject. In the grand scheme of things, we don't even matter. That got a bit nihilist. But you get the point.

In fact, if you disagree with me but can present yourself in a respectful manner, shoot dude, send me a PM! I'd love to talk with someone like that. With the knowledge that neither of us are pushing our beliefs on each other, that we are simply articulating the whats and whys. And here, [[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muf3XYTXfHk |have a video that I consider to be a perfect example of respectfully disagreeing.]]] Not a single voice is raised. He preaches free speech. And yet he thinks something I think we //all// agree is fundamentally evil. And yet... just watch it. You'll see what I mean.

Phew! That was cathartic. Sorry if I felt a little angry in there. If I'm being honest, it's because I was. I felt like I was attacked for my beliefs. Maybe I wasn't. Who knows. Humans are humans and feelings are feelings and strong emotions shape memories. And I'm also sorry if it felt like I attacked anyone in particular. I think I made sure not to. Alright. I'm done.

[[collapsible show="On Self Image" hide="5/30/17"]]
Culture is awesome sometimes. US culture is more often than not, //not// awesome. This is very apparent on gender norms. Now, I must preface this with this: women have it worse. Like, holy shit, //way// worse. Patriarchy is a bitch. I am not arguing that, even slightly. I am going to point out that men have their own little cultural norms as well.

When you hear that, you'll probably agree, and think "well yeah, they need to be //strong// and not show their //feelings// and be in //control// and yaddah yaddah yaddah". Well, see, I don't feel any of those things. I am a totally open book, and I am quite emotional, and if I'm being honest, I'm the submissive type. Oh, and I'm flimsy as fuck. If //anyone// says "I can beat you in a fight" I will not argue you for even a second, no matter your muscle mass or size. You'll probably win. And I don't feel pressured to be any of those things. I mean, being able to lift things would be nice, but as long as I'm alive and well I don't feel the need to lift weights every day. I have better things to do.

No, I think I've had a pretty unique experience of getting an insecurity from the culture, and it's that I feel... gross. I don't feel okay with my body. I think I have an okay face (how I see myself depends on the day), I don't feel flabby or fat (pretty average build), sometimes I feel a little unhygienic (but of course that's when I //am// and it's my fault), but I always feel uncomfortable with being naked. Or showing anyone any of that. The two situations I feel alright with being undressed is in bed or in the shower, and I take quick showers and I have to be //really// hot and sweaty for me to take anything off in bed.

Friends (mostly one that may or may not join the site, that'd be cool!) have told me that that feels... weird. Because most often I seem very confident and that I communicate an air of high self esteem. Which I do. Because in general, I have high self esteem. It's just my body. So how did I get this insecurity, and why do I blame culture? 'Cause of a couple of generalities. Unsolicited dick pics are the worst thing possible, and you're an asshole for sending them. Unsolicited nudes from gals are welcome and make people (mostly straight guys I admit) feel better. Women, flaunt your stuff! Guys, keep it in your pants. "Dicks are gross!" (-Aziz Ansari), and it's a regular occurrence for you to see gals grab each other's boobs (at least where I'm from, and I understand that's more my age group and not in general).

And I think I understand where all of this came from. Girls used to be more suppressed, and guys were the people who were able to go do whatever and get away with it. Over time, there was a cultural reaction, and a sort of reversal of roles. Not a total reversal mind you, women are //still// fighting for rights, and people are //still// being total assholes to them just for their gender, so sometimes I feel like I shouldn't really complain about this insecurity of mine because I feel a little guilty about it. But now if a girl reaches down your pants it's sexy and you're an idiot for pulling away, but if you reach up their shirt they have every right to scream bloody murder. So... what's the fix?

Well, go one way or the other. We are in the middle where genders get different privileges over one another. Either nobody gets to touch each other without permission, or everyone gets to everywhere. I don't much care which (might get more into that at a later point), but if that was the culture we grew up in that would have been better. Equality, you know? At this point, I feel like nobody wants to see it. Put it away, it's gross, you have to be very close to someone for it to even be an option, don't be that one overconfident misogynistic asshole by talking about your dick... it's like, I wouldn't have done any of these things anyways, but the constant pounding message that anything to do with your genitalia is wrong and gross and disgusting has really, really worked its way into my psyche and grown roots that extend across my whole cranium. The first time someone wanted to get naked with me I cried.

Sometimes, I really hate the culture.

[[collapsible show="On Past Mistakes" hide="6/1/17"]]
I had a really good friend, let's name them... Tick. Tick or Lick. I think I'll stick with Tick, and cool that rhymed. You prick! I picked this trick, I'll stick with Tick. Okay I'm done. But I had this friend. I've known them since 4th Grade, so we've been friends for quite a long time. They were my very best friend until about 9th Grade, when I started to sort of readjust my friend group.

However, 9th Grade was when I started getting super depressed. Ridiculously down in the dumps. This lasted until 10th Grade, second semester, when my friend I talked about in "On Giving & Giving & Giving" picked me up. I mean, I was pulling out of my depression before then but they helped immensely. Anyways, that's a story for another day. Anyways, I am an introvert, so I like to have a small but extremely close group of friends. I found out through a friend of them that they weren't sharing everything with me.

"Woah!" I said, "what and why?" And then I got into a very heated argument with them that ended in a couple days of uncomfortable glances that were thankfully cut off by winter break. When school started up again, we were chummy as usual, but we barely texted and we never talked outside of school. I always sort of thought this was all their fault for keeping things from me, and not just keeping things, outright lying to me about certain things.

Now I am not depressed, and have a clearer head. I have discovered a couple of things - not from asking around, but by looking inside myself. Firstly, it is absolutely reasonable for someone to not want to tell you everything (I am certain every single person reading this is going to say "no fucking duh" but such is life). This is especially true because they are an extrovert and thus have a lot of friends for different things, and they had already told me that I was their goofy friend that they hung out with to try and get //away// from their problems, not confront them. They had / have other friends for that. Secondly, they really did trust me with some very personal, sensitive information. Stuff that I will not divulge, but some stuff that I'm sure they wouldn't share with just anybody. At the time it irked me that I learned about this stuff so late (some of it happened in 7th Grade and I learned of it this year), but it occurs to me now how they thought about it. To them, I am their escape (or was). They don't want to confront their feelings while with me, that was not my purpose. But they still really trusted me, so they would just give me sensitive information after the fact, when all their feelings had already been worked through. They //did// trust me, they just didn't think of me as that friend. Thirdly, I realized how god damn pushy I was.

I was //so// pushy and abrasive, when it came to personal information from my friends it was hard for me to take no for an answer. This person had known me since 4th Grade, and I think they figured out it was easier to make shit up then try to get me to lay off every single time. If this was mild before I got depressed, it was severe nearing the end of that period of my life. I was in the wrong head space to do anything, and I felt like screaming at people every second of every day. It came to my attention that my friend hasn't been sharing everything with me, and I freaked. I don't remember the specifics of the conversation, but I said something about them having to "man up and face their fears" and they said something back that I can only vaguely recall but I remember cutting very, very deeply. Of course, they were being defensive because I was being offensive, and at the time (and for another couple months) I didn't really get this. I just sort of accepted that they were always a jerk to me and that I was in the right.

Which I really wasn't. In fact, I am looking to apologize today, as it has been weighing on my consciousness and just recently we had a long conversation over text planning on hanging out again. I don't know how much they remember the exchange, or if they were cognizant that it was the reason I didn't put much energy into hanging out with them for a while, but I need to apologize anyways. I can't let this sit in my head any longer. I'm gonna try and make up for past mistakes, and then maybe we can be as close as we were before. That would be very nice.

I don't know what I'm about to write, but I'm going to write it. I'm in a very bad place and writing and drawing are cathartic and help vent out the feelings. I can already feel myself ever so subtly calming down, though I don't imagine that will last much past after I finish writing this.

It's finals week, finals start tomorrow. After that, it's summer, and four days into summer I leave to Arizona to give immigrants across the border water and food after they cross the desert. I'll be there with my brother and a couple of friends. It'll be hot and ridiculous and I have no idea how I'll feel. Last time I was on a trip away from home I broke down. Feeling disconnected from everything, like I have no say in what happens because it's not happening near me, that's for sure. Out of my control. I've been feeling my heartbeat in my gut, and I haven't been eating much. I hear that's a normal depressive thing. Right now is the //worst// time to be relapsing into depression. I haven't been studying for finals, I haven't been doing the work, I've totally crumbled. I don't have good grades that I can use as crutches either, if I don't do well this week I might fail. That's unacceptable. What I thought was a bug bite on my arm is suddenly very large and very red. Looks to be a sunburn. How'd that happen?

I have an album I listen to when I'm sad, it seems impossible to remain unhappy while listening to it. Unfortunately, it's a temporary solution. Lemon Demon's Spirit Phone is an amazing album, probably the best of 2016. I have most songs on it memorized. The best ones are Cabinet Man, Sweet Bod, and Spiral of Ants. Oh, and Reaganomics. Because holy shit, Reaganomics. If you're a fan of lyrics that have actual substance and tell weird twisted stories combined with electronic dance music on top of intentional cluster chords to make it sound intentionally choppy and odd. It's quite the combination. I first listened to it when I was having a terrible time last year.

It was first semester of this school year, and I was crying in bed. I don't remember what exactly it was this specific time. But it wasn't good. My friend, the one I talked of in "On Past Mistakes", let's call them... Tanooki. He had been raving about this album day in and day out. I have never been huge on music (though I have oddly specific tastes, I'll get into that at a later date), but I was in a terrible spot and I needed something to distract me. I remembered Lemon Demon's Spirit Phone, and I thought "fuck it, I need //something//". I put it on. I can't communicate the effect it had on me.

Every song made me just a little less stressed, just a little happier, a little more optimistic. I don't know if there's even a rationale to why it worked so well on me. I just listened and it... worked. It made things click. It marks the turning point for when I started pulling out of that depression. It is now a regular ritual to listen to the album all the way through when I start getting sucked back in. It's not working as well right now. Which worries me. I don't know how this summer is going to go, but my bet is set on badly. Even if it doesn't, I feel like I might perceive it that way. I'm holding people back. Things are out of my hands. I'm letting people down. All this and more on the next episode of Dark barfs his feelings at the internet! I really hope I'm wrong.
