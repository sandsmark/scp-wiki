You made it to my author page! I, [[*user DarkStuff]], have created three successful articles at some point. By the time you are reading this, I might have made more. This author page is probably gonna be very bare for a while, and you're gonna have to just wait for me to put more effort into it. Yay!

[[[SCP-2728]]]  |  On the Barcelona Skyline
//This was my first successful skip. Though successful is subjective. First skip that wasn't downvoted to hell. I wanted something short and sweet, where a seemingly predictable anomaly throws the Foundation a curve ball and the Foundation misses.//

[[[SCP-2729]]]  |  The Throats of the Earth Hum & Howl
//Wanted to have some trippy sinkhole imagery. Something you might find on an album cover. This was that. It didn't turn out so well, but I enjoyed writing it and I learned from it so it is a success for me personally. Might rewrite it someday though, with more gusto.//

[[[SCP-3018]]]  |  France & the Tale of the Well-Intentioned Understudies
//This one was wonky. Had an idea of some woodboring beetles fighting off a forest god, and then it became more beetle focused and less god focused, and then I realised I just liked the beetles more, so I removed the god entirely. I then had to find out what the "gimmick" was, and when I did that I realised the bugs didn't have to be sapient anymore, so I left it debatable. Many, many changes and an impatient author made this get posted a bit prematurely, and it's first impression suffered because of it. I worked in an addendum that gave more story and substance, but it was a bit late. Still proud of it though.//
