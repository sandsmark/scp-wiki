[[# First-Encounter]]**__First Encounter__**

Initial reports of disappearance of a salvage operation regarding [[[SCP-455]]] led to its classification in our databases. A research team of five members was dispatched to confirm status of civilian researchers. This team consisted of two field analysts and three security personnel. Due to the low threat level initially given to the beached cargo vessel, no direct radio contact was maintained with this team. Standard procedure dictates one contact to their Control Headquarters(HQ) every 24 hours. After three days of uneventful activity, the team failed to report in; dispatched five days after the initial team, a secondary team arrived at the wreck to investigate the lapse in communication and perform possible search and rescue operations for the missing group. This team consisted of ten standard field agents carrying gear suitable for confrontation with humanoid aggressors. 
[[# Search and Rescue]]**__Search and Rescue__**
Upon searching the vicinity of [[[SCP-455]]], the S&R contingent discovered an encampment of the first research group left in a condition that suggested an anticipated return. A rice cooker left running for several days contained heavily burnt food. Research laptops were left on and running, powered by the camp’s portable generator. An analysis of the reports on the laptop indicated zero unusual activity from their base of operations or from [[[SCP-455]]]; the reports remained mundane up until the date of ceased communications. The last entry mentions recording of human voices coming from deep within [[[SCP-455]]] along with the departure of the team to investigate for any possible missing survivors from the salvage operation.

After reporting in the state of Team 1’s camp, Team 2 was ordered to maintain constant radio contact by means of the remote communication system already established by the prior team. The following is an abbreviated transcript of the audio recorded during Team 2’s investigation of [[[SCP-455]]] in search of Team 1.

> **T2L**: HQ, this is T2L, please respond.
> 
> **HQ**: T2L, this is HQ. We have you loud and clear.
> 
> **T2L**:Understood HQ, we are above deck on the vessel now. Sun is still up; the inner hold is visible but only for a few meters. Flashlights have minimal effect. We’re forgoing direct descent into the hull and instead are going to use the stairs to the crew decks to proceed further, in order to ensure we’re not separated. Is this acceptable, HQ?
> 
> **HQ**: Roger, T2L, you have complete discretion from here forward. We’ve been out of contact with Team 1 for a couple days now already; a few more minutes won’t hurt them. Proceed swiftly but cautiously.

> **T2L**: HQ, this is T2L, we’ve got an anomaly here.
> 
> **HQ**: T2L, this is HQ, what’s the situation?
> 
> **T2L**: We’re reached the third level of decks, but it has taken us approximately half an hour to get down this far. Somethings not quite right about the distance between floors for us to be spending ten minutes to traverse each one.
> 
> **HQ**: Understood T2L, we recommend you send one member back up to the surface and then have him return. Please update us to the elapsed time.

<**Inconsequential Audio Deleted**>

> **T2L**: T2L here, HQ. We sent up a man as advised and he returned in four minutes. Sent him back twice in a sprint, two minutes. We all recorded thirty to get down this far at least, and we all recorded our scout's return times as well. Something is very wrong here.
> 
> **HQ**: Proceed as planned T2L, time lapses have been recorded but we see no need to abort mission over this. Please use precautions when these lapses occur and immediately try to raise us should you suspect one so we can confirm time since last contact. In addition, if radio silence is encountered use utmost discretion. Acknowledged, T2L?

> **T2L**: HQ, this is T2L, please repeat?
> 
> **HQ**: T2L, where the hell have you been?
> 
> **T2L**: Um...we... we were just talking sir.
> 
> **HQ**: How long ago?!
> 
> **T2L**: S...Sir! Thi...thirty seconds? Maybe fifty? Guys? *sounds of approval* Yeah, less than a minute.
> 
> **HQ**: T2L, please be advised: we’ve been out of contact with you for sixteen hours, give or take. 
> 
> **T2L**: S...Sir? That can’t be right, you were just...
> 
> **HQ**: Listen, I have no fucking clue what is going on out there, but this is what I want you to do. Get to the bottom of those god damn stairs, search the hold, report back as soon as you get there, and then haul ass out. Do I make myself clear?
> 
> **T2L**: Sir, yes sir! Out!

<**Inconsequential Audio Deleted**>

> **T2L**: Sir, we’re apparently at the bottom of the ship now; five floors down by our count, standard for a cargo vessel this size. We’re approaching the hold now and...
> 
> **HQ**: ...T2L, this is HQ... and?
> 
> **T2L**: Something is... odd... about the door, sir.
> 
> **HQ**: I'm not standing beside you holding your hand, T2L. We need details. Define odd.
> 
> **T2L**: Well it’s pristine, sir. The rest of the ship is something of a shit hole but this door looks like it just came out of the metal press.
> 
> **HQ**: Noted, T2L. Proceed through using maximum caution; weapons ready.
> 
> **T2L**: Sir yes sir! Proceeding to open the door. 
> *//audio confirmed as the disengaging of a locking mechanism//* 
> **T2L**: We’re looking at the hold now, sir, and moving forward.
> 
> **HQ**: Remain radio silence for now, T2L. Focus on searching the hold and getting your ass topside.
> 
> *//Background sound of a door being shut, along with the audio analyzed to be a locking system rotating back into place//*
> 
> **T2L**: The fuck? Did you close that? 
>*A response in the negative; later computer analysis finds legitimate emotional levels of uncertainty and fear in their voices; none of the squad members are responsible.*     >**T2L**: What the hell… We appear to be locked in now, HQ, but we can see daylight above us, so we can probably rappel out if the door won’t… Wait.. What is that..? HQ, there appears to be people down here with us, I estimate fifteen or so people in the corner huddled together. They look injured; we’re approaching.
> 
> . . . . . .
> 
> **T2L**: Hey, that’s Don! Don! Wake up! Wake… oh… oh fuck. HQ, come in, HQ, come in, come in..!
> 
> **HQ**: T2L, this is HQ, what's the current situation?
> 
> **T2L**: We found the salvage team and the first team..they’re here and… I don’t know if they’re alive or not but they’re--
> 
> **HQ**: T2L? They’re what, T2L? Respond!
> 
> **T2L**: …Wait, where did Ramses go? He was right… Daniel! Vincent?! What the fuck… HQ, come in we just lost three… no four, four members.
> 
> **HQ**: T2L.. make sense! What do you mean lost? I hear no weapons fire.
> 
> **T2L**: They've just vanished, sir.. they were standing behind us at flank and they’re just GONE. .. Spencer? What’s… someone shine a light on Spencer… Where’d he go?! Son of a bitch…
> 
> **HQ**: T2L, what’s going on in there?
> 
> **T2L**: HQ, we've now lost five men apparently.. Make that six! Please advi-

> 
> **HQ**: T2L?! T2L Respond! Respond?! Where the hell did he go now--
> 
> **T2L**?****: HQ?! COME IN, HQ?!
>
> **HQ**: T2L, we're here..please respond.
> 
> **T2L**?****: Oh shitohshitohshit they responded..! Guys! HQ responded! HQ, this is Baker.. I'm here with Jensen and Thomas from Team 2 sent to..
> 
> **HQ**: We know who you’re with, Baker, we were just talking to T2L maybe ten seconds ago, where is—
> 
>**BKR**: H..HQ, we haven’t heard from you in two weeks.. We’re out of rations, although we were fortunate to find some food in one of the crew rooms. Johnso-..T2L.. has been dead since we were in the hold. He.. he went to investigate the people in the hold, and as soon as he approached them, that hatch in the back, it flew open, made an agonizing noise. We all turned around to look at it, then back to T2L… he was gone, him and those people in the corner, just gone, like the others.. We searched the ship; up and down, up and down, but we never found him… or the rest..
> 
> **HQ**: Did you return to the surface for supplies, Baker? That ship should only be five floors at mos—
> 
> **BKR**: We… we never thought to do that. This ship is at least thirty floors HQ, at least! But we found a crew quarters with food and we’ve been…
> 
> **HQ**: Baker, our first team reported that ship had been ashore for at least thirty years, possibly even longer than that. What exact food did you find there that was edible?
> 
> …..
> 
> **HQ**: Baker?
> 
> **BKR**: ….Thirty.. years..?
> 
> **HQ**: Baker, listen closely. I want you, and whoever is left, to get topside immediately. We are dispatching a rescue team to—

A third team of heavily armed recon units was dispatched to the [[[SCP-455]]] site and investigated the cargo hold from above deck using high wattage flashlights and emergency flares. No trace of any life was in the hold, nor were there any trace that life had been present for several decades. Reports indicate a layer of dust and rust approximated to be an inch thick, as estimated by its dispersal and thick clouding caused by the dropping of flares into the hold. Team Three was recalled and a high priority research team deployed to [[[SCP-455]]] to ascertain the fate of all three missing groups.

[[# Ripcord]]**__Ripcord__**
In response to the unexplained failure of the first two teams, a third team was assembled; comprised of several veteran members with far more experience in supernatural phenomenon and risk-factor exploration. This contingent was comprised of five individuals; working alongside them was a technician who would remain outside SCP-455 at all times to maintain a constant communications link to the team. Unbeknownst to Team 3, a fourth Team, codename  ‘Ripcord’, was comprised of five members as well. Ripcord was put on standby on site approximately ten miles away from the craft. Their purpose was immediate emergency evacuation of Team 3 should it become necessary, and they were to proceed to SCP-455’s site subsequently after Team 3 entered in order to reduce response time.

Team 3’s issued gear included two separate video recording units, one issued to the leader, T3L, and one to a video specialist, T3V. This was deemed necessary due to the lapses in time experienced during Team 2’s investigation. One member of Team 3 was instructed to enter SCP-455 through the cargo loading area directly and would be tethered to land by a pulley system.

> **HQ**: T3L, this is HQ, we are online and receiving feeds over.
> 
> **T3L**: Roger HQ, this is T3L. We are preparing to enter the ship via the stairs. Evans is in position at the cargo hold.
> 
> **HQ**: Understood. Proceed through both entrances and move directly to the cargo hold to rendezvous with Evans. T3V is recording his descent and all flood lights are active within the hold as well as the ones on the deck.

Team 3's primary force proceeded down the stairs into SCP-455, while its secondary unit descended into the cargo hold where Team 2 had disappeared. Within three minutes of descending into SCP-455, the primary force's video feed ended along with radio contact. Meanwhile, the secondary force experienced no issues at all and waited in the cargo hold under the observation of T3V, who recorded what consisted of five minutes of Evans walking in circles, dancing a brief jig, and waving up at the camera grinning. HQ considered sending T3V to investigate the stairs, but it was decided that full attention should be paid to Evans who was within SCP-455 and experiencing no anomalous activity. During the mounting concern on whether to abort or proceed with the mission, T3L's video and audio feed returned.

> **HQ**: T3L respond immediately, over. We lost the feed to you, what happened?
> 
> **T3L**: HQ?! HQ COME IN! FOR GOD... You're there.. oh god... th... this is T3L... We've lost a man... Somehow the rest of us are still alive... This place it's... it's...
> 
> **HQ**: T3L how much time has passed for your unit?
> 
> **T3L**: T..time? Ten hours sir. We came down here ten hours ago and...
> 
> **HQ**: Now slow down T3L. Are you in a safe location at this current moment?
> 
> **T3L**: Yes we're... we're fine in this room... seems to be some sort of food storage...
> 
> **HQ**: Touch **NOTHING** in that room, T3L, and listen closely to me. The mission has been in progress for five minutes. Evans is in the hold... apparently doing the Hammer now... I want you to detail to me exactly what has happened and you are not to leave that room until you do so. Do not eat anything in that room. Take a breath, secure the entryway, then talk to me.

After confirming the hallway exit was secure, T3L explained that they had proceeded down twenty floors within the ship; outside divers asserted that at most the ship contains six floors. Meanwhile, T3V was instructed to raise Evans back out of the cargo area and secure him topside before prepping the rest of Ripcord for evacuation; with or without Team 3. 

> **T3L**: O-okay... okay... relax...relax..we're going to be okay... Alright, HQ.. We proceeded down the stairs as normal. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary until we noticed we had gone down far more flights than it should have taken to get to the bottom to enter the cargo area. We sent Erik up to retrace our steps and he was only able to go up two floors. We had descended at my count at least fifteen. There was no hatch back to the surface, the stairs just went up to the ceiling and ended, we could everything he said from our location. Erik then said the floor hatch was open and he saw someone in it leaning against a wall.. They were well within earshot of us as well, but hadn't reacted to any of our conversation...
> 
> **HQ**: Keep going T3L.
> 
> **T3L**: So... Erik... he goes through the hatch to try and figure out who this person is... they hadn't moved, hadn't shown any hostility, and according to him they weren't even looking our direction, like we didn't exist to them. Suddenly we heard gunfire so we humped ass up the two flights and it was just like he said; the stairs stopped at the ceiling and the floor hatch was open. Nobody was in that hallway, not a soul.. No bullet shells, no second person, and no goddamn Erik.. Nothing... but the walls...
> 
> **HQ**: The walls, T3L..?
> 
> **T3L**: The walls were... wrong, hazy, like you were viewing them through a gas leak. They were flowing and fluid; just.. //wrong//.. I closed the hatch. I.. I don't know why I didn't go in and look for Erik but I just... I felt like I couldn't. I wrote him off as lost immediately. I wasn't going in there or sending any of my men in there after him.
> 
> **HQ**: ..Understood T3L. Keep going.
> 
> **T3L**: So the rest of the squad.. we go back down the stairs.. We can't go up, and we're __not__ going in that hallway. All the rest of the floors were closed off. We went down.. maybe ten more flights... Then the stairs started changing. Before, they were solid metal, most likely aluminum, but now there were holes in the steps, and the metal looked rusted in some places, old. Like the rest of the ship. Up until now everything had seemed rather clean; it didn't dawn on me until then that the clean parts were actually stranger than the old parts...
> 
> **T3L**: We found a food storage area down here.. Everything seems in good shape, betraying their actual age, but we didn't touch any of it yet... I read the Team 2 logs. I sent a man out into the hall to see what we could do on this floor. There seems to be a series of ladders in a group at the far end, but the entirety of this floor is food storage... it actually doesn't make sense why there are so many of these rooms. I'm talking over twenty on this one floor, and they're all big enough for ten people to stand inside and have room to move. Some of them are locked... probably for the best.
> 
> **HQ**: And the ladders?
> 
> **T3L**: We haven't gone down them yet. Wanted to see if we could get someone from the outside first.
> 
> **HQ**: __Down__? They go //__DOWN__//??! What the hell is going... Look, I don't want to put any of you at risk, but we need to find a way to get out of there. If you can't go back up, and you can only go down, only send one man. T3V and Evans are topside and perfectly fine. We're sending a diving crew around the ship exterior to see if we can pinpoint your location inside it using thermal imaging.
> 
> **T3L**: Understood, sir. However, I don't want to lose another one.. after he goes in, we'll follow suit to make sure he isn't left behind.

Contact with T3L was lost after this transmission. Divers around SCP-455 could not effectively scan the ship wreckage through the thermal apparatus; they had no explanation for this phenomenon except that the internal temperature of the ship must be vastly different than that of the waters surrounding it. 

[[# Aftermath]]**__Aftermath__**
At sunrise, T3V and Evans were ordered to return to SCP-455 and re-investigate the ship again through the cargo hold. Upon activation of the cargo lights, all missing members of Team 3 were found within the cargo hold with vital signs but were in an apparent catatonic state; all were accounted for except for Erik, whom went missing as per the Team 3 recordings. Team 2 and the original research group still remained missing. Oddly enough, despite the layer of dust accumulation, no footprints All remaining members remained in a state of stasis until removed from the ship and left undisturbed for approximately an hour. Each of their testimonies attest to moving down the mentioned ladders in the last transmission, but can recall nothing after that point that would lead to them being present in the cargo hold. With Team 3's exploration over, the next recommended course of action is robotic exploration.
