**Explorative Logs of [[[SCP-455]]]**

**First Encounter**

Initial reports of disappearance of a salvage operation regarding [[[SCP-455]]] led to its classification in our databases. A research team of five members was dispatched to confirm status of civilian researchers. This team consisted of two field analysts and three security personnel. Due to the low threat level initially given to a beached cargo vessel no direct contact was kept with this team. Team orders required one contact to their Control HQ every 24 hours. After three days of uneventful activity team failed to report in and after two days of lost contact a secondary team was dispatched to investigate lapse in communication. This team consisted of ten standard field agents with standard gear for confrontation with humanoid aggressors. 

A search of the vicinity of [[[SCP-455]]] discovered encampment of the first research team in a condition that suggested an anticipated return. A rice cooker left running for several days contained heavily burnt food. Research laptops were left on and running, powered by the camp’s portable generator. An analysis of the reports on the laptop indicated minimal activity of note from the site or from [[[SCP-455]]], up until the date of ceased communications. The last entry mentions recording of human voices coming from deep within [[[SCP-455]]] and a departure of the team to investigate for possible missed survivors from the salvage operation.

After reporting in the state of Team 1’s camp, Team 2 was ordered to maintain constant radio contact through the remote system already on camp. What follows is an abbreviated transcript of the audio recorded during Team 2’s investigation of [[[SCP-455]]] in search of Team 1.

> *sktttt* HQ this is T2L please respond.
> 
> T2L this is HQ we have you loud and clear over.
> 
> Understood HQ we are above deck on the vessel now. Sun is still up, we can see into the hold but not very far. Flashlights also aren’t helping matters much. We’re forgoing direct descent into the hull and are going to use the stairs to the crew decks and access it from there so we’re not separated. Is this acceptable HQ, over?
> 
> Roger T2L you have complete discretion from here forward, over. We’ve been out of contact with Team 1 for a couple days now already; a few more minutes won’t hurt them. Proceed swiftly but cautiously.

> HQ this is T2L we’ve got an anomaly here, over.
> 
> T2L this is HQ what’s the situation?
> 
> We’re on deck three so far of the vessel sir but it has taken us like, half an hour to get down this far. Something not quite right about the distance between floors for us to spend ten minutes getting between each.
> 
> Understood T2L, we suggest you send one member back up to the surface and then have him return; please update us to the elapsed time, over.

<**Inconsequential Audio Deleted**>

> T2L here HQ, we sent up a man as advised and he returned in four minutes. Sent him back twice in a sprint, two minutes. We all recorded thirty to get down this far at least, and we all recorded our scouts return times as well. There is definitely something inconsistent.
> 
> Proceed as planned T2L, time lapses have been recorded but we see no need to abort mission over this. Please use precautions when these lapses occur and immediately try to raise us should you suspect one so we can confirm time since last contact. In addition if radio silence is encountered use utmost discretion.

<**Inconsequential Audio Deleted**>

> HQ this is T2L please repeat?
> 
> T2L where the flying fist fuck have you been?
> 
> Um...we...we were just talking sir.
> 
> How long ago?!
> 
> S...Sir! Thi...thirty seconds? Maybe fifty? Guys? Yeah, less than a minute.
> 
> T2L please be advised we’ve been out of contact with you for sixteen hours, give or take, over
> 
> S...Sir? That can’t be right, you were just..
> 
> Listen, I don’t know what the shit is going on out there but this is what I want you to do. Get to the bottom of those fucking stairs, search the hold, report back as soon as you get there, and then get the fuck out, do I make myself clear?
> 
> Sir, yes sir! Out!

<**Inconsequential Audio Deleted**>

> Sir we’re apparently at the bottom of the ship now, five floors down by our count, standard for a cargo vessel this size. We’re approaching the hold now and..
> 
> ..T2L this is HQ...and?
> 
> Something is...odd... about the door sir.
> 
> Details T2L. Define odd.
> 
> Well it’s pristine Sir. The rest of the ship is something of a shit hole but this door looks like it just came out of the metal press.
> 
> Noted T2L, proceed through using maximum caution, weapons ready.
> 
> Sir yes sir! Proceeding to open the door *background lock system can be heard disengaging* We’re looking into the hold now sir and moving forward.
> 
> Remaining silent for now T2L, focus on searching the hold and getting topside.
> 
> *background sound of door slamming closed and lock system rotating back into place*
> 
> The fuck, did you close that? (Fainter) No, sir! It did it on its own (T2L) What the hell… we appear to be locked in now HQ but we can see daylight above us so we can probably rappel out if the door won’t… what is that? HQ there appear to be people down here with us, estimated fifteen or so people in the corner huddled together. They look injured, we’re approaching.
> 
> . . . . . .
> 
> Hey, that’s Don. Don! Man! Wake up! Wak… oh… oh fuck. HQ come in HQ come in come in.
> 
> T2L this is HQ what is it?
> 
> We found the salvage team and the first team, they’re here and… I don’t know if they’re alive or not but they’re part of the floor sir.
> 
> Part of the floor? Make sense T2L.
> 
> They’re… IN the floor, part OF the… wait, where did Ramses go? He was right… Daniel! Vincent?! What the fuck… HQ come in we just lost three… no four, four members.
> 
> T2L make sense, what do you mean lost? I hear no weapons fire.
> 
> They’re just gone sir, they were standing behind us at flank and they’re just GONE. .. Spencer? What’s… someone shine a light on Spencer… HOLY SHIT there’s some kind of, tendrils on us sir, oh god they’re on all of us, where did they come from?!
> 
> T2L get out of there, do you copy, get out of there?
> 
> They’re coming out of the floor! They just sucked Spencer straight into the fucking metal floor sir, gone! We’re arming the grappling guns now but we… I can’t get these things off me, it’s like they’re just holding onto us until it’s… there went Zimmerman, right into the wall sir! He ran for the door, and was pulled into the wa—*skreeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeerrrrrrskkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk*
> 
> T2L?! T2L Respond! Respond?!

A third team of heavily armed recon units was dispatched to the [[[SCP-455]]] site and investigated the cargo hold from above deck using high powered flashlights and flares. No trace of any life was in the hold, nor was there any trace there had ever been life there. Reports indicate a layer of dust and rust approximated to be an inch thick as determined by the cloud and dispersal caused by dropping of flares into the hold. Team three was recalled and a high priority research team deployed to [[[SCP-455]]] for deeper investigation as to fate of all three missing groups.
