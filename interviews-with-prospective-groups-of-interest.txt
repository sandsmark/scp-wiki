> **Dr. Clef:** Who are you again?
> 
> **ASCI Director:** The American Secure Containment Initiative. 
> 
> **Dr. Clef:** You can't just take two out of our three slogans like that.
> 
> **ASCI Director:** You're the ones who took our title. We're your predecessor, one of them at least.
> 
> **Dr. Clef:** If you're gonna become us, why are you here? 
> 
> **ASCI Director:** Apparently, predecessors are still classified as minor GoIs. 
> 
> **Dr. Clef:** Buddy, didn't you see the job ad? We're looking for villains. If you will become us in the future, you can't be the villains. That will make us, the heroes, look bad.
> 
> **ASCI Director:** I can at least join the winning side, right? 
> 
> **Dr. Clef:** ... I'm afraid you're mistaken, friend. You will never join the winning side. You're just a stale reductionist representative. Folks like me are forever the winning side, but we always find use for lackeys and cannon fodder. [smiles]

> **Robo-Dude:** I AM ROBO-DUDE, A INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF DR. WONDERTAINMENT. I AM HERE TO COLLECT THE FREE DRINKS, ROBO-PAL.
> 
> **Dr. Clef:** Why? You are a robot.
> 
> **Robo-Dude:** NOT FOR ME BUT DR. WONDERTAINMENT. I AM HERE TO COLLECT THE FREE DRINKS FOR DR. WONDERTAINMENT.
> 
>  **Dr. Clef:** Why don't he come and get them himself?
> 
> **Robo-Dude:** DO NOT INTIMIDATE ROBO-DUDE. DR. WONDERTAINMENT IS A BUSY TOY MAKER  AND THIS VERSION OF ROBO-DUDE COMES EQUIPPED WITH AN ATOMIC GRENADE IN THE EVENT YOU FAIL TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE PROMISED FREE DRINKS.
> 
> **Dr. Clef:** Kinda extreme for a toy... Kids these days are so lucky. Anyway, the drinks are at that table next to the bowl of chips, which is mine so no touching that.
> 
> **Robo-Dude:** THANK YOU, ROBO-PAL.
> 
> **Dr. Clef:** You know Dr. Wondertainment should pay an actual visit next time. They could make-

> **Dr. Clef:** Did he really just take //all// the damn soda?

> **Dr. Clef:** So, bottom line, you're a circus?
> 
> **Herman Fuller:** Not just any circus, my good man. Herman Fuller's Circus of the Disquieting is //The// Circus, the Greatest Show in all the Worlds! Surely you've heard of us.
> 
> **Dr. Clef:** …
> 
> **Herman Fuller:** You're joking.
> 
>  **Dr. Clef:** Well, I remember there were a few good scips about you a few years ago, then there was almost nothing until last year when we started getting all these weird stories coming in for some reason.
> 
> **Herman Fuller:** That's right, we've got a cannon now!
> 
> **Dr. Clef:** A canon?
> 
> **Herman Fuller:** That's right, Alty, a 90-foot-long cannon: solid cast iron, fires balls three feet wide, and is accurate to within 3 miles. Don't tell me that doesn't make us a formidable enemy!
> 
> **Dr. Clef:** Look, Mr. Fuller, every time we try to raid your Circus you just vanish into thin air. We're looking for an enemy that's a little more… menacing.
> 
> **Herman Fuller:** More menacing? More menacing? Sir, you show me one six-year-old in the world who isn't afraid of Clowns and then say we're not menacing!
> 
> **Dr. Clef:** We don't employ six-year-olds, so that's a moot point. Hey, come to think of it, last I read you weren't even still in charge of the Circus of the Disquieting.
> 
> **Herman Fuller:** I assure you, sir, I have no idea what you're talking about.
> 
> **Dr. Clef:** In fact, you're supposed to be in containment. You're a mediocrely rated [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3440 |SCP]]]  now.
> 
>  **Herman Fuller:** I have had enough of these preposterous accusations! Good day sir!
> 
>  **Dr. Clef:** Don't get your strings caught in the door on your way out, Pinocchio.

> **Dr. Clef:** General, weren't you guys defeated in the Pacific War?
> 
> **Kakure Shogun:** Yes, that happened. Circumstances beyond IJAMEA's control, to be precise. But we have survived the war, and infiltrated almost all segments of society.  
> 
> **Dr. Clef:** Standard secret organisation, eh?
> 
> **Kakure Shogun:** We have factions like the Kakure Shogun and Jirai. In English, they are 'hidden generals' and 'landmine' respectively. 
> 
> **Dr. Clef:** General, look. We already have ORIA and GRU-P for our obligatory foreign organisation GoI. Three's a crowd. And yellow peril's so dead. Your group has absolutely no appeal at all. 
> 
> **Kakure Shogun:** Doctor, I will not tolerate Orientalism. This is about the sacrifices of many people who died at war. Can you just let people die for nothing?
> 
> **Dr. Clef:** Speaking of dying, we beat your entire group. And that's your place, buddy. [snaps finger]
> 
> [Kakure Shogun is replaced with a human skeleton, which quickly crumbles to dust.]

> [Dr. Clef stares blankly at the empty chair in his office, nodding his head.]
> 
> **Dr. Clef:** I see you are truly Nobody. I think we can fit you in whenever we feel like it. Next!

------

> **Dr Clef:** And... you represent? 
>
> **Generic Waffen-SS Commander:** I am here on behalf of ze Obskurakorps of ze Third Reich. Hei- [He is cut short by a bullet to the head.]
> 
> **Dr Clef:** Yeah, no. Fuck Nazis.

> **Grand Karcist Ion:** Pleasure to meet you, Clef. 
> 
> **Dr. Clef:** Indeed, Grand Karcist. Please tell me more about this Sarkicism. 
> 
> **Grand Karcist Ion:** [visibly irritated] Firstly, I would prefer if you do not use the s-word. This is 2017. We should not be subject to such language.
> 
> **Dr. Clef:** I'm sorry, 'hon. Keep on talking. 
> 
> **Grand Karcist Ion:** I represent the Nälkä, an ancient religion dated back to what you would call the Bronze Age. Our faith's tenets include the shepherding of the flesh-
> 
> **Dr. Clef:** Ah, that's your schtick! You can be the obligatory antagonists if we need some body horror and unspeakably ancient religion! Thank you for coming down today, Grand Karcist. 
> 
> **Grand Karcist Ion:** Wait! I haven't told you our deity's UST with the Broken God and our equally ancient war with the Church of the Broken God!
> 
> **Dr Clef:** That's a bit unnecessarily complicated. Besides, the focus should be the Foundation. If you're so fixated with the Church of the Broken God, why don't you go to their interview site?
> 
> [Grand Karcist Ion disappears from Dr. Clef's office.]
> 
> **Dr. Clef:** Our original proposition still stands, if you're still interested!
