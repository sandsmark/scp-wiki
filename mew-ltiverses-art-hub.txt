Red Reality is my absolute favorite SCP of all time. I just sketched this boi up, but I plan on doing a full piece representing the SCP at some point.

This was an experiment with a kinda au thing where Gerald got around 2295, that’s why there are so many patches on him haha. And I drew him with a cane, because the dude’s been injured over 64 times.

I’ve drawn him before, but I wanted to do something nicer aha. This is my character Researcher Oliver Crane. He’s mentioned in a few of my SCPs, but his story and personality aren’t expanded upon.

I drew this because I wanted a drawing representing how Crane’s mind isn’t fully there always, as he’s got some really bad demons.

I’ve developed this character a lot and hardly used him rip. I need to write with him more.

Anyway, this portrait style drawing was fun to do. ^^

I made this when talking to my friend about posting one of my SCPs convinced it would fail, and to be fair, it didn’t do amazing. It’s still on the main site tho, and I’m working to improve it.
