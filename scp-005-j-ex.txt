**Item #:** SCP-005-J-EX

**Object Class:** --Keter-- Explained

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-005-J-EX now appears to arise spontaneously in approximately 15% of all humans, and is no longer considered anomalous.  Nevertheless, as a training exercise (and as a public service) Mobile Task Force Gamma-5 ("Red Herrings") are currently attempting to generate a counter-meme: that SCP-005-J-EX is "really annoying" and should be suppressed.  No other containment procedures appear possible.  MTF Gamma-5 personnel are required to perform an Allen-Pryor test at least once per month to ensure contagion has not occurred.

**Description:** SCP-005-J-EX is a cognitohazardous meme.  It consists of the idea that a joke or humorous anecdote will remain funny once it has been explained.  When instances of SCP-005-J-EX arise, all remnants of humour in the relevant joke are completely [DATA EXPUNGED].

The following are extracts from the testing logs for Class D personnel testing positive for SCP-005-J-EX:

> **D-4698:** You heard me say it was a duck?  Because that way...

> **D-2663:** Get it?  It sounds like you're crying - boo hoo.  Boo hoo?  So then I say...

> **D-7984:** No?  You know that people from ██████████ are all really stupid, right?  Okay, so the third guy thinks...

> **D-9909:** ...I guess you just had to be there.  But remember that Mike is a big guy...

> **D-2348:** It's kind of an anti-joke.  It's playing with the expectation of a punchline by giving the most banal motivation the chicken could have.

> **D-1003:** Just a pun on "explained", really.  Not much more to it than that.
