**Item #:** SCP-2591

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2591 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-25.

Personnel in charge of SCP-2591 are to be trained in the use of small firearms. In the event that SCP-2591 expresses the desire to self-terminate, containment staff are to offer assistance and shoot SCP-2591 once in the forehead. All staff are advised that these incidents have occurred [REDACTED] times in the past month with no ill effects on the overall health of SCP-2591-Alpha, and that execution of this request will extend cooperation on the part of SCP-2591.

As an incentive for good behavior, SCP-2591 may be provided tap water in a plastic wine glass, and if questioned, is to be informed that the water is actually an aged Merlot from the vineyards of "St. Augustine's Convent in the southern peninsula of Apostasia." Due to sensory issues inherent with its condition, SCP-2591 will believe this to be true.

SCP-2591-Omega is to remain on standby mode indefinitely in a maximum-security containment vault at Site-25. All readings are to be constantly monitored and submitted to Project Bifrost staff.

**Description:** SCP-2591 is an animate human cadaver, possessing a regenerative ability to extend life. As a result of this regeneration, SCP-2591's skin condition mimics the effects of mummification. It is estimated that SCP-2591 has been alive since the thirteenth century CE.

Though decay has resulted in diminished sensory capabilities, SCP-2591 can move, displays advanced intelligence, and is fluent in Italian, English, and French.[[footnote]] Despite this, SCP-2591 considers its mother tongue to be "Apostasian," which is //sung// Italian, English, or French. Due to the desiccated nature of SCP-2591's throat, this has been discouraged by Foundation staff. [[/footnote]] It will answer to the name Riccardo and claims to be the duke of the (historically nonexistent) Papal State of Apostasia.

SCP-2591 appears to be in a near-constant state of emotional distress brought about by events earlier in its life, and will frequently express the desire to commit suicide. Following a suicide attempt, SCP-2591's wounds will recover and it will awaken in a state of confusion.

> 
> **SCP-2591:** Apologies, it is difficult to explain. We held our vicious stance, prepared to slit each others' throats, and yet made no move. We were entranced, and sung nary a word.  It was not our intent to engage in such queer stasis; in truth, I know not why it happened. It had continued for years, taking the both of us far beyond our natural lifespans. [redacted for brevity]

(Following this interview, Dr. Henderson, upon request, was reassigned to SCP-████.)

**Recovery Log:** SCP-2591 was discovered through the usage of SCP-2591-Omega, which is an experimental prototype of a dimensional gateway found in the ruins of Prometheus Labs. Project Bifrost was established by the Foundation to resume full functionality of SCP-2591-Omega.

After [REDACTED] failed attempts, a connection was established to a relatively stable realm, designated Reality-GBICR259101. MTF Zeta-9 ("Mole Rats") was dispatched to explore the area and report any anomalous findings.

**Addendum:** Three months after the containment of SCP-2591, Dr. Naismith of Project Bifrost discovered similarities between the story of SCP-2591's life and an obscure, unfinished libretto for a 19th-century Italian three-act opera titled //Il Canario Rosso//[[footnote]] ("The Red Canary") [[/footnote]] by the Florentine playwright Giacomo Benigni. 

In a series of correspondence with composer Giusseppe Verdi, the offer to compose the music for the libretto was repeatedly rejected by Verdi, who considered Benigni's pre-existing body of work to be sub-par. [[footnote]] "... It is an utter impossibility that would collaborate with a writer with a portfolio that is not only amateurish, but pompous, financially opportunistic, and with melodrama that makes an unintentional farce of itself - to the point of provoking laughter in the crucifixion scene of a Passion play, as evidenced in the one successful operetta you've put on in Venice. ..." [[/footnote]] As a result, Benigni retired from writing before he finished //Il Canario Rosso//. 

The situation outlined by SCP-2591 mirrors the Act Two finale, where Duke Riccardo and Count Pietro prepare to duel. As Act Three was never written, the outcome of this duel remains unknown.
