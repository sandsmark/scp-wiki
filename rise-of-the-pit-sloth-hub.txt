Another year, another Halloween, another horror film festival. They had to cancel the one last year for obvious reasons-- you can't exactly run a film festival when you have a [[[Chapter 1 Corvophobia|scarecrow stuffed with the body of the festival's manager]]] appear in the middle of the popcorn machine. But, it's under new management now.

New management means lower-quality films have shown up. Passable indie horror that relies too much on jumpscares or has atmosphere but no payoff, a couple of low-budget movies that are as scary as vacation footage (mainly because they're shot like vacation footage) and, for some reason, someone decided it would be a good idea to make a film based on the //Holders Series// of all things. As if what they had done to Slender Man wasn't bad enough.

Still, there's one film that's attracting a lot of attention-- a sequel seemingly lacking a first installment. People push their way through the crowd to get a look at the poster.

The show's nearly sold out by the time you get a ticket. It's going to be the highlight of the festival, they say. You hear it's been filmed in town, even. 

You barely manage to grab a seat in time. Soon, the lights dim, and the movie begins.

++ [[[Chapter 1 Opening Credits|Opening Credits]]]

The scene opens on a bar somewhere in America. A woman drowns her sorrows in a pina colada. Something's stalking her on the way out, something from her past. Is this a slasher film? Someone behind you tells you to be quiet as your silent speculation leaves your mouth.

++ [[[Chapter 2 The Witch's Hut|The Witch's Hut]]]

Another woman works in the room of a costume shop. They're going all-out with the Halloween aesthetic. Next to you, you see someone from the newspaper taking notes for his review. You manage to read by the light of the screen that he thinks the actress is amateurish. 

++ [[[Chapter 3 From a Burning Screen|From a Burning Screen]]]

The projector stutters, briefly. An usher comes in to apologize, but the words are barely out of his mouth before the projector restarts. Unfortunately, the scene is //in medias res//, so they have to rewind it. Still, you catch a glimpse of a movie screen on fire, and what seems to be a horde of zombies. What kind of film is this?

++ [[[Chapter 4 Of Goats and Sloths and Flu|Of Goats and Sloths and Flu]]]

They're introducing //another// monster into the film. You can't decide whether the costume looks good or bad-- on the one hand, the jaw is well-articulated, but on the other, the 'Goatman' looks like he's missing several dozen pieces of fur. Still, it's fairly entertaining so far-- you don't mind the slightly cheesy costumes. This is an amateur production, after all.

++ [[[Chapter 5 Playing Dress-Up|Playing Dress-Up]]]

The film critic a couple of seats down lets out a groan-- the woman who made the film is somehow the villain of it. It's an interesting twist, but the writer is certainly no John Carpenter. Still, it introduces an interesting angle-- body snatchers.

++ [[[Chapter 6 Holes Shaped Like People|Holes Shaped Like People]]]

Another projector skip. This time, a couple of people leave to demand refunds, but again, it goes right back up. You could have sworn that your drink was empty, but now you find it full again. And there's some candy that you're sure you've never bought next to your bucket of popcorn. Hey, if it's free, it's free. 

You just ignore the fact that you see a hand sliding under your seat as you pick up the candy and sprinkle it into your popcorn.

++ [[[Chapter 7 S&C Phonies|S&C Phonies]]]

Your eyes are drawn away from the screen as someone's head explodes. There's a kerfuffle out in the lobby. You think you might hear sirens. Your bladder's full, so it might be a good time to get out to the lobby to check it out. You doubt anything interesting's going to happen anyway. So, popcorn down, you head out of the theater.
