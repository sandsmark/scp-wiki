**SCP involved:** [[[SCP-023]]]

**Personnel involved:** Dr. ████████, 5 D-Class personnel

**Date:** ██/██/██ - ██/██/██

**Location:** Site ██

**Description:**

In an attempt to curtail the danger posed by SCP-023, Dr. ████████ has approved the removal of both its eyes and teeth. Immediately after both its eyes were removed, SCP-023 breached security by vanishing completely. It was tracked down wandering a stretch of Interstate ███ at around 04:00 the next night, and brought back into containment, where D-Class personnel finished pulling out its teeth.

Timestamps confirmed over the course of the next 48 hours that SCP-023 vanished only while the sun was visible in the sky from outside Site ██.

**Addendum-023-26-a:**

As of ██/██/████, Dr. ████████ has been demoted to D-Class for gross incompetence in keeping SCP-023 contained. Dr. ████ is now in charge of SCP-023.
