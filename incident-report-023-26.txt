**SCP involved:** [[[SCP-023]]]

**Personnel involved:** Dr. ████████, 5 D-Class personnel

**Date:** ██/██/██ - ██/██/██

**Location:** Site ██

**Description:**

In an attempt to curtail the danger posed by SCP-023, Dr. ████████ has approved the removal of both 023's eyes and teeth. Immediately after both its eyes were removed, SCP-023 breached security by vanishing completely. SCP-023 was re-obtained on a stretch of Interstate ███ at 4:37 P.M., and brought back into containment, where D-Class personnel finished pulling out its teeth.

Timestamps confirmed over the course of the next 48 hours that SCP-023 vanished only while the sun was visible in the sky from outside Site ██.

**Addendum-023-026-1:**

As of ██/██/████, Dr. ████████ has been demoted to D-Class for contributing if to, if not being directly responsible for Incident-023-026. Dr. ████ is now in charge of SCP-023. 

//The increased difficulties in containment that have been incurred as a result of Dr. ████████ should serve to remind all personnel of The Foundation's purpose. Secure, Contain, and Protect. Research, experimentation, convenience, and even the safety of Foundation personnel are secondary concerns.  We are not working to protect ourselves.//
