**Item #:** SCP-057

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Site-57 has been constructed to facilitate SCP-057 as relocation is not feasible. It is highly improbable that any outside knowledge of SCP-057 exists based on the circumstances of its discovery and thus security is of minimal concern. No containment procedures are required other than the prevention of unauthorized access. All research is to be delegated to Dr. Lewis and Dr. Walston unless further specified by O5 Command.

Due to the irretrievability of those placed inside SCP-057, access will be granted with the approval of Site Director █████████ and no less than two (2) members of O5 Council.


**Description:** SCP-057 is a subterranean stone chamber with an approximate cylindrical height of three (3) meters and diameter of eighteen (18) meters. Inside the chamber are dozens of parallelepiped stone monoliths extending from floor to ceiling which slide in various directions while SCP-057 is active. It was discovered several meters below ███████ on ██/██/████ during the construction of a secure containment enclosure for SCP-███. Consequently, SCP-███ was assigned an alternate location at Site-██. 

An entrance to the chamber is located on the north-east side. When a human enters SCP-057, the door shuts and the walls inside the chamber move in such a way as to create a “path” requiring the subject's constant attention to maintain a safe course through the artifact. The path is slowly opened and closed by the moving monoliths until the human either surrenders or at last collapses of exhaustion, at which time SCP-057 crushes them and reverts to its original, inactive state. This process lasts only as long as the human inside SCP-057 is alive and can take days if necessary. All testing on animals, machines, or cadavers has proven futile. Only a living, breathing human being is able to initiate the “grinding” process upon entering SCP-057.

**Incident 057-1:**  During the excavation of SCP-057, a worker employed by the Foundation for the unearthing process entered the chamber without permission at roughly 12:57 AM on ██/██/████. Upon entering SCP-057, the door shut and a dull rumble began to emanate from the chamber. A Level 1 Lockdown Procedure was initiated and all personnel in the vicinity were evacuated. A Mechanized Surveillance Unit (MSU) was deployed in order to safely determine the cause of the event and to gauge the possible danger of SCP-057. Aside from the rumbling noises produced during the event, no anomalous effects outside of the SCP were observed. At 4:32 AM of the following day, SCP-057 appeared to suddenly shut down and return to its original state with the door shifted back into its open position. The worker in question was never recovered. At 5:32 AM, the area was declared safe and the excavation process was completed without further incident.

[[collapsible show="+ Experiment Log 057-1" hide="- Hide Experiment Log 057-1"]]
**Experiment Log 057-1:** A controlled experiment for the purpose of exploring the interior of SCP-057 was requested by Drs. Lewis and Walston on ██/██/████ and approved shortly thereafter by O5 Council. D-1021 was equipped with a radio able to send and receive transmissions to and from the Doctors. Upon entering the chamber, SCP-057 behaved as expected with the door abruptly shutting behind D-1021. The following is a transcript of the communication between Dr. Lewis, Dr. Walston and D-1021.


> **D-1021:** Hey, what the hell? You didn’t tell me the door would close behind me. Can you please open it?
>    
> **Dr. Lewis:** Negative. D-1021, proceed as advised and describe your surroundings.
>    
> **D-1021:** Ugh, okay. Well… There’s a bunch of stone columns in here, and they keep rearranging their positions. I - SHIT!
>    
> **Dr. Walston:** D-1021? What is your status?
>    
> **D-1021:** Damn column snuck up on me. They’re moving around, arranging themselves so they… [Pause] 
>    
> **Dr. Walston:** What is it?
>    
> **D-1021:** It’s as if they’re creating a path for me to follow. The columns behind me are closing up. The ones ahead of me are  spreading out... making a path. I don’t like this. [Inaudible] can’t see the door anymore.
>    
> **Dr. Lewis:** Stay calm. Follow the path the columns create and you’ll be fine.
>    
> **D-1021:** Oh fuck. I… If I stand still, they’ll crush me. I have to keep moving or they’ll crush me. [Pause] How long am I gonna be in  here?
>    
> **Dr. Walston:** It’ll be over soon. You’re doing fine. Just keep moving.
>    
> **D-1021:** But what if I’m trapped in here? What if the columns crush me? I… [D-1021 begins to hyperventilate] I’M TRAPPED AND THEY’RE GONNA CRUSH ME AND-
>    
> **Dr. Lewis:** D-102... D-1.. Hey, listen! Get a hold of yourself. The columns will eventually lead you to an exit. Stay on the path and you’ll be just fine.
>    
> [Subject appears to calm down]
>    
> **D-1021:**  So there’s… there’s an exit? Thank god. I was scared there for a second that I’d never-
>    
> **Dr. Walston:** Yep, keep it up and you’ll be right as rain. You’re doing a great job. Keep going and you’ll have no trouble making parole once this is over.
>    
> [The experiment continues without incident for another forty-one (41) minutes. At this point, D-1021 becomes noticeably distressed  again.]
>    
> **D-1021:** I think… I’ve been here before. This is near where I came in. Am I going in a circle?
>    
> **Dr. Lewis:** Negative. Continue to proceed through the opening columns. You should find the exit-
>    
> **D-1021:** There IS no fucking exit! You bastards trapped me in here and now I’m… I’m fucking TRAPPED! 
>    
> [Subject begins to hyperventilate again.]
>    
> **Dr. Walston:** You are not trapped, D-1021. Continue to the exit or you will be forced to-
>    
> **D-1021:** Forced to WHAT!? There's NOTHING ANYONE CAN DO! I’M GONNA FUCKING DIE I’M GONNA FUCKING DIE I’M GONNA-
>    
> **Dr. Lewis:** D-1021! Panicking will only exacerbate your situation. Keep calm and stay on the suggested path. 
>    
> [D-1021 breaks into tears. He continues to cry for the next two (2) hours as he makes his way through the columns and does not reply to any questions. Eventually, the crying ceases.]
>    
> **D-1021:** So this is it. [Deep exhalation] I’m gonna die. I guess I’ll just stop and close my eyes. Maybe it won’t be so bad.
>    
> **Drs. Lewis and Walston:** …
>    
> **D-1021:** I just… I can’t. I can’t. I can’t. I can’t. 
>    
> [D-1021 continues to repeat this for several minutes. Eventually he trails off and falls silent.]
>    
> **Dr. Walston:** D-1021?
>    
> [D-1021 stops in his tracks, breathing heavily. Faint sobbing can be heard.]
>    
> **Dr. Walston:** D-1021, proceed through the room as advised!
>    
> **D-1021:** I.. I…
>    
> [D-1021’s gentle sobbing abruptly cuts off. Brief cracking and snapping sounds are heard before transmission is lost. Strangely, D-1021 did not report any sightings of the remains of the excavation worker lost in Event 057-1. Accordingly, no efforts were made for the recovery of D-1021’s remains. As a result of this inconclusive data, reclassification of SCP-057 to Euclid is pending.]
