**Item #:** SCP-1985

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1985 is contained at Sub-Site-███. SCP-1985's containment chamber currently includes a computer with an Internet connection. All data sent to an outside network by SCP-1985 is managed by monitoring personnel. No real-time access is allowed. See Containment Protocol R-Zenith-13.

If SCP-1985 is judged to become a significant security risk due to exposure to another anomalous entity, device error, or any other reason, Protocol 1985-Adahn will be enacted. Protocol 1985-Adahn is classified Level 4 and will be automatically disseminated to all personnel involved with SCP-1985 in case of containment breach. 

SCP-1985 is to be kept in good condition and health. Ongoing research on SCP-1985-A is mandatory.

Mobile Task Force Omicron-1985 is responsible for retrieving SCP-1985 upon its return from an SCP-1985-A-triggered excursion. Deployment of mass amnestics is pre-approved if SCP-1985's return is witnessed by multiple members of the civilian populace.

SCP-1985 has been implanted with a tracking device and is currently allowed Class 1 (full/non-restricted) free-roaming and socialization privileges with approved site personnel, granted based on continued good behavior and additional classified information. Per Class 1 protocols, SCP-1985 is not allowed outside of approved areas of Sub-Site-███, and never allowed outside its containment without being accompanied by approved personnel (except upon temporary involuntary relocation). Approved personnel may interact with SCP-1985 under protocol guidelines, and may refer to SCP-1985 by its first name. Approval of personnel for Class 1 interaction with SCP-1985 is currently handled by Dr. Glass.

During excursions, SCP-1985 is to have assigned equipment (including all recording equipment) on its person at all times. All retrieved items are kept in a secure location, currently [REDACTED]

**Description:** SCP-1985 is a female human of African-American origin, named Jacqueline ███████. SCP-1985 has been implanted with a trans-universal teleportation device labelled SCP-1985-A, and claims that (a version of) the Foundation implanted it with this device. (See "Recovered Information".) When SCP-1985 dies, SCP-1985-A is activated.

SCP-1985 displays the following notable physical traits:

* Presence of SCP-1985-A.
* Drastically slowed aging process, apparently implemented around the physical age of twenty-seven. Pre-recovery use of amnestics and lack of records has made actual age difficult to discern. (See "Recovered Information".)
* Possible protection from some restructuring events. (See "Recovered Information".)
* Extensive scar tissue present throughout its body, both internally and externally (particularly around the spine and back of head) that is thought to have been caused by the implantation of SCP-1985-A.
* A history of clinical depression, anorexia nervosa, cancer, and alcoholism.
* **[Level 3 Access Granted]** SCP-1985 has a duplicate living in [REDACTED]. This duplicate is identical to SCP-1985 except for a complete lack of anomalous attributes.

SCP-1985-A is a trans-universal teleportation device implanted in SCP-1985's body. SCP-1985-A components are threaded throughout SCP-1985's body, including millions of ultra-thin components in its brain and spinal cord, and several large components located in its thorax and abdomen.

SCP-1985-A is usually activated when SCP-1985 dies (see below). Upon activation, it transports SCP-1985 to what appears to be a parallel reality. This parallel reality will usually [[footnote]]Approximately a 95% rate. The 5% error is thought to result from utilization of a slightly different K-class classification system than any in current or former use by present Foundation branches.[[/footnote]] be undergoing a K-Class scenario[[footnote]]Consistent with definitions used by the Jackson Hybrid K-class Classification System.[[/footnote]] The destination reality that SCP-1985 is transported to cannot be perfectly controlled, but certain realities can be targeted by "priming" SCP-1985. (See "Priming".)

Any material which SCP-1985 is holding or wearing, as well as any personnel it is touching at time of death, will be transported with it when SCP-1985-A activates (whether "leaving" or "returning"). Any equipment receiving a signal from transported equipment will continue to receive these signals, as if all equipment were still located in the same reality. SCP-1985 must intend to transport material; if SCP-1985 dies without intending to transport any material with it (for instance due to loss of consciousness for an extended period of time), no material will be transported. Upper limits on transported material is uncertain and appears to be variable based on unknown factors; experimentation is ongoing.

Upon transport to another reality, SCP-1985 is returned to life via unknown means, in a significantly altered physical state. Its body takes on a metallic appearance, and thin fibers are visible on its skin. In this altered state, SCP-1985 evidences a high level of resistance to all forms of physical injury, as well as many anomalous effects. It requires atypically low amounts of food, water, and oxygen for survival (meaning the processes of death by starvation, dehydration, and asphyxiation take place over a prolonged period of time). SCP-1985 remains in this altered state for as long as it remains in the destination reality.

SCP-1985-A will return SCP-1985 from its excursion once one of the following conditions are fulfilled:
* 6 (six) months have passed.
* SCP-1985 dies.
* SCP-1985 does not die, but is subject to completely crippling damage, or a loss of more than 10% of its body mass.
SCP-1985 always returns in a state identical to that when which it was killed, but alive and free of physical injury. On arrival, SCP-1985 appears in an apparently random location and must be retrieved. SCP-1985 has typically cooperated fully with such retrieval.

SCP-1985 claims that this six-month time period is a "default setting" that can be controlled with associated devices, and that SCP-1985-A can stay in the destination reality for several years before running out of power if necessary. 

Additionally, if SCP-1985 excursions are not regularly triggered, it will always undergo an automatic excursion event within 1 (one) month of the previous excursion. Mechanism for cause of death in this case is unclear; all bodily functions simply cease to operate simultaneously. SCP-1985 calls these "scheduled" excursions, and claims that this time frame may also be altered with control devices. These automated excursions (which Foundation personnel cannot effectively 'prime') may be avoided by regularly triggering primed excursions before any automated excursion can occur. 

Efforts to reconstruct SCP-1985-A control devices are currently underway.

Researchers have been able to access information stored in SCP-1985-A; this information has only been partially decrypted so far, but appears to corroborate SCP-1985's story. (See Recovered Information.)

According to information recovered from SCP-1985-A, in combination with Foundation excursions induced since recovery in 19██, SCP-1985 has been sent on a total of [REDACTED] excursions. Most these excursions have lasted only a few weeks, but [REDACTED] have lasted six months or more. 

[DATA EXPUNGED] The list of //distinct// scenarios (without duplicates, and following the Jackson Hybrid K-class Classification System) includes ███ XK-class Type Alpha (scorched earth) end of the world scenarios, ███ XK-class Type Omega (religious) end of the world scenarios, ███ AK-class "madness" end of the world scenarios, ██ EK-class "consciousness-loss" end of the world scenarios, ███ NK-class "grey goo" end of the world scenarios, ███ CK-class restructuring scenarios, ███ RK-class "out-competition" restructuring scenarios, ███ SK-class dominance shift scenarios, ███ IK-class collapse of global civilization scenarios, [DATA EXPUNGED] 

**Recovery:** SCP-1985 was recovered on ██/██/19██ in [REDACTED] Los Angeles, California, two days after it was witnessed by several locals in the act of appearing "out of thin air". SCP-1985 evaded witnesses and checked itself into a local hospital. SCP-1985 assumed that the Foundation was already preparing to recover it, and expressed confusion at the delay once Foundation personnel arrived. According to SCP-1985, the Foundation implanted it with SCP-1985-A and had been sending it on regular excursions, until contact was unexpectedly dropped midway through its last trip.

**Priming Excursions:** Though the exact reality to which SCP-1985 travels cannot be specifically controlled, it can be "primed" to travel to realities in which certain events are happening. This is achieved via exposing SCP-1985 to materials related to the goal topic in the period shortly before initiation of an excursion.

Simple priming has a base success rate of approximately 70%. For example, were SCP-1985 to read a document describing [[[SCP-455]]] and killed shortly thereafter, it would have a 70% likelihood of arriving in a reality in which a K-class scenario involving SCP-455 is taking place.

The success rate of priming can be increased by emotionally or physically agitating SCP-1985. Agitating SCP-1985 via methods unrelated to priming material results in a lower success rate. A representative example of this is Excursion 289-0AJ-PO5, in which SCP-1985 was primed with information about [REDACTED], and agitated via references to SCP-1985's homosexuality and religious background. This resulted in SCP-1985 traveling to a reality in which a Christianity-based cult had successfully exterminated all non-heterosexual humans via anomalous means, rather than a scenario matching the intended priming target.

Agitation caused by the content of the priming material is highly recommended. For instance, a document describing psychologically disturbing material associated with the priming target can result in a priming success rate as high as 93%. 

SCP-1985 may be primed to travel to a reality to which it has already traveled to. If priming is successful, SCP-1985 will always arrive in that reality significant before or significantly after any time which it had previously spent there. So far, attempts to induce SCP-1985 to enter a reality during the same time frame in which it previously had been present there have been unsuccessful.

**Protocol 1985-Adahn:** [DATA EXPUNGED]
[[collapsible show="+ Level 4 Clearance Required." hide="- Level 4 Access Granted"]]Protocol 1985-Adahn, also known as the "Kill Switch" protocol, is the last-resort protocol to be used if SCP-1985 is involved in or constitutes a serious breach. Protocol 1985-Adahn, when enacted, temporarily shuts down all mental activity in SCP-1985.

There are three major downsides to Protocol 1985-Adahn:

* SCP-1985's mental activity cannot be restored for a period of 1 (one) month. This appears to be another "default" setting, which the Foundation does not currently have means to alter. (Research is still in progress.)
* Information recovered from SCP-1985-A indicates that if SCP-1985 dies while SCP-1985 is shut down, death will not trigger an excursion and will be permanent. This method was previously used by SCP-1985's creators to kill malfunctioning products of the Rhodes Protocol.
* During previous uses of Protocol 1985-Adahn, SCP-1985 nearly incurred permanent brain death on multiple occasions while deactivated.

**Recovered Information:** Information recovered so far from SCP-1985-A confirms that SCP-1985 was implanted with SCP-1985-A by the Foundation. SCP-1985's 'priming' process, as well as the procedures involved in Protocol 1985-Adahn, have been based on recovered information.

All anomalous features of SCP-1985 appear to have been designed and added by the Foundation, under a program referred to as Project Rhodes. No references to Project Rhodes exist in current Foundation archives besides a single [REDACTED] Per recovered information, SCP-1985 is one of thirty-seven other "successful" products of Project Rhodes (which also produced five hundred and ninety-three "unsuccessful" products), and is referred to as "K-Class Scenario Research Device R-21". 

All anomalous traits of SCP-1985 appear to have been derived from anomalous objects contained by the Foundation, notably SCP-███, SCP-███, [[[SCP-201]]], SCP-████, SCP-████, [REDACTED] and [[[SCP-507]]] (referred to in recovered information as SCP-3914), as well as [REDACTED] and Project ███████. [DATA EXPUNGED] no other "successful" products of Project Rhodes have yet been discovered.

Due to idiosyncrasies in the design of the internal mechanisms of SCP-1985-A, many gaps currently exist in recovered information. Areas in which information is stored appear to regularly shift, possibly as a data protection device. Further information recovery is ongoing.

SCP-1985's access to Class 1 privileges has been partially prompted by information recovered from SCP-1985-A. As SCP-1985-A could not be induced to automatically return SCP-1985 to its containment chambers, [DATA EXPUNGED] as well as Protocol 1985-Adahn.

**Excursions:** Individuals with appropriate clearance level may access further details of SCP-1985's excursions in [[[Disseminated Documentation 1985-Alpha]]]. Full information is restricted to members of Special Access Program "Cantilevered Muskrat".

**Update:** Refer to Excursion XJU-034-IQ1 for further information on SCP-1985's nature.

**Addendum:** On ██/██/████, SCP-1985 submitted a single request for administration of Class-N targeted amnestics. Request was denied.
