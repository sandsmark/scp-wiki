title:SCP-5064
*Item:** SCP-5064

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-5064 are to be contained in the Anomalous Explosives Storage Unit located at Site-77. Instances of SCP-5064 are to be inspected monthly for potential damage, during which time they will be interviewed and are required to perform one short dance with the staff member performing the inspection. 

As instances of SCP-5064 are incapable of movement, the object will be secured to a researcher  using a custom harness for the duration of the dance. The dance will be performed in a cushioned room adjacent to the Anomalous Explosives Storage Unit. Dances performed with SCP-5064 should be selected from the approved dance list to decrease the likelihood of an unintentional trip or fall during the dance. All staff members working with SCP-5064 should have a background in dance to assure a level of poise and balance necessary to maintain safe containment.

During routine storage, a speaker connected to an audio streaming device should be placed near by SCP-5064. A playlist will be selected every morning by a Senior Researcher familiar with SCP-5064. The genre of the playlist should be changed daily to prevent further deterioration to the structure of any SCP-5064 objects. 

**Description:** SCP-5064 refers to 24 sticks of dynamite (designated SCP-5064-1 through SCP-5064-24) produced by the now defunct Collins Demolitions Inc. in Cincinnati, Ohio. Instances of SCP-5064 are sentient, capable of vocalizing, and exhibit basic human sensory capabilities. Instances of SCP-5064 are entirely incapable of movement on their own and must be assisted in all movement required in their Special Containment Procedures. 

Instances of SCP-5064 are highly social and outgoing. The objects often start conversations with Foundation staff members unprompted. All known instances of SCP-5064 share a love of music and a self described "obsession" with dancing. Individual instances of SCP-5064 have different preferences when it comes to the type of music and dance they claim to enjoy the most, although instances of SCP-5064 will accept an offer to dance presented to them regardless of their professed tastes in dance. 

Instances of SCP-5064 will begin to degrade over time if a dance with them is not performed at least every 90 days. Constant exposure to music associated with dancing also appears to significantly slow the deterioration of the objects.  According to documents recovered during the original containment of SCP-5064, an instance of SCP-5064 will explode violently if allowed to degrade over a period of six months.  

**Discovery:**

SCP-5064 was originally discovered in an abandoned factory previously owned by Collins Demolitions Inc., a report of strange voices singing from inside the factory prompted an investigation by the Foundation which recovered the 24 samples currently in containment. Before the Foundation could return to search for more samples of SCP-5064 the factory was destroyed in an explosion caused by an unknown source. The Foundation will continue to monitor buildings owned by former Collins Demolitions subcontractors for reports of unusual singing. 

**Addendum:**

Below are a sample of three interviews with different instances of SCP-5064, with details about the dance that was performed attached.

> **Brewster:** SCP-5064-8, are you well?
> 
> **SCP-5064-8:** I suppose, but I'd rather be dancin'.
> 
> **Brewster:** You don't feel any worse than when we last spoke, do you?
> 
> **SCP-5064-8:** Nah girl, this old stick of dynamite knows how to keep himself together. Listening to funky grooves and doin' that Soul Train stroll. Talking to fine ladies such as yourself. I got an easy life. Ain't nothing to be stressin' out about. 
> 
> **Brewster:** Stressing out?
> 
> **SCP-5064-8:** Yeah baby, stressin' out. That's how we... how'd you call it? Degrade. Yeah, all that damage you see, that's when we're stressed. When I was stuck in that factory with no music, no partner to dance with... Man that was just bad. Not bad like cool either... bad like a total bummer. 
> 
>  **Brewster:** You prefer it here in containment?
> 
> **SCP-5064-8:** Hell yeah! I get a dancing partner once per month! Plus they play some chill tunes in our crib. Any place that plays Kool and the Gang is alright by me, you dig it? 
> 
>  **Brewster:**  I understand that, it's definitely better than the circumstances you were in previously. 
> 
> **SCP-5064-8:** You and your crew talk all funky... And I'm not talking funky like a Funkadelic bass line, I mean like... I don't get how all act so stiff. All that goon speak, I mean it get this gig probably pays real well and all but... don't you ever just want to cut loose? Have some fun? 
> 
>  **Brewster:** I have fun. I dance with you, don't I?
> 
> **SCP-5064-8:** Here I was thinking you'd never ask. You dance much better than that jive turkey, Dr. Mander-Bassen. 
> 
> **Brewster:** Dr. Mander-Bassen is the one who selects all the music you get to listen to. He's a big fan of Kool and the Gang too.
> 
> **SCP-5064-8:** See what I mean? Y'all take this job so seriously. I didn't even know that the doctor knew how to chill. The Man really has got y'all down. Now come on funky Brewster, let's boogie on down to the dance floor.

> **Subject:** SCP-5064-4
> 
> **Begin Log**
> **Brewster:** Hello SCP-5064-4
> 
> **SCP-5064-4:** Ohayo Brewster-san. 
> 
>  **Brewster:** I think your Japanese needs some brushing up, it's 2:14 P.M. Ohayo means good morning. 
> 
> **SCP-5064-4:** It's probably morning in Akihabara. I think, I've never been there.
> 
> **Brewster:** Are you feeling all put together? None of the symptoms of degrading that we talked about?
>  
> **SCP-5064-4:** I feel excellent. The playlist from yesterday had a lot of my suggestions in it. World is Mine, Plastic Love, Marisa Stole the Precious Thing, Gee. Nothing but the classics.
> 
>  **Brewster:** I'm glad the music is helping you stay healthy. 
> 
> **SCP-5064-4:** Oh, if you could talk to your senpai... I have a few more suggestions.
> 
>  **Brewster:** Dr. Mander-Bassen doesn't like it when you refer to him as... what are your suggestions?
> 
> **SCP-5064-4:** Snow Halation from Love Live! and Kyun! Vampire Girl from The Idolmaster 2. I've been trying to put a idol group together with the other guys, but most of them aren't interested.
> 
> **Brewster:** What did they say?
> 
>  **SCP-5064-4:** Number 17 called me a weeaboo and then most of them laughed. 
> 
> **Brewster:**  I can tell them not to treat you that way, you shouldn't have to feel any unnecessary stress. 
> 
>  **SCP-5064-4:** It's okay, Number 19 said he'd join my group. He's not as big into otaku culture but he loves pop music and we bond over that. He's my nakama. 
> 
> **Brewster:** SCP-5064-19 is very nice, I'm glad you two get along. Would you like to begin our dance?
> 
> **SCP-5064-4:** Onegaishimasu. Yes, please.

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-5064-12 Interview"  hide="- Access Granted"]]
> __**Routine Monthly Interview - SCP-5064-12**__
> 
> **Interviewer:** Researcher Lindsey Brewster
> **Subject:** SCP-5064-12
> 
> **Begin Log**
> **Brewster:** SCP-5064-12, I've heard from the others that you're a little upset. Do you want to talk about that?
> 
>  **SCP-5064-12:** Yeah, if you don't mind... I don't want to upset anyone else but I got some rage I've been storing up and I wanna let it out. 
> 
> **Brewster:** Please go ahead, I don't want you feeling tense. 
> 
> **SCP-5064-12:** Pardon my language, but the dances we're permitted to do are fucking weak. Not even like poser shit weak, I could forgive some crabwalking but I've been doing mostly tangos and square dances. You guys have no problem blasting some heavy fucking shit for me once in a while but I never get a chance to do the kind of dancing I dream of. I mean, I'm not going to say no... it's still dancing and I love to dance, I just wish we could get some of that brutality I love mixed in there. 
> 
> **Brewster:**  We're always willing to adjust the dances we perform to your preference, so long as it falls within the perimeters of safety requirements. 
> 
> **SCP-5064-12:**  I've suggested it before and I heard nothing back. 
> 
> **Brewster:** What was your suggestion?
> 
> **SCP-5064-12:** A mosh pit. Get all the staff you've got in here, start a circle of death and start slamming into each other. Live it up! All these metal songs I've been listening to all these years in that cell... fucking excellent breakdowns, but nobody wants to actually rock the fuck out to them. I know some of you guys like the music. Hell I heard you singing along to a Jinjer song when you took me out for my inspection. 
> 
>  **Brewster:** You're right, I am sympathetic. I actually just saw Jinjer last month. Still, I don't know if people would be comfortable with you in a mosh pit.
> 
> **SCP-5064-12:** I disagree, you've been to a metal show... you know how it is. The mosh pit is one of the most accepting places in the world. Men and women, every color and size and shape, it doesn't matter... as long you you want to fucking mosh. I don't think there would be any discrimination. Metal is about loving your fellow metal head... in the most brutal way possible of course. We're a dying breed after all. 
> 
>  **Brewster:** Oh, I didn't mean because of any sort of discrimination. I just think that people normally freak out when there's a live explosive in the middle of large crowd.
> 
> **SCP-5064-12:** Ah shit, see I didn't even think of that. Yeah that kinda fucking sucks. Oh well, I guess we can just do another tango or something for now... but you should blast some Protest the Hero for us to dance to. 
> 
> **End Log**
> 
> Researcher Brewster performed a traditional two step tango dance to the song "Turn Soonest to the Sea" by Protest the Hero with SCP-5064-12 before returning the object to containment.
