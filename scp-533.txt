**Item #:** SCP-533 
**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** 
SCP-533 is to be kept around the neck of a display dummy in room 12B at the ███ ███████, ██ storage facility.  The dummy itself should be kept at least 1m from the other (Safe) contents of room 12B, but no other special containment procedures are warranted at this time.

**Description:** 

SCP-533 is a necklace, usually approximately 54 centimeters in length and 3cm in width.  While the necklace has been under foundation observation, the length has varied between 51cm and ███cm (during the [DATA EXPUNGED].)  The mass of the necklace varies between 804g and ██kg, but is typically close to 1.9kg.

All metal parts have a dull gold finish and appear to be made of cheap metal.  Permission for further testing of the metal fittings' resistance to physical damage is pending approval, but existing test data shows that the fittings are more resilient than they appear.  The clasp is of a standard barrel type.  Attached to each side of the clasp is a round metal fitting.

Most of the mass of the necklace is the body of a snake.  The snake body is in constant motion, "emitting" from one of the round fittings and "sinking" into the other at approximately 1.2 cm/s.  The rate of emission does not seem to vary as much as the length and mass.  The rate of absorption alters to accommodate changes in length.  Since the Foundation acquired the necklace in 198█, an estimated 12,000km of snake body has appeared from one end of the necklace and disappeared into the other. 

The snake body can be easily damaged by conventional means, but any flesh or fluids removed from the body will be drawn towards the "sink" fitting and eventually reabsorbed.  This physical attraction is similar to magnetism except it does not increase in inverse proportion to distance from the fitting.  Samples permanently lose their attraction if they are moved more than ███cm from the necklace, and will not be reabsorbed even if brought into direct contact with the "sink". 

Coloration, markings and texture of the snakeskin change over time.  Herpetological analysis of the marking suggest that if the necklace were the body of a snake, the type of snake indicated does not remain the same.  Various types of snake have been observed, but most often SCP-533 appears to have the body of some type of constrictor.  DNA testing of blood samples seems to support this hypothesis.

Testing with D-class personnel indicates no adverse effects from wearing the necklace, although all test subjects expressed strong desire to remove the necklace as soon as possible.  One such test subject had prior experience handling reptiles, but even he was uncomfortable handling SCP-533.  He reported that it "felt wrong," even though chemical analysis of skin samples shows no abnormalities.

**Addenda:**

Addendum 533-001: SCP-533 is not to be removed from containment except for testing.  Specifically, SCP-533 is not to be worn to social events, Foundation-sponsored or otherwise.  -- Dr. ██████
