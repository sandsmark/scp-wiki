+* Welcome to the Greyve Art Page!

So basically, I finally made an art page. As of now, it's mostly logos, but I'm sure I'll start adding some actual art over time. 

As explained on [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/greyve-author-page my author page], you can use any content I post onto this site with absolutely no limitations. That includes all of my art, which consists of literally anything on this page. Matter of fact, you can even use my logo at the top of the page if you have a particular interest in both the SCP Foundation and a certain band.

You don't even have to credit me if you don't want to, but that would be nice of you to do.

++* Logos

A set of logos I've made for the various Foundation departments and divisions. Updates pretty frequently, as I like to use these for department or division report backgrounds (as seen [*http://scp-wiki.net/scp-5880 here]). Feel free to use any of them however you like, and let me know if you need a logo for a department or division that doesn't have one yet!

Memes exist //inside// of us, so the arrow symbolizes entering our own consciousness.||

Two snakes is the Caduceus, which actually has nothing to do with medicine.||
