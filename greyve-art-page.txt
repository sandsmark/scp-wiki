+* Welcome to the Greyve Art Page!

So basically, I finally made an art page. As of now, it's mostly logos, but I'm sure I'll start adding some actual art over time. 

As explained on [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/greyve-author-page my author page], you can use any content I post onto this site with absolutely no limitations. That includes all of my art, which consists of literally anything on this page. Matter of fact, you can even use my logo at the top of the page if you have a particular interest in both the SCP Foundation and a certain progressive rock band.

You don't even have to credit me if you don't want to, but that would be nice of you to do.

++* Logos

A set of logos I've made for the various Foundation departments and divisions. Updates pretty frequently, as I like to use these for department or division report backgrounds (as seen [*http://scp-wiki.net/scp-5880 here]). Feel free to use any of them however you like, and let me know if you need a logo for a department or division that doesn't have one yet!

||  [[image https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vSEMiHQ6WYZDDQSjsg303342rDKyBVXvnsTy8tMu9rgRrQuqtYKGd4zGD6Gdsm0CXK2g_p8bpFi5J-r/pub?w=599&h=600 width="250 px"]] || **Occult Studies Division:** Ouroboros, an ancient symbol associated with magic.||
||  [[image https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vRcV3QE4ACx_5oCYPtdlM-qYwMCtzWBc0i_hMajioE6e66sxyl0rzLF4imG-YK2QdPT69bWY2UgCaId/pub?w=599&h=600 width="250 px"]] || **IT Department:** Modified USB to have three arrows, like the Foundation.||
||  [[image https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vRO-PpC3s7nCBJ6FbvbJJSgNFInVZSR4GjctJGWyyzYp-Hx-OBYdsCKSWDhMaDOtsX93087jwXMi9Nd/pub?w=599&h=600 width="250 px"]] || **Memetics and Infohazards Division:** Negative space. Memes exist //inside// of us, so the arrow symbolizes entering our own consciousness.||
||  [[image https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTKdNHF4047T3200eXUbGsX83rIzt0GEnSaan7Pqg1_Z7vHCNxNEn6okX1oJ83uzemNZXu22W6CIA58/pub?w=599&h=600 width="250 px"]] || **Medical Department:** The Rod of Asclepius, symbolic of the Greek god of healing. Two snakes is the Caduceus, which actually has nothing to do with medicine.||
||  [[image https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vSf-HTSZyhj8I09TjLe7SnrREUU2VgEmfc7XV9NlmP2gaTuEfT_n2JfO0W9vneBNcYFL5EcJkTz6dVN/pub?w=599&h=600 width="250 px"]] || **O5 Command:** A scaled-up version of the Administrative Department logo, with three arrowheads added inside. Also, the negative space resembles a V, the Roman numeral for 5. ||
||  [[image https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTkOupqpVLeYOYtj2uKq9xcE-SGgEBuvxTZMLGArXqYKrlfkkCBO-qMw4BokATjxJEAKJNBdFT9MiLt/pub?w=599&h=600 width="250 px"]] || **Ethics Committee:** A scale, the universal symbol for justice, modified to resemble 3 arrows pointing heavenward, since their duty is above humanity.||

Based on the narrative, as well as the traditional depiction of the Zoroastrian god Zurvan.||
