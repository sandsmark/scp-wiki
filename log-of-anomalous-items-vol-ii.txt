Is nobody going to mention the fact that Modern_Erasmus deleted over 300+ entries to this page over a month ago and nobody has noticed? People are still adding entries without noticing this, so I'd appreciate if someone who knew what they were doing could restore all of the entries he removed, but also kept all the entries added later. I would do it myself, but unfortunately I suck at Wikidot syntax.

**Item Description:** A life-sized doll filled with interstellar particulate matter and trace amounts of metallic hydrogen. The item mimics the appearance of [[[SCP-4519|the late astronomer Carl Edward Sagan]]].
**Date of Recovery:** 1996/12/21
**Location of Recovery:** Fred Hutchinson Research Center, Seattle, Washington
**Recovery Log:** On the morning after Carl Sagan's death, mortuary technicians noticed Sagan's body had gone missing. Law enforcement dispatched on-site reported that a person or group of persons had stolen and replaced the body, discovering the doll alongside a Freedom From Religion brochure. Foundation agents later released a cover story proposing that the incident was a practical joke.

For the ensuing two months, Sagan's cadaver could not be located. To mitigate distress within the Sagan family, Foundation agents planned a necessary cover-up funeral. On February 27, 1997, the Amnestics Department orchestrated a secular public memorial service for Carl Sagan's life. Throughout the service, personnel posing as funerary staff dispersed a specialized gaseous Class-E/W "Solace" a/mnestic cocktail. As a result, persons attending the service had memories and feelings associated with melancholy and grief replaced with a reinforced mass fondness for the late Sagan.
**Current Status:** Item is contained within a shrine to Carl Sagan at Site-64.
