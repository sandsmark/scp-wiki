**Foreword:**  The SCP Foundation has discovered a substantial number of items which are simply too useless to merit further attention. This document lists those items which have prompted some curiosity. It may be used as a resource should knowledge of these items become useful or necessary in the future. 
 – Dr. █████ █████, Head of Research, Site ██

This is the second volume of the log. Access to the first volume of the log can be found [http://www.scp-wiki.net/log-of-anomalous-items here].

**Item Description:** A cassette tape labelled 'Sex Fist; Rise of the Righteous Dead, 1992.' Cassette contains 11 low-quality musical pieces of the Doom Metal genre. No band or record of the name written have been found to exist, and the vocalist has not been identified. Upon listening to the tape, at the 33-second mark, the subjects will begin  'head-banging,' a style of rhythmic dancing involving violently shaking one's head in time to the music. This effect will persist for 38 minutes and 18 seconds, the remaining duration of the cassette, even if the music is stopped or removed from earshot.
**Date of Recovery:** 6/18/2018
**Location of Recovery:** Public library; a teenage male had received a concussion by 'head-banging' too closely to a wall when effected by the anomaly. Said individual recalled buying the cassette at a local record store. Investigation revealed no further irregularities.
**Current Status:** In storage. 

**Item Description:** A twelve-centimeter brass statue of a turtle. When touched, the object will inflict a number of consistent hallucinations, of several hundred baby turtles, several dozen seagulls and snakes which are attempting to eat said baby turtles, and a waterline. If an individual attempts to shelter the turtles from the predators and help them into the hallucinatory water, a task which inevitably results in several (hallucinatory) injuries from being pecked and bitten, then when the hallucinations cease, several gallons of sea-water will ectoentropically manifest and drench them. If, instead, the subject attempts to hinder, injure, or collect the turtles, the hallucinations will immediately cease, and a bowl of fresh, hot turtle soup will manifest.
**Date of Recovery:** 3/6/2018
**Location of Recovery:** A seagull nest on [REDACTED] Beach, Mexico
**Current Status:** Site-71 Break Room. Can be used to generate lunch.

**Item Description:** A snow-globe that, when shook, causes extreme vestibular dysfunction and vertigo. This effect seems to be a unique vestibular cognitohazard; subjects have likened it to 'being bounced around like a pin-ball' and 'being on a trampoline in an earthquake.'
**Date of Recovery:** 9/21/2017 
**Location of Recovery:** Abdominal cavity of an individual who was receiving surgery to remove necrotic bowel after a blockage. Patient was interviewed, no irregularities found.
**Current Status:** In storage. Occasionally used as a prop in Alternate Cognitohazard Lecture 108, or for Extreme Environment Training for Mobile Task Force personnel.

**Item Description:** A spherical, pink-painted ceramic pig, seven centimeters in diameter, which carries a mild memetic effect. Upon making visual contact with the object, a subject will begin speaking in 'pig Latin.' The duration of this effect is dependent on the individuals natural resistance to memetic effects, with the average being two days. Extensive verbal contact with the subject in this time, or consciously deciding to communicate with the subject in pig Latin in conversation for any reason, can cause the meme to spread; however, secondary infections are much weaker, and rarely last more than two hours. Both primary and secondary infections can be cured with a dose of Class-A Amnestics.
**Date of Recovery:** 4/17/2018
**Location of Recovery**: Pottery class in the small town of Madoc, Ontario, Canada. The entire class was infected with the meme; amnestics were distributed. The creator of the pig, a 55-year old recently-divorced woman, was interviewed and her background checked; no irregularities were found.

**Item Description:** Several pages of documentation regarding a temporal anomaly. Said document is mundane and Foundation-standard, except for as follows: all writing is mirrored; the object class of the anomaly is 'Innocuous,' which is not a presently-used classification, and seems to take the place of the Anomalous Object designation; the date on the documentation is 5/13/2022, which is presently still in the future; and the object emits high levels of tachyon radiation. The anomaly described by the documentation is the documentation itself; apparently, at some point in the near-future, said document will be recovered by the Foundation, and therefor be retroactively contained, as the object is moving through time in the opposite direction with regards to the rest of the universe. Proposals to modify the documentation to indicate a need to our predecessors to destroy it before it ages earlier than the point where the Foundation exists and therefor becomes uncontained have been denied on the basis that this may cause a temporal paradox, given that no record of the object's destruction or any alterations to the documentation exist; a proposal to create a new object class, Innocuous, in order to prevent a temporal paradox, is pending. The recovery section of the documentation is missing; research into how said document could have been created or recovered is ongoing.
