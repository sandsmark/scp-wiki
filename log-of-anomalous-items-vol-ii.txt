**Item Description:** A rogue US Military reconnaissance satellite with the designation RD-███ █. On the 30/██/200█ at 20:21 UTC the AFSC (Air Force Space Command) lost contact with RD-███ █, though its position was still being monitored by ground satellites. AFSC scientists attempted to re-establish radio contact and regain control of the satellite, but failed. 3 hours later at 23:25 UTC the satellite began sending coded signals back to ground control.

I just don't know what is happening. The place is Earth as a pillow itself, and the mechs are probably their "futuristic" style. I don't know what is happening. I'll get more information as soon as I can.

**Item Description:** A life-sized doll filled with interstellar particulate matter and trace amounts of metallic hydrogen. The item mimics the appearance of [[[SCP-4519|the late astronomer Carl Edward Sagan]]].
**Date of Recovery:** 1996/12/21
**Location of Recovery:** Fred Hutchinson Research Center, Seattle, Washington
**Recovery Log:** On the morning after Carl Sagan's death, mortuary technicians noticed Sagan's body had gone missing. Law enforcement dispatched on-site reported that a person or group of persons had stolen and replaced the body, discovering the doll alongside a Freedom From Religion brochure. Foundation agents later released a cover story proposing that the incident was a practical joke.

For the ensuing two months, Sagan's cadaver could not be located. To mitigate distress within the Sagan family, Foundation agents planned a necessary cover-up funeral. On February 27, 1997, the Amnestics Department orchestrated a secular public memorial service for Carl Sagan's life. Throughout the service, personnel posing as funerary staff dispersed a specialized gaseous Class-E/W "Solace" a/mnestic cocktail. As a result, persons attending the service had memories and feelings associated with melancholy and grief replaced with a reinforced mass fondness for the late Sagan.
**Current Status:** Item is contained within a shrine to Carl Sagan at Site-64.

These ".gifs" have been determined by testing to be at least 98.2% accurate according to those who use it, with the 1.8% inaccuracy later determined to be due to them misremembering something. The photo will display this ".gif" for 1 minute before stopping on the first "frame" of the video until someone else holds it, resetting it once more. --The possibility of using this item to more accurately show unrecorded events in after-action reports by personnel is being discussed at this time.--
**Date of Recovery:** █/██/201█
**Location of Recovery:** ███████ Bar and Grill, ███████ Maine. Owner and patrons were given Amnestics and convinced that the item was not a photo in a wood frame but in fact a novelty video display that was stolen by a thief and never recovered.
**Current Status:** Neutralized after an unknown assailant apparently managed to successfully steal it, went into the Site-██ cafeteria, and, after getting some level 1 staff to use it, successfully had the photo display a short cat video that ran at an estimated 150 fps and had one frame of the video replaced with a picture of SCP 096's face. After this [DATA EXPUNGED]. Aftermath: Over ██ confirmed casualties, containment breach for SCP's ████, ████, and ███ confirmed, and several highly classified files were found to be subsequently missing, presumed stolen. It is unknown how the assailant managed to watch said video without triggering SCP 096's anomalous effect until that point, and we won't find out since he's dead. The photo was later recovered by MTF Unit-███, who destroyed it to prevent other such attacks.
**Note:** Just goes to show that no matter how harmless they may seem, any anomaly can cause disaster if left uncontained. //This// is why we exist, people. -Site Director █████████
Whoever let that man into Site-██, gain access to the photo and then allowed a bunch of Scientists //play around with an anomaly// in full view of several guards, let me just say that if you're still alive, you will be held responsible for this whole attack, and you will regret ever letting an event of such magnitude happen under your watch. That is all. - Dr. ████
