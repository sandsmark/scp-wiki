title:Guide to Newbies
[[toc]]

+ Welcome!

Ah, so you found us. Great! If you're a casual browser and don't plan on joining the site as a member, that's cool; we have hundreds of SCP articles, incident reports, foundation tales, and unrelated creepypasta pages for you to read, so why are you wasting your time reading this? But, if you're looking to become involved in the wiki community, whether it's becasue you want to get a closer look at the process, read the discussion pages, or because you want to write your own SCP article, there's a few things you ought to know first. [[[system:join | Of course, first you need to join the site]]] if you have not already done so!

++ Joining the Site
So, apparently there has been some issues regarding the application process. The only place you need to go to join is [[[system:join |here]]]. Follow all the steps. Seems rather simple, yes?  Well, let's reinforce a couple of points:
* DO NOT ANSWER IN CHARACTER. Your application will be deleted.
* All Questions Must Be Answered: This should be an obvious one, but seriously, answer all the questions. They do serve a purpose.
* Consider This A Job Interview: You are trying to impress us. (I use the term us, but really, it's just me.) You want to join our site. This application is a forum through which you can sell us why we need you around. That said, when answering the question, punctuation, capitalization, and the ability to completely explain the idea, are recommended.
* The Questions Are Serious: Okay, granted, some of them aren't, (and it'll be obvious which ones aren't) BUT the point is, we want a real answer to any questions asked. So, if, for instance, the question is "What is the purpose of [DATA EXPUNGED], a good answer would not be "Why, because of [REDACTED]" We really want to know your answer to these questions, not something cute and snarky/quippy.
* What To Do If I'm Denied: Look at the reason why you were denied. It'll tell you whether you can apply again.
* Whether you are approved, or declined, you WILL be notified. If you have not been notified either way, something went wrong in your application process, and you should contact Dr. Bright to find out what it is. 

++  Some "Rules"
We really have surprisingly few hard-and-fast rules that you NEED to adhere to, but the following are certainly amongst them. Please keep the following in mind unless you want to be scolded, yelled at, or possibly banned.

* **Be aware of editing "levels"** This is very, very important! Minor edits to articles, such as basic spelling or grammar fixes, can be carried out in most cases with little/no involvement from the article's author. Major edits, such as alterations of whole sentences/paragraphs, or changing pictures should ALWAYS be run by the entry owner first. If you are unable to contact the owner, get hold of one of the mods or admins, and ask them, that is why they are there. If you want to edit an entry for structure rather than content, at least ask a mod/admin in chat first to see if it's they think it's needed. I know it can seem a tad anal-retentive of us, but this way we can keep the nasty surprise of logging in to find your entry "wrecked" to a bare minimum.

* **Ideas for site tools should be run by an admin or a mod before being implemented.** Preferably they should only be implemented BY an admin or mod. This is to stop the site from being broken and going all wahoonie shaped. We're still trying to hunt down a few "fixes" implemented by users, so this is important!

* **Don't make a member page until you've got at least three well-received SCP articles.** And when you do, remember that [[[dr-gerald-s-personnel-file|self-deprecating humor]]] is better received than Mary Sue power fantasies.

* **Make sure any content you add is appropriate** Whilst the site as a whole would certainly have to go "unrated", and I'm certainly not going to ask you to keep things "PG" or any such nonsense, please keep things tasteful. If your article mentions sex or violence, don't make it explicit. If in doubt, run it by a staff member, but an easy way to police yourself is to ask yourself: "Does the purpose of this article SEEM to revolve around indulging in sexual or violent fantasies?" ... if the answer is "yes", then try again, bucko. And pictures should always be kept SFW.  Of course, I mean all of this regarding main-site articles, as we do [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/disclaimer-page| have a place for this sort of thing]]].

* **Don't talk "In-Character"**: Do not, DO NOT talk "In-Character" on the forums or the chat. This is a quick way to accumulate hatred and angry glares.

* **Final Rule: Don't be a Dick.** Wil Wheaton said it, so it must be true.

++ Joining and Staying in the Community

* **Join the chat** [[[realtime-chat| Seriously, it's easy!]]].  Joining the chat is the #1 way to get involved in the community. A lot of SCP-related conversation takes place there, as well as the majority of the socializing and the discussion. If you have an idea you want to run by an established user, you can do it there. If you need some help setting up a page, do it there. Hell, just go there and say hi first, and people will tend to like you better if and when you write your first article.
 * And read the [[[Chat Guide]]] as well. Wouldn't wanna get banned now, would we?
 * Checking the topic of the chat is good business. If you're using the Mibbit option, and you can't find the topic at first glance, type "/topic".
 
* **Leave Constructive Comments:** We encourage users to vote on articles as they like, and leave comments on discussion pages. And leaving comments on articles is a great way to start discussion with other users, and make your name familiar around the site. But please, if you're going to leave a comment, try to say something beyond "liked it, upvoted" or just "downvoted". Ask questions! Whether questions for clarification, or theoritical questions such "What would happen to this SCP if we did ..." ect.  Asking questions helps the authors expand the article from angles they might not have previously considered. If you're not going to ask questions, at least leave full comments saying what about an article you like. If you're leaving a negative comment, it's doubly important to state what you didn't like.

* **Don't rush to contribute.**  This is a big one.  Just because we are a writing community does not mean you //must// write. We welcome fans, editors, and insightful commentators as well.  Also, the SCP entry format is not always everyone's cup of tea.  The detached tone and format can be very hard to do correctly.  Luckily, we have a large Library, Creepy Pasta section, and other areas where more emotional and story-length ideas can be played out.  Don't feel as if you MUST make all your ideas in to SCP entries.  The Foundation universe is large, and lots of things may happen in it that never get recorded in full scale SCP entries.

* **Read the Articles!:** It's surprising how many people we get that read an SCP or two, and then try to have OPINIONS on new SCPs, or even worse write their own SCP. Before you go doing either of those things, take the time to REALLY read about the site. Get a feel for the site and the setting. Read about object classes. Read about security levels.

* **Do not sass the mods.** Or the admins, for that matter. Anyone whose name is under Administration or Moderation [[[members-pages|on this here list]]] is generally an established user with experience writing good articles. If a mod is being deliberately rude or mean, call them on it, by all means, but too often we've got people coming in and mouthing off to established users who are only trying to help, and wind up with kickbans.

+ Writing SCPs
So you want to write an SCP, eh? Okay! Well, first...

* __**Read The Manual**__: Or, in our case, [[[how-to-write-an-scp|the How to Write an SCP Page]]]. The WHOLE thing. And do what it says. This also includes reading [[[the-big-list-of-overdone-scp-cliches|this list of SCP ideas that have been done to death and back.]]] One other place you might want to go is the [[[decommissioned-scp|Decommissioned SCPs List.]]] This is a list of SCP articles that were violently rejected by the established user base for various reasons: read them and learn, my young apprentice, about the kinds of articles that are not welcome here.

 * **There are literally hundreds of articles on this wiki.** It is a sure bet that any new ideas you have have either been done before, or something close to it. Use the search function to check and see if we already have your idea here. It's not a bad thing to use an idea that has already been done, you just need to give it a unique spin.

* **Announce your SCP in the Announcement thread** or I will destroy all that you love and hold dear, even if you leave the wiki.  This is a pet peeve of mine, and immediately puts me on a bad footing with a new entry.  If i have to hunt through the recent edits to dig out a new SCP, it makes me think you have something to hide, and makes me comb over it with a more harsh eye.  If you announce it, it shows a level of confidence and willingness to accept comments.  If you make people dig, they are more likely to bury you.

* **YOUR FIRST SCP HAS A BETTER THAN LIKELY CHANCE OF BEING DELETED.** We don't pull our punches around here, we don't sugar coat things. If you have a thin skin, or get upset when people tell you how stupid an idea is, this is not the site for you. That said, we really admire people that can either fix their ideas, or know how to drop a dumb idea and keep working on new material. People that butt-hurt and sulk? We don't like them as much.

 **Don't post works in progress on the forums.** This especially includes not creating sandbox pages. Yes, I know we have a few of these on the site, but they're inactive and no more are being made. They clog up the forums, including the New Posts page, which some of us use to navigate the site quickly. You have two alternatives to on-site sandboxes.
You can use pastebin! It's quick, easy, and painless. Here's a quick how-to.
 * Go to http://scp-eval.pastebin.com/
 * Type in your name or other identifier in the name prompt at the bottom
 * Type away.
 * Hit "send" once you've finished the draft.
 * Copy the link from your address bar.
 * And you're done. Share the link in chat.

Your second option if you want a dedicated sandbox, or if you want to be able to look at your draft using the wikidot format, is to go make a page[http://scpsandboxwiki.wikidot.com/ here]. Just create a page for yourself, and share the link.

* **Writing Joke SCPs** A good joke SCP should be first and foremost, //funny//. Not a reference or a homage to anything, though references can be funny if done right, with a flair of originality. Other wise, aim for //funny//, not a reference.

+ The Senior Staff and You
++ A Guide on How to Deal 

All right, so, I've noticed, a lot of newbies don't really get the Senior Staff. We're the ones who either help run the site, or have been around long enough that we're worth listening to. However, we're also some rather hard people to get along with if you don't know us. So, to help the Newbs, I'm presenting a guide on who we are, and how to handle us. You're welcome.

PS: Yes, there is humor here. However, these are also pretty damn accurate descriptions of us all, so don't be surprised. We warned you.

**Admins:**  Our Admins! Descriptions in Haiku Form!

* **The Administrator:**  Absent creator / Some months in between visits / You will not see him
* **Clef:**  resident bad-ass / always very genre savvy / and enigmatic
* **Gears:** prolific author / resident steampunk expert / a very nice guy
* **Kain Pathos Crow:** mad scientist dog / I am 12 and what is this / rides a giant robot
* **Bright:** perverted old man / handles the applications / blunt and to the point
* **Snorlison:** arctic ghost chaser / bad-ass mustache of the gods / and it keeps him warm

* **Waxx:** Our Soviet-ophile / DMs for Active Duty / he hates Chechnya.
 * **Fritzwillie:** MIA

**Mods:**  Our Mods!

* **Fat Ghost:** Our laid back friend from the wilds of Canadia. Tends to use the term 'son' a lot, so don't get offended. Our resident Metric God. Use Metric, or he shall smite thee mightily with the Hiker. Very mellow, eh? Also one of our chat admins.
* **Rights:** Our first female Researcher who dared to admit it. Very motherly, and always willing to lend a hand. Rights has a good head on her shoulders for creepy. She just had a baby. Congratulations!
* **Ekzentric Lohner:** One of the new mods, not much is known about her. She IS really good at both constructive criticism and the creation of tools to actually be used on the wiki. 
* **Gerald:** New guy. Smart. Kind of a punk. But we like him.
* **Sophia Light:** Well educated and constructive in her criticisms. Hangs around a lot in chat and Active Duty. Our resident biologist!
* **Mr. Unimport:** Has been compared to a younger, more argumentative snorlison. This is a compliment, of course.
* **Iceberg:** MIA
* **Kraito:** MIA
* **Masipag:** MIA
 
**Senior Staff:** Senior Staff! 
* **Agent Kramer:**  Kramer knows a good SCP when she sees one. And that's that.
* **PoorYoric:** A pure asshole. Voted --second-- most likely to downvote your article.
* **Kulzn:** Another of our resident assholes, but he does know what he's doing. Give him a listen, eh?  He's also a Brit!  That's kinda cool, right? **Currently MIA**
* **Bouncl:** That's Imants in chat. He's a nice guy with a good head on his shoulders. Talk to him if unimport and yoric scare you. Also a chat mod!
* **Fifthman:** An alright fellow! He maintains Alanna, and uses the "^_^" smiley a lot. 
* **Dr. Mann:** A pretty cool guy, and a great writer. We're expecting great things to come from this kid. 
* **Quikngruvn:** Though rarely quick or groovin', he has shown himself to have a good eye for SCP articles, and has certainly proved himself a useful addition to the staff.
* **Photosynthetic:** A new add to the senior staff! She's a great girl, and one of our resident scientists! Can you guess what her specialty is?

**Chat Mods:** That's right, we have a chat! And, with a constant influx of new meat, we've had to post up Chat mods, to keep things flowing smoothly.

* **Break:** She's a bit rare these days, but she's a nice gal. Has the tendency to pounce on certain people and drag them to her desk. Are you getting the visual imagery of a leopard and its prey? You should be.
* **Clockwork Mage**: New guy on the shift, a nice enough fellow. None too shabby at the writing end.
* **Heiden:** One of the nice guys. Wow, we're really moving away from the random asshole mods, aren't we?
