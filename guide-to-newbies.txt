++ Or, how to make sure that your stay in the SCP Foundation is a fun and prosperous one

So there's been an influx of new users lately, and that's cool. New blood is always good, and so are new bodies, new organs, new bones, and new skin. The only problem is, sometimes all that new flesh doesn't really include the proper kind of new mind, which is the most important thing.

It's not that newbs are automatically stupid, really. It's just that over time, this site has built up a culture of its own, and newbs stand out because they don't understand that culture yet. Too many times, we get a bright-eyed, bushy tailed youngster run in, start excitedly doing cool things, and then get shouted down by the higher ups for being "dumb." I'm guilty of that myself. But it still makes me a bit sad to see those youthful dreams crushed under my boots. . . no it doesn't, what's the word that's the opposite of sad again? Happy. That's it. 

Still, that sort of thing's not good for the community, and it's certainly not good for me, since a steady diet of crushing the dreams of new users is high in salt and causes high blood pressure, stress, and depression. So in the interests of keeping things real, and making sure that everyone is happier in the long run, I'm presenting a few quick rules for newbs to follow if you want to prosper and be happy on this site.

* **Join the chat** [[[realtime-chat|or Kondraki will eat your goddamn eyes.]]] Most of the real conversations take place there, as well as the majority of the socializing and the discussion. If you have an idea you want to run by an established user, you can do it there. If you need some help setting up a page, do it there. Hell, just go there and say hi first, and people will tend to like you better if and when you write your first article.
* **Read the fucking manual.** Or, in our case, [[[how-to-write-an-scp|the How to Write an SCP Page]]]. The WHOLE thing. And do what it says. This also includes reading [[[the-big-list-of-overdone-scp-cliches|this list of SCP ideas that have been done to death and back.]]] One other place you might want to go is the [[[decommissioned-scp|Decommissioned SCPs List.]]] This is a list of SCP articles that were violently rejected by the established user base for various reasons: read them and learn, my young apprentice, about the kinds of articles that are not welcome here.
* **Do not sass the mods.** Or the admins, for that matter. Anyone whose name is under Administration or Moderation [[[members-pages|on this here list]]] is generally an established user with experience writing good articles. If a mod is being deliberately rude or mean, call them on it, by all means, but too often we've got people coming in and mouthing off to established users who are only trying to help, and wind up with kickbans.
* **Don't post works in progress on the forums.** It clogs up the forums, including the New Posts page, which some of us use to navigate the site quickly. Here is a quick guide to making a sandbox page.
    * Look to the left side of the page. Find the little box labeled "Add a New Page."
    * Type in a name for a sandbox page, something like, "Clef's Sandbox."
    * Press the New Page button.
    * Copypasta your work in progress into the text box and click save.
    * Go to your sandbox's discussion page and say, "Here is my work in progress, please critique."
    * When you're done using it, clear the contents until the next time you need to use the sandbox.
    * //Or go to the new [[[Practice Area]]], I just set up for such a thing. Same rules apply// - Prof. K. P. Crow
* **There are literally hundreds of articles on this wiki.** It is a sure bet that any new ideas you have have either been done before, or something close to it. Use the search function to check and see if we already have your idea here. It's not a bad thing to use an idea that has already been done, you just need to give it a unique spin.
* **Ideas for site tools should be run by an admin or a mod before being implemented.** Preferably they should only be implemented BY an admin or mod. This is to stop the site from being broken and going all wahoonie shaped.
* **Don't make a member page until you've got at least three well-received SCP articles.** And when you do, remember that [[[dr-gerald-s-personnel-file|self-deprecating humor]]] is better received than Mary Sue power fantasies.
* **Final Rule: Don't be a Dick.** Wil Wheaton said it, so it must be true.
