Drip, drip, drip. Blood falls from your shattered nose onto the polished, tiled floor. You feebly try to look up as you hear a rasping cough, but Valley's thugs did their job too well. A ticking noise comes from the man restraining you. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. Valley coughs again, and you see the old, wizened figure nod to the ticking man. His voice is like his cough, hoarse and sudden, as if every sentence that came out of Valley's mouth could be the last. With his current state, that was probably true.

"Show our guest to his seat, Mr. Tick."

You are surprised with Mr. Tick's strength as he slams you into the wooden chair. You had scoffed when Mr. Carter told you about Valley's manservant. The man was diseased, for gods sake, how could he be a threat? As you try to gaze at Valley through the ruined remains of your left eye, you realize how wrong you were.

"Mr. Jacobs." Valleys tone is mocking. Using his stick-like arm, he gently places one of Mr. Carters note on the table. "You are here to cheat me?" Next, he places a tiny camera in front of him. "Or to spy on me?" As he places the last item on the table, you know you are as good as dead.

"To kill me?" Says Valley, inspecting your gun. "A good effort, I'm sure, but Mr. Tick does not miss a tick." Then he laughs. It's the most awful sound you have ever heard in your life. Valley stops and grins at you with his yellow teeth. A drop of blood slides down from his cracked lips from the exertion of the act. "Who are you working for?"

You remember what Mr. Carter told you to say. Your voice is a whisper, it's a miracle you can even talk with the beating you took. "Global Occult Coalition…mass liquidation of known threat entity…"

"Liar." Snaps Valley. Mr. Ticks hand closes around yours. You have time to look up for a moment before he squeezes and crushes it. You scream in agony as you hear the loud crunching from what used to be your hand. "Who do you really work for?"

You're sobbing now. The pain is unbearable. "Marshall…Carter and Dark…" You scream. Mr. Tick lets go.

Valley looks worried. "They know of my operation here?"

"Yes." You struggle not to look at the crushed lump at the end of your arm.

"This is…highly unfortunate. We will have to think carefully of our next move, I think. Thank you, Mr. Jacobs. Mr. Tick, you may kill him now."

You open your mouth to protest, but are cut short as Mr. Tick grabs the back of your head and slams it into the table. You are killed instantly, and the table completely collapses from the impact. A cleaner steps forward and begins to wipe your brain matter off the wood as two members of security throw your body off the balcony. You land with a splash.

"Our old associates have discovered us, it seems." Says Valley.

"Yes." Says Mr. Tick.

"Nevertheless, I believe we can continue our operation here. There must be some demand for those things."

"Yes."

"We'll need to raise security, Mr. Tick. I don't want this happening again. I'll run out of tables."

"Yes."
