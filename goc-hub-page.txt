(this hub is a work in progress)

> **RESOLVED:** That, in the early years of the 20th Century, the rising emergence of hostile paranormal, parascientific, and paratemporal entities constitutes a clear and present threat to the survival of humankind.
> 
> **RESOLVED:** That, in the wake of the Second World War and the concurrent Seventh Occult War, that no single nation can be relied upon to effectively respond to para-threats, due to the concerns of nationalism and international conflict.
> 
> **RESOLVED:** That the necessity of responding to said parathreats is of utmost importance and must, by necessity, supercede any concerns of national, regional, or cultural self-interest.
> 
> **THEREFORE:** We, the undersigned leaders of one hundred and eight major paranormal organizations, authorize the formation of an international organization dedicated to keeping the peace and identifying, neutralizing, and containing said parathreats, being the highest authority in such matters, superceding all national, international, and otherwise corporeal interests.
> 
> **BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED:** That this Global Occult Coalition shall be placed under the independent Aegis of the United Nations, and that such an organization shall be provided whatever resources necessary in perpetua, and that said organization shall be given the authority to use any means necessary to maintain the peace (or, should peace be impossible, to ensure the survival of humankind).

+ The Fivefold Mission
++ First Mission: Survival
The Global Occult Coalition shall hold the survival of the human race against all threats paranormal, parascientific, and paratemporal as their highest mission, superceding all others.
++ Second Mission: Concealment
As knowledge of parathreats would result in mass panic and heavy casualties among the human population, the Global Occult Coalition shall conceal the existence of said parathreats from the general public.
++ Third Mission: Protection
Although considered expendable if necessary in pursuit of the First Mission, individual human beings (including operatives of the GOC) shall be protected whenever possible.
++ Fourth Mission: Destruction
As the existence of parathreats is in itself anathema to the survival of the human race, no unnecessary risks are to be taken to ensure the survival of parathreats.
++ Fifth Mission: Education
The Global Occult Coalition shall make every effort to expand the base of knowledge regarding parathreats.
