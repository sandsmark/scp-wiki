[[tab Mission Statement]]
> **RESOLVED:** That, in the early years of the 20th Century, the rising emergence of hostile paranormal, parascientific, and paratemporal entities constitutes a clear and present threat to the survival of humankind.
> 
> **RESOLVED:** That, in the wake of the Second World War and the concurrent Seventh Occult War, that no single nation can be relied upon to effectively respond to para-threats, due to the concerns of nationalism and international conflict.
> 
> **RESOLVED:** That the necessity of responding to said parathreats is of utmost importance and must, by necessity, supercede any concerns of national, regional, or cultural self-interest.
> 
> **THEREFORE:** We, the undersigned leaders of one hundred and eight major paranormal organizations, authorize the formation of an international organization dedicated to keeping the peace and identifying, neutralizing, and containing said parathreats, being the highest authority in such matters, superceding all national, international, and otherwise corporeal interests.
> 
> **BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED:** That this Global Occult Coalition shall be placed under the independent Aegis of the United Nations, and that such an organization shall be provided whatever resources necessary in perpetua, and that said organization shall be given the authority to use any means necessary to maintain the peace (or, should peace be impossible, to ensure the survival of humankind).

> Signed,

[[tab The Fivefold Mission]]
+ The Fivefold Mission
++ First Mission: Survival
The Global Occult Coalition shall hold the survival of the human race against all threats paranormal, parascientific, and paratemporal as their highest mission, superceding all others.
++ Second Mission: Concealment
As knowledge of parathreats would result in mass panic and heavy casualties among the human population, the Global Occult Coalition shall conceal the existence of said parathreats from the general public.
++ Third Mission: Protection
Although considered expendable if necessary in pursuit of the First Mission, individual human beings (including operatives of the GOC) shall be protected whenever possible.
++ Fourth Mission: Destruction
As the existence of parathreats is in itself anathema to the survival of the human race, no unnecessary risks are to be taken to ensure the survival of parathreats.
++ Fifth Mission: Education
The Global Occult Coalition shall make every effort to expand the base of knowledge regarding parathreats.

[[tab About the Canon]]
+ About the GOC
[[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/groups-of-interest#toc7|The Global Occult Coalition]]] was a Group of Interest created by Kain Pathos Crow in the early days of the SCP Foundation wiki. Inspired by a creepypasta about how the Soviet Red Army killed God in the 1950s, it postulated the existence of a separate, but equally powerful, force in the paranormal world. If the SCP Foundation was dedicated to finding, capturing, and containing paranormal objects, the Coalition would be dedicated to a much different, more direct approach: outright destruction of the paranormal.

Since then, the concept has been refined somewhat into the current iteration. The Global Occult Coalition is now intended to be an openly political organization, taking actions that affect the world stage. Seen in that light, their policy of destruction of paranormal objects differs from the SCP Foundation's: if the Foundation are the jailers, then the Coalition are the executioners. But, like any executioner, they cannot act without the permission of a judge and jury. . . the United Nations' secret Council of 108.

Global Occult Coalition stories take their inspiration from any number of fictional works about global conspiracies that secretly control the world (The Laundry Series by Charles Stross, Delta Green and Call of Cthulhu by Chaosium, the Illuminatus Trilogy, Mike Mignola's Hellboy, etc.), with a strong dose of Tom Clancy style modern-day action thriller. There is still a horror element, but the focus is no longer on the things that lurk in the darkness, but on the people who watch over us in the night.

+ Contributor's Guide
* **All pages added to the canon must be named using the following format:**
 * Any supplementary documents must be named: "goc-supplemental-" followed by the individual pagename. (example: goc-supplemental-threat entities)
 * Any personnel files must be named: "goc-personnel-" followed by the individual pagename. (example: goc-personnel-D C al Fine)
 * Any tales must be named: "goc-tale-" followed by the individual pagename (example: goc-tale-rascal one actual.)

* Please read through all supplementary documents before writing for this canon. Feel free to contribute to supplementary documents, but keep in mind that if your addition is unpopular, it may be removed.

* Please read through any personnel files before using those characters in your stories. Feel free to create new characters and teams if you wish.

* Keep in mind that many of the things that make a good SCP article do not apply to making a good GOC article. For instance: "fighting good" is generally looked down on on SCP Foundation, as it interferes with the horror feel, but is much more appropriate in Global Occult Coalition.

One last point: the Global Occult Coalition canon began as a separate wiki, but was moved to the main SCP Foundation wiki due to lack of interest, and because it became easier to administrate as a small part of the existing community than as a community of its own. Should the GOC canon grow in size to become unwieldy, it may spin off into a separate wiki once more. By contributing to this canon, you are agreeing that your stories may become part of this new GOC wiki if it is re-created, under the Creative Commons by SA 3.0 license.

+ The Council of 108
The Global Occult Coalition's leadership body. Consists of representatives from 108 of the most powerful occult organizations. Members include:
++ [[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminati|The Bavarian Illuminati]]]
An organization originally founded in 1776 to oppose superstition and promote human rights. One of the most powerful global conspiracies, and a major supporter of the Global Occult Coalition
++ The International Center for the Study of Unified Thaumatology
Headquartered in London, and founded by the remnants of the Holy Order of the Golden Dawn, the organization renamed itself after the development of the theory of Unified Thaumatology by J.S. Carver in 1913. The Center promotes the study of Unified Thaumatology (the scientific study of magic and sorcery) and is currently the largest Magical College in the modern world, with campuses in all GOC member countries, including Japan, the United States, South Africa, and India.
++ [[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Templar|The Holy Order of Knights Templar, Reformed]]]
Originally founded in 1119 as "The Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon." Disbanded in 1312 by the //Vox in excelso// papal bull issued by Pope Clement: remained in hiding until 1939, with the beginning of hostilities in World War II, when it became one of the major opposing forces to the Ahnenerbe Obskurakorps during the Seventh Occult War. The Knights Templar now exist mostly as an order of chaplains and priests, its military duties mostly supplanted by the PHYSICS Division.
++ Servants of the Silicon Nornir
A transhumanist organization, the Servants are devoted to the maintenance and worship of three massively powerful sentient supercomputers, named Urthor, Verthandi, and Skuldir after the three Norns of Norse mythology. The Servants believe that humanity's greatest purpose is the hastening of the technological singularity, which will lead to the birth of the "True Silicon Goddess," a supersentient hyperintelligence that will guide humanity to the next stage of its evolutionary journey.
++ The United Church of Satan, Scientist
An offshoot of [[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laveyan_satanism|LaVeyan Satanism]]], the Satanic Scientists believe in the supremacy of human self-will over all "false gods," and are hostile to any and all deities: if God exists, it is the duty of humankind to kill it.
++ The World Parahealth Organization
The World Health Organization's division for dealing with paranormal diseases, such as hemovorism (vampirism) and transformative lycanthropy.
