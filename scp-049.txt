**Item #:** SCP-049

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-049 is to be contained in a secure holding cell in Research Sector-██.  SCP-049 is not to be removed from its cell unless approved by a level Five or higher personnel, before which SCP-049 must be heavily sedated.  Even so, at such times is to be accompanied by two armed guards and guided by an iron collar, secured to two iron poles 2m in length, and held firmly by two level One or higher personnel while in transit.  Any experiments performed on SCP-049 are to be conducted inside of specifically prepared rooms (see document 042-D-3-18).

SCP-049’s cell should be monitored at all times via a security camera.  Should any abnormal behavior occur, Doctor ████ is to be alerted at once.

**Description:** SCP-049 is humanoid in appearance, stands at 1.9 m tall, weighing 95.3 kg.  Its face and body are not capable of being observed more fully, as it is covered in what appears to be the garb of the traditional “Plague Doctor” from 15-16th century Europe.  This material is actually a part of SCP-049’s body, as microscopic and genetic testing show it to be similar in structure to muscle, although it feels much like rough leather, and the mask much like ceramic.  It was originally discovered in ██████, England, in an alleyway, by police.  The resulting explosion caught the attention of Agent ████ ███████, who was able to [DATA EXPUNGED] and sedate it.  SCP-049 does not speak, although it seems to understand English perfectly well, and seems perfectly docile until it tries to perform “surgery”.

SCP-049’s touch is anathema to humans.  After contact with SCP-049’s hand(s), the victim (hereafter referred to as “patient”) suffers [DATA EXPUNGED] and dies within moments.  SCP-049 will then attempt to kill all humans it can see in a similar manner, supposedly to avoid interruption, before returning to its “patient”.  It produces a bag of [DATA EXPUNGED], scalpels, needle, thread, and several vials of an as-yet unidentified substance, from somewhere within its “clothes” (research has been unable to locate these tools when inside of SCP-049 through X-ray and similar techniques) and begins dissecting the “patient”, as well as inserting various chemicals into the body.  After approximately twenty minutes, SCP-049 will sew the “patient” back up and become docile once more.

The “patient” will, after a period of a few minutes, resume vital signs and appears to “reanimate”.  However, the “patient” seems completely without higher brain functions, and will wander aimlessly until it encounters another living human.  At that point, the “patient’s” adrenaline and endorphin levels increase threefold as it attempts to kill and ██████ any human beings it can find, before returning to its “mindless” state and wandering until it comes across more humans.  If the patient sustains enough damage to its body to render it incapable of movement, (up to and including blunt force trauma to the head, incineration, and [DATA EXPUNGED]) it will detonate with an explosion equivalent to 11.34 kg (25 lbs) of C-4.  It is currently unknown what chemicals cause this reaction, as SCP-049 will violently withdraw its “tool bag” into itself if threatened, and there is no way to obtain a sample safely from any “patients” without risking an explosion.  Autopsies on the corpses of “patients” have shown no substances not normally found in a human body, except for [DATA EXPUNGED], but it is unknown how this would cause any reaction whatsoever.  Furthermore, any attempt to stop SCP-049 from performing it’s “surgery” will result in a premature detonation.  SCP-049 seems completely unharmed by this, although regular fire will damage it normally.

**Addendum A-1:** SCP-049 spoke for the first time today, 12-6-20██, addressing Dr. ████.  A full account of the conversation is attached.

**''Interviewed:'''** SCP-049
**Interviewer:** Doctor Gabriel ████
**Foreword:** SCP-049 randomly began speaking with no obvious provocation en route to a testing facility.  Doctor ████ was recording notes at the time on a handheld microphone.  Irrelevant data has been omitted.
<Begin Log>
SCP-049: “What is this place?”
Dr. ████: “What?  It’s a labo…”  [There is a loud crash here, from Doctor ████ dropping the recording device in shock.]
SCP-049: “A laboratory?  It is quite marvelous.  I now find it no wonder I’ve seen so few victims of the disease in here.”
Dr ████: “Y…es…  That is why.  You see, I had thought you incapable of speech.  I’m somewhat startled you, um, can.”
SCP-049: “Oh, my, yes, good sir.  I simply prefer not to.  Most victims of the disease are quite sad and do not react at all well to conversation.  I have seen you several times now, and have not detected the disease in you, therefore I assume you are also a doctor?”
Dr. ████: “Yes, actually.  Call me Gabriel… but, what ‘disease’ are you talking about?”
SCP-049: “Why, good doctor, the Great Pestilence.  What else?”
Dr. ████: “Great pesti… Oh, the Plague.  Should have seen that coming.  But, no one here is infected, I can assure you.”
SCP-049: “Oh, good doctor, I can assure you, the Pestilence is here, and I can sense it.  It is my duty in life to rid the world of it.  My cure is most effective.”
Dr. ████: “Your cure?  Your cure has cost us hundreds of thousands in damages alone!  You have been squandering my resources!  And, on a lesser note, killing my staff!”
SCP-049: “Good doctor, my cure is most effective.”
[SCP-049 lapsed once again into silence, and no further attempts to make it speak were effective.]

<End Log>
**Closing Statement:** “We managed to get our tests done for that day, trying to figure out what causes it to perform ‘surgery’, or, more accurately, what it detects as the ‘pestilence’.  So far, research has shown us no correlation between any of the D-class personnel it has performed surgery on.  We’re still working on it.
Dr. ████
