> **Incident Report X8B9-A:**
> 
> On July 5th, 2014, Foundation staff were notified of two murdered Foundation employees found in the elevator of Basement Level A of Site-19, and the ensuing confrontation from five Foundation staff as a result, resulting in the death of Doctor Huey Carlson. Initial accounts were contradictory and none interviewed were particularly forthcoming.
> 
> Three days following the incident, SCP-████, previously known as Vincent Madyson, spoke with interviewers to clarify what had happened. In its own words:
> 
>> //I mean, fuck it, might as well try and get the story straight. Especially if everyone else is too tight-lipped to do so.//
> 
> Following //Interview ████-A// and //Interview ████-B//, the rest of those involved gave their own statements. See addena for more information.
