title:Interview Log 026-08
**Dr. █████:** "Please have a seat."

**Agent Walker:** "Thank you."

**Dr. █████:** "Let's get down to business.  I understand you're requesting a transfer out of fieldwork.  Would you like to talk about that?"

**Agent Walker:** "I'd rather not."

**Dr. █████:** "It's your choice.  However, I can't approve a transfer without reason."

**Agent Walker:** "Look, I..."  The agent paused here.  "You've seen my record.  You know I worked on twenty-six, right?"

**Dr. █████:** "I've read the report."

**Agent Walker:**  "I was there the first time we took one of the sleepers out.  A lot of them were adults when they disappeared, but they're kids again when we find them.  So, I see this sixteen-year-old boy just kind of shrivel away.  I had nightmares that night."

**Dr. █████:** "You're supposed to report any unusual dreams after contacting a potentially mind-altering phenomenon."

**Agent Walker:** "It hadn't been declared a mindscrew yet.  We just thought it was weird space thing.  We were just watching it until the Picnickers got there.  And it was a shock, you know?  We weren't expecting anything like that.  Anyway, I got over it quick enough.  I'd seen worse.  I once had a guy melt while I was holding onto him."

**Dr. █████:** "I see.  What happened next?"

**Agent Walker:** "Nothing, for a while.  I went in a couple of times, but didn't see anything too weird.  But...  Look, I know I should have reported it.  But one of my buddies had just been disappeared after getting touched by some weird SCP, and I didn't want it to happen to me."

**Dr. █████:** "You've been affected by an SCP?"

**Agent Walker:** "I...  Yeah.  It was a week later.  I was dozing in the back of the van, and I started dreaming."

**Dr. █████:** "Can you describe this dream?"

**Agent Walker:**  "Just like the others.  You've read the reports, right?"

**Dr. █████:** "Pretend that I haven't.  For the record, Agent Walker."

**Agent Walker:** "All right.  I'm in a classroom.  It's just like one of the ones in 026, but new.  Not falling apart.  I knew the teacher's name.  I knew who was sitting by me, even though I'd never seen most of them before.  The bell started ringing, but no one moved.  I raised my hand, but the teacher didn't notice.  Finally, I tried to leave, but the door wouldn't open.  Then I noticed something strange with my hand.  It had color.  Everything else was black and white.  But I felt like I was the one who was... wrong?  Out of place?  That's when I woke up.  The van was leaving.  No one else noticed I'd been asleep."

**Dr. █████:** "And you didn't think to report this?"

**Agent Walker:** "Like I said, I was scared.  And this was before they found Malek.  I figured it was just another nightmare.  Nothing weird.  And after Malek had his dream, well, they didn't do anything with him, so I figured it wasn't a big deal."

**Dr. █████:** "He was put on observation.  You should have been as well, for your own safety and for the safety of others."

**Agent Walker:** "You paper-pushers think it's all so easy, don't you?  Sitting behind a desk all day, you don't know what it's like.  Well, things aren't so clear out there.  Not when you're the one hunting talking cats in a sewer, or waiting to see if you're the one who's not going to come back this time."

Agent Walker was visibly distressed.  It was several minutes before she calmed down enough to continue the interview.

**Agent Walker:** "Anyway, it wasn't until later that we connected the dreams with the sleepers.  Not until they found those Class Ds on the second floor.  Still, I thought I might be okay.  I wasn't actually inside of twenty-six when I dreamed.  I wasn't sure until the dreams started."

**Dr. █████:** "You've having reoccurances?"

**Agent Walker:** "Yeah.  They started six months ago.  It's the same dream.  But each time, it takes me a little longer to notice it isn't real.  And when I look at my hands, they're a little more gray."
