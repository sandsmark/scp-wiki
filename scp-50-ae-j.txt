**Item #:** SCP-50-AE-J

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-50-AE-J is to be kept in a steel box locked with a padlock and wrapped in an American flag. The box containing SCP-50-AE-J is to be kept away from the following: Russian literature, radios, the Pope, first generation Russian immigrants, and pictures of Ronald Reagan. In case of [REDACTED] security staff are to begin humming the Star Spangled Banner while weeping a single tear.

**Description:** SCP-50-AE-J is an IMI Desert Eagle, with an American flag print grip. SCP-50-AE-J is unremarkable except for the fact that when fired, an adult bald eagle, designated SCP-50-AE-1, emerges from the barrel and attacks anyone who displays Communist beliefs, Russian ancestry, or unpatriotic leanings. SCP-50-AE-1 differs from a normal bald eagle specimen in that it not only appears to be able to detect sociopolitical beliefs, but also can talk, usually screaming slogans such as "Better dead than red" and "Democracy is non-negotiable". Investigations into the further properties of SCP-50-AE-1 have been stymied by the fact that SCP-50-AE-1 continues to attack Foundation scientists, calling them "PINKO FUCKS".

**Test Log: SCP-50-AE-J**

**Test #1:** SCP-50-AE-J was fired at a Class-D test subject, D-1409. SCP-50-AE-1 emerged, and savaged D-1409, while yelling "UP YOUR LEBENSRAUM YOU UBERMENSCH FUCK". D-1409 was later discovered to be of predominantly German heritage, but was a 2nd generation American immigrant with full citizenship.

**Discoveries:** SCP-50-AE-1 appears to be able to distinguish genetic and racial information in its targets. SCP-50-AE-1 also appears to have a profound dislike of Germans. D-1409 is to be incinerated entirely, after his testicles are recovered from SCP-50-AE-1.

**Test #2:** SCP-50-AE-J was fired at Class-D test subject D-6554. SCP-50-AE-1 emerged, and following its usual pattern of behavior, disemboweled D-6554 while simultaneously screeching "The only good communist is a communist with his guts held in my dripping claws". D-6554's death was later discovered to have been hastened by anaphylactic shock from an allergic reaction, caused by particulates in his lungs found to be consistent with matter from [REDACTED]. A follow up investigation confirmed that D-1409 had performed a test involving [REDACTED], shortly before testing with SCP-50-AE-J began.

**Discoveries:** SCP-50-AE-1 is a consistent entity, and appears to be summoned rather than created when SCP-50-AE-J is fired. Research into effects this could have upon containment are ongoing.

**Addendum-50-AE-1:** SCP-50-AE-J is not to be exposed to [[[SCP-1006|SCP-1006]]] due to fear of Incident-50-AE-1 reoccurring.

**Incident-50-AE-1:** on the date of 07/04/20██, SCP-50-AE-J was brought in the presence of SCP-1006 by Dr.███████, who was said to be inebriated at the time. In an episode of extreme recklessness, SCP-50-AE-J was fired in the presence of SCP-1006 and in the moment that SCP-50-AE-1 was created, it immediately attacked SCP-1006, saying "YOU COMMUNIST FUCKS, YOU DON'T DESERVE TO BE IN GEORGE BUSH'S AMERICA, SO FUCK OFF RIGHT NOW, YOU COMMIES!" with SCP-1006 replying "American bourgeoisie, your wasteful actions and traditions have caused the downfall of Mother Earth, and I am afraid that you must pay, avian pig!". After that, SCP-50-AE-1 proceeded to eat the spiders that compose SCP-1006, who replied with biting the SCP, revealing that their bites, while not immediately harmful to most people, have a venomous effect, with it increasing in potency the more capitalistic the victim is, in this case, one (1) bite scorched the affected area, and multiple bites caused SCP-50-AE-1 to be engulfed in flames and with both SCP-50-AE-1 and SCP-50-AE-J ascending to the clouds. 30 minutes later, nuclear-powered fireballs had begun descending from the clouds, which had begun to emit a flame-like glow. Just before this occurred, a voice, sounding like that of SCP-50-AE-J, boomed through the air, saying "TASTE MY RIGHTEOUS BALLS OF PURE PATRIOTISM, YOU LITTLE COMMUNIST SHITS!" With SCP-1006 replying with "Do not underestimate us! We have bombs of our own, and we shall use them to triumph, bourgeois American!". After that exchange, SCP-1006 had multiple mounds in the shape of Karl Marx busts explode, sending blue fireballs into the air to collide with the descending fireballs, creating [DATA REDACTED], destroying the territory in which this took place(which was fortunately not either of their containment units) with an explosion of █,███ kilometers in radius.
//What the actual FUCK were we thinking back there?!// -Dr. ███████, who was placed on both disciplinary leave to make up for his actions, as well as psychiatric leave to deal with his newfound PTSD, and Alzheimer's, alongside numerous instances of [DATA REDACTED], apparently caused by a cognitiohazardous effect of witnessing the explosion.
