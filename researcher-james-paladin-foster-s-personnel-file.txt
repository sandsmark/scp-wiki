title:Researcher James "Paladin" Foster's Personnel File
**Name:** Researcher James "Paladin" Foster

**Security Clearance Level:** 2

**Current Assignment:** Researcher assigned to SCP-████

**Location:** Site-413

**History:** Foster has been in Foundation employ for █ years as of this writing. He was initially recruited from university in North Carolina shortly after his graduation with a B.A in computer engineering. Foster has shown an unusual ability to quickly accept what is generally regarded as impossible or unusual, though he also displays an incredibly poor memory and organizational skills.

Foster has been noted on many occasions for a distinct preference for the preservation of life, and has made efforts to minimize the involvement of D-class in testing. This, along with an expressed preference for the “paladin” class in many popular roleplaying videogames, has earned Foster the nickname "Paladin" amongst colleagues. 

Foster has consistently been late in the submission of important research papers, lab reports, and other important documents. The quality of said documents are always acceptable, however the constant lateness has prevented Foster from receiving many promotions and earned him more than a few reprimands. When questioned as to the cause of this, Foster has cited “chronic procrastination”. This has also been attributed to Foster's tendency to place contraband applications such as videogames on his personal terminal.
