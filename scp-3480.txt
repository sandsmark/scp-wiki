**Item #:** SCP-3480

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Access to Mt. Olympus has been forbidden to civilians by the Greek government under the cover story of protecting an important cultural site.  Foundation personnel in the guise of officers of the Greek Ministry of the Interior are to prevent unauthorized entrance to the area.

To contain SCP-3480-2 instances, Area 13 has been built within Mt. Olympus, approximately 400 meters below SCP-3480.  Area 13 is equipped with 18 Scranton Reality Anchors (SRAs) arranged in a circular pattern around the facility.  All Anchors are to remain active at all times, with any damaged or malfunctioning unit repaired or replaced as soon as possible.  In addition, one Xyank/Anastasakos Constant Temporal Sink (XACTS) is to be maintained on site for use with Protocol Kronos, with a second XACTS unit placed in on site storage to serve as a back up.

MTF Omega-12 "Achilles Heels," a MTF specialized in the capture and or termination of reality altering entities is to be permanently garrisoned in Area 13 to contain SCP-3480-2 instances during Protocol Kronos. 

When a White event occurs, Protocol Kronos is to be enacted.  Following completion of the Protocol, SCP-3480-2 instances that are rated as class three reality bending entities or below will be placed in standard humanoid containment cells within Area-13.  Instances rated at class four or above will be placed into a comatose state and held on site according to the Palmer Protocol.[[footnote]]See [[[SCP-2096|SCP-2096]]][[/footnote]]

* Upon commencement of White event, Area 13 XACTS is to be used to temporally isolate Mt. ███████ from surrounding reality in order to reduce likelihood of CK class Reality Restructuring Scenario.
* One third of MTF Omega-12 shall leave Area 13 and secure a circular perimeter 100 meters from SCP-3480-1.
* MTF Omega-12 shall maintain the perimeter and rotate in four hours shifts for the duration of the White event.
* When the White event ends, MTF Omega-12 are to render the resultant SCP-3480-2 instance unconscious through the use of long range tranquilizers while off duty members are to assemble and proceed to SCP-3480 immediately to provide support if needed.
* Following apprehension or termination, MTF Omega-12 is to bring the SCP-3480-2 instance into Area 13 to be contained.
* After containment, XACTS is to be deactivated.

**Description:** SCP-3480 is the peak of Mt. Olympus, Greece. The Hume value in this area is the lowest recorded by the Foundation, measuring aprroximately 1^^-██^^ Humes on the Caldmann-Rzewski Hume scale.[[footnote]]See [http://www.scp-wiki.net/and-this-one-explains-humes Caldmann-Rzewski, 1981] for an in depth explanation of Hume values in relation to reality and anomalous phenomenon.[[/footnote]] A Hume value approaching absolute zero is theoretically impossible to occur naturally, and even Foundation tests utilizing SRAs in a pocket dimension have been unable to produce Hume levels lower than .15H. While theoretically that value could be lowered further, it would require hundreds of linked SRAs- a number only one Foundation site possesses. Despite the fact that this value should indicate a visibly distorted local reality that is brittle enough to be altered by non-anomalous humans, SCP-3480 normally shows no visible signs of its anomalous nature. The anomaly's age is estimated at ████ years, and is believed to have inspired much of Greek mythology and folklore. 

SRAs are unable to correct SCP-3480's Hume value to the baseline of 1H, though they are able to maintain baseline Hume value within Area 13 (Albeit at a reduced operating efficency).  It is thus theorized that SCP-3480 acts as hole through which local reality (whether native to this universe or taken from a nonessential universe by a SRA) is drawn.  This effect does not appear to negatively impact organisms or the environment in SCP-3480's proximity. The anomaly's origin is believed to be [DATA REDACTED]

[[include component:image-block name=Amazing_halo_effect_(1336635365).jpg|caption=SCP-3480-1 during a White event (Kant counter visible to anomaly's right)]]

SCP-3480-1 is the designation given to a phenomenon that manifests at seemingly random intervals in SCP-3480.[[footnote]]Averaging once every 19 months[[/footnote]] Between 5 and 22 minutes prior to manifestation, Kant counters in SCP-3480 read Hume values returning to baseline.  When manifestation occurs, one unconscious human will spontaneously appear approximately 3 meters above ground and will not move.  The individual will then be surrounded by an ambient white light. Following this, Hume values in SCP-3480 will once again approach absolute zero.  These occurrences are collectively referred to as a White event.

Following the individual's appearance and the return to low Hume values, SCP-3480-1 will remain for a variable length of time.  The longest white event recorded lasted approximately 480 hours, while the shortest lasted for 57 minutes.  Interacting with an SCP-3480-1 instance is impossible due to its properties.  Any and all matter that approaches within .5 meters of SCP-3480-1 will be subject to acute reality failure, resulting in instantaneous molecularization. Eventually, the light will recede and the individual within will fall to the ground and regain consciousness. These individuals are then considered to be instances of SCP-3480-2.

All Instances of SCP-3480-2 are reality altering entities of various strengths, with the power of the instance increasing the longer the length of its associated White event. SCP-3480-2 commonly show signs of sociopathy, narcissism, and violent tendencies.  SCP-███, SCP-███, and SCP-████ are believed to be SCP-3480-2 instances that manifested prior to SCP-3480's containment. Approximately 68% of SCP-3480-2 instances display physical or mental impairments. Common impairments include an additional heart chamber, amnesia, perfect polydactyl of the hands and feet, missing limb(s), increased endocranial volume and height, the presence of an abdominal organ of unknown purpose which emits and responds to radio frequencies in the 2.4-3.6 GHz range, and Intellectual Disability.  28% of SCP-3480-2 instances appear to be [DATA REDACTED]

> **SCP-3480-2-5:** "It's confusing, to say the least.  The last thing i remember is my Site receiving an alert about the Ganymede Protocol.  The next thing I know..."
>
>
> **Dr. Deets:** "Please continue."
> 
> **SCP-3480-2-5:** "It was Hell. I can't describe it any other way. Sometimes up was down, sometimes I was part of a wall, sometimes I was twisted into shapes that defied geometry, and through it all I just kept disapearing and reappearing over and over.  Nothing made any sense.  But the worst part was the people."

**Special Containment Procedures:** Access to Mt. Olympus has been forbidden to civilians by the Greek government under the cover story of protecting an important cultural site.  Foundation personnel in the guise of officers of the Greek Ministry of the Interior are to prevent unauthorized entrance to the area.

To contain SCP-3480-2 instances, Area 13 has been built within Mt. Olympus, approximately 400 meters below SCP-3480.  Area 13 is equipped with 18 Scranton Reality Anchors (SRAs) arranged in a circular pattern around the facility.  All Anchors are to remain active at all times, with any damaged or malfunctioning unit repaired or replaced as soon as possible.  In addition, one Xyank/Anastasakos Constant Temporal Sink (XACTS) is to be maintained on site for use with Protocol Kronos, with a second XACTS unit placed in on site storage to serve as a back up.

MTF Omega-12 "Achilles Heels," a MTF specialized in the capture and or termination of reality altering entities is to be permanently garrisoned in Area 13 to contain SCP-3480-2 instances during Protocol Kronos. ##blue|Members of MTF Omega-12 are forbidden from leaving Area 13 without authorization from the Area's director.  Attempting to do so will result in termination.  All members of MTF Omega-12 are to be fitted with remote kill switches surgically implanted within their skulls.  Admission into Omega-12 is not to be coerced under any circumstances to ensure willing cooperation. Use of reality altering abilities outside of Protocol Kronos is grounds for termination.##

When a White event occurs, Protocol Kronos is to be enacted.  Following completion of the Protocol, SCP-3480-2 instances that are rated as class three reality bending entities or below will be placed in standard humanoid containment cells within Area-13.  Instances rated at class four or above will be placed into a comatose state and held on site according to the Palmer Protocol.

**Protocol Kronos**
* Upon commencement of White event, Area 13 XACTS is to be used to temporally isolate Mt. Olympus from surrounding reality in order to reduce likelihood of CK class Reality Restructuring Scenario.
* One third of MTF Omega-12 shall leave Area 13 and secure a circular perimeter 100 meters from SCP-3480-1.
* MTF Omega-12 shall maintain the perimeter and rotate in four hours shifts for the duration of the White event.
* When the White event ends, present members of MTF Omega-12 are to render the resultant SCP-3480-2 instance unconscious through the use of long range tranquilizers while off duty members are to assemble and proceed to SCP-3480 immediately to provide support if needed.
* ##blue|If tranquilizers fail to incapacitate the target, MTF members with class One or Two ranking are authorized to use reality altering abilities to reduce Hume level of target, rendering it vulnerable to conventional weapons.##
* ##blue|Attempts by SCP-3480-2 instance to alter surrounding reality are to be suppressed by members of MTF Omega-12.##
* ##blue|If resistance continues or attempts to escape cause visible destabilization of reality, MTF Omega-12 members with class three ranking are authorized to use their abilities to prevent and suppress those of the target.  At this time use of live ammunition to terminate target is permitted and left to MTF discretion.##
* Following apprehension or termination, MTF Omega-12 is to bring the SCP-3480-2 instance into Area 13 to be contained.
* After containment, XACTS is to be deactivated.

**Protocol Addendum:** ##blue|Should a White event last longer than 500 hours, all members of MTF Omega-12 are to guard SCP-3480-1 instance until completion.  When SCP-3480-2 instance manifests, all MTF members are to use abilities to suppress those of the target.  To prevent a resultant CK class scenario, all MTF members are to use live ammunition to ensure immediate termination of target. Should Class Six target escape termination, Code NIGHTMARE JESTER GREEN is to be broadcast to all Foundation sites.##

Malfunction of SRAs, XACTSs, and a Pseudo-Riemannian manifold has caused local reality and timespace in SCP-3480-3 to break down. How this came to effect our Universe is presently unknown.##

The initial creation of the humans that later become SCP-3480-2 instances is believed to be the result of malfunctioning Bright/Zartion Hominid Replicators (BZHR) endlessly producing Foundation personnel and D-class.##

##blue|Due to the difficulty of capturing reality altering entities without the ability to suppress their abilities and the high likelihood of a CK class scenario resulting from a containment breach, the O5 council has authorized the creation of MTF Omega-12 "Achilles Heels."  This MTF is to be composed of healthy SCP-3480-2 instances that are copies of SCP-3480-3 Foundation personnel and display reality altering abilities that rank class three or lower.  Following capture, potential recruits are to display at least one year of good behavior and pass a psychological profiling exam designed to confirm loyalty to Foundation principles. Following this, potential recruits are to be offered membership in MTF Omega-12.##

> **Director Note:** //The use of anomalies to contain anomalies is always a difficult and dangerous endeavor, especially when the anomalies are humans that come from the very same anomaly they contain.  The specter of Able hangs over us all, but for every Omega-7 there is an Alpha-9.  The bottom line is this: without our anchors we can't stop the stronger greens with normal methods. If Omega-12 is decommissioned then the next time a vengeful D-class becomes something out of Homer we probably won't be as lucky as last time.//
