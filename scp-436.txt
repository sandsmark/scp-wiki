**Item #:** SCP-436

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-436 must be closed at all times except for testing purposes. Because devices requiring precise measurements are likely to fail; SCP-436 is wrapped in simple cloth to keep the sides from opening. It is stored in a large, unlocked room to avoid misplacing the item. Personnel below Level 3 are not allowed to enter the room.

**Description:** SCP-436 is a small locket, apparently made from gold. When opened, an inlaid photograph can be seen. It is unknown if the photograph is the source of SCP-436's effect, because this cannot be tested.

All measurements within a certain distance of SCP-436 will be affected by significant error. Objects requiring specific dimensions to function will fail; for example, lids on containers cease to fit properly. There is no observed pattern to the amount of error; it seems to constantly change, though this cannot be verified because it requires a time measurement. This issue is common to many aspects of SCP-436: the range cannot be reliably determined, the intensity of the error effect cannot be verified, and its location is often vague. It is known, however, that the error effect extends towards towards its own nature. To clarify, a measurement is required to learn anything about the error effect, and this measurement will have an error.

When SCP-436 is closed, the error effect apparently decreases in intensity--although, as previously mentioned, this cannot be confirmed.

Attempting to average many measurements affected by SCP-436 will not result in a more accurate measurement; the amount of error will be roughly the same. With multiple averages from multiple sets of trials, the result still does not gain any accuracy; it is unknown how SCP-436 produces this multi-layer effect without [REDACTED].

**Addendum:** //When handling SCP-436, leave it in a flat, open place. We usually have trouble finding it again when personnel leave it in a container. Secondly, do not write observations on SCP-436, while// near //SCP-436; they will come out garbled. -Dr. ████████//
