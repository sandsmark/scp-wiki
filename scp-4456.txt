**Item #:** SCP-4456-D

**Object Class:** --Keter-- Decommissioned

**Special Containment Procedures (Archived):** SCP-4456 is contained in a Size 4 Anomalous Aquatic Vehicle Storage Unit (S4-AAVSU) in Site-45. After every reproduction incident, the new SCP-4456 instance is to be provided with 2,500 pounds of pure silver.

**Description:** SCP-4456-D was an unmanned 16th-century Spanish galleon named "//Soy Mi Amante//"[[footnote]]I am my lover.[[/footnote]]. In terms of appearance, SCP-4456-D was no different from ships of its model during the 1500s.

Every four to six days, an exact copy of SCP-4456-D would be generated in the nearest area of water that could hold it. If the new SCP-4456-D instance was ever provided with approximately $519,000[[footnote]]Roughly 2,500 pounds of silver.[[/footnote]] in gold, silver, or gemstones, it would instantly disappear.

If an SCP-4456-D instance was not supplied with sufficient resources within twenty-four hours of manifestation, it would animate and become hostile, attempting to breach containment via ramming and on-board cannons.

**Addendum 4456.1:** During investigation into SCP-4456-D's origins, Foundation researchers discovered the following document, dating to circa 1500 C.E.:

//Note: The following document has been translated from Spanish.//

> My Queen,
> 
> I am filled with grief to report that the //Soy Mi Amante// has been struck down by unknown forces. She and her crew will be remembered as the mighty bread basket of our holy kingdom.
> 
> However, I must express my concern towards its former nature. Her valiant crew would not speak of where they obtained their bounty, we only know that it carried much of it on its returns. I fear that her destruction may be the harbinger of some great and unknown force, which has tarried too long in its acceptance of our thievery. Perhaps even mightier forces are at play here, for it seems that no mortal entity could reduce such a mighty vessel as the //Soy Mi Amante// to mere ash in moments.
> 
> May we pray that God has not taken wrath upon us, and that we continue to prosper under His grace.
> 
> Your humble servant, Dante.

**Addendum 4456.2:** To determine where items placed on board SCP-4456-D would go, ten silver coins, designed as exact copies were created and installed with microtrackers placed within each coin. After the coins had been placed aboard an SCP-4456-D instance, the tracking receiver was activated, and immediately detected all Foundation coins in the Museo Nacional del Prado. Investigation revealed that the Museum had carried the coins since 1827.

Further research by the Anomalous Chronology Department found that every time a new SCP-4456-D instance was provided with sufficient resources to disappear, the Spanish government's wealth would be retroactively increased by the value of the resources placed aboard the instance. While the exact repercussions of Foundation actions were inconclusive, it is widely speculated that the Foundation may have been at least partially responsible for Spain's Price Revolution[[footnote]]An economic recession during the 16th and 17th centuries, theorized to have been caused by the importation of silver from the Americas.[[/footnote]].

Due to the large amount of money lost to SCP-4456-D, as well as the potential violation of laws outlined in the FIR Convention[[footnote]]Foundation International Relations Convention; carries guidelines for the Foundation's interactions with sovereign nations, including, in most cases, outlawing donations to other nations unrelated to anomalous containment.[[/footnote]], SCP-4456-D was proposed for Decommissioning[[footnote]]The Decommissioned class has not been used for several years, due to the Foundation's focus on containing rather than destroying anomalies. This changed with the creation of the Decommissioning Department, an organized body created for the purpose of intentionally destroying objects deemed too difficult to contain. Note that the Decommissioned class is separate from the Neutralized class, which refers to objects that are destroyed or deanomalized unintentionally or without prior approval from the Decom. Dept.[[/footnote]].

The following proposal was submitted to the newly created Decommissioning Department:

**Addendum 4456.3:** SCP-4456-D was approved for Decommissioning. The Decommissioning consisted of SCP-4456-D being incinerated completely; any remains in the form of ash or char spontaneously disappeared. Decommissioning of SCP-4456-D was officially declared a success.
