**Item #:** SCP-1889

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** A copy of each recovered textbook containing an instance of SCP-1889 is to be contained at Site 20, inside a single locked steel cabinet within a camera monitored vault. The vault is to be considered off limits to anyone known to have a high school level education, except in cases of emergency or approved testing.

As instances of SCP-1889 are not a threat when left unsolved, containment revolves around the removal and destruction of all contaminated material. When a source is found to be contaminated, a complete recall is to be issued through appropriate channels and all copies are to be destroyed by incineration[[footnote]]A single copy may be kept for documentation's sake with Dr. A█████'s approval.[[/footnote]]. A Foundation front company, Stateside Calculus Processors, has been created for the express purpose of monitoring and removing instances of the object from before they reach circulation.

**Description:** 

SCP-1889 is the collective designation for several math problems that have been found in various North American calculus textbooks since approximately 196█. The original instance was discovered after investigation of reports of disappearances and violent murders occurring on the campus of the University of █████ were found to have all happened to individuals with access to the ███ edition of "Elementary Calculus: █ ██████████ █████". Since the original containment in 1971, an additional ██ editions have been determined to contain instances of SCP-1889.

SCP-1889 will always take the form of an optimization word problem written in the same style as the rest of the book. Copies of all known examples are stored onsite and may be viewed[[footnote]]With numbers removed to prevent contamination[[/footnote]] with approval from Dr. A████. --Though the word choice will change from edition to edition, the numbers and subsequent calculations involved have remained static in every recovered instance.-- (This is no longer true, see Addendum SCP-1889-01) Most individuals exposed to SCP-1889 in the presence of similar problems have reported that it "grabs their eye" or is otherwise interests them, claiming to have difficulty focusing on anything else when it is within their sight.

SCP-1889's anomalous effect will occur when the problem is read, understood, and solved by a human being. When a human comprehends the correct solution[[footnote]]Though it is difficult to determine the exact moment of comprehension, the moment of disappearance seems to corroborate this theory. Test-██/██/199█-4 is believed to have confirmed this hypothesis.[[/footnote]], they appear to vanish. The disappearance is as close to instantaneous as can be determined with modern technology and releases no EM radiation. The area previously occupied by the subject is usually replaced with air containing trace amounts of [REDACTED] at a median temperature of approximately 45° C. All attempts to track the location of subjects after their disappearance have failed completely.

Approximately 22-24 hours after the subject's disappearance, a rough cube of body parts[[footnote]]Confirmed by genetic testing to be the remains of the lost subject.[[/footnote]] will appear within 3 meters of their last location. In all recorded examples, said cube has consisted of an organized bundle of organs, muscle, and bone wrapped tightly in the skin of the subject. The body is usually fully accounted for except in the case of the central nervous system, which usually shows signs of partial removal. No brain matter has ever been found in a recovered cube. Recovered biomass is covered in an unknown ethanol-like liquid with heavy antimicrobial properties, rendering it biologically sterile.

Occasionally, a message will be cleanly burnt onto the recovered skin. The message is almost always in the subject's primary language, and appears to comment on the quality of the subject or request something of the recipients. The significance of these messages, as well as their origins, are unknown. Attempts to communicate through items on the subject's person has not had a noticeable effect.

Example messages:
"REQUEST ADDITIONAL SUPPLIES"
"VARIETY TOO LOW"
"SPECIMEN TOO DOCILE"
"[DATA EXPUNGED]"
"ACCEPTABLE; PLEASE REPEAT"

__**Effects Test - ██/██/199█**__
Testing was performed to determine the extent of SCP-1889's effects.
[[collapsible show="+ Show test log" hide="- Hide test log"]]
**Test 1**
> **__**Test A - ██/██/199█**__
> ****Materials:** A printed copy of SCP-1889, D-1889-1 (a high-school dropout with no knowledge of calculus)
> **Procedure:** D-1889-1 was ordered to directly observe the equation.
> **Results:**  D-1889-1 did not display any urge to solve the problem, even after reading it several times over the course of five minutes. After ten minutes of no activity, test was ended.
> **Analysis:** Subjects with no real understanding of the problem seem to be unaffected by the SCP's "interest" effect.

> **__**Test B - ██/██/199█**__
> ****Materials:** The  textbook containing the original instance of SCP-1889, D-1889-1.
> **Procedure:** D-1889-1 was ordered to open the book to the page SCP-1889 was on and observe the equation.
> **Results:**  D-1889-1 opened the book to the page and began "It's the same thing you gave me last time, what's the big de..." and stopped. After a moment's perusal, 1889-1 muttered and began flipping through the book. When queried, D-1889-1 replied that she "had this figured out" and "wouldn't take a second". After several minutes, D-1889-1 had apparently read enough to successfully complete the problem and disappeared as expected.
> **Analysis:** Subjects that cannot do calculus but have direct access to the methods of learning how to are susceptible to the "interest" effect.

Testing was then suspended temporarily for the recovery of D-1889-1's body. After disposing of the remains, testing was reinstated to determine the requirements of the removal effect.

> **__**Test C - ██/██/199█**__
> ****Materials:** A printed copy containing variants of SCP-1889 with slight numerical changes of no more than 1%, D-1889-2 (known to have taken several years of college level calculus).
> **Procedure:** D-1889-2 was ordered to solve the equations and report his thoughts on them.
> **Results:**  After expressing doubt as to the purpose of this exercise, D-1889-2 solved them all without issue. D-1889-2 removed from testing without incident.
> **Analysis:** As expected, the problem only functions when the numbers are exactly the same as the original problem.

> **__**Test D - ██/██/199█**__
> ****Materials:** The textbook containing the original instance of SCP-1889, a mathematical calculator capable of accepting textual input, D-1889-3 (possesses a fifth grade education).
> **Procedure:** D-1889-3 was ordered to input the equation into the calculator and find the answer.
> **Results:**  D-1889-3 copied the problem without issue. The moment D-1889-3 observed the calculated result, they vanished.
> **Analysis:** The subject does not need to understand the math involved, only that the answer is the answer to the question.

As with D-1889-1, testing was halted to wait for D-1889-3's reappearance. D-1889-3's body arrived unexpectedly less than 2 hours later, burnt, lacking brain matter, and violently sliced into pieces. A small message had been written repeatedly across all exposed portions of the skin, reading "QUALITY UNACCEPTABLE". Body was sampled, then incinerated.

**Addendum SCP-1889-01:** An additional █ problems with similar effects have been found and catalogued in the █th edition of Calculus ██ "Early Transcendentals". All known copies have been collected and incinerated, bar a documentation copy. This is an extremely recent development and appears to be a response to Stateside Calculus Processors successfully preventing any known cases for the last three years. With containment breach a serious possibility, all reports of disappearances or mutilated remains on college campuses matching are to be given special attention.
