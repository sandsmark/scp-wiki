**Item #:** SCP-013

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-013 is kept at Sector-19 in a circular chamber 10 m in diameter by 4 m high. No fewer than twenty-four Class-D personnel must reverently surround the item in its containment chamber at any time; all personnel in the presence of SCP-013 must refrain from speaking loudly and making any unnecessary excessive noise. 

Contact with SCP-013 by reverent observers is permitted, provided the item is at rest and the ambient environment is sufficiently reverent. Personnel will be replaced every four hours on a staggered schedule (approximately every ten minutes).

In the event that SCP-013 attempts to leave its containment chamber, personnel in its presence must calmly ask it to return. Personnel not actively observing SCP-013 may politely order the object to return to containment. SCP-013 will generally return without incident; in case it does not respond to verbal requests, as many people as possible must be brought to surround and worship SCP-013 until it stops moving. At this point, personnel may again calmly ask SCP-013 to return to its containment chamber.

Under no circumstances may any personnel raise their voice or use any amount of physical force against SCP-013.

**Description:** SCP-013 is a roughly spherical metallic object approximately 80 cm in diameter. Persons who focus on the surface of SCP-013 see the deity or deities and/or the creation myth in which the person believes. However, all footage of SCP-013 (both live and recorded) has shown its surface to be of smooth metal, suggesting that its visual effects are psychic in nature.

SCP-013 is able to move autonomously, though not by rolling, but by gliding and hopping via an unknown mechanism. While SCP-013 will usually glide at or under 3 m/s, it has also been known to launch itself at high velocity in reaction to sudden loud noises. Matter within approximately 10 mm of its surface may be selectively dissociated into microparticles, working equally effectively on both organic and inorganic materials. Under normal circumstances, SCP-013 will allow reverent observers to touch its surface, provided it is not pressed too firmly or handled roughly in any way.
