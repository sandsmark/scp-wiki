> **Paul:** Caaarl! Why is there a [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-173 statue] in our house? It's looking at me funny.
> 
> **Carl:** Whatever do you mean?
> 
> **Paul:** The statue. Right there. It's in the middle of our living room.
> 
> **Carl:** Oh, that! I thought that was a mountain.
> 
> **Paul:** Mountains don't fit in houses!
> 
> **Carl:** How do you know that?
> 
> **Paul:** I don't! How'd you even get this here?
> 
> **Carl:** I didn't bring it here. For once I am innocent.
> 
> **Paul:** Then why is it looking at //you??//
> 
> **Carl:** Must be my legs.
> 
> **Paul:** Where did you get this from?
> 
> **Carl:** My nice, sexy legs.
> 
> **Paul:** Answer me, Carl.
> 
> **Carl:** It came out of a top hat I was using for a magic trick.
> 
> **Paul:** Caaarl!
> 
> **Carl:** Fine. I broke into a place called Site 19.
> 
> **Paul:** How'd you do that? You don't even have thumbs.
> 
> **Carl:** I used an egg sandwich and a mattress tag.
> 
> **Paul:** What even is this thing?
> 
> **Carl:** I don't know. I've tried eating it and it's just made of stone and paint.
> 
> **Paul:** Why would you break into somewhere and eat what you find?
> 
> **Carl:** Because the egg sandwich wasn't enough.
> 
> **Paul:** I'm not listening anymore.
> 
> (Paul turns before Carl blinks.)
> 
> **Carl:** Woah! That thing just moved.
> 
> **Paul:** What? I turned my back for one second. What'd you do?
> 
> **Carl:** I sunk a cruise ship 4 days ago.
> 
> **Paul:** I didn't mean that!
> 
> **Carl:** Then what did you mean?
> 
> **Paul:** Why did it move?
> 
> **Carl:** It had to follow its destiny.
> 
> **Paul:** Caaarl!
> 
> **Carl:** It slipped on the floor.
> 
> **Paul:** Be honest with me.
> 
> **Carl:** I don't know! It probably noticed //your// legs.
> 
> (Paul turns around, seeing the statue in front of him.)
> 
> **Paul:** Oh God.
> 
> **Carl:** Yeah, this was probably my fault.
> 
> **Paul:** You don't say?
> 
> **Carl:** At least I didn't bring back the other thing I found.
> 
> **Paul:** What was it?
> 
> **Carl:** Some [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-096 pale guy], long arms. I looked at him for one  second and he went crazy.
> 
> **Paul:** I'm so disappointed in you.
> 
> **Carl:** Well that's mean. Now I kind of wish I brought that pale guy back.
> 
> **Paul:** I'm not talking to you anymore.
> 
> **Carl:** Well, that's rude. I'm disappointed in you now.
> 
> (Banging at the door.)
> 
> **Paul:** Who's that?
> 
> **Carl:** Probably the pale dude.
> 
> **Paul:** What? Why?
> 
> **Carl:** Maybe it's the statue's best friend.
> 
> **Paul:** Caaarl!
> 
> **Carl:** Well, I didn't know.
> 
> **Paul:** You're just being awful today.
> 
> **Carl:** I stole this yesterday.
> 
> **Paul:** I'm not even shocked at this anymore.
> 
> **Carl:** Fine, I'll go answer the door. 
> 
> **Paul:** You go do that, Carl.
> 
> (Carl walks to the door as Paul is stuck looking at the statue. 
> 
> **Carl:** Has it moved again?
> 
> **Paul:** Not yet!
> 
> (Carl walks back.)
> 
> **Carl:** Yep, it's that crazy guy.
> 
> **Paul:** I think you should keep the door closed, Carl.
> 
> **Carl:** Fine.
> 
> **Paul:** So, what should we do with this thing?
> 
> **Carl:** Sell it to an art museum. 
> 
> **Paul:** I was thinking give it back.
> 
> **Carl:** No way, we could get so many dead bodies with this.
> 
> (Pause.)
> 
> **Paul:** Caaaaaaarl!
> 
> **Carl:** Fine, I'll give it back.
> 
> **Paul:** No, I'm giving it back. 
> 
> **Carl:** Bad idea, Paul. They had lots of guns back there.
> 
> **Paul:** Fine. Well, did you do anything else there?
> 
> **Carl:** I killed some people and ate some paper.
> 
> **Paul:** Oh.
> 
> **Carl:** I mean, it was [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-085 screaming] as I was eating it.
> 
> **Paul:** The people or the paper?
> 
> **Carl:** What do you think? It was the paper.
> 
> **Paul:** Caaarl! What have I told you about eating things that scream?
> 
> **Carl:** The egg sandwich wasn't enough.
> 
> **Paul:** Caaarl!
> 
> **Carl:** You're right. You've told me not to do it.
> 
> **Paul:** Right. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to find a way to give this statue back.
> 
> (Paul starts pushing the statue out of the house.)
> 
> **Carl:** Yep, he's going to get slaughtered out there.
> 
> **Paul:** I can hear you, Carl!
> 
> **Carl:** Sorry.
> 
> (Paul exits the house, screaming.)
> 
> **Paul:** Caaaaaaarl!
> 
> **Carl:** I told you, Paul!
> 
> (Ending theme.)
