[[span style="font-family: 'Reenie Beanie' ;font-size: 22px;"]]Finally made it to Oregon today. It's about 7:30 AM as I'm writing, thinking I might get an early breakfast at a Denny's. There isn't an IHOP nearby, shame.

It's been a tiring night. Almost made it to Boring. Need to meet up with an anomaly named Jonathan Stanford, they're going to be at a Foundation branch called [http://www.scp-wiki.net/wilson-s-wildlife-solutions-hub "Wilson's Wildlife Solutions"] today. Found one of their posters looking for their [http://www.scp-wiki.net/critter-profile-sampson Doberman]; __not part of this timeline, implications of time travel.__

[[span style="font-family: 'Reenie Beanie' ;font-size: 22px;"]]Outside of Wilson's. Entering soon. I believe that Jonathan potentially has a relative working at Wilson's, possibly why the Dog is there. (unconfirmed, just speculation)

Spotted CI spy, did not seem to notice me. No MTF here, think I'm in the clear.

This is one weird place, a bunch of tree-hugger hippies.

Passed by plenty of anomimals (heh). I might (?) have found a little mister by Wondertainment here, may want to evaluate it for information later (it could just be a Wondertainment product?). There is a cow filled with bees, made my stomach churn; they even have a runaway Herman Fuller animal here. Still looking for Jonathan.
@@ @@
Talked to the manager of the place, some lady named Faeowynn. Weird name, very stern. She directed me toward "enclosure 3", contains the Dog. Think I might be close.

[[span style="font-family: 'Reenie Beanie' ;font-size: 22px;"]]It is possible that I found Jonathan, yet they were barely visible to the eye. A solid being there, but it was almost as though I were looking at a grainy photo of someone.
@@ @@
They were inside the enclosure with some other man, their name tag said Daniel Stanford. Likely a relative from this timeline. What I can only assume to be Jonathan was petting the Dog, the worker was oddly docile.
@@ @@
The blurry figure stood up for a minute and grabbed the hand of the worker as well as touching the dog. In a sudden burst of blue lightning, Jonathan was gone and the Dog was no longer abnormal. Some of the vegetation caught on fire, triggered smoke alarms.
@@ @@

@@ @@
I can only assume this mission was a failure. __There is still potential for me to locate Jonathan in the future__. As of right now, I don't believe I will be able to use time travel to make myself normal again.
