**Item #:** SCP-2727

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Each entrance to SCP-2727-1 is to be closed off upon discovery, and the proceeding area searched for instances of SCP-2727-2. Instances of SCP-2727-2 are to be terminated on sight if found outside of the area containing instances of SCP-2727-1. Testing of SCP-2727 is to be approved by at least one Level 4 Personnel. 

In incidents in which instances of SCP-2727-2 become hostile, each known entrance to SCP-2727 is to be guarded by at least three security agents until all hostile activity ceases. 

**Description:** SCP-2727-1 refers to various models of subway train, located inside several subway stations across the island of ██████, Greece. These stations collectively have ██ entrances across the island. The interior of the subway stations resembles those from the late 1950's. The boarding area for instances of SCP-2727-1 has been measured as ███ meters in length. The stations have support pillars every fifteen meters in any open direction.

SCP-2727-2 refers to humanoid individuals found inside SCP-2727-1 and the subway stations. Instances of SCP-2727-2 resemble //Homo sapiens//, but lack any facial features. Instances of SCP-2727-2 are typically docile. When an instance of SCP-2727-1 is present at a station, a large number of SCP-2727-2 will enter the SCP-2727-1, while an approximately equal number of SCP-2727-2 exit the of SCP-2727-1. 

Instances of SCP-2727-1 have been recorded moving to stations not on the island. These stations vary significantly both from stations on ██████ and from one another. Variations include:
* Station architecture in a Gothic style.
* Holes varying in size and of uncertain origin and purpose located along walls, ceilings and floors.
* Station interior composed of //Osteocytes// (human bone), and of raw flesh apparently of //Sus scrofa domesticus// (domestic pig).
* Station containing no instances of SCP-2727-2. It was noted that no instances of SCP-2727-2 disembarked during this stop.

Instances of SCP-2727-2 have been found to change in physical appearance: the features of some instances have been observed transforming to resemble those of //Sus scrofa domesticus// (domestic pig). Instances were noted to be unusually hostile while in this form.

The origin and purpose of SCP-2727 has not been determined. Investigations are ongoing. 

**Incident Report 2727a:** Instances of SCP-2727-2 at station ██ became hostile, attacking foundation security personnel and attempting to exit the station. Hostile instances were terminated immediately. Approximately fifteen minutes later an instance of SCP-2727-1 arrived at the station. Fifteen instances of SCP-2727-2 disembarked and proceeded to carry deceased instances onto SCP-2727-1. - Agent Galanis, 17th April 20██.

//D-203583 is a ██ year old Asian male of average build. D-203583's psychological profile is unremarkable. D-203583 is equipped with a camera fitted with a transmission stream, and an audio headset. Dr. ███████ is observing and issuing instructions remotely.//

//D-203583 is instructed to enter one of the stations. Seventeen instances of SCP-2727-2 are seen inside the station. No instances of SCP-2727-1 are present.//

**D-203583:** Nothing is here but those faceless things.

**Dr. ███████:** Please wait in the general area until the train arrives.

**D-203583:** Doc I don't think a train runs through here, there isn't even a map of the routes here. 

**Dr. ███████:** Just wait. 

//Approximately fifteen minutes pass before an instance of SCP-2727-1 arrives. Seventeen instances of SCP-2727-2 disembark from SCP-2727-1, and sixteen instances embark.//

**Dr. ███████:** Please board the train.

**D-203583:** Alright doc, where is this thing going?

**Dr. ███████:** You do not require that information. Please board the train.

//D-203583 proceeds to enter one of the passenger cabins of SCP-2727-1. Forty six instances of SCP-2727-2 are visible. Despite adequate available seating, they are all standing.//

**D-203583:** Do you want me to just stand here with these things?

**Dr. ███████:** You may sit until the next destination is reached.

**D-203583:** These things aren't moving doc, are they alive?

**Dr. ███████:** They have vital signs but are not sapient.

//SCP-2727-1 remains stationary for six minutes before moving. SCP-2727-1 continues moving for fifteen minutes along an illuminated, round tunnel. After fifteen minutes, all lights within SCP-2727-1 cease functioning for approximately nineteen seconds. When lights become functional again, all visible instances of SCP-2727-2 have transformed to resemble humanoid pigs, though still lacking detailed facial features. D-203583 becomes panicked.//

**D-203583:** [EXPLICIT]! What the [EXPLICIT] happened? They look like [EXPLICIT] pigs!

**Dr. ███████:** They do that sometimes. 

**D-203583:** Sometimes?

**Dr. ███████:** As in, they don't always do it.

//SCP-2727-1 comes to a halt, and fifteen instances of SCP-2727-2 disembark along with D-203583. Sixteen instances of SCP-2727-2 embark. SCP-2727-1 leaves two minutes after disembarkation. The station appears to be composed of raw pig flesh. Support pillars appear to be composed of bone. Twenty two instances of SCP-2727-2 are waiting in the station.//

**D-203583:** Jesus Christ. [Pause] It smells like someone is cooking hotdogs.

**Dr. ███████:** Noted. Can you see an exit?

//D-203583 walks towards the far wall of the station. A slanted hole in the wall, emitting light, is observed approximately nineteen meters ahead of D-203583.//

**D-203583:** I think there's a room through that hole.

**Dr. ███████:** Please approach the opening.

//D-203583 proceeds to approach the hole. Three instances of SCP-2727-2 follow him.//

**D-203583:** Doc? A few of these things are starting to follow me.

**Dr. ███████:** Noted. Please exit the station.

//D-203583 exits the station. Audio shows that an instance of SCP-2727-1 has arrived at the station in the meantime. The outside of the station is covered completely in pig flesh. A green smog limits visibility to approximately sixteen meters. Approximately forty instances of SCP-2727-2 are visible outside the station. No geographic features are visible. Six instances of SCP-2727-2 approach D-203583.//

**D-203583:** Doc, more of these things are coming towards me.

**Dr. ███████:** Noted. Please move the camera so we can-

**D-203583:** Doc, the ones inside the station are starting to run.

//Video feed shows seven instances of SCP-2727-2 running out of the station towards D-203583.//

**Dr. ███████:** Confirmed. Please remain calm.

//Seven instances of SCP-2727-2 assault D-203583, bludgeoning him with their fists and heads. An additional three instances approach D-203583 with large stones. D-203583 is heard cursing in Mandarin and begging for mercy. He is bludgeoned to death.//

//D-203584 is a ██ year old Caucasian male of average build. D-203584's psychological profile is unremarkable. D-203584 is equipped with a camera fitted with a transmission stream, and an audio headset. Dr. ███████ is observing and issuing instructions remotely.//

//D-203584 is instructed to enter one of the stations. Six instances of SCP-2727-2 are inside the station. An instance of SCP-2727-1 arrives.//

**Dr. ███████:** Please board the train.

**D-203584:** What about these... faceless things?

**Dr. ███████:** They are not relevant, please board the train.

//D-203584 boards the instance of SCP-2727-1 along with two instances of SCP-2727-2. Three instances of SCP-2727-2 disembark. Nine instances of SCP-2727-2 are standing inside the train.//

**Dr. ███████:** Please wait until the destination is reached.

**D-203584:** Where is it going?

**Dr. ███████:** You do not require that information.

**D-203584:** There's a poster here.

**Dr. ███████:** Confirmed. Please steady the camera on the poster.

//D-203584 adjusts the camera to show the poster. The poster depicts seven instances of SCP-2727-2 performing a variety of leisure activities beneath the words "Good Clean Folk."//

**Dr. ███████:** Thank you. Please inspect the train car for items of a similar nature.

//D-203584 searches the train car for approximately nine minutes before finding what appears to be a small personal journal and a brochure. Instances of SCP-2727-2 do not acknowledge D-203584 during this time. SCP-2727-1 begins moving.//

**D-203584:** I found this... journal. It's got hand-writing in it, it's English.

**Dr. ███████:** How many pages of writing does it have?

**D-203584:** About five. What do you want me to do with it?

**Dr. ███████:** Please hold each page in front of the camera long enough for stills to be taken of each. 

//D-203584 proceeds. (Refer to Document 2727-A.) The instance of SCP-2727-1 stops, the doors open, and thirteen instances of SCP-2727-2 rush towards D-203584. They are wearing what appear to be gas masks, and equipped with unfamiliar firearms reminiscent of American firearms manufactured in the late 1950's. D-203584 is dragged from the instance of SCP-2727-1 before video feed cuts off.//

**Document 2727-A**

> //**January 21, 19██**//
> //They took Bill's eyes today, sewed the sockets shut. We're just infantry, back in the world Bill's an insurance lawyer, just a normal guy from Nebraska, what the hell are they torturing him for? He stopped screaming lately. I thought they did something to his voice til he asked me where God was. Johnny stopped banging on the door after one of them opened it and hit him with the butt of its gun. Whatever these things are, they aren't normal. They don't seem human.//
> 
> //Bill's too calm, considering what happened. I think his mind's gone.//
> 
> //**January 25, 19██**//
> //They took Bill again. Last time they took Johnny's fingers, but Bill's had the worst so far. We didn't hear much screaming. He came back and didn't talk. I left him alone til I heard him humming. He looked up with his sewed up eyes, and I almost threw up. They took his mouth too.//
> 
> //**February 3, 19██**//
> //Bill's been gone for about two days now. Johnny figures he's dead, I sure hope so. I thought about killing him before they took him again, just end the misery. He just sat there, bald, blind, mute. I think they closed his ears.//
> 
> //**February 9, 19██**//
> //Bill's back. They took the stitches out. Shaved his eyebrows too. Can't see where his eyes or lips are anymore. He just sat against the wall next to the door. I can't figure out how he's breathing. John said he breathes through his ass now. It was a joke but I wouldn't be surprised. They gave him new clothes, just like his old ones but not covered in blood. He looks like one of those mannequins in a store.//
> 
> //**February, 19██**//
> //They took us all out and stuck us on a train. It moved for a while and then the doors opened, and a bunch of these faceless things that looked like Bill got on. John lost it, started screaming they'd turned Bill into one of those things. I guess we're next.//
> 
> //God have mercy.//
> 
> //They look like pigs.//
