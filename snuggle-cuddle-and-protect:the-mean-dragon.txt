title:Snuggle, Cuddle, and Protect: The Mean Dragon
The following document was recovered by Agent ███████ following a vacation in ███████████, Florida:

> **Document X45-a**
> 
> "The Mean Dragon"
> 
> There once was a dragon that made everyone mad,
> He changed his shape just to make people sad!
> He'd be mean to everyone! Yes, even you!
> Everyone called him six-eighty-two.
> One day the big doctor had had enough,
> "You're mean and you're smelly,
> I'll show you who's tough!"
> First he decided to use a big crystal
> "I'll freeze and then shatter him with my pistol!"
> The dragon's skin showed a quick aversion,
> So it stopped at 62% conversion!
> Then the big doctor thought, "Hmm.. what to do...
> I know I'll use good ol' 162!"
> But the mean dragon was too clever for him,
> And he attached the big ball to his left fore-limb!
> He ran around the big halls and made a terrible mess,
> Then he went back to his home under much distress.
> The big doctor groaned and he moaned and he stomped,
> When he suddenly saw a little agent prompt,
> "Sir, I know a way out of this pickle,
> We'll just show the dragon the monster that tickles!"
> So they sent 999 to deal with their foe,
> But 999 didn't want to go,
> So they told it the dragon was being too mean,
> And it went bravely onto the scene.
> It jumped on the dragon, who let out a roar,
> But he tickled and tickled and tickled some more,
> Then, suddenly, the dragon was giggling,
> But the monster just kept on jiggling and jiggling,
> Finally the dragon pulled the monster off,
> But he did not let out a roar or a scoff,
> He said, "Thank you, sir, you're a saviour hereafter,
> Cause you have shown me the great gift of laughter."
