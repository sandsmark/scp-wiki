**Item #:** SCP-1000

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1000 is to be kept in a secure storage facility.  SCP-1000 is to remain in its original sleeve protected by a padded polymer envelope and kept from excessive heat or moisture.  SCP-1000 itself is only to be tested with level 4 authorization, and all such tests must be non-invasive in nature.  Audio equipment used for testing SCP-1000 must be inspected and approved by the site director prior to testing.  Digital and analog audio recordings of SCP-1000 may be used for testing by any research personnel with level 3 approval.

**Description:** SCP-1000 is a LP album by ████ ████████ titled ████████ ██ ███ and released by ███ Records in the United States in 198█.  Labeling of both SCP-1000 and its original packaging indicates no differences from any other albums produced in the same batch that includes SCP-1000, though no other copies of ████████ ██ ███ seem to share SCP-1000’s anomalous properties.

Unlike any other copies of ████████ ██ ███ so far examined, SCP-1000 shows an anomalous  topology in the layout of the musical tracks recorded on its surface.  In particular, track number five of ████████ ██ ███, titled “███████ ████████”, shows grooves that have apparently twisted in on themselves through an higher-order spatial dimension resulting in a configuration analogous to a Möbius strip.  The result of this is that when played on a standard record player from the beginning of the album, the needle will skip directly from track four to track six.  However, when the needle is placed anywhere in track five, the player will begin an endless loop, first playing track five as released, then reversing and playing a recording of unknown origin as the needle moves backward to the beginning of track five, at which point it begins playing the standard track five again.

While the anomalous recording on SCP-1000 bears a superficial resemblance to track five played in reverse, it is a completely new recording and, when reversed itself, contains different lyrics and instrumentation than the standard recording of “███████ ████████.”  Voice-print analysis confirms that the new track shares no vocalists in common with the rest of the album.  Subjects who listen to this anomalous recording universally report feelings of dread and unease.

In addition to lyrics and instrumentation, the anomalous recording also contains several harmonics in frequencies that are generally only audible to people in late adolescence or earlier.  These harmonics seem to enhance the unpleasant feelings associated with listening to the recording, causing depression, suicidal ideation, paranoia, and in a minority of cases aggressive acting out.

All these symptoms appear to derive from a progressive disconnect between the subject and reality.  Subjects with moderate to severe symptoms report fantasies and what they term "uneasy dreams" about unreal environments.  These imagined environments share several common characteristics:

* Landscapes and architecture show impossible geometries that are difficult to verbalize, possibly as a result of mapping higher-order spatial dimensions onto three-dimensional sensory perceptions.

* Environments contain malevolent entities described in various ritualistic and contradictory ways; "seen and unseen," "living and unliving," "nowhere and everywhere," and similar. 

* The act of perception in these environments is associated with physical pain, often resembling a severe migraine.

* These environments seem hyper-real to the subjects experiencing them.

Subjects who begin experiencing these fantasies and dreams will continue to experience them regardless of any therapeutic, chemical or surgical intervention yet attempted.  These fantasies are progressive and erode the subject's ability to interact with the world around them.  Eventually the perception of this environment intrudes on the waking conscious mind until the subject can only react to elements within the fantasy.

These symptoms may occur when listening the recording backward or forward, though they present more intensely when the recording is heard as it is naturally played on SCP-1000, backwards.  Analog recordings of SCP-1000 will also show these effects to a lesser extent.  Digital copies do not seem to present the same dangers.
