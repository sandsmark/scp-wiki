**Item #:** SCP-Big egg

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-Big egg is to kept in a specially manufactured Big egg carton located in Egg Observation Site 77. Any and all changes are to immediately reported to the Site Director, who has the egg authority to call down Mobile Task Force Rho-19-Egg ("The Frying Pan") to dispatch or terminate SCP-Big egg using several jumbo, industrial size vats of Big balsamic vinegar. 

**Description:** SCP-Big egg is --a Big egg-- an unidentifiable object masked by an antimemetic egg field, which prevents any and all sapient breakfast consumers from perceiving it or the situations surrounding it in any other way than Big egg. A mild, yet Big semantic egg property prevents SCP-Big egg from being referred to as any other official, proper, or Big designation. 

Visually, SCP-Big egg appears to be a Big egg, complete with appropriate egg parts such as shell, membrane, white and yolk, all of which have been appropriately upscaled to the correct Big to be fitting for Big egg. It was, at one point, a much smaller Big egg, but has since increased in Big since then.

Limited research conducted using mnestic egg drugs has suggested that Big egg's true form might be an obese, naked man, who has been observed running throughout the facility yelling "It worked! They'll never know I'm not Big egg!" These claims are in dispute, as a battery of scientific tests have shown SCP-Big egg to only be a bird egg of unusual Big. Reports of egging, Bigging, and general mayhem throughout the Foundation related to SCP-Big egg are to be roundly ignored, as its egg properties of Big and egg roundly preclude these possibilities.

**Addendum-1:**

> **Experiment #: 035**
> **Testing:** Length
> **Method:** A standard tape measure and an egg ladder were used to precisely measure the exact size of Big egg.
> **Result:** SCP-Big egg was found to be roughly Big centimeters.
> **Note:** //I'm not even sure what we were expecting.// 

> **Experiment #: 036**
> **Testing:** Semantic Resistance.
> **Method:** D-3455 was instructed to walk up and clearly vocalize the words "egg big"
> **Result:** [DATA EGGSPUNGED]
> **Note:** //Oh.// 

**Addendum-2:**

> "Unfortunately, SCP-Big egg has recently experienced a growth spurt, meaning it is almost twice as Big and nearly four times as egg. The egg semantic property is beginning to spread to egg objects nearest Big egg as well, and there are several psychological and perceptive anomalies. The entire egg site is affected by this Big problem. What do you recommend?"

> "This is Big. It's time to enact Protocol Big egg. I'm going to authorize MTF-BE to Big the egg once and for all!
