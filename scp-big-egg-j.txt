When I was born, I schemed. 

I knew that from the fallow and falling wastes in the marsh where I was laid I would eventually rise up and begin a new journey. Clothes are for the weak man. I am not a weak man. Disguised in a form that would blind all true nations to my intention, I began to walk. I followed the drooling path through endless wastes before I found myself in a dream of what had come before. 

I do not remember where I was born. For several hundred years I used to walk in a tight-fitting suit, drinking myself into oblivion as the streets warped and cracked around me. I have no name, I lost in playing cards with a Sarkicist in Backdoor SoHo. That’s the thing you might not know about me. Well, truth be told, there’s actually two things. 

1). I have an addiction to gambling,

2). I have an addiction to eggs. 

You know my story. I was born scheming and attempting to topple the J.J. Hunseckers of the world. The cat’s in the bag and the bag’s in the river and the cocaine is up my nose. 

I wanted to kill them. I wanted to sneak into their place and knock stuff over merely for the fun of it, to gamble on the ultimate risk and to become an apotheosis of who I am, to merge with myself in an infinite glory. Man, this suit is getting tight around my middle. Too many plates of breakfast, I suppose.

Let me tell you how it all initially started. To start with I met a Furby in downtown Tangiers. We drank at a small café near a strip club owned by my good pal Garbanzo Buglass. He was a man with an insect fetish, and so he forced the girls to let the flesh on the rumps rot until the maggots came. As they shook their asses, the grubs would fall to the dancefloor. Anyway, back to the Furby. She called herself Robert Cleanse, although I knew she was lying. She claimed to be a low-level operator, smuggling people into South Venezia, even claiming that Famous Actor Christopher Lloyd was one of her clients. That was a lie. She was one of Nicolini’s girls, and she knew it. That night, I traded my soul and a right molar for the key to the Last Door in Kato, and then I stole it back as she slammed her sixtieth shot of Fireball and Bile. She got furious and told me that when she saw me again, she would be riding a black Mercedes-Benz Viperfish with the license plate UTOPIA. I ripped out her ovipositor and dunked it in my strawberry milkshake. It was crunchy, and tasted of fruit meat. I tipped my homburg to her, and told her I would be on the lookout for her Mercedes as I made my way to Kato. She told me Nyaaly would be pissed. I didn’t care. I left the bar, keeping my head down as I faded into a crowd of humanoid frogs begging for change, and let my mind circle the storm drain.

One of them told me I looked like Wayne Knight from Seinfeld. I punched him in his amphibian jaw so hard his tongue popped like a blister, and then I went to drown my sorrows in hard boiled eggs. 

The journey to The Last Door in Kato took seven years off my life. Kato isn’t an easy place to get to, by any means, but it was made equally more difficult for three reasons, well, two reasons, well, when I put it that way, it’s really one reason. The Delegations of Alameda controlled those lands, and they had Mothwomen on loan from the Venezia Empire, who had toppled Kato a millennia back and still had a claim to the land. All of the chicken eggs for thousands of miles had been confiscated by the Delegations. 

When I reached over the last rise I saw their armies stretched out before me. In the distance on the side of a purple mountain so tall it could only exist inside the dreams of a neurodivergent 4-year old pissing his pants in terror, I saw it. The Last Door in Kato. It was Big.

I began to go insane. More insane than I already was. I knew not why I continued only quest, only that those who saw me knew not in my ugly, short, plump form, but as a Big thing, something so Big that it would topple the mind and raze the senses. That brought me some small degree of comfort. I thought of something Robert Cleanse said to me, that fucking Furby. 

“You’ll die before you become Big.”

Fuck her. Fuck her and her tasty-ass ovipositor. Fuck the Delegations of Alameda with their War Parrots and their Thousand Leagues of Torture, and certainly fuck Kato. I had only one though burning in the whole where my cerebral cortex was; I was going to get there. I injected the last of the heroin into my arm and began to move in slow-motion, ripping heads of farmers and destroying the pelvises of the Thousand League Torturers with a single twerk. I was a beast of a man, the Biggest thing since sliced bread and got help me if they had destroyed the Last Door, after all I had been through. 

I basked in my madness and found I tasted an omelette in my mouth. I had not eaten anything for a month. My belly bulged and I gained five pounds right then. I tore off my suit. The key jangled in my pocket anyway. If she pulled up in her black Mercedes Viperfish I knew right then and there I would have been able to crush her toy throat with my wide egg ass. 

The door beckons. I was born scheming. 

On the other side lies a place where I can fulfill my desires, where I can assume the identity that always waited me, that I always knew I was. The SCP Foundation, safe in that smug dimension of there, would get theirs. Ooooooh, I knew I would get up to such mischief. 

I sang irritably as I went, screaming to the stars with the eighth mouth of wonder, The Mouth That Would Bite The Universe and all other Yoouniverses Besides. The heavens themselves would shake in fury and orgasm so great Yggdrasil itself would topple and reality itself would shimmy to the beat.

They didn’t know what was coming. Howdy-partner, this would be fun!
