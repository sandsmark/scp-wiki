[[include component:image-block name= Conwell.jpg |caption=Researcher Conwell leads the Foundation's effort to discover why kids love the taste of Cinnamon Toast Crunch.]]

**Full Name:** Jacob “JC” Conwell

**Personnel Classification:** B

**Security Clearance:** 2 

**Current Assignment:** Currently head of SCP-1360-1 collection and research, following the retirement of Dr. Johnson.

**Position:** Anomalous Materials Analyst

**Location:** Site-19 

**History:** Following recruitment, Researcher Conwell has been removed from research positions aboard the SCPS //Cassandra// and at Site-84 at the requests of Dr. █████ and Researcher ███████ respectively. In both cases research staff cited that the request was due to Researcher Conwell’s “long windedness, constant need for feedback and overly meticulous nature.”

**Profile:** Always hard working, Researcher Conwell has been willing to do any task set before him with a smile on his face, though his constant need for feedback often results in his constant asking of the question, “How am I doing?” This has annoyed several of Conwell’s peers to the point of avoidance.

**[[[SCP-1260]]] – HMS //Tiresias//**
//"Aboard SCP-1260 reside the skeletal remains of the ship’s original 2██ crewmen in addition to a total of ██ other individuals and the █ Foundation agents lost during Exploration 1.”//

This is currently my oldest skip, an easily my first successful article on the website. I wrote it back in 2012 after noticing we didn't really have a skip that was a classic example of a ghost ship, and so I decided to try my hand on the subject. This was one of two articles I had pre-written before I joined the site, and as such I'm quite pleased with how well its done.

**[[[SCP-1360]]] – PSHUD #31**
//"#31’s personality will evolve over time based on its interactions with you and your use of the unit. Within a matter of days #31 can become both your daughter’s best friend and your most loyal servant."//

While this is not my best article on the site, it is easily my favorite article that I have written, and my first humanoid skip. It also has the most potential for tales out of all my articles, hence why the vast majority of my tales are related to this skip in some fashion. This article that has gone under more major overhauls than most main list articles, but I think I've finally hit a version that works for the story I want to tell. If the "Anderson" GOI ever takes off, this will be the original Anderson skip.

**[[[SCP-1760]]] – Casket Garden**
//"SCP-1760-1 through 15 are a series of 15 black pine coffins that annually rise from the ground at noon on November 15th in a wooded area outside Minsk, Belarus. Due to the results of the 15/11/2006 opening of SCP-1760-16 and the subject’s increasingly hazardous contents, this particular instance of SCP-1760 is to remain sealed at all times upon manifestation."//

Currently my first moderately popular article on the site, 1760 is an example of seeing a picture in the visual records and then working tirelessly to make something out of it. Its also pretty neat that it has garnished quite a few upvotes on the Russian wiki.

**[[[SCP-2960]]] – The Show MUST Go On…**
//"I just, you know, it's a shame that it's got to end, right? I mean, Christ, for some of these kids, all they've got is the theatre… it's funny, I guess, and kind of sad, cause this might be the best thing they do with their lives, you know, cause they don't have the money for college, or the grades."//

2960 is easily what I would consider my best article on the site to date. Having been a theater technician during high school, this article played onto a few of the fears my fellow technicians and actors had in terms of working backstage prior and during a show. The picture used in the article is from a production of //Urinetown// that I was involved in, hence my use of that particular play within this skip.

**[[[SCP-2860]]] – Made of Stone**
//"Afternoon Melissa. I have to say this is really weird. I never really imagined what it was like to be on the other side of what we do here… I can’t say I’m too fond of it."//

This article was an attempt to take an anomalous character from several of my tales and give them new life as a main list article. While there might be some disagreement as to how well that was executed in this article, I would be lying if I say this wasn't one of my favorite pieces on the site. Its also a bit heavy on the feels, so there is that as well.

**[[[SCP-2106]]] – A Conspiracy of Ravens**
//"I like being a raven because it makes everything so simple. They like being me because it makes everything so complex."//

This article is easily the longest one in the making, with the original draft starting back in 2014, dying, and then being revived due to some very helpful discussion on the forums. It was also the article I had that blew up the fastest, which is nice.
