[[include component:image-block name= Conwell.jpg |caption=Researcher Conwell leads the Foundation's effort to discover why kids love the taste of Cinnamon Toast Crunch.]]

**Full Name:** Jacob “JC” Conwell

**Personnel Classification:** B

**Security Clearance:** 2 

**Current Assignment:** Head of the Site-64 anomalous materials lab.

**Position:** Anomalous Materials Analyst

**Location:** [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-64|Site-64]]]

**History:** Following recruitment, Researcher Conwell has been removed from research positions aboard the SCPS //Cassandra// and at Site-84 at the requests of Dr. Allen and Researcher  Hastings respectively. In both cases research staff cited that the request was due to Researcher Conwell’s “long windedness, constant need for feedback and overly meticulous nature.”

In 2010, Conwell was transferred to Site-19 where he then served under Dr. Zachary Johnson within the SCP-1360-1 research lab. After Johnson’s retirement in 2012, Conwell lead the project for an additional two years until Incident 1360-6 resulted in the neutralization of SCP-1360. Conwell was then transferred back to Site-84 where he participated in the SCP-1760 2014 and 2015 cycles.

As of April of 2016, Conwell has been transferred to Site-64 where he currently heads the facility’s anomalous materials lab.

**Profile:** Always hard working, Researcher Conwell has been willing to do any task set before him with a smile on his face, though his constant need for feedback often results in his constant asking of the question, “How am I doing?” This has annoyed several of Conwell’s peers to the point of avoidance.

**[[[SCP-1260]]] – HMS //Tiresias//**
//"Aboard SCP-1260 reside the skeletal remains of the ship’s original 2██ crewmen in addition to a total of ██ other individuals and the █ Foundation agents lost during Exploration 1.”//

This is currently my oldest skip, an easily my first successful article on the website. I wrote it back in 2012 after noticing we didn't really have a skip that was a classic example of a ghost ship, and so I decided to try my hand on the subject. This was one of two articles I had pre-written before I joined the site, and as such I'm quite pleased with how well its done.

**[[[SCP-1360]]] – PSHUD #31**
//"#31’s personality will evolve over time based on its interactions with you and your use of the unit. Within a matter of days #31 can become both your daughter’s best friend and your most loyal servant."//

While this is not my best article on the site, it is easily my favorite article that I have written, and my first humanoid skip. It also has the most potential for tales out of all my articles, hence why the vast majority of my tales are related to this skip in some fashion. This article that has gone under more major overhauls than most main list articles, but I think I've finally hit a version that works for the story I want to tell. If the "Anderson" GoI ever takes off, this will be the original Anderson skip.

**[[[SCP-1760]]] – Casket Garden**
//"SCP-1760-1 through 15 are a series of 15 black pine coffins that annually rise from the ground at noon on November 15th in a wooded area outside Minsk, Belarus. Due to the results of the 15/11/2006 opening of SCP-1760-16 and the subject’s increasingly hazardous contents, this particular instance of SCP-1760 is to remain sealed at all times upon manifestation."//

Currently my first moderately popular article on the site, 1760 is an example of seeing a picture in the visual records and then working tirelessly to make something out of it. Its also pretty neat that it has garnished quite a few upvotes on the Russian wiki.

[[div class="content-panel standalone series" style="background-color: #fffff0;"]]
**[[[SCP-2960]]] – The Show MUST Go On…**
//"I just, you know, it's a shame that it's got to end, right? I mean, Christ, for some of these kids, all they've got is the theatre… it's funny, I guess, and kind of sad, cause this might be the best thing they do with their lives, you know, cause they don't have the money for college, or the grades."//

2960 is easily what I would consider my best article on the site to date. Having been a theater technician during high school, this article played onto a few of the fears my fellow technicians and actors had in terms of working backstage prior and during a show. The picture used in the article is from a production of //Urinetown// that I was involved in, hence my use of that particular play within this skip.

**[[[SCP-2860]]] – Made of Stone**
//"Afternoon Melissa. I have to say this is really weird. I never really imagined what it was like to be on the other side of what we do here… I can’t say I’m too fond of it."//

This article was an attempt to take an anomalous character from several of my tales and give them new life as a main list article. While there might be some disagreement as to how well that was executed in this article, I would be lying if I say this wasn't one of my favorite pieces on the site. Its also a bit heavy on the feels, so there is that as well.

**[[[SCP-2106]]] – A Conspiracy of Ravens**
//"I like being a raven because it makes everything so simple. They like being me because it makes everything so complex."//

This article is easily the longest one in the making, with the original draft starting back in 2014, dying, and then being revived due to some very helpful discussion on the forums. It was also the article I had that blew up the fastest, which is nice.

**[[[SCP-2306]]] – Revenant AI**
//"Thank you for your purchase of the NANKEEN™ Computer Repair System. No longer will you be forced to spend numerous hours in frustration attempting to fix problems with your personal computer, or costly computer repair fees. Just plug the NANKEEN™ Computer Repair System into your Mac or PC and watch as your computer comes to life to literally fix itself."//

After SCP-1360 I created nearly a dozen tales about the Anderson GoI, but didn't get around to creating another article, until now. Moving Anderson's story onto the next step, this article went through a total of six major overhauls before arriving at the final product, coming second only to SCP-1360 in terms of me tinkering with an idea before reaching a polished product. Come for the Anderson, stay for just how damn polite this skip is.

**[[[SCP-2806]]] – We Have The Technology**
//"You see, Vince, this is the kind of bullshit that goes down when you make a deal with the devil."//

Like its predecessor, SCP-2306, this article was part of my plan to move Anderson's story onto the next step. Its easily the fastest I have gone from an idea to a final draft, this article only took one day to write, and spent three days on the draft review floor before posting. If you’re a fan of the Anderson Robotics GoI, this article is for you.

**[[[SCP-3060]]] – Sleep Paralysis**
//"While instances of of SCP-3060-A appear as featureless silhouettes upon first manifestation, they quickly take on a unique shape based on each infected individual. As such SCP-3060-A entities have no standard appearance. While a full list of observed SCP-3060-A instances can be found in Document 3060-B, notable observed instances include://

* //A figure roughly the size of a human infant composed entirely of fused teeth.//
* //A humanoid superficially resembling an elderly woman dressed in dark clothes, lacking a mouth or eyes. The instance's arms are both severely injured, with compound fractures visible.//
* //A partially disintegrated humanoid composed of ash, dressed in red lingerie.//
* //A naked humanoid, covered in tire tracks and showing signs of severe crush injuries.//
* //A humanoid whose torso consisted of a large mouth.//
* //A clown."//

SCP-3060 was my entry for the highly anticipated 3000 Contest, and my first real attempt at writing a horror article on the site. Inspired by some of my friend's and family member's experiences with hypnagogic sleep paralysis, this article came into being after the idea of sleep paralysis hallucinations using their victims as bait to trap prey popped into my head one night. While it wasn't the most critically acclaimed entry into the contest, people liked it enough to get it pretty close to +100 before the contest ended, and it was my first skip after almost a year of binge posting tales. That is what makes it a winner in my book.

**[[[SCP-3960]]] – Best Friends Forever**
//"Do you think I should tell them, next time we are allowed to speak, that God allows evil to exist to better understand, and contain it?"//

SCP-3960 started out originally as a collaboration between myself and [[*user A Random Day]] in an attempt to make sure the Anderson Robotics GoI made its way into Series IV shortly after it opened. Unfortunately, with ARD busy with IRL finals, his role become more of an editor, and the collab turned into a solo piece. Still, it’s a nice, cute article with a delicious punch that ties AR into Dr. Wondertainment. 

If you're reading this ARD, it would not be nearly as nice an article had it not been for you. Thank you for all your editing work, and for just being a kick ass friend.

**[[[SCP-3560]]] – All Robots Go To Limbo**
//"Well, I've already told you guys that how our robots worked was closer to zapping a soul into a brain dead body than it was traditional robotics tech. The thing is, if you destroy that body, that soul is still going to be hanging around. It's got to go somewhere."//

This article came about after it was brought to my attention that a lot of material in the Anderson Arc focuses on the SCP Agents, and AR employees, but not a whole lot of screen time is given to the robots themselves, with the exception of a few tales. This article served both to correct that problem, as well as provide a bit of an aftermath/epilogue for the tale [[[The Blackbird and The Falcon]]]. 

On top of that, this article gave Agent Shaw and [[[SCP-1360]]] a chance to shine, as well as serving as the first time Vincent Anderson appeared in an SCP article proper and not a tale.

There is definitely a lot of fertile ground generated by this article for tales, so be on the look out for those at some undisclosed point in the future.

**[[[SCP-3460]]] – I'm Going to Change Your Life**
//"SCP-3460's needles can be physically manipulated to align with one another. In these events, SCP-3460 will alter causality to ensure that individuals under its effects interact with one another. The delay of the onset of this interaction is variable, with interactions occurring in a range of as little as one hour, to multiple years. Once needles have been forced to align, the subjects' photos do not need to remain in SCP-3460 to ensure interaction."//

Baby's first Thaumiel.

This one came about following a desire to create a brief, object focused article. One that was a little more in line with Series I than the more narrative dense articles of the Series III and Series IV eras. While it has succeeded to a degree, its easily one of my least polished articles, with its rating standing as a testament to that fact.

That being said, the implied history of the device and June Pullman was a really nice touch, and I do think that it would be fun to include that thread in a future tale. Hell, I can see a few tales coming out of MTF agents using the device to track down fleeing Persons of Interest. Perhaps even Sasha Merlo, or Clarissa Shaw, using it to track down Vincent Anderson.

[[div class="content-panel standalone series" style="background-color: #fffff0;"]]
**[[[SCP-3860]]] – The Falcon's Landing**
//"My systems are failing. I give myself two, maybe three more years. I'm just trying to make sure that I fix as many mistakes as I can before that. I can't undo what I did to Phineas, but I can at least respect his wishes. You're not a person without compassion, Sasha. I've known you long enough to know that. Please help a dying man."//

Once upon a time I was largely against turning Vincent Anderson into an SCP object in his own right. A big draw to the character was that he wasn't anything particularly anomalous, just another magic user/cyborg who managed to stay a few steps ahead of the Foundation.

Then, everything changed when [[*user shaggydredlocks]] attacked... and convinced me to take a crack at a proper Anderson article.

In the same vein as [[[SCP-2860]]], this article is heavily character driven and shows Anderson changing as he remains in Foundation custody throughout the decades, shifting from a cocky and arrogant prisoner to a sad, lonely, and regretful shell of a man.

My intention is to use this as a spring board to a final tale series in the Anderson Robotics arc, but for now it serves as a fine capstone to a series that I have poured my heart and soul into.

[[tab Character Discussion]]

> **Author Note:** You don't have over half your contributions to the Wiki be tales without creating your fair share of characters. Like the article discussion tabs found on a lot of author pages, the goal of this section is to have a collection of info on all my characters in one place, and my thoughts on them. The list isn't exhaustive, mind you. [[[D-5111]]], [[[Peregrine|Gregg Collins]]], [[[Make Portland Weirder|Josephine Creed]]], [[[Paper Pusher|Fredrick Clayton]]], and the crew from [[[Wayfarers Hub|Wayfarers]]] and several others aren't here for numerous reasons: be their roles small, my headcanon for them underdeveloped, or my lacking of something to say about them. Anyway, onto the good stuff. Be warned, here there be spoilers.

__**Major Characters**__
[[/=]]

[[collapsible show="+ Agent Sasha Merlo" hide="- Agent Sasha Merlo"]]
------

> “Stick around Shaw,” she said with devious smile, “you’re going to see some serious shit.” ~ Sasha Merlo. [[[Hunting Anderson]]]

**Full Name:** Sasha Anne Merlo

**DOB:** 15/5/1979

**Position:** --[[[The Elusive Anderson|MTF Commander]]]-- --[[[Decisions We Make|Assistant Site Director of Task Forces]]]-- [[[Family Disclosure Protocol|Site Director]]]

**Location:** Site-64

**Physical Description:** 
* Height: 183 cm
* Weight: 76 kg 
* Eyes: Blue
* Hair: Brown

Pale skinned, and athletically built, Sasha Merlo is often casually dressed, wearing her neck length brown hair in a ponytail behind her head. While she prefers contacts, it is not uncommon to catch her wearing her brown rimmed eyeglasses while she in in her office.

**Personality:** Adaptable and laid back with a famously dry sense of humor, Sasha Merlo tends to take problems as they come. A determined leader, and a compassionate friend.

**Known Family:** Gabe Merlo (Husband), Jessie Merlo (Daughter)

> **Author Commentary:** Sasha Merlo has easily become my favorite character I've created over the years, and thus one of my most used. She originally began as a one off character at the end of [[[JTH]]], where she was invented to be the kind of agent  [[*user TwistedGears]]'s [[[Nothing Says Promotion Like A Bag Over Your Head|Agent Navarro]]] would call a friend.
> 
> It was shortly after this humble beginning that I began the second arc of the Anderson Robotics series of tales, and decided to use her as the main Foundation Protagonist, where I amped up her eccentricity a bit and began her obsession with catching Vincent Anderson. She then received a bit of background development from [[*user Kalinin]] in the tale [[[Realignment]]] where it was revealed she was a Cyber Operations Specialist before joining the Foundation. Continuing with this trend, Sasha was later given a husband and daughter in [[[No Good Deed]]] and a bit of her focus shifted from hunting down Anderson, to her climbing the Foundation leadership ladder, as well as her family life.
> 
> I could write pages about why I love Sasha Merlo as a character, but keeping things brief I find her dialogue to be extremely fun to write, and for her to be the right amount of action, thought, and heart. She can kick ass (and have her ass kicked in return), out think and out play her opponents (and be outplayed herself), and be selfless (and selfish). 10/10 would write again.

[[collapsible show="+ Site Director Edgar Holman" hide="- Site Director Edgar Holman"]]
------
> “And for the love of all that is good and holy, behave,” he added. “Or I swear I will personally be dumping your bodies into the Willamette.” ~ Edgar Holman. [[[Consolidation]]]

**Full Name:** Edgar Julian Holman

**DOB:** 03/09/1959

**Position:** Site Director

**Location:** Site-64

**Physical Description:**
* Height: 190 cm
* Weight: 90 kg 
* Eyes: Brown
* Hair: Black

Sharply dressed, with slick backed salt and pepper hair, Edgar Holman is physically a very plain man, looking more at home in a business office than at the helm of a major Foundation site.

**Personality:** Diligent and empathetic, Holman is both warm and friendly as Foundation Site Directors go, often taking great interest into the well being of his subordinates. Whether this nature is a product of the Site-64 environment and proximity to Three Portlands, or Holman himself, remains to be seen.

**Known Family:** Rita Holman (Wife, [[[All Hallows|Deceased]]]), Theodore Holman (Son), Karen Holman (Daughter-in-law), Arthur Holman (Grandson), Laura Holman (Granddaughter), Linda Holman (Daughter)

> **Author Commentary:** Director Holman is currently my longest running recurring character on the site, making his first appearance at the end of [[[Paper Pusher]]] in a slightly more villainous state than his later incarnations. For me Holman has always represented an embodiment of the an ideal boss, a kind of person who knows your strengths and weaknesses and is willing to give you enough slack to succeed, while still keeping enough control to yank things back if needed.
> 
> While its true that Holman is killed off in [[[Family Disclosure Protocol]]] I always headcanon that he retired with grace, knowing he left Site-64 in capable hands and finding peace in reconnecting with his son and grandchildren.

[[collapsible show="+ Agent Clarissa Shaw" hide="- Agent Clarissa Shaw"]]
------
> "God fucking damn it!" Shaw swore as she quickly pried the source of the pain from her body and threw it on the ground before stomping on it. Upon moving her boot, she saw the remains of a tiny silver Amur drone. As the squashed robot gave a weak wave to Shaw, the agent stomped on it again with a cry of rage. The drone's eyes went dim. Shaw then quickly ran to the edge of the roof top and looked down in time to see Anderson sprinting out of view. "I really hate that man…" ~ Clarissa Shaw. [[[The Blackbird and The Falcon]]] 

**Full Name:** Clarissa Lynn Shaw

**DOB:** 13/9/1987

**Position:** --[[[The Elusive Anderson|MTF Agent]]]-- --[[[Decisions We Make|MTF Commander]]]-- [[[Family Disclosure Protocol|Assistant Site Director of Task Forces]]]

**Location:** Site-64

**Physical Description:**
* Height: 188 cm
* Weight: 86 kg 
* Eyes: Blue
* Hair: Blonde

Tall and tan, with shoulder length blonde hair and thin rimmed glasses, Clarissa Shaw has a constant blank expression on her face. It is this latter trait that often makes her an effective interrogator, and a skilled leader of her fellow agents, appearing calm and collected in the face of emotional highs and lows.

**Personality:** Frank and intuitive, Shaw makes an effective counterpart to the more eccentric behaviors of her good friend and commander, Sasha Merlo. While her bluntness can often make her appear cold, those close to her know her to be a sincere and reliable friend.

**Known Family:** Researcher Roland Ferro (Significant Other), Dr. Lily Campbell (Significant Other)

> **Author Commentary:** Shaw came into existence during [[[The Elusive Anderson]]]'s Plot Arc, in which I wanted to portray a level headed rookie next to the more eccentric veteran that was Sasha Merlo. From there, over the course of the Anderson Robotics tale arc, she basically became Sasha's best friend and confidant, in addition to a sort of protege, climbing the SCPF ladder right on Merlo's heels. While I did have a few stand alone tales planned for the character at various points, most of the plot of those got cannibalized into different works, and thus Shaw remained a major side character, and never a main protagonist. Maybe she'll get her chance to shine in the future, but for now she's the best bestie Sasha Merlo could ask for.

> Also, she has a robotic spine. Thats cool too.

[[collapsible show="+ Researcher Jacob Conwell" hide="- Researcher Jacob Conwell"]]
------
> "My team is good, but we're not alchemists." ~ Jacob Conwell. [[[All Hallows]]]

**Full Name:** Jacob Travis Conwell

**DOB:** 11/17/1985

**Position:** Anomalous Materials Analyst 

**Location:** --[[[SCP-1260|SCPS Cassandra]]]-- --[[[SCP-1760|Site-84]]]-- --[[[Peregrine|Site-19]]]-- Site-64

**Physical Description:**
* Height: 185 cm
* Weight: 75 kg
* Eyes: Blue
* Hair: Blond

Pale, messy haired, and gangly, Conwell has a continuous appearance of sleep deprivation around him, and is never far from a mug of coffee, or his infamous radio.

**Personality:** A perfectionist at heart, Conwell has a constant fear of letting down others and as a result often places himself in spots in which he becomes over worked. Despite this flaw, he's a passionate and witty researcher.

**Known Family:** Kate Conwell (Wife), Zachary Conwell (Son), Carrie Conwell (Daughter)

> **Author Commentary:** As far as author avatars go, I feel like I did an okay job on mine. Not great mind you, but still decent.
> 
> I originally intended Conwell to be a little bit of a goofy character, someone who was so worried he was going to let people down that he became incredibly annoying. That proved difficult to translate to tales, however, and so the version of Conwell that appeared in [[[Peregrine]]] ranged from someone who was incredibly nervous to be starting his own project, to someone burnt out on said project. From there he eventually settled into a more static role of an easily exasperated researcher, but an overall content one.
> 
> Additionally, I love the fact that Conwell's introduction in any given tale is now usually accompanied by the lyrics of whatever song he is currently listening to at the time, a trait that was inspired by one of the PIs I worked for while I was an undergraduate researcher in college. Add in the fact that Conwell has a titanium wedding band (both a nod to the fact that as an anomalous materials analyst he's the kind of guy who would find that cool, and a joke on the abundance of titanium in skips), and there you have it.

[[collapsible show="+ Dr. Zachary Johnson" hide="- Dr. Zachary Johnson"]]
------
> As he placed the last of his possessions in a box, an elderly man with a walnut cane gave one last look around the room. His name was Dr. Zachary Johnson and the office he had worked in for the last 35 years was now empty, save for the furniture he had been given by the Foundation. It had been a good run while it had lasted. He had been the primary investigator on six items and had been a major contributor to at least twelve others. But alas, it was time to retire, and with a melancholy smile Dr. Johnson turned off the lights in his little sandbox and stepped out into the adjoining lab. ~ [[[Last Meetings]]]

**Full Name:** Dr. Zachary Felix Johnson

**DOB:** 12/10/1945

**Position:** Senior Researcher

**Location:** Site-19

**Physical Description:**
* Height: 167 cm
* Weight: 70 kg
* Eyes: Green
* Hair: Red

Elderly, with a neatly trimmed beard and, streaks of gray running through his fiery hair. Always equipped with a walnut cane. Were it not for severe damage to his leg, Dr. Johnson carries himself with a jovial purpose that suggests he'd twirl his cane as he strolled.
 
**Personality:** Chipper and gregarious, Dr. Johnson has always been a kind and optimistic member of the Foundation Old Guard. He often sees the best in people, even if they don't see it themselves.

**Known Family:** Shelly Johnson (Wife, Deceased), Jessica Johnson (Daughter)

> **Author Commentary:** Zachary Johnson is my attempt at making an Old Guard Foundation researcher/mentor, and as a result I poured a good chunk of my experience working with my own mentor during my time as an undergraduate in college into the character. Much like my college years (heh, sounding like an old man there), Dr. Johnson came, left his impact, and left rather quickly. He only made a few appearances before being the first character I ever killed off, dying in the experimental collaboration I did with [[*user djkaktus]], and [[*user TwistedGears]]: [[[Three Farewells]]]. I probably should do more with him, to be honest, as he is really fun character, but that is a matter for another time.

[[collapsible show="+ Vincent Anderson" hide="- Vincent Anderson"]]
------
> “Well, uh, I’m not going to kill you, if that’s what you think,” Anderson replied with a chuckle, “You guys all seem to think I’m some kind of James Bond villain when I’m just a small business owner." ~ Vincent Anderson. [[[Meeting Anderson]]]

**Full Name:** [[[SCP-3860|Vincent Robert Anderson]]]

**DOB:** 15/11/1968

**Position:** Founder and CEO of Anderson Robotics (GoI# 1115)

**Location:** Currently in captivity at Site-19

**Physical Description:**
* Height: 175 cm
* Weight: 150 kg
* Eyes: Artificial (Born Green)
* Hair: None (Born Black)

Always dressed in business attire, Anderson' s skin is ivory white and completely hairless. His head lacks ears, and is often covered by a silver comedy/tragedy mask. Various parts of his physiology have been cybernetically enhanced, including multiple limbs, his nose, and his eyes. In the years following his initial capture by the Foundation, Anderson used a [[[No Good Deed|Saker unit surrogate]]] that resembled him in his early 30's.

**Personality:** Vincent Anderson's personality is one of extremes, both generous and empathetic, as well as vindictive and cold. Known for being a master manipulator of his peers, it is hard to tell if Anderson's kindness towards others is genuine or a means to an end.

**Known Family:** Jill Herring (Ex-Wife), Erica Herring (Daughter), Adrian Anderson (Brother)

> **Author Commentary:** Ah yes, my BBEG, Vincent "I was a Saker all along" Anderson. I actually had no design for the character in mind when I first made mention of the infamous Robo-Wizard in [[[SCP-1360]]], and honestly just pictured a tinkerer working out of a garage somewhere. It was after beginning [[[The Elusive Anderson]]] I came up with the idea of making Anderson a pseudonym used by five different people to throw attention away from themselves as they made the Anderson line of robots, but that idea became quickly unworkable for me, and so the five characters there went on to become Phineas, Medea, Jason, Jeffery, and Isaac, all under the leadership of //the// Anderson.
> 
> My goal in coming up with Anderson's appearance and abilities was to describe what it might look like if a wizard made himself a lich, but instead of becoming undead, made himself a cyborg. Since a lot of the pieces in Anderson are prototypes, his unique speech pattern was attributed to a faulty part of his systems, hence why it vanishes in later installments after being repaired (also writing all those uhs and ums got old and grating.)
> 
> With such tales as [[[No Good Deed]]], I like to think I made Anderson more of a sympathetic and three dimensional villain. Someone who is capable of both the highest peaks of kindness and generosity, but who is also capable of particularly heinous acts as well. Whether or not I succeeded there is up to the reader.

* Weight: 120 kg
* Eyes: Brown
* Hair: White (Born Brown)

Bald, with nearly translucent skin, and a long white beard that contrasts his solid black clothing. If someone were to point Phineas out to you and say they were a "Robot-Wizard" you'd nod in agreement. Multiple limbs of his are cybernetically augmented, his body making a soft mechanical whirling sound when he moves.
 
**Personality:** Calm, analytical, soft-spoken, and patient. Having achieved extended longevity through his piece by piece replacement of his body with cybernetics, Phineas has slowed his way of viewing the world down, and is willing to bide his time to achieve his goals. As a former anartist and tinkerer, he's also a highly creative mind, and seeks to bring out these behaviors in those he works with at Anderson Robotics.

**Known Family:** None.

> **Author Commentary:** Phineas was one of the five characters I created back when Anderson  was still five people operating Anderson Robotics under a collective pseudonym, along with Medea, Jason, Isaac, and Jeffery. Of those five he quickly became my favorite, as I saw him as being Anderson's oldest friend, as well as the driving force behind Anderson's products and their anomalous effects. Phineas being a former anartist, I always imagined him really liking Anderson Robotics in its early stages when it was a handful of highly passionate people chasing a dream. Conversly, when the MC&D money started flowing in at the end of [[[The Elusive Anderson]]] and the company he worked for "sold out" his opinion on his company started sinking and eventually resulted in the events of Austringers. Such events were great, as it allowed me to really delve into his and Anderson's friendship and how exactly two people who poured equal parts of their heart and soul into something can end up going for each other's throats and attempting to kill each other. I'm told by a fair number of people that Phineas was their favorite member of the AR cast, and its really not hard to see why.
> 
> On an extra bonus note, in [[[Make Portland Weirder]]] a younger and much more hippie version of Phineas is the one who accidentally helps the Foundation discover Three Portlands, which I find to be both delightful, and hilarious, and a great way of showing a young version of a character that has perpetually been an old man.

>  “I work for a man named Anderson. Your uncle hired my boss to make you a very special gift, Aaron. I’m here today to give it to you." ~ Mrs. Saker. [[[Good As New]]]

**Full Name:** Anderson Robotics Saker Series Android, Unit #45

**DOB:** 12/05/2002 (Date AI Brought Online)

**Position:** Anderson Robotics Customer Liaison

**Location:** Unknown

**Physical Description:**
* Height: 168 cm
* Weight: 91 kg
* Eyes: Brown
* Hair: Gray

Grandmotherly, Mrs. Saker's bionic casing resembles a woman in her late 60's. She wears her gray hair up in a bun and is often dressed in a dark blue business suit. Her skin is rosy and she is often seen with a soft, warm smile.

**Personality:** Superficially, Mrs. Saker's personality is warm and matronly, often making potential customers of Anderson's Robotics highly comfortable through out the purchasing process. However, she is still an android, and beneath this bubbly facade is a cold and calculating machine, as shrewd as she is cunning.

**Known Family:** N/A

> **Author Commentary:** After the introduction of the Saker androids in [[[Products]]] I got the mental image of one of Anderson's salesbots taking on the facade of a polite elderly woman. As a result, Mrs. Saker made her debut in the tale [[[Good As New]]]. While most of her appearances in future tales were brief, I always pictured her being incredibly busy making things happen behind the scenes, even going as far as being Phineas's right hand in his short lived attempt to take down Anderson. Don't let her appearance fool you. She will utterly destroy you.

**Full Name:** Dr. Harold Daryl Thompson

**DOB:** 08/08/1966

**Position:** --Experimental SCP Object Cataloging Lab-- [[[SCP-2860]]]

**Location:** Site-19

**Physical Description:**
* Height: 183 cm
* Weight: 70 kg
* Eyes: Brown
* Hair: Black

Anything organic he touches turns to solid marble. Despite being a captive of the Foundation, Dr. Thompson keeps himself neatly groomed, with short hair and a trimmed beard. Originally a way to maintain a bit of control over his situation, these matters eventually became a necessity as his anomalous properties worsened. Slender, and underweight, he keeps a pair of leather gloves handy at all times to prevent his ability from effecting those around him.

**Personality:** Originally an optimist, time in Foundation containment has made Dr. Thompson severely depressed and withdrawn. Desperate to retain some contact with his former family, has also given Dr. Thompson a more aggressive streak, even enticing him to kill Foundation personnel during a containment breach. As his abilities have begun to take a toll on his own health, rendering him nearly blind and in a constant state of pain, Dr. Thompson recently developed suicidal tendencies prior to being put into a medically induced coma.

**Known Family:** Lisa Thompson (Wife), Jack Thompson (Son), Elizabeth Thompson (Daughter-in-Law)

> **Author Commentary:** Dr. Thompson is one of those situations where a character made their debut in a series of tales (in this case [[[Peregrine]]]) before crossing over to a full fledged SCP article (SCP-2860). He's also the one character I've dumped the most shit on, having his whole life torn apart by becoming an SCP object with an ability that makes him forever alone, and is slowly killing him while making him more and more useful to the Foundation. I should probably do more with him, to be honest, but knowing the current trend it would only end in more tragedy, and the poor man has already had enough.

**Full Name:** Gabriel Michael Merlo

**DOB:** 21/11/1982

**Position:** Head Accountant

**Location:** Site-64

**Physical Description:**
* Height: 177 cm
* Weight: 75 kg
* Eyes: Blue
* Hair: Black

Bespectacled and with a face covered by an ever present stubble, Gabe Merlo looks exactly like what you might expect to find when told he is the "Head Accountant of Site-64". Unless absolutely necessary, Gabe is usually casually dressed, with relaxed smile on his face.

**Personality:** Calm, humorous, and relaxed, Gabe Merlo is a very "Go-with-the-flow" person, with few ever seeing him angry or even annoyed. Despite this, he runs a tight ship in his corner of the Site-64 administration, and holds high standards for those he works with.

**Known Family:** Sasha Merlo (Wife), Jessie Merlo (Daughter)

> **Author Commentary:** Gabe's one of the newer characters on my roster, having only made appearances in my tales posted from January 2017 onward, with his debut in [[[No Good Deed]]]. Much like his wife, who originated from the question "what kind of person would Agent Navarro pal around with," Gabe got his start from the question "what kind of person, if any, would Sasha Merlo have a long term relationship with?"
> 
> Gabe is definitely the most laid back character I have written to date. While not exactly "The Dude," he is definitely slow to lose his cool. Part of the reason for this is that I felt its the kind of person Sasha might gravitate towards with how high stress her job is, and also because the idea of someone in a rather strict administrative position who is just chilled out all the time was hilarious.
> 
> Some might consider me giving Sasha Merlo a husband and daughter to be the character's "jumping the shark" moment, as before that there was not any indication she even had a family. Writing scenes between Sasha and Gabe brings me a lot of joy, though, so if "jumping the shark" is the price to pay, so be it.

**Full Name:** Roland Michael Ferro

**DOB:** 21/10/1985

**Position:** Senior Researcher

**Location:** Site-64

**Physical Description:**
* Height: 182 cm
* Weight: 105 kg
* Eyes: Hazel
* Hair: Black

Tall, bulky, and clean shaven, Roland Ferro almost is always in his Foundation issue lab coat, be it in staff dormitories, the cafeteria, or in the administrative offices. Said coat often rattles as he moves due to the sheer surplus of pens he keeps in the pockets.

**Personality:** Roland Ferro prefers to fly under the radar, preferring to focus on his work rather than seeking acclaim or a promotion. Because of this low key nature, others typically find him an easy friend and a good colleague for group projects.

**Known Family:** Clarissa Shaw (Significant Other)

> **Author Commentary:** Roland is a character I include on this list, not because of the impact he's made in my writing, but because of how many times he appears in the background of my works. As of right now, he's only made appearances in the documentation for [[[SCP-2106]]], [[[SCP-3060]]], and [[[SCP-3960]]], and is mentioned in a few tales as the off-again-on-again boyfriend of Agent Shaw. I always imagine him as that one researcher at Site-64 people don't mind running ideas past since he's a good sounding board and has no ambition to snipe another person's project from them. I am hoping to have him make more waves in the Conwellverse in the future, but for the time being having a recurring name on the Site-64 SCP articles is not the worst home for good ol' Roland.

> “Hello Daniel,” he said. “It sure has been a while hasn’t it? I don’t think there is anyone else on this planet you’ve screwed over more than me and my friends.” ~ Jericho T. Hill. [[[JTH]]]

**Full Name:** Jericho Tyler Hill

**DOB:** 12/12/1975

**Position:** Former Businessman/Art Patron.

**Location:** Currently in captivity at Site-19

**Physical Description:**
* Height: 175 cm
* Weight: 90 kg
* Eyes: Green
* Hair: Blond

With short blond hair, a clean shaven face, a nice suit, and a leather glove on his right hand, Jericho still dresses the part of an art (and anart) patron despite going underground following the death of his wife and brother at the hands of the Foundation. He often appears exhausted, with dark rings around his eyes. 
 
**Personality:** Prior to the death of his wife and brother, Jericho Hill was a kind and generous man who sought to bring out the creativity in others through donations to artists from his successful businesses in Portland, OR. After their death, however, Jericho has become a man drained of energy and emotion. With a single goal of destroying Agent Navarro, he has been completely consumed by this obsession, freely killing those whom he feels will impact Agent Navarro the most.

**Known Family:** Tanya Hill (Wife, Deceased), Eric Hill (Brother, Deceased)

> **Author Commentary:** It wasn't long after reading about [[*user TwistedGears]]'s character Agent Daniel Navarro that I wanted to write a tale series about the character. The idea of an anartist turning into a Foundation agent and helping them contain the work of other anartists fascinated me, and I pictured that such a change of heart would net Agent Navarro a lot of former friends turning enemy along the way. In steps Jericho T. Hill.
> 
> As an antagonist, I really like Jericho. The raw hatred he has in his motivation to destroy Agent Navarro is very fun to include in his dialogue with the latter. On top of that, the leather glove on his right hand giving him the power to control metal like Magneto was fun to include in [[[Burnt Bridges]]] many, many fight scenes. 
> 
> Technically he's still alive and ticking at Site-19, minus a hand, so he very well may make more appearances in the future, should he find a way to escape.

**Full Name:** Jill Katherine Herring

**DOB:** 14/06/1976

**Position:** Graphic Designer, Known Anartist

**Location:** Portland, Oregon

**Physical Description:**
* Height: 191 cm
* Weight: 95 kg
* Eyes: Brown
* Hair: Black

Tall, pale, with short black hair. Jill Herring has an air of pride around here wherever she goes. While her work as a graphic designer often has her in business attire, in her spare time she dresses in a manner more appropriate for the anartists her and her husband are.
 
**Personality:** Between being abandoned by her first husband, Vincent Anderson, to finding out one of her best friends had become a Foundation agents, Jill has become a ball of anger over the years, and rightfully distrusting of others. She prefers a quiet life with her husband and daughter, painting anomalous paintings that move in her free time.

**Known Family:** Tom Herring (Husband), Erica Herring (Daughter), Vincent Anderson (Ex-Husband)

> **Author Commentary:** Much like Jericho, Jill was a character created to illustrate the kinds of bridges Navarro burnt in becoming a Foundation agent. However, unlike Jericho who falls into the category of angry, Jill falls into the category of betrayed. This is far from a new emotion for Jill, as it turns out, for in the tale [[[No Good Deed]]] its learned that before she married Tom Herring she was the wife of Vincent Anderson, until he abandoned her and their daughter to create Anderson Robotics.
> 
> I like Jill a lot, as I feel she does a good job demonstrating what a day to day anartist might look like. Someone who generally flies under the radar or has a minor touch-and-go relationship with a Foundation contact. While she is quick to anger (she basically bites off both Anderson's and Navarro's heads in the tales she appears in) I feel that anger is highly justified considering how both those individuals have screwed her over.
> 
> On an additional fun note, it is frequently hinted at in many tales and stated in [[[SCP-2960]]] proper that Jill was the Studio Art teacher at the high school SCP-2960 takes place at. Small world.

**Full Name:** Dr.  Medea Alayla Contos

**DOB:** Unknown. Presumed to be 11/07/1969

**Position:** Co-Head of Research and Development: Anderson Robotics

**Location:** Unknown

**Physical Description:**
* Height: 155 cm
* Weight: 65 kg
* Eyes: Blue
* Hair: Brown

Short, with shoulder length hair, Medea always has a smile on her face. As the main leader of Anderson Robotic's R&D department she's typically seen in her lab gear, though her wardrobe in social situations consists of an ever shifting variety of dresses.

**Personality:** Medea is a kind, motherly person with a bubbly voice and a soothing warmth about her. She considers her colleagues in Anderson Robotics to be her family, including the androids she works with on a regular basis. Few in this world will meet a gentler soul.

**Known Family:** Jason Contos (Adopted Son)

> **Author Commentary:** Like Phineas, Medea came about during the phase when Anderson Robotics was to be lead by a council of five people using the Anderson name as a pseudonym. Medea was to be the primary mover and shaker of the group, having the most expertise in robotics due to her doctorate she received from Alexylva before she, for reasons still unknown, hopped over to our universe. While she is still an Alexylva grad who hopped over, Vincent Anderson's character eventually took on her role as the leader of AR, and she became the companies Co-Head of R&D. This technically makes her third in command after Phineas and Vincent, as is revealed at the end of [[[Bal-Chatri]]].
> 
> I always considered her to be the AR teams equivalent to Kaylee from Firefly. She is just this constant fountain of positive vibes to those around her, and makes working in Anderson's R&D department a treat for those employed there.

**Full Name:** Jason Anthony Contos

**DOB:** 14/2/1990

**Position:** Co-Head of Research and Development: Anderson Robotics

**Location:** Deceased

**Physical Description:**
* Height: 190 cm
* Weight: 165 kg
* Eyes: Blue
* Hair: Blond

Tall and lanky, Jason Contos wears thick glasses over his eyes. A thick mop of curly blond hair covers his head. As the youngest member on the Anderson Robotics board of directors, he dresses more like he's working at a start up out of his garage than a multi-million dollar paratech company.

**Personality:** A child prodigy in computer sciences, Jason has always recognized his own talents and as a result tends to be snarky and sarcastic to those around him. However, despite this sassy outer shell, underneath is a man who is a coward and easily intimidated. For this reason, Jason can usually be bullied into going along with Anderson Robotics more ethically questionable products, like [[[SCP-2306]]].

**Known Family:** Dr. Medea Contos (Adoptive Mother)

> **Author Commentary:** Same as Medea, Jason got his start in AR before the character of Vincent Anderson was hammered out and made the official leader of the company. As the Co-Head of R&D, I always imagined him as someone Medea groomed from a young age to be an absolute wizard at all things computers and robots. This has gone to his head a little, and as a result he can be an absolutely insufferable punk at times. I like to think that he redeems himself a little, however, at the end of [[[The Blackbird and The Falcon]]], where he sacrifices himself for his employees. Proof that even the most cowardly of people can be pushed to brave (or stupid) things.

**Position:** Head of Advanced Logic Division: Anderson Robotics

**Location:** Currently in captivity at Site-64

**Physical Description:**
* Height: 175 cm
* Weight: 85 kg
* Eyes: Brown
* Hair: Black

Dark skinned, portly, and with a face forever pressed into a look of worry, Dr. Wilson has not aged well over his years working for Prometheus Labs and Anderson Robotics. Where he walks, he does so slowly, as if carrying a great weight on his shoulders.
 
**Personality:** Dr. Jeffery Wilson is not a happy man, seemingly to be both incredibly anxious and incredibly tired at the same time. He's usually silent during the Anderson Robotics board meetings, preferring to keep a low profile and ride things out as people like Vincent, Phineas, and Isaac make things happen.

**Known Family:** Miles Wilson (Son, Deceased)
 
> **Author Commentary:** Always a tragic character, Dr. Wilson is another one that came about during the Pre-Anderson days of Anderson. A former PL employee who jumped ship to Anderson after the former imploded, Wilson was the main reason the Peregrine and Saker units became a thing, the original Saker prototype being a stand in for his deceased son, Miles.
> 
> While Wilson doesn't get a whole lot of screen time in the various AR tales, I always considered him a character who was about quality more than quantity. His final scene in [[[The Blackbird and The Falcon]]] I feel is one of the most emotional I've written to date, with sheer exhaustion and sadness of the character firing at all cylinders.

**Location:** Unknown

**Physical Description:**
* Height: 190 cm
* Weight: 220 kg
* Eyes: Hazel
* Hair: Black

Tall, muscular, and always sharply dressed, Issac looks like a businessman among businessmen, looking to be at home in as places as diverse as Wall Street to a MC&D clubhouse. He keeps his hair combed back, and usually has a strong smell of cologne following him.
 
**Personality:** Shrewd, calculating, and sleazy, Isaac is an effective businessman and easily the most business savvy member of the Anderson Robotics board. Silver tongued, he always seems to know just what to say to make sure things go his way. His loyalty is fair weather at best, however, and he is fast to turn on any employer as soon as things begin to go south.

**Known Family:** David Boyko (Significant Other, Deceased)

> **Author Commentary:** Awwww man, words cannot describe how much I love to despise Isaac Dillard. Designed to be the sleaziest of sleazy businessmen, every scene he's in just ends up feeling slimier for his presence. Still he's effective at what he does, and its unlikely the Anderson Robotics/MC&D distribution deal would have gotten off the ground without him whispering into Vincent Anderson's ear.
