**Name:** Jacob “JC” Conwell

**Personnel Classification:** B

**Security Clearance Level:** 2

**Current Assignment:** Currently assisting Dr. Johnson with SCP-1360-1 collection and research. 

**Position:** Researcher

**Location:** Site-19 

**History:** Following recruitment, Researcher Conwell has been removed from research positions aboard the SCPS //Cassandra// and at Site-84 at the requests of Dr. █████ and Researcher ███████ respectively. In both cases research staff cited that the request was due to Researcher Conwell’s “long windedness, constant need for feedback and overly meticulous nature.”

**Profile:** Always hard working, Researcher Conwell has been willing to do any task set before him with a smile on his face, though his constant need for feedback often results in his constant asking of the question, “How am I doing?” This has annoyed several of Conwell’s peers to the point of avoidance. 

**Note:** //Yes, Conwell. You are doing a good job. You have always done a good job, and for the foreseeable future you will continue to do a good job.// -Dr. Zachary Johnson
