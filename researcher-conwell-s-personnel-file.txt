**Full Name:** Jacob “JC” Conwell

**Personnel Classification:** B

**Security Clearance:** 2 

**Current Assignment:** Currently head of SCP-1360-1 collection and research, following the retirement of Dr. Johnson.

**Position:** Researcher

**Location:** Site-19 

**History:** Following recruitment, Researcher Conwell has been removed from research positions aboard the SCPS //Cassandra// and at Site-84 at the requests of Dr. █████ and Researcher ███████ respectively. In both cases research staff cited that the request was due to Researcher Conwell’s “long windedness, constant need for feedback and overly meticulous nature.”

**Profile:** Always hard working, Researcher Conwell has been willing to do any task set before him with a smile on his face, though his constant need for feedback often results in his constant asking of the question, “How am I doing?” This has annoyed several of Conwell’s peers to the point of avoidance.
