Researcher Chevrolet leaned back in his office chair and started to scroll through his phone messages. It had been a long day, though every day had been a long day since the start of the anomaly. Ever since the tail-end of July and the start of August, tiny books authored under the name “Elogee FishTruck” had appeared spontaneously across various Foundation Sites. Seeing as Chevrolet’s full name was Elijah Marlin Chevrolet, and the various tiny books contained information that was classified to most Foundation workers, he was put under heavy suspicion. The only problem with this suspicion was that Chevrolet never wrote or remembered writing any books.

Many attempts were made by Foundation staff to stop the anomaly. They tried putting Chevrolet into quarantine, the books kept appearing. They had Chevrolet not do any work for a month, the books kept appearing. So, they decided to put him in charge of researching the anomaly and dumped any books they found into his office. Needless to say, his office became a library soon enough.

Chevrolet was extremely frustrated at this. Not only was he the center of attention for an anomaly he wasn’t responsible for, but there was also little way of knowing how the anomaly was happening. There seemed to be no pattern for the books; some were about weird Moon people, others were about SCP breaches that never happened. If he found whoever caused this, there’d be some physical conflict.

Today, a shipment of over 20 books came to his office. Most were bound to be burned. As Chevrolet went through his texts, he saw something on his desk out of the corner of his eye. It was a book, one he hadn’t remembered placing there. It read “Elijah Marlin Chevrolet, By the Book” in bold letters on the front.

“Fuck,” said Chevrolet aloud. This was gonna be a //fun// one. He flipped the cover over and started reading the text. It was a perfect description of the situation he was in, along with a description of him in his chair, reading his texts, finding the book, and reading it.

“Fuuuuuuuuck,” groaned Chevrolet. He wrote a note on his phone.

“New book, about me, either tells the future, is a meme, or controls reality around it. In any case, I hate myself,” the note read. Chevrolet kept reading the book. In it, he found several of the documented “tales” with “Author’s Commentary” on it. He went through the list:

> [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/two-lost-souls Two Lost Souls]: When I first read [[[SCP-1233|Moon Champion]]], I knew someone had to write a tale about him. And that person was me! Specifically, I wrote a crossover between Moon Champion and [[[SCP-1959|The Lost Cosmonaut]]] because why wouldn’t they. So far, it’s the most upvoted tale of my Moon Champion series, and it used to look a lot different before I touched it up to make it more format-friendly. I like it, especially since it’s the first thing of mine on the site that survived. I took heavy inspiration from [http://www.scp-wiki.net/ground-control Ground Control], which is a tale you should read.
> ----
> [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/i-dreamed-a-dream I Dreamed a Dream]: I actually wasn’t initially planning a sequel to Two Lost Souls when I wrote it. I think the idea came to me some time afterward that I should expand it, but I knew I needed to do some research for lunar anomalies. I found [[[SCP-852|SCP-852]]], [[[SCP-2686|SCP-2686]]], [http://www.scp-wiki.net/secure-facility-dossier-lunar-area-32 Lunar Area-32], and [[[SCP-2821|SCP-2821]]] which’ll be discussed in the next tale. So, I planned out this tale and the last tale and wrote them out. It was fun trying to make Moon Lore, and I’m happy with the result.
> ----
> [http://www.scp-wiki.net/waiting-in-the-sky Waiting in the Sky]: I knew I wanted to use SCP-2821, but I just couldn’t wrap my head around it a first. Eventually, I found the Pattern Screamer Explanation on r/SCPDeclassified, and that had an interesting explanation for SCP-2821, where it’s a pattern screamer gaining physical form. I sort of morphed the thing into an eldritch villain, though one with [https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality Blue-and-Orange Morality], and I’m not sure if that’s what [[*user 9Volt]] intended but I think it’s OK. I’m extremely happy that I got [[*user CadaverCommander]]’s blessing, that honestly means a lot, and now that the tales are on the actual SCP-1233 page it’s even more of a blessing. Thank you, Commander.

> [http://www.scp-wiki.net/tension-and-release Tension and Release]: I’m extremely happy with the reception it has gotten. The idea, [[[SCP-2006|SCP-2006]]] on Halloween, isn’t exactly an original one, and there are a couple other tales released for the Halloween Contest involving SCP-2006, but I think the way I used SCP-2006 made it the most successful of the SCP-2006 Halloween tales. I realize that’s an extremely niche thing, but I’m claiming that role. This took inspiration from [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/treats Treats] and [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-meaning-of-fear The Meaning of Fear]. Some say my tale has an anticlimax, and I’d agree, though that’s sort of the point. I may write a sequel tale sometime, but I’m not sure.

> [http://www.scp-wiki.net/do-they-know-it-s-christmas-time-at-all Do They Know It's Christmas Time At All?]: My lengthiest tale thus far and by far the happiest. I wanted to conjoin [http://www.scp-wiki.net/adventures-in-capitalism-hub Adventures in Capitalism] and [http://www.scp-wiki.net/wonder-world Wonderful World], but it seemed like an impossible task UNTIL I remembered [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-real-adventures-in-capitalism The Real Adventures in Capitalism] was a thing. From there, it all fell into my lap for the taking. This is my first Wondertainment, Oneiroi, and Factory tale, which I don't think has been done before in that specific arrangement, so go me! Hell, I may end up doing more Oneiroi stuff in the future, that was super fun. Shoutouts to [[*user DarkStuff]], who created the Wonderful World canon and is a cool dude altogether.

> [http://www.scp-wiki.net/over-my-doberman Over My Doberman]: My tale for the 2018 Art-Exchange, specifically a tale for [[*user DrAnnoyingDog]]. I knew my deadline, and I actually started on it a ways before the deadline. The more I wrote it, though, the more I felt it just wasn't right. So, I scrapped it entirely two days before the deadline. Then I scrapped that draft entirely a day before the deadline. Truth be told, I probably had a good few hours to write it, but the inspiration hit me hard to write the tale from the //dog's// perspective. The finished product, while it has no critique to it's name, is one that DrAnnoyingDog did say he loved, so that's all good with me. Read [http://www.scp-wiki.net/critter-profile-sampson Critter Profile: Sampson!] and any other article I linked in the tale, WWS is a great GoI!
> ----
> [http://www.scp-wiki.net/fifthdation Fifthdation]: Currently my most upvoted tale. I had a multitude of ideas for ClicheCon, all of which I just couldn't bring myself to write. I knew I wanted to do something that directly affected the Foundation at large, but I didn't know what I would do. Then I got into sort of a Fifthism kick, and I've always wanted to write a Fifthist tale, especially one featuring Anafabula, which has become my headcanon enemy of the Cosmic Starfish ever since I read [http://www.scp-wiki.net/why-is-five-afraid-of-seven Why is Five Afraid of Seven?], so the rest of the tale grew from there. Thanks to [[*user SecretCrow]] who convinced me to go into depth about the life of civilians and to make it five sections. It's currently the highest voted tale for ClicheCon, not including the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/foundation-internal-examinations-division-casefile-yykp-oyzz Internal Examinations] thing (which is also pretty good), so I'm proud of that.
> ----
> [http://www.scp-wiki.net/i-ll-remember-you I'll Remember You]: Nobody is a weird GoI, because he's literally whatever the fuck you want him to be. So, with the lack of identity associated with Nobody, I decided that I'll give him NO IDENTITY. This, of course, relates to be forgotten, which relates to SCP-4999, which is how I made that connection. I may have actually made that connection back backwards, but whatever. Anyways, I decided to make it a simple tale, no grand adventure or world-ending monstrosity. Just how it feels to be forgotten, and who will actually remember. I'm glad at the reception it has received.

> [[[SCP-1927-EX]]] - Farnsworth Effect: "Wow, Elogee made a skip?" I know, I know, it's shocking, but it's actually a co-authored piece with [[*user Roget]], known as the writer for, like, all the things. I have a lot to thank Roget for; without him, honestly, I'm not sure where I'd be today, but that's another story. Roget came up to me with a bunch of skip ideas (he keeps an actual written list) and this was the one I found most appealing, so I wrote it. Well, I wrote the prose-y bit whereas Roget did the code and the article itself, but it was a collaborative effort. In the end, I'm glad that I've finally managed to make a skip that //didn't// suck, and Roget is a great person. Also, this was part of a skip-competition with [[*user Weryllium]], which Wery won, but in the end we both proved ourselves capable of so much.

> Extra Notes: I created the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/system:page-tags/tag/ruiz-duchamp#pages Ruiz Duchamp tag], the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/system:page-tags/tag/moon-champion#pages Moon Champion tag], and I also wrote a declassification for r/SCPDeclassified on [[[SCP-4006]]], which you can find [https://www.reddit.com/r/SCPDeclassified/comments/acwlay/scp4006_massatruthetts/ here], and a declass on [http://www.scp-wiki.net/dr-gears-s-proposal Dr Gears' 001 Proposal], which you can find [https://www.reddit.com/r/SCPDeclassified/comments/apg9mv/scp001_dr_gears_proposal_the_prototype/? here]. Plus, I'm JS on the Licensing Team, so if you have a question about licensing, please do ask me them.

Chevrolet put the book down. At least he got some insight into the author’s thought process. Still didn’t explain who FishTruck was or why it did what it did. It had accessibility with the whole of the Foundation Database, it had some place for explanations of certain skips, and it wrote their tales for the sake of writing tales. None of this made sense. Then Chevrolet looked at the back.

> __About the Author__:
> 
> Hi! I’m Elogee FishTruck, and I seek to be the best author I can be for the site. Although I do have some ideas for skips, I mainly focus on tales which are really fun to write. I love making lore and creating explanations for my favorite site tales and articles, and I plan to make many more in the future. Have a good day, and I hope you like my work!

“Goddamn pataphysical bullshit,” screamed Chevrolet before sinking his head in his hands. This was way above his pay grade. There was one final note, a picture, on the back cover.

[[collapsible show="+ Chapter II" hide="- I Like Ike"]]
Chevrolet jumped out of his bed, scrambling for his dream journal. He had kept a dream journal for a couple of weeks, hoping to find something, anything, relating to the anomaly that consumed his life. For those couple of weeks, Chevrolet had no luck in attaining anything useful to understanding the entity that plagued him. But that night, that dream, the plague had come to him. Chevrolet grabbed a pen and hastily wrote notes in his journal.

He remembered it vividly as he wrote it down. He found himself in the middle of space, somehow bound to sitting on a black park bench. Surrounding him were numerous other black park benches, floating in space, illuminated by a distant sun. However, he was the only person present, all other benches empty. He turned to his left, then to his right, and when he looked to his left again Dwight D. Eisenhower had taken a seat on his bench.

Of course, one couldn’t be sure if it was Dwight D. Eisenhower, and in this instance it certainly wasn’t, but the entity looked exactly like the long-dead president. Chevrolet jumped a little in his seat, though leaned forward afterward out of fear of falling into the abyss. He stared at Eisenhower for a long time, the old man simply smiling back. Not a menacing or creepy smile, simply a warm, pleasant smile. Eventually, Chevrolet initiated conversion.

“Who are you?” asked Chevrolet, though he had an idea as to who it was.

Eisenhower responded in a teenage voice, “You know who I am.”

“I mean, I really don’t. I have ideas, but no absolutes.”

“There are no absolutes, Chevrolet. You, of all people, should know that. After all, I created you that way.”

“Fuck, it’s you. You know how much unnecessary trouble you have caused me, you bastard? And I saw what you did with that fucking picture; you’re taunting me. Why the fuck are you taunting me? What can you do that gives you the privilege to taunt me?”

“Oh come on, lighten up. I’m just messing with you, and it’s really just books. I mean, if I was mean, I could end the world right now and we’d all be dead. I have a lot more privilege than you think, son.”

“But why? They’re a rodent’s hair away from giving me SCP classification because of you. The only reason they keep me around is because I’m still a semi-valuable doctor, a-”.

FishTruck interrupted, “No, the reason they keep you around is because I allow you to. Or maybe not. How do you really know I’m god? All you have is a bunch of books, an About the Author tab that “supposedly” confirms I’m pataphysical, and this dream, which may just be your subconscious messing with you. But let’s use the god perspective, I want to change you.”

“Change me?” Chevrolet questioned. “If you’re god, you can change me any which way you want!”

“I could, but that wouldn’t be good writing, now would it? In your time at the Foundation, you’ve noticed how some of your colleagues just seem...off. That’s because there was no effort put into them, no realistic character development. You’ve probably seen a lot more, but you wouldn’t remember because they’re //deleted//. People don’t like a fire-breathing Mary Sue roaming the halls of Site-19.”

“Who the hell is Mary Sue?”

“Author lingo. Anyways, a character must develop naturally; they have to have a good arc, a good //story//. Now, every person, fake or real, is a character, meaning they deserve a good story. I’m gonna give that to you.”

“And how, by tormenting me?”

“Chevrolet, you don’t understand the hero’s journey. Every character undergoes struggle, but they will achieve a resolution. You must discover what that resolution is yourself.”

Chevrolet blinked, and FishTruck and all the benches were gone. He fell down and down into the cosmos, waiting for something to fall onto. Eventually, a tiny spec came into view, and the spec became larger and larger before taking a blue hue. A specle of green came into view, and Chevrolet plummeted into the green, into his apartment building, and into his apartment. That’s when he woke up.

As he wrote his dream down, he hadn’t actually checked to see if it was a real experience or not. He looked toward his window and, not seeing any structural damage, resumed writing. Once he was finished, he crashed back into his bed. It was true that it could’ve just been his subconscious making up things, and perhaps FishTruck wasn’t even a god. But, as he processed it more, he came to the conclusion that yes, FishTruck was trying to say something. Whether Chevrolet would ever achieve the coveted resolution was unknown, but for some reason he trusted FishTruck, if only for finally giving him clues as to who he was.

Chevrolet got up and looked back at the window. This time, he noticed a pamphlet on the windowsill. He stood up and walked over to read it. As he expected, it was indeed a recap of his dream and the events leading up to this moment. There was one picture in between the two pages of the pamphlet, with writing on the bottom.

For once in Chevrolet’s life, he felt happy to receive a book.

Elijah Marlin Chevrolet stared at the long abandoned [http://www.scp-wiki.net/rounderhouse-s-author-page cylindrical settlement] in front of him. It was composed of wood, a red dome covering the top, the jungle surrounding it containing an unnatural number of sloths. Elogee had given Chevrolet numerous instructions in order to find this settlement, including traversing numerous crocodile infested rivers and too many games to count of tic-tac-toe. It was all in the effort of supposedly "furthering his arc along", whatever that meant. Chevrolet had no choice but to trust him; there was no point in disobeying God unless it was integral to the story, which it wasn't. Still, Chevrolet felt an aura of dread emanating from the spherical abode which in any other circumstance would drive Chevrolet off. On he went into the front door, which was the only door.

Only darkness filled the circular domicile for a while, simultaneously calming and scaring Chevrolet, before the room suddenly brightened with many **click** sounds to reveal it was much larger on the inside. The interior resembled a massive warehouse, massive cardboard boxes filling long metal shelves and lights not unlike those of a supermarket illuminating the structure from the top. Somehow, one could still tell they were within an orbicular homestead. An odd silence followed the lighting before a booming voice literally blew Chevrolet back.

"//WHO DARES ENTER THE SUPREME SCP AUTHOR'S ESTABLISHMENT//?" proclaimed the voice, upon closer inspection sounding like a teenage boy.

"Listen, buddy, stop thinking you're special. I, too, am a self-insert, and I got God on my side," responded Elogee. The elliptical structure shook violently, knocking over many of the boxes on the shelves onto the ground.

"//YOU, PATHETIC MORTAL, THINK YOU CAN DEFEAT ME WITH YOUR WEIRD EISENHOWER-OBSESSED GOD FRIEND? I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW I'M RANKED #175 ON [http://www.scpper.com/user/4187885 SCPPER]//!" One of the boxes busted open, revealing a massive sloth creature dressed in a suit within. "//RELEASE THE [[[SCP-4149|XORKANOFF]]]//!"

Chevrolet stared as the sloth started to move...slowly...veeery slowly. At this rate, the sloth would reach him in about 15 minutes from where he stood, which was about 10 meters away. 

"//WHAT THE FUCK? XORKANOFF, QUIT FUCKING AROUND AND DESTROY HIM//!"

The sloth came to a gradual stop, mouthing out what would've been, in 2 minutes, the full sentence "Sorry, sir, I'm quite slow as you know." The sloth was shot in the head before it could finish the first syllable.

"Alright...uh...//BE AFRAID, FUCKHEAD, FOR HERE COMES THE [[[SCP-4549|HIPPY MOB]]]//!" Another box dropped, a mob of floral-dressed granola girls and new-age retro goers angrily waving signs and rushing toward Chevrolet. He quickly ran to one of the shelves, ascending the layers until reaching the top. Down below, the group booed and yelled catchphrases such as "You can't escape the yurt, pig!" and "My degree in pataphysical studies is coming into good use!" The stress of his current situation made Chevrolet sit in a ball and rock back and forth, wondering what to do. The answer hit him in the head, in the form of a picture folded into a paper airplane. He unfolded the plane. 

[[include component:image-block name=sad_dwight_d.jpg|align=center|caption=Knock down one of the boxes, idiot.]]

Talk about natural character progression. Chevrolet went behind the box next to him and pushed hard until it plummeted to the bottom, squishing some of the hippies while dispersing the others. Inside was a [[[SCP-4511|metal pig]]], for some reason, now broken to pieces by the fall.

"Swine God? SWINE GOD?! //YOU KILLED FUCKING SWINE GOD//?!?!" The voice turned to indescribable shrieks, then to a loud sob. Chevrolet could sense where the sob was coming from, and headed in that direction. At the edge of the oval residence, a teenager cried into a microphone at his computer. Chevrolet put his hand on the boy's shoulder, and he turned around.

"[http://www.scp-wiki.net/dr-arvind-desais-personnel-file Arvind]?" gasped Chevrolet. The man at the computer turned back around, slamming his head into the keyboard multiple times, leaving his glasses ruined and his brain severely injured. "Oh shit, dude. I'm gonna call 911." Chevrolet left to get his phone, while the man quietly murmured to himself.

"Rounder all the way downder, rounder all the way downder."
