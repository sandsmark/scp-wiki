**Item #:** SCP-2392

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The camping zone situated within SCP-2392 is to be maintained by Foundation personnel under the guise of government maintenance workers. SCP-2392 is to be fenced off under the guise of major roadworks during testing. No further containment measures are required due to SCP-2392's anomalous properties.

**Description:** SCP-2392 is a small, irregularly-shaped region of land approximately 600 square metres in size. SCP-2392 encompasses the entirety of a camping zone parallel to the ██████ Highway of Australia; this camping zone is obscured from view of the road by thick shrubbery.

Sapient individuals within this area report feelings of unease or dread which becomes increasingly prominent the longer such individuals are present; individuals will typically attempt to leave SCP-2392 and avoid it in future, however such actions are typical reactions to similar situations. Non-sapient animals exhibit signs of similar anomalous deterrence.

Several environmental factors within SCP-2392 are affected by increased rates of entropy; due to this, the region within SCP-2392 is on average 1 degree Celsius lower than the surrounding environment, light sources within or viewed from within SCP-2392 suffer from a reduction of 9 to 13 lumens, audio suffers from a 4 decibel reduction and electronic devices present within SCP-2392 utilise 11% more power than usual. The significance of these values is currently unknown.

No native flora or fauna is present within SCP-2392. Plants situated within SCP-2392's area of effect are incapable of sustaining their own biological functions and will die within 3 to 4 days. Investigation into which biological functions are hindered is currently underway.

**Addendum 1:** Description of SCP-2392 by test subject.
> 
> **D-2394:** Its like, just a vibe about that place y'know? I dunno what happened there, but I can just... I ain't religious or nothin' but it feels like a spiritual warning or something. As if something big happened there an' it was bad, so the place itself is like, warding people off so it doesn't happen again. Was... was somebody murdered there or something?

**Addendum 2:**
Researchers assigned to SCP-2392 have recently uncovered muffled audio comparable to sounds of distress emanating from an indeterminate distance underground at the approximate geographic centre of SCP-2392. Investigations are ongoing.
