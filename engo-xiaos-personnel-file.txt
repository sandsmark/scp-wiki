**Name:** Engineering Officer S. Xiao, CSWA, CD, ProfEng, B. Tech
[!--
For those reading the source code, the designation Professional Engineer is a PROTECTED designation under the Professional Engineer's Act in Ontario, and its unlawful usage does carry stiff penalties. Hence, I did modify the postnominal and included this blurb to enforce that I am not a licensed professional engineer, and I cannot provide professional advice nor verify engineering-related calculations or drawings.
