**Item #:** SCP-1397

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1397-1 through -5 are contained in a standard Safe-class containment safe at Site-91. Copies of the text of all instances of SCP-1397 are available and may be accessed by any researcher of Level 1 clearance or above. Experimentation involving any instance of SCP-1397 requires Level 3 approval. Personnel reporting drowsiness or fatigue are not to be allowed within ten (10) meters of SCP-1397's containment safe.

As of ██/██/200█, the immediate relatives of all former members of the Czech surrealist group "Objektiv" are to be investigated and interviewed to determine whether any further copies of SCP-1397 exist.  

**Description:** SCP-1397-1 through -5 are a set of five travel guides written in Czech that describe locations in the rural Czech Republic and Slovakia. The author of the five books is listed as one █████ ███████; however, linguistic analysis of the text has indicated that each book was written by a different author. As no evidence of a █████ ███████ has been located, the name is most likely a pseudonym. While there is no copyright page or publisher information listed, the information within the books suggests that they were written in the early 1950's.

The anomalous effects of SCP-1397 manifest when a human subject falls asleep or otherwise becomes unconscious within 5 meters of an instance of SCP-1397. Subjects report finding themselves awake and standing in a location described in their particular instance of SCP-1397 upon entering the unconscious state. Subjects' reports of their experiences differ, except for the presence of unrealistic or "dream-like" events. Despite this, subjects insist that their experiences were "real." 

Over time, the incidence of these "dream-like" events increases. ██% of subjects awake naturally during this phase. Subjects may also be awoken through normal means, with the same results. The █% of subjects who do not awake after a period of 12 hours will cease all vital signs after being unconscious for a period of time ranging from 13 hours to 24 hours.

Subjects who awake after having experienced SCP-1397's effects are confused and hostile. Subjects become nervous and upset when questioned about the reality of the perceived events. In addition, subjects express the belief that all of their dreams are in fact real events, accompanied with a fear of said dreams. Aside from these psychological effects, all anomalous properties of SCP-1397 cease upon the subject's awakening.

A short message has been written in pen on the title pages of SCP-1397-2 through -5 (See Addendum 1397-C). Handwriting analysis suggests that all four messages were written by the same individual.

**Addendum 1397-A: Interview 1397-1**

> **Interviewed:** A██████ H████, former owner of SCP-1397-1.
>  
> **Interviewer:** Agent J████
>  
> **Foreword:** SCP-1397-1 was recovered in 195█ from Mr. H████'s briefcase after a Foundation investigation into █ cases of apparent public hallucinations, in one case accompanied by an unexplained death. Victims were exposed by mistake after falling asleep within SCP-1397's range of effect while the object was contained within Mr. H████'s briefcase, which he carried with him in public. Mr. H████, a local writer with a known connection to the surrealist group "Objektiv," willingly surrendered himself into Foundation custody.

> **<Begin Log>**
>  
> **Agent J████:** Greetings, sir. Could you please state your name for the purposes of this interview?
>  
> **Mr. H████:** I'm A██████ H████, ██ years old, of Prague, but I'm not the point here, now am I? Just ask about the damn book and get this over with.
>  
> **Agent J████:** Patience, Mr. H████. Were you aware of the anomalous properties of SCP-1397?
>  
> **Mr. H████:** Aware? I wrote the damn thing, I created that defective artwork, of course I'm aware!
>  
> **Agent J████:** And could you describe these properties, in your own words?
>  
> **Mr. H████:** I shouldn't have been so ambitious. It doesn't work. The... the thing that's in that book now, it wasn't supposed to kill anyone. You can't teach people real art if they're dead.
>  
> **Agent J████:** Sir, as you would describe it, what does the item do? For official purposes, you understand.
>  
> **Mr. H████:** //(sighs)// That thing in the book, that place, it tries too hard to make you think it's a dream. I've seen it try. But all it ends up looking like to people is a very confusing reality. It doesn't work, and I think it knows that. And then I get word that this thing killed a man. I'm disappointed in it. I'm disappointed in myself.
>  
> **Agent J████:** If the item's properties are not what you intended, sir, what was it that you set out to create?
>  
> **Mr. H████:** I wanted to show people the stupidity of their so-called "impenetrable boundaries" between dreams and reality. That was all I ever wanted to do as an artist. This was my big chance, and I blew it. Now can you just take that defective piece of junk off my hands? If word got out, my reputation would be in goddamn shambles. I can't have my colleagues thinking of me as a //murderer.//
>  
> **Agent J████:** Sir, we will not share this information any more than is strictly necessary. //(pause)// Does the item have any connection to your membership within the group known as "Objektiv"?
>  
> **Mr. H████:** Look, this has nothing to do with them. Leave them alone. We at Objektiv share the same goals in art, and maybe we met over coffee a few times to joke about things like this, but that book was a solo project. Go ask any of them. They'll back me up. Now take the thing away from me and let me return to my life. 
>  
> **Agent J████:** I am afraid you have yet to give us the information we need, sir. You will be released once our questioning is finished, and no sooner. How exactly did you create SCP-1397's anomalous properties?
>  
> **Mr. H████:** You want me to share my goddamn artistic technique? My pride may be wounded, but my integrity's still there. I'm not sharing the secrets to my success.
>  
> **Agent J████:** Even though you didn't succeed?
>  
> **Mr. H████:** Of course.
>  
> //(For the remainder of the interview, Mr. H████ refuses to provide further information relating to SCP-1397 or his involvement with it.)//
>  
> **<End Log>**
>  
> **Closing Statement:** Mr. H████ was dosed with Class-A amnestics and released. Investigation of the other █ members of the surrealist group "Objektiv" revealed no leads relating to SCP-1397 at the time. As of ██/██/19██, all members of the group, including Mr. H████, are confirmed as deceased.

**Addendum 1397-B: Incident 1397-1** 
On ██/██/200█, ██ students living in the dorms of Charles University in Prague reported symptoms similar to SCP-1397 exposure, and █ fatalities occurred within these dorms. The Foundation successfully prevented media from learning of the event, and administered Class-B amnestics to surviving victims and witnesses. SCP-1397-2 through -5 were recovered from the hallways of the affected dorms, where they had been deliberately placed to expose a maximum number of students within to SCP-1397's events. 

Over half of the affected students were discovered to have attended a lecture on "Solipsism and the Psychology of Dreams" given by a Professor ████ █████ the previous day. Mr. █████ was fatally shot by Foundation agents after attempting to resist detainment with deadly force. Mr. █████'s fingerprints were later found on SCP-1397-2 through -5. Analysis done on papers found within the apartment suggests that █████ is the author of the written message on the title pages of SCP-1397-2 through -5.

Linguistic analysis of the text of SCP-1397-2 through -5 matches writing samples taken from the apartments of four Objektiv members after the recovery of SCP-1397-1. Investigation is underway to determine whether the remaining █ members of the group had any involvement with SCP-1397.

**Addendum 1397-C: Transcript of Message in SCP-1397-2 through -5**
> If reality cannot be proven real, how can we know that our dreams are dreams?
