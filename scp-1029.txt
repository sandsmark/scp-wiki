**Item #:** SCP-1029

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Three copies of SCP-1029 are currently stored on standard CD-R media in the secure sections of Foundation libraries at Sites ██, ██ and ██.  Access is permitted only for authorised research into the cause of its effects.

**Description:** SCP-1029 is a 683×1024 pixel EXIF JPEG image file with MD5 checksum bbb61a1033967e337e1c691bd1c860fe.  It depicts a stalk of purple flowers of the species //Hyacinthus orientalis//.  When displayed full-size on a computer monitor and the surface of the screen is gently rubbed with a finger (skin proximity appears to be necessary to trigger the effect), the flower's distinctive fragrance is released in the manner of a "scratch 'n' sniff" card.

Air samples taken while rubbing SCP-1029 induce the perception of the same floral scents when later sniffed by test subjects, suggesting that SCP-1029 has a definite physical, rather than purely mental, effect. Chemical analysis of air samples is in progress.

SCP-1029's unusual effect has been found to reliably manifest on any CRT monitor sufficiently large to display the entire image, but only when the image is displayed at 1:1 (pixel-for-pixel) scale in 24-bit-per-pixel true-colour mode.  Testing shows that only a few models of flat-panel monitor can reproduce the effect.

Reducing the image's colour depth, rescaling it to a smaller size or applying any lossy image processing or editing procedure (including JPEG recompression) have been found to produce an image which does not display SCP-1029's anomalous effect.  Lossless rotation by a multiple of 90°, lossless conversion to PNG format, and cropping of up to 15 pixels off the right edge or 9 pixels off any other edge of SCP-1029 have been found **not** to affect the image's properties.  Uncorrupted digital copies of the file in any form or medium appear to retain the properties of SCP-1029; in a sense, all such copies **are** SCP-1029.

SCP-1029 was discovered by Agent █████ on a web image gallery at URL [DATA EXPUNGED] on ██/██/████ while browsing using a touch-screen computer.  Agent █████ noticed the image's reaction to being rubbed and saved a copy for further study.  The full-size "original" image file (4752×3168 resolution, produced by a █████ ███ 50█ camera according to its EXIF metadata) has also been downloaded from the same site and does not seem to exhibit the same property as SCP-1029; thumbnails and other derived images on the same site are also similarly lacking in SCP-1029's effects.

Researcher █████ has been tasked with attempting to discover a suitable combination of software and settings which, when applied to this full-size image, reproduce SCP-1029.

**Addendum:** A correlation between sweat on the skin and odiferous intensity has been observed.  Doctor ██████ triggered SCP-1029's effect with an unusually sweaty finger shortly after an episode of strenuous exercise in the gym; the smell was later described as "overpowering". This suggests a phenomenon in which sweat (or some component thereof) is being converted to specific odour molecules.  Investigation into this process is ongoing.

**Addendum:** As of ██/██/████ the effect has been discovered to accompany printed reproductions of the image under certain circumstances.  The presence or absence of SCP-1029's effect apparently depends on the quality of reproduction; it can be most reliably reproduced on a dye-sublimation printer with the following procedure: first rescale SCP-1029 to the physical resolution of the printer at full-page size using "nearest neighbour" interpolation, then print the result at 1:1 scale with colour profiling turned off.  Ink-jet and laser printers have not as yet been shown to be able to produce a copy including SCP-1029's behaviour.

**Addendum:** As of ██/██/████, the web site [DATA EXPUNGED] no longer appears to contain SCP-1029.  The same photographic image is present, but its 683×1024 version seems to have been regenerated.  The new copy no longer produces SCP-1029's effect.  Researcher ██████ speculates that this is the result of a web server software upgrade.
