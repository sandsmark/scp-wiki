(An excerpt from //The Thing on the Plate//, a collection of restaurant reviews written by H.P. Lovecraft for the Providence Journal.)

As I set foot into Guiseppe's, I was promptly seized by a wave of thoroughgoing revulsion. My mind reeled at the churning revelation that the establishment was no temple to the finer inheritances of Rome, but rather a low den catering to the coarse pleasures of the debased Sicilian - a swarthy, degenerate people whose only talents lie in the demesne of street violence and the production of the vile Marsala - a mucilaginous, sanguinary mockery of the vintner's art.

The inchoate grunting of the proprietor indicated that I should select my own seating within. With mounting trepidation, I picked my way amongst the rude timber tables, eventually perching myself at the least repellant example of carpentry I was able to detect.  

The very fabric of space-time itself seemed to elongate and ripple obscenely as I awaited some signal of acknowledgment from the sullen attendants. The escalating desperation in my eyes finally captured the attention of a waiter, who stamped gracelessly to my table with the languidness born of his Mediterranean birth-place. 

The menu was engraved upon a coarse hempen paper, heavily adorned with the greasy finger-prints of the luckless diners who had paid visit to the blighted accommodation in days long past. With desperate haste, I opted for the //spaghetti// and meat-balls. I clutched to a slender hope that the proprietor's reluctance to specify the flesh involved did not implicate the establishment in some ghastly charade.

The beetle-browed attendant set the proffered dish upon the profane checked table-cloth with a clattering thud. Within seconds, my worst fears were made manifest. Deep within his sweltering lair, the oafish cook had, through a foul mockery of the culinary arts, taken the noble tomato and reduced it to a scrofulous paste, with a glabrous sheen never meant to adorn earthly food. With a heavy hand, this ichor was ladled over a collection of rugose agglomerations which disgraced the good name of sphere.

And underneath these insults lurked the most unsettling revelation of all. For the Sicilian, not content to take the staff of life and produce therefrom the wholesome bread of our ancestors, instead had so abused and warped the corn of the wheat-stalk as to produce a clotted mass of //slithering filaments//, a writhing heap of wheaten degeneracy which so rejected my every sensibility that I sat dumb-struck for several minutes as it steamed and coagulated.
 
Additionally, the //cannoli// I selected for afters was niggardly in the apportionment of nuts to a scandalous degree. 

Two stars.

[[collapsible show=""Just A Moment Of Your Time" by Roget" hide="to wish you a happy birthday!"]]
It was Sunday. The second Sunday in August. The apartment was small, but not cramped. The walls were lined with a faded floral wallpaper, added by a resident past, and Harold was enjoying his tea. He quite liked Sunday. It was a day where nobody would come around and knock on his door. No bills. No mail. Just peace.

At least, that's how it usually was. Today was something different. Because on that particular Sunday, there was a knock on the door. A quiet one, from somebody who wasn't bold enough to want to wake Harold up. It was just loud enough to alert him from his newspaper and warm mug. 

He rose, joints creaking and slippers fluffing, and shuffled over to the peep-hole. On the other side of the threshold, there was a well-dressed man. He wore a dark brown suit, plain blue tie, and dirty glasses. His hair looked as though he'd recently been wearing a hat, that had been lost to the wind. Normally, Harold would have ignored the solicitor, gone back to his chair, and resumed reading. But today, he didn't.

Instead, he opened the door.

"Greetings." said the solicitor. "My name is Gerald, and I need only a moment of your time." He smiled, a phony but sentimental gesture. He set his briefcase down, and adjusted his tie. Harold just watched him, not sure why he had opened the door, and not quite able to think about why he couldn't think about why.

Gerald set his suitcase down, and clasped his hands together."So, I'm sure you have many friends and relatives. You've know them in the past. But do you know them tomorrow?"

Harold blinked. "I... what?"

Gerald grinned, a genuine one this time. "So, you haven't heard the Good Word?"

Harold had not heard any such word. He shook his head.

"My dear friend, you have been living in a dark age. Constantly looking over your shoulder to memories half-gazed over by your own mind. Wouldn't you like to see the memories before they happen, to get ready?"

Frowning, Harold crossed his arms. "So, like... a fortune-reader?"

A waggling finger was thrust into Harold's face. "Not just any fortune, my friend, but one absolutely-positively guaranteed to work. You'll know everything you ever needed to know about what's coming up. It's like having advanced tickets to the Big Game!"

Harold could spot a phony when he saw one. The cheap smile, the dirty facade... this guy was a carpetbagger, through and through. "Prove it, then."

If possible, the solicitor known as Gerald grew an even wider grin. "Right away..." his arms lurched into the suitcase, unsnapping the hinges and wrestling with the cords, until he revealed a massive, oily hunk of metal. Immediately, the reeking odor of fish and dock rot permeated the hallway. Harold stepped back, aghast. 

"Wha , guh-" he gagged. "What is that?"

Gerald held it clasped between his hands, the oily juices dripping down his fingers, leaving thin red trails in their wake. "Ah, this is what I have been promising you. Touch it."

Harold hesitated.

"Go on, touch it."

Tentatively reaching out, Harold leaned into the device. Swiftly, a blade ejected from the front of its cobbled form, and pricked his outstretched hand. Recoiling in pain and surprise, Harold failed to notice the machine clutching itself as it savored the fresh memories, the new experiences that his lifetime had been enhanced with. Smoke billowed from its many openings and valves, until at last, an oily strip of paper printed out. Gerald snatched it, and peered past his grime-coated spectacles.

"Do you talk to your sister, much?"

Harold looked up, distracted from his distraction. "N-no... why?"

"You won't be talking for quite some time, sorry. But it proves my machine to be functional, yes?"

One blink. "H-hey... what the hell are... what're you talking about?"

"Your sister... Gloria, or something similar, the paper blurred a bit... she died in an accident sixteen minutes ago."

Behind them, Harold's phone began to ring.

"That's probably them now. Are you ready for the news?"

"I... you're fucking lying." Harold backed away, looking over his shoulder to the phone ringing off the hook.

"Here you are now, Harold. Looking over your shoulder to the past, once again."

The phone continued its ringing, but Harold stopped, and turned 'round to face the solicitor. "What do you... what do you want from me?"

"I want you to pay the price for my miraculous little device!" 

"... What do you want?"

"You've already given it to me, Harry. Can I call you Harry? Your life, your blood, your past-present-future. This machine is tied to you, Harry. And so am I."

----

When Harold next had regained his faculties, he was sitting in his chair. His hand was unmolested, and the phone was silent. He breathed a sigh of relief.

Then, there was a horrid, ghastly noise.

Over his shoulder, a ticket printed, oily and dark. It read: {{Check the answering machine}}

I never look up anymore.
 
I don't mean that metaphorically.  I'm not saying I'm pessimistic.  Though I'm that, too.  I mean, if you were me, you wouldn't be flowers and sunshine either.
 
But I'm talking literally.  I keep my eyes down.  It's safer that way.  They hate being stared at...

If you ask him, he'll tell you it's a matter of perspective. There's nothing wrong with you, per say, it's just that you don't really understand how things work around here. It's not about being kind, or strong, or right, or even clever. No, it's all about appearance. There's no such thing as power, he'll say, except for what people see. Ask him, and he'll say it's all about the shoes. You can do whatever you want, really, if you have the right shoes. Sure, he might have done some things in his days that wouldn't fly anymore. You couldn't say his closet was clean of skeletons,  certainly not. If all you found were skeletons, you'd consider yourself lucky. If he was anyone else, it might have haunted him. But he has the shoes. And the hair. And the big, shiny smile. So he walks it off. Boy, does he walk it off.
 
What makes his shoes so special, you ask? Funny story, that. Ask him, and he'll tell you it's really not about the shoes at all. Walking a mile in a man's shoes is nice and all, but walking a mile in his toes is better.

The first thing I remember seeing was the gorge and the grass. I'd spend hours playing in the fields and among the mountain rocks. But as time went on, I grew longer. I arrived at the concrete and the people. They came out of nightclubs and pubs, blinded by lights and throwing up. I could see glances, or a touch of the arm. The couples holding hands, followed by the break-ups and fights. Sometimes an old couple would pass by, sitting on a bench in the soft sun.

As I exited the city, I turned to look back at suburbs. A little boy was having a birthday party in his garden, surrounded by cake, balloons, presents and friends.

I left, and surged out into the sea.

[[collapsible show=""The Knife and the Red Cork" by Wogglebug" hide="Birthdays are cool. Super rad, even. So yeah, have a good one dude."]]
The first time it happened I thought it was odd, but not the second time. The first was a mangy coyote standing on a wall behind an Albertsons, its eyes red and its teeth stained black with the blood of an unlucky crow. The second time it was just some asshole that stood me up.
> 
I guess that could probably use some explaining. You see, whenever I get off work I always walk down Main and up 37th to my apartment, partly on account of I could use the exercise but mostly because Cindy at the flower shop on the corner sometimes says hi. Anyway, I was going past Albertsons and I heard a weird cawing sound from out behind back, like some bird had gone and gotten itself stuck in the packaging they dump back there. I went  to see what it was, and as I turned the corner this huge beaming fucker just jumps up onto the wall, the bird hanging out of its teeth.  I thought it was probably rabid, and that I ought to call animal control or something, but then the asshole opened its mouth and started talking. I don’t mean it was mimicking like those parrots do, or that I’m some sort of dog whisperer. I mean some asshole coyote was speaking English like it wasn’t any big thing. I didn’t actually catch the first thing it said, on account of the whole ‘holy shit a talking dog’ thing, but I remember the second thing. It said, “The woods by the old Wilson place where you and Tommy went in the summer. Come there Sunday with a knife and a piece of red cork.”
> 
Alright, I get at this point you probably assume that I’m bullshitting you, or that I’m just incredibly stupid. Neither of those things are true, and at the very least not the first one. You probably assume I just hallucinated the whole thing, or that it was some homeless guy talking from behind the wall or something. Neither of those are correct either. At this point you’re probably thinking that surely I couldn’t have actually gone out to a patch of woods five hours away where I hadn’t been for twenty years, based on what was likely either Satan or a similarly-themed hallucination. Once again, bad news on that front.
Getting the knife was easy enough, but the cork took ages. Turns out that barely anyone sells cork in the first place, and the guys who do don’t really go for the full rainbow effect. Eventually I found some in a craft store down by the old hospital, the one they renovated last spring.
> 
Sunday night at maybe five I showed up down by the creek across from the woods, expecting there to be some sort of sign or similarly genre-appropriate bullshit to point me towards a journey of self-discovery and excitement. There wasn’t. So, after milling about for a while and throwing little rocks at little fish, I decided to just check the creepy-ass woods themselves. Well, that’s not really accurate. The woods around there aren’t really that creepy, and a lot of it isn’t even real woods- just a ton of trees the developers put in to hide an ugly power substation that the County insisted go right in the middle of Fuck-all, Nowhere.
> 
As it turns out, I’m not the greatest at going through the woods. You wouldn’t even believe the number of spider webs I walked through. Well, actually, you probably would, given that you’re reading this at all. But it was still a lot. Anyway, eventually I got back to the part where none of the neighborhood kids ever really went, because the giant hazard signs the County put up around the substation.  I was walking along what could probably have been a path if it hadn’t been absurdly hard to get through when I saw the same coyote I had seen at Albertsons. Well, it was less that I saw it than it just sort of jumped out in front of me and knocked me over. But still, I did end up seeing it, albeit flat on my ass.
> 
At this point in the story you’re probably expecting me to have my throat violently ripped out by a psychopathic ghost dog making some sort of dark sacrifice. If so, you clearly don’t understand how the first person works. I’m not dead. That’s sort of how it works. At the time though, I was sort of shitting myself in fear. Not literally, mind you, just metaphorically. If I had literally shit myself I probably would’ve just left that part out. But still, there I was, on the ground in the middle of the woods with an absurdly filthy coyote glaring at my face from about a foot away. So I made the clear and obvious choice and just said “What the fuck, man?”, accusatory hand gestures included.
> 
The coyote stared at me for a while, and eventually just sort of stalked away. Not like in the movies or whatever where the animal guide leads the protagonist off into the woods to face some great evil. It just sort of left.
> 
Eventually, after dusting myself off (or de-dirting, or whatever you call it) I looked around for the coyote. I looked for three fucking hours, and I couldn’t find it anywhere, which sort of pissed me off. Eventually I gave up, because hey, hallucinations happen, right? (right?)
> 
That next Tuesday I was walking home when I heard the familiar sound of a bird dying a horrible, terrible death.  Same thing as before, blah blah evil looking coyote blah. And it just sort of stares at me this time, doesn’t say a word. I swear to God, if an animal could be embarrassed, that one was. After just staring at each other for a while I decide to go with the good-old “What the fuck, man?”
> 
It just keeps staring and starts talking, a dead bird dangling from its teeth, going, “Hell, I didn’t think you’d actually do it. Fucking weirdo.” And then it just scampers off, like some king-of-all-he-surveys asshole.
> 
No, but, like, seriously. Fuck that guy. I still don’t know what that shit was about.

[[collapsible show=""The Missing Tone!" by Jekeled" hide="Happy birthday!"]]
"So, Doctor Hartman," Doctor Grangeman said, sitting down at the interrogation table, "let's talk a little more about the delusion we were discussing yesterday."
     
Hartman sat in a little huddle at the far end of the table, humming to himself quietly. He stopped this for long enough to ramble: "...not a delusion...it's REAL!! it's ALL REAL! None of you Bastards would listen to me, but it's rEAL!!!"
     
"Now, now," Grangeman said in a soothing tone of voice. "Remember what we talked about: you've got to use proper spelling and punctuation when you speak. It's the polite thing to do. Now, what do you say?"
     
"...sorry..." Hartman mumbled.
     
"No, no," Grangeman said. "What do we say //properly?//"
     
"I'm sorry," Hartman said.
     
"Very good. Now, on to your delusion."
     
"It's not a delusion," Hartman insisted. "I found the missing note!"
     
Grangeman sighed. "I see you're still laboring under it. There is no missing note in the musical scale. It just isn't how these things work!"
     
"That's what everybody //thinks!//" Hartman cried. "Think of all the music that could be created! Think of all the new tones to create! Think of how the piano would have to be remade!"
     
"Listen," Grangeman said patiently. "These things don't //work// that way! All the tones and letters are completely arbitrary! They're all based on specific frequencies which our brain takes out and labels as specific pitches. The tonal system we have is just a way for us to categorize those frequencies! You can't discover another musical note; there are only a finite number of frequencies to find!"
     
Hartman shook his head vigorously. "It's true!" he said. "I call it hleem! Because the next note after G should be H, but I shook it up a bit! Here, I'll even hum it!"
     
Here he hummed a note. Grangeman, who had had some musical training, immediately recognized it. "Doctor Hartman," he said, "that's middle C."
     
"No! No!" Hartman cried. "You're out to get me! You're all out to get me! It's a conspiracy! A conspiracy i Tell You! A CONSPIRACY!!!!"
     
Grangeman sighed. There went another session, right down the drain.
--
"I feel sorry for the poor fellow," Grangeman commented later to one of his colleagues, as he watched the security camera footage of Hartman in his room. "A music teacher gone completely mad...you've gotta sympathize on some level."
     
"I suppose," his colleague said. "I just wish he could have chosen a less ridiculous thing to fixate on."
     
"Well," Grangeman said, "it had to be something. Not surprising that-"
     
"Wait!" his colleague said. "Look at Hartman's monitor!"
     
Grangeman gasped. "We've got to get over there, fast!" he cried.
     
But by the time they got there, it was too late! Blood was everywhere, and in the middle of it was Hartman, twisted into a grotesque parody of a half note.
     
Grangeman's colleague bent over and vomited, and he himself recoiled from the scene. He slowly walked into the room, trying to avoid stepping in any major blood puddles. Reaching Hartman's desk, he picked up a single sheet of paper laying there. It was a musical staff in all ways except for one: instead of five lines and four spaces, there were //six lines and five spaces-enough room for one more note!//

It's cold outside. I'm holding my jacket, my soft, warm jacket, as close to my body as I can, but it doesn't help much. I'm shivering, shaking harder than I have for a while. It's been a mess ever since they laid me off. My only joy, gone.
 
Gah. I have to stop thinking. It's not helping at all. I just have to get home, where I can snuggle up under my homemade blanket and read a nice book by the orange light cast through my newly constructed lamp and shade.
 
God. I just miss all of them. Little Albert, Josie, Laura, Stevie... I wish I could just pick them up and hold their soft, warm little bodies in my lap and rock them asleep. They were always so precious. I can't lie to myself, I even thought of them as my own for the longest time.
 
...
 
They'll regret sending me away. The goddamn Sunnydale nursery... the kids //loved// me there. Much better than that //bitch,// Evaline. Hell, they were all probably just jealous that all of the little munchkins liked me more. Well, forget them. I pull my jacket a smidgen tighter around my torso and take a deep breath of that glorious smell and remember that wherever I go, it doesn't really matter that I don't have a job to work with those kids anymore.
 
After all, I'll have little things that remind me of each of them everyday. Really (that reminds me, I need to make sure the lampshade has been tanned proper), those kids will always be mine in a certain way.

[[collapsible show=""The Triumvirate" by Vezaz" hide="Best Wishes to Dear Leader!"]]

We've been playing this game recently -- //the// Game, I should say -- called //1914.//  Hell of a thing.

My buddies Kyle and John, we love history.  It's sort of our thing.  So when Kyle dug the Game out of his father's closet, we thought it'd be a hoot to try out.  An unplayable board game from the seventies, two hundred little cardboard squares marching across a grid of hexagons tracing all the rivers, mountains, and cities of France.  Each counter has three little numbers on it for attack, defense, move.  There's tables of numbers for moving, for combat, resupply—endless columns on dozens of dusty of papers.  

John and me, we're the Germans.  Kyle takes Frenchies; he's the only one who can make heads or tales of all the numbers, so we follow his lead.  

The game starts slow.  Set up takes three hours and the pieces move about half an inch a turn if you're lucky.  Still, it's a blast.  Belgium goes under real quick.  Holland never stood a chance.  Deutschers strike towards Verdun and the Foreign Legion leads a charge to surround Metz.  Just a bunch of squares shuffling, though.

Around session four things start to get a little weird.  French infantry encircled outside Antwerp are running low on supplies and Kyle tells us he's going to start eating the horses of his cavalry division — to keep the front line troops fed.  Says he gets a bonus if they eat the riders too.  We try to laugh that one off but he cracks open the monstrous rulebook and sure enough the “cannibalism efficacy chart” says it plain as day, though God knows how often //that// particular contingency was expected to come up.

That discovery put a whole new spin on gameplay -- we started seeing what other optional rules we could dig up.  The Osirian Appendices -- right after the "Play by Mail" section -- changed my whole Brussels Offensive.   It's amazing what the hoisted ribcage of an enemy does for the morale of your troops — at least according to the designer's notes.  

Turns out there's all sorts of mechanics that'll give you an edge, for the right price.  Blood sigils let you add +1 to your rolls, but only if the blood is fresh.  “Hallowed gore” gives you an experience bonus — Marshal Foch swore by it.  Barbed wire is tougher when woven with bone.  Who knew the First World War had so much to do with arterial logistics?

We weren't happy about sending the second line troops off to the slaughterhouse.  But I think the improvement of our positions around Flanders more than justified that particular decision.

By now I hear the armies marching at night, but Kyle's the one who gets real into it.  He doesn't just address the day's sacrifices by name — we all do that by now; it negates a bunch of debuffs — he's begun tracking the turns on his skin.  And eyeing John's vertebrae.

He announces the construction of a pyramid of skulls large enough to encompass Paris and visible from the moon.  Keeps producing page after page of optional rules in a frankly suspicious red ink.  John just sits and hums.  Hasn't been the same since we ate Bucephalus.

We're on to something special. 

***

By 1918, things have...escalated.  This next offensive is the big one — we've been preparing.  What was Belgium is painted red, the dykes retaining human viscera instead of water.  That's crucial to our success -- the viscera, I mean. Our armies of millions are long gone, just a few hundred thousand now, but what thousands!  The femur of your closest friend strikes more true than any bullet; vests of Belgian tendon are as good as kevlar in the hands of our tailors.  Supply problems are a thing of the past; easier to keep our food on the hoof, or rather, the boot.  Each German carries a hundred souls within his gullet.  I don't want to //think// about what the French carry there.

All but the best have been expended.  Our modern soldier is frightfully effective, but requires a lot of ingredients.  

Summer of 1918.  Kyle sits atop the Parisian Ossuary and mocks us.  There isn't going to be a 1919.
