title:Surprise! Happy Birthday! Still?
[!--

THIS IS AWESOME, TROY! HOW DO I ADD MY OWN!?!?!?

Well, that's simple, Mr. Person Editing This Page.

Toss in a collapsible. Give us the name of your creepy pasta and your name as the "show", and put in a special birthday message as the "hide."  Make sure you put in a line break.

Have fun, guys! And enjoy Gears Day!

What about the one where the author became his story, then accidentally cut his own character? Or the purloined thumbscrews? Hmm... I thought we'd got you with that one.

> Well, none the less, I suppose I'm supposed to bid you welcome! Welcome to the tales, in honor, in... memoriam? No? Soon, perhaps. Tales of sorrow and joy. Tales of the goblet filled with the blood of the sun, or perhaps tales about the simple flute who became a man. Tales of the raven, snake, bear, and raven again, when coyote chopped him in half. Tales of paper tower made of lost stories, and the Cruciform of Jude. Tales of Little Bo Peep, the forgotten note, or the left handed tree. Tales! Tales to celebrate this, the day of your death!
