--**##red|Item #: SCP-5404##**--

--**##red|Object Class: Keter##**--

**How To Make Safe:** Please --**##red|do not talk##**-- about --**##red|SCP-5404##**-- ("boom-boom words"). No making words about boom-boom words on computers or not-computers. 

In the time that is now, we are not having smart-knowing about which words go boom-boom. To keep everyone being safely alive, please make not normal --**##red|talk##**-- style. 

Words and bunches of words that are in red are known to go boom-boom. Remember to never ever assemble them.

Remember to always make **two** "boom-boom" with an in-between hyphen. Other styles of making this meaning will go boom-boom.

//New Thing:// Sometimes safe is made to not be safe. Always test with boom-boom computer.

**What It Is:** "Boom-Boom --**##red|words##**--" ("letter clusters") is a thing that makes some bunches of letter-clusters make a boom-boom when you put some letter-clusters by other letter-clusters, but only when the thing you are making about is boom-boom letter-clusters themselves. Sometimes just a single cluster of letters will go boom-boom.

Only when making mouth sounds or making symbol mouth sounds does letter clusters go boom-boom. Reproducing old before-times mouth sound records is safe, but only goes --**##red|a certain amount##**-- of safety. All Foundation computer-symbol letter-clusters are saved right at the time of making, so if you see red bunches of letter-clusters, it means mistake had happened. 

------

**Trying-Things-Out Log:** We have computer arms make button-hits on computer letters to test what makes boom-boom. What you can look at under this is just a small bunch for example to show how not-safe boom-boom letter-clusters are.

**More Thing:** 

> Boom-boom letter clusters made by don't-like-us group. New styles of boom-boom letter clusters keep happening. It gets more bad again and again. 
> 
> If boom-boom letter-clusters started to happen when making mouth-sounds about things that aren't boom-boom letter-clusters, **world could boom-boom.** 
> 
> The Big In-Charge Group has made it happen that trying-things-out and looking-into must keep being happen to stop don't-like-us group and safely keep world not being boom-boom. 
> 
> They make unlikely demands. Tiamat is maybe. For the now-time, --**##red|[[[taboo|Eshu]]]##**-- stands. 
> 
> We keep-safe. We keep-in. We keep-out.
