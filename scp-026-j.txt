> **Dr. Nichols:** I'm not sure.  We're supposed to be testing with it, but I don't think that there's much here.
> 
> **Dr. Johnson:** I got my tongue stuck once when I was a kid to one almost like this.  Not anomalous obviously, but either way, man did it suck.

> **Dr. Nichols:** I'm pretty sure that is just an urban legend.

> **Dr. Johnson:** Are you serious?  Aren't you a materials scientist?
> 
> **Dr. Nichols:** Yes.  I'm just saying, I think that's just an urban legend.
