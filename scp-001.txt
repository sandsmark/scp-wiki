**Item #:** SCP-001

**Object Class:** Safe/Euclid/Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-001 is to be kept at [[[scp-object-classes| this website, and shall not be removed for any reason.]]]

**Description:** SCP-001 consists of the Object Classification guidelines for SCP researchers. Although intended as a broad, simple method of quickly classifying new artifacts in a manner that allows personnel to easily ascertain the basic mindset to take when researching said object, SCP-001 has the preternatural ability to cause frustration, anxiety, and long, meandering debates on the nature of various definitions of the words "threat," "danger," and "safe." Frustration caused by discussion of SCP-001 has led to the firing of several personnel, sixteen suicides, and the destruction of the entire west coast.

Despite this fact, the memetic nature of the SCP Object Classifications prevents SCP Foundation personnel from replacing it with a more nuanced system. Several have been proposed, but adoption of the new methods have been spotty at best.
