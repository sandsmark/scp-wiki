**Special Containment Procedures:** As SCP-5000 is organically self-contained, no additional containment procedures are necessary.  

5000/Obelisk-Events outside of controlled testing are to be halted as quickly as possible. Lethal force is authorized. 5000/Obelisk constructions are to be monitored by a minimum of four memetic surveillance complexes.[[footnote]]Abstract meme complexes contained within the upper metaphysical regions' Noosphere. These memes are formed from the consciousness of simple surveillance AI systems, due to their natural resistance to harmful memetic phenomena.[[/footnote]] If an SCP-5000-1 construct is able to breach more easily accessible regions of the Noosphere, MTF-Nu-π ("Sphere of Influence") is to be mobilized to terminate the construct. 

If any uncontained 5000/Obelisk-Event advances to a 5000/Monolith-Event, Project NEON SILENCE is to be activated.  At least three Hyperon-Morpheus Entropy-Subconceptualization Cannons[[footnote]]The H/M E-SCC is a conceptual superweapon.  Located within the lower physical area of the Noosphere, they are capable of increasing the level of thought decay and information entropy around hyper-specific concepts within both the Noosphere and traditional reality, removing them from the human experience and rendering them sub-existent.  Concepts and objects that experience this process are no longer capable of interacting mentally, physically, or conceptually with anything within the known universe.[[/footnote]] are to target the Monolith Anchor and eliminate it.  Following the Anchor's removal, MTF-Nu-π is to enter the Monolith and trigger a conceptostructural collapse.

**Description:**  SCP-5000 is an artistic constructohazard that is biologically self-contained within an organically inaccessible region of the Noosphere. Prior to its discovery and subsequent expansion, SCP-5000 was only accessible to mechanized organisms and experimental artificial intelligence. Since then, SCP-5000 has expanded to approximately 174.8% its original size, resulting in the partial assimilation of sections of the Noosphere pertaining to visual abstraction, conjecture, and metacognition. While SCP-5000 is physically incapable of being accessed by any biological entity under normal circumstances, it can be forcibly breached via experimental paratechnologies.  

Once an individual or intelligence accesses SCP-5000, they are designated the Anchor of the ensuing 5000/Obelisk-Event. Obelisk-Events occur entirely within the Noosphere, slowly spreading outward from the Anchor. Once in this stage, SCP-5000's influence is capable of spreading through physical, mental, or conceptual proximity to the Anchor.  SCP-5000 typically prioritizes the artistic elements of it's host, spreading first to nearby concepts and abstractum that more closely resonate with the Anchor's idea of creativity.

Once SCP-5000/Obelisk expands beyond the Anchor, it will begin generating a number of structures within Noosphereic space around the Anchor, linking the connections together. Despite existing entirely within the Noosphere, these structures are pseudo-physical, and can be mentally interacted with by those with mental proximity to the Anchor. As time progresses, the Obelisk will spread and grow into a conceptoconstruct roughly resembling a mental city. At this point the Anchor is unable to exit SCP-5000, and is repurposed into a type of mental conception engine, powering the construct. After an Obelisk has infected a certain number of concepts,[[footnote]]The exact number is unknown, due to the inability of Foundation efforts to determine what the Anchor has linked too, and the infinite range which it exhibits when spreading.[[/footnote]] it will undergo a conceptual relativity collapse, and cause a 5000/Monolith-Event. Monolith events are characterized by the sudden breaching of the structures created during the previous 5000/Obelisk-Event into physical reality.  

As soon as a 5000/Monolith-Event begins, the Anchor's physical form is pulled entirely into the Noosphere. As time passes, the Monolith will expand farther into physical reality, spreading to nearby abstractum rapidly, converting them into additional Sub-Anchors. If this expansion is not obstructed, the Monolith will soon exist within both the Noosphere and reality simultaneously, allowing physical entry to the Noosphere. As this occurs, consensus reality gradually becomes disrupted, no longer adhering to natural laws, but instead following dream-like logic.

Exploration reveals that the structures within the Monolith are typically not geometrically possible, physically manifesting as higher dimensional objects in three, two, and even one dimensional space, as well as creating both negative and anti-dimensional objects and concepts. The materials used within the Monolith are rarely physically existent, instead being composed purely of ideas and abstractions, rendered corporeal.



**Addendum.5000.1:** Existing Monolith Constructs.

At present there are three uncontainable Monolith in existence, with an additional two being suspended in their initial state within Foundation custody. These 5000/Monolith-Events occurred rapidly, and were either able to evolve to a point where the H/M E-SCCs were unable to neutralize them, or affect concepts that rendered them immune. The H/M E-SCCs were, however, able to sever the Monolith's connections to estranged concepts, rendering them incapable of spreading further.  These Monolith have since relocated and continued to grow, sustaining themselves entirely on original concepts and obscuring themselves from traditional observational reality, making additional containment measures unnecessary. Explorations into these Monolith were attempted, but they were unable to be breached.

**Designation:** SCP-5000/Monolith-Δ
**Anchor:** MARDUK.AICB
**Date of 5000/Obelisk-Event:** 04/01/1986
**Date of 5000/Monolith-Event:** 04/03/1986
**Affected concepts and abstractum:** 42,137
**Location:** Currently within High Earth Orbit. This orbit grows by approximately 2-3% each rotation.
----
**Creation:** MARDUK.AIC was originally designed to be a Virtual Intelligence Coordinator, assisting in and developing virtual scenarios for the purposes of training both Mobile Task Forces and future O5s. Part of its duties included theorizing potential K-Class Scenarios and developing appropriate countermeasures. On 03/29/1986, it became infected with an unknown memetic hazard, believed to have been created or accessed as part of these duties. Due to the unknown severity of the hazard, containment efforts were rushed. Improper shutdown procedures paired with the unknown anomaly caused MARDUK.AIC to undergo spontaneous evolution, breaching into SCP-5000 and causing a rapid Obelisk-Event.

Over the course of the next two hours, the Obelisk rapidly spread to over 5,000 concepts and abstractum, significantly faster than any other known event. Within two days, MARDUK.AIC had undergone conceptual singularic collapse, advancing to a 5000/Monolith-Event. Now designated Monolith-Δ, it proceeded to lift itself out of the site, taking the majority of the facility and surrounding environment with it. It continued to gain altitude, leaving the atmosphere and advancing into space. 

**Notes:** SCP-5000/Monolith-Δ is spherical in form, with a indeterminate number of smaller spheres orbiting around it, interconnected via a series of shifting helical tunnels.  The center sphere is approximately 2,000 kilometers in diameter, with the smaller sphere ranging from .5 to 200 kilometers.  These spheres constantly shift around in a massive kinetoglyph, creating a multilayered observational barrier around itself and generating massive amount of internal energy.  The area outside the inner sphere is surrounded by a localized, high-intensity cosmic storm, generating a number of interlocking wormholes and micro-singularities.

**Affected concepts and abstractum:** 214,491
**Location:** 82 kilometers under the crust, centered beneath the Yosemite supercaldera.

**Creation:** Unknown

**Notes:** While the origins of SCP-5000/Monolith-Θ are unknown, it is hypothesized to have accessed SCP-5000 through extradimensional means. It is the only known biological Monolith in existence, appearing as a formation of tubules and ventricles that cover approximately 74.2% of the Earth's mantle and core. Monolith-Θ is in perpetual motion, vibrating at a constant frequency of 172 hertz. SCP-5000/Monolith-Θ's other physical properties fluctuate constantly, with its state of matter, gravitational pull, spatial perception, and temporal significance regularly shifting. Traces of Monolith-Θ have also been confirmed on six separate exoplanets, despite an estimated distance of 770 light years between the nearest affected exoplanet and Earth.

**Designation:** SCP-5000/Monolith-Ψ
**Anchor:** Estimated 18 members of GOI-004 "The Church of the Broken God" 
**Date of 5000/Obelisk-Event:** N/A
**Date of 5000/Monolith-Event:** 08/16/2004
**Affected concepts and abstractum:** ≈24,500*18
**Location:** The primary Anchor is currently located at both the North and South magnetic poles.
----
**Creation:** While the specifics regarding SCP-5000/Monolith-Ψ's creation are unconfirmed, it is believed to have been formed during an advanced Mekanite planar communion ritual. A significant number of physically altered Mekanites fused together in a massive array, creating a semi-intelligent hive-mind, which began broadcasting an interplanar energy signal. The intended purpose of this signal is unknown. Immediately following the broadcast, SCP-5000/Monolith-Δ created a conceptual link between it and the array of Mekanites, forcing all participants into SCP-5000. During this process, they were fused into a singular, multi-personality hive-mind, increasing the spread of SCP-5000 to nearby concepts and abstractum upwards of 697% faster than SCP-5000's normal infection rate.

Due to its possession of multiple Anchors, the H/M E-SCCS were unable to effectively neutralize SCP-5000/Monolith-Ψ. This, paired with SCP-5000/Monolith-Δ's interference, caused SCP-5000/Monolith-Ψ to completely bypass the Obelisk phase of SCP-5000 exposure, expanding exponentially as each Anchor affected new concepts and reinforced their sibling Anchor's hold. 

**Notes:** SCP-5000/Monolith-Ψ resembles two massive clock faces, located at the North and South magnetic poles, each approximately 50 kilometers in diameter and sunk about 2 kilometers into the ground. The majority of the mental constructs are found beneath the clock hands, which spin opposite each other, leveling the buildings with each pass. These hands do not move at the traditional speed of clock hands, but vary between rotation times of .0082 seconds to an estimated 22 million years.  Above the clocks hover in excess of 50 billion gears and cogs, all of which have been observed to rotate within at least five dimensions simultaneously. Upon every completed rotation of the clock faces every gear ceases its movement, and falls to the clock face for several minutes, growing an additional tooth before rising back up into the air and resuming its rotation.

**Addendum.5000.2:** Exploration of SCP-5000

On 04/23/2007, an attempted interplanar exploration of SCP-5000 was conducted following the approval of Procedure 5000/Nu-Omicron by the O5 Council. Utilizing newly developed Noospheric Sub-Ego Resonance Cascade technology, a conceptual tear could be channeled through an individual vulnerable to SCP-5000 infection. D-4966, who was an acclaimed pianist known for her classical adaptations prior to her incarceration, was chosen to be the induction catalyst of Procedure Nu-Omicron due to her intimate connection to the musical arts. During this time, D-4966 was monitored by several surveillance meme complexes for potential SCP-5000 infection progression, upon which would trigger the release of a virulent meme within D-4966's brain, preventing further 5000/Obelisk development.  


[[div style="color: black; font-family: Courier; background:white; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 4% 4% 4% 4%"]]

**Forward:** D-4966 was connected to the S-EBRE,[[footnote]]Functioning as a sort of telepathic "battering ram," the Sub-Ego Base Resonance Engine allows cognizant entities to access regions of the Noosphere that are otherwise inaccessible or fundamentally abstruse.[[/footnote]] and placed in the center of a large empty room.  Several Type III Ocular Extensions were set up around D-4966, in order to view the Noosphere and determine the optimal point of MTF-Nu-π insertion.  A number of musical instruments were placed around D-4966 in order to provide easier and more predictable vectors of spread.  Various other art supplies were similarly provided.

----

**[BEGIN LOG]**

**00.00.00:** The S-EBRE is activated, breaching SCP-5000 and giving D-4966 access.  D-4966 is now designated A/Obelisk-Nu.

**00.15.10:** Several piano keys are visible hovering in the distance. They appear to depress at a steady rhythm. 

**00.44.57:** A/Obelisk-Nu accelerates towards the keys, impacting the corner of the nearest key. The left side of A/Obelisk-Nu liquefies upon contact.

**01.30.18:** The liquefied organic matter develops tumorous growths resembling trumpet horns. The growths latch onto A/Obelisk-Nu, exsanguinating it before wilting. The trumpets liquefy once more, reforming A/Obelisk-Nu's missing flesh.

**02.11.46:** A/Obelisk-Nu plummets downwards, falling through the horn of a clarinet and exiting through the reed and into an elevator. The elevator remains stationary for several minutes while A/Obelisk-Nu lays in the fetal position.

**05.34.02:** The elevator jolts and begins moving. Throughout the elevator ride, observers report the scent of brass despite a lack of Olfactory Extensions. A/Obelisk-Nu is observed shifting dimensions on four occasions, in addition to completely disappearing for several hours before reappearing. 

**11.09.28:** The elevator ceases movement. A/Obelisk-Nu passes incorporeally through the doors revealing a large rope bridge constructed of ivory and string extending from the elevator to a distant skyscraper. A sea of molten brass is visible far under the bridge. 

**13.29.42:** A/Obelisk-Nu steps onto the bridge, the string immediately snapping.  A/Obelisk-Nu remains fused to the bridge as it swings towards the skyscraper, impacting the structure. Upon impact, A/Obelisk-Nu detaches from the bridge, falling into a large pile of shattered string instruments. The pile appears to be in the shape of Billy Joel.

**18.52.19:** The pile begins speaking to A/Obelisk-Nu, although no sound is audible from the figure. A/Obelisk-Nu then picks up a shattered violin bow, which it uses to completely bisect itself. The Billy Joel caricature appears to laugh. 

**26.07.18:** The sky above A/Obelisk-Nu bends, then shatters.  Millions of piano keys begin to fall from between the cracks.  Where these keys make contact with each other they stop in midair, and begin to spiral inwards.  As the collections of keys grow they begin to burst into golden flames, which stretch between other collections like a massive spiderweb. 

**31.45.19:** Two large ivory skyscrapers spout from the bisected regions of A/Obelisk-Nu. The buildings continue to rise unimpaired for several hours before impacting, with both structures toppling 360° through the ground and impacting an additional building.  The third building swells, then bursts.  Liquid glass pours through the now empty windows and climbs into the air, solidifying into fountains of solid glass that tie A/Obelisk-Nu's body back together.

**36.38.42:** Thousands of strings manifest in the air around A/Obelisk-Nu, and begin to wrap around it.  They begin to cut into its skin, causing massive explosions of molten brass to burst from the cuts.  The brass travels down the strings, solidifying them in the air and branching off into flowers, which spiral towards both the ground and sky.

**40.18.26:** A/Obelisk-Nu's epidermis becomes yellow in sheen before its tear ducts begin violently spraying molten brass into the surroundings. The molten brass appears to impact previously incorporeal structures, coating them in molten brass and ivory. These structures appear to be mostly interconnected stairways, circular hallways, and fourth-dimensional doorways. It was at this point that surveillance meme complexes attempted to neutralize A/Obelisk-Nu to no effect.

**40.23.51:** Several large interlocking halos appear around A/Obelisk-Nu. It waves its arms, and the halos fly in all directions. Where the halos impact surrounding objects they implode, liquifying the the surroundings. A/Obelisk-Nu's body contorts and expands, separating at the joints. Appendages are now connected via violin strings, interlocking piano keys, and massive spikes of glowing glass.

**40.30.27:** A whirlpool appears in the molten sea beneath A/Obelisk-Nu. From its center begins to emerge a massive skyscraper, with various floors either missing or displaced, both temporally and physically.  More skyscrapers emerge from beneath it, growing upwards in a massive spiraling flower.
-----
At this point the Ocular Extensions being used to view Obelisk-Nu overheated rapidly, and underwent emergency shutdown.  The area was evacuated do to concerns of a potential 5000/Monolith-Event,  and MTF-Nu-π began to prepare for insertion via the NS-ERC in order to terminate A/Obelisk-Nu.

**Video log:** Obelisk-Nu termination

**Active MTF:** MTF-Nu-π ("Sphere of Influence")
**Participating members:** -1 ("Bean"), -4 ("Pumpkin"), -5 ("Key Lime"), -7 ("Cherry"), -9 ("Apple"), -12 ("Banana")

**Forward:** Utilizing the NS-ERC, MTF-Nu-π enter the Noosphere around Obelisk-Nu and proceed to locate and terminate the Anchor (A/Obelisk-Nu).  Timestamps are continued from the previous log.  Traditional audio is unavailable, yet present.

----

**[BEGIN LOG]**

**40.36.04:** MTF-Nu-π manifest on the outskirts of Obelisk-Nu, atop a floating glass platform.  The platform is covered with collections of piano keys, resembling crystalized plant growths.  Directly in front of them is the elevator seen in the beginning of the previous log.  Above their heads two massive sphere of golden fire expel an unknown liquid.[[footnote]]This liquid was later reported by MTF-Nu-π to be liquified music, composed of a combination of Bach and Wagner[[/footnote]]  MTF-Nu-π begin to travel towards the elevator.
[[include component:image-block name=military.png|caption=Image recovered from π-4's shoulder-mounted camera.]]
**40.38.45:**  MTF-Nu-π enter the elevator, which closes and begins to descend.  Every few seconds, the elevator stops and the walls disappear, revealing a different environment from behind each wall.  Each of the them contain either a garden, a city, or mural of space, but are all unique in appearance.  In the distance of each environment floats a singular, massive entity, comprised of various amalgamations of instruments and flowers.  These entities are motionless, but get visibly closer each time the elevator descends. π-4 is audible humming "It's Not Unusual" by Tom Jones before being reprimanded by π-1. 

**41.58.32:** The elevator stops, and MTF-Nu-π exits onto a shimmering bridge, which is suspended in the air via hundreds of rigid strings that emerge from the brass sea beneath it.  As MTF-Nu-π travels down the bridge, the space behind them becomes distorted, with their footprints causing massive regions to be shunted violently in all directions.  The elevator folds into itself, then shatters into an indeterminate number of flowering glass shards.  The shards float along next to MTF-Nu-π, apparently escorting them along the bridge.

**42.26.12:** MTF-Nu-π reaches the end of the bridge, and enter the city.  The glass that was following them begins to circle around the bridge rapidly, severing the strings.  The bridge peels apart, and collapses upward into an iridescent whirlpool that appears in the sky.

**42.32.45:** MTF-Nu-π begins to navigate through the city. The ground appears to be a rough approximation of a road, and is made of a slick black material. Cracks in the material occasionally release an arching electric discharge. The surrounding buildings are observed to shift and bend at various angles, occasionally realigning themselves into the shape of musical notes. 

**42:59:01:** π-1 stops the group, pointing ahead towards what appears to be a swirling mass of wooden debris and viscera,[[footnote]]Later determined to be a physically manifested auditory cognitohazard.[[/footnote]] advancing towards them. MTF-Nu-π secure their facial shields and rush through the mass of debris. Footage of the debris storm is severely obscured, with only the whirling mass of splintered wood and blood visible. Obfuscated shouts are heard from various MTF members. 

**43:1:19:** MTF-Nu-π exits the storm and appears standing on a wooden spiral staircase. Footage from π-9 is still obscured by whirling viscera and debris, despite having visibly exited the mass.[[footnote]]π-9's camera was obscured for the remainder of the log.[[/footnote]] π-5 and π-1 now possess nosebleeds, the blood being iridescent in color. MTF members deploy provided conceptual ear protection as a shrill whistling sound is heard. Despite prior training, π-5's conceptualization of ear protection takes the form of woolen earmuffs, requiring pressure from the agent's hands for additional sound insulation. π-9 possesses no visible ear protection. 

**43:27:31:** MTF-Nu-π proceeds down the staircase, with steps rapidly decaying once unoccupied. π-4 continues humming and is once again requested to stop. Occasionally, the MTF are assaulted by piano keys launched from an unknown source. The staircase descends into a large empty space, completely dark apart from a bright light that begin emanating from the staircase.  As MTF-Nu-π descends each step produces a different note, which echoes for seemingly several minutes before the next note begins.  The melody matches that which π-4 was humming earlier.  The notes carry particles of light with them, spiraling outwards into the darkness. 

**44.12.06:** The darkness around the staircase fades away, revealing itself suspended high above a massive pyramid.  Around the base of the pyramid are a variety of out of focus, dancing entities.  The entities are blurred, but appear roughly humanoid, with their heads consisting of trumpet bells that extend many times longer than the rest of their bodies.  Directly above the pyramid floats a massive cube, with each face rotating independently.  Numerous strings extend from this cube, each entering the bell of one of the entities.  The staircase disappears, and MTF-Nu-π spontaneously appear on the ground.

**44.32.55:** MTF-Nu-π walk towards the pyramid, and the entities vanish to reveal a small entryway.  The find themselves in an octagonal room, with each wall being comprised of a N^^th^^ dimensional 12 sided mirror.  Reflected in each mirror are several copies of MTF-Nu-π, all of which are nude and dancing slowly.[[footnote]]Notably, π-9 does not appear in any of the reflections.[[/footnote]]  A massive eyeball hovers within each reflection, staring straight down at the reflected Task Force.  

**44.36.01:** A large number of perfectly white birds appear in the reflections, and begin to fly in circles around the dancers.  After several rotations, one of the birds lands on the reflected π-4's head.  The reflection's skin peels off, and the bird digs its claws into the skull and begins to fly upwards.  As the bird flies higher, more of π-4's flesh sloughs off, until the bird is left carrying only her brain and spinal column.  The bird flies into the pupil of the floating eyeball, and the rest of the birds begin to repeat this process to the other reflections.

**44.44.21:** π-4 raises her conceptualized firearm towards the eye, only to be dissuaded by π-1. MTF-Nu-π exit the room by incorporeally passing through the nearest mirror, entering a small garden. The garden appears to be covered by translucent vines, through which flow a pink liquid. Visible within the garden are several topiary bushes depicting various scenes observed during Procedure 5000/Nu-Omicron. Topiary bushes appear to be constructed of sapphire guitar picks and flutes. Surrounding the garden is a wall of hedges constructed of shattered glass and live bees. MTF-Nu-π locate the center of the maze, which consists of an industrial submarine hatch embedded within the clearing. Surrounding the clearing are topiary similar to those observed when entering the garden, although they now possess severe corrosive damage. Engraved in the hatch are various music notes, including four unrecognizable notations. The hatch is opened with relative ease, revealing a concrete chute that extends downward an indeterminate distance.

**44.51.12:** π-7 begins to climb into the chute, at which point the entrance vanishes.  Gravity reverses, and the other members of MTF-Nu-π accelerate toward the sky rapidly.  A large tornado appears above them, composed entirely of various music pieces and two physically manifested  infohazards. Inside the center of the vortex is a large island.  MTF-Nu-π do not impact the bottom of the island, but phase through it, falling to the ground once fully emerged from the island. π-7 is seen dropping from the bottom of the concrete chute, which emerges spontaneously from the empty sky[[footnote]]Previously the ground.[[/footnote]] above MTF-Nu-π.

In front of MTF-Nu-π are four massive pillars, composed of glass, bronze, flayed flesh, and an amalgamation of musical instruments tied together with strings.  Floating in the air between the pillars is A/Obelisk-Nu.  A/Obelisk-Nu's body is entirely blackened and covered in a number of glowing thaumaturgic runes that dig into the space around them, twisting it inwards and expelling it from A/Obelisk-Nu's eyes.  Several massive spiked halos surround A/Obelisk-Nu's head, extending into a swirling technicolor thundercloud beneath them, which constantly expels fire.  A number of pure white birds are seen nesting around and inside each of the pillars, with their wings having been replaced by millions of small shards of molten glass. Beneath A/Obelisk-Nu sits a large marble fountain adored with several decorative cherubs. These cherubs are severely damaged, leaking a steady stream of crimson liquid. This substance flows freely around A/Obelisk-Nu, forming a spiral of liquid around its form. 

**45.36.43:** The members of MTF-Nu-π each draw their conceptualized version of high-volume weaponry.  π-1 targets A/Obelisk-Nu and -4, -5, -7, and -12 each target one of the four pillars.[[footnote]]The four pillars were determined to be a crucial components of Obelisk-Nu, and it was suspected that the anomaly would not be neutralized unless the pillars were destroyed as well.[[/footnote]] A/Obelisk-Nu begins to release a high pitched scream as its body fractures apart, fragments exploding outward, freezing in midair before exploding again. Gravity returns to normal and MTF-Nu-π fall back towards the ground. The birds nesting within the pillars take flight and begin to follow them.

As MTF-Nu-π fall, the buildings beneath them begin to collapse. Glass shards begin to rain upwards, randomly phasing in and out of existence as they rise, becoming larger and more complex each time they reappear. The shards impact one another and explode into clouds of piano keys, which burst into flames. A deep thrumming is heard, matching the tunes hummed by π-4 earlier.  This thrumming gets louder and more dissonant as MTF-Nu-π approaches the ground. 

MTF-Nu-π impact the ground, which folds and cracks beneath them. Upon impact, π-9's body instantaneously liquefies, while the rest of MTF-Nu-π sustain only minor injuries. Golden flames begin to seep from between the cracks, causing π-9's liquefied form to twist and cauterize, forming an amalgam of charred flesh vaguely resembling a grand piano. Thousands of disembodied hands emerge from the collapsing building, attempting to collectively push the ground back together. Where the fire makes contact with the hands they begin shrieking, before decaying into pools of brass, string, and luminescent flowers.

The pyramid rises up from the center of the city, strings dragging the screaming trumpet-headed entities with it, many of which are on fire.  MTF-Nu-π begin to run towards the bridge as the birds released from the pillars catch up with and begin to swarm them. The birds are dispatched by the MTF, although one of the birds catches π-12 on the shoulder and her flesh contorts and blooms, spreading apart and cascading recursively into itself.  π-12 is unimpeded by this, and continues to run as the effect spreads across her entire body. The birds behind them begin to fall apart into piles of shattered piano keys and broken glass, releasing large bursts of cloud to ground lightning. 

MTF-Nu-π reach the bridge and begin to cross back to the elevator. They make it across when the bridge begins to tear and collapse into the molten brass surrounding it. The city is now engulfed in flame, and both the ground and sky begin to fold along the inside of a massive sphere. MTF-Nu-π quickly enter the elevator and begin their ascent.  

As the elevator ascends the entities seen during its descent emerge from the brass ocean, reaching and clawing for the elevator.  They are unable to reach it, and scream as they each shatter into golden fragments of glassy light, which spiral down into the ocean and explode.  The ground and sky continue to get closer to the elevator as the construct collapses in on itself.  They impact the elevator and everything goes dark.

**52.43.21:** The elevator dings, and opens onto the glass platform MTF-Nu-π originally entered on.  Above the platform floats a single piano key, dripping with golden fluid.  The key depresses once and dissolves entirely.  The dripping liquid forms a small pool, out of which grows a single white flower comprised of glass.  The flower blooms, revealing D-4966's face in its center.  The face sheds a single tear, and the flower and pool fade out of existence.

**52.46.30:** MTF-Nu-π contact Command, and are extracted from Obelisk-Nu.

**Afterward:** π-9 did not appear with the rest of MTF-Nu-π, despite his presence throughout the footage. His whereabout are currently unknown. π-12 reverted back to her normal physical state upon return, but was capable of replicating the bird's anomalous effects on her and those near her.  π-12 was quarantined and screened for any additional anomalous effects or residual SCP-5000 connections. Further testing of SCP-5000 is prohibited.
