**Name:** Baron Silberescher, D.SPAaVOCFoL

**Security Clearance:** Level 0

**Facility**: None (Castle Silberescher)

**Profile**: Dr. Alphonse Davison Augustin Jakobs Lemuria Silberescher, Baron of [REDACTED], Lord Knowledge, Savior of Ocelots, and Spellshaper of the Boros Legion,  known alternately as “Alfie”, “Davey”, “Augie”, “Jake”, “Lemmy”, “Silber”, “Barry”, “Doc”, and "Old Sliderule", is a noble residing in the minute principality [REDACTED], located in southeastern Europe. In 20██, Foundation agents entered contact with Baron Silberescher after locating anomalous radio signals emanating from the noble’s barony. The Baron, after a period of negotiation over brandy and chocolates, willingly handed over the object responsible for the emissions [now designated SCP-███], and offered to maintain a connection with the Foundation, citing knowledge of several anomalous objects, both in the Baron’s custody and being tracked down by the noble’s servants. Agents provided a telephone number through which the Baron could contact a Foundation branch in Lithuania; Silberescher graciously accepted and indicated the intent to install a telephone system in the barony as soon as possible. Roughly two weeks after the incident, Baron Silberescher contacted the branch, providing a specimen of the species known as SCP-████.

Baron Silberescher bears an avid interest in scientific research, especially in the subject of anomalous objects. He claims to study such items as a pastime, and explained in a conversation with Agent █████ that experimentation with such items is rigorous and only concludes when the Baron “exhausts their mysteries”. In addition, the credentials he possesses are questionable at best. Silberescher’s degree is a “Doctorate of Science, Philosophy, the Arts, and Various Other Celebrated Fields of Learning”, a fictitious program offered exclusively to the noble by a nearby university. The Baron has claimed that, although he identifies as a doctor, the honorific imparted by a D.SPAaVOCFoL is actually “Lord Knowledge”. He also related an anecdote in which an aspiring biologist named Szalek █████████ somehow signed up for and completed the program, then was appointed "Lord Knowledge". The young man was commended and executed.

The study of anomalous objects is one of A.D.A.J.L. Silberescher's numerous pastimes. The Baron is also, among other things, a cultivator of exotic plants and animals, a charcoal artist, a welder, an avid player of the card game Magic: the Gathering (records indicate that he is a level 21 planeswalker, known as a "spellshaper"), a rapper who released an album under his own label (using the pseudonym "Amateur Knight") and the world's leading collector of memorabilia relating to the 1984 film //The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension//.

Agents of the Lithuanian facility Site 61 are to pursue an amiable relationship with Baron Silberescher, due to his cooperative nature and his apparent connections in regard to the location of items relevant to Foundation interests. Female agents are to accept all gifts provided by Silberescher, including chocolate, ocelots, and street names. Male agents are to participate with the Baron in any sporting events or other physical pursuits which he offers the agent, including elk hunting, chessboxing, and mensur.
