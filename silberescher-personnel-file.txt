**Name:** Baron Silberescher, D.SPAaVOCFoL

**Security Clearance:** Level 0

**Facility**: None (Castle Silberescher)

**Profile**: Baron Doctor Alphonse Davison Augustin Jakobs Lemuria Silberescher, known alternately as “Alfie”, “Davey”, “Augie”, “Jake”, “Lemmy”, “Silber”, “Barry”, “Doc”, and "Old Sliderule", is a noble residing in the minute principality [REDACTED], located in southeastern Europe. In 20██, Foundation agents entered contact with Baron Silberescher after locating anomalous radio signals emanating from the noble’s barony. The Baron, after a period of negotiation over brandy and chocolates, willingly handed over the object responsible for the emissions [now designated SCP-███], and offered to maintain a connection with the Foundation, citing knowledge of several anomalous objects, both in the Baron’s custody and being tracked down by the noble’s servants. Agents provided a telephone number through which the Baron could contact a Foundation branch in Lithuania; Silberescher graciously accepted and indicated the intent to install a telephone system in the barony as soon as possible. Roughly two weeks after the incident, Baron Silberescher contacted the branch, providing a specimen of the species known as SCP-████.

Baron Silberescher bears an avid interest in scientific research, especially in the subject of anomalous objects. He claims to study such items as a pastime, and explained in a conversation with Agent █████ that experimentation with such items is rigorous and only concludes when the Baron “exhausts their mysteries”. In addition, the credentials he possesses are questionable at best. Silberescher’s degree is a “Doctorate of Science, Philosophy, the Arts, and Various Other Celebrated Fields of Learning”, a fictitious program offered exclusively to the noble by a nearby university. The Baron has claimed that, although he identifies as a doctor, the honorific imparted by a D.SPAaVOCFoL is actually “Baron”, making his official title “Baron Baron Silberescher”. He also related an anecdote in which an aspiring biologist named Szalek █████████ somehow signed up for and completed the program, thus becoming “Baron Szalek █████████”. The young man was commended and executed.

Foundation agents of the Lithuanian facility Site 61 are to pursue an amiable relationship with Baron Silberescher, due to his cooperative nature and his apparent connections in regard to the location of items relevant to Foundation interest. Female agents are to accept all gifts provided by Silberescher, including chocolates, furniture, and street names. Male agents are to participate with the Baron in any sporting events or other physical pursuits which he offers the agent, including elk hunting, chessboxing, and mensur.
