**Item #:** SCP-005

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-005 poses no immediate risk in any direct sense. Even so, its unique functions require special measures be taken to restrict access and manipulation of the object. Approval of at least one (1) Level 4 personnel is required for the removal of the object from its containment area.

**Description:** In appearance, SCP-005 resembles an ornate key, displaying the characteristics of a typical mass produced key used in the 1920s. The key was discovered when a civilian used it to infiltrate a high security facility. SCP-005 seems to have the unique ability to open any and all forms of lock (See Appendix A), be they mechanical or digital, with relative ease. The origin of this ability has yet to be determined.

**Additional Notes:** SCP-005 may be used as a replacement for lost security passes, but only under the supervision of at least one (1) Level 4 personnel. SCP-005 may not be used for vending machine repairs, opening lockers, or for any personnel's spare home key. Removal of the object from the compound will result in immediate termination.

**Appendix A:** While SCP-005 has been shown to be effective in removing almost any form of locking device, further experiments have shown that efforts to disguise the purpose or identity of a lock have proven at least somewhat successful in defeating SCP-005's ability. In approximately 50% of cases where a volunteer was not able to identify a locking device as such, SCP-005 was not successful in deactivating the device. Due to these results, SCP-005 has been tentatively classified as 'sentient' and further tests are being run to determine its cognitive abilities. However, there are no results that show any traits that prevent it from being able to identify any particular locking device, only that the aforementioned device has been heavily concealed and disguised.

**Appendix B:** Following incident (SCP-????-J/SCP-005)-DIS, any skeleton keys found in any sites or areas are to be transported to Site-19.  When the key arrives at Site-19, protocol P-([SCP-????-J/SCP-005]-DIS)-T[[footnote]] //Did we// really //have to make the protocol name that long?// -Dr. Bright [[/footnote]] is to be initiated.

**Protocol P-([SCP-????-J/SCP-005]-DIS)-T:** The skeleton key that has been found will be given to a D-Class personnel, who will then, in a standard containment unit, attempt to open an untampered combination lock.  If the key opens the lock, it is to be  re-designated as SCP-005.  Otherwise, the key is to be transferred to non-anomalous item storage in Site-19.  In the event that the key is found to be anomalous, but not in the way SCP-005 --was-- is anomalous, it is to be designated as SCP-XXXX (where XXXX is whatever number is next free in the SCP database).
