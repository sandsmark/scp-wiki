++++ **__Special Containment Procedures__**
SCP-5202 is held within Site-51's Underground Item Storage Vault-3. The vault has been fitted with a Lexon-Anderson Vacuum Array (LAVA), to ensure 100% auditory cancelation. 

If the LAVA experiences a loss of power or mechanical malfunction, all personnel on Site-51's sublevels one through six are to wear Class-2a auditory protection headsets until containment is reestablished.

The Site-51 PoI Apprehension Unit is to continue tracking PoI-5202/A and PoI-5202/B to facilitate their capture.
[[/div]]
[[div class="addenda-header"]]
++++ **__Description__**
SCP-5202 is a synthetic fowl imitation prop enhanced by a continuous audiothurgic process, housed within its internal acoustic device. This process amplifies SCP-5202's auditory function to 170-190 decibels. SCP-5202 is highly damage resistant and there is currently no known method of deactivating it.
[[/div]]
[[div class="addenda-header"]]
++++ **__Discovery__**
SCP-5202 came to Foundation attention when assets in the Ohio State Police reported a strange auditory phenomenon affecting the town of Cadbern. Civilians filed several noise complaints regarding a loud "croaking noise" that could be heard for miles. Local residence believed the sound originated from the Duepur Corporation's[[footnote]] A nationwide manufacturer and distributor of poultry meat products.[[/footnote]] headquarters, located 3.2 km West of Cadbern. The OSP assets forwarded an audio file of the event, background noise has been removed for clarity:

Mobile Task Force Mu-24 ("Hear no Evil") was deployed to locate and contain the source of the phenomenon. The following is a video transcript of SCP-5202's recovery:

The Site-51 Medical Department began treating the Duepur employees immediately upon arrival. All 71 employees received substantial damage to their eardrums, as well as psychological trauma.

++++ **__Investigation__**
The following day, the Foundation intercepted a Hallmark apology card addressed to the Duepur headquarters. The card was signed by a Peter Winship (designated PoI-5202/A) and included the handwritten message "I never meant for this to happen, I'm so sorry."

An investigation of PoI-5202/A's home led to the discovery of the following messages regarding SCP-5202, found on his personal computer.
