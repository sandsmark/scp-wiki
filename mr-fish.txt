Sometimes I like to sit in the water and just think. I like this place. It's peaceful. Wet.

It's warm outside. Cloudy. I like the clouds.

I have brothers and sisters, I think. We’re not normal. We were made. Like an old monster movie. The magic of science. Lightning in a castle. Magic science. 

It's getting windy outside. 

Dr Wondertainment made us and can remake us. But I wonder. When we die, are we changed? Was I changed?  Am I the same person from back then or was that one changed? Will I be brought back or will I be lost? Can I carry memories on? Or are they just little knobs on a machine that you can switch on and off? I know there’s been more Misters made since the first edition. Mister Redd’s the only original one left. 

I don’t think I should have said his name. I should hide somewhere.

I’m scared sometimes. I’m scared of what’s coming. I'm scared one of them will find me. I'm scared of Redd and Stripes. They'll kill me. I don't want to die. I want to stay here in my swamp...

It's raining now. I like the rain. 

But I still wonder. Am I an option or a miracle? What am I? 

… I think I know what I am. I am Mister Fish. I am me. I am content.
