**Disturbance Event Description:** An avalanche of snow suddenly stopped for 11 hours, directly above a small skiing site in Fairbanks, Alaska. After the initial stop, animate snowmen began walking into the town, assaulting residents, and taking them to the ski community.

Agents who were sent to Alaska found that all evidence of the event had been destroyed by the snow, making suppression of information easier than expected.
