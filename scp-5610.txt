**Item #:** 5610

**Containment Class:**  Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5610 events are to be minimally monitored.

Meanwhile, a study of all cultures with a particular focus on shame and facades [[footnote]]Such as Japanese //honmae// and //tatemae//, which revolve around public and private appearances.[[/footnote]] is to be initiated for any relations with SCP-5610. All historical documents related to felines are to be also investigated.

**Description:**  SCP-5610 is an anomalous entity that is only observable by individuals with a cognitive resistance value of 5.6 and above. Approximately 56 percent of Japan's population has been found to have an instance of SCP-5610 resting atop of their head. However, no discomfort is felt by the subject these instances are resting on.

As a subject's behavior in public becomes more congruent to their behavior in private, the instance of SCP-5610 becomes increasingly detailed. This continues until it produces one of two results: either the instance would vanish, or in approximately six percent of all cases, it transforms into a non-anomalous cat(//Felis catus//) and jumps off the subject's head.

SCP-5610 is prominently featured in haikus; living authors, when questioned, remember it. Notable ones are translated below.
