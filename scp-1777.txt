**Item #:** SCP-1777

**Object Class:** Safe (Change to Neutralized under O5 review)

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the public nature of SCP-1777-2, and the rarity/safe nature of SCP-1777-1, SCP-1777 is for the most part, uncontained. Site-E13 is to remained staffed at all times, with remote surveillance of SCP-1777-2 to occur on a 24 hour basis. Should SCP-1777-1 make an appearance to a visitor, Site staff are to record any commentary made, then dispatch a team which is to include two security members dressed as tour guides, and one dressed so as to resemble SCP-1777-1. Suggested cover story is that the agent so dressed is a re-enactor with a local troupe, and was playing a role. Should the visitor be disinclined to believe the cover story, use of stun guns and amnesiacs are approved.

Researchers are encouraged not to attempt interaction with SCP-1777-2.

**Description:** SCP-1777-1 is an apparent specter that is known to appear at SCP-1777-2. It manifests as a two meter male human, dressed from head to toe in rusty plate armor, of a variety common in England during the 15th century. Several simple markings are scratched into the armor, the same symbols which appears inside SCP-1777-2. Clasped in its hands is a cross hilted longsword approximately 1.5 meter long, bearing a double fuller style blade. The word '//Veritas//[[footnote]]Truth.[[/footnote]]' has been carved across the hilt. It has so far proven impossible to touch 1777-1 in any way.

SCP-1777-2 is the natural structure known as King's Cave, on Arran Island, in Scotland. The main inner pillar is carved with many symbols, including a man holding what appears to be a bow over his head, and another that seems to depict a sword. Testing has proven anything carved on this column will show up on the armor of SCP-1777-1 when it appears.

SCP-1777-1 appears to be triggered by the presence of any direct descendant of any of the kings of England. This does not extend to descendants of queens. When such a person enters SCP-1777-2, SCP-1777-1 appears, and seems to study them for a moment. It will then speak in what has been identified as a dialect of Latin, '//Puer de// (insert ancestor king's name) //est non tempus//[[footnote]]Child of ( ) it is not your time.[[/footnote]]' before vanishing. It is unsure why this is done, but whenever possible, known descendants of kings are kept away from SCP-1777-2.

SCP-1777-1 has so far never been wrong in its determination of lineage.

**Addendum 1:** On 03/24/2006, D-86701, a descendant of Sweyn Forkbeard, was brought into SCP-1777-2. Upon the appearance of SCP-1777-1, Senior Researcher Janus attempted to interview it. He continuously interrupted it for several minutes, causing SCP-1777-1 to stay manifested for longer then it ever had before.  At this point SCP-1777-1 interacted with its environment for the first time, backhanding the researcher, breaking his jaw. It spoke the following words in Latin '//Stultus bestia, relinquere me ad meum munus.//[[footnote]]Foolish beast, leave me to my task.[[/footnote]]' It then finished its statement to D-86701, and vanished.

Since this event, SCP-1777-1 has failed to materialize whenever an SCP researcher or other operative has accompanied a prospective visitor.

**Addendum 2:** On 07/12/2011, a visitor later identified as Bernard Scrivens, 23, of  Sussex, England, made his way into SCP-1777-2. No staff were currently on site, but were watching the video feeds. 1777-1 appeared as normal, but instead of speaking, it handed its sword to Scrivens, and left. A team was dispatched to contain the site, and determine what had happened. Upon arrival, the team was attacked by the man. Although non-lethal force was used, the stun guns triggered a heart attack in Scrivens, which led to his death. At this point SCP-1777-1 reappeared, and spoke '//Requiesce in pace Arturus, sic finit Camelot.//[[footnote]]Rest in peace Arthur, so ends Camelot.[[/footnote]]' 1777-1 has not reappeared since this incident.

The sword is awaiting classification pending determination of anomalous properties.
