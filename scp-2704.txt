**Special Containment Procedures:** Confirmed or hypothesized villages in which SCP-2704 has taken place are to be attended to immediately by emergency response teams. Social media platforms and other online forums are to be searched by multiple web crawlers for mentions which might confirm an instance of SCP-2704 taking place. Any surviving subjects of SCP-2704 are to be amnesticised upon return, and other documentation regarding an SCP-2704 event are to be removed by whatever means necessary. Instances of SCP-2704-1 are not to be killed on contact.

If any information about SCP-2704 spreads to scales futile to deletion, campaigns and cover stories are to be written and spread internationally.

**Description:** SCP-2704 refers to an event which occurs to all living organic matter within villages in the U.S. states of Nebraska, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Wyoming, Oklahoma, and Alaska with an even population below 400, in which all organic organisms[[footnote]] This includes any possessions which are directly touching a victim of SCP-2704.[[/footnote]] within the limits of the town are translocated instantaneously to a seemingly random planet located within the Andromeda Galaxy, regardless of size or composition, which will then replace Earth's moon.

SCP-2704 can occur within the hours of 0:00 through 3:00, and will only occur if every resident within the town is in an unconscious state. Once SCP-2704 has occured, any organic matter translocated will not be affected by any toxins in the atmosphere or any other harmful conditions of the planet. Regardless of the circumstances, the tides of the Earth, as well as the appearance of the Moon itself, will remain as such before SCP-2704 has occurred.

In place of the victims of SCP-2704's last position on Earth, a //supella longipalpa//[[footnote]]Known non-scientifically as the brown-banded cockroach.[[/footnote]] of the same height and weight as its human counterpart will spawn in place of the victim, now referred to as instances of SCP-2704-1. For the next ~20 hours, instances of SCP-2704-1 will begin to deconstruct furniture, houses, or any other infrastructure and produce provisional weapons. Depending on the time of the event, the types or design of the weapons may change.

After ~20 hours have passed, Instances of SCP-2704-1 will equally divide into groups of two. These groups will hereafter be referred to as a 'pair'.  After this event has occurred, one pair will fight with their weapons to the death. These individual battles will happen in succession with each other until there has been a winner of each pair, after which the winning instances of SCP-2704-1 will again form into pairs and individually fight to the death once again. This will continue until there is just one instance of SCP-2704-1 alive. If an instance of SCP-2704-1 dies, its human counterpart will also perish.

When there is only one instance of SCP-2704-1 alive, its human counterpart will then replace it. After this, the planet replacing the moon will then revert back to its normal location, and the Moon will return back to its normal position with no side-effects.

**Addendum 04-1:** On April 1st, 2017, a SCP-2704 event occured in a small military camp located in northern Alaska. Located within the camp were several tons of explosives. After the victims of SCP-2704 were translocated to the planet, instances of SCP-2704-1 began to acquire and construct rudimentary weapons from the camp, and eventually damage the explosives, causing several explosions resulting in 18 fatalities and 28 injuries in the nearby town of Haresberg. A cover-up story was produced stating that there had been a malfunction during production, causing a domino effect of other explosions. All SCP-2704-1 instances were killed in the blast.
