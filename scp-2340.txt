**Item #:** SCP-2340

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Volcanoes are to be monitored for increased activity, which may signify an emergence event. Civilians are to be notified that the area is subject to frequent seismic and volcanic activity, and thus is off limits. Civilian reports of SCP-2340 are to be dismissed as rockslides caused by tremors. Personnel interacting with SCP-2340 are to wear standard foundation heat resistant gear. Approximately 16 hours after a SCP-2340 instance emerges, members of Mobile Task force Epsilon-9 (Fire Eaters) are to remove SCP 2340-A from SCP-2340 by spraying the body with water cooler than 20 degrees Celcius and cutting out SCP-2340-A.

**Description:** SCP-2340 designates a species of mineral based organisms which appear to be capable of living in the earth's mantle. The body of SCP-2340 instances are composed of a central ovoid with 4 fins around the center. At the end of each fin is a smaller ovaloid. SCP 2340 does not appear to have a front or back, and is capable of locomotion in multiple directions. Instances do not possess any distinguishable reproductive or sensory organs other than 2 holes in its main shell. These holes are capable of propelling high pressure lava, which is hypothesized to the main form of transportation of SCP-2340 in the mantle. The mean length is typically 300 meters long, with a mean diameter of 100 meters. However, instances that range up to a kilometer have been noted. 

The minerals which SCP-2340 is composed of appear similar in structure to quartz, although they are noted to have significantly higher heat resistance and durability. The outer structure appears similar in arrangement to rectangular armored plating, and individual plates overlap each other.  Most of the minerals have been tested to have heat resistance of at least 1200 degrees Celsius, although they are prone to fracture and damage at under 40 degrees Celsius. Inside of SCP-2340 are valves and pipes similar in function to the human heart, which transport magma. This magma apparently functions as blood for SCP-2340 instances, which die when the magma hardens.

SCP-2340 instances are only found near areas currently experiencing large amounts of volcanic eruptions. Typically, there will be a lull period in the amount of eruptions. Shortly after, the volcano will release a significantly larger blast, pushing an SCP-2340 instance out. SCP-2340 instances generally survive for only a day outside the crust, after which the internal magma flow begins to slow down and harden. Oftentimes, an SCP-2340 instance will attempt to crawl back into the volcano. This has only succeeded once, with SCP-2340-8 reentering the mantle.

Approximately 2 hours before dying, SCP-2340 instances will often produce an electromagnetic pulse by rapidly pumping magma past an organ (designated SCP-2340-A) located near the center of their mass. This is hypothesized to be a distress call, as volcanoes which have SCP-2340 produce such pulses generally are 10% more likely to have another emergence event than a volcano not marked. In order to prevent more SCP-2340 instances from emerging, members of Mobile Task force Epsilon-9 (Fire Eaters) are to surgically remove SCP-2340-A from the main body roughly 16 hours after emergence. However, because internal magma will still be liquid as this point, care must be taken to not disturb main arteries. After 24 hours, internal magma will have cooled to the degree that a full autopsy can be fully carried out.


**Incident 2340-507**: On ██/█/20██, SCP-2340-8 emerged from Mount. ████████ in Indonesia. During its 4 hours above surface, it continuously dug at the sides of the mountain. At 16:43 hrs, Mount. ████████ erupted again due to collapse of the caldera. Afterwards, SCP-2340-8 was no longer present, and Mount. ████████ has not experienced another emergence event.
