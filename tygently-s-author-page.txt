title:Dr. Ty███ Gently's Personnel File
**Name:** Dr. Ty███ S. Gently

**Security Clearance:** Level 3

**Position:** Researcher, Department of Memetics and Cognitohazards

**Current Location:** Mail Room, Site-77

**History:** Dr. Gently was recruited by the Foundation following the ██████ University incident, of which he was the only survivor (Gently cites "not looking at the dreadlords, seriously, did anyone else see raiders of the lost ark?" as the primary reason for his survival). Deemed a possible asset to the Foundation, Gently received an education in memetics and cognitohazards. He is, by definition, unable to comprehend or process this education in any way except through recurring nightmares.

Hi, I'm TyGently (pronounced "tie-gently"). I've been a part of this community since late 2014 and writing articles since spring 2015. I'm male and Canadian, and can typically be found in the SCP IRC channel #site19, or in #scpmafia. I'm generally willing to critique article drafts whenever I can, tale drafts somewhat less so because I have less experience with tales.

Based on my current roster of articles, I seem to write a lot about memetics and space.

**Currently working on:** Nothing. Go away.
