**Item #:** SCP-3707

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3707 is kept at Site-81's anomalous motor pool and maintained as necessary to ensure drivability.

**Description:** SCP-3707 is a 2002 Toyota Camry with Minnesota plates. Anomalous properties manifest when occupied by exactly one human, who is driving it between 12 AM and 3 AM local time. Subjects report a mild compulsion to drive SCP-3707 away from their place of residence, with no ultimate destination in mind. Should this compulsion be followed for at least one hour, SCP-3707 and its occupant will disappear when unobserved. SCP-3707 will be found abandoned near a roadway at least 805 kilometers away from the disappearance point. No subject has ever been recovered.

All tested individuals (including family, coworkers, etc.) are indifferent to the subject's disappearance, experiencing no distress and often failing to alert relevant authorities. Individuals affected this way will report that they "respect [the subject's] decision", though they are unable or unwilling to elaborate further.

Within one week, the subject's roles in groups, organizations and interpersonal relationships will be filled with other individuals, with no decrease in overall functionality or wellbeing. This occurs through apparently mundane processes. After three months, individuals will not think about the subject unless prompted.

Occasionally, SCP-3707 will disappear from containment. In each case, a different vehicle with the same anomalous properties will be recovered within one week. This has occurred four times.

After the events detailed in Addendum 3707.3, testing is strictly prohibited unless approved by the Director of Site-81.

> **Equipment:** One (1) helmet-mounted camera, one (1) helmet-mounted microphone, one (1) fully loaded Beretta M9, two (2) magazines, and one (1) knife.
> **Purpose:** To ascertain what occurs when an individual is kept from starting SCP-3707.
>
> ------
>
> **<BEGIN LOG>**
> **Site-81 Command:** Agent Nora Wilkes, you may enter SCP-3707.
> //Wilkes complies with order.//
> **Agent Nora Wilkes:** Copy that. I have a funny feeling in my head...
> //Before Site-81 Command can respond, Wilkes displays a sudden desire to start the car. She reaches for the ignition.//
> **Site-81 Command:** Agent, DO NOT START THE CAR. We repeat, DO NOT START THE CAR.
> //Agent Nora Wilkes shows sudden agitation at this order.//
> **Wilkes:** Please let me start the car.
> //Worried that Wilkes will start the car, Site-81 Command sends two security officers (now designated S81-1 and S-81-2) to physically restrain Wilkes.//
> **Wilkes:** No! Please let me go! LET ME GO!
> //Site-Command does not allow Wilkes to start the car. Wilkes then has a heart attack and expires of cardiac arrest. Site-Command orders an immediate termination of the experiment. The body is taken to the lab for study.// **//Level 3 personnel and above can access the autopsy report below.//**

> **Addendum 3707.11:** Wilkes Autopsy Report
> **Cause of death:** Cardiac arrest.
> **Notes:** Examination of Wilkes' brain showed that her brain was filled with a strange gloppy     substance. Examination of the substance shows that it is filled with brain-controlling parasites. It is thought that this substance fills a subject's brain when they activate SCP-3707. The substance has been designated as SCP-3707-2.

> **Date:** 4/21/2003
> **Subject:** D-8134[[footnote]] D-8134 was not informed of SCP-3707's nature. [[/footnote]]
> **Equipment:** One (1) microphone, one (1) camera, one (1) fully loaded Beretta M9, two (2) magazines, one (1) sleeping bag, and enough food and water to last for 96 hours.
> **Purpose:** To observe what happens after a subject disappears due to SCP-3707.
>
> ------
>
> **<BEGIN LOG>**
> **Site-81 Command:** Subject D-8134, enter SCP-3707.
> **D-8134:** Roger that.
> //D-8134 complies with the order.//
> **Site-81 Command:** We would like you to report anything you see while driving SCP-3707. Let us know if you see anything out of the ordinary.
> **D-8134:** Okay. Right now I'm driving down [REDACTED] Road, and everything is normal.
> //Camera feed confirms this. D-8134 drives silently down [REDACTED] Road for 2 minutes before turning onto State Route 446.//
> **D-8134:** I just noticed, I've got a funny feeling in my head.
> //At this time, one of the researchers in the control room notice a strange green fluid flowing on the shotgun seat, presumably SCP-3707-2.//
> **Site-81 Command:** D-8134, do you notice anything on the shotgun seat?
> **D-8134:** Nope.
> //Command assumes that D-8134 is under the influence of a cognitohazard. Silence for 5 minutes. As SCP-3707 is crossing the bridge over Monroe Lake, Command notices that Lake Monroe is filled with SCP-3707-2.//
> **Site-81 Command:** D-8134, take a look at the lake. Notice anything weird?
> **D-8134:** No, I don't see anything unusual. Why?
> **Site-81 Command:** Well, we asked you to report anything unusual.
> **D-8134:** But I don't //see// anything weird!
> //It is presumed that D-8134 is under the influence of the aforementioned cognitohazard, now known as SCP-3707-3. Senior Researcher █████ infers that SCP-3707-3 is caused by the presence of SCP-3707-2. This is thought to be the reason that SCP-3707-2 was not seen by S-81-1 and S-81-2 during the previous experiments.//
> **D-8134:** I have a weird headache...Never mind, it's gone now.
> //Silence for 15 more minutes. SCP-3707 enters Bloomington proper and turns left onto Third Street.//
> **D-8134:** Oh... A lot of houses are boarded up here.
> //The camera confirms this, but later review of traffic camera footage shows no abnormalities. This means that either the camera is somehow affected by SCP-3707-3, or that SCP-3707 'duplicates' itself into another dimension, since SCP-3707 was seen on the traffic camera footage.//
> **Site-81 Command:** D-8134, turn onto North Jordan Avenue.
> //D-8134 does so, taking him onto the Bloomington University campus.//
> **D-8134:** Ohhh...I went here when I was ██![[footnote]] Research on D-8134's background shows that she never went to Bloomington University. [[/footnote]]
> **Site-81 Command:** D-8134, do you notice anything weird?
> **D-8134:** What the [EXPLETIVE]? The students are...like...just...WRONG.
> //The camera shows that the students have rotting faces and ripped clothing.//
> **Site-81 Command:** Never mind that. Just turn onto East Seventeenth Street when you reach it.
> **D-8134:** Just what the actual [EXPLETIVE]? The train driver is just WRONG.
> //The camera shows no train, but a strange entity similar to the students is seen walking down the tracks. These entities are hereby identified as SCP-3707-4.//
> **Site-81 Command:** Ignore anything strange you see. We would like to inform you that you are under the effects of a cognitohazard.
> **D-8134:** A cogno-//what?//
> **Site-81 Command:** Basically your brain is being played with by something. Maybe someone.
> //D-8134 goes into a panic as she turns onto East Seventeenth Street and as 30 minutes elapse.
She drives past Memorial Stadium.//
> **Site-81 Command:** Do you notice anything about the stadium?
> **D-8134:** The athletes are like the weird things I saw earlier. The cheerleaders are dressed as coffins.
> //D-8134 continues driving. She crosses the intersection with Walnut Street and College Avenue, onto West Seventeenth Street. She enters a roundabout and starts driving around it indefinitely.//
> **Site-81 Command:** D-8134, please do not deviate from the mission. Find your way to Interstate 69.
> **D-8134:** Okay. Interstate 69...
> //D-8134 giggles.//[[footnote]] D-8134 is giggling at the number 69, for all you nosy Junior Researchers who have clearance they shouldn't have reading this. [[/footnote]]
> **Site-81 Command:** We know, we know. Just ignore it.
> //D-8134 regains her composure, drives up West Arlington Road, turns onto West Gourley Pike, then North Monroe Street, before finally driving down State Route 46.//
> **Site-81 Command:** The interchange for I-69 is coming up.
> **D-8134: I know.**
> //At precisely 45 minutes elapsed time, D-8134 merges onto I-69 North.//
> **D-8134:** There's a flipped semi near the Walnut Street onramp... HOLY [EXPLETIVE]!
> **Site-81 Command:** What?
> **D-8134:** There's a [EXPLETIVE] horde of green muck[[footnote]] SCP-3707-2. [[/footnote]] flowing out of it. And something is growing out of the muck... THOSE WEIRD [EXPLETIVE] THINGS![[footnote]] SCP-3707-4. [[/footnote]]
> //D-8134 enters into such a panic that she loses control of her car, goes tumbling into the forest, and is knocked out. D-8134 stays in such a state for 7 more minutes before 1 hour elapses and SCP-3707 disappears with the camera, microphone, and D-8134.//
> **Site-81 Command:** D-8134, do you copy?
> //Silence.//
> **Site-81 Command:** D-8134, we repeat, do you copy?
> //Silence for five minutes, after which, the camera feed and the mic feed come back on. D-8134 is floating in a void, unconscious. SCP-3707 is seen floating in the background. Also floating are other people known to have been lost to SCP-3707, including Former Assistant Director of Containment ████ █████████. Behind each one of the floating people is a copy of SCP-3707. This suggests that SCP-3707 does not 'respawn' but rather duplicates itself for someone to find.//

> **Barre:** Did you notice anything unusual during your trip back to the garage?
> ████: Me? No, it was your...//usual// trip to the garage.
> **Barre:** Is there something you're hiding from me?
> ████: Please, no. I don't want to talk about this.
> **Barre:** Please, we just want to know what happened.
> ████: Your foundation doesn't need to know what happened.
> **Barre:** Excuse me?
> ████: Thought I didn't know? Well, when my friend ██████ hooked the car up, he ran back to me and told me ALL about your foundation. Hahahaha... I could tell you about [[[SCP-096]]], or [[[SCP-2958]]], or even [[[SCP-3707.]]]
