**Item #:** SCP-027-J

**Object Class:** --##e00221|Safe##-- --##06789b|Euclid##-- --##e00221|Safe##-- --##06789b|Euclid##-- ##19890f|Keter##

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-027-J is to be contained --##06789b|on the couch##-- --##e00221|in the proper holder that I spent like thirty goddamned dollars on, designated SCP-027-J-1.##--  --##06789b|(SCP-027-J-1 is a cheap piece of plastic you paid too much money on, and shall be designated SCP-027-J-$).##-- at the Benson household,--##e00221|even though it's probably on fucking Jupiter half the time.##-- until further notice.

When SCP-027-J switches phase, --##e00221|Researcher Benson is to be consulted as to where the hell she left it##-- --##06789b|Researcher Benson is to calm the hell down, it's just a remote.##-- SCP-027-J is to be placed in the proper receptacle. --##06789b|(I swear to god, Phil, don't say a goddamned word).##--

**Description:** SCP-027-J is a --##e00221|Roku##-- --##06789b|Cable Box##-- --##e00221|Roku##-- --##06789b|Cable Box##-- Television Remote Control, which appears to have two quantum states: 
* An R-2787 Roku Remote control (Designated SCP-027-J-A) for a [REDACTED] model television --##e00221|which was so goddamned expensive##-- --##06789b|which was on sale, and you agree on##--, manufactured in 2015.
* A FIOS-27 Cable Box remote (Designated SCP-027-J-B) --##e00221|which is goddamned useless, because we have netflix, hulu, and amazon prime##-- --##06789b|which is necessary because ADULTS HAVE CABLE.##--

At no time can SCP-027-J exist in both states, --##e00221|because Researcher Benson can't keep track of the goddamned remotes when she's watching her "programs"##-- --##06789b|due to its anomalous effect of making Researcher Benson a dickhead##-- due to its anomalous effect.

SCP-027-J was first discovered when after installing the new Roku TV in the living room, when --##06789b|Researcher Benson immediately lost the Roku remote##-- the Roku remote went missing.  After two weeks, the Roku remote was discovered, and --##e00221|the cable box remote promptly dissapeared##-- --##06789b|Researcher Benson lost my remote, to stop me from watching dance moms##-- SCP-027-J changed quantum states, leading to the discovery of the nature of SCP-027-J.


**Addendum A** On [REDACTED] --##e00221|For god's sake Jillian, stop redacting my notes##-- --##06789b|no##--, it was discovered that both the cable box and the Roku have smartphone apps, which can control both devices.   --##e00221|Researcher Benson kindly installed these apps, and set them up on both his, and Researcher Benson's smartphones##-- Both applications were installed, and SCP-027-J's effect --##e00221|now appears to extend to Researcher Benson's phone now too, since that's either dead or missing all the time##--  --##06789b|For fuck's sake Phil, it's not that big of a deal, when I'm home.  Just stop losing the goddamned remotes!##--  Research in to the spread of SCP-027-J's effect --##e00221|and Jillian's inability to keep track of a THOUSAND DOLLAR PHONE##-- --##06789b|It was 450, you giant crybaby.##-- is ongoing.
