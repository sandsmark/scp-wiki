**Item #:** SCP-3409

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3409 has been hermetically sealed to inhibit the spread of SCP-3409-A. An outer perimeter fence topped with barbed-wire has been established. As the structure is located in a remote location, additional security measures to deter civilians are unnecessary. Nevertheless, warning signs indicating a chemical hazard are placed along the perimeter. An on-site security team is to guard the structure against attempted retrieval by hostile agents. Use of lethal force is authorized.

Interaction with the structure requires use of a Level-A hazmat suit. Personnel assigned to SCP-3409 are to ensure that SCP-3409-A does not spread beyond the confines of the structure. If necessary, flamethrowers may be utilized to control and prevent the spread of SCP-3409-A.

The IV bags of the infected subjects currently within the structure are to be refilled daily. No attempts to retrieve said subjects are to be made, in order to preserve the diameter of SCP-3409-B for further study and exploration.

SCP-3409-B is to be monitored through CCTV, for any signs of unusual activity. Any unusual activity is to be reported to researchers of level 4 clearance or higher.

**Description:** SCP-3409 is an abandoned confection production facility located in ████, ██████. Prior to containment, the facility was under the maintenance of 21 hostile human subjects in hazmat suits, utilizing firearms to deter intruders. The aforementioned subjects were successfully apprehended or terminated during initial investigations of the anomaly. Interrogation of the subjects revealed them to be associated with a previously unknown cult.

The interior of SCP-3409 is infested with a previously unknown, invasive fungal organism of non-terrestrial origin, henceforth referred to as SCP-3409-A. The fungus is composed mostly of a chocolate-like substance that is infectious to human subjects. SCP-3409-A originates from a spacetime anomaly, henceforth referred to as SCP-3409-B, located in a modified central chamber within the structure. The fungus appears as a network of tendrils, clinging to any surface it spreads upon, with a growth rate of around 0.6 m per hour. This spread is facilitated by the absorption of nutrients from terrestrial organisms, including microorganisms.

SCP-3409-A infects a human subject through physical contact, injecting fungal material into the bloodstream through use of nematocysts. The fungus will affect the behavior of the subject within 42 hours, compelling them to travel to SCP-3409-B, regardless of location. Advanced stages of infection results in a subject incessantly speaking in an unknown language. The means to which the fungus achieves this is currently unknown. Testing on D-Class personnel indicate that self-preservation instincts and logical reasoning are severely impaired, and the subject may expire before reaching the destination.

Infected subjects will also develop tumorous growths in advanced stage infection, containing the chocolate substance found in SCP-3409-A. No form of treatment is known to reverse this process. These growths will regularly release spores capable of spreading the infection. Infection can also occur through ingestion of the chocolate produced within the tumors of infected subjects.

The central chamber of SCP-3409 contains 103 iron cages arranged around SCP-3409-B. --37-- 36 cages are occupied with live, adult humans[[footnote]]This group consists of 21 missing civilians,
 7 homeless individuals, 5 police officers, and 3 cult members.[[/footnote]]. All aforementioned subjects are under the influence of SCP-3409-A. Tendrils of SCP-3409-A are affixed to these subjects at various points, absorbing nutrients and the chocolate produced. The affected subjects are unaware of their surroundings, and are unable, or unwilling to respond to Foundation personnel[[footnote]]The subjects chant repeatedly as a result of the infection, ignoring all external stimuli.[[/footnote]]. Nutrition and hydration are provided to the subjects intravenously, with IV stands fitted on every cage. Attempts to remove a subject from SCP-3409-A will result in its expiration. When this occurs, the diameter of SCP-3409-B has been observed to decrease, indicating a direct relationship with the number of subjects affected by SCP-3409-A.

Prior to containment, the personnel managing the facility regularly harvested the chocolate from the bodies of the caged subjects, through surgical intervention. The harvested substance was then processed with the equipment present to produce consumable chocolate candy. The resulting chocolate was prepared in unmarked packaging, and stored for distribution to civilian populations. All instances have been confiscated by Foundation personnel. D-Class that consumed the chocolate during testing report that it is of high quality and good taste, before being infected by SCP-3409-A.

SCP-3409-B occupies a fixed location on the floor of the central chamber. It is stable, circular in shape with a diameter of roughly 1 m, and is believed to be an extrauniversal aperture. Only inanimate matter and SCP-3409-A are capable of passing through the anomaly. Study and exploration of the space beyond the anomaly is possible through use of remote controlled drones.

The area beyond SCP-3409-B is vast, with its full size currently impossible to determine. Video footage reveals that the area consists mostly of barren landscape consisting of sediment, although several non-terrestrial organisms have been observed. Low light levels are indicated[[footnote]]With the exception of light originating from the terrestrial side of SCP-3409-B.[[/footnote]] due to heavy concentrations of particles suspended within the atmosphere. Larger particles of undetermined origin are observed to constantly descend from the upper atmosphere, bearing a resemblance to "marine snow". No vegetation capable of photosynthesis is indicated.

Several structures appearing terrestrial in origin have been observed within this space, including, but not limited to, unidentified aircraft, unidentified oceangoing vessels, at least one unidentified battle tank, and numerous bones of various species, including an apparent whale skeleton. The means through which these objects came to their current location is unknown. Furthermore, several structures corresponding to no known human civilization have also been observed.

All organisms observed within the anomaly are invertebrates with hydrostatic skeletons, adapted to a low light environment, believed to navigate through use of chemoreception, and appear to be composed of a chocolate-like substance. The intelligence, if any, of these organisms has yet to be determined. Researchers project that approximately 90% of native species remain undocumented, due to the size of the anomaly. The observed organisms exhibited no hostility toward remote controlled drones, and a list detailing the entities encountered are listed in the following document.

The personnel maintaining the facility exhibit no anomalous properties. Their bodies display signs of ritualistic mutilation, along with tattoos of symbols depicting what appears to be a cacao tree, surrounded by three interconnected rings. The subjects were identified as missing civilians. Additionally, 12 children were recovered from the site, detained in cages outside the facility.

SCP-3409 came to the attention of the Foundation after investigating numerous reports of unexplained disappearances of civilians and police officers in adjacent towns. Undercover agents followed a family of infected civilians to the facility, and its anomalous properties were confirmed after subsequent investigations.

> **Interviewed:** POI-3409-21
> 
> **Interviewer:** Researcher ████
> 
> **Foreword:** The subject was identified as Lozano █████, a biochemical researcher formerly employed at █████ Industries. The subject had reportedly gone missing a month earlier.
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Researcher ████:** I have some questions for you regarding your work at the structure.
> 
> **POI-3409-21:** Fuck you. (spits) Blessed father Garrison warned us that you heretics would interfere, but we are prepared to die as martyrs.
> 
> **Researcher ████:** Explain the nature of your operations within the facility.
> 
> **POI-3409-21:** We are preparing for the second coming of the chocolate gods. They are angered by the delay of the glorious sacrifice, which you sinners are responsible for. What we have been doing is an effort to appease our overlords, who will strike you heretics down with righteous judgement when they reenter our world.
> 
> **Researcher ████:** Explain the nature of your 'overlords'. What is their nature?
> 
> **POI-3409-21:** You will refer to them as the chocolate gods.
> 
> **Researcher ████:** You mentioned these entities wish to enter our world?
> 
> **POI-3409-21:** Reenter; they were here before. They need us as much as we need their divine guidance. Their world is dying and they are weakened by the great conflict of the deities. They blessed us with the secret of chocolate, and ask for our devotion in return. They gave us the message, so we may open a gateway between our worlds. They wish for our festering species to transcend into the chocolate realm, so we may be reborn and made whole. It is our duty, as the spiritual children of the chocolate gods to restore them to their former glory. Life eternal will be ours. Repent, sinner. Change your ways and you too shall be rewarded.
> 
> **Researcher ████:** Explain what you were doing with the subjects within the facility.
> 
> **POI-3409-21:** You speak of the martyrs. Their essence appeases the chocolate gods, and their harbingers within the chocolate realm.
> 
> **Researcher ████:** What about the children discovered on-site? What were you planning to do with them?
> 
> **POI-3409-21:** They were young and would have never survived the process. It would have been a waste of life; an abomination. They would have been raised as one of us; trained to be devotees of the chocolate truth.
> 
> **Researcher ████:** What is the nature of the spatial anomaly located within the facility?
> 
> **POI-3409-21:** Proof of your impending judgment.
> 
> **Researcher ████:** Answer the question.
> 
> **POI-3409-21:** Or what? You'll shoot me? Go ahead. Unlike you, we do not fear death. But seeing as you will find out either way, I will humor you. What you found within the temple is an incomplete, false gateway to the chocolate realm. Home of the chocolate gods, our gracious overlords.
> 
> **Researcher ████:** How was the anomaly created?
> 
> **POI-3409-21:** The chocolate gods work in mysterious ways, but they have bestowed much of their secrets to our blessed father Garrison. It is through him that we are shown the nature of the chocolate realm.
> 
> **Researcher ████:** We will discuss your leader in a later interview. For now-
> 
> **POI-3409-21:** Our leader exists in many places, in many forms. Using the chocolate of transference, he has eyes and ears everywhere. Even before you, as we speak. He sees through us, and lives through us, just as we will live through the chocolate gods. You will fail to capture him.
> 
> **Researcher ████:** Explain the nature of your loyalty to this person.
> 
> **POI-3409-21:** The blessed father showed me the truth. He showed me that the genetic structure of the cacao tree, the giver of chocolate, cannot possibly have originated on this world. It was a gift from the chocolate deities, for which we must be eternally thankful for. I did not hesitate to eat his chocolate of salvation. If you were truly a man of science, you too would realize this truth.
> 
> **Researcher ████:** Alright, let's try something else. You were harvesting the substance produced by the subjects imprisoned within the facility. What, exactly, do you hope to achieve by distributing it to civilians?
> 
> **POI-3409-21:** You speak of the chocolate of repentance. The sacred blood of <UNKNOWN: "Shimbul'liera">, the giver of life, and blessed mother of <UNKNOWN: "Narzeil'larmarg">, the fallen, youngest of the chocolate gods, but in no way the least of them. The accursed false gods tried to destroy his body during the conflict of the deities, millennia ago, but failed to destroy him completely. Such is the magnificence of the chocolate gods. We shall use it to bring salvation to humanity and restore the fallen one.
> 
> **Researcher ████:** I don't understand what that means-
> 
> **POI-3409-21:** You will. If you wish to be saved, you would be wise to eat it, and feed it to the rest of the desecrators. Soon, chocolate will rain from the heavens, and the holy denizens of the chocolate realm will pour through, and claim what is rightfully theirs. Prepare, sinner, for his judgement is most severe.
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** POI-3409-21 refused to answer subsequent questions, even when subjected to enhanced interrogation.

> **Interviewed:** POI-3409-22
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. ██████
> 
> **Foreword:** One of the children recovered from the site of SCP-3409 was interviewed to determined the nature of their detainment. The subject was identified as ████ ██████, aged 10 years.
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** Good day, ████. How are you feeling?
> 
> **POI-3409-22:** Who are you? Where is this place?
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** I'm a doctor. This is a hospital. I'm here to help you, but you need to tell me what happened so I can understand how to help you.
> 
> **POI-3409-22:** Have you seen my parents? They were taken into the building by the people who caught me.
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** Yes, we have doctors treating them. Can you tell me what happened?
> 
> **POI-3409-22:** I don't know. My family started getting sick one day. I woke up in bed, and my whole body was sore, like I had the flu. The next thing I remembered was that I was at the building. There were other children. I- I thought I was dreaming, but I knew it was real. My hands looked all weird. There were these people talking. Then they took all the kids one by one, and fed them some chocolate. After I ate it, I started feeling better. But they put us in cages and wouldn't tell us anything, or let us see our parents. But they said that they were our new family, and I got really scared.
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** It's okay. you're safe now. Can you tell me what happened during the time?
> 
> **POI-3409-22:** They sometimes talked in a weird language so we couldn't understand them, and they just gave us nothing but chocolate to eat. They forced us to say, uh, prayers in their language, and told us we wouldn't get to eat if we refused. I saw them drag a police officer into the building once. He was, like, half asleep or something, and couldn't fight back. I don't know what happened to him. After two days the police came... and then- and then- there was shooting-
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** It's alright, ████. Take your time.
> 
> **POI-3409-22:** Then the police found us and took us here... I want to see my parents.
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** Thank you for your time, ████. I'll see what we can do.
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** Subsequent investigations of the subject's place of residence revealed unmarked candy wrappers. Analysis indicated traces of chocolate contaminated with SCP-3409-A.

**Addendum 3409-1:** The following document was discovered in the office of SCP-3409. Investigations indicated that the handwriting belonged to confectioner, █████ Garrison[[footnote]]The subject is listed as a person of interest regarding an additional anomaly, designated [[[SCP-3974|SCP-3974]]]. Personnel with the appropriate clearance level may consult documentation for the event, for more information.[[/footnote]]. All attempts to locate the subject has been met with failure. The document is listed as follows.

> No. Your "best" isn't good enough.
> 
> You will ask the chocolate gods for repentance for uttering such insolence to me, their blessed messenger. No more excuses; gather more sacrifices. They are growing impatient. Your faith is strong. I felt it the moment I chose you. As such, you must not fail me. We must complete this project as soon as possible, as time is precious. The chocolate gods are dying, because of our infidelity. Because of those accursed heretics. A future without the light of the chocolate gods is a dead future. They breathed their life into us with the gift of chocolate and our diseased species thanked them by spitting in their faces and shutting them out. Does that not sicken you? Don't you dare call yourself my acolyte, unless you are going to give your absolute best, to further our cause.
> 
> Find more martyrs by any means necessary. We need at least a hundred. Spare any children captured. Sacrificing them early would be a waste of potential; the adults would make better sacrifices. If need be, sacrifice some of the devotees under your command. Gain the trust of the children, and enlighten them with the chocolate truth. More followers will undoubtedly please the chocolate gods, and replace the ones that were martyred.
> 
> Stay strong, my children, and you will be rewarded with eternal life. We must find enough martyrs to awaken the blessed harbinger of the chocolate realm, the mighty Narzeil'larmarg, the incarnation of the living message. Once we retrieve what was ours, we shall pave the path for the rest of the chocolate gods. This world will soon be made clean once more.
> 
> Holy, holy, holy, are the denizens of the chocolate realm. Sing praise to the chocolate gods, feast upon the chocolate of salvation, and give offerings to Shimbul'liera, my children. The great reckoning is nigh.
> 
> █████ Garrison, messenger of the chocolate gods.
