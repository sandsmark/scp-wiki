@@                            @@Halloween night is one to remember,
@@                            @@there are sweets to be eaten and pumpkins to dismember.
@@                            @@The October month is mightier than September
@@                            @@and stands on the shoulders of November.
@@                            @@The one told here is certainly to be remembered…

@@                            @@The jack-o-lantern moon danced among the stars.
@@                            @@Below, children are dressed as monsters from Mars.
@@                            @@A cry of ‘Trick or Treat!’
@@                            @@and they have chocolate, so sweet!

@@                            @@There is a group who see behind the façade,
@@                            @@to them all the dark cards are laid,
@@                            @@they secure and contain
@@                            @@they are a Foundation, said plain.
@@                            @@They watch the houses because they might chew and bite;
@@                            @@they know the world isn’t right.

@@                            @@The horrors of the dead.
@@                            @@We try to silence them, we put them below
@@                            @@and think they’re put to bed.
@@                            @@We burn them to dust, so,
@@                            @@they’re gone, like a mirror
@@                            @@once we break them.

@@                            @@Still alive, they whisper:
@@                            @@‘No.’ They hit their graves.
@@                            @@Still alive, they shout:
@@                            @@‘No!’ They worm through cemetery caves.
@@                            @@‘NO!’

@@                            @@The dead men and women smell the living world.
@@                            @@Sugar.
@@                            @@Chocolate.
@@                            @@Apples.
@@                            @@//Meat//.

@@                            @@The eyes of the ones who know,
@@                            @@see the dead and act low.
@@                            @@The unearthed souls try to run,
@@                            @@try to peel away from the world once more,
@@                            @@they are contained in the grip of the unseen giant,
@@                            @@the Foundation.

@@                            @@All, but one.

@@                            @@The dead child hides in the dank expanse of a sewer,
@@                            @@his bones softened by moisture.
@@                            @@He trudges out caked in mud,
@@                            @@looks to the All Saints’ Day sun for blood.
@@                            @@New, old or dead.
