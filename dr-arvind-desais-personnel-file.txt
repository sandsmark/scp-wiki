**[[[SCP-2060]]] - We Burn Every Day**
//"When the head of an instance is ignited and the feet placed in the mouth, the user will experience the effects and taste of smoking a cigarette, up to and including nicotine addiction. Instances of SCP-2060 will continue to burn up to the lower torso, down to the bone until scorched; they do not burn past the waist. SCP-2060 instances appear to feel pain, reacting in a manner similar to normal humans if ignited or masticated, but continue to utter phrases spoken by their counterparts."//

**[[[SCP-2143]]] - Singin' in the Rain**
//" Although the symptoms of the disease are that of septicemic plague (diarrhea, fever, low blood pressure, gangrene, shock, etc.), the disease is untreatable by antibiotics. The disease's vector is unknown. If SCP-2143 is allowed to sing, any afflicted persons will quickly recover, and the area of effect will dissipate."//

**[[[SCP-2210]]] - The Bureaucracy**
//"High-speed camera surveillance shows unknown individuals entering the residence, leaving the appeal form, and carrying off objects and possession that equal the value of the late fee. If the policyholder runs out of possessions and money, they will be accosted by an unknown individual in a business suit and mask, who will proceed to abduct them and carry them through the nearest doorway, whereupon the two will disappear."//

**[[[SCP-2350]]] - A Romance in Higher Dimensions**
//"Every 256 hours, a purple oblong portal (approximately 16 meters tall) appears somewhere within one of the parks. The portal emits what is theorized to be Hawking radiation, and causes severe burns to all unshielded organisms within a 2.67 meter-radius of the portal. Based on observation of the entities that exit it, it appears to be a gateway into a universe with at least four spatial dimensions."//

**[[[SCP-2490]]] - Chaos Insurgency Special Operative Alpha-19**
//"Targets uniformly report SCP-2490 either moving towards them without moving its legs (with its arms outstretched) or scuttling in a matter akin to a crab. SCP-2490 appears to have a type of short-range teleportation (although another hypothesis is that there are multiple instances of SCP-2490). In one instance, SCP-2490's target locked it in a closet, then turned around to see SCP-2490 emerging from a nearby bathroom."//

//"In particular, any music featuring the voice of musician Kanye West has a strongly negative effect on SCP-2570. West's voice also halts the corrosion, causing an inverse process where the corrosive liquid is recompiled into its original substance and/or retreats back into the rift. Instances of SCP-2570-3 are neutralized and reverted to their original selves. However, complete closing of the rift has been unsuccessful."//

Instances of SCP-2650-1 are various preadolescent children, between the ages of 5 and 9, with their own instances of SCP-2650-A. They share the same neurological abnormality as SCP-2650-B, but their behavior is markedly different."//

//"For example, human lungs are composed of actual humans that inhale and exhale, while plant leaves are composed of smaller, wilted plants arranged and folded in such a way that only their leaves are exposed to sunlight. Microscopic examination reveals that these cellular-sized composites are themselves composed of exponentially smaller composites carrying out their bodily functions, which in turn are composed of smaller copies, and so on."//

[[tab Commentary (SCPs)]]
[[[SCP-2060]]] is loosely based on a talk I had with my father about... six months, I think, before I posted it. We were out on a walk and he was in the middle of a diatribe about how Bush Jr. was Cheney and Bush Sr.'s puppet, as well as how Cheney was the real mastermind behind the Middle East invasions in order to steal their oil... and then he mentioned cigarettes for some reason, and for some other reason the words Cheney and cigar resonated with me. Originally I wrote about Dick Cheney alone being turned into a cigarette, and then I wondered what if all kinds of celebrities were turned into cigarettes? Thus, SCP-2060 was born. It's the first article I wrote that features the "Curios of the Worlds", a shoppe that apparently sells objects from all over the worlds...
-----
[[[SCP-2143]]] will be familiar to anyone who's read the Asterix comics. Specifically, he's based off of Cacofonix the bard, whose singing is so bad that it causes rain both indoors and outdoors- at one point, he, Asterix, and Obelix travel to India to relieve a drought with his song. I was struck by how much Cacofonix resembled an SCP: he had a strange ability, was under containment (by Fulliautomatix the blacksmith, who smacked him in the face if he tried to sing) and was actively sought out by certain Groups of Interest like the Indians and Romans. So I turned him into an SCP. I couldn't write Cacofonix the SCP, since he lived in the year 50 BC (and it would be plagiarism). So instead, I drew upon another song-related figure: the god Apollo. Greek gods are supremely petty and vengeful bastards, so a conflict with his godly father Zeus provided some emotional backstory and also a reason for his affliction.
-----
[[[SCP-2210]]] was written up for a Bright Challenge, specifically a prompt posted by [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-1014402#post-2115705 |InsipidParoxysm]]]. He postulated an anomalous insurance company, so I ran with the idea. I started by thinking that a lot of parties in the Foundationverse would want insurance and/or special materials they couldn't get anywhere else given the nature of their work, hence the use of multiple Groups of Interest. But it wasn't enough to have an otherwise-regular insurance company -the company itself needed to be anomalous. It's easy enough to get into a contract with SCP-2210, but impossible to get out. The geography of SCP-2210 itself is based around unnecessary complexity and obfuscation; the strange currency types and the consequences of failure to pay are just weird; while the insurance policies provided add fridge horror (such as North Korea being the result of an anartist's vision). At the core, SCP-2210 is an eldritch horror pretending to be GEICO. I'm actually kind of surprised it's so popular - it seemed quite divisive when I first posted it.
-----
[[[SCP-2350]]] was a pretty simple self-imposed challenge. I wanted to see if I could tell a story - a full blown television serial plot - without actually telling a story. I also wanted to write a Keter-class object and Neutralized object. Thus, SCP-2350. I had several character stereotypes laid out: the jock, the chick, the twins, and the outcast. The plot is fairly simple: the outcast is in love with the chick, while the chick is in a relationship with the jock. The twins simply add background material to distract from the love triangle. The outcast does his best to win the heart of the chick, but it isn't enough, and he goes mad with grief. He kidnaps her and is then shot to death. The twist is that this soap opera actually is a soap opera - they're all actors in an extra-dimensional serial shot on Planet Earth. I consider this my weakest effort since I didn't have any real plans beyond the soap story.
-----
[[[SCP-2490]]] was another self-imposed challenge of mine: to write something that made the reader paranoid. The spark came from a random thought whereupon I imagined a mannequin watching me in my house in the middle of the night. I used that thought and expanded upon it: a mannequin watching its target, picking up on their mannerisms and habits, before literally picking up those memories, mannerisms, and habits to steal an SCP. The interview log expands on that horror, drawing the reader in and trying to force them to imagine the same thing. The final hook comes from the implications that there are multiple instances of SCP-2490.
-----
[[[SCP-2570]]] is my personal favorite and I wish more people read it. //This is a story about Nathaniel Hornblöwer, not Kanye West!// The Beastie Boys are by far my favorite rappers, and I wanted to write a tribute to MCA. Thus came a story of other fans of the Beastie Boys, who try to reunite the band but fail due to a minor mistake - with major consequences. The use of Pali as a language is a direct reference to MCA's Buddhist faith, while Kanye West simply adds more flavor to the article. It's a simple tribute, but I like to think it's a good one.
-----
[[[SCP-2650]]] is the first truly successful SCP I wrote, so it holds a special place in my heart. This one is inspired by Slappy the Living Dummy. I still don't like ventriloquist dummies, so I wrote an article to express that fear. I also wrote about children and their imaginary friends, because when I was a child I had far more imaginary friends and stuffed doll friends than real ones. There are some underlying themes of child predation, but I want to make it clear that pedophilia has //absolutely nothing// to do with the article other than the fear of a stranger being alone with one's children.
-----
[[[SCP-2790]]] was //supposed// to be my entry into the Short Story contest, but is now my most popular article. The core concept, of people going apeshit over an otherwise boring-ass squid, was actually the second of three ideas for the contest, mainly because I had wanted to use that picture of the glass squid for a while. However, it was set aside because the first draft was actually seen as too disturbing - not in a good way, but in a raping-a-squid kind of way. Half of the responses were to delete the article and erase it from everything. I still liked the concept of a squid that was totally, utterly, freakishly adorbs, (and also wanted to stick it to the naysayers) so I pretended to get rid of it but simply hid it away in a sandbox. After the Short Story Contest ended, I wrote up a bunch of half-drafts that needed lots of work but I didn't feel like polishing, so I ended up returning to this one because I really liked it. I scrubbed the sexual aspects of the piece and focused more on an obsession with the squid and an obsession to be like the squid. I also jumped at the chance to establish more SCPs from "Curios of the Worlds". It's a fairly short article, but establishes and builds on a mood quickly, but then cuts short before the mood becomes cloying. This has the added effect of convincing the reader to imagine what's happening inside SCP-2790, and the reader's ideas are more exciting than mine...
-----
[[[SCP-2810]]] was my //actual// entry into the Short Story Contest. This piece was the last of three ideas I had for the contest, and is the only one that actually made it through the wringer in time. It is very, very body-horror focused, probably as an homage to David Cronenberg. I wanted to write SCPs about fractals and communism, so I suppose this was the result of that. I also suffer very heavily from dermatophagia and dermatillomania to the point of sometimes peeling and eating skin off my foot, and I badly wanted an outlet to express that. When I first wrote the preliminary draft up, I wanted to tie it into GRU-Division "P" as an attempt to create a "communist virus". I couldn't fit all of that into the article, so I cut out the bioweapon background and simply laid it on as a mysterious plague. My favorite piece of fridge horror comes from the dermatophagia. It's literally autocannibalism in action - human sufferers are biting and chewing pieces of human flesh made of humans, forcing tiny humans to bite, chew, vomit and defecate pieces of human flesh made of other, even tinier humans.

[[tab Commentary (Tales)]]

[[[Avatara]]] is the first tale I wrote for the 2016 MTF Contest. While writing the story, I had three key objectives in mind: establish Mobile Task Force Tau-5 "Samsara", create a setup for the sequel, and //nullify any comparisons to Jack Bright//. To that end, I chose the complete opposite route as far as characterization is concerned: while Bright is a human transforming into a sociopath, Tau-5 is composed of a bunch of psychopaths who want to be human. 
The nature of Tau-5 also allowed me to focus on their utter inability to be human by subjecting them to a variety of bodily torments, which I had a ton of fun writing about. Unfortunately, their nature as emotionless, recyclable, meaningless clones also impeded the dialogue and their personalities - both of which are singled out as the key issues in the tale. I hope to rectify those issues in the sequel.

----

[[[Domo Arigato]]] was originally written for the 2015 Reimagining Contest. I had wanted to create a clever, funny, Adams-esque light space opera, and saw the chance to rewrite [[[SCP-354]]] as the perfect opportunity. The version that entered the contest was much, much longer and much less funny. It was also a musical. Probably not unrelatedly, it bombed, so I set about completely revamping it and separating it into three parts, of which //Domo Arigato// is the first. This first part establishes the main characters - and possibly the only protagonists onsite that are actual space aliens - and pretty quickly shows its //Hitchhiker's// influence on its sleeve.

----

[[[Strung Out in Heavens High]]] trumpets its Adams-esque heritage whereas //Domo Arigato// was somewhat subtle about it. The characters immediately become nutty and the events that unfold nuttier still. //Strung Out// introduces us to the Terminal, the true main setting of the story and an excuse to travel to alternate realities and write about them. Nonetheless, I had a lot of fun rewriting the second part of Gregory's adventure, especially the sequence where Happy and Gregory travel through the boom tube. 

----

[[[Nonpareil]]] is the odd duck of my tales. It's not a story at all - it's a poem that was conceived, written, and edited in less than a week. And it was based on an oddly erotic dream I had involving a spouse that was a dragonfly. Nonetheless, I consider //Nonpareil// as one of the best tales I've written. It's unashamedly purple, but also evokes a dreamlike atmosphere that really lends itself to the Rat's Nest.

----

[[[I Thought You Died Alone]]] was two things: my effort to contribute to the bloomingly controversial Resurrection canon, and also establish my author avatar into the Foundationverse. It was also one of my stylistic projects: telling a story through epistolary format. This tale accomplishes two key plot threads: it establishes that yes, there is actual internal resistance to the revival of the infamous SCP task force, and actually establishes a mole in the Foundation. But it's also my magnum opus of characterization, probably because Arvind Desai is also the only character that I've based off of my own life experiences. //I Thought You Died Alone// is my attempt at a tragedy told through emails.

----

[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/reboot-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-apocal |Reboot: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Apocalypses]]] arose from one of my self-imposed challenges: tell a story purely through dialogue. It is heavily influenced by the short story //They're Made out of Meat//, both stylistically and structurally. //Reboot// also came about from my desire to get in on the whole "resetting the world" gig; this time by exploring the process from the perspective of the people doing so. It's a fun, cyclical tale that implies some pretty horrifying stuff about the nature of the universe...

----

[[[The Ballad of Santa Troy]]] is a quick little ditty I whipped up in about a day or so as a gift to the ever-underappreciated staff of the wiki. There isn't much else to say about it aside from that it goes quite well with the classic holiday tune [[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOb8P7iJQiQ |Snoop Dogg's Twas the Night before Christmas]]].

----

[[[Hands]]] was my attempt to write a scary story - in this case, a quasi-psychological thriller. Using [[[SCP-513]]], I tried to create tension and fear from placing the monster right into the house. Sure, it never actually attacks the main character, but that doesn't matter. There's something in your home. You aren't safe. It's gotten right into your house. And right. Behind. You.

----

[[[Industrial Espionage]]] was one of the two tales I wrote for the 2014 GOI Contest. I personally feel that what elevates it over other tales is the diary format. He's talking into an audio recorder the whole time, so there's ambient noise, his personality changes when he's high, he doesn't always speak properly. At the same time, the extremely limited first-person perspective makes the reader claustrophobic, making them wonder what's going on inside Sub-City Twelve.

----

[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/nothing-remotely-human |Nothing Human]]] is a huge shift from every other tale I wrote - it's probably the spiritual predecessor to //Nonpareil// in that regard. There's no Foundation, no SCPs, not even Earth. //Nothing Human// is my attempt at a Heinleinian science fiction story. I call it a chocolate science fiction tale: a thin hard shell with soft innards. //Nothing Human// also cranks up the perspective a great deal - everything is perceived the way 735 perceives his reality and leaves the reader with lots of questions. Who is the human? Where did he come from? What did he say? Why did he capture them? Admittedly it's not exactly a great format for a resolved story, but it's still a pretty good science fiction story.

----

[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/enansi-si-gnihtyreve |Enasni Si Gnihtyreve]]] was my entry for the 2014 Dystopia Contest, and is also my least well-received tale (not without reason). It's told in a very stream-of-consciousness format and is intended to make the reader uncomfortable. What's happening? [[[SCP-610]]] took over the Earth. Is there a conflict? Yes - mundane conflicts that take on a very sinister tone. It's confusing, disorienting, and flat-out weird. It's controversial. People hate the fucking paragraph breaks. And I wouldn't have it any other way.
