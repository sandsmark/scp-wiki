**Item #:** SCP-5000

**Object Class:** PENDING

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5000 is considered currently uncontained and its location is unknown. Containment is a priority following the completed investigation into the murder of Mr Jake Brown in collaboration with the Global Occult Coalition.

**Description:** SCP-5000 is an unidentified entity responsible for the murder of Mr. Jake Brown[[footnote]]To be referred to as Jake Brown in respect to his status as a victim of  murder according to GOC guidelines until investigation is complete.[[/footnote]]. Jake Brown was an ontokinetic anomaly whose presence required the rewriting of hume measurement procedures 13.A to 72.A-P. The following is a collection of related documentation in lieu of a description pending the discovery of SCP-5000.

||||||~ Subject|| Regarding Incident 5000||

The following events took place on February 19, 2008, 0530 EDT.

Approximately three pieces of measurement technology, the furthest approximately 165km from the epicenter, notified surveying parties to EVE energy readings far beyond normal; I believe the conservative estimate was five standard deviations beyond baseline. I was deployed first in order to investigate. There were no reports among mundane communication channels(ie. calls to emergency services). My time to arrival was approximately two minutes, one of which was putting on my equipment.

Since I was told I have to tell you almost everything, I'll be upfront. We knew about Jake Brown long before you did. We projected that the chances someone of his magnitude would appear in the general population at approximately one in five trillion. We put a target on his back since his abilities began to manifest back on his fourteenth birthday.

Obviously he caused no trouble until now and we knew immediately that he must've been the source of the sudden EVE spike.

When I got to his place, my measurement equipment couldn't find traces of thaumaturgic energy laying around anymore. You know as well as I do that energy that big doesn't vanish like that unintentionally. I unlocked the door and walked in with a weapon drawn. The lights were on. 

I saw him laying on the carpet in the living area of the apartment. There looked be a large wound in his abdominal area. I couldn't be sure; chunks of him spilled up towards the ceiling as if that was the direction of gravity. I spotted a firearm[[footnote]]origins of the firearm are currently unidentified[[/footnote]] floating between himself and the ceiling, with a bullet frozen in the process of being fired. Jake Brown has no history of owning firearms. The whole place smelled like one spot in my childhood; a family trip to a 'breathing cave'. Each gust of air out of the cave smelled like this place- a mix of moisture and mold like an exhale from the earth.

I spent the next two minutes surveying the rest of the space, then the entrails of Jake Brown remembered where gravity was supposed to go and fell back onto his body. Imagine a particularly heavy bout of rainfall.

Your organization showed up after, so you know the rest of the story.

Also, regarding your request into equipment descriptions and schematics, you have to file a 4455EM-88-S. I attached an empty one and you can send it back to me.

[[tab Brown-001]]
**Date:** February 19, 2008
**Interviewer:** Christopher Malone, Jr. (Under alias Jacob Kinsey)
**Interviewee:** Lauren Brown
**Foreword:** Christopher Malone, Jr. is an agent of the Global Occult Coalition and is under the alias Jacob Kinsey. He presents as a law enforcement officer.

**[BEGIN LOG]**

//Brown has been crying for the past twenty minutes previous to the beginning of the log.//

**Malone:** Afternoon, Mrs. Brown. I'm Jacob Kinsey, and I'm here to help find who did this. I know this is a lot to take in, so please take all the time you need.

//Brown is unable to respond for the next three minutes. Malone replaces a near-empty box of tissues beside her. He places a cup of water in front of her. Brown drinks twice before speaking.//

**Brown:** Okay. Okay. I'm. Oh god. Yes, okay. Call me Lauren. Just- what do you want?

**Malone:** Could you tell us what you know about Jake? Was he in any trouble shortly before today?

**Brown:** He- he just lost his job a while ago. Couldn't find another. With some tax firm, he, he was caught penciling in some extra hours. But he needed the money. They wouldn't kill him over a few hundred fucking dollars! 

**Malone:** Thank you. Please take a few breaths. We can go as slow as you need, Lauren. I'm here for you.

**Brown:** He. He's a good man, Jacob. He doesn't have money- never even graduated- god. God. He never accomplished a thing but he was trying. He never stopped trying to get it together. He never should've done that stupid fucking thing. Never. 

**Malone:** Could you tell me more about the last few days leading up to today?

**Brown:** Jake and I were, were having troubles. He was... He was really down. But I was telling him we were gonna make it work. We were gonna. He kept saying- he kept saying that— he didn't get it. Why it was so hard for him.

**Malone:** Where were you last night, Lauren?

**Brown:** Oh god, you don't-- you don't suspect-- fuck. I have a fucking alibi. I'm a waitress. I work evenings when my sons are with their dad. From another marriage.

//Malone nods and waits for Brown to continue.//

**Brown:** Okay, I'm more like a bartender. At //Mulligan's//. Wait— Wait there was one thing. He left me this weird voicemail last night. 3 AM. Couldn't answer 'cause I was working.

//Brown pulls out her phone and begins to play the voicemail.//

[[div style="display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px"]]
Jake Brown can be heard breathing heavily into the receiver for approximately twenty seconds.

//**Jake Brown:** Lauren. Lauren, I love you. But I can't do it anymore. I can't... be like everyone else. The way everyone else does it. Just going through their lives... going through, like sheep, like they don't got no control. And they don't. None of them really got it, Lauren. None of 'em but me.//

Jake Brown blows his nose. It's clear that he has been crying for some time. His voice pauses as he sobs involuntarily between words.

//**Jake Brown:** But I'm giving up, Lauren. It's just too hard for me to live the way the rest of you do. Maybe it's 'cause of what I got. I knew it since I was a boy but I thought I didn't need it. It was weak. But maybe that's what I am, Lauren. Maybe I'm too weak. Took me forty fucking years for me to get it through my thick goddamn skull.//

//**Jake Brown:** Maybe that's why I got it. 'Cause I'm too weak otherwise. I'll explain when you're home, Lauren. If I can. If I'm on your side of everything's everything, after I open my eyes for the first time.//

Jake Brown can be heard blowing several kisses before he hangs up.

**Interviewer:** Christopher Malone, Jr. (Under alias Jacob Kinsey)
**Interviewee:** Vincent Matthew
**Foreword:** Christopher Malone, Jr. is an agent of the Global Occult Coalition and is under the alias Jacob Kinsey. He presents as a law enforcement officer.

**[BEGIN LOG]**

**Malone:** I'd like to thank you for coming in today. 

**Matthew:** It's really true, huh. He really kicked it. Damn.

**Malone:** Would you mind telling me where you were past two nights?

**Matthew:** Well, I usually go to the gym around seven. Then I head home around eight, maybe eight thirty. After that I watch TV with my wife until bedtime. Around ten.

**Malone:** Could you describe Jake Brown's employment at Symmetry Accounting and Tax Services?

**Matthew:** Honestly, I shouldn't have hired the guy. Who applies to be a paper pusher at like, must've been at least thirty, maybe thirty-five? Either way. He just had such an earnestness about him, and I figured he couldn't be too much trouble. He was alright. No complaints. Until he started stealing money. //[Laughs.]//

**Malone:** Could you talk more about that?

**Matthew:** About the hiring or the stealing? I mean. His resume wasn't great. He doesn't even have an Associate's. He worked in construction, but his back blew out from an old sports injury. His references were decent. He worked well enough for a deadbeat, then he started adding hours he didn't work. Just a little each paycheck.

**Malone:** So he was terminated.

**Matthew:** And it was such a scandal he put me out of work while auditing counted everything there was the count. Huge pain for everyone. He sure got his karma, I say.

**Malone:** Do you recall anything unusual happening in the days leading up to the murder?

**Matthew:** Nope! So the rumor mill's saying that men in spacesuits were coming in and out of that apartment all day. I'd love to see //that// autopsy report!

**Malone:** //[Pause.]// We'll see what we can do. Thank you, Mr. Matthew.

[[tab Strauss-002]]
**Date:** February 20, 2008
**Interviewer:** Agent Kevin McHannon (under alias Keith McKinsey)
**Interviewee:** Jaquelynne Strauss
**Foreword:** Agent Kevin McHannon presents as a law enforcement officer.

**[BEGIN LOG]**

**McHannon:** Hello, Mrs. Strauss. Do you know why you are here today?

**Strauss:** No.

**McHannon:** I'm here to ask about this man. Do you recognize him?

//McHannon slides a photograph of Jake Brown to Strauss.//

**Strauss:** He's my ex-husband, Jake Brown.

**McHannon:** Could you tell me what you know of him?

**Strauss:** I should've never married him. He couldn't hold a job. Couldn't even do community college. Look, Jake, is he in some sort of trouble?

**McHannon:** We can talk about that later. Could you tell me more about what you know?

//Strauss narrows her eyes and looks at McHannon for the next five seconds.//

**Strauss:** He grew up an only child. I knew him since highschool. He was charming, handsome, but a little spaced out. Seemed always sort of... uncomfortable, though. Like he was sitting on the world's biggest secret and was terrible at hiding it.

**McHannon:** //[Nodding.]// How did you and he interact in college?

**Strauss:** I guess... I thought I could cure him? Of his discomfort? But I never could get through to him. I guess he needed a therapist, not a wife. At first I thought he was just on drugs or something. Always had that sort of really, deeply distressed look about him. Saw it in my brother sometimes, before the family found his drinking habit.

**Strauss:** Warden, my son, sometimes looks like that, by the way. I tested him up and down and couldn't find a thing wrong about him. He tells me that there's strings in spaces no one else seems to know anything about. Except his arms are too short to reach them.

**McHannon:** That must be really kind of you, to see a haunted soul and to try and help them.

**Strauss:** I wouldn't use the word //haunted//. Just... tense. All over. Like he's holding a fist too long. Anyhow, what's this about, officer? I need to go pick up Warden.

**McHannon:** Would you mind if we met with Warden?

**Strauss:** //[Agitated.]// What's this about, officer.

//McHannon takes off his hat.//

**McHannon:** Well, ma’am. We have reason to believe your ex-husband has been murdered.

//Strauss does not speak for the next fifteen seconds. Her gaze travels from the photo to her hands, her purse, and finally McHannon.//

**Strauss:** I'd like to continue this conversation with my lawyer present.

**[END LOG]**

**Notes:** Warden Strauss was tested to have a higher than normal level of thaumaturgic potential according to Global Occult Coalition measurement reports. However, the reports speculated that Warden Strauss's potential to achieve any anomalous effect is similar to that of a baseline human and is therefore not a concern. He has since been assigned annual testing.

**Interviewee:** Lauren Brown
**Foreword:** Agent Kevin McHannon presents as a law enforcement officer.

**[BEGIN LOG]**

**McHannon:** Welcome. I'm Keith McKinsey. Jacob can't attend on such short notice but rest assured I'm up to date on the case. What can we do for you today?

**Brown:** It's been five years.

**McHannon:** Yes.

**Brown:** I want an update.

**McHannon:** We've told you all we can.

**Brown:** No you haven't. You didn't open a tip line. You didn't take interviews with reporters. Didn't ask state police for help. You haven't told me anything. Told anyone, anything. 

**McHannon:** What would you like to know?

**Brown:** The gun- what model was it? Was it the murder weapon? Was it Matthew? I told you he collected guns. And his body. Jake. Where did you put him? Why can't we have him back? 

**McHannon:** We don't-- we are still running some tests. The coroner-

**Brown:** //[Interrupting, yelling.]// The coroner hasn't even issued an autopsy report! After five fucking years! What else do you need?!

**McHannon:** There's some technology being worked on that we think will blow the case wide open. But it takes time before it's ready.

**Brown:** How much longer do I need to wait before I can //bury my fucking husband//?!

//McHannon pauses for ten seconds as he chews the inside of his cheek. His gaze drifts past her, to the door. He speaks but does not look at her.//

**McHannon:** Soon. Within the next few years, surely. Less than five.

**Brown:** Years? You want me to wait for //years//?!

**McHannon:** I can. I can ask. //[Pause. Several deep breaths.]// I can ask to release to you details of the weapon. I'm sorry, Lauren. It's the best I can do right now.

**Brown:** //[Crying.]// That's not enough, Keith. That's not enough.

**McHannon:** It's all I have.

//McHannon offers Brown a box of tissues. Brown exits the room instead.//

**[END LOG]**

**Note:** //No. Absolutely not. We can't afford any information on a clearly thaumaturgic device to be released to the baseline world. She'll just have to wait until we can identify the related EVE readings attached to it.// - Christopher Malone, Jr.

**Interviewee:** Lauren Brown
**Foreword:** Christopher Malone, Jr. is an agent of the Global Occult Coalition and is under the alias Jacob Kinsey. He presents as a law enforcement officer.

**[BEGIN LOG]**

**Malone:** Thank you for coming in today, Lauren. I wanted to ask if there was any further information you may recall from the first time-

**Brown:** //[Interrupting.]// I'm only coming in to let you know it's the last time I'm doing this shit with you.

**Malone:** Of course, I understand. This must still be quite hard for you.

**Brown:** I want to know who you people are. And what did Jake ever do to you.

**Malone:** //[Hesitantly.]// What do you mean?

**Brown:** It's been almost eight years. You keep saying the case is open. You don't tell the media anything. You don't tell me anything. I did some digging.

**Malone:** Of course, that's understandable.

**Brown:** You know what I found out? There wasn't a budget for another cop the year you joined. I'm sure of it. Chief Richards was talking about it during a town hall that summer. And you know how I confirmed it?

**Malone:** I understand this seems a little suspect, but unfortunately-

**Brown:** No, there ain't no way all the memos were lost that year. That's a bullshit excuse.

**Malone:** I'm sorry.

**Brown:** Tell me who you people are. Jake was not a bad man. He didn't have anything to do with anybody.

**Malone:** I'm sorry. I'm who I've always been. I've never been anyone else.

**Brown:** You haven't said a single honest fucking thing since you met me.

**Malone:** That's-

**Brown:** Don't deny it. Say one. Fucking. Thing. That was true.

//Malone pauses for ten seconds. He moves his chair forward and leans towards Brown, who does not move. He meets eyes with her for another five seconds.//

**Malone:** I told you my job is to find the monster that did this to Jake, and bring them to justice.

//Brown moves to stand. She begins to exit the room. Halfway to the door, she turns to spit on the floor between herself and Malone.//

**Note:** Lauren Brown has since refused all interview requests.

++++ **Abstract**

There has been much speculation as to the accurate measurement of the hume^^1^^ which includes the measurements of the hume directly^^2,5^^ and also the description of the hume's effects in proportion to its measurement^^10-15^^ but there has not been much evaluation as to the provenance of hume fluctuations. Utilizing new theoretical modeling of hume provenance analysis^^3^^ and building upon the machinery of the MIASMA protocol^^3^^ we examine an existing theoretical entity Jake Brown of SCP-5000^^8^^. [[span style="color:#000; background-color: #FFFF00;"]]We are able to conclusively determine that the hume spike detected in the vicinity of Jake Brown was not sourced by Jake Brown itself. [[/span]] We theorize several possible models of Jake Brown's interaction with the noted and measured spike of hume and [[span style="color:#000; background-color: #FFFF00;"]] rule out the possibility of spontaneity[[/span]], with the probabilities of each possible model as according to stochastic equality in parallel of regressive chirp gravity^^11^^ describing hume interactivity from separate sources. We are able to utilize new methods of MIASMA protocol engineering and an innovative chirp gravity model of hume interactivity to determine [[span style="color:#000; background-color: #FFFF00;"]]only one possible conclusion: Jake Brown suffered physical trauma from a rapid destabilization of reality centered on his person. This caused a perforation of his hernial sac, resulting in a partial evisceration of his abdominal cavity, and a complete severance of his spine.[[/span]]

In our conclusion we will describe next steps as to identify the[[span style="color:#000; background-color: #FFFF00;"]] possibility of weaponized reality[[/span]] and its applications to previously ignored theories and its applications into [[span style="color:#000; background-color: #FFFF00;"]] exploration into entity identification by hume signature[[/span]] in continued case study of SCP-5000.
