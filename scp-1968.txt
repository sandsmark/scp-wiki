**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1968 is to be secured in a bunker 300m underground accessible only by elevator requiring active measures at both the top and bottom of the shaft to operate. Armed guards are to be present at both ends. In case of incursion from within or without, the elevator shaft is to have an explosive self-destruct activated rendering it impassable. In the event of an incursion, guards must be considered expendable. 

//**Note:** Detonation is also at the discretion of O5 level administrators.//

**Description:** SCP-1968  appears in its inactive state to be a bronze torus of unknown manufacture. It has a major diameter of 900cm and a minor diameter of 280cm.  It is marked with grey, raised features or glyphs, the presumption being that they act as control surfaces.  It is difficult to photograph or visually inspect the artifact as it appears to bend light slightly. Mild, fluctuating gravitational effects have also been observed.

It has proven impossible to take a sample of the artifact. Spectrographic attempts have proven inconclusive. Although not particularly heavy (weighing ~14Kg), inertial and angular momentum studies suggest that //neutronium// [[footnote]] Neutronium is a proposed name for a substance composed purely of neutrons. It has been used to refer to extremely dense phases of matter resembling the neutron-degenerate matter theorized to exist in the cores of neutron stars. _ [[/footnote]] (in admittedly small quantities) may be present in the core of the mechanism. 

SCP-1968 demonstrates its anomalous properties when it is handled by a human being. When moderate force is applied to it, it will being to deform in unpredictable ways, its material composition will appear to change, and it will become animated, surrounding the subject in convolutions and undulating at a high rate of speed.  Its primary effect will manifest itself when an unpredictable threshold is met, after which the artifact will return to its original state.

At this point, the subject will have had their memories altered. They will no longer agree with the historical record, often substantially. Their self-reported personal history will be at odds with Foundation personnel records. As a consequence, they will often assume a posture of agitation and paranoia. The more pronounced the deformation of the artifact, the more divergent their memories will be. It is theorized that the glyphs, via means as of yet unknown, control the degree of deformation and its resultant effects.

**Recovery Log:** SCP-1968 was recovered in late 2001 from a core-sample extracted ██ Km deep during a petrochemical survey near Zackenburg, Greenland. Based on the depth from which it was recovered along with corroborating paleoatmospheric readings, the artifact is estimated to be [[$ 42.1 \pm 2.3 $]]  million years old.

Foundation personnel intercepted the radio transmission of its discovery and, owing to its unusual nature and age, moved to  secure the artifact. Class B amnesics were administered to the personnel in Greenland, along with those individuals at the governing authority in Denmark who had been made aware of the artifacts discovery. Note: once on site, it was discovered that one of the geological engineers had been placed under a 72 hour psychiatric hold after violently assaulting a colleague and behaving in a manner consistent with the Foundation test subject. It is presumed that they had handled the artifact.

//**Note:** The previous description is a __cover story__ and is based on our initial assumptions. The artifact's effects have proven to be of a very different nature. It is likely that SCP-1968 is affecting the past.//

**Initial Experiments**

The first experiment with the subject proved uneventful, routine medical examinations revealing no untoward effects. When the subject returned to their quarters after debriefing, however, they claimed that their furniture had been altered which they reported as part of standard procedure.  No evidence could be found to support their claim. Subsequently, the subject seemed confused about their shifts of duty, when they were scheduled, and to whom they were to report. 

After the second experiment, the subject appeared alarmed and confused. The laboratory where testing had taken place seemed changed  to them. The subject also professed that some personnel appeared to be missing while other were wholly unfamiliar. Interrogation of the subject showed that they were in possession of drastically different memories, encompassing such areas as diverse as their personal history, the nature of Foundation assets, and the historical record. [[[retrocausality-torus-interview-a | (see interview A)]]]

At first, it was assumed that the artifact had in some unknown way affected their mind. Interrogation of the subject, however, showed that their memories were extraordinarily detailed and self-consistent. Furthermore, the subject demonstrated knowledge of classified material to which they could not possibly have been exposed, including the existence of SCP-████ and SCP-████ that had, as of yet, not been identified, let alone secured. The operating assumption was that the Subject was either been compromised by forces unknown or was simply delusional.

At the conclusion of the third trial, the subject's account of previous experiments were in stark contradiction with the record. Among other things, they claimed that this had been the nineteenth such experiment. After a lengthy debriefing, the subject was able to furnish a kind of proof in the form of a testable experimental prediction. [[[retrocausality-torus-interview-b | (see interview B)]]]. It was discerned that what the subject was referring to was a measurable change in the strength of the Casimir force, [[footnote]] The Casimir effect can be expressed in terms of virtual particles interacting in the vacuum. It is best described and more easily calculated in terms of the zero-point energy of a quantized field in the intervening space between objects. This predicted force has been measured, and is a striking example of an effect purely due to second quantization. Essentially, particle-pairs coming in and out of existence too quickly to measure, //even in theory//, none the less give rise to measurable side effects. _ [[/footnote]] implicating a change in the rate of virtual particle-pair production in the vacuum.  [[footnote]] In physics, a virtual particle is a particle that comes into existence for a limited time and space and then just as quickly disappears. The energy and momentum of a virtual particle are uncertain according to the uncertainty principle. The degree of uncertainty of each is inversely proportional to time duration (for energy) or to position span (for momentum). _ [[/footnote]], even though   ostensibly nothing may even //theoretically// affect such rates.

**Unexpected Findings**

In an effort to corroborate their account, measurements were performed inside the artifact's sphere of influence. No such measurements were forthcoming. Efforts were suspended when, unexpectedly, back-channel reports surfaced of the discovery of just such phenomena at CERN  [[footnote]] //Centre Europeen de Recherche Nucleaire//, Geneva, Switzerland. _ [[/footnote]]  at the exact time the artifact had been in operation. Experiments were resumed away from the artifact's immediate vicinity, succeeding in detecting the effect. Further experiments were performed as distantly as Malaysia, South Africa and the Antarctic, reproducing the same findings. A probe in Jupiter space (that had been clandestinely re-tasked) concluded the same. The artifact's sphere of influence appeared to be much greater than initially suspected. The vicinity within the artifact's area of operation (and consequently the Subject) appeared insulated from the effect, perhaps by design.

**Conclusions**

Based on the chronology of these experiments, it seems that the effect propagates nearly instantaneously, at a rate comparable to the cosmological inflation  [[footnote]]  Cosmological inflation is the theorized extremely rapid exponential expansion of the early universe by a factor of at least [[$ 10^{78} $]]  in volume, driven by a negative-pressure vacuum energy density. The inflationary epoch comprises the first part of the electroweak epoch following the grand unification epoch, [[$ 10^{-36} $]] seconds post-singularity. Following the inflationary period, the universe continued to expand, but at a slower rate. _ [[/footnote]]  which occurred shortly after the Big Bang. Grand Unification theories predict that the combination of the anomalous virtual particle production along with the nearly instantaneous propagation could be the result of a global retrocausality event.

One explanation that has been put forth is that the entire Universe is being affected by the artifact.  It would be our and the universe's past which is being altered. The subject's memories would then be accurate, and would remain the only reliable record of the timeline before alteration. In light of this possibility, further testing has been suspended indefinitely. The unanimous consent of all O5 administers is required to perform further experiments. 

**Addendum**

The suggestion has been made that, in the event of an imminent XK-class world-ending scenario, the SCP could be used in a last ditch-effort to avert catastrophe, the cost of which would be the irrevocable and unpredictable altering of the past. Such a decision could obviously not be made lightly. To act in such a way would ensure that the world as we know would cease to exist. Yet at the same time, to do nothing might guarantee the same. Such a Metaphysical dilemma is, perhaps, beyond our ability to resolve.

**Recent Developments**

After testing was discontinued indefinitely, the subject was able to evade Foundation supervision briefly and committed suicide.

Two months later, the artifact engaged itself without human intervention in a manner inconsistent with its previous operation. A person which superficially resembled the subject emerged, though they were badly wounded, having suffered unidentified chemical burns over 60% of their body. The subject-alternate died shortly thereafter without being able to be interviewed. It remains unknown how the artifact managed to activate itself. Security was increased.

One month later, the artifact once again activated itself, this time disgorging a non-human entity, heavily armed. The entity was ultimately terminated after killing a dozen personnel and wounding twenty. The weapon in its possession behaved in a manner inconsistent with current understanding of physical law.[[footnote]]Based on a review of particle and radiation detectors in the confinement area at the time, it has been established that the weapon functions by slightly altering the magnetic moment of the neutron in affected matter, upsetting the electromagnetic balance of the nucleus, causing it to fission spontaneously. The means by which this is affected cannot be determined as the weapon was destroyed by the entity prior to being terminated.[[/footnote]] It has been remarked that in outward appearance it resembled SCP-1968. The goal or purpose of the entity has not been established. 

Containment procedures were upgraded to the level they remain at now.
