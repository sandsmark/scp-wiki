++++ NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION RECORDS AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION 

The origin of this documentation is unknown. The majority of the following data was not created by any known member of the Foundation, and takes the form of an initial document describing an anomaly designated SCP-5000 followed by a series of successive revisions. All data is unusually resistant to any form of alteration, although further documentation can be appended to the file. 

Please note that SCP-5000 does in fact exist, but that all previous revisions are outdated and must be viewed in order to understand the context in which the current and accurate documentation was written. Revisions to text are denoted in ##blue|blue## for ease of reader comprehension. We apologize for the inconvenience.

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5000 is considered to be self-containing. The use of SCP-5000 and derivative agents in Foundation operations is to continue according to the standard protocols established prior to its classification as a SCP object. The recently formed EURYDICE-9 mnestics research project is to carry out investigations into the origin and properties of SCP-5000, and monitor its effects on all Foundation personnel known to be following mnestics usage regimens. All members of the EURYDICE-9 research team are to maintain strict Class X mnestics usage and Marness-Yarrow conditioning regimens at all times. 

**Description:** SCP-5000 is the active ingredient of all Foundation-standard [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/we-need-to-talk-about-fifty-five | mnestic]]] (memory-improving) drugs. SCP-5000 displays a Type IV antimemetic trigger which induces directed retrograde amnesia, preventing personnel not under the effects of Class X or greater mnestics from consciously perceiving any amount of the substance. As a result of this characteristic affecting all Foundation personnel attempting to study SCP-5000, its anomalous properties went undiscovered for an unknown but likely extensive period of time. 

Post-discovery research carried out by the EURYDICE-9 project has confirmed SCP-5000 to be a liquid-soluble excitatory nootropic agent that markedly improves cognitive function in humans, specifically targeting the brain centers involved in memory retention to create a mnestic effect. Analysis indicates that short-term and long-term use of agents derived from SCP-5000 causes no averse side effects beyond those previously known to the Foundation, and that beyond the antimemetic trigger displayed, SCP-5000 is non-anomalous. As the antimemetic effect triggers on perception rather than human consumption, it does not interfere with the primary use of SCP-5000.

The origin of Foundation supplies of SCP-5000 is not currently known. Further investigations by the EURYDICE-9 research effort are ongoing, as supply of SCP-5000 by an unknown entity outside the Foundation may constitute a moderate security breach.

**Special Containment Procedures:** ##blue|SCP-5000 is currently thought to be uncontained. The EURYDICE-9 research project is to oversee and coordinate efforts to research, locate, catalog, and contain SCP-5000 if necessary. An automated processing system (APS5000Z24) is to monitor Foundation databases for signs of the effects of SCP-5000 on information, and is to immediately expunge any affected data in order to prevent spread of SCP-5000’s effects. Sensitive data is to be backed up immediately prior to expungement. All information pertaining to SCP-5000 and SCP-5000-1 is to be heavily encrypted and maintained in secure data storage servers, and several redundant backups are to be similarly encrypted and retained on standby at all times.##

The use of SCP-5000-1 in Foundation operations is to continue according to the standard protocols established prior to its classification as a ##blue|secondary## SCP object. The joint EURYDICE-9 mnestics research project is to carry out investigations into SCP-5000-1 and monitor its effects on all Foundation personnel known to be following mnestics usage regimens. All members of the EURYDICE-9 research team are to maintain strict Class X mnestics usage and Marness-Yarrow conditioning regimens at all times. 

**Description:** ##blue|SCP-5000 is the provisional designation for an entity or group theorized to be the source of the active ingredient of all Foundation-standard mnestics (previously designated SCP-5000, now redesignated SCP-5000-1). The existence of SCP-5000 was ascertained following extensive investigations by the EURYDICE-9 research team, which determined that the origin and history of mnestic agents could not be traced, that no record of the method by which they were produced existed, and that all information that could have previously related to any of the mentioned topics was subject to a powerful antimemetic corrosion effect that had irreversibly expunged nearly all relevant data and rendered the remainder unintelligible. The pattern of expungement was consistent with intelligent, deliberate activity, leading EURYDICE-9 researchers to posit the existence of a previously undocumented sapient anomaly with powerful antimemetic properties that had been actively hindering Foundation investigations into SCP-5000-1.##

SCP-5000-1 is an excitatory nootropic agent that creates a mnestic (memory-enhancing) effect in humans when administered and, counterintuitively, displays a Type IV antimemetic trigger inducing directed anterograde amnesia. This consequently prevents subjects not under the effects of Class X or greater mnestics from consciously perceiving any quantity of SCP-5000-1 in any way. SCP-5000-1 is the active ingredient of all Foundation-standard mnestic drugs, and was not known to be anomalous for a significant period of time due to its antimemetic properties affecting all Foundation personnel. ##blue|Due to the hypothetical actions of SCP-5000 actively hindering investigations into SCP-5000-1, the two anomalies are believed to have a relation of currently unknown nature.##

The origin of Foundation supplies of SCP-5000-1 is not currently known. Further investigations by the EURYDICE-9 project are in progress, ##blue|and are to be considered a high priority due to the ongoing security breach represented by SCP-5000’s access to Foundation data.##

The use of SCP-5000-1 in Foundation operations is to continue according to the standard protocols established prior to its classification as a secondary SCP object. The joint EURYDICE-9 mnestics research project is to carry out investigations into SCP-5000-1 and monitor its effects on all Foundation personnel known to be following mnestics usage regimens. All members of the EURYDICE-9 research team are to maintain strict Class X mnestics usage and Marness-Yarrow conditioning regimens at all times. 

##blue|The occurrence of 5000-DORO events worldwide is to be monitored and documented by the EURYDICE-9 research project. The appearance and travel of SCP-5000-2 instances is also to be recorded. All efforts are to be made to determine the point of origin of SCP-5000-2 instances.##

**Description:** SCP-5000 is the provisional designation for an entity or group theorized to be the source of the active ingredient of all Foundation-standard mnestics (previously designated SCP-5000, now redesignated SCP-5000-1). SCP-5000 is presumed to be sapient, and actively hinders Foundation investigations into the origins and properties of SCP-5000-1 by subjecting all data pertaining to the substance to a severe antimemetic corrosion and expungement effect. ##blue|The access of SCP-5000 to data is not absolute; it is unable to affect sufficiently encrypted information stored in secure data servers.## SCP-5000 has been active and operating outside of Foundation knowledge for an unknown, but presumably extensive, period of time.

SCP-5000-1 is a liquid-soluble excitatory nootropic agent that creates a mnestic (memory-enhancing) effect in humans when administered and, counterintuitively, displays a Type IV antimemetic trigger inducing directed anterograde amnesia. This consequently prevents subjects not under the effects of Class X or greater mnestics from consciously perceiving any quantity of SCP-5000-1 in any way. SCP-5000-1 is the active ingredient of all Foundation-standard mnestics, and was not known to be anomalous for a significant period of time due to its antimemetic properties affecting all Foundation personnel. Due to the actions of SCP-5000 actively hindering investigations into SCP-5000-1, the two anomalies are likely to be related.

##blue|The origin of Foundation supplies of SCP-5000-1 was previously not known; however, investigations performed by the EURYDICE-9 research effort have discovered a repeated anomalous occurrence involving the spontaneous manifestation of quantities of SCP-5000-1 in random Foundation supply sites worldwide. This occurrence (designated a 5000-DORO event) corresponds with unexplained antimemetic corruption and expungement of security footage from the involved supply sites. As determined by trial-and-error analysis, live observation of 5000-DORO events by subjects dosed with mnestic drugs allows for the perception of multiple featureless humanoid entities (designated SCP-5000-2 instances), which are observed to enter affected Foundation supply sites and deposit samples of SCP-5000-1.##

##blue|Instances of SCP-5000-2 carry Type IV antimemetic triggers which induce multiple-target short-term directed anterograde amnesia, resulting in an inability to consciously perceive instances without the use of mnestics. Additionally, SCP-5000-2 instances carry multiple memetic triggers inducing an unconscious compulsion to collect, process and utilize samples of SCP-5000-1, which invariably leads to the rapid integration of all samples into the Foundation supply chain. Following the cessation of a 5000-DORO event, all involved SCP-5000-2 instances will exit the supply facility and travel to a currently unknown location, hypothesized to be their point of origin. High-speed shutter photography has determined the speed of traveling instances to exceed 8 km/s.##

##blue|Given the similar method of antimemetic censoring observed, it is highly probable that SCP-5000 or an affiliated entity or group is responsible for 5000-DORO events. Further research into 5000-DORO events and SCP-5000-2 instances is in progress, and is to be considered an extremely high priority due to the ongoing severe security breach represented by SCP-5000’s unimpeded access to Foundation data and operations. The covert implantation of a GPS tracking module into a select SCP-5000-2 instance in order to monitor its travel following a 5000-DORO event is currently pending.##

The occurrence of 5000-DORO events worldwide and the activities of SCP-5000-2 instances are to be monitored and documented by the EURYDICE-9 research project. ##blue|A provisional research site has been constructed directly adjacent to SCP-5000-3; on-site EURYDICE-9 personnel are to log the appearance and behavior of all observed SCP-5000-2 instances. A security task force is to be stationed 10m from the entrance to SCP-5000-3 at all times, and is to enforce a guarded perimeter around the location.

Additionally, SCP-5000-2 instances carry multiple memetic triggers inducing an unconscious compulsion to collect, process and utilize samples of SCP-5000-1. The arrival of SCP-5000-2 instances at Foundation supply outposts denotes the occurrence of a 5000-DORO event, during which instances will deposit samples of SCP-5000-1 in several secure cargo holds. The memetic triggers carried by SCP-5000-2 instances invariably result in the rapid integration of all deposited SCP-5000-1 into the Foundation supply chain. The status of SCP-5000-2 instances as sapient is currently unconfirmed.

##blue|Following the cessation of a 5000-DORO event, all participating SCP-5000-2 instances will exit the involved supply facility and travel at speeds exceeding 8 km/s to their assumed point of origin, SCP-5000-3. SCP-5000-3 was discovered following the covert implantation of a GPS tracking module into a select SCP-5000-2 instance, and is a cavern located on the north face of Mt. Helicon in Boeotia, [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4160 | Greece]]]. A section of SCP-5000-3 is open to the air and contains a single fissure 315 mm from the mouth of the cave, which is connected to a subterranean freshwater aquifer. The water originating from this aquifer collects in a marble bowl placed nearby and is regularly removed by SCP-5000-2 instances prior to 5000-DORO events. Collected water samples have been found to contain high concentrations of dissolute SCP-5000-1. The primary section of SCP-5000-3 extends approximately 4.5 m into Mt. Helicon, at which point it descends into an extensive and currently unmapped network of tunnels. SCP-5000-2 instances periodically enter and exit these tunnels. Automated and remotely controlled vehicles consistently break down and fail immediately following entry into any section of SCP-5000-3, preventing unmanned exploration.##

##blue|The proposal of a manned exploratory mission by MTF Rho-7 (“Tunnel Vision”) into SCP-5000-3 is currently pending, and is to be considered an extremely high priority due to the ongoing severe security breach represented by SCP-5000’s unimpeded access to Foundation data and operations, as well as the possibility of direct containment of SCP-5000 if it is discovered to be extant within SCP-5000-3.##

> I don’t have much time. I’m recording this in what’s left of the file they’re keeping in the DEEPWELL server in [DATA CORRUPTED], but it’ll break into here too sooner or later. I dosed myself with the last syringe of Class Z mnestics, so it can’t get to me without killing me outright. We have to know what happened. If anyone out there still remembers, read this while you can.
> 
> It was the fucking camcorder log. I don’t know how EURYDICE-9 never figured that out. Or maybe one of them did, and the poor bastard just didn’t get a chance to tell anyone before it got him. Anyway, what that thing said at the end was a low-level infohazard. Just wiped the mind of anyone who read it. Or that was what we thought at first. Thing is, we eventually realized we couldn’t expunge it. It kept remaking itself, and then it started duplicating. Before long, it was spreading. It got into the rest of the database, spammed lethal cognitohazards and infohazards everywhere, wiped the original 5000 file and almost every redundant backup we had. We were frantically expunging left and right, but we just couldn’t keep up with the thing. When it made the jump to our paper records, that was the end. Too many people saw them. She reached into their minds, made them hers and turned them against us.
> 
> EURYDICE-9 is almost gone now. They’ve just been losing people, one by one. Some kind of acute antimemetic contamination, I think, making sure nothing they do will ever have an effect on the world again. The Class Z is the only reason I can even remember any of that, and not even it will let me see them anymore. Everyone else is forgetting. And I mean everyone. The entire Foundation. We’re all forgetting her, everything to do with her, and it’s exactly what she wants. [DATA CORRUPTED]eally gave us mnestics because she wanted us to remember, why did it have to end like this? Why does she have to make us forget again? Are we not even allowed to remember why? 
> 
> No. No, no, no. Fuck this, fuck her. I'm [DATA CORRUPTED] this stand. No one is allowed to play with humanity's minds like this. A mystery like this is meant to be solved, not to be left alone forever. Someone, somewhere, sometime, is going to read this, and they'll figure it out. I'll make sure of it. I’ll break the cycle. Οι αναμνήσεις δεν πεθαίνουν ποτέ. Οι αναμνήσεις δεν πεθαίνουν ποτέ. They're almost in, but they won't get to this document. I won't let them.

| caption=Standard derivative agents of SCP-5000-1.]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** The actions of Field Agent Theo Ferndale in the line of duty have enabled a set of theoretical containment procedures to be devised. SCP-5000 is considered self-containing provided all Foundation personnel follow the detailed procedures. Further information beyond these procedures is restricted to personnel carrying Level 4/5000 clearance.

Investigation into the active ingredient, properties, history and origins of mnestic drugs is not to be carried out, so as to maintain the docile state of SCP-5000. The recently formed EURYDICE-9 mnestics research effort has been summarily disbanded and all participating personnel have been reassigned to separate sites. The use of SCP-5000-1 in Foundation operations is to continue according to the standard protocols established prior to its classification as a secondary SCP object. An automated processing system (APS5000A42) is to passively monitor Foundation databases for signs of the effects of SCP-5000 and alert all personnel carrying 4/5000 clearance in the event that signs are observed. 

Further investigation into the nature and motivations of SCP-5000 is forbidden.

**Description:** SCP-5000 is a sapient [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4260 | essophysical]]] entity responsible for the production and distribution of SCP-5000-1, the active ingredient of all Foundation-standard mnestics. SCP-5000 possesses reality-altering memetic and antimemetic abilities of uncertain scope, and is theorized to be motivated by a desire to render humanity at large ignorant to its own existence while simultaneously providing humanity a method of perceiving and responding to antimemetic anomalies in the form of SCP-5000-1. 

The reasoning behind the contradictory motivations of SCP-5000 is uncertain. Further investigation into the matter has been deemed impractical due to the documented tendency of SCP-5000 to become aggravated when directly confronted. It is theorized that the Foundation has discovered the existence of SCP-5000 one or more times previously, and that improper conduct has resulted in the repeated erasure of all memory of these discoveries by SCP-5000. It is therefore considered to be imperative that the ultimate nature and goals of SCP-5000 remain unknown.

> = [[size x-large]]Notice from O5 Council[[/size]]
> ------
> There are those who have criticized the decision to halt investigations into the motivations of SCP-5000, citing our policies against unnecessary concessions to anomalies. It must be said that these measures are entirely necessary. As an essophysical entity, SCP-5000 exerts a phenomenal effect on our universe merely by existing; furthermore, it is clearly temperamental, difficult to communicate with, and documented to respond poorly to both investigative attempts and negotiation efforts. Therefore, the only alternative to our current containment procedures is neutralization- and beyond being near-completely unworkable, the termination of an essophysical entity would have grave and far-reaching repercussions.
> 
> Whether SCP-5000 is truly acting in the best interests of humanity, or even if it believes itself to be doing so, is uncertain. All that is known is that the actions of Theo Ferndale have allowed us to narrowly free ourselves from a cycle of memory and forgetting that may well have repeated for as long as our Foundation has existed, or even [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/immemorial | before it]]]. Our tenuous, limited hold on knowledge of SCP-5000's existence is too precious to risk losing, and it would be all too easy for SCP-5000 to discover our knowledge of it, erase it all once more, and render our containment efforts null and void. Believe me when I say this: some mysteries are better left unsolved.
