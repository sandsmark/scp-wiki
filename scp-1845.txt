**Item #:** SCP-1845


**Object Class:** Euclid


**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1845 is to be housed in a fully enclosed indoor habitat simulating a North American rainforest, 15 meters x 15 meters x 13 meters. The floor of the room is to be recessed 3 meters below the main entry door and filled with earth. Greenery and a small pool of water are to be provided and an artificial day-night cycle simulated by lighting. Cameras capable of low-light recording will be installed as necessary to minimize existence of blind spots and SCP-1845 is to be monitored by cameras whenever possible. SCP-1845 is to be fed twice a day as appropriate for a normal animal of his species. A keyboard and monitor shall be installed along one wall of the room to facilitate communication between SCP-1845 and agents Level 2 or higher. 

No mammals or birds are to be transported into facility except for testing purposes. All such animals exposed to SCP-1845 will be considered examples of SCP-1845-1; such animals are to be kept in separate habitats from each other and SCP-1845, out of visual or auditory range, until effects have dissipated. All such animals exposed to SCP-1845-1 will be considered examples of SCP-1845-2 and will be kept in a similar fashion. All examples of SCP-1845-1 or SCP-1845-2 are to be kept quarantined for one week after exposure and terminated if any lingering signs of intelligence are demonstrated.

Facility housing SCP-1845 is to be surrounded with barbed wire fence and major vegetation within 100 meters of the perimeter cleared. Armed guards will patrol the perimeter at all times. All mammals or birds attempting to cross the perimeter of the facility are to be terminated.

During good behavior, SCP-1845 is to be allowed access to a Bible (Douay-Rheims or Latin Vulgate), and a Roman Catholic priest retained by the Foundation will be allowed to enter its habitat to hear confession and grant it Communion. SCP-1845 will also, during good behavior, be allowed access to literature pertaining to medieval European history, culture, and philosophy. 

SCP-1845' habitat is to be inspected weekly and any burrows dug by it will be examined by remote camera. Any evidence of tools intended for escape, communication, weaponry, starting fires, or interference with cameras will result in loss of priveliges.

SCP-1845 is not to be addressed by its assumed name or title or any form of courtesy address. SCP-1845 is currently of the belief that it is a political prisoner and its allies will ransom or rescue it in the near future; it is not to be disabused of this notion.

Under no circumstances should SCP-1845 be made aware of the existence of SCP-1006 or of any non-human mammalian or avian SCP.


**Description:** SCP-1845 is a male American red fox (vulpes vulpes fulvus), approximately 3 years old at the time it entered Foundation custody in 20██. Physiologically SCP-1845 is similar to most wild-born foxes of its age, bearing several scars on its abdomen and limbs from fights. Unlike most of its species, SCP-1845 posesses a near human level of intelligence and has demonstrated an ability to fashion tools out of rocks and plant matter. Objects created by SCP-1845 have included;

* A sling made from bark and twigs.
* A small hatchet with a wooden handle and a sharpened piece of flint for its blade.
* A firestarter.
* A flute-like instrument made from a hollowed-out reed.
* A flint carving knife.
* A spear-like weapon apparently intended to be mounted to its back pointing forward.
* A small catapult.
* Several shades of ochre paint.
* Several crosses and religious icons carved or painted (using above-mentioned ochre) on wooden surfaces or habitat walls.
* A small raft.
* A tarp designed to cover the entrance of its burrows.
* A set of rosary beads.

While unable to speak, SCP-1845 has demonstrated an ability to read modern and archaic forms of English, French, Spanish, German, and Latin, and has proven able to type in any of these languages using a provided keyboard. SCP-1845 exclusively refers to itself in first-person plural (i.e., "the royal we").

SCP-1845 considers itself to be of royal heritage and identifies itself using the title "His Royal Highness, Eugenio the Second, by the Grace of God, King of the Forest, Lord of the Plains, Duke of the Grand Fir and the Undergrowth, Count of the Swamp, Margrave of ██ ███████ State Park, Warden of All the Streams and Rivers, and Lord Protector of the Cities of Man, Defender of the Faith." SCP-1845 identifies itself as a Roman Catholic and appears to be extremely devout in its devotions - it has been observed on video praying over its meals and observing holidays and saintly feast days. SCP-1845 has demonstrated a broad body of knowledge relating to medieval European feudalism, Roman Catholic theology, ancient Greek and Roman history and mythology, and the works of Homer, Aristotle, Livy, Josephus, Chaucer, Mallory, Bodin, Shakespeare, and Cervantes (though it expresses a strong distaste for the latter.)

Upon encountering any mammal or bird, SCP-1845 will begin to vocalize in its direction in a manner not observed among other individuals of its species. After approximately 3-5 minutes of such vocalization, said animal acquires human-like intelligence on a slightly lower level than SCP-1845 itself (though not its range of knowledge). These animals, referred to as SCP-1845-1, appear to be able to communicate with SCP-1845 and each other by body language and vocalization regardless of species and demonstrate a considerable amount of loyalty to SCP-1845. As long as SCP-1845-1 remains in contact with SCP-1845 this ability persists; within 24 hours of separation, heightened intelligence begins to fade. After 72 hours all affected animals have returned to normal behavior and demonstrate no evidence of lingering after-effects. SCP-1845 refers to examples of SCP-1845-1 as its "knights" and "gentry", and claims to assign them titles such as "Duke of the Elm", "Countess of the █████████ Trail", or "Knight of the Thistle".

Examples of SCP-1845-1 are similarly able to transmit this intelligence to other animals, which are designated SCP-1845-2. Such animals display less intelligence than SCP-1845 or SCP-1845-1 and perseverence of effect is on average 62% that of SCP-1845-1. SCP-1845 refers to these individuals as "serfs" or "the common folk". Direct communication with any SCP-1845-1 or SCP-1845-2 has yet to be achieved as they lack the ability to read. Both have demonstrated the ability to use tools designed by SCP-1845 or to build tools under its direct supervision, but appear to lack the ingenuity to design them themselves.

SCP-1845 came to the attention of the Foundation in 20██ when reports of unusual animal behavior and attacks against humans and other animals began appearing frequently in the vicinity of ███████, ██. Preliminary investigate units were forced to retreat after being viciously attacked by a group of raccoons, ducks, squirrels and feral cats with what appeared to be red war paint smeared across their faces. A Mobile Task Force was dispatched which discovered that two groups of animals of assorted species, wearing red and black paint respectively, were apparently "at war" with each other in an area extending across several hundred square kilometers of ██████████ and bleeding into the ███████ and ██████ metropolitan areas. SCP-1845 was identified by observation as apparently commanding the red-painted forces and was captured after being shot with several tranquilizer darts in a raid near █████████ that resulted in the deaths of ██ Task Force members. The "war" dissipated two days after SCP-1845' capture, though lingering SCP-1845-1 and SCP-1845-2 activity persisted for several weeks and required the termination of several hundred animals. Foundation assets in the media attributed the behavior and attacks to a chemical spill in the █████ █████. 

The origin of SCP-1845' knowledge and abilities is unknown. SCP-1845 refuses to directly answer the question and responds to all inquiries on the subject by discussing its royal heritage and the divine right of kings.


**Addendum:** In an interview conducted on ██/██/20██, SCP-1845 claimed that the cause of the "war" that lead to its discovery and capture was an uprising on the part of one of its "subjects", a Columbian black-tailed deer (odocoileus hemionus columbianus) it identified as "Duke Baxter of the West Bay." SCP-1845 spoke vitriolically of said deer, describing it as "a most uncouth usurper, rogue, and Protestant" who had assassinated it heirs and turned a large portion of the nobility against it. It insists that the deer is still at large and marshalling its forces against its nation, and that once it is released from captivity it will defeat it and punish its rebellious vassals, and that once that war is complete, "We shall exercise our dominion over the Cities of Man in actual, and [DATA EXPUNGED]."

It is not clear whether the "Duke Baxter" described by SCP-1845 is an SCP-1845-1 or another animal with similar abilities to SCP-1845 itself. No sign of any animal behavior indicative of SCP-1845 influence has been observed in ██████████ since shortly after its capture. Foundation wildlife surveys will be conducted on a regular basis for any sign thereof.
