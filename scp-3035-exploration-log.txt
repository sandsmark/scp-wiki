The following audio and video log describes events on 02/26/1982, involving MTF Gamma-3 ("Three Wolf Moon") during the Foundation's initial attempt to re-establish contact with [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3035 Site-573] after a catastrophic containment breach.

> **<BEGIN LOG>**
> 
> **(00:00:00) MOON:** Role-call.
> 
> **(00:00:04) WOLF 1:** Wolf 1, here.
> 
> **(00:00:07) WOLF 2:** Wolf 2, //awrrooooooooo!//
> 
> **(00:00:13) WOLF 3:** Wolf 3, //caaaaawrroooooooooooo-kie-crisps!//
> 
> **(00:00:16) MOON:** Alright, enough dicking around. Turning on the video-feed. Control, you getting visual?
> 
> //A shoulder-mounted feed activates, providing a view at the bottom of a vertical shaft approximately 5 yards in diameter. Directly in front of the camera -- on the shaft's wall -- there is a large metal door with a small control panel and several metal rods threaded through the frame, sealing it shut.//
> 
> **(00:00:23) CONTROL:** Yes, we're getting it.
> 
> **(00:00:27) MOON:** Good. Alright, we're moving forward.
> 
> //The view shifts as Moon moves toward the door. A gloved hand extends forward, keying something into the control panel. The door produces a noise as the steel rods begin to retract; a hissing sound is heard as the vacuum is broken.//
> 
> **(00:00:42) MOON:** Remember. If it ain't human, splatter it. That goes for anything -- even the cockroaches. //Especially// the cockroaches.
> 
> //The door retracts into the wall. Past it, there is a passageway extending 50 yards into the facility; lights flicker in and out. The walls are splattered with a dark, brown-black substance; the same substance is spread across the floor. Small piles of objects -- broken office equipment, shattered test-tubes, crumped cardboard boxes, and heaps of what appear to be internal organs in a state of advanced decomposition -- are spread across the hall.//
> 
> **(00:00:53) WOLF 2:** Jesus.
> 
> **(00:00:56) MOON:** You getting this, Control? Seeing the corridor?
> 
> **(00:01:01) CONTROL:** Yes. Proceed with caution. Remember, the primary purpose of this is recon; rescue any personnel you can, but do not put yourself or your team in jeopardy.
> 
> **(00:01:11) MOON:** Understood. Wolf 1, stay by the door. You see anything not human...
> 
> **(00:01:17) WOLF 1:** Light it up. Got it.
> 
> **(00:01:22) MOON:** Proceeding forward. Wolf 2, Wolf 3, with me.
> 
> //The view moves into the facility. It briefly swivels to examine the control panel on the facility-side of the door; several handprints mar its surface.//
> 
> **(00:01:28) MOON:** Looks like somebody tried to escape.
> 
> **(00:01:33) WOLF 3:** Fuck. 
> 
> **(00:01:38) MOON:** Keep moving.
> 
> //The view swings away from the control panel; it turns back to corridor ahead. In the distance -- 20 yards ahead -- a figure is hunched over something. The figure is white, but covered in splatters of red and brown.//
> 
> **(00:01:43) WOLF 3:** Fuck!
> 
> **(00:01:45) MOON:** Don't move! Hands up! 
> 
> //The camera shifts as Moon takes aim with his assault rifle. The figure moves, slowly, standing with its back turned. Though still hard to make out, the figure appears to be a human technician clad in a blood-splattered lab coat. Slowly, the figure starts to turn to face the camera.//
> 
> **(00:01:52) MOON:** Put your fucking hands up! Are you human?! Talk!
> 
> //The figure raises its hands.//
> 
> **(00:01:59) (AUDIO):** ...haaaalp... haaalp...
> 
> **(00:02:05) WOLF 2:** Is that a friendly?
> 
> **(00:02:09) WOLF 3:** Sounds hurt.
> 
> **(00:02:10) MOON:** Don't move. Don't move. 
> 
> //The camera moves forward slowly. The figure's hands rise up a little higher.//
> 
> **(00:02:22) MOON:** Alright. Talk to me, man. We're here to get you out of here, but you need to talk to me.
> 
> **(00:02:28) (AUDIO):** ...haaaalp... haaaalp meeee...
> 
> //The camera is now within ten yards of the figure. Here, it pauses; the muzzle of Moon's gun is visible.//
> 
> **(00:02:36) MOON:** Gonna need to give me more than that, buddy. Alright? Relax. Keep your hands up. Tell me your name. What's your name?
> 
> **(00:02:42) (AUDIO):** ...staaaaahp...
> 
> //The figure's entire body suddenly shivers. The 'fabric' of the lab coat ripples and vibrates. A faint buzzing fills the room. A second set of arms emerge from behind the figure, followed by the lab coat expanding outward to reveal that it is actually a set of transluscent white insect-wings.//
> 
> **(00:02:48) MOON:** Oh shit.
> 
> //The figure lunges forward at incredible speed. The camera jerks back, before crashing to the ground; the only thing that can be seen now is the ceiling, along with occasional flashes of muzzle-fire.//
> 
> **(00:02:52) WOLF 2:** Contact! We have contact! We have contact!
> 
> **(00:02:55) WOLF 3:** It's fucking -- that's not a fucking //roach// what the fuck is that--
> 
> //Gunfire continues for several more seconds. Something very large briefly flutters over the camera feed. The sound of buzzing -- like insect wings -- can be heard.//
> 
> **(00:02:58) WOLF 2:** Open fire! Open fire!
> 
> **(00:03:02) WOLF 1:** Fucking -- grab Moon! Get him and get back here!
> 
> //More gunfire. More dark shadows. The sound of buzzing intensifies.//
> 
> **(00:03:05) WOLF 3:** Jesus fuck what the //fuck// is that--
> 
> **(00:03:10) WOLF 2:** FUCK! FUCK! 
> 
> //More gunfire. More shadows. More buzzing.//
> 
> **(00:03:18) WOLF 2:** Retreat! Pull back! Pull back!
> 
> **(00:03:23) WOLF 1:** Where the fuck is Moon?!
> 
> **(00:03:28) WOLF 2:** He's still in there, we can't -- fucking -- //do you see that//--
> 
> **(00:03:33) WOLF 1:** Oh //shit// get back pull back get out--
> 
> //More gunfire. More shadows. More buzzing.//
> 
> **(00:03:42) WOLF 3:** Close the door! Close the door! Don't let them--
> 
> //For the next forty five seconds, nothing is heard except gunfire, buzzing, and screams. Eventually, these cease. The remainder of the log is the video feed and its audio.//
> 
> **(00:04:38) (AUDIO):** //(unintelligible chittering)//
> 
> //A large shape looms over the camera view briefly, before the camera starts to move. Given the angle and scraping sounds heard, it can be presumed that something is dragging Moon deeper down the passageway.//
> 
> //This continues for an additional minute. After approximately 5 minutes, Moon has been dragged into another chamber. Examination of Site-573's blueprints indicate that this room is one of several laboratories used for dissection.//
> 
> **(00:09:52) (AUDIO):** Haaaaaalp meeeeee...
> 
> //Moon -- along with the camera -- are lifted, and placed upon a table.//
> 
> //Three creatures stand over Moon and the camera. Although the lighting is poor, one can make out what appear to be humanoid forms. Their 'faces' are mask-like, and apparently made of chitin -- resembling a poor approximation of a human's visage.//
> 
> //The creatures extend their 'hands' down toward Moon, who is, given his lack of responsiveness, presumed to be dead. The hands are sharpened, serrated forelegs. As they extend these forelegs down, the sound of ripping fabric and meat becomes audible.//
> 
> **(00:09:55) (AUDIO):** Staaaahp... Nooooo...
> 
> //In the distance, a scream of 'no' is heard. Audio analysis confirms this is distinctly different than previous sounds throughout the file. One of the figures turns and moves in what is presumed to be the direction of the screaming.//
> 
> //One of the forelegs presumably cuts through the power cable for Moon's camera. The feed immediately ends.//
> 
> **<END LOG>**

MTF Gamma-8 ("Game Over Man") was mobilized shortly after; they successfully cleared the primary entry-chamber and retrieved Wolf 1, Wolf 2, and Wolf 3's corpses. Moon's corpse has yet to be recovered.
