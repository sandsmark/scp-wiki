> **<Begin Log.>**
> 
> **MOON:** Role-call.
> 
> **WOLF 1:** Wolf 1, here.
> 
> **WOLF 2:** Wolf 2, //awwrrroooooooo!//
> 
> **WOLF 3:** Wolf 3, //caaawwrroooooo-kie crisps!//
> 
> **MOON:** Alright, enough dicking around. Control, you receiving this?
> 
> **CONTROL:** Loud and clear.
> 
> **MOON:** Good. Alright, we're opening the entrance.
> 
> //(Pneumatic hissing; sound of metal grinding.)//
> 
> **MOON:** Respirators on. Stay sharp.
> 
> **WOLF 2:** //(gagging)// ...Jesus. I can almost smell this through my skin.
> 
> **MOON:** Lighting is low, the floor... covered with some sort of sludge. Brown-black. Garbage everywhere -- crumpled cardboard boxes, office supplies... uh, looks like -- some rotting meat, too...
> 
> **CONTROL:** Understood. Remember, Commander, your primary mission is just recon. Rescue any personnel you can, but do not put yourself or your team in jeopardy.
> 
> **MOON:** Understood. Holy fuck, this place is disgusting. Wolf 1, stay by the door. Anything not-human tries to get out...
> 
> **WOLF 1:** Light it up. Got it.
> 
> **MOON:** Proceeding forward. Wolf 2, Wolf 3, with me.
> 
> **MOON:** Control panel on the other side's got some bloody hand-prints on it. Looks like somebody tried to escape.
> 
> **WOLF 3:** Fuck.
> 
> **MOON:** Keep moving.
> 
> **WOLF 2:** Up ahead!
> 
> **MOON:** Put your fucking hands up! Are you human? Talk!
> 
> **UNIDENTIFIED:** //(muffled, distant)// Help...
> 
> **WOLF 2:** Is that a friendly?
> 
> **WOLF 3:** Sounds hurt.
> 
> **MOON:** Don't move. Control, looks like... about 15 yards up, a technician in a lab-coat. On his knees. S'got some blood on him, he might be hurt--
> 
> **CONTROL:** Be careful.
> 
> **MOON:** Approaching. Hey! Hey. Talk to me, man. We're here to get you out, but you need to talk to me.
> 
> **UNIDENTIFIED:** //(muffled)// Stop...
> 
> **MOON:** Gonna need to give me more than that, buddy. Alright? Relax. Keep your hands up. Tell me your name. What's your name?
> 
> **UNIDENTIFIED:** //(muffled)// Please, no...
> 
> **MOON:** Oh. Oh, shit.
> 
> **WOLF 3:** What's going on? You alright?
> 
> **MOON:** Stay where you are! Nobody fucking move, just... stay calm. Control?
> 
> **CONTROL:** Come back.
> 
> **MOON:** Control, I think this is one of the roaches.
> 
> **CONTROL:** Wait. You said it was a lab technician--
> 
> **MOON:** At a distance, it looked like -- look, its face is just, like... a chitin-mask. And it's...
> 
> **CONTROL:** What is it doing?
> 
> **UNIDENTIFIED:** //(distorted, muffled sobbing sounds)//
> 
> **MOON:** I think... it looks like... it's begging?
> 
> **WOLF 2:** Down the hall!
> 
> //(distant radio chirping sounds)//
> 
> **MOON:** Shit -- two of them, //big// ones, they--
> 
> //(distant, angry, garbled roaring sounds)//
> 
> //(gunfire)//
> 
> **WOLF 3:** Fuck!
> 
> **WOLF 2:** Contact! Contact!
> 
> **MOON:** Take cover!
> 
> //(gunfire stops)//
> 
> **WOLF 1:** Am I holding position?
> 
> **MOON:** Yes, hold position -- everyone alright? Anyone hit?
> 
> **WOLF 3:** Negative, I'm good.
> 
> **WOLF 2:** We both got cover.
> 
> **MOON:** Fuck. //Fuck//. Since when do these things have--
> 
> //(gunfire)//
> 
> **MOON:** Fuck!
> 
> //(gunfire continues)//
> 
> **MOON:** ...what the hell?
> 
> //(gunfire continues)//
> 
> **MOON:** What the //hell//?
> 
> **WOLF 3:** Are you alright, Moon?!
> 
> **MOON:** Stay where you are. Stay where you are, both of you.
> 
> //(gunfire continues)//
> 
> **MOON:** //(laughing)// Well, now I've seen everything.
> 
> **WOLF 2:** What is it?
> 
> **MOON:** Goddamn roaches.
> 
> //(six more shots, distinctly louder and clearer)//
> 
> //(gunfire ceases)//
> 
> **MOON:** Hallway's clear.
> 
> **WOLF 3:** What just happened? 
> 
> **MOON:** They don't have guns. They've got gun-shaped hands. They were waving them around and making gunshot noises.
> 
> **WOLF 2:** Are you... are you shitting me?
> 
> **WOLF 3:** That's fucking hilarious.
> 
> **MOON:** You catch all that, Control? Please advise.
> 
> **CONTROL:** Affirmative. Proceed with caution.
> 
> **MOON:** Proceeding. Wolf 2, Wolf 3, on point.
> 
> **WOLF 3:** Jesus. How the hell did these things compromise a site?
> 
> **MOON:** Up ahead. You see that?
> 
> **WOLF 2:** Barricade. 
> 
> **WOLF 3:** Survivors?
> 
> **MOON:** Could be. C'mon.
> 
> **WOLF 2:** Supplies, looks like -- yeah, this looks recent, too. Managed to hold up a fort against the bugs.
> 
> **WOLF 3:** Hey! -- look, is that --
> 
> **MOON:** Hey! Hey, hands up, start talking--
> 
> **WOLF 2:** Fuck. She's running away--
> 
> **WOLF 3:** Is that a survivor? Or is it--
> 
> **MOON:** Fucking... it's hard to tell in this light. She went into the bathroom. Wolf 2, with me. Wolf 3, take point on the entrance -- don't want to end up pinned inside there.
> 
> **WOLF 3:** Copy.
> 
> **MOON:** Let's take it easy, now...
> 
> //(door opening)//
> 
> **WOLF 2:** Jesus.
> 
> //(soft, muffled whimpering)//
> 
> **MOON:** Hey. Hey, you there? We're humans. We're here to take you home. Just come out, hands up, okay...?
> 
> //(whimpering grows more pronounced)//
> 
> **MOON:** She's in the back stall, I think.
> 
> **WOLF 2:** Moon, there's a body in this stall, over here--
> 
> **WOLF 3:** Hey! Hey, you! Hands up! Come over here -- we're the rescue team! We're -- shit!
> 
> **MOON:** Wolf 3? What's going on?
> 
> **WOLF 3:** Fuck. //Fuck//. I just saw -- somebody down the hall, on our side of the barricade. They saw me, then started running away--
> 
> **MOON:** Human?
> 
> **WOLF 3:** I... I think so, yeah, I saw the face, it looked human, but they ran--
> 
> **MOON:** Alright, let's finish in here, and--
> 
> //(ear-piercing scream)//
> 
> //(scuffling, shouts)//
> 
> **WOLF 2:** Fuck! Fuck!
> 
> //(two gunshots)//
> 
> **WOLF 2:** Fucking... //FUCK!//
> 
> **MOON:** Calm down. Calm down. Let me look at it.
> 
> **WOLF 2:** It was... Jesus-fuck.
> 
> **WOLF 3:** You alright in there?
> 
> **MOON:** Roach in the stall. Wolf 2 got stabbed, doesn't look critical. 
> 
> **WOLF 2:** You know this shit is going to get infected--
> 
> **MOON:** Relax. We're getting out of here. Control, you copy?
> 
> **CONTROL:** Come back.
