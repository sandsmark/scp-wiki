**Item #:** SCP-1157

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-1157 are to be kept in separate 3m x 2m x 3m quarters connected to a secure common area in Sector-07. Curfew is to be enforced at 11pm EST every evening until 6am the following morning. Security must consist of 12 armed guards trained in crowd suppression.

Mobile Task Force Gamma-7 "Pied Pipers" has been formed to track down and detain any un-contained instances of SCP-1157. Basic information, photographs, fingerprints and DNA samples from SCP-1157 have been distributed to major law enforcement organizations. Coordination with local government and other MTF units will be approved on a case by case basis. Lethal force has been authorized as a last resort.

During a bifurcation event SCP-1157 personnel are to initiate Protocol-G7 before wake up call.

**Description:** SCP-1157 is a Caucasian male with brown hair and blue eyes. The subject's anomalous nature was first discovered when an instance of SCP-1157 was arrested for fraud in ███████, AZ. When a bifurcation event occurred while SCP-1157 was in police custody the subject was brought to the attention of the Foundation and transferred to Sector-07 for containment and study.

At intervals of approximately 4 weeks all instances of SCP-1157 will undergo a simultaneous bifurcation event at 3:08AM EST. While SCP-1157 sleeps each subject will split into two identical instances. The event is accompanied by a burst of light and energy which disables any recording devices. Any clothing or other items worn by SCP-1157 will be deposited on the bed underneath the subjects.

Protocol-G7 is to be enacted immediately after every bifurcation event. The containment area is to be flooded with a gaseous sedative. A security team equipped with gas masks must enter the containment quarters and remove one of each resulting subject pairs for euthanasia, study and disposal.

Based on subject interviews, at the time of SCP-1157's initial detention at least 5 bifurcation events had already occurred. During containment there have been 3 observed events. To the best estimation the current status of SCP-1157 is as follows:
* 28 instances contained.
* 16 instances confirmed deceased.
* 45 instances euthanized during containment.
* 120 instances unaccounted for.

**Addendum 1:** Initial interviews with instances of SCP-1157 revealed a narcissistic personality and resistance to discussing the subject's condition and plans. While repeated interrogations have produced actionable intelligence that has led to the capture of other instances, SCP-1157 remains uncooperative. //- Psychological profile conducted by Dr. Torres//

**06/21/20██**
Utilizing intelligence gathered from SCP-1157 interrogations, MTF Gamma-7 successfully located and detained 3 more instances of SCP-1157. All subjects were caught completely unaware, leading me to believe that SCP-1157 does not share any sort of telepathic or hive mind abilities. However, operations for the next several weeks turned up only empty apartments and dead ends. The sudden, unexplained disappearance of fellow SCP-1157 likely drove the remainder into hiding.

Intercepting e-mail correspondence between loose SCP-1157 allowed us to locate a safe house used by numerous subjects. MTF Gamma-7 was met with small-arms fire upon engagement, forced to terminate 2 instances, captured 7. Computers and correspondence found on the property indicate that SCP-1157 is aware that an organization is tracking them, but they have no knowledge of the Foundation itself. Requesting a clean-up team to scour the property for any other evidence of SCP-1157 activities.

Agent Thomas was lost in our latest engagement with SCP-1157, along with 2 other Gamma-7 members. The bastards have spent the last month training and stockpiling. The warehouse we tracked a subject to held enough SCP-1157 to outnumber us 3-to-1, all armed. Even after capturing 16 and killing 31 there are likely even more SCP-1157 unaccounted for now than there were when we first discovered them. I'm submitting a request for at least a tripling of Gamma-7's numbers and resources. If we don't lock this down in the next month or two we're going to start seeing these guys on every street corner.

**Addendum 3:** On 09/22/20██ the contained instances of SCP-1157 attempted a riot to break out of Sector-07 immediately following a bifurcation event. Using their increased numbers SCP-1157 assaulted the Protocol-G7 team. Reinforcements allowed security to resolve the situation, at which point Protocol-G7 was completed without further incident. Containment procedures were revised and SCP-1157 were restricted to individual quarters for one week. 5 days later each instance of SCP-1157 carved the following into the wall of their quarters: //"You cannot contain me. Should one escape your grasp thousands will arise within the year."//

Notes: //Requests to have contained instances of SCP-1157 reduced in number denied. - O██//
