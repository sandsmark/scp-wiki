**Item #:** SCP-4128

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4128 is to be held in a Humanoid Containment Cell. The cell should be modified to fit the following specifications:

* Walls should be constructed using modular concrete panels, made from a special proprietary blend of concrete and additives for extreme strength. 

* Each individual panel should measure 30 cm in width. Additionally, it is advised that these panels be lined with a polyether-based polyurethane padding with viscoelastic properties.

* A Class 2 Titan Vault Door is to be installed in replacement of standard cell entry-way.

* Standard ventilation is to be installed with a separated gas supply system. In the event of a containment breach, the system will dispense a Class-B sedative nerve agent. 

Transport teams of SCP-4128 should be equipped with an aerosolized anesthetic. SCP-4128 is currently held within Site-88 on Floor 18. An on-site psychiatrist should conduct a full psychological evaluation check every two weeks.

**Description:** SCP-4128 is a human male formerly know as Samson Sachs. The entity claims to be 108 years old, despite appearance being that of middle age. Saliva-based testing has confirmed genetic makeup to be of human origin. 

SCP-4128's most notable anomalous property is its incredible mark of strength and endurance. SCP-4128 is capable of lifting 3,500 kg with ease and shows great effort when lifting over 20,000 kg. Additionally, SCP-4128 can sprint at a top speed of approximately 85 km/h, as well as perform an 18-meter vertical leap. The epidermic cells of the entity are formed from a polymeric protein, giving it an innate ability to withstand extreme physical trauma. SCP-4128's bones are eight times denser than that of the average human. [[footnote]]This is most likely a case of sclerosteosis. [[/footnote]] 

**Discovery:** SCP-4128's existence was first discovered in 1975 through the Foundation’s A.S.R.P.[[footnote]] Anomalous Signature Recognition Program; Program marked the Foundation’s first use of algorithms as a means of detecting anomalous phenomena and was vital in the discovery of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4666 SCP-4666]. [[/footnote]], when correlating reports of a man performing impossible feats of strength came to light. The first confirmed instance by the Foundation occurred when witnesses reported a semi-truck accident in ██████, Belgium. A woman reportedly lodged the front half of her car under a tractor-trailer. While awaiting first-responders, a man approached the vehicle and proceeded to pull it out by the frame. 

A cover story disguised the incident as an instance of hysterical strength. Following this event, a forty-eight-year hunt for SCP-4128 ensued, before recovery on  ███ ██, 2018 in Brooklyn, New York. This event is detailed in Recovery Incident Document-4128.  

A sample timeline of notable confirmed SCP-4128 activities, designated as L.E. (//Limited Edition//) Events, are reported within Evidence Documentation-4128-L.E.0138:

+++ DESCRIPTION: 
[[<]]
Police were surprised to find Franziska ██████[[footnote]] Franziska had gone missing two years prior on her sixteenth birthday in a nearby town. [[/footnote]] sitting outside the local police station. Upon initial questioning, it was discovered that she had been held captive by Daniel ████████. Franziska claimed to have woken in the middle of the night, finding a "strange man" hovering over her. In her recollection of the escape, she remarked how she was chained to the wall of the basement and repeatedly stated how the man used no equipment, but rather his hands, to break her free. 

**RESPONSE:** Class-A amnestics were administered to all individuals involved. A falsified investigation was established as the catalyst of Franziska's rescue, with embedded Foundation personnel acting as correspondents to the report. Daniel ████████ was later taken into custody.

**DATE:** August 31, 1985

**LOCATION:** East Los Angeles, California
----
+++ DESCRIPTION:
[[<]]
Authorities were alerted when a group of residents had successfully apprehended Richard Ramirez, a serial killer and rapist who went under the alias of "The Night Stalker." Upon arrival at Hollenbeck Police Station, Ramirez began ranting about a man with impenetrable skin. Detective George Thomas, a field agent for the Foundation, was present during this display and immediately contacted Mobile Task Force Iota-10 ("Damn Feds"). Upon questioning by Agent Thomas, Ramirez recalled being followed by "a man in a red barn jacket" before fleeing across the Sante Anne Highway. Upon an attempt to carjack a woman, Ramirez noticed the man in close proximity and attempted to stab him with a kitchen knife obtained in an earlier raid. After a short chase, Ramirez was rendered unconscious, where then he awoke, surrounded by other bystanders who had joined the man.        
 

**RESPONSE:** MTF-Iota-10 retrieved the knife before forensics arrived at the scene. A false transcription of the interrogation was released to the public. Due to the high-profile nature of Richard Ramirez, a combination of Class-G and Class-C amnestics were used to ensure that any account of the incident would not leak to the press.

+++ DESCRIPTION: 
[[<]]
Foundation agents intercepted a call from a local reporter regarding the inexplainable placement of a Dodge Aries on the roof of an abandoned factory. Four men were found to be trapped inside the car, visibly distressed; three of the men were armed with 9MM handguns and one with a Remington 870 shotgun. A correlation was established when reports regarding a drive-by shooting on a nearby block came to light.

**RESPONSE:** A videotape of SCP-4128 was confiscated by Foundation personnel. The reporter, who was the sole witness to the L.E. Event, was administered a Class-B amnestic after initial interrogation. The four men were apprehended by Foundation operatives and subsequently incarcerated into D-Class personnel.

**DATE:** April 28, 2000

**LOCATION:**  The Bronx, New York
----
+++ DESCRIPTION: 
[[<]]
46th Precinct Police of Bronx received a call regarding a street fight. When police arrived at the scene, a man was found lying on the pavement unconscious. Upon admittance into NYC ███████ Hospital, X-rays revealed a complete fracturing of the ulnar shaft and a broken jaw. Witnesses identified the man as Jason ███████, a local resident of an apartment complex on Unionport Road, who had been going around the complex with a gun to extort money from other residents.  During one of these extortion raids, a witness reported seeing a man approach Jason, grabbing him by the arm. Jason proceeded to cry out in pain. The emergency call was made shortly after.

**RESPONSE:** Class-A amnestics were administered to convince Jason ███████ of a prolonged engagement. Later court rulings found him guilty on the account of three separate charges. This use of excessive violence was recorded as a notable escalation in an L.E. Event. Recovery of SCP-4128 from here on was deemed a //Vidar//-level priority.

**Addendum 4128-A1:** Genetic markers indicate that myostatin-related hypertrophy[[footnote]]A mutation in the MSTN gene. Affected individuals have up to twice the usual amount of muscle mass in their bodies and tend to have increased muscle strength. [[/footnote]] may be involved. However, this does not fully explain all reports regarding the entity's feats, such as its ability to leap across vast distances. 
> //If he were to have this condition, one would assume that SCP-4128 have immense muscular proportions previously unseen in humanoid anatomy. However, I can find no physical difference between the entity and any other athlete. If we're being completely honest, the guy has a bit of a pudge. 
> -Dr. Andrew Winstabt//

**Addendum 4128-A2:** In a recent checkup, it was discovered that SCP-4128 had gradually been losing hearing in its left ear due to excessive bone growth putting pressure on the cranial nerves. Request for a hearing aid is pending approval. SCP-4128 has reported suffering minor seizures in the past; researchers are required to provide immediate notice to medical staff should another lapse occur. 

**Addendum 4128-B1:** A series of interviews were conducted in order to uncover the origin of SCP-4128's anomalous properties and the motivation behind the entity's activities. The following are transcriptions of the video logs:

> 
> **Dr. Markstrom:** How are you today? Are you feeling any better?
> 
> **SCP-4128:** Oh, yes. I'm doing okay, I suppose. It was a little jarring, having y'all knock me out with that damn gas. (//Pause//) I'm- I'm not going to hurt anyone.
> 
> **Dr. Markstrom:** Security measures have to be taken. It's nothing personal. I just wanted to ask you a couple of questions. Do you understand?
> 
> **SCP-4128:** Yes, I do. 
> 
> **Dr. Markstrom:** Good. Let's get started. When and where were you born?
> 
> **SCP-4128:** ████ █, 1913. I lived on the outskirts of Glenville with my Ma and Pa. In Ohio, that is. 
> 
> **Dr. Markstrom:** 4128, can you tell me why we have no records of you or your family present at that time? 
> 
> **SCP-4128:** Well, Ma and Pa weren't exactly legal.  They also never left the farm much. 
> 
> **Dr. Markstrom:** Interesting. How did you obtain your anomalous properties?
> 
> **SCP-4128:** Obtain? (//Chuckle//) I suppose whenever I was conceived. My parents realized fast. They'd find things broken that shouldn't be. Ma nearly had a heart attack when she saw me pick up the recliner. (//Another chuckle, then silence.//) She was always so patient. She'd broken more than one finger during that time.
> 
> **Dr. Markstrom:** Can you recall the first time you purposely used your abilities on a human being?
> 
> (//No response is given.//)
> 
> **Dr. Markstrom:** I understand why this topic may be difficult to discuss, but the more we uncover, the higher chance we have of finding a way to suppress your abnormal condition. Answer the question, please.
> 
> (//Silence for several more seconds before an audible sigh is given by SCP-4128.//)
> 
> **SCP-4128:** I was nineteen at the time. Whenever we needed new supplies for home, my parents would send me into town. Figured I could take care of myself, believe it or not. Ma needed me to pick up fabrics at a haberdashery, a reputable place ran by a gentleman and his family. He and one of his boys were working that night.

> (//SCP-4128 can be seen looking away from Dr. Robert.//)
> 
> **Dr. Markstrom:** I need you to keep going. What happened?  
> 
> **SCP-4128:** Three men came in. One fella stood perched by the door, real suspicious-like. I noticed one of them start stuffing some shirts into his coat. Everything tends to blur after that. I remember reaching for him when the bruno pulled out a roscoe[[footnote]] Common slang for a gun in the 1930s. [[/footnote]]. The bullet hit and I fell. When I got up, they were gone, the son included. Then I saw the old man lying on the floor.   
> 
> **Dr. Markstrom:** The shoplifter shot him, too? 
> 
> **SCP-4128:** No, they found out later it was a heart attack that took his life.
> 
> **Dr. Markstrom:** I'm assuming you chased after these men?
> 
> **SCP-4128:** Of course. I was... well, it would be gracious to say I did it out of a "sense of justice". Chased after them on foot since the kid took Pa's truck. It was the first time I'd started using my get-away sticks to their potential. Couldn't stop myself correctly, but, hey, I still managed to catch them on the outskirts. 
> 
> (//Pause//)
> 
> I was so careless then.
> 
> **Dr. Markstrom:** Could you please elaborate?
> 
> **SCP-4128:** I didn't even think what would- I picked the tin can up and threw it. The haberdasher's son just parked the truck and watched. 
> 
> **Dr. Markstrom:** Did you dispose of the witness?
> 
> **SCP-4128:** Did I- God, //no//. After seeing... I don't think I'd ever thrown up that much. No, the rest of that night we just talked. It was the most damned thing, I tell ya. He asked questions and I gave //some// answers. He asked me where I came from. Know what I told him? An alien planet! (//Chuckle//) The gullible jelly bean nearly blew a wig.
> 
> **Dr. Markstrom:** You let him free knowing he could identify you?
> 
> **SCP-4128:** Well, he promised he wouldn't tell anyone; a sort of repayment for avenging his father, I suppose. (//Pause//) You know what I've realized? That night was a damn warning. 
> 
> **Dr. Markstrom:** We'll wrap it up for today. 4128? 
> 
> **SCP-4128:** Yes, doc? 
> 
> **Dr. Markstrom:** Did you ever get his name? We'll need to run a background check, just for cautionary measures.
> 
> **SCP-4128:** Jerry was his name. Jerry Siegel.
> 
> **<End Log>**
> ------
> **Closing Statement:** After SCP-4128 was taken back to its cell, a background search was performed on Jerry Siegel. Findings led to his designation as PoI-4128-A.

+++ DESCRIPTION:
[[<]]
Foundation agents were alerted when SCP-4128 had reportedly turned itself in to local authorities. An investigation revealed that SCP-4128 had followed David ████████[[footnote]] A suspected cocaine trafficker. [[/footnote]] to his apartment with the intent to apprehend him. Upon breaking into the apartment, Kyaus ████████, David's fifteen-year-old son, proceeded to sneak up on the entity with a gun. SCP-4128 was reportedly startled and attacked the young man. An autopsy report showed that the chest wall was strongly crushed, and the side wall of his right ventricle was sandwiched between the costal cartilages and seventh thoracic vertebrae before it ruptured. Surgery revealed a large amount of coagulated blood in the pericardium.


**RESPONSE:** Class-A amnestics were administered to all individuals involved. Embedded Foundation agents implemented a cover investigation which framed David ████████ as the murder suspect. David subsequently went to trial in the following month. SCP-4128 was recovered by MTF-Iota-10 without incident.
