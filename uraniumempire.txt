* So this was my first skip. It's alright I guess.
* Fun little story about this baby: back when I was a babby SCP writer, this was originally just a straight up statue, no context. Some helpful soul told me that the concept sounded "B-Movie"ish and the very next day, I got up, thought "fuck you, it IS a B-Movie!", and the rest was history.
[[[SCP-2677]]]
> //Today's the day. Make master proud, won't you?//
* As the years go by, I like this skip less and less. I'm not certain if it's because my writing style has improved over the years or if it's because of the four and a half year gap between this and my next ones, but I do find it slightly ironic that my most acclaimed skip is my least favorite.
* Originally, Anderson Harper was meant to be a super bad guy, but atrophy for lethargy, I suppose. Also, I literally can't remember what this thing's function was anymore, both intention and practical, so go hog wild I guess.

> //Maybe it's the weather. Maybe you're just thirsty. Chill out with a Pepsi.//
* This was originally supposed to be about wasps. I have no fucking clue what inspired me to write this, cause it's been 4 years since I uploaded the first draft to my sandbox. 
[[[SCP-952]]]
> //"Hey, V."//
> //"What could it possibly be this time, Jack?"//
> //"I have this weird idea."//
* One day, while listening to TTNG's //Animals//, I realized that a common thread linked nearly every song of my favorite genre together: the inability for nerds to keep a damn relationship together. It's almost mystifying, turn on the average math rock playlist and it's either instrumentals or breakup songs.
[[[SCP-3472]]]
> //In my dreams, we're all smiling.//
* I feel like, whenever I'm writing parents, the most common archetype that comes up is the nervous wreck who loves their child, but isn't all that //there// for them, emotionally. I have to wonder why I write like this.
