[[[SCP-1285]]]
> //"Audiences are gonna hate this, you know."//
> //"If I cared for the opinion of every slavering wastrel, I'd be a critic, not a cinematographer."//
* So this was my first skip. It's alright I guess.
* Fun little story about this baby: back when I was a babby SCP writer, this was originally just a straight up statue, no context. Some helpful soul told me that the concept sounded "B-Movie"ish and the very next day, I got up, thought "fuck you, it IS a B-Movie!", and the rest was history.
[[[SCP-2677]]]
> //Today's the day. Make master proud, won't you?//
* As the years go by, I like this skip less and less. I'm not certain if it's because my writing style has improved over the years or if it's because of the four and a half year gap between this and my next ones, but I do find it slightly ironic that my most acclaimed skip is my least favorite.
* Originally, Anderson Harper was meant to be a super bad guy, but atrophy for lethargy, I suppose. Also, I literally can't remember what this thing's function was anymore, both intention and practical, so go hog wild I guess.
[[[SCP-3428]]]
> //Maybe it's the weather. Maybe you're just thirsty. Chill out with a Pepsi.//
* This was originally supposed to be about wasps. I have no fucking clue what inspired me to write this, cause it's been 4 years since I uploaded the first draft to my sandbox. 
[[[SCP-952]]]
> //"Hey, V."//
> //"What could it possibly be this time, Jack?"//
> //"I have this weird idea."//
* One day, while listening to TTNG's //Animals//, I realized that a common thread linked nearly every song of my favorite genre together: the inability for nerds to keep a damn relationship together. It's almost mystifying, turn on the average math rock playlist and it's either instrumentals or breakup songs.
[[[SCP-3472]]]
> //In my dreams, we're all smiling.//
* I feel like, whenever I'm writing parents, the most common archetype that comes up is the nervous wreck who loves their child, but isn't all that //there// for them, emotionally. I have to wonder why I write like this.
* Most of the skip was written in 2013-2014. The letter is the only real part made near when I posted this.
[[[surprise-happy-birthday-7|Corner of the Game Room]]]
* This one's about as true as The Things they Carried is. The feelings are real, however.
[[[SCP-4747]]]
> //Step 6: Mix the jelly into the shavings, all the while declaring your love for one another.//
* I refuse to comment on this any more than "I wrote this in an hour and a half concept to posting."
[[[SCP-4947]]]
> //"Do 222232244629420445529739893461909967206666939096499764990979600 people even exist?"//
> //"Yes, the fuck are you on about? Keep scrolling."//
* So it turns out there //wasn't// a skip called "you have died of dysentery", and now there is.
* Keep an eye on this one ;o

[[tab Author Living Will]]
* Merchandising: Pretty much everything I've written can be merchandised for sale, as long as I'm given attribution. The exception is SCP-952, which due to its, er, rather personal inception, I'd prefer no money is made off of.
* Reclaiming Authorship: [[*user ProcyonLotor]] has my phone number.
* Post"mortem" ownership: In the event that I leave the site, remain inactive for five years, or die, the following articles belong to the following people:
 * [[[SCP-1285]]]: Roget. I dunno, I trust him.
 * [[[SCP-2677]]]: FFB. She writes good sci-fi.
 * [[[SCP-3428]]]: djkaktus. I feel like it's a good fit.
 * [[[SCP-952]]]: If the lead singer of Wayne Szalinski (Andy Milad) has a wikidot account, he owns this. Otherwise, Dexanote. Sorry for stealing a 900s rewrite slot out from under you. Again.
 * [[[SCP-3472]]]: Zyn, as they served as a partial inspiration.
 * [[[SCP-4747]]]: Just throw it in the trash
 * [[[SCP-4947]]]: Delete it and replace it with a spiritual rewrite of 947classic.
* **IMPORTANT:** In the event that staff allow a malicious downvote brigade to remove an article from the site, all my work is to be sent to me as raw text, then deleted from the site. I will //not// see my fellow authors crushed by offsite wastrels and trolls.

[[tab Advice and Appropriate Music]]
**[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5oGmj3uMg Live according to your principles, and find meaning in the universe.]** Whether this means devoting yourself to whatever deity you fancy, or partying until you fucking drop, do what //you// need to do. You're human (probably), and you're free to find whatever meaning you want in a meaningless universe. After all, we're all specks of dust on the ass of the cosmos; you don't have to be anyone but the person you choose to be.

**[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVQeL9LWVAY Altruism feels good.]** Seriously, there's nothing more satisfying than brightening someone else's day up.
