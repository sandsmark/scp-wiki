[[collapsible show="Veronica Fitzroy" hide="I am a Monster and I made it so."]]
**Appears in:** All pages tagged with {{veronica-fitzroy}}
**Summary:** Veronica's a drummer, audio/hardware engineer, and serial felon from Staten Island. She created [[[SCP-952]]], resulting in the death of bandmate Sara Yarkoni, a botched suicide that lead to a dead cop, and her enrollment into the D-Class program.
**How does she take her coffee:** Black, brewed in the garage coffee machine during a long work project.
**How does she swear?:** Quite a bit. She'll occasionally use the K/T slurs to describe herself.
[[/collapsible]]

**Appears in:** [[[SCP-4947]]], [[[SCP-3753]]], [[[If You Are Reading This]]], [[[SCP-978]]] extended test logs
**Summary:** Rivka is a nurse-turned-physician working for the Foundation; Yehezkel is a former professor of architecture employed several years later. Both emigrated from Iran after Yehezkel's conversion from Islam to Judaism. Following the suicide of her daughter, Rivka was assigned to SCP-4947 as head researcher. The stress of this position resulted in her developing early-onset dementia, and Yehezkel was assigned to the project in her stead.
**How do they take their coffee:** Rivka drinks chamomile, and developed a caffeine addictions in the days following her 4947 assignment. Yehezkel doesn't drink.

**How do they swear?:** Only when stressed.
[[/collapsible]]
[[collapsible show="Sara Yarkoni" hide="Dancing on wires/Both ends are on Fire..."]]

**Summary:** Sara is a freelance programmer, webcam model, and musician from Staten Island. Born to Rivka and Yehezkel, much of her life was defined by a need to earn their approval (they worked incredibly long hours); that fell apart after her arson-assisted expulsion from Yale and subsequent 6-month institutionalization.
**How do they take their coffee:** Shot of vanilla cream and espresso.
**How do they swear?:** Minor swears often, major swears sometimes.

[[tab Research Work]]
[[[SCP-1285]]]
> //"Audiences are gonna hate this, you know."//
> //"If I cared for the opinion of every slavering wastrel, I'd be a critic, not a cinematographer."//
* So this was my first skip. It's alright I guess.
* Fun little story about this baby: back when I was a babby SCP writer, this was originally just a straight up statue, no context. Some helpful soul told me that the concept sounded "B-Movie"ish and the very next day, I got up, thought "fuck you, it IS a B-Movie!", and the rest was history.
* I've been trying to move away from notes at the end. However, this was made before NatE was a cliche, so neener.
[[[SCP-2677]]]
> //Today's the day. Make master proud, won't you?//
* As the years go by, I like this skip less and less. I'm not certain if it's because my writing style has improved over the years or if it's because of the four and a half year gap between this and my next ones, but I do find it slightly ironic that my most acclaimed skip is my least favorite.
* Originally, Anderson Harper was meant to be a super bad guy, but atrophy for lethargy, I suppose. Also, I literally can't remember what this thing's function was anymore, both intention and practical, so go hog wild I guess.
[[[SCP-3428]]]
> //Maybe it's the weather. Maybe you're just thirsty. Chill out with a Pepsi.//
* This was originally supposed to be about wasps. I have no fucking clue what inspired me to write this, cause it's been 4 years since I uploaded the first draft to my sandbox. 
[[[SCP-952]]]
> //"Hey, V."//
> //"What could it possibly be this time, Jack?"//
> //"I have this weird idea."//
* One day, while listening to TTNG's //Animals//, I realized that a common thread linked nearly every song of my favorite genre together: the inability for nerds to keep a damn relationship together. It's almost mystifying, turn on the average math rock playlist and it's either instrumentals or breakup songs.
[[[SCP-3472]]]
> //In my dreams, we're all smiling.//
* I feel like, whenever I'm writing parents, the most common archetype that comes up is the nervous wreck who loves their child, but isn't all that //there// for them, emotionally. I have to wonder why I write like this.
* Most of the skip was written in 2013-2014. The letter is the only real part made near when I posted this.
* I'll ##blue|rewrite## this one day.
[[[surprise-happy-birthday-7|Corner of the Game Room]]]
* This one's about as true as The Things they Carried is. The feelings are real, however.
[[[SCP-4747]]]
> //Step 6: Mix the jelly into the shavings, all the while declaring your love for one another.//
* I refuse to comment on this any more than "I wrote this in an hour and a half concept to posting."
[[[SCP-4946]]]
> //"Do 222232244629420445529739893461909967206666939096499764990979600 people even exist?"//
> //"Yes, the fuck are you on about? Keep scrolling."//
* So it turns out there //wasn't// a skip called "you have died of dysentery", and now there is.
* This was originally 4947. That disappeared into a hole.
[[[SCP-4947]]]
> //Direct order from O5-11, images to attach to the file, new exploration authorization. Christ, you'd think we'd back these things up.//
* This is my first horror SCP, I think. 1285 veered too far into black comedy, 2677 was more of a character piece, and the closest 952 got to horror was showing how far a human would go to hurt another human. This one, though, gets back to my roots.
* Fun fact: Yehezkel and Rivka are the parents of Sara. I kinda feel bad for how horrible I've been to this family tree.
* --This is my best work, I think.--
[[[SCP-3721]]]
> //You think translating is hard? Try reading what they say.//
* Eskobar briefly talked about [[[SCP-2845]]] on Kaktuskast, using it as an example of when an author "stops fucking around". I think 3721 is that moment for me.
* The original iteration of this draft was far less focused on the aspect of decay; it was Hippo's suggestion that they forget their own names that cemented the direction I wanted to take.
* There have been three times where, in the process of writing, I became so disgusted by something I've written that I had to dial it back. The third transcript was one of them.
[[[SCP-4690]]]
* My process for conceptualization went as follows:
 * Huh, Japanese architecture is really cool.
 * But orientalism sucks!
 * What if there was a metaphysical cancer made of a mishmash of random architecture taken from a smattering of East-Asian countries, with no attention to detail? Just the pure horrors of orientalism.
 * It's actually a web created by hyperdimensional spiders.
 * But why are the spiders in our world?
 * They're here to eat orientalists.
 * Pinkerton is a very good album about an orientalist.
 * Madame Butterfly is my new special interest, oops
 * What if anti-orientalist hyperdimensional spiders ate Lieutenant Pinkerton?
* This article is an abject failure, because nothing will ever be funnier than the actual existence of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_m%C3%A9nage_moderne_de_Madame_Butterfly a 1920 Madame Butterfly porn parody where the director plays a peeping tom who's made the main character's bitch]. Jewish bisexuals stay winning.
* I refuse to explain why or how Weezer is Fifthist, and will never expand upon it.
--The OCT Trilogy (Survival Guide, Last Things, Baptism)-- [[[wwydftltimd-hub|When Will You Die for the Last Time in My Dreams]]]
> //Hell is whatever you think it will be, and you deserve it as much as you believe you do.//
* If Technician Empira is my author self-insert, Veronica is her shadow: the sum of my insecurities, boiled down into one miserable character. I suppose that makes her my self-insert as well, even if Veronica and I diverged somewhere down the line. As a result, writing her is an intensely personal experience for me.
* By the time I started the second chapter, I had gotten back on my ADHD meds and started religiously listening to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. You can probably tell how that affected the work.
* I feel like a big theme of the HoS saga is how we deal with trauma and the mistakes of the past. --I'll probably continue Veronica's story, one day, along with those of her bandmates.-- Nix the probably, I deliver.
* There have been three times where, in the process of writing, I became so disgusted by something I've written that I had to dial it back. The Bandages scene from Survival Guide was one of them.
[[[SCP-0166|SCP-166]]]
* I don't remember who suggested I put a 0 in the url, but I think it was either Kirby or Dolphin.
* The most common criticism I've seen of this piece is that it changes a docile, not-//too//-deadly skip into an edgy keterblack. To that I say: "Yes, I did. Why is that supposed to be the problem?"
* The //second// most common criticism I've seen is that I rewrote Clef out of the story. To that I ask: "How do you think Nobody obtained Clef's credentials?"
* The bitterest irony of this story is that it can never //actually// replace its mainlisted counterpart, because it relies too much on its existence to stand on very many legs. Far from replacing 166, I have added onto its justifications.
[[[are-we-gentrified-yet|Are We Gentrified Yet?]]]
* Nico tells me he wrote the project proposal as a joke, with little intention to actually submit it to the wiki. To this day, I wonder whose neck this albatross hangs heavier on.
* I hadn't read [[[SCP-4485]]] until a little after AWGY's publication. As far as I was aware, Hansarp was nothing more than a Mekhanite weirdo.
[[[SCP-4886]]]
> //The lead biologist isn't supposed to make mistakes, but deep down, I always hoped I was wrong. Just not// this //wrong.//
* This skip is intended to be read more than once. In fact, if you haven't read it at least twice, don't read the commentary further.
* One thing that fascinated me about [[[SCP-2254]]] was the implication that La Hire, the rapist by proxy responsible for a generation of animal serial killers, was //terrified// of his brothers. After I poached Spades from Bright (and subsequently overhauled him into a neurotic, guilt-ridden child of the Scarlet King), I knew I'd be touching up on his brothers.
* This piece is the capstone of everything I learned from writing for the site. Incorporated is 3721's prose timing, WWYFTLTIMD's dialogue crash course, Nadox and the Mekhanite's character work, 4947's atmospheric tone, 4495's clinical disgust, and SCP-0166's weaponization of the SCP format. It is, almost certainly, my best SCP work.
* If you didn't pick up on it: 4886 wasn't lying about [[[SCP-4947|his father]]], and URA-4886 appears in an [[[SCP-952|earlier skip]]]
[[[The Trashfire]]]
> __WELCOME TO HELL__
* This canon exists for the sake of reader convenience, linking my and others' works together into a (hopefully) easier to understand bundle.
* If you can't tell, I dislike a vast majority of what many readers consider "canon", but most of all, I dislike the mangled Jewish mythology SCPs like Gate Guardian. Creating a space away from such things is pleasing to me.
[[[SCP-5444]]]
> //When I die, I want my autobiography encrypted.//
* I was inspired by an episode of Forensic Files, where a man pretended to be the man he murdered, sending mail and paying bills as appropriate, but 5444 was already conceptualized by the time I saw that episode so the Parawatch I had in mind was scrapped.
* Sara's experiences are at least partially autobiographical; not to the point of 1:1 connections, but enough to understand how these things may have gone down.
* You //know// a skip is good when three separate people ask if you're alright after reading it.
[[[Filled to the Brim with Girlish Glee]]]
> //##deeppink|KeeLee:## But I care about you, even when you won't care about me.//
* This is a rewrite of a piece by DrChandra and DianaBerry. The original featured Lolly from Dread & Circuses trying to reason with the girls of JGT re: their transphobia, and arguably cemented JGT as the "TERF GoI". In my opinion, its biggest problem was too much tell re: why transphobia is bad; my job was to chop it all up and //show// the sheer horrors of "traditional femininity". I, uh, succeeded, according to the comments.
* This piece did not originally come with an on-page warning, which I dislike including wholesale onto a page unless absolutely necessary. As it turns out, my decision to have such warnings languish in this tabview resulted in triggering someone's PTSD; not including the warning after such would be tantamount to dangerous negligence.
* I set out to make this piece horrifying from the perspective of software developers and trans people; I didn't expect the horror to produce such visceral reactions, and to this day I'm a little frightened of the implications that I could just //write// such a thing.
* PINK FLY has cameo'd in [[[degenerate-art|another tale]]].
[[/tab]]
[[tab What I've Learned From Writing]]
[[[SCP-1285]]]
* Do not be afraid to go weird.
* Behind every criticism is a suggestion for what to do better.
[[[SCP-2677]]]
* Extraneous logs will cripple a piece. Only say what you need to.
[[[SCP-3428]]]
* Comedy must be built up from.
[[[SCP-952]]]
* Everyone loves a good character.
* The worst human villains are still human at the end of the day. If you can understand why someone did something, part of you will unconsciously empathize.
[[[SCP-4947]]]
* Gimmicks can only go so far, even if they're necessary to explore the themes of a piece. Try not to rely on a given gimmick too hard.
[[[SCP-3721]]]
* Prose can be timed for maximum effect, most especially when writing horror (and, by extension, comedy).
[[[SCP-4690]]]
* All comedy pieces have a punchline, but //great// comedy pieces realize that build-up isn't linear. Peppering your piece with brief jokes can strengthen the piece immensely.

**[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5oGmj3uMg Live according to your principles, and find meaning in the universe.]** Whether this means devoting yourself to whatever deity you fancy, or partying until you fucking drop, do what //you// need to do. You're human (probably), and you're free to find whatever meaning you want in a meaningless universe. After all, we're all specks of dust on the ass of the cosmos; you don't have to be anyone but the person you choose to be.
