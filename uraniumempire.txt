 * So this was my first skip. It's alright I guess.
 * Fun little story about this baby: back when I was a babby SCP writer, this was originally just a straight up statue, no context. Some helpful soul told me that the concept sounded "B-Movie"ish and the very next day, I got up, thought "fuck you, it IS a B-Movie!", and the rest was history.

 * As the years go by, I like this skip less and less. I'm not certain if it's because my writing style has improved over the years or if it's because of the four and a half year gap between this and my next ones, but I do find it slightly ironic that my most acclaimed skip is my least favorite.
 * Originally, Anderson Harper was meant to be a super bad guy, but atrophy for lethargy, I suppose. Also, I literally can't remember what this thing's function was anymore, both intention and practical, so go hog wild I guess.
