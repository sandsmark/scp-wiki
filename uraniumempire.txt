[[tab Characters]]
hi these are my characters.

Feel free to use them in your story, however you want! Main character, antagonist, comic relief, poorly written sex scene, background cameo, whatever!

[[collapsible show="Veronica Fitzroy" hide="I am a Monster and I made it so."]]
**Appears in:** All pages tagged with {{veronica-fitzroy}}
**Summary:** Veronica's a drummer, audio/hardware engineer, and serial felon from Staten Island. She created [[[SCP-952]]], resulting in the death of bandmate Sara Yarkoni, a botched suicide that lead to a dead cop, and her enrollment into the D-Class program.
**How does she take her coffee:** Black, brewed in the garage coffee machine during a long work project.
**How does she swear?:** Quite a bit. She'll occasionally use the K/T slurs to describe herself.
[[/collapsible]]
[[collapsible show="Dr. Rivka Yarkoni and Researcher Yehezkel Yarkoni" hide="Save me from the Villains of Circumstance..."]]
**Appears in:** [[[SCP-4947]]], [[[SCP-3753]]], [[[If You Are Reading This]]], [[[SCP-978]]] extended test logs
**Summary:** Rivka is a nurse-turned-physician working for the Foundation; Yehezkel is a former professor of architecture employed several years later. Following the suicide of her daughter, Rivka was assigned to SCP-4947 as head researcher. The stress of this position resulted in her developing early-onset dementia, and Yehezkel was assigned to the project in her stead.
**How do they take their coffee:** Rivka drinks chamomile, and developed a caffeine addictions in the days following her 4947 assignment. Yehezkel doesn't drink.
**How do they swear?:** Rivka does not say fuck!! Yehezkel very rarely does.

**How do they take their coffee:** She doesn't drink coffee, preferring spiced teas.
**How do they swear?:** Only when stressed.

[[tab Research Work]]
[[[SCP-1285]]]
> //"Audiences are gonna hate this, you know."//
> //"If I cared for the opinion of every slavering wastrel, I'd be a critic, not a cinematographer."//
* So this was my first skip. It's alright I guess.
* Fun little story about this baby: back when I was a babby SCP writer, this was originally just a straight up statue, no context. Some helpful soul told me that the concept sounded "B-Movie"ish and the very next day, I got up, thought "fuck you, it IS a B-Movie!", and the rest was history.
* I've been trying to move away from notes at the end. However, this was made before NatE was a cliche, so neener.
[[[SCP-2677]]]
> //Today's the day. Make master proud, won't you?//
* As the years go by, I like this skip less and less. I'm not certain if it's because my writing style has improved over the years or if it's because of the four and a half year gap between this and my next ones, but I do find it slightly ironic that my most acclaimed skip is my least favorite.
* Originally, Anderson Harper was meant to be a super bad guy, but atrophy for lethargy, I suppose. Also, I literally can't remember what this thing's function was anymore, both intention and practical, so go hog wild I guess.
[[[SCP-3428]]]
> //Maybe it's the weather. Maybe you're just thirsty. Chill out with a Pepsi.//
* This was originally supposed to be about wasps. I have no fucking clue what inspired me to write this, cause it's been 4 years since I uploaded the first draft to my sandbox. 
[[[SCP-952]]]
> //"Hey, V."//
> //"What could it possibly be this time, Jack?"//
> //"I have this weird idea."//
* One day, while listening to TTNG's //Animals//, I realized that a common thread linked nearly every song of my favorite genre together: the inability for nerds to keep a damn relationship together. It's almost mystifying, turn on the average math rock playlist and it's either instrumentals or breakup songs.
[[[SCP-3472]]]
> //In my dreams, we're all smiling.//
* I feel like, whenever I'm writing parents, the most common archetype that comes up is the nervous wreck who loves their child, but isn't all that //there// for them, emotionally. I have to wonder why I write like this.
* Most of the skip was written in 2013-2014. The letter is the only real part made near when I posted this.
* I'll ##blue|rewrite## this one day.
[[[surprise-happy-birthday-7|Corner of the Game Room]]]
* This one's about as true as The Things they Carried is. The feelings are real, however.
[[[SCP-4747]]]
> //Step 6: Mix the jelly into the shavings, all the while declaring your love for one another.//
* I refuse to comment on this any more than "I wrote this in an hour and a half concept to posting."
[[[SCP-4946]]]
> //"Do 222232244629420445529739893461909967206666939096499764990979600 people even exist?"//
> //"Yes, the fuck are you on about? Keep scrolling."//
* So it turns out there //wasn't// a skip called "you have died of dysentery", and now there is.
* This was originally 4947. That disappeared into a hole.
[[[SCP-4947]]]
> //Direct order from O5-11, images to attach to the file, new exploration authorization. Christ, you'd think we'd back these things up.//
* This is my first horror SCP, I think. 1285 veered too far into black comedy, 2677 was more of a character piece, and the closest 952 got to horror was showing how far a human would go to hurt another human. This one, though, gets back to my roots.
* Fun fact: Yehezkel and Rivka are the parents of Sara. I kinda feel bad for how horrible I've been to this family tree.
* --This is my best work, I think.--
[[[SCP-3721]]]
> //You think translating is hard? Try reading what they say.//
* Eskobar briefly talked about [[[SCP-2845]]] on Kaktuskast, using it as an example of when an author "stops fucking around". I think 3721 is that moment for me.
The OCT Trilogy (Survival Guide, Last Things, Baptism)
> //Hell is whatever you think it will be, and you deserve it as much as you believe you do.//
* If Technician Empira is my author self-insert, Veronica is her shadow: the sum of my insecurities, boiled down into one miserable character. I suppose that makes her my self-insert as well, even if Veronica and I diverged somewhere down the line. As a result, writing her is an intensely personal experience for me.
* By the time I started the second chapter, I had gotten back on my ADHD meds and started religiously listening to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. You can probably tell how that affected the work.
* I feel like a big theme of the HoS saga is how we deal with trauma and the mistakes of the past. I'll probably continue Veronica's story, one day, along with those of her bandmates.
[[[SCP-4886]]]
> //The lead biologist isn't supposed to make mistakes, but deep down, I always hoped I was wrong. Just not// this //wrong.//
* This skip is intended to be read more than once. In fact, if you haven't read it at least twice, don't read the commentary further.
* One thing that fascinated me about [[[SCP-2254]]] was the implication that La Hire, the rapist by proxy responsible for a generation of animal serial killers, was //terrified// of his brothers. After I poached Spades from Bright (and subsequently overhauled him into a neurotic, guilt-ridden child of the Scarlet King), I knew I'd be touching up on his brothers.
* This piece is the capstone of everything I learned from writing for the site. Incorporated is 3721's prose timing, WWYFTLTIMD's dialogue crash course, Nadox and the Mekhanite's character work, 4947's atmospheric tone, 4495's clinical disgust, and SCP-0166's weaponization of the SCP format. It is, almost certainly, my best SCP work.
* If you didn't pick up on it: 4886 wasn't lying about [[[SCP-4947|his father]]].

[[tab What I've Learned From Writing]]
[[[SCP-1285]]]
* Do not be afraid to go weird.
* Behind every criticism is a suggestion for what to do better.
[[[SCP-2677]]]
* Extraneous logs will cripple a piece. Only say what you need to.
[[[SCP-3428]]]
* Comedy must be built up from.
[[[SCP-952]]]
* Everyone loves a good character.
* The worst human villains are still human at the end of the day. If you can understand why someone did something, part of you will unconsciously empathize.
[[[SCP-4947]]]
* Gimmicks can only go so far, even if they're necessary to explore the themes of a piece. Try not to rely on a given gimmick too hard.
[[[SCP-3721]]]
* Prose can be timed for maximum effect, most especially when writing horror (and, by extension, comedy).
[[[SCP-4690]]]
* All comedy pieces have a punchline, but //great// comedy pieces realize that build-up isn't linear. Peppering your piece with brief jokes can strengthen the piece immensely.

[[tab Author Living Will]]
* Merchandising: Pretty much everything I've written can be merchandised for sale, as long as I'm given attribution.
* Reclaiming Authorship: [[*user ProcyonLotor]] and [[*user Uncle Nicolini]] have my phone number.
* Post"mortem" ownership: In the event that I leave the site, remain inactive for five years, or die, all of my non-collab articles shall be transferred to [[*user The Great Hippo]]'s ownership. Collaborations are to be transferred in full to their respective coauthors.
* --**IMPORTANT:** In the event that staff allow a malicious downvote brigade to remove an article from the site, all my work is to be sent to me as raw text, then deleted from the site. I will //not// see my fellow authors crushed by offsite wastrels and trolls.-- With the creation of [[[The Trashfire]]], this is no longer a request I feel comfortable making.

[[tab Advice and Appropriate Music]]
**[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5oGmj3uMg Live according to your principles, and find meaning in the universe.]** Whether this means devoting yourself to whatever deity you fancy, or partying until you fucking drop, do what //you// need to do. You're human (probably), and you're free to find whatever meaning you want in a meaningless universe. After all, we're all specks of dust on the ass of the cosmos; you don't have to be anyone but the person you choose to be.

**[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVQeL9LWVAY Altruism feels good.]** Seriously, there's nothing more satisfying than brightening someone else's day up.
