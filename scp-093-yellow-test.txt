**Mirror Test 4: Color (Yellow)**

D-class subjects no longer authorized for testing. After analyzing the articles brought back from the previous three tests, testing focus has been shifted to data collection. This is chosen to both better understand the fate of the world accessed by SCP-093, and to determine if safeguards or practices are required for our own world. Analysis of the brown fluid on the clothing of the lost escort team member █████ has been filed with other recovered articles.

Dr. █████ has volunteered for this test, as out of the possible candidates he was the only one able to cause SCP-093 to undergo a new color change. There is no evidence in Dr. █████'s background of any illegal or criminal behavior, nor of any psychological problems. When presented to the mirror, the view changed to that of a cubicle office environment.

For this test Dr. █████ opted to use the wireless video system and forgo the pulley return system, stating he was confident he would be safe as none of the torso-creatures have been witnessed within a a similar office building in previous tests. Video feed commences after Dr. █████ has crossed the mirror. As with prior tests, SCP-093's current color, yellow, tinges all video material.

> Camera flickers to life and pans across a series of plain white cubicle constructs. Approximately 30 are visible. At the far end from the point of entry is what appears to be an office module. It is built into the wall with frosted glass walls and a glass door. Dr. █████ approaches this door and investigates the writing etched into it: 'Senior Manager - Stanlee Milamitz'. The door is unlocked.
> 
> Dr. █████ enters the office and examines the desk. A coffee cup is on the desk, with a dark brown stain covering the lower half of its inside. Theories suggest the  liquid was left in the cup until it evaporated. There is a donut on a plate, which Dr. █████ picks up and lobs at a wall. On impact with the wall, it thumps loudly and falls. The donut remains intact. A file cabinet in the corner of the room draws Dr. █████'s attention. He goes through the first drawer and closes it. After he opens the second drawer, he stops and reaches in take out a file. He re-opens the first and takes out two other files. Four additional files are pulled from the third and fourth drawers. Dr. █████  spreads them all out on the desk. The files he's pulled are in blue filing folders, and are all marked, as he points out with his finger and the camera, with the symbol of praying hands. He states aloud that all other files are stored in yellow folders, though the camera and Control record no color difference between folders. The removed folders are placed in his field kit.
> 
> Camera attention is then turned to the PC on the desk that is logged in and functional. Dr. █████ wonders aloud at how the devices are getting their power, as he has noticed no power outlets. This PC's desktop contains the Faithful OS logo. Using the device reveals that sounds are built-in with actions of the system. Clicks of the mouse are accompanied by soft hums, described by Dr. █████ as being "hymn-like", and the launching of programs are followed by bells, similarly described as "angelic". The PC fails to yield any useful information to Dr. █████, and he leaves the office.
> 
> Dr. █████ approaches the other end of the office floor, where he presses a button on the wall for the elevator. He enters, with floor 34 being displayed as the present floor. The building's keypad layout goes from -115 to 115, and includes all floors. Before pressing a floor button, Dr. █████ requests that the wireless video transponder be moved to the elevator, and replaced with a construction cone to mark the entry point. A second transponder unit is placed outside the elevator. He instructs Control to recover the second unit and seal the test chamber, should something happen to him. When Control responds to agree, he presses the button for floor -115.
> 
> The descent down the elevator is 15 minutes in total. During this time, the camera experiences one malfunction, where the image jerks and turns to static. Visual is restored immediately, but now shows 14 other figures in the elevator with Dr. █████. As video pans around, all figures move as he moves to allow him space. They remain for 35 seconds. The camera flickers to snow and returns. Dr. █████ is now alone in the elevator, and the video feed ducks and sways rhythmically, as if he is performing a dance. 
> 
> Dr. █████ pauses to comment on a rising stench coming from below. At this point the elevator has reached floor -108. Dr. █████ presses -110 to interrupt the descent down, and exits when that floor is reached. The elevator doors open to a room with several PCs and chairs. All PCs appear to have power. The ceiling to this deck is glass, and above it another deck is visible. These decks overlook a floor below. Dr. █████ approaches the monitoring stations and checks one of the PC screens.
> 
> On the screen is the Faithful OS logo and a video feed with four different views. The first view is a room of tubes -- similar to those found in test Violet -- which number in the thousands. The second view glides in front of each of these tubes, as if to monitor the contents. All tubes the camera passes by are broken. The third view is in a different direction, as a camera glides vertically checking each observation station. A total of 10 can be counted, and Dr. █████ is visible as the camera passes by his own station. Looking up, a hovering camera unit with no visible means of propulsion glides up past him. The fourth view shows the ground floor below the observation deck, where a single astonishingly large torso being is pacing, bumping into walls and changing directions. From the camera feed, the creature's estimated size is six stories.
> 
> Dr. █████ returns his attention to the PC. He moves the video log aside with the mouse, and a document in a simple text editor is hidden behind it. After a small struggle with the controls, Dr. █████  manages to print the document. A printout is filed in the Field Kit. The printout directs the reader to unlock a safe on floor 54, with the combination included. Dr. █████ leaves the observation deck, enters the elevator and proceeds to floor 54 in 15 minutes without event. He proceeds through the cubicled office floor, reaching the desk mentioned in the document. He finds the undisturbed safe hidden beneath a desk. The combination provided in the printout opens the safe and reveals two items: a notebook, filed in the Field Kit, and a peculiar revolver that has been returned as ███-███, with 24 rounds of ammo found with it.
> 
> Dr. █████ proceeds back to the elevator without event and returns to 34. Given the overwhelming number of floors available to explore, and given the vital information obtained from the observation deck, the test is considered over. Equipment is retrieved. Before returning through the entry point, Dr. █████ investigates a terminal nearby that has power, and finds it shows the exact same screen the one on -110 shows. It is theorized that the author of the note installed a network virus to propagate it through the building so any PC on that network would be found and the information discovered.
> 
> Dr. █████ returns through the entry point and the mirror returns to a reflective surface. All materials filed with other SCP-093 recovered materials. Analysis of ███-███ and the ammunition for it postponed, as it would require deconstruction of one of the rounds and they may be beneficial until testing of SCP-093 is resolved. Video ends.
