FMDev is a tired Canadian writer who's here for a good tiiiime........ 
As of now they've written the holy 3 pieces of work, outlined below (with the help of some code they don't know how to work with due to having a room temperature IQ and are too afraid to touch):

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3823 SCP-3823] - "Put on your Red Shoes"

Inspired by some shoes I saw while walking down the street (that's the picture i took it myself with my iphone)
Apparently that's actually supposed to be a drug dealing or gang thing? Could've fooled me.
This SCP is a load of SHIT right now. I need to rewrite it someday and get a better picture unless the shoes are gone in which case FUCK. Watch this space.

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4141 SCP-4141] - "You: The Real Time Autobiography"

Inspired by a post from /v/ in the holiest of SCP threads from early 2018. Thanks, guy from /v/, it's a very good idea.
Sadly my writing for it is DRY AND GARBAGE and not deserving of the EPIC SOUGHT-AFTER REPEATING DIGITS SPOT. I need to fix it up. I use the word "instance" too much. Gotta make the ending better too. Watch this space too, because you're gonna have an existential crisis once this shit is done.

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3871 SCP-3871] - "Dr. Wondertainment's Allegorical Anomaly-Annihilating Assault Automaton"

Clichecon was fun. I wrote about an angry robot.
Critics raved for "Dr. Wondertainment's Allegorical Anomaly-Annihilating Assault Automaton." They loved "Dr. Wondertainment's Allegorical Anomaly-Annihilating Assault Automaton." 
> Wow, Dr. Wondertainment's Allegorical Anomaly-Annihilating Assault Automaton really is a good SCP!
said some guy, probably.
I heard some guy on a podcast call it good. It's the only SCP I've got up that I like as of right now. Don't watch this space cause this one is DONE. (probably? never say never.)[[/collapsible]]
