**Item #:** SCP-841

**Object Class:** Safe

**Containment Procedures:** SCP-841 is to be contained in a storage locker protected by a standard keypad lock in Site-19.  Contact Dr. Randall for access code.  No extraordinary containment procedures are required.  Note that SCP-841 should never be transported or manipulated by hand; the set of surgical tongs located in the container can be used to safely lift and place SCP-841.  A medical team should be placed on standby during transport or testing in case of accidental activation.

**Description:** SCP-841 is a crude wooden puppet constructed from Mountain White Birchwood and cotton twine.  Fourteen total sticks of peeled but otherwise unworked wood are bound together at the major joints - head, torso, upper arms, lower arms, hands, thighs, lower legs, and feet.  The longest piece (torso) measures 10.8 cm in length and the shortest (left hand) measures 1.9 cm.  The twine has uneven signs of wear on different joints, suggesting that the figure has been damaged and repaired at least once.  SCP-841 cannot be transported in hand without activation, even while wearing laboratory gloves.  SCP-841 can, however, be carried safely inside a container or box, grasped in tongs, or wrapped in a cloth or towel.  SCP-841 shows no reaction to non-humans.

Upon being grasped or manipulated by a human, SCP-841 bends into a configuration to mirror its handler as closely as possible within one (1) second.  SCP-841 and the subject will mirror each other's movement, and any force applied to the figure while active will override the subject's own joints to continue mimicking SCP-841.  The resulting feedback may result in serious injuries or death due to overextension or broken bones.  The effect of SCP-841 diminishes quickly upon release, fading entirely in within two seconds.

**Test Logs**

**Test Log A :: Doctor Randall presiding, preliminary testing of object capability**
**T-841-A1:**  Seated Class-D subject instructed to pick up SCP-841 from table and lift the figure’s left leg.  Upon being grasped by the subject, SCP-841 bent its legs into a seating position.  The subject dropped SCP-841 on the table in shock, the impact of which splayed out the figure’s arms and legs.  Subject fell out of the testing chair as the fading effect of SCP-841 caused his arms and legs to jerk.

**T-841-A2:**  Subject given the same instructions as test one.   While raising and lowering the figure’s left leg, the subject’s own left leg mirrored the actions precisely.  Subject described an uncomfortable pressure on his knee and hip joints.  Subject refused instructions to push the figure’s head backwards, and was induced to do so with electric shocks to cause involuntary hand movement.  Subject pronounced dead of neck trauma at T+20 minutes.

**T-841-A3**  Subject instructed to lift SCP-841’s left arm above its head.  The movement of the figure’s arm cause the subject to further raise his arm, which further raised the figure’s arm, &c. &c.  Subject’s arm was separated from his body at the shoulder due to extreme acceleration and overextension.  Subject expired of blood loss and shock at T+3 minutes.

**T-841-A4:**  Subject instructed to throw SCP-841 to the floor.  Subject suffered a shattered right kneecap and left elbow due to extreme hyperextension, an open compound vertebral fracture, two shattered ankles, and a partially severed right leg.  Autopsy revealed that the leg had been rotated more that 360 degrees in the hip socked when the corresponding segment of the figure twisted as it fell.

**T-841-A5:**  Subject given a pair of scissors and instructed to sever twine loops connecting the head and torso of SCP-841.  Subject suffered complete decapitation and a shattered C4 vertebra.  SCP-841 repaired to full functionality with a fresh piece of cotton twine.
