Welcome to this installment of site news, where we have an 8-step program to doing things on time! Follow these steps in order to get stuff done in a timely manner:

# Start your assignment weeks in advance.
# Work diligently on it with a regular schedule.
# Fall behind for whatever reasons and don't work on it timely.
# Get overwhelmed by the amount of new material you have to keep up with.
# Struggle to come up with entertaining stuff.
# Struggle to find some neat fandom stuff you haven't already come across.
# Oh whoops, it's June 18th! Finish that shit all up.
# Vow to do better for next month, starting work on that straightaway.

...okay, maybe this isn't the best plan to follow.

This is a series showing off news from the site, articles from the past month, and fan-content for you to check out and discover! Be sure to leave a comment with your thoughts!

+++ On-Site News

++++ Featured Articles

* The featured articles for this month are [[[SCP-2127]]] ("Hinterkai-fun!") by [[*user fastandbulbous]] and [[[Footsteps]]] by [[*user Anborough]]. One's about a murder mystery placed on a grave for passerby to solve, and the other is about a son lashing out to his dad for following in his path. Check them out!
* The featured articles from last month were [[[SCP-2985]]] ("Anart, Author of the Scream") by [[*user TyGently]] and [[[exploration-log-2474-1|Exploration Log 2474.1]]] by [[*user minmin]].

++++ Rest of the News

* Decibelle (that me) has been back from break for a short while now, so that's cool! Been working on this since I came back, but still haven't gotten it up until now. I'm a professional.
* Sadly, both [[*user djkaktus]] and [[*user Crayne]] have stepped down from staff within the past couple months. Godspeed, you two, but please stick around the site. We need those seductive, dulcet DJ tones and duck huntings around these parts.
* However, since this is posted way later than it should be, one round of promotions have finished! Please welcome [[*user A Random Day]], [[*user ChrisAKAPiefish]], [[*user dankaar]], [[*user EldritchCyanide]], [[*user Jacob Conwell]], [[*user MrWrong]], [[*user Randomini]], and [[*user WrongJohnSilver]] to Operational Staff! In addition, please welcome [[*user ProcyonLotor]] to the position of Moderator!

+++ Fandom Stuff

What's been going on in the community aside from our site? Well...

* Couldn't find anything for May, my bad. Feel free to send me anything from May if you happen to know of anything, or even for June for next month's edition. Hell, I accept submissions every month : )

++++ Fanart

First off, the [http://ja.scp-wiki.net/ Japanese Branch] is holding an art contest with lots of amazing fucking art that you should be checking out and drooling over. To use this section to show off the art from there would be a disservice to other artists, so I'll only link you all a couple... for this month:

* [http://ja.scp-wiki.net/anthropomorphismscp This work] by user [[*user munlmu]] shows off some of the coolest personifications of SCPs that I've ever seen. Specifically, the 001 proposals. And the personality they're given through the personifications is really goddamn neat!
* Meanwhile, you get this [http://ja.scp-wiki.net/blue touching drawing] of [[[SCP-8900-EX]]] by user [[*user ikuragunkan]]. The contrast of colors and styles really drives home the story in such a simple manner that it's obvious what's going on, without lessening its impact.
* Okay, so this one is from June, but sue me! This is close enough to May that I figured I'd cheat and include this. [http://skincube.tumblr.com/ Skincube] makes some really impressive arts of various SCPs, and [http://skincube.tumblr.com/post/145279703155/scps-for-this-week-scp-073-cain-scp-847-the this photoset] of 073, 847, 200, and 203 is super sure to impress.
* That reimagining of Cain in [[[The Reassembled One]]] was pretty rad, wasn't it? Hopefully you'll also enjoy this [http://kantatibana.tumblr.com/post/145443073116/僕はセスだアベルじゃない-僕はセトだアベルじゃない-the-reassembled lowkey] art of that GOI Format by [http://kantatibana.tumblr.com Kantatibana].
* [http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=56936019 A log of a whole bunch of stuff], including fan-favorites 073 and 076, courtesy of user [http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=1674270 鐮鼬]. It's nice to take a break from all the murder and angst to just chill and be brothers.
* To round out this month's fanart section, we'll stop by [http://valeocrow.deviantart.com/ ValeoCrow's] DeviantArt to look at a really great image of [http://valeocrow.deviantart.com/art/SCP-1903-607436799 Jackie], or 1903. Is it possible for something bloody like this to be somber at the same time? Perhaps. Jackie doesn't have the best life, after all. I think this captures it pretty damn well.

Thanks for tuning in again, folks! Hey, listen, before you go; if you write an article and it sticks, //please// send me a blurb for your article. I may or may not use it (if I can think of something more attention-getting though I'll try to stick with one you give me) but I really would just like them in order to make the process easier for making these. In addition, this is a community thing, and I want authors to give their blurbs to sell these articles much easier. It reduces the workload I and the people helping me have to do.

Furthermore, if you guys would like to see an art contest on the site, let me know! It's something that seems like the community would benefit from, though the more people who would be willing to enter, the better. Thank you all for continuing to be an excellent community <3
