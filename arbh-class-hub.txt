**MEMO:** IC CHEESECAKE FINDINGS
**TRANSCRIPT:**
IC "Cheesecake" here. This is most likely the last thing any of us will //do// at the Foundation. But we've put together a file on how... well, how the world came to an end. You can find the file below, if you want. Personally, I had a bit on 682 but it turned out it was hungry locusts. It was a good run, guys. Good luck - you're gonna need it.
**AUTHOR:** Researcher Joe Fynegan

+++ **Critter Profile: Genghis!**
**//The start of this nightmare.//**

**EXCERPT:**
> 'Genghis' is our name for an Australian Locust who's settled down 'ere in good ol' Oregon. Assumedly after Australia, he lived in neighboring Wasco County, where his swarm caused a crop shortage. He was found when our experts determined that Genghis's swarm was growing at an unusually fast rate.

+++ **SCP-3619**
**//Cry "havoc" and let slip the dogs of war.//**

**EXCERPT:**
> One small swarm of SCP-3619 is contained in a standard biological containment cell at Site-121. It is to be fed daily with 500kg of fresh plant matter. Excess instances (past roughly 1500) are to be terminated as necessary. Any instances that escape containment are to be terminated by conventional means, such as fire or insecticide. Any personnel wishing to conduct experiments on SCP-LLLL should contact its current head researcher.

+++ **The Morality of Insects**
**//The insects weren't the problem ...//**

**EXCERPT:**
> **PETAHN:** Well, if LARPA does its job, the US won't need the Ration Acts and eventually there will be much more jobs in agriculture. We're working with LUBILOSAD to ensure it happens soon.
> 
> **DALY:** That takes care of the environment, but what about the locusts?
> 
> **SIMMONS:** Let me use an old FBI term. Terminate. With extreme prejudice.

+++ **The Last of LARPA**
**//... it was how we dealt with it.//**

**EXCERPT:**
> //"Containment breach in Section 12. All personnel evacuate the West sector. I repeat, containment breach in Section 12. All personnel evacuate the West sector. Over."// crackled the intercom.
> 
> Researcher Pettan overrode the G4 fire door leading back into Section 12. On the other side stood the captain of the MTF team δ-17, waiting for the researcher.
> 
> "What's the status, Captain Quayle?" Petahn asked as he jogged alongside the captain.
> 
> "There's fire everywhere. It's helping to contain the instances, but that also means our team can't contain them ourselves."

**//How did an O5 feel? What did they feel?//**

**EXCERPT:**
> "Cold, not cruel" is how the Foundation was always described to you. From day one, you were told that the Foundation's actions were based on this motto.
> 
> As an Overseer, you were supposed to keep it that way. Remain a cold, emotionless organization run by cold, emotionless humans. No matter the situation, you were to keep a straight face devoid of any emotion. Even if the world was coming to an end.
> 
> Yet there was something different about this scenario. You've seen the world end more times than you could count on both hands. What specifically could make this apocalypse worse than all the others?
