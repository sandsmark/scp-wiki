**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the nature of SCP-5019, it is currently uncontained. Foundation web crawlers have been unable to suppress any mentions of SCP-5019. Administered amnestics have been shown to have no affect. Any mention of SCP-5019 is to be monitored by Foundation web crawlers. Copies should be downloaded and stored on a secure hard drive.

**Description:** SCP-5019 is a nonexistent episode of the television cartoon //Loopy Lilly// titled //Ick Day.// SCP-5019 is displayed as the 15th episode of the 3rd season of the show, despite there being no record of such an episode ever being aired or created. Non-affected individuals remember the episode in its true state as a canceled project (see below.) The status, contents, and description of the episode vary per affected individual.

According to a Foundation web scan of all internet platforms, the release status of SCP-5019 has been remembered in the following various ways:

* The episode had an official television release, but no saved copy exists. Rather, only official statements and plot summaries confirming its release. The consensus among those displaying this effect is that it is considered "lost media".
* The episode can be found in the same manner as the rest of the series. 
* The episode was planned for release, but was canceled with only a title and number released. This is the status remembered by non affected individuals, and is the factually true status.  
* The episode is a horror story written by a user of an online forum that is popularly mistaken for a lost episode.
* The episode is a horror story written by a user of an online forum that is remembered as such, and is not mistaken for being official content. 
* The episode is only rumored to exist, with the origin of this rumor unknown.
* The episode is rumored to exist, but is confirmed fake by an individual who worked on the show.
* The episode does not exist in any form, not even in its true form as a canceled title.

As concluded by Foundation-run tests and interviews, those affected by SCP-5019 will view all discussion related to SCP-5019 as matching their own recollection, despite evidence to the contrary. This effect also applies to any stills or clips of SCP-5019.

    Non-existence confirmed makes so much sense. I thought it was real for the longest time, and dude, it scared the shit out of me. I mean I heard stuff about Lilly kicking her lamb into the street, and there were pictures of the scene. So fuckin glad those are fake and fanmade. Ick Day, the episode where Lilly went of being mean and grumpy to her friends around time because she was sick and refused medicine. I'd have nightmares about that when I was little. It's a show for like 5 to 9 year olds! God I hate the internet lmao

Basically Lilly is out in the town with her friends and someone near them gets sick and then they're scared that they'll get sick. The spend the whole episode being super careful afraid that they'll get germs and stuff. At the end they all get sick. The episode was controversial because parents were afraid it sent a kinda mean message. It's weird that it's lost. Now I don't remember much either, that's about it. [[/span]]

**Addendum-1:**

On 09-08-2016, a notable user under the name of Nichola.Myerssss (dubbed PoI-5019) was found on various discussion threads of various sites discussing SCP-5019. PoI-5019 appears to be affected by SCP-XXXX in a way that differs from all other cases of SCP-5019's affect. Most affected individuals see all discussions of SCP-5019 fitting their view of it, while PoI-5019 views each discussion written in its true nature. PoI-5019 claims to be the writer of the episode and that it does exist, but was never released. Other affected individuals see PoI-5019's comments as supporting their view of SCP-5019.


Below is an abridged list of comments PoI-5019 has made on discussion threads revolving around SCP-5019:

**Addendum-2:** 

On 12-04-17, Agent Carawoa discovered the root of SCP-5019's anomalous features stem from PoI-6786, whom she knows through a Foundation undercover operation she is currently involved in.

Agent Carawoa reports that PoI-6786 was a member of the production cast for //Loopy Lilly//, and was upset that PoI-5019 was given the production lead role of the series finale instead of her. PoI-6786 expressed disinterest in PoI-5019's finished product, believing that the message she was trying to spread was inappropriate for a program of a light-hearted nature. PoI-6786 admitted creating a finished clip for the episode, and to implementing it as a part of PoI-6786's work. PoI-5019 submitted the clip to her boss, and SCP-5019 suddenly manifested. PoI-6786 is unaware as to how her messing with the episode spread such an affect, but holds clear guilt as she explained the situation to fellow members of her artists' cabal.

Agent Carawoa was able to retrieve stills from the completed clip PoI-6786 created. The following are currently under Foundation investigation.
