If you've somehow stumbled onto this page, congrats I guess, I've accidentally uploaded my art collection to the internal network. If you've stumbled onto this page while hacking my computer, fuck you.

If you ask nicely, I'll draw you some cool art I guess. Either way, have fun, and I hope I haven't done anything that actually gets me in trouble.
