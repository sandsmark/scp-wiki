**Name:** {{Dr. Harrison W. Balthazaar}}

**Security Clearance:** {{Level 2}}

**Position:** {{Carnivorous anomaly specialist}}

**Current Location:** {{Has offices in Sites 40 and 27}}

**History:** {{Dr.Balthazaar joined the Foundation Several years ago following a career in zoology, and quickly went on to earn a reputation for being a reckless individual fascinated with anomalous wildlife. There are multiple documents showing Dr. Balthazaar bodily tackling such anomalies in the efforts of relocating them to containment suites for further study. He has a marked tendency towards supporting the Ethics Committee, and towards empathising with animalistic anomalies. Enthusiastic and boisterous, Dr. Balthazaar has very good professional and personal relationships with most of his coworkers.}}

> NOTE: Can we not refer to the carnivorous anomalies as monsters? Really most of them are just misunderstood animals. Sure, 682 has a bit of a temper, but I'm sure this is perfectly natural for its species. Crikey, it's like you don't understand him (her?) at all.
