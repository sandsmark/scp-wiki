{{Dr.Balthazaar joined the Foundation several years ago following a career in zoology in his native Australia, and quickly went on to earn a reputation for being a reckless individual fascinated with anomalous wildlife. There are multiple documented cases showing Dr. Balthazaar bodily tackling such anomalies in the efforts of relocating them to containment suites for further study. He has a marked tendency towards supporting the Ethics Committee, and towards empathising with animalistic anomalies. Enthusiastic and boisterous, Dr. Balthazaar has cordial professional and personal relationships with most of his coworkers. In his spare time, Dr. Balthazaar enjoys photography, surfing, shooting, eating, wildlife documentaries, weightlifting and visiting zoos. He is a dedicated Essendon Football Club supporter, and has received 40 reprimands for reckless behaviour regarding animalistic anomalies. These have generally not been followed up on due to his uncommon intuition and connection with wildlife both anomalous and mundane.}}

{{Married to one Felicia B Balthazaar, a veterinarian unaware of the Foundation, believing Dr. Balthazaar to be a zoological researcher. Any events including staff family members are to adhere to cover story 23-H.}}

> NOTE: {{//Can we not refer to the carnivorous anomalies as monsters? Really most of them are just misunderstood animals. Sure, 682 has a bit of a temper, but I'm sure this is perfectly natural for its species. Crikey, it's like you don't understand him (her?) at all. I mean, I don't either, but I might be right maybe.

[[tab SCP Commentary]]
**SCP-2467:** This is my first scip that I wrote, and I think she turned out pretty well. At the time I was reading a book on rogue waves, and was wondering how many ships were lost at sea because of them. Then I had the thought "What if something was making the rogue waves?" So I came up with a cannibal boat driven by a captain who long ago found something that allowed them and ship to be one, but still required replacement parts. It did change as time went by, but I'm really proud of how it turned out, even if it did take months to write.

**SCP-3019:** My second scip, and probably my least favorite if I'm honest. I think I jumped the gun in posting it before it was ready, but I really wanted to be in on the horror contest. This one came from my old job, an awful gig as a despatch worker at a wholesale nursery. It's very hot, hard work that often started before the sun rose and ended after it set. This was my attempt to show people the horrors of what it was like to work in a nursery, and the people made into compost is directly inspired by a near miss I had where someone turned on the mulcher while I was inside cleaning it. I took the photo for the page one morning at about 5am headed in before the lights were on.

**SCP-4159:** I got the idea for this when I was on holiday in Gippsland. I was trying to bodysurf at one of my favorite beaches, but there'd been a storm not long before and there was a lot of kelp in the water and washed up on the sand. As you'd imagine, it sucks swimming through kelp, so it kinda spoiled things a bit. But it did remind me of my childhood fear of seeing one of those mounds of washed up kelp just decide to one day stand up and start walking. the result was 4159. After having the idea, I got down to the beach with my camera to get some good photos of the kelp and put the results in the article.

**SCP-4924:** Honestly don't know where this one came from to be honest. I got to reading about natural disasters on Wikipedia, somehow came to the Boston Molasses flood and then thought I could do something with it.
