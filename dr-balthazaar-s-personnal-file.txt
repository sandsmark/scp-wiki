{{Dr.Balthazaar joined the Foundation several years ago following a career in zoology in his native Australia, and quickly went on to earn a reputation for being a reckless individual fascinated with anomalous wildlife. There are multiple documented cases showing Dr. Balthazaar bodily tackling such anomalies in the efforts of relocating them to containment suites for further study.

Enthusiastic and boisterous, Dr. Balthazaar has cordial professional and personal relationships with most of his coworkers. In his spare time, Dr. Balthazaar enjoys photography, surfing, shooting, eating, wildlife documentaries, weightlifting and visiting zoos. He is a dedicated Essendon Football Club supporter, and has received 40 reprimands for reckless behaviour regarding animalistic anomalies. These have generally not been followed up on due to his uncommon intuition and connection with wildlife both anomalous and mundane.}}

> NOTE: {{//Can we not refer to the carnivorous anomalies as monsters? Really most of them are just misunderstood animals. Sure, 682 has a bit of a temper, but I'm sure this is perfectly natural for its species. Crikey, it's like you don't understand him (her?) at all. I mean, I don't either, but I might be right maybe.

[[tab SCP Commentary]]
**SCP-2467:** This is my first scip that I wrote, and I think she turned out pretty well. At the time I was reading a book on rogue waves, and was wondering how many ships were lost at sea because of them. Then I had the thought "What if something was making the rogue waves?" So I came up with a cannibal boat driven by a captain who long ago found something that allowed them and ship to be one, but still required replacement parts. It did change as time went by, but I'm really proud of how it turned out, even if it did take months to write.

**SCP-3019:** My second scip, and probably my least favorite if I'm honest. I think I jumped the gun in posting it before it was ready, but I really wanted to be in on the horror contest. This one came from my old job, an awful gig as a despatch worker at a wholesale nursery. It's very hot, hard work that often started before the sun rose and ended after it set. This was my attempt to show people the horrors of what it was like to work in a nursery, and the people made into compost is directly inspired by a near miss I had where someone turned on the mulcher while I was inside cleaning it. I took the photo for the page one morning at about 5am headed in before the lights were on.

**SCP-4159:** I got the idea for this when I was on holiday in Gippsland. I was trying to bodysurf at one of my favorite beaches, but there'd been a storm not long before and there was a lot of kelp in the water and washed up on the sand. As you'd imagine, it sucks swimming through kelp, so it kinda spoiled things a bit. But it did remind me of my childhood fear of seeing one of those mounds of washed up kelp just decide to one day stand up and start walking. the result was 4159. After having the idea, I got down to the beach with my camera to get some good photos of the kelp and put the results in the article.

**SCP-4924:** Honestly don't know where this one came from to be honest. I got to reading about natural disasters on Wikipedia, somehow came to the Boston Molasses flood and then thought I could do something with it.

[[include component:image-block name=https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/517505764974264331/658113922414411806/4715.png?width=276&height=300|caption=An artistic rendering of SCP-4715|width=280px]]

**SCP-4715:** Well I obviously didn't come up with the idea, but I saw the ARC when I first joined the wiki in 2011 or so, and at the time I didn't understand why it had been archived. I thought it was super neat and cool and rad. As I continued to lurk about the site for years, I forgot about a lot of the early scps that I read, but not 517-ARC. It stuck with me, maybe because of the picture (I wish I could have used that.). Anyway, after I got a few successful scips under my belt, I was feeling confident in my writing ability, and before I wrote tunnel revenant this idea had formed where 517 was a bigfoot weapon the made to fight the humans. Moose explained to me that doesn't work since it was a surprise attack by the humans, that's how they won. That's how the current version came to be.
It was a lot of fun to write, though frustrating at times. It was very hard to describe its secondary arms. I had the mental image of how they looked, but the only animal that ever had hands(?) like these was chalicotherium back in the Pleistocene. And I think those paleontologists were just as stumped by them as me because they seem to actively avoid describing them. I als put in a lot of research into particularly bloody wars, cave paintings, and the workings of kangaroo tails. A lot of this didn't end up in the scp itself, but I basically got a working understanding of how its various anatomical traits would work. 
I addition to all this, I also tried to include nods towards various historic/ religious events that it could plausibly have been involved in, as well as nods towards various aspects of SCP history too. These include:
* showing the skull of it as the picture, which is like the original. The SCP it fought is also the same as the original, being [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-076 Able]
* Its existence being confirmed in October of 1916 refers to the battle of Somme, the bloodiest battle of WW1
* It's activity in china during the 19th century is in reference to the Taiping Rebellions, which historians estimate caused up to 100,000,000 deaths (Holy shit)
* Being referred to as "the beast from the earth" in the woodcarving is a nod toward the book of revelations, where the beast from the earth possessed two horns and had a voice like a dragon. It declared that any who did not worship it or its image would be killed. I thought this fit pretty well with the waning moon ritual.
* Incident-4715-1944-J refers to its enthusiastic participation in ww2. In this case, I had the idea that it manually turned AA guns toward naval vessels to draw them into the fight.
* All the animals I reference in its genetic makeup display a particular trait that I used in the pictures and cave paintings I made. It's stance is from a gorilla, its horns are from ibex, the tail is binturong, the musculature of the secondary limbs is human. The hind legs are based on both bears and megatherium, the head in general on a cave lion with the dentition of a hyaenodon, and the arms, hands and to an extent tail are from the marsupial lion. I also worked to incorporate elements of leopard seal.

[[image 25346619_1643601049069931_1456354476_o.jpg size="medium"]]
Taken on my phone (Samsung galaxy note 4) at my old work one morning before I turned on the lights. Was creepy, but at least there weren't any plantmen wandering about.

[[image sandbox.jpg size="medium"]]
this is the only photo I ever outright took with the idea of it being an SCP in mind when I took it. It's the beach where I learned to swim. It's located in Bass Strait, which is a notoriously rough bit of sea. when there are storms, huge mounds of kelp wash up on the beach. One time in the 1990s when I was young they were filming a movie on that beach and every morning before they would shoot, a bulldozer had to go and clear all the seaweed and kelp from the beach so it looked good for the movie.
Taken on Nikon D3100.

[[image Angling.jpg size="medium"]]
I took this photo in 2013 or so when I had recently got my nikon. I was very excited and went for a walk around the ocean beaches and saw this red kelp tossed up on one of the rocks and thought it looked cool. Then five years later I found myself writing an SCP about kelp and I was like "BINGPOT."

[[image Skull size="medium"]]
Since I don't want to subtract from the mystery or break any illusions, I won't say what sort of animal this skull comes from. I will say that it's about the size of a persons torso and the fangs are as long as my thumbs. I took it on Wilsons Promontory, the southernmost part of the Australian mainland a few years ago camping with my friends. On this same trip I got attacked by an emu but overall it was a good time.

[[image Cave%20painting size="medium"]]
This one is a little different. I knew that for my rewrite of SCP-517-ARC I wanted to include a cave painting, but I didn't know any neanderthals, and all the caves in my area are made of red sandstone that you can't paint on since it just washes right off immediately. I eventually looked up a lot of tutorials on how to draw in the cave painting style, sketched out several references so I knew how the creatures anatomy would work, and eventually put this to paper using charcoal I burned in my firepit. I then took a photo of it with my phone, applied various cave texture filters and spent a few days tweaking it in photoshop. I'm fairly happy with how it came out overall.
