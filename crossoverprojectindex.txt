title:Project Crossover
So, the SCP Foundation is quickly becoming, if it is not already, a "thing" on the internets. However, there is one more step we must take before we become a full-out "thing."

Terrible crossover fanfiction.

This is your challenge: write a crossover fanfiction between the SCP Foundation and any other fictional universe of your choice. It can be hilarious, tongue-in-cheek, or deadly serious, just as long as it is well-written. Extra points scored for "crackiest" crossover. Post links below.

That is all.
