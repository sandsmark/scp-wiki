title:Project Crossover
//So, the SCP Foundation is quickly becoming, if it is not already, a "thing" on the internets. However, there is one more step we must take before we become a full-out "thing."//

//Terrible crossover fanfiction.//

//This is your challenge: write a crossover fanfiction between the SCP Foundation and any other fictional universe of your choice. It can be hilarious, tongue-in-cheek, or deadly serious, just as long as it is well-written. Extra points scored for "crackiest" crossover. Post links below.//

//That is all.//

//—Clef//
