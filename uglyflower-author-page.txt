**UglyFlower's Diary (privit, dunt read plz)**

Dear Diary,

Long ago, I saw a page that was undoubtedly the best page in the world. That page was the closest to heaven that I’ve ever been. I've since forgotten how to get to that page, but it will live on in my heart forever.

The best page in the world didn’t depict or look anything like this page. This is just a tribute. You’ve got to believe me and I wish you were there. It’s just a matter of opinion.

The following articles aren’t the best pages in the world either. They too, are just tributes to the best page in the world.
