**Special Containment Procedures:**  Only D-Class level personnel are permitted to enter the building containing SCP-1851.  Six to ten armed guards are to be stationed around the perimeter of the building containing SCP-1851.  A two meter tall chain link fence is to surround the two hundred square meter property.  Unauthorized individuals entering the property are to be ordered to leave, or administered Class C amnestics if non-compliant and deposited in ████ Medical Center.

To prevent SCP-1851 from actively hunting, a rabbit will be released into the building every three days.

Discarded instances of SCP-1851-1 are to be stored in Site-███ until further notice.

**Description:** SCP-1851 is a doll that resembles a 1.57 meter tall female Caucasian with blond hair and hazel eyes.  SCP-1851 resides within a building[[footnote]]The building containing SCP-1851 is a Victorian era styled home that has noticeable external weathering, however, the interior is distinctly more well kept[[/footnote]], located near ████,  ██████. SCP-1851 is typically observed using a remotely controlled rover. SCP-1851 moves throughout the containment site, occasionally performing maintenance on the interior and exterior of the building and grounds.  The maintenance SCP-1851 provides includes tending the garden, repairing the walls of the building, and cleaning the floors.  Personnel on-site have reported that SCP-1851 notices the presence of individuals, but does not actively attempt to communicate.

SCP-1851 remains docile until any live member of Mammalia or Aves enters the building, after which SCP-1851's predatory behavior activates.  However, if the animal does not meet the requirements for SCP-1851 (the exact requirements have yet to be determined) [[footnote]] SCP-1851 has shown noted preference of the following taxa: Equines, Felines, Lapins, Lupines, and Sapiens [[/footnote]], it will be killed and discarded upon entering the building.

SCP-1851 then proceeds to drag the animal (referred to as SCP-1851-1) within the confines of the building.  The animal is then converted to a doll in approximately thirty minutes. The initial stage of the conversion is the shrinking of the subject, ending when the subject shrinks to one tenth of its size. After progressing through stage one, the subject’s internal mass becomes either a hollow cavity or cotton, based on analysis of discarded dolls. Finally, the subject's skin is converted into porcelain or plastic if made hollow, or cloth if filled with cotton.

After evaluating SCP-1851-1, SCP-1851 proceeds to store the doll in a toy box in the nursery or discard the doll.  Attempts to retrieve non discarded instances of SCP-1851-1 from SCP-1851 have led to violent reactions, which led to the destruction of two rovers and three drones. However, retrieval of discarded instances have yielded no reaction from SCP-1851.  After the process is over, SCP-1851 returns to the former behavior of moving throughout the building.

If SCP-1851 does not have any interactions with a new instance of SCP-1851-1 for a week, it actively seeks organisms for the conversion process.

Once the building is overfilled, SCP-1851 buries excess dolls in the area around the building.

**Addendum 1**
The Foundation was first alerted of SCP-1851 by reports of people being dragged out of their homes and disappearing near the town of ████, ██████.  Mobile Task Force Phi-3 (aka "Collectors") was sent to the house to determine the cause of the disappearances.

**Addendum-1851-2**
On 7/6/20██, Researchers noticed a sharp increase in predatory behavior and doll-production from SCP-1851, followed by a complete cessation of activity on 7/8/20██. On 7/9/20██, audio devices placed within the building recorded sounds resembling human singing. Due to the unusual circumstances, clearance was given for Researcher Julia ████████ to enter the building for purposes of documentation. Upon entering, Researcher Julia ████████ found SCP-1851 moving around the home's kitchen, apparently docile. SCP-1851 was approached, and attempts at communication were made. Enclosed are the results of Researcher Julia ████████'s attempt.

> **Interviewed:** SCP-1851
> 
> <Begin Log>
> 
> **Researcher Julia █████████:** Can you understand me?
> 
> **SCP-1851:** Oh, of course! I've been taught English very well.
> 
> **Researcher Julia █████████:** Can you tell me what you're doing in this house?
> 
> **SCP-1851:** Well, lately I've just been keeping it tidy in anticipation of my family's return. Father loves coming home to a clean house.
> 
> **Researcher Julia █████████:** I see. What can you tell me about your family?
> 
> **SCP-1851:** Oh, they're very nice people, I am sure they would love to meet you. Mother loves having guests, and the young mistress is very polite!
> 
> **Researcher Julia █████████:** Why have you been... singing?
> 
> **SCP-1851:** Because a special day is very near, and I am trying to create a nice atmosphere.
> 
> **Researcher Julia █████████:** Special day?
> 
> **SCP-1851:** Oh yes. The young mistress' birthday is only a few days away! Such a happy occasion.
> 
> **Researcher Julia █████████:** I see. 
> 
> **SCP-1851:** I do hope she will return soon, I have worked very hard on her gifts.
> 
> **Researcher Julia █████████:** Gifts? You mean the dolls you make?
> 
> **SCP-1851:** Yes! She is very fond of dolls, you see. However she is... not fond of the process with which I make them.
> 
> **Researcher Julia █████████:** Can you tell me how old she will be?
> 
> **SCP-1851:** Well, this is a celebration of the young mistress' ninth birthday. It is long overdue, and I have no intentions of celebrating later birthdays until she has celebrated this one. I've been trying to learn a song for her, but I'm afraid my talents leave much to be desired.
> 
> **Researcher Julia █████████:** When was the last time you saw your family?
> 
> **SCP-1851:** It has been... a very long time. I believe 147 years.
> 
> **Researcher Julia █████████:** Is it possible that they won't return?
> 
> **SCP-1851:** Of course not! When I was given to the young mistress, it was with the express promise that I was only... temporary. The young mistress will return, and soon after, so will her father! Until then, I will continue in my duties.
> 
> **Researcher Julia █████████:** What exactly do your duties inc-
> 
> **SCP-1851:** <subject becomes agitated> I think you should leave. I'll not have you upsetting the young mistress when she arrives.

SCP-1851 ceased interaction at this time, and turned away from Researcher Julia █████████. Before leaving, Researcher Julia █████████ noticed an inscription on SCP-1851's back. A note was made of this, and surveillance within the house was later able to get a clear image of it. SCP-1851 returned to normal behavioral patterns one day later.

//Inscribed on the back of SCP-1851//
"To my beloved (daughter), I know I can't be there (for you), and I am sorry. I wish I could. I hope this gift helps."
