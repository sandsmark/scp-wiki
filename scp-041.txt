**Item #:** SCP-041
 
**Object Class:** Safe
 
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-041 is to be hospitalized at Bio-Research Area-12. Though not Keter class, should SCP-041's abilities ever propagate beyond a reasonably containable area, the risk of SCP sensitive information being broadcasted to the public remains too great a risk and warrants Area-Level isolation away from the general populace. SCP personnel wanting to keep their thoughts private are advised to remain outside of a fifteen (15) meter radius from SCP-041, beyond the designated red circle on the floor.  
 
It is beneficial to the mental health of SCP-041 to have a "sitter" in the room who watches television and concentrates on programing. This allows SCP-041 to effectively "watch" television through the mind of someone else. The optimal sitter is a class D personnel with below average intelligence whose mind does not typically wander or have more than one train of thought at a time. Though not mind control, SCP-041 has expressed enough coercion to convince sitters to watch programming that they don't enjoy. SCP-041's tastes vary between gore/slasher films (having even expressed interest in "snuff") and children's programming.

**Description:** SCP-041 is a patient suffering from irreversible damage to his central nervous system which is believed to have been caused by an infection of a rare strain of bacterial meningitis. Though antibiotics were successful in clearing the infection, the membranes surrounding his brain and spinal cord had reacted to the infection by severing many neurons connecting the central nervous system to the rest of the body. SCP-041 must rely on a respirator to sustain his breathing and a biventricular pacemaker keeps the subject's heart beating, while a naso-gastric tube provides nutrition.
 
Visually, SCP-041 appears to be in a persistent vegetative state.  However, observers in the presence of SCP-041 begin to realize that their thoughts, along with everyone else's in about a 10 meter radius is broadcasted in a semi-audible fashion.  Aside from being the source, SCP-041 is also capable of broadcasting his own thoughts to those present. Anyone forming an idea using words will have those thoughts unwillingly transmitted to others as "mind audible speech" which cannot be recorded by any known equipment. (Correction: See Addendum-01). Mind audible speech may be "heard" using whatever voice a subject chooses to think with, the subject's normal voice being the most typical voice  (See Document-01).  
 
Visual thoughts and images are broadcasted but are not received as readily.  Images are most effectively transmitted when both the sender and receiver have their eyes closed, the sender concentrates on a single object without environment or background and the receiver has a mind clear of conscious thoughts. Communication between subjects using visual images, particularly those not rooted in memory but imagination, is difficult as the sender has trouble conceiving a highly detailed mental object from a single point of view and the receiver tries to interpret the image in his own mind. The receiver will often try to fill in gaps of information, ultimately resulting in a different picture. The most difficult imagery being a person's face while the imagined subject is in motion.
 
SCP-041 is not very "talkative." Attempts to persuade him to divulge any understanding of the phenomenon have been so far fruitless. The subject is typically silent and won't normally respond to any direct attempts at communication. Though he appears to have a sense of humor as he interjects anecdotes into conversations of others.
 
**Addendum-01:** While researcher ███████  ███████ was taking voice notes using a digital audio recorder, a fellow researcher was changing the television in SCP-041's room.  While the television was on a channel of static, disembodied voices could be heard filtered though the white noise. Attempts to record mind audible speech with white noise generators and sound recording equipment have begun to yield modest results, though most audio is garbled and recorded sounds may or may not be voices and is widely left toward individual interpretations.
 
**Addendum-02:** //"It has come to my attention that several personnel have used SCP-041 as a ad-hoc 'she likes me/she likes me not' detector. This is one of the most appalling things I've ever heard. Are we safeguarding potentially world-destroying objects or are we in third grade?"// -- Dr. Klein.

**Addendum-03:** Personnel D-4█████, who had been previously exposed to SCP-107, was exposed to SCP-041, despite the fact that SCP-107's containment procedures strictly prohibit such contact. Within ██ minutes SCP-041 began broadcasting SCP-107 at high mental "volume." 17 personnel, including the doctors assigned to study SCP-041, became infected. SCP-041 was administered SCP-500. The other 17 personnel, now classified as SCP-107-(1-17), are currently stored in cryo-stasis in SCP-107's chamber.

**Document-01: Researcher's Quote:**  //"Ya know, the first time I was in that room with Kent and forty-one,I kept hearing this singing.  It was this little girls voice singing some kid's song.  It wasn't the TV and it definitely wasn't a radio... It was in our heads... ya know.  So I think, 'ya know, if I was stuck in bed, without anything else to do, I'd sing like a little girl too.'  And then this voice comes into my head, 'Hey, it's not me... I don't know that tune."  and then ol' Kent looks at me, all red in the face... ya,know."//

**Note:** This event occurred after [[[SCP-239]]] was placed in a chemically induced coma. Any connection between the two SCPs is current unconfirmed.
