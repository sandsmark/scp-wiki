[http://www.creepypasta.com/ CreepyPasta.Com] A library of CreepyPasta. More Regularly updated than our own Library, and maybe a little more extensive.

[http://misterwelldone.wordpress.com/ Curious Things] The Home of Mister Welldone. Check this place out if you like his Stuff in the Library.

[http://zip.4chan.org/x/imgboard.html /x/] The source of a good deal of CreepyPasta. Also, this is where Black Fedora regularly posts, so check it out if you want.

[http://sayainunderworld.blogspot.com/ Saya in UNDERWORLD] Looking for Eastern Flavor? Look no farther! This is one of the best English speaking area's of Eastern Creepypasta on the Net.

[http://theholders.org/ The Holders] The Holder's series, a collection of things out before the SCP. Different, but still good. Check it out!

[http://www.dangerousthings.net/ The Repository of Dangerous Things], a now-defunct webcomic with a similar approach as the SCP Foundation to unusual objects and phenomena, with a somewhat broader scope - the key word is //dangerous//, thus including such things as cell phones, banned books, and Being On Fire. The RDT is also severly understaffed, so less artifact studying is possible.

[http://serverroom.us/asx/listen.asx?sid=255023 SCP Radio] A radio program in Site 17 hosted by Dr. Kondraki, SCP Radio is now on the air. Check it out.
