**Item #:** SCP-5000

**Object Class:** Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5000's body is to be kept in a standard human cadaver storage chamber. Foundation personnel may only examine SCP-5000's body with Level-1 Clearance or above.

**Description:** SCP-5000 was a 29-year-old Anglo-American human male, standing 1.63 meters tall and weighing 75 kilograms. SCP-5000 was previously thought to be physically immortal and had previously demonstrated incredible durability against various forms of trauma and bodily harm.

SCP-5000 had previously endured the following with no adverse affects:
* Assault via firearm.
* Blunt force.
* Repeated stabbing.
* Immolation.
* Consumption and inhalation of toxins.
* Explosives.
* Long-term exposure to a vacuum.
* Self-inflicted harm. (During and between recorded experiments)

SCP-5000 had claimed to previously be vulnerable, as evidenced through a burn scar on the back of its right hand, which it claimed was from an incident with a stove top. It is yet unknown what caused SCP-5000 to gain its anomalous properties.

SCP-5000's cadaver shows no sign of anomalous durability; as such, it has since been classified as Neutralized as of Incident 5000-01 on September 27th, 2022.

**Incident 5000-01 Dossier:** On September 27th, 2022, during a routine experimentation session with SCP-5000, Researcher Faith deBolt, wielding a firearm previously used in prior experiments, successfully neutralized SCP-5000 with a single shot to the forehead. Post-mortem examination concludes that approximately 6 seconds passed between the bullet entering SCP-5000's skull and its death. An investigation was later put in place to determine the reason behind its death. Suspects of note are listed below, as submitted by Foundation Researchers in the order of submission.

[[collapsible show="Open Dossier" hide="Close Dossier"]]

> **Suspect 5000-01**
> **Researcher:** Researcher Faith deBolt
> **Description:** Suspect 5000-01 is a model of Ruger LCP handgun, which was previously in SCP-5000's possession prior to its containment. Suspect 5000-01 had been used previously on SCP-5000 to no effect.
> **Investigation:** Suspect 5000-01 was used in several experiments against multiple immortal entities in Foundation facilities. No effects were achieved similar to the one achieved through Incident 5000-01.
> **Conclusion:** Suspect 5000-01 did not terminate SCP-5000.

> **Suspect 5000-02**
> **Researcher:** Researcher Faith deBolt
> **Description:** Suspect 5000-02 is Researcher Faith deBolt, the researcher responsible for firing the weapon that terminated SCP-5000 during Incident 5000-01.
> **Investigation:** Suspect 5000-02 was told to attack several immortal entities with the intent to kill, using a variety of methods including firearms, blunt weapons, bladed weapons, her bare hands, and remotely-operated weaponry. No effects were achieved similar to the one achieved through Incident 5000-01.
> **Conclusion:** Suspect 5000-02 did not terminate SCP-5000.

> **Suspect 5000-03**
> **Researcher:** Researcher Faith deBolt
> **Description:** Suspect 5000-03 is the containment chamber that SCP-5000 was housed in for the duration of its approximately three-year containment, which was also the chamber where it was terminated.
> **Investigation:** A single immortal entity was housed within Suspect 5000-03 until it had reached the exact amount of time in containment that SCP-5000 had experienced. The entity was experimented on with the intent to terminate. No effects were achieved similar to the one achieved through Incident 5000-01.
> **Conclusion:** Suspect 5000-03 did not terminate SCP-5000.

> **Suspect 5000-08**
> **Researcher:** Researcher Carlyle Fleming
> **Description:** Suspect 5000-08 is SCP-5000's ex-wife. Interviews from SCP-5000 claimed that she "wanted (it) dead more than anything".
> **Investigation:** Suspect 5000-08 was covertly abducted and scanned for anomalous activity. Suspect 5000-08 was then taken through the same experiments as used for Suspect 5000-02. No effects were achieved similar to the one achieved through Incident 5000-01. Suspect 5000-08 was then amnesticized and returned to her home.
> **Conclusion:** Suspect 5000-08 did not terminate SCP-5000.

> **Suspect 5000-12**
> **Researcher:** Researcher Jonesy Katzenburg
> **Description:** Suspect 5000-12 is the specific area in the middle forehead where SCP-5000 was shot, theorized to have never been harmed prior to SCP-5000's death.
> **Investigation:** Audio, video, and written documentation of each experiment tested on SCP-5000 is currently being examined. Investigation is unclear and incomplete, particularly due to the fact that interviews from SCP-5000 claim that they had attained their anomalous properties several years prior to their containment. While evidence has shown that previous experiments have harmed SCP-5000 in a similar if not exact location on the forehead, Researcher Katzenburg has kept the investigation open. He has insisted that Suspect 5000-12 may be as small as a fraction of a millimeter in size.
> **Conclusion:** Unknown, deemed unlikely.

> **Suspect 5000-21**
> **Researcher:** Researcher Jonesy Katzenburg
> **Description:** Suspect 5000-21 is the exact sequence of events SCP-5000 went through before their death.
> **Investigation:** As one Foundation Researcher that experimented on SCP-5000 at the time has since been permanently hospitalized, this particular investigation cannot be completed without harm to the researcher.
> **Conclusion:** Unknown.

> **Suspect 5000-29**
> **Researcher:** Researcher Gretchen Reuters
> **Description:** Suspect 5000-29 is an event that took place within the period that SCP-5000 took to die.
> **Investigation:** Suspect 5000-29 was first discovered by accident while investigating [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3885 SCP-3885], and an incident that occurred with an instance of SCP-3885-01. At the exact moment that SCP-5000 had been terminated, an instance of SCP-3885-01 had perished in an explosion; the first and currently only recorded time an instance of SCP-3885-01 perished. Further investigation into other contained immortal entities during the exact moment SCP-5000 had perished had not given similar results, as few were in positions that would cause them to perish in the first place.
> **Conclusion:** Unknown.

> **Suspect 5000-33**
> **Researcher:** Therapist Emilia Daring[[footnote]]Worked with SCP-5000 often prior to its death.[[/footnote]]
> **Description:** Suspect 5000-33 is a misunderstanding of SCP-5000's anomalous properties.
> **Investigation:** Prior interviews with SCP-5000 had claimed that it had previously discovered its anomalous properties during an attempted suicide. According to several psychological evaluations, Therapist Daring had noted that SCP-5000's depression had worsened from feeling it was obligated to die due to outside pressure, to actively seeking death for their own sake. Due to the correlation to its psychological state, it could be believed that the extent of SCP-5000's anomalous properties were over-estimated.
> **Conclusion:** Unknown.
