**Item #:** SCP-1605

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1605 is to be kept in a standard metal film canister in a locked, dry room at Storage Facility ██. Access is to be provided only upon written request to senior site staff. Screenings of SCP-1605 for purposes unrelated to testing are forbidden.

**Description:** SCP-1605 is a black and white short film in the Surrealist style entitled “Appeler Une Croix” (Termed A Cross). The film is currently 13 minutes in length, and can be shown on a standard 35 mm projector. The film is has proven difficult to date precisely, although its use of nitrocellulose as a film base likely puts its production before 1950. The physical film displays no unusual characteristics other than a lack of degradation common to nitrate films. The film alleges to be by Marcel Sabourin and gives its copyright date as “circa quartam” (around four o’clock).

When watched in its entirety by a sapient being capable of processing audio-visual stimuli, the subject disappears and their likeness appears in the film. Their likeness proceeds to behave in a manner consistent with the subject’s past actions and is fully capable of interacting with characters and objects within the film. Testing has yet to confirm any upper limit on the number of subjects that can be absorbed by the film at a single time. With each subject absorbed, the film increases by an average of three seconds. It is theorized that, given the average increase and the number of subject names between 6:48 and 7:05, the original film was approximately six minutes long. The additional film is visually and chemically indistinguishable from earlier scenes.

**Addendum:** //Playthroughs of the film vary slightly depending on the actions taken by the subjects, but all appear to follow the same sequence.// -Dr. ███████
