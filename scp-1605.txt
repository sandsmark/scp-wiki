**Item #:** SCP-1605

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1605 is to be kept in a standard metal film canister in a locked, dry room at Storage Facility ██. Access is to be provided only upon written request to senior site staff. Screenings of 1605 for purposes unrelated to testing are forbidden. Personnel charged with displaying the film are strongly cautioned to avoid any accidental viewing of the film. Projectionists are to be rotated every showing. (see Incident Report 1605-A)

**Description:** SCP-1605 is a black and white short film in the Surrealist style entitled “Appeler Une Croix” (Termed A Cross). The film is currently 13 minutes in length, and can be shown on a standard 35 mm projector. The film is has proven difficult to date precisely, although its use of nitrocellulose as a film base likely puts its production before 1950. The physical film displays no unusual characteristics other than a lack of degradation common to nitrate films. The film alleges to be by Marcel Sabourin and gives its copyright date as “circa quartam” (around four o’clock).

When watched in its entirety by a sapient being capable of processing audio-visual stimuli, the viewer (hereafter, "the subject") disappears and their likeness appears in the film. Their likeness initially proceeds to behave in a manner consistent with the subject’s past actions and is fully capable of interacting with characters and objects within the film. Testing has yet to confirm any upper limit on the number of subjects that can be absorbed by the film at a single time. With each subject absorbed, the film increases by an average of three seconds. It is theorized that, given the average increase and the number of subject names between 6:48 and 7:05, the original film was approximately six minutes long. The additonal film is visually and chemically indistinguishable from earlier scenes.

**Addendum:** //Playthroughs of the film vary slightly depending on the actions taken by the subjects, but all appear to follow the same sequence.// -Dr. ███████
>             **0:00-0:37** Several shots of a pie covered in ants. Opening credits. The only credited actors are the test subjects, listed in order of height.
>             **0:37-1:47** Shot of a party. All attendees are lying on the floor, drinking champagne. It is at this point that test subjects tend to make their initial appearance.
>             **1:47-2:26** Scene shifts to an operating table. The operation is gradually revealed to be the replacement of the hands with oversized lobster claws by several faceless surgeons. (//Note: approximately 25% of the time, the subject will be undergoing the operation.//)
>              **2:27-3:59** A couple argue while repeatedly putting on and removing their clothing in the middle of a road.
>              **4:00-5:26** A room of men in judge's robes writhing and clutching throats.
>              **5:27-6:47** Single shot of a woman from the neck down, performing a striptease. When the chest is uncovered, two large holes, filled with centipedes, are revealed in place of her breasts.
>              **6:48-7:05** Intertitle stating "Scène Supprimée Par Ordre De" (Scene Removed By Order Of). The names of the subjects in the film are then listed.
>              **7:06-8:42** A horse and rider are chased through town by a cabbage-carrying mob. 
>              **8:43-9:27** Mob members drop cabbages and begin waltzing with one another.
>              **9:28-10:44** Crowd disperses as bulls covered in carpets charge through the streets.
>              **10:45-11:50** Several amputees attempt to disinter a body.
>              **11:51-12:36** A large banquet with sand in place of food. Attendees readily devour the sand.
>              **12:36-13:05** Intertitle stating "Soyez Gentil Avec Votre Escabeau" (Be Kind To Your Step Ladder)

**Incident Report 1605-A**
On ██/██/19██, Dr. ████████, a Level Two technician, disappeared while operating the projector for a showing of SCP-1605. He was later found to have been absorbed by the film. Dr. ████████ had previously worked as a projectionist for SCP-1605 on numerous occasions. It is theorized that by glancing at the film during his work with it, he had accidentally viewed it in its entirety. Henceforth, it was decided that SCP-1605 would not be shown by the same individual more than once.
