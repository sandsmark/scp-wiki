title:SCP-1605
**Item #:** SCP-1605

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1605 is to be kept in a standard metal film canister in a locked, dry room at Storage Facility ██. Access is to be provided only upon written request to Dr. Rutkowski. Screenings of 1605 for purposes unrelated to testing are forbidden.

**Description:** SCP-1605 is a black and white short film in the Surrealist style entitled “Appeler Une Croix” (Termed A Cross). The film is 13 minutes in length, and can be shown on a standard 35 mm projector. The film is has proven difficult to date precisely, although its use of nitrocellulose as a film base likely puts its production before 1950. The physical film displays no unusual characteristics other than a lack of degradation common to nitrate films. The film alleges to be by Marcel Sabourin and gives its copyright date as “circa quartam” (around four o’clock). Stylistic analysis suggests a similarity to the works of French Surrealist Francis Picaba. 

When viewed in its entirety by a sentient being capable of processing audio-visual stimuli, the subject disappears and their likeness appears in the film. Their likeness proceeds to behave in a manner consistent with the subject’s past actions and is fully capable of interacting with characters and objects within the film. Subjects in the film do not display any awareness of their predicament. With the next viewing and “absorption” of the film, the previous subjects are “overwritten,” with all traces of vanishing from the film. This effect is limited to the film itself, and recordings of the film have displayed no anomalous properties.
