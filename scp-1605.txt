**Item #:** SCP-1605

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1605 is to be kept in a standard metal film canister in a locked, dry room at Storage Facility ██. Access is to be provided only upon written request to senior site staff. Screenings of SCP-1605 for purposes unrelated to testing are forbidden.

**Description:** SCP-1605 is a black and white short film entitled “Appeler Une Croix” (Calling A Cross). The film is currently seventeen minutes in length, and can be shown on a standard 35 mm projector. It has proven difficult to date precisely, although its use of nitrocellulose as a film base likely puts its production before 1950. The physical film displays no unusual characteristics other than a lack of degradation common to nitrate films. Recordings of the film display no anomalous properties.

When viewed in its entirety by a sapient being capable of processing visual stimuli, the viewer (hereafter "the subject") disappears, with their likeness appearing in the next playthrough. While "in" the film, the subject is fully capable of interacting with objects and actors. The scenes and contexts in which the subject appears appear to be random. Testing has yet to confirm any upper limit on the number of subjects that can be absorbed by the film at a single time. With each subject absorbed, the film increases by an average of three seconds. It is theorized that, given the average increase and the number of subject names between 6:48 and 7:05, the original film was approximately six minutes long. The additional film is stylistically and chemically indistinguishable from earlier scenes.

**Addendum:** //Playthroughs of the film vary slightly depending on the actions taken by the subjects, but all appear to follow the same sequence.// -Dr. ███████

>		**13:06-13:38** A individual wearing a pig mask attempts to descend from the top of a tree while two individuals in business suits with gas masks chop the tree down.
>		**13:39-14:19** A female, whose face is never displayed, in a bellhop's uniform, carves meat from the body of what appears to be a bound human.
>		**14:20-15:16** A room of men in judge's robes writhing and clutching throats.
>              **15:17-16:27** An individual of indeterminate gender destroys a pocket watch and uses glass shards to amputate right index finger. From the amputated finger, a duplicate of the individual slowly grows.
