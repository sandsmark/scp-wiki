**Item #:** SCP-1605

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1605 is to be kept in a standard metal film canister in a locked, dry room at Storage Facility ██. Access is to be provided only upon written request to senior site staff. Screenings of 1605 for purposes unrelated to testing are forbidden.

**Description:** SCP-1605 is a black and white short film in the Surrealist style entitled “Appeler Une Croix” (Termed A Cross). The film is 13 minutes in length, and can be shown on a standard 35 mm projector. The film is has proven difficult to date precisely, although its use of nitrocellulose as a film base likely puts its production before 1950. The physical film displays no unusual characteristics other than a lack of degradation common to nitrate films. The film alleges to be by Marcel Sabourin and gives its copyright date as “circa quartam” (around four o’clock). Stylistic analysis suggests a similarity to the works of French Surrealist Francis Picaba. 

When watchedthe whole way through by a sentient being capable of processing audio-visual stimuli, the viewer (hereafter, "the subject") disappears and their likeness appears in the film. Their likeness proceeds to behave in a manner consistent with the subject’s past actions and is fully capable of interacting with characters and objects within the film. Subjects do not display any awareness of their predicament. With the next viewing and “absorption” of the film, the previous subjects are “overwritten,” with all traces of vanishing from the film. In addition, if any test subject is apparently killed in course of the film, they do not appear in subsequent playthroughs. This effect is limited to the film itself, and recordings of the film have displayed no anomalous properties.

**Addendum:** //Playthroughs of the film vary slightly depending on the actions taken by the subjects, but all appear to follow the same sequence. -Dr. ████████//
>             **0:00-0:37** Several shots of a pie covered in ants. Opening credits. The only credited actors are the test subjects, listed in order of height.
>             **0:37-1:47** Shot of a party. All attendees are lying on the floor, drinking champagne. It is at this point that test subjects tend to make their initial appearance.
>             **1:47-2:26** Scene shifts to an operating table. The operation is gradually revealed to be the replacement of the hands with oversized lobster claws. (//Note: approximately 25% of the time, the test subject will be undergoing the operation.//)
>              **2:27-3:59** A couple argue while repeatedly putting on and removing their clothing in the middle of a road.
>              **4:00-5:26** A room of men in judge's robes writhe in pain.
