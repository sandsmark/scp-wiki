**Author’s Comments:**
[[collapsible show="+ SCP-4765: A Shattered Visage Lies" hide="- SCP-4765"]]
My first SCP which is on the site. I’m slightly surprised at the response it got, as I’ve seen skips of similar quality remain below +10 or get deleted. Anyway, it’s about a broken mirror and a doctor (sort of 2 doctors) having their lives ruined by its effects. Some of it is shown in journal entries, however a lot of it is shown in the way that the actual file is written and the change in writing style, which I’m sort of proud about.

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-4593: Clevair" hide="- SCP-4593"]]
My second SCP on the site. It’s about gas that makes people more intelligent. However, it is discovered that it kills the person who breathes it after two years, unless they can get more of the gas. This focuses, again, on one doctor (seeing a pattern?) and their struggle with addiction, mortality and sanity.

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-4389-J: Can the Foundation do THIS?" hide="- SCP-4389-J"]]
My first -J skip, and my most successful article as of now. I’m not giving away anything specific, but I can warn you that it’s a terrible joke and you’ll probably feel angry at the end[[footnote]]But looking at the response to it, apparently good angry? I don’t know.[[/footnote]]. Anyway, I’m really surprised this stayed up, as I wrote it early one morning and was told to post it semi-jokingly by #site19 on IRC.

[[collapsible show="+ Author Page" hide="- Author Page"]]
Do people actually do comments for author pages? Oh well, I’m doing them. This author page was made completely because I wanted to. There was absolutely no other reason, not even one involving people eligible for a page without one being bullied on IRC chat. Anyway, imagining a theoretical situation where that //did// happen, it wouldn’t any more.

[[collapsible show="+ Mister Nobody" hide="- Mister Nobody"]]
This is my first tale, and is another high-quality shitpost/joke. Again, I’m not going into any detail here because it ruins the tale, but I will say that it is a take on the character of Nobody that I have not seen in any other page on the site. Thanks to #site19 for helping with the concept.
