[[/div]]

**Item #:** SCP-1180 

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** A security camera has been mounted near the site of SCP-1180's transplantation; footage should be reviewed for changes on a regular basis. D-Class subjects assigned as caretakers are required to wear hardhats when working in close proximity to SCP-1180. 

**Description:** To all appearances, SCP-1180 is identical to //Cocos nucifera//, the coconut palm. This particular specimen was found growing in relative isolation on a strip of shore, less than ten miles from the outer perimeter of Research Sector-09. A research team was dispatched to investigate rumors of a palm tree with a "bad disposition", that was reported to drop its sizable drupes on the heads of unsuspecting persons.   

> **Excerpt from Recovery Log** The research team, equipped with suitable headgear, met with no accidents while examining the organism. However, a subdued rattling-- which some described as the sound of "knocking", was heard coming from inside the already-ripening coconuts. Several days of observation yielded similar results, and the decision was made to transplant the palm to Sector-09 grounds for further tests. The transplant was accomplished without any unusual mishaps; however, when the root ball was first uncovered, the roots were found to be densely packed with worms.

SCP-1180 appears to grow and fruit at the same rate as a comparable specimen of //Cocos nucifera//, with the characteristic rattling noises growing in volume as the drupes reach maturity. Radiography results are nearly identical to those from tests performed on normal coconuts. However, repeated tests suggest that the organism is equipped with an unusual self-preservation mechanism: while the tree itself is vulnerable to damage, subjects instructed to open or damage its "offspring" experience significant emotional distress. 

**from Experiment Log 8/7-12:00:**
> All subjects, upon being provided with tools and instructed to remove the husk of one "coconut"-- designated SCP-1180-3, are visibly distressed by the knocking sounds from within. Several describe a feeling of horror; a few describe empathetic feelings. During sixth consecutive test, D-3767 (a subject with exceptionally low empathy scores) succeeds in removing the husk; no adverse effects observed.

**14:00**
> Subject, after removing husk, seems reluctant to crack open the shell. The rattling has grown perceivably louder, occasionally slowing almost to a stop, before beginning again with renewed violence. The subject claims to "feel" the vibrations of the knocking, and claims that SCP-1180-3 has a "face". Subject refuses to remain in the same room with the object, and is subdued and removed for observation.

**16:00**
> Other subjects are instructed to photograph and describe their reactions to de-husked specimen; all react with similar displays of reluctance and increasing fear. 

> D-8084, another subject with significantly low empathy scores, instructed to crack open the de-husked SCP-1180-3. Suitable precautions are taken by observing research team. Using a hammer, D-8084 manages to split the object open, cracking it apart into several large pieces. Nothing was found inside, save the slightly-rotted copra.  
    
**Addendum 1:**
New growths have appeared on SCP-1180, apparently in place of those removed for testing.

**Addendum 2:** 
On 8/8/██, shortly before dawn, D-8084's body was discovered standing rigidly upright in the center his cell. The corpse was cleanly decapitated. The head has not yet been recovered.    

**Addendum 3:**   
The largest instance of the new growths, designated SCP-1180-8, now measures 110mm in diameter. Several caretakers have claimed to hear a faint rattling from inside the husk.
