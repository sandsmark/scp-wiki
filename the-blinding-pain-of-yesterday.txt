"It's twenty-two hundred. Quiet d-" Officer Rance Roberts is interrupted mid-sentence by his coworker. He turns around, scowling. "What? Are the clocks off again?"

The man in front of him is Joy. Joy Rice. Rance always found that name peculiar, especially for a 250-pound prison guard who hadn't smiled in at least four days. Hell, the man had always had this characteristic facial expression insinuating he didn't even //feel// joy, so to have it as a legal first name was always even more perplexing.

"No, the clocks aren't off," Joy says quietly, leading Rance out of the hall doorway and back into the security office. "You're just not doing that anymore, //remember?"//

Rance bites his tongue. "Last I checked, I had two weeks left."

"That's a courtesy, to allow you to transfer sites and get rehired if you want. You're effectively on probation."

"...What? Why didn't anyone tell me that means I can't do anything?"

Joy sighs and takes Rance by the arm, guiding him over to the lesser-used end of the security feed desk. "You can still monitor the feeds as normal. Just don't interact with the D-classes."

Rance feels his pulse quickening with frustration. "Do you guys realize that you never actually told me why you fired me? Or why I'm being treated like-"

"Shh, shh. We already gave you your report, Roberts; you know that."

"'Take some time to yourself due to emotional stress factors', was it?" he hisses, lowing his voice and leaning toward the younger man. "Joy, I don't want to be unprofessional with you as my supervisor, but you can't fire someone because their life got a little worse in a few places! I'm pretty sure that's not even within the rules!"

Joy's eyes narrow. "Roberts, so help me God, you //know// I am on your side in this," he says, barely audibly. "The demotion is what it is. And you're not fucking //fired,// so stop over-dramatizing. We told you multiple times -- and it was clear in your paperwork, or so I thought -- that this isn't a punishment. You need some time to get your head together, get your finances together, get yourself feeling better."

Rance puts his head in his hands and sniffs, clearing his throat. "Alright, look."

"Put your hands down. Don't get stressed."

"Then don't condescend me." His mouth forms a straight line as he inhales sharply. "Just listen to me. I am going to be completely blunt with you in that I think last month's false allegations are affecting the other staff's reasoning in this."

"Oh for fuck's sake, Roberts. Don't do this to yourself."

"How about you don't do it to //me?"// he snaps. "I have all the fucking counter-evidence, which the Ethics Committee so helpfully neglected to even //read// until //twenty days// after they became aware of the case. I've got someone running around the entire site telling people I'm a rapist with no evidence except one mouthy D-class blatantly lying, and you fucks respond by demoting me for 'health reasons'? Do you think I'm a fucking idiot? Do you think I can't put two and two together? You're getting rid of me because it's the fucking //easy option!"//

"Lower your voice immediately, unless you want to clock out early and hand me your badge."

Rance pauses and grits his teeth. "Very well," he mutters after several seconds.

Joy leans forward. "Seriously, Rance, go home. I know you're better than this. Come back tomorrow, finish your two weeks, and then move to another site and move on."

"Joy, I don't want to go home. I want to feel stable again. I want my job back. I never did any of those things."

"That's not why you were laid off, and if you won't believe me on that, then I don't know what to tell you."

"Fine. Yeah, yeah, I get it."

"Now get out of here for the night. Sleep on a normal person's schedule for once."

Rance nods. "Alright, alright. I'm going." He stands up and unclips his access card from his shirt collar. "So... you need this?" He knows his tone sounded hostile. He doesn't care.

"No. Get out. Go vent to your girlfriend."

"Oh, that's a professional thing to add," he spits. He slams the door behind him, leaving Joy no time to retort.

**22:05 | Adam Leeward**
Hey Rance. Are you off yet?
[[/<]]

[[>]]
**Rance Roberts | 22:05**
just left, shit day. how was yours
[[/>]]

[[<]]
**22:05 | Adam Leeward**
Decent I guess. You got any special plans for the night?
[[/<]]

[[>]]
**Rance Roberts | 22:06**
i really don't
i still feel like shit about last month
i think they fired me for it actually
[[/>]]

[[<]]
**22:06 | Adam Leeward**
It's unlikely. I know slander hurts, but they knew all the evidence was on your side.
[[/<]]

[[>]]
**Rance Roberts | 22:06**
i wish I could believe that. but I just can't.
They told me they're laying me off because of 'health reasons'
HEALTH REASONS
I mean my dysphoria may be bad lately but it's not that bad
not bad enough to fire me for
I mean I only started T like... what... a month ago?
I cant remember
it was when they agreed to switch me from the female cell block duty to the male.
[[/>]]

[[<]]
**22:06 | Adam Leeward**
Hold up. They didn't fire you because you're trans.
Don't convince yourself of that, for your own sake.
You know they're all super understanding of that
the Foundation's medicine is too advanced to //not// understand it, lol.
You're safe here.
[[/<]]

[[>]]
**Rance Roberts | 22:07**
Well I feel like it's likely
it's either they can't handle a trans dude on the male cell block or they believe Gailey's rape allegations
[[/>]]

[[<]]
**22:07 | Adam Leeward**
Gailey isn't there anymore. She transferred after the rest of the staff found out she was exaggerating, remember? Your case was closed in your favor. Don't do this to yourself, please.
I don't like seeing you like this. I'm at 81 right now but I will gladly fly there if you need me nafew weeks.
*in a few weeks
[[/<]]

[[>]]
**Rance Roberts | 22:07**
Fuck man. I don't know.
And Gailey shuold have b een FIRED
they gave her a fucking easy way out.
and no, i odn't want you to have to do that
[[/>]]

[[<]]
**22:08 | Adam Leeward**
I don't have to do anything. I just want to help you out if you need me.
[[/<]]

[[>]]
**Rance Roberts | 22:08**
Well supposedly I have a girlfriend that cares 
supposedly
[[/>]]

[[>]]
**Rance Roberts | 22:10**
I'm not trying to be negative, I just feel like shit
[[/>]]

[[>]]
**Rance Roberts | 22:12**
are you still there
[[/>]]

[[>]]
**Rance Roberts | 22:15**
i don't wanna pester you i just dont have anyone else to talk to and she never stays the night anymore. i'm just really lonely and it's affecting my mood. i'm sorry
[[/>]]

[[<]]
**22:15 | Adam Leeward**
Fuck, sorry. I'm still at work.
Skip needs attention.
[[/<]]

[[>]]
**Rance Roberts | 22:15**
they always do
[[/>]]

[[<]]
**22:16 | Adam Leeward**
I can call you when I'm done here, if you want.
Shouldn't be more than a few more mins
[[/<]]

[[>]]
**Rance Roberts | 22:16**
Alright
if I don't answer it's just because Jane's over for once
hopefully/not-hopefully
[[/>]]

[[>]]
**Rance Roberts | 22:17**
are you sure you'd want to visit me?
i mean
like
you haven't seen me since before I transitioned.
[[/>]]

[[<]]
**22:17 | Adam Leeward**
I don't know why that would affect anything(?)
[[/<]]

[[>]]
**Rance Roberts | 22:17**
I mean
this is awkward
I know we had a thing going for a while.
[[/>]]

[[<]]
**22:17 | Adam Leeward**
oh omg
Yes, we did, and I still like you
I'm not visiting you just to fuck you
[[/<]]

[[<]]
**22:18 | Adam Leeward**
I mean unless you want that.
i mean i'm bi anyway so no it's not some sort of problem 
...Yes, this is awkward. lol
you pass really well. Please don't feel bad about yourself
[[/<]]

[[>]]
**Rance Roberts | 22:18**
JUST
lmao
and no it's
it's awkward because I made it awkward.
fuuuuuck
my libido is at 0.00% anyway
i thought T was supposed to increase libido but I hate the way I look so much that i just
can't
like get turned on
ever
i hate it
no wonder Jane's not into me anymore
[[/>]]

[[>]]
**Rance Roberts | 22:18**
I just want to forget.
I think if i could forget, I would feel normal.
I worry too much and if I could forget things I wish I didn't know, I'd be alright.
Like that case last month.
If I could forget I knew the counterevidence, I would feel okay.
I wouldn't think about it all the time
I would feel like they demoted me for stupid reasons but i would be able to move on.
you know?
[[/>]]

[[<]]
**22:19 | Adam Leeward**
Yes.
[[/<]]

[[>]]
**Rance Roberts | 22:19**
So like
yeah.
I'm gonna head on in my room (I've been pacing the hallway, haha) and see if Jane is there and if she's not I might just go over to the old office.
[[/>]]

[[<]]
**22:20 | Adam Leeward**
Wait why would you go to the office
[[/<]]

[[>]]
**Rance Roberts | 22:20**
night dude. thank you for talking to me
[[/>]]

[[<]]
**22:20 | Adam Leeward**
why would you go to the office
you're worrying me I'm sorry
I thought you said you didn't still have access to that computer? What's in there?
[[/<]]

[[<]]
**22:28 | Adam Leeward**
Rance?
[[/<]]

[[<]]
**22:42 | Adam Leeward**
I hope for your sake that you fell asleep. Call me in the morning if you need. I don't clock in until 10 tomorrow.
