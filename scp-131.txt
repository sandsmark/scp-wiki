**Item #:** SCP-131

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**
No special safety procedures are to be taken with SCP 131-A and SCP-131-B. They are free to travel about the facility so long as they do not attempt to enter any restricted areas or attempt to leave the facility. Casual contact with the SCP's is permitted, but it is recommended that such contact be kept to a minimum to prevent the creatures from forming an attachment on personnel. Hourly tabs are to be kept on subjects at all times; failure to account for their presence at these times constitutes a level one lock down situation. Any report of abuse or mistreatment of the subjects will result in harsh reprimanding. 


**Description:**
SCP 131-A and SCP 131-B (affectionately nick named the "Eye Pods" by personnel) are a pair of tear drop shaped creatures roughly 0.3m (1ft) in height, with a single blue eye in the middle of their bodies. SCP 131-A is burnt orange in color while 131-B is mustard yellow. At the base of each creature is a wheel like protrusion which allows for locomotion, suggesting that the creatures may be biomechanical in origin. The subjects can move surprisingly fast, covering over 60.96m (200ft) in a manner of seconds, the subjects lack a breaking system however, which has led to some rather spectacular, if not overly amusing, mishaps involving the creatures. The subjects have also shown the ability to climb sheer surfaces, and have gotten lost in the air vents on more than one occasion.

The subjects seem to have the intelligence of common house cats and are insatiably curious; most of the time they simply roll around the facility, observing the personnel at work and catching peeks at other safe class SPC. The subjects seem to be able to communicate with one another via a high pitched babbling which has thus far proven untranslatable. The Subjects have never been observed blinking, even in laboratories when the subjects have been videotaped for over 18 consecutive hours. 

The subjects seem to respond well to any affection given to them and will quickly bond to anyone giving them such affection, much in the same way a puppy bonds with a human being. They will follow anyone or anything they've made a bond with anywhere, even into normally restricted areas. Although curious, the subjects can sense danger in their general vicinity, and if the person or thing they've bonded with begins to approach something they register as being dangerous (Such as an Euclid or Keter class object) they will swarm around their bonded companions feet (or appropriate extremities) while babbling in a panicked tone, as if to warn them. Because of the daily dangers faced by site 19 staff in dealing with Euclid and Keter class objects, it is recommended that staff avoid making attempts to bond with the subjects, as it can pose a distraction during delicate operations and experiments and may pose a danger to the subjects themselves (See Addendum 131-1). If the subjects are ignored by their bonded target long enough, they will eventually lose interest and return to their normal activities. 

It should be noted that the subjects require no real care or maintenance from the site staff: They do not eat, leave droppings, or even sleep. It would seem that the only sustenance they require is visual stimulation (although this requires further study to verify). 

Subjects SCP 131-A and SCP 131-B were found in a cornfield outside ████████████ in the year 19██. They were promptly transported to Area 19 via [DATA EXPUNGED] and were then downgraded to safe class and given free reign across the site once it became clear they were not broadcasting what they saw to any hostile foreign powers. 

**Addendum 131-1:** during an incident that took place on the date ██/██/████, the subjects followed one of the cleaning staff on a routine cleaning of the container of [[[SCP-173]]] was followed by the subjects (who had recently bonded to him). After their normal attempts to warn the cleaner of the danger were ignored, the creatures actually rushed into the container in front of him and the other two personnel on duty. Once inside, the staff members observed the subjects sitting in front of SCP-173 and watching it intently, as if they were aware that it could only move if unobserved. The cleaners ignored the presence of the subjects and continued with the bi-weekly cleaning as per standard procedures. When the cleaning crew left, the subjects did as well, rolling backwards slowly and never taking their eyes off of SCP-173. Current applications of SCP's 131-A and 131-B as "wardens" for SCP-173 (and perhaps other SCP which require constant observation, such as [[[SCP-689]]]) are being considered.
