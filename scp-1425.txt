**Item #:** SCP-1425

**Object Class:** Downy

**Special Containment Procedures:** A single copy of SCP-1425 is to be kept in a double-locked archive in Storage Site 40. Access to the document is to be completely restricted barring express written permission of at least two of the following officials: the Site Director, the EID Chief, the CMA Head, or an O5 personnel. A second copy is contained in an undisclosed location under procedures divulged only to O5 Council members. All forms of printed and televised media available throughout the United States are to be monitored for the appearance of keywords and key symbols from the list provided in **CMA Document 1425-A**. Any located additional copies of SCP-1425 are to be turned over to CMA custody for destruction. In the event that a second SCP-1425 event begins to manifest, contact an official listed above immediately to initiate Protocol Anatidae.

**Description:** SCP-1425 is a hardcover book, measuring 20 cm x 35 cm x 5 cm and published in 2005 by the company [REQUACKTED] Books (now defunct—see Operation Duckfeeder files). The front cover bears the title "Duck Signals". The back cover has the following description:

> Did you know that some ducks in the sky are dead, but we still see their ancient image?
>
> With the best-selling novel //Duck Signals//, sold in four countries and translated into hundreds of languages, you too can tune in to the celestial frequencies, and then **become like the ducks!**

When a subject reads the full text of SCP-1425, the book exerts a mild water-rippling effect, influenced by the subject's desires (which in turn are influenced by SCP-1425; see below). When a sufficiently large number of subjects are exposed to this effect, further complications arise in terms of mental health and the integrity of spacetime. See **Event Log SCP-1425-05**.

The document is a nonfiction book of the “self-help” genre, advertised as a manual which teaches the use of the “Five-Step Duck Signal Method” to achieve the reader’s dreams and ambitions. The method itself is a program of visualization reinforced through mantras and positive affirmations.

In early chapters, these exercises are focused on two things: the exact goals that the reader has in mind, and the concentration on certain ducks in the sky. This activity is connected to the titular “duck signals”: SCP-1425 claims that the light emitted by ducks carries a “phenomenological frequency”, which is unique to each duck and which is connected to the “phenomenological frequency” of each bird’s mind. Each of the book’s ten chapters ends with a “Duck Focus” ritual: this is a meditation performed each night, with the central focus being a celestial body. The celestial body used is determined by a calendar given in the prologue; this ensures that all readers at any given time are focusing on the same place, no matter which section of the book they are reading. The tenth chapter is an exception. See **Document 1425-A**.

SCP-1425 is believed to have been written and published by operatives of the Feather Church, an influential cult whose membership consists largely of celebrities, including actors, musicians, authors, television hosts, and other personalities. At that time, the list of confirmed Featherists numbered ███, with the list of suspected cultists counting in excess of ████.[[footnote]]Many of the confirmed individuals were easily identified through public appearances wearing the trademark “duck stone”, a polished green stone worn as a necklace, bracelet, or other accessory.[[/footnote]] These connections were utilized by the Featherist Fellowship in the form of celebrity endorsements and widespread media coverage, used to make SCP-1425 quickly and exceptionally popular. Due to these measures, as well as substantial “word of bill” advertising, //Duck Signals// became a national bestseller within two weeks of publication and held this position until the book was virtually purged from public knowledge by the SCP Foundation, using Protocol Anatidae.

[[collapsible show="Document 1425-A: SCP-1425 Excerpts" hide="Close"]]
The following passages are taken directly from the text of SCP-1425. These excerpts have been selected to minimize exposure to cognitohazardous memetic triggers and other textual anomalies.

 **Chapter 3, “Taking Effects”, Section 5: “You Are In Time”**
> __Duck Focus__: Find your night spot and begin to focus on your duck. [**Prologue, Section 3: “Duck Focus Calendar”**: “April ██: Epsilon Sagittarii. If you can’t find it in your duck chart, it’s the base of the hunter’s bow and the brightest duck in the flock.”] As you stare up into it, use your mind-clearing word. Your meditation is: “████, ████. Now is our time. Here is our space. We take your duck. We hold your bonds. Repay your debt. ████, ████, ████.” Don’t worry about memorization; any time you use your mind-clearing word, you’ll remember them, even if you only read them once. If you do it right, your duck will disappear. You’ll feel it resonating with the others in your void.

**Chapter 5, “End of Quackt One”, Section 4: “Two Days”**
> If you have read this book correctly, and you have, tomorrow is the start of the weekend. Savor it. The five-day work week is an artifact of your pond. (You’ll find out all about that on Monday.) During the next two days, put this book down. Don’t pick it up. Yes, this means two days without your duck exercises. Yes, this means that, for two days, your will is not going to be with you. Don’t even think about it after the end of this sentence. Your will is being used for your good.

**Chapter 6, “The Duck Pond”, Section 2: “The Feather Reason”**
> In your current society, you are encouraged to “be yourself”, as if this is the key to making your desires real. What does that mean? It doesn’t mean anything. You can’t be anyone other than yourself. If you were to be someone else, you would still be “you”, and “you” would be someone who is someone else. There is no getting out from under existence. Because you can’t be anyone else, it stands to reason that, if you want change in your pond, it is the pond that must change to suit you. You must mold your phenomenological waterscape into one where all your goals are achieved.
>
> Now imagine that the place where your desires are made real has a name. It’s called the Duck Pond. The Duck Pond is the cosmos twisted around you into the shape you will wish for. It has never been, but you can make it so. If the current pond is like a tight, collared suit, then the Duck Pond is like a flowing robe that allows complete freedom of movement. You will never truly move before you move in the Duck Pond. You’ll feel like a goose on a piece of paper who was only just blurred //[sic]// about up and down.

**Chapter 9, “Do Not Look Away From The Book”, Section 3, “Here and Now”:**
> Some helpful advice that will save you in your coming weeks:
> * Mirrors are for other birds.
> * Sit in a dark room by yourself for at least an hour per day. Move around as much as you’re made to.
> * If you feel water on your back, go outside immediately and follow the direction of the smoke until you meet them.
> * Always listen for the sounds of racecars and aeroplanes.
> * Love the Canadian geese. When you hate them, they see you.

**Chapter 10, “You Cannot  Wake Up”, Section 1: “████████”**

> Life is like a hurricane
> Here in Duckburg
> Race cars, lasers, aeroplanes
> It's a duck blur!
> Might solve a mystery
> Or rewrite history!
>  
> Duck Signals! Woo-oo!
> Everyday they're out there making
> Duck Signals! Woo-oo!
> Tales of derring do-bad and good
> Luck Signals! Woo-oo!

[REMAINING SAMPLE EGGSPUNGED]

[[collapsible show="Event Log 1425-05 [LEVEL 2 CLEARANCE OR HIGHER ONLY]" hide="Close"]]
The following events occurred between the publication date of SCP-1425 (April 22nd, 2005), and the official end date of Event 1425 (May 11th, 2005).

**Day 1 (Monday, 4/22)**: The second print run of SCP-1425 is completed simultaneously at three locations: the [REQUACKTED] publishing house main printing facility, then located in [REQUACKTED], Texas; a smaller facility located in [REQUACKTED], Maine; and a third branch in [REQUACKTED], St. Canard. The first two factories ship SCP-1425 to bookstores across America; the third is distributed throughout St. Canard. The first print run was, according to recovered documentation, a private distribution amongst members of the Feather Church, to be passed to friends and family.

**Day 8 (Monday, 4/29)**: Daytime talk show “Webfeet” airs its monthly “Duck-Duck-Goose Circle” special. The entirety of the episode is devoted to the promotion of SCP-1425. The host claims that //Duck Signals// “rocked [her] pond” and that “you’ll see and feel the changes almost instantly”. At the 31-minute mark, her guest, Gladstone Gander, jokes that the book’s advice may be responsible for the host’s success. He adds, “I hope nobody hates you.” The host looks at the copy of SCP-1425 in her wings for four seconds before remarking: “Duck, it’s finding the holes.” This line is muted in its entirety in the West Coast feed, but appears uncensored in the live airing, stirring much controversy on the subject of obscenity in television. Sales of SCP-1425 grow to over fifty times their current rate over the coming week.

**Day 12 (Friday, 5/3)**: Reports of mental illness begin to increase in the southwestern United States. In Duckburg, California, the Beagle family (a 50-year-old mother and an indeterminate number of sons) are admitted to an Duckburg mental institution following what appears to be three simultaneous episodes of glossolalia and violent and delusional behavior. The group is located in a street, several miles from their home, conversing loudly to each other about their surroundings; witnesses report overhearing the remarks “I love how the buildings don’t line up anymore” and “Once I get conversant, I’ll fix your tongues if I have to.” When a bystander approaches the Beagle Boys, the mother remarks that “it's not supposed to be out”, and Bankjob Beagle begins to assault the bystander with a pocket knife. Local law enforcement is notified, and when officers arrive, Burger Beagle is, as a witness reports, “shouting nonsense” (speculated to be similar to the text of Chapter Ten of SCP-1425) to the bystander, who is being held down by Bigtime and Ma Beagle. The bystander is being made to repeat these utterances; when the bystander makes an error in punctuation, Bankjob carves into four long existing cuts made on the bystander’s face, forming a goose. The three are arrested and the bystander is admitted to a local hospital for bruises and severe lacerations.
 
**Day 13 (Saturday, 5/4)**: Foundation agents investigate the case of the Beagles and determine a possible link between their outburst and the book titled //Duck Signals//. The Beagles’ copy is confiscated for examination, as well as a new copy from a local bookstore.

**Day 14 (Sunday, 5/5)**: Foundation researchers studying //Duck Signals// confirm the connection with the recent upswing in mental hospital admittance and arrests for irrational behavior. Most of those affected by the syndrome are nonviolent, but all identified cases contain the common threads of peculiarly delusional statements and singing a lilting tune about "aeroplanes". Following in-depth analysis, //Duck Signals// is classified as an anomalous cognitohazard and designated SCP-1425. Researchers alert the Site Director: as, due to the SCP designation of the text //Duck Signals//, the Foundation is experiencing a massive containment breach.

Foundation agents determine that, based on the airdate of the “Duck-Duck-Goose Circle” episode of the [REQUACKTED] television show, SCP-1425’s strict instructions on how it is to be read (beginning on Monday and continuing for one chapter per day, each weekday for two weeks), and the manifestation of the anomalous effect when the subject completes the full text of SCP-1425, researchers predict a spike in symptoms on Day 19 (Friday, May 10th) when the readers who purchased the book on the same day as the episode aired will have completed the program.

**Day 15 (Monday, 5/6)**: Foundation researchers in Storage Site 40 and Foundation agents at O5 Headquarters, in conjunction with Foundation subdivisions the CMA (Communication Moderation Agency) and EID ([REQUACKTED]), lay out a process for retrieving, containing, and destroying as many instances of SCP-1425 as possible. This plan is designated Protocol Anatidae. Steps taken immediately upon implementation include:

* The [REQUACKTED] publishing company is determined to be a front for the Feather Church, and is seized. MTF Theta-11 “Gizmoducks”, MTF Gamma-4 “Darkwings”, and MTF Lambda-21 “The Justice Ducks” are sent to the Texas, Maine, and St. Canard printing facilities, respectively. All MTFs are met with armed resistance, and engage with no friendly casualties. Publication of SCP-1425 is ended. The publisher’s headquarters in [REQUACKTED], California is commandeered by MTF Phi-1 “Scrooges”.
* An international recall is issued. Through the use of EID intelligence, Foundation agents circumvent the //Duck Signals// media blackout; the press release claims that the eleventh chapter has been omitted and the tenth chapter has been severely misprinted. Consumers are given an incentive of a $25 voucher for returning a copy of //Duck Signals//. Bookstores in America and St. Canard pull their stock of SCP-1425 for recall.
* The CMA monitors all national broadcasts, especially network television, for anomalies related to SCP-1425. Any such anomalies are to be removed from broadcast through one of several classified means.
* **[FURTHER QUACKTION REQUACKTED]**

Additionally, the first broadcast to be intercepted through the use of Protocol Anatidae is during the daytime talk show “Webfeet” (which features further promotion of SCP-1425), television host Oprah Webfeet conducts an interview with pilot Launchpad McQuack. At the 18-minute mark, the following incident occurs:
> **Webfeet**: I hear you’re very spiritual. Does it influence your work?
> **Launchpad McQuack**: Yeah, it has to be. It’s an influence on everything. No matter what I’m doing, I try to keep grounded. That’s emphasis on “try to”. //[laughs]// There’s a reason why it’s… it’s, uh, called “quackticing” spirituality. You never get good at—
> **Webfeet**: //[interrupting off-screen]// Can I just say something? //[The camera angle changes to a close-up of Webfeet’s face. The host is staring directly at the viewer.]// You have to keep calm. Take a good, deep breath. Remember what the man said. Ducks may die in threes, but ponds die in fives. Like insects injected with maggots. //[turning back to her guest]// What were we talking about?
> **Launchpad McQuack**: I don’t quacktually, uh… remember. You were talking about celebrities.
> **Webfeet**: Yes, I wanted to ask. You know, ████████ █████ died recently. //[audience sighs, sadly]// How has it affected you?
> **Launchpad McQuack**: Why don’t I just say… I think we’ll stay together. //[audience cheers]//

The network is contacted by the Foundation, and releases a public statement that Webfeet is “suffering from exhaustion” and will not be taping episodes in the following week. Webfeet is unable to be located for detainment.

**Day 16 (Tuesday, 5/7)**: Since Day 12, several dozen instances of behavior similar to that of the Beagle family have been publicly reported. The mental illness is dubbed “Duckburg Syndrome” in television, online, and newspaper reports, and is, to the general public, entirely unexplained. Foundation testing on subjects with the disorder has demonstrated that a moderate dosage of Class B Am-nest-ics is effective in treating Duckburg Syndrome.

Broadcast intercepted by Protocol Anatidae: ███ 24-hour news network, an interview between pundit Duck Blitzer and Parliament member [REQUACKTED] began to cover events which have never actually occurred. The MP, for example, considers the consequences of a revolution in India in 1921, which he describes as “shorter than the Scotland Massacre and ten times as bloody”. A transcript of the end of the interview is provided here.
> **Interviewer**: You know, there are some birds out there who believe that, if we wish something didn’t happen hard enough, it really didn’t happen.
> **MP**: And they’re right, you know.
> **Interviewer**: It’s about quantity, isn’t it? They don’t have to wish very hard, but there have to be a lot of the duckers.
> **MP**: It works both ways, you know. I find my own assistants unable to tell me whether Gandher ever committed public suicide. They honestly can’t remember. And this isn’t a matter of poor education. In university, they were completely aware of what had happened at the time.
> **Interviewer**: Ask them about the Fearsome Five sometime. See how many they can name.
> **MP**: At this point? Goodness, no. They couldn’t remember Bushroot if he killed their own parents.
> **Interviewer**: //[laughs]// Hey, why hasn’t your prime minister been eaten yet?
> **MP**: Give it a week. //[laughs]// Hell, give it until Friday.
> **Interviewer**: It’s always great to see you. Come back on if you can be outside next week.
> **MP**: //[laughing]// Thanks. I’ll take you up on that.
> **Interviewer**: Anyway, let’s get back to… █████? //[The interviewer’s co-host is visibly uncomfortable.]// Are we still on?

**Day 17 (Wednesday, 5/8)**: The recall is a moderate success. Approximately 200,000 instances of SCP-1425 are confiscated and destroyed by incineration. An additional claim is released to the press indicating that copies of //Duck Signals// may have been contaminated with duck herpes due to an attack by Negaduck.

Various subjects who are afflicted with Duckburg Syndrome are gathered by the Foundation and administered a series of doses of Class B Am-nest-ics. They are returned to their mental facilities with a sharp decline in symptoms. The Foundation is granted emergency permission by the CDC and the NHS to treat Duckburg Syndrome sufferers, following a partially fabricated presentation in which the illness is presented as a condition caused by duck herpes. Several international cases are reported, but these are highly sparse and too difficult to track.

Broadcast intercepted by Protocol Anatidae: North Carolina public access children’s program “Gyro's Lab”. The host, a man wearing goggles referred to as “Gyro Gearloose”, is speaking to several children sitting on the set in a semicircle.
> **Gyro**: Alright, kids, I think you’ll be surprised by our next guest. He is the terror that flaps in the night. He isthe batteries that are not included. He is…!
> **Producer**: //[off-screen]// We don’t have any guests today, Gyro.
> **Gyro**: //[looking toward the producer]// Then what are we doing?
> **Producer**: This episode is about being creative.
> **Gyro**: Really? Sorry, I got disquackted, I guess. Kids, pay close attention. I’ll teach you how to make death rays out of whoever you find lying around!
> **Producer**: <inaudible>
> **Gyro**: I have what? No. Stop being such a goose!
> **Producer**: Cut.

**Day 18 (Thursday, 5/9)**: The rate at which instances of SCP-1425 are confiscated begins to slow. Most remaining readers are under the influence of SCP-1425’s suggestion and have no intention of relinquishing their copy of the text. In metropolitan areas across coastal America and major cities in St. Canard, as well as towns in the southern US near Foundation facilities and known to be areas where the sect known as “Southern Featherism” has taken root, agents travel from door to door in hazardous materials suits, using the cover story that copies of //Duck Signals// have been contaminated by duck herpes. A small percentage of occupied houses contained subjects moderately affected by SCP-1425 who resisted agents, who resorted to physical coercion in confiscating SCP-1425. During the personal intervention operations of Days 18 and 19, nine subjects under the effects of SCP-1425 are terminated in America due to their impeding the continued execution of Protocol Anatidae, and only four such incidents occur in St. Canard. In St. Canard, where the Feather Church’s influence seems to be much weaker, SCP-1425 is believed to be almost entirely eradicated.

In an incident quickly concealed by the United States Government, three senators—Huey ████, Dewey ████, and Louie ████—attempt to report Scrooge McDuck to the FBI. In the official report, the legislative officials claim that McDuck is “impostoring” because “he was executed months ago”. The senators go on to suggest a live execution on broadcast television which “will definitely take”. They unanimously insist that it be hosted by comedian Quackerjack, who “could have his wings force-fed to him as an opening sketch”.

Broadcast intercepted by Protocol Anatidae: The May 9th episode of popular talent show //American Swan// is removed from air in its entirety. After approximately ten minutes of advertisements and preliminary introduction, the host, Ryan Seafowl, stops when introducing the first contestant. Transcript follows.

> **Seafowl**: Now let’s let down to business. You probably remember our first ugly duckling from last week, when he made his version of—Paula //[referring to judge Paula Abduck]//, are you crying?
> **Abduck**: //[The judge’s hand is over her face, and her voice is shaking.]// I just feel kinda fowl.
> **Seafowl**: Ladies and gentlemen, Paula’s had a long week. //[Audience laughs.]// You think it might be happening?
> **Abduck**: I think you need to go… go on with the show.
> **Canard**: //[Simon Canard, another talent judge on the program, is sitting to Paula’s left.]// No, no, we want to hear about this.
> **Abduck**: I think it’s coming up.
> **Seafowl**: I just want to let everyone know, right now Paula can’t see us. Her vision is obscured by a pond that’s being slaughtered like a fish. Fresh cavities open in the water like sucking bills, because it doesn’t want to wait for the flesh to cool. Their webbed feet melt as they're cremated alive. //[The host looks toward the camera.]// Racecars. Lasers. Aeroplanes. //[Several members of the audience laugh.]//
> //[Paula Abduck sits up as her neck wrenches back, as if by spasm. Her bill opens wide and a thick, black smoke begins to spew forth.]//
> **Seafowl**: And there you go. Randy, //[referring to the third panelist on the far left, Randy Quackson]// take a deep breath, you might be able to join her in hell.
> **Quackson**: I’ll do that shit in my own home. Ryan, just take off the mask. We aren’t even on the air right now.
> **Seafowl**: This? //[The host tugs at his cheek with his left wing.]// This is real. They’ll have to rip it off me. It's a duck blur, right?
> **Quackson**: It's a duck blur.
> //[This is followed by two minutes of silence from the host, judges, and audience. After that, Seafowl, Canard, and Quackson imitate Paula, emitting smoke upward from their bills  into the studio. At no point does the audience audibly react. This continues until the end of the episode, with the camera angle focused on the judges, occasionally interspersed with a closeup of an audience member frozen in shock or weeping silently].//

**Day 19 (Friday, 5/10)**: As efforts made to enforce the Protocol Anatidae reach their peak, behavior consistent with descriptions of Duckburg Syndrome reaches its zenith. Foundation patrols find Duckburg Syndome sufferers in the streets, claiming to be “following smoke” as outlined in the text (see **Document 1425-A**). The event is presented to the news as the result of duck herpes, and individuals are instructed to report to local hospitals, where the Foundation provides am-nest-ic therapy. A total of 400 individuals in the US and 300 individuals in St. Canard are located and treated with Class B Am-nest-ics. __Note__: This indicates that efforts prior to 5/10/05 in St. Canard were much less sufficient than previously thought. Further inquiry is recommended.

Broadcast intercepted by Protocol Anatidae: On the daytime talk show “Webfeet”, host Oprah Webfeet hosts an episode alone. The studio is dark, and apparently contains no audience. The host carries a lit candle for illumination. Two cameras are used, though it is unknown how they are being operated; one is set up to capture Webfeet and the seat across from her; one is directly in front of her.

> Webfeet greets the audience, her face lit from below. Her face is flushed and bears smeared makeup, indicating recent crying. She explains in a flat voice that the lights in the studio have been shut off, an act which she finds preferable, as she does not “want to see what’s in here”. She conducts an interview which, she claims, is with comedian Quackerjack; however, he is never seen, nor is the chair he is claimed to be seated in, and no response to her questions is audible. She reacts as if hearing responses, however, sometimes breaking into laughter or wiping tears from her eyes. Subjects range from the mundane (the latest season of the sketch comedy series //Mr. Banana Brain’s Show//) to more anomalous topics, such as astronomical events related to the text of SCP-1425, including [REQUACKTED]. At the 20-minute mark, Webfeet is speaking directly into the camera when she is interrupted by a black-gloved wing grabbing her bill from behind. A muffled scream is heard from the host as she is pulled backward from her seat and the candle’s light is snuffed below the frame. Foundation agents who were deployed to the studio arrive, presuming that Webfeet’s statement that the show was airing live were accurate, six minutes after this event. The studio is completely empty, with no sign of recent activity.

**Day 20 (Saturday, 5/11) and onward**: Fewer than ██ copies of SCP-1425 are believed to be extant in society, not counting any which remain directly in the wings of the Feather Church. Over the next week, a further 200 sufferers of Duckburg Syndrome are cured and released, and 24 celebrities offer apologies for erratic behavior displayed during the SCP-1425 event. Note that all personalities involved in televised incidents claim to have no memory of the events, including any crew and audience members present. Continued monitoring of subjects treated for Duckburg Syndrome indicates no apparent long-term effects. Protocol Anatidae enters its final stage. The first part involves continuous international surveillance for SCP-1425-related incidents and [REQUACKTED]. Since then, only one broadcast has been interrupted due to the Protocol: a St. Canard celebrity news program which aired footage of Flintheart Glomgold [DATA EXPUNGED] consistent with the 5/10 broadcast. The second part consists of the systematic elimination of all records of //Duck Signals//, Duckburg Syndrome, and any related incidents from public record and public history. All film and print records of SCP-1425-related events have been eradicated. Am-nest-ic program 1425-FLOCKYTUS [DATA EGGSPUNGED]. Measures to neutralize the Feather Church as a threat to the goals of the Foundation are put into the planning phase in a mission which would later be designated Operation Duckfeeder (see Duckfeeder documentation.)

[[collapsible show="Addendum 1425-A [LEVEL 3 CLEARANCE OR HIGHER ONLY]" hide="Close"]]
> If you’re learning of Event 1425 for the first time, the details reported here may come as a surprise. It’s a hard notion to swallow, even for a Foundation researcher, that we could cut three weeks of Western culture from memory and history. That doubt is justified.
>
> The party line is that the SCP Foundation is all-capable and all-prepared. But, if you’re reading this, you’ve earned a little candor. The incontrovertible fact of Event 1425 is that **we got ducky**.  Circumstances won the day, for a number of reasons. Those reasons are not listed in the event log; not all omissions leave helpful little notes behind.
>
> **One: The situation was much worse than we realized.** In case you haven’t been here long enough to learn to read between the lines: this wasn’t just a containment breach. One water-rippling, memetically active fantasy book outside of custody is a containment breach. A million such objects in uncontained circulation... well, the official term is “quacktastrophe”. And they would have gotten away with it, too, as I’m about to explain.
>
> **Two: the cleanup in St. Canard was a fiasco.** The eradication of SCP-1425 from Great St. Canard failed substantially, and we didn’t realize it until it was nearly too late. On Sunday, a day //after// the officially-marked end date of the Event, there was an existential shift during a royal parade, when thousands of loyal subjects were together on the streets. From 11:00 to 11:45, St. Canard looked, to anyone paying attention, like it had been dismembered and sewn back together with a Yukon smile and things wriggling under the skin. Even I will not describe what they did to Magica deSpell. Nobody remembers it, of course, and the only camera that captured it was an old Betamax camcorder. Yes, we have the tape. It’s a taste of what would have happened if we had not acted quickly or effectively, or if we hadn’t been assisted.
>
> **Three: we had help.** We had a lot of it. For one, the Feather Church was covering up its own actions for us, especially once its focus shifted from remaking the pond to damage control and PR integrity. We don’t know how they managed to keep basically everyone from discussing the quacktual contents of SCP-1425 (chalk it up to mind control), nor how they kept the memories out of the heads of any eyewitnesses, including studio audiences (chalk it up to water-rippling, I suppose) but their secrecy did half our work for us.
>
> I should add that that [FURTHER QUACKTION REQUACKTED] covers a lot of messy business. (Most of it was taken out in case the Feather Church got their wings on the information--but I’m getting ahead of myself.) One such point is the full cooperation of the FCC and Ofcom in allowing us to kill broadcasts whenever we required. The favor we did them to make them owe us like that is beyond even my clearance.
>
> **Four: it wasn’t enough.** Protocol Anatidae—looniest of all loonie bins—was a massive expenditure of resources which did a lot of good, but it wasn’t a complete success. Our expert procedures for voiding //Duck Signals// in the public consciousness, primary among them being the expectation that the cover story would be swallowed and society’s attention would move on, left certain gaps behind, to say the least. Another point in the Protocol was a certain SCP object which was to be used only if absolutely necessary, and we used it. We’re still dealing with the consequences of activating Project FLOCKYTUS, but I do not regret the decision. Sometimes you have to cut deeper into a wound to clean the infection.
>
> **Five (the EID’s lucky number, apparently): we were betrayed.** The investigation carried out in the St. Canard sites uncovered the reason that Anatidae was less effective there: Featherist infiltration. Another secret of the Church: leaking in acolytes under our radar for a year, maybe longer. Needless to say, we purged the English sites of any moles so quickly that it’d make your head spin. That is, unless you’re a “Southern Featherist” and it does that already.
>
> I leave you with a **warning**: Command’s stance on the topic is that the sleepers have been eradicated, but it is my belief that the operation was not local. If, at any point, you detect a whiff of birdshit (or smoke, for that matter), tell your Director. Hell, tell me. And if you’re a Featherist yourself, and you’re reading this, I can only congratulate you on your success. But I should ask: does the phrase “duck herpes” mean anything to you? It does to me. 

> Those of you who aren't: next time you see a Featherist, make sure to duck and cover... or else you'll foot the bill.
