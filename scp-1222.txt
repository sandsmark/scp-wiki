**Item #:** SCP-1222

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1222 is to be locked in a 60 x 60 x 60 cm hard plastic container with foam inner-lining to hold it in place. Container can be found inside locker ██ in the storage area of Site-4. If container is damaged in anyway, contact administration for replacement. Personnel with Level 1 clearance or higher may access the object for research purposes.
If not used for testing, once annually Linseed Oil must be rubbed into SCP-1222 for preservation purposes. Linseed Oil must also be used after all research tests.

**Description:** SCP-1222 is a small wooden box measuring 7 x 10 x 10 cm. A lid is attached and held together by a woven thread made of palm fronds. The box is made of bamboo.
Research has shown the box originates from the Lombok region of Indonesia and is called a Lontar box, named after the palm tree used to decorate it. Traditional use is for basic storage of items and also carrying of wedding clothing. The box is brown in colour and is decorated with patterns and shells common for the Lombok region of Indonesia. The contents are empty.

SCP-1222 was found in ██████████, a village of Nias Island located off the coast from the Sumatra region of Indonesia on November 18, 1984. A rescue team dispatched in the area discovered a dug out chamber beneath debris of a destroyed home. In the middle of the chamber was a Caucasian woman kneeling on the floor with the item in her hands.

**REPORT EXCERPT** ██-██-1984
> We were relieved at first to find a survivor under all the rubble. A single mother had lived there with two children and an infant, and all four had perished when their home fell. A neighbour had reported that the mother was always talking about a disabled cousin she also cared for, and was worried for the cousin’s safety. After inspecting and moving the rubble, we found a hole in the corner of where the sleeping area would have been. The hole went down two meters before turning toward an entrance of a small chamber. The man who volunteered to go down called out that he had found a woman in prayer and that she was in shock. He then went to pick her up and take her out when the woman started screaming. When he emerged with her she was thrashing about and speaking in a language we didn’t recognise. She was without a scratch on her body, but her clothes were old and falling apart and a thick layer of dust covered all parts. The woman calmed down after we constrained her and was sent to an emergency medical centre set up nearby.

Light amnesiacs were given to all members of the rescue team after receiving the report.

The subject’s name is ████ ██████, born 4 June 18██. Agents acquired her at the emergency medical centre where she was transported to Site-4. The only item with her was SCP-1222. Subject spoke fluent Dutch that was standard for the 1800’s. When questioned about SCP-1222 she went into detail about finding it in a village not far from where she was found, after her father had [DATA EXPUNGED] retrieved it from the ashes. Subject was commissioned to D-Class personnel at Site-3.

SCP-1222 is safe when touched. Tests with D-Class personnel show SCP-1222’s effects do not take place until both hands of the test subject are touching the base and their eyes looking in toward the box. When this occurs, the test subject enters a dormant state of stasis. No breathing, blood pressure or brainwave functions are recorded. The test subject will remain in the position they were in when using SCP-1222, even when an outside force is pushed upon them. While the test subject is in this state it is possible for another to touch SCP-1222 without any changes. Blocking the test subject point of view from SCP-1222 does not alter their state.
When another person touches the test subject with their bare skin and tries to get their attention, the test subject will immediately awaken from their state with no knowledge or harm from the events that had occurred between entering and exiting the stasis. No knowledge has been gained as to why only the touch of another human’s skin will awaken the subject. Attempts have been made using other species, such as canines, chimpanzees, various insects and leeches but all have failed. The skin of a deceased human also failed to awaken a subject from stasis. The primary theory is when a subject is in stasis, they can remain that way indefinitely if no contact with human skin occurs.

When the test subject is in stasis, it is possible to move them around without them awakening. Trying to inflict damage has also been ineffective as the subject becomes impervious to nearly all forms of harm. Through latex gloves, all areas of the subject were described as hard, with comparisons to stone or metal. 

**TEST LOG 1222-1**

**TEST:** SCP-1222-T12
**PROCEDURE:** Stuck with metal rod
**RESULT:** After 32 strike to the subject’s head the rod had become warped and dented.

**TEST:** SCP-1222-T14
**PROCEDURE:** Fired at with a .38 Special revolver
**RESULT:** The bullet compressed against the subject right earlobe. Subject fell to side from force.

**TEST:** SCP-1222-T22
**PROCEDURE:** Fired at with an AR-10 rifle using 7.62x51 NATO rounds
**RESULT:** The bullet shattered against the subjects right shoulder. Subject moved three meters from the force and hit side wall.


**TEST:** SCP-1222-T30
**PROCEDURE:** Swiped at with 30cm kitchen knife
**RESULT:** Knife reflected.

**TEST:** SCP-1222-T31
**PROCEDURE:** Stabbed with 30cm kitchen knife
**RESULT:** The tip of the knife chipped.

**TEST:** SCP-1222-T50
**PROCEDURE:** Fluoroantimonic acid poured onto subjects back
**RESULT:** Acid seeped off of the subject and into the glass container beneath.

**TEST:** SCP-1222-T53
**PROCEDURE:** Partially submerged in Fluoroantimonic acid
**RESULT:** Subject was asked to hold SCP-1222 above the head while entering stasis. Subject was lowered into a glass container two meters tall with one meter filled with Fluoroantimonic acid. Test was conducted with safety measure to ensure no damage to SCP-1222 would occur. After two weeks of no reported changes, subject was removed, cleaned and reawaken. Subject passed due to small build up of acid in the pores of the chest. New D-Class personnel was brought in.

**TEST:** SCP-1222-T61
**PROCEDURE:** Foam stress ball thrown at subjects head
**RESULT:** A researcher who had been reprimanded with the excessive use of [DATA EXPUNGED] against the subject said he threw the ball out of anger. Since the subject was female with short hair, the ball was impaled be a large area of hair.

**TEST:** SCP-1222-T63
**PROCEDURE:** Petrol ignited
**RESULT:** A small quantity of petrol was poured over the subjects lower back and set alight. The area became scorched black with residue but no visible damage was shown. 
**NOTE** //No further tests involving substances that could harm the box will be used unless under strict supervision of a safety team and class 3 personnel. This is only to prevent damage to the box and is not a personal attack on any researcher.//

**TEST:** SCP-1222-T68
**PROCEDURE:** A slap
**RESULT:** Both a gloved and ungloved slap were given to the test subject. The gloved slap had no effect and managed to topple over the test subject. The ungloved slapped immediately awoke the test subject, whom shrieked in a startled surprise. When D-class personnel was asked to describe the feeling of slapping, he replied “like putting your hand through paper and immediately hitting flesh”.

**Addendum:** 
Future tests are scheduled for use of nuclear materials, destructive bacteria, nano-machines, and SCPs ████, ████, ████, ████, ████, ████ and ████. Various Keter class SCPs were also considered but decided against due to possibility of the damage or destruction of SCP-1222.
