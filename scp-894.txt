**Item #:** SCP-894

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** All copies of SCP-894 are available for researcher use. When not checked out, copies of SCP-894 are to be stored in SCP containment locker 12 at Site 19.

**Description:** SCP-894 is a number of small plastic monkeys, moulded so that the monkeys' hands are covering their mouths. On the bottom of each copy is stamped 'The Factory.' Copies of SCP-894 are easily destroyed, whether through brute strength or applied heat.

When any living being within five meters of SCP-894 makes visual contact with a specimen, they are rendered incapable of vocalisation for a period of 24 hours. In humans, function of the vocal cords has been observed to continue during this time, and operation of the tongue and jaw is uninhibited, except during a conscious attempt to produce language or other meaningful sound. In addition, speech processing and written forms of communication are unimpaired. It has therefore been concluded that the effect is sourced in those areas of the brain associated with speech production. It has been shown that subjects suffering from severe visual agnosia or are otherwise incapable of identifying SCP-894 are unaffected.

The first instance of SCP-894 was found hanging outside the complaint office of [DATA EXPUNGED]. There are currently seven copies of SCP-894 in Foundation hands.

NOTE: Researchers should be made aware, Dr. Bright keeps a copy of SCP-894 in plain view on his desk. -O5-6
