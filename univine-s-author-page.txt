Hey there, and welcome to my author page! I, Univine, am a Chinese-American computer science major and aspiring software engineer. I have a passion for competing in collegiate quizbowl, which, incidentally, has informed much of what I've written for this website. Here's a listing of all of the articles I've written so far in chronological order, with some personal commentary on each.

**SCPs:**

* [[[SCP-1445]]] ("An Antique Spacecraft") - My first article, from just over two years before this author page was created. I don't particularly remember my thought process behind this article, but I //definitely// remember the nerve-wracking (yet enjoyable) experience of posting my first article. Although this article definitely does not reflect my current philosophy towards and experience with writing SCPs, it still is a good representation of my overall writing style.
* [[[SCP-2515]]] ("//Napoleon Crossing the Urals//") - Around the time I wrote this article, I had decided to study Jacques-Louis David's paintings in preparation for quizbowl tournaments. Then, I must have wondered, "What if there was a timeline in which Napoleon invaded (spoiler alert) the Daevite Empire, and David decided to paint it?" The result was this article, in which I attempted to synthesize the site's Daevite mythos with real-world history and art.
* [[[SCP-2788]]] ("God is --Red-- Rich") - This article was initially inspired by the biopic //The Last Emperor//, which gave me the idea of a god transforming into a simple citizen over the ages. Initially, I had trouble with developing this idea into an actual article, but my memory of reading about Huaxi Village provided me a setting for this article and the impetus to write it. It was my first attempt at a character-based SCP, but overall I was very happy with the result.
* [[[SCP-2229]]] ("Legate of Ursa Major to the Senate and People of Rome") - The idea behind this article was one that I've been sitting on for quite a while, since it was intended to be a twist on the conventional idea of ancient aliens. At the same time, I wanted to try my hand at a direct crosslink with another SCP, in this case [[[SCP-1822]]], and based on the combination of these two notions, I wrote this article.
* [[[SCP-2309]]] ("Iron Wall of Dhul-Qarnayn") - In the last month or so, I've spent quite a bit of time learning about Islamic theology and practices. In doing so, I read the Surat Al-Kahf, a section of the Qur'an describing the construction of an iron wall by Dhul-Qarnayn to contain Yajuj and Majuj (Gog and Magog). Looking into this more, I found descriptions of Yajuj and Majuj that reminded me distinctly of Sarkist creatures, giving me the impetus for this article.
