    **Item #:** SCP-717

    **Object Class:** Euclid

    **Special Containment Procedures:**  

SCP-717 is encased within Site-██, publicly known as the ██████████ Observatory.  Observatory dome must remain closed from 10:30pm to 3:30am or when SCP-717 is active.  A minimum of twelve armed guards are to be stationed outside Site-██ during all hours.  Flamethrowers and flash-bang grenades are to be secured in the guardhouse in case of emergency.  

Internal temperature of Site-██ is not to exceed 10 degrees Celsius.  Only one of Site-██'s internal spotlights can be on at any time, but should be dimmed if SCP-717 is active.  Only Level 2 staff or higher with at least a Psionic Resistance Index of 30 rating and who have passed a monthly psychological evaluation are allowed entrance.  No more than 3 (three) persons may enter at any time, and no more than 2 (two) of these may be on-site security.  Visiting staff are advised to wear warm, darkly colored clothing and light-amplification visors while within Site-██.  Staff are permitted to bring flashlights or flares but may not use them outside of an emergency. No radios or cell-phones permitted.

Do remove any further pieces of the SCP-717 home from the premises.  Do not tamper with or remove any markings on the walls.  

See description for procedures relating to SCP-717's individual components.

    **Description:**  

SCP-717 is the ruins of a two story Victorian style home hidden within Site-██, specifically the remains of the guest bedroom on the upper story.  Although the walls of the hallway leading to SCP-717 have burnt through, the doorway to the room is to remain closed at all times.  Staff are required to knock gently upon the door once for each member of staff present before entering, even for routine maintenance.  All other doors within the house have been removed.

SCP-717-1 is a white cloth mannequin and is to be kept within this room at all times, preferably seated before its table.  Staff are to note its position and markings once per day.  Any changes or signs of movement are to be reported immediately.  On the table before SCP-717-1 there most always be: 

1 open spiral bound notebook
1 wide-mouthed container of black ink
2 working pens
1 modified Ouija board
1 microphone 
1 low-power desk lamp.  

No other items are to be placed on this table.  If SCP-717-1 shows signs of movement, one staff member is to sit at the table and remain in the room with it.  One staff member is to immediately proceed to the basement.  Staff member present must turn on the lamp and point at the word "WAIT" on the modified Ouija board, then immediately shut the lamp off.  Staff is advised to remain quiet and breathe steadily until relieved.  Any further actions on the part of SCP-717-1 must be reported softly into the microphone, with repeated requests to "WAIT."

SCP-717-2 is sealed behind a titanium alloy vault door, lined with a thin plating of [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-148 SCP-148].  It is mounted on the wall behind SCP-717-1.  The vault is to remain sealed per mutual agreement.

SCP-717-3 is a backup mannequin for SCP-717-1 to be used as a replacement if SCP-717-1 becomes damaged or needs cleaning.  It is located in the basement of the home, which has suffered the least fire damage.  If SCP-717-3 is observed to become animate in the basement it must be guided to its seat upstairs where normal procedure for SCP-717-1 is to take place.  The unused mannequin is to be moved downstairs.  If SCP-717-1 becomes animate at the same time as SCP-717-3, Procedure-717-Omega1 is to be enacted.

In the event the SCP-717-2 vault is breached from the other side, the conventional explosives within SCP-717 are to be immediately detonated regardless of staff on site and Procedure-717-Omega2 is to be enacted.

    **Addendum:**

Unauthorized staff are not permitted to communicate with SCP-717-1 beyond requesting its patience while authorized personnel arrive.  This can possibly take days, and SCP-717-1 should understand this.  Prolonged exposure to SCP-717-1 can produce feelings of unease and discomfort.  This is attributed to its jerky, twitching movements as well as the mannequin's limp neck and unnatural chill.  Although direct exposure to the entity has been shown to cause [DATA EXPUNGED] therefore it can safely be assumed that SCP-717-1 is even less enthusiastic about contact than we are.

If authorized personnel do not arrive within 24 hours, staff on site may leave the room after tapping the word "WAIT" three times in succession.  A member of staff is to return once every 24 hours to ask SCP-717-1 to "WAIT" again until authorized personnel arrive.

Personnel with BETA clearance or higher should see also document #017-1.

  **Procedure-717-Omega1**

All floodlights within Site-██ are to be activated and sirens are to sound within the facility.  All personnel are to evacuate the site and equip flamethrowers until receiving further instructions.

  **Procedure-717-Omega2**

[DATA EXPUNGED]

  **The next scheduled meeting with SCP-717-1 is December 21st, 2012.**
