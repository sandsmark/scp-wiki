**Item #:** SCP-3697

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3697 is to be monitored in order to prevent the spread of public awareness. Any callers are to be detained, interviewed about how they became aware of SCP-3697, and administered amnestics. Any public or online displays of SCP-3697's number are to be erased or monitored.

**Description:** SCP-3697 is an anomalous toll-free telephone service accessed at the telephone number 1-690-69█-████. Approximately 78% of individuals who call this number connect to a recording of the song "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley, followed by a synthesized voice reading a web address leading to a html file [See Document 3697-1]. When this number is called by certain individuals who display sexually abusive or exploitative behavior[[footnote]]This includes indviduals who have no public records or evidence of sexual misconduct.[[/footnote]], SCP-3697's anomalous features manifest. 

When called by an individual displaying the previously-mentioned profile, SCP-3697 will feature a deep voice with a Brooklyn accent, seemingly taking the role of a telephone operator (SCP-3697-A). SCP-3697-A's speech is highly repetitive and nonresponsive to the caller's speech, indicating that it is an audio recording or other non-sapient construct. SCP-3697-A will begin with a set line of dialogue, with minimal variation [See Test Logs], followed by a unique audio file (SCP-3697-B). The audio files played on SCP-3697 range from 2 seconds to two hours and 38 minutes long, and are typically recordings of nonsexual activities edited to trigger an autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) in the listener. The initial caller, even if they have not previously shown any response to similar audio, will express high levels of pleasure while listening to this audio file. Following the completion of the audio file, a three-second-long tone will play, followed by SCP-3697 hanging up.

After exposure to SCP-3697-B, individuals immediately undergo a number of behavioral changes. The individuals demonstrate a complete absence of libido, as well as any interest in, or enjoyment of, sexual intercourse of any kind. Additionally, they will display increased interest in the activity recorded in SCP-3697-B, and derive pleasure from performing the activity directly. The affected individuals do not show any desire to involve others in this activity, and typically will not be aware that their behavior is changed or unusual unless it is pointed out to them.
