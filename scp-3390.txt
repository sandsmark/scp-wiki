**Item #:** SCP-3390

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3390 is temporarily contained on basement floor 19 of Site-21. Until SCP-3390 can be removed from floor B-19 and secured within a more permanent containment unit the following procedures have been enacted for the safety and security of personnel either visiting or working at Site-21.
Floor B-19 is to remain within lock-down and off-limits to all personnel with any and all blast doors connecting floor B-19 with the rest of the facility to remain closed and the systems controlling them isolated. 
Any persons attempting to enter floor B-19 are to be detained and questioned. 


Under no circumstances is power to be returned to the freight elevator which connects floor B-19 with the rest of the facility.
No personnel with Germanic heritage, within two generations, are to enter floor B-18 nor are any personnel to make disparaging remarks about the performance of the French Army.


If future containment of SCP-3390 is deemed impossible, all entrances to floor B-19 are to be demolished and sealed behind re-enforced concrete. 


In the event that the service elevator on floor B-19 becomes active Site-21 is to be evacuated in it's entirety.
The three members of foundation personnel assigned to the monitoring of SCP-3390 are to remain behind until the containment status of SCP-3390 can be confirmed.
In the event that SCP-3390 breaches the ground floor and attempts to leave Site-21 procedure 121-Navis Terra is to be enacted immediately.  



**Description:** Due to the nature in which it is contained SCP-3390 has been able to evade all attempts at a full examination. As a result all information pertaining to the description of SCP-3390, both physically and in reference to it's anomalous effects are entirely through physical observation via eyewitness reports and security camera footage.


SCP-3390 is a large mechanical construct that is superficially identical to a Char2C Armoured Fighting vehicle, or tank, manufactured 1919 and developed by the French Army during the First World War.


SCP-3390 is approximately 4 meters high, 10 meters in length , 3 meters in width and is expected to be at least 70 tonnes in weight. It is painted in a dark green colour typical of French Army forest camouflage schemes of the period and is showing signs of wear and tear that can be assumed to be from age and lack of maintenance.


Prior to Incident 3390-2 the anomalous effects of SCP-3390 were unrecorded. It remained in an inactive state and was contained within a standard vehicle containment garage at the Site-21 underground motor-pool pending classification.
Following incident 3390-2 SCP-3390 was observed via close circuit security cameras until power to floor B-19 was lost.

> **Summary of Incident:** Events leading to SCP-3390's current containment conditions.


> **Timeline of events** 
>
> 4:35am 
> Security Camera footage observing SCP-3390 at Section D of the underground containment motor-pool at Site-21 notes two members of security personnel, identified as ████ ████████ and ██████ ██████, patrolling the area stopping to observe SCP-3390. Remote mic picks up the two discussing Second World War history. 

> 4:41am 
> Guards return to their patrol route continuing to discuss history. One of the guards identified as ████ ████████ utters the words "Cheese Eating Surrender Monkeys" , a common insult directed at the performance of the French forces during World War Two, at which point SCP-3390 is seen becoming active and accelerates towards the two guards.
> Cause of Death to both Guards was though crushing injury.

> 4:44am
> SCP-3390 continues moving on an eastern projectory. It penetrates the outer wall of the facility and enters corridor 44/B partially destroying Site-21's D-Lab block resulting in the deaths of ██ Personnel and injuring ██ others.

> 4:50am 
> SCP-3390 has accelerated to a speed of 31kph and continues to move through the facility with complete disregard for any objects or persons in its way. SCP-3390 Demonstrates the capability to drive through solid objects beyond the expected capability for a machine of it's design and period including concrete barricades, thick metal walls and solid steel doors.

> 4:51am 
> Containment Alarm is sounded, Site-21 begins evacuation protocol.

> 4:52am 
> SCP-3390 penetrates D-Lab blast door, now entering Section F staff cafeteria.
> Security Personnel are witnessed opening fire using standard weaponry, SCP-3390 appears undamaged and returns fire.
> [DATA EXPUNGED]
> Resulting blast weakens structure around staff cafeteria causing part of section F to collapse. SCP-3390 is witnessed falling with the collapse.
> SCP-3390 continues downwards through the facility, coming to a rest at Floor 19
> Current containment protocols were initiated

> And after we get up there I think we've all agreed we're coming to your office to have a little "discussion".

> It's weird, every time I see it I get a sense of purpose from it like it knows what it's doing. It's stupid I know but I just can't help shake the feeling we're dealing with something intelligent here.
> Look I'm sorry for what I said but please, it's guarding the blast door now, if I can slip past it I can sneak up the stairs.

This must be an easy one for you. Description: Big metal tank, likes to run people over, sings. Containment procedures: Just throw it in with all the junior staff and watch the fun.

> Subject: Calm now
>Body:
> It saw me. But it didn't attack. It just stared, kept looking between me and the blast door. It's weird, I get that sense of purpose again, I couldn't do anything I just ran but it didn't follow. Maybe it feels sorry for me. Remember to write that down in it's document, SCP shows more compassion for researchers than you do.

>Body:
> It wants out. Not into the facility but outside, it's going somewhere or rather it 'NEEDS' to be somewhere. Don't ask me how or why I just know ok. Like I look at it and I just get this overwhelming feeling of what it wants.
> It broke down the door to the freight elevator but the power was out, it kept trying to do something to the panel but I couldn't see what.
> I'm going to try approaching it, if it is intelligent it can be reasoned with.
> Also I broke open one of the vending machines for food, feel free to put my ass on disciplinary for that.

> 7:09am Camera Footage shows SCP-3390 attempting to over-ride the lockout on the freight elevator. Camera was not mounted in a position where it able to ascertain how SCP-3390 was able to do this. After several moments Freight elevator becomes active and descends to floor 19.
> Upon Arrival SCP-3390 enters the elevator and attempts to activate it before power to the entire floor is manually cut.

> 7:12am Camera, now on battery power, notes a large mechanical sounding scream followed by a series of violent explosions. Dust and smoke obscure the camera lens. SCP-3390 is not sighted and no further sounds are recorded for seven hours by which point battery expires and camera ceases operation.

> 2:30pm Probe camera mounted to a drone sent to ascertain status of SCP-3390 and locate any survivors.
> After initiating standard sweep SCP-3390 was discovered still within freight elevator. SCP-3390 was motionless however service panel to elevator was open and floor was scattered with various Foundation equipment, most notably batteries. Many of these were jammed into service panel. Again no indication of how SCP-3390 was capable of achieving this.

> 2:46pm Body of ████████ located. Body was slumped in a seated position near blast door. Eyes appeared open in shock, face and torso covered in deep scratch marks, large camera battery forcefully inserted into mouth.

> ██:██pm Drone ceased operation at █ hours, reasons unknown. 

**Final Statement** Floor B-18 was repaired and has been re-purposed into an observation centre for SCP-3390. However all remote cameras have only been able to observe SCP-3390 for a limited time before they cease operation. Further drone reconnaissance has noted all equipment used ends up in pieces scattered around SCP-3390 and the freight elevator area. 
Remote observation of SCP-3390 through any electronic device has now been restricted. Any new equipment introduced to SCP-3390's temporary containment area must be either non-battery operated or self-destruct on loss of contact.
Given SCP-3390's current progress we could estimate roughly 3-4 years before any serious problems emerge. An alternate method of containment will be required before then.
