-----

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Material:** Tom Sawyer, by Mark Twain

//Results:// A character named Fred is mentioned at several points in the story, largely as an onlooker.  No change to the story is noticed.

//Notes:// "This will serve as a baseline for future effects of SCP-423." - Dr. E. Mann

-----
**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Material:** The Hobbit, by J. R. R. Tolkien

//Results:// A 14th dwarf named Feredor is a member of the party.  The narrative is largely the same, except that there are no references to a "lucky number."  Feredor is mentioned as surviving the Battle of Five Armies, but Oin is killed.

//Notes:// "SCP-423's role is larger in this work, allowing a better look at its effects.  The dialog written for the character is similar to that written for the other dwarves.  Other differences in text match Tolkien's writing style as used in the rest of the book." -Dr. E. Mann

-----
**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Material:** Plain Journal

//Results:// There was no result for some time, until one of the researchers wrote his name on the cover.  The words "Hi, there" appeared underneath.  A conversation was held, during which it was established that SCP-423 possessed both the ability and desire to communicate.

//Notes:// "This proves that SCP-423 is sentient.  If it can be controlled, it could be useful in dealing with certain text-based SCPs.  This bears further research." -Dr. E. Mann

-----
**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Material:** Dragonquest, by Anne McCaffery

//Results:// A minor blue rider named F'Red appears in the story.  No other changes are noted.

-----
**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Material:** Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

//Results:// A wizard named Fred appeared.  Very few changes in the story are noted, except one scene in which SCP-423 is confused with an existing character in the series.

//Notes:// "SCP-423 displayed paranormal abilities in the narrative, though nothing out of note for the fictional universe.  However, when returned to the journal, SCP-423 said that it couldn't duplicate them outside of that particular narrative universe." - Dr. E. Mann

-----

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Material:** Ulysses, by James Joyce

//Results:// SCP-423 immediately returned to the journal, where it wrote out "Ow, ow, bad idea."

//Notes:// "Note this as a potential punishment for SCP-423 if it misbehaves." - Dr. E. Mann

-----

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Material:** Draco Tavern, by Larry Niven

//Results:// A new regular employee of the Draco Tavern showed up, named Fred. Only mentioned in passing save in the story "Cruel and Unusual", where he expressed sympathy for the Chirpsithra view.

//Notes:// "Either he's not completely human in outlook, or only acts that way when dealing with stories of aliens. We should probably test this further." - Dr D. Vettir

-----

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Test Material:** The Battle Hymn of the Republic, by Julia Beecher Stowe.

//Results:// verse 2, lines 1 and 3 altered. Rather than "I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps" and "I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps", the lines now state "Fred has seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps"  and "Fred can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps". Upon returning to the journal, SCP-423 wrote "that was... interesting, but I don't think I want to try it again."
