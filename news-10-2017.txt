* [[[No Matter What Mask You Wear]]] - I will always love you, regardless of your artificial face.

Monsters run amok, researchers vanish, and the fate of S & C Plastics hangs in the balance. By [[*user Ihp]]. //Black Autumn impresses in multiple ways - it's wonderfully atmospheric, it has fantastic imagery, tension, and character development, and it's a complete, finished miniseries - the last one in particular being a rare privilege on this site. Halloween may have come and gone, but Black Autumn provides enough thrills and chills to keep your spooky spirits high.//
* [[[Portraits Of Your Father]]] - Everyone knew him as Kondraki, King of the Butterflies and the man who rode 682. But only his son knew him as Kondraki, the father and the man who had to drink himself to sleep.

Thanks for tuning in again, folks! If you're unsatisfied with the blurb(s) provided for the article(s) you wrote, feel free to change it. Of course, you could just avoid that problem entirely by sending [[*user A Random Day]] a blurb for your article. We may or may not use it (if we can think of something more attention-getting, though we can try to stick with one you give us) but we'd really would just like them in order to make the process easier for making these. This is a community thing, and we want authors to give their blurbs to sell these articles much easier. It reduces the workload we have to do, and helps the news come out that much earlier!
