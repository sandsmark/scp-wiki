**Item #:** SCP-028-DE

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-028-DE is disguised as a homeopathic wellness-hotel, which is used as quarters for most of the personnel. Personnel stationed here may use the wellness-areas for relaxation, which are operated by level 1 personnel. Should civilians try to book a room, they are to be put off with alleged overbooking. The associated grounds are fenced-in and under video surveillance, and there are 2 guard squads on patrol at all times. The driveways are under access control.

The subterranean sectors of SCP-028-DE are fully under video surveillance and are permanently patrolled by 12 guard squads of no less than 8 men, armed with an arsenal reaching from normal assault rifles and flame throwers up to laser-projectors. For a full list of equipment see #028-DE/A3

There are 18 Scranton Reality Anchors on the surface, with various disguises and guarded and under surveillance at all time, in a vertical distance of exactly 747.9 m (seven-hundred forty-seven point nine) from a fixed metering point on the perimeter, and an even distance to each other, correct to a decimeter. These SRAs are to be permanently in operation and calibrated to 20 Hm ± 0.1 Hm.

Around SCP-028-DE-C in Room ᚠ is a spherical framework with a diameter of 18 m, holding 36 SRAs in as even distances as possible. On one side the SRAs and the frame are pivoting, to allow access for the equipment from #028-DE/P1.

Should reality-deviation of more than 2 Hm be detected on one or more Anchors, all off-duty personnel are to be put into standby, the site's Reaction-Forces have to take up their stations and O4[[footnote]]Unofficial designation of the directors' council of the German branch.[[/footnote]] is to be informed. If the deviation reaches 6 Hm, O5 is to be informed and codeword ``Heimdall'' is to be sent to Site-DE20 with top priority and with normal priority to the facilities on list #028-DE/A1. The Reaction-Forces start preparing protocol ``Mjölnir''. Individuals from U-3378-DE (SCP-028-DE-A) that may manifest as of a deviation of 11 Hm are to be neutralized by //all// available means.

Should SCP-028-DE-C open, the protocol ``Mjölnir'' is to be executed. Should protocol ``Mjölnir'' be unsuccessful or should the deviation reach 18 Hm, Site-DE20 is ordered by O4 or O5 to execute protocol ``Ragnarök''.

**Description:** SCP-028-DE is Site-DE3. Site-DE3 is the former headquarter and secret research facility of the former [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/skp-portal Sonderkommando für Paranormales][[footnote]]The SKP was a secret organization under the direction of Heinrich Himmler, which had arisen from the Hexen-Sonderauftrag of the SS, focused on the weaponization of anomalies. After the Second World War, the SKP was - at least in our universe - disbanded, their anomalies were transferred to the Foundation and their personnel was, as far as trustworthy, integrated into the SCP-Foundation stationed in Germany and Austria, or terminated.[[/footnote]], and until the first appearance of SCP-028-DE-A during #028-DE/I1, was mainly used to research the SKP's work and for storage of SCPs not requiring complex Containment Procedures and care. After incident #028/DE-I2 Site-DE3 was classified as SCP-028-DE and all stored SCPs were transferred to other facilities.

SCP-028-DE consists of 106 rooms on 8 levels which are connected by hallways, staircases, and lifts. All rooms are marked with a rune of the elder futhark and sometimes a number, depending on their kind. The upper levels contain mostly rooms for personnel, training, and storage. The mid-levels contain laboratories, offices, and workshops, the lower levels contain cells and containment rooms. In the center of the facility, Room ᚠ is located, a hall reaching over four levels. Both accesses are equipped with armored doors and in the second level above the room's ground is a control room with observation windows made from bullet-proof glass, which leads to the conclusion that Room ᚠ was used as a containment room and/or experimental laboratory. However, the SKP has destroyed all records about the purpose of the room as well as the controls before the Foundation took over.

Since incident #028-DE/I2 there is a portal (SCP-028-DE-C) in the middle of Room ᚠ, leading to universe U-3378-DE. The portal is currently closed by the SRAs around SCP-028-DE.

> //On the 199█-██-██ at 02:47 in the morning - SCP-028-DE then was designated just as Site-DE3 and was not fully under video surveillance - the terminal of Dr. █████ turned itself off after false passwords were entered repeatedly while trying to access documents of clearance level 4, and triggered an alarm.//
>
> //As nobody worked on night-shifts despite the guards, and nightly access to the lower levels was only possible with an exception permit, a silent intruder alert was triggered according to alarm-protocol. The Reaction-Forces of the facility were sent to Dr. █████'s office and the terminal was set to a virtual access mode, to feign access to the database to keep the intruder occupied.//
> 
> //The Reaction-Team stormed Dr. █████'s office and found a person who looked like Dr. █████ but wore a light gray uniform with the logo of the SKP, and was busy with Dr. █████'s terminal.//
> 
> //The person, hereafter designated SCP-028-DE-A-1, immediately opened fire with a weapon that is assumed to have been a fully automatic railgun, whose projectiles penetrated through the body armor and even through the walls of twenty centimeters thick reinforced concrete.//
> 
> //A nonfatally wounded member of the Reaction-Team reported that a few minutes after the gunfight, in which the site director locked down the lower levels and called for an MTF, she removed a floppy-disk from the terminal which was connected to some sort of tablet computer// [[footnote]]The Guardsman described it as ``//a flat thing the size of ISO A5 paper she tapped on//''; tablet-computers did not exist in our universe yet at that time.[[/footnote]] //via cable. Moments later the air started shimmering in an area before her, warped and some sort of portal opened. She entered the portal which closed behind her.//

The surviving guardsman noted that he could see the same room through the portal, which was painted in another color, and the furniture was designed in some sort of futuristic Bauhaus style.

It is presumed that due to the then inactive nature of SCP-028-DE-B it was impossible to open larger portals, which would have allowed a larger infiltration of the facility.

Analysis of the terminal's protocols resulted that the SCP-Directory, information about facilities, personnel, security-protocols and especially SCPs that were taken over from the SKP and their positions had been downloaded. These SCPs were immediately relocated and the security of the respective sites was raised.

As Scranton Reality Anchors were unavailable at that time, surveillance cameras were installed in all hallways and the guards were stocked up, all SCPs were transferred to other facilities, access to the Foundation's database was strongly limited and only the SKP's work was researched. Already then it was considered to declare the facility an SCP, but it was not deemed necessary.

**Preamble:**
Located in the ceiling of Room ᚠ was a down curved cover with a diameter of circa 2 m, which could not be removed from inside the room, and left the impression of being part of a larger device inside the ceiling. In the week before the 200█-██-██, the site director ordered that the floor of Room ᚾ2, which is located directly above Room ᚠ, was to be opened to access the device assumed to be inside the ceiling. Right below a thin concrete floor of Room ᚾ2, there was a steel hatch leading to a low chamber in the ceiling between both levels, which turned out to be a maintenance area for the device in question. Inside some old tools, spare parts and an uninscribed wiring plan were found. Though no drawing or documentation indicating the purpose of the device could be uncovered. The type label of the device had been removed. According to technical analysis, it was technically similar to a Scranton Reality Anchor but was designed to rather emit radiation than a stabilizing field, with, what was formerly assumed to be a cover, serving as an emitter. It was presumed to have been a safety device for the real purpose of Room ᚠ, and it was decided to test the device, to put it to use if applicable. Hereafter it is designated as SCP-028-DE-B.

**Incident #028-DE/I2:**

Despite its age, it was technically faultless and connected to a terminal, set up in the control room, which also controlled the other systems of the room. In accordance with safety-standards for reality-affecting machinery, all non-essential personnel was evacuated from the facility and all sectors were locked down. SRAs were very rare at that time and unavailable for the test. It is to be mentioned that all radio transmissions of the following protocol were digital and encrypted.

The following is a transcript of an audio-/video protocol from the control room:

> //Present in the control room are Dr. Wilhelm Wiesmann (project manager), Dr. Frauke Meier (physicist), Dipl. Ing. Tobias Gretenkordt (electrical engineer), Lieutenant Cem Yilmaz (guard commander) and four armed guardsmen. Behind each armored door, two groups each of 12 men of the reaction forces are waiting, additional reaction- and security forces are on stand-by. MTF DE8-𝔊 (at that time without portable SRAs but already specialized for reality benders) is readied and on stand-by. The room is equipped with various measuring instruments; in lack of a Kant-Counter the reality-deviation can not be measured in Hume, but a laser grid detects distortions and diffraction of the room.//
> 
> < START OF PROTOCOL >
> 
> **Dr. Wiesmann:** Recording. Alright, the security protocols are in effect, electrical supply and data link to our mysterious device are online, Room Fehu //(name of the rune ᚠ)// is empty. Gretenkordt, status?
> 
> **Gretenkordt:** All is ready. My finger hovers over the big red button.
> 
> **Dr. Wiesmann:** Well, press it then.
> 
> //Dipl. Ing. Gretenkordt activates the device.//
> 
> **Dr. Meier:** I'm measuring a rise of long wave electromagnetic radiation. Nothing else. Or... wait, how shall I put it... it spreads over the frequency band. In other words, there is a slow increase in short wave radiation.
> 
> **Dr. Wiesmann:** Can you determine the source? //(The measuring points are arranged in a way that the source of any detected radiation can be triangulated.)//
>
> **Dr. Meier:** Yes, definitely the dome in the ceiling. The radiation soon will reach visible light.
>
> //A few minutes later the dome seems to emit a deep red glow, which seems to wander slowly over bright red, yellow, etc. to cover the whole color spectrum until it exceeds the spectrum of visible light.//
> 
> **Dr. Meier:** It seems to spread further. Now it has reached the spectrum of hard X-radiation. I just don't understand what for... Wait, it stopped. At ███ pm... Now it seems to degrade from the top, I mean from the longwave spectrum... as if it would focus on this wavelength.
> 
> **Dr. Wiesmann:** But wouldn't an emitter for electromagnetic radiation emit the correct wavelength right from the start? Why covering the whole spectrum? That's a waste of time.
> 
> **Dr. Meier:** Willi, we are talking about a Nazi-device here. Of all they did, they did nothing just because, especially not the SKP. There must be a reason. Maybe it was searching for a wavelength or frequency, and we just don't know by what criteria it chooses.
> 
> //The light turns green, then blue, purple and then goes out.//
> 
> **Gretenkordt:** Who knows, maybe it is a satellite dish and now a portal opens, with Nazi-zombies on dinosaurs and...
> 
> **Dr. Wiesmann:** Fuck, abort!
> 
> **Gretenkordt:** What? Why...
> 
> //Dr. Wiesmann pushes an emergency-shutdown-button, which disconnects SCP-028-DE-B from its electrical supply.//
> 
> **Dr. Wiesmann:** //(Visibly shaken)// That //is// a satellite dish! It has been searching for a frequency to communicate! We...
> 
> **Dr. Meier:** Willi, we have a problem. The device is still running, and right now only emits radiation on this frequency.
> 
> **Dr. Wiesmann:** What?! Gretenkordt?
> 
> **Gretenkordt:** We didn't understand the first half of the device and the other half is unknown technology to us. Maybe this thing has a battery or so.
> 
> **Dr. Wiesmann:** Fucking Shit!
> 
> **Dr. Wiesmann via radio:** Naudis 2, blow up the device, immediately!
> 
> **Reaction force in Room ᚾ2:** Acknowledged, blowing up the device. //Short silence// Demolition not possible, the hatch cannot be opened.
> 
> **Dr. Wiesmann via radio:** Then think about a way, the...
> 
> **Dr. Meier:** The device now focusses on that frequency. I'm detecting a fluctuation in the middle of the room!
> 
> **Gretenkordt:** I'm restarting the device. Maybe a new search operation interrupts whatever is going on.
> 
> **Dr. Wiesmann:** Do that.
> 
> **Dr. Wiesmann via site intercom:** Wiesmann to all personnel, we may be facing a containment breach, prepare yourself!
> 
> //Now a spherical distortion is visible in the center of the room, which grows slowly.//
> 
> **Leutnant Yilmaz:** Doctor, look!
> 
> //He points through the observation window to the distortion which has grown to a size of 3 m at this point, and through which the same room can be seen, just in another color.//
> 
> **Dr. Wiesmann:** Gretenkordt, do something!
> 
> **Gretenkordt:** The device is powered again but doesn't reboot. It probably has to run through the whole cycle or until the juice is empty, or it has to be rebooted manually. I have no clue!
> 
> **Dr. Wiesmann:** Then go to Naudis 2 and pull the plug or whatever.
> 
> **Dr. Wiesmann via radio:** Naudis 2, you are getting visited by an engineer. See to get the hatch open. No matter how!
> 
> //Dipl. Ing. Gretenkordt quickly leaves the control room.//
> 
> **Dr. Meier:** Hm, the distortion decreases but the anomaly does not shrink. Willi, that thing is normalizing with its surroundings!
> 
> **Dr. Wiesmann:** What does that mean?
> 
> **Leutnant Yilmaz:** You can look through it now, Doctor.
> 
> //The anomaly, SCP-028-DE-C, has taken the form of a sphere of Ø15 m with its lower third is immersed into the floor. On the other side, the same room can be seen but painted in pale green instead of white, and the anomaly is surrounded by an apparatus (similar to the frame with the SRAs that is being built later). With cameras observing the anomaly from different angles, it can be seen that on the other side lots of people are gathering. Multiple groups of armed personnel in light grey uniforms and body armor are mustering. Some smaller groups are moving big crates to positions in the room.//
> 
> **Dr. Wiesmann:** Holy shit...
> 
> **Dr. Wiesmann via site intercom:** Wiesmann to all personnel, containment breach imminent, attack individuals in grey uniforms on sight!
> 
> **Dr. Wiesmann via a secured channel to O4:** Dr. Wiesmann from DE3 for O4, we are possibly facing an invasion from another reality! Requesting deployment of MTFs!
> 
> **O4-█:** O4 to Dr. Wiesmann, what sort of invasion are we talking about?
> 
> **Dr. Wiesmann to O4:** Probably a universe full of Nazis.
> 
> **O4-█:** //Short break// Reinforcements are on their way. Hold them off as long as you can. O4 out.
> 
> //O4-█ dispatches MTF DE8-𝔊 (arrival via helicopter after ca. 15 minutes), MTF DE8-𝔅, armored MTF DE8-ℭ (both arrival after ca. 80 minutes) as well as the always-ready MTF DE4-𝔎 (arrival after ca. 25 minutes)//
> 
> < END OF PROTOCOL >

While the MTFs are underway, the Reaction- and Security-forces of the site erect barricades and firing positions in front of the accesses to room ᚠ and in the main corridors. Remaining personnel that is not required is evacuated from the facility. The tank battalion PzBtl 64, the closest unit of the Bundeswehr, is brought to readiness with a fake emergency drill.

The following is a transcript of the events after the arrival of MTF DE8-𝔊 ("8-Gustav"):

> < START OF PROTOCOL >
> 
> //MTF DE8-𝔊 has 20 members and is under command by Captain Martin Franz. It can be separated into three squads: Two combat squads of 8 individuals under command of Captain Franz and Lieutenant Nowak, as well as a technical-scientific squad of 4 under command of Doctor Schmieder.//
> 
> //The likewise dispatched MTF DE4-𝔎 ("4-Karl") is to arrive about 10 minutes later and consists of 14 individuals under command of Captain Rüberg. All members of the MTF have passed a memetic-resistance-training class Ψ-3 and are trained for commando operations.//
> 
> //MTF DE8-𝔊 arrives at Site-DE3 via helicopter 14 minutes after their dispatchment and proceed to the control room of Room ᚠ, in which Captain Franz, Lieutenant Nowak, and the TS-squad then are discussing with the team of Dr. Wiesmann.//
> 
> **Cpt. Franz:** Doctor Wiesmann? Captain Franz from 8-Gustav. These are Lieutenant Nowak and the technical-scientific squad of Doctor Schmieder. Please outline the situation briefly but precisely. I will put the radio of 4-Karl, who are going to be here in a few minutes, on hands-free communication.
> 
> **Dr. Wiesmann:** Good to have you here. So, you see the dome in the room's ceiling? //Points at the dome through the reinforced window.// Therein is a device of the SKP, a former Nazi-institution for anomalies, which technically is similar to a Scranton Reality Anchor and which we wanted to test. Normally it can be accessed from a room above, but the hatch is locked wherefore we could not blow it up. Our technicians have connected it to these controls and started it. There is nearly no original documentation, we reverse-engineered it as far as possible. When we started it, it began searching the whole electromagnetic spectrum, beginning with long waves and focused on a frequency of hard X-radiation, then a distortion appeared and grew to the portal you see there, which has kept its size. I presumed an imminent invasion and requested O4 to deploy you. One of my engineers is on the way to the device to restart it manually, hoping the search interrupts the portal, while a squad tries to open the hatch, yet unsuccessfully though.
> 
> //Visible through SCP-028-DE-C, multiple armed squads of circa 120 men in total have mustered. In front of them, a person in a uniform that looks like an officer's uniform of the Wehrmacht seems to be holding a speech.//
> 
> **Dr. Schmieder:** As far as I know you neither are having a reality-expert nor someone familiar with the design of Reality Anchors? I will go to this room with the TS-Squad. I have memorized the floorplan of your facility, we will find the way by ourselves.
> 
> **Cpt. Franz:** You do that. //To Dr. Wiesmann// We will take a position in the meantime. O4 has dispatched additional MTFs and considering the enemy's assumed amount and strength, we need everyone who can hold a gun. You will stay here.
> 
> **Cpt. Franz via site intercom:** Captain Franz of 8-Gustav here, to all Reaction- and Security-forces: Set your radio to encrypted channel 54. Should you encounter persons in light grey uniforms, you open fire immediately. But take care of yourself, use cover and change your position.
> 
> **Cpt. Rüberg via radio:** 4-Karl to 8-Gustav, we're arriving. Let us meet in the lobby to make a plan.
> 
> **Cpt. Franz via radio:** Good, let's meet there. As far as I can see we are running out of time, so make it on the double.
> 
> //The MTFs are meeting with Hauptmann Armbruster, the commander of site-security, in the lobby.//
> 
> **Cpt. Franz:** So, we do not have time, so we make it short. Hauptmann Armbruster, Captain Rüberg, according to Deployment Policy 28-and-so-forth I am taking operation command. All know the site's floor plans and have read the briefing? //Short break.// Good. The site's Reaction-Forces have secured both entrances of Room Fehu. The armored doors are closed and locked. In the main corridors, barricades and firing positions have been set up. Site-Security is patrolling through the whole facility, in case a secondary portal is opened somewhere, like in incident 1. Two other MTFs are on their way from DE8 by convoy. They are arriving approximately in an hour. One is a heavy infantry platoon of a hundred, the other is an armored unit. If I remember correctly they have some of the new Tactical Power Armors. There is no specific mission plan, as we are unprepared for this threat, so we will improvise. Our mission here is to stop the imminent threat of an invasion, to avert it and to close the portal. Loss of the facility, personnel, and equipment is acceptable. For the first task, 8-Gustav will reinforce the Reaction-Forces at the armored doors. Our Technical-Scientific Squad is working on the last task in Naudis 2. Both 8ers in transfer are responsible to push back possible invaders. 4-Karl, what will you do?
> 
> **Cpt. Rüberg:** We probably would be of use at the armored doors, but we as a commando unit are better suited for counter-invasion. We will stay at the junction of the corridor, leading to both doors. The priority now is to hold up the status quo until the other MTFs arrive. Should the attackers open one door or should they attempt to open both doors, you start a counter-attack from one direction. Divert their attention to you while we are coming from the other side, trying to cross the portal and to destroy whatever technology they are having there. We are carrying explosives with us. Should we be locked in the other world, set up a memorial for us or so.
> 
> **Cpt. Franz:** Good plan, let's make it so. Everyone to their position! Lieutenant Nowak, you take Squad 2 and go to the right.
> 
> **Cpt. Franz via radio:** Franz to Doctor Schmieder, status?
> 
> **Dr. Schmieder via radio:** Schmieder to Franz, we are in Naudis 2, the hatch here appears to be held shut by magnetic locks. The security squad which has been here already is burning a hole in it for half an hour now with a plasma cutter, which proves difficult due to the hatch's concrete filling. I advise against the destruction of the device from below, without having seen it before.
> 
> **Cpt. Franz via radio:** Understood, continue!
> 
> //While the squads are taking positions, and Captain Franz is instructing the MTFs in transfer via radio, the first foreign units cross the portal. The officer, who has been holding a speech before, follows the units. He is taking a mobile phone from his pocket and types in a number. The phone in the control room rings. After a pause, Dr. Wiesmann answers.//
> 
> **Dr. Wiesmann:** Doctor Wiesmann, Site-DE3?
> 
> **Caller:** Good day doctor, this is Major Armbruster of the Waffen-SKP. I know it may not look like it, but actually, we are here for peaceful purposes. Of course, you are having units posted behind the entrances, and probably you have alarmed everybody who can carry a weapon. But before we begin with hostilities, I want to negotiate with you, the site director or someone else who is in charge.
> 
> //This Major Armbruster seems to look very similar to Hauptmann Armbruster from Site-DE3's security. Lieutenant Yilmaz is holding up a hastily inscribed note: {{``Play for time!''}}//
> 
> **Dr. Wiesmann:** I uh... I am afraid I am not the right person, I... have to talk to O4...
> 
> **Maj. Armbruster:** I am sure you have to. Alone to give your advancing forces some time. Just take all the time you want but do not forget this: You caught us by surprise. This here is the forces we could gather in this short time. But as we talk here, the tank battalion 64 of the Wehrmacht is securing the outer perimeter and several Mobile Einsatzkräfte from Sondereinrichtung-4 and -8 are on their way.
> 
> **Dr. Wiesmann via a secure channel to O4:** Wiesmann to O4, they... are in. Their commander wants to talk to you...
> 
> //Short break//
> 
> **O4-1:** O4-1 here, put me through.
> 
> //Doctor Meier patches the call from the phone to the radio unit.//
> 
> [SECURITY CLEARANCE LEVEL 3 CONFIRMED, ACCESS GRANTED]
> 
> **O4-1:** This is O4-1.
> 
> **Maj. Armbruster:** O4-1, good day. I am Major Armbruster of the Waffen-SKP. I am not used to your terminology, as you have given us false information during our last contact. Would you be so kind as to describe your position to me?
> 
> **O4-1:** I am the chairman of the Directors' Council of the germanophone branch of the SCP Foundation. You are invaders in our universe, it's too late for cordialities!
> 
> **Maj. Armbruster:** I understand. Is it possible to talk to a higher instance, or is each of your local Foundations autonomous?
> 
> **O4-1:** You are talking only to me.
> 
> **Maj. Armbruster:** Okay then. Well, as you may imagine, we are not here for research, trade or establishment of diplomatic relations. Yes, we will conquer you, that is beyond all question. We are much more technically advanced than you are. But we are no murderers. We do not want war. If you surrender now and hand us over your facility as a base of operations without resistance, lots of bloodshed can be avoided. I am aware that this decision is not an easy one, but I ask you to see the situation pragmatically. You have opened this portal; our invasion is unavoidable. Resistance only leads to suffering and death. I give you 15 minutes to decide.
> 
> //Major Armbruster hangs up and gives orders to his units. They begin erecting mobile barricades and firing positions. The MTFs are still 30 minutes away.//
> 
> **O4-1 via radio:** O4-1 to all forces in Site-DE3. You now are facing the probably most important task of your life: To avert a DK-class invasion-scenario. You are our first, and probably last bastion against a superior enemy. Withstand until reinforcements arrive and fight the enemy back with them! The O4-Council and I are putting all our hope in you.
> 
> < END OF PROTOCOL >

O4-1 informs O5. In an expedited procedure under the consultation of the Ethics Committee, they release an early version of protocol ``Ragnarök'' as a last resort. O5 commences preparations and instructs O4 to put all close sites under lockdown and to mobilize their MTFs. The team of Dr. Schmieder in Room ᚾ2 has been able to open the hatch in the meantime, and the team as well as Dipl. Ing. Gretenkordt is examining SCP-028-DE-B, which seems to be in some sort of standby mode and does not emit radiation.

The following are the events after the expiration of Major Armbruster's ultimatum:

> < START OF PROTOCOL >
> 
> //Major Armbruster is giving orders, whereupon two teams start applying a mass that seems similar to modeling-clay to the armored doors in the form of a rectangle. It is assumed that these are explosive cutting-charges.//
> 
> **Lt. Yilmaz via radio:** Lieutenant Yilmaz to 8-Gustav, looks like they are preparing to breach at both armored doors.
> 
> **Cpt. Franz via radio:** Understood. We are opening the left door. 4-Karl, you go to the right! On my mark, Squad 2 charges into the room, You follow, flank them and go through the portal. All forces, prepare yourself! Reinforcements in circa 13 minutes.
> 
> //The Reaction Forces are taking position as the left armored door is opening slowly. The troops of the SKP are behind cover. From the control room, a soldier behind the cover can be seen as he prepares a rocket launcher.//
> 
> **Lt. Yilmaz via radio:** Yilmaz to 8-Gustav, rocket launcher in the middle of the cover.
> 
> **Cpt. Franz:** Understood. Grenade throwers, prepare a frag volley at the center of the emplacement.
> 
> //The armored door has opened so far that firing would be possible. The forces of the SKP are still behind cover. The soldier with the rocket launcher changes the position.//
> 
> **Lt. Yilmaz via radio:** Rocket launcher changes position to the left, seen from your position.
> 
> //Major Armbruster is waving a solder to come closer, who appears to be armed with a DMR[[footnote]]Designated Marksman Rifle, a marksman rifle for medium distance, often with a larger caliber than assault rifles.[[/footnote]], points at Leutnant Yilmaz behind the reinforced window of the control room, who does not take notice. The soldier sets his rifle up a box and aims at Leutnant Yilmaz. Major Armstrong speaks something into his radio, the soldier with the rocket launcher changes position. As Lieutenant Yilmaz lifts the mouthpiece of the radio, the marksman fires one shot which pierces through the reinforced window and explodes in Yilmaz's head. The soldier with the rocket launcher leaves cover and fires the rocket, the Reaction Forces open fire at the emplacement with rifle grenades.//
> 
> //The rocket explodes in the air behind the first cover of the Reaction Forces into a hail of shrapnel. Most of the troops in that position and half of Squad 1 of MTF DE8-𝔊 are killed or wounded. The rifle grenades explode on or behind the enemy position, though do nearly no damage to the barricade. The shrapnels of the grenades exploding behind the barricade are claiming a few victims, but the shrapnels seem not to be able to pierce through the enemy body armor.//
> 
> **Cpt. Franz:** Switch to HE grenades, MG, suppressive fire!
> 
> //While two medics are crawling through the position to get to the wounded, two MG gunners are emplacing their MG5 and maintain fire readiness.//
> 
> //The rocket thrower soldier has reloaded and changed the position. On a gesture of Major Armbruster, multiple attackers are firing unaimed over their cover. The rocked thrower soldier is leaving his cover and is immediately fired on by the MGs but manages to fire a second rocket before he collapses wounded. The rocket hits into the concrete ceiling of the corridor in front of the first position and cannot spread its shrapnels as far as the first one. Nonetheless, the medics who have reached the first position and the survivors of the first rocket are being killed and additional are wounded.//
> 
> **Cpt. Franz:** Grenades, fire!
> 
> //The high explosive grenades are having a visibly bigger impact on the barricade of the invaders than the frag grenades. A part of the barricade tips over and buries some soldiers. Others are seemingly wounded by the blast wave.//
>

In opposition to yours, our world is at peace since the end of the war in the 50th. No local conflicts which are escalated into regional civil wars by superpowers. No capitalism, no communism. Health, welfare and educational systems that do not only exist by name but are really social. No unemployment. No epidemics. Just peace and wealth for everyone. We do not seek to conquer you, we seek to liberate you. From the yoke of your capital-elitarian suppressors. If you lay down your arms now, I swear to you, no one of you is harmed.

The following is a transcript of recordings from MTF DE4-𝔎 from reality U-3378-DE. After crossing the portal, the radio technician of the MTF has dropped an unsuspicious sender which is live transmitting the recordings of all body cameras as well as radio and transfers them through the portal by broadband infrared signals. All cameras in room ᚠ are able to receive these signals and to direct them to the central memory unit.

> < START OF PROTOCOL >
> 
> //The MTF has reached U-3378-DE without casualties. Room ᚠ here is not painted white but pale green, on the wall opposite of the control room, the logo of the SKP is painted, and over the control room is a modern variant of the Reichsadler with Hakenkreuz. The portal is surrounded by a spherical framework with ca. Ø20 m, which holds a large number of unidentified devices. The armored doors of this room are closed, through the window of the control room a person that looks like Doctor Wiesmann can be seen. In the room, individuals wearing light grey overalls are multiple, which seem to be technical personnel. MTF DE4-𝔎 opens fire immediately and kills everyone present.//
> 
> **Cpt. Rüberg:** What is that thing? A portal-generator?
> 
> **MTF DE4-𝔎/4:** Well, I guess there is only one way to find out...
> 
> //MTF DE4-𝔎/4, the engineer of the team, pulls a cordless screwdriver from his backpack, removes the screws from one of the devices, rips the cables out and throws it through the portal.//
> 
> **Dr. Wiesmann (U-3378-DE) via site intercom:** Is that how you behave as guests?
> 
> //MTF DE4-𝔎/4 is making a rude gesture towards the control room.//
> 
> **Cpt. Rüberg:** Fuck it, place the charges. The rest provides cover.
> 
> //MTF DE4-𝔎/7, the demolition expert of the team, and MTF DE4-𝔎/8 begin to plant charges in different locations of the framework, and to connect them to a wireless detonator. Meanwhile, an armored door opens - significantly faster than those in Site-DE3 - and a group of armed men charges into the room. Both groups are immediately opening fire upon each other. Thanks to their elite training, MTF DE4-𝔎 can quickly eliminate the defenders, though not without suffering casualties, among them demolition expert MTF DE4-𝔎/7. Cpt. Rüberg leaves the detonator near the framework, so possible advancing own troops do not have to search for it and proceed through the open armored door deeper into the facility. They encounter only low resistance, the invaders under the command of Major Armbruster seem to be the Reaction Forces of the site, while remaining and inferior equipped forces seem to be normal security personnel. They quickly reach the control room which is secured by a code lock; the code is the same as in the known reality though. Without hesitating, MTF DE4-𝔎 terminates the guards, Dr. Wiesmann, Dr. Meier, Dipl. Ing. Gretenkordt as well as Lt. Yilmaz who in opposition to the other forces does not wear a light grey but a sand-colored uniform with insignia that appear to be of the Ottoman Empire.//
> 
> **MTF DE4-𝔎/2:** Dude, how crazy is it that they have the same people here? Do you think we will meet ourselves here?
> 
> **Cpt. Rüberg:** I would rather not. Do the controls tell you anything?
> 
> **MTF DE4-𝔎/2:** No, the fuckers have locked the controls before we shot them. No time to search for passwords.
> 
> **Cpt. Rüberg:** Plant a charge and then we proceed to Naudis 2.
> 
> //MTF DE4-𝔎/8 plants the charge on the controls and connects it with a second detonator. The MTF proceeds to Naudis 2 and kills the guards.//
> 
> **MTF DE4-𝔎/3:** Man, shit. The hatch is locked, same as back home!
> 
> **Cpt. Rüberg:** Then place the rest of the charges, maybe it's enough.
> 
> //MTF DE4-𝔎/8 places the remaining charges and connects them to the detonator.//
> 
> **Cpt. Rüberg:** And off we go! Back to room Fehu. Then we blow their shit up!
> 
> //On the way back, MTF DE4-𝔎 runs into a large group of soldiers, seemingly a part of the reinforcements. They pull back into a side corridor, and while the biggest part of the troops proceed to Room ᚠ, a squat halts and follows them into the corridor.//
> 
> **Rüberg (U-3378-DE):** There they are, 4-Karl follow me! //To MTF DE4-𝔎:// We are MEK 4-𝔎, let us talk before we shoot each other.

> **Cpt. Rüberg:** Seriously? What the hell do you want to talk about?

> 
> **Cpt. Rüberg:** Are you shitting me? Man, first you invade our universe as conquerers, and you are coming with romantic shit like ``oh - I'm meeting myself from another world - I must gabble instead of shooting''!? Fuck you man!
> 
> //Cpt. Rüberg yanks his gun up and shoots his equivalent through the open visor of his helmet. MTF DE4-𝔎 and MEK 4-𝔎 are opening fire upon each other, and thanks to the numerical superiority and better equipment of their opponents, MTF DE4-𝔎 is being eliminated while MEK 4-𝔎 suffers no further casualties.//
> 
> //Through the camera of MTF DE4-𝔎/2 who lays on the floor, a squad in Tactical Power Armor can be seen, walking past the corridor towards Room ᚠ.//
> 
> < END OF PROTOCOL >

Around the time as MTF DE4-𝔎 enters the control room in U-3378-DE, the reinforcements in form of MTF DE8-𝔅 and -ℭ arrive. MTF DE8-𝔅 is a heavy infantry unit of around 100 men with body armor and squads with ballistic shields. MTF DE8-ℭ is an armored unit with three armored vehicles with autocannons, a truck with a 105 mm cannon hidden on its load bed, as well as a squad equipped with the newly introduced Tactical Power Armor, it's supply squad and supporting heavy infantry.

The following is a transcript of the recordings from room ᚾ2, in which the technical-scientific squad of MTF DE8-𝔊 is working, at the time the ultimatum of Major Armbruster is running out (15 minutes before the reinforcements arrive):

> < START OF PROTOCOL >
> 
> //In room ᚾ2, there are the technical-scientific squad of MTF DE8-𝔊 led by Dr. Schmieder, Dipl. Ing. Gretenkordt and a team of guards of Site-DE3. The squad has opened the hatch in the floor and Dr. Schmieder, Dipl. Ing. Gretenkordt as well as two other members of the technical-scientific squad have entered the low room and are examining SCP-028-DE-B.//
> 
> **Gretenkordt:** So, do you have a clue what that thing is, Doctor Reality?
> 
> **Dr. Schmieder:** How dare you!
> 
> **Gretenkordt:** Sorry. Doctor Schmieder.
> 
> **Dr. Schmieder:** Better... To answer your question, yes, I have. Your original assumption that this is some sort of early Scranton Reality Anchor is correct in general, but to be more precise it is only working like an SRA. To make it short, there is a measure for reality, the Hume. The reality usually is around 20 Hm. The more hume, the more stable the reality. The abilities of reality benders are usually based on changing the measure of reality in themselves or their surroundings, and to change the reality according to their will. SRAs are machines that add or remove reality from dead or empty universes, to create fields of stable reality, usually at about 20 Hm. This device here is working similarly, but it also is an interareal transmitter. The dome seems to be the cover of a parabolic dish, with which the device is focussing its effect on one point.
> 
> //Noise of battle can be heard from Room ᚠ.//
> 
> **Gretenkordt:** Ok, but do you have an idea if we can use it?
> 
> **Dr. Schmieder:** That depends on whether my assumption about how it works is correct. I assume that it starts with a search for the right frequency, which is why it has covered the whole electromagnetic spectrum. To be able to send intrareal, it probably has created a minimally small zone of extremely low reality in a defined point, through which the radiation can leave our universe and enter another universe with a similar zone of extremely low reality within reach, to establish communication. I assume it was originally built to send aimlessly into the ``intrareal space'', as like we are sending messages aimlessly into space to see if someone answers. In the universe now standing wide open down there, they probably have built the same device which has still been in operation. They must have known that we exist and maybe just have waited for us to send. Then they have sent a signal back and this device has enlarged the zone of low reality in synchronization with theirs. They must have another apparatus there to stabilize the low-reality zone into a portal.
> 
> **Gretenkordt:** Do you think this device can raise the reality instead of lowering it?
> 
> **Dr. Schmieder:** Yes I do, and I think that is our only chance to end this. And as this old device does not have digital controls, it should be enough to rewire it a bit.
> 
> //It takes approximately 20 minutes to make the modifications. The reinforcements have arrived on both sides and are engaged in a fierce battle. The SKP is using it's Tactical Power Armor to secure Room ᚠ while those of the Foundation and the troops in front of them with ballistic shields are forming moveable barricades in the corridors and are supporting the troops with their heavy weapons. Thanks to the nano-coated armor of the Tactical Power Armor, they are extremely well protected against fire from most weapons.//
> 
> //As the troops of the SKP are pushed back to Room ᚠ, a firefight between the Power Armored squads of both sides breaks loose, which seems to be coequal, though the battle involves heavy losses among the infantry. From SCP-028-DE-C, more troops of the SKP push through while troops of the Foundation are advancing from the corridors. More MTFs and Reaction Forces from close facilities are on their way to Site-DE3. The early version of protocol ``Ragnarök'' is ready for execution.//
> 
> **Dr. Schmieder via radio:** This is Doctor Schmieder of MTF DE8-Gustav to mission control; come in, please!
> 
> **Mission control via radio:** This is  Major Peters, mission control. You are the reality expert, right?
> 
> **Dr. Schmieder via radio:** Correct, Major, I think we have a chance to destabilize the portal, but there must be a machine or device on the other side, holding the portal open. Let your troops search and destroy it!
> 
> **Mission control via radio:** There is something, indeed. Some sort of framework around the portal. Is that what you mean?
> 
> **Dr. Schmieder via radio:** That is hard to say without having seen it, but in absence of options I have to say yes. Have it destroyed.
> 
> //From the transmission of MTF DE4-𝔎 it is known that there have been charges planted on the framework and that the detonator may still be laying there. The Tactical Power Armor squad is ordered to recover the detonator, to detonate the charges without detonator or to destroy the devices with their heavy weapons.//
> 
> //The Tactical Power Armor squad manages to advance through the portal, followed by the Power Armors of the SKP. The detonator is nowhere to be found, and the charges have been removed, though they are still in a crate in the room. The troops of the Foundation can move the crate with the charges to the middle of the room and detonate it with direct fire.//
> 
> //The machinery around SCP-028-DE-C is damaged and breaks down. However, the portal does not collapse but it ``bursts'' and suddenly expands to a diameter of ca. Ø50 m. It does not seem to have a defined ``hull'' and appears to taper off gradually. Within the affected zone, the reality seems to be undefined. Personnel reports, that both realities are perceived alternating and that the perception can change after blinking or a fast turn. All personnel in the affected zone seem to exist in both universes at the same time and are visible on all cameras (some live-feeds from cameras of the SKP can be recorded now due to overlapping cables). In opposition, inanimate objects apparently stay in ``their'' universes. Electromagnetic signals appear to exist in both realities.//
> 
> //Guards of the SKP appear in Room ᚾ2 and are overpowered. Everywhere in the corridors personnel of the SKP appears, and heavy fights break loose.//
> 
> **Dr. Schmieder:** //Is visibly startled.// What the hell... where does that control board come from?
> 
> //Dr. Schmieder’s shoulder camera is in the normal universe and no control board is visible.//
> 
> **Gretenkordt:** What control board?
> 
> **Dr. Schmieder:** Wait, you do not see a control board there?
> 
> **Gretenkordt:** No!? Doctor, what is going on? And where did those guys come from?
> 
> **Dr. Schmieder:** You are asking questions... if I interpret the boom-sound correctly, the MTFs have blown something up and I would assume it was the portal stabilizing device. I do not know how it works, but I think we are inside the portal. Without the stabilization, both universes seem to exist coincidentally. We are now threatened by a Universe-conjunction, multiple universes merging to one, and therewith a permanent transition, or a hole that devours both universes. Both are to be prevented, so I suggest we start the device here and hope it reestablishes reality.
> 
> //Dr. Schmieder is starting up SCP-028-DE-B. It begins searching.//
> 
> **Dr. Schmieder via radio:** Schmieder to mission control, I highly advise to protect the device in Naudis 2 with utmost priority! And nobody shall leave the anomaly! I repeat: The anomaly must //not// be left!
> 
> **Mission control via radio:** Mission control understands. Stay there and hold your ground.
> 
> //As not required troops are withdrawn and partly are send to protect room ᚾ2, the remaining heavy and armored units are engaging the troops of the SKP in stationary combat in Room ᚠ, also to distract them from the dome. Major Armbruster of the SKP has been killed by a Tactical Power Armor in melee combat.//
> 
> //SCP-028-DE-B is running through the spectrum of visible light and reaches and focusses on hard X-radiation. Apparently, its equivalent from U-3378-DE (SCP-028-DE-B-1) is responding automatically, and as this is lowering the measure of reality, the SCP-028-DE-B on this side is raising reality. The imbalance seems to have a negative impact on the universe U-3378-DE, as the camera feeds received from there are showing an expansion of the anomaly, while it is contracting on this side.//
> 
> //The expansion of the anomaly appears to be detected by some security systems, as it seems that SCP-028-DE-B-1 is switched and now also is stabilizing the reality, otherwise it assumably would have come to a reality collapse in U-3378-DE.//
> 
> **Dr. Schmieder via non-encrypted radio:** Dr. Schmieder to all units: The anomaly is closing, seize fire and do as I say if you do not want to end up in the wrong universe!
> 
> //The units of both sides are seizing fire hesitantly and are taking cover. Mission control decides not to intervene.//
> 
> **Dr. Schmieder via non-encrypted radio:** You surely have noticed, that sometimes you are perceiving this universe, sometimes that. I cannot guarantee that my theory works, but I do not have a better one. I assume you always are existing in the universe you are seeing. At least that would explain the function of a spatial portal. When the boundary of the anomaly is approaching you, blink before it reaches you until you see the desired reality. Keep your eyes open as long as possible and avoid all movement. The boundary of the anomaly is fluxionary; you will not notice when you are through. If you manage to blink in the wrong moment, you might be facing much more dire consequences than ``just'' ending up in the wrong universe: Eternal agony in the void between the worlds.

Most troops managed to return to ``their'' universe, though █ members of the SKP remained and were arrested for thorough questioning. The Foundation has lost █ members in U-3378-DE; they are regarded as MIA. Personnel whose equivalent from U-3378-DE are stranded in ``our'' universe have been amnestized accordingly to prevent them from trying to establish contact.

The equipment of the forces of the SKP has been examined in detail. Most military equipment, as well as their Tactical Power Armor, was manufactured by the company ``Richter und Thiel Industriegesellschaft mbH'', which by name and logo seems to be an equivalent of the Group of Interest Raptor Tec. Industries.

On the same day, Scranton Reality Anchors have been flown in from the USA and taken into operation. SCP-028-DE-B has been analyzed, but no new technology could be derived from it. It was dismantled and is now stored on Site-DE██. According to analyses the device which was removed from the framework around SCP-028-DE-C and had been thrown through it by MTF DE4-𝔎, belongs to a cluster of emitters similar to Scranton Reality Buoys, that generate a spherical field to stabilize SCP-028-DE-C. They are compressing the portal until it takes a spherical form with a ``stable'' outer hull, similar to a gas that is liquified by pressure.

SCP-028-DE-C has been closed but did not disappear. It still exists as an anomaly of extremely low reality with a size of a few picometers, through which very weak X-radiation intrudes permanently since six months after Incident 028-DE/I2. It is yet unknown if and how the anomaly can be closed completely.

The currently effective Special Containment Procedures have been established based on insights derived from the recordings and captured documents of this incident.

> As the SKP still exists in U-3378-DE, we can assume that the Nazis have won in that universe. And apparently, their universe is not enough for them, as they seem to want to bless us with their presence. I do not have to explain to you why we do not want that.
> 
> This portal they tried to open is not just a transition from here to there. It is an anchor. An anchor they are throwing from their world to ours. Should they succeed they will get a stable and, according to our knowledge, irreversible connection, big enough that troops, tanks, and other war machinery can pass. And we can do nothing against it. We know that they are technologically superior to us. We know that they are using anomalies as naturally as we use socks and underpants. They are not some alien invaders from a bad movie, whom we can trick with human deficiencies. They are humans like us, just better.

**Additional Containment Procedures::** Located in the main hall (Room ᚠ) is a two-section mobile platform. Each section has a size of 6 × 4 m. They are electromagnetically connected on the long sides (resulting in a size of 6 × 8 m combined). The section facing the center of the room hereafter is designated as Platform 1, the aft section as Platform 2. Both platforms and their superstructures are armored against gunfire up to explosive grenades caliber 40 mm.

Platform 1 has no own propulsion and its wheels are blocked automatically when it is disconnected. Platform 1 carries an Impulse-Hume-Emitter (IHE 1505) with an output of 15 Hm per pulse and a frequency of 0.5 Hz. It is powered by a constantly fully loaded fusion-accumulator, holding enough power for 20 pulses.

Platform 2 contains the engine of the platforms as well as controls, electronics, and an armored pillbox with shooting slits and grenade machine guns in armored ball casings. This platform carries 8 SRAs in an even arrangement.

Under normal conditions, all SRAs in Room ᚠ are offline and are sequentially started in test-mode daily, as well as the electronics of the IHE and the platforms. All damage and malfunctions are to be eliminated instantly with utmost priority. The ignition mechanism of the IHE is in possession by the site-director.

**Preparation of protocol ``Mjölnir'':** Upon transmission of the codeword ``Heimdall'', the installation described above is put into standby and the 36 SRAs around SCP-028-DE-C are to be started up to normal operation. The site-director hands the ignition mechanism over to the reality-expert on duty, who installs it into the IHE. The Reaction-Forces are ingesting the memetic agent W04178/A (W04178/A is a memetically active methamphetamine that, in addition to the normal effect of methamphetamine, suppresses the ability to feel fear and increases the obedience). They man Platform 2 and establish readiness to fire. All personnel not necessary is evacuated from Room ᚠ and the armored doors are locked.

**Execution of protocol ``Mjölnir'':** This protocol must be executed exactly as described below:
# The Reaction-Forces are ordered to open fire on all hostile forces. The grenade launchers must not open fire yet to not damage the facility, except it is unavoidable for the successful execution of the protocol.
# The 36 SRAs around SCP-028-DE-C are throttled to 80% output.
# The combined platform drives through SCP-028-DE-C and in there 10 m farther.
# As soon as SCP-028-DE-C is crossed, the Reaction-Forces fire the grenade launchers at the SCP-028-DE-D.
# Once the platform has reached its target, Platform 1 is disconnected.
# Platform 2 drives backward through SCP-028-DE-C at top speed.
# As soon as Platform 2 has left SCP-028-DE-C it gives a signal to Platform 1 via infrared lights.
# The output of the 36 SRAs around SCP-028-DE-C is increased to 100%.
# Exactly 2 seconds after Platform 2 has given the signal, Platform 2 quick-starts its SRAs to 200% output. The probability that SCP-028-DE-C thereby is closed is approximately 82%.
# 0.5 s after SCP-028-DE-C is confirmed to be closed, the IHE 1505 is triggered. As a result, U-3378-DE is overloaded by up to 300 Hm in an area of 8 km, which causes it to ``solidify'' and become unstable. In case that SCP-028-DE-C, in opposition to the readings, has not been closed then, the effect will also occur here, though only within 3 km around SCP-028-DE.

If Platform 2 does not manage to leave SCP-028-DE-C within 60 seconds after entering U-3378-DE, article 8 becomes effective anyway and Platform 2 is trapped in U-3378-DE. Therefore, the Reaction-Forces are allowed to abandon the platform and try to return on foot.

Should the IHE 1505 not be fired, destroyed before being fired or it does not have the expected result, Protocol “Ragnarök” [clearance level 4/O4 required] is to be executed.

Protocol ``Ragnarök'' is the last resort to prevent a DK-Class-Invasion-Scenario. Under the guise of nuclear sharing armies of many allies of the USA, and disguised as a measure of deterrence from the cold war, are taking part in a Foundation-wide project to station nuclear weapons in countries were equipping the Foundation's facilities with nuclear warheads is complicated for political or logistical reasons.

In Germany, the TaktLwG 33 (Tactical Air Force Wing 33) in the Büchel Air Base (Site-DE20) is the only wing of the Luftwaffe that still takes part in nuclear sharing. Its pilots are made obedient with a memetic agent and the staff of the base's HQ consists of agents of the Foundation. Upon transmission of the codeword ``Heimdall'', the TaktLwG 33 loads four (4) Tornado IDS fighter-bombers with one (1) B61 Mod 11 nuclear bomb each (a bunker buster, able to penetrate Site-DE3's structure). The planes then fly to a stand-by position over SCP-028-DE.

As the execution of ``Ragnarök'' is ordered, all bombers drop their bomb on SCP-028-DE and depart. The number of immediate casualties is presumed to exceed 135,000 due to the proximity to an urban center.

It is assumed that SCP-028-DE-C and -D are therewith destroyed and Room ᚠ is buried. If not, we can only hope that O5 has something up their sleeves that is so terrible that it justifies the death of hundred-thousands.

During the initiating universe-conjunction in the course of incident #028-DE/I2, and a following unilateral attempt from U-3378-DE to open SCP-028-DE-C, the WiFis of both facilities connected due to overlapping frequencies and encoding. While the network of SCP-028-DE (Site-DE3) was disconnected from the intranet of the Foundation, and no sensitive data has been transferred, a large portion of the SKP's database as well as several data from the internet there have been downloaded and saved due to the fast reaction of a local IT-technician, particularly SKP-028 (effective 11 months after incident #028-DE/I2), apparently the equivalent of SCP-028-DE in the universe U-3378-DE. Many anomalous objects in containment by the Foundation also exist in U-3378-DE, however often are often contained under different circumstances like [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/skp-173-us SKP-173-US], or have been destroyed, should the SKP have found them too dangerous or without use for them.
