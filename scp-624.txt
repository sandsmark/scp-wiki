**Item #:** SCP-624

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-624 is to be stored in Site ██'s safe storage room and charged frequently by testing personnel. Testing is open to all Site ██ personnel with proper clearance. Personal access to SCP-624 is otherwise restricted. SCP-624 is not to be taken off of Site ██ unless in the event of an emergency.

SCP-624 must be listened to through regular headphones before being played on regular speakers. SCP-624 is not to be played at Site ██’s social functions for entertainment due to containment protocol and possible risk of humiliation of Site ██ personnel. 

Audio created by SCP-624 is not to be sold commercially, nor shared through filesharing networks.  

**Description:** SCP-624 is a Sandisk Sansa e200R Mp3 player and voice recorder. The back of the player says SCP-624 contains two (2) gigabytes of memory. Although the original owner’s manual claims there are pre-loaded sample songs, there are no files stored within its memory when played on normal speakers. Uploading music to SCP-624 seems to be impossible, as every program tested, including iTunes, Rhapsody, and Yahoo! Music, have all returned with encoding errors.

When powering up SCP-624 through headphones, a tone will play, and this tone will be picked up through SCP-624’s microphone. If SCP-624 does not detect the tone, or if SCP-624 is powered up through normal speakers, it will shut down as if it were locked. If SCP-624 detects the tone, SCP-624 automatically fills its library with two gigabytes worth of music. The music, in question, is all written, produced, played, and sung by the wearer of the headphones, regardless of current musical talent. Each song comes with an appropriate album cover and the listener’s artist profile, which is factually incorrect, possibly based on an alternate timeline if the listener had become a full-time musician.

When exposed to the musically inclined, SCP-624 will generate specific songs or improve songs they may have already written. When exposed to test subjects with little to no musical experience, SCP-624 will generate music based on their favorite music influences, regardless if they like the generated music or not. These songs tend to be very consistent to the listener, but more songs are added based on musical influences. If space runs out when the listener is introduced to a new musical influence, the listener’s least favorite songs are replaced. When shut down, the songs are subsequently deleted until SCP-624 is introduced to the listener once more. 

Once powered up through headphones, the listener may unplug his or her headphones and connect SCP-624 to normal speakers. The audio files themselves cannot be transferred, but can be dubbed onto a separate recording device. 

**SCP-624 Test Log:**

**Subject:** Dr. Z████████.
**Artist Profile:** “Spaztique Explosive formed in the early 2000s, combing punk, classical music, and electronica. Has toured with such bands as Mindless Self Indulgence, Bjork, and Goldfrapp. Lead singer D████ Z████████ died in 20██ due to ███████ addiction and was replaced by Ian Watkins of lostprophets fame.
**Music Results:** Music is very eclectic, ranging from fast-paced electronic punk to slower orchestral pieces. Lyrics are very precise and concrete. Most songs range between three to five minutes. Dr. Z████████’s playlist contains four hundred and one (401) tracks. Subject appeared to be very pleased with the results.
**Subject Comments:** //This all sounds far better than anything I’ve made in real life, and... Wait. I die of a ███████ overdose?!//

**Subject:** Agent S██████
**Artist Profile:** The Frank S██████ Experience first exploded onto the scenes in the late 60s, replacing Jimi Hendrix during Woodstock 69. Frank S██████’s first band, Superloverboy, broke up after creative differences. Frank S██████ went on to replace Jason Newsted of Metallica.
**Music Results:** Music is mostly psychedelic rock, akin to Jimi Hendrix or Cream, but also ranges to music akin to Pink Floyd and Neil-Peart-era Rush. Lyrics tend to be very abstract, save for a few love songs and sci-fi prog-rock epics. Because of their lengthy nature, ranging from eight to thirty minutes, there are only a hundred and six (106) tracks. Subject was amused, but mildly disappointed at the same time. 
**Subject Comments:** //I’d make this? No way. I know there’s a limit on how many Fuzz pedals you can use, and I would never use that much reverb or flange... Ok, maybe just a little, but on every song? Please!//

**Subject:** Subject D-256
**Artist Profile:** Death[EXPLETIVE REDACTED] 9000k began their rise to infamy after their deadly set at Hellfest 03, resulting in several injuries and one recorded death. Death[EXPLETIVE REDACTED] 9000k’s lineup includes two drummers, two bassists, three rhythm guitarists, and two lead guitarists. Death[EXPLETIVE REDACTED] 9000k’s original lead singer, H████ R████████, committed suicide by gunshot wound on stage during their “[EXPLETIVE REDACTED] Tour 20██”.
**Music Results:** Music is extremely loud and very brutal, lasting between five (5) to forty five (45) seconds, resulting in more than a thousand (1000+) tracks. A common trend among these tracks are atonal noise, screaming, cursing, and sounds from movie clips. The lyrics mostly concern violence, rape, murder, [DATA EXPUNGED], and child [REDACTED]. Subject was very pleased with the results and requested a personal copy of the created music. This request was denied.
**Subject Comments:** //[EXPLETIVE REDACTED] yeah! This is awesome!//

//**Note:** Further testing encouraged by all Site ██ personnel. --A "Best of" soundtrack is currently being compiled to boost morale among researchers.-- -Dr. Z████████//

//**Note:** SCP-624 is not a toy. All testing of SCP-624 should be for research only, in order to inspect SCP-624's range of abilities. -Dr. D███, Level 4 Security//

**Subject:** The Fishmonger
**Artist Profile:** Many claim that The Famous Petroleum Safety Authority Players of Norway never rose above their seminal debut album, "Straton of Sardis," but it bears noting that the seventeen-man band hung on for nearly forty-odd years, touring the milk-rock circuit with such luminaries as National Ski Patrol, SP-62 and Kojiro Station.
**Music Results:** Milk-rock, it seems, is not unlike an amalgam of juice-rock and soda-rock, with just a touch of salt-rock thrown in for the drum solos.
**Subject Comments:** //I was rather hoping no one would find this.//

**Subject:** Dr. Clef
**Artist Profile:** The only musician, to this date, to pioneer the genre of "classical snuff," "Symphony Number 2 in B Minor for Orchestra and Firing Squad" is considered a powerful, avant-garde expression of the futility of human existence by those listeners who have endured the entire work. The artist's first work, "Symphony Number 1 in A Major for Orchestra and Abbatoir," was notorious for being recorded in China, where animal cruelty laws are more lax than in the Western World, and for using the dying vocalizations of tortured small animals as a counterpoint to the delicately arranged orchestral portion. The second and final symphony by this composer ups the ante by using the terrified and pained screams of condemned prisoners being executed and tortured to death by trained professionals, accentuated by the use of the handgun, scalpel, and poison gas in rhythmic fashion. The final movement, the "Allegro," is the first piece of classical music to require the execution of its own conductor as, following a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, the composer's own dying spasms provide the final percussion tempo to the slow, dirgelike ending played by a single cello.
**Music Results:** Everything that it says in the liner notes.
**Subject Comments:** //The digital recording loses some nuance. It sounds much better on vinyl.//

**Subject:** Dr. D███, Level 4 Security
**Artist Profile:** M███ D███ did not invent the fart joke, but he certainly improved on it. Associated with such names as Adam Sandler and Bill Hicks, M███ D███ has been featured on such shows as Saturday Night Live and MadTV for his talents in stand-up and comic song. M███ D███ wrote and directed the 20██ summer flop "[REDACTED] Movie", unanimously rated as the "Worst Movie of All Time".
**Music Results:** Mostly low-brow stand-up and lewd acoustic guitar songs. Most tracks concern typical family problems, bodily functions, sex, and politics. Subject was visibly angry at the results.
**Subject Comments:** //Not funny...//

//**Note:** It seems SCP-624 isn't limited to specific genres of music, but the scope of the listener's imagination. A separate test log may be needed for further testing. Again, I am to remind all Site ██ personnel that all access to SCP-624 is strictly for experimental purposes only, and that SCP-624 is not to be played in the Site ██ break room... --for now--...  -Dr. Z████████//

//**Note:** Dr. Z████████, I think you mean, "is not to be played in the Site ██ break room __ever__, and under the penalty of demotion if you do." -Dr. D███, Level 4 Security//

**Subject:** Agent Leroy Fiedler
**Artist Profile:** Though limited to the debut album "The Cutting Edge Of Cliche" and innumerable white label mixes, Source Data, the main project of producer Leroy Fiedler, remains a mainstay on the deejay circuit. Pioneering the genre of "emodium" (a portmanteau of "emo" and "IDM"; often heckled for being phonetically similar to the brand name of an anti-diarrheal), the well-penned, expressive lyrics of such songs as "Summer in Rochemelon" and "The Paradox of Choice" are evidence enough that Fiedler is no mere fetishistic knob-twiddler; even so, the hyperdistorted onslaught of drillcore tracks such as "Hydraulic Splitter" prove that he does know his way around a mixing console. At its best, Source Data combines elements from both schools of thought, such as on the achingly poignant "Oripavine," an epic ballad written as a eulogy for Fiedler's late girlfriend who overdosed on the toxic opiate.
**Music Results:** Generally, tracks are electronic in nature, exhibiting a combination of highly melodic structures with elaborate chord progressions, sometimes bordering on prog-rock sensibilities; the exceptions are the two or three tracks meant for the dance floor, in which complex rhythmic structures are the dominant force. In both cases, the music is clearly based in some raw, visceral emotional response, be it joy, anger, sorrow, or something else. These base production techniques are expounded upon by a distinct lyrical sensibility that treads a peculiar line between the boy-next-door sensitivity of Death Cab For Cutie and the stream-of-consciousness complexity of Aesop Rock.
**Subject Comments:** //But I don't even __like__ techno!//
