**Item #:** SCP-624

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-624 is to be stored in Dr. Z████████’s personal office and charged from his computer.  Access to SCP-624 may be through Dr. Z████████’s permission, but can be overridden by Level 4 Security if seen fit. SCP-624 is not to be taken off of Site ██ unless in the event of an emergency. 

SCP-624 must be listened to through regular headphones before being played on regular speakers. SCP-624 is not to be played at Site ██’s social functions without permission due to the threat of public humiliation of Site ██ personnel.

Audio created by SCP-624 is not to be sold commercially, nor shared through filesharing networks.  

**Description:** SCP-624 is a Sandisk Sansa e200R Mp3 player and voice recorder. The back of the player says SCP-624 contains two (2) gigabytes of memory. Although the original owner’s manual claims there are pre-loaded sample songs, there are no files stored within its memory when played on normal speakers. Uploading music to SCP-624 seems to be impossible, as every program tested, including iTunes, Rhapsody, and Yahoo! Music, have all returned with encoding errors.

When powering up SCP-624 through headphones, a tone will play, and this tone will be picked up through SCP-624’s microphone. If SCP-624 does not detect the tone, it will shut down as if it were locked. If SCP-624 detects the tone, SCP-624 automatically fills its library with two gigabytes worth of music. The music, in question, is all written, produced, played, and sung by the wearer of the headphones, regardless of talent. Each song comes with an appropriate album cover and the listener’s artist profile, which is factually incorrect, possibly based on an alternate timeline if the listener had become a full-time musician. These songs tend to be very consistent to the listener, but more songs are added based on musical influences. If space runs out when the listener is introduced to a new musical influence, the listener’s least favorite songs are replaced. When shut down, the songs are subsequently deleted until SCP-624 is introduced to the listener once more. 

Once powered up through headphones, the listener may unplug his or her headphones and connect SCP-624 to normal speakers. The audio files themselves cannot be transferred, but can be dubbed onto a separate recording device. 

**SCP-624 Test Log:**

**Subject:** Dr. Z████████.
**Artist Profile:** “Spaztique Explosive formed in the early 2000s, combing punk, classical music, and electronica. Has toured with such bands as Mindless Self Indulgence, Bjork, and Goldfrapp. Lead singer D████ Z████████ died in 20██ due to ███████ addiction and was replaced by Ian Watkins of lostprophets fame.
**Music Results:** Music is very eclectic, ranging from fast-paced electronic punk to slower orchestral pieces. Lyrics are very precise and concrete. Most songs range between three to five minutes. Dr. Z████████’s playlist contains four hundred and one (401) tracks. Subject appeared to be very pleased with the results.
**Subject Comments:** //This all sounds far better than anything I’m making right now in real life, and as much as I don’t want to die, I’m torn between living as a small-time musician or dying of a ███████ overdose so Ian Watkins can replace me.//

**Subject:** Agent S██████
**Artist Profile:** The Frank S██████ Experience first exploded onto the scenes in the late 60s, replacing Jimi Hendrix during Woodstock 69. Frank S██████’s first band, Superloverboy, broke up after creative differences. Frank S██████ went on to replace Jason Newsted of Metallica.
**Music Results:** Music is mostly psychedelic rock, akin to Jimi Hendrix or Cream, but also ranges to music akin to Pink Floyd and Neil-Peart-era Rush. Lyrics tend to be very abstract, save for a few love songs and sci-fi prog-rock epics. Because of their lengthy nature, ranging from eight to thirty minutes, there are only a hundred and six (106) tracks. Subject was amused, but mildly disappointed at the same time. 
**Subject Comments:** //I’d make this? No way. I know there’s a limit on how many Fuzz pedals you can use, and I would never use that much reverb or flange... Ok, maybe just a little, but on every song? Please!//

**Subject: Subject D-256**
**Artist Profile:** Death[EXPLITIVE REDACTED] 9000k began their rise to infamy after their deadly set at Hellfest 03, resulting in several injuries and one recorded death. Death[EXPLITIVE REDACTED] 9000k’s lineup includes two drummers, two bassists, three rhythm guitarists, and two lead guitarists. Death[EXPLITIVE REDACTED] 9000k’s original lead singer, H████ R████████, committed suicide by gunshot wound on stage during their “[EXPLITIVE REDACTED] Tour 20██”.
**Music Results:** Music is extremely loud and very brutal, lasting between five (5) to forty five (45) seconds, resulting in more than a thousand (1000+) tracks. A common trend among these tracks are atonal noise, screaming, cussing, and sounds from movie clips. The lyrics mostly concern violence, rape, murder, [DATA EXPUNGED], and child [REDACTED]. Subject was very pleased with the results and requested a personal copy of the created music. This request was denied.
**Subject Comments:** //[EXPLITED REDACTED] yeah! This is awesome!//

//**Note:** Further testing encouraged by all Site ██ personnel. A "Best of" soundtrack is currently being compiled to boost morale among researchers. -Dr. Z████████//
