++++ **__Discovery__**
The Foundation became aware of SCP-5570 when a member of the Stevens family[[footnote]] Kyle Stevens (M 35), Evelyn Stevens (F 37), and Mike Stevens (M 7). [[/footnote]] contacted Shelby County Paranormal Investigations[[footnote]] A Foundation front-company based in Shelby County, Illinois.[[/footnote]]. The Stevens and their patrons reported multiple sightings of spectral entities throughout the hotel. This claim was corroborated through substantial video evidence. Special Investigation Team Charlie-14 ("Spooky Sleuths") was dispatched to assess the situation.

++++ **__UPDATE: Investigation Report__**
Temporary containment protocols were immediately established and SIT Charlie-14 members Cameron Monroe and Jerry Williams arrived to investigate SCP-5570. A brief interview was conducted prior to the initiation of the investigation.

[[collapsible show="● Interview Log ●" hide="○ Interview Log ○"]]
**Interviewer:** Investigative Agent Cameron Monroe
**Interviewed:** James Stevens
------
**[BEGIN LOG]**

**Monroe:** Okay, Mr. Stevens, I just have a few standard questions to ask you before we begin our actual investigation. Are you ready to begin?

**Stevens:** Yeah, I'm ready, ask away.

**Monroe:** Great. Your family consists of you, your wife Evelyn, and your son Michael, is that correct?

**Stevens:** Mike, his name's Mike; but yes, that's correct.

**Monroe:** And you've owned this property for 6 months? 

**Stevens:** Yes, though we just opened the hotel last month.

**Monroe:** Any information you can give me on the former owners?

**Stevens:** Her name was, Madam Creon, I think. The realtor told us she ran one of those psychic readings businesses. Supposedly she was the real deal, did  a bunch séances for people in the area. We even have a bunch of stuff she left in the basement of the hotel. You think that could have to do with everything going on?

**Monroe:** It's possible, but as I said these are just standard questions.

**Stevens:** Of course, I'm just, I'm at the end of my rope here. We spent months doing nothing but prepping to open and right after we do, all this starts.

**Monroe:** So have you and your family witnessed these... phenomena, or just your customers?

**Stevens:** My son was the first to see the ghosts. As you can guess, we didn't believe him at first. We thought he was just trying to get attention, because we've been so busy with getting ready for the opening. It wasn't until our first customers and my wife saw it, that's when I thought it could be more than Mike's vivid imagination.

**Monroe:** And have you yourself seen these... ghosts.

**Stevens:** Yes, I have– a few times now. Well– I've seen one, but I've heard them plenty.

**Monroe:** If you had to ballpark it, how many sightings, both auditory and visual, do you think you've had?

**Stevens:** Oh geez, I'd have to say a couple dozen in the last six months. It's gotten worse, I'm having people check out halfway through their first night, demanding a refund. I'm two months behind on the mortgage, if we don't figure this out, I just don't know what we'll do. 

**Monroe:** Understandable, your situation is not one many would envy, but hopefully, we're able to help. Just two more questions, Mr. Stevens. Have entities had any physical contact with your family or guests? Or any unexplained injuries?

**Stevens:** No, none that I'm aware of– knock on wood.

**Monroe:** And last but not least, are there any areas where the activity is especially high? 

**Stevens:** The main house hasn't had any, activity, the hotel is where it all happens, I can't say any one room in particular.

**Monroe:** Okay, Mr. Stevens, I think that's just about it. I'd like for you and your family to remain here in the main house while we conduct our preliminary investigation of the hotel.

Following the interview, the Agents entered the hotel to begin their investigation.

**__CAMERA ONE__**

//[ The camera activates. Agents Williams and Monroe are standing in front of a flight of stairs.]//

**Monroe:** Alright good, coms are working, camera's online. Let's get moving. You take the first floor; I'll take the second.

**Williams:** What's the plan when we find what we're looking for?

**Monroe:** I know this is your first case in the field but if you run into trouble **do not** try and rush in yourself. We're just here to investigate, we're not the ghostbusters.

**Williams:** You got it, boss.

**Monroe:** Do a full sweep and we'll meet back here to search the basement.

**Williams:** Okay sound li–

//[Agent Williams is interrupted by three loud knocks on the ceiling above.]//

**Unknown:** Leave now, leave now, **leave now**!

**Williams:** Shit, boss, sure does sound like the real deal.

**Monroe:** Just stick to the plan, okay.

//[Agent Monroe begins walking up the stairs.]//

**Monroe:** Second-floor landing is clear, EMF and GAD[[footnote]]General Analysis Device.[[/footnote]] aren't picking up any activity.

**Williams:** Same down here, continuing to the main hall.

//[Agent Monroe enters the main hall on the second floor. 12 doors can be seen, each with a light fixture next to it. Monroe opens the nearest door and enters.]//

**Monroe:** The GAD is reading a 10° drop in temperature in Room 13.

//[Monroe paces through the room, frequently checking his equipment. As Agent Monroe walks towards the window he lets out an exaggerated sigh.]//

**Monroe:** False positive on the temp drop, the damn window's open.

**Williams:** Copy that. Room one and two are clear down here.

//[Agent Monroe slams the window shut, as he turns around, he stumbles backward.]//

**Monroe:** Christ! 

//[Standing in front of Agent Monroe is a pale white spectral entity with the appearance of a middle-aged woman, in a flowing Victorian-era dress.]//

**Williams:** What's going on?

**Spectral Women:** Leave now! You're gonna ruin everything!

//[Agent Monroe removes his salted-iron baton, and swings it through the entity, to no effect.]//

**Spectral Women:** I'm a ghost– you can't hurt me! Leave now, leave now, leave now!

//[Agent Monroe runs through the entity and exits the room, slamming the door behind him.]//

**Monroe:** Iron had no effect, be advised.

**Williams:** I'm coming up.

**Monroe:** Not necessary-- finish your sweep.

//[Banging can be heard from the door behind Agent Monroe. He turns around to face the door; it does not move as the banging continues.]//

**Monroe:** Something's not right he–

//[The lights in the main hall beginning to flicker.]//
------
**__CAMERA TWO__**

**Williams:** Hey, uh, the lights doing that up there? 

**Monroe:** Yes. I don't understand why our equipment isn't picking up any activity.

**Williams:** I keep hearing this wei–

//[Williams is cut off by a loud croaking noise. He spins around to see a small black-eyed boy of Asian descent.]//

**Williams:** What the fu– it’s that kid! The one from the movie, why would–

**Child Entity:** Leave now, leave! Why won't you leave!

**Monroe:** What's going on, Williams?

**Williams:** It's right in front of me. I'm gonna back–

**Child Entity:** Leave, leave, leave! Or I'll, uh, kill you– and eat your brains!

//[The child begins to bleed from its eyes before letting out a shriek. William turns and runs down the hall; dozens spectral hands reach from the wall in an attempt to grasp the running Agent.]//

**Monroe:** Let's regroup.

**Williams:** Copy that.

//[Williams is crouched in the stairway trying to catch his breath as Monroe descends the stairs.]//

**Monroe:** Something's not right here. We've got ghosts, with no actual evidence of there being ghosts-- no ectoplasm, no EMF readings, nothing. Not to mention this hotel was built in the '70s, why are there Victorian-era ghosts here? It doesn't add up.

**Williams:** At least you got that, //I// had to run from grudge boy.

**Monroe:** Fair enough. 

//[Agent Monroe begins adjusting his equipment.]//

**Williams:** Are we gonna call this in? I mean, it's clearly haunted, right?

**Monroe:** I don't know. But, there we go, I think something else is going on. 

//[Agent Monroe is pointing the GAD'S screen in each direction.]//

**Williams:** What're you–

**Monroe:** Got it! Thermal imaging is picking up something in the basement.

**Williams:** A cold spot? It could be another window.

**Monroe:** No, a hotspot, something //alive// is down there. Let's go pay it a visit.

**Williams:** But you said–

**Monroe:** Listen, kid, your gonna have to trust me on this. I got a feeling.

**Williams:** Yeah, I got a feeling too, like I'm gonna shit myself if I have to run from any more ghosts.

//[The two Agents make their way to the basement door; a dim light can be seen in the crevice underneath.]//

**Monroe:** See. That was off when we first got here. Something //is// down there.

**Williams:** Don't doubt you there, boss. I just don't think I want to kn–

//[Several spectral entities appear between the door and the Agents. They begin to screech and yell in unison.]//

**Spectral Entities:** You can't go there, leave!

**Monroe:** Follow my lead, Williams.

//[The two Agents walk through the entities, the camera blurring as they pass through each one.]//

**Spectral Entities:** No, no, no! You're not– You're supposed to run away!

**Monroe:** We're getting to the bottom of this.

**Spectral Entities:** No! //[Indistinguishable]// it's not fair!

//[Agent Williams swings open the door and is met by a floating bulbous, semi-transparent entity.]//

**Bulbous Entity:** Oh boy, we should listen to these guys and scram. Come on!

//[The Agents walk through the floating entity.]//

**Williams:** I don't think so Casper. 

**Monroe:** Eye's sharp, kid.

//[The camera pans around the basement stopping on an illuminated blanket tent in the corner of the room. The women in white appears between the agents and the tent.]//

**Spectral Women:** No you can't! Leave or die! Leave now... please? //[The entities words echo from the tent.]// 
 
**Monroe:** Enough of this!

//[Monroe quickly walks through the women in white and rips the blanket upwards, revealing Mike Stevens. Agent Monroe grabs the boy by the back of the shirt, lifting him off the ground as a glowing glass sphere drops from his grip. Monroe holds him towards Agent Williams, who's mouth is ajar.]// 

**Monroe:** Here's our freakin' ghost!

//[Mike squirms in Agent Monroe's grip, to no avail.]//

**Mike:** Let go of me, you bully! I'll tell my mom the–

**Monroe:** That's an excellent idea– let's go talk to your mother.

//[Agent Monroe throws the boy over his should and gestures towards the crystal ball.]//

**Monroe:** Williams, bag that ball and call in for a Containment Unit. I'll handle the civilians.

**Williams:** Oh, yeah– you got it, boss.

**[END LOG]**

Following the investigation, a cache of items belonging to the previous owner was recovered, along with a glowing glass sphere theorized to be the cause of the SCP-5570 phenomena. When questioned Mike Stevens admitted to using the anomaly in an attempt to garner attention from his parents. In response to their sons behavior, the Stevens family arranged for their son to work part time as a greeter in their hotel. Mike Stevens was administered Class-D Amnestics to remove knowledge of the anomaly, and cover story "Ghosts-Busted" was enacted to explain the discontinuation of SCP-5570.
