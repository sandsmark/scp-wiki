**Item #:** SCP-914 

**Object Class:** Safe  

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-914 is to be kept at a rating at +40 or higher. Should SCP-914 drop below the top rated article on the site, it will explode with the force of a hojillion hand grenades.

**Description:** SCP-914 is an SCP article written by Doctor Gears, an otherwise non-noteworthy item which, for some reason, has been upvoted ten trillion times and become the top article on the site. We're not sure how the hell this happened either, and its success mystifies Gears to this day. Seriously, guys, it's a machine that makes things different and refines them, how did that become the top rated article on the site, higher even than SCP-173, the original? Jeezus.
