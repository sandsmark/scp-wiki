Hi, I'm Monkeysky (AKA Schuyler, Sky or September). I'm a neurobiologist. 

As of now, I've only written three SCPs and two other articles (both for the 2018 Doomsday Contest), and haven't added much information since I first realized I should make an author page. Feel free to leave a comment if there's something you'd like explained or talked about.

Fun Facts:

* I once found a forum posts stating that someone had been roleplaying as [[[SCP-1163]]] on a Gary's Mod server. I have never been able to find more information about this.
