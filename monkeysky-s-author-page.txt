Hi, I'm Monkeysky (AKA Schuyler, Sky or September). I'm a student of biology and neuroscience. 

As of now, I've only written three articles (no tales yet), and only just now realized that I'm supposed to have an author page, so there isn't going to be much information here for a while. Feel free to leave a comment if there's something you'd like explained or talked about.

Fun Facts:

* I once found a forum posts stating that someone had been roleplaying as [[[SCP-1163]]] on a Gary's Mod server. I have never been able to find more information about this.
