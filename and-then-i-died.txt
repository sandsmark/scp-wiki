title:And Then I Died...
Welcome to //And Then I Died...//, an SCP collective writing game!  Useful information is held behind a collapsible tab right here: [[collapsible show="Click Here to Learn The Rules of the Game" hide="Click Here to Make This Go Away"]]

This is pretty simple.  The idea of this game is to compose an encounter with an SCP without overtly revealing what SCP it actually is.  The rules are basic, and as follows:

1. Whoever guessed the last one correctly (information about guessing at the bottom) has to write the next one. If you don't want to write, then don't guess.  Feel free to sit back and relax.

2. If you're writing the new one, try to keep it under 500 words. This is a game, not a novel.  Also, try to get it written within a week at the longest, so the game can keep moving forward.

3. While not required, a few red herrings are definitely encouraged, so long as the final solution is the most likely/most obvious answer.  Having someone die from exposure to  [[[SCP-008]]] while [[[SCP-682]]] eats their torso and they're fired from the Sun Launcher... Not gonna work.

4. The character "speaking" (and this is the most important rule) //must// die at the end.  It might not be from the SCP in question, so long as their exposure caused it somehow.  

5. If no one guesses your SCP, then congrats!  After a week or so, let everyone know how clever you were, and write another one.

6. If you're the author, make sure you send a message to both TroyL and Ragazzo (either through Wikidot or the **#site19** chat) to let them know the answer.  This will make it possible for people to guess even when you're not around.  Troy and Ragz will be recusing themselves from making any further guesses to function in this capacity.  If someone guess your SCP correctly, please let them know //that// as well, so they don't keep fielding answers.  Winners will be posted in the discussion thread for this page, for the sake of helpful redundancy. 

If there are any questions, or a need for clarification, please notify the game judging people things, TroyL, Ragazzo or Dexanote, in the chat.  Thanks, and have a good time reading and guessing!

**Part 1: TroyL**

I never really cared much for my brother.

We had at best a strained relationship.  Our parents just muttered “boys” and went about their business, but it was different.  It wasn’t sibling rivalry.  It wasn’t even rivalry.  We just… didn’t want to be around each other.  Ever.  We were like the same end of a magnet, always pushing away from each other, always bowing to the invisible force that kept us surely separated.  And, in a way, we were happy like that.

I went into the military; he went to college.  I got out and started working with computers; he finished his degree and started designing them.  I eventually managed a private companies IT department; he worked at development in a rival company.  From my graduation on, I never saw him for more than an hour at most.  Since our mother’s funeral—the official cessation of all family gatherings—I hadn’t seen him at all.

It made his sudden appearance, haggard, carrying a briefcase and a shotgun, that so surprised me.  It was early in the morning, and when I opened the door, the light was carrying blinded me.  He talked for a few moments at the door, still holding the light aloft, before he turned it off, apologizing.  He came in, apologizing for the late hour, and asked for a cup of coffee.  I agreed, sitting with him at the table silently.  He didn’t speak.  I didn’t ask.

As he was about to leave, he looked at me, tilting his head sideways for a moment.  “Do you have any shells for a 20 gauge?”

I nodded somewhat, fetching them from my study at the end of the hall and handing them to him.  He thanked me and left the building.  I should have wondered what he’d gotten himself into, what sort of espionage he’d managed, but I didn’t.  I just didn’t care.

The next morning, I found myself unable to think.  Everything looked like a gray haze, and even when I tried to concentrate, I couldn’t.  I remember turning the knob, and the bullet hitting my chest, but after that, everything starting shifting—going from gray to black.

And then I died.

**Part 2: Dexanote**

I’ve always had a pretty decent life. I was an only child, growing up in upstate New York with my mother and father. Mom was a real estate agent, Dad was an engineer. They both had emigrated from England before I was born, and we still had family back there. We visited sometimes, in the summers. I never liked English Summers. It would always rain.

I always got good grades in school, played sports, did my chores, and so on. Never caused any trouble, but never really looked for any. I was a model, if fairly average, teenager.

When I was 24 I decided to go travel abroad in Europe. Mom and Dad had retired together the year before, and didn’t seem to mind. I wish they had stopped me.

I went to Italy first, then Austria, Germany, Switzerland, France… It was wonderful. I slept in hostels and under the stars, I loved this freedom. It was… beautiful. The countries, the places, the cities, the people, the art. It was all breathtaking.

One day, a few months into my travels, I called home to see how everyone was doing. I found that my widowed Aunt Helen back in England had passed, and left everything to me, her only nephew. I was told to make my way to Britain and find her lawyers, who would sort everything out in the mean time.

When I arrived, the lawyers had already sorted out the transfer of ownership and related documentation. I now owned my Aunt’s entire estate. 

I went “home” to my new domain. 

It was June, and the sky was grey. The estate was a large house in the countryside, with a greenhouse and a large garden out back. The entire building was covered in a purplish ivy, and an entire wing of the place contained a collection of strange, curious gadgets - a chessboard, an ugly green statue, a bunch of freakish  dolls, a fortune-teller machine, records, phonographs, a wardrobe, a dartboard… Nothing in the rooms seemed to have any coherent theme. I just shrugged; I’d sort through all the bullshit when I had time. 

I had decided to sleep on a sofa in the living room until I was more comfortable with the house. The huge conservatory window behind me let in a bit of light, the rain //plit plit plitting// off the panes. It hadn’t stopped raining since I arrived. 

I left one of the lower windows open to let in a nice breeze. At least I wasn’t sweating, I thought. If I was back in New York I’d be quite uncomfortable.

It wasn’t so bad here. The rain was relaxing, the ivy shivered quietly in the breeze. I guess I could get used to this…

I felt something brush against my arm. I became very still. 

Something burned. I screamed.

And then I died.

**Part 3: Ragazzo**

In a Miami apartment's bathroom.

//Ahhhhhh...damn...this...this is a really shitty hangover...fuck, man, what did I have last night...I'm here in my god damn apartment throwing up in my fucking apartment while that bastard Jode must be waking up next to some hot piece of a-ah f-fuck...// The sounds of vomiting echo off the bile, and blood splattered linoleum of the bathroom floor, interspersed with the odd dry heave here and there. "Wait...fuckin' hang on...I partied with Jode last week, the fuck...is that my fuckin' hair?! The hell am I sitting in? Shit, fuck, my hands...what happened to my fuckin' hands?!" And then I passed out. 

**Several hours later...**

"F-fuck...oh...g-god...I feel like...fuckin' shit...what'd I...drink last night...fuck, it must have been that old ass boo-" A heave, a retching sound. A thin stream of bile dribbles out of my mouth, around the sickly pale orb of flesh that has swollen up from the roof of my mouth. I fall forward, my face splashes into the toilet bowl, breaking through the thin crust shell of bodily fluids into the rancid slop below.

And then I died.

**Part 4: RhettSarlin**

Almost ready. We've been waiting for this excursion for a while now. Just us and the desert, looking up at the stars, snuggled close. Sophie smiles at me as she finishes packing food into the cooler. I smile back and take our sleeping bags out to the truck. I love her more than she knows. We've been going on random playful excursions for nearly 2 years now, and ever since that day at the camel farm where she came out soaked but laughing I've known she was the one for me. 

I may propose to her soon. 

But not this trip. Watching the Perseids and looking at cacti are the order of the weekend this time. We've got everything packed up now. House is locked up, dogs have food and water, alarm's on. We already made sure things were good with her apartment, so she gives me a quick peck on the cheek and we're on our way. 

Country music blaring from the radio as we head down I-8. I shake my head internally at her for that one, but hey, nobody's perfect. Exit coming up. Heading south now. She's chattering about her plans for a painting of the meteor shower. I love her art. I tend to appreciate the realistic more than the abstract, and her stuff from a distance looks almost like a photograph...at first glance anyway.

Quick stop in Why for gas and a restroom break, then head down to the campgrounds. Or near enough. Sun's going down and we want to get set up out in the desert rather than the official spots. We go offroad a ways, drive past a hill and park where the truck won't be seen. Hiking time. We grab our packs, bags, and the cooler and head out. A mile or so we deem sufficient. We find a nice clear flat area that's to our liking and set up camp.

Night now. Smores and hotdogs are sufficient for us. Playful makeouts, with an eye toward the sky. There it is! First meteor of the night. A kiss for every one we see. Soon there's too many for us to keep up, so we just lay in each other's arms and enjoy the show.

Starting to feel a bit sleepy. Wouldn't be my first time sleeping in the open, and Sophie doesn't seem to mind. My body tingles a bit, then starts to go numb. I drift away and darkness takes me.

And then I died.

**Part 5: TroyL**

He’s standing there.  He’s standing there, rooted to the spot, looking at me.  He’s going to kill me.  He didn’t realize it when he walked in the room—and he doesn’t even realize it now—but it’s going to happen.  They’re going to make him.

“Richard,” I whisper, putting my hand on the glass  separating the two of us. “Richard, please don’t do this.”

His eyes look almost pained as he takes a step back, his face contorting as his teeth clench abnormally hard.  I can feel it as they grind, enamel on enamel, the sound practically boring a hole into my head.

“Please,” I beg, my voice a pained whisper. “Please don’t do this. I… I’ll do anything. I’ll do whatever you want.  Just…don’t do what they say. Don’t kill me, Richard.”

He looks at me, gagging suddenly, as the intercom clicks: “Follow your orders, 18765. Proceed with the experiment.”

I pound my fists on the glass, screaming, “They don’t even know your name! Please! I know you! I’m your friend, Richard! Please. //Please//. Don’t let them kill me.”

I’m sobbing, and so is he.  The intercom sounds again, and he closes his eyes.  I watch as he backs away from me, his face streaming with sweat and tears.  I pound on the glass again, and again, and again, to no avail. “RICHARD!”

And then I died.

**Part 6: Redswift**

"August 14, 1981

I'm so sorry. It's all my fault. I was weak and this will be my very last entry. Even now i can hear him, pounding and screaming. His pain is real and actions justified but I could fight back if not for the screaming. Damn his screaming!  It's his pain reverberating through my ears and my eyes and my bones and lending him my strength. There is no doubt I would already be dead if not for the heavy dresser which is slowing him down but will not stop him. He will never stop kill he kills the one responsible for taking her from him. I never had a ''her''. All I have is my farm and this journal. My last hope is that someone else will find use for them so at least some small good will have come of my existence. I can see the field right now from out my bedroom window.

The corn has seen better days but the sight of it is calming. 

Well nevermind about that first part. I don't know what came over me. I'm sure I'll be just fine. I don't know why I'm still writing. It seems kind of  silly and so does this barricade...I'll go say hello."

And then I died.

**Part 7: Redswift**

Finally I spot him walking toward the house. He is late for the first time today. Why does he look so shaken? I hope he is ok. The young man who brings me the mail is my only neighbor for miles. My driveway is too long and I am too weak to get it myself.  His smiling face is the only reason for these old bones to get out of bed anymore.  Yesterday's paper said there has been a series of strange break-ins but hell if I can remember any details. 

I turn to walk toward the door so I can greet him when suddenly there it is. Soundless, still and black as the devil's heart, its featureless face just inches from mine. The strain is too much and I drop to my knees from the pain. My eyes remain locked on the intruder. The pills on my dresser are far out of reach but all I can hope for is one last smile, even from this fiend. The young man knocks as he finally reaches my door. Thankfully it doesn't react. I clutch my chest as the world fades. In a blink it's gone.

And then I died.

**Part 8: CondorTalon**

I've been sick just about my whole life. Chicken pox, mumps, the flu, mono, E. coli; you name it, I've had it. At first, it was really frightening, not knowing when the next strike was, but now, it's just annoying. I think I've been held back a grade about 3 times when I was younger. Thankfully, my wife has the patience of a saint, and she sticks by me without fail. Unlike me, she's almost never sick. I don't know what I'd do without her.

It's happened again. I'm stuck in this bed, staring at the ceiling as the symptoms overtake me. My head feels like it's burning up, and my entire body is itchy. I even had to close the curtains because the lights were too bright for me. I'm worried that I'm getting attacked en masse.

Well, somehow I made it through without too many problems. I'm quite tired now. I think I'll turn in. Let me just grab my pills...

And then I died.

**Part 9: Redswift**

The first warm day of the new year just happens to be my first day off in months. It's actually a little warmer than I would prefer but it seems like no matter where I walk the cloud position is perfect. Lady luck smiles on me today. Eating my favorite food at a picnic table in the local park I can hear the laughter of children on a nearby playground. 

I lay down on the grass to let my fully belly rest under the beautiful blue sky. It is much softer than what I have in my yard. Hell this grass is almost better than my bed. I don't want to ever leave. That cloud looks like a bunny... I don't have a care in the world...That one looks like a heart...I haven't done this since I was a kid...That one looks like a...

And then I died.
