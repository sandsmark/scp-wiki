**Item #:** SCP-4907

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-4907 are to be stored within standard containment lockers. Any and all Foundation personnel may request to be exposed to an instance of SCP-4907 for personal reasons or otherwise.

**Description:** SCP-4907 is the collective designation for three identical lawn gnomes. Physically, all instances of SCP-4907 are identical to non-anomalous lawn gnomes.

SCP-4907's anomalous effects occur after a sapient subject has been within five meters of at least one SCP-4907 instance for at least ten minutes. After the subject leaves the proximity of the SCP-4907 instance, a single folded piece of paper will appear in a location related to the subject, typically their pocket, desk, or some other location the subject checks frequently. Written on the paper will be a single Shakespearean-style sonnet about the subject, describing them in a matter that the subject would find flattering. 

SCP-4907 instances show a certain level of omnipotence in regards to exposed subjects, and often incorporate certain specific details about subjects' lives in each poem. Each poem to date is unique, and there is currently no known limit to the amount of poems a single subject may receive if exposed to an SCP-4907 instance repeatedly.

Subjects who read poems created by an SCP-4907 instance will typically report feeling happier, more confident, and less stressed about personal problems. Whether this effect is anomalous or otherwise is inconclusive.

Below is a list of example poems gathered from experiments with SCP-4907 instances.

> **Recipient:** Researcher Harold Barnaby

> 
> So brilliant, majestic, Barnaby
> His intellect can never quite be matched
> So many men wish that they could be he
> Adoring fans they cling, they are attached.

> Quite humble 'bout it all, he's quite the man
> His only care is goodness, he adores
> The idea of doing what he can.

> Oh Doctor Harold Barnaby, it's true
> There is no man with brain or heart your size
> Not one person on Earth as great as you.

> **Recipient:** Francis Paloma, Site-22 Janitor
> ------
> 
> When poppa comes on home, everyone
> Will squeal with glee their daddy's finally here
> Three growing girls, one tiny baby son
> And certainly his loving wife will cheer.
>

> With dolls and cars and other fancy toys
> He always makes good time for every day
> If forced to choose, family is his choice.

> **Recipient:** D-39985

> Her blood boils over, anxious to be free!
> Her kicks are strong, and she will kick your ass!
> The time will come when she'll rule SCP!

> To challenge her would be the plight of fools.
> Ain't no one better than this coolest cat!
> Patricia reigns! Patricia Walters rules!
> 
> Don't give up hope, just keep your fight alive
> Cooperate for now and you'll survive.
> 
> //Note: Despite the message endorsing D-39985 to forcefully break free of her confinement, she has since been significantly more cooperative and docile compared to before exposure to the SCP-4907 instance.//

**Addendum:** During an experiment regarding repeated exposure to SCP-4907 instances, the following note manifested in place of the standard Shakespearean sonnet.

> **Recipient:** Researcher Leo Holt
> ------
> 
> Please don't die tonight.
> We know that this is breaking character, but we couldn't just hold this in.
> You've been looking for a sign for what to do.
> Consider this your sign.

After reading the note, Researcher Holt immediately left the Site-22 premises and did not return for the day. He returned the day after.
