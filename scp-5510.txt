**Item #:** SCP-5510

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** All SCP-5510 units and associated documentation are to be contained within Suite 908A of Site-01 and managed through Project AURUM SILKWORM.

SCP-5510 test subjects shall be chosen from within MTF Alpha-1 ("Red Right Hand") through a standardized process that selects for depth of project-relevant experiences, particularly personnel management and information extraction. Participation in AURUM SILKWORM is to be maintained as a key component of MTF Alpha-1 membership.

Members of MTF Alpha-1 who have been exposed to experience strands with intensity quotients over 20,000 may not be assigned Overseer Council security details. Such individuals are not to be permitted transfer to other positions within the Foundation or voluntary retirement from their posts.

**Description:** SCP-5510 is a combination of technologies that enable the identification, biochemical extraction, and duplication of an individual's first-hand experiences. SCP-5510 further allows for the conversion of extracted strands into audiovisual media. Although replicable within the Foundation, progenitor paratech guarantees anomalous classification until parallel advancements are publicly made.

Standard SCP-5510 units consist of three individual components. A central terminal controls the overall process and stores extracted strands for future processing. An EEG headset collects general activity data and provides a host platform for micro-needle insertion through thinner skull sections. A chair equipped with full-body restraints ensures subject stability and safety during high-intensity strand exposure. Facilities for large-scale biological matter disposal are frequently used //post hoc//, but are not considered central to device functionality.

Serial use of SCP-5510 amplifies the qualities of extracted experiences via filtration through subconscious ego constructs. As a result, individuals' experiences, preferences, and psychological outlooks have significant influence over the qualities of produced strands, which vary significantly in duration, emotional slant, and experiential intensity. Consuming the audiovisual output of high-concentration strands induces a variety of effects within the human body, which pose possible health risks and benefits.

The following table contextualizes these effects:

||~ **Intensity Quotient Range** ||~ **Health Risks** ||
|| 0 - 300 || None observed. Subjects typically report personally calming experiences. ||
|| 300 - 4,000 || Fluctuations in heart rate, blood pressure, and brain activity depending on each strand's emotional slant. ||
|| 4,000 - 20,000 || Significant fluctuations in heart rate, blood pressure, and brain activity depending on strand slant. Elevated risk of cardiac arrest, internal hemorrhaging, and general organ failure. ||
|| 20,000 - 50,000 || All test subjects not previously exposed to moderate-intensity strands have immediately expired due to experiential overload. Previously-exposed subjects tend to suffer a variety of incapacitating conditions, most of which have ultimately proven lethal. ||

**Addendum 5510-A (Original Test Log Samples):**

[[collapsible hide="[CLOSE TEST LOG]" show="[OPEN TEST LOG]"]]
**Test Number:** 14
**Strand Donor:** Janet York
**Test Subject:** D-71354

**Psychological Evaluation Summary:** D-71354 is a relatively well-adjusted individual with few concerning proclivities. Despite spending several years in Foundation custody, she maintains a generally positive attitude, speaks frequently about hopes for the future, and is spoken of highly by her peers.

**Experiential Report:**
> "A damn fine sight. Waves, sand, sun, everything you need. Hot sand between my toes. Sand falling through my fingers. There's sand in my swimsuit too. That's a small price to pay if there ever was one. 
> 
> Now I'm laughing. That's not my voice, but I'm laughing anyway. Not my lips, but I'm smiling. It feels nice. The sun's as warm as I remember. Maybe even warmer. I'm drinking too. The doctor said I shouldn't anymore, but one won't hurt. The girls say it'll do me good.
> 
> There's water between my toes. My feet are wet, and my legs, and I'm diving under. There's water everywhere. Not sure if I know how to swim, but I'm managing fine. Reefs below, fish out front, and my friends all around. Everything's going to be fine."

**Estimated Intensity Quotient (Retroactive):** 25

**Test Number:** 15
**Strand Donor:** D-71354
**Test Subject:** D-89522

**Psychological Evaluation Summary:** D-89522 expresses the typical pessimistic outlook of D-Class personnel, but otherwise exhibits no concerning tendencies beyond persistent aquaphobia.

**Experiential Report:**
> "No, wait, yeah, I know them. My friends. My friends are playing in the surf while I sit on a towel and drink. There’s nothing wrong with that. But, like, well, maybe there is something wrong. My breath catches when one of them slips in the water. It’s only ankle deep, but they might fall beneath anyway. They’re going to fall, and sink, and never come up again. I don’t want to be a wet blanket though. I don’t want to let them know.
> 
> One of them runs back out to talk to me. She’s dripping everywhere, but not on me. Thank god, not on me. She’s so happy though. She’s practically bubbling herself. We’re talking, and talking, and then she grabs my hand. It’s wet, but I can handle that. Wet and warm, at least. Warm and alive, for now.
> 
> She tugs me back toward the water. My heart’s racing, but I step in anyway. I try my hardest to laugh with them, even if it feels like I’m going to drown standing. That’s what it takes."

**Estimated Intensity Quotient (Retroactive):** 44

-----

**Test Number:** 16
**Strand Donor:** D-89522
**Test Subject:** D-92001

**Psychological Evaluation Summary:** D-92001 exhibits classic antisocial behaviors and was previously convicted for a series of violent offenses. Historical summaries indicate a pattern of abusive behaviors by caretakers during their early childhood.

**Experiential Report:**
> "We’re all playing in the water. It’s a city pool, right? One of those big ones. There’re hundreds of us crammed in there. Nah, more like thousands. Heh. We’re ass to elbows, knees to faces. Just one big screaming mess of kids. I don’t even want to think of what’s in the water. Snot, and piss, and worse. Heh. Yeah, lots worse.
> 
> It’s a gross strew, and I keep dunking this one kid in. Again, and again, and again. We’re all the pot together, so it doesn’t matter much if one goes under for a bit. He’s struggling, but not enough. He’s whining, but it’s just wasting air. He’s blue when he comes up, but I push him down again. Heh. Someone’s screaming at me, but he’ll be fine. We've all survived worse. I tell him that, but he just keeps screaming. He won't listen. He just won't fucking listen, so I keep pushing him under. He probably deserves it. Yeah. Definitely."

**Estimated Intensity Quotient (Retroactive):** 68

**Archived document:**
> To affected personnel,
> 
> Under the authority of O5-3, Project AURUM SILKWORM is hereby established to examine specific applications of SCP-5510. Based on current analysis and long-term projections, refined experience strands pose significant advantages as therapeutic aids and memetic agents. Other possible uses are expected to become apparent in the course of research.
> 
> Although D-Class personnel were initially used to test the safety and stability of involved procedures, MTF Alpha-1 personnel are henceforth to be employed as test subjects due to an abundance of strand-enhancing experiences, extant clearances, and relevance to long-term project goals. These are expected to include:
> 
> • Creating new media-based security mechanisms to replace aging memetic agents.
> • Creating low-cost treatments to raise Foundation personnel's morale, efficiency, and loyalty.
> • Improving the operational capacity of mobile task forces within cognitohazardous environments.
> 
> Additional details will be provided to all requisitioned personnel.
> 
> Sincerely,
> Adrianne Berryman, Project Lead

**Output Subject Vocalizations:**
> "No, I don't feel anything.

> Yeah, Langford, I see it. That doesn't mean I feel anything. There's a lot, alright? Maybe people I haven't hurt yet? Or, people I'm going to hurt. They're screaming, and dying, and dead. All three at once, yeah. I've got my knife, and my pistol, and a hundred dripping hearts. My fingers are sticking through their eyes. My teeth are around their necks. The blood tastes like bleach, and I'm breathing it deep.
> 
> They hate me. Their children died in airstrikes, and their siblings sank into the sea. I'm on trial. I'm in prison. I'm buried. Someone drags me out of the ground, but they never let go. Their hands are on my wrists. On my ankles. There's a hotel room. I'm hanging upside down in the bathroom, bruised all over. Sewage drips from the shower. Something's leaking under the door. It's thick, and black, and mewling. The bed is full of bodies. No, wait, there's only two, but I don't know which is mine. A dog started gnawing on my leg. Another's deep in my guts. It's got dad's face and mom's voice. A drill presses right against my forehead. It's spinning up, hot and loud. Breaking the skin. Pushing in. All I can hear are my breaths through her mouth.
> 
> No, nothing hurts. Don't you have biometrics? Nothing's wrong.
> 
> No, it's just like one of those magic eye things.
> 
> No, I feel fine."
