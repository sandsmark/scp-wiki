If the words "esoteric containment" mean nothing to you, stop this recording.

//Time passes, approximately ten seconds.//

My name is Doctor Lowell Henry Piedmont. I am a research scientist for the Foundation, specialty in esoteric containment of anomalous objects, events and locations. I have gone missing. There are three others with me. Alicia Connors is an archivist assistant currently assigned to SCP-914. Jerald Hanndock is a research assistant, also assigned to SCP-914. Matthew Terger is a security agent with whom I have worked with to a considerable degree of satisfaction. 

The D-class subject to be testing the results of the SCP-316 replica caused us to be exposed to the light of 914's output. We are now someplace I suspect to be the United Kingdom, though we haven't been able to confirm this. We have taken shelter in a greenhouse on Terger's suggestion- it is elevated and will give us a good view of any more incoming hostiles. We have already been attacked.

We attempted to make camp in the great room of the adjacent, abandoned manor house, but gunfire awoke us during the second watch. Terger saw something with a rather disturbing resemblance to SCP-749 attempt to reach Connors while she slept. He shot it, clipped the anterior of its body length and sent it running back through a warped hole in the window. We relocated immediately.

I don't know how we got here but this is the first of my records. I will be documenting our attempts to return.

Doctor Piedmont, signing off.
