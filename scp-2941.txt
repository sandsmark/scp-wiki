**Item #:** SCP-2941

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**  All known instances of SCP-2941 are to be kept within separate and fully-isolated bio-containment chambers within Site-103. Instances should be provided with four to six hours of direct light from an overhead fluorescent. Each instance of SCP-2941 must be checked at least four times a day to confirm that specimen morale levels fall within mandated guidelines (for more information see Document 2941-M-5). Any measurements of specimen morale levels falling above standard containment parameters should be reported immediately to the current project head. Should standard demoralization acts prove insufficient, please consult Document 2941-DM-1 for Stage B countermeasures.

Since Incident 2941-3-2, interaction with SCP-2941 is limited to researchers with Level 3 clearance. Additionally, transport of SCP-2941 instances to and from other Site-103 research wings must be carried out in pre-approved routes free of Foundation personnel traffic.

**Description:** SCP-2941 is the collective designation for an anomalous population of fruits and vegetables. Instances of SCP-2941 superficially resemble their non-anomalous counterparts in appearance only, as their behavior and growth patterns do not correlate with any other known specimens of similar species. Each instance of SCP-2941 appears to be aware of its surroundings, capable of independent movement, and furthermore, some have shown the ability to speak, though how SCP-2941 instances manage to vocalize is currently unknown.

Under optimal containment conditions, the physical size of each instance of SCP-2941 conforms to the general size of comparable specimens in its particular species. However, rapid growth will occur without fail when any instance of SCP-2941 is presented with verbal and/or physical affection as well as any other kind of positive reinforcement. Letting individual instances perform activities that they individually seem to derive pleasure from will also initiate accelerated growth. No upper bound of SCP-2941's enlargement has been shown through on-site testing and through Foundation computer modeling. Proper negative morale inducement must be maintained on a regular basis as any instance left alone for a period of between three to five hours will begin growing at a noticeably rapid rate. Foundation researchers have hypothesized that each instance of SCP-2941 has an innate highly positive self-image that must be countered at all times.

**Addendum A:** List of currently-contained SCP-2941 instances
||~ Instance Designations ||~ Instance Specifics ||~ Special Notes ||
|| SCP-2941-1 || Red Delicious apple _
[[size 80%]](//Malus domestica//)[[/size]] || Primary pleasure vector involved rolling around in a circular path within its containment cell until researchers were able to convince SCP-2941-1 that any movement at all will waken a massive parasitic worm living inside it. It should continue to be made clear that removing the worm from -1 is simply beyond the Foundation's capabilities. ||
|| SCP-2941-2 || Fennel _
[[size 80%]](//Foeniculum vulgare//)[[/size]] || Main morale boost comes from engaging in the popular children's game "Peek-a-boo" by being placed underneath a piece of fabric large enough to completely cover it, and then having the fabric quickly pulled away. Tests have shown that SCP-2941-2's greatest demoralization occurs when the fabric is simply left covering -2 and no attempt is made to assist while it tries to roll free. The longest time to date that -2 has been trapped beneath the fabric is sixteen days, which as test models predicted, coincided with record low morale. || 
|| SCP-2941-3 || Honeydew Melon _
[[size 80%]](//Cucumis melo//)[[/size]] || Is very quick to notice nearby individuals, and will repeatedly vocalize questions regarding the quality of its roundness. To minimize misunderstanding on SCP-2941-3's part, researchers must be sure to always respond to each query with the statement "You are a hideous cube." || 
|| SCP-2941-4 || Cavendish banana _
[[size 80%]](//Musa acuminata//)[[/size]] || Compulsively attempts to show off its ability to balance vertically on its stem. SCP-2941-4 should always be contained within a bio-chamber specifically modified with a floor that constantly pivots up and down at random angles and direction, prohibiting -4 from ever accomplishing this goal. || 
|| SCP-2941-5 || Green pepper _
[[size 80%]](//Capsicum annuum//)[[/size]] || Regularly vocalizes concerns about the well-being of the rest of the SCP-2941 instances. SCP-2941-5 is to always be told that all the other specimens have made it clear to Foundation personnel that they wish -5 would mind its own business and that its consideration is unwanted.||
|| SCP-2941-6 || Persian Lime _
[[size 80%]](//Citrus × latifolia//)[[/size]] || SCP-2941-6's morale has been shown to markedly increase when placed in a silent containment cell. Researchers are to do hourly checks to confirm that the speaker placed within -6's current bio-chamber is functioning correctly and that the audio file chosen by the current head researcher is playing on an uninterrupted loop at a minimum of 90db. At the time of writing, the sound of a knife scraping a glass bottle has been playing for eighty-four days. ||
|| SCP-2941-7 || Turnip _
[[size 80%]](//Brassica rapa//)[[/size]] || Has expressed repeated desire to only be referred to as "Terry". Foundation personnel are expressly forbidden from doing so, but if absolutely necessary, they should refer to SCP-2941-7 directly, condescendingly, and repeatedly as any other name besides Terry. Names producing the most severe demoralization vectors so far include "Ferguson", "Wingding" and "Budz".||
|| SCP-2941-8 || Button mushrooms (2) _
[[size 80%]](//Agaricus bisporus//)[[/size]] || As this pair has shown to prefer close visual contact, each separate SCP-2941-8 instance should be kept in detached, opaque chambers a minimum of 4m apart. If the situation requires, researchers are allowed to converse with the -8 instances separately, with a sole focus on pointing out how the other member of the pair had been given the opportunity to be placed back together but voluntarily and happily turned it down.||
|| SCP-2941-9 || Peach _
[[size 80%]](//Prunus persica//)[[/size]] || Has often expressed displeasure with all forms of physical contact by Foundation researchers. Any researcher involved with the study of SCP-2941-9 should mark on Form 9C how many times they were able to flick -9 with their finger throughout their work shift.||
|| SCP-2941-10 || Cantaloupe _
[[size 80%]](//Cucumis melo//)[[/size]] || Has a predilection for wanting to tell jokes to Foundation staff. Morale reduction has been maximized by initiating Procedure 2941-10-α, which dictates that SCP-2941-10 be allowed to tell any joke it wishes, but should be addressed immediately afterwards with angrily-delivered comments regarding how poorly the joke was constructed and/or how -10 has profoundly hurt the joke recipient's feelings.   ||
|| SCP-2941-11 || Eggplant _
[[size 80%]](//Solanum melongena//)[[/size]] || As long as SCP-2941-11 has been under the Foundation's care, it has repeatedly vocalized only one sentence, without variation: "Hoo boo, I love you." -11's morale has, through much experimentation, shown to decrease the most when addressed with the carefully enunciated response: "You should be hurled into the trash." ||

**Incident 2941-3-2**: Due to a sudden and substantial water leak from Site-103's Antarctic Gardens, one floor directly above SCP-2941-3's containment cell, a decision was made by Junior Researcher Metcalf to temporarily move SCP-2941-3 to an empty research room down the hall. At the same time, testing had just finished for the day with SCP-████ and ten Class D personnel. As the remaining seven were being led back to the on-site Class D barracks, they passed Metcalf transporting SCP-2941-3 the opposite way down the same corridor. Ignoring established Transport Silence Protocols, D-34987 was later heard from recovered surveillance camera system data to call out loudly, "Hey baby, those're some nice round melons you got there!"

Junior Researcher Metcalf, the seven D-Class personnel, the two Security Officers leading them, and thirteen other nearby Foundation site staff were instantly crushed when SCP-2941-3 underwent the most rapid growth ever recorded by an SCP-2941 instance. Establishing morale levels low enough to re-contain SCP-2941-3 took eight hours and updated containment procedures were immediately put into effect.
