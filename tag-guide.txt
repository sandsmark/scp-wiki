[[tab Intro to Tags]]
++ Intro to Tags
+++ What is a tag, and what are they used for?
To quote Wikipedia,
> A tag is a non-hierarchical keyword or term assigned to a piece of information (such as an Internet bookmark, digital image, or computer file). This kind of metadata helps describe an item and allows it to be found again by browsing or searching.
So, if you want to get a list of all of our memetic SCPs, just look at [/system:page-tags/tag/memetic this list] of every page that's been tagged with "memetic". Or look [/system:page-tags/tag/are-we-cool-yet here] for a list of everything related to Are We Cool Yet?.

+++ Where are these tags?
Go to the bottom of any page on the wiki. To the right of the sidebar and to the left of the options in the lower right, you'll see "Page Tags:" and then a couple of words. Those are tags. You can click on them to get to a list of things tagged with that tag.

+++ How do I tag a page?
# Click "Tags" at the bottom of the page.
# Type all of the tags that apply to the page into the box that comes up.
# Click "Save Tags"

+++ Do I have to tag the pages I make?
Yes! If you don't have confidence in your ability to tag the page properly (or if someone tells you you've done it wrong), get someone who's experienced to do it for you. Check with [[user Crayne]], any other member of the [http://05command.wikidot.com/technical-staff-main Technical Staff], which is directly in charge of tagging, or any active member of staff. If none are around, **leave your page untagged**. Adding any tag to your page without adding all appropriate tags prevents staff from using Wikidot magic to find incorrectly tagged articles. If you aren't going to tag a page completely, **don't tag it at all.**

+++ What about someone else's page?
Please only tag others' pages if you know what you're doing. Preferably, ask the people listed above or an active member of staff first. If you're asked to stop, then please do stop.

+++ How do I know what tags to add to my page?
Look through this guide. If any of the tags apply to the page you're tagging, add them in. Don't make up new tags.

[[tab Major Page Tags]]
++ Major Page Tags
This is a comprehensive list of "major" page tags, and how they should be used. All pages on the SCP Wiki should have one or more major tags, and describe the "type" of page it is. These generally don't refer to information on the //content// of the pages; rather, they refer to out-of-character characteristics of the pages.

* [/system:page-tags/tag/scp scp] - All SCP articles from the main blocks, [[[scp-001|001 proposals]]], [[[joke-scps|jokes]]] (-J), [[[archived-scps|archives]]] (-ARC), [[[decommissioned-scps|decommissions]]] (-D), and [[[scp-ex|explained]]] (-EX) articles should be tagged with //scp//.

* [/system:page-tags/tag/safe safe] / [/system:page-tags/tag/euclid euclid] / [/system:page-tags/tag/keter keter] / [/system:page-tags/tag/thaumiel thaumiel] / [/system:page-tags/tag/unclassed unclassed] - All SCP articles tagged as //scp// should also be tagged with the appropriate tag for their object class. Legacy articles that are dual-classed (such as safe/euclid) are tagged with both of their constituent classes; however, as this is no longer allowed, it is only for posterity until all such articles are updated or deleted.

* [/system:page-tags/tag/archived archived] / [/system:page-tags/tag/decommissioned decommissioned] / [/system:page-tags/tag/joke joke] / [/system:page-tags/tag/neutralized neutralized] - These are sub-class tags that are used for //scp// pages of the appropriate type, which should also be tagged with their standard object class tag or //unclassed// if it does not have one or cannot be determined from the article's contents.
[!--
This is a hidden section for use by Nala, please disregard.
[/system:page-tags/tag/safe safe] - Page describes a Safe-class SCP.
[/system:page-tags/tag/euclid euclid] - Page describes a Euclid-class SCP.
[/system:page-tags/tag/keter keter] - Page describes a Keter-class SCP.
[/system:page-tags/tag/thaumiel thaumiel] - Page describes a Thaumiel-class SCP.
[/system:page-tags/tag/neutralized neutralized] - Page describes a Neutralized SCP. [/system:page-tags/tag/unclassed unclassed] - Page describes an SCP with a missing or non-standard object class. This should be used in addition to whatever the SCP was previously classified as, or //unclassed// if no original classification is given.
[/system:page-tags/tag/archived archived] - Page describes an Archived SCP. This should be used in addition to whatever the SCP was previously classified as, or //unclassed// if no original classification is given.
[/system:page-tags/tag/decommissioned decommissioned] - Page describes a Decommissioned SCP. This should be used in addition to whatever the SCP was previously classified as, or //unclassed// if no original classification is given.
[/system:page-tags/tag/joke joke] - Page describes a Joke SCP. This should be used in addition the object's standard object class, or //unclassed// if no such classification is given.
--]

* [/system:page-tags/tag/explained explained] - [[[scp-ex|Explained]]] SCPs are a special sub-type of //scp//, and should be added to -EX articles as appropriate. Explained articles should also be tagged with their standard object class tag, or //unclassed// if the format does not specify a standard object class.

* [/system:page-tags/tag/supplement supplement] - //supplement// pages are defined as experiment logs, incident logs, interviews, or other documents linked to by a //scp// page that do not make sense without context from their parent page. These pages should also have their parent page set to their originating article in order to maintain relevance and automatically create breadcrumb navigation. A page should only be tagged as //supplement// if they were created by the original author of the //scp// page, or with the original author's permission. Documents that are tributes or parodies should be tagged as //tale// instead, even if they are in the format of a log or transcript.

* [/system:page-tags/tag/experiment experiment] - This tag should only be used on //supplement// pages for pages that are primarily experiment logs (see: [[[SCP-914]]] >> [[[Experiment Log 914]]]). This tag **should not** be used on //scp// pages, even if they have extensive experiment logs.

* [/system:page-tags/tag/exploration exploration] - This tag should only be used on //supplement// pages for pages that are primarily exploration logs. This tag **should not** be used on //scp// pages, even if they have extensive exploration logs.

* [/system:page-tags/tag/incident incident] - This tag should only be used on //supplement// pages for pages that are primarily incident logs or transcripts (see: [[[SCP-555]]] >> [[[Incident Log 555-1]]]). This tag **should not** be used on //scp// pages, even if they have extensive incident logs.

* [/system:page-tags/tag/interview interview] - This tag should only be used on //supplement// pages for pages that are primarily interview transcripts (see: [[[SCP-277]]] >> [[[277interview|Interview 277-A]]]). This tag **should not** be used on //scp// pages, even if they have extensive interview transcripts.

* [/system:page-tags/tag/splash splash] - //splash// pages are used as 'cover pages' for certain articles. (see: [[[SCP-902]]] >> [[[902-warning|SCP-902 Warning]]] or [[[SCP-001]]])

* [/system:page-tags/tag/tale tale] - //tale// pages are stories, narratives, and transcripts that are written in a non-scientific manner, as well as incident logs, interviews, and reports that are not directly linked to any //scp// page. These may not necessarily be about any particular //scp//, and may not even be about a //scp// that exists, but should be about the Foundation or otherwise within the SCP Foundation universe. Compare to //creepypasta// below.

* [/system:page-tags/tag/creepypasta creepypasta] - //creepypasta// are //tale// pages that are unrelated to the SCP Foundation, and usually take the form of urban myths or campfire stories. A //creepypasta// page must be tagged with //tale// and is only appropriate for the SCP website if it's an original //creepypasta// by the posting author; we are not a repository for unattributed //creepypasta//.

* [/system:page-tags/tag/audio audio] - //audio// pages are pages with one or more audio files attached.

* [/system:page-tags/tag/collaboration collaboration] - //collaboration// pages are written or worked on by multiple authors, and thus cannot be directly attributed to any given author. //collaboration// is a subtag, and should be applied in parallel to either //tale//, //creepypasta//, or //project//, but not //scp//.

* [/system:page-tags/tag/contest contest] - //contest// pages are pages created for the purpose of community contests. This should be used in conjunction with //hub// in the case of entry listings, and should not be used on the entries themselves. These contests are only created by senior staff or with senior staff permission.

* [/system:page-tags/tag/project project] - //project// pages are used on the pages for certain community projects, such as the CCG and Game projects. --Please obtain senior staff permission before starting new project pages on the main wiki.-- Project pages are no longer allowed on the main wiki.

* [/system:page-tags/tag/author author] - This tag should be used for author profile pages. There should only be a single author profile page for each qualifying site member.

* [/system:page-tags/tag/guide guide] - These pages are writing guides, helpful hints, or other pages intended to assist authors contributing to the site. Guides are only tagged by senior staff, or with senior staff permission. See also //essay//.

* [/system:page-tags/tag/required required] - //required// pages are guides that are part of the required reading for joining the SCP Wiki.

* [/system:page-tags/tag/essay essay] - //essay// pages contain useful information on specific topics that may be helpful to authors writing related articles, but are different from a //guide// in that essays may be subjective and reflect the author's personal opinion.

* [/system:page-tags/tag/hub hub] - //hub// pages are pages with a large number of links to related pages. All of the SCP series pages are //hub// pages, as are the //tale// index and various other pages around the site. Index pages for //tale// series are also tagged as a //hub//, as well as //contest// entry listings.

* [/system:page-tags/tag/orphaned orphaned] - //orphaned// pages, usually //supplement// pages, are ones whose parent pages have been deleted, and no longer serve any purpose. Very rarely an //orphaned// page will have enough merit to be revised as a standalone //tale//, but they are usually eventually deleted by site moderators. //orphaned// is only used by senior staff; if you believe a page has been //orphaned//, please contact a staff member.

* [/system:page-tags/tag/sandbox sandbox] - These are pages that are sandboxes or workbenches, typically tied to an author's author profile page. **Please note that personal sandboxes are no longer allowed on the main site.** The SCP Sandbox wiki at http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/ should be used for article drafts. This tag is kept only for posterity and for experimental purposes that require that the main site be used, thus it is only used by senior staff.

* [/system:page-tags/tag/template template] - Template pages are for internal wiki use only. This tag should never be applied to articles.

* --[/system:page-tags/tag/scp-fuel scp-fuel] - //scp-fuel// is used for pages that contain "SCP Fuel" images and/or fragments, which are free to use by anyone who wants to incorporate them into new //scp// or //tale// pages.-- Main-site SCP Fuel pages are no longer in use. Please see the [http://visual-records.wikidot.com/ SCP Visual Records Wiki] for inspirational material.

* [/system:page-tags/tag/admin admin] - //admin// pages, as the name suggest, have some sort of official and/or historical significance. They should only be created by senior staff.

* [/system:page-tags/tag/featured featured] - Reserved by senior staff for designating [[[featured-scp-archive|Featured Articles]]] and [[[featured-tale-archive|Featured Tales]]].

* [/system:page-tags/tag/heritage heritage] - Reserved by senior staff for designating [[[heritage-collection|SCP Foundation Heritage Collection]]] articles.

[[tab Attribute Tags]]
++ Attribute Tags
This list is intended as a guide to attribute tags, or secondary tags on SCP articles. When choosing tags for an article, keep in mind that you want to keep the list as short as possible; the goal should be to choose tags that are already being used, rather than create a new one. If staff should determine that a new tag is necessary, they can always retroactively tag articles as necessary. If you would like to suggest a new tag, please do so in the discussion thread for this page.

[[tab Tag FAQ]]
++ FAQ
This explains the difference between commonly misused or misunderstood tags. If you think any of these might apply to your SCP, please read this thoroughly. If you're still not sure, ask a staff member.

+++ organic vs. biological vs. alive
* Something that is **//organic//** is composed of, or relates to organic compounds, such as proteins, fats, or other substances that are related to or used by living things, but not living themselves.
* Something that is **//biological//** has elements of living things, such as living tissue, organs, or other things that we would recognize as being parts of organisms, but does not show traits of actually being alive (see below). Anything that is //biological// is by default //organic//, and doesn't need to be tagged as both.
* Something that is **//alive//** conforms to the traits of living things. These vary from biologist to biologist, but generally has all of the following traits:
 * **metabolism** - All living things consume energy, use it to catalyze live processes, and excrete waste in some form (even if it's just heat).
 * **reaction** - All living things react to their environment: they chase or seek out things that they perceive as food and stay away from things that are perceived as dangerous. Even plants will turn their leaves towards the sun in order to maximize their photosynthetic potential.
 * **reproduction** - All living things reproduce, either sexually or asexually.
* Something that is //alive// is by default //biological// and //organic//, and does not need to be tagged as all three.
+++ parasitic vs. contagion vs. self-replicating vs. reproductive
* A **//parasitic//** entity is something that "feeds off" another entity. This is distinct from a //mutualistic// relationship because a //parasitic// entity does not help the host in any way; it's purely harmful. This can refer to both parasites, which simply live off and harm the host, and parasitoids, which kill the host, and neither have to necessary be biological or living in the context of the Foundation.
* A **//contagion//** is something that infects something else, and once infected, spreads to other uninfected individuals. In the context of the Foundation, this may not be a biological process, and this is distinct from a //parasitic// entity because a contagion becomes indistinguishable from the host, whereas a parasite remains a distinct entity from its host. A computer virus is also considered a //contagion//.
* A **//self-replicating//** object is something that makes copies of itself. It may accomplish this either through budding/splitting, or by turning other things or raw materials into instances. This usually, but is not always, a non-biological process.
* A **//reproductive//** object affects the biological reproductive process of a living organism. This usually means that it uses the reproductive system or organs of another living organism to make copies of itself, and is always a biological process by nature of what it is. This is distinct from a //parasite// in that it actually hijacks the reproductive process; something that merely feeds off the uterine lining of an affected animal would be a //parasite//, but something that imitates a fetus and forces the host to undergo the normal processes of pregnancy would be //reproductive//.
* //parasitic// and //contagion// are generally mutually exclusive; you can only be one or the other. //self-replicating// and //reproductive// are also generally mutually exclusive, except in extreme circumstances.
+++ compulsion vs. cognitohazard vs. mind-affecting vs. memetic
* A **//compulsion//** is something that compels subjects to do something that they normally might not do. This is distinct from a //cognitohazard// because it does not require line of sight or any perception of the source; sometimes mere proximity is enough. This is distinct from //mind-affecting// because it's not an overriding force that **makes** you do it, it's best described as a strong urge or feeling of intense curiosity. This is also distinct from from //mind-affecting// because it's usually temporary; once a subject is removed from the presence of the //compulsion//-generating object, they will usually recover (even if it takes a long time).
* A **//cognitohazard//** is something that poses a danger to any subject that perceives it with any of our five physical senses: sight (//visual//), hearing (//auditory//), smell (//olfactory//), taste (//gustatory//), and touch (//tactile//). This applies to both things that cause physical harm as well as things that cause psychological damage, but only in a way that would be anomalous. A bright light that causes blindness would not be a //cognitohazard//, nor would a sharp edge that cuts you when you touch it. A sound that causes you to bleed from every pore or a smell that causes you to go insane would be a //cognitohazard//.
* A **//mind-affecting//** effect is one that (usually permanently) affects the way a subject thinks (most commonly by altering personality or behavior, or inducing psychiatric conditions). This is distinct from a //compulsion// because of its permanence and in that this is usually an intense obsession, not just a mild urge.
* A **//memetic//** agent is best described as "infectious information". It is a piece of data in a subject's mind that has an anomalous effect on that subject's physical or mental state that is spread when anyone else becomes aware of the same information. All //memetic// agents are //cognitohazards// as you can't be exposed to information without observing it somehow, but not all //cognitohazards// are //memetic//.
+++ memetic vs. infohazard vs. meta
* An **//infohazard//** is an object that has an effect that triggers whenever you refer to it or describe it. This is separate from a //memetic// agent because it is still an object, not a piece of information. [[[SCP-426]]] is a prime example of an infohazard; whenever you refer to it, you always speak about it in the first person.
* A **//meta//** object is an object that affects its documentation, is affected by its documentation, or has containment procedures that extend to its documentation. This sometimes overlaps with //infohazard//, but is distinct. [[[SCP-048]]] is a prime example of this; documenting an object as SCP-048 causes accidents to happen, but speaking about SCP-048 or explaining it is harmless.
+++ acoustic vs. auditory vs. audio
* An **//acoustic//** effect is something that is a sound wave or other type of compression wave. This means that it has to have something to act as a medium (such as air or water), and means that it exists independent of an audience. Something that can be heard by subjects but can be recorded as well is probably //acoustic//.
* An **//auditory//** effect is something that specifically refers to the sense of hearing. Something that can be heard by one or more subjects but cannot be recorded or picked up by others is an //auditory// //hallucination//. //auditory// can also be referred to //cognitohazard//s if the act of hearing triggers an effect.
* **//audio//** is a major tag (see below), used on pages to designate that there is an audio file attached to it. It is not an attribute, and should not be included on pages that merely describe an SCP with an audio component.
+++ extraterrestrial vs extradimensional vs future vs ectoentropic
* An **//extraterrestrial//** object is one that is "not of the Earth", meaning it is either in space or came from space. This applies to all such objects, be they organic (alien life), artificial (alien artifacts), or non-artificial (asteroids and other celestial bodies).
* An **//extradimensional//** object either originates from or enables travel to or from a plane of existence, parallel universe, or timeline other than our own. Any object described as having been produced by a culture or civilization "not known to history" may generally be considered //extradimensional// if it is beyond a reasonable doubt that it could not have simply been a civilization that was lost to history or otherwise from the //future//.
* A **//future//** object is an object that was displaced from a later temporal time frame into an earlier one. This still applies to objects that are no longer from "our" future so long as it was considered "from the future" at some point in time.
* An **//ectoentropic//** object produces energy or matter from an unknown source in such a way as to be generally considered "from nothing". Any object that produces objects from an //extradimensional// or //future// source does not qualify for this attribute, even if we do not know an exact origin for said objects.
