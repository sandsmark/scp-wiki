title:Tag Guide
A non-comprehensive list of the most commonly used page tags, and how they should be used. At time of writing, many pages are still being revised and re-tagged, but please follow these guidelines for future tagging as these tags are also used by bots to index the main site.

The tags listed on this page are primarily tags that describe the **type** of page it is. For specific attributes of SCP pages, please see the **[[[Attribute Tag Guide]]]**.

Special thanks to **Quikngruvn** and **TroyL** for their help in putting this list together!

++++ [/system:page-tags/tag/scp scp]
All SCP articles from the main blocks ([[[scp-series|Series I]]] and [[[scp-series-2|Series II]]]), [[[scp-001|001 proposals]]], [[[joke-scps|jokes]]] (-J), [[[archived-scps|archives]]] (-ARC), and [[[decommissioned-scps|decommissions]]] (-D) should be tagged with //scp//. Note that [[[scp-ex|explained]]] (-EX) articles are considered //tale// pages, and **should not** be tagged with //scp//.

++++ [/system:page-tags/tag/safe safe] / [/system:page-tags/tag/euclid euclid] / [/system:page-tags/tag/keter keter]
All SCP articles tagged as //scp// should also be tagged with the appropriate tag for their object class. Articles that are dual-classed (such as safe/euclid) should be tagged with both of their constituent classes, though we would prefer that they be revised to a single class instead as dual-classed SCPs have slowly been phased out.

++++ [/system:page-tags/tag/archived archived] / [/system:page-tags/tag/decommissioned decommissioned] / [/system:page-tags/tag/joke joke]
These tags should be used for //scp// pages of the appropriate type.

++++ [/system:page-tags/tag/supplement supplement]
//supplement// pages are defined as experiment logs, incident logs, interviews, or other documents linked to by a //scp// page that do not make sense without context from their parent page. These pages should also have their parent page set to their originating article in order to maintain relevance and automatically create breadcrumb navigation. A page should only be tagged as //supplement// if they were created by the original author of the //scp// page, or with the original author's permission. Documents that are tributes or parodies should be tagged as //tale// instead, even if they are in the format of a log or transcript.

++++ [/system:page-tags/tag/experiment experiment]
This tag should only be used on //supplement// pages for pages that are primarily experiment logs (see: [[[SCP-914]]] >> [[[Experiment Log 914]]]). This tag **should not** be used on //scp// pages, even if they have extensive experiment logs.

++++ [/system:page-tags/tag/incident incident]
This tag should only be used on //supplement// pages for pages that are primarily incident logs or transcripts (see: [[[SCP-555]]] >> [[[Incident Log 555-1]]]). This tag **should not** be used on //scp// pages, even if they have extensive incident logs.

++++ [/system:page-tags/tag/interview interview]
This tag should only be used on //supplement// pages for pages that are primarily interview transcripts (see: [[[SCP-277]]] >> [[[277interview|Interview 277-A]]]). This tag **should not** be used on //scp// pages, even if they have extensive interview transcripts.

++++ [/system:page-tags/tag/splash splash]
//splash// pages are very rare pages that serve as 'cover pages' for certain articles. This **should not** be overused. (see: [[[SCP-902]]] >> [[[902-warning|SCP-902 Warning]]] or [[[SCP-001]]])

++++ [/system:page-tags/tag/tale tale]
//tale// pages are stories, narratives, and transcripts that are written in a non-scientific manner, as well as incident logs, interviews, and reports that are not directly linked to by a //scp// page. These may not necessarily be about any particular //scp//, and may not even be about a //scp// that exists, but should otherwise exist within the SCP Foundation universe. A //tale// page cannot be a //creepypasta// page at the same time. (Compare to //creepypasta//, below.)

++++ [/system:page-tags/tag/ex ex]
[[[scp-ex|Explained]]] SCPs are a special sub-type of //tale//, and should be added to -EX articles as appropriate.

++++ [/system:page-tags/tag/creepypasta creepypasta]
//creepypasta// are short stories or narratives in the form of urban legends or urban myths. These are usually but not necessarily completely unrelated to the SCP Foundation, and usually take the form of killer-in-your-house stories and other creepy stories. A //creepypasta// page cannot be a //tale// page at the same time. (Compare to //tale//, above.)

++++ [/system:page-tags/tag/collaboration collaboration]
//collaboration// pages are written or worked on by multiple authors, and thus cannot be directly attributed to any given author. //collaboration// is a subtag, and should be applied in parallel to either //tale//, //creepypasta//, //contest//, or //project//, but usually not //scp//.

++++ [/system:page-tags/tag/contest contest]
//contest// pages are pages created as part of an on-site writing contest, and should be used for both introduction/rules pages as well as contest entries. These contests are typically only created by senior staff or by senior staff permission.

++++ [/system:page-tags/tag/project project]
//project// pages are used on the pages for certain community projects, such as the CCG and Game projects. Please obtain senior staff permission before starting new project pages on the main wiki.

++++ [/system:page-tags/tag/author author]
This tag should be used for author profile pages. There should only be a single author profile page for each site member.

++++ [/system:page-tags/tag/guide guide]
These pages are writing guides, helpful hints, or other pages intended to assist authors contributing to the site. Guides should only be tagged as such by senior staff, or with senior staff permission.

++++ [/system:page-tags/tag/hub hub]
//hub// pages are pages with a large number of links to related pages. All of the SCP series pages are //hub// pages, as are the //tale// index and various other pages around the site. Pages outside of the aforementioned are often also tagged as //collaboration//, //project//, or //tale//, and are usually only created with senior staff approval.

++++ [/system:page-tags/tag/orphaned orphaned]
//orphaned// pages, usually //supplement// pages, are ones for whom their parent pages have been deleted, and no longer serve any purpose. Very rarely an //orphaned// page will have enough merit to be revised as a standalone //tale//, but they are usually eventually deleted by site moderators.

++++ [/system:page-tags/tag/sandbox sandbox]
These are pages that are sandboxes or workbenches, typically tied to an author's author profile page. **Please note that personal sandboxes are no longer allowed on the main site.** The SCP Sandbox wiki at [http://sandbox.scp-wiki.net] should be used for article and tale drafts. This tag is kept only for posterity, and for experimental purposes that require that the main site be used.

++++ [/system:page-tags/tag/template template]
These are templates for //supplement// pages, though usage of this tag is rare and may be phasing out.

++++ [/system:page-tags/tag/scp-fuel scp-fuel]
//scp-fuel// is used for pages that contain "SCP Fuel" images and/or fragments, which are free to use by anyone who wants to incorporate them into new //scp// or //tale// pages.

++++ [/system:page-tags/tag/admin admin]
//admin// pages, as the name suggest, have some sort of official and/or historical significance. They should only be created by senior staff.
