+++ What is a tag, and what are they used for?
A tag is a keyword we apply to a page on this wiki. This keyword allows you to find all pages with similar elements.

Which brings us to...

+++ Where are these tags?
Go to the bottom of any page on the wiki. You'll see small divider bar and below that a list of words in a smaller red typeface. Those are tags. You can click on them to get to a list of things tagged with that tag. If you're not seeing any, we haven't gotten round to applying them.

+++ What tags are there?

+++ When I edit the tags for my tale, there's a strange tag with an underscore?
That's right. Tags prefixed with an underscore are hidden tags. We use a small bit of CSS in the site theme to literally hide them from view. They're used to index your tale for the tales hubs. Don't delete them, or your tale won't show up in the listings.
