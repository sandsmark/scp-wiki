>  Open Mic Night at Stacker's THURSDAYS 10:00pm

The stage beckons. Samuel doesn't know where he is but his heart is full to bursting. 

He picks up a lonely guitar. It feels right in his hands. The microphone sits patiently.

"I offer this song in my own voice."

Where can I go?
I’m still trapped in my own nightmare
Where am I now?
Now and then I find you on my mind
Now and then I think
Maybe I’ll never wake up
But I can hear you out there singing

What do you do now when it rains?
What do you do now when you see a falling star?
Hearing your voice again is a bittersweet memory
I just want to wake up ‘cause

I can’t stop dreaming 
I can’t stop dreaming
I can’t stop scheming my own escape
I can’t stop thinking
I can’t stop listening

I can’t stop

I can’t stop making the same mistakes

The guitar drops on the floor. 

The stage is empty once more. 

The microphone waits for another.

'Til next week.
