[[size large]] **Description:** [[/size]]

Threat entity is a female Caucasian of average build, named Penny Williams. Threat entity is a former employee of the SCP Foundation, but an unknown incident resulted in her developing anomalous traits.

Threat entity's primary ability is that any form of currency within a certain area around itself becomes detached from the abstract concept of money. Affected currency ceases to be considered as legal tender on a conceptual basis, despite being fundamentally unchanged. This effect is able to deconceptualize standard cash and change, but also extends to credit or debit cards, which remain considered as legal tender to automated registers and scanners, but cause confusion to humans due to their lack of conceptual value. The effect on digital currency remain unknown, as it lacks a physical location. This effect persists even after the affected currency is no longer within the radius of deconceptualization.

It is currently estimated that over twelve million dollars have been lost to deconceptualization. The area of the effect around the threat entity appears to be expanding at an exponential rate, albeit at a currently low one, but is expected to encompass the entirety of the planet within the next three years.

Threat entity's secondary ability is that it can witness events up to a few days into its own future. This has caused immense difficulty for Coalition forces, as it is able to witness Coalition capture attempts before they even occur. However, it is apparently only able to witness events around its future location, meaning that private deliberations may still be carried out without its knowledge.

[[size large]]**Liquidation:**[[/size]]

Due to Williams' primary ability, it has been concluded that termination of the entity would be a preferable option to containment, as her area of effect is ever-growing and cannot be halted or secured by any known means. However, termination of Williams is of incredible difficulty, due to her secondary ability, and that she perceives GOC operatives as a threat.

As a result, the following outline has been prepared, as a rough draft of a termination operation.
# The GOC forms an agreement with an individual or group which Williams places trust in.
# Said entity coerces Williams into some form of containment unit or enclosed area, which she would be unable to escape alone.
# Termination of Williams commences, at least three days after initial containment, via widespread application of deadly force across entirety of enclosed area (e.g. toxic fumes, spread gunfire).

The following represents the message correspondence between the SCP Foundation and Director Maria Kane of the Global Occult Coalition, regarding Penny Williams.

> **Sender:** Dir. Maria Kane, GOC
> **Recipient:** SCP Foundation
> 
> To our associates at the SCP Foundation,
> 
> It has come to the attention of both of our organizations that a nigh-uncontainable entity, a former Foundation employee, has been wreaking immense havoc across the United States, only encouraged by efforts to capture her. While her secondary ability would already be of great threat to normalcy, her primary ability forces widespread damage in a large area, which is continuously expanding and will inevitably be noticed.
> 
> We understand that one of the primary disparities between our organizations is that you would prefer the containment of anomalous objects, even if it comes with great risk, whilst our own organization is far more liberal in this regard. We would like to be clear that the proposal we intend to make would not be made if we didn't judge the gravity of the situation to be this severe.
> 
> We would like to request your assistance in the termination of Penny Williams, a former member of your organization. Her effects cannot be contained while she is alive, and she is almost completely impossible to either terminate or even adequately contain, as she perceives the Coalition as an immediate threat. We believe that your organization can establish a sort of trust with her, convincing her that they only seek to contain her, and then lull her into a false sense of security, allowing for a more efficient method of termination. A complete outline of the proposed operation is attached with the given file, and we can discuss the details if you agree to assist us.

> **Sender:** SCP Foundation
> **Recipient:** Dir. Kane, GOC
> 
> We are interested in your proposal regarding SCP-3992, or KTE-8686, and the research team for SCP-3992 has expressed a similar interest. However, there are certain policies that must be recognized before your request can be fully considered. The destruction of anomalous objects can only be authorized by our [[[Mission: Decommission|Decommissioning Department]]]. An authorization form has been attached to this message, and will be relayed to the Decom. Dept. upon completion. Certain variables have been pre-filled for your convenience.

> **Sender:** Dir. Kane, GOC

> **Item #:** SCP-3992 (KTE-8686)

> **Object Class:** Keter

> **Head Researcher:** Jacob Seigert
> 
> **Supporting Personnel:**
> * //A. Ferril - Representing Foundation Treasury and Finances Dept.//
> * //Dir. M. Kane - Representing Global Occult Coalition//

> **Please check off or fill in the applicable boxes regarding the reasons for submitting your proposal:** [Replace ☐ with a ☑ if applicable.]
> ☑ Excessively High Risk of Lifted Veil Scenario
> ☐ Excessive Danger
> ☐ Ability to Decom. Apollyon-Class Object
> ☑ Expense
> ☐ Ethical Concerns Over Necessary Containment
> ☐ Legal Concerns
> ☑ High Risk of K-Class Scenario (if so, please state which type(s): B (Anomalous Economic or Political Collapse))
> ☐ Other (please state): 
> 
> **Summary:** KTE-8686 is both near-uncontainable and widely threatening. Its abilities present both an easily recognizable anomalous effect, as well as a threat to the global economy and functionality. The only adequate method of preventing a breach of normalcy would be its termination, which requires assistance from your SCP Foundation. //- Dir. M. Kane, GOC//

> **Sender:** SCP Foundation, Decommissioning Department
> **Recipient:** Dir. Kane, GOC
> 
> Your proposal has been accepted. We look forward to future correspondence and cooperation regarding SCP-3992's decommissioning.

Following negotiations, the SCP Foundation and the GOC organized a joint operation aimed at the termination of KTE-8686.

The following interview was conducted between KTE-8686 and an SCP Foundation agent. KTE-8686 was restrained, as the interview began exactly three minutes and three days before KTE-8686's scheduled termination, for experimental purposes.

> **[BEGIN LOG]**
> 
> **Interviewer:** Hello, SCP-3992. How are you feeling today?
> 
> **KTE-8686:** I'm alright, thank you. Still getting used to the SCP designation, everything's been changing so much.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Understandable. I just have a few questions to ask you.
> 
> **KTE-8686:** May I ask a quick question first please?
> 
> **Interviewer:** Sure, go ahead.
> 
> **KTE-8686:** Has there been any progress on a treatment or a cure for me, for my primary... anomaly?
> 
> **Interviewer:** Well, we have an idea for how to deal with your primary anomalous properties. We'll be moving forward with it in a few days.
> 
> **KTE-8686:** //[Sighs.]// Thank you. If everything works out, will I be free?
> 
> **Interviewer:** If the operation is successful, then yes, the SCP-3992 slot will be redesignated, and you will no longer be an SCP object.
> 
> **KTE-8686:** Wonderful. I'm looking forward to it. Sorry about that, what were you gonna ask me?
> 
> **Interviewer:** I mostly wanted to get your account of how you gained your anomalous properties. We have a report of what happened, we just want your statement on the incident.
> 
> **KTE-8686:** //[Shrugs.]// I'm not sure what new stuff I can tell you.
> 
> **Interviewer:** It's protocol, we just want to be sure.
> 
> **KTE-8686:** Right. Well, we were running tests on [[[SCP-978]]], and we'd scheduled in SCP-682 for testing, to test for sapience or- wait, what happened to those two objects, may I ask?
> 
> **Interviewer:** //[To monitoring personnel.]// Is she allowed to know?
> 
> **Monitor:** //[Relayed privately to interviewer's earpiece.]// That's fine, just stall until we get the results we need.
> 
> **Interviewer:** 978 managed to survive the resulting explosion. 682 was destroyed in the blast though, and the slot was [[[SCP-682|redesignated]]].
> 
> **KTE-8686:** Ah, okay. Well, I survived the explosion, obviously, and then the next thing I knew I'd woken up in the lab. I knew about the future-seeing stuff almost immediately. But the money thing took me a bit longer, when I was trying to access a vending machine. By that point, I figured it was a matter of time before everyone else found out, so I panicked and ran away.
> 
> **Interviewer:** I see. Something we did notice was that you had a tendency to avoid populated areas while you were away, was this deliberate?
> 
> **KTE-8686:** I mean, yeah. I didn't want my abilities to end up causing damage, especially for people who actually needed money.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Understandable. //[At this moment, the time changes to 10:00, exactly three days before the termination of KTE-8686 is scheduled.]// Now, could you-
> 
> **KTE-8686:** //[Begins screaming.]// Wait, what? Why are you doing this, I-
> 
> **Interviewer:** SCP-3992, could you please-
> 
> **KTE-8686:** You said you wouldn't hurt me! That I'd be safe here! //[Begins crying.]//
> 
> **Interviewer:** Again, SCP-
> 
> **KTE-8686:** Don't call me that! Don't! I want to be safe! You're going to kill me! Please-
> 
> **Interviewer:** I believe we have the results we need, this interview is over.
> 
> **KTE-8686:** //[Attempts to break free of restraints.]// You said you'd help! I don't want to die!
>
