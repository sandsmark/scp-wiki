**Special Containment Procedures:** The area containing SCP-3000, currently a region of the Bay of Bengal roughly 300km in diameter, is to be routinely patrolled by Foundation naval vessels. Under no circumstances are civilians allowed to attempt deep sea exploration or diving efforts in the quarantined area. Individuals believed to have contacted SCP-3000 are to be contained, quarantined, and processed at Site-151. Individuals affected by the anomalous properties of SCP-3000 are to be held in containment indefinitely. 

The Foundation nuclear submarine //SCPF Eremita// is to monitor the location of the foremost section of SCP-3000, currently located within the Ganges Fan, roughly 0.7 km beneath the Bay. The //Eremita// is tasked with carrying out the Atzak Protocol, and staffing regulations onboard the vessel are subject to the guidelines of that protocol. For a full description of the Atzak Protocol, see Addendum 3000.2.

There is currently no known cure for exposure to SCP-3000; as such, affected individuals should be contained and quarantined for further evaluation. Individuals stationed aboard the //SCPF Eremita// are not permitted to leave the vessel except for the purposes of carrying out the necessary procedures of the Atzak Protocol. Individuals who leave the vessel without proper authorization are to be considered lost. 

Under no circumstances should any individual interact with SCP-3000 without authorization.

**Description:** SCP-3000 is a massive, aquatic, serpentine entity strongly resembling a giant moray eel (//Gymnothorax javanicus//). The full length of SCP-3000 is impossible to determine, but is hypothesized to be between 600 and 900 kilometers. With the exception of its length, SCP-3000 is similarly proportioned to a giant moray eel.

SCP-3000 is a typically sedentary creature, only moving its head in response to certain stimuli or during feeding. The majority of its body is located in and around the Ganges Fan[[footnote]]Specifically within several canyons throughout the region.[[/footnote]], and rarely moves at all.

SCP-3000 is carnivorous, and despite its sedentary nature is capable of moving quickly to dispatch prey. Despite its size, it is hypothesized that SCP-3000 does not actually require sustenance to maintain its biological functions[[footnote]]Due to this, SCP-3000's internal biology is believed to be similarly anomalous.[[/footnote]]. While SCP-3000 excretes a thin layer of a viscous, dark grey substance classified as Y-909 (//see Addendum 3000.2 below//) through its skin as it consumes prey, the end result of its digestive processes is currently unknown.

SCP-3000 is a Class VIII cognitohazardous entity, and direct observation of SCP-3000 is capable of severely mentally altering individuals who do so. Individuals who directly observe SCP-3000, as well as any individuals within an uncertain distance of SCP-3000, experience inexplicable head pain, paranoia, general fear and panic, and memory loss or alteration. The following is a log from Site-151's historical records, written by Dr. Eugene Getts, about initial discovery of SCP-3000 and the effects felt therein:

> //...the unease was felt throughout the entire crew as we descended on that first night. Whether this was due to our uncertainty at what we would discover, or something more sinister, I would not speculate. As we continued to descend, Williams began sweating profusely, much to the concern of the rest of team. When asked about it, he could not respond, stating that he thought he was missing something he could not deduce. As our descent continued, he began to act more and more erratically, at one point addressing myself as "Darlene" and expressing uncertainty as to the tasks he was assigned to handle.//
> 
> //Similar feelings were expressed by other members of the crew, but Williams felt it the most. His memetic resistance was by far the lowest of all of us, but he was a biologist, not a memeticist. When we finally came into contact with the entity, he began whimpering and had to be sedated. I remember him muttering the word "no" over and over again, as if in disbelief. He went silent after a while as we approached the head, and when I looked back at him something had gone from his eyes. He did not even so much as blink as we made our final descent.//
> 
> //At around 0940 hours, we first observed the head of the entity. The unease was palpable now, several other crew members complained of feeling "hazy" and of being uncertain what they were supposed to be doing. Captain Ritter, ever the man's man, wrote it all off as nitrogen intoxication and forced them to continue approaching the entity.//
> 
> //When we were within fifty meters, the entity turned slowly to look at us. I can still hear Williams as we watched this thing coil around in the darkness, barking like a mad dog in the rear of the vessel. Screaming and flailing, shouting about how he could see it in his head. Perkins and Harrison tried to restrain him, but he got free and smashed his face in against one of the portholes. He hit it so hard he cracked the inner layer of glass. The damage was bad enough that we had to surface.//
> 
> //We tried to give Williams medical attention, but he was too far gone at that point. He had pulped himself against the glass, and despite the trauma he still spoke briefly as he lay dying. Nobody recorded it, we didn't think to at the time. But I remember it well enough. He said, "there's nothing, nothing, nothing." By the time we had reached the surface several hours later, Williams was dead. At the time, I didn't think much about what he had said. Just the ravings of a man gone mad by the depths, I figured. I didn't know any better.//
> 
> //But even now, I can still see the eyes of the creature. I see it hanging there in the darkness, illuminated by a light I cannot source. And I feel the lingering dread that Williams must have felt that night in the submersible, as he was overcome by whatever void that foul thing slithered out of.//

**Discovery:** SCP-3000 was discovered in 1971, shortly after two Bangladeshi fishing boats and fifteen fishermen were reported missing after drifting near the Indian coast. As the country of Bangladesh had only been recently established at the time, and had been subject to significant political persecution on the part of Pakistan, this incident received high profile media attention due to fears that it was a result of foreign aggression. Local coastal dispatch units could not locate the missing boats, fueling further media hysteria. 

Foundation researchers stationed in Calcutta (now Kolkata) drew similarities between this disappearance and another incident two years earlier. A thorough search aided by Mariotte-Pashler Counters revealed the location of the two boats, as well as an unknown, previously undiscovered mass deep below the surface of the Bay of Bengal. Further investigation by Foundation divers discovered the existence of SCP-3000.

It is theorized that the boats ran out of fuel and drifted into the area directly above SCP-3000, most likely as a result of human error rather than SCP-3000's anomalous effects. The entity did not display signs of hostility, or even any significant action at all, during initial containment. The boats were found with the emaciated corpses of the several of the crew members inside, and were moved to a different site. Post-containment investigation of the vessels ascertained the identities of nine of the crew members, but six members were never located.

The area was quickly secured, and current containment procedures were put in place in April of 1972; the Atzak Protocol was adapted in October of 1998.

**Addendum 3000.1:** Initial Contact Exploration Log

//Note: The following is the transcript of audio logs taken during initial contact between Foundation deep-sea divers and SCP-3000. Until this point, no individual had come within 300m of the head of SCP-3000. Divers were tasked with assessing the creature, and determining the source of the thick, grey fluid that had been observed floating around its head.//

//Dive team was composed of three members of MTF Orion-9 “Kingfishers”, lead by MTF O-9 Alpha. Launch point was through the airlock of the Foundation submarine SCPF Stravinsky. All divers were equipped with high-pressure suits, as well as front-facing headlamps. Additionally, a tether was connected to MTF O-9 Alpha, which was then connected in a “T” shape out to both Bravo and Foxtrot.//

> [BEGIN LOG]
> 
> **Alpha:** Alright command. We’re situated in the airlock, and ready to roll. 
> 
> **Command:** Confirmed. Go ahead and sound off.
> 
> **Alpha:** Orion-9 Alpha, check.
> 
> **Bravo:** Orion-9 Bravo, check.
> 
> **Command:** Alright, men - we’re in position about 500m from the head of this creature. Make sure your tethers are on good and tight, we don’t want any of you getting separated out there.
> 
> **Bravo:** What’s visibility like down here today, command?
> 
> **Command:** Standby.
> 
> **Command:** About three meters.
> 
> **Foxtrot:** So it’s dark as fuck. Got it. 
> 
> **Bravo:** Why are we so far out?
> 
> **Command:** The size of this thing is hard to comprehend, and it’s wrapped up in itself in several places. We can’t get too close because there’s too much body there. The entity hasn’t moved in about three weeks.
> 
> **Foxtrot:** At all?
> 
> **Command:** Affirmative. It moves slightly with the currents down here, but nothing more than that. If it weren’t for the head movement that was observed by the first submersible team, we probably wouldn’t know if it was alive or not.
> 
> **Foxtrot:** That’s reassuring.
> 
> **Alpha:** Alright, tethers are tight. Flood the chamber.
> 
> **Command:** Confirmed.
> 
> //Rushing water is heard as the airlock chamber floods. No other sound is heard for several minutes. After some time, the sound of rushing water stops.//
> 
> **Alpha:** You both good?
> 
> **Bravo:** I’m good.
> 
> **Foxtrot:** It’s fucking cold.
> 
> **Alpha:** Hopefully we won't be out for long then. Turn on your lights boys, Here we go.
> 
> //All members of the dive team exit the airlock. There is a low mechanical sound as the airlock door closes behind them. A muffled click sound is heard, and the Stravinsky activates its aft floodlights.//
> 
> **Foxtrot:** Hey Alpha, I uh-- maybe this is a bad time to ask, but I can’t remember how to turn on my lamp, and-
> 
> **Alpha:** Your lamp is on, Foxtrot.
> 
> **Foxtrot:** It-- what? (//Pauses//) What did you call me?
> 
> **Alpha:** Your designation, Mulhaney. Foxtrot.
> 
> **Bravo:** I’m Foxtrot, boss.
> 
> **Alpha:** Hang on, what are you talking about?
> 
> **Foxtrot:** I don’t understand what you mean by “designation”.
> 
> **Alpha:** It’s your goddamn call sign, Bravo, what do you mean--
> 
> **Bravo:** Who’s Bravo?
> 
> **Alpha:** I-- uh, shit, hang on. I was going to say something. Barry[[footnote]]O-9 Alpha is believed to have been addressing a former member of the command team assigned to SCP-3000, Barry Hughes, who had passed away two years prior.[[/footnote]], are you still there?
> 
> **Command:** Standby. (//Pause//) Go for command.
> 
> **Alpha:** Hey, we’re having a little trouble out here, I’m not sure who… we seems to have some confusion over designations, and I’m not sure where we’re going.
> 
> **Foxtrot:** Where exactly are we?
> 
> **Bravo:** God, do you-- do you guys feel that? I’ve just got an awful headache, it’s like needling in my brain, something…  
> 
> **Command:** Dive team, be advised that we believe you may be experiencing some detrimental cognitive effects. Keep moving forward, and we’ll give your more information as we receive it.
> 
> **Alpha:** Noted. Command, be advised that Foxtrot has a... uh... terrible headache. I think… are we going in the right direction? We can’t see out here.
> 
> **Command:** You are roughly 150m from the head of the entity, Alpha. You should be getting a visual soon. 
> 
> **Bravo:** Command, I don’t see anything, where are we?
> 
> **Alpha:** Where are we?
> 
> **Command:** We're almost there, Alpha - dive team, be advised, we’re picking up movement from the entity on radar.
> 
> **Alpha:** I-- Barry, I don’t see anything down here, what are we supposed to be looking-
> 
> **Foxtrot:** I’m standing over a vortex that spirals into a singularity, a silence that goes on forever, and my thoughts are being sucked out of my head and into this-
> 
> **Alpha:** Shut up, shut up, shut up - Command, Bravo is unresponsive, requesting immediate cessation of mission-
> 
> **Bravo:** Wait a second-
> 
> **Foxtrot:** --on the edge of the nothingness, teetering at the brink, a god shaped hole. The barren desolation of a fallen and failed creation. Beyond me is only blackness, and a single pair of dark eyes-
> 
> **Alpha:** What? What are you saying?
> 
> **Command:** Dive team, we’re going to pull you back in immediately, we have reason to believe that--
> 
> **Alpha:** Barry? Is that you? How can it be? I shoveled the dirt during your--
> 
> **Bravo:** I can hear something over there, Alpha, your light, get your fucking--
> 
> **Foxtrot:** --silent oblivion, my consciousness coming undone and only and only and only-
> 
> **Command:** Dive team, something is moving toward you, repeat, something is moving toward you, prepare to return to-
> 
> **Alpha:** Ah, this is shit. I can’t see. How far are we from the-
> 
> **Bravo:** It’s right there! It’s right there! Fuck! What are you both doing? Fuck!
> 
> **Foxtrot:** --and only the eel remains.
> 
> //Radio silence for twenty seconds.//
> 
> **Command:** Alpha?
> 
> //Radio silence for thirteen seconds.//
> 
> **Command:** Alpha? Bravo? Foxtrot? Do any of you hear us?
> 
> **Bravo:** (//Unintelligible//)
> 
> **Command:** Oh, thank God - Bravo, you need to speak up, we can’t--
> 
> **Bravo:** //Shhhhhhhh//.
> 
> //Radio silence for ten seconds.//
> 
> **Command:** Something has bound up the winch between you and us, we can’t--
> 
> **Alpha:** It’s opening its mouth.
> 
> **Bravo:** It’s so dark, there’s-- ah-
> 
> **Foxtrot:** Where am I? What--
> 
> **Alpha:** Barry? How can it be? I shoveled dirt-
> 
> **Bravo:** Mulhaney… swim, get away, there’s only darkness, swim--
> 
> **Foxtrot:** Only-
> 
> //There is suddenly tension in the tether attached to the Stravinsky. O-9 Foxtrot’s radio goes silent. There is the sound of a struggle through the other two radios.//
> 
> **Command:** Foxtrot? Foxtrot? Alpha? Bravo? Talk to me, stay calm, what happened?
> 
> **Bravo:** It ate him, fuck, he’s gone, it took him whole, he-- goddammit, Alpha, what are you doing?
> 
> **Alpha:** Alpha?
> 
> **Bravo:** Cut the fucking goddamn tether Alpha, it’s pulling us in!
> 
> **Alpha:** Who?
> 
> **Bravo:** Fuck!
> 
> **Alpha:** (//Silence//) Ah--
> 
> //Total radio silence for 30 seconds. Tether attached to Stravinsky is pulled free from its moorings and disappears.//
> 
> **Command:** Alpha, Bravo, do you copy?
> 
> //Radio silence for five seconds.//
> 
> **Command:** Alpha, Bravo, do you copy?
> 
> **Bravo:** This is Bravo, I’m… I’m floating in the dark. I can see shapes moving through the fog, but they’re hard to make out. I cut my tether, Alpha wouldn’t-- I think he’s gone. I don’t see his light anymore. 
> 
> **Command:** Acknowledged. We’re coming to-
> 
> **Bravo:** Hang on, just let me think for a second… cognition, this thing, it doesn’t work around it. Your brain can’t form thought, (//static//) it hurts, it’s like dying, and--
> 
> **Command:** Bravo, do you have eyes on the entity?
> 
> **Bravo:** It’s in my head, guys. Coiled up in there like a snake, and something about it is… caustic. (//Pauses//) I can see it, just in front of me. It’s not doing anything, it’s… it isn’t moving. Just hanging there, with its mouth open. I think it’s finished eating. (//Pauses//) That fluid is seeping through the skin around its head, about a meter back. Just looking at the stuff is making me… like the room is spinning. I feel nauseous. My head isn’t working right. (//Laughter//) There's an abortion under the floorboards, and another in the sink. Wait, this is wrong, that wasn't me. Who said that?
>
> **Bravo:** My… I’m going to collect a sample, hang on.
> 
> **Command:** Bravo, we’re going to send out a crew to get you, just hold on.
> 
> **Bravo:** Oh no, don’t do that. Not… you have to be trained to not feel the things I’m feeling, otherwise it will get into you. Maybe it will anyway, who knows. It feels like the end of the world down here, fellas. My heart is really going off the charts, and I think I’m dying. Just-- (//Pauses//) I got a sample. I’ll attach it to one of those little balloons and let it float up. You’ll be able to get it later. Don’t spend too much time around that stuff, it… it doesn’t… your mind… it… (//Quick, heavy breathing//) 
> 
> **Command:** Bravo?
> 
> **Bravo:** I think I’m dying. I’m dying, I know I’m dying, this is it. I just want to get away from here. You know, it occurs to me… don’t send anyone else in, it’s so dark. (//Heavy breathing//)
> 
> **Command:** Bravo?

//Over the next half hour, the SCPF Stravinsky attempted to approach O-9 Bravo, with no success. Command continued to attempt to communicate with O-9 Bravo, but Bravo grew increasingly unintelligible, before eventually going completely silent. Bravo's radio stayed active over the next three days, and intermittent breathing could be heard until the radio ceased functioning.//

**Addendum 3000.2:** Atzak Protocol

> [[=]]
> @@@@
> @@@@
> 
> [[image warning2.png]]
> 
> **This protocol dictates certain interactions with a CLASS VIII COGNITOHAZARDOUS ENTITY, SCP-3000, and as such is LEVEL 5/3000 CLASSIFIED.** 
> [[/=]]
> -----
> **Preface:** The following protocol was developed in conjunction with researchers from Site-29 and Site-50, as well as researchers stationed at Site-151. Some sections may have been redacted to remove material above this classification. Adherence to this protocol is required for all personnel assigned to Site-151, as well as all personnel assigned to the SCPF Eremita.
> 
> **Abstract:** The 151-HOLLISTER ATZAK PROTOCOL has been developed and implemented to create a strategy for the management of the Y-909 chemical compound excreted by SCP-3000.
> 
> **Protocol Information:** The Y-909 compound, originally discovered by the late Dr. Adam Hollister, is a critical component in several modern and experimental amnestic compounds. Specifically, the following amnestics now contain a refined version of the Y-909 compound:
> 
> * Class-A (2016 variant)
> 
> * Class-D (2016 variant)
> 
> * Class-E (2016 variant)
> 
> * Class-X (2017 variant)
> 
> * Class-XX (2017 variant)
> 
> * [REDACTED]
> 
> * [REDACTED]
> 
> * Atzak-Class Experimental Compound 
> 
> * Foster-Class Experimental Compound
> 
> * Ellipse-Class Experimental Compound
> 
> The inclusion of the Y-909 compound has shown a marked increase in the stability and long-term effectiveness of the aforementioned amnestics. Overall, amnestics utilizing Y-909 break down 78% slower than their standard counterparts in cold storage, and 52% slower than their standard counterparts at room temperature.
> 
> Additionally, individuals administered an amnestic regimen utilizing Y-909 show a marked increase in suggestibility, memory clearance, and a significant decrease in additional side-effects (such a nausea, vomiting, bowel distress, blurred vision, headaches, insomnia, heart damage, and others). Individuals treated with these amnestics expressed significantly fewer intrusive memories as those without Y-909, with some individuals exposed to experimental compounds expressing no intrusive memories whatsoever, even at the 5 and 10 year marks. 
> 
> Due to the effectiveness of these treatments with the addition of Y-909, the continued inclusion of this compound is essential to modern Foundation amnestic application. Reliance on the continued use of Y-909 necessitates its collection for the foreseeable future, as a synthetic version of the compound has not yet been discovered.
> 
> As such, this protocol dictates the way this compound is collected off of SCP-3000, and the way personnel are to interact with SCP-3000. Below is a brief framework of the procedure, and detailed information can be found in the full Atzak brief:
> 
> * Personnel on-board the //SCPF Eremita// are to monitor SCP-3000 during feeding sessions (see below). During this time, **no personnel are permitted to leave the //Eremita// without authorization from mission command.**
> 
> * Throughout this stage, //SCPF Eremita// should monitor SCP-3000's position, and adjust course if the entity begins to move away from the feeding site. Mission command will provide additional instructions during this phase if necessary.
> 
> * At a point after the total consumption of prey, SCP-3000 will begin to excrete Y-909 through specialized cells near the foremost section of its body.
> 
> * Specialized teams of deep-sea divers are to exit the //SCPF Eremita// through the aft airlock and approach SCP-3000. Collection of Y-909 must take place during SCP-3000's "digestive" period, which is currently believed to be roughly two and a half hours after consumption of prey. Teams must return to launch craft before the end of this period. During this period, the typical effects of SCP-3000 are less severe, though Command should continue to monitor these teams for damage to their cognition.
> 
> * After collection of Y-909 is complete, personnel are to transfer the collected substance to secure containers before returning to the surface. The mission administrator onboard the //Eremita// is to monitor the substance throughout transport.

**Addendum 3000.3:** Psychological Evaluation

[[include component:image-block name=krishnamoorthy.png|width=250px|caption=Dr. Venkatraman Krishnamoorthy]]

//Note: On ██/██09, Level 3 Researcher Venkatraman Krishnamoorthy attempted to exit out the Eremita's aft airlock without scuba equipment, but was quickly restrained and the airlock cycle aborted. Having not displayed any previous signs of depression or suicidal attempt prior to his assignment aboard the Eremita, Krishnamoorthy was interviewed by staff clinical psychologist Dr. Anand Mannava to acquire a better understanding of SCP-3000's potential effect on his psyche.//

> [BEGIN LOG]
> 
> **Mannava:** Hi Venkat, how are you feeling?
> 
> **Krishnamoorthy:** Unwell.
> 
> **Mannava:** That's what I hear. Do you want to talk about what happened today?
> 
> //Krishnamoorthy is silent.//
> 
> **Mannava:** We don't have to, if you don't want to. We can talk about something else.
> 
> **Krishnamoorthy:** I'm tired, Anand.
> 
> **Mannava:** I understand. This assignment has been stressful on all of--
> 
> **Krishnamoorthy:** It's not, no, it isn't the stress. I've done this before, I've been on... I don't actually know if I've done this before.
> 
> **Mannava:** You have.
> 
> **Krishnamoorthy:** I don't remember it. Any of it. I've been getting these out of context feelings, like my body reacting to reflexes it didn't know it had. Everything is so disconnected, and trying to keep it together is... I'm just tired.
> 
> **Mannava:** When did you start feeling this way?
> 
> **Krishnamoorthy:** How long have we been down here? I don't remember. I don't know when, I honestly don't. I wish I could tell you more than that, but I have nothing. I look to that place in my mind and there's something else there-- or sometimes nothing at all. 
> 
> **Mannava:** What do you mean, something else?
> 
> **Krishnamoorthy:** I've been having other peoples' dreams, Anand. I see faces I don't recognize, places I know I've never been... or maybe I have. I don't know. How can I know what is real or not, when I can't trust my own mind?
> 
> **Mannava:** Well, maybe I can help you with that, Venkat. We can go over things you think you've forgotten, and I can--
> 
> **Krishnamoorthy:** Don't patronize me. I know you've felt it, Anand. Your mind gets hazy. Parts of you start to slip, your memories grow faint, fading in and out until they're gone, or worse, replaced. You see pasts that aren't yours, experiences that you never lived. You start to become other people, or... nobody at all.
> 
> **Mannava:** Venkat, please. I'm just trying to help.
> 
> **Krishnamoorthy:** You know, I don't even remember how we met. I know your name, know that you're a psychologist, but are we friends? Are we brothers? I don't know how I know you. We work together, I know that. I still have that. But other things, they come and go. I don't know if I am married, or have children[[footnote]]Dr. Krishnamoorthy was married twice, and has two sons and three daughters between the two marriages.[[/footnote]]. 
> 
> **Mannava:** I see.
> 
> **Krishnamoorthy:** And that... that isn't the worst of it. I know this is happening to me, I know that my mind is coming apart. But there's something else in there, too. Something rising out of the... out of the smoke of my smoldering consciousness. That //eel//.
> 
> **Mannava:** The eel?
> 
> **Krishnamoorthy:** I don't... I don't remember my mother. I can hear her voice, but I can't remember her face. I can't remember how she smelled, or how she... but what I do remember is she told me about gods. (//Pauses//) There is a god, called Anantashesha. A serpent, the king of serpents. Said to lie beneath Vishnu in the cosmos. A six headed snake god, isn't that something?
> 
> **Mannava:** It... yes, I am familiar.
> 
> **Krishnamoorthy:** Ah... of course, I'm sorry. I forgot. (//Pauses//) She... I don't remember much, but I do remember that she told me about how Anantashesha would... would linger past the end. Gaze upon the darkness past the end of time. She said that, when the light of the universe had gone out, all that would be left is Anantashesha. (//Pauses//) I have worked my entire life for the Foundation, so much as I can recall. I have struggled to build my name and my reputation and done everything I can do to leave... something, anything. Some kind of mark that says I was here. But...
> 
> **Mannava:** What is it?
> 
> **Krishnamoorthy:** I... I believe that SCP-3000 is Anantashesha. I believe that this... this aberration, this treachery against cognition, is the result of us being in the presence of a god. Not just a god, but a god who exists across all time, all at once, and... even beyond. Maybe... maybe the some part of the nothingness beyond the edge of time is part of Anantashesha, as well. Maybe it acts as, as a conduit, some kind of--
> 
> **Mannava:** Venkat, please, we're scientists--
> 
> **Krishnamoorthy:** No, let me finish. In defiance of the //nothingness// that comes after this, all of this, there is Anantashesha. There's a chance that my memories might live on, that I might be remembered like the memories I've seen have been through me. I don't... I don't have proof of this. But when I looked into its eyes and saw what it showed me, I was afraid. Afraid of being forgotten. Afraid of my life being meaningless. Afraid of being alone. Afraid of dying. (//Sighs//) There is a terror within me that I cannot reconcile, Anand. I won't lie to you and tell you that the maw of the naga does not terrify me as well, but between this and the infinite dark I have gazed into, I have made up my mind.

**Addendum 3000.5:** Personal Journal of Dr. Mannava 

//Note: The following are excerpts from the personal diaries of Dr. Anand Mannava. Dr. Mannava has kept several journals during his assignment, and has reported that it is beneficial to counteract the psychological and memory-affecting properties of SCP-3000.//

I come to bury Venkat, not to praise him.

Psychologically speaking, having your memories affected like his is not a pleasant experience for anyone. I really shouldn't be surprised he chose to relieve himself from having his memories meddled with - after all, it's really alarming. Being briefed on its effects doesn't change the fact that I need to constantly keep tabs on all staff, myself included, and ground us to reality. I am supposed to submit a full psychological report now, detailing what has gone wrong, why a staff member turned suicidal, and a full analysis of possible ways to prevent this from happening again in the future, to the O5 and Site Director Nox, have it reviewed and some new regimen designed to prevent such a travesty from happening again.

He always was more religious than I am. Right at the end of his life he was riffing on Anantashesha - a primordial Hindu snake god - and rambling about eternity. I'm not going to question the legitimacy of his beliefs and his claims, but this is quite the enigma, and I suppose I should consider myself lucky that this assignment is relatively benign compared to previous assignments that I've had. I don't think this is a mythical eel - anomalous, maybe, but not really that extraordinary. It's funny - I spent the last thirty years blocking out everything my father wanted to teach me about Hinduism and now I'm racking my brains trying to remember anything he had to say about it.

I want to say that it's because of the eel, but if I'm being honest with myself I simply tried to forget all his teachings. Maybe not at the beginning, but certainly by the end. I can barely even remember what he looked like. But I do remember how angry he got when I couldn't remember the names of my grandparents or great-uncles. He was desperate to preserve his --culture-- heritage, and I did everything I could to spite him. On his deathbed he begged me to perform the traditional last rites after his death. He even wrote the instructions down, but I was so angry at him that I tore them up front of him. I can't even remember why. The only memories I have of him are how he made me feel. He spent almost twenty years trying to pass down our heritage - and all I have now is anger and hatred and regret.

Site Director Nox gathered the staff this morning for a short mourning. After a few brief and laconic eulogies, he took me aside and told me that his replacement will come in a few weeks - and as he kept no contact with his family, it's likely his belongings will just be disposed of, and is now technically Foundation property. The director indicated that if I want to keep a thing or two from him, I should do so now.

His office was relatively unremarkable -  his cushy squashed chair cushion, few office toys, and lots of marine biology books that I should probably check out someday. The only thing I took was a statue of Ganesh that stood next to the window. Not fully sure why myself, but he's now sitting on the bookshelf, next to a picture of myself, my wife, and our daughter at a lakeside terrace. It was a pretty unremarkable trip to some tourist trap in Lucknow, but this really is one of our best-looking pictures.

We're going under again tomorrow.

All of the D-class managed to stay put today, which is good. Other than the routine depression and memory loss from exposure to SCP-3000, everything was in order.  Sometimes I'm a bit envious of them - all they know is that they're scooping gunk off some big eel. They don't know of its importance, or why it's critical that they collect it, and how much it helps us.

Of course, one saving grace of being on the psychological division for the Atzak Project is the awareness of its potential effects - I'm aware of what's happening to my psyche. I know that I have memories that are being drained, pieces that are being lost right now. I recall images of a young man on a bicycle, in front of a schoolyard gate, looking like it was the 80s, when I was in Singapore - he was laughing - yet I don't know if this man was a friend, a lover, a son, a family friend - who this young man is. Perhaps Italian? Or maybe Australian? Maybe this isn't even a cherished memory at all.

I've been reflecting on what Venkat told me before he passed though - his deep, deep seated fear of mediocrity. Unable to rise out of the sea of humans that walk on the face of this earth. He's worked for the Foundation for years, and while he isn't one of the most well-known and household names of the Foundation, he's not exactly obscure - he's been the Foundation's leading marine biologist and go-to-expert for anything aquatic, and quite well-revered. I'm actually quite surprised by his jealousy - he was never the flashy and bombastic type, and I would have never guessed that he wanted fame and recognition. 

Perhaps he really was afraid that he is doomed to be stuck in mediocrity.

Perhaps the silence of this place reminded him of something worse.

I looked at the Ganesh statue and the picture of my family again. It's really quite a shame, I truly forgot most anything that I've done with them. I've started trying to learn some Hindu poems and songs; went out and got a copy of the Vedas, but I can't memorize the lines properly.

What did Venkat mean? Why is he, all of a sudden, complaining about recognition? Maybe he feels that he is doomed to mediocrity by his circumstances, that no matter what he does, he can't overcome the path that he has taken already - one thing leads to another, one bad choice staining forever and tainting his life.

Or was it something greater still? He spoke to me once of the "lingering dread", what some of the crew have come to call this perpetual, creeping anxiety that you feel down here. Venkat said he was afraid of being forgotten, but what is worse: to be forgotten, or for there to be no one left to even forget you?

**Addendum 3000.6 :** Memorandum on Atzak Brief [LEVEL 5/3000 CLASSIFIED]

> //Some new assignments had questions about our work here, so I'm publishing this to clear most of them up. Feel free to contact my office if there are any others.//
> 
> //Our initial discovery of SCP-3000 was not without consequence. The cognitohazardous nature of the entity led to less than desirable outcomes with the personnel on those missions. Staffing policy was changed as soon as SCP-3000's effect on people was determined. Only individuals with Cognitive Resistance Values above a 25 are allowed on as staff, as they appear to be the least susceptible to the creature. This limits our potential workforce, so we must ensure the continued mental well being of our staff.//
> 
> //As for Y-909, its discovery was an unexpected fortune. We initially assumed it was bleeding and sent teams out to collect a sample for analysis. We lost the team, but acquired the sample. It wasn't blood; the substance more closely resembles a prion compound than anything else, and in its undiluted form exhibits many of the same properties as SCP-3000. Although Y-909 is remarkably dangerous to handle in its raw form, the late Dr. Hollister's work with the substance - in particular, his breakthrough in applying it to the production of amnestics - have shown that it is worth the risk.//
> 
> //However, we've approached an unfortunate impasse so far as Y-909 is concerned. The properties derived from it in our amnestics are unmatched. Frankly speaking, every amnestic used by the Foundation requires the chemical in some way; reverting to pre-Y-909 amnestics would hinder the Foundation's operations by an unacceptable margin. It would be the equivalent of trying to put out a fire with an eyedropper rather than a firehose. Until an effective alternative can be created, the harvesting of Y-909 is critical to the continued functionality of the Foundation.//
> 
> //Herein lies the ethical dilemma. SCP-3000 eats almost nothing. It shows absolutely no interest in almost all living organisms, from fish to reptiles to other mammals. Foundation biologists theorize that SCP-3000 could survive for a thousand years without any kind of sustenance. However, SCP-3000// does //eat. It exclusively preys on a single species: Homo sapiens.//
> 
> //If you're reading this, you have been given explicit permission to do so by an Overseer. The classification of this information is higher than any of the members of the Ethics Committee. There will be no investigations into what is being done here, nor will any inquiries be made. Nobody knows, except the people at the top of the Y-909 program and the people on-board this sub. All individuals who transfer out will be amnesticized. The SCP-3000 operation is completely off the record.//
> 
> //The crew of the Emerita is to keep a contingent of D-Class onboard for custodial duties, etc. None of them are to have a CRV over 9. Failsafes within the onboard systems have been included to keep any of the D-Class from destroying the ship, but they are not to be stopped from leaving the ship otherwise. Our biologists hypothesize that the potency of Y-909 is improved by SCP-3000's consumption of individuals who have been driven to suicide by its effects, though this is a purely preliminary field of inquiry. Ensure that the ship is close enough for SCP-3000 to notice the D-Class. Once they have been consumed, send out crews to gather the chemical. Repeat as necessary.//

> //Lastly, it goes without saying what you'll have to do if none of them volunteer.//

When I was a child, I saw an animal dying by the side of a road.

It had been struck by a car, and its belly was flattened. Flies had already begun to gather and its eyes bulged from its head. It coughed and groaned and fought desperately to stay alive in spite of its wounds. I watched it from a distance, too fearful to come close. Too afraid.

In the moment before it died, it looked at me.

I do not remember what kind of animal it was. I don't remember the smell, or the sound of flies. But I do remember the look in the creature's eyes, as it was struck with the realization of its own doom. I was watching a mind, a consciousness, a soul of sorts realizing that it would fade, scattered into nothingness - its mind realizing that it will soon be an outside observer. Then silence.

We, all of us, are nothing more than the sum of our experiences. Our memories, the memories of others, they are what shape and make us. Create the illusion of permanence. Give us hope. //You know how you break an animal? You take away its hope. Put it in a corner and block every exit. Let the dread seep in.//

I write words that are not my own. --Where are they coming from?-- Are these false as well? What is a man when his mind is undone?

I look at this picture of my wife, and my child. I have spent a lifetime with them. Shared a life with them. When we were happy, there was joy. Other //times drove a wedge between us, and we all knew there was something festering in that space.// But this woman, my wife, is

I opened the back of the frame today, and saw it penned in his own hand. Venkat's sister and his niece. I was with them on that day, before I took this assignment. I was never married. the life i remember living is not mine --if all we are is our memories, what is a man without them--

--I figured out what the eel does. Something about it, something latent, or some essential part of its nature, abhors cognition. The seams come undone, and whats inside comes spilling out. What I haven't figured out is how other things can end up in the dead space where--

If the sum of our lives can be so easily dashed like a ship against rocks, what is our worth? --Venkat prayed for eternity within Anantashesha-- it doesn't matter if the eel is Anantashesha. The eel isn't the end of all things, it just shows us what the end looks like.

the end is dark

the end is quiet

and you won't be remembered when you get there

//Note: Dr. Mannava was later discovered, unresponsive, near the aft airlock. Evidence suggested that Dr. Mannava had broken into the onboard storage locker and ingested a significant amount of raw Y-909. Dr. Mannava was moved off of the Eremita, and remains at Site-151 for analysis.//
