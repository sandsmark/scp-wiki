[[span style="font-size: small; font-weight: 400; color: #222;"]] That's an excellent question. Site 57 recently reached out to me about Roads and Hopes, and said that it can be used for an emergency Plan B, in case they have an anomaly of theirs that proves to be more trouble than it's worth.

//Excerpts from a news report on the opening of a new [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3739|Moosphere, Inc.]]] production facility, 1 February 2025://

> Consumer Reports recently announced that business is "going well" at the recently constructed Mindscape Megafactory here out of Bangalore, India.
> 
> I sat down with factory manager Sanjay Lochan last week, who told me about the success of what is being called the Mindscape phenomenon. "We fulfill about 1,500 orders daily, and have a current waiting list of 30,000 people," he says. "It's in high demand. We offer people a chance to become what they never would have been naturally. It's a surprising business model that would not have even worked ten years ago." This is in reference to the Veil protocol, which as you may know, was the [...]

> "Aren't you concerned about the safety?" I ask him.
> 
> "Quite the contrary! People consent with their dollars, and they consent to cranial probes before we even admit them, and they light up in all the right areas," Sanjay tells me. "The truth is people enjoy it. They like it. And, you know, why wouldn't they?"
> 
> I can't argue with that logic, Sanjay! The process involves hooking oneself up with the pumping station, through which you can experience a prolonged astral projection for just under 18,000 rupees. Trials for a more permanent, long-distance experience -- in a process known as "astral bridging" -- are being assessed in a lab in Hong Kong. Moosphere Astrologists say they want to allow a chance to explore nearby nebulae from the comfort of your own home!

> Our interview was unexpectedly candid. Anonymous Moosphere representatives tell us they have five factories going up in India alone in the next six months. I even went to the factory grounds to join my mind with the The Galactous Chorus...
