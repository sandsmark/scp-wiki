//Excerpts from a news segment on the opening of a new [[[scp-3739|Moosphere, Inc.]]] production facility, 1 February 2025://

> Consumer Reports recently announced that business is "going well" at the newly constructed Mindscape Megafactory here out of Bangalore, India.
> 
> Last week, I attended an exclusive press tour of the facility grounds. I spoke with factory manager Sanjay Lochan, who told me about the company's success in what they call the 'Mindscape' industry. "We fulfill about 1,500 orders daily, and have a current waiting list of 30,000 people," he says. "It's in high demand. We offer people a chance to become what they never would have been naturally. It's a surprising business model that would not have even worked ten years ago." This is, of course, in reference to the Veil protocol, which as you may know, was [...]

> Anonymous Moosphere representatives -- who relayed messages through a company liaison, to avoid divulging trade secrets -- told us they have five factories going up in India alone in the next eighteen months.
> 
> Their facilities use state-of-the-art paratechnology that's genuinely out of this world. "Aren't you concerned about consumer safety?" I ask Sanjay in private.
> 
> "Quite the contrary. People consent with their dollars, and they consent to cranial probes before we even admit them, and they light up in all the right areas," Sanjay tells me. "The truth is people enjoy it. They like it. And why wouldn't they?"
> 
> I can't argue with that logic, Sanjay! One process involves hooking oneself up with the pumping station, through which you can experience a prolonged astral projection for just under 18,000 rupees. Trials for a more permanent, long-distance experience -- in a process known as "astral bridging" -- are underway in a lab in Hong Kong. Moosphere Astrologists say they want to allow "[a] chance to explore nearby nebulae from the comfort of your own home!"

> Overall, my talks with Sanjay were unexpectedly candid. Sanjay, my crew, and I laughed for what must have been hours. The ruckus garnered a few furtive glances from the otherwise focused line workers, who stood wide-eyed and taciturn at their stations the entire day. Talk about diligent work ethic! But, of course, before the tour was over, Sanjay brought me down to the R&D Wing to join my mind with [[span style="color: #407fbf;"]]The Lactescent Chorus[[/span]]–
