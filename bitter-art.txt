Fresh-faced and armed with PhD's in Biology and Neuroscience, Thirty-one-year-old Dr. B. Ewing spent three years assigned to detailing the inner workings of the various monsters the Foundation had to offer- that is, before being graciously presented with the role as Site-114's Director. She jumped at the chance, and now rules her department with a by-the-book attitude and an ever-growing fascination with the bizarre. 

Ewing's research and containment of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3199 SCP-3199] earned her a much-deserved appreciation and positive regard from her superiors, and she one day hopes to utilise some of the weird and wonderful aspects of your favourite SCP monsters into something that could benefit both the Foundation, and mankind as a whole.
