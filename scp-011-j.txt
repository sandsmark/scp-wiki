**Item #:** SCP-011-J

**Object Class:** Euclid (Because we don’t know where it is! Do we? Where’s it gone?)

**Special Containment Procedures:** Any sighting of SCP-011-J must be acknowledged verbally, in a high-pitched voice, with all words sharply enunciated. Subjects must react in the same way when witnessing SCP-011-J disappear.

**Description:** SCP-011-J is the new-born offspring of Foundation Doctor Jones, which has the anomalous power of dematerialising whenever an observer obstructs their vision with their hands, or nearby furniture. When visual contact is re-established, SCP-011-J rematerializes, to the great surprise and relief of onlookers.
